These, amended from time to time, have been made applicable, mutatis\nmutandis, to the subsidiaries and mutual funds established by banks and Financial Institutions\nexcept where they are contrary to specific SEBI and RBI regulations governing their operations.\nHitherto, the Primary Dealers which are subsidiaries of banks were following the instructions\ncontained in the above issues.  Since some of the Primary Dealers do not belong to the category\nof subsidiary of a bank/Financial Institution, these stipulations are not being applied to the non-\nsubsidiary Primary Dealers. A need for bringing in uniformity in the guidelines applicable to all\nthe Primary Dealers has therefore been felt.  The enclosed Annexure contains the guidelines that\nwould be applicable to all the Primary Dealers irrespective of whether they are subsidiaries of\nbanks/Financial Institutions, companies set up by foreign entities etc. These guidelines are\nprimarily intended to set standards for internal organisation and prudential operational conduct\nand need to be followed not withstanding the guidelines issued to banks and Financial\nInstitutions on the subject.\n2.    The guidelines are contained in two parts. The instructions given in Part A would need to be\ncompulsorily adopted/adhered to by the Primary Dealers.  Part B contains the prudential checks\nand balances and systems any market participant is expected to have in place.  The Primary\nDealers may review their existing systems with regard to these prudential practices and modify\ntheir systems suitably wherever required.\n 3. The Primary Dealers may please confirm to us that they have adopted /put in place internal\ncontrol guidelines for securities transactions incorporating the enclosed guidelines. A report on\nthe implementation of the guidelines may be furnished to us by February 29, 2000.\nPlease acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(Usha Thorat)\nChief General Manager\nEncl: As above.Attachment\nGuidelines on Securities transactions\nto be followed by Primary Dealers\nPart - A\nGuidelines to be compulsorily adopted/implemented by the PDs\n1) Management oversight, policy/operational guidelines -  The management of a Primary Dealer\nshould bear primary responsibility for ensuring maintenance of appropriate standards of conduct\nand adherence to proper procedures by the entity. Primary Dealers should frame and implement\nsuitable policy guidelines on securities transactions. Operational procedures and controls in\nrelation to the day-to-day business operations  should also be worked out and put in place to\nensure that operations in securities are conducted in accordance with sound and acceptable\nbusiness practices.\nWith the approval of respective  Boards, the PDs should clearly lay down the broad objectives to\nbe followed while undertaking transactions in securities on their own account and on behalf of\nclients, clearly define the authority to put through deals, procedure to be followed while putting\nthrough deals, various prudential  exposure limits, policy regarding dealings with brokers,\nsystems for management of various risks, guidelines for valuation of the portfolio and the\nreporting systems etc. While laying down such policy guidelines, the PDs should strictly observe\nReserve Bank\u2019s instructions, if any ,  on the following:\nReady Forward deals\nTransactions through SGL Account\nInternal Controls/Risk Management System\nDealings through Brokers\nAccounting Standards\nAudit, Review and Reporting\nAny other instructions issued from time to time\n       The internal policy guidelines on securities transactions framed by the PD, duly certified by\nits management to the effect that they are in accordance with the RBI guidelines and that they\nhave been put in place, may be perused by the Statutory Auditors and commented upon as to the\nconformity of the guidelines with the instructions/guidelines issued by RBI.\nThe effectiveness of the policy and operational guidelines should be periodically evaluated.\n2) Prohibition of short selling of securities - The Primary Dealers should not put through any\nsale transaction without actually holding the security in its portfolio i.e. under no circumstances,\na PD should hold a oversold position in any security.\n3) Concurrent audit of securities transactions - Securities transactions should be separately\nsubjected to a concurrent audit by internal/external auditors to the extent of 100% and the results\nof the audit should be placed before the CEO/ CMD of the PD once every month. The\ncompliance wing should monitor the compliance on ongoing basis, with the laid down policies\nand prescribed procedures, the applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the deficiencies\npointed out in the audits and report directly to the management.4) All problem exposures where security of doubtful value, diminution of value  to be provided\nfor - All problem exposures, if any, which are not backed by any security or backed by security\nof doubtful value should be fully provided for.\n5) Provision also for suits under litigation - Even in cases where a PD has filed suit against\nanother party for recovery, such exposures should be evaluated and provisions should be made to\nthe satisfaction of auditors.\n6) Claims against the PD to be taken note of and provisions made - Any claim against the PD\nshould also be taken note of and provisions made to the satisfaction of auditors.\n7) Problem exposures to be reflected clearly in Profit and Loss Account -  The profit and loss\naccount should, reflect the problem exposures, if any, as also the effect of valuation of  portfolio,\nas per the instructions issued by the Reserve Bank, if any, from time to time. The report of the\nstatutory auditors should contain a certification to this effect.\n8) Business through brokers and contract limits for approved brokers -  A disproportionate part\nof the business should not be transacted through only one or a few brokers.  PDs should fix\naggregate contract limits for each of the approved brokers.  A limit of 5%, of total transactions\n(both purchase and sales) entered into by a PD during a  year should be treated as the aggregate\nupper contract limit for each of the approved brokers.  This limit should cover both the business\ninitiated by a PD and the business offered/brought to the PD by a broker. PDs should ensure that\nthe transactions entered into through individual brokers during a year normally does not exceed\nthis limit.  However, if for any reason it became necessary to exceed the aggregate limit for any\nbroker, the specific reasons therefor should be recorded, in writing, by the authority empowered\nto put through the deals.  Further, the board should be informed of this, post facto.  However, the\nnorm would not be applicable to PD\u2019s dealings through other Primary Dealers.\na) Business through brokers to be audited - The concurrent auditors who audit the securities\noperations should scrutinise the business done through brokers also and include it in their report\nto the CEO/ CMD of the PD.  Besides, the business put through any individual broker or brokers\nin excess of the limit, with the reasons therefor, should be covered in the review to the Board of\nDirectors.\n9) Investments in and Underwriting of Shares, Debentures and PSU Bonds and Investments\nin Units of Mutual Funds - Guidelines -  PDs should formulate, within the above parameters,\ntheir own internal guidelines, as approved by their Board of Directors, on securities transactions\neither by directly subscribing or through secondary market with counter-party or counter-party\ngroup, including norms to ensure that excessive exposure against any single counter-party or\ngroup or product is avoided and that due attention is given to the maturity structure and the\nquality of such transactions.

The deal slips should be\nserially numbered and controlled separately to ensure that each deal slip has been properly\naccounted for.  Once the deal is concluded, the dealer should immediately pass on the deal slip to\nthe back office for recording and processing.  For each deal there must be a system of issue of\nconfirmation to the counter-party.  The timely receipt of requisite written confirmation from the\ncounter-party, which must include all essential details of the contract, should be monitored by the\nback office.\nd) No substitution of counter party  - Once a deal has been concluded, there should not be any\nsubstitution of the counter- party  by another  by the broker, through whom the deal has been\nentered into.

These regulations are being\nreviewed by the Bank from time to time keeping in view the emerging situations.\n2.Pursuant to our Governor's Statement on Mid-Term Review of Monetary and Credit\nPolicy for the year 1999-2000 issued on October 29, 1999, the following changes and further\ninstructions are issued for information and necessary action :\n(1)Borrowings from Mutual Funds to be\nexempted from the purview of public deposits\nThe borrowings from mutual funds are presently treated as Public Deposits. However, the\nBank has received representations from leading NBFCs, more particularly the Primary Dealers,\nthat the borrowings from mutual funds should be excluded from the purview of public deposits.\nIn view of the fact that the mutual funds have the time tested appraisal techniques for assessment\nof the borrowers' capacity to repay the debts and they do not require the same degree of\nprotection as needed by the depositors under the RBI Act,  it has been decided to exempt the\nborrowings from mutual funds from the purview of public deposits. Accordingly, the Non-\nBanking Financial Companies Acceptance of Public Deposits (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998\ncontained in the Notification DFC.118/DG(SPT)-98 dated    January 31, 1998 has been amended.\nA copy of the amending notification is enclosed for your information and necessary action. The\nNBFCs could reduce the amount of borrowings from mutual funds while computing the\noutstanding public deposits as on December 31, 1999 and maintain the liquid assets on and from\nApril 1, 2000 on the remaining public deposit liabilities as per the  extant provisions under\nSection 45-IB of the RBI Act, 1934.(2) Need for public notice before\n(i)  closure of the branch/office by any NBFC\n(ii)  sale/transfer of ownership by an NBFC\n(a)    With  a view to ensuring that an NBFC intending to close a particular branch/ office gives\nproper notice to the depositors and adequate arrangements are made to service the deposits\nmobilised through such a branch/office, it has been decided that the concerned NBFC should\ngive at least 3 months public notice prior to the date of closure of any of its branches/ offices in,\nat least, one leading national news paper and a leading local (covering the place of branch /\noffice) vernacular language newspaper indicating therein the purpose and arrangements being\nmade to service the depositors etc.\n(b)(i)   Reserve Bank grants Certificate of Registration to an NBFC after assessing and\nevaluating various factors including the quality of promoters and management to protect\nthe interests of depositors and the soundness of the financial system. To ensure that the\nnew management subserves the above objectives and to keep the public informed of the\nchange of management and control of NBFCs, it has been decided that a public notice of\nthree months shall be given before effecting the sale of, or transfer of the ownership by\nsale of shares, or transfer of control, whether with or without sale of shares. Such public\nnotice shall be given by the NBFC and also by the transferor, or the transferee. For this\npurpose, the term 'control' shall have the same meaning as defined in Regulation 2(1) (c)\nof the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and\nTakeovers) Regulations, 1997.\n(ii)    The public notice should indicate the intention to sell or transfer ownership /\ncontrol, the particulars of transferee and the reasons for such sale or transfer of\nownership / control. The notice should be published in one leading national and another\nin leading local (covering the place of registered office) vernacular language newspaper.\nAn intimation along with a copy of the notice in respect of items (a) and (b) above should be\nsent within 7 days of its publication in the newspapers to the Regional Office of RBI under\nwhose jurisdiction the registered office of the company is located.\nImplementation of the recommendations of  the\nTask Force on NBFCs (Vasudev Committee)\n3.       The NBFC Directions on Acceptance of Public Deposits, Directions on Prudential Norms\nand Auditors Directions were last reviewed on December 18, 1998 to give effect to some of the\nrecommendations of the Task Force on NBFCs. Steps are afoot to implement the\nrecommendations which require amendments to the Statute.  The remaining recommendations\nwould be implemented in due course of time.\nRedesigning of Financial Statements of NBFCs\n4.       The necessity of separate formats of financial statements for NBFCs became more\npronounced with the issuance of the Non-Banking Financial Companies Prudential Norms(Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998. In order to satisfy the need and in tune with the\nrecommendations of the \"Expert Group on Designing a Supervisory framework for NBFCs\n(Khanna Committee)\", as also in the context of powers of the Bank to determine policy in\nrespect of accounting system of NBFCs, a Committee was formed for suggesting  separate\nformats of financial statements for the NBFCs, with members nominated by the Institute of\nChartered Accountants of India and officials of the Department of Non-Banking Supervision of\nReserve Bank of India. The Committee has submitted its report to the Bank on September 30,\n1999. The Bank has solicited the views of Department of Company Affairs, Govt. of India and\nthe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. With a view to getting wider acceptability, the\nreport has been discussed with the members of the Informal Advisory Group for Non-Banking\nFinancial Companies. It has also been placed on the Bank's Website (rbi.org.in).   The\nrecommendations of the Committee will be examined in the light of feedback received from\nvarious quarters and a final view will be taken thereafter.\n5.Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter to the General Manager/Deputy General\nManager of the Regional Office of the Department of Non-Banking Supervision under whose\njurisdiction the registered office of your company is located.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n( O.

Since Smart Cards/ Debit Cards are new payment instruments, it has\nbeen considered necessary to issue broad guidelines to banks including safeguards to be\nobserved in this regard. The guidelines are given in the Annexure-I for compliance by banks.\n2.   Banks may introduce Smart / Debit Cards with the approval of their Boards, keeping in\nview the Guidelines enclosed. While banks need not obtain the prior approval of the RBI, the\ndetails of smart / debit cards introduced may be advised to us together with a copy each of the\nagenda note put up to their Boards and the resolution passed thereon. It is advised that banks\nshould not issue smart/debit cards in tie-up with any other non-bank entities.\n3.   The banks should review operations of Smart / Debit Cards and put up review notes to\ntheir Boards at half-yearly intervals, say, as at the end of March and September, every year.\n4.

Hence, the Board of Directors and the Top Management of banks\nand financial institutions should devote special attention to the strengthening of the Year\n2000 Contingency Plans of their respective organisation. The Group also felt that Critical\nMinimum Parameterization ( CMP) for a comprehensive Year 2000 Contingency Plan should\nbe identified and communicated to banks and financial institutions for their guidance.\nAccordingly, by picking out the common elements from contingency plans received from\nbanks, a list of core considerations representing the Critical Minimum Parameters for a\ncomprehensive Year 2000 contingency plan has been compiled and presented in the\nAnnexure for the information and guidance of banks and financial institutions. The CMP is\nintended to serve as a Self-Assessment Check List which banks and financial institutions may\nuse for a self-evaluation of their Contingency Plans.\nBanks and financial institutions would be well advised to ensure that the contingency plans\nprepared by them are comprehensive and compare favorably when evaluated with reference\nto the suggested Critical Minimum Parameterization. Banks and financial institutions are also\nadvised to keep their Board of Directors informed of the findings of their self evaluation of\nthe organisation\u2019s Year 2000 Contingency Plans.\nYours faithfully\n(M.R.

BC. 190 / 07.01.279 /99-2000 dated\nOctober 29, 1999 enclosing a copy of the statement on \u201cMid -Term Review of Monetary\nand Credit Policy for the year 1999-2000\u201d. In this connection, we advise as under:\n2. (a)  Reduction in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR )\nUnder Section 42 (1) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 all Scheduled Commercial\nBanks  {excluding Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs)} are, at present, required to maintain\nwith the Reserve Bank of India a Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) of 10 per cent of the Net\nDemand and Time Liabilities (NDTL)  (excluding liabilities subject to zero CRR\nprescription) .  In the light of the macro-economic and monetary policy developments\nreviewed, it has been decided to reduce the CRR. Accordingly, the CRR to be maintained\nby the Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) will be reduced by one\npercentage point from the present level of 10 per cent to 9 per cent of NDTL in two\ninstallments as set out below:\nEffective from the fortnight\nbeginning fromCRR on Net Demand and Time\nLiabilities (per cent)\nNovember 06, 1999 9.50\nNovember 20, 1999 9.00\n(b) Exemptions from Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) on Liabilities under\nForeign Currency Non Resident (Banks) Accounts (FCNR (B)):\nAt present, under Section 42(1A) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 all the\nScheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) are required to maintain\nan incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) of 10 per cent on increase in liabilities under\nForeign Currency Non Resident (Banks) Scheme over the level as on April 11, 1997. It\nhas now been decided that with effect from the fortnight beginning November 06, 1999\nthe liabilities under FCNR (B) will be exempted from the maintenance of incremental\nCRR of 10 per cent.\n3. Copies of the relative notifications DBOD No BC.110 /12.01.001/99-2000, DBOD\nNo.BC.111 /    12.01.001/99-2000  both dated October 29, 1999 are enclosed.\n4. It  may be  reiterated that in view of the multiple prescriptions of CRR  on different\ncategories of liabilities including zero prescription  of CRR on certain liabilities , as\nstipulated under the law , effective CRR maintained by Scheduled Commercial Banks on\ntotal Net Demand and Time Liabilities should not be less than 3 per cent.\n5. Change of  the procedure for calculation of CRR :\nAt present all the Scheduled Commercial Banks are required to maintain the prescribed\nCash Reserve Ratio during the fortnight based on the NDTL obtaining on Friday\nimmediately preceding the fortnight  as per the instructions contained in para 3 of our\ncircular DBOD No.leg BC.23/46A-85 dated March 05, 1985.   In order to improve the\ncash management by banks, as a measure of simplification, it has been decided to\nintroduce a lag of two weeks in the maintenance of stipulated CRR by banks. Thus, the\nprescribed CRR during a fortnight will be maintained by every Scheduled Commercial\nBank based on its NDTL as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight. This\nchange in the procedure for calculation of reserve maintenance will be effective from the\nfortnight beginning from November 06, 1999. It is clarified that under the revisedprocedure, the banks shall calculate Cash Reserve Ratio for the fortnight beginning from\nNovember 6, 1999 based on the NDTL as on reporting Friday, October 22, 1999.\n6.Flexibility in the treatment of CRR :\nNormally, banks maintain minimum cash in their own vaults since it is an idle asset,\nwithout the benefit of earning any interest. In the context of date change at the turn of the\ncentury, in order to meet any additional demand for bank notes as a contingency, banks\nmay have to keep larger vault cash for meeting their business transactions. At present\nsuch cash in hand with the bank though an eligible asset for SLR , is not counted for CRR\nrequirements. To facilitate banks to tide over the contingency during the millennium\nchange , it has been decided to treat cash in hand maintained by the banks for compliance\nof CRR for a limited period of two months commencing from December 1, 1999 to\nJanuary 31, 2000. It is clarified here that the cash in hand which will be counted for CRR\npurposes, during the above period cannot be treated as eligible asset for SLR purposes\nsimultaneously. A copy of the relative notification DBOD No.BC. 112/12.01.001/99-\n2000  dated October 29, 1999 is enclosed.\n7. As already indicated, for operational convenience, the maintenance of CRR by banks is\nbeing lagged by two weeks .  As such, for maintaining  CRR during the fortnight\nbeginning January 1, 2000, the NDTL base would be December 17, 1999.  With the\nleverage of two weeks available, banks should not have any problem in complying with\nthe CRR requirement around the century date change .  Nevertheless, any bank that\nexpects  a special problem in meeting its CRR obligations at the end of the year can\napproach the RBI for appropriate relaxation/assistance.\n8.Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n (N.K.Sarkar  )\nChief General Manager.\nEncl:  3\nEndt .

The mid-term\nassessment of macro-economic developments is in line with the earlier projections and, by\nand large, it is proposed to continue with the direction and thrust of policy measures\nannounced in April 1999 for the rest of the year. The stance of monetary policy for the\nsecond half of 1999-2000 would also remain broadly the same as in the first half.\nI. Mid-Term Review of Macro-economic and\nMonetary Developments in 1999-2000\nDomestic developments\n2.According to the latest meteorological report, the rainfall in terms of quantum and\nspatial distribution was generally satisfactory. During the year, upto end September 1999, 28\nout of 35 meteorological sub-divisions covering 81 per cent of the area and 67 per cent of the\ndistricts in the country received normal to excess rainfall. Seven meteorological sub-divisions\nreceived deficient rainfall, of which the deficiency was marginal in three sub-divisions. The\noverall assessment of the Meteorological Department is that the monsoon has been \u201cnormal\u201d\n(90 per cent of the long-term average of 903 mm). The best estimate at present is that the\nKharif crop would be of the order of 102 \u2013 103 million tonnes, about the same as the last\nyear\u2019s level. Assuming the expected improvements in the Rabi crop, it is likely that\nagricultural production for the year 1999-2000 will be higher than the previous year.\n3.So far as the industrial sector is concerned, after a period of deceleration, there are\nnow welcome signs of a recovery. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) registered a\ngrowth of 6.0 per cent in the current financial year (April-August 1999) as compared with 4.2\nper cent during the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase in the IIP was\nmainly due to revival of growth in demand for manufactured products and is reflected in the\nsignificant improvement in the manufacturing output growth by 6.7 per cent as against 4.2\nper cent in the comparable period of the previous year. Signs of recovery were observed in\nsteel, cement and certain other sectors. This is reflected also in the turnaround in the demand\nfor non-food bank credit, and in the buoyancy seen in the stock and fixed income securities\nmarkets.\n4.According to the preliminary estimate of the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO),\nthe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during the first quarter of the current year grew at 5.5 per\ncent as against 3.6 per cent in the previous year. Assuming that the recovery in industrial\nproduction witnessed in the first half of the year will gather further momentum during the rest\nof the year, and there is no unexpected setback on the agricultural front, growth in GDP in the\ncurrent year is projected to be in the range of 6 to 6.5 per cent. This is consistent with the\nrange of 6 to 7 per cent, indicated in the April Statement.25.The rate of inflation on a point -to-point basis on October 9, 1999 was 2.51 per cent as\nagainst 8.07 per cent at the same time last year. On an average basis, the annual inflation rate\nis lower at 4.33 per cent as against 6.28 per cent at the same time last year. The drop in\nwholesale prices has also been reflected in the sharp fall in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nIn August 1999, the CPI inflation rate was on a point-to-point basis as low as 3.15 per cent as\nagainst 15.04 per cent in August 1998. Allowing for some increase in prices due to seasonal\nfactors later in the year and adjustment lags in administered prices, the inflation rate for the\ncurrent year as a whole is likely to be lower than that of 4.8 per cent in the previous year.\nFood stocks at the end of August 1999 were 29.90 million tonnes, which is higher by 4.04\nmillion tonnes over the same time last year. High level of food stocks combined with a low\nrate of inflation, should provide greater manoeuvrability in managing the economy in the\nevent of any unexpected shocks.\n6.The rate of growth in money supply (M 3) during the current financial year upto\nOctober 8, 1999 has been 7.9 per cent compared with 10.1 per cent in the corresponding\nperiod of the previous year. Annual growth in M 3 (October 8, 1999 over October 9, 1998)\nwas 16.0 per cent as against 21.1 per cent in the comparable period of the preceding year\n(excluding the contribution of receipts under Resurgent India Bonds, the increase in M 3 last\nyear was 18.7 per cent). Aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks in the current\nyear upto October 8, 1999 showed an increase of Rs.53,487 crore (7.5 per cent) as compared\nwith Rs.66,978 crore (11.2 per cent). Excluding Resurgent India Bonds, the increase in the\ncurrent year so far was 7.7 per cent against 8.2 per cent in the same period last year. On the\nbasis of current trends, the projected growth in aggregate deposits of Rs.1,18,500 crore for\nthe year as a whole looks realistic. In the light of the real sector trends and the expected\ninflation outlook, which are more or less consistent with the April Statement, the projected\norder of monetary expansion of 15.5 \u2013 16.0 per cent indicated in the April Statement, appears\nreasonable.\n7.Reserve money showed a lower expansion by Rs.6,322 crore (2.4 per cent) in the\ncurrent financial year so far upto October 22, 1999 as against an increase of Rs.11,623 crore\n(5.1 per cent) in the comparable period of previous year. Currency in circulation increased by\n7.7 per cent in the current financial year so far as against 9.4 per cent in the last year. On an\nannual basis, currency expansion was 14.6 per cent as against 13.6 per cent a year ago. The\nnet foreign exchange assets of RBI showed an increase of Rs.5,618 crore as compared with\nan increase of Rs.9,472 crore in the previous year. Net RBI credit to Government showed a\nlower increase of Rs.6,044 crore than Rs.13,710 crore in the previous year, mainly due to a\ndecline in credit to State Governments of Rs.3,843 crore as against a decline of Rs.307 crore\nin the previous year. On the com ponents side, the large increase in currency in circulation\nwas the characteristic feature of the reserve money expansion. Any possible expansion in\ncurrency till December/January 1999-2000 in the context of the millennium change is\nexpected to reverse to normal before the year end.\n8.Domestic and international developments have so far allowed the Reserve Bank to\nkeep liquidity in the system at a comfortable level without too large an expansion of reserve\nmoney. As per current expectations, it appears that, with some appropriate adjustments, there\nshould be no difficulty in meeting fully the liquidity needs of different sectors.\n9.There has also been a significant pick up in the bank credit and other flows to the\ncommercial sector from the banking system during the current year, especially from the\nfortnight ending July 2, 1999. Scheduled commercial banks\u2019 credit expanded by Rs.19,2373crore (5.2 per cent) upto October 8, 1999 as against an increase of Rs. 11,645 crore (3.6 per\ncent) in the previous year. Food credit increased by Rs.4,436 crore as against Rs.3,464 crore\nin the previous year. Non-food bank credit increased by Rs.14,802 crore (4.2 per cent) as\nagainst an increase of Rs.8,181 crore (2.6 per cent) in the previous year. Together with the\nprovisional data on investments in commercial paper, investments in bonds / shares /\ndebentures of PSUs and private corporate sector, the flow of resources from scheduled\ncommercial banks to the commercial sector increased by Rs.21,116 crore (5.3 per cent) as\nagainst Rs.17,540 crore (5.1 per cent) in the previous year. Banks' investments in instruments\nissued by financial institutions and mutual funds this year increased by Rs.1,498 crore as\nagainst Rs.3,136 crore last year. Total resource flow to the commercial sector including\ncapital issues, GDRs and borrowings from financial institutions increased by Rs.41,046 crore\nas compared with Rs.33,573 crore in the previous year.\n10. The Union Budget for 1999-2000 placed the net market borrowings of the Central\nGovernment at Rs.57,461 crore and gross borrowings at Rs.84,014 crore. In the current\nfinancial year upto October 26, 1999, the Central Government mobilised net borrowings of\nRs.57,977 crore, and gross market borrowings of Rs.72,630 crore. As spelt out on earlier\noccasions, RBI has been combining auction issues with acceptance by private placement of\ndated securities of the Government consistent with market conditions. The release of such\nsecurities through open market sales at opportune moments has helped to contain the\nvolatility in securities prices and reduce the associated risks to major participants like banks\nand primary dealers. Accordingly, in the current financial year so far, while devolvement\nincluding private placements with RBI amounted to Rs.29,267 crore accounting for 40.3 per\ncent of the gross market borrowings, the reserve money impact of this was neutralised by\nsales through open market operations conducted by RBI. Upto October 26, 1999, net sales of\ngovernment securities amounted to Rs.23,695 crore. Thus, RBI\u2019s subscriptions in primary\nissues under the Government borrowing programme, net of open market sales, this year\nremained at Rs.3,305 crore compared to Rs.8,909 crore in the corresponding period last year.\n11. In the current financial year , there has also been a move to elongate the maturity\nstructure of marketable debt of Government. The maturity period of issued securities ranged\nbetween 6 years and 20 years. Scheduled commercial banks\u2019 investment in government\nsecurities increased by Rs.36,648 crore in the current financial year so far (upto October 8,\n1999) as against an increase of Rs.27,533 crore in the corresponding period of previous year.\nBanks are presently holding government securities in excess of SLR prescription by a\nconsiderable margin. As mentioned in the April statement, in the interest of maintaining\nstable interest rate environment, Government\u2019s borrowing programme needs to be kept within\nreasonable limits. This will also reinforce the process of recovery in industrial sector and\nenable banks to adequately meet the demand for non-food bank credit.\n12.While RBI\u2019s policy of subscribing to government securities on private placement\nbasis, combined with active open market operations, has proved to be highly effective in\nkeeping interest rates relatively stable, an issue that needs to be considered is whether this is a\ndesirable policy of debt management from the long term point of view. There is merit in the\nview that ideally government securities should be sold in the market directly through\nauctions, and the interest rate determined by the market. However, at the present stage of\ndevelopment, government securities market is not deep or broad enough to correctly reflect\nthe prevailing liquidity conditions or the underlying interest rate outlook based on secondary\nmarket transactions. As the secondary market develops and turnover increases, it should be\npossible to exclusively rely on auctions to sell Government paper. This is the direction in4which RBI would like to move. However, one of the important requirements for the\nsecondary market in government securities to develop is for Government\u2019s net borrowing\nrequirements to be sustainable. Unfortunately, at present, there is very little flexibility\navailable in regard to either the timing or the size of Government borrowings in the primary\nmarket.\n13.In the management of monetary policy during the second half of the year, a critical\nfactor is the fiscal outlook for the rest of the year. While gross revenues during the first half\nhave been buoyant, the net revenue of the Central Government is actually a little lower than\nin the previous year because of the large increases in transfers to States and Union Territories.\nThe Central Government\u2019s gross fiscal deficit during the first five months constituted 60.2\nper cent of the budget estimate as compared with 52.0 per cent in the previous year. The\nrevenue deficit has also been high and contributed nearly 70.0 per cent to gross fiscal deficit\nas compared with 52.0 per cent last year. These developments do not augur well for the future\nunless determined action is taken to increase revenues, reduce deficits in the public sector,\nand reduce expenditure through appropriate policy actions. As recently announced by the\nGovernment, it is imperative that necessary actions to correct fiscal distortions are taken as\nearly as possible. It may also be mentioned that fiscal slippages are no longer regarded as a\nmatter of domestic concern alone. All over the world, international agencies and investors\nkeep a close watch on emerging trends in Government finances, as they have a bearing on\nfuture macro-economic stability.\nExternal Developments\n14.The two-year period since September 1997 has presented major challenges for the\nmanagement of the external sector. During this period, India had to cope with the global\neffects of a series of intense crises in East Asia, Russia and Brazil, in addition to continued\nuncertainties in industrial economies, particularly Japan. After the Pokhran test last year,\nIndia was also confronted with certain other unfavourable external developments, including\nsanctions imposed by several industrialised countries, the suspension of multilateral lending\n(except for some sectors), downgrading by international rating agencies, and reduction in\ninvestment by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). While there has been improvement in\nsome of these areas and there are signs of an upturn in the world economy in the last six\nmonths, the external outlook continues to be characterised by several uncertainties. The\nmanagement of the external sector in the first half of the current year also had to cope with\nsome uncertainties in investment outlook consequent upon dissolution of the Lok Sabha in\nApril 1999 and the ensuing electoral process.\n15.Viewed against the background of external and domestic uncertainties, developments\nin respect of both the exchange rate of the rupee as well as movement in foreign exchange\nreserves have been reasonably satisfactory. As on October 22, 1999, the foreign currency\nassets of the country were higher by US $ 3.70 billion compared with a year ago. Foreign\nexchange reserves, including gold and SDR were also higher by US $ 3.43 billion. At the\npresent level of foreign exchange reserves (at US $ 33.07 billion), reserves substantially\nexceed the total stock of short-term debt and portfolio flows. As pointed out in the April\nStatement, as a matter of conscious policy, India will continue to keep its short-term as well\nas forward liabilities at a manageable level in relation to the size of its reserves.\n16.The day-to-day movements in exchange rates are market determined. The primary\nobjective of the Reserve Bank in regard to the management of the exchange rate is to5maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market, to meet temporary supply-\ndemand gaps which may arise due to uncertainties or other reasons, and to curb destabilizing\nand self-fulfilling speculative activities. To this end, as in the past, the Reserve Bank will\ncontinue to monitor closely the developments in the financial markets at home and abroad,\nand take such monetary and administrative actions as may be considered necessary from time\nto time.\n17.An important development in regard to balance of payments outlook is the substantial\nincrease in the price of crude oil and petroleum products in the last six months. Crude oil\nprices have increased from US $ 16.71 per barrel at the beginning of April 1999 to US $\n22.95 per barrel at the end of September 1999. On the whole, the current expectation is that\ndespite the effect of increase in oil prices, the current account deficit in 1999-2000 will still\nbe below 2 per cent of GDP in view of the encouraging developments in respect of invisibles,\nparticularly private remittances and software exports.\n18.An important area of concern for the management of the balance of payments\ncontinues to be that of exports. Partly because of slowdown in the world economy and also\nthe East Asian economic crisis, exports in 1998-99 declined by 3.9 per cent in US dollar\nterms. There is some evidence of pick up in exports during the first five months of the current\nyear when exports grew by 4.6 per cent in US dollar terms. It is necessary that this\nmomentum is kept up. In the previous year, several measures for improving the delivery of\nexport credit in foreign currency to exporters at internationally competitive interest rates\n(with a maximum spread of 1.5 per cent over the LIBOR) were initiated. Some measures\nwere also announced in the April 1999 Statement in order to ensure the timely availability of\nexport credit and remove procedural hassles. These measures included provision of \u2018On Line\ncredit\u2019 to exporters, extension of \u2018Line of Credit\u2019 for longer duration for exporters with good\ntrack record, peak/non-peak credit facilities to exporters, permission for interchangeability of\npre-shipment and post-shipment credit and meeting the term loan requirements of exporters\nfor expansion of capacity and modernisation of machinery and upgradation of technology.\nImprovements have also been made in the procedure for handling of export documents and\nfast track clearance of export credit at specialised branches of banks. In August 1998, the\nReserve Bank issued new simplified guidelines for sanction of credit facilities for software\nservices, project services and software products and packages.\n19.In order to improve the delivery of export credit, the Reserve Bank has set up a\nBankers Group at the operational level (comprising senior officials from commercial banks\nand the Reserve Bank). So far, the Group has held 22 meetings with Chief Executives of\nmajor banks and also held parallel interactive sessions with the exporters as also base-level\nofficials of the commercial banks at 14 major export centres in the country in addition to\ndiscussions with industry associations. Based on the deliberations in these meetings, the\nReserve Bank has issued further guidelines to banks relating to simplification of application\nforms in respect of medium and small exporters and deployment of trained and experienced\nstaff in branches dealing with export finance. The experience seems to have proved useful in\nimproving credit delivery to exporters.\n20.In addition to foreign currency credit, exporters also have access to rupee credit at a\nconcessional rate of 10 per cent per annum at present. The six month forward premium on\nsales of export proceeds has generally ranged between 5 and 6 per cent per annum in the last\nsix months. Taking into account the premium available to exporters on forward sales, the cost6of credit in rupee would work out to 4 - 5 per cent per annum, which compares favourably\nwith the prevailing international rates of interest for corporate borrowers.\n21. An important priority of the Government and the Reserve Bank of India is to c reate an\nenvironment which is favourable to investment and strengthening of financial links with the\nnon-resident Indian community abroad. In line with this approach, earlier this year,\nprocedures applicable to operations of bank accounts and financial transactions in India by\nnon-resident individuals of Indian nationality/persons of Indian origin were drastically\nsimplified and a Non-Resident (special) Rupee (NRSR) account was introduced in addition to\nother existing facilities for non-resident Indians. The objective of the measures taken so far is\nto eliminate the need for case by case permission and to provide as far as possible a\n\u2018domestic\u2019 treatment to NRI community (in addition to the special facilities available to them\nin respect of foreign exchange transactions). New measures taken in the recent past include:\n(i) the extension of general permission under the Portfolio Investment Scheme, available to\nindividual NRIs to Overseas Corporate Bodies; (ii) the permission to buy/sell equity\nshares/debentures through brokers under the Portfolio Investment Scheme; and (iii) the\ngeneral permission to purchase shares of Indian companies from other NRIs, PIOs/OCBs.\nWith immediate effect, it is proposed to provide the following further facilities to NRIs\nwithout the need for approval of the Reserve Bank :\n(i) Authorised Dealers may grant rupee loans and overdrafts in India to NRIs against the\nsecurity of shares/securities/ debentures or immovable properties held by such persons\nin India for purposes other than investment.\n \n(ii) General permission to Indian companies for issuing non-convertible debentures by\nway of public issue to NRIs/OCBs on repatriation basis. The Indian companies, for\nsuch issues, need not obtain approval of the Reserve Bank.\n \n(iii) At present, NRIs/PIOs/OCBs are permitted portfolio investments in\nshares/debentures. These permissions by RBI are originally for a period of 5 years\nwhich can be renewed by designated banks. It has now been decided to delegate the\npowers to Authorised Dealers to permit portfolio investment by NRIs/PIOs/OCBs in\nshares/debentures.\n \n22.Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) proposals are approved under the automatic route by\nRBI and under the approvals granted by Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in the\nCentral Government. In order to simplify FDI investment procedures, RBI has granted\ngeneral permission to the Indian companies under the automatic route to receive funds and\nissue shares to their foreign collaborators without approval of RBI. The same benefit has\nbeen extended to foreign investments approved by the FIPB. Thus, in respect of all cases of\nforeign direct investments, which are in line with Government policy, case-by-case approval\nof RBI is no longer required.\nII. Stance of Monetary Policy for the\nSecond Half of 1999-2000\n23.In view of the paramount need to support industrial recovery, the Monetary and Credit\nPolicy Statement in April had stated that \u201cthe current stance of monetary policy will continue\nto be in the direction of facilitating adequate availability of liquidity along with stable\nmedium and long-term interest rates, with policy preference for softening to the extent7circumstances permit.\u201d This stance of monetary policy was already reflected in the measures\nannounced by the Reserve Bank on March 1,1999, when the repo rate was reduced by 2\npercentage points and the Bank Rate and the Cash Reserve Ratio were reduced by 1\npercentage point and 0.50 percentage point, respectively. The Cash Reserve Ratio was further\nreduced by 0.50 percentage point in April 1999. Following the RBI\u2019s measures, banks and\nfinancial institutions also announced their decisions to lower prime lending rates.\n24.In line with the above stance, during the first half of the current financial year, the\nReserve Bank has been closely monitoring the overall liquidity conditions in the market as\nwell as the behaviour of interest rates. So far as liquidity conditions are concerned, by and\nlarge, they have remained generally easy owing inter alia , to growth in bank deposits and the\ncuts in Cash Reserve Ratio announced in March and April 1999. Non-food bank credit has\nalso recorded an increase during this period by Rs.14,802 crore in contrast with an increase of\nRs.8,181 crore during the first half of 1998-99. The increase in investments by banks in\ncommercial paper, bonds/shares/ debentures of PSUs and private corporate sector during this\nperiod, however, showed an increase of about Rs.6,314 crore during April-September 1999\nagainst Rs.9,359 crore in the corresponding period of 1998-99.\n25.There has been  a reduction in yields and interest rates on Government securities and\nCertificates of Deposit in the first half of the current year. So far as the Government securities\nare concerned, the yields have fallen by 46 basis points for 10-year paper in October 1999\ncompared with the yields in March 1999. The discount rates on Certificates of Deposit have\ndeclined from 10.00 per cent to 8.50 per cent for three months maturity and from 12.50 per\ncent to 11.00 per cent for one year maturity, between April and early September, 1999. There\nwas also a decline in prime lending rates of public sector banks from the range of 12.75 \u2013\n14.50 per cent at the end of February 1999 to 12.00 \u2013 13.50 per cent in October 1999.\n26.While liquidity conditions have generally been eas y, overnight call money rates have\ntended to be firm during the first half of the year compared with the position in the\ncorresponding period of last year. The fortnightly average rates were in the region of 7.7 to\n9.9 per cent for the most part as compared with 6.1 to 9.8 per cent last year. Part of the reason\nfor this may be attributed to the pick-up in demand for credit and greater opportunities for\ninvestments in medium and long-term paper. (In the first fortnight of October 1999, however,\ncall money rates, shot up to a high of 20.0 per cent for a few days mainly because of\nmiscalculation of CRR requirements by some banks and low level of lending by major\nlenders in the call market.)\n27.The hardening of short-term interest rates was also reflected in a n increase in the cut-\noff yields on Treasury Bills. The yields on 91-day and 364-day Treasury Bills showed an\nincrease during the first half of the current financial year of about 46 basis points and 75 basis\npoints respectively, over the corresponding period of last year. On the whole, while liquidity\nconditions have been comfortable and medium and long-term rates have tended to soften,\nthere has been some pressure at the shorter end of the yield curve.\n28.In order to cool down the pressures on call mon ey market during the first half of\nOctober, the Reserve Bank opened a purchase window for Treasury bills as part of its open\nmarket operations. It is the intention of RBI to continue with this practice as and when\nconsidered necessary and, over time, to develop a two-way market operations in Treasury\nbills. In due course, with further development of Treasury bills market, such action should8enable RBI to confine its activities to secondary market operations in Treasury bills,\nobviating the need for any devolvement in primary auctions.\n29.In view of the decline in inflation rates in the past few months, and a relatively\nfavourable outlook for the year as a whole, there is a case for a further downward movement\nin the structure of interest rates. The Reserve Bank has already indicated its policy preference\nfor softening of interest rates to the extent circumstances permit. It, however, needs to be\nstressed once again that prime lending rates of banks for commercial credit are entirely within\nthe purview of the banks and are no longer set by the Reserve Bank. The interest rates which\nare subject to regulation are only the rate of interest on savings accounts (which is 4.5 per\ncent), and rates of interest on export credit and credit for small and tiny sectors, including\nDRI schemes, up to an amount of Rs. 2 lakh. Decisions in regard to interest rates, therefore,\nhave to be taken by banks themselves in the light of various factors, including their own cost\nof funds, their transaction costs, and interest rates ruling in the non-banking sector, etc.\n30.While greater flexibility in interest rates is a most desirable objective, it has to be\nrecognised that banks face several structural and other constraints. Among these are:\n\u2022 For the public sector banks, the average cost of funds is in the region of 8 per cent. The\nnon-interest operating expenses work out to 2.5 to 3.0 per cent of total assets, putting\npressure on the required spread over cost of funds leading to high lending rates.\nRelatively high overhang of NPAs together with interest tax pushes further the lending\nrates.\n\u2022 Banks do have the freedom to offer variable interest rates on longer term deposits.\nHowever, the preference of depositors for as well as the traditional practice with banks is\nto offer fixed interest rates on term deposits. The effect of this practice is to reduce the\nflexibility that banks have in lowering their lending rates since the rates on the existing\nstock of deposits cannot be lowered.\n\u2022 There is persistent and large volume of market borrowing requirements by the\nGovernment giving an upward bias to the entire interest rate structure.\n\u2022 Interest rates on contractual savings like Provident Fund, National Savings Scheme are\nsubstantially higher than long-term deposit rates of banks. Provident Fund rates are\ngenerally in the region of 12 per cent and National Savings Scheme rate on 4-year\ndeposits is 11 per cent as compared with the bank deposit rate of 10-12 per cent for\nsimilar maturity. Similarly, private sector mutual funds offer a much higher rate of\ninterest than those offered by banks on their term deposits. Compared to bank deposits,\nmany of the other saving schemes and mutual funds carry larger tax benefits.\n\u2022 The level of CRR continues to be high in view of the need to control the overall\nexpansion of liquidity in the system. A high level of CRR also raises the average cost of\nfunds for banks.\n31.From the short-term and long-term points of view, in the context of financial sector\nderegulation and industrial liberalisation, priority needs to be given to removing some of the\nabove constraints so that the interest rate structure can be made more flexible during different\nphases of the business cycle. An important policy priority of the Reserve Bank, Government\nas well as banks must be to undertake concrete steps in this direction as early as possible.932.As mentioned in the April Statement, the Bank Rate and short-term repo rate have\nbeen increasingly perceived by the markets as signals for movements in market rates of\ninterest, particularly call money rates. The changes in CRR have served as one of the\nimportant instruments for regulating liquidity, and have been effective in meeting the short-\nterm challenges in domestic money and forex markets. The Interim Liquidity Adjustment\nFacility has also helped in keeping the money market rates range bound. The medium/long-\nterm objective of monetary policy will continue to be in reducing the average level of CRR,\nwhile in the short-term it could be varied in both directions depending on the behaviour of\nmonetary indicators.\n33.With the use of multiple indicator approach, the position in the financial markets will\ncontinue to be assessed by movements in money market interest rates, exchange rate, foreign\nexchange reserves, credit to Government and commercial sector and fiscal position of the\nGovernment besides real sector developments. Constant efforts are being made to explore the\nrelationships among different sectors of the economy through a short-term operational model\nwhich will also be useful in understanding the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.\nIn this respect, the estimates of the new monetary aggregates (based on the recommendations\nof the Working Group on `Money Supply: Analytics and Methodology of Compilation\u2019),\nboth from the component and sources side, compiled and released in the October issue of RBI\nBulletin are likely to be helpful.\n34.Apart from price stability, central banks all over the world also accord importance to\nfinancial stability as a policy objective. RBI has been making continuous efforts towards\nstrengthening financial soundness by prescribing capital adequacy norms of banks and\nfinancial institutions, advising improvements in asset classification and accounting systems\nand establishing best practice norms for income recognition and provisioning against\nexposures faced by them. Following the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee II,\nthe RBI had, in October 1998, announced , inter alia , a range of specific prudential norms for\nbanks which have since been progressively implemented. The thrust in this direction was\ncarried forward in the April 1999 Statement enabling banks not only to adopt prudent\naccounting standards but also to allow some measure of freedom in managing loan accounts,\nand operation of ALM guidelines for financial institutions. Moving further from the gains of\nALM system, banks are encouraged to put in place comprehensive risk management systems\nto take care of credit risk, market risk and operational risk. After holding consultations with\nbanks, RBI has recently provided detailed guidelines in this regard. RBI also places utmost\nimportance on the quality and standards of supervision which have been progressively refined\nunder the dispensation of the Board for Financial Supervision (BFS) ever since its\nestablishment. Sustained reforms in this area during the last few years have significantly\nimproved the outlook with respect to overall financial sector stability in India. RBI would\ncontinue to review the position with regard to the issues integral to the maintenance of\nfinancial stability in the future.\n35.The Bank\u2019s overall stance of policy for 1999-2000 would continue to be : provision of\nreasonable liquidity; stable interest rates with preference for softening to the extent possible\nwithin the existing operational and structural constraints; orderly development of financial\nmarkets and ensuring financial stability.\nIII. Financial Sector Reforms and\nMonetary Policy Measures10Monetary and Credit Policy Measures\n36.In the light of the mac ro-economic and monetary policy developments reviewed in the\nprevious sections, it is proposed to make the following changes in policy :\n(i) The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) maintained by the scheduled commercial banks is\nbeing reduced by one percentage point from the present level of 10 per cent to 9 per\ncent in two instalments, the first, effective the fortnight beginning November 6, 1999\nand the next, effective the fortnight beginning November 20, 1999. This will increase\nthe lendable resources of banks by Rs.7,000 crore.\n \n(ii) In order to improve the cash management by banks, as a measure of simplification, it\nhas been decided to introduce a lag of two weeks in the maintenance of stipulated\nCRR by banks. This change in the procedure for calculation of reserve maintenance\nwill be effective from the fortnight beginning November 6, 1999.\n \n(iii) The interest rate surcharge of 30 per cent on import finance, which has been in force\nsince January 1998, is being withdrawn with immediate effect. This will reduce the\nfinancing cost of imports for industry.\n(iv) At present, banks are required to charge a minimum rate of 20 per cent interest on\noverdue export bills. This stipulation is also being withdrawn with immediate effect,\nand banks will henceforth have the freedom to decide the appropriate rate of interest\non overdue export bills. However, the present procedures for ensuring that there is no\ndeliberate attempt to delay repatriation of export receipts will remain in force.\n \n(v) In line with the policy of minimising the country\u2019s short-term external borrowing\nliabilities, the minimum maturity for FCNR(B) deposits is being raised to one year\nfrom six months. Banks, however, will continue to have the freedom to offer floating\nrate deposits (with a maturity of one year or more, and interest reset period of six\nmonths). At the same time, the requirement by banks to maintain an incremental CRR\nof 10 per cent on increase in liabilities under FCNR(B) Scheme (over the level\nprevailing as on April 11, 1997) is being withdrawn, with effect from the fortnight\nbeginning November 6, 1999. This will increase the lendable resources of banks by\nRs.1,061 crore.\n37.As emphasised in the earlier Policy Statements, it is reiterated that the above\nmeasures, including the level of the CRR to be maintained by banks, are subject to change\nfrom time to time.\n38.In the last few years, following the Reports of high level Committees (such as the\nNarasimham Committee) and various technical groups and working groups, the Reserve\nBank has announced a number of measures for the development and reform of the financial\nsector, including money and debt markets. An attempt is made here to review the\ndevelopment in respect of certain measures announced in April 1999 with a view to bring\nabout modifications where necessary.\nInterim Liquidity Adjustment Facility (ILAF)1139.This facility, announced in the April Statement, has provided a mechanism for\ninjection and absorption of liquidity available with banks from time to time. The ILAF is\noperated through a combination of repo, export credit refinance, collateralised lending\nfacilities and open market operations. The experience in operating this facility in the last six\nmonths has generally been satisfactory and substantial use has been made of export credit\nrefinance and collateralised lending facilities under this scheme in order to overcome\nmismatches in the supply and demand for liquid funds. The fortnightly average utilisation\nunder this facility including export credit refinance has ranged between Rs.4,119 crore and\nRs.7,697 crore during April-October 1999. Primary dealers also availed of liquidity support\nin the range of Rs.1,293 crore and Rs.7,406 crore during the same period. In the light of the\nfeedback received from the market participants, in the first week of this month, the scheme\nwas made more flexible by removing the requirement of `cooling period\u2019 (after the use of this\nfacility by banks for two blocks of two weeks each). The operation of this facility will be kept\nunder constant review and further refined in consultation with participants.\nMoney Market\n40.An important step announced in April 1999 in the direction of development of the\nmoney market was the introduction of rupee derivative products (Forward Rate\nAgreements/Interest Rate Swaps). The guidelines issued in this respect have been widely\nwelcomed by the market participants and at present the notional principal amount of\noutstanding of FRAs/IRS is around Rs.1,700 crore. It is expected that the volumes in the\nmarket will pick up over time, once banks and institutions complete the documentation\nformalities.\n41.The April statement announced certain facilities for enabling non-bank participants to\ndeploy their short-term resources in the repo market and for development of Money Market\nMutual Funds (MMMFs). After a review of the working of the measures announced in April,\nthe following modifications/measures are being introduced in the operation of various money\nmarket schemes :\n(i) It was indicated in the April 1999 policy statement that the permission given to non-\nbank entities to lend in the call/notice money market by routing their call/notice\nmoney market operations through primary dealers will be available only upto end-\nDecember 1999. On a review, it has been decided to extend this facility upto end-June\n2000.\n(ii) Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs) which exclusively invest in money market\ninstruments are governed by the MMMF guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of\nIndia. On a review, it is felt that from the angle of a consistent policy with regard to\ninvestor protection, it would be desirable to bring the MMMFs under the umbrella of\nSEBI Regulations, like other Mutual Funds. Accordingly, henceforth, MMMFs will\ncome within the purview of SEBI Regulations. Once SEBI Regulatory framework for\nMMMFs is in place, RBI would withdraw its guidelines and advise banks/financial\ninstitutions that in future, MMMFs would be governed by SEBI regulations.\nHowever, banks and financial institutions desirous of setting up MMMFs will have to\nseek necessary clearance from RBI for undertaking this additional activity before\napproaching SEBI for registration.12(iii) At present, Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs) can be set up either\ndepartmentally in the form of a Money Market Deposit Account (MMDA), or as a\nseparate entity, viz., a \u2018Trust\u2019. For operational convenience, it has been decided to\nhenceforth allow MMMFs to be set up as a separate entity in the form of a \u2018Trust\u2019\nonly. As the banks to whom \u2018in-principle\u2019 approvals were already given have not so\nfar operationalised MMDAs, RBI proposes to withdraw the permission already\ngranted after consulting them.\n(iv) It has been decided to permit scheduled commercial banks to offer \u2018cheque writing\u2019\nfacility to Gilt Funds and to those Liquid Income schemes of mutual funds which\npredominantly invest in money market instruments (not less than 80 per cent of their\ncorpus) subject to the same safeguards prescribed for Money Market Mutual Funds.\nOperating guidelines to banks are being issued separately.\n(v) With a view to providing further flexibility in the use of FRAs/IRS, it has been\ndecided to permit mutual funds, in addition to corporates, to undertake FRAs/IRS\nwith banks, primary dealers and financial institutions for the purpose of hedging their\nown balance sheet risks. Mutual funds cannot, however, undertake market making in\nFRAs/IRS.\n(vi) With a view to facilitating flow of information and transparency in the functioning of\nmoney markets, Reserve Bank proposes to work out in consultation with market\nparticipants, modalities of releasing on a daily basis, data on volume and rates in call\nmoney market as well as some other relevant data. This will enable market\nparticipants to gauge liquidity conditions more effectively and contribute to smooth\nfunctioning of the short-term markets, in particular the call/notice money market.\nGovernment Securities Market\n42.On the basis of announcements made in the April policy, the following measures have\nbeen taken with the objective of improving depth and liquidity in the government securities\nmarket :\n\u2022 Price based auction of government dated securities.\n\u2022 Auction of 182 day Treasury Bills.\n\u2022 A calendar of Treasury Bills issuance.\n\u2022 Availment of ways and means advances by State Governments against collateral\nof Treasury Bills, in addition to Government of India dated securities.\n\u2022 Minimum bidding commitment of Primary Dealers (PDs) to cover 100 per cent of\nnotified amounts in Treasury Bills auctions.\n\u2022 Underwriting of dated securities issues by PDs upto 100 per cent of the notified\namounts.\n\u2022 Entry of non-banking entities in the two way repos market.\n43.These measures have generally been received well by the market participants and are\nworking satisfactorily. The following action is in progress to further strengthen the\ndevelopment of the market:13\u2022 In regard to developing the retail market segment, a Working Group is being\nconstituted to analyse all related aspects of retailing government securities and\nmake recommendations for improving the retail segment of the market.\n\u2022 An Internal Working Group has been constituted to go into various aspects\nrelating to two-way operations by RBI in the Treasury Bills market.\n\u2022 Arrangements relating to clearing corporation are under consideration which will\npave the way for opening the repo market to PSU bonds and bonds of FIs held in\ndemat form in depositories and traded in recognised stock exchanges with\nessential safeguards. As a part of this, detailed guidelines to widen further the\nnumber of participants in the repos market through exchange traded repos with\nadequate safeguards to manage risks will also be finalised.\n\u2022 It has been decided to publicise gilt instruments through informative pamphlets.\n\u2022 It has been decided to advise PDs that they should have self-imposed reasonable\nleverage ratios with the consent of their Board of Directors.\nReview of Norms Relating to\nPrime Lending Rates\n44.Currently,  loans upto Rs.2 lakh carry the prescription of \u2018not exceeding PLR\u2019 and on\nloans above Rs.2 lakh, the PLR is the minimum lending rate. A set of measures was\nannounced in the April Statement to provide more operational flexibility to banks in the\napplicability of PLR. Keeping in view the suggestions received from banks and other market\nparticipants, the existing PLR norms have been further reviewed and it has been decided that\nbanks will be given the freedom to charge interest rates without reference to PLR, in respect\nof the following categories :\n\u2022 Loans covered by refinancing schemes of term lending institutions.\n\u2022 Lending to intermediary agencies.\n\u2022 Discounting of bills.\n\u2022 Advances/Overdraft against domestic/NRE/FCNR(B) deposits.\nThe present position and the proposed changes are indicated in the Annexure I.\nPrudential Norms\n45.In order to strengthen the financial system, an important priority in the past few years\nhas been to introduce appropriate norms in respect of capital adequacy, income recognition\nand provisioning. An attempt has also been made to move towards full disclosure,\ntransparency and effective supervision of banking operations in line with international best\npractices. It is expected that effective implementation of measures in these areas would help\nin not only strengthening the financial sector but also providing support to the growth of the\nreal economy. As further steps in these directions, the following measures are being notified:\n(i) In the Mid-term Statement on Monetary and Credit Policy for 1998-99, a risk weight\nof 2.5 per cent was introduced for the risk arising out of market price variations for\ninvestments in government and other approved securities, with effect from the year\nending March 31, 2000. In view of the growing share of investments in the assets of\nbanks, the risk weight of 2.5 per cent is being extended to cover all investments\nincluding securities outside the SLR. This, however, will take effect from the year\nending March 31, 2001.14(ii) As of now, a bank's exposure to an individual borrower is subject to a prudential\nceiling of 25 per cent of the bank's capital funds. The In-House Working Group\nconstituted by the Reserve Bank in 1998 to review the present exposure norms, had\nrecommended moving closer to the international standard of 15 per cent, in phases.\nAccordingly, it has been decided to lower the exposure ceiling in respect of an\nindividual borrower from the present level of 25 per cent to 20 per cent of the bank's\ncapital funds effective April 1, 2000. Where the existing level of exposure as on\nOctober 31, 1999, is more than 20 per cent, banks would be expected to reduce the\nexposure to 20 per cent of capital funds over a two year period (i.e., by end October,\n2001).\nValuation of Investments\nin Approved Securities\n46.It was announced as part of the April Statement that with effect from the year ending\nMarch 31, 2000, banks will have to classify a minimum of 75 per cent of their investments in\nGovernment and other approved securities as `Current Investments\u2019. An `Informal Group on\nValuation of Banks\u2019 Investments Portfolio\u2019, set up by the Reserve Bank, has recently studied\nall aspects relating to valuation of investments in the light of international practices and has\nrecommended that banks may classify their investments into three categories viz., `Held for\nTrading\u2019, `Available for Sale\u2019 and `Permanent\u2019. The Group has suggested norms for\nclassification as also changes in accounting procedures. The Group has also recommended\nfor discontinuation of the RBI\u2019s practice of prescribing year end YTMs for valuation\npurposes. The summary of Group\u2019s recommendations is provided in Annexure II. The\nGroup\u2019s report will be circulated among banks for comments and also placed before the\nBoard for Financial Supervision for advice. Thereafter, a final decision will be taken on the\nprocedure for valuation of investments with effect from April 1, 2000.\nCredit Delivery\n47.Banks and financial institutions have been entrusted with special responsi bilities for\nproviding credit on reasonable terms to certain sectors, particularly, agriculture, exports,\nmicro-credit institutions, small-scale industries and housing. In addition to improving the\nterms and volume of assistance to these sectors, an important priority is to improve and\nsimplify procedures, reduce documentation requirements and decentralise decision making to\nbranch levels. Surveys have shown that simplification and decentralisation of credit delivery\nmechanisms are just as important in improving access to credit as preferential interest rates or\npolicy directives. The Reserve Bank has held review meetings with the Chief Executives of\nbanks to ensure that simplified procedures are actually being implemented at the ground\nlevel. It is proposed to hold such review meetings at regular intervals, and to encourage banks\nto set up internal systems to ensure effective implementation of simplified procedures.\n48.Another area where banks and financial institutions can play an important role is that\nof infrastructure financing. After extensive consultation, RBI introduced in April, 1999 new\nguidelines to accelerate credit disbursement in infrastructure. These guidelines addressed\nimportant aspects relating to the financing of infrastructure projects, such as, the criteria for\nfinancing, the types of financing, the appraisal, the regulatory compliance/ concerns, the\nadministrative arrangements and the inter-institutional guarantees, among others. Financing\nof infrastructure projects is characterised by large capital costs, long gestation period and15high leverage ratios. In order to facilitate free flow of credit to infrastructure projects, several\npolicy measures have already been effected by RBI. The stipulation regarding the ceiling on\nthe quantum of term loans which can be granted by banks for a single project (Rs.1,000 crore\nfor power projects and Rs.500 crore for other projects) has been dispensed with; banks can\nnow sanction term loans to infrastructure projects within the overall ceiling of the prudential\nexposure norms. Subject to certain safeguards, banks are also permitted to exceed the group\nexposure norm of 50 per cent, to the extent of 10 per cent, provided the additional exposure is\nfor the purpose of financing infrastructure projects. It is proposed to review the operation of\nthese new guidelines after one year of operation (i.e., May, 2000), and make such changes as\nmay be required to promote further financing of infrastructure.\n49.In order to facilitate co-ordination and resolution of iss ues relating to projects assisted\njointly by banks and development financial institutions, a Standing Co-ordination Committee\nhas now been set up by the Industrial Development Bank of India. It is expected that this\nCommittee will help in improving co-ordination and reducing delays in providing credit to\ninfrastructure and other sectors.\nHousing Finance\n50.Banks have an important role to play in providing credit to the housing sector in\nconsonance with the National Housing Policy. From time to time, new measures have been\nannounced to increase the flow of bank finance to this sector. At present, banks are required\nto allocate towards housing finance to the extent of 3 per cent of incremental deposits. With a\nview to providing more flexibility to banks to increase the flow of credit, directly and\nindirectly through intermediary agencies including Housing and Urban Development\nCorporation and National Housing Bank, some changes in the norms for determining the\nhousing finance allocation by banks are being introduced. Details are provided in Annexure\nIII.\nMicro Credit\n51.As indicated in the April Policy Statement, Micro Credit Institutions and Self Help\nGroups (SHGs) are important vehicles for generation of income and delivery of credit to self\nemployed persons, particularly women, in rural and semi-urban areas. Banks have since been\nadvised to include flow of micro credit in their corporate strategy/plan and to review the\nprogress on a quarterly basis. As announced in the April statement, RBI has set up a special\nMicro Credit Cell to review the ground realities and in consultation with NABARD and\nreputed micro-credit institutions, suggest measures to remove any remaining policy and\nprocedural bottlenecks for \u201cmainstreaming micro credit\u201d. The objective is to accelerate the\nflow of bank credit to micro finance institutions without jeopardising their decentralised,\nvoluntary and non-bureaucratic character. The Cell is expected to complete its field work,\nand submit findings, within a year. A high level Task Force on Supportive Policy and\nRegulatory Framework for Micro Finance set up by NABARD has also recently submitted its\nreport to NABARD. The recommendations made by the Task Force are being processed by\nNABARD in consultation with RBI and Government as appropriate.\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)\n52.RBI has instituted a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory framework for the\nNBFC sector in January 1998, pursuant to the amendments effected to the Reserve Bank of16India Act, 1934. As part of the consultative process, RBI has constituted an Informal\nAdvisory Group consisting of representatives of the NBFC sector. While helping orderly\ngrowth of this important sector, steps are also being taken to increase investors\u2019 awareness of\ntheir own responsibility in regard to investments made by them. Considering the large\nnumber of NBFCs functioning, their geographical distribution and their diversified activities,\nRBI has been keen to promote the concept of self regulatory organisation among NBFCs,\nparticularly for smaller NBFCs, and discussions with industry are continuing. A Committee\nconstituted by the Bank to suggest formats of balance sheet with adequate disclosures has\nalso submitted its report. The Reserve Bank proposes to introduce these formats and\ndisclosure norms as recommended by the Committee after getting the views of the industry\nand the Department of Company Affairs of the Government of India.\n53.The registration process for larger NBFCs envisaged under the Act is now more or\nless complete. Of 10,486 applications of NBFCs which were prima facie eligible, registration\nhas been granted to 7,855 NBFCs, out of which 624 NBFCs have been permitted to accept\npublic deposits. Further, applications of 1,167 companies have been rejected for registration\nas on August 31, 1999. In addition, as many as 26,904 companies with Net Owned Funds\n(NOF) below Rs.25 lakh have been given time under the RBI Act upto January 8, 2000 to\nachieve the minimum level of Rs.25 lakh. All NBFCs in this category should strictly adhere\nto the above time limit. RBI may not in the normal course, grant extension of time to those\nNBFCs which have not attained the prescribed minimum NOF of Rs.25 lakh by the stipulated\ndate and accordingly their applications may not be considered for registration.\n54.The following further measures in respect of NBFC sector are being notified with\nimmediate effect :\n(i) The borrowings from mutual funds presently come within the purview of public\ndeposits as described in the Direction on Acceptance of Public Deposits. It has been\ndecided that borrowings from mutual funds would be excluded from the definition of\npublic deposits.\n(ii) NBFCs should give public notice of 3 months in leading newspapers before they\ndecide to close a branch or before effecting sale or transfer of ownership.\nDeposit Insurance\n55.India is a pioneer in introducing deposit insurance. However, subsequent\ndevelopments in the financial sector as a whole have resulted in a review of deposit insurance\nsystems in many countries. The approaches include private insurance, differentiated premia,\nvoluntary insurance, separation of insurance from regulatory/supervisory bodies, extending\ninsurance to non-banks, etc. A Working Group was constituted in the RBI to review the role\nof deposit insurance in India. The Group conducted a detailed survey of the nature of deposit\ninsurance in India with regard to instruments, institutions and regulatory framework,\nincluding a review of the international experience in this regard. The Group has\nrecommended changes in the existing system in regard to deposit coverage, institutions to be\nbrought within the ambit of deposit insurance, regulatory systems to be put in place, risk-\nbased premium, the parameters relevant for assessment of risk and ownership and capital of\ndeposit insurance agency. The Report is being released for wider public discussion.\nRegulations Review Authority (RRA)1756.In April 1999, the RBI had set up a Regulations Review Authority (RRA) with a view\nto reviewing any procedural regulation or requirement of RBI which was not considered\nnecessary or relevant by banks, market participants, foreign investors, NRIs, Indian citizens\nand experts. Since its inception, RRA has so far received 150 applications covering more than\n200 suggestions relating to various operational areas of the Bank. Of this, nearly 50 per cent,\ncovering about 115 suggestions have been disposed of and the remaining are at various stages\nof processing. Some of the procedural suggestions accepted for implementation are (i) doing\naway with the requirement of sample test checking of freshly printed MICR cheques, (ii)\nfreedom to banks in fixation of service charges, (iii) displaying of information on NBFCs\nregistered, (iv) changes in the structure of MMMFs, (v) arrangements for greater\ndissemination of information to public, and (vi) procedure for quicker dissemination on FIIs\u2019\ninvestment limits. The RRA has also set up a number of technical groups with membership\nfrom both within and outside the Bank, to review and recommend changes in the current\npractices pertaining to regulation, documentation and reporting. \nYear 2000 (Y2K) Preparations\n57.The Reserve Bank has been closely monitoring the Year 2000 (Y2K) readiness in the\nfinancial sector so that business continuity is assured. The MICR cheque clearing systems at\nthe Reserve Bank have been replaced by the state of the art Y2K compliant systems. The\nsystems are already in operation in Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi and will soon go on stream\nin Calcutta and thus become fully operational in the metropolitan cities. All the 103\ncommercial banks and their 40 subsidiaries have confirmed Y2K readiness as at the end of\nAugust, 1999. Besides, all the Issue Offices of the Reserve Bank and currency chests at\ncommercially important cities have been asked to store adequate quantities of cash in order to\nmeet any sudden increase in demand. In line with the international practices, all banks shall\nremain closed for public transactions on January 1, 2000.\n58.To enable the banking system to tide over the  century date change liquidity needs, a\ncontingency plan has been put in place including the following measures :\nSpecial Liquidity Support\n(i) With a view to enabling the banks to meet any unanticipated additional demand for\nliquidity in the context of the century date change, it has been decided to introduce a\n\u2018Special Liquidity Support\u2019 for the period December 1, 1999 to January 31, 2000.\nUnder the \u2018Special Liquidity Support\u2019, banks will be eligible to avail of liquidity\nunder Section 17(4)(a) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 to the extent of their\nexcess holdings of dated Government of India Securities/Treasury Bills over the\nStatutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) required to be maintained. The rate of interest on this\nfacility will be 2.5 percentage points over the Bank Rate. This facility will be in\naddition to the collateralised lending facility (CLF and ACLF) and export credit\nrefinance facility provided to all scheduled commercial banks, at present. Banks not\nholding significantly higher amounts of Government of India securities beyond that\nindicated by the required SLR are encouraged to have standby arrangement for\nliquidity support with those banks which are eligible for Special Liquidity Support.\nDetailed operating guidelines will be issued separately.\nFlexibility in the treatment of CRR18(ii) Normally, banks maintain minimum cash in their own vaults since it is an idle asset,\nwithout the benefit of earning any interest. In the context of date change at the turn of\nthe century, in order to meet any additional demand for bank notes as a contingency,\nbanks may have to keep larger vault cash for meeting their business transactions. At\npresent, such cash in hand with the bank though an eligible asset for SLR, is not\ncounted for CRR requirements. To facilitate banks to tide over the contingency during\nthe millennium change, it has been decided to treat cash in hand maintained by the\nbanks for compliance of CRR for a limited period of two months commencing from\nDecember 1,1999 to January 31,2000. It is clarified here that the cash in hand which\nwill be counted for CRR purposes, during the above period cannot be treated as\neligible asset for SLR purposes simultaneously.\n(iii) As already indicated, for operational convenience, the maintenance of CRR by banks\nis being lagged by two weeks. As such, for maintaining CRR during the fortnight\nbeginning January 1, 2000, the NDTL base would be December 17, 1999. With the\nleverage of two weeks available, banks should not have any problem in complying\nwith the CRR requirement around the century date change. Nevertheless, any bank\nthat expects a special problem in meeting its CRR obligations at the end of the year\ncan approach the RBI for appropriate relaxation/assistance.\nContingency Funding Line\nfrom Head Offices Abroad\n(iv) Some banks have desired to put in place a contingency funding line from their head\noffices abroad to meet liquidity problems if any, arising during the century date\nchange. As per the extant stipulations, repayments of borrowings from abroad by\nbanks (i.e., authorised dealers), is allowed only if they have no outstanding\nborrowings either from the RBI or other bank/financial institution in India and are\nclear of all money market borrowings for a period of at least four weeks before the\nrepayment. It has been decided to temporarily permit foreign banks to bring in Head\nOffice funds and repatriate such funds during the period of two months from\nDecember 1, 1999 to January 31, 2000 without the above restriction.\nReserve Bank of India,\nMumbai,\nOctober 29, 1999\nAnnexure I\nModifications in norms relating to Prime Lending Rates (PLR)\nSr.\nNo.Subject Present position Proposed Changes191.Interest rates on\nloans granted by\nbanks for which\nrefinance has\nbeen obtained\nfrom term\nlending\ninstitutionsSubject to PLR norms. Banks would be given\nthe freedom to charge\nlending rates on loans\ncovered by refinance, as\nper stipulations of the\nrefinancing agencies.\n2.Interest rates on\nbank lending to\nintermediary\nagencies\nincluding\nhousing finance\nintermediary\nagencies.Intermediary agencies are\nprovided bank credit presently at\na fixed rate of 1.5 percentage\npoints less than PLR of\nrespective banks for credit limits\nover Rs.2 lakh. Bank lending to\nhousing finance intermediary\nagencies is subject to the\nstipulation that the interest rate\nshould be below the PLR. Where\nthe loans are routed through\nPrimary Agricultural Credit\nSocieties (PACS)/ Large\nAdivasis Multipurpose Societies\n(LAMPS)/ Farmers Service\nSocieties (FSS) the rate of\ninterest to be charged by banks is\ncurrently 1.5 per cent lower than\nrates to the ultimate borrowers in\nthe case of advances of over\nRs.25,000 and upto Rs.2 lakh\nand for credit limits above Rs.2\nlakh the rate is 1.5 percentage\npoints below the appropriate\nPLR.Banks will have\nfreedom to charge\ninterest rates for lending\nto intermediary agencies\nwithout reference to\nPLR.\n3.Bill discounting\nby banksThe effective rate of interest on\ndiscounting of bills for\nborrowers over Rs.2 lakh should\nbe subject to  PLR.Bill discounting by\nbanks will be outside\nthe purview of PLR\nnorms.\n4.Interest rate on\nadvances/over\ndrafts against\nDomestic/NRE/\nFCNR(B)\ndepositsIn cases where deposit rates are\nequal to or more than PLR or\nless than one percentage point\nbelow PLR, the banks  have\nfreedom to charge suitable rates\nof interest on advances against\ndomestic/ NRE term deposits\nwithout reference to the ceiling\nof PLR. Rupee loans against\nNRE deposits to depositors are\ncharged at less than PLR if the\nloans are repaid in foreign\ncurrency whereas loans andBanks are free to charge\ninterest rates on loans\nagainst\ndomestic/NRE/FCNR(B\n) deposits, without\nreference to PLR.20overdraft against FCNR(B)\ndeposits are subject to PLR\nnorms.\nAnnexure \u2013 II\nSummary of the recommendations of the Informal Group\non Valuation of Banks\u2019 Investments Portfolio\n1.Banks may classify their entire investments in Government and other \u201capproved\u201d\nsecurities under three categories viz. \u201cHeld for Trading\u201d, \u201cAvailable for sale\u201d and\n\u201cpermanent\u201d.    The \u201cpermanent\u201d component should not exceed 25 per cent of total\ninvestment in approved securities.  However, banks have the freedom to classify the entire\ninvestment portfolio in Government and other \u201capproved\u201d securities as \u201cHeld for Trading\u201d or\n\u201cAvailable for sale\u201d.\n2.Securities classified in \u201cHeld  for Trading\u201d category should be marked to market on a\nmonthly if not more frequent basis.  While the depreciation should be recognised in the\nIncome Account, appreciation, if any, being unrealised, should be appropriated to the\n\u201cInvestment Fluctuation Reserve\u201d through Income Account.\n3.Securities in \u201cAvailable for sale\u201d category should also be marked to market at the year\nend or at more frequent intervals as decided by the Board of Directors.  The gain or loss on\nrevaluation may be taken to the Investment Fluctuation Reserve Account without routing\nthrough the income account.  In the event that balance in the reserve account is insufficient,\nprovision for depreciation should be made in the income account.  In the event of\nsale/realisation of any investment from this category, the actual amount realised may be\nrecognised in the income account.\n4.Securities held in \u201cpermanent\u201d category can be carried at cost unless it was more than\nthe face value, in which case the premium has to be amortised over the period remaining for\nmaturity of the security.\n5.Banks can shift investments from one category to the other only with the approval of\nthe Board of Directors.\n6.As Government securities across a wide maturity spectrum are traded and market\nprices are available, RBI need not prescribe financial year-end YTM.  Banks may refer to the\nprices available in SGL transactions, NSE trades/quotes, price list of RBI at the year-end and\nvalue the securities to the satisfaction of auditors.\n7. RBI  also need not prescr ibe the methodology for valuation of all the non-approved\nsecurities comprising PSU bonds and non-PSU bonds and debentures and they could be\nvalued at \u201cfair value\u201d by individual banks taking the yield spread between the sovereign yield\nand the yield on the concerned bonds/similar bonds into consideration.\n8.All the recommendations made above could be made applicable to all banks including\nnew private sector banks.21Annexure III\nHousing Finance \u2013 Changes in Norms\nPresent Position Change\nDirect housing loans only upto Rs.5 lakh in\nall the areas, i.e., rural/semi-urban and\nurban/metropolitan areas, are treated as\npriority sector advances.In Urban and Metropolitan areas, the limit\nwill be Rs.10 lakh.\nLoans extended by banks to housing\nintermediary agencies are reckoned as part\nof housing finance allocation provided the\nloan per borrower by such intermediary\nagencies does not exceed Rs.5 lakh in\nrural/semi-urban areas and  Rs.10 lakh in\nurban/metropolitan areas.All indirect housing loans extended by\nbanks to these agencies against the loans\nsanctioned by them will be reckoned as\npart of housing finance allocation.\nThe investment in bonds issued by\nNational Housing Bank/Housing and\nUrban Development Corporation\nexclusively for financing of housing is\nreckoned for inclusion under priority sector\nadvances, provided the loan size per\ndwelling unit does not exceed Rs.5 lakh.All the investment in bonds issued by\nNational Housing Bank/Housing and\nUrban Development Corporation\nexclusively for financing of housing\nirrespective of the loan size per dwelling\nunit will be reckoned for inclusion under\npriority sector advances.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/9653.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 27, 1999", "info": "A.D.

No. Y2K.BC/ 12 /35.01.00/99-2000\nOctober 18, 1999\nThe Chairman/ Managing Director/ Chief Executive\nAll Commercial Banks\nDear Sir:\nYear 2000 (Y2K) Issues \u2013 Setting up of Event Management Centres (EMC) and\nTransition Arrangements\nThe feedback received from commercial banks in regard to Year 2000 compliance efforts\nindicates comfortable levels of preparedness. Reports received from banks also indicate that\nthey are currently engaged in strengthening and validating their contingency plans and\ndovetailing these plans with visible systemic support measures of the Reserve Bank aimed at\neasing uncertainties associated with Year 2000 transition.\nAs the demand for information before, during and after the century date change will be\ntremendous, it is important to consider and develop and have effective Year 2000 Event\nManagement and communication strategies as part of the overall arrangements for the\nmillennium transition. Apart from sustaining public confidence through information\ndissemination, which is essential for stability and business continuity, such arrangements are\nalso essential for efficient resolution of any problems that may develop during the transition\nperiod.\nAll commercial banks are therefore advised to set up Event Management Centres at their\nHead Offices, Regional Centres as well as all their computerised branches. A broad\nframework and guidance in regard to Year 2000 event management and necessary\narrangements for the transition are as follows:\nCore Principles: A set of Core Principles, which could possibly serve as a guiding\nframework in regard to the processes for event management include:\n\u2022 Each bank is directly responsible for preparing for the Year 2000 date change,\nincluding event management and actions needed to minimize risks to the industry as a\nwhole.\n\u2022 The chances of success are greatly enhanced by leveraging off existing channels of\ncommunication between firms, exchanges and supervisors.\n\u2022 It is important to disclose actual status information through out the event period\n\u2022 There should be close coordination between individual firms and their respective\nsupervisors.\nEvent Management : Event Management structures and processes in the context of the Year\n2000 problem should essentially relate to internal and external communications,establishment of communications centres (Event Management Command Centres),\nescalation of information flows, status reporting and responsive decision making mechanism .\nAs far as possible existing processes, structures and channels should be the basis for local\nand cross-border Event Management activities .\nEvent Management Architecture:\nEvent Management Centres were successfully employed by organisations in several\ncountries to manage the conversion process during the introduction of the Euro. While the\nprecise role and scope of an Event Management Centre will vary depending on the size and\ncomplexity of an organisation, they are generally expected to provide direction through\ndecision making and communication. Event Management Centres are required at the\ninstitutional level and the market regulators level with appropriate linkages with their Local\nand National Governments and regulators in other countries. National and market level\nentities may prefer to concentrate on communication issues between utilities, market\ninfrastructure providers, other regulators and banks and financial institutions.\nBased on the directions provided by the High Level Working Group (Chairman: Shri S.P.\nTalwar, Deputy Governor) at its meeting held on October 6, 1999 event management\nstructures have been conceptualised keeping in view the need for to provide for greater\ndecentralisation and quicker decision making responses. Accordingly, a Central Event\nManagement Centre (CEMC) will be set up at the Central Office of the RBI and Regional\nEvent Management Centres (REMC) at each of its Regional Offices. Similarly all banks and\nfinancial institutions may set up Institutional Event Management Centres (IEMC) at their\nHead Offices/ Principal Offices, Event Management Centres (EMC) at Regional Office and\nLocal Event Management Centres (LEMC) at each of its computerised branches. While\nbanks would be encouraged to identify contact personnel for Year 2000 contact and provide\nsolutions at the local level, as far as possible the local clearing houses can serve as the focal\npoint for such local level contacts and problem resolution exercise.\nAs the demand for information before, during and after the century date change will be\ntremendous , an important consideration while defining links and channels for\ncommunication would be the need to predefine the data structures and direction of\ninformation flows. This is essential for ensuring that communication channels do not get\nclogged/ inter-twined due to all participants trying to contact the same source of information\nat the same time or criss-crossing communication lines. A schematic presentation of the\nEvent Management Architecture is attached ( Annexure I & II)The following issues will have to addressed in this regard:\n(i)  Setting up of Event Management Centres :\n\u2022 location, facilities, staffing requirements, security, command/ communication structure\nand rehearsals (familiarization).\n\u2022 infrastructure arrangements at the event management centres should essentially consist of\nalternate telecommunication channels, vehicles and sustenance arrangements for staff\nmanning these centres depending on their size and relative importance.\n It is important that each institution makes its own assessment in regard to the infrastructure\nrequirements for the EMC and expeditiously arranges for setting up the same.\n(ii) Responsibilities of banks and other institutions:\n\u2022 Set up Event Management Centres at their Head Offices, Regional Offices and at each\nof its computerised locations by December 15, 1999.\n\u2022 Identify core staff who will man these IEMC and EMCs. As far as possible the\ncontact persons for Y2K already communicated to the Y2K Project Cell and circulated\namong banks and FIs would continue to be contact points for communication between\nthe CEMC and the IEMC of each bank.\n\u2022 The EMCs would be manned continuously for all 24 hours each day by rotation of\nearmarked core staff from December 27, 1999 to January 7, 2000 and from February 28,\n2000 to March 7, 2000.\n\u2022 Identify and establish communication channels for information sharing and decision\nmaking with the REMC of the Reserve Bank in respect of regional issues.\n\u2022 The EMCs can be dismantled after the annual closing of accounts on April 1, 2000 if\nthere are no issues outstanding for resolution.\nEach EMC would be expected to serve as a focal point for management of event through\neffective communication and decision making. In particular the EMCs may be required to:\n\u2022 Compile a database of contact persons for reporting , decision making and trouble\nshooting.\n\u2022 Make arrangements to disseminate correct information to the public at the local levels in\nthe event of enquiries or rumors.\n\u2022 Report to the REMC/ CEMC by exception  of any Year 2000 issues or rumours within\ntheir area of operation.\n(iii)  Role of the CEMC at RBI, Central Office:\nThe CEMC at the Central Office of the Reserve Bank would primarily function as a\nclearinghouse for information for the banking and financial sector during the transition. The\nCEMC would provide feedback to the Government, other supervisory bodies and also liaison\nwith infrastructure providers at the macro level. The CEMC would also provide cross-market\nassessments of the scenario as it emerges and promote accurate understanding of overall\nconditions in order to foster public confidence.\n(iv) Co-ordination with CEMC (RBI):\nChannels of communication between the CEMC, REMC and the EMCs of banks would have\nto be identified and communicated among each other well before December 15, 1999. The\npattern and direction of flow of information streams would be on the lines depicted in theEvent Management Architecture. Contact persons at each communication junction should be\nfamiliar with the event management work stream and have a rapport with their counterparts\nboth upstream as well as downstream.\nStatus Reporting:\nThe EMC at the principal office of each bank will be expected to report to the CEMC/ Y2K\nProject Cell and the REMC of any Y2K induced disruptions or related issues right from\nDecember 15, 1999 when the EMC would be operational. For the sake of efficiency,\nreporting may be by exception only  and focus on material events relating to business and\npayment/ settlement process.\nHowever, all banks and Financial Institutions will be expected to send a first report by noon\nof January 1, 2000 regarding problems or glitches, if any to the Y2K Project Cell by fax or\nphone. The fax numbers to which reports are to be sent may be at the Department of Banking\nSupervision and/ or Department of Information Technology. While successful functionality\nmay need no elaboration, glitches may have to be indicated in a brief way in this first report.\nA detailed report on abnormality in system performance, if any, during the transition may be\ncommunicated by fax/ e-mail as at the close of business on January 3, 2000. In case no\nabnormality was observed, a confirmation to the effect may be sent as in the case of the first\nreport.\nIn view of the enormity of the logistics involved, the absence of precedence and the need to\nput in place transition arrangements expeditiously, regional meetings will be scheduled at\nmajor centres with all local banks so that arrangements are clearly understood and effective\nco-ordination achieved.\nReserve Bank would welcome suggestions for further improvement to the transition\narrangements and particularly in regard to setting up of event management centres.\nM. R. Srinivasan\nChief General Manager\nEncl: as above", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/9539.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 21, 1999", "info": "Risk Management Systems in Banks\nIntroduction\nBanks in the process of financial intermediation are confronted with various kinds of financial\nand non-financial risks viz., credit, interest rate, foreign exchange rate, liquidity, equity price,\ncommodity price, legal, regulatory, reputational, operational, etc. These risks are highly\ninterdependent and events that affect one area of risk can have ramifications for a range of other\nrisk categories. Thus, top management of banks should attach considerable importance to\nimprove the ability to identify, measure, monitor and control the overall level of risks\nundertaken.\nThe broad parameters of risk management function should encompass:\ni) organisational structure;\nii) comprehensive risk measurement approach;\niii) risk management policies approved by the Board which should be consistent with the\nbroader business strategies, capital strength, management expertise and overall\nwillingness to assume risk;\niv) guidelines and other parameters used to govern risk taking including detailed structure of\nprudential limits;\nv) strong MIS for reporting, monitoring and controlling risks;\nvi) well laid out procedures, effective control and comprehensive risk reporting framework;\nvii) separate risk management framework independent of operational Departments and with\nclear delineation of levels of responsibility for management of  risk;  and\nviii) periodical review and evaluation.\n2.   Risk Management Structure\n2.1 A major issue in establishing an appropriate risk management organisation structure is\nchoosing between a centralised and decentralised structure .  The global trend is towards\ncentralising risk management with integrated treasury management function to benefit from\ninformation on aggregate exposure, natural netting of exposures, economies of scale and easier\nreporting to top management. The primary responsibility of understanding the risks run by the\nbank and ensuring that the risks are appropriately managed should clearly be vested with the\nBoard of Directors .  The Board should set risk limits by assessing the bank\u2019s risk and risk-\nbearing capacity. At organisational level, overall risk management should be assigned to an\nindependent Risk Management Committee or Executive Committee of the top Executives that\nreports directly to the Board of Directors. The purpose of this top level committee is to empower\none group with full responsibility of evaluating overall risks faced by the bank and determining\nthe level of risks which will be in the best interest of the bank. At the same time, the Committee\nshould hold the line management more accountable for the risks under their control, and the\nperformance of the bank in that area .  The functions of Risk Management Committee should\nessentially be to identify, monitor and measure the risk profile of the bank .  The Committee\nshould also develop policies and procedures, verify the models that are used for pricing complex\nproducts, review the risk models as development takes place in the markets and also identify new\nrisks.  The risk policies should clearly spell out the quantitative prudential limits on various\nsegments of banks\u2019 operations .  Internationally, the trend is towards assigning risk limits in terms\nof portfolio standards or Credit at Risk (credit risk) and Earnings at Risk and Value at Risk\n(market risk). The Committee should design stress scenarios to measure the impact of unusual2\nmarket conditions and monitor variance between the actual volatility of portfolio value and that\npredicted by the risk measures. The Committee should also monitor compliance of various risk\nparameters by operating Departments.\n2.2  A prerequisite for establishment of an effective risk management system is the existence of a\nrobust MIS, consistent in quality.  The existing MIS, however, requires substantial upgradation\nand strengthening of the data collection machinery to ensure the integrity and reliability of data.\n2.3  The risk management is a complex function and it requires specialised skills and expertise.\nBanks have been moving towards the use of sophisticated models for measuring and managing\nrisks. Large banks and those operating in international markets should develop internal risk\nmanagement models to be able to compete effectively with their competitors .  As the domestic\nmarket integrates with the international markets, the banks should have necessary expertise and\nskill in managing various types of risks in a scientific manner. At a more sophisticated level, the\ncore staff at Head Offices should be trained in risk modelling and analytical tools .  It should,\ntherefore, be the endeavour of all banks to upgrade the skills of staff.\n2.4  Given the diversity of balance sheet profile, it is difficult to adopt a uniform framework for\nmanagement of risks in India.  The design of risk management functions should be bank specific,\ndictated by the size, complexity of functions, the level of technical expertise and the quality of\nMIS.  The proposed guidelines only provide broad parameters and each bank may evolve their\nown systems compatible to their risk management architecture and expertise.\n2.5  Internationally, a committee approach to risk management is being adopted.  While the\nAsset - Liability Management Committee (ALCO) deal with different types of market risk, the\nCredit Policy Committee (CPC) oversees the credit / counterparty risk and country risk .  Thus,\nmarket and credit risks are managed in a parallel two-track approach in banks .  Banks could also\nset-up a single Committee for integrated management of credit and market risks. Generally, the\npolicies and procedures for market risk are articulated in the ALM policies and credit risk is\naddressed in Loan Policies and Procedures.\n2.6  Currently, while market variables are held constant for quantifying credit risk, credit\nvariables are held constant in estimating market risk. The economic crises in some of the\ncountries have revealed a strong correlation between unhedged market risk and credit risk .\nForex exposures, assumed by corporates who have no natural hedges, will increase the credit\nrisk which banks run vis-\u00e0-vis their counterparties. The volatility in the prices of collateral also\nsignificantly affects the quality of the loan book. Thus, there is a need for integration of the\nactivities of both the ALCO and the CPC and consultation process should be established to\nevaluate the impact of market and credit risks on the financial strength of banks. Banks may also\nconsider integrating market risk elements into their credit risk assessment process.\n3. Credit Risk\n3.1 General\n3.1.1  Lending involves a number of risks. In addition to the risks related to creditworthiness of\nthe counterparty, the banks are also exposed to interest rate, forex and country risks.\n3.1.2  Credit risk or default risk involves inability or unwillingness of a customer or counterparty\nto meet commitments in relation to lending, trading, hedging, settlement and other financial3\ntransactions. The Credit Risk is generally made up of transaction risk or default risk and\nportfolio risk .  The portfolio risk in turn comprises intrinsic and concentration risk .  The credit\nrisk of a bank\u2019s portfolio depends on both external and internal factors .  The external factors are\nthe state of the economy, wide swings in commodity/equity prices, foreign exchange rates and\ninterest rates, trade restrictions, economic sanctions, Government policies, etc. The internal\nfactors are deficiencies in loan policies/administration, absence of prudential credit concentration\nlimits, inadequately defined lending limits for Loan Officers/Credit Committees, deficiencies in\nappraisal of borrowers\u2019 financial position, excessive dependence on collaterals and inadequate\nrisk pricing, absence of loan review mechanism and post sanction surveillance, etc.\n3.1.3  Another variant of credit risk is counterparty risk. The counterparty risk arises from non-\nperformance of the trading partners .  The non-performance may arise from counterparty\u2019s\nrefusal/inability to perform due to adverse price movements or from external constraints that\nwere not anticipated by the principal. The counterparty risk is generally viewed as a transient\nfinancial risk associated with trading rather than standard credit risk.\n3.1.4  The management of credit risk should receive the top management\u2019s attention and the\nprocess should encompass:\na) Measurement of  risk through credit rating/scoring;\nb) Quantifying the risk through estimating expected loan losses i.e. the amount of loan losses\nthat bank would experience over a chosen time horizon (through tracking portfolio behaviour\nover 5 or more years) and unexpected loan losses i.e. the amount by which actual losses\nexceed the expected loss (through standard deviation of losses or the difference between\nexpected loan losses and some selected target credit loss quantile);\nc) Risk pricing on a scientific basis; and\nd) Controlling the risk through effective Loan Review Mechanism and portfolio management.\n3.1.5  The credit risk management process should be articulated in the bank\u2019s Loan Policy, duly\napproved by the Board. Each bank should constitute a high level Credit Policy  Committee , also\ncalled Credit Risk Management Committee or Credit Control Committee etc. to deal with issues\nrelating to credit policy and procedures and to analyse, manage and control credit risk on a bank\nwide basis. The Committee should be headed by the Chairman/CEO/ED, and should comprise\nheads of Credit Department, Treasury, Credit Risk Management Department (CRMD ) and the\nChief Economist. The Committee should, inter alia, formulate clear policies on standards for\npresentation of credit proposals, financial covenants, rating standards and benchmarks,\ndelegation of credit approving powers, prudential limits on large credit exposures, asset\nconcentrations, standards for loan collateral, portfolio management, loan review mechanism, risk\nconcentrations, risk monitoring and evaluation, pricing of loans, provisioning, regulatory/legal\ncompliance, etc. Concurrently, each bank should also set up Credit Risk Management\nDepartment (CRMD), independent of the Credit Administration Department. The CRMD should\nenforce and monitor compliance of the risk parameters and prudential limits set by the CPC. The\nCRMD should also lay down risk assessment systems, monitor quality of loan portfolio, identify\nproblems and correct deficiencies, develop MIS and undertake loan review/audit. Large banks\nmay consider separate set up for loan review/audit. The CRMD should also be made accountable\nfor protecting the quality of the entire loan portfolio .  The Department should undertake\nportfolio evaluations and conduct comprehensive studies on the environment to test the\nresilience of the loan portfolio.4\n3.2  Instruments of Credit Risk Management\nCredit Risk Management encompasses a host of management techniques, which help the banks\nin mitigating the adverse impacts of credit risk.\n3.2.1  Credit Approving Authority\nEach bank should have a carefully formulated scheme of delegation of powers .  The banks\nshould also evolve multi-tier credit approving system where the loan proposals are approved by\nan \u2018Approval Grid\u2019 or a \u2018Committee\u2019. The credit facilities above a specified limit may be\napproved by the \u2018Grid\u2019 or \u2018Committee\u2019, comprising at least 3 or 4 officers and invariably one\nofficer should represent the CRMD, who has no volume and profit targets .  Banks can also\nconsider credit approving committees at various operating levels i.e. large branches (where\nconsidered necessary), Regional Offices, Zonal Offices, Head Offices, etc. Banks could consider\ndelegating powers for sanction of higher limits to the \u2018Approval Grid\u2019 or the \u2018Committee\u2019 for\nbetter rated / quality customers .  The spirit of the credit approving system may be that no credit\nproposals should be approved or recommended to higher authorities, if majority members of the\n\u2018Approval Grid\u2019 or \u2018Committee\u2019 do not agree on the creditworthiness of the borrower. In case of\ndisagreement, the specific views of the dissenting member/s should be recorded.\nThe banks should also evolve suitable framework for reporting and evaluating the quality\nof credit decisions taken by various functional groups. The quality of credit decisions should be\nevaluated within a reasonable time, say 3 \u2013 6 months, through a well-defined Loan Review\nMechanism.\n3.2.2  Prudential Limits\nIn order to limit the magnitude of credit risk, prudential limits should be laid down on various\naspects of credit:\na) stipulate benchmark current/debt equity and profitability ratios, debt service coverage ratio\nor other ratios, with flexibility for deviations.  The conditions subject to which deviations\nare permitted and the  authority  therefor should also be clearly spelt out in the Loan\nPolicy;\nb) single/group borrower limits, which may be lower than the limits prescribed by Reserve\nBank to provide a filtering mechanism;\nc) substantial exposure limit i.e. sum total of exposures assumed in respect of those single\nborrowers enjoying credit facilities in excess of a threshold limit, say 10% or 15% of\ncapital funds.  The substantial exposure  limit may be fixed at 600% or 800%  of capital\nfunds, depending upon the degree of concentration risk the bank is exposed;\nd) maximum exposure limits to industry,  sector, etc. should be set up.  There must also be\nsystems in place to evaluate the exposures at reasonable intervals and the limits should be\nadjusted especially when a particular sector or industry faces slowdown or other\nsector/industry specific problems .  The exposure limits to sensitive sectors, such as,\nadvances against equity shares, real estate, etc., which are subject to a high degree of asset\nprice volatility and to specific industries, which are subject to frequent business cycles,\nmay necessarily be restricted. Similarly, high-risk industries, as perceived by the bank,5\nshould also be placed under lower portfolio limit. Any excess exposure should be fully\nbacked by adequate collaterals or strategic considerations; and\ne) banks may consider maturity profile of the loan book, keeping in view the market risks\ninherent in the balance sheet, risk evaluation capability, liquidity, etc.\n3.2.3   Risk Rating\nBanks should have a comprehensive risk scoring / rating system that serves as a single point\nindicator of diverse risk factors of a counterparty and for taking credit decisions in a consistent\nmanner.  To facilitate this, a substantial degree of standardisation is required in ratings across\nborrowers .  The risk rating system should be designed to reveal the overall risk of lending,\ncritical input for setting pricing and non-price terms of loans as also present meaningful\ninformation for review and management of loan portfolio .  The risk rating, in short, should\nreflect the underlying credit risk of the loan book. The rating exercise should also facilitate the\ncredit granting authorities some comfort in its knowledge of loan quality at any moment of time.\nThe risk rating system should be drawn up in a structured manner, incorporating, inter\nalia, financial analysis, projections and sensitivity, industrial and management risks .  The banks\nmay use any number of financial ratios and operational parameters and collaterals as also\nqualitative aspects of management and industry characteristics that have bearings on the\ncreditworthiness of borrowers .  Banks can also weigh the ratios on the basis of the years to\nwhich they represent for giving importance to near term developments. Within the rating\nframework, banks can also prescribe certain level of standards or critical parameters, beyond\nwhich no proposals should be entertained. Banks may also consider separate rating framework\nfor large corporate / small borrowers, traders, etc. that exhibit varying nature and degree of risk .\nForex exposures assumed by corporates who have no natural hedges have significantly altered\nthe risk profile of banks .  Banks should, therefore, factor the unhedged market risk exposures of\nborrowers also in the rating framework. The overall score for risk is to be placed on a numerical\nscale ranging between 1-6, 1-8, etc. on the basis of credit quality .  For each numerical category, a\nquantitative definition of the borrower, the loan\u2019s underlying quality, and an analytic\nrepresentation of the underlying financials of the borrower should be presented. Further, as a\nprudent risk management policy, each bank should prescribe the minimum rating below which\nno exposures would be undertaken. Any flexibility in the minimum standards and conditions for\nrelaxation and authority therefor should be clearly articulated in the Loan Policy.\nThe credit risk assessment exercise should be repeated biannually (or even at shorter\nintervals for low quality customers) and should be delinked invariably from the regular renewal\nexercise .  The updating of the credit ratings should be undertaken normally at quarterly intervals\nor at least at half-yearly intervals, in order to gauge the quality of the portfolio at periodic\nintervals .  Variations in the ratings of borrowers over time indicate changes in credit quality and\nexpected loan losses from the credit portfolio .  Thus, if the rating system is to be meaningful, the\ncredit quality reports should signal changes in expected loan losses. In order to ensure the\nconsistency and accuracy of internal ratings, the responsibility for setting or confirming such\nratings should vest with the Loan Review function and examined by an independent Loan\nReview Group. The banks should undertake comprehensive study on migration (upward \u2013 lower\nto higher and downward \u2013 higher to lower) of borrowers in the ratings to add accuracy in\nexpected loan loss calculations.6\n3.2.4   Risk Pricing\nRisk-return pricing is a fundamental tenet of risk management .  In a risk-return setting,\nborrowers with weak financial position and hence placed in high credit risk category should be\npriced high. Thus, banks should evolve scientific systems to price the credit risk, which should\nhave a bearing on the expected probability of default .  The pricing of loans normally should be\nlinked to risk rating or credit quality .  The probability of default could be derived from the past\nbehaviour of the loan portfolio, which is the function of loan loss provision/charge offs for the\nlast five years or so .  Banks should build historical database on the portfolio quality and\nprovisioning / charge off to equip themselves to price the risk. But value of collateral, market\nforces, perceived value of accounts , future business potential, portfolio/industry exposure and\nstrategic reasons may also play important role in pricing. Flexibility should also be made for\nrevising the price (risk premia) due to changes in rating / value of collaterals over time .  Large\nsized banks across the world have already put in place Risk Adjusted Return on Capital\n(RAROC) framework for pricing of loans, which calls for data on portfolio behaviour and\nallocation of capital commensurate with credit risk inherent in loan proposals. Under RAROC\nframework, lender begins by charging an interest mark-up to cover the expected loss \u2013 expected\ndefault rate of the rating category of the borrower. The lender then allocates enough capital to\nthe prospective loan to cover some amount of unexpected loss- variability of default rates.\nGenerally, international banks allocate enough capital so that the expected loan loss reserve or\nprovision plus allocated capital covers 99% of the loan loss outcomes.\nThere is, however, a need for comparing the prices quoted by competitors for borrowers\nperched on the same rating /quality .  Thus, any attempt at price-cutting for market share would\nresult in mispricing of risk and \u2018Adverse Selection\u2019.\n3.2.5 Portfolio Management\nThe existing framework of tracking the Non Performing Loans around the balance sheet date\ndoes not signal the quality of the entire Loan Book .  Banks should evolve proper systems for\nidentification of credit weaknesses well in advance .  Most of international banks have adopted\nvarious portfolio management techniques for gauging asset quality. The CRMD, set up at Head\nOffice should be assigned the responsibility of periodic monitoring of the portfolio. The\nportfolio quality could be evaluated by tracking the migration (upward or downward) of\nborrowers from one rating scale to another .  This process would be meaningful only if the\nborrower-wise ratings are updated at quarterly / half-yearly intervals. Data on movements within\ngrading categories provide a useful insight into the nature and composition of loan book.\nThe banks could also consider the following measures to maintain the portfolio quality:\n1) stipulate quantitative ceiling on aggregate exposure in specified rating categories, i.e. certain\npercentage of total advances should be in the rating category of 1 to 2 or 1 to 3, 2 to 4 or 4 to\n5, etc.;\n2) evaluate the rating-wise distribution of borrowers in various industry, business segments,\netc.;\n3) exposure to one industry/sector should be evaluated on the basis of overall rating distribution\nof borrowers in the sector/group. In this context, banks should weigh the pros and cons of\nspecialisation and concentration by industry group .  In cases where portfolio exposure to a7\nsingle industry is badly performing, the banks may increase the quality standards for that\nspecific industry;\n4) target rating-wise volume of loans, probable defaults and provisioning requirements as a\nprudent planning exercise. For any deviation/s from the expected parameters, an exercise for\nrestructuring of the portfolio should immediately be undertaken and if necessary, the entry-\nlevel criteria could be enhanced to insulate the portfolio from further deterioration;\n5) undertake rapid portfolio reviews, stress tests and scenario analysis when external\nenvironment undergoes rapid changes (e.g. volatility in the forex market, economic\nsanctions, changes in the fiscal/monetary policies, general slowdown of the economy, market\nrisk events, extreme liquidity conditions, etc.).  The stress tests would reveal undetected areas\nof potential credit risk exposure and linkages between different categories of risk. In adverse\ncircumstances, there may be substantial correlation of various risks, especially credit and\nmarket risks .  Stress testing can range from relatively simple alterations in assumptions about\none or more financial, structural or economic variables to the use of highly sophisticated\nmodels.  The output of such portfolio-wide stress tests should be reviewed by the Board and\nsuitable changes may be made in prudential risk limits for protecting the quality .  Stress tests\ncould also include contingency plans, detailing management responses to stressful situations.\n6) introduce discriminatory time schedules for renewal of borrower limits. Lower rated\nborrowers whose financials show signs of problems should be subjected to renewal control\ntwice/thrice an year.\nBanks should evolve suitable framework for monitoring the market risks especially forex risk\nexposure of corporates who have no natural hedges on a regular basis. Banks should also appoint\nPortfolio Managers to watch the loan portfolio\u2019s degree of concentrations and exposure to\ncounterparties .  For comprehensive evaluation of customer exposure, banks may consider\nappointing Relationship Managers to ensure that overall exposure to a single borrower is\nmonitored, captured and controlled .  The Relationship Managers have to work in coordination\nwith the Treasury and Forex Departments. The Relationship Managers may service mainly high\nvalue loans so that a substantial share of the loan portfolio, which can alter the risk profile,\nwould be under constant surveillance. Further, transactions with affiliated companies/groups\nneed to be aggregated and maintained close to real time. The banks should also put in place\nformalised systems for identification of accounts showing pronounced credit weaknesses well in\nadvance and also prepare internal guidelines for such an exercise and set time frame for deciding\ncourses of action.\nMany of the international banks have adopted credit risk models for evaluation of credit\nportfolio. The credit risk models offer banks framework for examining credit risk exposures,\nacross geographical locations and product lines in a timely manner, centralising data and\nanalysing marginal and absolute contributions to risk .  The models also provide estimates of\ncredit risk (unexpected loss) which reflect individual portfolio composition. The Altman\u2019s Z\nScore forecasts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a 12-month period .  The\nmodel combines five financial ratios using reported accounting information and equity values to\nproduce an objective measure of borrower\u2019s financial health. J. P. Morgan has developed a\nportfolio model \u2018 CreditMetrics\u2019  for evaluating credit risk. The model basically focus on\nestimating the volatility in the value of assets caused by variations in the quality of assets .  The\nvolatility is computed by tracking the probability that the borrower might migrate from one\nrating category to another (downgrade or upgrade) .  Thus, the value of loans can change over\ntime, reflecting migration of the borrowers to a different risk-rating grade .  The model can be\nused for promoting transparency in credit risk, establishing benchmark for credit risk8\nmeasurement and estimating economic capital for credit risk under RAROC framework. Credit\nSuisse developed a statistical method for measuring and accounting for credit risk which is\nknown as CreditRisk+. The model is based on actuarial calculation of expected default rates and\nunexpected losses from default.\nThe banks may evaluate the utility of these models with suitable modifications to Indian\nenvironment for fine-tuning the credit risk management .  The success of credit risk models\nimpinges on time series data on historical loan loss rates and other model variables, spanning\nmultiple credit cycles .  Banks may, therefore, endeavour building adequate database for\nswitching over to credit risk modelling after a specified period of time.\n3.2.6  Loan Review Mechanism (LRM)\nLRM is an effective tool for constantly evaluating the quality of loan book and to bring about\nqualitative improvements in credit administration. Banks should, therefore, put in place proper\nLoan Review Mechanism for large value accounts with responsibilities assigned in various areas\nsuch as, evaluating the effectiveness of loan administration, maintaining the integrity of credit\ngrading process, assessing the loan loss provision, portfolio quality, etc .  The complexity and\nscope of LRM normally vary based on banks\u2019 size, type of operations and management practices .\nIt may be independent of the CRMD or even separate Department in large banks.\nThe main objectives of LRM could be:\n\u2022 to identify promptly loans which develop credit weaknesses and initiate timely corrective\naction;\n\u2022 to evaluate portfolio quality and isolate potential problem areas;\n\u2022 to provide information for determining adequacy of loan loss provision;\n\u2022 to assess the adequacy of and adherence to, loan policies and procedures, and to monitor\ncompliance with relevant laws and regulations; and\n\u2022 to provide top management with information on credit administration, including credit\nsanction process, risk evaluation and post-sanction follow-up.\n \n Accurate and timely credit grading is one of the basic components of an effective LRM .  Credit\ngrading involves assessment of credit quality, identification of problem loans, and assignment of\nrisk ratings .  A proper Credit Grading System should support evaluating the portfolio quality and\nestablishing loan loss provisions. Given the importance and subjective nature of credit rating, the\ncredit ratings awarded by Credit Administration Department should be subjected to review by\nLoan Review Officers who are independent of loan administration.\n \n 3.2.7  Banks should formulate Loan Review Policy and it should be reviewed annually by the\nBoard.  The Policy should, inter alia, address:\n \n\u2022 Qualification and Independence\n \n The Loan Review Officers should have sound knowledge in credit appraisal, lending practices\nand loan policies of the bank .  They should also be well versed in the relevant laws/regulations\nthat affect lending activities .  The independence of Loan Review Officers should be ensured and\nthe findings of the reviews should also be reported directly to the Board or Committee of the\nBoard.9\n \n\u2022 Frequency and Scope of Reviews\n \n The Loan Reviews are designed to provide feedback on effectiveness of credit sanction and to\nidentify incipient deterioration in portfolio quality .  Reviews of high value loans should be\nundertaken usually within three months of sanction/renewal or more frequently when factors\nindicate a potential for deterioration in the credit quality .  The scope of the review should cover\nall loans above a cut-off limit .  In addition, banks should also target other accounts that present\nelevated risk characteristics .  At least 30-40% of the portfolio should be subjected to LRM in a\nyear to provide reasonable assurance that all the major credit risks embedded in the balance sheet\nhave been tracked.\n \n\u2022 Depth of Reviews\n \n The loan reviews should focus on:\n\u2022 Approval process;\n\u2022 Accuracy and timeliness of credit ratings  assigned by loan officers;\n\u2022 Adherence to internal policies and procedures, and applicable laws / regulations;\n\u2022 Compliance with loan covenants;\n\u2022 Post-sanction follow-up;\n\u2022 Sufficiency of loan documentation;\n\u2022 Portfolio quality; and\n\u2022 Recommendations for improving portfolio quality\n3.2.8  The findings of Reviews should be discussed with line Managers and the corrective\nactions should be elicited for all deficiencies.  Deficiencies that remain unresolved should be\nreported to top management.\n3.2.9  The Risk Management Group of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has\nreleased a consultative paper on Principles for the Management of Credit Risk.  The Paper deals\nwith various aspects relating to credit risk management .  The Paper is enclosed for information\nof banks.\n4.  Credit Risk and Investment Banking\n4.1 Significant magnitude of credit risk, in addition to market risk, is inherent in investment\nbanking .  The proposals for investments should also be subjected to the same degree of credit\nrisk analysis, as any loan proposals. The proposals should be subjected to detailed appraisal and\nrating framework that factors in financial and non-financial parameters of issuers, sensitivity to\nexternal developments, etc. The maximum exposure to a customer should be bank-wide and\ninclude all exposures assumed by the Credit and Treasury Departments .  The coupon on non-\nsovereign papers should be commensurate with their risk profile. The banks should exercise due\ncaution, particularly in investment proposals, which are not rated and should ensure\ncomprehensive risk evaluation .  There should be greater interaction between Credit and Treasury\nDepartments and the portfolio analysis should also cover the total exposures, including\ninvestments .  The rating migration of the issuers and the consequent diminution in the portfolio\nquality should also be tracked at periodic intervals.10\n4.2 As a matter of prudence, banks should stipulate entry level minimum ratings/quality\nstandards, industry, maturity, duration, issuer-wise, etc. limits in investment proposals as well to\nmitigate the adverse impacts of concentration and the risk of illiquidity.\n5.   Credit Risk in Off-balance Sheet Exposure\n5.1 Banks should evolve adequate framework for managing their exposure in off-balance sheet\nproducts like forex forward contracts, swaps, options, etc. as a part of overall credit to individual\ncustomer relationship and subject to the same credit appraisal, limits and monitoring procedures .\nBanks should classify their off-balance sheet exposures into three broad categories - full risk\n(credit substitutes) - standby letters of credit, money guarantees, etc, medium risk  (not direct\ncredit substitutes, which do not support existing financial obligations) - bid bonds, letters of\ncredit, indemnities and warranties and low risk  - reverse repos, currency swaps, options, futures,\netc.\n5.2  The trading credit exposure to counterparties can be measured on static (constant percentage\nof the notional principal over the life of the transaction) and on a dynamic basis. The total\nexposures to the counterparties on a dynamic basis should be the sum total of:\n1) the current replacement cost ( unrealised loss to the counterparty); and\n2) the potential increase in replacement cost (estimated with the help of VaR or other methods\nto capture future volatilities in the value of the outstanding contracts/ obligations).\nThe current and potential credit exposures may be measured on a daily basis to evaluate the\nimpact of potential changes in market conditions on the value of counterparty positions. The\npotential exposures also may be quantified by subjecting the position to market movements\ninvolving normal and abnormal movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity\nprices, liquidity conditions, etc.\n6.   Inter-bank Exposure and Country Risk\n6.1 A suitable framework should be evolved to provide a centralised overview on the aggregate\nexposure on other banks .  Bank-wise exposure limits could be set on the basis of assessment of\nfinancial performance, operating efficiency, management quality, past experience, etc .  Like\ncorporate clients, banks should also be rated and placed in range of 1-5, 1-8, as the case may be,\non the basis of their credit quality .  The limits so arrived at should be allocated to various\noperating centres and followed up and half-yearly/annual reviews undertaken at a single point.\nRegarding exposure on overseas banks, banks can use the country ratings of international rating\nagencies and classify the countries into low risk, moderate risk and high risk. Banks should\nendeavour for developing an internal matrix that reckons the counterparty and country risks. The\nmaximum exposure should be subjected to adherence of country and bank exposure limits\nalready in place .  While the exposure should at least be monitored on a weekly basis till the\nbanks are equipped to monitor exposures on a real time basis, all exposures to problem countries\nshould be evaluated on a real time basis.\n7.  Market Risk\n7.1 Traditionally, credit risk management was the primary challenge for banks .  With progressive\nderegulation, market risk arising from adverse changes in market variables, such as interest rate,11\nforeign exchange rate, equity price and commodity price has become relatively more important .\nEven a small change in market variables causes substantial changes in income and economic\nvalue of banks. Market risk takes the form of:\n1) Liquidity Risk\n2) Interest Rate Risk\n3) Foreign Exchange Rate ( Forex)  Risk\n4) Commodity Price Risk and\n5) Equity Price Risk\n8.   Market Risk Management\n8.1 Management of market risk should be the major concern of top management of banks .  The\nBoards should clearly articulate market risk management policies, procedures, prudential risk\nlimits, review mechanisms and reporting and auditing systems. The policies should address the\nbank\u2019s exposure on a consolidated basis and clearly articulate the risk measurement systems that\ncapture all material sources of market risk and assess the effects on the bank .  The operating\nprudential limits and the accountability of the line management should also be clearly defined .\nThe Asset-Liability Management Committee (ALCO) should function as the top operational unit\nfor managing the balance sheet within the performance/risk parameters laid down by the Board .\nThe banks should also set up an independent Middle Office  to track the magnitude of market\nrisk on a real time basis. The Middle Office should comprise of experts in market risk\nmanagement, economists, statisticians and general bankers and may be functionally placed\ndirectly under the ALCO .  The Middle Office should also be separated from Treasury\nDepartment and should not be involved in the day to day management of Treasury. The Middle\nOffice should apprise the top management / ALCO / Treasury about adherence to prudential /\nrisk parameters and also aggregate the total market risk exposures assumed by the bank at any\npoint of time.\n8.2    Liquidity Risk\n8.2.1 Liquidity Planning is an important facet of risk management framework in banks .\nLiquidity is the ability to efficiently accommodate deposit and other liability decreases, as well\nas, fund loan portfolio growth and the possible funding of off-balance sheet claims .  A bank has\nadequate liquidity when sufficient funds can be raised, either by increasing liabilities or\nconverting assets, promptly and at a reasonable cost .  It encompasses the potential sale of liquid\nassets and borrowings from money, capital and forex markets .  Thus, liquidity should be\nconsidered as a defence mechanism from losses on fire sale of assets.\n8.2.2 The liquidity risk of banks arises from funding of long-term assets by short-term liabilities,\nthereby making the liabilities subject to rollover or refinancing risk.\n8.2.3  The liquidity risk in banks manifest in different dimensions:\ni) Funding Risk  \u2013 need to replace net outflows due to unanticipated withdrawal/non-\nrenewal of deposits (wholesale and retail);\nii) Time Risk   -  need to compensate for non-receipt of expected inflows of funds, i.e.\nperforming assets turning into non-performing assets; and12\niii) Call Risk   - due to crystallisation of contingent liabilities and unable to undertake\nprofitable business opportunities when desirable.\n8.2.4 The first step towards liquidity management is to put in place an effective liquidity\nmanagement policy, which, inter alia, should spell out the funding strategies, liquidity planning\nunder alternative scenarios, prudential limits, liquidity reporting / reviewing, etc.\n8.2.5 Liquidity measurement is quite a difficult task and can be measured through stock or cash\nflow approaches .  The key ratios, adopted across the banking system are:\ni) Loans to Total Assets\nii) Loans to Core Deposits\niii) Large Liabilities ( minus) Temporary Investments to Earning Assets ( minus)\nTemporary Investments , where large liabilities represent wholesale deposits which are\nmarket sensitive and temporary Investments are those maturing within one year and those\ninvestments which are held in the trading book and are readily sold in the market;\niv) Purchased Funds to Total Assets , where purchased funds include the entire inter-bank\nand other money market borrowings, including Certificate of Deposits and institutional\ndeposits; and\nv) Loan Losses/Net Loans .\n8.2.6 While the liquidity ratios are the ideal indicator of liquidity of banks operating in\ndeveloped financial markets, the ratios do not reveal the intrinsic liquidity profile of Indian\nbanks which are operating generally in an illiquid market .  Experiences show that assets\ncommonly considered as liquid like Government securities, other money market instruments, etc.\nhave limited liquidity as the market and players are unidirectional .  Thus, analysis of liquidity\ninvolves tracking of cash flow mismatches .  For measuring and managing net funding\nrequirements, the use of maturity ladder and calculation of cumulative surplus or deficit of funds\nat selected maturity dates is recommended as a standard tool. The format prescribed by RBI in\nthis regard under ALM System should be adopted for measuring cash flow mismatches at\ndifferent time bands .  The cash flows should be placed in different time bands based on future\nbehaviour of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items .  In other words, banks should have to\nanalyse the behavioural maturity profile of various components of on / off-balance sheet items\non the basis of assumptions and trend analysis supported by time series analysis .  Banks should\nalso undertake variance analysis, at least, once in six months to validate the assumptions .  The\nassumptions should be fine-tuned over a period which facilitate near reality predictions about\nfuture behaviour of on / off-balance sheet items .  Apart from the above cash flows, banks should\nalso track the impact of prepayments of loans, premature closure of deposits and exercise of\noptions built in certain instruments which offer put/call options after specified times. Thus, cash\noutflows can be ranked by the date on which liabilities fall due, the earliest date a liability holder\ncould exercise an early repayment option or the earliest date contingencies could be crystallised.\n8.2.7  The difference between cash inflows and outflows in each time period, the excess or\ndeficit of funds, becomes a starting point for a measure of a bank\u2019s future liquidity surplus or\ndeficit, at a series of points of time. The banks should also consider putting in place certain\nprudential limits to avoid liquidity crisis:\n1. Cap on inter-bank borrowings, especially call borrowings;13\n2. Purchased funds vis-\u00e0-vis liquid assets;\n3. Core deposits vis-\u00e0-vis Core Assets i.e. Cash Reserve Ratio, Liquidity Reserve Ratio and\nLoans;\n4. Duration of liabilities and investment portfolio;\n5. Maximum Cumulative Outflows. Banks should fix cumulative mismatches across all time\nbands;\n6. Commitment Ratio \u2013 track the total commitments given to corporates/banks and other\nfinancial institutions to limit the off-balance sheet exposure;\n7. Swapped Funds Ratio, i.e. extent of Indian Rupees raised out of foreign currency sources.\n8.2.8 Banks should also evolve a system for monitoring high value deposits (other than inter-\nbank deposits) say Rs.1 crore or more to track the volatile liabilities .  Further the cash flows\narising out of contingent liabilities in normal situation and the scope for an increase in cash flows\nduring periods of stress should also be estimated .  It is quite possible that market crisis can\ntrigger substantial increase in the amount of draw downs from cash credit/overdraft accounts,\ncontingent liabilities like letters of credit, etc.\n8.2.9  The liquidity profile of the banks could be analysed on a static basis, wherein the assets\nand liabilities and off-balance sheet items are pegged on a particular day and the behavioural\npattern and the sensitivity of these items to changes in market interest rates and environment are\nduly accounted for.  The banks can also estimate the liquidity profile on a dynamic way by\ngiving due importance to:\n1) Seasonal pattern of deposits/loans;\n2) Potential liquidity needs for meeting new loan demands, unavailed credit limits, loan policy,\npotential deposit losses, investment obligations, statutory obligations, etc.\n8.2.10   Alternative Scenarios\nThe liquidity profile of banks depends on the market conditions, which influence the cash flow\nbehaviour .  Thus, banks should evaluate liquidity profile under different conditions, viz. normal\nsituation, bank specific crisis and market crisis scenario .  The banks should establish benchmark\nfor normal situation , cash flow profile of on / off balance sheet items and manages net funding\nrequirements.\n8.2.11  Estimating liquidity under bank specific crisis  should provide a worst-case benchmark.\nIt should be assumed that the purchased funds could not be easily rolled over; some of the core\ndeposits could be prematurely closed; a substantial share of assets have turned into non-\nperforming and thus become totally illiquid. These developments would lead to rating down\ngrades and high cost of liquidity. The banks should evolve contingency plans to overcome such\nsituations.\n8.2.12  The market crisis scenario analyses cases of extreme tightening of liquidity conditions\narising out of monetary policy stance of Reserve Bank, general perception about risk profile of\nthe banking system, severe market disruptions, failure of one or more of major players in the\nmarket, financial crisis, contagion, etc. Under this scenario, the rollover of high value customer\ndeposits and purchased funds could extremely be difficult besides flight of volatile deposits /\nliabilities. The banks could also sell their investment with huge discounts, entailing severe\ncapital loss.14\n8.2.13   Contingency Plan\nBanks should prepare Contingency Plans to measure their ability to withstand bank-specific or\nmarket crisis scenario. The blue-print for asset sales, market access, capacity to restructure the\nmaturity and composition of assets and liabilities should be clearly documented and alternative\noptions of funding in the event of bank\u2019s failure to raise liquidity from existing source/s could be\nclearly articulated .  Liquidity from the Reserve Bank, arising out of its refinance window and\ninterim liquidity adjustment facility or as lender of last resort should not be reckoned for\ncontingency plans. Availability of back-up liquidity support in the form of committed lines of\ncredit, reciprocal arrangements, liquidity support from other external sources, liquidity of assets,\netc. should also be clearly established.\n9.   Interest Rate Risk (IRR)\n9.1 The management of Interest Rate Risk should be one of the critical components of market\nrisk management in banks. The regulatory restrictions in the past had greatly reduced many of\nthe risks in the banking system. Deregulation of interest rates has, however, exposed them to the\nadverse impacts of interest rate risk .  The Net Interest Income (NII) or Net Interest Margin\n(NIM) of banks is dependent on the movements of interest rates .  Any mismatches in the cash\nflows (fixed assets or liabilities) or repricing dates (floating assets or liabilities), expose banks\u2019\nNII or NIM to variations .  The earning of assets and the cost of liabilities are now closely related\nto market interest rate volatility.\n9.2  Interest Rate Risk (IRR) refers to potential impact on NII or NIM or Market Value of Equity\n(MVE), caused by unexpected changes in market interest rates.  Interest Rate Risk can take\ndifferent forms:\n9.3   Types of Interest Rate Risk\n9.3.1  Gap or Mismatch Risk:\nA gap or mismatch risk arises from holding assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet items with\ndifferent principal amounts, maturity dates or repricing dates, thereby creating exposure to\nunexpected changes in the level of market interest rates.\n9.3.2 Basis Risk\nMarket interest rates of various instruments seldom change by the same degree during a given\nperiod of time .  The risk that the interest rate of different assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\nitems may change in different magnitude is termed as basis risk. The degree of basis risk is fairly\nhigh in respect of banks that create composite assets out of composite liabilities. The Loan book\nin India is funded out of a composite liability portfolio and is exposed to a considerable degree\nof basis risk. The basis risk is quite visible in volatile interest rate scenarios .  When the variation\nin market interest rate causes the NII to expand, the banks have experienced favourable basis\nshifts and if the interest rate movement causes the NII to contract, the basis has moved against\nthe banks.\n9.3.3   Embedded Option Risk15\nSignificant changes in market interest rates create another source of risk to banks\u2019 profitability\nby encouraging prepayment of cash credit/demand loans/term loans and exercise of call/put\noptions on bonds/debentures and/or premature withdrawal of term deposits before their stated\nmaturities .  The embedded option risk is becoming a reality in India and is experienced in\nvolatile situations. The faster and higher the magnitude of changes in interest rate, the greater\nwill be the embedded option risk to the banks\u2019 NII .  Thus, banks should evolve scientific\ntechniques to estimate the probable embedded options and adjust the Gap statements (Liquidity\nand Interest Rate Sensitivity) to realistically estimate the risk profiles in their balance sheet .\nBanks should also endeavour for stipulating appropriate penalties based on opportunity costs to\nstem the exercise of options, which is always to the disadvantage of banks.\n9.3.4   Yield Curve Risk\nIn a floating interest rate scenario, banks may price their assets and liabilities based on different\nbenchmarks, i.e. TBs yields, fixed deposit rates, call money rates, MIBOR, etc. In case the banks\nuse two different instruments maturing at different time horizon for pricing their assets and\nliabilities, any non-parallel movements in yield curves would affect the NII. The movements in\nyield curve are rather frequent when the economy moves through business cycles .  Thus, banks\nshould evaluate the movement in yield curves and the impact of that on the portfolio values and\nincome.\n9.3.5  Price Risk\nPrice risk occurs when assets are sold before their stated maturities .  In the financial market,\nbond prices and yields are inversely related .  The price risk is closely associated with the trading\nbook, which is created for making profit out of short-term movements in interest rates .  Banks\nwhich have an active trading book should, therefore, formulate policies to limit the portfolio\nsize, holding period, duration, defeasance period, stop loss limits, marking to market, etc.\n9.3.6  Reinvestment Risk\nUncertainty with regard to interest rate at which the future cash flows could be reinvested is\ncalled reinvestment risk .  Any mismatches in cash flows would expose the banks to variations in\nNII as the market interest rates move in different directions.\n9.3.7  Net Interest Position Risk\nThe size of nonpaying liabilities is one of the significant factors contributing towards\nprofitability of banks .  When banks have more earning assets than paying liabilities, interest rate\nrisk arises when the market interest rates adjust downwards. Thus, banks with positive net\ninterest positions will experience a reduction in NII as the market interest rate declines and\nincreases when interest rate rises .  Thus, large float is a natural hedge against the variations in\ninterest rates.\n9.4   Measuring Interest Rate Risk16\n9.4.1   Before interest rate risk could be managed, they should be identified and quantified.\nUnless the quantum of IRR inherent in the balance sheet is identified, it is impossible to measure\nthe degree of risks to which banks are exposed .  It is also equally impossible to develop effective\nrisk management strategies/hedging techniques without being able to understand the correct risk\nposition of banks. The IRR measurement system should address all material sources of interest\nrate risk including gap or mismatch, basis, embedded option, yield curve, price, reinvestment and\nnet interest position risks exposures. The IRR measurement system should also take into account\nthe specific characteristics of each individual interest rate sensitive position and should capture\nin detail the full range of potential movements in interest rates.\n9.4.2  There are different techniques for measurement of interest rate risk, ranging from the\ntraditional Maturity Gap Analysis (to measure the interest rate sensitivity of earnings), Duration\n(to measure interest rate sensitivity of capital), Simulation and Value at Risk.  While these\nmethods highlight different facets of interest rate risk, many banks use them in combination, or\nuse hybrid methods that combine features of all the techniques.\n9.4.3  Generally, the approach towards measurement and hedging of IRR varies with the\nsegmentation of the balance sheet.  In a well functioning risk management system, banks broadly\nposition their balance sheet into Trading and Investment or Banking Books. While the assets in\nthe trading book are held primarily for generating profit on short-term differences in\nprices/yields, the banking book comprises assets and liabilities, which are contracted basically on\naccount of relationship or for steady income and statutory obligations and are generally held till\nmaturity .  Thus, while the price risk is the prime concern of banks in trading book, the earnings\nor economic value changes are the main focus of banking book.\n9.5  Trading Book\nThe top management of banks should lay down policies with regard to volume, maximum\nmaturity, holding period, duration, stop loss, defeasance period, rating standards, etc. for\nclassifying securities in the trading book .  While the securities held in the trading book should\nideally be marked to market on a daily basis, the potential price risk to changes in market risk\nfactors should be estimated through internally developed Value at Risk ( VaR) models .  The VaR\nmethod is employed to assess potential loss that could crystalise on trading position or portfolio\ndue to variations in market interest rates and prices, using a given confidence level, usually 95%\nto 99%, within a defined period of time .  The VaR method should incorporate the market factors\nagainst which the market value of the trading position is exposed .  The top management should\nput in place bank-wide VaR exposure limits to the trading portfolio (including forex and gold\npositions, derivative products, etc.) which is then disaggregated across different desks and\ndepartments. The loss making tolerance level should also be stipulated to ensure that potential\nimpact on earnings is managed within acceptable limits. The potential loss in Present Value\nBasis Points should be matched by the Middle Office on a daily basis vis-\u00e0-vis the prudential\nlimits set by the Board. The advantage of using VaR is that it is comparable across products,\ndesks and Departments and it can be validated through \u2018back testing\u2019. However, VaR models\nrequire the use of extensive historical data to estimate future volatility. VaR model also may not\ngive good results in extreme volatile conditions or outlier events and stress test has to be\nemployed to complement VaR.  The stress tests provide management a view on the potential\nimpact of large size market movements and also attempt to estimate the size of potential losses\ndue to stress events, which occur in the \u2019tails\u2019 of the loss distribution .  Banks may also undertake17\nscenario analysis with specific possible stress situations (recently experienced in some countries)\nby linking hypothetical, simultaneous and related changes in multiple risk factors present in the\ntrading portfolio to determine the impact of moves on the rest of the portfolio .  VaR models\ncould also be modified to reflect liquidity risk differences observed across assets over time.\nInternational banks are now estimating Liquidity adjusted Value at Risk ( LaVaR) by assuming\nvariable time horizons based on position size and relative turnover. In an environment where\nVaR is difficult to estimate for lack of data, non-statistical concepts such as stop loss and\ngross/net positions can be used.\n9.6   Banking Book\nThe changes in market interest rates have earnings and economic value impacts on the banks\u2019\nbanking book .  Thus, given the complexity and range of balance sheet products, banks should\nhave IRR measurement systems that assess the effects of the rate changes on both earnings and\neconomic value .  The variety of techniques ranges from simple maturity (fixed rate) and\nrepricing  (floating rate) to static simulation, based on current on-and-off-balance sheet positions,\nto highly sophisticated dynamic modelling  techniques that incorporate assumptions on\nbehavioural  pattern of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items and can easily capture the\nfull range of exposures against basis risk, embedded option risk, yield curve risk, etc.\n9.7  Maturity Gap Analysis\n9.7.1  The simplest analytical techniques for calculation of IRR exposure begins with maturity\nGap analysis that distributes interest rate sensitive assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\npositions into a certain number of pre-defined time-bands according to their maturity (fixed rate)\nor time remaining for their next repricing (floating rate).  Those assets and liabilities lacking\ndefinite repricing  intervals (savings bank, cash credit, overdraft, loans, export finance, refinance\nfrom RBI etc.) or actual maturities vary from contractual maturities (embedded option in bonds\nwith put/call options, loans, cash credit/overdraft, time deposits, etc.) are assigned time-bands\naccording to the judgement, empirical studies and past experiences of banks.\n9.7.2   A number of time bands can be used while constructing a gap report.  Generally, most of\nthe banks focus their attention on near-term periods, viz. monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or one\nyear.  It is very difficult to take a view on interest rate movements beyond a year .  Banks with\nlarge exposures in the short-term should test the sensitivity of their assets and liabilities even at\nshorter intervals like overnight, 1-7 days, 8-14 days, etc.\n9.7.3  In order to evaluate the earnings exposure, interest Rate Sensitive Assets ( RSAs) in each\ntime band are netted with the interest Rate Sensitive Liabilities ( RSLs) to produce a repricing\n\u2018Gap\u2019 for that time band. The positive Gap indicates that banks have more RSAs than RSLs. A\npositive or asset sensitive Gap means that an increase in market interest rates could cause an\nincrease in NII .  Conversely, a negative or liability sensitive Gap implies that the banks\u2019 NII\ncould decline as a result of increase in market interest rates. The negative gap indicates that\nbanks have more RSLs than RSAs. The Gap is used as a measure of interest rate sensitivity. The\nPositive or Negative Gap is multiplied by the assumed interest rate changes to derive the\nEarnings at Risk ( EaR).  The EaR method facilitates to estimate how much the earnings might be\nimpacted by an adverse movement in interest rates. The changes in interest rate could be\nestimated on the basis of past trends, forecasting of interest rates, etc. The banks should fix EaR18\nwhich could be based on last/current year\u2019s income and a trigger point at which the line\nmanagement should adopt on-or off-balance sheet hedging strategies may be clearly defined.\n9.7.4  The Gap calculations can be augmented by information on the average coupon on assets\nand liabilities in each time band and the same could be used to calculate estimates of the level of\nNII from positions maturing or due for repricing within a given time-band, which would then\nprovide a scale to assess the changes in income implied by the gap analysis.\n9.7.5  The periodic gap analysis indicates the interest rate risk exposure of banks over distinct\nmaturities and suggests magnitude of portfolio changes necessary to alter the risk profile.\nHowever, the Gap report quantifies only the time difference between repricing dates of assets\nand liabilities but fails to measure the impact of basis and embedded option risks .  The Gap\nreport also fails to measure the entire impact of a change in interest rate (Gap report assumes that\nall assets and liabilities are matured or repriced simultaneously) within a given time-band and\neffect of changes in interest rates on the economic or market value of assets, liabilities and off-\nbalance sheet position .  It also does not take into account any differences in the timing of\npayments that might occur as a result of changes in interest rate environment .  Further, the\nassumption of parallel shift in yield curves seldom happen in the financial market .  The Gap\nreport also fails to capture variability in non-interest revenue and expenses, a potentially\nimportant source of risk to current income.\n9.7.6  In case banks could realistically estimate the magnitude of changes in market interest rates\nof various assets and liabilities (basis risk) and their past behavioural pattern (embedded option\nrisk), they could standardise the gap by multiplying the individual assets and liabilities by how\nmuch they will change for a given change in interest rate.  Thus, one or several assumptions of\nstandardised gap seem more consistent with real world than the simple gap method .  With the\nAdjusted Gap, banks could realistically estimate the EaR.\n9.8   Duration Gap Analysis\n9.8.1  Matching the duration of assets and liabilities, instead of matching the maturity or\nrepricing dates is the most effective way to protect the economic values of banks from exposure\nto IRR than the simple gap model.  Duration gap model focuses on managing economic value of\nbanks by recognising the change in the market value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\n(OBS) items .  When weighted assets and liabilities and OBS duration are matched, market\ninterest rate movements would have almost same impact on assets, liabilities and OBS, thereby\nprotecting the bank\u2019s total equity or net worth .  Duration is a measure of the percentage change\nin the economic value of a position that will occur given a small change in the level of interest\nrates.\n9.8.2  Measuring the duration gap is more complex than the simple gap model.  For\napproximation of duration of assets and liabilities, the simple gap schedule can be used by\napplying weights to each time-band .  The weights are based on estimates of the duration of assets\nand liabilities and OBS that fall into each time band .  The weighted duration of assets and\nliabilities and OBS provide a rough estimation of the changes in banks\u2019 economic value to a\ngiven change in market interest rates .  It is also possible to give different weights and interest\nrates to assets, liabilities and OBS in different time buckets to capture differences in coupons and\nmaturities and volatilities in interest rates along the yield curve.19\n9.8.3  In a more scientific way, banks can precisely estimate the economic value changes to\nmarket interest rates by calculating the duration of each asset, liability and OBS position and\nweigh each of them to arrive at the weighted duration of assets, liabilities and OBS. Once the\nweighted duration of assets and liabilities are estimated, the duration gap can be worked out with\nthe help of standard mathematical formulae. The Duration Gap measure can be used to estimate\nthe expected change in Market Value of Equity (MVE) for a given change in market interest rate.\n9.8.4  The difference between duration of assets (DA) and liabilities (DL) is bank\u2019s net duration.\nIf the net duration is positive (DA>DL), a decrease in market interest rates will increase the\nmarket value of equity of the bank .  When the duration gap is negative (DL> DA), the MVE\nincreases when the interest rate increases but decreases when the rate declines. Thus, the\nDuration Gap shows the impact of the movements in market interest rates on the MVE through\ninfluencing the market value of assets, liabilities and OBS.\n9.8.5  The attraction of duration analysis is that it provides a comprehensive measure of IRR for\nthe total portfolio.  The duration analysis also recognises the time value of money .  Duration\nmeasure is additive so that banks can match total assets and liabilities rather than matching\nindividual accounts. However, Duration Gap analysis assumes parallel shifts in yield curve .  For\nthis reason, it fails to recognise basis risk.\n9.9    Simulation\n9.9.1  Many of the international banks are now using balance sheet simulation models to gauge\nthe effect of market interest rate variations on reported earnings/economic values over different\ntime zones. Simulation technique attempts to overcome the limitations of Gap and Duration\napproaches by computer modelling the bank\u2019s interest rate sensitivity .  Such modelling involves\nmaking assumptions about future path of interest rates, shape of yield curve, changes in business\nactivity, pricing and hedging strategies, etc. The simulation involves detailed assessment of the\npotential effects of changes in interest rate on earnings and economic value .  The simulation\ntechniques involve detailed analysis of various components of on-and off-balance sheet\npositions .  Simulations can also incorporate more varied and refined changes in the interest rate\nenvironment, ranging from changes in the slope and shape of the yield curve and interest rate\nscenario derived from Monte Carlo simulations.\n9.9.2  The output of simulation can take a variety of forms, depending on users\u2019 need.\nSimulation can provide current and expected periodic gaps, duration gaps, balance sheet and\nincome statements, performance measures, budget and financial reports .  The simulation model\nprovides an effective tool for understanding the risk exposure under variety of interest\nrate/balance sheet scenarios .  This technique also plays an integral-planning role in evaluating\nthe effect of alternative business strategies on risk exposures.\n9.9.3 The simulation can be carried out under static and dynamic environment .  While the\ncurrent on and off-balance sheet positions are evaluated under static environment, the dynamic\nsimulation builds in more detailed assumptions about the future course of interest rates and the\nunexpected changes in bank\u2019s business activity.\n9.9.4  The usefulness of the simulation technique depends on the structure of the model, validity\nof assumption, technology support and technical expertise of banks.20\n9.9.5  The application of various techniques depends to a large extent on the quality of data and\nthe degree of automated system of operations.  Thus, banks may start with the gap or duration\ngap or simulation techniques on the basis of availability of data, information technology and\ntechnical expertise .  In any case, as suggested by RBI in the guidelines on ALM System, banks\nshould start estimating the interest rate risk exposure with the help of Maturity Gap approach .\nOnce banks are comfortable with the Gap model, they can progressively graduate into the\nsophisticated approaches.\n9.10  Funds Transfer Pricing\n9.10.1  The Transfer Pricing mechanism being followed by many banks does not support good\nALM Systems. Many international banks which have different products and operate in various\ngeographic markets have been using internal Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) .  FTP is an internal\nmeasurement designed to assess the financial impact of uses and sources of funds and can be\nused to evaluate the profitability .  It can also be used to isolate returns for various risks assumed\nin the intermediation process .  FTP also helps correctly identify the cost of opportunity value of\nfunds. Although banks have adopted various FTP frameworks and techniques, Matched Funds\nPricing (MFP) is the most efficient technique .  Most of the international banks use MFP. The\nFTP envisages assignment of specific assets and liabilities to various functional units (profit\ncentres) \u2013 lending, investment, deposit taking and funds management .  Each unit attracts sources\nand uses of funds .  The lending, investment and deposit taking profit centres sell their liabilities\nto and buys funds for financing their assets from the funds management profit centre at\nappropriate transfer prices .  The transfer prices are fixed on the basis of a single curve (MIBOR\nor derived cash curve, etc) so that asset-liability transactions of identical attributes are assigned\nidentical transfer prices. Transfer prices could, however, vary according to maturity, purpose,\nterms and other attributes.\n9.10.2 The FTP provides for allocation of margin (franchise and credit spreads) to profit centres\non original transfer rates and any residual spread (mismatch spread) is credited to the funds\nmanagement profit centre.  This spread is the result of accumulated mismatches. The margins of\nvarious profit centres are:\n\u2022 Deposit profit centre:\nTransfer Price (TP) on deposits - cost of deposits \u2013 deposit insurance- overheads.\n\u2022 Lending profit centre:\n   Loan yields + TP on deposits \u2013 TP on loan financing \u2013 cost of deposits \u2013\n    deposit insurance - overheads \u2013 loan loss provisions.\n\u2022 Investment profit centre:\nSecurity yields + TP on deposits \u2013 TP on security financing \u2013 cost of deposits \u2013 deposit\ninsurance - overheads \u2013 provisions for depreciation in investments and loan loss.\n\u2022 Funds Management profit centre:21\nTP on funds lent \u2013 TP on funds borrowed \u2013 Statutory Reserves cost \u2013 overheads.\nFor illustration, let us assume that a bank\u2019s Deposit profit centre has raised a 3 month deposit @\n6.5% p.a. and that the alternative funding cost i.e. MIBOR for 3 months and one year @ 8% and\n10.5% p.a., respectively .  Let us also assume that the bank\u2019s Loan profit centre  created  a  one\nyear  loan @ 13.5% p.a. The franchise (liability), credit and mismatch spreads of bank is as\nunder:\nProfit Centres\nDeposit Funds LoanTotal\nInterest Income 8.0 10.5 13.5 13.5\nInterest Expenditure 6.5 8.0 10.5 6.5\nMargin 1.5 2.5 3.0 7.0\nLoan Loss Provision (expected) - - 1.0 1.0\nDeposit Insurance 0.1 - - 0.1\nReserve Cost (CRR/ SLR) - 1.0 - 1.0\nOverheads 0.6 0.5 0.6 1.7\nNII 0.8 1.0 1.4 3.2\nUnder the FTP mechanism, the profit centres (other than funds management) are\nprecluded from assuming any funding mismatches and thereby exposing them to market risk.\nThe credit or counterparty and price risks are, however, managed by these profit centres. The\nentire market risks, i.e interest rate, liquidity and forex are assumed by the funds management\nprofit centre.\n9.10.3  The FTP allows lending and deposit raising profit centres determine their expenses and\nprice their products competitively. Lending profit centre which knows the carrying cost of the\nloans needs to focus on to price only the spread necessary to compensate the perceived credit\nrisk and operating expenses .  Thus, FTP system could effectively be used as a way to centralise\nthe bank\u2019s overall market risk at one place and would support an effective ALM modelling\nsystem. FTP also could be used to enhance corporate communication; greater line management\ncontrol and solid base for rewarding line management.\n10.   Foreign Exchange ( Forex) Risk\n10.1 The risk inherent in running open foreign exchange positions have been heightened in\nrecent years by the pronounced volatility in forex rates, thereby adding a new dimension to the\nrisk profile of banks\u2019 balance sheets.\n10.2  Forex risk is the risk that a bank may suffer losses as a result of adverse exchange rate\nmovements during a period in which it has an open position, either spot or forward, or a\ncombination of the two, in an individual foreign currency.  The banks are also exposed to\ninterest rate risk, which arises from the maturity mismatching of foreign currency positions .\nEven in cases where spot and forward positions in individual currencies are balanced, the\nmaturity pattern of forward transactions may produce mismatches .  As a result, banks may suffer\nlosses as a result of changes in premia/discounts of the currencies concerned.\n10.3  In the forex business, banks also face the risk of default of the counterparties or settlement\nrisk.  While such type of risk crystallisation does not cause principal loss, banks may have to22\nundertake fresh transactions in the cash/spot market for replacing the failed transactions .  Thus,\nbanks may incur replacement cost, which depends upon the currency rate movements .  Banks\nalso face another risk called time-zone risk or Herstatt risk which arises out of time-lags in\nsettlement of one currency in one centre and the settlement of another currency in another time-\nzone.  The forex transactions with counterparties from another country also trigger sovereign or\ncountry risk.\n10.4   Forex Risk Management Measures\n1. Set appropriate limits \u2013 open positions and gaps.\n2. Clear-cut and well-defined division of responsibility between front, middle and back offices.\nThe top management should also adopt the VaR approach to measure the risk associated with\nexposures .  Reserve Bank of India has recently introduced two statements viz. Maturity and\nPosition (MAP) and Interest Rate Sensitivity (SIR) for measurement of forex risk exposures.\nBanks should use these statements for periodical monitoring of forex risk exposures.\n11.   Capital for Market Risk\n11.1 The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) had issued comprehensive\nguidelines to provide an explicit capital cushion for the price risks to which banks are exposed,\nparticularly those arising from their trading activities .  The banks have been given flexibility to\nuse in-house models based on VaR for measuring market risk as an alternative to a standardised\nmeasurement framework suggested by Basle Committee .  The internal models should, however,\ncomply with quantitative and qualitative criteria prescribed by Basle Committee.\n11.2  Reserve Bank of India has accepted the general framework suggested by the Basle\nCommittee. RBI has also initiated various steps in moving towards prescribing capital for market\nrisk.  As an initial step, a risk weight of 2.5% has been prescribed for investments in\nGovernment and other approved securities, besides a risk weight each of 100% on the open\nposition limits in forex and gold. RBI has also prescribed detailed operating guidelines for Asset-\nLiability Management System in banks. As the ability of banks to identify and measure market\nrisk improves, it would be necessary to assign explicit capital charge for market risk .  In the\nmeanwhile, banks are advised to study the Basle Committee\u2019s paper on \u2018Overview of the\nAmendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks\u2019 \u2013 January 1996 (copy enclosed).\nWhile the small banks operating predominantly in India could adopt the standardised\nmethodology, large banks and those banks operating in international markets should develop\nexpertise in evolving internal models for measurement of market risk.\n11.3 The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision proposes to develop capital charge for\ninterest rate risk in the banking book as well for banks where the interest rate risks are\nsignificantly above average (\u2018 outliers\u2019). The Committee is now exploring various methodologies\nfor identifying \u2018 outliers\u2019 and how best to apply and calibrate a capital charge for interest rate risk\nfor banks .  Once the Committee finalises the modalities, it may be necessary, at least for banks\noperating in the international markets to comply with the explicit capital charge requirements for\ninterest rate risk in the banking book.23\n12.   Operational Risk\n12.1 Managing operational risk is becoming an important feature of sound risk management\npractices in modern financial markets in the wake of phenomenal increase in the volume of\ntransactions, high degree of structural changes and complex support systems .  The most\nimportant type of operational risk involves breakdowns in internal controls and corporate\ngovernance. Such breakdowns can lead to financial loss through error, fraud, or failure to\nperform in a timely manner or cause the interest of the bank to be compromised.\n12.2 Generally, operational risk is defined as any risk, which is not categoried as market or credit\nrisk, or the risk of loss arising from various types of human or technical error .  It is also\nsynonymous with settlement or payments risk and business interruption, administrative and legal\nrisks.  Operational risk has some form of link between credit and market risks .  An operational\nproblem with a business transaction could trigger a credit or market risk.\n12.3   Measurement\nThere is no uniformity of approach in measurement of operational risk in the banking system.\nBesides, the existing methods are relatively simple and experimental, although some of the\ninternational banks have made considerable progress in developing more advanced techniques\nfor allocating capital with regard to operational risk.\nMeasuring operational risk requires both estimating the probability of an operational loss\nevent and the potential size of the loss .  It relies on risk factor that provides some indication of\nthe likelihood of an operational loss event occurring. The process of operational risk assessment\nneeds to address the likelihood (or frequency) of a particular operational risk occurring, the\nmagnitude (or severity) of the effect of the operational risk on business objectives and the\noptions available to manage and initiate actions to reduce/ mitigate operational risk. The set of\nrisk factors that measure risk in each business unit such as audit ratings, operational data such as\nvolume, turnover and complexity and data on quality of operations such as error rate or measure\nof business risks such as revenue volatility, could be related to historical loss experience. Banks\ncan also use different analytical or judgmental techniques to arrive at an overall operational risk\nlevel. Some of the international banks have already developed operational risk rating matrix,\nsimilar to bond credit rating .  The operational risk assessment should be bank-wide basis and it\nshould be reviewed at regular intervals .  Banks, over a period, should develop internal systems to\nevaluate the risk profile and assign economic capital within the RAROC framework.\nIndian banks have so far not evolved any scientific methods for quantifying operational\nrisk.  In the absence any sophisticated models, banks could evolve simple benchmark based on\nan aggregate measure of business activity such as gross revenue, fee income, operating costs,\nmanaged assets or total assets adjusted for off-balance sheet exposures or a combination of these\nvariables.\n12.4   Risk Monitoring\nThe operational risk monitoring system focuses, inter alia, on operational performance measures\nsuch as volume, turnover, settlement facts, delays and errors .  It could also be incumbent to24\nmonitor operational loss directly with an analysis of each occurrence and description of the\nnature and causes of the loss.\n12.5   Control of Operational Risk\nInternal controls and the internal audit are used as the primary means to mitigate operational risk .\nBanks could also explore setting up operational risk limits, based on the measures of operational\nrisk.  The contingent processing capabilities could also be used as a means to limit the adverse\nimpacts of operational risk .  Insurance is also an important mitigator of some forms of\noperational risk. Risk education for familiarising the complex operations at all levels of staff can\nalso reduce operational risk.\n12.6    Policies and Procedures\nBanks should have well defined policies on operational risk management .  The policies and\nprocedures should be based on common elements across business lines or risks .  The policy\nshould address product review process, involving business, risk management and internal control\nfunctions.\n12.7   Internal Control\n12.7.1 One of the major tools for managing operational risk is the well-established internal\ncontrol system, which includes segregation of duties, clear management reporting lines and\nadequate operating procedures. Most of the operational risk events are associated with weak\nlinks in internal control systems or laxity in complying with the existing internal control\nprocedures.\n12.7.2 The ideal method of identifying problem spots is the technique of self-assessment of\ninternal control environment .  The self-assessment could be used to evaluate operational risk\nalongwith internal/external audit reports/ratings or RBI inspection findings .  Banks should\nendeavour for detection of operational problem spots rather than their being pointed out by\nsupervisors/internal or external auditors.\n12.7.3  Alongwith activating internal audit systems, the Audit Committees should play greater\nrole to ensure independent financial and internal control functions.\n12.7.4   The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision proposes to develop an explicit capital\ncharge for operational risk.\n13.  Risk Aggregation and Capital Allocation\n13.1  Most of internally active banks have developed internal processes and techniques to assess\nand evaluate their own capital needs in the light of their risk profiles and business plans.  Such\nbanks take into account both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess economic capital .  The\nBasle Committee now recognises that capital adequacy in relation to economic risk is a\nnecessary condition for the long-term soundness of banks .  Thus, in addition to complying with\nthe established minimum regulatory capital requirements, banks should critically assess their\ninternal capital adequacy and future capital needs on the basis of risks assumed by individual25\nlines of business, product, etc. As a part of the process for evaluating internal capital adequacy, a\nbank should be able to identify and evaluate its risks across all its activities to determine whether\nits capital levels are appropriate.\n13.2  Thus, at the bank\u2019s Head Office level, aggregate risk exposure should receive increased\nscrutiny.  To do so, however, it requires the summation of the different types of risks .  Banks,\nacross the world, use different ways to estimate the aggregate risk exposures .  The most\ncommonly used approach is the Risk Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC). The RAROC is\ndesigned to allow all the business streams of a financial institution to be evaluated on an equal\nfooting.  Each type of risks is measured to determine both the expected and unexpected losses\nusing VaR or worst-case type analytical model .  Key to RAROC is the matching of revenues,\ncosts and risks on transaction or portfolio basis over a defined time period .  This begins with a\nclear differentiation between expected and unexpected losses. Expected losses are covered by\nreserves and provisions and unexpected losses require capital allocation which is determined on\nthe principles of confidence levels, time horizon, diversification and correlation .  In this\napproach, risk is measured in terms of variability of income .  Under this framework, the\nfrequency distribution of return, wherever possible is estimated and the Standard Deviation (SD)\nof this distribution is also estimated .  Capital is thereafter allocated to activities as a function of\nthis risk or volatility measure .  Then, the risky position is required to carry an expected rate of\nreturn on allocated capital, which compensates the bank for the associated incremental risk. By\ndimensioning all risks in terms of loss distribution and allocating capital by the volatility of the\nnew activity, risk is aggregated and priced.\n13.3 The second approach is similar to the RAROC, but depends less on capital allocation and\nmore on cash flows or variability in earnings .  This is referred to as EaR, when employed to\nanalyse interest rate risk. Under this analytical framework also frequency distribution of returns\nfor any one type of risk can be estimated from historical data .  Extreme outcome can be\nestimated from the tail of the distribution .  Either a worst case scenario could be used or\nStandard Deviation 1/2/2.69 could also be considered .  Accordingly, each bank can restrict the\nmaximum potential loss to certain percentage of past/current income or market value .\nThereafter, rather than moving from volatility of value through capital, this approach goes\ndirectly to current earnings implications from a risky position .  This approach, however, is based\non cash flows and ignores the value changes in assets and liabilities due to changes in market\ninterest rates .  It also depends upon a subjectively specified range of the risky environments to\ndrive the worst case scenario.\n13.4  Given the level of extant risk management practices, most of Indian banks may not be in a\nposition to adopt RAROC framework and allocate capital to various businesses units on the basis\nof risk.  However, at least, banks operating in international markets should develop, by March\n31, 2001, suitable methodologies for estimating economic capital.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/9492.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 20, 1999", "info": "A.D.

With a view to encouraging\nmobilisation of domestic idle gold under the Gold Deposit Scheme proposed to be\nintroduced by the authorised banks, it has been decided to exempt these banks\nparticipating in the Gold Deposit Scheme from maintaining Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)\non liabilities under gold deposits mobilised in India .  However, in view of the multiple\nprescriptions on different categories of liabilities, including zero CRR prescription on\ncertain liabilities as stipulated under the law, the effective CRR maintained by the\nauthorised banks on total Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL), including the\nliabilities under the Gold Deposit Scheme should not be less than 3 per cent as required in\nterms of  Section 42(1) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. A copy of the\nNotification DBOD.No.IBS.BC.95/23.67.001/99-2000 dated  October  5, 1999 in this\nregard is enclosed.2. With regard to the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), since the present presc ription\nof SLR on total NDTL is 25 per cent, which is the statutory minimum required to be\nmaintained in terms of Section 24 (2A) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the\neffective SLR maintained by the nominated banks on total NDTL including the liabilities\nunder Gold Deposit Scheme should not be less than 25 per cent .  It is clarified that the\nmobilised gold with the bank will constitute an eligible asset under SLR if the banks hold\nsuch gold with themselves in physical form.\n3.  Banks are required to c onvert the liabilities and assets denominated in terms of\ngold into rupees for the purpose of compliance with reserve requirements/capital\nprescription requirements/balance sheet translation requirements .  The conversion of gold\ninto rupees may be done by crossing the London AM fixing for Gold/USD rate with the\nRupee-dollar reference rate announced by RBI .

NO.RPCD.SP .BC 23   / 09 .01 .01 / 99 -2000\nThe Chairman/Managing Director\nAll Indian Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(Excluding RRBs)\nDear Sir\nSwarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY)\nThe Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India have launched a new programme\nknown as \u201cSwarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana\u201d(SGSY) by restructuring  the existing\nschemes namely,\nIntegrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP)\nTraining of Rural Youth for Self Employment (TRYSEM)\nDevelopment of Women & Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA)\nSupply of Improved Toolkits to Rural Artisans (SITRA)\nGanga Kalyan Yojana (GKY)\nMillion Wells Scheme (MWS)\nI.The Scheme\nThe SGSY Scheme is operative from 1st April 1999 in  rural  areas of the country. SGSY is a\nholistic Scheme covering all aspects of self employment such as organisation of the poor into\nSelf Help Groups, training, credit, technology, infrastructure and marketing.  The scheme will\nbe funded by the Centre and the States in the ratio of 75 : 25 and will be implemented by\nCommercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks and Co-operative Banks. Other financial\ninstitutions, Panchayat Raj Institutions, District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs), Non\nGovernment Organisations(NGOs), Technical institutions in the district, will be involved in\nthe process of planning, implementation and monitoring of the scheme.  NGO\u2019s help may be\nsought  in the formation and nurturing of the Self Help Groups (SHGs) as well as in the\nmonitoring of the progress of the Swarozgaris.  Where feasible their services may be utilised\nin the provision of technology support, quality control of the products and as recovery\nmonitors cum facilitators.\nThe Scheme aims at establishing a large number of micro enterprises in the rural areas.  The\nlist of Below Poverty Line (BPL) households identified through BPL census duly approved by\nGram Sabha will form the basis for identification of families for assistance under SGSY.  The\nobjective of SGSY is to bring every assisted family above the poverty line within three years\nby providing them income generating assets through a mix of bank credit and Government\nsubsidy.  The rural poor such as those with land, landless labour, educated unemployed, rural\nartisans and disabled are  covered under the scheme.\nThe assisted families known as Swarozgaris can be either individuals or groups and would be\nselected from BPL families by a three member team consisting of Block Development\nOfficer, Banker and Sarpanch.\nSGSY will  focus on  vulnerable sections of the rural poor.  Accordingly the SC/ST will\naccount for atleast 50%, Women 40% and the disabled 3% of those assisted.\nII.Skill Upgradation\nWithdrawn w.e.f May 13, 2022SGSYLH.doc                                                                                                                     2Once the person or group of persons has been identified for assistance, their training needs\nalso is to be ascertained with reference to Minimum Skill Requirement (MSR).  The\nassessment regarding technical skills would be made by line departments and that of\nmanagerial skills by the banker, while scrutinising the loan applications. Swarozgaris\npossessing skills will be put through basic orientation programme which is mandatory.  This\nprogramme includes elements of Book Keeping, knowledge of market, identification and\nappraisal, acquaintance with product costing, product pricing, familiarisation with project\nfinancing by banks as well as basic skills in the key activity identified.  It will be for a short\nduration of not more than 2 days. BDOs, Bankers and line departments will act as resource\npersons for imparting the training.  The training expenditure will be met by DRDAs.\nFor those  beneficiaries who need additional skill development/upgradation of skills,\nappropriate training would be organised through Government institutions, ITIs, polytechnics,\nUniversities, NGOs etc. Swarozgaris will be eligible for loans under SGSY when they\npossess Minimum Skill Requirement, and it will be disbursed only when they have\nsatisfactorily completed the skill training.\nFor this training, Swarozgaris will be entitled for financial assistance if they are required to\nundergo training for more than a week. The rate of assitance would be fixed locally.  The\nbank will provide loans  to the Swarozgaris for this purpose. However, as the credit has to be\nextended before the project is taken up, notwithstanding the general security norms for\nlending under the scheme, banks may extend loans for skill development training with or\nwithout collateral / third party guarantee at their discretion.\nIII.  Activity Clusters, Key  Activities\nMajor share of assistance upto 75% (both by number and funding) will be for key activities\nand they should be taken up in clusters. For this, 4-5 key activities will be identified for each\nblock with the approval of Panchayat Samithis at block level and DRDA/ZP at the District\nlevel.One or two activities in each block would be identified during 1999-2000 so that\nimplementation can be started straight away. On farm activities to be assisted would include\nminor irrigation such as open dug well/bore/tube well/lift irrigation/check dam etc.  Non farm\nactivities will include those activities that result in the production of goods/services that have\nready market.The unit cost as fixed by the regional Committees of NABARD should be\ntaken into consideration as indicative cost while fixing the unit cost for the farm sector . In\nregard to loans falling  under ISB Sector, the responsibility of fixing the unit cost and\nother techno-economic parameters is of the  District SGSY Committee. The selection of\nactivities should be such that it would afford the Swarozgari an opportunity to expand his\nasset and skill base in three years and atleast in the third year the net income would be not\nless than Rs.2,000/-p.m.\nIV.  Self-Help Groups (SHGs)\nThe Self Help Groups shall be organised by Swarozgaris drawn from the BPL list approved\nby Gram Sabha .The Scheme provides for formation of Self Help Groups (SHGs),  nurturing\nand their linkages with banks.  Group activities will be given preference and progressively\nmajority of the funding will be for Self Help Groups. Half the groups formed at block level\nshould be exclusively women groups.\nSHG under SGSY may consist of 10 to 20 persons belonging to BPL families.  In case of\nminor irrigation and in the case of disabled persons this number may be a minimum of 5\npersons.  The group shall not comprise  more than one member of the same family.  A person\nshould not be a member of more than one group.  SHG may be an informal group or\nregistered under Societies Act, State Co-operative Act or as a partnership firm. The assistance\nWithdrawn w.e.f May 13, 2022SGSYLH.doc                                                                                                                     3(loan cum subsidy) may be extended to individuals in a group or to all members in the group\nfor taking up income generation activities.\nIn States and Union Territories where the formation of SHGs has not taken root, banks may\ncontinue to extend credit facilities to eligible individual Swarozgaris.\nV. Revolving Fund\nEvery SHG that is in existence at least for a period of six months and which has demonstrated\nthe potential of a viable group will receive a revolving fund of Rs. 25,000/- from banks as\ncash credit facility. Of this a sum of Rs.10,000/- will be given to the bank by the DRDA.\nBanks may charge interest only on the sum exceeding Rs.10,000/-. The revolving fund is\nprovided to the groups to augment the group corpus so as to enable larger number of members\nto avail loans and also to facilitate increase in the per capita loan available to the members.\nThe revolving fund imparts credit discipline and financial management skills to the members\nso that they become credit worthy. SHGs that have demonstrated their successful existence,\nwill receive the assistance for economic activities under the scheme.\nVI. Lending Norms\nThe size of loan under the scheme would depend on the nature of project.  There is no\ninvestment ceiling other than the unit cost i.e. investment requirement worked out for the\nproject.  The loans under the scheme would be composite loan  comprising of Term Loan and\nworking capital. The  loan component and the admissible subsidy together would be equal to\ntotal project cost. Banks may follow model project report set out in key activities of the\ndistricts for finalising the project cost of the Swarozgaris. Under any circumstance under\nfinancing is to be avoided. Swarozgaris will be given the full amount of loan and subsidy and\nthey will have the freedom to procure the assets themselves.  Disbursements up to Rs.10,000/-\nunder ISB sector may be made in cash where a number of items are to be bought.\nEmphasis is laid on multiple dose of assistance. This  would mean assisting a Swarozgari\nover a period of time with second and subsequent dose(s) of credit enabling him/her to cross\nthe poverty line as also  access higher amounts of credit.  Subsidy entitlement for all doses\ntaken together should not exceed the limit prescribed for that category.  The second and\nsubsequent doses may be granted by the same bank or any other bank during the currency of\nfirst/ earlier loan provided the bank is satisfied about the financial discipline of the\nfirst/earlier dose.\nLoans under the Scheme will carry interest as per the directives on interest rates issued by\nReserve Bank of India from time to time.\nAll loans granted under the scheme are to be treated as advances under priority sector. Loan\napplications should be disposed of within 15 days and  at any rate not later than one month .\nBranch Managers may be vested with adequate discretionary powers to sanction proposals\nunder the scheme without reference to any higher authority.\nAssistance to IRDP borrowers\nThe existing IRDP borrowers may also be considered for second / multiple dose of assistance\nunder SGSY if they have failed to cross the poverty line because of no fault of theirs.\nBanks may also extend credit under SGSY to non wilful defaulter owing dues up to Rs.\n5,000/- under IRDP. Subsidy available to the existing  IRDP  beneficiaries would be restricted\nto the maximum ceiling prescribed for the category  less the amount already availed by the\nborrower under IRDP.\nVII.  Insurance Cover\nWithdrawn w.e.f May 13, 2022SGSYLH.doc                                                                                                                     4Insurance  cover is available for assets/ live stock bought out of the loan . Swarozgaris are\ncovered under the Group Insurance Scheme as per the details given at paragraphs 4.35 & 4.36\nof the SGSY guidelines.\nVIII.    Security norms\nFor individual loans up to Rs.50,000/- and group loans up to Rs.3 lakhs, the assets created out\nof bank loan would be hypothecated to the bank as primary security. In cases where movable\nassets are not created as in land based activities such as dug well, minor irrigation etc.,\nmortgage of land may be obtained. Where mortgage of land is not possible third party\nguarantee may be obtained at the discretion of the bank..\nFor all individual loans exceeding Rs.50,000/-and group loans exceeding Rs.3 lakhs in\naddition to primary security such as hypothecation/mortgage of  land or third party guarantee\nas the case  may be, suitable margin money/ other collateral security in the form of insurance\npolicy , marketable security/ deeds of other property etc. may be obtained at the discretion of\nthe bank.\nIX.   Subsidy\nSubsidy under SGSY will be uniform at 30% of the project cost, subject to a maximum of\nRs.7,500/-.  In respect of SC/STs it will be 50% of the project cost subject to a maximum of\nRs.10,000/-. For  groups of Swarozgaris (SHGs) the subsidy would be at 50% of the cost of\nthe project, subject to a ceiling of Rs.1.25 lakhs.  There will be no monetary limit on subsidy\nfor irrigation projects.  Subsidy under SGSY will be back ended. The availability of the\nbenefit of subsidy to swarozgaris would be contingent on the proper utilisation of loan as also\nits prompt repayment and maintaining the asset in good condition. The procedure for\noperation of Subsidy Reserve Fund accounts as detailed in paragraph 4.17 of the SGSY\nguidelines may please be followed.\nDRDAs will be opening savings bank accounts with the principal participating bank branches\nfor administration of subsidy. These accounts are to be reconciled every three months and\nthey will be subject to annual audit.\nX. Post Credit follow up\nLoan Pass books in  regional languages may be issued to the Swarozgaris which may contain\nall the details of the loans disbursed to  them .\nBank branches may observe one day in a week as non public business working day to enable\nthe staff  to go to the field and attend to the problems of Swarozgaris.\nBanks should ensure through proper monitoring and verification that quality assets have been\nprocured by the Swarozgaris. Necessary documents relating to acquisition of assets should be\nobtained by the bank and also followed through visits by field staff. In case of non-\nprocurement of assets by the Swarozgari in spite of reasonable time and opportunity, the bank\nshall be free to cancel the loan and recover the money. Legal proceedings (Civil/Criminal)\nwherever necessary may be initiated against the Swarozgari and  against all members in case\nof SHG for recovery of loan.\nXI.    Risk Fund for consumption credit\nThe scheme provides for the creation of Risk Fund with 1% of SGSY funds at District level.\nConsumption loans not exceeding Rs.2000/- per swarozgari would be provided by the banks.\nAssistance to the extent of 10% of the total consumption loans disbursed by banks to the\nSGSY swarozgaris during the year would be provided out of this Risk Fund.\nWithdrawn w.e.f May 13, 2022SGSYLH.doc                                                                                                                     5XII.   Repayment of loan\nAll SGSY loans are to be treated as medium term loans with minimum repayment period of\nfive years. Instalments for repayment of loan will be fixed as per the unit cost approved by the\nNABARD/ Dist.SGSY Committee. There  will be a moratorium on repayment of loans during\nthe gestation period.  Repayment instalments should not be more than 50 per cent of the\nincremental net income expected from the project. Number of instalments may be fixed\ntaking into consideration the principal amount, the interest liability and the repayment period.\nSwarozgaris will not be entitled for any benefit of subsidy if the loan is fully repaid before the\nprescribed lock-in period.  The repayment period for various activities under SGSY, broadly\nbe categorised into 5, 7 and 9 years depending on the project .  The corresponding lock-in\nperiod would be 3, 4 and 5 years respectively.  If the loan is fully repaid before the currency\nperiod, the Swarozgaris will be entitled only to pro-rata subsidy.\nXIII.  Recovery\nPrompt recovery of loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme.  Banks shall\ntake all possible measures, i.e., personal contact, organisation of joint recovery camps with\nDistrict Administration, legal action, etc to ensure recovery.  In case, even after this, the bank\nfails to recover the entire dues, the process of forfeiture of subsidy for adjustment against\ndues may be taken up.  After getting the approval of the District SGSY committee the\nconcerned bank may adjust the subsidy (including interest earned) against the Swarozgari\u2019s\ndues.  If the bank is able to realise any amount subsequently over and above the amount due\nto it, the amount may be returned to the DRDA.\nThe banks may engage the services of NGOs or individuals (other than government servants)\nas monitor-cum-recovery facilitators, on a commission basis.  A processing-cum-monitoring\nfee of 0.5 per cent of the loan amount may be charged to the Swarozgaris to meet this\nexpenditure.  Prompt repayment at the Swarozgari\u2019s level, will entitle him/her to waiver of\nthe 0.5 per cent processing-cum-monitoring fee.\nKeeping in view the importance of loan recovery, banks should prepare the list of defaulters\nunder IRDP before the end of September 1999 and furnish the same to Gram Sabha / BDO /\nDRDA and initiate recovery efforts .\n XIV.    Refinance of SGSY loans\nBanks are eligible for refinance from NABARD for the loans disbursed under SGSY as per\ntheir guidelines.  The eligibility for refinance is related to the recovery position of the banks.\n XV.   Role of banks and state agencies\nBanks will be closely involved with Government agencies in implementing, planning and\npreparation of projects, identification of key activities, clusters, self-help groups,\nidentification of individual swarozgaris  infrastructure planning as well as capacity building\nand choice of activity of the SHGs, grading of SHGs, selection of Swarozgaris, pre-credit\nactivities and post credit monitoring including loan recovery.  The bank has the final say in\nthe selection of Swarozgaris.\nXVI.   Deputation of Bank Officials to the DRDAs\nAs a measure of strengthening the DRDAs and for promoting a better credit environment,\ndeputation of bank officials to DRDAs has been suggested . Banks may  consider deputing\nofficers at various levels to the state Governments/DRDAs in consultation with them.\nXVII.  Supervision and monitoring\nWithdrawn w.e.f May 13, 2022SGSYLH.doc                                                                                                                     6Banks may set up SGSY cells at Regional/Zonal Offices. These cells should periodically\nmonitor and  review  the flow of credit to SGSY Swarozgaris, ensure the implementation of\nthe guidelines of the scheme, collect data from the branches and make available consolidated\ndata to the Head Office of the bank. The banks should ensure that no query from the field\nlevel remains unattended by the Head Office. Monitoring of the Scheme at the Head Office\nlevel of the bank may be entrusted to a Senior Officer and the progress of this programme\nmay be reviewed on a regular basis by the Top Management.\nThe scheme provides for the setting up of SGSY committees at Block/ District/State and\nCentral level.  These committees will hold periodical meetings wherein the implementation of\nthe scheme will be reviewed and monitored.  It is expected that banks will actively participate\nin these meetings and maintain closer co-ordination with the different agencies responsible\nfor the implementation of SGSY.\nXVIII.  Service Area Approach\nThe district SGSY Committee set up under the Scheme has been authorised to reallocate the\nvillages, which are either not covered by any bank branch or where the concerned branch is\nnot able to perform for any reason whatsoever. The  district SGSY Committee\u2019s decision on\nreallocation would be placed before DCC for its consideration and further necessary action.\nXIX.  Submission of data\nClose monitoring at all levels would contribute greatly to the  effective implementation of the\nScheme. To facilitate flow of information, the bank branches may submit the data on the\nprogress under the scheme on a monthly basis to Block Development Officer/ Lead Bank\nOfficer/ Regional Office by 10th   of the following month. Regional Office of the Bank may\nsubmit the same to their Zonal Office by 20th of the following month and Zonal Office in turn\nmay submit the consolidated data to Head Office by 25th of the following month. The Head\nOffice of the bank  will submit the consolidated data to the Ministry of Rural Development,\nGovt. of India,New Delhi by end of the following month.\nThe review of  the progress under SGSY scheme may be made by the banks at Regional/\nZonal / Head Office on a quarterly basis. A copy of the review note duly approved by the\nBoard may be forwarded  to the Ministry of Rural  Development,New Delhi and Rural\nPlanning & Credit Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office ,Mumbai.\nBanks may continue to submit the data under Scheme to the government agencies in the\nexisting format prescribed under IRDP.\nXX.

Banks have been asked to maintain\nadequate cash inventory so that all cash transactions are effected on assured basis during\nthe century date change period. As a measure of guidance banks were also advised to\nprepare hard copies of all their books and customer accounts as on December 31, 1999.\nIt is important that while banks take necessary actions to be Year 2000 ready, they would\nneed to constantly gauge public reactions to issues associated with Y2K. In this context\nall banks are advised to assess and hold the required cash for meeting any demands\ninduced by the circumstance of the millennium change. For this purpose, banks should\nplan to build up their cash inventory well in advance in order to obviate the bottlenecks\narising from the logistics of indenting, movement and distribution of currency notes. The\nIssue Offices of the Reserve Bank will be ready to service the requirements of the banks\nto enable them to commence building currency stocks right from October 1999. For\ninventory planning to be effective, banks need to review vault capacity, as also address\nrelated internal control, insurance, and security issues. Banks having Currency Chests are\nencouraged to get in touch with the nearest issue office of the Reserve Bank and ensure\nthat their stocks are adequately replenished. On its part, the Reserve Bank of India\nassures that all its Issue Offices would have adequate stock of currency notes to meet any\nexceptional demand.\nBanks are also advised to identify Core Personnel at their Head Offices as also at each of\ntheir computerised operating locations .  The personnel would need to be well versed in\nimplementing the bank's contingency plans and reviving computer systems in the\nunlikely event of encountering problems on account of Y2K. As far as possible, banks\nshould also enlist vendor support and have standby arrangements in their premises during\nthe Year 2000 transition so that problems of technical nature could be expeditiously\nattended to .  The banks would need to formulate and implement a personnel policy in\norder to ensure that the services of the Core Personnel are available sufficiently well\nbefore the century date change till the end of February - the Leap Year Date of year 2000 .\nThe Reserve Bank also considers it necessary for banks to adopt an appropriate 'leavepolicy' as well as 'transfer policy' so that the identified Core Personnel would be available\nright from December 15, 1999 through mid March 2000.\nWe urge on the Chief Executive and the Board of Directors to be closely involved with\nthe Year 2000 preparedness within their respective banks and subsidiary institutions.\nWe would strongly encourage you to specify the actions taken on this letter in your\nmonthly progress reports to the Y2K Project Cell.\nYours faithfully\nsd/-\n(M.R.

In case of students since the date of\ncommencement of course is indicated in the letter of admission from the overseas educational\ninstitution, it has been decided that authorised dealers need not insist on journey ticket, while\nreleasing exchange to students.\n2.Quantum of Exchange\nIn  terms  of item (e) under caption \u201cQuantum of Exchange\u201d of item XVI of Part A of Annexure\nI to Chapter 8 of ECM authorised dealers have been advised to release exchange for studies\nabroad in the form of currency notes not exceeding U.S.$ 500 and in the form of travellers\u2019\ncheques not exceeding U.S.$ 1,500.

This has given an impression that\nthe student is required to avail of exchange facilities for the entire duration of the course  from\nthe same branch of authorised dealer. Accordingly, when a student approaches an authorised\ndealer/branch  other than the one from where he had earlier availed of exchange facility, he is\nadvised to approach the same authorised dealer which had released exchange to him earlier.

It has now been decided that in\nsuch cases, it will be in order for authorised dealers to allow extension of time for import\nnot exceeding one month (three months in the case of capital imports) provided, the\nreasons for seeking extension of time are found convincing. In cases where the advance\nremittance has been made against a bank guarantee, the guarantee should be suitably\namended, if need be, to cover the extended period for import of goods into India.\n2.EEFC Accounts\nAttention of authorised  dealers is drawn to item 2 of A.D.

MAHESHWARAN\nChief General ManagerSlip 1\n[AD/MA/ 24  /1999]\nANNEXURE  I\nGuidelines for Indian Direct Investment in  Joint Ventures and\nWholly Owned Subsidiaries Abroad\n[Paragraph 9A.1]\nGovernment of India\nMinistry of Commerce\nN O T I F I C A T I O N\nFile No.4/1/93-EP(0I) 17th August, 1995\nIntroduction\n1.1 Guidelines for Indian direct investment in Joint Ventures and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries abroad\nreflect the need  for transparency, recognition of global developments, capturing of Indian realities and\nlearning of lessons from the past experience.\n1.1.1 Firstly, there is a need for a transparent policy framework to enable Indian businessmen to plan\ntheir business and to be able to react to potential collaborators outside the country.  Such transparency is\nalso required to enable the financial institutions and banks to assess their support through professional\njudgement in the context of financial sector reforms.  Further, the non-resident Indian community which is\nexpecting to play a strong role in globalising the Indian economy, in seeking a transparent policy.\n1.1.2 Secondly, there is a need for a formal recognition of the chan ging global reality.  These include:\nclose relationship between flow of investment and trade, increasing role of medium sized units; success in\nthe domestic economy as a precursor to success in the international arena; the importance of continuously\nupdating the technology through cross investments; more dynamic relation between market seeking and\nresource seeking investments; tendency for skill and service intensity rather than material intensity in the\ninternational flows ;  the importance of going behind the tariff walls erected by the emerging regional blocs;\nthe trend towards multi-country ownership of enterprises; and finally the emerging significance of ethnic\nlinks in international investment and trade.  It is also necessary to recognise that there can be a massive\noutflow of foreign investment by companies if not monitored carefully.\n1.1.3 Thirdly, the Indian realities relate to the new economic policies.  These include: strengthening\nglobalisation  of Indian economy by allowing the Indian entrepreneurship  to go global; being a capital\nimporting country, the need to avoid large capital outflows; visualising  the global economic relationship\nwell beyond physical exports; ensuring that Indian industry and business attain strategic positions in certain\nareas or regional blocs; increasing attention to Joint Ventures Abroad in third countries while finalising\nbilateral trade and economic relationships and the need for a more dynamic approach towards access to\nworld technology through all means including overseas investment.\n1.1.4 Fourthly, the lessons of experience have to be captured and a clear signal given about the new\npolicy framework.  The lessons of past experience include the low return on investment; large incidence of\nmortality after approval ;  low return on investment in the form of dividends; limited coverage and capital\nintensity of overseas investment, perhaps because they were linked with physical exports; inadequate\ncoverage of trading and the service sector till recently; difficulties in obtaining clearance for cash\nborrowings and guarantees by the parent company in India, resulting in cash crunch experienced by the\noverseas venture; inadequate interaction between Embassies and investors; lack of self-regulatory\nmechanism; a regulatory approach instead of facilitator or strategic  approach to overseas  investment;\nprocedural bottlenecks with  clearance being required  from  multiple agencies; and finally the impressionthat approval of the government includes clearance from the commercial  viability angle also and\nconsequently implying directed lending by banking institutions resulting in defaults to Indian banks.\n1.1.5 Liberalised outward investment procedures of 1992 have had a positive impact and approvals have\nincreased in number, range and innovativeness.\n1.2 The basic objectives of a transparent policy towards overseas investment from India through these\nguidelines are:\n(a) recognising the link between trade and investment flows, to provide a framework for\nIndian industry and business to access global networks.\n(b) to ensure that such flows, though determined by commercial interests, are consistent with\nthe macro-economic and balance of payment compulsions of the country, particularly in\nterms of the magnitude of the capital flows; and\n(c) to provide a transparent mechanism of knowing the priorities of the Government in\nregard to the overseas investment, so as to influence the stakeholders including financial\ninstitutions/banking sector and Embassies so that there is an understanding and alignment\nbetween macro-economic objectives and the individual business decisions.\n(d) to give liberal access to Indian business for technology- sourcing or resource-seeking or\nmarket-seeking as strategic responses to the emerging global opportunities for trade in\ngoods or services.\n(e) to give a signal that there is a  qualitative change in the approach of the Government,\nfrom one of regulator or controller to one of facilitator.\n(f) to encourage the Indian industry to  adopt a spirit of self-regulation and  collective effort\nfor improving the image of Indian industry abroad.\n1.3 In the light of the above, the following guidelines are issued to elaborate the policy framework in\nthe EXIM-policy.  The Reserve Bank of India will accord all necessary approvals and monitor the progress\nby prescribing the reporting obligations.\nApplicability\n2.1 These guidelines shall apply to direct investment by Indian parties in joint ventures ( JVs) and\nwholly owned subsidiaries ( WOSs) abroad (hereinafter referred to as \"foreign concerns\").

Accordingly, it has been decided to allow scheduled commercial banks (excluding Regional Rural\nBanks), primary dealers and all-India financial institutions to undertake Forward Rate Agreements/Interest\nRate Swaps ( FRAs/IRS) as a product for their own balance sheet management and for market making\npurposes.  Participants who intend to undertake FRAs/IRS are, however, advised that before undertaking\nmarket making activity, they should ensure that appropriate infrastructure and risk management systems\nare put in place.  Further, participants should also set up sound internal control system whereby a clear\nfunctional separation of trading, settlement, monitoring and control and accounting activities is provided.\n3. Guidelines on FRAs/IRS formulated in consultation with market participants are attached.\n4. Kindly acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(K.Kanagasabapathy)\nAdviser-in-Charge\nEncls: As aboveForward Rate Agreements and\nInterest Rate Swaps  \u2013 Guidelines\nDeregulation of interest rates which helped in making financial market operations efficient and cost\neffective has brought to the fore a wide array of risks  faced by the market participants. To manage and\ncontrol these risks, there has been a felt need for an appropriate financial instrument. Forward Rate\nAgreement (FRA) and Interest Rate Swap (IRS) are such instruments which can provide effective hedge\nagainst interest rate risks. To enable the market to use FRAs/ IRS and for smooth development of these\nproducts, guidelines for FRAs/ IRS have been formulated and are set out below:\nDescription of the product\n2. A Forward Rate Agreement or an I nterest Rate Swap provides means for hedging the interest\nrate risk arising on account of lendings or borrowings made at fixed/ variable interest rates.\n3.  A Forward Rate Agreement (FRA) is a financial contract between two parties to exchange interest\npayments for a `notional principal\u2019 amount on settlement date, for a specified period from start date to\nmaturity date.  Accordingly, on the settlement date, cash payments based on contract (fixed) and the\nsettlement rate, are made by the parties to one another.  The settlement rate is the agreed bench-mark/\nreference rate prevailing on the settlement date.\n4. An Interest Rate Swap (IRS) is a financial contract between two parties exchanging or swapping\na stream of interest payments for a `notional principal\u2019 amount on multiple occasions during a specified\nperiod. Such contracts generally involve exchange of a `fixed to floating\u2019 or `floating to floating\u2019 rates of\ninterest. Accordingly, on each payment date - that occurs during the swap period - cash payments based\non fixed/ floating and floating rates, are made by the parties to one another.\nParticipants\n5. Scheduled commercial banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks), primary dealers ( PDs) and all-\nIndia financial institutions ( FIs) are free to undertake FRAs/ IRS as a product for their own balance sheet\nmanagement or for market making. Banks/ FIs/ PDs can also offer these products to corporates for\nhedging their ( corporates) own balance sheet exposures. No specific permission from Reserve Bank\nwould be required to undertake FRAs/ IRS. However, participants when they start undertaking such\ntransactions, will be required to inform Monetary Policy Department (MPD), Reserve Bank of India and\nabide by such reporting requirements as prescribed by the Reserve Bank from time to time.\n6. Participants undertaking FRAs/ IRS are, however, advised that before undertaking market making\nactivity in FRAs/ IRS, they should ensure that appropriate infrastructure and risk management systems\nsuch as ability to price the product and mark to market their positions, monitor and limit exposures on an\nongoing basis, etc., are put in place.\nTypes of FRAs/ IRS\n7.  Banks/ PDs/ FIs can undertake different types of plain vanilla FRAs/ IRS. Swaps having explicit/\nimplicit option features such as  caps/ floors/ collars are not permitted.\nBench Mark Rate\n8. The benchmark rate should necessarily evolve on its own in the market and require market\nacceptance. The parties are therefore, free to use any domestic money or debt market rate as benchmark\nrate for entering into FRAs/ IRS, provided methodology of computing the rate is objective, transparent and\nmutually acceptable to counterparties.\nSize\n9. There will be no restriction on the minimum or maximum size of `notional principal \u2019 amounts of\nFRAs/ IRS. Norms with regard to size are expected to emerge in the market with the development of the\nproduct.\nTenor\n10. There will be no restriction on the minimum or maximum tenor of the FRAs/ IRS.\nCapital Adequacy\n11. Banks and fina ncial institutions are required to maintain capital for FRAs/ IRS, as per the\nstipulations contained in Annexure 1. Primary dealers should follow the norms as indicated in Annexure 2.\nExposure Limits\n12.  Banks, FIs and PDs have to arrive at the credit equivalent amount for the purposes of reckoning\nexposure to a counterparty . For this purpose participants may apply the conversion factors to notional\nprincipal amounts as per the original exposure method prescribed in Annexures 1 and 2. The exposure\nshould be within sub-limit to be fixed for FRAs/ IRS to corporates/ banks/ FIs/ PDs by the participantsconcerned. In case of banks and FIs, the exposure on account of  FRAs/ IRS together with other credit\nexposures should be within single/ group borrower limits as prescribed by RBI.\n13.  Further, while dealing with corporates, banks/ FIs/ PDs should exercise due diligence to ensure\nthat they ( corporates) are undertaking FRAs/ IRS only for hedging their own rupee balance sheet\nexposures. Banks/ FIs/ PDs are advised to also obtain a certificate from the authorised signatory/\nsignatories of corporate/s to the effect that the transactions undertaken by them are meant for hedging\nbalance sheet exposures only, i.e., size and tenor of the transactions undertaken are not in excess of\ntheir underlying rupee exposures.\nSwap Position\n14. Ideally, participants should undertake FRAs/ IRS only for hedging underlying genuine exposures.\nHowever, recognising the crucial role played by the market maker in development of the product and\ncreating of the market itself ,  participants have been allowed to undertake market making activity, which\nwould involve at times dealing in the market without underlying exposure. However to ensure that market\nmakers do not over extend themselves, market makers are required to place prudential limits on swap\npositions, which may arise on account of market making activity.\n15.     Scheduled commercial banks, should place various components of assets, liabilities and off-\nbalance sheet positions (including FRAs, IRS) in different time buckets and fix prudential limits on\nindividual gaps as per the procedure laid down in the Reserve Bank of India Circular No. BP.BC.\n8/21.04.098 dated February 10, 1999, on ALM system. The FRAs/ IRS, etc. undertaken by banks will\nhave to be within the prudential limits for different time buckets, approved by Boards/ Management\nCommittees of banks.\n16. Primary Dealers / Financial Institutions should identify swap positions in each maturity bucket and\nplace prudential limits with the approval of their respective boards.\n17.  The prudential limits on swap positions, as detailed in paragraph 16, will require vetting by the\nReserve Bank after approval of respective boards, as mentioned below.\nInstitution Reserve Bank\u2019s Department\nPrimary Dealers Internal Debt Management Cell\nFinancial Institutions Financial Institutions Division, Department of Banking Supervision\n18.  While the above procedures for setting up of limits on `swap positions\u2019 and exposure limits  may\nform the bottomline for the risk management, participants who can employ more sophisticated methods\nsuch as Value at Risk ( VaR) and Potential Credit Exposure (PCE) may do so. They are, however, advised\nto report the methods followed for VaR/ PCE to Monetary Policy Department with a copy to the respective\ndepartments of RBI as mentioned below:\nInstitution Reserve Bank\u2019s Department/ s\nScheduled Commercial Bank Department of Banking Supervision and Department of Banking\nOperations and Development\nPrimary Dealers Internal Debt Management Cell\nFinancial Institutions Financial Institutions Division, Department of Banking Supervision\nAccounting and Valuation\n19. Transactions for hedging and market making purposes should be recorded separately. Whi le\ntransactions for market making purposes should be marked to market (at least at fortnightly intervals),\nthose for hedging purposes could be accounted for on accrual basis. For valuation purposes, the\nrespective boards should lay down an appropriate policy to reflect the fair value of the outstanding\ncontracts. Participants should adopt suitable norms for accounting of FRAs/ IRS, on the basis of general\naccounting principles set out in Annexure 3, after the approval of their respective boards.\nDocumentation\n20.  For the sake of uniformity and standardisation, participants could consider   using ISDA\ndocumentation, as suitably modified to comply with these guidelines for undertaking FRAs/ IRS\ntransactions. Participants may also consider the changes as suggested in the Annexure - 4 before\nfinalising the documentation but after seeking appropriate legal advice. Institutions should further evaluate\nwhether the counterparty has the legal capacity, power and authority to enter into  FRAs/ IRS\ntransactions.\nInternal Control\n21. Participants should set up sound internal control system. They should provide for a clear\nfunctional separation of front and back offices relating to hedging and market making activities. Similarly,\nfunctional separation of trading, settlement, monitoring and control and accounting activities should also\nbe provided. The deals should be subjected to concurrent audit and result should be intimated to top\nmanagement of the institution regularly.22.  A copy of the document detailing Product Policy and Internal Control System should be submitted\nto the Monetary Policy Department and to the respective departments of Reserve Bank as mentioned in\nparagraph 18 above.\nReporting\n23. Participants are required to report, as per the proforma indicated in Annexure - 5, their FRAs/ IRS\noperations on a fortnightly basis to Adviser-in-Charge, Monetary Policy Department, Reserve Bank of\nIndia, with a copy to respective departments as mentioned in paragraph 18 above.\n24.  These guidelines are intended to form the basis for development of Rupee derivative products such\nas FRAs/ IRS in the country. The guidelines are subject to review, on the basis of development of FRAs/\nIRS market.Annexure  -  1\nCapital adequacy norms applicable to banks and\nfinancial institutions for undertaking FRAs/ IRS\nFor reckoning the minimum capital ratio, the computation of risk weighted assets on account of FRAs/\nIRS should be done as per the two steps procedure set out below:\nStep 1:\nThe notional principal amount of each instrument is to be multiplied by the conversion factor given below:\nOriginal maturity Conversion factor\nLess than one year 0.5 per cent\nOne year and less than two years 1.0 per cent\nFor each additional year 1.0 per cent\nStep 2:\nThe adjusted value thus obtained shall be multiplied by the risk weightage alloted to the relevant\ncounterparty as specified below:\nBanks/ All India Financial Institutions 20 per cent\nAll others (except Governments) 100 per centAnnexure  - 2\nCapital Adequacy for Primary Dealers on\nInterest Rate Contracts for Credit Risk\nPrimary dealers undertaking Forward Rate Agreements and Interest Rate Swaps, will be required\nto fulfill the following minimum capital/ capital adequacy requirements:\nOver and above the mi nimum net owned funds, as defined under paragraph 4 of the `Guidelines\nfor Primary Dealers in the Government Securities Market\u2019, Primary Dealers will have to maintain\nadditional capital at 12 per cent of Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) towards credit risk on Interest Rate\nContracts. The methodology for these off-balance sheet items will be as under, notwithstanding what is\nstated in paragraph 6 (iii) of the `Guidelines for Primary Dealers in the Government Securities Market\u2019:\n(i)The notional principal amount will be multiplied by the conversion\nfactors given below to arrive at the adjusted value.\n@0.5 per cent of notional principal value for original maturity of less than 1year\n@1.0 per cent for original maturity of one year and less than two years\n@1.0 per cent for each additional year.\n(ii)The adjusted value thus obtained shall be multiplied by the risk weight applicable to the counter party\nas specified below:\nBanks/ Financial Institutions 20 per cent\nAll others (except Governments) 100 per centAnnexure  - 3\nParticipants may adopt suitable norms for accounting of Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Rate\nAgreements after the approval of their respective boards. Following may be used as general principles for\nframing such accounting norms:\nHedge Swaps\n(i) Interest Rate Swap which hedges interest bearing asset or liability should generally be accounted\nfor like the hedge of the asset or liability.\n(ii) The Swap that is accounted for like a hedge should be accounted for on accrual basis except the\nswap designated with an asset or liability that is carried at market value or lower of cost or market\nvalue in the financial statements.  In that case the swap should be  marked to market with the\nresulting gain or loss recorded as an adjustment to the market value of designated asset or\nliability.\n(iii) Gains or losses on the termination of swaps should be recognised when the offsetting gain or\nloss is recognised on the designated asset or liability.  This implies that any gain or loss on the\nterminated swap would be deferred and recognised over the shorter of the remaining contractual\nlife of the swap or the remaining life of the asset/liability.\n(iv) Redesignation of Hedge items\nIf a hedge is redesignated from one item of asset/liability to another item of asset/liability such\nredesignation should be accounted for as the termination of one hedge and acquisition of another.  On\nthe date of redesignation the swap should be marked to market and the mark to market value would be\namortized over the shorter period of the remaining life of the swap or remaining life of the asset/liability.\nThe offsetting mark to market entry adjustments would be treated as premium received or paid for hedge\non the newly designated item of asset/liability and this would be amortized over the life of the\nredesignated asset/liability or remaining term of the swap whichever is shorter.\n(v) When participant is acting like a broker for matching parties and is not a Principal to the contract\nitself, then the fee should be  recognised immediately as an income.  In case where the bank acts\nlike a Principal the fee should be amortized over the life of the contract.\nAccounting for trading positions\nThe following should be used as general principles for accounting of trading transactions:\n(i) Trading swaps should be marked to market with changes recorded in the income statement.\n(ii) Income and expenses relating to these swaps should be recognised on the settlement date.\n(iii) Fee should be recognised as immediate income or expenditure.\n(iv) Gains or losses on the termination of the swaps should be recorded as immediate income or\nexpenses.\nDisclosures\nThe following should be disclosed in the note to the balance sheet :\n\u2022 the notional principal of swap agreements;\n\u2022 nature and terms of the swaps including information on credit and market risk and the accounting\npolicies adopted for recording the swaps;\n\u2022 quantification of the losses which would be incurred if counterparties failed to fulfil their obligation\nunder the agreement;\n\u2022 collateral required by the entity upon entering into swaps;\n\u2022 any concentration of credit risk arising from the swaps.  Examples of concentration could be\nexposures to particular industries or swaps with highly geared companies; and\n\u2022 the \u201cfair\u201d value of the total swaps book.  If the swaps are linked to specific assets, liabilities or\ncommitments, the fair value would be the estimated amount that the entity would receive or pay to\nterminate the swap agreements at balance date.  For a trading swap the fair value would be its mark to\nmarket value.ANNEXURE  - 4\nThe following changes may be made in the ISDA Master Agreement :\n(i) In Clause 8 (a) the words \"Subject to the laws and prevailing guidelines in India\" may be inserted\nat the beginning.\n(ii) The words \"Stamp Tax\" wherever appearing in the Agreement may be substituted by the words\n\"Stamp Duty\".\nThere is a reference to Credit Support Document and Credit Support Provider in the document.\nIn case any further documents/agreements are required to be executed under the given transactions, the\nprovisions of the same will have to be drafted keeping in mind the prevailing laws and guidelines.\nHowever, in cases where no further documents are to be executed the reference to the same and to the\nprovisions relating to Credit Support Default in the Agreement may be deleted.  This may be done in the\nSchedule to the Agreement rather than the main Master Agreement.  Similarly, if any, further changes are\ndesired to be made to meet specific requirements of participants, it is desirable to do so in the Schedule\nrather than the main Master Agreement.\nClause 13(a) of the Agreement provides that the Agreement will be governed by and construed in\naccordance with the law specified in the Schedule.  Hence, the applicable law will have to be mentioned\nin the Schedule to the Agreement.  Participants may specify the applicable Law (e.g. Indian Law or\nEnglish Law or US Law) as deemed appropriate by them, in the Schedule.\nIt may be further clarified that the change suggested in Clause 8(a) is only clarificatory  in as much as all\npayments would in any case be subject to any Indian Laws or guidelines.  The provision made in Clause\n13 regarding applicable laws and jurisdiction stipulates the law that would apply to decide any dispute\nbetween the parties.  Counterparties are free to modify the ISDA Master Agreement by inserting suitable\nclauses in the schedule to the ISDA Master to reflect the terms that the counterparties may agree to,\nincluding the manner of settlement of transactions and choice of governing law of the Agreement.\nIt may be mentioned that besides the ISDA Master Agreement, participants should obtain specific\nconfirmation for each transaction which should detail the terms of the contract such as gross amount,\nrate, value date, etc. duly signed by the authorised signatories.  It is also preferable to make a mention of\nthe Master Agreement in the individual transaction confirmation.Annexure - 5\nFORTNIGHTLY RETURN ON FORWARD RATE\nAGREEMENTS /  INTEREST RATE SWAPS\nName of the Bank/ Institution:\nFortnight ended:\n_________________________________________________________________________\n1.Gross Notional Amount  ( Rs.

The concerned authorised dealer may allow the\nremittance of surplus funds provided the company has produced the necessary undertaking/certificate regarding\npayment of income-tax (cf. paragraph 3B.10). Before allowing the remittance, the bank should verify that the\nconcerned airline has obtained the necessary permission from Reserve Bank under Section 29 of FERA 1973 forcarrying on their commercial activity in India and also advise the concerned airline company that discrepant\namounts noticed during the scrutiny of the statements by Reserve Bank or the amount remitted in excess of its\nentitlement should be brought to India immediately by the airline company concerned by inward remittance and\nno adjustment from other surplus funds held/future accretions, etc. would be permitted.

This has assumed urgency in view of the\nshort time available before the advent of Year 2000. The decision regarding appropriate\ncontingency measures would be the responsibility of the Board of Directors of the bank/\ninstitution concerned. As a measure of additional guidance, banks/ institutions are advised\nthat, apart from the general framework and other core considerations suggested by us, it may\nbe prudent to prepare hard copies of their books and customer accounts as on December 31,\n1999 to facilitate business continuity across the millennium. Clear hard copy back-up of pick-\nup, delivery, payment and receipt schedules in respect of treasury related operations should\nalso be maintained so that there is no default in meeting contractual product delivery or\npayment obligations due to Y2K induced disruptions.\nBanks should also keep adequate physical cash in hand on December 30 and 31, 1999 so that\nin the event of any contingency, cash transactions can be assured on those days as also for\nsubsequent days in January 2000.\nYour contingency plans need to be tested and constantly updated to address different Year\n2000 scenarios that may be envisaged through analysis.

In terms of the broad\nremediation framework communicated by us, banks were expected to put in place appropriate\ntime bound strategies to assess, convert, validate and implement fully compliant systems by\nDecember 31, 1998. Banks were also advised to work on a contingency plan to assure\nbusiness continuity in the event of vendor default or unforeseen Year 2000 induced\nbreakdown. Banks are expected to complete this exercise by March 31, 1999 and forward to\nus a copy of their Contingency Plans duly approved by their Board of Directors.\n2. From the feedback received from banks, we are concerned to note that some of the banks\nare lagging behind in their compliance efforts. We would like to once again impress upon you\nthat the Year 2000 problem is more than a technical issue and has serious business related\nimplications. Apart from business continuity problems for the bank and loss to customers,\nY2K non-compliance also has serious system-wide consequences. Hence we have been\nalways emphasising that the issue needs the attention and commitment of the top\nmanagement. Banks were also advised to ensure adequate budgets for their Year 2000\nprogrammes.\n3. In order to ensure that Y2K issues are adequately addressed by each bank and keeping in\nview international supervisory practices in this regard, the Reserve Bank of India has decided\non a set of enforcement measures in the event of compliance efforts of individual banks being\nassessed by us as being less than satisfactory. While specific course of action will be decided\nby the Reserve Bank taking into account the findings of the on-site inspections and\ninformation contained in the monthly reports submitted by banks, the enforcement measures\nmay include one or combinations of the following:\n\u2022 Issue Supervisory Letter of Caution\n\u2022 Impose higher CRAR\n\u2022 Impose monetary penalties on a graduated scale as may be decided on a case by case\nbasis\n\u2022 Restricting expansionary strategies of banks like opening new branches, subsidiaries\n\u2022 Y2K compliance will be an over-riding criterion while evaluating the performance of the\nChairman/ Managing Director/ Chief Executive\n\u2022 Suspension from participation from Call Money Markets, Clearing, Securities Trading\n4. It is needless to emphasise that the responsibility to appropriately address the Y2K\nproblem within each institution, its subsidiaries and external linkages/ interfaces would solely\nrest with the Top Management and Board of Directors. In the light of the impending penal\nmeasures proposed by the Reserve Bank of India, it is expected that banks will review their\ncompliance strategies to make their systems Y2K compliant and develop appropriate\ncontingency plans well before the terminal deadline, i.e. 31st March 1999.2Yours faithfully\nSd/-\n(Khizer Ahmed)\nExecutive Director", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/7386.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 24, 1999", "info": "Ref DBS.

While many newer applications are Year 2000\ncomplaint, many older applications upon which compliant application is Year 2000 compliant\nwithout appropriate analysis and testing poses substantial risks.\n2.Further complexities to the issued are introduced by others considerations such as the\nuse of reserved values such as using 99 in the some way. Even before 2000 is reached, some\napplications will start behaving badly as, in this example, records for the year 1999 will be\ntreated as special files and handled other than normally. Finally, all programs will need to be\nchecked to see that leap year is properly handled in 2000.2\n3.There is no single way of fixing existing applications or databases. Two of the most\ncommon approaches are to add two digits to the year field (CCYYMMDD) or a technique\ncalled windowing, which analyses the two digit year field and automatically recognises year\nunder a specified number (say 60) as being 20yy while yeas over the number are recognised\nas being 19yy 3. Other fixes are also appropriate as permanent or temporary measures to\naddress particular applications.\n4.Applications affect all areas of the business: the front office, the middle and back\noffices, the customer delivery system and management information and decision support\nsystems. Because applications are frequently interdependent on each other all\ninterdependencies must be identified and thoroughly tested every time one element in the\nchain is modified.\n5.Making the appropriate changes is complex. Different situations require different\nsolutions.  Adding two digits affects the amount of memory and storage space needed and can\naffect performance with larger records to process.  Windowing requires added calculations\nwhenever a date is encountered and can affect performance. Either approach can affect how\none application interacts with another. For example, if a four-digit representation for the year\nis chosen, linking applications that expect to receive only two digits will require further\nmodifications to assure correct communication. Every time an application is modified to be\nYear 2000 compliant, it will have to be tested against every other application with which\nthere are linkages. Such testing has to be done not only internally but also with\ncorrespondents and customers to assure that interdependencies work properly. Because\ncompliant applications become ready to be implemented on a sequential basis, testing will be\nan ongoing and repetitive process.\nAreas Affected\n6.The potential for Year 2000 problems pervades virtually every area of an institution.\nApplications relying on dates are clearly vulnerable. However, many applications that do not\nappear to rely on dates use dates in ways that are often not apparent to the user such as in filenaming conventions or where the date is part of a key. Wherever dates are used, they must be\nidentified; checked for being compliant and addressed by appropriate change when necessary.\n7.All applications are vulnerable regardless of whether they are developed internally or\nexternally.  Applications developed by third parties may be especially vulnerable because\nreliance must be placed on someone else to make the necessary changes. After changes are\nmade, a bank must test the application to see that it works properly in its unique environment.\nTesting is essential because vendor applications almost always require current or at least\nrecent releases for operating systems or utilities upon which the application depends. If a\nbank is not current in its version control, compliant applications may fail.\n8.Computer operating systems are v ulnerable because dates play a crucial role in file\nmaintenance and performance optimisation routines that are invisible to the user. Access\ncontrol and security systems are affected and could lock out users both logically from\nautomated applications and physically from buildings or departmental areas.\n9.hardware is also affected. Mainframes are particularly vulnerable as individual\ncomponents may be of widely different vintages and single non-compliant component could\naffect the entire system. Mini-computers and PCs may also be affected. ATM machines or\ncommunications equipment have built in dating features that must be identified, tested, and\ncorrected where necessary.\n10.Internal communications networks and public carriers have many date sensitive\ncomponents. Assuring that all problems are identified and made compliant requires carefully\ndesigned tests involving both applications and the network/carrier. Environmental and other\nsystems (heating and cooling systems, elevators, vaults, facsimile machines, etc.) also may\nhave both date sensitive software and hardware with embedded computer chips that may have\nhidden date sensitive elements.\nRisks and costs\n11.Significant risks exist in not making all necessary changes and thoroughly testing\nsystems. Operational risks are obvious. Failure to have fully operational automated systems\ncan prevent even simple business functions from being completed because manual or other\nalternatives may not be feasible if processing volumes are sizeable or information exchanges\nare extensive.\n12.Any operational problems immediately become reputational and legal risks as\ncorrespondents and clients react to business problems. If significant banks face problems, the\nsystemic implications could be extensive. Consultants estimate that legal costs along could be\nin the hundreds of billions of dollars if problems are extensive in the industry. Such estimates\nclearly suggest the magnitude of the strategic risk faced by a bank and the industry more\ngenerally.\n13.Because correspond ents and customers are also subject to the Year 2000 issue, they\ntoo must make the necessary changes to conduct business normally. Testing normal\nconnectivity and message transfers with correspondents and customers is essential but not\nenough. If they have not also made the necessary adjustments to their own systems, they\ncould pose credit and liquidity risks to the bank.  Credit officers need to understand the Year\n2000 risks faced by their customers and how well their customers are managing these risks.Current financial performance will not be an indication of future performance for\norganisations that have not developed sound plans and provided for appropriate resources to\ncarry them out.\n14.The costs that the banking industry will need to incur to addr ess the Year 2000 are\nextensive. The Gartner Group has publicly estimated that it will cost between US$300 \u2013\nUS$600 billion worldwide just to complete needed changes and testing. Every line of code in\nevery program needs to be reviewed at costs typically estimated at about US$1 per line. costs\nfor global banks are frequently estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Smaller\nbanks with few in-house developed applications will still incur substantial costs to test\nthoroughly applications modified by others.\n15.Skilled technical resources are already scarce and will become even scarcer as the\ndeadline approaches. Already salaries for certain specialists are rising and key staff are being\nbid away by other companies. Consultants with top reputations are accepted only on a very\nselective basis. As time passes, banks will be forced to turn to consultants with little or no\ndemonstrated performance record and uncertain futures.\n16.Test facilities also can pose a challenge. Establishing a test environment for live\ntesting using dates in the year 2000 is not easily done. If possible, dedicates systems should\nbe used. Alternatively, a production system might be shut down and re-established for the\nYear 2000 testing, but such an approach can pose significant risks because moving an\nadvanced date backwards (i.e. from 20xx to 19xx) for the operating systems is often a\ndifficult and time consuming process. Also the number of weekends and holidays available to\nconduct testing is constantly shrinking. Renting computer time from third parties service\nproviders may be possible but like consultants, their resources are being booked rapidly.\n17.Testing will also be more difficult than usual. First, there will be competing demands\nfor test environments. New applications like those related to the Euro or replacing fractions\nwith decimals in trading activities will require testing in current environments. Yet given the\nimportance of these applications and their interdependencies with other applications that must\nbe tested for Year 2000 compliance, strategies will have to be developed for testing in both\ncurrent and Year 2000 environments. Test data will need to be specially developed. Because\ntesting is primarily a business line activity, business line resources will be under heavy\npressure.\n18.The Year 2000 is sufficiently complex that it should not be combined with other\nmaintenance or software changes in the application. If problems are encountered, determining\nwhether the Year 2000 or other changes are causing the problems can become extremely\ndifficult. Many organisations are freezing other projects until the Year 2000 is addressed to\nminimise difficulties in tracking problems although such freezes are probably impractical for\nlong periods of time.\nAppendix B\nAction Plans for Managing the Year 2000 Process in More Detail\nDeveloping a strategic approach\n1.  Making sure that an appropriate strategic approach is developed by determining how bestto achieve Year 2000 compliance within an Institution\u2019s organisational structure represents\nthe first phase .   This phase includes an initial, high level sizing of the issue and developing a\nplan as to how best introduce the process throughout the organisation. This phase often relies\nheavily on technical staff knowledge of how information systems and technology are\ndeployed and how business units are organised and interact with limited contact with\nbusiness line areas. During this initial planning process, particular attention should be paid to\nassuring that during the organisational awareness phase, business lines will develop an\nunderstanding that the Year 2000 issue is not only a technical issue but a strategic one for\neach business line and that the business lines have ultimate ownership of the issue.\nCreating organisational awareness\n2.  Making certain that the strategic importance of the Year 2000 as a business objective is\nunderstood and appreciated throughout the organisation may be the most important phase in\nthe action plan. This phase has four basic objectives ; creating visibility, ensuring\ncommitment, identifying resources and formulating specific strategic objectives at a business\nline level.\n3. Creating visibility throughout the business organisation is essential. Everyone must be\naware of the potential problems posed by the date issue and become sensitive to applications\nwhere it might be an issue. Only in this way will all local applications be identified and\naddressed appropriately.\n4. The recognition that the Year 2000 may be a survival issue requires a commitment from\ntop management for its successful resolution as a strategic priority. Senior management and\ndirectors need to understand the issue and its implications and monitor progress on a regular\nbasis. Specific responsibility for managing the issue should be clearly assigned. For larger\norganisations, a project office focused solely on the Year 2000 issue is recommended.\nPartnerships between technical staff and business lines must be developed with the business\nline managers accepting ultimate accountability to address the issue successfully.\n5. Resource estimates need to be determined and built into budgets. Business lines need to\nrecognise that testing will be the single most important resource intensive part of the project 4\nand that responsibility for designing test plans and carrying out the tests rest with the\nbusiness. Senior management must appreciate that operations and budgets. All applications\nthroughout the bank must be addressed but some level of required maintenance and new\nproduct development must typically proceed.\n6. Strategic decisions must be made at this stage because technology and business line\nresources will have to be redeployed. Opportunities exist to repair, replace, outsource or\neliminate applications. Senior level guidance on how to make these decisions becomes\ncritical.\nAssessing actions and developing  detailed plans\n7.  This phase moves the project from concept to concrete actions. Detailed inventories of\nwhat must be done are developed covering centralised and decentralised hardware, software\nand networks as well as equipment with embedded computer chips and logic. Particular care\nis needed to make sure  that applications developed or procured locally at the business line\nlevel are included in the inventory. The inventories should include all aspects of business lineactivities whether internal to the organisation or external to it. Risks should be quantified and\npriorities set based on these risks. 5\n8. Internal partnerships between technical staff and business lines should be solidified. The\nresponsibilities of each should be clearly defined and timetables agreed upon.  Producers for\nmonitoring progress against schedules should be implemented with appropriate information\nflowing to senior management and directors on a regular basis.\n9. Vendors and service providers should be contacted as to their status and plans for\naddressing the issue and contracts developed where appropriate. User groups can be helpful\nin making such contacts and getting information but are no substitute for an organisation\nfollowing through with the information received. Applications must be able to work within\nthe bank\u2019s own operating environment and responsibility for seeing that appropriate testing is\ndone cannot be delegated to vendors or user groups. Making certain that current versions of\nsoftware and operating systems are in place is particularly important because compliant\napplications may not work properly in a dated environment.6\n10. Vendor management requires special attention and represents a continuous challenge\nthroughout Year 2000 projects. Obtaining meaningful dates for product delivery, testing or\nother milestones is often particularly difficult, as vendors are concerned about the legal\nliability that may be associated with representations that prove to be in error. Notwithstanding\nthis difficulty, the development of effective communication channels with vendors is\nessential.\n11. During the assessment phase, one or more applications might be made year 2000\ncompliant on an expedited basis.  Such pilots will help staff develop a better understanding of\nthe work that must be done and permit better plans and budgets to be developed. Also,\nautomated tools that help identify where dates are present should be tested as to their\neffectiveness.\n12. This phase also should include a review of legal obligations. In particular, contracts with\nvendors and service providers should be reviewed as to respective responsibilities of the third\nparty vendor. Insurance policies should be reviewed to see how Year 2000 problems would\nbe handled if problems were to be encountered under various scenarios.\n13. The development of detailed plans for the entire project should be the principal end\nproduct of the assessment phase. These plans need to address not only the changes that need\nto be made but also lay out key milestones, test plans and communication channels. The plans\nneed to deal with internally developed applications whether centralised or decentralised with\nservice providers and vendors and with correspondents and customers. Responsibilities and\naccountabilities need to be clearly defined for each step in the plans. The critical path within\nthe overall plan needs to be determined; recognising that there will be many\ninterdependencies that must be tested together.\nRenovating systems, applications and equipment\n14. Renovating systems, applications and equipment is the only phase of the process that is\nprimarily technical. During this phase, the additional resources needed for the project should\nbe acquired or contracted. Operating systems, applications, hardware and equipment needingfixing should be modified, replaced, outsourced or discontinued.  Automated tools and\noutside consultants probably have a role to play in most organisations during this phase.\n15. In depth communication with vendors and careful monitoring of their progress occurs\nduring this phase. In particular, a clear understanding of what the vendor means by being\nYear 2000 compliant must be obtained. This includes detailed knowledge of any\nenvironmental assumptions and planned changes in communications protocols.  Agreement\nmust be reached regarding the level of assistance the vendor will offer if problems are\nencountered. While a warranty or certification may be sought or offered the bank must\nrecognise that such certification will almost certainly not cover interfaces with other\napplications and that the need for rigorous testing is not obviated by such a warranty or\ncertification.\n16. Identifying alternative approaches if renovations lag or fall is an important part of this\nstep. Again, such contingency plans should deal not only with internal renovation work but\nalso address the work of vendors and service providers as well as correspondents and\ncustomers with whom the institution interfaces. Contingency plans must include critical\nmilestones for measuring progress or critical delivery dates where decisions must be made to\npursue an alternative solution if the objective is not met. contingency plans need to take into\naccount the mission critically of applications because, in all likelihood as the time certain\ndeadline approaches,  it will become impossible to fully implement all changes for all\napplications. Contingency plans need to recognise that in some cases, correspondent\nrelationship may need to be altered or customer relationships served.\nValidating the renovation through testing\n17. Testing represents the largest single task in the Year 2000 project.  Detailed test schedules\nmust be developed and coordinated with correspondents and customers, particularly with an\never-decreasing number of weekend testing opportunities available. Full validation requires\nthat Year 2000 data conditions be simulated for all elements of the test. Data flow internally\nand with third parties must be thoroughly tested while both the sender and received simulate\nYear 2000 conditions. Institutions need to participate in tests with service providers both on a\nbilateral test basis and in multi-user tests, which simulate full production volumes.\ncontingency plans need to be implemented as needed when renovations are completed by\nspecified cut-off dates.\n18. During this phase, support facilities to assure that new or modified applications run\nproperly are also developed. In particular, procedure manuals are written or rewritten and\ndisseminated, training programs provided and help desks established or retrained.\nImplementing tested, compliant systems\n19. Implementation requires careful planning to make sure that interrelated applications are\ncoordinated as to when they go into production. Coordination becomes particularly important\nwhen files at interfaces are changing in format. While recognising that coordination is\nnecessary, putting compliant applications into production at the earliest possible date\nsimplifies future testing.\n20.  The implementation phase also required monitoring of progress by service providers and\nvendors. Service providers in particular are likely to have two or more versions of anapplication at any one time in order to meet the needs of institutions in various stages of\nimplementation.\n21. The implementation phase also includes reverting to contingency plans when necessary.\nAppendix C\nChecklist for a Successful Year 2000 Program\nBuilding a successful Year 2000 program requires that a bank addresses a number of key\nfactors and takes appropriate steps to address them.  These factors include:\n\u2022 Top Management understanding and endorsement as a strategic priority.\n\u2022 Line management appreciation that it is not just a technical issue but potentially one of\nbusiness survival.\n\u2022 Explicit assignment of responsibility for the Year 2000 project and empowerment to carry\nit out.\n\u2022 Detailed planning with the recognition that testing will be the most resource intensive part\nof the process.\n\u2022 Appreciation that external testing may be among the most difficult parts of the process.\n\u2022 Recognition that vendors and service providers cannot certify that their products will\nwork properly with a bank\u2019s own applications, equipment and operating environment.\n\u2022 Proactive communication with external vendors and service providers, and\ncorrespondents and customers.\n\u2022 Prioritisation of applications as to their strategic importance.\n\u2022 Identification of explicit resources to address the Year 2000 issues consistent with\nbusiness priorities.\n\u2022 Establishment of explicit target dates for milestones and regular reports to top\nmanagement of progress.\n\u2022 Active involvement of audit in the Year 2000 process.\n\u2022 Clear contingency plans with trigger dates and procedures for implementation.\n\u2022 Strong monitoring of security controls throughout the process.\n2.Under current calendar conventions, years ending in 00 are generally not leap years, even though evenly\ndivisible by 4.  The exception is for centuries that are themselves divisible by 4.  Thus, 2000 represents theexception to the exception regarding leap year determination.\n3.If date ranges span more than 200 years (e.g. when birthdates are part of a database), windowing is not a\nfeasible solution.\n4.Consultants estimate that testing wi ll constitute anywhere from 45% to 70% of total Year 2000 costs.\n5.The risk assessment and prioritisation process is particularly important because, in all likelihood for some\ninstitutions, resource limitations and inevitable problems will mean that some applications will not be Year 2000\ncomplaint when the century date change occurs.\n6.For organisations that do not have maintenance contracts on some or all of their equipment or software,\nversion release issues may significantly expand the resources needed to become Year 2000 compliance .", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/7381.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 24, 1999", "info": "Ref DBS.

At the current juncture, the development of infrastructure in\nIndia, particularly in the key sectors like power, telecommunications, roads and ports ,  is\ncritical. The Government of India and Reserve Bank of India have, therefore, accorded top\npriority for infrastructure development, with an enabling policy framework for participation\nby private sector.  As a supplement to  the Reserve Bank\u2019s policy in post-April 1997 period\n(viz. bestowing operational freedom to banks in the matter of credit dispensation) and  in\nview of the national importance attached to infrastructure development, it is considered\nnecessary to address important  aspects involved in the financing of infrastructure projects\nand to set out operational guidelines which the financing banks/institutions should bear in\nmind while extending credit for such projects.  These operational guidelines are enumerated\nin the following paragraphs .\n3.  Modalities of Financing\n     Infrastructure Projects\n3.1Coverage\nInfrastructure  in a sense would include sectors such as  power, telecommunications,\nroads, ports, airports, water supply, waterways and  urban transport system and sectors with\nsimilar characteristics.\n3.2Criteria for FinancingBanks/financial institutions ( FIs) are free to sanction term loans for technically\nfeasible, financially viable and bankable projects  undertaken by both public sector and\nprivate sector undertakings  subject to the following conditions :\n(i) The amount sanctioned should be within the overall ceiling of the prudential\nexposure norms prescribed by the Reserve  Bank  of  India  from time to time\n(please see paragraph  6.1 also).\n(ii) Banks/FIs  should satisfy themselves  that the projects financed by them have\nincome generation capacity  sufficient to repay the loan together with interest.\nBanks/FIs should also satisfy themselves that the project financed is run on\ncommercial lines i.e. involving commercial considerations such as identifiable\nactivity, cash flow  considerations and that they do not run into liquidity\nmismatch on account of lending to such projects.\n(iii) Banks should evolve an appropriate debt-equity ratio for each project, if\nnecessary, in consultation with FIs.\n(iv) Banks/FIs  are free to decide the period of loans keeping in view, inter alia, the\nmaturity profile of their liabilities (please see paragraph 6.2 also).\n(v) Banks/FIs  should have the requisite expertise for appraising technical\nfeasibility, financial viability and bankability of projects, with particular\nreference to risk analysis and sensitivity analysis (please see paragraph 5 also).\n(vi) (vi) In respect of projects undertaken by  public sector units, term loans\nmay be sanctioned only  for corporate entities (i.e. public sector undertakings\nregistered under Companies Act or a Corporation established under the\nrelevant statute). Further, such term loans should not be in lieu of or to\nsubstitute budgetary resources envisaged for the project. The term loan could\nsupplement the budgetary resources if such supplementing was   contemplated\nin the project design.

Types of Financing by Banks\n4.1In order to meet  long-term financial  requirements of infrastructure projects, banks\nmay,  inter  alia, take recourse to the following :\n(a) Finance through funds raised by way of subordinated debt ,  subject to the terms\nand conditions stipulated in circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.5/ 21.01.002/98-99 dated\nFebruary 8,1999..\n(b) Entering into take-out financing arrangement with IDFC/other financial\ninstitutions  or availing of liquidity support from IDFC/other financial institutions\n(some of the important features of the arrangements are given in Annexure I).\n(c)  Direct financing through rupee term loans, deferred payment guarantees, foreign\ncurrency  loans, etc, keeping in view the ability to manage asset-liability profile.(d)   Investment in infrastructure bonds issued by project promoters/ FIs.\n4.2Inter-institutional Guarantees\nIn terms of extant RBI instructions, banks are precluded from issuing guarantees\nfavouring  other banks/lending institutions for the loans extended by the latter, as the primary\nlender is expected to assume the credit risk and not pass on the same by securing itself with a\nguarantee i.e. separation of credit risk and funding is not allowed.  These instructions\npresently are not applicable to FIs.  While Reserve Bank is not in favour of a general\nrelaxation in this regard, keeping in view the special features of lending to infrastructure\nprojects viz., high  degree  of appraisal skills on the part of lenders and availability of\nresources of a maturity matching with the project period, it   has  been  decided, in partial\nmodification  of the instructions contained in circular IECD.No.37/08.12.01 /94-95 dated\nFebruary 23,1995,  to   give  banks  discretion  in  the  matter   of  issuance  of  guarantees\nfavouring other lending agencies, in respect of infrastructure projects alone, subject to the\nfollowing:\n(i) a bank would be permitted to issue the guarantee provided it also takes a funding\nshare in the project and that the amount of such  guarantees will not exceed twice  the\nfunding share assumed by it; and\n(ii) the guarantor bank has a satisfactory record in compliance with the prudential\nregulations such as capital adequacy, credit exposure norms, norms relating to income\nrecognition, asset classification and provisioning, etc.\n5.Appraisal\nInfrastructure projects are often financed through Special Purpose Vehicles and are\nstructured on a limited/non-recourse basis (important features of this arrangement are given\nin Annexure II).  Financing of these  projects would, therefore,  call for special appraisal\nskills on the part of lending agencies.  Identification of various project risks, evaluation of\nrisk mitigation through appraisal of project contracts and evaluation of creditworthiness of\nthe contracting entities and their abilities to fulfil contractual obligations will be an integral\npart of the appraisal exercise.  In this connection, banks/ FIs may consider  constituting\nappropriate screening committees/special cells for appraisal of credit proposals and\nmonitoring the progress/performance of the projects.  Often, the size of the funding\nrequirement would necessitate joint financing by banks/ FIs or financing by more than one\nbank under consortium or syndication arrangements. In such cases, participating banks/ FIs\nmay, for the purpose of their own assessment, refer to the appraisal report prepared by the\nlead bank/FI or have the project appraised jointly.  Banks/ FIs should, however, ensure that\nthe appraisal in all cases is completed within a time bound period and repetitive and\nsequential appraisals by several institutions are avoided.\n6.Regulatory Compliances/Concerns\n6.1  Prudential Exposure Norms\nInfrastructure finance will continue to be governed by  the instructions regarding\nexposure limits currently in force viz., exposure of a bank/FI to an individual borrower is\nrestricted upto 25 per cent of its  capital funds  and that to a group of borrowers to 50 percent.  Further, considering the large-scale financial requirements of infrastructure projects,\nbanks/FIs have been allowed to exceed the group exposure limit by 10 per cent to 60 per cent,\nprovided the additional exposure is on account of infrastructure projects in the four specified\nsectors, viz., roads, power, telecommunication and ports.\n6.2 Asset-Liability Management\nThe long-term financing of infrastructure projects may lead to asset-liability\nmismatches ,  particularly when such financing is not in conformity with the maturity profile\nof a bank's liabilities.  Banks would, therefore, need to exercise due vigil on their asset-\nliability position to ensure that they do not run into liquidity mismatches on account of\nlending to such projects.  In this connection, banks may refer to the guidelines on Asset -\nLiability Management (ALM) System issued vide circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.8 /21.0400/ 98-\n99 dated February 10,1999 and, as advised therein, put in place an effective ALM system\nwithin the stipulated timeframe.\n In regard to FIs, the asset-liability guidelines would be issued separately in\nconsultation with the institutions.  Pending issuance of the same, FIs should internally lay\ndown appropriate guidelines on ALM and ensure that financing of infrastructure is consistent\nwith these guidelines.\n7. Administrative Arrangements\nTimely and adequate availability of credit is the pre-requisite for  successful\nimplementation of infrastructure projects.  Banks/ FIs should, therefore, clearly delineate the\nprocedure for approval of loan proposals and institute a suitable monitoring mechanism for\nreviewing applications pending beyond the specified  period. Multiplicity of appraisals by\nevery institution involved in financing, leading to delays, has to be avoided and banks should\nbe prepared to broadly accept technical parameters laid down by leading public financial\ninstitutions.  Also, setting up a mechanism for an ongoing monitoring of the project\nimplementation will ensure that the credit disbursed is utilised for the purpose for which it\nwas sanctioned.\nPlease acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(V.G.Damle)\nChief General Manager\nANNEXURE I\nTake-out financing/liquidity support\n(a) Take-out financing arrangement\nTake-out financing structure is essentially a mechanism designed to enable banks to avoid\nasset-liability maturity mismatches that may arise out of extending long tenor loans to\ninfrastructure projects.  Under the arrangements, banks financing the infrastructure projects\nwill have an arrangement with IDFC or any other financial institution for transferring to thelatter the outstandings in their books on a pre-determined basis.  IDFC and SBI have devised\ndifferent take-out financing structures  to suit the requirements of various banks, addressing\nissues such as liquidity, asset-liability mismatches, limited availability of project appraisal\nskills, etc. (Please see the attached chart). They have also developed a Model Agreement that\ncan be considered for use as a document for specific projects in conjunction with other\nproject loan documents.  The agreement between SBI and IDFC could provide a reference\npoint for other banks to enter into somewhat similar arrangements with IDFC or other\nfinancial institutions.\n(b) Liquidity support from  IDFC\nAs an alternative to take-out financing structure, IDFC and SBI have devised a\nproduct, providing liquidity support to banks.  Under the scheme, IDFC would commit, at the\npoint of sanction, to refinance the entire outstanding loan ( principal+unrecovered interest) or\npart of the loan ,  to the bank after an agreed  period, say, five years. The credit risk on the\nproject will be taken by the bank concerned and not by IDFC.  The bank would repay the\namount  to IDFC with interest, as per the terms agreed upon.  Since IDFC would be taking a\ncredit risk on the bank, the interest rate to be charged by it on the amount refinanced would\ndepend on the IDFC's risk perception of the bank (in most of the cases, it may be close to\nIDFC's PLR).  The refinance support from IDFC would particularly benefit the banks which\nhave the requisite appraisal skills and the initial liquidity to fund the project.\nANNEXURE II\nFeatures of limited/non-recourse financing\nstructure of infrastructure projects\nInfrastructure projects are characterised by large size, huge capital costs, long gestation and\nextended pay back period thereafter and high leverage ratios. Financing of infrastructure\nprojects is different from the traditional method of financing based on the balance sheet\nsupport.  These projects are often  financed through  Special Purpose Vehicles ( SPVs) and are\nstructured on a limited/non-recourse basis. The approach to such projects is to properly\nidentify and allocate various elements of the project  risks  to the entities participating in the\nproject. Accordingly, the residual risk borne by the project company is a small percentage of\nthe entire risk. Some of the other important features of the limited/non-recourse financing\nstructure are  briefly given below :\n(a) Sponsor support  obligation\nIn a limited/non-recourse financing structure, th e sponsor group commits to provide\nstandby support for  cost-overruns  in the project,  provided the quantum of such support  has\ncrystallised prior to financial closure. In the event of any cost overrun in the project, it is met\nfrom such standby support.  In case the overrun exceeds the amount of such support, while\nthere will be  no obligation on  any party in view of the exposures already taken,  all the\nplayers can negotiate the quantum and terms of additional funding requirement.  After\nsatisfactory completion of the project, no recourse would be  available to the project sponsors\nfor any shortfall in the revenue projections unless specifically agreed to between the  parties.(b) Security structure\nSPVs have a security structure which is generally more stringent than that for normal\nprojects. The security package generally includes a registered mortgage/ hypothecation  of all\nassets,  besides  pledge of sponsor holdings in the SPV and an assignment in favour of\ninstitutions of all the project contracts and documents as also charge on the future\nreceivables.\n(c) Trust and Retention Arrangement(TRA )\nThe cash flows of the SPV are captured by way of a TRA arrangement. Such an\narrangement provides for the appropriation of all cash inflows of the company by an\nindependent agent(acting on behalf of the security trustee).  This is then allocated in a pre-\ndetermined manner to various requirements including debt servicing and it is only after all\nrequirements are met ,  that the residual cash flow is available to the project-company.  Thus,\nthe lender would have the security of cash flows in addition to the assets of the company.\n(d) Guarantees\nThe payment risk in some of the infrastructure projects is further mitigated by way of a\nguarantee from the state or Central Government.TAKE-OUT FINANCING PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL BANKS - FEATURES\nProduct Risk Pricing Benefits to\nUntil\ntake-outPost take-out To co.direct*\nlending\nwithout\ntake-out (A)*Under take-out scheme\n(B)Project Bank\nBank Interest\n**IDFC charges\n@Total chargeable\nto Co.(not to\nexceed) (A)\n1.Unconditional take-out IDFC IDFC 15-16.25% 12.75%(i.e. at\nMTPLR) - o/a\nexposure on IDFC-2% take-out\ni.e. on principal14.75% Saving in interest\nby 0.25% - 1.5%\ni.e. (A) - (B)Suitable for medium size banks with\nlimited project appraisal skills,\nunwilling to take project risk-liquidity.\n2.

Following instructions are\nissued in implementation of the decisions announced in the above-referred paragraphs.\n1. Forward exchange cover for Foreign Institutional\nInvestors ( FIIs) - Equity investment\n1.1Hitherto, authorised  dealers were permitted to provide forward exchange cover to FIIs to\nthe extent of 15 per cent of the market value of their investments in equity as at the close of\nbusiness on 11th June 1998 converted into dollar terms at the rate of U.S.$ 1 = Rs.42.38 and\nincremental investments subsequent thereto.  It has since been decided to change the cut-off date\nfrom 11th June 1998 to 31st March 1999.  Accordingly, authorised  dealers may provide forward\nexchange cover to FIIs to the extent of 15 per cent of their outstanding equity investment as at the\nclose of business on 31st March 1999 converted into dollar terms at the rate of U.S.$ 1 =\nRs.42.43, as well as for the entire amount of any additional investment made after 31st March\n1999.  Existing forward contracts entered into by FIIs in accordance with earlier instructions\nmay, however, be allowed to continue till maturity even if the amount thereof exceeds 15 per\ncent of the investment outstanding as on 31st March 1999.\n1.2Reserve Bank will consider requests from FIIs for additional limits on a case-by-case\nbasis after the eligible limits have been fully utilised.  Such applications should be made to the\nChief General Manager, Reserve Bank of India, Exchange Control Department, ( Forex Market\nDivision), Central Office , Mumbai together with full particulars of forward exchange facilities\nalready availed of by the FII.\n1.3All other instructions contained in A.D.(M.A. Series) Circular Nos. 19 and 31 dated 16th\nJune 1998 and 20th August 1998 respectively, as also in Circular letter\nNo.EC.FMD.124/02.03.75/98-99 dated 2nd September 1998 on the subject remain unchanged.22. Credit facilities for overseas trading\noffices of Indian companies\nPlease refer to paragraph 9B.1 of the Exchange Control Manual which contains\nguidelines to authorised dealers for release of exchange for establishment of overseas offices by\nfirms/companies in India.  One of the conditions subject to which firms/companies in India are\nallowed to open offices abroad is that the overseas office should not create any financial\nliabilities, contingent  or otherwise, for their Head Office in India.\nIt has now been decided that Reserve Bank would consider requests from Export Houses/Trading\nHouses/Star Trading Houses/Super Star Trading Houses for availing of fund based/non-fund\nbased facilities from overseas banks for their trading offices abroad on merits, provided the terms\nand conditions subject to which such facilities are extended by overseas banks are reasonable.\nApplications for this purpose should be made to the Chief General Manager, Reserve Bank of\nIndia, Exchange Control Department, Central Office, (EXD), Mumbai  with full particulars of the\nexchange facilities availed of for maintenance of the overseas office, need for availing of credit\nfacilities by overseas trading office and terms and conditions subject to which the credit facilities\nhave been offered by the overseas bank(s).\n3. Exchange Earners Foreign Currency (EEFC) Accounts\n3.1Please refer to Part D of Chapter 14 of Exchange Control Manual regarding Exchange\nEarners Foreign Currency Accounts.  It has now been decided that authorised dealers may allow\nthe EEFC account holders the facility of making payments from such accounts for eligible\npurposes by issue of  cheques to the beneficiaries of the payments.  This facility may be\nintroduced with effect from 1st May 1999.  For this purpose, authorised dealers may issue\nseparate cheque books to EEFC account holders which should be distinct from the cheques\nissued on domestic rupee accounts or NRE accounts and should be superscribed with the words\n\u201cEEFC Account\u201d.  Authorised dealers may fix their own requirement of minimum balance in the\naccount for being eligible to avail of the cheque facility.   Authorised  dealers should, while\nproviding the cheque facility to the EEFC account holders, advise them that while issuing\ncheques  for making payments in foreign exchange out of funds held in EEFC account, they\nshould ensure that the cheques  are issued for payments for approved purposes only and the\nrelevant exchange control regulations are complied with.\n3.2.The account holder, within a period of seven days from th e date of issue of cheque,\nshould submit an application in form A1/A2 together with the particulars of cheque issued and\nrequisite document to the authorised dealer concerned giving full particulars of payment made by\nissue of a cheque.  The authorised dealer should report the transaction in an appropriate \u2018R\u2019\nreturn as and when the cheque is cleared for payment to the beneficiary. While making the\npayment of cheque authorised dealer should ensure that the transaction in question is permissible\nunder the current exchange control regulations.  Any payment made by issue of a cheque for a3purpose for which use of funds in EEFC account is not permissible should be reported to Reserve\nBank promptly with full details.\n3.3Reserve Bank has accordingly issued a Not ification No.F.E.R.A. 203/99-RB dated 24th\nApril 1999 (copy enclosed) amending its earlier Notification No.F.E.R.A.36/76-RB dated 10th\nMay 1976, as amended up to 26th April 1993, granting general permission for sending outside\nIndia the cheques drawn on EEFC accounts.\n4.

The\nonly lending rates now prescribed by the Reserve Bank are the concessional rates below the\nPLR of the respective banks for certain sectors like exports, small loans upto Rs.2 lakh, and\nunder the Differential Rate of Interest scheme. Banks have been permitted to prescribe\nseparate PLRs for short-term credit and long-term credit for 3 years and above. With a view\nto providing some more flexibility to banks, the following measures in respect of interest\nrates have been introduced with immediate effect:\n(i) Tenor Linked PLRs\nThe PLR system with a spread between PLR and the maximum lending rate that is\ndetermined by the banks\u2019 Boards has been in operation for some time now and has by and\nlarge served the purpose of ensuring transparency and objectivity. There have been requests\nfrom banks and borrowers for tenor linked PLR i.e. PLR for different maturities.\nIt has, therefore, been decided to provide banks with freedom to operate\ndifferent PLRs for different maturities provided the transparency and uniformity of\ntreatment originally envisaged continues to be maintained.\n(ii) Fixed Rate Loans for project finance\nSimilarly, industries, especially those requiring project finance, have been requesting for\nfixity of interest rates on term loans.\nIt has been decided to permit banks to offer fixed rate loans subject to\nconformity to Asset Liability Management (ALM) guidelines.\n(iii) Advances against domestic/NRE term deposits2\nAs per the instructions contained in Item 2(ii) of RBI circular DBOD No. Dir.BC.\n36/13.03.00/98 dated April 29,1998, interest rates chargeable on loans and advances granted\nto depositors against their domestic/NRE term deposits should not exceed PLR. While PLR\nhas been coming down, the interest rates on deposits have remained unaltered on the existing\ndeposits. In certain cases, this has resulted in the interest rates on advances based on PLR\nbeing lower than the interest rates on deposits themselves.\nIn order to remove this anomaly, it has been decided that in cases where deposit\nrates are equal to or more than PLR or less than one percentage point below PLR, the\nbanks will have freedom to charge suitable rates of interest on advances against\ndomestic/NRE term deposits without reference to the ceiling of PLR. Thus, the interest\nrates on advances shall invariably be more than the interest rates paid on respective deposits.\nThe effective date of changes mentioned above shall be announced by the banks as early as\npossible.\nThe amending Directive DBOD No. Dir.BC. 36 /13.01.04/99 dated April 23, 1999 is\nenclosed.\n(iv)   Asset-Liability Management Committee\nBanks have been representing that the present requirement that changes in deposit rates and\nlending rates should be approved by the Board of Directors of the bank restricts the ability of\nbanks to respond promptly to changes in interest rates environment.\n Accordingly, it has been decided that the Boards of Directors of banks may\nauthorise the Asset-Liability Management Committee to fix interest rates on Deposits\nand Advances, subject to reporting to the Board immediately thereafter.\n 2)  Prudential Norms\n(i) Valuation of banks' investments in approved securities.\nWith a view to adopting prudent accounting standards and moving towards \"mark to market\"\nvaluation of the investment portfolio, banks were advised in paragraph 5 of Circular\nDBOD.No.Dir.BC. 36/13.03.00/98 dated April 29, 1998 to classify a minimum of 70 per cent\nof their investment in approved securities as \"current\" investments for the year ended March\n1999.\nIt has been decided that for the year ending March 31, 2000, banks shall classify\na minimum of 75 per cent of their investments in approved securities as \"current\"\ninvestments.\n(ii)  Issue of sub- ordinated debt for raising Tier II Capital.\nIn terms of instructions contained in Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.5/21.01.002/ 98-99 dated\nFebruary 8, 1999, banks were given autonomy to raise rupee denominated subordinated debt\nas Tier II Capital, subject to the terms of issue of the bonds being in conformity with the\nconditions indicated therein. It has been observed that there has been a high level of cross\nholding of such instruments among banks and financial institutions, without necessarily\nleading to accretion of capital to the financial system.\n It has been decided that a bank\u2019s aggregate investment in Tier II bonds issued by other\nbanks and financial institutions shall be permitted up to 10 per cent of the investing\nbank's total capital. The total capital for this purpose will be the same as that reckoned3\nfor the purpose of capital adequacy. In case any bank has already exceeded this limit of\n10 per cent, a reference may be made to RBI indicating the period within which the\nexposure would be brought within the stipulated limit.\nIt is reiterated in this connection that investments by banks in Tier II bonds of other\nbanks/financial institutions would carry 100 per cent risk weight [vide paragraph 2(d)] of\nCircular DBOD.No.BP.BC.103/21.01.002/98 dated 31st October, 1998].\n(iii)  Asset Classification -  Rescheduled Loans.\nAs per the present guidelines contained in Para 2.B (ii) of Circular BP.BC.129/21.04.043/92\ndated April 27, 1992, an advance where the terms of the loan agreement regarding interest\nand principal have been renegotiated or rescheduled after commencement of production,\nshould be classified as sub-standard and should remain in that category for at least two years\nof satisfactory performance under the renegotiated or rescheduled term. We have been\nreceiving representations from banks that in certain situations (e.g. cyclical down-turn) where\nloans have been rescheduled, but where borrowers have started servicing their loans on a\nregular basis after a short gap, the prescribed waiting period of two years is too long.\nIt has been decided that the period of two years may be reduced to one year (or\nfour quarters) if the interest and instalment of loans have been serviced regularly as per\nthe terms of reschedulement. The above instructions will be applicable for asset\nclassification with effect from the year ended March 31, 1999.\n(iv)  Bank\u2019s investments in Venture Capital\nIn terms of circular DBOD.No.Dir.BC.78/13.07.05/98-99 dated August 8, 1998 banks have\nbeen permitted to invest in units of dedicated venture capital funds meant for information\ntechnology within the ceiling of 5% of incremental deposits of the previous year prescribed\nfor investment in equity shares including PSU shares, convertible debentures of corporates\nand in units of Mutual Funds Schemes the corpus of which is not exclusively invested in\ncorporate debt instruments.\n In order to encourage the flow of finance for venture capital, it has been decided\nthat the above overall ceiling of 5% will stand automatically enhanced to the extent of\nbank\u2019s investment in venture capital ( including units of dedicated Venture Capital\nfunds meant for Information Technology), subject to the condition that the venture\ncapital funds/companies are registered with SEBI.\nPlease acknowledge the receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n( A.Ghosh )\nChief General Manager in- Charge\nEncl: one", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/6226.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 23, 1999", "info": "Minimum Net Owned Fund (NOF) for commencement\nof business of a Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI)\nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA\nDEPARTMENT OF NON-BANKING SUPERVISION\nCENTRAL OFFICE\nCENTRE I, WORLD TRADE CENTRE,\nCUFFE PARADE, COLABA\nMUMBAI 400 005.\nDNBS (PD) No. CC.10/02.59/98-99\nApril   20,  1999\nTo\n(i) The Secretary, Department of Company Affairs, Government of India,\n(ii) All the Registrars of Companies\n(iii) All the Apex Level Chambers of Commerce FICCI/ASSOCHAM/CII\n(iv) President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India\n(v) President of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India\n(vi) Associations of NBFCs\nDear Sirs,\nMinimum Net Owned Fund (NOF) for commencement\nof business of a Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI)\nWith a view to imparting greater financial soundness and achieving the economies of scale in\nterms of efficiency of operations and higher managerial skills, the requirement of minimum\nNOF of Rs. 25 lakhs has been raised to Rs. 200 lakh for the NBFC which commences\nbusiness of a non-banking financial institution on or after April 21, 1999.

Since the\noperations of financial institutions also give rise to liquidity and interest rate risk exposures, it\nhas been decided to introduce an ALM system for the all-India financial institutions as well,\nas part of their overall system for effective risk management in their various portfolios.\n2. We forward herewith the broad draft guidelines for measurement of liquidity and interest\nrate risk which could form the basis for evolving an ALM system by the FIs. The intention of\nissuing these guidelines is to sensitise the managements of FIs to the need for a formally\nstructured management of the liquidity and interest rate risk of their portfolios and to provide\na basis for initiating measures for collection, compilation and analysis of data required for an\neffective ALM system. The FIs may study the draft guidelines and offer their suggestions on\nthe aspects where there are likely to be practical difficulties in implementing the guidelines\nlatest by 30 June 1999.\n3. The guidelines are expected to be particularly useful for the FIs which do not have a formal\nand well structured ALM system. However, if any of the FIs already have more sophisticated\nALM systems in place, they may continue with the same but should fine tune their reporting\nsystems, where necessary, so as to conform to the prescribed guidelines . It would be\ndesirable to constitute a small Group under the charge of the senior executive responsible for\ntreasury function of the institution, with members drawn from investments, foreign exchange,\ncredit and MIS areas. The Group should be entrusted with the task of carrying out necessary\nspade work for formalising the ALM system in the institution.\n4. We would like the financial institutions to introduce the ALM system w.e.f. 1st October\n1999 on a trial run basis so that they are in a position to switch over to a regular ALM system\nfrom 1st April 2000.\n5. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(K. C. Bandyopadhyay)\nChief General Manager\nEncl: as aboveASSET - LIABILITY MANAGEMENT (ALM) SYSTEM\nIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (FIS) - GUIDELINES\nIn the normal course, FIs are exposed to credit and market risks in view of the asset-liability\ntransformation. With liberalisation in Indian financial markets over the last few years and\ngrowing integration of domestic markets and with external markets, the risks associated with\nFIs' operations have become complex and large, requiring strategic management. FIs are now\noperating in a fairly deregulated environment and are required to determine on their own,\ninterest rates on deposits and advance in both domestic and foreign currencies on a dynamic\nbasis. The interest rates on FIs' investments in government and other securities are also now\nmarket related. Intense competition for business involving both the assets and liabilities,\ntogether with increasing volatility in the domestic interest rates as well as foreign exchange\nrates, has brought pressure on the management of FIs to maintain a good balance among\nspreads, profitability and long-term viability. Imprudent liquidity management can put FIs\u2019\nearnings and reputation at great risk. These pressures call for structured and comprehensive\nmeasures and not just ad hoc action. The Management of FIs has to base their business\ndecisions on a dynamic and integrated risk management system and process, driven by\ncorporate strategy. FIs are exposed to several major risks in the course of their business -\ncredit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity / commodity price risk , liquidity\nrisk and operational risk. It is, therefore, important that FIs introduce effective risk\nmanagement systems that address the issues related to interest rate, currency and liquidity\nrisks.\nFIs need to address these risks in a structured manner by upgrading their risk\nmanagement and adopting more comprehensive Asset-Liability Management (ALM)\npractices than has been done hitherto. ALM, among other functions, is also concerned with\nrisk management and provides a comprehensive and dynamic framework for measuring,\nmonitoring and managing liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity and commodity\nprice risks of a bank that needs to be closely integrated with the FIs\u2019 business strategy. It\ninvolves assessment of various types of risks and altering the asset-liability portfolio in a\ndynamic way in order to manage risks.\n2. This note lays down broad guidelines in respect of interest rate and liquidity risks\nmanagement systems in FIs which form part of the Asset-Liability Management (ALM)\nfunction. The initial focus of the ALM function would be to enforce the risk management\ndiscipline viz. managing business after assessing the risks involved. The objective of good\nrisk management systems should be that these systems will evolve into a strategic tool for FIs\nmanagement.\n3. The ALM process rests on three pillars:\n\u2022 ALM Information Systems\n\u21d2 Management Information Systems\n\u21d2 Information availability, accuracy, adequacy and expediency\n\u2022 ALM Organisation\n\u21d2 Structure and responsibilities\n\u21d2 Level of top management involvement\n\u2022 ALM Process\n\u21d2 Risk parameters\n\u21d2 Risk identification\u21d2 Risk measurement\n\u21d2 Risk management\n\u21d2 Risk policies and tolerance levels.\n4. ALM Information Systems\n \n ALM has to be supported by a management philosophy which clearly specifies the risk\npolicies and tolerance limits. This framework needs to be built on sound methodology with\nnecessary information system as back up. Thus, information is the key to the ALM process. It\nis, however, recognised that varied business profiles of FIs in the public and private sector do\nnot make the adoption of a uniform ALM System  for all FIs feasible. There are various\nmethods prevalent world-wide for measuring risks. These range from the simple Gap\nStatement to extremely sophisticated and data intensive Risk Adjusted Profitability\nMeasurement methods. However, the central element for the entire ALM exercise is the\navailability of adequate and accurate information with expedience and the existing systems in\nmany FIs do not generate information in the manner required for ALM. Collecting accurate\ndata in a timely manner will be the biggest challenge before the FIs, particularly lacking full\nscale computerisation. However, the introduction of base information system for risk\nmeasurement and monitoring has to be addressed urgently. As FIs are aware, internationally,\nregulators have prescribed or are in the process of prescribing capital adequacy for market\nrisks. A pre-requisite for this is that FIs must have in place an efficient information system.\n \n Considering the large network of branches and the lack of (an adequate) support system to\ncollect information required for ALM which analyses information on the basis of residual\nmaturity and behavioural pattern, it will take time for FIs in the present state to get the\nrequisite information. In respect of foreign exchange, investment portfolio and money market\noperations, in view of the centralised nature of the functions, it would be much easier to\ncollect reliable information. The data and assumptions can then be refined over time as the FI\nmanagement gain experience of conducting business within an ALM framework. The spread\nof computerisation will also help FIs in accessing data.\n5. ALM Organisation\n5.1 a) Successful implementation of the risk management process would require strong\ncommitment on the part of the senior management in the FI, to integrate basic operations and\nstrategic decision making with risk management. The Board should have overall\nresponsibility for management of risks and should decide the risk management policy of the\nFI and set limits for liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity price risks.\nb) The Asset - Liability Committee (ALCO) consisting of the FI's senior management\nincluding CEO should be responsible for ensuring adherence to the limits set by the Board as\nwell as for deciding the business strategy of the FI (on the assets and liabilities sides) in line\nwith the FI\u2019s budget and decided risk management objectives.\nc) The ALM Support Groups consisting of operating staff should be responsible for\nanalysing, monitoring and reporting the risk profiles to the ALCO. The staff should also\nprepare forecasts (simulations) showing the effects of various possible changes in market\nconditions related to the balance sheet and recommend the action needed to adhere to FI's\ninternal limits.5.2The ALCO is a decision making unit responsible for balance sheet planning from r isk\n-return perspective including the strategic management of interest rate and liquidity risks.\nEach FI will have to decide on the role of its ALCO, its responsibility as also the decisions to\nbe taken by it. The business and risk management strategy of the FI should ensure that the FI\noperates within the limits / parameters set by the Board. The business issues that an ALCO\nwould consider, inter alia, will include product pricing for both deposits and advances,\ndesired maturity profile and mix of the incremental assets and liabilities, etc. In addition to\nmonitoring the risk levels of the FI, the ALCO should review the results of and progress in\nimplementation of the decisions made in the previous meetings. The ALCO would also\narticulate the current interest rate view of the FI and base its decisions for future business\nstrategy on this view. In respect of the funding policy, for instance, its responsibility would\nbe to decide on source and mix of liabilities or sale of assets. Towards this end, it will have to\ndevelop a view on future direction of interest rate movements and decide on funding mixes\nbetween fixed vs floating rate funds, wholesale vs retail deposits, money market vs capital\nmarket funding , domestic vs foreign currency funding, etc. Individual FIs will have to decide\nthe frequency for holding their ALCO meetings.\n5.3 Composition of ALCO\nThe size (number of members) of ALCO would depend on the size of each institution,\nbusiness mix and organisational complexity. To ensure commitment of the Top Management\nand timely response to market dynamics, the CEO/CMD or the ED should head the\nCommittee. The Chiefs of Investment, Credit, Resources Management or Planning, Funds\nManagement / Treasury (forex and domestic), International Business and Economic Research\ncan be members of the Committee. In addition, the Head of the Technology Division should\nalso be an invitee for building up of MIS and related computerisation. Some FIs may even\nhave Sub-committees and Support Groups.\n5.4 Committee of Directors\nThe Management Committee of the Board or any other Specific Committee constituted by\nthe Board should oversee the implementation of the system and review its functioning\nperiodically.\n5.5 ALM Process:\n The scope of ALM function can be described as follows:\n\u2022 Liquidity risk management\n\u2022 Management of market risks\n\u2022 Trading risk management\n\u2022 Funding and capital planning\n\u2022 Profit planning and growth projection\n \n The guidelines given in this note mainly address Liquidity and Interest Rate risks.\n6. Liquidity Risk Management\n6.1Measuring and managing liquidity needs are vital for effective operation of FIs. By\nassuring a FI's ability to meet its liabilities as they become due, liquidity management can\nreduce the probability of an adverse situation developing. The importance of liquidity\ntranscends individual institutions, as liquidity shortfall in one institution can have\nrepercussions on the entire system. FIs management should measure not only the liquidity\npositions of FIs on an ongoing basis but also examine how liquidity requirements are likely toevolve under different assumptions. Experience shows that assets commonly considered, as\nliquid like Government securities and other money market instruments could also become\nilliquid when the market and players are unidirectional. Therefore liquidity has to be tracked\nthrough maturity or cash flow mismatches. For measuring and managing net funding\nrequirements, the use of a maturity ladder and calculation of cumulative surplus or deficit of\nfunds at selected maturity dates is adopted as a standard tool. The format of the Statement of\nStructural Liquidity is given in Annexure I.\n6.2 The Maturity Profile as given in Appendix I could be used for measuring the future cash\nflows of FIs in different time buckets. The time buckets, may be distributed as under:\ni)  1 to 14 days\nii)  15 to 28 days\niii)  29 days and upto 3 months\niv)  Over 3 months and upto 6 months\nv)  Over 6 months and upto 1 year\nvi)  Over 1 year and upto 3 years\nvii)  Over 3 years and upto 5 years\nviii)  Over 5 years and upto 7 years\nix)  Over 7 years and upto 10 years\nx)  Over 10 years.\n6.3 The investments are assumed as illiquid due to lack of depth in the secondary market and\nare therefore required to be shown under respective maturity buckets, corresponding to the\nresidual maturity. However, some of the FIs may be maintaining securities in the \u2018Trading\nBook\u2019, which are kept distinct from other investments made for retaining relationship with\ncustomers. Securities held in the 'Trading Book\u2019 are subject to certain preconditions like :\ni) The composition and volume are clearly defined;\nii) Maximum maturity/duration of the portfolio is restricted;\niii) The holding period not to exceed 90 days;\niv) Cut-loss limit prescribed;\nv) Defeasance periods (product-wise) i.e. time taken to liquidate the position on the basis\nof liquidity in the secondary market are prescribed;\nvi) Marking to market on a daily/weekly basis and the revaluation gain/loss charged to\nthe profit and loss account; etc.\nFIs which maintain such \u2018Trading Books\u2019 and complying with the above standards are\npermitted to show the trading securities under 1-14 days, 15-28 days and 29-90 days buckets\non the basis of the defeasance periods. The Board/ALCO of the FIs should approve the\nvolume, composition, holding/defeasance period, cut loss, etc. of the \u2018Trading Book\u2019 and\ncopy of the policy note thereon should be forwarded to the Department of Banking\nSupervision, FID, RBI.\n6.4 Within each time bucket there could be mismatches depending on cash inflows and\noutflows. While the mismatches upto one year would be relevant since these provide early\nwarning signals of impending liquidity problems, the main focus should be on the short-term\nmismatches viz., 1-14 days and 15-28 days. FIs however, are expected to monitor their\ncumulative mismatches (running total) across all time buckets by establishing internal\nprudential limits with the approval of the Board / Management Committee. The mismatches(negative gap ) during 1-14 days and 15-28 days in normal course may not exceed 5% of the\ncash outflows in each time bucket. If a FI in view of its current asset -liability profile and the\nconsequential structural mismatches needs higher tolerance level, it could operate with higher\nlimit sanctioned by its Board / Management Committee giving specific reasons on the need\nfor such higher limit. The discretion to allow a higher tolerance level is intended for a\ntemporary period, i.e. till March 31, 2000.\n6.5 The Statement of Structural Liquidity ( Annexure I  ) may be prepared by placing all cash\ninflows and outflows in the maturity ladder according to the expected timing of cash flows. A\nmaturing liability will be a cash outflow while a maturing asset will be a cash inflow. It\nwould also be necessary to take into account the rupee inflows and outflows on account of\nforex operations. While determining the likely cash inflows / outflows, FIs have to make a\nnumber of assumptions according to their asset - liability profiles. While determining the\ntolerance levels the FIs may take into account all relevant factors based on their asset-liability\nbase, nature of business, future strategy, etc. The RBI is interested in ensuring that the\ntolerance levels are determined keeping all necessary factors in view and further refined with\nexperience gained in Liquidity Management.\n6.6 In order to enable the FIs to monitor their short-term liquidity on a dynamic basis over a\ntime horizon spanning from 1 day to 6 months, FIs may estimate their short-term liquidity\nprofiles on the basis of business projections and other commitments for planning purposes.\nAn indicative format ( Annexure III  ) for estimating Short-term Dynamic Liquidity is\nenclosed.\n7. Currency Risk\n7.1 Floating exchange rate arrangement has brought in its wake pronounced volatility adding\na new dimension to the risk profile of FIs\u2019 balance sheets. The increased capital flows across\nfree economies following deregulation have contributed to increase in the volume of\ntransactions. Large cross border flows together with the volatility has rendered the FIs'\nbalance sheets vulnerable to exchange rate movements.\n7.2 Dealing in different currencies brings opportunities as also risks. If the liabilities in one\ncurrency exceed the level of assets in the same currency, then the currency mismatch can add\nvalue or erode value depending upon the currency movements. The simplest way to avoid\ncurrency risk is to ensure that mismatches, if any, are reduced to zero or near zero. FIs\nundertake operations in foreign exchange like borrowings, making loans and advances and\nquoting prices for foreign exchange transactions. Irrespective of the strategies adopted, it may\nnot be possible to eliminate currency mismatches altogether. Besides, some of the institutions\nmay take proprietary trading positions as a conscious business strategy.\n7.3 Managing Currency Risk is one more dimension of Asset- Liability Management.\nMismatched currency position besides exposing the balance sheet to movements in exchange\nrate also exposes it to country risk and settlement risk. Following the introduction of\n\u201cGuidelines for Internal Control over Foreign Exchange Business\u201d in 1981, maturity\nmismatches (gaps) are also subject to control. Following the recommendations of Expert\nGroup on Foreign Exchange Markets in India (Sodhani Committee) the calculation of\nexchange position has been redefined and FIs have been given the discretion to set up\novernight limits linked to maintenance of capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio of 8% of\nopen position limit.7.4 Presently, the FIs are also free to set gap limits with RBI\u2019s approval but are required to\nadopt Value at Risk (VaR) approach to measure the risk associated with forward exposures.\nThus the open position limits together with the gap limits form the risk management approach\nto forex operations. For monitoring such risks FIs should follow the instructions contained in\nCircular A.D (M. A. Series) No.52 dated December 27, 1997 issued by the Exchange Control\nDepartment.\n8. Interest Rate Risk (IRR)\n8.1 The phased deregulation of interest rates and the operational flexibility given to FIs in\npricing most of the assets and liabilities imply the need for the financial system to hedge the\nInterest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk where changes in market interest rates might\nadversely affect a FI's financial condition. The changes in interest rates affect FIs in a larger\nway. The immediate impact of changes in interest rates is on FI's earnings (i.e. reported\nprofits) by changing its Net Interest Income (NII). A long-term impact of changing interest\nrates is on FI's Market Value of Equity (MVE) or Net Worth as the economic value of FI\u2019s\nassets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions get affected due to variation in market\ninterest rates. The interest rate risk when viewed from these two perspectives is known as\n\u2018earnings perspective\u2019 and \u2018economic value\u2019 perspective, respectively. The risk from the\nearnings perspective can be measured as changes in the Net Interest Income (NII) or Net\nInterest Margin (NIM). There are many analytical techniques for measurement and\nmanagement of Interest Rate Risk. In the context of poor MIS, slow pace of computerisation\nin FIs, the traditional Gap analysis is considered as a suitable method to measure the Interest\nRate Risk in the first place. It is the intention of RBI to move over to the modern techniques\nof Interest Rate Risk measurement like Duration Gap Analysis, Simulation and Value at Risk\nover time when FIs acquire sufficient expertise and sophistication in acquiring and handling\nMIS.\nThe Gap or Mismatch risk can be measured by calculating Gaps over different time intervals\nas at a given date. Gap analysis measures mismatches between rate sensitive liabilities and\nrate sensitive assets (including off-balance sheet positions). An asset or liability is normally\nclassified as rate sensitive if:\ni)  within the time interval under consideration, there is a cash flow;\nii)  the interest rate resets/reprices contractually during the interval;\niii)  dependent on RBI changes in the interest rates/Bank Rate;\niv)  it is contractually pre-payable or withdrawal before the stated maturities.\n8.2 The Gap Report should be generated by grouping rate sensitive liabilities, assets and off-\nbalance sheet positions into time buckets according to residual maturity or next repricing\nperiod, whichever is earlier. The difficult task in Gap analysis is determining rate sensitivity.\nAll investments, advances, deposits, borrowings, purchased funds, etc. that mature/reprice\nwithin a specified timeframe are interest rate sensitive. Similarly, any principal repayment of\nloan is also rate sensitive if the FI expects to receive it within the time horizon. This includes\nfinal principal payment and interim instalments. Certain assets and liabilities receive/pay\nrates that vary with a reference rate. These assets and liabilities are repriced at pre-determined\nintervals and are rate sensitive at the time of repricing. While the interest rates on term\ndeposits are fixed during their currency, the tranches of advances portfolio is basically\nfloating . The interest rates on advances could be repriced any number of occasions,\ncorresponding to the changes in PLR.The Gaps may be identified in the following time buckets:\ni)  1-28 days\nii)  29 days and upto 3 months\niii)  Over 3 months and upto 6 months\niv)  Over 6 months and upto 1 year\nv)  Over 1 year and upto 3 years\nvi)  Over 3 years and upto 5 years\nvii)  Over 5 years and upto 7 years\nviii)  Over 7 years and upto 10 years\nix)   Over 10 years\nx)  Non-sensitive\nThe various items of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet items may be\nclassified as explained in Appendix - II and the Reporting Format for interest rate sensitive\nassets and liabilities is given in Annexure II.\n8.3 The Gap is the difference between Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) and Rate Sensitive\nLiabilities (RSL) for each time bucket. The positive Gap indicates that it has more RSAs than\nRSLs whereas the negative Gap indicates that it has more RSLs. The Gap reports indicate\nwhether the institution is in a position to benefit from rising interest rates by having a positive\nGap (RSA > RSL) or whether it is in a position to benefit from declining interest rates by a\nnegative Gap (RSL > RSA). The Gap can, therefore, be used as a measure of interest rate\nsensitivity.\n8.4 Each FI should set prudential limits on individual Gaps with the approval of the\nBoard/Management Committee. The prudential limits should have a relationship with the\nTotal Assets , Earning Assets or Equity.  The FIs may work out Earnings at Risk (EaR) or\nNet Interest Margin (NIM) based on their views on interest rate movements and fix a prudent\nlevel with the approval of the Board/Management Committee.\n8.5 RBI will also introduce capital adequacy for market risks in due course.\n9. General\n9.1 The classification of various components of assets and liabilities into different time\nbuckets for preparation of Gap reports (Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity) as indicated in\nAppendices I & II is the benchmark . FIs which are better equipped to reasonably estimate\nthe behavioural pattern, embedded options, rolls-in and rolls-out, etc of various components\nof assets and liabilities on the basis of past data / empirical studies could classify them in the\nappropriate time buckets, subject to approval from the ALCO / Board. A copy of the note\napproved by the ALCO / Board may be sent to the Department of Banking Supervision,\nFinancial Institutions Division.\n9.2 The present framework does not capture the impact of embedded options,  i.e. the\ncustomers exercising their options (premature closure of deposits, bonds and prepayment of\nloans and advances) on the liquidity and interest rate risks profile of FIs. The magnitude of\nembedded option risk at times of volatility in market interest rates is quite substantial.. FIs\nshould therefore evolve suitable mechanism, supported by empirical studies and behavioural\nanalysis to estimate the future behaviour of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items to\nchanges in market variables and estimate the embedded options.9.3 A scientifically evolved internal transfer pricing model by assigning values on the basis\nof current market rates to funds provided and funds used is an important component for\neffective implementation of ALM System. The transfer price mechanism can enhance the\nmanagement of margin i.e. lending or credit spread, the funding or liability spread and\nmismatch spread. It also helps centralising interest rate risk at one place which facilitate\neffective control and management of interest rate risk. A well defined transfer pricing system\nalso provide a rational framework for pricing of assets and liabilities.\nAppendix - I\nMaturity Profile - Liquidity\n Heads of Accounts  Time-bucket category\nA.

Review of Macro-economic and Monetary\nDevelopments: 1998-99\nDomestic Developments\n2.According to the preliminary estimates of the Central Statistical Organ isation (CSO),\nthe GDP growth in 1998-99 is likely to be 5.8 per cent as compared with a growth rate of 5.0\nper cent for 1997-98. The increase in the growth rate in 1998-99 is largely due to the\nturnaround in the output from \u2018agriculture and allied activities\u2019 from (-) 1.0 per cent in 1997-\n98 to 5.3 per cent in 1998-99, and to the continued good performance of the services sector.\nThe manufacturing sector is estimated to have registered only a modest growth. The index of\nindustrial production during the first eleven months of 1998-99 showed an increase of only\n3.9 per cent as compared with the growth of 6.9 per cent in the corresponding period of the\npreceding year.\n3.In the monetary and credit policy statement of April 1998, the growth rate of GDP\nwas projected to be in the region of 6.5 to 7.0 per cent in 1998-99. In the October statement,\nin view of continued slow down in industrial activities, the growth projection was lowered to\n6.0 per cent. As per the latest estimates, the actual outcome in terms of rate of growth is thus\nlikely to be somewhat lower than anticipated.\n4.The rate of inflation on a point to point basis, as measured by the Wholesale Price\nindex (WPI), was placed at 5.0 per cent at the end of 1998-99 as compared with 5.3 per cent\nin 1997-98. The actual outcome in respect of inflation was in line with the projected rate of 5\n\u2013 6 per cent in the April statement. It was also in line with expectations in October when the\ninflation rate, which had increased sharply during September-October 1998 due to supply\nproblems in respect of a few agricultural commodities, was expected to reverse itself in the\nsubsequent months of the year.\n5.During 1998-99, the annual growth in M 3 on a point-to-point basis was 17.8 per cent\nas against 17.9 per cent in 1997-98. Expansion of primary liquidity at the end of the year was\nhigher than the last year\u2019s rate, with reserve money increasing by 14.5 per cent as against an\nincrease of 13.2 per cent in the previous year. Aggregate deposits of the scheduled\ncommercial banks increased by 18.5 per cent as against 19.7 per cent in the previous year. It\nmay be mentioned that almost the entire increase in the aggregate deposits was due to\nincrease in time deposits (over Rs.1,00,000 crore) partly on account of the reduction in the\nmaturity period of term deposits from 30 days to 15 days. The sharp increase in time deposits\nmay also reflect the increase in personal disposable income due to implementation of the Pay\nCommission recommendations which could have added to financial savings in various forms,\nincluding time deposits.26.The conventional non-food bank credit showed a lower expansion of Rs.37,594 crore\n(12.1 per cent) as against an increase of Rs.40,789 crore (15.1 per cent) in the previous year.\nThe total flow of funds from scheduled commercial banks to the commercial sector including\nbanks\u2019 investment in bonds/debentures/shares issued by public sector undertakings and\nprivate corporate sector and commercial paper, etc., may be placed at Rs.54,304 crore as\nagainst an increase of Rs.53,377crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Total\nresource flow to the commercial sector including capital issues, GDRs and borrowings from\nfinancial institutions would be lower at Rs.1,04,635 crore than that of Rs.1,06,100 crore in\nthe previous year.\n7.Food credit expansion during the year was of the order of Rs.4,331 crore as against\nRs.4,889 crore in the previous year. Scheduled commercial banks\u2019 investments in\ngovernment securities increased by Rs.35,787 crore during the year as against Rs.28,067\ncrore in the previous year. The share of lending to Government in the overall deployment of\nresources by the scheduled commercial banks during the year was substantially larger than in\nthe preceding year.\n8.As per Revised Est imates in the Union Budget, gross fiscal deficit of the Central\nGovernment (inclusive of small savings) for 1998-99 was higher at 6.5 per cent of GDP as\nagainst the budgeted figure of 5.6 per cent. (Gross fiscal deficit for 1998-99 would work out\nto 4.5 per cent, excluding small savings and on the basis of the new series of GDP.) As a\nresult, gross market borrowing exceeded the budgeted level by around Rs.15,000 crore. The\nnet market borrowing was Rs.62,903 crore for the year 1998-99 and gross market borrowing\nwas Rs.93,953 crore (as against the budgeted level of Rs.79,376 crore).\n9.Continuing large fiscal deficits year after year in 1990s have led to sharp increases in\nrepayment obligations and a reduction in average maturity profile of outstanding public debt.\nIn 1991-92, the gross and net borrowing of the Central Government stood respectively at\nRs.8,988 crore and Rs.8,001 crore in a ratio of 1 : 0.89. Thus, for every rupee of fresh\nborrowing, the Government received 89 paise in net terms. In 1998-99, the gross and net\nborrowing stood respectively at Rs.93,953 crore and Rs.62,903 crore in a ratio of 1 : 0.67.\nThus, the net receipt for every rupee of borrowing is now only 67 paise. Yet another\nconsequence of larger borrowing is the very high increase in interest payments on public debt\ntouching Rs.43,712 crore in 1998-99 (RE). Interest payments on public debt in 1991-92 were\nonly Rs.14,021 crore. Obviously, this process cannot go on indefinitely.\n10.The enlarged borrowing programme of government has als o put pressure on the\nabsorptive capacity of the market. The banking system now holds government securities of\naround 33 per cent of its net demand and time liabilities as against the minimum requirement\nof 25 per cent. In terms of volume, holdings above the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)\namount to Rs.56,000 crore which is almost equivalent to the net borrowing budgeted for\n1999-2000.\n11.Despite large scale gross borrowing by the Government, contrary to market\nexpectations at the beginning of the financial year, the medium and long-term interest rates\nduring the course of the year remained fairly stable. In order to moderate the adverse impact\nof Government\u2019s large borrowing programme on interest rates, in June 1998, the Reserve\nBank had announced its intention to accept private placement of government securities from\ntime to time (in the event of markets\u2019 bids being at substantially higher levels due to\nuncertainties in the market) and release them to the market as conditions improved. This3approach, namely, of accepting private placement and combining it with active Open Market\nOperations (OMO), proved effective in meeting large borrowing requirements of the\ngovernment without causing undue pressure on interest rates. The yield on medium term\nGovernment paper (of 5-year maturity) in March 1999 was only 12 basis points higher than\nin April 1998. The yield on 10-year paper in March 1999 was actually 5 basis points lower\nthan in April 1998. However, it is obvious that sooner or later, the pressure on market interest\nrates will become unavoidable unless fiscal deficit of the Government and its borrowing\nrequirements are kept within reasonable limits.\n12.It is also significant that the above strategy (i.e., private placement combined with\nactive OMO) did not lead to an undue expansion of Reserve Bank\u2019s credit to Central\nGovernment and the reserve money. In fact, latest data show that RBI credit to Central\nGovernment during 1998-99 may be somewhat lower than the previous year. As on April 16,\n1999, i.e., a week before the final closing of Government accounts for 1998-99, the net RBI\ncredit to Central Government was Rs.12,565 crore as against Rs.12,914 crore in 1997-98.\n13.Developments during the past year illustrate the dilemma faced by monetary\nauthorities in a situation of uncertain macro-economic outlook in respect of inflation and\ngrowth, alongside high monetary growth. When the current rate of inflation is low, a high rate\nof growth in money supply nevertheless warrants tightening of liquidity (and increase in\ninterest rates) in order to dampen aggregate demand and to avoid potential problems.\nHowever, if growth of output is also low, tightening of money supply during a period of\nrelatively low inflation may result in a further loss of output. This in turn could result in\nlower revenue and the need for Government to borrow further. A similar dilemma arises\nwhen inflation rate accelerates because of supply shocks which are expected to be temporary.\nThis, for example, was the situation last year when, until October, inflation was accelerating\ndue to lower availability of a few primary commodities. The Reserve Bank at that time chose\nnot to tighten monetary policy in the expectation that the price rise would reverse itself later\nin the year when agricultural supplies improve. In retrospect, this judgement turned out to be\ncorrect. However, if it had not, and inflation had accelerated further, monetary policy would\nhave required much sharper tightening in the subsequent months of the year.\n14.There are thus no s imple objective or \u2018quantitative\u2019 answers to monetary policy\ndilemmas of this type in the short-run. There is no option but to carefully balance conflicting\nconsiderations, and for the monetary authority to be prepared to reverse its \u2018stance\u2019 of policy\nif actual outcome happens to be substantially different from what was expected. As the past\nexperience in India and indeed in other countries, including industrial countries, shows,\nflexibility in respect of monetary policy may have to be exercised in both directions, i.e.,\ntightening as well as loosening as circumstances warrant.\nExternal Developments\n15.The 18-month period since September 1997 has presented major challenges for\nmanagement of the external sector. The East Asian crisis, while showing some signs of\nabatement, continues to be a matter of concern. In addition, Russia was affected by a severe\ncrisis in August 1998 which had global repercussions. Brazil came under severe pressure\nearlier this year, and economic outlook in Japan as well as Europe continues to be uncertain.\nIn addition to the unfavourable external situation, after the Pokhran test last year, India was\nalso confronted with certain other developments. Among these developments were: the\neconomic sanctions imposed by several industrial countries, the suspension of fresh\nmultilateral lending (except for some sectors), the downgrading by international rating4agencies and the reduction in investment by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). Faced with\nthese and other unfavourable developments, the Reserve Bank had to, from time to time, take\nrecourse to monetary and other measures in order to bring about orderliness in the foreign\nexchange market.\n16.Viewed against the above background, developments in respect of both the exchange\nrate of the rupee as well as movements in foreign exchange reserves have been reasonably\nsatisfactory. At the end of the financial year 1998-99, despite pessimistic prognostications by\nseveral experts and market operators, foreign currency assets of the country have increased\nsignificantly in both absolute and net terms (i.e., excluding forward liabilities). In absolute\nterms, the increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year was US $ 3.1 billion. After\nexcluding forward liabilities, the increase during the year was US $ 4.1 billion. Since August\n20, 1998, when certain measures were announced by the Reserve Bank to stabilise the forex\nmarket, the increase in reserves has been even more impressive. The increase was US $ 5.5\nbillion in absolute terms and US $ 6.2 billion net of forward liabilities. At the present level,\nforeign exchange reserves substantially exceed the total stock of short-term and portfolio\nflows. As a matter of cautious policy, India will continue to keep its short-term as well as\nforward liabilities at a low level in relation to the size of its reserves.\n17.The day to day movements in exchange rates are market-determined and will continue\nto remain so. The primary objective of the Reserve Bank in regard to the management of the\nexchange rate is to maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market, and to curb\ndestabilising and self-fulfilling speculative activities. To this end, as in the past, the Reserve\nBank will continue to monitor closely the developments in the financial markets at home and\nabroad, and take such monetary and administrative actions as may be considered necessary\nfrom time to time.\n18.During 1998-99, the current account deficit is likely to be about 1.0 per cent of GDP,\nmuch lower than that recorded in 1997-98 (1.6 per cent). In the year 1999-2000, the current\naccount deficit is projected to be around 1.5 per cent of GDP.\n19.An area of current concern in regard to balance of payments relates to the growth of\nexports. During 1998-99 (upto February), exports have declined by about 2 per cent in US\ndollar terms. While this is partly attributable to sluggish growth in world trade, the\nimportance of accelerating the growth of exports cannot be over-emphasised. An important\npriority for the current year, therefore, would have to concentrate on taking all possible\nmeasures to provide maximum support to export efforts. In line with this objective, the\nReserve Bank had announced a series of measures in February 1999 to make available export\ncredit in foreign currency to exporters at internationally competitive interest rates (with a\nmaximum spread of 1.5 per cent over the LIBOR). Among the new measures to improve the\ndelivery of such credit to exporters are: the provision of \u2018On Line credit\u2019 to exporters, the\nextension of \u2018Line of Credit\u2019 for longer duration for exporters with good track record, the\npeak/non-peak credit facilities to exporters, the permission for inter-changeability of pre-\nshipment and post-shipment credit and meeting the term loan requirements of exporters for\nexpansion of capacity and the modernisation of machinery and upgradation of technology.\nNecessary relaxations have also been made in the procedure for handling of export\ndocuments, fast track clearance of export credit at specialised branches of banks and\nintroduction of a system of periodical submission of statement of LCs or export orders. These\nmeasures should help in ensuring timely availability of export credit in foreign currency and\nremoving procedural hassles.520.A committee of bankers has  also been set up to ensure that procedural problems\ncoming in the way of \u2018exporters\u2019, particularly small exporters, from utilising these new\nfacilities are removed forthwith. This committee will interact closely with branch managers\nas well as exporters, particularly in locations where there is concentration of small and\nmedium scale exporters.\n21.Exporters are also being currently provided post-shipment and pre-shipment credit in\nrupee terms at a concessional rate of 10 per cent. While this rate, in nominal rupee terms\nwould appear higher than the prevailing international interest rates, the foreign currency\nforward premium in forex market in India is also higher at around 7 per cent for 6 months.\nAn exporter can thus avail of rupee pre-shipment credit at 10 per cent and sell expected\nexport earnings in the forward market, effectively reducing interest cost to only around 3 per\ncent. Exporters now have the choice of reducing their interest costs to (or below)\ninternational levels either through this route or by availing of foreign currency loans.\n22.Exporters currently enjoy a facility to retain a portion of their earnings to be utilised\nfor certain purposes under the scheme of Exchange Earners\u2019 Foreign Currency (EEFC)\naccounts. Over a period, improvements have been made in the EEFC scheme by enhancing\nthe retention percentage as also purposes for which the balances in the account can be\nutilised. Presently, the entitlement is 50 per cent for all foreign exchange earners and 70 per\ncent for exporters coming under the categories of export oriented units (EOUs) or of those\nwho operate in export processing zones, etc. These balances can be presently utilised for all\ntrade related expenses outside India as also for payment to residents in foreign exchange in\nconsideration of supply of goods and services, and approved capital account transactions. In\nresponse to suggestions received from exporters, the facility to issue cheques against EEFC\nbalances is also being granted with effect from May 1, 1999. Banks in India, having such\naccounts, will be authorised to issue separate cheque books for operation of these accounts.\n23.At present, one of the conditions subject to which Indian exporters are allowed to\nopen trading offices abroad is that the trading offices should not create any financial\nliabilities, contingent or otherwise on the Head Office in India. The Reserve Bank has been\nreceiving representations from trade bodies to permit overseas trading offices to avail of\ncredit facilities abroad to enable their overseas offices to expand their activities. It has been\ndecided to grant approvals for loans/guarantees in respect of overseas offices of export\nhouses/trading houses/Star Trading Houses/Super Star Trading Houses provided the terms of\nsuch loans/guarantees are reasonable.\n24.The Government of India and  Reserve Bank of India have from time to time\nliberalised various facilities to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Foreign Direct Investors\nand Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). In line with the objective of simplifying administrative\nprocedures and making these facilities investor friendly, the Reserve Bank last year\ncompletely dispensed with the need to apply for prior permission in respect of approved\nforeign direct investments or investments permitted under the automatic route. Recently, the\nReserve Bank has announced certain major procedural simplifications in respect of NRI\ndeposits and other financial transactions. With these changes, NRIs will not have to seek\nspecific permission of the Bank for most transactions and will enjoy the same or better\nfacilities than domestic residents for operating bank accounts in India.625.A Regulation Review Authority has recently been set up to which foreign investors as\nwell as NRIs, in addition to Indian citizens/institutions, can make suggestions for review of\nany regulation or requirement of RBI which affects them.\n26.With effect from June 11, 1998, Foreign Institutional Investors were permitted to take\nforward cover from Authorised Dealers to the extent of 15 per cent of their existing\ninvestment as on that date. Any incremental investment over the level prevailing on June 11,\n1998 was also made eligible for forward cover. It is learnt that not much use has been made\nof this facility so far. The Reserve Bank will encourage FIIs to take full advantage of this\nfacility. As a simplification measure, the above mentioned limits will henceforth apply to\nFIIs\u2019 outstanding investments as on March 31, 1999. In other words, 15 per cent of\noutstanding investment on March 31, 1999 as well as the entire amount \u2013 100 per cent \u2013 of\nany additional investment made after this date will be eligible for forward cover. As a\nmeasure of further liberalisation, until further notice, any FII which has exhausted the limits\nmentioned above can apply to RBI for additional forward cover for a further 15 per cent of\ntheir outstanding investments in India at the end of March 1999. Applications for further\nadditional limits can be made more than once after the earlier limits have been exhausted. It\nmay be mentioned that a case-by-case approach for approval of additional  limits would be\npreferred in order to avoid building up of large unutilised positions. This should reduce the\nrisk arising from these positions being suddenly activated in the event of unexpected\nvolatility in the forex markets.\nII. Stance of Monetary Policy for 1999-2000\n27.A major challenge for monetary policy in 1999-2000 is the need to reconcile the\nconflicting objectives of restraining the overall growth of liquidity in order to ensure price-\nstability, and at the same time facilitating the flow of adequate bank credit for productive\nsectors of the economy in order to improve growth. If industrial growth picks up, this may\nalso help in restraining the Government\u2019s demand for additional credit from the banking\nsector.\n28.The annual rate of inflation, after reaching a high of 8.8 per cent on September 26,\n1998 has come down to 4.6 per cent in the week ended  April 3, 1999. Whether this trend will\ncontinue will not be known until July-August when the monsoon position would become\nclearer. Assuming a normal monsoon, and the absence of unanticipated supply shocks, it\nshould be possible to maintain reasonable price stability during the current year without\ntaking recourse to monetary measures. The fact that international commodity prices are\nexpected to remain relatively soft should also contribute to the objective of maintaining price\nstability. Another positive factor is that at present India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are at a\nrecord level. The current level of buffer stock of foodgrains, wheat and rice at about 11\nmillion tonnes and at 12 million tonnes respectively, is also a source of comfort for supply\nmanagement.\n29.Keeping the above considerations in view and the paramount need to raise industrial\ngrowth, the current stance of monetary policy will continue to be in the direction of\nfacilitating adequate availability of liquidity along with stable medium and long-term interest\nrates, with policy preference for softening to the extent circumstances permit. This stance of\nmonetary policy was reflected in the measures announced by the Reserve Bank on March 1,\n1999. The repo rate was reduced by 2 percentage points and the Bank Rate and the Cash\nReserve Ratio were reduced by 1 percentage point and one-half of one percentage point,7respectively. Banks and financial institutions have also subsequently announced their\ndecisions to lower prime lending rates.\n30.During the past 18 months, the Bank Rate, repo rate and Cash Reserve Ratio  (CRR)\nlevels have been used more than once to meet short-term monetary policy objectives in the\nlight of emerging domestic and external situations. The Bank Rate and short-term repo rate\nannounced by RBI have been increasingly perceived by the markets as signals for movements\nin market rates of interest, in particular the call money rates. This development is significant\nin that it increases the range of instruments available to RBI for influencing developments in\nthe money and term money markets. In particular, while movements in the Bank Rate should\nnot be too frequent , the short-term repo rate can be varied much more flexibly, in both\ndirections, to influence the flow and cost of funds in the short run. The variation in CRR has\nalso served as one of the important instruments for regulating liquidity in the economy, and\nthe recent experience shows that intra-year variations in CRR have been effective in meeting\nthe short-term challenges in domestic money and forex markets. While the long-term\nobjective of monetary policy will continue to be in the direction of reducing the average level\nof CRR, in the short-term, the level of CRR could be varied in both directions depending on\nthe assessment of the overall monetary situation.\n31.As pointed out in the pre ceding section, during 1998-99, the Reserve Bank had, in\nview of uncertainty in financial markets, deliberately adopted a policy of accepting private\nplacement of Government securities initially and then unloading Government securities in the\nmarket through active Open Market Operations (OMO). This policy has proved to be a\nconsiderable success as large government borrowing requirements during the year were met\nwith little or no increase in medium and long-term interest rates. The policy of careful\nmanagement of Government borrowing requirements through a combination of auctions,\nprivate placement and OMO, will, therefore, need to be persevered with. However, it is\nobvious that in view of the large stock of outstanding Government debt with banks and other\ninstitutions, the above combination of policies would succeed in maintaining a stable interest\nrate environment only if Government\u2019s market borrowing requirements are kept within\nreasonable limits.\n32.In the Monetary Policy Statement of April 1998, a menti on was made of the Reserve\nBank\u2019s intention to use multiple indicator approach for assessing the position of financial\nmarkets. The objective is to widen the range of variables that could be taken into account for\nmonetary policy purposes rather than rely solely on a single instrument variable, such as,\ngrowth in broad money (M 3). The experience of 1998-99 shows that money supply\nmovements alone could not have provided adequate guidance for monetary policy initiatives\nduring the year. The movements in money market rates of interest, exchange rates, foreign\nexchange reserves, credit to Government and commercial sector and fiscal position of the\nGovernment have been closely monitored and utilised for policy actions. The end result was\nthat while liquidity conditions were kept easy, stability of prices, interest and exchange rates\nwas also substantially secured, notwithstanding the increase in money supply.\n33.It is against this background that there is a need for developing a robust short-term\noperational model, which takes into account the behavioural relationships among the different\nsegments of the financial sector. Such an exercise would help improve understanding of the\ntransmission mechanism of monetary policy in pursuit of objectives during the transition to\ngreater financial integration. The changing dimensions of the financial sector also require that\nthe collection of financial statistics in India is considerably enlarged. The recommendations8of the Working Group on \u2018Money Supply: Analytics and Methodology of Compilation\u2019 have\nbeen helpful in this regard. Banks have been advised to provide data on their operations so\nthat the compilation of money supply aggregates would be able to reflect better the liquidity\nposition.\n34.As highlighted in the previ ous section, monetary growth (M 3) in 1998-99 as well as in\n1997-98 was well above the projected levels. Ideally, therefore, it would be desirable to aim\nat a lower M 3 growth in 1999-2000 than the rate of growth of 15.0 to 15.5 per cent projected\nfor the previous two years. However, keeping in view the Government\u2019s market borrowing\nrequirements, an unduly restrictive credit policy could militate against the need to enhance\ngrowth prospects. Keeping these considerations in view, a reasonable projection for M 3\ngrowth in 1999-2000 would be in the range of 15.5 to 16.0 per cent. This range is well below\nthe actual M 3 growth in each of the last three years.\n35.Assuming normal monsoon and some recovery in industry, GDP growth in the current\nyear is projected to be in the range of 6 to 7 per cent as compared with CSO\u2019s preliminary\nestimate of 5.8 per cent growth for the year 1998-99. Along with achieving this order of\ngrowth, an important macro-economic priority during the year would be to contain the\ninflation rate around the present level of about 5 per cent per annum (allowing, of course, for\nseasonal variations during the course of the year).\n36.Consistent with a money supply growth of 15.5 to 16 per cent, a working estimate for\nthe expansion in aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks is placed at Rs.1,18,500\ncrore (16.5 per cent) in 1999-2000. Non-food bank credit including investments in\ncommercial paper, shares/debentures/bonds of PSUs and private corporate sector is projected\nto increase by about 18 per cent. Availability of this order of credit should fully meet the\ndemand of the productive sectors of the economy. Banks are advised to plan their credit\noperations on the assumption that sufficient liquidity would be available in the current year to\nfinance additional production as per normal banking norms.\n37.In sum, under normal circumstances \u2013 and barring unanticipated developments  in\ndomestic or international situation -- the overall stance of policy for 1999-2000 will be:\nprovision of reasonable liquidity; stable interest rates with policy preference for softening to\nthe extent circumstances permit; active debt-management; orderly development of financial\nmarkets; and further steps in financial sector reforms.\nIII. Financial Sector Reforms and\nMonetary Policy Measures\n38.Monetary and Credit Policy statement of April and the \u2018Mid-Term Review\u2019 of\nOctober last year had focussed on \u2018structural\u2019 measures to strengthen the financial system and\nimprove the functioning of various segments of the financial market. In the current year also,\nit is proposed to carry forward the direction of financial reforms initiated in recent years,\nkeeping in view the actual experience in implementation, the current state of banks and\nfinancial institutions, and other pertinent developments.\n39.As mentioned above, an immediate priority in the current year is to further facilitate\nthe flow of credit to the commercial sector. In the past few months, the Reserve Bank has\nannounced a number of measures to improve the credit delivery system particularly for\nagriculture, exports, small-scale industry and Information Technology. This statement briefly9takes stock of the present position in this regard and announces certain further measures to\nimprove credit delivery and reduce procedural problems. Another priority area in the current\nyear is to ensure that our banking and payment systems are fully \u2018Y2K\u2019 compliant. As only a\nfew months remain before the entire global financial system will be put to this test, the\nimportance of paying the highest attention to this area can hardly be over-emphasised.\nCash Reserve Ratio\n40.The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) to be maintained by scheduled commercial banks\n(excluding Regional Rural Banks) will be reduced by one-half of one percentage point from\n10.5 per cent to 10.0 per cent effective fortnight beginning May 8, 1999. This reduction in\nCRR would augment the lendable resources of banks by about Rs.3,250 crore.\nInterim Liquidity Adjustment Facility\n41.In the October 1998 \u2018Mid-Term Revi ew\u2019, it was indicated that the Reserve Bank\nbroadly agrees with the Narasimham Committee\u2019s suggestion that RBI support to the market\nshould be through a Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) operated by way of repo and\nreverse repos providing a reasonable corridor for market play. Pending further upgradation in\ntechnology and legal/procedural changes to facilitate electronic transfer and settlement, it has\nnow been decided to introduce an Interim Liquidity Adjustment Facility (ILAF) through\nrepos and lending against collateral of Government of India securities.  The features of this\nfacility, are given below:\n(i) The general refinance facility is being withdrawn with immediate effect. It will be\nreplaced by a collateralised lending facility (CLF) up to 0.25 per cent of the\nfortnightly average outstanding aggregate deposits in 1997-98 which will be available\nfor two weeks at the Bank Rate. An additional collateralised lending facility (ACLF)\nfor an equivalent amount of CLF will also be available at the Bank Rate plus 2 per\ncent. CLF and ACLF availed for periods beyond two weeks will be subject to a penal\nrate of 2 per cent for an additional two week period. There will be a cooling period of\ntwo weeks thereafter. The current restriction on participation in money market (during\nthe period that such facilities are availed of) will be withdrawn in order to facilitate\nsystemic adjustment in liquidity.\n(ii) Scheduled commercial banks are eligible for export credit refinance facility (ERF) at\nthe Bank Rate (i.e., 8.0 per cent per annum) with effect from April 1, 1999. The\nexisting facility for export refinance will continue.\n(iii) Liquidity support against collateral of government securities, based on bidding\ncommitment and other parameters, will be available to Primary Dealers at the Bank\nRate and the amounts will remain constant throughout the year. Each drawal will,\nhowever, be subject to the usual restriction of repayment within 90 days. The limits\nfor individual PDs will be announced separately.\n(iv) Additional liquidity support against collateral of government securities will also be\nprovided to Primary Dealers for periods not exceeding two weeks at a time and the\ninterest rate will be at the Bank Rate plus 2 per cent. The limits for individual PDs\nwill be announced separately.10(v) Absorption of liquidity in the market will continue to be through fixed rate repos.\n(vi) The above facilities will be supplemented by open market operations in government\ndated securities and treasury bills by RBI.\n42.  Thus, the ILAF would provide a mechanism by which liquidity would be injected at\nvarious interest rates, and absorbed when necessary at the fixed repo rate, so that the\nvolatility in the money market is minimised and the market operates within a reasonable\nrange.\nDevelopment of Financial Markets\nMoney Market\n43.  To improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and develop further the\nmoney and debt markets in the light of the recommendations made by the Narasimham\nCommittee it has been decided to develop the repos market with appropriate regulatory\nsafeguards, such as, delivery versus payment (DVP), uniform accounting, valuation and\ndisclosure norms and restricting repos to instruments held in dematerialised form with a\ndepository. These prudential safeguards have been designed to ensure transparency and\naccountability as also increasing at the same time liquidity and depth in the securities market.\n44.   Accordingly, it has been decided to allow UTI, LIC, IDBI and other non-bank\nparticipants in the money market to access short term liquidity through repos thereby\nfacilitating their cash management and gradual move out of the call money market.\n45.   Detailed guidelines to widen further the number of participants in the repos market\nthrough exchange traded repos in debt instruments held in demat form under a tri-party\narrangement, with adequate safeguards to manage risks, are also being finalised and will be\nissued shortly.\n46.\u2018Cheque writing facility\u2019 by Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs) provides more\nliquidity to unit holders and hence has been advocated in the interest of savers. It has been\ndecided to accept this suggestion and permit MMMFs to henceforth, offer \u2018cheque writing\u2019\nfacility to their investors.\n47.  Annexure I gives details of the various measures for developing the money market.\n48.  To facilitate hedging of interest rate risks and ensuring orderly development of the\nderivatives market, guidelines for interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements (FRAs) are\nbeing issued separately.\nGovernment Securities Market\n49.    Increasing the depth and liquidity in the government securities market is critical to the\ndevelopment of the debt market. With the number of primary dealers having now increased to\nthirteen (after three PDs were recently given final approval), it is expected that the PDs will\nplay a greater role in the absorption of the primary issues and in market making. Accordingly,\nin consultation with PDs, it has been decided (a) to obtain minimum bidding commitment\nfrom each PD for the auctions of Treasury Bills so that together they absorb 100 per cent of\nthe notified amount, and (b) to offer an enhanced underwriting option to PDs for the entire\nnotified amount in auctions of dated securities.1150.The market participants have  suggested that there should be a greater certainty in the\ntiming and quantum of primary issues so as to give them sufficient time to plan their\ninvestments in government securities. It is therefore proposed to announce a calendar for\nissue of Treasury Bills for the entire year. As announced in the Monetary and Credit policy\nfor the first half of 1998-99, it is also proposed to introduce 182 day Treasury Bill which will\nbe issued every fortnight as part of the calendar.\n51.Consolidation of outstanding loans is necessary for ensuring suff icient volumes and\nliquidity in any one issue. Such consolidation also facilitates the emergence of benchmarks\nand development of the Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities\n(STRIPS). Accordingly it is proposed to have the option of issuing new loans on price basis\ninstead of on yield basis as is done currently.\n52.In order to promote the retail market segment, the Reserve Bank has taken a series of\nsteps like extension of liquidity support to setting up of mutual funds dedicated to\ngovernment securities, establishment and enlargement of a number of primary and satellite\ndealers and permission given to banks to freely buy and sell government securities on\noutright basis, etc. An in-house Group has been set up to look into the ways and mechanics of\ngiving a boost to retailing of government securities. The Reserve Bank and Government of\nIndia would work out a package which will include publicity campaigns as well.\n53.  The details of measures relating to government securities market are at Annexure II.\nRationalisation of Interest Rates\n54.At present, on the deposit side, only the saving deposit rate (which is at 4.5 per cent\nper annum currently) is prescribed by RBI. Banks are otherwise free to offer interest rates on\ndeposits of any maturity above 15 days. They are also free to offer a fixed rate or a floating\nrate on term deposits. On the lending side, after deregulation, banks are free to prescribe their\nown lending rates, including the Prime Lending Rate (PLR), after duly taking into\nconsideration their cost of funds, transaction cost and minimum spread. The only lending\nrates now prescribed by the Reserve Bank are the concessional rates (below the PLR of the\nrespective banks) for certain sectors like exports, small loans of upto Rs.2 lakh, and under the\ndifferential rate of interest scheme (DRI). Banks now have sufficient flexibility to decide\ntheir deposit and lending rate structures and manage their assets and liabilities efficiently.\nWith a view to providing some more flexibility, the following measures in respect of interest\nrates are being introduced.\n55.The PLR system with a spread between PLR and the maximum lending rate that is\ndetermined by the banks\u2019 Boards has been in operation for some time now and has by and\nlarge served the purpose of ensuring transparency and objectivity. Banks are currently\npermitted to operate, two PLRs -- one for short term and the other for long term loans. There\nhave been requests from Banks and borrowers for tenor linked PLR, i.e., PLR for different\nmaturities. It has been decided to provide banks with freedom to operate different PLRs for\ndifferent maturities provided the transparency and uniformity of treatment originally\nenvisaged continues to be maintained.\n56.Similarly, industry, e specially those investors requiring project finance, have been\nrequesting for fixity of interest rates on term loans. It has been decided to permit banks to\noffer fixed rate loans subject to conformity to ALM guidelines.1257.At present banks cannot charg e interest on advances against fixed deposits at rates\nexceeding PLR. While PLR has been coming down, the interest rates on deposits have\nremained unaltered on the existing deposits. In certain cases this has resulted in the interest\nrate on advances based on PLR being lower than the interest rate on the deposits themselves.\nIn order to remove this anomaly, it has been decided that in all such cases of deposit rate\nbeing in excess of PLR, advances to depositors against fixed deposits can be made by banks\nwithout reference to the ceiling of PLR and banks can charge suitable interest rates. This will\nbe applicable both for domestic and non-resident deposits.\n58.Banks have been representing that the present requirement that all changes in deposit\nrates and lending rates should be approved by the Board of Directors of the bank restricts the\nability of banks to respond promptly to changes in interest rate environment. Accordingly, it\nhas been decided that the Boards of Directors of banks may delegate necessary powers to\nAsset Liability Management Committee for fixing interest rates on deposits and advances\nsubject to reporting to the Board immediately thereafter.\nPrudential Measures\n59.As a part of economic reforms, since the early nineties, the capital adequa cy and other\nprudential norms of banks have been strengthened and currently are close to international\nstandards. In terms of inherent robustness, it is also well recognised that the Indian banking\nsystem\u2019s exposure to real estate or shares is negligible, while open foreign currency exposure\nlimits are severely restricted. Their off-balance sheet liabilities are also very small due to\nregulatory restrictions while a relatively large part of banking system\u2019s assets are in secure\ninvestments particularly in government and other approved securities. These are important\nstrengths of the Indian banks which contribute to the long-term financial viability of the\nbanking system as a whole.\n60.In the \u2018Mid-Term Review\u2019 of October 1998, certain important changes reco mmended\nby the Narasimham Committee in respect of prudential norms, risk weights and exposure\nnorms were announced. These changes were designed to reduce the risk exposure of banks,\nstrengthen their financial soundness, and contribute to improved profitability outlook. As a\ncontinuation of this process, the following measures are being notified shortly:\n(i) With a view to adopting prudent accounting standards and moving towards `mark to\nmarket\u2019 valuation of the investment portfolio, banks were advised to classify a\nminimum of 70 per cent of their investment in approved securities as current\ninvestments for the year ending March 1999. With effect from the year ending March\n31, 2000, banks will have to classify a minimum of 75 per cent of their securities as\ncurrent investments.\n(ii) Banks were recently permitted to issue subordinated debt instruments for augmenting\ntheir Tier II Capital. It has been observed that there has been a high level of cross-\nholding of such instruments among banks and financial institutions, without\nnecessarily leading to accretion of capital to the financial system. It has been decided\nthat a bank\u2019s or a financial institution\u2019s investment in Tier II bonds issued by other\nbanks be subjected to a ceiling of 10 per cent of the bank\u2019s or FI\u2019s total capital.\n61.At present, in respect of advances where terms of the loan agreement regarding\ninterest and principal have been renegotiated or rescheduled after commencement of\nproduction, banks are required to classify them as sub-standard for at least two years of13satisfactory performance under the re-negotiated or rescheduled terms. Banks have\nrepresented that in certain situations (e.g. cyclical down-turn) where loans have been\nrescheduled, but where borrowers have started servicing their loans on a regular basis after a\nshort gap, the prescribed waiting period of two years is much too long. It has been decided\nthat the waiting period of two years may be reduced to one year (or four quarters) if the\ninterest and instalment of loans have been serviced regularly as per the terms of rescheduling.\n62.Banks and financial institutions, as well as borrowers, have represented that detailed\nprescription by the Reserve Bank regarding the concept of \u2018commencement of commercial\nproduction\u2019 is creating operational difficulties. This is more so in the case of services and\ninfrastructure sectors where commencement of production is difficult to pinpoint. The\nposition has been reviewed and as part of the process of moving away from micro-level\nregulations, the Reserve Bank has decided that henceforth it will be left to the Board of\nDirectors of each bank to prescribe detailed rules for determining the date of commencement\nof commercial production of units.\n63.The Reserve Bank has already issued guidelines to banks f or setting up of Asset\nLiability Management (ALM) systems. It is proposed to issue ALM guidelines to financial\ninstitutions as well. A draft of the proposed guidelines will be separately circulated to\nfinancial institutions for comments before finalisation.\nMicro Credit and Venture Capital\n64.   Micro-credit Institutions and Self-Help Groups (SHG) are important vehicles for\ndelivery of credit to self-employed persons, particularly women in rural and semi-urban\nareas. RBI, therefore, attaches particular importance to the work of NABARD and public\nsector banks in this area. A special cell, manned by a senior officer from the commercial\nbanking sector with practical experience in this area, is being set up in RBI in order to liaise\nwith NABARD and micro-credit institutions for augmenting the flow of credit to this sector.\nThe time frame for the cell to complete its work will be one year and its proposals will be\ngiven the highest attention.\n65.Several institutions engaged in micro credit have represented tha t interest rates\napplicable to bank loans extended to micro-credit organisations should be left free to be\ndecided by banks as per normal policy and should not be linked to the interest rate ceiling\napplicable for direct small loans to individual beneficiaries. It is proposed to accept this\nsuggestion. While direct loans below certain levels by banks will continue to be subject to the\ninterest rate ceiling as prescribed by RBI from time to time, interest rates applicable to loans\ngiven by banks to micro-credit organisations or by these organisations to their\nmembers/beneficiaries will be left to their discretion. It is clarified that interest rates and\nother terms in respect of Government sponsored programmes, such as IRDP, will remain as\nthey are, and there will be no change in applicable interest rate ceilings in respect of loans\nunder Government programmes.\n66.Incremental credit given to NBFCs by banks for on-lending to small road and water\ntransport operators and to units in tiny sector of industry, over March 31, 1999, will also\nqualify for priority sector status.\n67.In order to encourage the flow of finance for venture capital, the overall ceiling of\ninvestment by banks in ordinary shares, convertible debentures of corporates and units of\nmutual funds, etc., which is currently at 5 per cent of their incremental deposits will stand14automatically enhanced to the extent of banks\u2019 investments in venture capital. It has also been\ndecided to include investments in venture capital in priority sector lending.\nCredit for Infrastructure\n68.The Reserve Bank of India has been addressing important aspects of financing of\ninfrastructure projects in view of the national importance attached to infrastructure\ndevelopment. RBI has finalised operational guidelines, in consultation with select banks and\nfinancial institutions for extending credit for such projects. Banks/Fis will be free to sanction\nterm loans for technically feasible, financially viable and bankable projects undertaken by\nboth public and private sector undertakings subject to prescribed criteria. Four broad modes\nof financing have also been identified, viz., financing through funds raised by way of\nsubordinated debt, entering into take-out financing, direct financing through rupee term loans,\ndeferred payment guarantee, foreign currency loans, etc., and investments in infrastructure\nbonds. These have been set in the framework of asset-liability management and prudential\nexposure norms. Banks are also being permitted to issue inter-institutional guarantee subject\nto certain norms.\n69.To ensure timely and adequate availability of credit, banks/F Is are advised to clearly\ndelineate the procedure for approval of loan proposals and institute a suitable monitoring\nmechanism for reviewing applications pending beyond the specified period. Banks/FIs are\nurged to ensure close coordination with each other as also other agencies concerned in order\nto avoid repetitive appraisals and delays, and set up a mechanism for monitoring the project\nimplementation.\nSettlement Advisory Committee\n70.   Banks have taken several measures to reduce their NPAs through recovery drive,\ncompromise settlements, etc. Guidelines have also been issued to banks in 1995 for entering\ninto compromise settlements for recovery of NPAs. It has been represented that the present\nsystem and procedure of compromise settlement as it operates in reality, is often long drawn,\ndiscretionary and cumbersome. Accordingly, Government has directed public sector banks to\nset up Settlement Advisory Committees (SACs) so that chronic cases, specially those relating\nto the small sector, are settled in a timely and speedy manner. Accordingly, a scheme for\nSettlement Advisory Committee (SAC) has been finalised by RBI and details are being\nreleased separately.\nRegulation of Non-Banking\nFinancial Companies (NBFCs)\n71.Pursuant to the amendment of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 by the Parliament,\nRBI had instituted a comprehensive regulatory framework for NBFCs in January1998. Out of\nabout 8802 applications of NBFCs which were eligible for registration on the basis of\nminimum Net Owned Funds (NOF) of Rs.25 lakh, registration has been granted to 7555\nNBFCs of which only 584 NBFCs have been permitted to accept public deposits and\napplications of 1030 companies have been rejected. As many as 28,676 companies with NOF\nbelow Rs.25 lakh, as provided in the Act, have been given time upto January 8, 2000 to\nachieve the minimum NOF. Following the report of the Vasudev Committee, a number of\nchanges have also been made in the regulatory framework for NBFCs in the light of the\nexperience gained, so as to facilitate orderly growth of NBFCs. RBI has also launched a\npublic information campaign so that depositors should satisfy themselves about the15genuineness and soundness of NBFCs before they deposit their savings with them. RBI will\ncontinue to closely monitor the effectiveness of the regulatory framework for the NBFCs.\n72.An examination of the  data collected by RBI during the process of registration of the\nexisting NBFCs has revealed that an important problem in their effective functioning is the\nlow level of NOF of most NBFCs. Low capitalisation reduces their ability to withstand\ncyclical fluctuations in business and limits their ability to provide a minimum level of service\nto depositors as well as borrowers. Under the Act, RBI has been vested with the powers of\nenhancing the minimum NOF of NBFCs to Rs. 2 crore (as against the minimum limit of\nRs.25 lakh at present). In respect of new NBFCs, which are incorporated on or after April 20,\n1999 and which seek registration with RBI, it is proposed to raise the requirement of\nminimum NOF to Rs. 2 crore. This stipulation will not apply to NBFCs which are already\nregistered with RBI or whose applications are presently under consideration.\nState Co-operative Banks\n73.State Co-operative Banks are at present provided accommodation from the Reserve\nBank towards general banking business such as clearing adjustments, liquidity, etc., at \u2018Bank\nRate plus 2.5 percentage points\u2019. Henceforth, it has been decided to provide such\naccommodation to State Co-operative Banks at the Bank Rate.\nUrban Co-operative Banks\n74.Co-operative banks, both in urban and rural areas, are a vital component of the\ninstitutional structure for providing banking services. In respect of urban co-operative banks,\npursuant to the recommendations of the Marathe Committee (1992), the Reserve Bank has\nfollowed a liberal licensing policy. As a result, the urban co-operative banking structure has\ngrown phenomenally in the recent past. Currently, there are as many as 1900 urban co-\noperative banks in the country. While a number of these are performing well, and are viable\nand profitable, a fair number are showing signs of persistent weaknesses in their portfolio.\nThere are also certain other issues relating to entry point norms, uneven growth in different\ngeographical regions, and branch licensing policy which require fresh consideration. In order\nto examine these and other relevant issues, it has been decided to appoint a High Power\nCommittee to review the performance of the urban co-operative banks and suggest measures\nfor strengthening this vital sector.\nPayment and Settlement System\nand Y2K Compliance\n75.In the last policy statement, the objective of moving eventually to an integrated\npayment and settlement system was mentioned. Towards this end, a number of initiatives\nhave been taken. The VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) based network is going to be in\noperation soon, and messaging standards and common applications to be on use on the\nnetwork are being finalised. EFT (electronic fund transfer) guidelines are being made user-\nfriendly along with adequate security in place. Electronic clearing service both for credits and\ndebits to cover bulk low value transactions such as dividend/interest payments and collection\nof electricity bills, etc., is being expanded. The MICR cheque processing centres at the four\nmetropolitan cities are being replaced by modern, state-of-the-art scaleable systems. Some\npublic sector banks have set up MICR cheque processing centres in a number of other cities.\nThe Reserve Bank will expand the VSAT based network in order to ensure that both funds\nand non-funds business are placed on an on-line basis as soon as possible. A National\nPayments Council with a Deputy Governor as the Chairman and representative membership16is being constituted. It is planned to have real time gross settlement (RTGS) system in place\nin the next 15 to18 months.\n76.   The financial sector has responded reasonably well to the Reserve Bank\u2019s initiative in\nSeptember 1997 to take necessary actions to be Y2K compliant. In March 1998, a Working\nGroup under the Chairmanship of a Deputy Governor was set up to monitor the Y2K\ncompliance on a monthly basis. The status on it was published in December 1998 by the\nReserve Bank of India and was placed on the RBI website. Regular meetings between the\nbanks and RBI in recent months have helped to give confidence that the system would not\ncarry the Y2K risk. The Chief Executives of banks are requested to continue to bestow high\npersonal attention in the remaining part of the year to ensure that business continuity into the\nnew millenium is assured. Besides, as a matter of caution, contingency plans would need to\nbe set in place by banks quickly and reports on the same be forwarded to the Reserve bank.\nThe information about the Y2K compliance position in the financial sector is being shared\nwith the groups working on Y2K compliance in the rest of the economy.\nMid-term Review\n77.A review of cr edit and monetary developments in the first half of the current year will\nbe undertaken in October 1999. This mid-term review will generally be confined to a review\nof monetary developments and to such changes as may be necessary in monetary policy and\nprojections for the second half of the year.\nMumbai,\nApril 20, 1999.\nAnnexure I\nMeasures for Developing the Money Market\n(a) Call/Notice Money Market\nIt was indicated in the \u2018Mid-Term Review\u2019 of October 1998 that the Reserve Bank\nagrees, in principle, with the suggestion of the Narasimham Committee II and aims to\nultimately move towards a pure inter-bank call/notice/ term money market, including primary\ndealers. This will be implemented in a manner that the existing lenders in the market will\nhave operational flexibility to adjust their asset-liability structure. Accordingly, the following\nmeasures are being introduced:\n\u2022 First, with a view to enabling non-bank participants to deploy their short-term resources it\nhas been decided to widen the repo market. Non-bank participation in a variety of other\ninstruments will also have to be improved.\n\u2022 Secondly, taking into consideration the transitional problems, it has also been decided to\ncontinue with the present system of permitting financial institutions and mutual funds to\nlend in the call/notice money market for some more time along with permission to\nparticipate in the repos market spelt out separately in this Statement. This measure is\nexpected to give financial institutions and mutual funds some time to adjust their asset-\nliability structure and also help them to redeploy their short-term surpluses in other\nmoney market instruments.\n\u2022 Thirdly, with a view to mitigating the problems of non-bank entities, the exact timeframe\nfor phasing out the non-bank participants from the inter-bank call/notice money market17will be synchronised with the development of the repos market and worked out after a\nreview of developments in the next six months.\n\u2022 Fourthly, it has been decided that permission given to non-bank entities to lend in the\ncall/notice money market by routing their call/notice money market operations through\nPrimary Dealers will be available only upto end- December 1999.\n(b) Repos and Reverse Repos\nAt present, all scheduled commercial banks, co-operative banks, Primary Dealers and\nSatellite Dealers are permitted to undertake ready forward transactions in all Central\nGovernment securities including Treasury Bills provided the transactions are settled through\nSGL Accounts maintained at the Public Debt Office of the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.\nNon-bank entities as notified by the Central Government have also been permitted to lend\nmoney through reverse repos to other eligible participants. An internal sub-group of the\nTechnical Advisory Committee on Government Securities Market recently looked into\nvarious aspects of the repos market, including issues such as the legal status, the regulatory\nframework and standardisation of accounting practices. In view of the recommendations of\nthe sub-group, it is proposed that:\n\u2022 Non-bank entities which are currently permitted to undertake reverse repos will\nhenceforth be permitted to borrow money through repos on par with banks and Primary\nDealers.\n\u2022 To help develop the term money market as also the inter-bank money market as a purely\n\u2018inter-bank\u2019 market, it is clarified that the Reserve Bank would impose no restriction on\nthe maximum period for which repos can be undertaken.\nIn the Monetary and Credit Policy for the First Half of 1997-98, it was decided to\nallow repos in such bonds which are held in demat form and where transactions are done on\nrecognised stock exchanges. In so far as repos in PSU bonds and other corporate bonds are\nconcerned, the proposals in the recent budget to abolish stamp duty on transfer of debt\ninstruments within the depository mode will facilitate active repos in these instruments.\n\u2022 The Reserve Bank proposes to allow repos in government securities (including State\ngovernment securities), PSU bonds and other bonds of corporates and all India financial\ninstitutions held in demat form in depositories and transactions done in authorised stock\nexchanges provided certain critical conditions relating to ensuring daily mark to market,\nmargin calls, delivery versus payment, etc. are fulfilled.\n  Detailed guidelines will be issued shortly.\n(c) Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs)\nIt has been observed that some liquid schemes of private sector mutual funds have started\noffering \u2018cheque writing\u2019 facility recently. Such a facility provides more liquidity to unit\nholders and hence has been advocated in the interest of savers. Hence, it is considered useful\nto give definitive framework for such a facility.\n\u2022 It has, therefore, been decided to permit MMMFs to henceforth, offer \u2018cheque writing\u2019\nfacility to their investors. MMMFs being non-banks, cannot provide this facility directly.18The \u2018cheque writing\u2019 facility has to be in the nature of a tie-up arrangement with a bank\nand subject to conditions that are being detailed separately.\nAnnexure II\nMeasures for Developing Government Securities Market\na) Dated Government Securities\nPresently, the issuance of Government dated securities through auction is on the yield basis.\nThis implies that each time the Government enters the market for borrowing, a new loan is\nissued with a separate nomenclature. This system has resulted in large number of issuances\nwith differing coupons and interest payment dates affecting the liquidity in any one issue. In\norder to facilitate evolving benchmark securities and reissuance of existing Government\ndated securities, there have been suggestions from the market participants to consolidate the\noutstanding loans. This has been endorsed by the Technical Advisory Committee on\nGovernment Securities market as well.\n\u2022 It is, therefore, proposed to exercise the option, whenever considered appropriate, of\nissuing Government dated securities on a price-basis.\nIt has been widely recognised that in order to widen and deepen the Government securities\nmarket, it is essential to diversify the investor base. In this context, retailing of the\nGovernment securities market assumes critical importance. Reserve Bank of India has\nalready established a system of Primary Dealers and satellite dealers and liquidity support by\nRBI has been made available to them. Recently, the number of Primary Dealers have been\nincreased. The RBI has announced special liquidity support for dedicated gilt funds. Banks\nhave been allowed to freely buy and sell Government securities on an outright basis and retail\nGovernment securities to non-bank clients without any restriction on the period between the\nsale and purchase. With a view to enabling the dematerialisation of securities of retail\nholders, NSDL, SHCIL and NSCCL have been allowed to open SGL account with RBI.\n\u2022 In order to further encourage the retail segment of the market, the Reserve Bank and the\nGovernment of India would jointly work out a package which will include promotion and\npublicity campaigns, etc.\nb) Treasury Bills\nWhile announcing the monetary and credit policy for the first half of 1998-99, a proposal was\nmade to reintroduce 182 day Treasury Bills on a fortnightly basis. Due to market uncertainty,\nthe same could not be implemented.\n\u2022 It has been decided to commence auctions of 182 day Treasury Bills consistent with a\ncalendar of issue for Treasury Bills.\nAt present, Treasury Bills of various maturities (viz., 364 days, 91 days and 14 days) are\nissued on auction basis. The 364 day bills are issued on fortnightly basis whereas 91 day and\n14 day Treasury Bills are issued every week. While the date of issuance of the bills is known\nto the market in advance the information regarding the notified amount is announced prior to\neach auction. A normally constant notified amount (with discretion to RBI to change the19notified amounts if essential) in the Treasury Bill segment would be helpful in evolving a\nmeaningful benchmark for pricing of money market instruments.\n\u2022 Accordingly, it has been decided that the auction of 14 day and 91 day Treasury Bills will\nbe held on a weekly basis (with the day of auction on Friday and day of payment on\nSaturday) and the auction of 182 day Treasury Bills and 364 day Treasury Bills will be\nheld on a fortnightly basis (day of auction on Wednesday and day of payment on\nThursday). The notified amounts in respect of the Treasury Bills auctions will be pre-\nannounced for the whole year separately.\nAt present the State Governments are permitted to invest their surplus funds in 14 and 91 day\nTreasury bills as non-competitive bidders. In order to give further fillip to the Treasury bills\nmarket as also to provide the State Governments more flexibility in their investments of\nsurplus funds, it has been decided to permit the State Governments to put bids on non-\ncompetitive basis in the auctions for 182 and 364 days Treasury bills as well.\n\u2022 It has also been decided to allow the State Governments to avail of Special Ways and\nMeans Advances (WMA) against the collateral of their investments in Treasury Bills in\naddition to their holdings in dated Government of India securities as at present.\nc) System of Underwriting by PDs\nThree new primary dealers have been given final approval, taking the total  number of PDs to\nthirteen. With sufficient competition amongst the PDs it is expected that PDs will take on a\nlarger role in the primary and secondary markets. The liquidity support arrangements detailed\nin the policy will help PDs to make markets and minimise volatility in security prices.\nThe system of underwriting is being changed to facilitate larger absorption by PDs and\nkeeping in view RBI\u2019s ultimate objective of moving away from the primary market.\n\u2022 In the case of auctions for Treasury bills, each PD will be required to make a minimum\nbidding commitment for each auction, which would be indicated in the beginning of the\nyear as a percentage of the notified amount. The minimum bidding commitment of all\nPDs taken together is expected to absorb 100 per cent of the issue. In the case of dated\nsecurities, the present system will be retained except that against 50 per cent currently\nbeing offered for underwriting, it is proposed to allow PDs to underwrite 100 per cent of\nthe notified amounts.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/7029.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 19, 1999", "info": "1Income recognition, asset classification, Provisioning and other\nrelated matters -  Valuation of investments\n(BP.BC.  28  /21.04.048/98-99)\nBP.BC.  28  /21.04.048/98-99\nApril  15,  1999\nAll Commercial Banks\n(excluding Regional Rural Banks)\nDear Sir,\nIncome recognition, asset classification,\nProvisioning and other related matters -\nValuation of investments\n-----------------------------------------------------\nPlease refer to our circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.29/21.04.048/98 dated 11 April, 1998\nprescribing the method to be adopted by banks and auditors for valuation of Government and\nother securities while finalising the Balance Sheet as on 31 March, 1998.

March 31, 1999.\nTo,\nAll the Non-Banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs)\nincluding Residuary Non-Banking Companies ( RNBCs)\nSubmission of Statutory Return on Liquid Assets\nPlease refer to our circular DNBS(PD)No.CC.8/02.01/98-99 dated January 21, 1999 in terms of\nwhich all the NBFCs irrespective of the size of their net owned fund and whether they accepted\npublic deposits or not were advised to submit the return in the Form of Quarterly Return I (to be\nsubmitted by RNBCs) or Form of Quarterly Return II (to be submitted by equipment leasing or\nhire purchase finance or loan and investment company) and Format of Special Return.\n2.While majority of the NBFCs have submitted the above returns, it is observed that many\nof the NBFCs not having public deposits have chosen to avoid filing of the return despite the\nDirections from the RBI to file \u2018Nil\u2019 return in such cases. Some of the companies have requested\nthe Bank to allow them to withdraw their application for Certificate of Registration at this stage\nwhile many others have failed in submitting the statutory return. The emerging scenario of\ncompliance with the statutory and regulatory framework by the NBFCs does not inspire\nconfidence that all the companies are amenable to the requirements of Reserve Bank for\nexercising supervision over them. The Reserve Bank has taken a serious view of the matter.  It\nhas, therefore, been decided to issue show cause notices to all such NBFCs which have not\nsubmitted these returns and for other reasons of non-compliance of the various provisions of RBI\nDirections / Act as applicable to them. Further, appropriate supervisory action, as provided for in\nthe RBI Act, will be taken against the companies which have failed to comply with these\nrequirements.\n3.As you are aware, Reserve Bank of India has shifted the focus of regulation to the\nNBFCs accepting / holding public deposits.  The deposit taking activities are governed by the\nprovisions of Non-Banking Financial Companies Acceptance of Public Deposits (Reserve Bank)\nDirections, 1998 in terms of which the ceiling on quantum of public deposits, the requirement of\nminimum investment grade credit rating and/or higher capital adequacy ratio etc. have been\nprescribed.  The NBFCs having Net Owned Fund (NOF) below Rs.25 lakh are expressly\nprohibited from accepting any further public deposits or renewing such maturing deposits.  The\nNBFCs are required to maintain liquid assets with correlation to the quantum of public deposits\nheld by them as at the last working day of the second preceding quarter on each day of the\ncurrent quarter. Although it had earlier been clarified that the companies not holding public\ndeposits need not submit such Return, it is considered necessary by the Reserve Bank of India2\nthat, with a view to ascertaining the fact whether any company is holding public deposits or not,\neach company should submit the Return on liquid assets.  It may be clarified that all NBFCs\nirrespective of the size of their NOF (including those whose applications for Certificate of\nRegistration have been rejected) are required to furnish this Quarterly Return in the prescribed\nForms.\n4.Accordingly, you are directed to continue to submit the statutory return on liquid assets\n(copy of Forms enclosed) for every quarter, in future, strictly in accordance with the provisions\nof Section 45-IB of the RBI Act read with Notification Nos.108, 120 and 121, as applicable to\nyour company. The companies not holding public deposits should invariably submit \u2018nil\u2019\ninformation in respect of deposits but they must fill up the information about the net owned fund\nas per last audited balance sheet against item No.10(i) of the Form of Quarterly Return II.

Release of foreign currency travellers cheques and notes to  Master/Captain of the ship\nagainst inward remittance - Delegation  of powers to authorised dealers\nAt present, permission of Reserve Ba nk is necessary to provide foreign currency\nnotes/travellers cheques to the Master/Captain of foreign ship for making payment to the\nmembers of the crew on board against the remittance received in the name of the\nMaster/Captain.  It has now been decided to delegate these powers to authorised dealers.\nAccordingly, the authorised dealer through whom  the remittance has been received may, on\nproper identification with reference to the passport of the Master/Captain, provide foreign\ncurrency travellers cheques in the name of the Master/Captain of the ship and/or foreign\ncurrency notes for meeting the local expenses and/or making payment to members of the crew\non board.

Remittance of magazine subscription by recognised agents\nIn terms of item 3 of A.D.(M.A. Series) Circular No.48 dated 14th Decembe r 1998,\nauthorised dealers were permitted to allow remittance of subscription to foreign magazines by\nIndian agents subject to, inter alia, condition that a certificate from Chartered Accountant as to\nhow the remittable amount has been arrived at net of commission, handling charges, etc.  should\nbe submitted.  On a review, it has been decided to dispense with the requirement of submission\nof Chartered Accountant\u2019s Certificate. Authorised dealers should, however, ensure with\nreference to invoices/price lists, agreements, etc., between the publisher and Indian agent that\nthe amount of remittance applied for represents the net amount of subscription after deduction\nof agent\u2019s commission, handling charges, etc.  All other conditions mentioned in item 3 of the\nCircular referred to above remain unchanged.\n3.

Accordingly, forms A4\nrequired to be submitted alongwith the concerned STAT1 statements need not henceforth be\nforwarded to Reserve Bank.  However, the duly completed forms A4 should be retained with the\nauthorised dealers for scrutiny at the time of audit/inspection.\n4. Simplification of forms\nWith a view to simplifying the procedure, it has been decided to revise application forms\nfor (a) remittances towards maintenance of close relatives abroad (REM), (b) release of\nexchange for medical treatment abroad (TRM1) and (c) release of exchange for medical\ntreatment abroad for those who had already proceeded abroad for business, etc. visits, (TRM2).\nFurther, henceforth, it will not be necessary for authorised dealers to obtain application in form\nREM while allowing remittance towards gift to close relative/friend residing abroad, in terms of\nitem IIA of Part B of Annexure I to Chapter 8 of ECM.  Such remittances may be allowed on the\nbasis of a declaration in the specified format.\n5.

(cf. IECD Circulars\nNos.EFD.14 dated October 6, 1993 and EFD.21 dated November 8, 1993). Thus Export Finance\nin foreign currency is available to cover both domestic as well as imported inputs for the goods to\nbe exported.\n2. As indicated in our Circulars referred to above, for the purpose of the Schemes, banks have\nbeen permitted to utilise foreign currency funds in Foreign Currency Non-Resident (Banks)\n[FCNR (B)] Accounts Scheme, Exchange Earners Foreign Currency (EEFC) Accounts, Resident\nForeign Currency (RFC) Accounts and Escrow Accounts. Banks have also been allowed to\narrange lines of credit from banks abroad or from banks in India for funding such operations.\n3. The Schemes envisage export credit being made available at internationally competitive rates\nin all currencies. Normally, Export Credit in foreign currency is extended in US Dollar, Pound\nSterling, Deutsche Mark and Japanese Yen. Now, with the launching of Euro, on January 1,1999,\nthe facilities can be made available in Euro also.\n4. As per extant instructions, banks are free to extend PCFC in one convertible currency in\nrespect of an export order invoiced in another convertible currency. Thus, an exporter can avail of\nPCFC in US Dollar against an export order invoiced in Euro. While fixing the minimum lot in\nsanctioning PCFC, banks have been advised to take into account the needs of small exporters\nlooking to the operational convenience. Banks are required to charge a spread of not more than\n1.5 per cent over LIBOR. From January 1, 1999, on fresh transactions, banks have been permitted\nalso to use Euro Libor/Euribor, wherever applicable, as the benchmark for the purpose. \u2018Running\nAccount\u2019 facility can be extended under PCFC in respect of all commodities to exporters with\ngood track record.\n5. In order to make the Schemes more popular and accessible to as many exporters as\npossible, the following Guidelines are issued. These should be brought into effect\nimmediately .\n[A] Simplification of Procedures\n(i) Banks should simplify the Application Form and reduce data requirements from exporters for\nassessment of their credit needs, so that exporters do not have to seek outside professional help to\nfill in the Application Form or to furnish data required by the bank.(ii) Banks should adopt any of the methods, viz. Projected Balance Sheet method, Turnover\nmethod or Cash Budget method, for assessment of working capital requirements of their\nexporter-customers, whichever is most suitable and appropriate to their business operations.\n(iii) In the case of Consortium Finance, once the consortium has approved the assessment,\nmember banks should simultaneously initiate their respective sanction processes.\n[B] \u2018On Line\u2019 Credit to Exporters\n(i) Banks provide \u2018Line of Credit\u2019 normally for one year which is reviewed annually. In case of\ndelay in renewal, the sanctioned limits should be allowed to continue uninterrupted and urgent\nrequirements of exporters should be met on ad hoc basis.\n(i) In case of established exporters having satisfactory track record, banks should consider\nsanctioning a \u2018Line of Credit\u2019 for a longer period, say, 3 years, with in-built flexibility to step-\nup/step-down the quantum of limits within the overall outer limits assessed. The step-up limits\nwill become operative on attainment of pre-determined performance parameters by the exporters.\nBanks should obtain security documents covering the outer limit sanctioned to the exporters for\nsuch longer period.\n(iii) In case of export of seasonal commodities, agro-based products etc., banks should sanction\nPeak/Non-peak credit facilities to exporters.\n(iv) Banks should permit interchangeability of pre-shipment and post-shipment credit limits.\n(v) Term Loan requirements for expansion of capacity , modernisation of machinery and\nupgradation of technology should also be met by banks.\n(vi) Assessment of export credit limits should be \u2018need based\u2019 and not directly linked to the\navailability of collateral security. As long as the requirement of credit limit is justified on the\nbasis of the exporter\u2019s performance and track record, the credit should not be denied merely on\nthe grounds of non-availability of collateral security.\n[C] Waiver of Submission of Orders or L/Cs\nfor Availing Pre-shipment credit\nBanks should not insist on submission of export order or L/C for every disbursement of pre-\nshipment credit, from exporters with consistently good track-record. Instead, a system of\nperiodical submission of a Statement of LCs or Export Orders in hand, should be introduced.\n[D] Handling of Export Documents\nPresently, banks are required to obtain, among others, original sale contract/confirmed\norder/proforma invoice countersigned by overseas buyer/indent from authorised agent of\noverseas buyer for handling the export documents as per Exchange Control regulations. In future,\nsubmission of such documents need not be insisted upon at the time of handling the export\ndocuments, since the goods have already been valued and cleared by the Customs authorities,except in the case of transactions with Letters of Credit (LC) where the terms of LC require\nsubmission of the sale contract/ other alternative documents.\n[E] Fast Track Clearance of Export Credit\n(i) At specialised branches and branches having sizeable export business, a facilitation\nmechanism for assisting exporter-customers should be put in place for quick initial scrutiny of\nCredit Application and for discussions for seeking additional information or clarifications.\n(ii) Banks should streamline their internal systems and procedures to comply with the stipulated\ntime limits for disposal of export credit proposals and also endeavour to dispose of export credit\nproposals ahead of the prescribed time schedule. A flow chart indicating chronological\nmovement of Credit Application from the date of receipt till the date of sanction, should also\naccompany credit proposals.\n(iii) Banks should delegate higher sanctioning powers to their branches for export credit.\n(iv) Banks should consider reducing at least some of the intervening layers in the sanctioning\nprocess. It would be desirable to ensure that the total number of layers involved in decision-\nmaking in regard to export finance does not exceed three.\n(v) Banks should introduce a system of \u2018Joint Appraisal\u2019 by officials at branches and\nadministrative offices, to facilitate quicker processing of Export Credit proposals.\n(vi) Where feasible, banks should set up a \u2018Credit Committee\u2019 at specialised branches and at\nadministrative offices, for sanctioning working capital facilities to exporters. The \u2018Credit\nCommittee\u2019 should have sufficiently higher sanctioning powers.\n[F] Publicity and Training\nPresently, export credit at internationally competitive rates is made available in foreign currency\nat select branches of banks. In order to make the Scheme more popular, wide publicity should be\ngiven by banks and more number of branches should be designated for making available export\ncredit in foreign currency. Officers at operating level should be provided with adequate training.\n[G] Customer Education\n(i) Banks should bring out a Hand Book containing salient features of the simplified procedures\nfor sanction of Export Credit in Foreign Currency at internationally competitive rates for the\nbenefit of their exporter-clients.\n(ii) To facilitate interaction between banks and exporters, banks should periodically organise\nExporters\u2019 Meet at centres with concentration of exporters.\n[H] Monitoring of Implementation\nof GuidelinesBanks should set up an internal team to visit branches periodically, say, once in two months to\ngauge the extent of implementation of the Guidelines.\n6. Please acknowledge receipt of this Circular, and advise us, within a fortnight, the\narrangements made by you to implement the said Guidelines. As you are aware, the\nGovernment of India and the RBI attach utmost importance to exports, and it is essential to\nensure that exporters\u2019 credit requirements are met in full and promptly, and also at most\ncompetitive rates. In this connection a reference is also invited to the\nInstructions/Guidelines issued by the RBI earlier, a gist of which is furnished in the\nAnnexure.\n7.

It has been decided to \nextend certain facilities to account holders who are sick/old/incapacitated and who are not willing \nto open and operate joint accounts (by which the problem could be solved).  \n2. The cases of sick/old/incapacitated account holders fall into the following categories:  \na) An account holder who is too ill to sign a cheque/cannot be physically present in the \nbank to withdraw money from his bank acco unt but can put his/her thumb impression on \nthe cheque/withdrawal form and  \nb) An account holder who is not only unable to  be physically present in the bank but is \nalso not even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/withdrawal form due to \ncertain physical defect/ incapacity.  \n3. With a view to enabling the old/sick/incapa citated account holders to operate their bank \naccounts, banks may follow the procedure as under:-  \na) Wherever thumb or toe impression of the sick/old/incapacitated account holder is \nobtained, it should be identified by two indep endent witnesses known to the bank, one of \nwhom should be a responsible bank official  \nb) Where the customer cannot even put his/her thumb impression and also would not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained on the \ncheque/withdrawal form which should be i dentified by two independent witnesses, one of \nwho should be a responsible bank official.\n \n4. The customer may asked to indicate to the ba nk as to who would withdraw the amount from the \nbank on the basis of cheque/withdrawal form as obtained above and that person should be \nidentified by two independent witnesses. The pe rson who would be actually drawing the money \nfrom the bank should be asked to furnish his signature to the bank.  \n5. In this context, the opinion obtained by the Indi an Bank's Association from their consultant on \nthe question of opening of a bank account of a person who had lost both his hands and could not \nsign the cheque/withdrawal form is given in the Annexure.  \n6.

BC. 94/ 21. 04. 098/ 98 dated September 10, 1998\nforwarding therewith draft Guidelines for putting in place Asset-Liability Management (ALM)\nSystem in banks. The draft Guidelines have been reviewed by us in the light of the issues\nraised/suggestions made by banks in the seminars held at Bankers Training College and also at\nthe Review Meeting of the Chairmen/Chief Executive Officers of banks. The final Guidelines\nrevised on the basis of the feedback received from banks are enclosed, for implementation by\nbanks, effective April 1, 1999.  In this connection, we have to advise as under:\n2. Banks should give adequate attention to putting in place an effective ALM System. Banks\nshould set up an internal Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO), headed by the CEO/CMD or the\nED. The Management Committee or any specific Committee of the Board should oversee the\nimplementation of the system and review its functioning periodically.\n3. Keeping in view the level of computerisation and the current MIS in banks, adoption of a\nuniform ALM System for all banks may not be feasible. The final  guidelines have been\nformulated to serve as a benchmark for those banks which lack a formal ALM System. Banks\nwhich have already adopted more sophisticated systems may continue their existing systems but\nthey should ensure to fine-tune their current information and reporting system so as to be in line\nwith the ALM System suggested in the Guidelines. Other banks should examine their existing\nMIS and arrange to have an information system to meet the prescriptions of the new ALM\nSystem. To begin with, banks should ensure coverage of at least 60%  of their liabilities and\nassets. As for the remaining 40% of their assets and liabilities, banks may include the position\nbased on their estimates. It is necessary that banks set targets in the interim, for covering 100 per\ncent of their business by April 1, 2000 . The MIS would need to ensure that such minimum\ninformation/data consistent in quality and coverage is captured and once the ALM System\nstabilises  and banks gain experience, they must be in a position to switch over to more\nsophisticated techniques like Duration Gap Analysis, Simulation and Value at Risk for interest\nrate risk management.\n \n 4. In order to capture the maturity structure of the cash inflows and outflows, the Statement of\nStructural Liquidity ( Annexure -I) should be prepared, to start with, as on the last reporting\nFriday of March/June/ September/December and put up to ALCO/Top Management within a\nmonth from the close of the last reporting Friday. It is the intention to make the reporting system\non a fortnightly basis by April 1, 2000. The Statement of Structural Liquidity should be placed\nbefore the bank\u2019s Board in the next meeting. It would also be necessary to take into account the\nrupee inflows and outflows on account of previously contracted forex transactions (swaps,\nforwards, etc). Tolerance levels for various maturities  may be fixed by the bank\u2019s Top2\nManagement depending on the bank\u2019s asset - liability profile, extent of stable deposit base, the\nnature of cash flows, etc. In respect of mismatches in cash flows for the 1-14 days bucket and 15-\n28 days bucket, it should be the endeavour of the bank\u2019s management to keep the cash flow\nmismatches at the minimum levels. To start with, the mismatches ( negative gap ) during 1-14\ndays and 15-28 days in normal course may not exceed 20% each of the cash outflows during\nthese time buckets. If a bank in view of its structural mismatches needs higher limit, it could\noperate with higher limit with the approval of its Board/Management Committee, giving specific\nreasons on the need for such higher limit. The objective of RBI is to enforce the tolerance\nlevels strictly by April 1, 2000.\n \n 5. In order to enable the banks to monitor their liquidity on a dynamic basis over a time horizon\nspanning from 1-90 days, an indicative format ( Annexure III) is enclosed. The statement of\nShort-term Dynamic Liquidity should be prepared as on each reporting Friday and put up to the\nALCO/Top Management within 2/3 days from the close of the reporting Friday.\n6. We advise that in the Statement of Interest Rate Sensitivity ( Annexure - II) only rupee assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet positions should be reported. The statement should be prepared\nas on the last reporting Friday of March/June/September/December and submitted to the ALCO /\nTop Management within a month from the last reporting Friday. It should also be placed before\nthe bank\u2019s Board in the next meeting. The banks are expected to move over to monthly reporting\nsystem by April 1, 2000 . The information collected in the statement would provide useful\nfeedback on the interest rate risk faced by the bank and the Top Management/Board would have\nto formulate corrective measures and devise suitable strategies wherever needed.\n7.  The guidelines for ALM cover the banks\u2019 operations in domestic currency . In regard to\nforeign currency risk, banks should follow the instructions contained in Circular AD (MA Series)\nNo.52 dated December 27, 1997 issued  by the Exchange Control Department.\n8. As regards furnishing of data to RBI, a separate communication will follow from the\nDepartment of Banking Supervision.\n9. This circular may please be placed before the Board of Directors at its next meeting\n10. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(A . Ghosh)\nChief General Manager\nEncl: As above\nAsset - Liability Management (ALM) System in banks - Guidelines\nIn the normal course, banks are exposed to credit and market risks in view of the asset-liability\ntransformation. With liberalisation in Indian financial markets over the last few years and\ngrowing integration of domestic markets and with external markets, the risks associated with3\nbanks\u2019 operations have become complex and large, requiring strategic management. Banks are\nnow operating in a fairly deregulated environment and are required to determine on their own,\ninterest rates on deposits and advance in both domestic and foreign currencies on a dynamic\nbasis. The interest rates on banks\u2019 investments in government and other securities are also now\nmarket related.  Intense competition for business involving both the assets and liabilities,\ntogether with increasing volatility in the domestic interest rates as well as foreign exchange rates,\nhas brought pressure on the management of banks to maintain a good balance among spreads,\nprofitability and long-term viability. Imprudent liquidity management can put banks\u2019 earnings\nand reputation at great risk. These pressures call for structured and comprehensive measures and\nnot just ad hoc action. The Management of banks has to base their business decisions on a\ndynamic and integrated risk management system and process, driven by corporate strategy.\nBanks are exposed to several major risks in the course of their business - credit risk, interest rate\nrisk, foreign exchange risk, equity / commodity price risk , liquidity risk and operational risk. It\nis, therefore, important that banks introduce effective risk management systems that address the\nissues related to interest rate, currency and liquidity risks.\nBanks need to address these risks in a structured manner by upgrading their risk\nmanagement and adopting more comprehensive Asset-Liability Management (ALM) practices\nthan has been done hitherto. ALM, among other functions, is also concerned with risk\nmanagement and provides a comprehensive and dynamic framework for measuring, monitoring\nand managing liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity and commodity price risks of a\nbank that needs to be closely integrated with the banks\u2019 business strategy. It involves assessment\nof various types of risks and altering the asset-liability portfolio in a dynamic way in order to\nmanage risks.\n2. This note lays down broad guidelines in respect of interest rate and liquidity risks management\nsystems in banks which form part of the Asset-Liability Management (ALM) function. The\ninitial focus of the ALM function would be to enforce the risk management discipline viz.\nmanaging business after assessing the risks involved. The objective of good risk management\nsystems should be that these systems will evolve into a strategic tool for bank management.\n3.  The ALM process rests on three pillars:\n\u2022 ALM Information Systems\n\u21d2 Management Information Systems\n\u21d2 Information availability, accuracy, adequacy and expediency\n\u2022 ALM Organisation\n\u21d2 Structure and responsibilities\n\u21d2 Level of top management involvement\n\u2022 ALM Process\n\u21d2 Risk parameters\n\u21d2 Risk identification\n\u21d2 Risk measurement\n\u21d2 Risk management\n\u21d2 Risk policies and tolerance levels.\n4.  ALM Information Systems\n \n ALM has to be supported by a management philosophy which clearly specifies the risk policies\nand tolerance limits. This framework needs to be built on sound methodology with necessary4\ninformation system as back up. Thus, information is the key to the ALM process. It is, however,\nrecognised that varied business profiles of banks in the public and private sector as well as those\nof foreign banks do not make the adoption of a uniform ALM System  for all banks feasible.\nThere are various methods prevalent world-wide for measuring risks. These range from the\nsimple Gap Statement to extremely sophisticated and data intensive Risk Adjusted Profitability\nMeasurement methods. However, the central element for the entire ALM exercise is the\navailability of adequate and accurate information with expedience and the existing systems in\nmany Indian banks do not generate information in the manner required for ALM. Collecting\naccurate data in a timely manner will be the biggest challenge before the banks, particularly\nthose having wide network of branches but lacking full scale computerisation. However, the\nintroduction of base information system for risk measurement and monitoring has to be\naddressed urgently. As banks are aware, internationally, regulators have prescribed or are in the\nprocess of prescribing capital adequacy for market risks. A pre-requisite for this is that banks\nmust have in place an efficient information system.\n \n Considering the large network of branches and the lack of (an adequate) support system to\ncollect information required for ALM which analyses information on the basis of residual\nmaturity and behavioural pattern, it will take time for banks in the present state to get the\nrequisite information. The problem of ALM needs to be addressed by following an ABC\napproach i.e. analysing the behaviour of asset and liability products in the sample branches\naccounting for significant business and then making rational assumptions about the way in which\nassets and liabilities would behave in other branches. In respect of foreign exchange, investment\nportfolio and money market operations, in view of the centralised nature of the functions, it\nwould be much easier to collect reliable information. The data and assumptions can then be\nrefined over time as the bank management gain experience of conducting business within an\nALM framework. The spread of computerisation will also help banks in accessing data.\n5.   ALM Organisation\n5.1 a) Successful implementation of the risk management process would require strong\ncommitment on the part of the senior management in the bank, to integrate basic operations and\nstrategic decision making with risk management. The Board should have overall responsibility\nfor management of risks and should decide the risk management policy of the bank and set limits\nfor liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity price risks.\nb) The Asset - Liability Committee (ALCO) consisting of the bank's senior management\nincluding CEO should be responsible for ensuring adherence to the limits set by the Board as\nwell as for deciding the business strategy of the bank (on the assets and liabilities sides) in line\nwith the bank\u2019s budget and decided risk management objectives.\nc) The ALM Support Groups consisting of operating staff should be responsible for analysing,\nmonitoring and reporting the risk profiles to the ALCO. The staff should also prepare forecasts\n(simulations) showing the effects of various possible changes in market conditions related to the\nbalance sheet and recommend the action needed to adhere to bank\u2019s internal limits.\n5.2The ALCO is a decision making unit responsible for balance sheet planning from risk -\nreturn perspective including the strategic management of interest rate and liquidity risks. Each\nbank will have to decide on the role of its ALCO, its responsibility as also the decisions to be\ntaken by it. The business and risk management strategy of the bank should ensure that the bank5\noperates within the limits / parameters set by the Board. The business issues that an ALCO\nwould consider, inter alia, will include product pricing for both deposits and advances, desired\nmaturity profile and mix of the incremental assets and liabilities, etc. In addition to monitoring\nthe risk levels of the bank, the ALCO should review the results of and progress in\nimplementation of the decisions made in the previous meetings. The ALCO would also articulate\nthe current interest rate view of the bank and base its decisions for future business strategy on\nthis view. In respect of the funding policy, for instance, its responsibility would be to decide on\nsource and mix of liabilities or sale of assets. Towards this end, it will have to develop a view on\nfuture direction of interest rate movements and decide on funding mixes between fixed vs\nfloating rate funds, wholesale vs retail deposits, money market vs capital market funding ,\ndomestic vs foreign currency funding, etc. Individual banks will have to decide the frequency for\nholding their ALCO meetings.\n5.3 Composition of ALCO\nThe size (number of members) of ALCO  would depend on the size of each institution,\nbusiness mix and organisational complexity. To ensure commitment of the Top Management and\ntimely response to market dynamics, the CEO/CMD or the ED should head the Committee. The\nChiefs of Investment, Credit, Resources Management or Planning, Funds Management /\nTreasury ( forex and domestic), International Banking and Economic Research can be members\nof the Committee. In addition, the Head of the Technology Division should also be an invitee for\nbuilding up of MIS and related computerisation. Some banks may even have Sub-committees\nand Support Groups.\n5.4 Committee of Directors\nThe Management Committee of the Board or any other Specific Committee constituted by the\nBoard should oversee the implementation of the system and review its functioning periodically.\n5.5 ALM Process:\n \n The scope of ALM function can be described as follows:\n\u2022 Liquidity  risk management\n\u2022 Management of market risks\n\u2022 Trading risk management\n\u2022 Funding and capital planning\n\u2022 Profit  planning and growth projection\n \n The guidelines given in this note mainly address Liquidity and Interest Rate risks.\n6. Liquidity Risk Management\n6.1Measuring and managing liquidity needs are vital for effective operation of commercial\nbanks. By assuring a bank\u2019s ability to meet its liabilities as they become due, liquidity\nmanagement can reduce the probability of an adverse situation developing. The importance of\nliquidity transcends individual institutions, as liquidity shortfall in one institution can have\nrepercussions on the entire system.  Banks management should measure not only the liquidity\npositions of banks on an ongoing basis but also examine how liquidity requirements are likely to\nevolve under different assumptions. Experience shows that assets commonly considered as liquid6\nlike Government securities and other money market instruments could also become illiquid when\nthe market and players are unidirectional. Therefore liquidity has to be tracked through maturity\nor cash flow mismatches. For measuring and managing net funding requirements, the use of a\nmaturity ladder and calculation of cumulative surplus or deficit of funds at selected maturity\ndates is adopted as a  standard tool. The format of the Statement of Structural Liquidity is given\nin Annexure I.\n6.2  The Maturity Profile as given in Appendix I could be used for measuring the future cash\nflows of banks in different time buckets. The time buckets, given the Statutory Reserve cycle of\n14 days may be distributed as under:\ni)  1 to 14 days\nii)  15 to 28 days\niii)  29 days and upto 3 months\niv)  Over 3 months and upto 6 months\nv)  Over 6 months and upto 1 year\nvi)  Over 1 year and upto 3 years\nvii)  Over 3 years and upto 5 years\nviii)  Over 5 years\n6.3 The investments in SLR securities and other investments are assumed as illiquid due to lack\nof depth in the secondary market and are therefore required to be shown under respective\nmaturity buckets, corresponding to the residual maturity. However, some of the banks may be\nmaintaining securities in the \u2018Trading Book\u2019, which are kept distinct from other investments\nmade for complying with the Statutory Reserve requirements and for retaining relationship with\ncustomers. Securities held in the \u2018Trading Book\u2019 are subject to certain preconditions like :\ni) The composition and volume are clearly defined;\nii) Maximum maturity/duration of the portfolio is restricted;\niii) The holding period not to exceed 90 days;\niv) Cut-loss limit prescribed;\nv) Defeasance periods (product-wise) i.e. time taken to liquidate the position on the basis\nof liquidity in the secondary market are prescribed;\nvi) Marking to market on a daily/weekly basis and the revaluation gain/loss charged to the\nprofit and loss account ; etc.\nBanks which maintain such \u2018Trading Books\u2019 and complying with the above standards are\npermitted to show the trading securities under 1-14 days, 15-28 days and 29-90 days buckets on\nthe basis of the defeasance periods. The Board/ALCO of the banks should approve the volume,\ncomposition, holding/ defeasance period, cut loss, etc. of the \u2018Trading Book\u2019 and copy of the\npolicy note thereon should be forwarded to the Department of Banking Supervision, RBI.\n6.4 Within each time bucket there could be mismatches depending on cash inflows and outflows.\nWhile the mismatches upto one year would be relevant since these provide early warning signals\nof impending liquidity problems, the main focus should be on the short-term mismatches viz., 1-\n14 days and 15-28 days. Banks, however, are expected to monitor their cumulative mismatches\n(running total) across all time buckets by establishing internal prudential limits with the approval\nof the Board / Management Committee. The mismatches ( negative gap ) during 1-14 days and\n15-28 days in normal course may not exceed 20% of the cash outflows  in each time bucket.  If a7\nbank in view of its current asset -liability profile and the consequential structural mismatches\nneeds higher tolerance level, it could operate with higher limit sanctioned by its Board /\nManagement Committee giving specific reasons on the need for such higher limit. The discretion\nto allow a higher tolerance level is intended for a temporary period, i.e. till March 31, 2000.\n6.5 The Statement of Structural Liquidity ( Annexure I ) may be prepared by placing all cash\ninflows and outflows in the maturity ladder according to the expected timing of cash flows. A\nmaturing liability will be a cash outflow while a maturing asset will be a cash inflow. It would\nalso be necessary to take into account the rupee inflows and outflows on account of forex\noperations. While determining the likely cash inflows / outflows, banks have to make a number\nof assumptions according to their asset - liability profiles. For instance, Indian banks with large\nbranch network can (on the stability of their deposit base as most deposits are rolled-over) afford\nto have larger tolerance levels in mismatches in the long-term if their term deposit base is quite\nhigh. While determining the tolerance levels the banks may take into account all relevant factors\nbased on their asset-liability base, nature of business, future strategy, etc. The RBI is interested\nin ensuring that the tolerance levels are determined keeping all necessary factors in view and\nfurther   refined with experience gained in Liquidity Management.\n6.6 In order to enable the banks to monitor their short-term liquidity on a dynamic basis over a\ntime horizon spanning from 1-90 days, banks may estimate their short-term liquidity profiles on\nthe basis of business projections and other commitments for planning purposes. An indicative\nformat ( Annexure III ) for estimating Short-term Dynamic Liquidity is enclosed.\n7. Currency Risk\n7.1 Floating exchange rate arrangement has brought in its wake pronounced volatility adding a\nnew dimension to the risk profile of banks\u2019 balance sheets.  The increased capital flows across\nfree economies following deregulation have contributed to increase in the volume of\ntransactions. Large cross border flows together with the volatility has rendered the banks\u2019\nbalance sheets vulnerable to exchange rate movements.\n7.2 Dealing in different currencies brings opportunities as also risks. If the liabilities in one\ncurrency exceed the level of assets in the same currency, then the currency mismatch can add\nvalue or erode value depending upon the currency movements. The simplest way to avoid\ncurrency risk is to ensure that mismatches, if any, are reduced to zero or near zero. Banks\nundertake operations in foreign exchange like accepting deposits, making loans and advances\nand quoting prices for foreign exchange transactions. Irrespective of the strategies adopted, it\nmay not be possible to eliminate currency mismatches altogether. Besides, some of the\ninstitutions may take proprietary trading positions as a conscious business strategy.\n7.3 Managing Currency Risk is one more dimension of Asset- Liability Management.\nMismatched currency position besides exposing the balance sheet to movements in exchange rate\nalso exposes it to country risk and settlement risk. Ever since the RBI (Exchange Control\nDepartment) introduced the concept of end of the day near square position in 1978, banks have\nbeen setting up overnight limits and selectively undertaking active day time trading. Following\nthe introduction of \u201cGuidelines for Internal Control over Foreign Exchange Business\u201d in 1981,\nmaturity mismatches (gaps) are also subject to control. Following the recommendations of\nExpert Group on Foreign Exchange Markets in India ( Sodhani Committee) the calculation of\nexchange position has been redefined and banks have been given the discretion to set up8\novernight limits linked to maintenance of capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio of 8% of open\nposition limit.\n7.4 Presently, the banks are also free to set gap limits with RBI\u2019s approval but are required to\nadopt Value at Risk ( VaR) approach to measure the risk associated with forward exposures. Thus\nthe open position limits together with the gap limits form the risk management approach to forex\noperations. For monitoring such risks banks should follow the instructions contained in Circular\nA.D (M. A. Series) No.52 dated  December  27, 1997 issued by the Exchange Control\nDepartment.\n8.  Interest Rate Risk (IRR)\n8.1 The phased deregulation of interest rates and the operational flexibility given to banks in\npricing most of the assets and liabilities imply the need for the banking system to hedge the\nInterest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk where changes in market interest rates might\nadversely affect a bank\u2019s financial condition. The changes in interest rates affect banks in a\nlarger way. The immediate impact of changes in interest rates is on bank\u2019s earnings (i.e. reported\nprofits) by changing its Net Interest Income (NII). A long-term impact of changing interest rates\nis on bank\u2019s Market Value of Equity (MVE) or Net Worth as the economic value of bank\u2019s\nassets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions get affected due to variation in market interest\nrates. The interest rate risk when viewed from these two perspectives is known as \u2018earnings\nperspective\u2019 and \u2018economic value\u2019 perspective, respectively. The risk from the earnings\nperspective can be measured as changes in the Net Interest Income (NII) or Net Interest Margin\n(NIM). There are many analytical techniques for measurement and management of Interest Rate\nRisk. In the context of poor MIS, slow pace of computerisation in banks and the absence of total\nderegulation, the traditional Gap analysis is considered as a  suitable method  to  measure the\nInterest Rate Risk in the first place. It is the intention of RBI to move over to the modern\ntechniques of Interest Rate Risk measurement like Duration Gap Analysis, Simulation and Value\nat Risk over time when banks acquire sufficient expertise and sophistication in acquiring and\nhandling MIS.\nThe Gap or Mismatch risk can be measured by calculating Gaps over different time intervals as\nat a given date. Gap analysis measures mismatches between rate sensitive liabilities and rate\nsensitive assets (including off-balance sheet positions). An asset or liability is normally classified\nas rate sensitive if:\ni)  within the time interval under consideration, there is a cash flow;\nii)  the interest rate resets/ reprices contractually during the interval;\niii)  RBI changes the interest rates (i.e. interest rates on Savings Bank Deposits, DRI\nadvances, Export credit, Refinance, CRR balance, etc.) in cases where interest rates are\nadministered ; and\niv)  it is contractually pre-payable or withdrawal before the stated maturities.\n8.2 The Gap Report should be generated by grouping rate sensitive liabilities, assets and off-\nbalance sheet positions into time buckets according to residual maturity or next repricing period,\nwhichever is earlier. The difficult task in Gap analysis is determining rate sensitivity. All\ninvestments, advances, deposits, borrowings, purchased funds, etc. that mature/ reprice within a\nspecified timeframe are interest rate sensitive. Similarly, any principal repayment of loan is also\nrate sensitive if the bank expects to receive it within the time horizon. This includes final9\nprincipal payment and interim instalments. Certain assets and liabilities receive/pay rates that\nvary with a reference rate. These assets and liabilities are repriced at pre-determined intervals\nand are rate sensitive at the time of repricing.  While the interest rates on term deposits are fixed\nduring their currency, the advances portfolio of the banking system is basically floating. The\ninterest rates on advances could be repriced any number of occasions, corresponding to the\nchanges in PLR.\nThe Gaps may be identified in the following time buckets:\ni)  1-28 days\nii)  29 days and upto 3 months\niii)  Over 3 months and upto 6 months\niv)  Over 6 months and upto 1 year\nv)  Over 1 year and upto 3 years\nvi)  Over 3 years and upto 5 years\nvii)  Over 5 years\nviii)  Non-sensitive\nThe various items of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet items may be\nclassified as explained in Appendix - II and the  Reporting Format for interest rate sensitive\nassets and liabilities is given in Annexure II.\n8.3  The Gap is the difference between Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) and Rate Sensitive\nLiabilities (RSL) for each time bucket. The positive Gap indicates that it has more RSAs than\nRSLs whereas the negative Gap indicates that it has more RSLs. The Gap reports indicate\nwhether the institution is in a position to benefit from rising interest rates by having a positive\nGap (RSA > RSL) or whether it is in a position to benefit from declining interest rates by a\nnegative Gap (RSL > RSA). The Gap can, therefore, be used as a measure of interest rate\nsensitivity.\n8.4 Each bank should set  prudential limits on individual Gaps with the approval of the\nBoard/Management Committee. The prudential limits should have a bearing on the Total Assets\n, Earning Assets or Equity.   The banks may work out Earnings at Risk ( EaR) or Net Interest\nMargin (NIM) based on their views on interest rate movements and fix a prudent level with the\napproval of the Board/Management Committee.\n8.5  RBI  will also  introduce capital adequacy for market risks in due course.\n9. General\n9.1 The classification of various components of assets and liabilities into different time buckets\nfor preparation of Gap reports (Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity) as indicated in\nAppendices I & II is the benchmark . Banks which are better equipped to reasonably estimate\nthe behavioural pattern, embedded options, rolls-in and rolls-out, etc of various components of\nassets and liabilities on the basis of past data / empirical studies could classify them in the\nappropriate time buckets, subject to approval from the ALCO / Board. A copy of the note\napproved by the ALCO / Board may be sent to the Department of Banking Supervision.10\n9.2 The present framework does not capture the impact of embedded options, i.e. the customers\nexercising their options (premature closure of deposits and prepayment of loans and advances)\non the liquidity and interest rate risks profile of banks. The magnitude of embedded option risk at\ntimes of volatility in market interest rates is quite substantial. Banks should therefore evolve\nsuitable mechanism, supported by empirical studies and behavioural analysis to estimate the\nfuture behaviour of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items to changes in market variables\nand estimate the embedded options.\n9.3 A scientifically evolved internal transfer pricing model by assigning values on the basis of\ncurrent market rates to funds provided and funds used is an important component for effective\nimplementation of ALM System. The transfer price mechanism can enhance the management of\nmargin i.e. lending or credit spread, the funding or liability spread and mismatch spread. It also\nhelps centralising interest rate risk at one place which facilitate effective control and\nmanagement of interest rate risk. A well defined transfer pricing system also provide a rational\nframework for pricing of assets and liabilities.\nAPPENDIX \u2013 I\nMaturity  Profile \u2013 Liquidity\nHeads of Accounts Classification into time buckets\nA. Outflows\n1. Capital, Reserves and   Surplus Over 5 years bucket.\n2.  Demand Deposits (Current and Savings\nBank  Deposits)Savings Bank and Current Deposits may be\nclassified into volatile and core portions.  Savings\nBank (10%) and Current (15%) Deposits are\ngenerally withdrawable on demand.  This portion\nmay be treated as volatile.  While volatile portion\ncan be placed in the first time bucket i.e., 1-14\ndays, the core portion may be placed in over 1- 3\nyears bucket.\nThe above classification of Savings Bank and\nCurrent Deposits is only a benchmark. Banks\nwhich are better equipped to estimate the\nbehavioural pattern, roll-in and roll-out, embedded\noptions, etc. on the basis of past data/empirical\nstudies could classify them in the appropriate\nbuckets, i.e.  behavioural  maturity instead of\ncontractual  maturity, subject to the approval of\nthe Board/ALCO.\n3. Term  Deposits Respective maturity buckets. Banks which are\nbetter equipped to estimate the behavioural\npattern, roll-in and roll-out, embedded options, etc.11\non the basis of past data/empirical studies could\nclassify the retail deposits  in the appropriate\nbuckets on the basis of behavioural  maturity\nrather than residual maturity . However, the\nwholesale deposits  should be shown under\nrespective maturity buckets.12\n4.  Certificates of Deposit, Borrowings and\nBonds (including Sub- ordinated Debt)Respective maturity buckets. Where call/put options\nare built into the issue structure of any instrument/s,\nthe call/put date/s should be reckoned as the\nmaturity date/s and the amount should be shown in\nthe respective time buckets.\n5.

BC. 94/ 21. 04. 098/ 98 dated September 10, 1998 forwarding\ntherewith draft Guidelines for putting in place Asset-Liability Management (ALM) System in banks. The\ndraft Guidelines have been reviewed by us in the light of the issues raised/suggestions made by banks in\nthe seminars held at Bankers Training College and also at the Review Meeting of the Chairmen/Chief\nExecutive Officers of banks. The final Guidelines revised on the basis of the feedback received from\nbanks are enclosed, for implementation by banks, effective April 1, 1999.  In this connection, we have to\nadvise as under:\n2. Banks should give adequate attention to putting in place an effective ALM System. Banks should set\nup an internal Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO), headed by the CEO/CMD or the ED. The Management\nCommittee or any specific Committee of the Board should oversee the implementation of the system and\nreview its functioning periodically.\n3. Keeping in view the level of computerisation and the current MIS in banks, adoption of a uniform ALM\nSystem for all banks may not be feasible. The final guidelines have been formulated to serve as a\nbenchmark for those banks which lack a formal ALM System. Banks which have already adopted more\nsophisticated systems may continue their existing systems but they should ensure to fine-tune their\ncurrent information and reporting system so as to be in line with the ALM System suggested in the\nGuidelines. Other banks should examine their existing MIS and arrange to have an information system to\nmeet the prescriptions of the new ALM System. To begin with, banks should ensure coverage of at least\n60% of their liabilities and assets. As for the remaining 40% of their assets and liabilities, banks may\ninclude the position based on their estimates. It is necessary that banks set targets in the interim, for\ncovering 100 per cent of their business by April 1, 2000 . The MIS would need to ensure that such\nminimum information/data consistent in quality and coverage is captured and once the ALM System\nstabilises and banks gain experience, they must be in a position to switch over to more sophisticated\ntechniques like Duration Gap Analysis, Simulation and Value at Risk for interest rate risk management.4. In order to capture the maturity structure of the cash inflows and outflows, the Statement of Structural\nLiquidity (Annexure-I) should be prepared, to start with, as on the last reporting Friday of March/June/\nSeptember/December and put up to ALCO/Top Management within a month from the close of the last\nreporting Friday. It is the intention to make the reporting system on a fortnightly basis by April 1, 2000.\nThe Statement of Structural Liquidity should be placed before the bank\u2019s Board in the next meeting. It\nwould also be necessary to take into account the rupee inflows and outflows on account of previously\ncontracted forex transactions (swaps, forwards, etc). Tolerance levels for various maturities may be fixed\nby the bank\u2019s Top Management depending on the bank\u2019s asset - liability profile, extent of stable deposit\nbase, the nature of cash flows, etc. In respect of mismatches in cash flows for the 1-14 days bucket and\n15-28 days bucket, it should be the endeavour of the bank\u2019s management to keep the cash flow\nmismatches at the minimum levels. To start with, the mismatches ( negative gap ) during 1-14 days and\n15-28 days in normal course may not exceed 20% each of the cash outflows during these time buckets. If\na bank in view of its structural mismatches needs higher limit, it could operate with higher limit with the\napproval of its Board/Management Committee, giving specific reasons on the need for such higher limit.\nThe objective of RBI is to enforce the tolerance levels strictly by April 1, 2000.\n5. In order to enable the banks to monitor their liquidity on a dynamic basis over a time horizon spanning\nfrom 1-90 days, an indicative format (Annexure III) is enclosed. The statement of Short-term Dynamic\nLiquidity should be prepared as on each reporting Friday and put up to the ALCO/Top Management within\n2/3 days from the close of the reporting Friday.\n6. We advise that in the Statement of Interest Rate Sensitivity (Annexure - II) only rupee assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet positions should be reported. The statement should be prepared as on the last\nreporting Friday of March/June/September/December and submitted to the ALCO / Top Management\nwithin a month from the last reporting Friday. It should also be placed before the bank\u2019s Board in the next\nmeeting. The banks are expected to move over to monthly reporting system by April 1, 2000 . The\ninformation collected in the statement would provide useful feedback on the interest rate risk faced by the\nbank and the Top Management/Board would have to formulate corrective measures and devise suitable\nstrategies wherever needed.\n7. The guidelines for ALM cover the banks\u2019 operations in domestic currency . In regard to foreign\ncurrency risk, banks should follow the instructions contained in Circular AD (MA Series) No.52 dated\nDecember 27, 1997 issued by the Exchange Control Department.\n8. As regards furnishing of data to RBI, a separate communication will follow from the Department of\nBanking Supervision.\n9.

This\nperiod can be further extended by three more years at the discretion of the Reserve Bank\nof India and during the interregnum, they can carry on their business till a decision is\ntaken  on  the  application  for registration. These companies\nare, however, required to comply with all the provisions of the RBI Act, as applicable to\nthem and the directions issued thereunder.2. You are aware that the Reserve Bank of India have shifted the focus of regulation\nto  the  NBFCs  accepting / holding  public  deposits. They  are required to maintain\nliquid assets at a specified percentage of such deposits outstanding at the end of second\npreceding quarter and they have to furnish a Statutory Return in the prescribed format on\nquarterly basis to the Reserve Bank of India. It has come to our notice that some of the\nNBFCs holding public deposits have not furnished the Return to the RBI in fulfilment of\ntheir statutory obligation.\n3. It has been decided to give last opportunity to the companies holding public\ndeposits to submit this Return for determining the eligibility for the Certificate of\nRegistration and compliance with the regulatory framework by  all the NBFCs\nirrespective of whether they have been issued the certificate of registration or their\napplications have been kept in abeyance.  Further, some additional information is also\nrequired for considering the extent of regulatory attention to be bestowed on the\ncompanies holding deposits. Although Reserve Bank had earlier clarified that the\ncompanies not holding public deposits need not submit the Return on Liquid Assets, the\nmatter has been reviewed in view of large scale non-compliance by the NBFCs, it has\nbeen decided that all the NBFCs should submit the statutory return on liquid assets.  In\ncase any company does not hold public deposits on the relevant second preceding quarter,\nit should submit `Nil\u2019 return.\n4.    You are, therefore,  advised to submit the following returns :\ni) Form of Quarterly Return I (to be submitted by RNBCs) or Form of Quarterly\nReturn II (to be submitted by equipment leasing or hire purchase leasing or\nloan and investment company); and\nii) Format of  Special Return.\nThe formats of  these Returns are enclosed. You should use the relevant formats of the\nreturns and submit the same to the Regional Office of the RBI under whose jurisdiction\nthe registered office of your company is located for your doing the needful so as to reach\nthem  by February 10, 1999.  It may be clarified that even if you have already submitted\nthe return on liquid assets, the above formats are required to be completed and submitted\nwithout fail.\n5.       The non submission of the above return/information shall be viewed very seriously\nand penal action (including cancellation of the Certificate of Registration, if already\nissued, or rejection of the application as the case may be) will be initiated against the\nnon-compliant companies.\nYours faithfully,\n       Sd/-\n(D.
