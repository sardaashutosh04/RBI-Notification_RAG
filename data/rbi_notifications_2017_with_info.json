With the increased thrust on IT enabled f inancial inclusion and related customer \nprotection issues , and considering the recent surge in customer grievances relating to \nunauthorised transactions resulting in debits to their accounts /cards, the criteria for \ndetermining the customer liability in these circumstances have been reviewed. The \nrevised directions in this regard are set out below.  \nStrengthening of systems and procedures  \n3. Broadly, the electronic banking transactions can be divided into two categories:  \n(i) Remote/ online payment transactions  (transactions that do not require physical \npayment instruments to be presented at the point of transactions e.g. internet \nbanking, mobile banking, card not present (CNP)  transactions ), Pre -paid \nPayment Instruments (PPI), and    \n \n   \n2 \n \n(ii) Face- to-face/ proximity payment transactions (transactions which require the \nphysical payment instrument such as card or mobile phone to be present at the \npoint of transaction e.g. ATM, POS, etc.)  \n4. The systems and procedures in banks must be designed to make customers feel safe about carrying out electronic banking transactions. To achieve this, banks must put in place:  \n(i) appropriate systems and procedures to ensure safety and security of electronic banking transactions carried out by customers;  \n(ii) robust and dynamic fraud detection and prevention mechanism;  \n(iii) mechanism to assess the risks (for example, gaps in the bank\u2019s existing systems) resulting from unauthorised transactions and measure the liabilities arising out of such events;  \n(iv) appropriate measures to mitigate the risks and protect themselves against the liabilities arising therefrom; and  \n(v) a system of continually and repeatedly advising customers on how to protect \nthemselves from electronic banking and payments related fraud.  \nReporting of unauthorised transactions by customers to banks  \n5. Banks must ask their customers to mandatorily register for SMS alerts and,  wherever \navailable,  register for e- mail alerts, for electronic banking transactions. The SMS alerts \nshall mandatorily be sent to the customers, while email alerts may be sent , wherever \nregistered. The customers must be advised to notify their bank of any unauthorised electronic banking transaction at the earliest after the occurrence of such transaction, and informed that the longer the time taken to notify the bank, the higher will be the risk of loss to the bank/customer. To facilitate this, banks  providing e -banking services  must \nprovide customers with 24x7 access through multiple channels (at a minimum, via website, phone banking, SMS, e- mail, IVR, a dedicated toll -free hel pline, reporting to \nhome branch, etc.) for reporting unauthorised transactions that have taken place and/or loss or theft of payment instrument such as card, etc. Banks shall also enable  \n \n   \n3 \n \ncustomers to instantly respond by \"Reply\" to the SMS and e- mail alert s and the \ncustomers should not be required to search for a web page or an e- mail address to \nnotify the objection, if any. Further, a direct link for lodging the complaints, with specific \noption to report unauthorised electronic transactions shall be provided by banks on home page of their website. The loss/ fraud reporting system shall also ensure that \nimmediate response (including auto response) is sent to the customers acknowledging the complaint along with the registered complaint number. The communicatio n systems \nused by banks to send alerts and receive their responses thereto must record the time and date of delivery of the message and receipt of customer\u2019s response, if any, to them. This shall be important in determining the extent of a customer\u2019s liabi lity. The banks \nmay not offer facility of electronic transactions, other than ATM cash withdrawals, to customers who do not provide mobile numbers to the bank. On receipt of report of an unauthorised transaction from the customer, banks must take immediate steps to \nprevent further unauthorized transactions in the account.  \nLimited Liability of a Customer  \n(a) Zero Liability of a Customer  \n6. A customer\u2019s entitlement to zero liability shall arise where the unauthorised \ntransaction occurs in the following events:  \n(i) Contributory fraud/ negligence/ deficiency on the part of the bank (irrespective of \nwhether or not the transaction is reported by the customer).  \n(ii) Third party breach where the deficiency lies neither with the bank nor with the customer but lies elsewher e in the system, and the customer notifies the bank \nwithin three working days of receiving the communication from the bank \nregarding the unauthorised transaction.  \n(b) Limited Liability of a Customer  \n7. A customer shall be liable for the loss occurring due to unauthorised transactions in \nthe following cases:   \n \n   \n4 \n \n(i) In cases where the loss is due to negligence by a customer, such as where he \nhas shared the payment credentials, the customer will bear the entire loss until he reports the unauthorised transaction to the bank. Any loss occurring after the reporting of the unauthorised transaction shall be borne by the bank.  \n(ii) In cases where the responsibility for the unauthorised electronic banking transaction lies neither with the bank nor with the customer, but lies elsewhere in the system and the customer notifies  the bank of such a transaction within four \nto seven working days  of receiving a communication of the transaction, the per \ntransaction liability of the customer shall be limited to the transaction value or the amount mentioned in Table 1, whichever is lower.  \nTable 1 \nMaximum Liability of a Customer under paragraph 7 (ii)  \nType of Account  Maximum liability \n(\u20b9) \n\u2022 BSBD Accounts  5,000  \n\u2022 All other SB accounts  \n\u2022 Pre-paid Payment Instruments and Gift Cards  \n\u2022 Current/Cash Credit/Overdraft Accounts of MSMEs  \n\u2022 Current Accounts/ Cash Credit /Overdraft Accounts of \nIndividuals with annual average balance (during 365 \ndays preceding the incidence of fraud)/ limit up to Rs.25 lakh \n\u2022 Credit c ards with limit upto Rs. 5 lakh 10,000  \n\u2022 All other Current/Cash Credit/Overdraft Accounts  25,000  \nFurther, if the delay in reporting is beyond seven working days, the customer liability shall be determined as per the bank\u2019s Board approved policy. Banks shall provide the details of their policy in regard to customers\u2019 liability formulated in pursuance of these \ndirections at the time of opening the accounts. Banks shall also display their approved  \n \n   \n5 \n \npolicy in public domain for wider dissemination. The existing customers must also be \nindividually informed about the bank\u2019s policy.  \n8. Overall liability of the customer in third party breaches, as detailed in paragraph 6 (ii) and paragraph 7 (ii) above, where the deficiency lies neither with the bank nor with the customer but lies elsewhere in the system, is summaris ed in the Table 2:  \nTable 2 \nSummary of Customer\u2019s Liability  \nTime taken to report the fraudulent \ntransaction from the date of receiving \nthe communication Customer\u2019s liability (\u20b9) \nWithin 3 working days  Zero liability  \nWithin 4 to 7 working days  The transacti on value or the amount \nmentioned in Table 1, whichever is lower  \nBeyond 7 working days  As per bank\u2019s Board approved policy  \nThe number of working days mentioned in Table 2 shall be counted as per the working schedule of the home branch of the customer excl uding the date of receiving the \ncommunication.  \nReversal Timeline for Zero Liability/Limited Liability of customer  \n9. On being notified by the customer, the bank shall credit (shadow reversal) the amount involved in the unauthorised electronic transaction t o the customer\u2019s account \nwithin 10 working days from the date of such notification by the customer (without waiting for settlement of insurance claim, if any).  The credit shall be value dated to be \nas of the date of the unauthorised transaction.  Banks may also at their discretion decide \nto waive off any customer liability in case of unauthorised electronic banking transactions even in cases of customer negligence.  \n \n   \n \n   \n6 \n \n10. Further, banks shall ensure that:  \n(i) a complaint is resolved and liability of the customer, if any, established and the \ncustomer is compensated as per provisions of paragraphs 6 to 9 above,  within \nsuch time as may be specified in the bank\u2019s Board approved policy, but not exceeding 90 days from the date of receipt of the complaint ;  \n(ii) where it is  unable to resolve the complaint or determine the customer liability, if \nany, within 90 days, the compensation as prescribed in paragraphs 6 to 9 is paid immediately to the customer; and  \n(iii) in case of debit card/ bank account, the customer does not suffer los s of interest, \nand in case of credit card, the customer does not bear any additional burden of interest.  \nBoard Approved Policy for Customer Protection \n11. Bank shall formulate / revise their customer relations policy with approval of their \nBoards, which should clearly define the rights and obligations of customers in case of unauthorized transactions in specified scenarios i.e. debits to customer accounts \nowning to customer negligence / bank negligence / banking system frauds/ third party breaches etc. The policy should also include mechanism of creating customer \nawareness on the risks and responsibilities involved in electronic banking transactions, and customer liability in case of unauthorized electronic banking transactions, procedure for reporting unaut horized electronic banking transactions and \nacknowledgement of complaints. It should also provide for a robust grievance redressal structure as per extant instr uctions,  escalation matrix, clear timelines for resolution of \ncustomer complaints , and compensat ion keeping in view the instructions contained in \nparagraph 10 above. The instructions contained in this circular shall be incorporated in the policy, and the policy should be prominently displayed at branches.  \nBurden of Proof  \n12. The burden of proving customer liability in case of unauthorised electronic banking \ntransactions shall lie on the bank.   \n \n   \n7 \n \n \nReporting and Monitoring Requirements  \n13. The banks shall put in place a suitable mechanism and structure for the reporting of \ncases of unauthorized electronic banking transactions to the Board or one of its \nCommittees. The reporting shall, inter alia, include volume/ number of cases and the \naggregate value involved and distribution across various categories of cases viz., card present transactions, card not pr esent transactions, internet banking, mobile banking, \nATM transactions, etc . The Board in each bank shall periodically review the \nunauthorised electronic banking transactions reported by customers or otherwise, as also the action taken thereon, the functioning of the grievance redress al mechanism \nand take appropriate measures to improve the systems and procedures.  All such \ntransactions shall be reviewed by the bank\u2019s internal auditors.  \n14.

In such scenario, both agency \nbank acting as aggregator and other agency bank share the eligible agency commission \non such transactions.  \n2. In the age of prevailing Core Banking Solutions/e- banking systems in all the \nagency banks, Reserve Bank  is committed to provide fast, efficient and secure banking \nfacility to the State Government s by implementation of standardised e- receipt s and e-\npayments with its CBS (e -Kuber) , enabling RBI  to act as single point of contact for \nsettling state government funds ( receipts/payment ). This will also facilitate better cash \nmanagement by the State Governments.   \n3. Therefore, on review , it has been decided that  all agency banks should settle their \nagency transactions for both funds and agency commission directly with the concerned \nRegional Office of Reserve Bank instead of routing them through any other agency bank \nthat acts as aggregator in certain cases . It effectively makes all  agency banks to report  \ngovernment receipts  directly to RBI instead of reporting them  through any other agency \nbank . So also for payments made by all agency banks on behalf of state government /s \nget directly settled with the concerned R egional Office of RBI.  Agency Transaction \ndetails/scrolls may be sent directly by individual agency bank to the concerned State \nGovernment/Treasury.   This arrangement is expected to improve management of State \nGovernment funds apart from reducing inefficiencies in the system.     \n\u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930\ufffd \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u092c \ufffd\u0915 \u0932\u0947\u0916\u093e \ufffd\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , \u0915\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f , \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 \u0938\ufffd\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0932 \u0930\u0947\u0932\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0936\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0947 , \u092d\u093e\u092f\u0916\u0932\u093e, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 008  \nDepartment of Government & Bank Accounts, Central Office, Opp. Mumbai Central Railway Station, Byculla, Mumbai - 400 008  \nTelephone: (022) 2308 4121, Fax No. (022) 2300 0370/2301 6072/2301 0095, e -mail : pcgmdgbaco@rbi.org.in \n \n\ufffd\u0939\u0928\u094d\u0926\ufffd \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948 , \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0907\u090f \u0964  \n \n 4.

D. Srinivasan) \nChief General Manager   Annex \nDirections on Managing Risks and Code of Conduct in Outsourcing of Financial \nServices by NBFCs  \n 1.        Introduction \n1.1 'Outsourcing' is defined as the NBFC\u2019s use of a third party (either an affiliated entity \nwithin a corporate group or an entity that is external to the corporate group) to perform \nactivities on a continuing basis that would normally be undertaken by the NBFC itself, now or \nin the future.   \n\u2018Continuing basis' includes agreements for a limited period. 1.2 NBFCs have been outsourcing various activities and are hence exposed to various \nrisks as detailed in para 5.3. Further, the outsourced activities are to be brought within \nregulatory purview  to a) protect the interest of the customers of NBFCs and b) to ensure that \nthe NBFC concerned and the Reserve Bank of India have access to all relevant books, \nrecords and information available with service provider. Typically outsourced financial services  include applications processing (loan origination, credit card), document \nprocessing, marketing and research, supervision of loans, data processing and back office related activities, besides others.  \n1.3 Some key risks in outsourcing are Strategic Risk, Reputation Risk, Compliance Risk, \nOperational Risk, Legal Risk, Exit Strategy Risk, Counterparty Risk, Country Risk, Contractual Risk, Access Risk, Concentration and Systemic Risk. The failure of a service \nprovider in providing a specified service, a breach in security/ confidentiality, or non-\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements by the service provider can lead to \nfinancial losses or loss of reputation for the NBFC and could also lead to systemic risks.  \n1.4    It is therefore imperative for the NBFC outsourcing its activities to ensure sound and \nresponsive risk management practices for effective oversight, due diligence and \nmanagement of risks arising from such outsourced activities. The directions are applicable to material outsourcing arrangements as explained in para 3 which may be entered into by an NBFC with a service provider located in India or elsewhere. The service provider may either be a member of the group/ conglomerate to which the NBFC belongs, or an unrelated party. \n1.5    The underlying principles behind these directions  are that the regulated entity shall \nensure that outsourcing arrangements neither diminish its ability to fulfil its obligations to \ncustomers and RBI nor impede effective supervision by RBI. NBFCs, therefore, have to take steps to ensure that the service provider employs the same high standard of care in \nperforming the services as is expected to be employed by the NBFCs, if the activities were \nconducted within the NBFCs and not outsourced. Accordingly, NBFCs shall not engage in  outsourcing that would result in their internal control, business conduct or reputation being \ncompromised or weakened. 1.6    (i)   These directions  are concerned with managing risks in outsourcing of fi nancial \nservices and are  not  applicable  to  technology -related  issues and activities  not  related  to  \nfinancial services, such as  usage of courier, catering of staff, housekeeping and janitorial  \nservices,  security  of  the premises, movement and archiving of records, etc. NBFCs which \ndesire to outsource financial services would not require prior approval from RBI. However, \nsuch arrangements would be subject to on-site/ off- site monitoring and inspection/ scrutiny \nby RBI.  \n(ii)    In regard to outsourced services relating to credit cards, RBI's detailed instructions contained in its circular on credit card activities vide \nDBOD.FSD.BC.49/24.01.011/2005-06 \ndated November  21, 2005  would be applicable.  \n \n2.        Activities that shall not be outsourced \nNBFCs which choose to outsource financial services shall, however, not outsource core \nmanagement functions including Internal Audit, Strategic and Compliance functions and  \ndecision-making functions such as determining compliance with KYC norms for opening deposit accounts, according sanction for loans (including retail loans) and management of investment portfolio. However, for NBFCs in a group/ conglomerate, these functions m ay be \noutsourced within the group subject to compliance with instructions in Para 6. Further, w hile \ninternal audit function itself is a management process, the internal auditors can be on \ncontract.  \n 3. Material Outsourcing \nFor the purpose of these directions,  material outsourcing arrangements are those which, if \ndisrupted, have the potential to significantly impact the business operations, reputation, \nprofitability or customer service. Materiality of outsourcing would be based on: \n\u2022 the level of importance to the NBFC of the activity being outsourced as well as the \nsignificance of the risk posed by the same; \n\u2022 the potential impact of the outsourcing on the NBFC on various parameters such as \nearnings, solvency, liquidity, funding capital and risk profile;  \n\u2022 the  likely  impact  on  the  NBFC\u2019s  reputation  and  brand  value,  and  ability  to  achieve  its business objectives, strategy and plans, should the service provider fail to perform the service;  \n\u2022 the cost of the outsourcing as a proportion of total operating costs of the NBFC;   \u2022 the aggregate exposure to that particular service provider, in cases where the NBFC \noutsources various functions to the same service provider and \n\u2022 the significance of activities outsourced in context of customer service and protection.  \n 4.        NBFC's role and Regulatory and Supervisory Requirements \n4.1    The outsourcing of any activity by NBFC does not diminish its obligations, and those of \nits Board and senior management, who have the ultimate responsibility for the outsourced activity . NBFCs would therefore be responsible for the actions of their service provider \nincluding Direct Sales Agents/ Direct Marketing Agents and recovery agents and the \nconfidentiality of information pertaining to the customers that is available with the servic e \nprovider. NBFCs shall retain ultimate control of the outsourced activity. \n4.2    It is imperative for the NBFC, when performing its due diligence in relation to outsourcing, to consider all relevant laws, regulations, guidelines and conditions of approval, \nlicensing or registration.  \n4.3    Outsourcing arrangements shall  not affect the rights of a customer against the NBFC, \nincluding the ability of the customer to obtain redress as applicable under relevant laws. In \ncases where the customers are required to deal with the service providers in the process of \ndealing with the NBFC, NBFCs shall incorporate a clause in the relative product literature/ \nbrochures, etc., stating that they may use the services of agents in sales/ marketing etc. of the products. The role of agents may be indicated in broad terms. 4.4    The service provider shall not impede or interfere with the ability of the NBFC to effectively oversee and manage its activities nor shall  it impede the Reserve Bank of India in \ncarrying out its supervisory functions and objectives. 4.5    NBFCs need to have a robust grievance redress mechanism, which in no way shall  be \ncompromised on account of outsourcing. \n4.6 The service provider, if not a group company of the NBFC, shall not be owned or \ncontrolled by any director of the NBFC or their relatives; these terms have the same \nmeaning as assigned under Companies Act, 2013. \n \n5.        Risk Management practices for Outsourced Financial Services \n5.1    Outsourcing Policy  \nAn NBFC intending to outsource any of its financial activities shall put in place a comprehensive outsourcing policy, approved by its Board, which incorporates, inter alia, criteria for selection of such activities as well as service providers, delegation of authority depending on risks and materiality and systems to monitor and review the operations of \nthese activities. \n  5.2    Role of the Board and Senior Management  \n5.2.1   Role of the Board \nThe Board of the NBFC, or a Committee of the Board to which powers have been delegated \nshall be responsible inter alia  for the following:  \ni. approving a framework to evaluate the risks and materiality of all existing and \nprospective outsourcing and the pol icies that apply to such arrangements; \nii. laying down appropriate approval authorities for outsourcing depending on risks and \nmateriality; \niii.       setting up suitable administrative framework of senior management for the purpose of these directions;  \niv. undertaking regular review of outsourcing strategies and arrangements for their \ncontinued relevance, and safety and soundness and \nv. deciding on business activities of a material nature to be outsourced, and approving \nsuch arrangements. \n \n5.2.2    Responsibilities of the Senior Management  \ni. Evaluating the risks and materiality of all existing and prospective outsourcing, based \non the framework approved by the Board; ii. developing and implementing sound and prudent outsourcing policies and \nprocedures commensurate with the nature, scope and complexity of the outsourcing activity; \niii. reviewing periodically the effectiveness of policies and procedures;  \niv. communicating information pertaining to material outsourcing risks to the Board in a \ntimely manner; \nv. ensuring that contingency plans, based on realistic and probable disruptive \nscenarios, are in place and tested;  \nvi. ensuring that there is independent review and audit for compliance with set policies \nand vii. undertaking periodic review of outsourcing arrangements to identify new material \noutsourcing risks as they arise.  \n \n5.3    Evaluation of the Risks \nThe NBFCs shall evaluate and guard against the following risks in outsourcing:  \ni. Strategic Risk \u2013 Where the service provider conducts business on its own behalf, \ninconsistent with the overall strategic goals of the NBFC.  \nii. Reputation Risk \u2013 Where the service provided is poor and customer interaction is \nnot consistent with the overall standards expected of the NBFC.  iii. Compliance Risk \u2013 Where privacy, consumer and prudential laws are not \nadequately complied with by the service provider. \niv. Operational Risk - Arising out of technology failure, fraud, error, inadequate financial \ncapacity to fulfil obligations and/ or to provide remedies.  \nv. Legal Risk \u2013 Where the NBFC is subjected to fines, penalties, or punitive damages \nresulting from supervisory actions, as well as private settlements due to omissions \nand commissions of the service provider. \nvi. Exit Strategy Risk \u2013 Where the NBFC is over -reliant on one firm, the loss of \nrelevant skills in the NBFC itself preventing it from bringing the activity back in -\nhouse and where NBFC has entered into contracts that make speedy exits prohibitively expensive. \nvii. Counter party Risk \u2013 Where there is inappropriate underwriting or credit \nassessments.  \nviii. Contractual Risk \u2013 Where the NBFC may not have the ability to enforce the \ncontract.  \nix. Concentration and Systemic Risk \u2013 Where the overall industry has considerable \nexposure to one service provider and hence the NBFC may lack control over the service provider.  \nx.       Country Risk \u2013 Due to the political, social or legal climate creating added risk.  \n \n5.4    Evaluating the Capability of the Service Provider  \n5.4.1    In considering or renewing an outsourcing arrangement, appropriate due diligence shall be performed to assess the capability of the service provider to comply with obligations in the outsourcing agreement. Due diligence shall take into consideration qualitative and quantitative, financial, operational and reputational factors. NBFCs shall consider whether \nthe service providers' systems are compatible with their own and also whether their \nstandards of performance including in the area of customer service are acceptable to it. NBFCs shall also consider, while evaluating the capability of the service provider, issues relating to undue concentration of outsourcing arrangements with a single service provider. Where possible, the NBFC shall obtain independent reviews and market feedback on the \nservice provider to supplement its own findings.  \n5.4.2    Due diligence shall involve an evaluation of all available information about the \nservice provider, including but not limited to the following:  \ni. past experience and competence to implement and support the proposed activ ity \nover the contracted period; \nii. financial soundness and ability to service commitments even under adverse \nconditions;   iii. business reputation and culture, compliance, complaints and outstanding or potential \nlitigation;  \niv. security and internal control, audit coverage, reporting and monitoring environment, \nbusiness continuity management and \nv. ensuring due diligence by service provider of its employees. \n \n5.5    The Outsourcing Agreement  \nThe terms and conditions governing the contract between the NBFC and the service \nprovider shall be carefully defined in written agreements and vetted by NBFC's legal counsel on their legal effect and enforceability. Every such agreement shall address the risks and risk mitigation strategies. The agreement shall be sufficiently flexible to allow the NBFC to retain an appropriate level of control over the outsourcing and the right to intervene with \nappropriate measures to meet legal and regulatory obligations. The agreement shall also \nbring out the nature of legal relationship between the parties - i.e. whether agent, principal or \notherwise. Some of the key provisions of the contract shall be the following:  \ni. the contract shall  clearly define what activities are going to be outsourced including \nappropriate service and performance standards;  \nii. the NBFC must ensure it has the ability to access all books, records and information \nrelevant to the outsourced activity available with the service provider; iii. the contract shall  provide for continuous monitoring and assessment by the NBFC of \nthe service provider so that any necessary corrective measure can be taken immediately; \niv. a termination clause and minimum period to execute a termination provision, if \ndeemed necessary, shall  be included; \nv. controls to ensure customer data confidentiality and service providers' liability in case \nof breach of security and leakage of confidential customer related information shall  be \nincorporated; \nvi. there must be contingency plans to ensure business continuity; \nvii. the contract shall  provide for the prior approval/ consent by the NBFC of the use of \nsubcontractors by the service provider for all or part of an outsourced activity; viii. it shall  provide the NBFC with the right to conduct audits on the service provider \nwhether by its internal or external auditors, or by agents appointed to act on its behalf and to obtain copies of any audit or review reports and findings made on the service provider in conjunction with the services performed for the NBFC;  \nix. outsourcing agreements shall include clauses to allow the Reserve Bank of India or \npersons authorised by it to access the NBFC's documents, records of transactions, and other necessary information given to, stored or processed by the service provider within a reasonable time;  x. outsourcing agreement shall  also include a clause to recognise the right of the \nReserve Bank to cause an inspection to be made of a service provider of an NBFC and its \nbooks and account by one or more of its officers or employees or other persons; \nxi. the outsourcing agreement shall  also provide that confidentiality of customer's \ninformation shall  be maintained even after the contract expires or gets terminated and \nxii. the NBFC shall  have necessary provisions to ensure that the service provider \npreserves documents as required by law and take suitable steps to ensure that its interests are protected in this regard even post termination of the services.  \n \n5.6    Confidentiality and Security  \n5.6.1    Public confidence and customer trust in the NBFC is a prerequisite for the stability \nand reputation of the NBFC. Hence the NBFC shall  seek to ensure the preservation and \nprotection of the security and confidentiality of customer information in the custody or possession of the service provider. 5.6.2    Access to customer information by staff of the service provider shall  be on 'need to \nknow' basis i.e., limited to those areas where the information is required in order to perform \nthe outsourced function.  \n5.6.3    The NBFC shall  ensure that the service provider is able to isolate and clearly identify \nthe NBFC's customer information, documents, records and assets to protect the \nconfidentiality of the information. In instances, where service provider acts as an outsourcing agent for multiple NBFCs, care shall  be taken to build strong safeguards so that there is no \ncomingling of information / documents, records and assets.  \n5.6.4    The NBFC shall  review and monitor the security practices and control processes of \nthe service provider on a regular basis and require the service provider to disclose security breaches.  \n5.6.5    The NBFC shall  immediately notify RBI in the event of any breach of security and \nleakage of confidential customer related information. In these eventualities, the NBFC would be liable to its customers for any damages.  \n5.7    Responsibilities of Direct Sales Agents (DSA)/ Direct Marketing Agents (DMA) / \nRecovery Agents \n5.7.1    NBFCs shall  ensure that the DSA/ DMA/ Recovery Agents are properly trained to \nhandle their responsibilities with care and sensitivity, particularly aspects such as soliciting \ncustomers, hours of calling, privacy of customer information and conveying the correct terms \nand conditions of the products on offer, etc.  \n5.7.2    NBFCs shall  put in place a board approved Code of conduct for DSA/ D MA/ \nRecovery Agents, and obtain their undertaking to abide by the code. In addition, Recovery  Agents shall  adhere to extant instructions on Fair Practices Code for NBFCs as also their \nown code for collection of dues and repossession of security. It is essential that the \nRecovery Agents refrain from action that could damage the integrity and reputation of the \nNBFC and that they observe strict customer confidentiality.  \n5.7.3    The NBFC and their agents shall  not resort to intimidation or harassment of any ki nd, \neither verbal or physical, against any person in their debt collection efforts, including acts \nintended to humiliate publicly or intrude the privacy of the debtors' family members, referees \nand friends, making threatening and anonymous calls or making false and misleading \nrepresentations.  \n5.8    Business Continuity and Management of Disaster Recovery Plan \n5.8.1   An NBFC shall  require its service providers to develop and establish a robust \nframework for documenting, maintaining and testing business continuity and recovery \nprocedures. NBFCs need to ensure that the service provider periodically tests the Business Continuity and Recovery Plan and may also consider occasional joint testing and recovery exercises with its service provider. \n5.8.2   In order to mitigate the risk of unexpected termination of the outsourcing agreement \nor liquidation of the service provider, NBFCs shall  retain an appropriate level of control over \ntheir outsourcing and the right to intervene with appropriate measures to continue its \nbusiness operations in such cases without incurring prohibitive expenses and without any break in the operations of the NBFC and its services to the customers. \n5.8.3    In establishing a viable contingency plan, NBFCs shall  consider the availability of \nalternative service providers or the possibility of bringing the outsourced activity back in-\nhouse in an emergency and the costs, time and resources that would be involved.  \n5.8.4    Outsourcing often leads to the sharing of facilities operated by the ser vice provider. \nThe NBFC shall  ensure that service providers are able to isolate the NBFC's information, \ndocuments and records, and other assets. This is to ensure that in appropriate situations, all documents, records of transactions and information given to the service provider, and assets of the NBFC, can be removed from the possession of the service provider in order to continue its business operations, or deleted, destroyed or rendered unusable.  \n 5.9    Monitoring and Control of Outsourced Activities \n5.9.1    The NBFC shall  have in place a management structure to monitor and control its \noutsourcing activities. It shall  ensure that outsourcing agreements with the service provider \ncontain provisions to address their monitoring and control of outsourced ac tivities.  \n5.9.2    A central record of all material outsourcing that is readily accessible for review by the \nBoard and senior management of the NBFC shall  be maintained. The records shall  be  updated promptly and half yearly reviews shall  be placed before the Board or Risk \nManagement Committee. \n5.9.3    Regular audits by either the internal auditors or external auditors of the NBFC shall  \nassess the adequacy of the risk management practices adopted in overseeing and managing the outsourcing arrangement, the NBFC's compliance with its risk management framework and the requirements of these directions. 5.9.4    NBFCs shall  at least on an annual basis, review the financial and operational \ncondition of the service provider to assess its ability to continue to meet its outsourcing \nobligations. Such due diligence reviews, which can be based on all available information about the service provider shall  highlight any deterioration or breach in performance \nstandards, confidentiality and security, and in business continuity preparedness.  \n5.9.5    In the event of termination of the outsourcing agreement for any reason in cases \nwhere the service provider deals with the customers, the same shall  be publicized by \ndisplaying at a prominent place in the branch, posting it on the web-site, and informing the \ncustomers  so as to ensure that the customers do not continue to deal with the service \nprovider. 5.9.6 Certain cases, like outsourcing of cash management, might involve reconciliation of \ntransactions between the NBFC, the service provider and its sub-contractors. In such cases, \nNBFCs shall ensure that reconciliation of transactions between the NBFC and the service provider (and/ or its sub -contractor), are carried out in a timely manner. An ageing analysis \nof entries pending reconciliation with outsourced vendors shall be placed before the Audit \nCommittee of the Board (ACB) and NBFCs  shall make efforts to reduce the old outstanding \nitems therein at the earliest.  \n5.9.7 A robust system of internal audit of all outsourced activities shall also be put in place \nand monitored by the ACB of the NBFC.  \n \n5.10 Redress of Grievances related to Outsourced Services \ni. NBFCs shall  constitute Grievance Redressal Machinery  as contained in RBI\u2019s \ncircular on Grievance Redressal Mechanism vide \nDNBS. CC. PD. No. 320/03. 10. \n01/2012-13 dated February 18, 2013 . At the operational level, all NBFCs shall  display the \nname and contact details (Telephone/ Mobile nos. as also email address) of the Grievance \nRedressal Officer prominently  at their branches/ places where business is transacted. The \ndesignated officer shall  ensure that genuine grievances of customers are redressed \npromptly without involving delay. It shall  be clearly indicated that NBFCs' Grievance \nRedressal Machinery will also deal with the issue relating to services provided by the \noutsourced agency.  ii. Generally, a time limit of 30 days may be given to the customers for preferring their \ncomplaints / grievances.  The grievance redressal procedure of the NBFC and the time \nframe fixed for responding to the complaints shall  be placed on the NBFC's website.  \n \n5.11    Reporting of transactions to FIU or other competent authorities \nNBFCs would be responsible for making Currency Transactions Reports and Suspicious \nTransactions Reports to FIU or any other competent authority in respect of the NBFCs' \ncustomer related activities carried out by the service providers. \n \n6.        Outsourcing within a Group/ Conglomerate \n6.1 In a group structure, NBFCs may have back -office and service arrangements/ \nagreements with group entities e.g. sharing of premises, legal and other professional \nservices, hardware and software applications, centralize back -office functions, outsourcing \ncertain financial services to other group entities, etc. Before entering into such arrangements \nwith group entities, NBFCs shall  have a Board approved policy and also service level \nagreements/ arrangements with their group entities, which shall also cover demarcation of \nsharing resources i.e. premises, personnel, etc. Moreover the customers shall  be informed \nspecifically about the company which is actually offering the product/ service, wherever there \nare multiple group entities involved or any cross selling observed.  \n6.2 While entering into such arrangements, NBFCs shall ensure that these: \na. are appropriately documented in written agreements with details like scope of services, charges for the services and maintaining confidentiality of the customer's data; \nb. do not lead to any confusion to the customers on whose products/ services they are \navailing by clear physical demarcation of the space where the activities of the NBFC and those of its other group entities are undertaken;  \nc. do not compromise the ability to identify and manage risk of the NBFC on a stand-alone \nbasis;  \nd. do not prevent the RBI from being able to obtain information required for the supervision of the NBFC or pertaining to the group as a whole; and  \ne. incorporate a clause under the written agreements that there is a clear obligation for any \nservice provider to comply with directions given by the RBI in relation to the activities of the \nNBFC.  \n6.3 NBFCs  shall ensure that their ability to carry out their operations in a sound fashion \nwould not be affected if premises or other services (such as IT systems, support staff) \nprovided by the group entities become unavailable. \n6.4 If the premises of the NBFC are shared with the group entities for the purpose of \ncross-sell ing, NBFCs shall take measures to ensure that the entity's identification is distinctly  visible and clear to the customers. The marketing brochure used by the group entity and \nverbal communication by its staff / agent in the NBFCs premises shall  mention nature of \narrangement of the entity with the NBFC so that the customers are clear on the seller of the \nproduct.  \n6.5 NBFCs shall not publish any advertisement or enter into any agreement stating or \nsuggesting or giving tacit impression that they are in any way responsible for the obligations \nof its group entities.  \n6.6 The risk management practices expected to be adopted by an NBFC while \noutsourcing to a related party (i.e. party within the Group / Conglomerate) would be identical to those specified in Para 5 of this directions.  \n \n7. Off-shore outsourcing of Financial Services \n7.1 The engagement of service providers in a foreign country exposes an NBFC to \ncountry risk -economic,  social  and  political  conditions  and  events  in  a  foreign  country  \nthat  may  adversely affect the NBFC. Such conditions and events could prevent the service \nprovider from carrying out the terms of its agreement with the NBFC.  To  manage  the  country  risk  involved  in  such outsourcing  activities,  the  NBFC  shall  take  into  account  \nand closely  monitor  government policies  and  political,  social,  economic  and  legal  \nconditions  in  countries  where  the  service provider is based, both during the risk assessment process and on a continuous basis, and establish sound  procedures  for  dealing  with  country  risk  problems. This includes having appropriate contingency and exit \nstrategies. In principle, arrangements shall  only be entered into with parties operating in \njurisdictions generally upholding confidentiality clauses and agreements. The governing law \nof the arrangement shall  also be clearly specified. \n 7.2 The activities outsourced outside India shall  be conducted in a manner so as not to \nhinder efforts to supervise or reconstruct the India activities of the NBFC in a timely manner. \n7.3 As regards the off-shore outsourcing of financial services relating to Indian \nOperations, NBFCs shall  additionally ensure that  \na) Where the off-shore service provider is a regulated entity, the relevant off-shore \nregulator will neither obstruct the arrangement nor object to RBI inspection visits/ visits  of \nNBFCs internal and external auditors. \nb) The availability of records to management and the RBI will withstand the liquidation of either the offshore custodian or the NBFC in India. \nc) The regulatory authority of the offshore location does not have access to the data \nrelating to Indian operations of the NBFC simply on the ground that the processing is being  undertaken there (not applicable if off shore processing is done in the home c ountry of the \nNBFC).  \nd) The jurisdiction of the courts in the off shore location where data is maintained does not \nextend to the operations of the NBFC in India on the strength of the fact that the data is \nbeing processed there even though the actual transactions are undertaken in India and e) All original records continue to be maintained in India. \n***** \n \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT87_091117658624E4F2D041A699F73068D55BF6C5.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 09, 2017", "info": "                                                                     \n                                                        \n\u092c\ufffd\ufffd\u0915\u0902\u0917 \ufffd\u0935\ufffd\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \ufffd\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , \u0915\ufffd\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f , 5\u0935\u0940\u0902  \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932 , \u0905\u092e\u0930 \u092d\u0935\u0928 ,  \u0938\u0930 \u092a\u0940 \u090f\u092e \u0930\u094b\u0921 , \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908  400001  \n                            Department of Banking Regulation, Central Office, 5th floor, Amar Building, Sir P.M.Road, Mumbai -400001  \n\u091f\u0947\u0932\ufffd\u092b\u094b\u0928 /Tel No:022- 22603000  Email ID: returnsco@rbi.org.in  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRBI/2017- 18/86 \nDBR.No.Ret.BC. 93/12.07.150/2017- 18                 November 09 , 2017  \n \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks  \n  \nDear Sir /Madam , \n \nInclusion of \u201cAu Small Finance Bank Limited\u201d  in the Second Schedule of \nthe Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934  \n    \n \nWe advise that the \u201c Au Small Finance Bank Limited\u201d has been included in the \nSecond Schedule to the Reserve Bank of India Ac t, 1934 vide Notification \nDBR.

LEI is a 20 -digit unique code to identify parties to financial \ntransactions worldwide.  \n2. The L EI for the participants  of the OTC derivatives  market  has since been \nimplemented vide \ncircular RBI/2016- 17/314 FMRD.FMID No.14/11.01.007/2- 16-17 \ndated June 01, 2017  in a phased manner.  \n3.  In the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated October 4, \n2017 it was indicated that LEI system for all borrowers of b anks having total fund \nbased and non- fund based exposure of ` 5 crore and above will be introduced in a \nphased manner (extract enclosed). Accordingly, it has been decided that the banks \nshall advise their existing large corporate borrowers  having total exposures of ` 50 \ncrore and above to obtain LEI as per the schedule given in the Annex . Borrowers \nwho do not obtain LEI as per the schedule are not to be granted renewal / \nenhancement of credit facilities.  A separate roadmap for borrowers having exposure \nbetween ` 5 crore and upto ` 50 crore would be issued in due course.  \n4. Banks should encourage large borrowers to obtain LEI for their parent entity as \nwell as all subsidiaries and associates.  \n 2 \n5. Entities can obtain LEI from any of the Local Operating Units (LOUs) accredited \nby the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) \u2013  the entity tasked to \nsupport the implementation and use of LEI. In India, LEI code may be obtained from \nLegal Entity Identifier India Ltd (LEIIL), a subsidiary of the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), whic h has been recognised by the Reserve Bank as issuer of \nLEI under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 and is accredited by the GLEIF as the Local Operating Unit (LOU) in India for issuance and management of LEI. \n6. The rules, procedure and document ation requirements may be ascertained from \nLEIIL\n. \n7. After obtaining LEI code, banks shall also ensure that borrowers renew  the codes \nas per GLEIF guidelines.  \n8. These directions are issued under Section 21 and Section 35(A) of the Banking \nRegulation Act, 1949.  \n \nYours faithfully,  \n \n(S.S. Barik ) \nChief General Manager -in-Charge \n \n  3 \nExtracts from Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies \ndated October 4, 2017  \n \n5. Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) - It has been decided to require banks to make it \nmandatory for corporate borrowers having aggregate fund- based and non- fund \nbased exposure of ` 5 crore and above from any bank to obtain Legal Entity \nIdentifier (LEI) registration and capture the same in the Central Repository of \nInformation on Large Credits (CRILC). This will facilitate assessment of aggregate \nborrowing by corporate groups, and monitoring of the financial profile of an \nentity/group. This requirement will be implemented in a calibrated, but time -bound \nmanner.

The Chairman& Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer  \n(All Banks having Currency Chests)  \n2. The Director of Treasuries  \n(State Governments)  \nDear Sir/Madam  \nMaster Direction on Levy of Penal Interest for Delayed Reporting/Wrong \nReporting/Non- Reporting of Currency Chest Transactions and Inclusion of \nIneligible Amounts in Currency Chest Balances  \nIn terms of the Preamble, under Section 45 of the R BI Act, 1934 and 35 A of the Banking \nRegulation Act,  1949,  the Bank issues  guidelines / instructions for realising  the \nobjectives of our Clean Note Policy.  With a view to sustain these efforts  and ensure  \ndiscipline among the banks on timely and accurate r eporting of  currency chest \ntransactions, we have  issued instructions on the subject.     \n \n2. The Master Direction enclosed incorporates updated guidelines / circulars on the \nsubject.  The Direction will be updated from time to time as and when fresh instructions \nare issued.  \n \n3. This Master Direction has been placed on RBI website at www.rbi.org.in . \n Yours faithfully,  \n  \n(P. Vijaya Kumar)  \nChief General Manager  \n \nEncl : As above  Annex  \n  \n1. Penal interest for Delayed Reporting/Wrong Reporting/Non- Reporting of \nCurrency Chest Transactions  \n1.1  Reporting of Currency Chest Transactions  \nThe minimum amount of deposit into/withdrawal from currency chest will be ` 1,00,000/ -  \nand thereafter, in multiples of ` 50,000/ -. \n1.2  Time limit for Reporting \n1.2.1 The currency chests should invariably report all transactions through ICCOMS on \nthe same day by 9 PM by uploading data through the Secured Website (SWS) to \ntheir respective link offices. Link offices should invariably report the c onsolidated \nposition to the Issue Offices latest by 11 PM on the same day.  \n1.2.2 The Sub- Treasury Offices (STOs) should report all transactions directly to the \nIssue Office of the Reserve Bank by 11 PM on the same day.  \n1.2.3 Relaxation in respect of strike period in banks  \nRelaxation in the reporting period on account of general/specific strike situation \nwill be considered on case- to-case basis.  \n1.3  Levy of penal interest for delays \n1.3.1 In the event of delay in reporting currency chest transactions, pen al interest at the \nrate indicated in paragraph 3 of this circular will be levied on the amount due from the chest holding bank for the period of delay. Penal interest will be calculated on \nT+0 basis i.e. penal interest will be levied in respect of transact ions not reported \nby Link Office to the Issue Office by 11 PM on the same business day. However, Reserve Bank may at its discretion grant appropriate grace period in the matter of \nlevy of penal interest.  \n1.3.2 Penal interest will also be charged for delay  in submission of chest slips in the \ncase of single chest / STOs directly linked to Issue Department of the circle.  \n1.4  Wrong reporting and levy of penal interest  \nPenal interest will be levied in respect of all cases of wrong reporting in the same manner  \ntill the date of receipt of corrected advice by Reserve Bank. As debits/credits to banks' \ncurrent accounts are raised on the basis of the figures reported in the Link Office \nStatements, penal interest will invariably be levied in all cases of wrong report ing in the \nLink Office Statements even if the reporting was done correctly in the chest slips. It is \nexpected that Link Offices would ensure the correctness of figures reported by the \nrespective currency chests.  Particular care should be taken to ensure that remittances of fresh notes/notes to the currency chests are not reported as 'deposit' transactions in the \nLink Office Statements . \n1.5 Reporting of Soiled note remittances to RBI  / diversion to other chests  \nSoiled note remittances to RBI /diversion to other currency chest/s should not be shown \nas withdrawal by chest/s / link offices. In case such remittances are wrongly reported as \n'withdrawals', a penalty of ` 50,000/ - will be levied irrespective of the value of remittance \nand period of such wrong reporting.  \n1.6 Reporting of diversions in ICCOMS   \nAs regards reporting of diversion/s in ICCOMS, they must be reported in the column \"2A and 4 A\" i.e.  the chest receiving the diversi on should report under 2 A and the remitting \nchest should report the amount under 4A in the chest slip without any delay. Diversion amounts, even to the chest of the same bank should not be reported under \"Withdrawal\" \nand \"Deposit\" columns i.e. 4E and 2E (which are for currency transfer transactions).   \n1.7  Maximum penal interest to be charged  \nThere is no stipulation regarding the maximum amount of penal interest leviable for \nwrong/delayed reporting. As the intention is to ensure timely and correct reporting of \nchest transactions, penal interest will be recovered in all applicable c ases, irrespective of \nthe amount of the transaction concerned/amount of penal interest subject to rounding off the penal interest amount to the nearest Rupee.  \n2. Penal interest for inclusion of ineligible amounts in the currency chest \nbalances  \n2.1 Penal i nterest will be levied in all cases where the bank has enjoyed 'ineligible' \ncredit in its current account with Reserve Bank on account of wrong reporting / delayed \nreporting/non- reporting of transactions.  Penal measures will also be taken in cases of \nshortages in chest balances / remittances, shortages due to pilferage / frauds, counterfeit \nbanknotes detected in chest balances / remittances as per the prevailing \u201c scheme of \nPenalties \u201d.  \n2.2 Further, only cash held in the custody of joint custodians and 'freely available' to \nthem is eligible for inclusion in the chest balances. Thus, cash kept for safe custody in \nsealed covers for whatever reasons/cash in trunks/bins under the lock and key of any \nofficial/s other than the Joint Custodians or bearing a third l ock put by any official in \naddition to the two locks of the Joint Custodians is not eligible for being included in the chest balances. If such amounts are included in the chest balances, these will be treated as instances of wrong reporting and will attrac t penal interest at the rate specified in para \n3. \n2.3 In all the above cases  (excepting shortages in chest balances / remittances, \nshortages due to pilferage / frauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest balances / remittances),  penal interest will be levied from the date of inclusion of 'ineligible' \namounts in chest balances till the exclusion of such amounts from chest balances.   \nPenal measures for shortages in chest balances / remittances, shortages due to \npilferage / frauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest balances / remittances will be \ntaken on the basis of prevailing \u201c scheme of Penalties \u201d.  \n3. Rate of penal interest  \nPenal interest shall be levied at the rate of 2% over the prevailing Bank Rate for the period of delayed reporting/wrong reporting/non- reporting /inclusion of ineligible amounts \nin chest balances.  \n4. Levy of penal interest in respect of currency chests at treasuries \nThe above instructions shall be applicable to currency chests at treasury/sub- treasury \noffices also.  \n5. Representations \n5.1 As the sole criterion for levy of penal interest for delayed reporting is the number \nof days of delay, there should ordinarily be no occasion for banks to request for reconsideration of the Reserve Bank's decision in individual cases. However, \nrepresentations, if any, on account of genuine difficulties faced by chests especially in \nhilly/remote areas and those affected by natural calamities, etc., may be made to the Issue Office concerned through the Head / Controlling office of the bank concerned  \nwithin a month from the date of debit of the bank concerned.  \n5.2 In the case of wrong reporting representations for waiver will not be considered. \n{cf. para 1(e) above}.  \n5.3 As the intention behind the levy of penal interest is to inculcate discipline am ong \nbanks so as to ensure prompt/correct reporting, pleas by banks for waiver of penal \ninterest on grounds that delayed/wrong/non- reporting did not result in utilization of the \nReserve Bank's funds or shortfall in the maintenance of CRR/SLR or that they were the result of  clerical mistakes, unintentional or arithmetical errors, first time error, \ninexperience of staff etc., will not  be considered as valid grounds for waiver of penal \ninterest.   Further, we will take a serious view of all such lapses.   \n-------------------------  \n \n \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/MD59073FB085A702408996EAA31953818FFF.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 12, 2017", "info": " \nRBI/2017 -18/76 \nDCM (CC) No. G-3/03.44.01/ 2017 \u201318                        October  12, 2017  \n \nThe Chairman & Managing Director  \nChief Executive Officers   \nAll Banks  \n \n \nMaster Circular \u2013 Scheme of Penalties for bank branches based on performance in \nrendering customer service to the members of public  \n \nPlease ref er to the Circular DCM (CC) No. G-3/03.44 .01/2016 -17 dated July 20, 2016  on \nthe scheme of penalties . \n \n \n2.

Non-resident exporter / importer, or its central treasury approaches his banker \noverseas with appropriate documents with a request for hedging their Rupee exposure arising out of a confirmed import or export order invoiced in Rupees.  \n \nii. The overseas bank in turn approaches its correspondent in India (i.e. the AD bank in India) for a price to hedge the exposure of its customer along with documentation furnished by the customer that will enable the AD bank in India to satisfy itself that there is an underlying trade transaction (scanned copies would be acceptable). The following undertakings also need to be taken from the customer:  \n \na. That the same underlying exposure has not been hedged with any other AD Category I bank/s in India \nb. If the underlying exposure is cancelled, the customer will cancel  the hedge \ncontract immediately  \nc. In case of a central treasury, an  authorization from the entity having INR \nexposure to hedge on its behalf  \n \niii. A certification on the end client KYC may also be taken as a one- time document \nfrom the overseas bank by the AD bank  in India.  \n iv. The AD bank in India based on documents received from the overseas \ncorrespondent should satisfy itself about the existence of the underlying trade transaction and offer a forward price (no two- way quotes should be given) to the \noverseas bank who, in turn, will offer the same to its customer. The AD bank, therefore, will \u2018not be\u2019 dealing directly with the overseas importer / exporter.  \n \nv. The amount and tenor of the hedge should not exceed that of the underlying transaction and should be in consonance with the extant regulations regarding tenor of payment / realization of the proceeds.  \n \nvi. On due date, settlement is to be done through the correspondent bank\u2019s Vostro or the AD bank\u2019s Nostro accounts.  \n \nvii. The contracts, once cancelled, cannot be rebooked.  \n \nviii. The contracts may, however, be rolled over on or before maturity subject to maturity of the underlying exposure.  \n \nix. On cancellation of the contracts, gains may be passed on to the customer subject to the customer providing a declaration that he is not going to rebook the contract or that the contract has been cancelled on account of cancellation of the underlying exposure.  \n \nx. In case the underlying trade transaction is extended, rollover can be permitted once based on the extension of the underlying trade trans action for which \nsuitable documentation is to be provided by the overseas bank and the same \nprocedure followed as in case of the original contract.  \n \n \nModel II  \n \nNon-resident exporter / importer or its central treasury ( of the group and being a group \nentity)  dealing directly with the AD bank in India  \n \ni. The overseas exporter / importer or its central treasury approaches the AD bank \nin India with a request for forward cover in respect of underlying transaction for \nwhich he furnishes appropriate documentation (sc anned copies would be \nacceptable), on a pre- deal basis to enable the AD bank in India to satisfy itself \nthat there is an underlying trade transaction, and details of his overseas banker, address etc. The following undertakings also need to be taken from the customer  \n \na. That the same underlying exposure has not been hedged with any other AD Category I bank/s in India.  \nb. If the underlying exposure is cancelled, the customer will cancel the hedge contract immediately.  \nc. In case of a central treasury, an  authorization from the entity having INR \nexposure to hedge on its behalf   \nii. The AD bank may obtain certification of KYC/AML in the format in Annex XVIII. \nThe format can be obtained through the overseas correspondent / bank through SWIFT authenticated message. In case the AD bank has a presence outside India, the AD may take care of the KYC/AML through its bank\u2019s offshore branch.  \n \niii. AD banks should evolve appropriate arrangements to mitigate credit risk. Credit limits can be granted based on the credit analysis  done by self / the overseas \nbranch.  \n \niv. The amount and tenor of the hedge should not exceed that of the underlying transaction and should be in consonance with the extant regulations regarding tenor of payment / realization of the proceeds.  \n \nv. On due date, set tlement is to be done through the correspondent bank\u2019s Vostro \nor the AD bank\u2019s Nostro accounts. AD banks in India may release funds to the beneficiaries only after sighting funds in Nostro / Vostro accounts.  \n \nvi. The contracts, once cancelled, cannot be rebooked.  \n \nvii. The contracts may, however, be rolled over on or before maturity subject to maturity of the underlying exposure.  \n \nviii. On cancellation of the contracts, gains may be passed on to the customer subject to the customer providing a declaration that he is  not going to rebook the \ncontract or that the contract has been cancelled on account of cancellation of the \nunderlying exposure.  \n \nix. In case the underlying trade transaction is extended, rollover can be permitted once based on the extension of the underlying trade transaction for which suitable documentation is to be provided by the overseas bank and the same procedure followed as in case of the original contract.  \n \nx. AD banks shall report hedge contracts booked under this facility to CCIL\u2019 s trade \nrepository with a special identification tag.

Introduction \n1.1 'Outsourcing' is defined as the NBFC\u2019s use of a third party (either an affiliated entity \nwithin a corporate group or an entity that is external to the corporate group) to perform \nactivities on a continuing basis that would normally be undertaken by the NBFC itself, now \nor in the future.  \n\u2018Continuing basis' includes agreements for a limited period.  \n1.2 NBFCs have been outsourcing various activities and are hence exposed to various \nrisks as detailed in para 5.3. Further, the outsourced activities are to be brought within \nregulatory purview to a) protect the interest of the customers of NBFCs and b) to ensure \nthat the NBFC concerned and the Reserve Bank of India have access to all relevant \nbooks, records and information available with service provider. Typically outsourced \nfinancial services include applications processing (loan origination, credit card), document \nprocessing, marketing and research, supervision of loans, data processing and back office related activities, besides others.  \n1.3 Some key risks in outsourcing are Strategic Risk, Re putation Risk, Compliance \nRisk, Operational Risk, Legal Risk, Exit Strategy Risk, Counterparty Risk, Country Risk, \nContractual Risk, Access Risk, Concentration and Systemic Risk. The failure of a service \nprovider in providing a specified service, a breach in security/ confidentiality, or non-\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements by the service provider can lead to \nfinancial losses or loss of reputation for the NBFC and could also lead to systemic risks.  \n1.4    It is therefore imperative for the NBFC outsourcing its activities to ensure sound and \nresponsive risk management practices for effective oversight, due diligence and \nmanagement of risks arising from such outsourced activities. The directions are applicable \nto material outsourcing arrangem ents as explained in para 3 which may be entered into by \nan NBFC with a service provider located in India or elsewhere. The service provider may \neither be a member of the group/ conglomerate to which the NBFC belongs, or an \nunrelated party.  \n1.5    The underlying principles behind these directions  are that the regulated entity shall \nensure that outsourcing arrangements neither diminish its ability to fulfil its obligations to \ncustomers and RBI nor impede effective supervision by RBI. NBFCs, therefore, have to \ntake steps to ensure that the service provider employs the same high standard of care in \nperforming the services as is expected to be employed by the NBFCs, if the activities were conducted within the NBFCs and not outsourced. Accordingly, NBFCs shall not engage in \noutsourcing that would result in their internal control, business conduct or reputation being \ncompromised or weakened. 27 1.6 (i)   These directions  are concerned with managing risks in outsourcing of financial \nservices and are  not  applicable  to  technology -related  issues and activities  not  related  \nto  financial services, such as  usage of courier, catering of staff, housekeeping and \njanitorial  services,  security  of  the premises, movement and archiving of records, etc.  \nNBFCs which desire to outsource financial services would not require prior approval from \nRBI. However, such arrangements would be subject to on -site/ off- site monitoring and \ninspection/ scrutiny by RBI. \n(ii)    In regard to outsourced services relating to credit cards, RBI' s detailed instructions \ncontained in its circular on credit card activities vide DBOD.FSD.BC.49/24.01.011/2005-06 \ndated November 21, 2005  w ould be applicable.  \n \n2.        Activities that shall not be outsourced \nNBFCs which choose to outsource financial services shall, however, not outsource core \nmanagement functions including Internal Audit, Strategic and Compliance functions and  \ndecision-making functions such as determining compliance with KYC norms for opening \ndeposit accounts, according sanction for loans (including retail loans) and management of \ninvestment portfolio. However, for NBFCs in a group/conglomerate, these functions may be \noutsourced within the group subject to compliance with instructions in Para 6.Further, w hile \ninternal audit function itself is a management process, the internal auditors can be on \ncontract.  \n \n3. Material Outsourcing \nFor the purpose of these directions, material outsourcing arrangements are those which, if  \ndisrupted, have the potential to significantly impact the business operations, reputation, \nprofitability or customer service. Materiality of outsourcing would be based on: \n\u2022 the level of importance to the NBFC of the activity  being outsourced as well as the \nsignificance of the risk posed by the same; \n\u2022 the potential  impact of the outsourcing on the NBFC  on various  parameters  such  as \nearnings, solvency,  liquidity, funding capital  and risk profile;  \n\u2022 the  likely   impact  on  the  NBFC\u2019s   reputation  and  brand  value,  and  ability   to  \nachieve  its business  objectives, strategy  and plans, should the service  provider fail \nto perform  the service;  \n\u2022 the cost of the outsourcing as a proportion of total operating costs  of the NBFC;  \n\u2022 the aggregate exposure to that particular service  provider, in cases  where the \nNBFC outsources  various  functions  to the same  service  provider and \n\u2022 the significance of activities  outsourced in context of customer service  and \nprotection.  28 4.        NBFC's role and Regulatory and Supe rvisory Requirements  \n4.1    The outsourcing of any activity by NBFC does not diminish its obligations, and those \nof its Board and senior management, who have the ultimate responsibility for the \noutsourced activity. NBFCs would therefore be responsible for the actions of their service \nprovider including Direct Sales Agents/ Direct Marketing Agents and recovery agents and \nthe confidentiality of information pertaining to the customers that is available with the \nservice provider. NBFCs shall retain ultimate control of the outsourced activity.  \n4.2    It is imperative for the NBFC, when performing its due diligence in relation to \noutsourcing, to consider all relevant laws, regulations, guidelines and conditions of \napproval, licensing or registration.  \n4.3    Outsourcing arrangements shall  not affect the rights of a customer against the NBFC, \nincluding the ability of the customer to obtain redress as applicable under relevant laws. In \ncases where the customers are required to deal with the service providers in the process of \ndealing with the NBFC, NBFCs shall incorporate a clause in the relative product literature/ brochures, etc., stating that they may use the services of agents in sales/ marketing etc. of the products. The role of agents may be indicated in broad terms.  \n4.4    The service provider shall not impede or interfere with the ability of the NBFC to \neffectively oversee and manage its activities nor shall  it impede the Reserve Bank of India \nin carrying out its supervisory functions and objectives. \n4.5    NBFCs need to have a robust grievance redress mechanism, which in no way shall  \nbe compromised on account of outsourcing. \n4.6 The service provider, if not a group company of the NBFC,  shall not be owned or \ncontrolled by any director of the NBFC or their relatives; these terms have the same \nmeaning as assigned under Companies Act, 2013. \n \n5.        Risk Management practices for Outsourced Financial Services 5.1    Outsourcing Policy  \nAn NBFC intending to outsource any of its financial activities shall put in place a \ncomprehensive outsourcing policy, approved by its Board, which incorporates, inter alia, \ncriteria for selection of such activities as well as service providers, delegation of authority \ndepending on risks and materiality and systems to monitor and review the operations of \nthese activities. \n5.2    Role of the Board and Senior Management  \n5.2.1   Role of the Board \nThe Board of the NBFC, or a Committee of the Board to which powers have been \ndelegated shall be responsible inter alia for the following:  \ni. approving a framework to evaluate the risks and materiality of all existing and \nprospective outsourcing and the policies that apply to such arrangements;  29 ii. laying down appropriate approval authorities for outsourcing depending on risks \nand materiality; \niii.    setting up suitable administrative framework of senior management for the purpose \nof these directions;  \niv. undertaking regular review of outsourcing strategies and arrangements for their \ncontinued relevance, and safety and soundness and \nv. deciding on business activities of a material nature to be outsourced, and approving \nsuch arrangements. \n \n5.2.2    Responsibilities of the Senior Management  \ni. Evaluating the risks and materiality of all existing and prospective outsourcing, \nbased on the framework  approved by the Board;  \nii. developing and implementing sound and prudent outsourcing policies and \nprocedures commensurate with the nature, scope and complexity of the outsourcing \nactivity; \niii. reviewing periodically the effectiveness of policies and proc edures;  \niv. communicating information pertaining to material outsourcing risks to the Board in a \ntimely manner; \nv. ensuring that contingency plans, based on realistic and probable disruptive \nscenarios, are in place and tested;  \nvi. ensuring that there is independent review and audit for compliance with set policies \nand \nvii. undertaking periodic review of outsourcing arrangements to identify new material \noutsourcing risks as they arise.  \n \n5.3    Evaluation of the Risks \nThe NBFCs shall evaluate and guard agains t the following risks in outsourcing:  \ni. Strategic Risk \u2013  Where the service provider conducts business on its own behalf, \ninconsistent with the overall strategic goals of the NBFC.  \nii. Reputation Risk \u2013 Where the service provided is poor and customer interaction is \nnot consistent with the overall standards expected of the NBFC. \niii. Compliance Risk \u2013  Where privacy, consumer and prudential laws are not \nadequately complied with by the service provider. \niv. Operational Risk - Arising out of technology fail ure, fraud, error, inadequate \nfinancial capacity to fulfil obligations and/ or to provide remedies.  \nv. Legal Risk \u2013 Where the NBFC is subjected to fines, penalties, or punitive \ndamages resulting from supervisory actions, as well as private settlements due to \nomissions and commissions of the service provider.  30 vi. Exit Strategy Risk \u2013 Where the NBFC is over -reliant on one firm, the loss of \nrelevant skills in the NBFC itself preventing it from bringing the activity back in-\nhouse and where NBFC has entered into contracts that make speedy exits \nprohibitively expensive. \nvii. Counter party Risk \u2013  Where there is inappropriate underwriting or credit \nassessments.  \nviii. Contractual Risk \u2013  Where the NBFC may not have the ability to enforce the \ncontract.  \nix. Concentration and Systemic Risk \u2013  Where the overall industry has considerable \nexposure to one service provider and hence the NBFC may lack control over the service provider.  \nx.       Country Risk \u2013  Due to the political, social or legal climate creating added risk.  \n5.4    Evaluating the Capability of the Service Provider  \n5.4.1    In considering or renewing an outsourcing arrangement, appropriate due diligence \nshall be performed to assess the capability of the service provider to comply with \nobligations in the outsourci ng agreement. Due diligence shall take into consideration \nqualitative and quantitative, financial, operational and reputational factors. NBFCs shall \nconsider whether the service providers' systems are compatible with their own and also \nwhether their standa rds of performance including in the area of customer service are \nacceptable to it. NBFCs shall also consider, while evaluating the capability of the service \nprovider, issues relating to undue concentration of outsourcing arrangements with a single \nservice provider. Where possible, the NBFC shall obtain independent reviews and market \nfeedback on the service provider to supplement its own findings. \n5.4.2    Due diligence shall involve an evaluation of all available information about the \nservice provider, incl uding but not limited to the following:  \ni. past experience and competence to implement and support the proposed activity over the contracted period;  \nii. financial soundness and ability to service commitments even under adverse \nconditions;  \niii. business reputation and culture, compliance, complaints and outstanding or potential litigation;  \niv. security and internal control, audit coverage, reporting and monitoring environment, \nbusiness continuity management and \nv. ensuring due diligence by service provider of its employees. \n5.5    The Outsourcing Agreement  \nThe terms and conditions governing the contract between the NBFC and the service \nprovider shall be carefully defined in written agreements and vetted by NBFC's legal \ncounsel on their legal effect and enfor ceability. Every such agreement shall address the 31 risks and risk mitigation strategies. The agreement shall be sufficiently flexible to allow the \nNBFC to retain an appropriate level of control over the outsourcing and the right to \nintervene with appropriat e measures to meet legal and regulatory obligations. The \nagreement shall also bring out the nature of legal relationship between the parties - i.e. \nwhether agent, principal or otherwise. Some of the key provisions of the contract shall be \nthe following:  \ni. the contract shall  clearly define what activities are going to be outsourced including \nappropriate service and performance standards;  \nii. the NBFC must ensure it has the ability to access all books, records and information \nrelevant to the outsourced acti vity available with the service provider; \niii. the contract shall  provide for continuous monitoring and assessment by the NBFC of \nthe service provider so that any necessary corrective measure can be taken \nimmediately; \niv. a termination clause and minimum p eriod to execute a termination provision, if \ndeemed necessary, shall  be included; \nv. controls to ensure customer data confidentiality and service providers' liability in case of breach of security and leakage of confidential customer related information shall  be \nincorporated; \nvi. there must be contingency plans to ensure business continuity; \nvii. the contract shall  provide for the prior approval / consent by the NBFC of the use of \nsubcontractors by the service provider for all or part of an outsourced activi ty; \nviii. it shall  provide the NBFC with the right to conduct audits on the service provider \nwhether by its internal or external auditors, or by agents appointed to act on its behalf and to obtain copies of any audit or review reports and findings made on the service \nprovider in conjunction with the services performed for the NBFC;  \nix. outsourcing agreements shall  include clauses to allow the Reserve Bank of India or \npersons authorised by it to access the NBFC's documents, records of transactions, \nand other  necessary information given to, stored or processed by the service provider \nwithin a reasonable time; \nx. outsourcing agreement shall  also include a clause to recognise the right of the \nReserve Bank to cause an inspection to be made of a service provider o f an NBFC \nand its books and account by one or more of its officers or employees or other \npersons;  \nxi. the outsourcing agreement shall  also provide that confidentiality of customer's \ninformation shall  be maintained even after the contract expires or gets te rminated and \nxii. the NBFC shall  have necessary provisions to ensure that the service provider \npreserves documents as required by law and take suitable steps to ensure that its \ninterests are protected in this regard even post termination of the services.  32  \n5.6    Confidentiality and Security  \n5.6.1    Public confidence and customer trust in the NBFC is a prerequisite for the stability \nand reputation of the NBFC. Hence the NBFC shall  seek to ensure the preservation and \nprotection of the security and confident iality of customer information in the custody or \npossession of the service provider. \n5.6.2    Access to customer information by staff of the service provider shall  be on 'need to \nknow' basis i.e., limited to those areas where the information is required in  order to perform \nthe outsourced function.  \n5.6.3    The NBFC shall  ensure that the service provider is able to isolate and clearly \nidentify the NBFC's customer information, documents, records and assets to protect the \nconfidentiality of the information. In instances, where service provider acts as an \noutsourcing agent for multiple NBFCs, care shall  be taken to build strong safeguards so \nthat there is no comingling of information / documents, records and assets. \n5.6.4    The NBFC shall  review and monitor the security practices and control processes of \nthe service provider on a regular basis and require the service provider to disclose security \nbreaches.  \n5.6.5    The NBFC shall  immediately notify RBI in the event of any breach of security and \nleakage of confid ential customer related information. In these eventualities, the NBFC \nwould be liable to its customers for any damages. \n \n5.7    Responsibilities of Direct Sales Agents (DSA) / Direct Marketing Agents (DMA) / \nRecovery Agents \n5.7.1    NBFCs shall  ensure that the DSA / DMA/ Recovery Agents are properly trained to \nhandle their responsibilities with care and sensitivity, particularly aspects such as soliciting \ncustomers, hours of calling, privacy of customer information and conveying the correct \nterms  and conditions of the products on offer, etc. \n5.7.2    NBFCs shall  put in place a board approved Code of conduct for DSA/ DMA/ \nRecovery Agents, and obtain their undertaking to abide by the code. In addition, Recovery \nAgents shall  adhere to extant instructions on Fair Practices Code for NBFCs as also their \nown code for collection of dues and repossession of security. It is essential that the \nRecovery Agents refrain from action that could damage the integrity and reputation of the \nNBFC and that they observe strict customer confidentiality.  \n5.7.3    The NBFC and their agents shall not resort to intimidation or harassment of any \nkind, either verbal or physical, against any person in their debt collection efforts, including \nacts intended to humiliate publicly or  intrude upon the privacy of the debto rs' family \nmembers, referees and friends, sending inappropriate messages either on mobile or 33 through social media , making threatening and /or anonymous calls,  persistently7 calling the \nborrower and/ or calling the borrower before 8:00 a.m. and after 7:00 p.m. for recovery of \noverdue loans, making false and misleading representations, etc. Any violation in this \nregard will be viewed seriously8. \n \n5.8    Business Continuity and Management of Disaster Recovery Plan \n5.8.1   An NBFC shall  require its service providers to develop and establish a robust \nframework for documenting, maintaining and testing business continuity and recovery \nprocedures. NBFCs need to ensure that the service provider periodically tests the \nBusiness Continuity and Recovery Plan and may also consider occasional joint testing and \nrecovery exercises with its service provider. \n5.8.2   In order to mitigate the risk of unexpected termination of the outsourcing agreement or liquidation of the service provider, NBFCs shall  \nretain an appropriate level of control \nover their outsourcing and the right to intervene with appropriate measures to continue its \nbusiness operations in such cases without incurring prohibitive expenses and without any \nbreak in the operations of the NBFC and its services to the customers. \n5.8.3    In establishing a viable contingency plan, NBFCs shall  consider the availability of \nalternative service providers or the possibility of bringing the outsourced activity back in-house in an emergency and the costs, time and resources that would be involved.  \n5.8.4    Outsourcing often leads to the sharing of facilities operated by the service provider. The NBFC shall  \nensure that service providers are able to isolate the NBFC's information, \ndocuments and records, and other assets. This is to ensure that in appropriate situations, \nall documents, records of transactions and information given to the service provider, and \nassets of the NBFC, can be removed from the possession of the service provider in order to continue its business operations, or deleted, destroyed or rendered unusable.  \n \n5.9    Monitoring and Control of Outsourced Activities \n5.9.1    The NBFC shall  have in place a management structure to monitor and control its \noutsourcing activities. It shall  ensure that outsourcing agreements with the service provider \ncontain provisions to address their monitoring and control of outsourced activities.  \n5.9.2    A central record of all material outsourcing that is readily accessible for review by \nthe Board and senior management of the NBFC shall  be maintained. The records shall  be \nupdated promptly and half yearly reviews shall  be placed before the Board or Risk \nManagement Committee. \n5.9.3    Regular audits by either the internal auditors or external auditors of the NBFC shall  \nassess the adequacy of the risk management practices adopted in overseeing and \n                                                            \n7 For example- calling repeatedly  \n8 Inserted vide circular DOR.ORG.REC.65/21.04.158/2022-23 dated August 12, 2022.  34 managing the outsourcing arrangement, the NBFC's compliance with its risk management \nframework and the requirements of these directions. \n \n5.9.4    NBFCs shall  at least on an annual basis, review the financial and operational \ncondition of the service provider to assess its ability to continue to meet its outsourcing \nobligations. Such due diligence reviews, which can be based on all available information \nabout the service provider shall highlight any deterioration or breach in performance \nstandards, confidentiality and security, and in business continuity preparedness.  \n5.9.5    In the event of termination of the outsourcing agreement for any reason in cases \nwhere the service provider deals with the customers, the same shall  be publicized by \ndisplaying at a prominent place in the branch, posting it on the web-site, and informing the \ncustomers  so as to ensure that the customers do not continue to deal with the service \nprovider. \n5.9.6 Certain cases, like outsourcing of cash management, might involve reconciliation of \ntransactions between the NBFC, the service provider and its sub- contractors. In such \ncases, NBFCs shall ensure that reconciliation of transactions between t he NBFC and the \nservice provider (and/ or its sub-contractor), are carried out in a timely manner. An ageing \nanalysis of entries pending reconciliation with outsourced vendors shall be placed before \nthe Audit Committee of the Board (ACB) and NBFCs  shall ma ke efforts to reduce the old \noutstanding items therein at the earliest.  \n5.9.7 A robust system of internal audit of all outsourced activities shall also be put in place \nand monitored by the ACB of the NBFC.  \n 5.10 Redress of Grievances related to Outsourced Services \ni. NBFCs shall  constitute Grievance Redressal Machinery as contained in RBI\u2019s \ncircular on Grievance Redressal Mechanism vide DNBS.CC.PD.No.320/03.10.01/2012-\n13 dated February 18, 2013 . At the operational level, all NBFCs shall  di splay the name \nand contact details (Telephone / Mobile nos. as also email address) of the Grievance \nRedressal Officer prominently  at their branches / places where business is transacted. \nThe designated officer shall  ensure that genuine grievances of customers are redressed \npromptly without involving delay. It shall  be clearly indicated that NBFCs' Grievance \nRedressal Machinery will also deal with the issue relating to services provided by the \noutsourced agency. \nii. Generally, a time limit of 30 days may be given to the customers for preferring their \ncomplaints / grievances. The grievance redressal procedure of the NBFC and the time \nframe fixed for responding to the complaints shall  be placed on the NBFC's website.  \n \n 35 5.11    Reporting of transactions to FIU or other competent authorities  \nNBFCs would be responsible for making Currency Transactions Reports and Suspicious \nTransactions Reports to FIU or any other competent authority in respect of the NBFCs' \ncustomer related activities carried out by the service providers. \n6.        Outsourcing within a Group/ Conglomerate \n6.1 In a group structure, NBFCs may have back -office and service arrangements / \nagreements with group entities e.g. sharing of pr emises, legal and other professional \nservices, hardware and software applications, centralize back -office functions, outsourcing \ncertain financial services to other group entities, etc. Before entering into such \narrangements with group entities, NBFCs shal l have a Board approved policy and also \nservice level agreements/arrangements with their group entities, which shall also cover \ndemarcation of sharing resources i.e. premises, personnel, etc. Moreover the customers \nshall be informed specifically about the company which is actually offering the \nproduct/service, wherever there are multiple group entities involved or any cross selling \nobserved. \n6.2 While entering into such arrangements, NBFCs shall ensure that these:  \na. are appropriately documented in written agreements with details like scope of services, \ncharges for the services and maintaining confidentiality of the customer's data;  \nb. do not lead to any confusion to the customers on whose products/services they are \navailing by clear physical demarcation of the space where the activities of the NBFC and \nthose of its other group entities are undertaken;  \nc. do not compromise the ability to identify and manage risk of the NBFC on a stand-\nalone basis;  \nd. do not prevent the RBI from being able to obtain informati on required for the \nsupervision of the NBFC or pertaining to the group as a whole; and  \ne. incorporate a clause under the written agreements that there is a clear obligation for \nany service provider to comply with directions given by the RBI in relation to the activities \nof the NBFC. \n6.3 NBFCs  shall ensure that their ability to carry out their operations in a sound fashion \nwould not be affected if premises or other services (such as IT systems, support staff) \nprovided by the group entities become unavailable.  \n6.4 If the premises of the NBFC are shared with the group entities for the purpose of \ncross-selling, NBFCs shall  take measures to ensure that the entity's identification is \ndistinctly visible and clear to the customers. The marketing brochure used by the group \nentity and verbal communication by its staff / agent in the NBFCs premises shall  mention \nnature of arrangement of the entity with the NBFC so that the customers are clear on the \nseller of the product.  \n6.5 NBFCs shall not publish any advertisement or  enter into any agreement stating or 36 suggesting or giving tacit impression that they are in any way responsible for the \nobligations of its group entities.  \n6.6 The risk management practices expected to be adopted by an NBFC while \noutsourcing to a related pa rty (i.e. party within the Group / Conglomerate) would be \nidentical to those specified in Para 5 of this directions.  \n \n7. Off-shore outsourcing of Financial Services \n7.1 The engagement of service providers in a foreign country exposes an NBFC to \ncountry ris k -economic, social and political conditions and events in a foreign country that  \nmay  adversely affect the NBFC. Such conditions and events could prevent the service \nprovider from carrying out the terms of its agreement with the NBFC.  To manage the  \ncountry  risk  involved  in  such outsourcing  activities,  the  NBFC  shall  take  into  account  \nand closely  monitor  government policies  and  political,  social,  economic  and  legal  \nconditions  in  countries  where  the  service provider is based, both during the risk \nassessment process and on a continuous basis, and establish sound  procedures  for  \ndealing  with  country  risk  problems. This includes having appropriate contingency and \nexit strategies. In principle, arrangements shall  only be entered into with parties operating \nin jurisdictions generally upholding confidentiality clauses and agreements. The governing \nlaw of the arrangement shall  also be clearly specified. \n \n7.2 The activities outsourced outside India shall  be conducted in a manner so as  not to \nhinder efforts to supervise or reconstruct the India activities of the NBFC in a timely \nmanner.  \n7.3 As regards the off- shore outsourcing of financial services relating to Indian \nOperations, NBFCs shall  additionally ensure that  \na) Where the off-shore service provider is a regulated entity, the relevant off-shore \nregulator will neither obstruct the arrangement nor object to RBI inspection visits/ visits  of \nNBFCs internal and external auditors. \nb) The availability of records to management and the RBI will withstand the liquidation of either the offshore custodian or the NBFC in India. \nc) The regulatory authority of the offshore location does not have access to the data \nrelating to Indian operations of the NBFC simply on the ground that the proce ssing is \nbeing undertaken there (not applicable if off shore processing is done in the home  \ncountry of the NBFC).  \nd) The jurisdiction of the courts in the off shore location where data is maintained does \nnot extend to the operations of the NBFC in India on the strength of the fact that the data \nis being processed there even though the actual transactions are undertaken in India and \ne) All original  records  continue  to be maintained  in India.  37  \n \n          Annex VII \n \nOmbudsman Scheme for Non -Banking Financial Companies, 2018 - Appointment of \nthe Nodal Officer/Principal Nodal Officer   \n \nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has brought into operation on February 23, 2018, the \nOmbudsman Scheme for Non-Banking Financial Companies, 2018  (The Scheme).

BC.No.29/05.02.001/2016- 17 dated May 25, \n2017  conveying continuation of Interest Subvention Scheme on the interim basis.  In this \nregard, it is advised that Government of India has approved the implementation of the \nInterest Subvention Scheme for the year 2017 -18 for short term crop loans up to \u20b9 3.00 \nlakhs with the following stipulations:  \ni. In order to provi de short -term crop loans upto \u20b9 3 lakh t o farmers at an interest \nrate of 7% p.a. during the year 2017- 18, it has been decided to offer interest \nsubvention of 2% per annum to lending institutions viz. Public Sector Banks \n(PSBs), Private Sector Commercial Banks (in respect of loans given by their  rural \nand semi -urban branches only) on use of their own resources. This interest \nsubvention of 2% will be calculated on the crop loan amount from the date of its \ndisbursement/ drawal up to the date of actual repayment of the crop loan by the  \nfarmer or up to the due date of the loan fixed by the banks whichever is earlier, \nsubject to a maximum period of one year.  \n \n ii. To provide an addi tional interest subvention of 3% per annum to such of those \nfarmers repaying in time i .e. from the date of disburs ement of the crop loan upto \nthe actual date of repayment by farmers or upto the due date fixed by the bank s \nfor repayment of crop loan, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of \none year from the date of disbursement. This also implies that the farmers paying \npromptly  as above would get short term crop loans @ 4% per annum during the \nyear 2017- 18.  \niii. In order to discourage distress sale and to encourage them to store their produce \nin warehouses, the benefit of interest subvention will be available to small and \nmarginal farmers having Kisan Credit Card for a further period of upto six \nmonths post the harvest of the crop at the same rate as available to crop loan \nagainst negotiable warehouse receipts issued on the produce stored in \nwarehouses accredit ed with Warehousing Development Regulatory Authority \n(WDRA).  \niv. To provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, an interest subvention \nof 2 percent per annum will be made available to banks for the first year on the \nrestructured loan amount. Such  restructured loans will attract normal rate of \ninterest from the second year onwards.  \nv. To avoid multiple loaning and to ensure that only genuine farmers avail \nconcessional crop loan through the mechanism of gold loans, the lending \ninstitutions may conduct due diligence and ensure proper documentation \nincluding recording of land details even when the farmer avails gold loans for \nsuch purposes.  \nvi. To ensure hassle- free benefits to farmers under Interest Subvention \nScheme, the banks  are advised to make Aadhar  linkage mandatory for \navailing short -term crop loans in 2017- 18. \n \n2. All lending banks are requested to send to us the eligible pending audited claims of \n2015- 16 latest by August 31, 2017 as already advised vide our email dated August 11, \n2017. Please not e that under no circumstances further extension will be  granted in this \nregard. The claims for 2016- 17 may also be submitted within the time limit as per  \nprocedure laid dow n and contained in our circular RBI/2016- 17/32 \nFIDD.CO.FSD.BC.No.9/05.02.001/2016- 17 dated August 4 , 2016 . \n   \n  \n \n3.

It has been observed in a review of the appointment of statutory auditors in private \nsector/foreign banks that, in some cases, the same audit firm was reappointed after \na gap of two years\u2019 rest. In a few other private sector /foreign banks, the immediately \npreceding statutory auditor firm was appointed on completion of the four year tenure of the current statutory auditor. The statutory central audit responsibility in such \nbanks thus remained confined to two audit firms which were appointed on a cyclical \nbasis.  \n3. The Rest and Rotation Policy in appointment of SCAs for banks has been mandated in order that audit functions are looked at afresh, as a new team is likely to \nexamine the issues in a bank from a different perspective.  The policy also aims to \ndeter the  auditors and auditee from establishing a comfortable relationship that may \nlead to compromise in strict adherence to audit principles.  \n \n\u092c\ufffd\ufffd\u0915\u0917 \u092a\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\ufffd\u0923 \ufffd\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915 \ufffd\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f , \u0935\u0932\u094d\u0921\u0930\u094d \u091f\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0921 \u0938\u0947\u0928\u094d\u091f\u0930 , \u0938\u0947\u0928\u094d\u091f\u0930  1, \u0915\u092b \u092a\u0930\u0947\u0921 ,\u0915\u094b\u0932\u093e\u092c\u093e \u092e\u0941\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0908  400005 \n\u091f\u0947\ufffd\u0932\u092b\u094b\u0928 022 22180157  e- mail-  cgmicdbsco@rbi.org.in  \nDepartment of   Banking Supervision, Central Office, World Trade Centre 1,Cuffe Parade, Colaba, Mumbai  - 400 \n005, INDIA  \nTele: (9122) 22189131 Fax: 022 22180157 e- mail: cgmicdbsco@rbi.org.in  \n\ufffd\u0939\u0902\u0926\ufffd \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948 , \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u0922\u093e\u0907\u090f   \n \n4.

Banks \nare advised to review and tune their existing lending policies to the MSE sector by incorporating therein the  following provisions so as to facilitate timely and adequate availability \nof credit to viable MSE borrowers especially during the need of funds in unforeseen \ncircumstances: \ni) To extend standby credit facility in case of term loans  \nii) Additional working capital to meet with emergent needs of MSE units  \niii) Mid-term review of the regular working capital limits, where banks are convinced that \nchanges in the demand pattern of MSE borrowers require increasing the existing \ncredit limits of the MSMEs, every year based on the actual sales of the previous year.  \niv) Timelines for Credit Decisions  \n4.6 Debt Restructuring Mechanism for MSMEs  \ni) Banks are advised to follow the guidelines/instructions on debt restructuring pertaining to MSMEs contained in the \u2018\nMaster Circular - Prudential norms on Income \nRecognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances \u2019 as \nupdated from time to time.  \nii) All commercial banks are also advised in terms of our circular \nRPCD.SME&NFS.BC.No.102/06.04.01/2008-09 dated May 4, 2009  to do th e \nfollowing:  \na) put in place loan policies governing extension of c redit facilities, \nRestructuring/Rehabilitation policy for revival of potentially viable sick units / enterprises (now read with guidelines on \nFramework for Revival and \nRehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises issued on March 17, 2016 ) \nand non- discretionary One Time Settlement scheme for recovery of non - \nperforming loans for the MSE sector, with the approval of the Board of Directors \nand \nb) give wide publicity to the One-Time  settlement scheme implemented by them, by \nplacing it on the bank\u2019s website and through other possible modes of \ndissemination. They may allow reasonable time to the borrowers to submit the 5 \n application and also make payment of the dues in order to extend the benefits of \nthe scheme to eligible borrowers. \nc) implement recommendations with regard to timely and adequate flow of credit to \nthe MSE sector. \n4.7 Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of MSMEs  \nThe Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India, vide their Gazette Notification dated May 29, 2015 had notified a \u2018Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of \nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises\u2019 to provide a simpler and faster mechanism to address the stress in the accounts of MSMEs and to facilitate the promotion and development of MSMEs. After carrying out certain changes in the captioned Framework in consultation with \nthe Government of India, Ministry of MSME so as to make it compatible with the existing \nregulatory guidelines on \u2018Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining \nto Advances\u2019 issued to banks by RBI, the guidelines on the captioned Framework along with operating instructions were issued to banks on March 17, 2016. The revival and rehabilitation of MSME units having loan limits up to \u20b925 crore would be undertaken under this Framework. \nThe revised Framework supersedes our earlier Guidelines on Rehabilitation of Sick Micro and Small Enterprises issued vide our \ncircular RPCD.CO.MSME& NFS.BC.40/06.02.31/2012-\n2013 dated November 1, 2012 , except those relating to Reliefs and Concessions for \nRehabilitation of Potentially Viable Units and One Time Settlement, mentioned in the said \ncircular. \nThe salient features of the Framework are as under: \ni) Before a loan account of an MSME turns into a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), banks or creditors should identify incipient stress in the account by creating three sub-categories under the Special Mention Account (SMA) category as given in the Framework  \nii) Any MSME borrower may also voluntarily initiate proceedings under this Framework  \niii) Committee approach to be adopted for deciding corrective action plan  \niv) Timelines have been fixed for taking various decisions under the Framework  \n4.8 Structured Mechanism for monitoring the credit growth to the MSE sector  \nIn view of the concerns emerging from the deceleration in credit growth to the MSE sector, an Indian Banking Association (IBA) -led Sub-Committ ee (Chairman: Shri K.R. Kamath) was set \nup to suggest a structured mechanism to be put in place by banks to monitor the entire gamut of credit related issues pertaining to the sector. Based on the recommendations of the \nCommittee, banks are advised to: 6 \n \u2022 strengthen their existing systems of monitoring credit growth to the sector and put in \nplace a system -driven comprehensive performance management information system \n(MIS) at every supervisory level (branch, region, zone, head office) which should be \ncritically evaluated on a regular basis; \n\u2022 put in place a system of e-tracking of MSE loan applications and monitor the loan \napplication disposal process in banks, giving branch-wise, region-wise, zone-wise and \nState-wise positions. The position in this regard is to be displayed by banks on their websites.  \nDetailed guidelines were issued to the scheduled commercial banks vide our \ncircular RPCD. \nMSME&NFS.BC.No.74/06.02.31/2012-13 dated May 9, 2013 . \nChapter - V \n5 Institutional arrangements \n5.1 Specialised MSME branches \nPublic sector banks are advised to open at least one specialised branch in each district. \nFurther, banks have been permitted to categorise their general banking branches having 60% or more of their advances to MSME sector as specialized MSME branches in order to \nencourage them to open more specialised MSME branches for providing better service to this \nsector as a whole. As per the policy package announced by the Government of India for stepping up credit to MSME sector, the public sector banks would ensure specialized MSME branches in identified clusters/centres with preponderance of small enterprises to enable the \nentrepreneurs to have easy access to the bank credit and to equip bank personnel to develop \nrequisite expertise. Though their core competence will be utilized for extending finance and other services to MSME sector, they will have operational flexibility to extend finance/render other services to other sectors/borrowers. Banks may take care to train the officials posted in \nsuch branches appropriately. \n5.2 Empowered Committee on MSMEs  \nAs part of the announcement made by the Union Finance Minister, Empowered Committees \non MSMEs are constituted at the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India, under the Chairmanship of the Regional Directors with the representatives of SLBC Convenor, senior level officers from two banks having predominant share in MSME financing in the state, representative of SIDBI Regional Office, the Director of MSME or Industries of the State \nGovernment, one or two senior level representatives from the MSME Associations in the state, and a senior level officer from SFC/SIDC as members. The Committee would meet periodically and review the progress in MSME financing as also revival and rehabilitation of stressed Micro, 7 \n Small and Medium units. It would also coordinate with other banks/financial institutions and \nthe state government in removing bottlenecks, if any, to ensure smooth flow of credit to the sector. The committees may decide the need to have similar committees at cluster/district \nlevels. \n5.3 Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) \nBCSBI in collaboration with the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), Reserve Bank of India (RBI) \nand member banks had evolved the \u2018Code of Bank's Commitment to Micro and Small \nEnterprises\u2019 - which set minimum standards of banking practices for member banks to follow \nwhen they are dealing with Micro and Small Enterprises. The objective of the Code is to promote good banking practices, setting minimum standards for the adherents, increasing \ntransparency, achieving higher operating standards and above all, promoting a cordial banker -\ncustomer relationship which would foster confidence in the banking system. The Code lays \ngreat emphasis on transparency and providing full information to the customer before a product or service is sold to him/her. Above all, member banks of BCSBI have voluntarily adopted the Code for implementation. While BCSBI has initiated the process of its dissolution, \nbanks may continue to follow their commitments as hitherto under the Code of Bank's \nCommitment to Micro and Small Enterprises.  \n5.4 Micro and Small Enterprises Sector \u2013 The imperative of Financial Literacy and \nconsultancy support  \nKeeping in view the high extent of financial exclusion in the MSME sector, it is imperative for \nbanks that the excluded units are brought within the fold of the formal banking sector. The lack of financial literacy, operational skills, including accounting and finance, business planning etc. \nrepresent formidable challenge for MSE borrowers underscoring the need for facilitation by banks in these critical financial areas. Moreover, MSE enterprises are further handicapped in this regard by absence of scale and size. To effectively and decisively address these \nhandicaps, scheduled commercial banks were advised vide our \ncircular RPCD.MSME & \nNFS.BC.No.20/06.02.31/2012-13 dated August 1, 2012  that they could either separately set \nup special cells at their branches, or vertically integrate this function in the Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs) set up by them, as per their comparative advantage. The bank staff should also be trained through customised training programs to meet the specific needs of the sector. \nFurther, Financial Literacy Centres operated by Scheduled commercial Banks have been \nadvised vide our \ncircular FIDD.FLC.BC.No.22/12.01.018/2016-17 dated March 2, 2017  to \nconduct target specific financial literacy camps, where one of the target groups is small \nentrepreneurs. \n 8 \n  \n5.5 Cluster Approach  \nAll SLBC Convenor banks are advised to incorporate in their Annual Credit Plans, the credit \nrequirement in the clusters identified by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India. They are also encouraged to extend banking services in such clusters / \nagglomerations which have come up and identified subsequently by SLBC / DCC members. \ni) As per Ganguly Committee recommendations (September 4, 2004), banks are advised \nthat a full - service approach to cater to the diverse needs of the SSI sector (now MSE \nsector) may be achieved through extending banking services to recognized MSE \nclusters by adopting a 4- C approach namely, Customer focus, Cost control, Cross sell \nand Contain risk. A cluster -based approach to lending may be more beneficial:  \na) in dealing with well -defined and recognized groups; \nb) for making available of appropriate information for risk assessment;  and \nc) for monitoring by the lending institutions. \nClusters may be identified based on factors such as trade record, competitiveness and \ngrowth prospects and/or other cluster specific data. \nii) All SLBC Convenor banks were advised vide letter RPCD.PLNFS.No.10416/06.02.31/2006-07 dated May 8, 2007 to review their institutional arrangements for delivering credit to the MSME sector, especially in 388 \nclusters identified by United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) spread over 21 states in various parts of the country. A list of SME clusters as identified \nby UNIDO has been furnished in Annex I\n. \niii) The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises has approved a list of clusters \nunder the Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI) and Micro and Small Enterprises Cluster Development Programme (MSE -CDP) located in \n121 Minority Concentration Districts. Accordingly, appropriate measures have been taken to improve the credit flow to the identified clusters of micro and small entrepreneurs from the Minority Communities residing in the minority concentrated district s of the country. \niv) In terms of recommendations of the Prime Minister\u2019s Task Force on MSMEs, banks \nshould open more MSE focused branch offices at different MSE clusters which can \nalso act as Counselling Centres for MSEs. Each lead bank of a district may adopt at \nleast one MSE cluster.  \n 9 \n  \n5.6 Delayed Payment  \nIn the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED), Act 2006, the provisions \nof The Interest on Delayed Payment to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, \n1998, have been strengthened as under: \ni) The buyer has to make payment to the supplier on or before the date agreed upon \nbetween him and the supplier in writing or, in case of no agreement, before the appointed day. The period agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer shall not \nexceed forty-five days from the date of acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance.  \nii) In case the buyer fails to make payment of the amount to the supplier, he shall be liable to pay compound interest with monthly rests to the supplier on the amount from the \nappointed day or, on the date agreed on, at three times of the Bank Rate notified by Reserve Bank. \niii) For any goods supplied or services rendered by the supplier, the buyer shall be liable \nto pay the interest as advised at (ii) above. \niv) In case of dispute w ith regard to any amount due, a reference shall be made to the \nMicro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council, constituted by the respective State \nGovernment. \nFurther, banks are advised to fix sub -limits within the overall working capital limits to the l arge \nborrowers specifically for meeting the payment obligation in respect of purchases from MSMEs.  \nCHAPTER - VI \n6 Committees on flow of Credit to MSE sector  \nScheduled Commercial Banks may be guided by the contents of the following circulars while extending credit to MSE sector:  \n6.1 Report of the High Level Committee on Credit to SSI (now MSE) (Kapur Committee)  \nAll scheduled commercial banks were advised vide our circular RPCD.

The Task Force recommended several measures having a bearing on \nthe functioning of MSMEs, viz., credit, marketing, labour, exit policy, infrastructure/technology/s kill development and taxation. The comprehensive \nrecommendations cover measures that need immediate action as well as medium term institutional measures along with legal and regulatory structures and recommendations for \nNorth- Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir.  \nBanks are urged to keep in view the recommendations made by the Task Force and take \neffective steps to increase the flow of credit to the MSE sector, particularly to the micro \nenterprises. A circular was issued to all scheduled commercial banks vide \nRPCD.SME&NFS \nBC.No.90/06.02.31/2009-10 dated June 29, 2010  ad vising implementation of the \nrecommendations of the Prime Minister\u2019s Task Force on MSMEs.  \n6.6 Working Group to Review the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small \nEnterprises  \nA Working Group was constituted by the Reserve Bank of India under the Chairmanship of Shri V.K.

With the increased thrust on financial inclusion and customer protection and \nconsidering the recent surge in customer grievances relating to unauthor ised \ntransactions resulting in debits to their accounts/  cards, the criteria for determining \nthe customer liability in these circumstances have been reviewed. The revised directions in this regard are set out below.  \n \nStrengthening of systems and procedures  \n3. Broadly, the electronic banking transactions can be divided into two \ncategories:  \n(i) Remote/ online payment transactions (transactions that do not require \nphysical payment instruments to be presented at the point of transactions \ne.g. internet banking, mobile banking, card not present (CNP) \ntransactions), Pre -paid Payment Instruments (PPI),  and  \n(ii) Face- to-face/ proximity payment transactions (transactions which require \nthe physical payment instrument such as a card or mobile phone to be present at the point of transaction e.g. ATM, POS, etc.)  \n RBI,DBR,CO  - 2 -                                        continuation sheet  \n \n4. The systems and procedures in banks must be designed to make customers \nfeel safe about carrying out electronic banking transactions. To achieve this, banks \nmust put in place:  \n(i) appropriate systems and procedures to ensure safety and security of \nelectronic banking transactions carried out by customers;  \n(ii) robust and dynamic fraud detection and prevention mechanism;  \n(iii) mechanism to assess the risks (for example, gaps in the bank \u2019s existing \nsystems) resulting from unauthorised transactions and measure the \nliabilities arising out of such events;  \n(iv) appropriate measures  to mitigate the risks and protect themselves against \nthe liabilities arising therefrom; and \n(v) a system of continually and repeatedly advising customers on how to \nprotect themselves from electronic banking and payments related fraud.  \n \nReporting of unauthorised transactions by customers to banks  \n5. Banks must ask their customers to mandatorily register for SMS alerts and \nwherever  available register for e- mail alerts, for electronic banking transactions. The \nSMS alerts shall mandatorily  be sent to the customers, while email alerts may be \nsent, wherever registered. The customers must be advised to notify their bank of any \nunauthorised electronic banking transaction at the earliest after the occurrence of such transaction, and informed that the longer the time taken to notify the bank, the higher will be the risk of loss to the bank/  customer. To facilitate this, banks must \nprovide customers with 24x7 access through multiple channels (at a minimum, via website, phone banking, SMS, e- mail, IVR, a dedicated toll -free helpline, reporting to \nhome branch, etc.) for reporting unauthorised transactions  that have taken place \nand/ or loss or theft of payment instrument such as card, etc.  Banks shall also \nenable customers to instantly respond by \"Reply\" t o the SMS and e- mail alerts and \nthe customers should not be required to search for a web page or an e- mail address \nto notify the objection, if any. Further, a direct link for lodging the complaints, with  \nspecific option to report unauthorised electronic tr ansactions shall be provided by  \nbanks on home page of their website. The loss/  fraud reporting system shall also \nensure that immediate response (including auto response) is sent to the customers acknowledging the complaint along with the registered complai nt number. The RBI,DBR,CO  - 3 -                                        continuation sheet  \n \ncommunication systems used by banks to send alerts and receive their responses \nthereto must record the time and date of delivery of the message and receipt of \ncustomer\u2019s response, if any, to them. This shall be important in determining the \nextent of a customer\u2019s liability. The banks may not offer facility of electronic \ntransactions, other than ATM cash withdrawals, to customers who do not provide mobile numbers to the bank. On receipt of report of an unauthorised transaction from \nthe customer , banks must take immediate steps to prevent further unauthorised \ntransactions in the account.  \n \nLimited Liability of a Customer  \n(a) Zero Liability of a Customer  \n6. A customer\u2019s entitlement to zero liability shall arise where the unauthorised \ntransaction occur s in the following events:  \n(i) Contributory fraud/ negligence/ deficiency on the part of the bank \n(irrespective of whether or not the transaction is reported by the customer).  \n(ii) Third party breach where the deficiency lies  neither with the bank nor with \nthe cust omer but lies elsewhere in the system, and the customer notifies \nthe bank within three working days of receiving the communication from \nthe bank regarding the unauthorised transaction.  \n \n(b) Limited Liability of a Customer  \n7. A customer shall be liable for the loss occurring due to unauthorised \ntransactions in the following cases:  \n(i) In cases where the loss is due to negligence by a customer, such as \nwhere he has shared the payment credentials, the customer will bear the \nentire loss until he reports the unauthoris ed transaction to the bank. Any \nloss occurring after the reporting of the unauthorised transaction shall be borne by the bank.  \n(ii) In cases where the responsibility for the unauthorised electronic banking \ntransaction lies neither with the bank nor with the cus tomer, but lies \nelsewhere in the system and when there is a delay (of four to seven \nworking days  after receiving the communication from the bank) on the RBI,DBR,CO  - 4 -                                        continuation sheet  \n \npart of the customer in notifying the bank of such a transaction, the per \ntransaction liability  of the customer shall be limited to the transaction value \nor the amount mentioned in Table 1, whichever is lower.  \n \nTable 1 \nMaximum Liability of  a Customer under paragraph 7 (ii) \nType of Account  Maximum \nliability (\u20b9)  \n\u2022 BSBD Accounts  5,000  \n\u2022 All other SB accounts  \n\u2022 Pre-paid Payment Instruments and Gift Cards  \n\u2022 Current/  Cash Credit/  Overdraft  Accounts of \nMSMEs  \n\u2022 Current Accounts/  Cash Credit/  Overdraft Accounts \nof Individuals with annual average balance  (during \n365 days pr eceding the incidence of fraud) / limit  up \nto Rs.25 lakh \n\u2022 Credit cards with limit up to Rs.5  lakh 10,000  \n\u2022 All other Current/  Cash Credit/  Overdraft  Accounts  \n\u2022 Credi t cards with limit above Rs.5  lakh  25,000  \n Further, if the delay in reporting is beyond seven working days, the customer liability shall be determined as per the bank\u2019s  Board approved policy. Banks shall \nprovide the details of their policy in regard to customers\u2019 liability formulated in pursuance of these directions at the time of opening the accounts. Banks s hall also \ndisplay their approved policy in public domain for wider dissemination. The existing customers must also be individually informed about the bank\u2019s policy.  \n 8. Overall liability of the customer in third party breaches, as detailed in \nparagraph 6 (ii) and paragraph 7  (ii) above, where the deficiency lies neither with the \nbank nor with the customer but lies elsewhere in the system, is summarised in the Table 2:  \n \n  \n \n  RBI,DBR,CO  - 5 -                                        continuation sheet  \n \nTable 2 \nSummary of Customer\u2019s Liability  \nTime taken to report the fraudulent \ntransaction from the date of \nreceiving the communication  Customer\u2019s liability (\u20b9) \nWithin 3 working days  Zero liability  \nWithin 4 to 7 working days  The transaction value or the amount \nmentioned in Table 1, whichever is lower  \nBeyond 7 working days  As per bank\u2019s Board approved policy  \n \nThe number of working days mentioned in Table 2 shall be counted as per the \nworking schedule of the home branch of the customer excluding the date of receiving the communication.  \n Reversal Timeline for Zero Liability/ Limited Liability of customer  \n9. On being notified by the customer, the bank shall credit (shadow reversal) the \namount involved in the unauthorised electronic transaction to the customer\u2019s account within 10 working days from  the date of such notification by the customer (without \nwaiting for settlement of insurance claim, if any). Banks may also at their discretion decide to waive off any customer liability in case of unauthorised electronic banking transactions even in cases of customer negligence. The credit shall be value dated to be as of the date of the unauthorised transaction.   10. Further, banks shall ensure that:  \n(i) a complaint is resolved and liability of the customer, if any, established within such time, as may be specified in the bank\u2019s B oard approved \npolicy, but not exceeding 90 days from the date of receipt of the \ncomplaint, and the customer is compensated as per provisions of paragraphs 6 to 9 above;  \n(ii) where it is unable to resolve the complaint or determine the customer liability, if any, within 90 days, the compensation as prescribed in paragraphs  6 to 9 is paid to the customer; and \n(iii) in case of debit card/ bank account,  the customer does not suffer loss of \ninterest, and in case of credit card,  the customer does not bear any \nadditional burden of interest.  \n RBI,DBR,CO  - 6 -                                        continuation sheet  \n \nBoard Approved Policy for Customer Protection  \n11. Taking into account the risks arising out of unauthorised debits to customer \naccounts owing to customer negligence/ bank negligence/ banking system frauds/ \nthird party breaches, banks need to clearly define the rights and obli gations of \ncustomers in case of unauthorised transactions in specified scenarios. Banks shall formulate/ revise their customer relations policy, with approval of their B oards, to \ncover aspects of customer protection, including the mechanism of creating cus tomer \nawareness on the risks and responsibilities involved in electronic banking transactions and customer liability in such cases of unauthorised electronic banking transactions. The policy must be transparent, non- discriminatory and should stipulate \nthe mechanism of compensating the customers for the unauthorised electronic \nbanking transactions and also prescribe the timelines for effecting such compensation keeping in view the instructions contained in paragraph 10 above. The policy shall be displayed on the bank\u2019s website along with the details  of grievance \nhandling/ escalation procedure. The instructions contained in this circular shall be incorporated in the policy.  \n \nBurden of Proof  \n12. The burden of proving customer liability in case of unauthorised elect ronic \nbanking transactions shall lie on the bank.   \nReporting and Monitoring Requirements \n13. The banks shall put in place a suitable mechanism and structure for the \nreporting of the customer liability cases to the B oard or one of its C ommittees . The \nreporting shall, inter alia, include volume/  number of cases and the aggregate value \ninvolved and distribution across various categories of cases viz., card present \ntransactions, card not present transactions, internet banking, mobile banking, ATM transactions, etc. The Standing Committee on Customer  Service in each bank shall \nperiodically review the unauthorised electronic banking transactions reported by customers or otherwise, as also the action taken thereon, the functioning of the grievance redress mechanism and take appropriate measures to improve the systems and procedures. All  such transactions shall be reviewed by the bank\u2019s \ninternal auditors.  RBI,DBR,CO  - 7 -                                        continuation sheet  \n \n \n14.

Business Correspondents \n \nBusiness Correspondents- Cash M anagement and Umbrella Insurance \nSFBs may formulate a policy for engaging Business Correspondents (BCs), with the \napproval of their Board of Directors and be guided by instructions issued by Department of \nBanking Regulation (DBR) on Business Correspondents under Master Circular on Branch \nAuthorisation (available on  DBOD. No. BAPD.BC. 7/22.01.001/2014 -15 dated July 01, 2014 ) \nupdated from time to time. The activities to be undertaken by the BCs would be within the normal course of banking busines s. With a view to providing impetus to functioning of BCs in \nfurthering financial inclusion, the following guidelines pertaining to cash management are \nissued:  \na. The Boards of the banks must review the operations of BCs at least once every six \nmonths with a view to ensuring that the requirement of prefunding of Corporate BCs and  \n31 \n \nBC Agents should progressively taper down with the passage of time. Ideally in all \nnormal cases, the prefunding should progressively come down in such a manner so as to reach around 15% of the limits fixed for each BC/CSP in case of deposits and 30% in \ncase of Bank Guarantees, in two years from the time a BC starts operations.  \nb. The Board should also review the position of payment to remuneration of BCs and \nshould also lay down a system of monitoring by the top management of the bank. The \nissue of allowing BCs to handle deposit and payment transactions of various credits, remittance, overdraft and other products of banks must also be examined by the Board \nfrom time to time. Complaints r edress system in this regard should also be laid down by \nthe Board.  \nc. The banks should put in place a Board approved mechanism for providing Umbrella \nInsurance for cash handled by BCs.  \nSECTION \u2013 III. SHG -Bank Linkage Programme  \n \nSHG -Bank Linkage Programme for Small Finance Banks \nTo scale up the SHGs linkage programme and make it sustainable, SFBs are advised to \nconsider lending to SHGs as part of their mainstream credit operations both at policy and \nimplementation level. They may include SHG linkage in their corporate strategy/plan, training \ncurriculum of their officers and staff and implement it as a regular business activity and \nmonitor and review it periodically.  \nIn line with the above, the following guidelines may be considered by SFBs while formulating \npolicies pertaining to Self Help Groups. \na. SHG lending to be a part of planning process: Lending to SHGs should be included in \nbranch credit plan, block credit plan, district credit plan and state credit plan of each \nSFB. While no target is being prescribed under SHG bank linkage programme, utmost \npriority should be accorded to the sector in preparation of these plans. It should also form an integral part of the bank\u2019s corporate credit plan.  \nb. Opening of Savings Bank A/c:  The SHGs registered or unregistered which are \nengaged in promoting savings habit among their members would be eligible to open \nsavings bank accounts with SFBs. These SHGs need not necessarily have already \navailed of credit facilities from banks before opening savings bank accounts. KYC  \n32 \n \nverification of all the members of SHG shall not be required while opening the savings \nbank account of the SHG as KYC verification of all the office bearers shall suffice. No \nseparate KYC verification of the members or offic e bearers shall be necessary at the \ntime of credit linking of SHGs.  \nc. Margin and Security Norms:  As per operational guidelines issued by NABARD, SHGs \nmay be sanctioned savings linked loans by banks (varying from a saving to loan ratio of \n1:1 to 1:4). However, in case of matured SHGs, loans may be given beyond the limit of \nfour times the savings as per the discretion of the bank.  \nd. Documentation:  A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation is \na precondition for augmenting flow of credit to SH Gs. Banks should strive to remove all \noperational irritants  and make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and disburse \ncredit by delegating adequate sanctioning powers to branch managers. The loan \napplication forms, procedures and documents should be made simple. It would help in \nproviding prompt and hassle-free credit.  \ne. Presence of defaulters in SHGs:  Defaults by a few members of SHGs and/or their \nfamily members to the financing bank should not ordinarily come in the way of financing \nSHGs per se by banks  provided the SHG is not in default to it. However, the bank loan \nmay not be utilized by the SHG for financing a defaulter member to the bank.  \nf. Capacity Building and Training:  SFBs may initiate suitable steps to internalize the \nSHGs linkage project and organize exclusive short duration programmes for the field \nlevel functionaries. In addition, suitable awareness/sensitization programmes may be \nconducted for their middle level controlling officers as well as senior officers.  \ng. Monitoring and Review of SHG Lending: The progress of the SHG programme may \nbe reviewed by the SFBs at regular intervals. A progress report, as prescribed vide \ncircular FIDD.FID.BC.No.56/12.01.033/2014-15 dated May 21, 2015 , may be sent to \nNABARD (Micro Credit Innovations Department), Mumbai, on a half-yearly basis, as on \n30 September and 31 March each year so as to reach within 30 days of the half-year to \nwhich the report relates.  \nh. Interest rates:  SFBs would have the discretion to decide on the interest rates  applicable \nto loans given by banks to Self Help Groups/member  beneficiaries .  \ni. Service/ Processing charges:  No loan related and ad hoc service charges/inspection \ncharges should be levied on priority sector loans up to \u20b9 25,000. In the case of eligible  \n33 \n \npriority sector loans to SHGs/ JLGs, this limit will be applicable per member and not to \nthe group as a whole. \nj. Total Financial Inclusion and Credit Requirement of SHGs:  SFBs have been advised \nto meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members namely, (a) income generation activities, (b) social needs like housing, education, marriage, etc. and (c) debt swapping. \nk. Encourage SHG Linkage:  SFBs should provide adequate incentives to their branches \nin financing the Self Help Groups (SHGs) and establish linkages with them, making the \nprocedures absolutely simple and easy while providing for total flexibility in such \nprocedures to suit local conditions. The group dynamics of working of the SHGs need \nneither be regulated nor formal structures imposed or insisted upon. The approach to \nfinancing of SHGs should be totally hassle -free and may include consumption \nexpenditures.   \n34 \n \nCHAPTER VI: FARM SECTOR  \nSECTION \u2013 I. Revised Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme  \n1. Introduction \nThe Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was introduced in 1998 for issue of Kisan Credit \nCards to farmers on the basis of their holdings for uniform adoption by the banks so that \nfarmers may use them to readily purchase agriculture inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, \npesticides etc. and draw cash for their production needs. The scheme w as further extended \nfor the investment credit requirement of farmers viz. allied and non-farm activities in the year \n2004. The scheme was further revisited in 2012 by a working Group under the Chairmanship \nof Shri T. M. Bhasin, CMD, Indian Bank with a view  to simplify the scheme and facilitate \nissue of Electronic Kisan Credit Cards. The scheme provides broad guidelines to banks for \noperationalizing the KCC scheme. Implementing banks will have the discretion to adopt the \nsame to suit institution/location spe cific requirements.  \n2. Applicability of the Scheme \nThe Kisan Credit Card Scheme detailed in the ensuing paragraphs is to be implemented by \nCommercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks and Cooperatives. \n3. Objective / Purpose \nThe Kisan Credit Card scheme aim s at providing adequate and timely credit support from \nthe banking system under a single window with flexible and simplified procedure to the \nfarmers for their cultivation and other needs as indicated below: \na. To meet the short term credit requirements for c ultivation of crops; \nb. Post-harvest expenses; \nc. Produce marketing loan;  \nd. Consumption requirements of farmer household;  \ne. Working capital for maintenance of farm assets and activities allied to agriculture;  \nf. Investment credit requirement for agriculture and allied activities.  \nNote:  The aggregate of components  \u2018a\u2019 to \u2018e\u2019 above will form the short term credit limit \nportion and the aggregate of components under  \u2018f\u2019 will form the long term credit limit portion.   \n35 \n \n4. Eligibility  \ni. Farmers - individual/joint borrowers who are owner cultivators; \nii. Tenant farmers, oral lessees & share croppers;  \niii. Self Help Groups (SHGs) or Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) of farmers including tenant \nfarmers, share croppers etc.  \n5. Fixation of credit limit / Loan amount  \nThe credit limit under the Kisan Credit Card may be fixed as under:  \n5.1 All farmers other than marginal farmers1 : \n5.1.1 The short term limit to be arrived for the first year (For cultivating single crop in \na year):  \nScale of finance for the crop (as decided by District Level T echnical Committee) x Extent of \narea cultivated + 10% of limit towards post-harvest/household/ consumption requirements + 20% of limit towards repairs and maintenance expenses of farm assets + crop insurance \nand/or accident insurance including PAIS, health insurance & asset insurance.  \n5.1.2 Limit for second & subsequent year  \nFirst year limit for crop cultivation purpose arrived at as above plus 10% of the limit towards \ncost escalation / increase in scale of finance for every successive year (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th \nyear) and estimated term loan component for the tenure of Kisan Credit Card, i.e., five \nyears. (Illustration I\n) \n5.1.3 For cultivating more than one crop in a year  \nThe limit is to be fixed as above depending upon the crops cultivated as per proposed \ncropping pattern for the first year plus an addi tional 10% of the limit towards cost escalation / \nincrease in scale of finance for every successive year (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year). It is \nassumed that the farmer adopts the same cropping pattern for the succeeding four years. In \ncase the cropping patter n adopted by the farmer is changed in the subsequent year, the limit \nmay be reworked. (Illustration I ) \n                                                            \n1  Farmers with landholding of up to 1 hectare (Marginal Farmers). Farmers with a landholding of more than 1 hectare and up to \n2 hectares (Small Farmers).   \n36 \n \n5.1.4 Term loan for investment  \nThe term loan for investment is to be made towards land development, minor irrigation, \npurchase of farm equipment and allied agricultural activities. The banks may fix the quantum \nof credit for term and working capital limit for agricultural and allied activities, etc., based on \nthe unit cost of the asset/s proposed to be acquired by the farmer, the all ied activities \nalready being undertaken on the farm, the bank's judgment on repayment capacity vis -a-vis \ntotal loan burden devolving on the farmer, including existing loan obligations. \nThe long term loan limit should be based on the proposed investment(s) during the five year \nperiod and the bank's perception on the repaying capacity of the farmer. \n5.1.5 Maximum Permissible Limit  \nThe short term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the estimated long term loan \nrequirement will be the Maximum Permissible L imit (MPL) and is to be treated as the Kisan \nCredit Card limit. \n5.1.6 Fixation of Sub-limits \ni. Short term loans and term loans are governed by different interest rates. At present, short \nterm crop loans upto \u20b9 3 lakh are covered under Interest Subvention Scheme/Prompt \nRepayment Incentive scheme of the Government of India2. Further, repayment schedule and \nnorms are different for short term and term loans. Hence, in order to have operational and \naccounting convenience, the card limit is to be bifurcated into separate sub-limits for short \nterm cash credit limit cum savings account and term loans. \nii. Drawing limit for short term cash credit should be fixed based on the cropping pattern. The \namount(s) for crop production, repair and maintenance of farm assets and consumption may \nbe allowed to be drawn as per the convenience of the farmer. In case the revision of scale of \nfinance for any year by the district level technical committee exceeds the notional hike of \n10% contemplated while fixing the five year limit, a revised drawable limit may be fixed in \nconsultation with the farmer. In case such revisions require the c ard limit itself to be \nenhanced (4th or 5th year), the same may be done and the farmer be so advised. \n                                                            \n2 Currently not applicable to Small Finance Banks .  \n37 \n \niii. For term loans, instalments  may be allowed to be withdrawn based on the nature of \ninvestment and repayment schedule drawn as per the economic life of the proposed \ninvestments. It is to be ensured that at any point of time the total liability should be within \nthe drawing limit of the concerned year . \niv. Wherever the card limit / liability so arrived warrants additional security, the banks may \ntake suitable collateral as per their policy. \n5.2 For Marginal Farmers \nA flexible limit of \u20b9 10, 000 to \u20b9 50, 000 may be provided (as Flexi KCC) based on the land \nholding and crops grown including post-harvest warehouse storage related credit needs and \nother farm ex penses, consumption needs, etc., plus small term loan investment(s) like \npurchase of farm equipment(s), establishing mini dairy/backyard poultry as per assessment of the Branch Manager without relating it to the value of land. The composite KCC limit is to  \nbe fixed for a period of five years on this basis.  \nWherever higher limit is required due to change in cropping pattern and / or scale of finance, \nthe limit may be arrived at as per the estimation indicated at para 4.1 (Illustration II\n) \n6. Disbursement  \n6.1 The short term component of the KCC limit is in the nature of revolving cash credit \nfacility. There should be no restriction in number of debits and credits. The drawing limit for \nthe current season/year could be allowed to be drawn using any of the following delivery channels.  \ni. operation through branch; \nii. operation using cheque facility;  \niii. withdrawal through ATM /debit cards  \niv. operation through Business Correspondents and \u2018banking outlet/part-time banking \noutlet\u2019\n3 \nv. operation through PoS available in Sugar Mills/C ontract farming companies, etc., \nespecially for tie-up advances;  \nvi. operations through PoS available with input dealers; \nvii. Mobile based transfer transactions at agricultural input dealers and mandies.  \n                                                            \n3 DBR\u2019s Circular on Rationalisation of Branch Authori sation Policy - Revision of Guidelines   \n38 \n \nNote : (v), (vi) & (vii) to be introduced as early as possibl e so as to reduce transaction costs \nof both the bank as well as the farmer. \n6.2 The long term loan for investment purposes may be drawn as per installment fixed. \n7. Issue of Electronic Kisan Credit Cards  \nAll new KCC must be issued as smart card cum debit c ard as laid down in Part II of the \nAnnex. Further, at the time of renewal of existing KCC; farmers must be issued smart card \ncum debit card. \nThe short term credit limit and the term loan limit are two distinct components of the \naggregate KCC limit bearing different rates of interest and repayment periods. Until a \ncomposite card could be issued with appropriate software to separately account transactions \nin the sub limits, two separate electronic cards may be issued for all new/renewed cards.  \n8. Validity/Renewal  \ni. Banks may determine the validity period of KCC and its periodic review. \nii. The review may result in continuation of the facility, enhancement of limit or cancellation of the limit/withdrawal of the facility depending upon increase in cropping area/patter n \nand performance of the borrower. \niii. When the bank has granted extension and/or re-schedule the period of repayment on \naccount of natural calamities affecting the farmer, the period for reckoning the status of \noperations as satisfactory or otherwise would get extended together with the extended amount of limit. When the proposed extension is bey ond one crop season, the \naggregate of debits for which extension is granted is to be transferred to a separate term \nloan account with stipulation for repayment in installments. \n9. Rate of Interest (ROI): \nThe rate of interest will be as stipulated in DBR Master Directions on Interest Rate on \nAdvances. \n10. Repayment Period:  \n10.1 The repayment period may be fixed by banks as per the anticipated harvesting and \nmarketing period for the crops for which the loan has been granted.  \n39 \n \n10.2 The term loan component wil l be normally repayable within a period of 5 years \ndepending on the type of activity/investment as per the existing guidelines applicable for \ninvestment credit.  \n10.3 Financing banks may, at their discretion, provide longer repayment period for term loan \ndepending on the type of investment. \n11. Margin  \nTo be decided by banks. \n12. Security \n12.1 Security will be applicable as per RBI guidelines prescribed from time to time. \n12.2 Security requirement may be as under:  \ni. Hypothecation of crops: For KCC limit upto \u20b9 1.00 lakh banks are to waive \nmargin/security requirements.  \nii. With tie-up for recovery: Banks may consider sanctioning loans on hypothecation of \ncrops up to card limit of \u20b9 3.00 lakh without insisting on collateral security.  \niii. Collateral security: Collateral security may be obtained at the discretion of Bank for loan \nlimits above \u20b9 1.00 lakh in case of non-tie-up and above \u20b9 3.00 lakh in case of tie- up \nadvances. \niv. In states where banks have the facility of on-line creation of charge on the land records, \nthe same s hall be ensured. \n13. Other features \nUniformity to be adopted in respect of following:  \n13.1 The applicable interest subvention /incentive for prompt repayment4 as advised by \nGovernment of India and/or State Governments. The bankers will give adequate publicity of \nthe facility so that maximum farmers may benefit from the scheme. \n13.2 Besides the mandatory crop insurance, the KCC holder should have the option to avail \nthe benefit of any type of asset insurance, accident insurance (including PAIS), health \n                                                            \n4 Currently not applicable to Small Finance Banks.   \n40 \n \ninsurance (wherever product is available) and have premium paid through his/her KCC \naccount. Premium has to be borne by the farmer/bank according to the terms of the scheme. Farmer beneficiaries should be made aware of the insurance cover available and their \nconsent (except in case of crop insurance, it being mandatory) is to be obtained, at the \napplication stage itself.  \n13.3 A one-time documentation\n5 at the first time of availment of KCC loan and thereafter \nsimple declaration (about crops grown/proposed) by farmer from the second year onwards. \n14. Classification of account as NPA:  \n14.1 The extant prudential norms on income recognition, asset-classification and \nprovisioning6 will ap ply for loans granted under the KCC Scheme.  \n14.2 Charging of interest is to be done uniformly as is applicable to agricultural advances.  \n15. Processing fee, inspection charges and other charges may be decided by banks. \n16. Other conditions while implementing the revised guidelines of KCC Scheme:  \n16.1 In case the farmer applies for loan against the warehouse receipt of his produce, the \nbanks would consider such requests as per the established procedure and guidelines. \nHoweve r, when such loans are sanctioned, these should be linked with the crop loan \naccount, if any, and the crop loan outstanding in the account could be settled at the stage of \ndisbursal of the pledge loan, if the farmer so desires. \n16.2 The National Payments C orporation of India (NPCI) will design the KCC card to be \nadopted by all the banks with their branding.  \n \n \n \n                                                            \n5Documentation as per banks internal guidelines   \n6 DBR\u2019s Master Directions on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning Norms  \n \n  \n41 \n \n \nIllustration I  \n A.

The \nrecommended scale of finance / unit costs may be taken into account while \nfinalising the credit limit.  \n \n        \n46 \n \nDelivery Channels - Technical features  \n1 Issue of cards  \n The beneficiaries under the scheme will be issued with a Smart card / Debit card (Biometric smart \ncard compatible for use in the ATMs / Hand held Swipe Machines and capable of storing adequate \ninformation on farmers identity, assets, land holdings and cred it profile etc.). All KCC holders should \nbe provided with any one or a combination of the following types of cards :  \n2 Type of Card :  \n A magnetic stripe card with PIN (Personal Identification Number) with an ISO IIN (International \nStandards Organization International Identification Number) to enable access to all banks ATMs and \nmicro ATMs  \n In cases where the Banks would want to utilize the centralized biometric authentication infrastructure \nof the UIDAI (Aadhaar authentication), debit cards with magnetic  stripe and PIN with ISO IIN with \nbiometric authentication of UIDAI can be provided.  \n Debit Cards with magnetic stripe and only biometric authentication can also be provided depending \non customer base of the bank. Till such time, UIDAI becomes widespread,  if the banks want to get \nstarted without inter -operability using their existing centralized bio metric infrastructure, banks may \ndo so.  \n Banks may choose to issue EMV (Europay, MasterCard and VISA, a global standard for \ninteroperation of integrated circu it cards) and RUPAY  compliant chip cards with magnetic stripe and \npin with ISO IIN.  \n Further, the biometric authentication and smart cards may follow the common open standards \nprescribed by IDRBT and IBA. This will enable them to transact seamlessly with input dealers as \nalso enable them to have the sales proceeds credited to their account s when they sell their output at \nmandies, procurement centers, etc.  \n  3 Delivery Channels :  \n The following delivery channels shall be put in place to start with so that the Kisan Credit Card is \nused by the farmers to effectively transact their operation s in their KCC account.  \n 1. Withdrawal through ATMs / Micro ATM  \n 2. Withdrawal through BCs using smart cards.   \n47 \n \n 3. PoS machine through input dealers  \n 4. Mobile Banking with IMPS capabilities / IVR  \n \n4. Mobile Banking / Other Channels :  \n Provide Mobile banking functionality for KCC Cards / Accounts as well along with Interbank Mobile \nPayment Service (IMPS of NPCI) capability to allow customers to use this inter -operable IMPS for \nfunds transfer between banks and also to do merchant payment transactions as additional capability \nfor purchases of agricultural inputs.  \n This mobile banking should ideally be on Unstructured Supplementary Data (USSD) platform for \nwider and safer acceptance. However, the banks can also offer this on other fully encrypted modes \n(application based or SMS based) to make use of the recent relaxation on transaction limits. Banks \ncan also offer unencrypted mobile banking subject to RBI regulations on transaction limits.  \n It is necessary that Mobile based transaction p latforms enabling transactions in the KCC use easy to \nuse SMS based solution with authentication thru' MPIN. Such solutions also need to be enabled on \nIVR in local language to ensure transparency and security. Such mobile based payment systems \nshould be en couraged by all the banks by creating awareness and by doing proper customer \neducation.  \n With the existing infrastructure available with banks, all KCC holders should be provided with any \none or a combination of the following types of cards :  \n  * Debit c ards (magnetic stripe card with PIN) enabling farmers to operate the limit \nthrough all banks ATMs / Micro ATMs  \n  * Debit Cards with magnetic stripe and biometric authentication.  \n  * Smart cards for doing transactions through PoS  machines held by Business \nCorrespondents, input dealers, traders and Mandies.  \n  * EMV compliant chip cards with magnetic stripe and pin with ISO IIN.  \n In addition, the banks having a call centre / Inter active Voice Response (IVR),  may provide SMS \nbased mobile banking with a call back facility from bank for mobile PIN (MPIN) verification through \nIVR, thus making a secured SMS based mobile banking facility available to card holders.  \n   \n48 \n \nSECTION  \u2013 II. Relief Measure By Banks In Areas A ffected By Natural Calamities \n \nBACKGROUND  \n2.1 Periodical but frequent occurrence of natural calamity takes a heavy toll on human life \nand cause wide spread damage to economic pursuits in one or the other part of the country. \nThe devastation caused by natural calamities calls for massive rehabilitation effort from all \nagencies. The Central, State and local authorities draw programmes on economic \nrehabilitation for the people affected by natural calamities. The developmental role assigned \nto the commercial banks including Small Finance Banks warrant their active support in \nreviving the economic activities of those affected by the occurrence of a natural calamity.  \n2.2 In terms of the National Disaster Management Framework, there are two funds \nconstituted viz. National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster Response \nFund (SDRF) for providing relief in the affected areas. This framework currently recognizes \n12 types of natural calamities viz. cyclone, drought, earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, \nhailstorm, landslide, avalanche, cloud burst, pest attack and cold wave/frost. Out of these \n12, for 4 calamities i.e. drought, hailstorms, pest attack and cold wave/frost, the Ministry of \nAgriculture is the nodal point and for the remaining 8, the Ministry of Home Affairs is the \nnodal ministry to make the necessary administrative arrangements. A slew of measures for \nrelief are undertaken by the Sovereign (Central/State Government) from time to time to \nprovide relief to the affected people including, inter alia, provision for input subsidies, \nfinancial assistanc e to farmers including small and marginal farmers. \n2.3 The role of the scheduled commercial banks including Small Finance Banks (SFBs) is to \nprovide relief measure through rescheduling existing loans and sanctioning fresh loans as per the emerging requirem ent of the borrowers. To enable banks to take  uniform and \nconcerted action expeditiously, these directions are issued covering four aspects viz. (i) Institutional Framework  (ii) Restructuring of Existing Loans  (iii) Providing Fresh Loans and \n(iv) Other Ancillary Relief Measures. \nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK  \n3.1 Establishing Policy/Procedures for dealing with Natural Calamities \nThe area, time of occurrence and intensity of the natural calamity cannot be anticipated. It is, \ntherefore, imperative that banks have a blueprint of action duly approved by the Board of \nDirectors for such eventualities so that the required relief and assistance is provided with  \n49 \n \nutmost speed and without any loss of time. Further, all Divisional/Zonal Offices and branches \nof Scheduled Commercial/Small Finance banks should be familiar with these standing instructions. These standing instructions will immediately come to force after the district/state \nauthorities put in place the requisite declaration.  It is essential that these instructions should \nalso be made available to the State Government authorities and all the District Collectors so \nthat all concerned are aware about the action that should be taken by the concerned \nauthorities in the affected area. \n3.2 Discretionary Powers to Divisional / Zonal Manager of banks \nThe Divisional/Zonal Managers of scheduled commercial/SF banks must be vested with \ncertain discretionary powers to avoid the need to seek fresh approval from their Central \nOffice regarding the line of action decided by the Distri ct Consultative Committee/State Level \nBankers\u2019 Committee. Some of the areas, among others where such discretionary powers are vital may be the adoption of scale of finance, extension of loan period, margin, security, \nsanction of new loan keeping in view the total liability of the borrower arising out of the old \nloan where the asset financed is damaged or lost due to the natural calamity and the new loan financed for creation/repair of such asset(s).  \n3.3 Meeting of State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)/Dist rict Consultative \nCommittee (DCC)  \n3.3.1 In the event of an occurrence of a natural calamity which covers a larger part of a \nState, the State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee convener bank should convene a meeting \nimmediately. The committee, in collaboration with the State Government authorities should evolve a coordinated action plan for implementing the relief programme.  If the calamity has \naffected only a small part of the state/few districts, the convener of the District Consultative \nCommittee of the affected district(s) should convene a meeting immediately. In the special \nSLBC/DCC meeting, the position of the affected areas may be assessed so as to ensure \nspeedy formulation and implementation of suitable relief measures.  \n3.3.2 In the areas where the calamity is  severe, the relief measure(s) implemented should be \nreviewed periodically through a specially constituted Task Force/Sub-Committee by way of \nweekly/fortnightly meetings as decided by the SLBC/DCC.   \n \n  \n50 \n \n3.4 Declaration of Natural Calamity \n3. 4.1 It is recognised that declaration of a natural calamity is in the domain of the Sovereign \n(Central / State Governments). The inputs received from the State Governments reveal that \nthere are no uniform procedures being followed for declaration of natural calamity and issue \nof declarations / certificates. These declarations/certificates are called by different names \nsuch as Annewari, Paisewari, Girdawari, etc. in different States. Nevertheless, the common \nthread to extend relief measures including reschedulement of loan s by banks, is that the \ncrop loss assessed should be 33% or more. For assessing this loss, while some States \nare conducting crop cutting experiments to determine the loss in crop yield, some others are \nrelying on the eye estimates/visual impressions.  \n3.4.2 In case of extreme situations such as wide-spread floods, etc. when it is largely clear \nthat most of the standing crops have been damaged and/or land and other assets have suffered a wide-spread damage, the matter be deliberated by State Government/Distri ct \nAuthorities in the especially convened SLBC/DCC meetings where the concerned Government functionary/District Collector may explain the reasons for not estimating \n\u2018Annewari\u2019 (percentage of crop loss \u2013  by whatever name called) through crop cutting \nexperim ents and that the decision to provide relief for the affected populace needs to be \ntaken based on the eye estimate/visual impressions. \n3.4.3 In both the cases, however, DCCs/SLBC have to satisfy themselves fully that the crop \nloss has been 33% or more before acting on these pronouncements. \nRESTRUCTURUNG OF EXISTING LOANS  \nIn the event of a natural calamity, the repaying capacity of the people gets severely affected \ndue to the disruption of their economic activities and loss of economic assets. Therefore, \nrelief in loan repayment, by restructuring the existing loan may become necessary. \n4.1. Agriculture Loans: Short-term Production Credit (Crop Loans)  \n4.1.1 All short-term loans, except those which are overdue at the time of occurrence of \nnatural calamity, should be eligible for restructuring. The principal amount of the short-\nterm loan as well as interest due for repayment in the year of occurrence of the natural \ncalamity may be converted into term loan. \n4.1.2 The repayment period of the restructured loan m ay vary depending on the severity \nof the calamity, the impact on loss of economic assets and distress it caused. A  \n51 \n \nmaximum repayment period of up to 2 years (including the moratorium period of 1 year) \nshould be allowed if the loss is between 33% and 50%. If the crop loss is 50% or more, repayment period may be extended upto a maximum of 5 years (including the 1 year \nmoratorium period). \n4.1.3 In all restructured loan accounts, moratorium period of at least one year  should be \nconsidered. Banks should also not insist on additional collateral security for such \nrestructured loans.  \n4.2 Agriculture Loans: Long term (Investment) Credit \n4.2.1 The existing term loan installments should be rescheduled keeping in view the \nrepaying capacity of the borrower and the nature of natural calamity viz. \n \n4.2.1.1 Natural Calamities where only crop for that year is damaged and productive \nassets are not damaged. \n4.2.1.2 Natural Calamities where the productive assets are partially or totall y \ndamaged and borrowers are in need of a new loan. \n4.2.1.3 In regard to natural calamity under category ( 4.2.1.1) above, the banks may \nreschedule the payment of installment during the year of natural calamity and extend \nthe loan period by one year. Under this arrangement the installments defaulted \nwillfully  in earlier years will not be eligible for rescheduling. The banks may also have \nto postpone payment of interest by borrowers. 4.2.1.4 In regard to category ( 4.2.1.2) i.e. where the borrower\u2019s assets are \npartially/totally damaged, the rescheduling by way of extension of loan period may be determined on the basis of overall repaying capacity of the borrower vis -a-vis his total \nliability (old term loan, restructured crop loan, if any and the fresh crop/term loan being given) less the subsidies received from the Government agencies, \ncompensation available under the insurance schemes, etc. While the total repayment \nperiod for the restructured/fresh term loan will differ on case-to-case basis, generally \nit shoul d not exceed a period of 5 years. \n4.3 Other Loans  \n4.3.1 A view needs to be taken by SLBC/DCC depending on the severity of the calamity \nas to whether a general reschedulement of all other loans (i.e. besides the agriculture \nloans as indicated above) such as  loans granted for allied activities and loans given to \nrural artisans, traders, micro/small industrial units or in case of extreme situations,  \n52 \n \nmedium enterprises is required. If such a decision is taken, while recovery of all the \nloans be postponed by the specified period, banks will have to assess the requirement of \nthe individual borrowers in each such case and depending on the nature of his account, \nrepayment capacity and the need for the fresh loans, appropriate decisions shall be \ntaken by the individual banks  \n4.3.2 The primary consideration before the banks in extending credit to any unit for its rehabilitation should be based on the viability of the venture after the rehabilitation \nprogramme is implemented. \n4.4 Asset Classification  \nThe asset classific ation status of the restructured loans will be as under:  \n4.4.1 The restructured portion of the short term as well as long-term loans may be \ntreated as current dues and need not be classified as NPA. The asset classification of \nthese term loans would thereafter be governed by the revised terms and conditions. \nNevertheless, banks are required to make higher provisions for such restructured \nstandard advances as prescribed by Department of Banking Regulation\n7 from time to \ntime. \n4.4.2. The asset classification for the remaining dues, which does not form a part of the \nrestructured portion, will continue to be governed by the original terms and conditions of \nits sanction. Consequently, the dues from the borrower shall be classified by the lending \nbank under different asset classification categories viz. standard, sub-standard, doubtful \nand loss.  \n4.4.3. Additional finance, if any, shall be treated as \u201cstandard asset\u201d and its future asset \nclassification will be governed by the terms and conditions of its sanction.  \n4.4.4. With the objective to ensure that banks are proactive in extending relief to the \naffected persons, the benefit of asset classification of the restructured account as on the \ndate of natural calamity will be available only if the restructuring is completed within a \nperiod of three months from the date of natural calamity. In the event of extreme \ncalamity, when the SLBC/DCC is of the view that this period will not be sufficient for the \nbanks to reschedule all the affected loans, it should immediately approach the concerned \nRegional Office of RBI detailing the reasons for seeking extension. Such requests will be \nconsidered on the merit of each case. \n                                                            \n7 DBR\u2019s Master Directio ns on Prudential Guidelines on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and \nProvisioning   \n53 \n \n4.4.5 The accounts that are restructured for the second time or more on account of \nrecurrence of natural calam ities should retain the same asset classification category on \nrestructuring. Accordingly, for a restructured standard asset, the subsequent \nrestructuring necessitated on account of  natural calamity would not be treated as \nsecond restructuring, i.e., the s tandard asset classification will be allowed to be \nmaintained. However, all other restructuring norms will apply.  \n4.5 Utilization of Insurance Proceeds  \n4.5.1 While the above measures relating to rescheduling of loans are intended to provide relief to the farmers, the insurance proceeds should, ideally, compensate their losses. In terms of orders issued by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers \nWelfare, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has, replaced the existing \nschemes of National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) & Modified National \nAgricultural Insurance Scheme (MNAIS) with effect from Kharif 2016. Under the scheme \nall agriculture loans are provided insurance cover for all  stages of the crop cycle \nincluding post-harvest risks in specified instances. Farmers\u2019 details are required to be \nentered by banks in the unified portal for crop insurance which is available at \nwww.agri -\ninsurance.gov.in  in order to facilitate assessment of coverage of crops insured, \npremiums deducted, etc.  \n4.5.2 While restructuring the loans in areas affected by a natural calamity, banks should \nalso take into account the insurance proceeds, if any, receivable from the Insurance \nCompany. They should adjust these proceeds to the \u2018restructured accounts\u2019 in cases where they have granted fresh loan to the borrower. However, banks should act with empathy and consider restructuring and granting fresh l oans without waiting for the \nreceipt of insurance claim, in cases where there is reasonable certainty of receiving the \nclaim.  \n \nPROVIDING FRESH LOANS  \n5.1 Sanctioning of Fresh Loans \n5.1.1 Once the decision to reschedule loans is taken by SLBC/DCC, pending conversion \nof short-term loans, banks shall grant fresh crop loan to the affected people based on the \nscale of finance for the crop and the cultivation area, as per the extant guidelines\n8. \n                                                            \n8 Master circular on Kisan Credit card Scheme available @ www.rbi.org.in    \n54 \n \n5.1.2 The bank assistance in agriculture and allied activities (poultry, fishery, animal \nhusbandry, etc.) may also be needed for long term loans for a variety of purposes such \nas repair of existing economic asset(s) and/or acquisition of new asset(s). Similarly, rural \nartisans, self-employed persons, micro and small i ndustrial units, etc. in the areas \naffected by a natural calamity may require fresh credit to sustain their livelihood. Banks \nshould assess the need and decide on the quantum of loans to be granted to the \naffected borrowers taking into consideration, amongst others, their credit requirement \nand the due procedure for sanctioning loans.  \n5.1.3. Banks shall also grant consumption loan up to \u20b9 10,000/- to existing borrowers \nwithout any collateral. The limit may, however, be enhanced beyond \u20b910,000/- at the \nbank\u2019 s discretion.  \n5.2 Terms and Conditions \n5.2.1 Guarantee, Security and Margin \n5.2.1.1 Credit should not be denied for want of personal guarantees. Where the bank\u2019s existing security has been eroded because of damage or destruction by \nfloods, assistance will not be denied merely for want of additional fresh security. The \nfresh loan shall be granted even if the value of security (existing as well as the asset \nto be acquired from the new loan) is less than the loan amount. For fresh loans, a \nsympathetic view wil l have to be taken. \n5.2.1.2 Where the crop loan (which has been converted into term loan) was earlier \nsanctioned against personal security/hypothecation of crop and the borrower is not \nable to offer charge/mortgage of land as security for the converted loan, she/he \nshould not be denied conversion facility merely on the ground of his/her inability to furnish land as security. If the borrower has already taken a term loan against \nmortgage/charge on land, the bank should be content with a second charge for the  \nconverted term loan. Banks should not insist on third party guarantee for providing \nconversion facility.  \n5.2.1.3 Where land is taken as security, in the absence of original title record, a \ncertificate issued by the Revenue Department officials may be accepted for financing \nto farmers who have lost proof of their title such as title deed or registration certificate \nissued to registered share-croppers.  \n5.2.1.4 Margin requirements may be waived or the grant/subsidy given by the concerned State Government may be considered as margin. \n  \n55 \n \n5.3 Rate of Interest  \nThe rates of interest will be in accordance with the directives of the Reserve Bank. Within the \nareas of their discretion, however, banks are expected to take a sympathetic view of the \ndifficulties of the borrowers and extend a concessional treatment to calamity -affected people. \nIn respect of current dues in default, no penal interest will be charged. The banks should \nalso suitably defer the compounding of interest charges. Banks may not levy any penal \ninterest and consider waiving penal interest, if any, already charged in regard to the loans converted/rescheduled. Depending on the nature and severity of natural calamity, the SLBC/ \nDCC shall take a view on the interest rate concession that could be extended to borrowers \nso that there is uniformity in approach among banks in providing relief.  \nOTHER ANCILLARY MEASURES  \n6.1 Relaxation on Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms  \nIt needs to be recognized that many persons displaced or adversely affected by a major \ncalamity may not have access to their normal identification and personal records. In such \ncases a small account based on the photograph and signature or thumb impression \nrendered in front of the bank official shall be opened. The above instructions will be \napplic able to cases where the balance in the account does not exceed \u20b9 50,000/- or the \namount of relief granted (if higher) and the total credit in the account does not exceed \u20b91, 00,000/- or the amount of relief granted, (if higher) in a year. \n6.2 Providing access to Banking Service \n6.2.1 Banks may operate its natural calamity affected branches from temporary premises \nunder advice to the concerned Regional Office of RBI. For continuing the temporary premise \nbeyond 30 days, banks may obtain specific approval from  the concerned Regional Office of \nRBI. Banks may also make arrangements to render banking services in the affected areas by setting up satellite offices, extension counters or mobile banking facilities etc. under \nintimation to RBI. \n6.2.2 To meet the immedi ate cash requirement of the affected people, due importance may \nbe given towards restoring the ATMs or other alternate arrangements maybe provided to \navail such facilities.  \n6.2.3 Other measures that banks may initiate at their discretion to alleviate the condition of \nthe affected people could be waiving ATM fees, increasing ATM withdrawal limits; waiving  \n56 \n \noverdraft fees/early withdrawal penalty on time deposits /late fee for credit card/other loan \ninstalment payments etc. and giving option to credit card holders to convert their outstanding \nbalance to EMIs repayable in 1-2 years. Besides, all charges debited to the farm loan \naccount other than the normal interest may be waived considering the hardship caused to \nthe affected people.  \nRIOTS AND DISTURBANCES: AP PLICABILITY OF THE GUIDELINES  \n7. Applicability of the guidelines in case of riots and disturbances \n7.1 Whenever RBI advises the banks to extend rehabilitation assistance to the riot/ \ndisturbance affected persons, the aforesaid guidelines may broadly be fol lowed by banks for \nthe purpose. It should, however, be ensured that only genuine persons, duly identified by the \nState Administration as having been affected by the riots/ disturbances, are provided \nassistance as per the guidelines.  \n7.2. The issuance of ad vice to the banks by Reserve Bank of India on receipt of request/ \ninformation from State Government and thereafter issue of instructions by banks to their \nbranches generally results in delay in extending the assistance to riot-affected people. With \na view to ensuring quick relief to the affected persons, it has been decided that the District Collector, on occurrence of the riots/ disturbances, may ask the Lead Bank Officer to convene a meeting of the DCC, if necessary and submit a report to the DCC on the extent of \ndamage caused to life and property in the area affected by riots/disturbances. If the DCC is \nsatisfied that there has been extensive loss to life and property on account of the riots/ \ndisturbances, the relief as per the above guidelines may be extended to the people affected \nby the riots/ disturbances. In certain cases, where there are no District Consultative \nCommittees, the District Collector may request the convener of the State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee of the State to convene a meeting of the bankers to consider extension of relief \nto the affected persons. The report submitted by the Collector and the decision thereon of \nDCC/ SLBC may be recorded and should form a part of the minutes of the meeting. A copy \nof the proceedings of the meeting may be forwarded to the concerned Regional Office of the \nReserve Bank of India.  \n   \n57 \n \nSECTION \u2013III. Credit Flow To Agriculture -Agricultural Loans -Waiver Of Margin/Security \nRequirements \n \nKeeping in view the importance of flow of credit to agriculture, in particular to the smaller \nborrowers, banks may waive margin/security requirements for agricultural loans upto Rs 1 \nlakh and in the case of agri -business and agri -clinics for loans upto Rs. 5 lakh.  \n   \n58 \n \nCHAPTER VII: PARTICIPATION UNDER LEAD BANK SCHEME  \n \nSmall Finance Banks may be invited to SLBC meetings in their respective locations. For the \ncurrent year (2017-18), they will be only invitees to these meetings and would not be a part \nof the credit planning exercise.  \nSmall Finance Banks will be part of the credit planning exercise from the financial year 2018-\n19. Accordingly, in the respective locations, they will be participating in various fora of the \nlead bank scheme i.e. SLBC, DLCC/DLRC and BLBC as a regular member from the first \nquarter of 2018-19.  \nSmall Finance Banks may refer to the Master Circular on Lead Bank Scheme dated July 3 , \n2017  to obtain an understanding of the structure of the various fora and functioning of Lead \nBank Scheme which is available on RBI website: www.rbi.org.in . \n \n \n  \n \n   \n59 \n \nCHAPTER V III: GOVERNMENT SPONSORED SCHEMES  \nCredit Facilities To  SC/ST  and Minority Communities  \nSFBs will become part of credit planning exercise under Lead Bank Scheme from the year \n2018-19.

Applicability  \nThe provisions of these Directions shall apply to every Scheduled Commercial \nBank { including Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and excluding Regional Rural \nBanks(RRBs)} licensed to op erate in India by Reserve Bank of India.  \nCHAP TER II  \nBACKGROUND  \n2.1 Periodical but frequent occurrence  of natural calamity takes a heavy toll o n \nhuman life and cause wide spread damage to economic pursuits in one or the other \npart of the country. The devastation caused by natural calamities call s for massive \nrehabilitation effort  from  all agencies. The Central, State and local authorities draw \nprogrammes on economic rehabilitation for  the people affected by natural \ncalamities. The developmental role assigned to the commercial banks  including \nSmall Finance Banks  warrant their active support in reviving the economic \nactivities  of those affected by the occurrence of a natural calamity.  \n2.2 In terms of the National Disaster Management Framework, there are two funds \nconstituted viz. National Disaster Response Fund  (NDRF)  and State Disaster Page 3 of 13 \n Response Fund  (SDRF) for providing relief in the affected areas. This framework \ncurrently recognizes 12 types of natural calamities viz. cyclone, drought, \nearthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, hailstorm, landslide, avalanche, cloud burst, pest \nattack and cold wave/frost. Out o f these 12, for 4 calamities i.e. drought, \nhailstorms, pest attack and cold wave/frost, the Ministry of Agriculture is the nodal \npoint and for the remaining 8, the  Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal ministry  \nto make the necessary administrative arrangements. A slew of measures for relief \nare undertaken by the Sovereign (Central/State Government) from time to time  to \nprovide relief to the affected people including , inter alia, provision for input \nsubsidies , financial assistance to farmers including small and marginal farmers . \n2.3 The role of the schedule d commercial banks including Small Finance Bank s \n(SFBs) is to  provide  relief measure through rescheduling existing loans and \nsanctioning fresh loans as per the emerging requirement  of the borrowers. To \nenable banks  to take  uniform and concerted action expeditiously, these directions \nare issued covering four aspects viz. Institutional Fram ework (Chapter III ), \nRestructuring of Existing Loans ( Chapter IV ), Providing Fresh Loans ( Chapter V ) \nand Other Ancillary Relief Measures ( Chapter VI ). \nCHAPTER III  \nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK \n3.1 Establishing Policy/Procedures for dealing with Natural Calamities \nThe area,  time of occurrence and intensity of the natural calamity  cannot be \nanticipated . It is, therefore , imperative that banks have a blueprint of action duly \napproved by the Board of Directors for such eventualities so that the required relief \nand assistance is provided with utmost speed and without any loss of time. Further, \nall Divisional/ Zonal Offices  and branches of Scheduled C ommercial/ Small \nFinance  banks  should be familiar with these standing instructions . These standing \ninstructions will immediately come to force after the district/state authorities put in \nplace the requisite declaration.  It is essen tial that these instructions should also be \nmade available to the State Government authorities and all the District Collectors \nso that all concerned are aware about the action that  should be taken by the  \nconcerned authorities in the affected area.  \n Page 4 of 13 \n 3.2 Discretionary Powers to Divisional / Zonal Manager of banks  \nThe Divisional/Zonal Managers of scheduled commercial /SF banks must be vested \nwith certain discretionary powers to  avoid the need to seek fresh approval from \ntheir Central Office regarding the lin e of action decided by the District \nConsultative Committee /State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee. Some of the areas, \namong others where such discretionary powers are vital  may be the  adoption of \nscale of finance, extension of loan period,  margin, security, sanction  of new loan \nkeeping in view the total liability of the borrower arising out of the old loan where \nthe asset financed is damaged or lost due to the natural calamity and the new loan \nfinanced for creation/repair of such asset (s).  \n3.3 Meeting of State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) /District Consultative \nCommittee  (DCC)  \n3.3.1 In the event of an occurrence of a  natural calamity  which covers a  larger part \nof a State, the State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee convener bank should  convene a \nmeeting immediately . The committee, in collaboration with the State Government \nauthorities should  evolve a coordinated action plan for implement ing the relief \nprogramme.  If the calamity has affected only a small part of the s tate/few districts, \nthe convener of the District Consultative Committee of the affected district( s) \nshould convene a meeting immediately. In the special SLBC/DCC meeting, the \nposition of the  affected areas may be assessed so as to ensure speedy formulation \nand implementation of suitable relief measures . \n3.3.2  In the areas where the calamity is severe, the relief measure (s) implemented \nshould be reviewed periodically through a specially constituted Task Force/Sub-\nCommittee by way of weekly/fortnightly meetings  as decided by the SLBC/DCC.   \n3.4 Declaration of Natural Calamity  \n3.4.1 It is recognised that declaration of a natural calamity  is in the domain of the \nSovereign (Central / State Governments). The inputs received from the State \nGovernments reveal that there are no uniform procedures being followed for \ndeclaration of natural calamity and issue of declarations / certificates. These \ndeclarations/certificates are called by different names such as Annewari, Paisewari, \nGirdawari, etc. in different States. Nevertheless, the common thread to extend Page 5 of 13 \n relief measures including reschedulement of loans by banks, is that  the crop loss \nassessed s hould be 33% or more . For assessing this loss, while some States are \nconducting crop cutting experiments to determine the loss in crop yield, some \nothers are relying on the eye estimates/visual impressions.  \n3.4.2  In case of extreme situations such as wide -spread floods, etc. when it is \nlargely clear that most of the standing crops have been damaged and/or land and \nother assets have suffered a wide- spread damage, the matter be deliberated by State \nGovernment/District Authorities in the especially convened SL BC/DCC meetings \nwhere the concerned Government functionary/District Collector may explain the \nreasons for not estimating \u2018Annewari\u2019 (percentage of crop loss \u2013  by whatever name \ncalled) through crop cutting experiments and that the decision to provide relief for \nthe affected populace needs to be taken based on the eye estimate/visual \nimpressions.  \n3.4.3 In both the cases, however, DCCs/SLBC have to satisfy themselves fully that \nthe crop loss has been 33% or more before acting on these pronouncements.  \nCHAPTER IV \nRESTRUCTURUNG OF EXISTING LOANS  \nIn the event of a natural calamity, the repaying capacity of the people gets severely \naffected  due to the disruption of their  economic activities  and loss of economic \nassets.  Therefore, relief in loan  repayment , by restructuring the existing loan may \nbecome necessary . \n4.1. Agriculture Loans: Short -term Production Credit (Crop Loans)  \n4.1.1  All short -term loans, except those which are overdue at the time of \noccurrence of natural calamity, should be eligible for restructuring. The principal \namount of the short -term loan as well as interest due for repayment in the year of \noccurrence of the natural calamity may be converted into term loan.  \n4.1.2  The repayment period of  the restructured loan may vary depending on the \nseverity of the calamity, the impact on  loss of economic assets and distress  it \ncaused. A maximum repayment period of up to 2 years (including t he moratorium \nperiod of 1 year) should  be allowed if the loss is between 33% and 50% . If the crop Page 6 of 13 \n loss is 50% or more, repayment period may be extended up to a maximum of 5 \nyears (including the 1 year moratorium period).  \n4.1.3  In all restructured loan accounts, moratorium period of at least one year \nshould be considered. Banks should  also not insist on additional collateral security \nfor such restructured loans.  \n4.2 Agriculture Loans: Long term (Investment) Credit  \n4.2.1  The existing term loan installments should be rescheduled  keeping in view \nthe re paying capacity of the borrower and the nature of natural calamity viz.  \n4.2.1.1 Natural Calamities where only crop for that year is damaged and productive \nassets are not damaged.  \n4.2.1.2  Natural Calamities where the productive assets are partially or totally \ndamaged and borrowers are in need of a new loan.  \n4.2.1.3  In regard to natural calamity under category (4.2.1.1) above, the banks may \nreschedule the payment of installment during the year of natural calamity and \nextend the loan period by one year. Under this arrangement the installmen ts \ndefaulted wilfully in earlier years will not be eligible for rescheduling. The banks \nmay also have to postpone payment of interest by borrowers.  \n4.2.1.4  In regard to category (4.2.1.2) i.e. where the borrower\u2019s assets are \npartially/totally damaged, the rescheduling by way of extension of loan period may \nbe determined on the basis of overall repaying capacity of the borrower vis- a-vis \nhis total liability (old term loan, restructured crop loan, if any and the fresh \ncrop/term loan being given) less the subsidies received from the Government \nagencies, compensation available under the insurance schemes, etc. While the total \nrepayment period for the restructured/fresh term loan will differ on case -to-case \nbasis, generally it should not exceed a period of 5 years.  \n4.3 Other Loans  \n4.3.1 A view needs to be taken by SLBC/DCC depending on the severity of the \ncalamity as to whether a general reschedulement of all other loans (i.e. besides the \nagriculture loans as indicated above) such as loans granted for allied activities and Page 7 of 13 \n loans given to rural artisans, traders, micro/small industrial units or in case of \nextreme situations, medium enterprises is required. If such a decision is taken, \nwhile recovery of all the loans be postponed by the specified period, banks will \nhave to assess the requir ement of the individual borrowers in each such case and \ndepending on the nature of his account, repayment capacity and the need for the \nfresh loans, appropriate decisions shall be taken by the individual banks  \n4.3.2  The primary consideration before the banks in extending credit to any unit for \nits rehabilitation should be  based on  the viability of the venture after the \nrehabilitation programme is implemented.  \n4.4 Asset Classification  \nThe asset classification status of the restructured loans will be as under : \n4.4.1 The restructured portion of the short term as well as long- term loans may be \ntreated as current dues and need not be classified as NPA. The asset classification \nof these term loans would thereafter be governed by the revised terms and \nconditions. Nevertheless, banks are required to make higher provisions for such \nrestructured standard advances as prescribed by Department of Banking \nRegulation1 from time to time.  \n4.4.2. The asset classification for the remaining due s, which  does not form a part of \nthe restructured portion, will continue to be governed by the original terms and \nconditions  of its sanction . Consequently, the due s from the borrower shall be \nclassified by the lending bank under different asset classification categories viz. \nstandard, sub- standard, doubtful and loss.  \n4.4.3. Additional finance, if any, shall be treated as \u201cstandard asset\u201d and its future \nasset classification will be governed by the terms and conditions of its sanction.  \n4.4.4.  With the objective to ensure that banks are proactive in extending relief to \nthe affected persons, the benefit of asset classification of the restructured account \nas on the date of natural calamity will be available only if the restructuring is completed within a period of three months from the date of natural calamity. In the \nevent of extreme calamity, when the SLBC/DCC is of the view that this period will \n                                                            \n1 DBR\u2019s Master Directions on Prudential Guidelines on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning  Page 8 of 13 \n not be sufficient for the banks  to reschedule all the  affected  loans, it should \nimmediately approach the concerned  Regional Office of RBI detailing  the reasons \nfor seeking extension. Such requests will be considered on the merit of each case.  \n4.4.5  The accounts that are restructured for the second time or more on account of \nrecurrence of natural calamities should retain the same asset classification category \non restructuring. Accordingly, for a restructured standard asset, the subsequent \nrestructuring necessitated on account of  natural calamity would not be treated as \nsecond restructuring, i.e., the standard asset classification will be allowed  to be \nmaintained. However, a ll other restructuring norms will apply .  \n4.5 Utilization of Insurance Proceeds  \n4.5.1  While the above measures relating to rescheduling of loans are intended to \nprovide relief to the farmers, the insurance proceeds should, ideally, compensate \ntheir losse s. In terms of orders issued by the Department of Agriculture , \nCooperation and Farmers Welfare , the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana \n(PMFBY) has, replaced  the existing schemes of National Agricultural Insurance \nScheme (NAIS) & Modified National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (MNAIS)  \nwith effect from Kharif 2016.  Under the scheme  all agriculture loans are provide d \ninsurance cover for all stages of the crop cycle including post -harvest risks in \nspecified instances. Farmer s\u2019 details are required to be entered by banks in the \nunified portal for crop insurance which is available at  www.agri -insurance.gov.in  \nin order to facilitate assessment of coverage of crops insured, premiums deducted, etc.  \n4.5.2 While restructuring  the loans in areas  affected by  a natural calamit y, banks  \nshould also take into account the insurance proceeds, if any, receivable from the Insurance Company. They should adjust these proceeds to the \u2018restructured \naccounts\u2019 in cases where they have granted fresh loan to the borrower. However, banks should act wi th empathy and consider restructuring and granting fresh loans \nwithout waiting for the receipt of insurance claim, in cases where there is  \nreasonable certainty of receiving the claim.  \n \n Page 9 of 13 \n CHAPTER V  \nPROVIDING FRESH LOANS  \n5.1 Sanctioning of Fresh Loans \n5.1.1 Once the decision  to reschedule  loans is taken by SLBC/DCC, pending \nconversion of short -term loans, ba nks shall grant fresh crop loan to the affected \npeople  based on the scale of finance for the crop and the cultivation area, as per the \nextant guidelines2. \n5.1.2 The bank assistance in agriculture and allied activities (poultry, fishery, \nanimal husbandry, etc.) may also be  needed  for long term loans  for a variety of \npurposes such as repair of existing economic asset (s) and/or acquisition of new \nasset (s). Similarly, rural artisans, self -employed persons, micro and small industrial \nunits, etc. in the areas affected by  a natural calamit y may require fresh credit to \nsusta in their livelihood. Banks should assess the need  and decide on the quantum \nof loans to be granted to the affected borrowers taking into consideration, amongst \nothers, their credit requirement and the due procedure for sanctioning loans.  \n5.1.3. Banks shall also grant consumption loan up to \u20b9  10,000/ - to existing \nborrowers without any collateral. The limit may, however, be enhanced beyond \u20b9 \n10,000/ - at the bank\u2019s discretion . \n5.2 Terms and Conditions  \n5.2.1 Guarantee, Security and Margin  \n5.2.1.1 Credit should not be denied for want of personal guarantees. Where the \nbank\u2019s existing security has been eroded because of damage or destruction by \nfloods, assistance will not be denied merely for want of additional fresh security. \nThe fresh loan shall be granted even if the value of security (existing as well as th e \nasset to be acquired from the new loan) is less than the loan amount. For fresh \nloans, a sympathetic view will have to be taken.  \n5.2.1.2 Where the crop loan (which has been converted into term loan) was earlier \nsanctioned against personal security/ hypoth ecation of crop and the borrower is not \nable to offer charge/mortgage of land as security for the converted loan, she/he  \n                                                            \n2 Master circular on Kisan Credit card Scheme available @ www.rbi.org.in   Page 10 of 13 \n should not be denied conversion facility merely on the ground of his /her inability \nto furnish land as security. If the borrower has already taken a term loan against \nmortgage/charge on land, the bank should be content with a second charge for the \nconverted term loan. Banks  should not insist on third party guarantee for providing \nconversion facilit y. \n5.2.1.3 Where land is taken as security , in the absence of original title record, a \ncertificate issued by the Revenue Department officials may be accepted for \nfinancing to farmers who have lost proof of their title such as  title deed or \nregistration certificate issued to registered share -croppers.  \n5.2.1.4 Margin requirements may be waived or the grant/subsidy given by the \nconcerned State Government may be considered as margin.  \n5.3 Rate of Interest \nThe rates of interest will be in accordance with the directives of the Reserve Bank. \nWithin the areas of their discretion, however, banks are expected to take a \nsympathetic view of the difficulties of the borrowers and extend a concessional \ntreatment to calamity -affected people. In respect of current dues in default, no \npenal interest will be charged. The banks should also suitably defer the \ncompounding of interest charges. Banks may not levy any penal interest and \nconsider waiving penal interest, if any, already charged in regard to the loans \nconverted/rescheduled. Depending on the nature and severity of natural calamity, \nthe SLBC/ DCC shall take a view on the interest rate concession that could be \nextended to borrowers so that there is uniformity in approach among banks in \nproviding relief.  \nCHAPTER VI  \nOTHER ANCILLARY MEASURES  \n6.1 Relaxation on K now Your Customer (KYC) Norms   \nIt needs to be recognized that many persons displaced or adversely affected by a \nmajor calamity may not have access to their normal identification and personal \nrecords. In such cases a small account based on the photograph and signature or \nthumb impression rendered in front of the bank official shall be opened. The above \ninstructions will be applicable to cases where the balance i n the account does not Page 11 of 13 \n exceed \u20b9 50,000/ - or the amount of relief granted (if higher) and the total credit in \nthe ac count does not exceed \u20b91 ,00,000 /- or the amount of relief granted, (if higher) \nin a year.  \n6.2 Providing access to Banking Service \n6.2.1 Banks may operate its natural calamity affected branches from temporary \npremises under advice to  the concern ed Regional Office of RBI. For continuing the \ntemporary premise  beyond 30 days,  banks may obtain specific  approval from the \nconcerned Regional Office of RBI. Banks may also make arrangements to render \nbanking services in the affected areas by setting up satellite offices, extension \ncounters or mobile banking facilities etc. under intimation to RBI.  \n6.2.2 To meet the immediate cash requirement  of the affected people , due \nimportance may be given towards  restor ing the ATMs  or other alternate \narrangements maybe provided to avail such facilities.   \n6.2.3 Other measures that banks may initiate  at their discretion  to alleviate the \ncondition of the affected people  could be waiving ATM fees, increasing ATM \nwithdrawal limits; waiving overdra ft fees /early withdrawal penalty on time \ndeposits  /late fee for credit card/other loan installment payments  etc. and giving \noption to credit card holders to convert their outstanding balance to EMIs \nrepayable in 1- 2 years. Besides, all charges debited to t he farm loan account other \nthan the normal interest may be waived considering the hardship caused to the \naffected people.  \nCHAPTER VII  \nRIOTS AND DISTURBANCES: APPLICABILITY OF THE GUIDELINES  \nApplicability of the guidelines in case of riots and disturbances  \n7.1 Whenever RBI advises the banks to extend rehabilitation assistance to the riot/ \ndisturbance affected persons, the aforesaid guidelines may broadly be followed by \nbanks for the purpose. It should, however, be ensured that only genuine persons, \nduly identified by the State Administration as having been affected by the riots/ \ndisturbances, are provided assistance as per the guidelines.  Page 12 of 13 \n 7.2. The issuance of advice to the banks by Reserve Bank of India on receipt of \nrequest/ information from State Government  and thereafter issue of instructions by \nbanks to their branches generally results in delay in extending the assistance to \nriot-affected people. With a view to ensuring quick relief to the affected persons, it \nhas been decided that the District Collector, on occurrence of the riots/ \ndisturbances, may ask the Lead Bank Officer to convene a meeting of the DCC, if \nnecessary and submit a report to the DCC on the extent of damage caused to life \nand property in the area affected by riots/disturbances. If the DCC is satisfied that \nthere has been extensive loss to life and property on account of the riots/ \ndisturbances, the relief as per the above guidelines may be extended to the people \naffected by the riots/ disturbances. In certain cases, where there are no District \nConsultative Committees, the District Collector may request the convener of the \nState Level Bankers\u2019 Committee of the State to convene a meeting of the bankers \nto consider extension of relief to the affected persons. The report submitted by the \nCollect or and the decision thereon of DCC/ SLBC may be recorded and should \nform a part of the minutes of the meeting. A copy of the proceedings of the \nmeeting may be forwarded to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank \nof India.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Page 13 of 13 \n Appendix \nMaster Direction -  Reserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas  \nAffected by Natural Calamities ) Directions, 2017  \nList of circulars consolidated for the Master Direction \nSr. \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject \n1.

Procedure for enrollment / registration of brokers \nAgency banks may follow a simple procedure for enrolment/registration of brokers.  The \nbroker seeking enrolment/registration may submit the request for registration on their \nbusiness letterhead together with business data to the agency banks.  The agency \nbanks should allot a code number to the broker which should be quoted by the broker \non all applications tendered at the Receiving offices for claiming brokerage. \n2. Appointment of sub-agents by Agency banks \nIt has come to our notice that some banks designated/authorized by Reserve Bank of \nIndia (RBI) have engaged the services of other banks as brokers/agents for receiving \napplications and the latter are using the name of RBI in their publi city material and \nbillboards stating that RBI has appointed them as brokers for Relief/Savings bonds \nbusiness.  We advise that in cases where authorised banks engage the services of other banks/institutions as a broker or agent, the agency banks who have appointed \nthem are solely responsible for their activities as an agent/broker.  RBI's name should \nnot be used by such banks.  \n3. Delisting of brokers \nThe names of the dormant brokers, who have been dormant for say 2 years, may be \ndelisted after giving a due notice if, no fresh business is forthcoming from these brokers. \nB) PAYMENT & RATES OF BROKERAGE FOR SAVINGS BONDS  \n1. Rates of brokerage  \na. Brokerage at the rate of `  1.00 (Rupee One only) per `  100/- will be paid to \nbrokers registered/enrolled with agency banks on applications tendered for  \n \n \n  \n \n2 \ninvestment in the bonds in the form of Bond Ledger Account (BLA) at designated \nbranches on behalf of their clients and bearing their stamp.     \nb. No brokerage is payable in case the broker is one of the investors/applicants.  \n2. No TDS on payment of brokerage  \nNo tax is required to be deducted at source by the agency banks while making payment of brokerage in respect of the Relief/Savings bonds business canvassed by brokers in \nterms of Section 194 (H) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.                                                                  \n3. Brokerage claims \na. Agency banks are to settle the brokerage claims expeditiously, and in any \ncase, not later than 30 days from the date of subscription.  \nb. Agency banks are advised to first settle the brokerage claims and thereafter \nseek reimbursement from RBI.  \nc. As a measure towards improvement in customer service, agency banks may \narrange to pay the brokerage to the agents, on a monthly basis by credit to their \naccounts through ECS after obtaini ng requisite mandate from them.  \nd. Reimbursement of brokerage claims in respect of Relief/Savings bonds has \nbeen centralized at CAS Nagpur from July 01, 2002, and it has been decided that 90% of the brokerage due to agencies, on the basis of funds remitted/r eported to \nCAS as at the close of business of the month, will be paid on the 3\nrd working day of \nthe succeeding month. The balance 10% is to be settled on submission of Appendix IV statement. \n \nC) NOMINATION FACILITY FOR RELIEF/SAVINGS BONDS  \n1. A sole holder or all the joint holders (investors) of a Relief/Savings bond other than in the \nform of promissory note or bearer bond may nominate one or more persons who in the \nevent of death of the sole holder/all the joint holders, as the case may be, would be \nentitled to the Relief/Savings bond and to the payment thereon, provided that the person \nor each of the persons nominated is himself/herself competent to hold a similar bond.                                    \n2.

When nomination has been made in favour of two or more nominees, in the event of the \ndeath of either or any of them, the surviving nominee or nominees, as the case may be, \nshall be entitled to the Relief/Savings bond and payment thereon. \n4. A nomination made by the holder(s) of a Relief/Savings bond may be varied or cancelled \nby making a fresh nomination in the prescribed manner and intimating the same in \nwriting to the designated branch of the authorised public/private sector bank. \n5. If the nominee is a minor, the holder(s) of the Relief/Savings bond may appoint any person, not being a minor, to receive the proceeds of a Relief/Savings bond on behalf of \nthe nominee in the event of his/her/their death during the minority of the nominee. \n6.

Background \n \n1.1 The Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India launched a new \nprogramme known as National Rural Livelihoods Mission  (NRLM ) by \nrestructuring and replacing the Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) \nscheme with effect from Ap ril 01, 2013. Detailed \u2018Guidelines\u2019 were circulated to \nall Scheduled Commercial Banks including Regional Rural Banks vide RBI  circular  RPCD.GSSD.CO.No.81/09.01.03/2012- 13 dated June 27, 2013\n.  \n \n1.2 NRLM was renamed as DAY -NRLM  (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana -  \nNational Rural Livelihoods Mission)  w.e.f. March 29, 2016 and is the flagship \nprogram of Govt. of India for promoting poverty reduction through building strong institutions  of the poor, particularly women, and enabling these \ninstitutions to access a range of financial services and livelihoods services. DAY- NRLM is designed to be a highly intensive program and focuses on \nintensive application of human and material resources i n order to mobilize the \npoor into functionally effective community owned institutions, promote their financial inclusion and strengthen their livelihoods. DAY -NRLM complements \nthese institutional platforms of the poor with services that include financial a nd \ncapital services, production and productivity enhancement services, technology, knowledge, skills and inputs, market linkage, etc. The community institutions also offer a platform for convergence and partnerships with various stakeholders by building environment for the poor to access their rights and entitlements and public service.  \n \n1.3 A women\u2019s self -help group, coming together on the basis of mutual affinity \nis the primary building block of the DAY -NRLM community institutional design. \nDAY- NRLM focus es on building, nurturing and strengthening the institutions of \nthe poor women, including the SHGs and their Federations at village and higher levels. In addition, DAY -NRLM promotes livelihood institutions of rural  2 \n  \npoor. The  mission provides a continuous  hand- holding support to the \ninstituti ons of poor for a period of 5- 7 years till they come out of abject poverty. \nThe community institutional architecture put in place under DAY - NRLM will \nprovide support for a much longer duration and of a greater intensi ty.  \n \n1.4 The support from DAY -NRLM includes all round capacity building of the \nSHGs ensuring that the group functions effectively on all issues concerning their members, financial management, providing them with initial fund support to address vulnerabilities  and high cost indebtedness, formation and nurturing \nof SHG federations, making the federations evolve as strong support organizations, making livelihoods of the poor sustainable, formation and nurturing of livelihoods organizations, skill development of t he rural youth to \nstart their own enterprises or take up jobs in organized sector, enabling these institutions to access their entitlements from the key line departments, etc.  \n \n1.5 The implementation of DAY -NRLM has been in a Mission Mode since April, \n2013. D AY-NRLM adopts a demand driven approach, enabling the States to \nformulate their own State specific poverty reduction action plans. DAY -NRLM \nenables the State rural livelihoods missions to professionalize their human resources at State, district and block l evel. The State missions are capacitated \nto deliver a wide range of quality services to the rural poor. DAY -NRLM \nemphasizes continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector, and monitoring against targets of poverty reduction outcomes. The blocks and districts in which all the components of DAY -NRLM \nwill be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs, will be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas remaining will be non-intensive blocks and districts. The selections of intensive districts are done by the states based on the demographic vulnerabilities. It will be rolled out in a phased manner over the next 7 -8 years. All blocks in the country will become \nintensive blocks over time. The key features of DAY -NRLM have been \nfurnished in Annex I\n.  \n 3 \n  \n2. Women SHGs and their Federations \n \n2.1 Women SHGs under DAY -NRLM consist of 10- 20 persons. In case of \nspecial SHG s i.e. groups in the difficult areas, groups with disabled persons, \nand groups formed in remote tribal areas, this number may be a minimum of 5 persons.  \n \n2.2 DAY- NRLM promotes affinity based women Self \u2013 help groups.  \n \n2.3 Only for groups to be formed with Persons with disabilities, and other           \nspecial categories like elders, transgenders, DAY -NRLM will have both men \nand women in the self -help groups.  \n \n2.4 SHG is an informal group and registration under any Societies Act, State \ncooperative Act or a partnership firm is not mandatory vide Circular RPCD.No. \nPlan BC.13/PL -09.22/90- 91 dated July 24th, 1991.

Only such SHGs that have not received any RF \nearlier will be provided with RF, as corpus, with a minimum of \u20b9 10,000 and up \nto a maximum of \u20b9 15,000 per SHG. The purpose of RF is to strengthen their \ninstitutional and financial management capacity and build a good credit history within the group.  \n \n4. Capital Subsidy has been discontinued under DAY -NRLM:  \nNo Capital Subsidy will be sanctioned to any SHG from the date of implementation of DAY -NRLM.  \n 4 \n 5. Community Investment support Fund (CIF)  \n \nCIF will be provided to the SHGs in the intensive blocks, routed through the \nVillage level/ Cluster level Federations,  to be maintained in perpetuity by the \nFederations.  The CIF will be used, by the Federations, to advance loans to the \nSHGs and/or to undertake the common/collective socio- economic activities.  \n \n6. Introduction of Interest subvention:  \n \nDAY- NRLM has a provision for interest subvention, to cover the difference \nbetween the Lending Rate of the banks and 7%, on all credit from the banks/ \nfinancial institutions availed by women SHGs, for a maximum of \u20b9  3,00,000 per \nSHG. This will be available across the country in two ways:  \n \n(i) In 250 identified districts, banks will lend to the women SHGs @7% up to \nan aggregated loan amount of \u20b9  3,00,000/ -. The SHGs will also get additional \ninterest subvention of 3% on prompt payment, reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%.  \n \n(ii) In the remaining districts also, all women SHGs under DAY -NRLM are \neligible for interest subvention to the extent of difference between the lending \nrates and 7% for the loan up to \u20b9  3,00,000, subjected to the norms prescribed \nby the respective SRLMs. This part of the scheme will be operationalized by SRLMs.  \n \n(A separate circular on August 25, 2016 was issued to all Public and Private \nSector Banks containing the detailed guidelines on interest s ubvention and its \noperationalization across the country for the year 2016- 17 along with the list of \n250 identified districts.

This would mean assisting an SHG over a period of time, \nthrough repeat doses of credit, to enable them to access higher amounts of credit for taking up sustainable livelihoods  and improve on the quality of life.  \nSHGs can avail either Term Loan  (TL) or a Cash Credit Limit ( CCL) loan or \nboth based on the need. In case of need, additional loan can be sanctioned even though the previous loan is outstanding.  \nThe amount of credit u nder different facilities should be as follows:  \nCash Credit Limit ( CCL): In case of CCL, banks are advised to sanction \nminimum loan of \u20b9 5 lakhs to each eligible SHGs for a period of 5 years with a \nyearly drawing power (DP). The drawing power may be enhanced annually based on the repayment performance of the SHG. The drawing power may be calculated as follows:  \n\u2022 DP for First Year: 6 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b9 1 lakh \nwhichever is higher.  \n\u2022 DP for Secon d Year: 8 times of the corpus  at the time review/ \nenhancement  or minimum of \u20b9 2 lakh, whichever is higher  \n\u2022 DP for Third Year: Minimum of \u20b9 3 lakhs based on the Mi cro credit plan \nprepared by SHG  and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and \nthe previous credit History.  \n\u2022 DP for Fourth Year onwards: Minimum of \u20b9 5 lakhs based on the M icro \ncredit plan prepared by SHG  and appraised by the Federations /Support \nagency and the previous c redit History. \n \nTerm Loan:  In case of Term Loan, banks are advised to sanction loan amount \nin doses as mentioned below:  \n\u2022 First Dose: 6 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b9 1 lakh \nwhichever is higher.  7 \n \u2022 Second Dose: 8 times of the existing corpus or mi nimum of \u20b9 2 lakh, \nwhichever is higher  \n\u2022 Third Dose: Minimum of \u20b9 3 lakhs based on the Micro credit plan prepared \nby the SHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the \nprevious credit History  \n\u2022 Fourth Dose: Minimum of \u20b9 5 lakhs based on the Micro c redit plan \nprepared by the SHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit History  \nBanks should take necessary measures to ensure that eligible SHG are provided with repeat loans. Banks are advised to work with DAY -NRLM to \ninstitutionalize a mechanism for online submission of loan application of \nSHGs for tracking and timely disposal of application.  \n(Corpus is inclusive of revolving funds, if any, received by that SHG, its own savings, interest earning by SHG from on- lending to its members, income from \nother sources, and funds from other sources in case of promotion by other institutes/NGOs.)  \n7.3 Purpose of loan and repayment : \n7.3.1 The loan amount will be distributed among members based on the Micro \nCredit Plan prepared by the SHGs. The loans may be used by members for meeting social needs, high cost debt swapping, construction or repair of house, construction of toilets  and taking up sustainable \nlivelihoods by the individual members within the SHGs or to finance any viable common acti vity started by the SHGs.  \n7.3.2 Repayment schedule could be as follows:  \n\u2022 The First year/ first dose of loan will be repaid in 6- 12 months in \nmonthly/ quarterly instalments  \n \n\u2022 The Second year/ Second dose of loan will be repaid in 12- 24 \nmonths in monthly/ quarter ly instalments  \n\u2022 The Third year/ Third dose of loan will be repaid in 24 -36 months in \nmonthly/ quarterly instalments  8 \n \u2022 The loan from Fourth year/ Fourth dose onwards has to be repaid \nbetween 3 -6 years based on the cash flow in monthly/ quarterly \ninstallments.  \n7.4. Security and Margin: No collateral and no margin will be charged up to     \n`10.00 lakhs limit to the SHGs. No lien should be marked against savings bank \naccount of SHGs and no deposits should be insisted upon while sanctioning \nloans.  \n \n7.5. Dealing with Defaulters:  \n \n7.5.1 It is desirable that willful defaulters should not be financed under DAY -\nNRLM. In case willful defaulters are members of a group, they might be allowed to benefit from the thrift and credit activities of the group including the corpus built up with the assistance of Revolving Fund. But at the stage of accessing bank loan by SHG for financing economic activities by its members, the willful defaulters should not have the benefit of such bank loan until the outstanding loans are repaid. Wil lful defaulters of the group should not get \nbenefits under the DAY -NRLM Scheme and the group may be financed \nexcluding such defaulters while documenting the loan. However, banks should not deny loan to entire SHG on the pretext that spouse or other family members of individual members of SHG being a defaulter with the bank.  \nFurther, non- willful defaulters should not be debarred from receiving the loan.  \nIn case default is due to genuine reasons, Banks may follow the norms suggested for restructuring the account with revised repayment schedule.  \n \n8. Credit Target Planning \n \n8.1 Based on the Potential Linked Plan/State Focus Paper prepared by NABARD, SLBC sub -committee may arrive at the district- wise, block -wise and \nbranch- wise credit plan. The sub-  committee has  to consider the existing \nSHGs, New SHGs proposed, and number of SHGs eligible for fresh and repeat loans as suggested by the SRLMs to arrive at the credit targets for the states. The targets so decided should be approved in the SLBC and should be reviewed and monitored periodically for effective implementation.  \n 9 \n  \n8.2. The district -wise credit plans should be communicated to the DCC. The \nBlock -wise/Cluster -wise targets are to be communicated to the bank Branches \nthrough the Controllers . \n \n9. Post credit foll ow-up \n \n9.1 Loan pass books in regional languages may be issued to the SHGs which \nmay contain all the details of the loans disbursed to them and the terms and \nconditions applicable to the loan sanctioned. The passbook should be updated \nwith every transaction made by the SHGs. At the time of documentation and disbursement of loan, it is advisable to clearly explain the terms and conditions as part of financial literacy.  \n \n9.2 Bank branches may observe one fixed day in a fortnight to enable the staff \nto go to the fiel d and attend the meetings of the SHGs and Federations to \nobserve the operations of the SHGs and keep a track of the regularity in the SHGs meetings and performance.  \n \n10. Repayment:  \n \nPrompt repayment of the loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks shall take all possible measures, i.e. personal contact, \norganization of joint recovery camps with District Mission Management Units (DPMUs) / DRDAs to ensure the recovery of loans. Keeping in view, the importance of loan recovery, banks should prepare a list of defaulting SHGs under DAY -NRLM every month and furnish the list in the BLBC, DLCC \nmeetings. This would ensure that DAY -NRLM staff at the district/ block level \nwill assist the bankers in initiating the repayment.  \n \n11. Deputation of the bank officials to SRLMs \n \nAs a measure of strengthening the (DPMUs) / DRDAs and for promoting a \nbetter credit environment, deputation of the bank officials to DPMUs/ DRDAs \nhas been suggested. Banks may consider deputing officers at various levels to the S tate Governments/DRDAs in consultation with them.  \n \n 10 \n 12. Supervision and monitoring of the Scheme \n \nBanks may set up DAY -NRLM cells at Regional/Zonal offices. These cells \nshould periodically monitor and review the flow of credit to the SHGs, ensure \nthe imple mentation of the guidelines to the scheme, collect data from the \nbranches and make available consolidated data to the Head office and the \nDAY- NRLM units at the districts/ blocks. The cell should also discuss this \nconsolidated data in the SLBC, BLBC and DCC  meetings regularly to maintain \nthe effective communication with the state staff and all banks.  \n \n12.1 State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee: SLBCs shall constitute a sub-\ncommittee on SHG -bank linkage. The sub- committee should consist of \nmembers from all banks operating in the State, RBI, NABARD, CEO of SRLM, \nrepresentatives of State Rural Development Department, Secretary -Institutional \nFinance and Representatives of Development Departments etc. The sub-  \ncommittee shall meet once in a month with a specific agenda of rev iew, \nimplementation and monitoring of the SHG -Bank linkage and the issues/ \nconstraints in achievement of the credit target. The decisions of SLBCs should \nbe derived from the analysis of the reports of the sub- committee.  \n \n12.2 District Coordination Committee: T he DCC (DAY- NRLM sub -\ncommittee) shall regularly monitor the flow of credit to SHGs at the district level \nand resolve issues that constrain the flow of credit to the SHGs at district level. \nThis committee meeting should have participation of LDMs, AGM of NA BARD, \ndistrict coordinators of the banks and DPMU staff representing DAY -NRLM and \noffice bearers of SHG federations.  \n \n12.3 Block level Bankers Committee: The BLBC shall meet regularly and  \ntake up issues of SHG bank linkage at the block level. In this Committee, the SHGs/ Federations of the SHGs should be included as members to raise their voice in the forum. Branch wise status of SHG credit shall be monitored at the \nBLBC (Annex B and C may be used for the purpose)  \n \n12.4 Reporting to Lead District Managers: The branches may furnish the \nprogress report and the delinquency report u nder various activities of DAY -\nNRLM in the format at Annex \u2018 IV\u2019 and \u2018Annex V\u2019  to the LDM every month for 11 \n onward submission to Special Steering Committee/sub- committee constituted \nby SLBC.  \n \n12.5 Reporting to RBI : Banks may give a state- wise consolidated report on the \nprogress made on DAY -NRLM to RBI/NABARD at quarterly intervals.  \n \n12.6 LBR returns : Existing procedure of submitting LBR returns to be continued \nduly furnishing the correct code.  \n \n13. Data  Sharing:  \nData sharing on a mutually agreed format / interval may be provided to DAY -\nNRLM or State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs) for initiating various \nstrategies including recovery etc. The financing banks are advised to regularly \nshare data on loans to SHGs with the DAY- NRLM or SRLMs, directly from the \nCBS platform.  \n \n14. DAY- NRLM support to the bankers:  \n \n14.1 SRLM would develop strategic partnerships with major banks at various \nlevels. It would invest in creating enabling conditions for both the banks  and the \npoor for a mutually rewarding relationship.  \n \n14.2 SRLM will assist the SHGs through imparting financial literacy, extending \ncounselling services on savings, credit and training on Micro- investment \nPlanning embedded in capacity building.  \n \n14.3 SRLMs will ex tend support to banks for improving quality of banking services \nto poor clients including follow -up for recovery of over dues if any, by utilising the \nservices of  customer relationship managers  (i.e Bank Mitra/ Sakh i) with every \nbank branch involved in financing of SHGs. Banks are advised to extend necessary cooperation to Bank Mitra/Sakhi for performing their roles.  \n \n14.4 Leveraging IT mobile technologies and institutions of poor, youth or SHG \nmember as business facilitators and business correspondents.  \n \n14.5.  Community Based Repayment mechanism (CBRM) : One exclusive \nsub - committee for SHG Bank Linkage may be formed at village/cluster/ block \nlevel which will provide support to the banks in ensuring proper utilization of 12 \n loan amount, recovery etc. The bank link age sub -  committee members from \neach village level federation along with project staff will meet once in a month \nunder the chairmanship of the Branch Manager in the branch premises with the agenda items relating to bank linkage.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  13 \n Annex I  \n \nKey Features of DAY -NRLM  \n \n1. Universal Social Mobilization: To begin with, DAY -NRLM would ensure \nthat at least one member from each identified rural poor household, preferably \na woman, is brought under the Self Help Group (SHG) network in a time bound \nmanner. Subsequently, both women and men would be organized for addressing livelihoods issues i.e. farmers organizations, milk producers\u2019 cooperatives, weavers associations, etc. All these institutions are inclusive and no poor would be left out of them. DAY -NRLM would ensure adequate \ncoverage of vulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of the \nbeneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are minorities and 3% are persons with \ndisability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of BPL families.  \n \n2. Participatory Identification of poor (PIP): The experience from SGSY  \nsuggests that the current BPL list has large inclusion and exclusion errors. To widen the target groups beyond the BPL list and to include all the needy poor, DAY- NRLM will undert ake community based process i.e. participation of the \npoor in the process of identifying the target group. Participatory process based \non sound methodology and tools (social mapping and well -being  \ncategorization, deprivation indicators) and also locally understood and  \naccepted criterion ensures local consensus that inadvertently reduces the \ninclusion and exclusion errors, and enables formation of the groups on the basis of mutual affinity. Over the years, the participatory method of identifying the poor hav e been developed and applied successfully in the states like AP, \nKerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha.  \n \nThe households identified as poor through the P.I.P process will be accepted \nas DAY- NRLM target group and will be eligible for all the benefits under the \nprogramme. The list finalized after PIP process will be vetted by the Gram \nSabha and approved by the Gram Panchayat.  \n \n \n 14 \n Till the PIP process is undertaken by the State in a particular district/Block, the \nrural households already included in the official BPL li st will be targeted under  \nDAY- NRLM. As already provided in the Framework for implementation of DAY -\nNRLM, up to 30% of the total membership of the SHGs may be from among the population marginally above the poverty line, subject to the approval of the BPL me mbers of the group. This 30% also includes the excluded poor, those \nwho are really as poor as those included in BPL list but their name does not figure in the list.  \n \n3. Promotion of Institutions of the poor: Strong institutions of the poor such \nas SHGs and their village level and higher level federations are necessary to provide space, voice and resources for the poor and for reducing their dependence on external agencies. They empower them and also act as instruments of knowledge and technology dissemination,  and hubs of \nproduction, collectivization and commerce. DAY -NRLM, therefore, would focus \non setting up these institutions at various levels. In addition, DAY -NRLM would \npromote specialized institutions like Livelihoods collectives, producers\u2019 cooperative/c ompanies for livelihoods promotion through deriving economies of \nscale, backward and forward linkages, and access to information, credit, technology, markets etc. The Livelihoods collectives would enable the poor to optimize their limited resource.  \n \n4. Stren gthening all existing SHGs and federations of the poor. There are \nexisting institutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of NGOs. DAY -NRLM would strengthen all existing institutions of the \npoor in a partnership mode. The self -help promoting institutions both in the \nGovernment and in the NGO sector would promote social accountability practices to introduce greater transparency. This would be in addition to the mechanisms that would be evolved by SRLMs and state governments. The learning from one another underpins the key processes of learning in DAY -\nNRLM.  \n \n5. Emphasis on Training, Capacity building and skill building:  DAY-\nNRLM would ensure that the poor are provided with the requisite skills for 15 \n managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their existing  \nlivelihoods, enhancing their credit absorption capacity and credit worthiness, \netc. A multi -pronged approach is envisaged for continuous capacity building of \nthe targeted families, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders. Particular focus would be on developing and engaging community professionals and community resource persons for capacity building of SHGs and their federations and other collectives. DAY- NRLM would m ake extensive use of ICT to make knowledge \ndissemination and capacity building more effective.  \n \n6. Revolving Fund and Community investment support Fund (C.I.F): A  \nRevolving Fund would be provided to eligible SHGs as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thri ft and accumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit \nneeds in the long- run and immediate consumption needs in the short -run. The \nC.I.F would be a corpus and used for meeting the members\u2019 credit needs directly and as catalytic capital for leveragi ng repeat bank finance. The C.I.F \nwould be routed to the SHGs through the Federations. The key to coming out \nof poverty is continuous and easy access to finance, at reasonable rates, till they accumulate their own funds in large measure.  \n \n7. Universal Financial Inclusion: DAY- NRLM would work towards achieving  \nuniversal financial inclusion, beyond basic banking services to all the poor households, SHGs and their federations. DAY -NRLM would work on both \ndemand and supply side of Financial Inclusion. On the demand side, it would promote financial literacy among the poor and provides catalytic capital to the SHGs and their federations. On the supply side, it would coordinate with the financial sector and encourage use of Information, Communication & Technology (IC T) based financial technologies, business correspondents and \ncommunity facilitators like \u2018Bank Mitras\u2019. It would also work towards universal coverage of rural poor against loss of life, health and assets. Further, it would \nwork on remittances, especially i n areas where migration is endemic.  \n \n8. Provision of Interest Subvention: The rural poor need credit at low rate of  \ninterest and in multiple doses to make their ventures economically viable. In \norder to ensure affordable credit, DAY -NRLM has a provision for subvention on \ninterest rate above 7% per annum for all eligible SHGs, who have availed loans 16 \n from mainstream financial institutions.  \n \n9. Funding Pattern: DAY- NRLM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the \nfinancing of the programme would be shared between the Centre and the \nStates in the ratio of 75:25 (90:10 in case of North Eastern States including Sikkim; completely from the Centre in case of UTs). The Central allocation earmarked for the States would broadly be distributed in relation to the incidence of poverty in the States.  \n \n10. Phased Implementation: Social capital of the poor consists of the \ninstitutions of the poor, their leaders, community professionals and more importantly community resource persons (poor women whose lives have been transformed through t he support of their institutions). Building up social capital \ntakes some time in the initial years, but it multiplies rapidly after some time. If the social capital of the poor does not play the lead role in DAY -NRLM, then it \nwould not be a people\u2019s progra mme. Further, it is important to ensure that the \nquality and effectiveness of the interventions is not diluted. Therefore, a phased implementation approach is adopted in DAY -NRLM. DAY- NRLM would reach \nall districts by the end of 12th Five- year Plan.  \n \n11. Intensive blocks. The blocks that are taken up for implementation of DAY -\nNRLM, \u2018intensive blocks\u2019, would have access to a full complement of trained professional staff and cover a whole range of activities of universal and intense social and financial inclusion, livelihoods, partnerships etc. However, in the remaining blocks or non- intensive blocks, the activities may be limited in scope \nand intensity.  \n \n12. Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs). RSETI concept is  \nbuilt on the model pioneered by Rural D evelopment Self Employment Institute \n(RUDSETI) \u2013 a collaborative partnership between SDME Trust, Syndicate \nBank and Canara Bank. The model envisages transforming unemployed youth into confident self - employed entrepreneurs through a short duration \nexperiential learning programme followed by systematic long duration hand holding support. The need- based training builds entrepreneurship qualities, \nimproves self -confidence, reduces risk of failure and develops the trainees into 17 \n change agents. Banks are fully involved in selection, training and post training \nfollow up stages. The needs of the poor articulated through the institutions of the poor would guide RSETIs in preparing the participants/trainees in their pursuits of self -employment and enterprises. DAY -NRLM would encourage \npublic sector banks to set up RSETIs in all districts of the country.                                                  ---------------------------------                          18 \n                                                                                                                                   Annex II  \n \nInterest subvention scheme for Women SHGs \nI.

This subv ention will be available to all \nthe Banks on the condition that they make SHG credit available at 7% p.a. in \nthe 250 dis tricts. \n \n       iv.  RRBs  and Coop erative Banks will be subv ented to the extent of                    \ndifference between the ma ximum lending rates (as specified by NABARD) \nand 7% subject to the maximum limit of 5.5%.  This subv ention will be \navailable to all RRBs and Coope rative Banks on the condition that they \nmake SHG credit available at 7% p.a. in the 250 districts.

For the Term lo ans: A term loan account where all of the interest payments \nand/or  instalments of principal were paid within 30 days of the due date during \nthe tenur e of the loan,  would  be conside red as an account having prompt \npayment. \nAll prompt  payee SHG accounts  as on the end of the reporting quarter will be \neligible for  the additional  interest subv ention of 3%. The banks should credit \nthe amount  of 3% interest subv ention to the eligible SHG loan accounts  \nand thereafter seek the reimbursement.  \nvi. The Intere st Subvention scheme shall be implem ented for all commercial \nbanks ( excluding RRBs) throug h a Noda l Bank selected by the Ministry of \nRural Development. \nvii.

For process of submis sion of claims  by RRBs and Coop erative Banks, \n    detailed guidelines  will be issued by NABARD  \n \nII. Interest sub vention sc heme for Category II Districts  \n    (O ther than 250 districts). \nFor category II districts, compris ing of distri cts other than the above 250   \ndistricts, all wom en SHGs under DAY- NRLM  will continue to be eligible for \ninterest subv ention to avail the loan f acility at an interest rate of  7%. The \nfunding for this subv ention will be provid ed to the State Rur al Livelihoods  \nMissions  (S.R.L.Ms).  The State-wise dis tribution of the provision unde r this \nbudg et head would be determined each year. In the Category II districts, Banks \nwill charge the SHGs as per their respective lendi ng norms  and the difference \nbetween the lending rates and 7% subjected to a maximum limit of 5.5% will  be \nsubv ented in the loan accounts  of the SHGs by the SRLM. In pursuance of the \nabove, the salient features and the operational guidelin es in respect of the \ninterest subv ention for the category II districts, are as follows: \n \n 21 \n (A) Role  of the Banks : \nAll banks who are operating on the Core  Banking Solution (CBS) are required \nto furnish the details of the Credit disbursement  and Credit outstanding of  the \nSHGs across all districts in the desired format as suggested by the MoRD, \ndirectly from the C BS platform, to the Ministry of Rural Development (through  \nFTP) and to the SRLMs. The information should be provid ed on a monthly \nbasis to facilitate the calculation and disburs ement of the Interest Subvention \namount  to SHGs. \nB) Role  of the Stat e Governments: \ni. All wom en SHGs, compris ing of more  than 70% BPL or rural poor memb ers \n(rural poor a s per the Participatory Identification Process) are regarded as \nSHGs under DAY- NRLM . Such SHGs, comprising  of rural poor member s from \nthe intended DAY- NRLM  target group will be eligible for in terest subv ention on \ncredit up to ` 3 lakhs at the rate of 7% per annum  on pr ompt  repayment.  \nii. This  scheme  will  be  implem ented  by  the  State  Rural  Livelihood  \nMissions (S RLMs). SRLMs will provide interest subv ention to the eligible SHGs \nwho have accessed  loan from Com mercial and Coope rative Banks. The \nfundi ng for th is subv ention will be met out of the Central Alloc ation: State \nContrib ution in the ratio of 75:25.  \niii.   The SHGs will be subvented with the extent of difference between the  lending \nRate of  the  banks  and  7%  subjected  to a maximum limit of 5.5% by the  \nSRLMs, directly on a monthly / quarterly  basi s.  An e -transfer of the \nsubvention amount will be made by the SRLM to the loan accounts of the SHGs who have repaid promptly.  \n \n     iv.     Women SHGs who have availed capital subs idy unde r SGSY in their                      \n         e xisting loans,  will not be eligible for benefit of Interest Subvention for their    \n         subs isting loan unde r this s cheme.                             \n \nv.     SRLMs should submit Qu arterly Utilization Certificate indicating subv ention \namounts  transferred to t he Loan accounts of the eligible SHGs \n              T he States with state  specific

This Master Circular consolidates the relevant guidelines issued by the Bank on Kisan \nCredit Card scheme upto June 30, 2017 as listed in the Appendix . \n2. The Master Circular has been placed on the RBI website http://www.rbi.org.in .  \nYours faithfully  \n \n(Ajay Kumar Misra ) \nChief General Manager  \nEncl: As above  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 2 of 15 \n Master circular on the Kisan Credit Card (KCC)  Scheme  \n 1 Introduction  \n The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was introduced in 1998  for issue of Kisan Credit Cards \nto farmers on the basis of their holdings for uniform adoption by the banks so that farmers \nmay use them to readily purchase agriculture inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc. \nand draw cash for  their production needs. The scheme was further extended for the \ninvestment credit requirement  of farmers viz. allied and non -farm activities  in the year 2004 . \nThe scheme  was further revisited in 2012 by a working Group under the Chairmanship of Shri \nT. M. Bhasin, CMD, Indian Bank with a view to simplify the scheme and facilitate issue of \nElectronic Kisan Credit Cards. The s cheme provides  broad guidelines to banks for \noperationalizing the KCC scheme. Implementing banks will have the discretion to adopt the \nsame to suit institution/location specific requirements . \n2  \n \n  Applicability of the Scheme  \nThe Kisan  Credit Card Scheme detailed in the ensuing paragraphs is to be implemented by \nCommercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks and Cooperatives . \n3   Objective  / Purpose   \nThe Kisan Credit Card s cheme aims at providing adequate and timely credit support from the \nbanking system under a single window with flexible and simplified procedure to the farmers \nfor their cultivation and other needs as indicated below : \n a. To meet the short term credit requ irements for cultivation of crops ; \n b. Post-harvest  expenses ; \n c. Produ ce m arketing loan ; \n d. Consumption requirements of farmer household ; \n e. Working capital for maintenance of farm assets and ac tivities allied to agriculture;  \n    f.   Investment credit requirement for agriculture and allied activities .   \n  Note : The aggregate of components \u2018a\u2019 to \u2018e\u2019  above will form the short term credit limit \nportion and the aggregate of components under \u2018f\u2019 will form the long term credit limit \nportion.  \n4 Eligibility  \n i. Farmers - individual /joint borrowers who are owner cultivators ; \n ii. Tenant farmers, oral lessees & share c roppers ; \n iii. Self Help Groups (SHGs) or Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) of f armers including tenant \nfarmers, share croppers etc.  \n \n Page 3 of 15 \n 5 Fixation of credit limit / Loan amount  \n The credit limit under the Kisan Credit Card may be fixed as under :  \n 5.1 All farmers other than marginal farmers1 : \n  5.1.1 The short term limit t o be arrived for the first year ( For cultivating  single crop in \na year ): \n   Scale of finance for the crop (as decided by District Level Technical \nCommittee) x Extent of area cultivated + 10 % of limit towards post -\nharvest/household / consumption requirements + 20% of limit towards repairs \nand maintenance expenses of farm assets + crop insurance and/or  accident \ninsurance including PAIS, health insurance  & asset insurance. \n  5.1.2 Limit for second & subsequent year  \n  First year limit for crop cultivation purpose arrived at as above plus 10% of the \nlimit towards cost escalation / increase in scale of finance for every successive \nyear (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year) and estimated t erm loan component for the \ntenure of Kisan Credit Card, i.e., five years. ( Illustration I ) \n  5.1.3 For cultivating  more than one crop in a year  \n The limit is to be fixed as above depending upon the crops cultivated as per \nproposed cropping pattern for the first year  plus a n additional 10% of the limit \ntowards cost escalation / increase in scale of finance for every successive year \n(2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year). It is assumed that the farmer adopts the same \ncropping pattern for the succeeding four years. In case the cropping pattern \nadopted by the farmer is changed in the subsequent year, the limit may be \nreworked. (Illustration I ) \n  5.1.4 Term loan  for investment  \nThe ter m loan for investment is to be made towards land development, minor \nirrigation, purchase of farm equipment and allied agricultural activities. The \nbanks may fix the quantum of credit for term and working capital limit for \nagricultural and allied activities, etc., based on the unit cost of th e asset/s \nproposed to be acquired by the farmer, the allied activities already being \nundertaken on the farm, the bank's judgment on repayment capacity vis -a-vis \ntotal loan burden devolving on the farmer, including existing loan obligations.  \n   The long term loan limit  should be  based on the proposed investment (s) during \nthe five year period and the bank's perception on the repaying capacity of the \nfarmer . \n \n \n                                                            \n1 Farmers with landholding of up to 1 hectare (Marginal Farmers). Farmers with a landholding of more than 1 hectare and up to 2 hectares \n(Small Farmers).  \n Page 4 of 15 \n   5.1.5 Maximum Permissible Limit  \n   The short term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the  estimated long term \nloan requirement will be the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) and  is to be  \ntreated as the Kisan Credit Card l imit. \n  5.1.6 Fixation of Sub -limits  \n   i. Short term loans and term loans are governed by different interest rates. At \npresent, short term crop loans  upto \u20b9 3 lakh are covered under Interest \nSubvention Scheme/Prompt Repayment Incentive scheme of the Government \nof India2. Further, repayment schedul e and norms are different for short term \nand term loans. Hence, in order to have operational and accounting \nconvenience, the card limit is to be bifurcated into separate sub -limits for short \nterm cash credit limit cum savings account  and term loans . \n   ii. Drawing limit  for short term cash credit should be fixed based on the \ncropping pattern . The amount(s) for crop production, repair  and maintenance of \nfarm assets and consumption may be allowed to be drawn as per the \nconvenience of the farmer. In case th e revision of scale of finance for any year \nby the district level technical committee exceeds the notional hike of 10% \ncontemplated while fixing the five year limit, a revised  drawable limit may be \nfixed in consultation with the farmer . In case such revisions require the card \nlimit itself to be enhanced (4th or 5th year), the same may be done and the \nfarmer be so advised .  \niii. For term loans, installments may be allowed to be withdrawn based on the \nnature of investment and repayment schedule drawn as  per the economic life \nof the proposed investments. It is to be ensured that at any point of time the \ntotal liability should be within the drawing limit of the concerned year . \niv. Wherever the card limit / liability so arrived warrants additional security, the \nbanks may take suitable collateral as per their policy.  \n     \n 5.2 For Marginal Farmers  \n  A flexible limit of \u20b9  10, 000 to \u20b9 50, 000 may be provided (as Flexi KCC) based on the \nland holding and crops grown including post -harvest warehouse storage related credit \nneeds and other farm expenses, consumption needs, etc., plus small term loan \ninvestment (s) like purchase of farm equipment( s), establ ishing mini dairy/ backyard \npoultry as per assessment of the Branch Manager without relating it to the value of \nland. The composite KCC limit is to be fixed for a period of five years on this basis.  \n  Wherever higher limit is required due to change in cropping pattern and / or scale of \nfinance, the limit may be arrived at as per th e estimation indicated at para 4.1  \n(Illustration II ) \n                                                            \n2 Please refer to guidelines on Interest Subvention Scheme on crop loans as announced by GoI and issued by RBI from time to time . Page 5 of 15 \n 6 Disbursement  \n 6.1 The short term component of the KCC limit is in the nature of revolving cash credit \nfacility. There should be no restriction in number of debits and credits. The drawi ng limit \nfor the current season/ year could be allowed to be drawn using any of the following \ndelivery channels.  \n  i. operation  through branch ; \n  ii. operation  using c heque facility ; \n  iii. withdrawal through ATM /d ebit cards  \n  iv. operation  through Business Correspondents and \u2018banking outlet/part -time \nbanking outlet \u20193 \n  v. operation throu gh PoS available in Sugar Mills/ Contract farming companies, \netc., especially for tie -up advances ; \n  vi. operations through PoS  available with input dealers ; \n  vii. Mobile  based transfer transactions at agricultural input dealers and mandies.  \nNote  : (v), (vi) & ( vii) to be introduced as early as possible so as to reduce \ntransaction costs of both the bank as well as the farmer . \n     6.2 The long term loan for investment purposes may be drawn as per installment fixed.  \n7  Issue of Electronic Kisan Credit Card s  \nAll new KCC must be issued as smart card cum debit card as laid down in Part II of the \nAnnex. Further, at the time of renewal of existing KCC; farmers must be issued smart card \ncum debit card.  \nThe short term credit  limit and the term loan limit are two distinct components of the \naggregate KCC limit bearing different rates of interest and repayment periods. Until a \ncomposi te card could be issued with appropriate software to separately account transactions \nin the sub limits, two separate electronic cards may be issued for all new/renewed cards . \n8 Validity/ Renewal  \n i. Banks may determine the validity period of KCC and its periodic review . \n ii. The review may result in continuation of the facility, enhancement of  limit or \ncancellation of the limit/ withdrawal of the facility  depending upon increase in cropping \narea/ pattern and performance of the borrower. \n iii. When the  bank has granted extension and/ or re-schedule the period of repayment on \naccount of natural calamities affecting the farmer, the period for reckoning the status of \noperations as satisfactory or otherwise would get extended together with the extended \namount  of limit. When the proposed extension is beyond one crop season, the \naggregate of debits for which extension is granted is to be transferred to a separate \nterm loan account with stipulation for repayment in installments.  \n                                                            \n3 DBR\u2019s Circular on Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy - Revision of Guidelines  Page 6 of 15 9 Rate of Interest (ROI) :  \nThe rate of i nterest will be  as stipulated in DBR Master Directions on Interest Rate on \nAdvances . \n10 Repayment Period : \n10.1 The repayment period may be fixed by banks as per the anticipated harvesting and \nmarketing period for the crops for which the loan has been granted. \n10.2 The term loan component will be normally repayable within a period of 5 years \ndepending on the type of acti vity/investment as per the existing guidelines applicable  \nfor investment credit.  \n10.3 Financing banks may, at their discre tion, provide longer repayment period for term loan \ndepending on the type of investment.  \n11 Margin  \nTo be decided by banks . \n12 Security  \n12.1 Security will be applicable as per RBI guidelines prescribed from time to time.  \n12.2 Security requirement may be as under :  \ni. Hypothecation of crops :  For KCC  limit upto \u20b9 1.00 lakh  banks are to waive\nmargin/security requirements .\nii. With tie -up for recovery : Banks may  consider sanctioning loans on \nhypothecation of crops up to card limit of \u20b9 3.00 lakh without insisting on \ncollateral security.\niii. Collateral security : Collateral security  may be obtained at the discretion o f Bank\nfor loan limits above \u20b9 1.00 lakh in case of non-tie -up and above \u20b9 3.00 lakh in \ncase of tie -up advances.\niv. In states  where banks have the facility of on -line creation of charge on the land \nrecords, the same shall be ensured.\n13. O ther features\nUniformity to be adopted in respect of following : \n13.1 The applicable interest s ubvention / incentive for prompt repayment4 as adv ised by \nGovernment of India and/ or State Governments. The bankers will give adequate \npublicity of the  facility  so that maximum farmers may benefit from the scheme. \n13.2  Besides the mandatory crop insurance, the KCC holder should hav e the option to avail \nthe benefit of any type of a sset insurance, accident insurance (including PAIS), h ealth \ninsurance (wherever product is available) and have premium paid through his /her KCC \naccount. Premium has to be borne by the farmer/bank according t o the terms of the \nscheme. Farmer beneficiaries should be made aware of the insurance cover available \n4 Currently not applicable to Small Finance Banks/urban  & metro  branches of Private Sector Banks.  Page 7 of 15 \n and their consent (except in case of crop insurance, it being mandatory) is to be \nobtained, at the application stage itself.  \n 13.3 A one -time documentati on5 at the first time of availment of KCC loan and thereafter \nsimple declaration (about crops grown/ proposed) by farmer from the second year \nonwards.  \n \n14 Classification of account as NPA :  \n 14.1 The extant prudential norms on income recognition, asset -classification and \nprovisioning6 will apply for loans granted under the KCC Scheme.  \n 14.2 Charging of interest is to be done uniformly as is applicable to agricultural advance s. \n15 Processing fee , inspection charges and other charges  may be decided by banks.  \n16 Other conditions while implementing the revised guidelines of KCC Scheme :  \n 16.1 In case the farmer applies for loan against the wa rehouse receipt of his produce, the \nbanks would consider such requests as per the established procedure and guidelines. \nHowever, when such loans are sanctioned, these should be linked with the crop loan \naccount, if any , and the crop loan outstanding in the account could be settled at the \nstage of disbursal of the pledge loan, if the far mer so desires.  \n 16.2 The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) will design the KCC card to be \nadopted by all the banks with their branding.  \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n                                                            \n5 Documentation as per banks internal guidelines  \n6 DBR\u2019s Master Directions on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning Norms  Page 8 of 15 \n Illustration I  \n A.

Till such time, UIDAI becomes widespread, if the \nbanks want to get started without inter -operability using their existing centralized bio metric \ninfrastructure, banks may do so.  \n Banks may choose to issue EMV (Europay, MasterCard  and VISA, a global standard for \ninteroperation of integrated circuit cards) and RUPAY  compliant chip cards with magnetic \nstripe and pin with ISO IIN.  \n Further, the biometric authentication and smart cards may follow the common open standards \nprescribed by  IDRBT and IBA. This will enable them to transact seamlessly with input dealers \nas also enable them to have the sales proceeds credited to their accounts when they sell \ntheir output at mandies, procurement centers, etc.  \n  3 Delivery Channels :  \n The following delivery channels shall be put in place to start with so that the Kisan Credit \nCard is used by the farmers to effectively transact their operations in their KCC account.  \n 1. Withdrawal through ATMs / Micro ATM  \n 2. Withdrawal through BCs usi ng smart cards.  \n 3. PoS machine through input dealers  \n 4. Mobile Banking with IMPS capabilities / IVR  \n 5. Aadhaar enabled Cards.  \n4. Mobile Banking / Other Channels :  \n Provide Mobile banking functionality for KCC Cards / Accounts as well along with Interbank \nMobile Payment Service (IMPS of NPCI) capability to allow customers to use this inter -\noperable IMPS for funds transfer between banks and also to do merchant payment \ntransactions as additional capability for purchases of agricultural inputs.  \n This mobile banking should ideally be on Unstructured Supplementary Data (USSD) platform \nfor wider and safer acceptance. However, the banks can also offer this on other fully \nencrypted modes (application based or SMS based) to make use of the recent relaxation on \ntransaction limits. Banks can also offer unencrypted mobile banking subject to RBI Page 14 of 15 \n regulations on transaction limits.  \n It is necessary that Mobile based transaction plat forms enabling transactions in the KCC use \neasy to use SMS based solution with authentication thru' MPIN. Such solutions also need to \nbe enabled on IVR in local language to ensure transparency and security. Such mobile based \npayment systems should be encou raged by all the banks by creating awareness and by \ndoing proper customer education.  \n With the existing infrastructure available with banks, all KCC holders should be provided with \nany one or a combination of the following types of cards :  \n  * Debit cards (magnetic stripe card with PIN) enabling farmers to operate the \nlimit through all banks ATMs / Micro ATMs  \n  * Debit Cards with magnetic stripe and biometric authentication.  \n  * Smart cards for doing transactions through PoS  machines held by Business \nCorrespondents, input dealers, traders and Mandies.  \n  * EMV compliant chip cards with magnetic stripe and pin with ISO IIN.  \n In addition, the banks having a call centre / Inter active Voice Response (IVR),  may provide \nSMS based mobile banking with a call back facility from bank for mobile PIN (MPIN) \nverification through IVR, thus making a secured SMS based mobile banking facility available \nto card holders.  \n   \n    \n \n  \n \n  Page 15 of 15 \n APPENDIX  \nList of Circulars consolidated in the  \n Master Circular on \u2018Kisan Credit Card\u2019  \n \nSL Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1 RPCD.No.PLFS.BC.20/05.05.09/98 -99 05.08.1998  Kisan Credit Card  \n2 RPCD.PLNFS.No.BC.99/05.05.09/99 -2000  06.06.2000  Kisan Credit Card \nScheme - Modification  \n3 RPCD.No.PLFS.BC./63/05.05.09/2000 -01 03.03.2001  Kisan Credit Cards  \n4 RPCD.PLFS.BC.No./64/05.05.09/2001 -12 28.02.2002  Kisan Credit Card  \n5 RPCD.Plan.BC.No 87/04.09.01/2003 -04 18.05.2004  Credit Flow to Agriculture \n\u2013 Agricultural Loans -   \nWaiver of Margin / \nSecurity Requirements  \n6 RPCD.PLFS.BC.No.38/05.05.09/2004 -05 04.10.2004  Scheme to cover term \nloans for agriculture & \nllied activities under KCC  \n7 RPCD.PLFS.BC.No. 85/05.04.02/2009 -10 18.06.2010  Credit Flow to Agriculture \n\u2013 Agricultural Loans -   \nWaiver of Margin / \nSecurity Requirements  \n8 RPCD.FSD .BC.No. 77/05.05.09/2011 -12 11.05.2012  Revised Kisan Credit \nCard Scheme \n9 RPCD.

R.  Gadgil (Gadgil Study Group) on the organizational  framework \nfor implementation of the social objectives, which submitted its report in October \n1969. The Study Group drew attention to the fact that commercial banks did not \nhave adequate presence in rural areas and also lacked the required rural orientation. The Study Group, therefore, recommended the adoption of an 'Area Approach' to \nevolve plans and programmes for the development of an adequate banking and \ncredit structure in the rural areas.  \n(ii)  A Comm ittee of Bankers on Branch Expansion Programme of public sector \nbanks appointed by Reserve Bank of India under the Chairmanship of Shri F. K. F. \nNariman (Nariman Committee) endorsed the idea of area approach in its report \n(November 1969)  recommending that in order to enable the public sector banks to \ndischarge their social responsibilities, each bank should concentrate on certain \ndistricts where it should act as a 'Lead Bank'.       \n(iii)  Pursuant to the above recommendations, the Lead Bank Scheme was \nintroduced by Reserve Bank of India in December 1969.  The Scheme aims at \ncoordinating the activities of banks and other developmental agencies through \nvarious fora in order to achieve the objective of enhancing the flow of bank finance to  \npriority sector and other sectors and to promote banks ' role in overall development of \nthe rural sector.  For coordinating the activities in the district, a particular bank is \nassigned the lead bank responsibility of the district. The lead b ank is expected to \nassume leadershi p role for coordinating the efforts of the credit institutions and \nGovernment.    \n(iv)  In view of the several changes that had taken place in the financial sector, the \nLead Bank Scheme was last reviewed by the High Level Committee headed by Smt \nUsha Thorat, Deputy Governor  of the Reserve Bank of India in 2009.   \n(v)  The High Level Committee held wide ranging discussions with various \nstakeholders viz. State Governments, banks, development institutions, \nacademicians, NGOs, MFIs etc. and noted that the Scheme has been useful in \nachieving its original objectives of improvement in branch expansion, deposit \nmobilisation and lending to the priority sectors, especially in rural/semi urban areas.\n 4 \n \nThere was overwhelming consensus that the Scheme needs to continue.  Based on \nthe recommendations of the Committee, guidelines were issued to SLBC Convenor  \nbanks  and lead banks for implementation.  \n \n(vi)   Envisaging greater role for private sector banks,  the lead banks were advised to \nensure that private sector banks are mor e closely involved in the implementation of \nthe Lead Bank Scheme.  The private sector banks should involve themselves more \nactively by leveraging on Information Technology bringing in their expertise in strategic planning.  They should also involve themsel ves in the preparation as well \nas implementation of  the District Credit Plan.  \n \n \n2.  Fora under Lead Bank Scheme \n2.1     Block Level Bankers\u2019  Committee (BLBC)  \nBLBC is a forum for achieving coordination between credit institutions and field level \ndevelopment agencies at the block level . The forum prepares and reviews \nimplementation of Block Credit Plan and also resolves operational problems in implementation of the credit programmes of banks. Lead District Manager of the district is the Chairman of the Block  Level Bankers\u2019 Committee. All the banks \noperating in the block including the district central co- operative banks , RRB s, Block \nDevelopment Officer, technical officers in the block, such as extension officers for agriculture, industries and co- operatives ar e members of the Committee. BLBC \nmeetings are held at quarterly intervals. The Lead District Officer (LDO ) of RBI and \nthe District Development Manager ( DDM ) of NABARD selectively attend the \nmeetings of the BLBCs. The representatives of Panchayat Samitis ar e also invited to \nattend the meetings at half yearly intervals so as to share their knowledge and experience on rural development in the credit planning exercise. \n \n \n2.2 District Consultative Committee (DCC)  \n2.2.1 Constitution of DCC  \nDCCs  were constituted in the early seventies  as a common forum at district level for \nbankers as well as Government agencies/departments to facilitate  coordination in \nimplementing various developmental activities under the Lead Bank S cheme.  The \nDistrict Collector is the Chairma n of the DCC meetings. Reserve Bank of India, 5 \n \nNABARD, all the commercial banks in the district, co -operative banks including \nDistrict Central Cooperative Bank (DCCB), RRBs, various State Government \ndepartments and allied agencies are the members of the DCC . The Lead District \nOfficer (LDO) represents the Reserve Bank as a member of the DCC. The Lead \nDistrict Manager convenes the DCC meetings. The Director of Micro Small and \nMedium Enterprises Development Institutes (MSME -DI) is an invitee in districts \nwhere MSME clusters are located to discuss issues concerning MSMEs.  \n2.2.2 Conduct of DCC Meetings  \n \ni) DCC meeting should be convened by the l ead banks at quarterly intervals . \nii) At the DCC level, sub -committees as appropriate may be set up to work \nintensively on specific issues and submit reports to the DCC for its consideration.  \niii) DCC should give adequate feedback to the SLBC on various issues that needs to \nbe discussed on a wider platform, so that these receive adequate attention at the \nState Level.  \n \n2.2.3 Agenda for DCC Meetings  \n \nWhile lead banks are expected to address the problems particular to the concerned \ndistricts, some of the important areas which are common to all districts which the \nlead banks should invariably discuss in the fora are as under:  \ni) Review of progress under financial inclusion plan (FIP) . \nii) The specific issues inhibiting and enabling IT enabled financial inclusion  \niii) Issues  to facilitate 'enablers' and remove/ minimis e 'impeders' for banking \ndevelopment for inclusive growth  \niv) Monitoring initiatives f or providing 'Credit Plus' activities by banks and State \nGovernments such as setting up of Financial Literacy  Centres (FLCs) and \nRSETI type Training Institutes for providing skills and capacity building to manage businesses.  \nv) Scaling up financial literacy  efforts to achieve financial inclusion.  \nvi) Review of performance of banks under District Credit Plan ( DCP)  \nvii) Flow  of credit to priority sector and weaker sections of the society  \nviii) Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022  \nix) Assistance under Government sponsored schem es  \nx) Grant of educational loans  6 \n \nxi) Progress under SHG -  bank linkage  \nxii) SME financing & bottlenecks thereof, if any  \nxiii) Timely submission of data by banks  \nxiv) Review of relief measures (in case of natural calamities wherever applicable)  \nThe above list is illustrativ e and not exhaustive. The l ead banks may include any \nother agenda item considered necessary.  \n \n2.2.4 Role of LDMs  \nAs the effectiveness of the Lead Bank Scheme depends on the dynamism of the \nDistrict Collector s and the Lead District Managers (LDMs), with s upportive role of the \nRegional/Zonal Office, the office of LDM should be sufficiently strengthened with appropriate infrastructural support being the focal point for successful implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme. Officers of appropriate level and attit ude \nshould be posted as LDMs. Apart from the usual role of LDMs like convening meetings of the DCC /DLRC and periodical meetings of DDM/LDO/ Government \nofficials for resolving outstanding issues etc., the new functions envisaged for LDMs include the followi ng:  \ni) Monitoring implementation of district credit plan  \nii) Associate with the setting up of Financial Lit eracy Centres (FLCs), RSETIs by \nbanks  \niii) Associate with organizing financial literacy camps by FLCs and rural branches of banks.  \niv) Holding annual sensitisation workshops for banks and G overnment officials \nwith participation by NGOs/Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)  \nv) Arranging for quarterly awareness and feedback public meetings, grievance \nredressal etc.  \n \n2.2.5 Quarterly Public Meeting and G rievance Redressal   \nThe Lead District Manager should convene a quarterly public meeting at various \nlocations in the district in coordination with the LDO of Reserve Bank, banks having \npresence in the area and other stakeholders to generate awareness of the various banking po licies and regulations relating to the common person, obtain feedback \nfrom the public and provide grievance redressal to the extent possible at such meetings or facilitate approaching the appropriate machinery for such redressal.  \n 7 \n \n2.2.6 District Level Review Committee (DLRC)  Meetings \nDLRC meetings are Chaired by the District Collector and attended by members of \nthe District Consultative Committee  (DCC).  Besides above, public representatives \ni.e.  Local MPs/MLAs/ Zilla Parishad Chiefs are also invited to t hese meetings.  The \nDLRC meetings should be convened by the lead banks at  least once in a quarter.  In \nDLRC meetings  review of the programmes under Lead Bank Scheme is carried out \nby getting feedback to know the pace and quality of  the implementation of vari ous \nprogrammes in the dis trict. Hence association of non -officials is considered useful.  \nLead banks are required to ensure the presence of public representatives in DLRC \nmeetings as far as possible.  Therefore, Lead banks should fix the date of DLRC \nmeetings with due regard to the convenience of the representatives of the public i.e. \nMPs/MLAs etc. and invite and involve them in all functions conducted by the banks \nin the districts, such as opening of new branches, distribution of Kisan Credit C ards, \nSHG cre dit linkage programmes etc. Responses to queries from public \nrepresentatives need to be accorded highest priority and attended to promptly. The \nfollow up of DLRC\u2019s decisions is required to be discussed in the DCC meetings.   \n2.2.7 DCC/DLRC meetings - Annual Calendar of M eetings  \ni) DCC and DLRC are the important coordinating fora among commercial banks, \nGovernment agencies and others at district level to review and find solutions to the \nproblems hindering the developmental activities. Therefore, it is necessar y that all \nthe members participate and deliberate in the above meetings. On a review of the DCC/DLRC meetings, it was  observed that late receipt/non- receipt of intimation of \nthe date of meetings, clash of dates with other events, commonality of dates etc.  \nhinder participation of members in these meetings, thus undermining the prime objective of conducting the above meetings.  \nii)   Lead banks  have,  therefore, been advised to prepare annual schedule of DCC \nand DLRC meetings on Calendar year basis for all di stricts in consultation with the \nChairperson of the meetings, lead district officer of RBI and Public Representatives \nin case of DLRC.  This yearly Calendar should be prepared in the beginning of each \nyear and circulated to all members as advance intimation for blocking future dates to \nattend the DCC and DLRC meetings and the meetings should be conducted as per \nthe calendar.  While preparing the Calendar , it should be seen that DCC and DLRC \nmeetings are not  held simultaneously.  8 \n \n2.3 State Level Banker s\u2019 Com mittee (SLBC)  \n \n2.3.1 Constitution of SLBC  \n i) The State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC ) has been constituted in April 1977, \nas an apex inter-institutional forum to create adequate coordination machinery in all \nStates, on a uniform basis for development of  the State.  SLBC is chaired by the \nChairman & Managing Director (CMD) of the convenor bank/Executive Director of \nthe convenor bank .    It comprises representatives of com mercial banks, RRBs, State \nCooperative Banks, RBI, NABARD, heads of Government departm ents including \nrepresentatives from National Commission for Scheduled Castes/Tribes, National Horticulture Board, Khadi & Village Industries Commission etc. and representatives \nof financial institutions operating in a State,  who come together and sort out \ncoordination problems at the policy implementation level.  Representatives of various \norganizations from different sectors of the economy like industry bodies, retail \ntraders, exporters  and farmers\u2019 union etc. are special invitees in SLBC meetings for \ndiscussing their specific problems, if any. The SLBC meetings are held on quarterly \nbasis. The responsibility of convening the SLBC meetings would be of the SLBC \nconvenor bank of the State.  \n \nii) Recognising that SLBCs, primarily as a committee of bankers at S tate level play \nan important role in the development of the State, i llustrative guidelines on the \nconduct of State Level Bankers Committee meetings have been issued.  \n2.3.2 Conduct of SLBC Meetings  \ni)  The SLBC meetings are required to be held regularly at  quarterly intervals .  SLBC \nis chaired  by the Chairman & Managing Director (CMD) of the convenor \nbank /Executive Director of the convenor bank and co-chaired by Additional Chief \nSecretary or Development Commissioner of the State concerned.  High Level of participation in SLBC/UTLBC meetings ensure an effective and desired outcome with meaningful discussion on issues of public policy of both the Government of India and Reserve Bank of India.  \n \nii)  The Chief Minister/Finance Minister and senior level officers  of the State/RBI (of \nthe rank of Deputy Governor / Executive Director) may be invited to attend the SLBC meetings.  Further, the State Chief Ministers are encouraged to attend at least one \nSLBC meeting in a year.  \n 9 \n \niii)   In view of the large membership of  the SLBC, it would be desirable for the SLBC \nto constitute Steering Sub Committee/ Sub-Committees for specific tasks  like \nagriculture, micro, small/medium industries/enterprises, handloom finance, export \npromotion and financial inclusion etc.  The sub commi ttees may examine the specific \nissues in -depth and devise solutions/recommendations for adoption by the full \ncommittee . It is expected to meet more frequently than the SLBC. The composition \nof the sub- committee and subjects/ specific issues impeding/enabli ng financial \ninclusion to be deliberated upon, may vary from State to State depending on the specific problems/issues faced by the States.  \n \niv)   The secretariat/offices of SLBC should be sufficiently strengthened to enable the \nSLBC convenor bank to effec tively discharge its functions.  \nv) The various fora at lower levels may give adequate feedback to the SLBC on issues that need to be discussed on a wider platform.  \n \nvi)   Several institutions and academicians are engaged in research and studies etc. \nthat have implications for sustainable development in agriculture and MSME sector. \nEngaging with such research institutions and academicians would be useful in \nbringing in new ideas for furthering the objectives of the Lead Bank Scheme. The \nSLBCs may, therefor e, identify such academicians and researchers and invite them \nas 'special invitees' to attend SLBC  meetings occasionally both for adding value to \nthe discussion and also associate them with studies appropriate to the State. Other 'special invitees' may be invited to attend SLBC meetings depending on the agenda \nitems/issues to be discussed in the meetings.  \n \nvii)  The activities of NGOs in facilitating and channeling credit to the low income \nhouseholds are expected to increase in the coming years. Several co rporate houses \nare also engaged in corporate social responsibility activities for sustainable \ndevelopment. Bank's linkage with such NGOs/Corporate houses operating in the area to ensure that the NGOs/ corporates provide the necessary 'credit plus' services \ncan help leverage bank credit for inclusive growth. Success stories could be presented in SLBC  meetings to serve as models that could be replicated.  \n  \n \n \n2.3.3 Agenda for SLBC Meetings \n 10 \n \nWhile all SLBCs  are expected to address the problems particular to the concerned \nstates, some of the important areas which are common to all States which the \nSLBCs  should invariably discuss in the fora are as under:  \ni) Review of progress under financial inclusion plan (FIP) . \nii) The specific issues inhibiting and enabling IT enabl ed financial inclusion.   \niii) Issues to facilitate 'enablers' and remove/minimise 'impeders' for banking \ndevelopment for inclusive growth  \niv) Monitoring initiatives for providing 'Credit Plus' activities by banks and State \nGovernments such as setting up of Financi al Literacy  Centres (FLCs) and \nRSETI type training institutes for providing skills and capacity building to \nmanage businesses  \nv) Scaling up financial literacy efforts to achieve financial inclusion.  \nvi) Review of performance of banks under Annual Credit Plan ( ACP) of the State \nvii) Regional imbalances in deployment of credit to various sectors of the \neconomy  \nviii) Credit - Deposit Ratio of the State  \nix) Flow of credit to priority sector and weaker sections of the society  \nx) Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022  \nxi) Assistance under  Government sponsored schemes  \nxii) Grant of educational loans  \nxiii) Progress under SHG -  bank linkage  \nxiv) Problems faced by MSME sector  \nxv) Steps taken for improving land record and recovery mechanism  \nxvi) Timely submission of data by banks  \nxvii) Review of relief measures (in cas e of natural calamities wherever applicable) \nand  \nxviii) Issues remaining unresolved at the DCC/DLRC meetings  \n \nThe above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. The SLBC convenor banks may \ninclude any other agenda item considered necessary.  \n \n \n   2.3.4 Banking Penetration  \n 11 \n \ni)  Over the years, the focus of L ead Bank Scheme has shifted to inclusive growth \nand financial inclusion. The use of Information Technology (IT) and intermediaries \nhas enabled banks to increase outreach, scale and depth of banking services a t \naffordable cost.   \nii)   SLBC Convenor  banks / lead banks are advised to focus attention on the need \nfor achieving 100% financial inclusion through penetration of banking services in the \nrural areas. Such banking services may not necessarily be extended through a brick \nand mortar branch but can be provided through any of the various forms of ICT-  \nbased models, including through BCs. However, ICT connectivity should not be an \nexcuse for not pursuing financial inclusion by commercial banks/RRBs.  \n \niii)  SLBC convenor banks should take up with the State Governments impeders \nsuch  as issues of road/digital connectivity, conducive law and order situation, \nuninterrupted power supply and adequate security etc. for ensuring banking expansion at all centres where penetration by the formal banking system is required. However, these impeders should not inhibit the scaling up of financial inclusion \ninitiatives.  \n \n2.3.5   SLBC - Yearly Calendar of Meetings \n \ni)  To improve the effectiveness and streamlining the functionin g of SLBC/UTLBC \nmeetings, SLBC convernor banks  have been advised to prepare a yearly calendar of \nprogramme (calendar year basis) in the beginning of the year itself, for conducting the meetings. The calendar of programme should clearly specify the cut off dates for data submission to SLBC and acceptance thereof by SLBC convenor. This yearly calendar should be circulated to all the concerned as an advance intimation for blocking of future dates of senior functionaries of various agencies like Central  \nGovernment, State Governments, banks and RBI, etc. The SLBC/UTLBC meetings \nshould be conducted as per the calendar under all circumstances. The agenda \nshould also be circulated in advance without waiting for the data from defaulting banks. The matter should, how ever, be taken up with the defaulting banks in the \nSLBC meeting . In addition, SLBC convernor bank should write a letter in this regard \nto the controlling office of the defaulting banks under advice to Regional Office of RBI. SLBC convenor bank will, however, continue to follow -up with banks for timely \ndata submission. Further, i n case the Chief Minister, Finance Minister or other very 12 \n \nsenior functionaries are not able to attend the SLBC on some very rare occasion, \nthen if so desired by them, a special SLBC meeting can be held.  Following broad \nguidelines should be used for preparation of the calendar of programmes:   \n \nActivity  To be completed by (Date)  \nPreparation of calendar of SLBC/UTLBC \nmeetings and intimation to all the concerned of \nthe cut -off dates fo r submission of data and \ndates of meetings as per the dateline given \nbelow.  15th  January every year  \nReminder regarding the exact date of meeting \nand submission of data by banks to SLBC  15 days before end of the \nquarter  \nDead line for receipt of informati on/data by \nSLBC convenor bank 15 days from the end of the  \nquarter  \nDistribution of agenda cum background papers  20 days from the end of the  \nquarter  \nHolding of the meeting  \n Within 45 days from the end of \nthe quarter  \nForwarding the minutes of the meeting  to all \nstakeholders  Within 10 days from holding the \nmeeting \nFollow -up of the action points emerged from the \nmeeting To be completed within 30 days \nof forwarding the minutes (for \nreview in the next meeting)  \n      \nii)   The objective of preparing calendar  of meetings in the beginning of the year is to  \nensure adequate notice of these meetings and timely compilation and dispatch of \nagenda papers to all stake holders. It also ensures clear cut guidelines for submission of data to SLBC convenors by participati ng banks & Government \nDepartments. It is expected to  save precious time of SLBC convenors otherwise \nspent in taking dates from various senior functionaries attending these SLBC meetings.  \niii)  SLBC convenor  banks  need to appreciate the advantages of ensur ing adherence \nto the yearly calendars.  SLBC convenor banks have therefore been advised to give wide publicity to the annual calendar at the beginning of the year and ensure that dates of senior functionaries expected to attend the meetings are blocked for  all \nmeetings by their offices.  In case,  despite blocking dates, if for some reason, the \nsenior functionary is not able to attend the meeting, the meeting should be held as planned in the calendar.  More importantly, the data for review in these meetings 13 \n \nshould be received as per deadlines set in the calendar and those who do not submit \nthe data in time should be asked to explain the reasons for delay in sending the data \nthat may be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Under no circumstances \npreparation  of agenda should be delayed beyond stipulated dates as per calendar.  \n2.3.6 SLBC Website \u2013 Standardisation of information /data \n \nSLBC Convenor  banks are required to maintain the SLBC websites where all \ninstructions pertaining to LBS  and Government Sponsored Schemes are made \navailable and are accessible to the common man desiring any information relating to \nthe conduct of meetings or State wise data/Bank wise performance. In order to \nstandardize the information and data that is to be made available on SLBC w ebsite, \nan indicative list of the information & data is given in the Annex II .  SLBCs should \narrange to place the prescribed minimum information on the websites of SLBCs of their bank and keep it updated regularly, at least on quarterly basis. Banks may note that the list is only an indicative list and SLBCs are free to put any additional information considered relevant for the State.  \n \n2.3.7 Liaison with State Government  \n \nSLBC Convenor  banks   are expected to co -ordinate the activities of all banks in the \nState, discuss with the State Government officials the operational problems in lending, extending necessary support for  banking development and to achieve the \nobjective of financial inclusion.\n \n2.3.8 Capacity Building/T raining/ Sensitization Programmes  \n \ni) There is a need for sensitising the District Collectors and CEOs of Zilla Parishads on banks and banking in general as also on the specific scope and role of the Lead Bank Scheme. In each State, a full day sensitisation workshop may be convened by the SLBC Convenor  bank every year  preferably in  April/May . Such sensitisation \nshould form part of the probationary training of such officers. Further, as soon as they are posted in a district, the SLBC may arrange for exposure visits for the District Collectors to the SLBC C onvenor\u2019s office for sensitisation and understanding of the \nLead Bank Scheme.  \n 14 \n \nii) Staff at the operational level of banks and government agencies associated with \nimplementation of the Lead Bank Scheme need to be aware of the latest \ndevelopments and emerging opportunities. There is need for staff sensitisation/ \ntraining/seminars, etc. at periodic intervals on an ongoing basis  \n \n3. Implementation of Lead Bank Scheme  \n3.1 Preparation of credit plans  \nPlanning plays an i mportant role in the implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme \nand a bottom -up approach is adopted to map the existing potential for development.  \nUnder LBS, planning starts with identifying block wise/activity wise potential estimated for various sectors .  \n3.2 Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs)  \ni) Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) are a step towards decentralized credit \nplanning  with the basic objective of mapping the existing potential for development  \nthrough bank credit . PLPs tak e into account the long term physical potential, \navailability of infrastructure support, marketing facilities, and policies/programmes of Government etc.   \nii) A pre -PLP meeting is convened by LDM during June every year to be attended by \nthe banks, Government agencies, etc., to reflect their views and concerns regarding credit potential (sector/activity -wise) and deliberate on major financial and socio-\neconomic developments in the district in the last one year and priorities to be set out for inclusion in the PLP.   DDM of NABARD will make a presentation in this meeting \noutlining the major requirements of information for preparing the PLP for the following year.  The preparation of PLP for the next year is to be completed by \nAugust every year to enable the State Government  to facto r in the PLP projections.   \niii) The procedure for preparing the District Credit Plan is as follows:  \na) Controlling Offices of commercial banks and Head Office of RRB and \nDCCB/LDB will circulate the accepted block -wise/activity -wise potential to all \ntheir branches for preparing the Branch Credit Plans (BCP) by their respective branch managers.  Banks should ensure that the exercise of preparation of 15 \n \nbranch/block plans is completed in time by all branches so that the Credit \nPlans become operational on time.  \nb) A special Block Level Bankers' Committee (BLBC) meeting will be convened \nfor each block where the Branch Credit Plans will be discussed and \naggregated to form the Block Credit Plan.  DDM and LDM will guide the BLBC \nin finalizing the plan ensuring that the Block Credit Plan is in tune with the \npotentials identified activity -wise including in respect of Government \nsponsored programmes.   \n \nc) All the Block Credit Plans of the district will be aggregated by LDM to form the District Credit Plan. This plan indicates an analytical assessment of the credit \nneed of the district to be deployed by all the financial institutions operating in the district and total quantum of funds to be earmarked as credit by all the financial institutions for a new financial year.  The Zonal/ Controlling Offices of \nbanks, while finalizing their business plans for the year, should take into account the commitments made in the DCP which should be ready well in time before the performance budgets are finalized.   \n \nd) The District Credit Plan will be placed before the DCC by the Lead District \nManager for final acceptance/approval.  All the D istrict Credit Plans would \neventually be aggregated into State Level Credit Plan to be prepared by SLBC convenor bank and launched by 1st of April every year.   \n \n3.3 Monitoring the performance of credit plans \nThe performance of the credit plans is reviewed in the various fora created under the lead bank scheme as  shown below:  \n \nAt Block Level  Block Level Bankers \u2019 Committee (BLBC)  \nAt District Level  District Consultati ve Committee (DCC) & District \nLevel Review Committee (DLRC)  \nAt State Level  State Level Bankers \u2019 Committee (SLBC)  \n \n \n \n 16 \n \nMonitoring of LBS by RBI -  Monitoring Information System (MIS)  \ni)  Data on Annual Credit Plan (ACP), is an important element to review t he flow of \ncredit in the S tate.  ACP formats have been revised to align the same with the \nrevised reporting guidelines on priority sector lending. Accordingly, the ACP is to be \nprepared considering the categories of priority sector that would include Agric ulture, \nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Export Credit, Education, Housing, Social \nInfrastructure a nd Renewable Energy and Others. Further, agriculture has been \nredefined to include (i) Farm Credit, (ii) Agriculture Infrastructure and (iii) Ancillary \nActivities.  Micro, Small and Medium   Enterprises  would include   manufacturing   \nand   service sector under (i) Micro Enterprises, (ii) Small Enterprises and (iii) Medium Enterprises , Khadi  and Village Industries Sector (KVI) and other finance to \nMSMEs. Thus, at present, the reporting statement s for ACP target is  LBS- MIS-I \n(Annex I II), statement  for disbursement and outstanding LBS -MIS \u2013II (Annex IV\n) and \nACP achievement vis -\u00e0-vis ACP target LBS -MIS-III (Annex V ).  Lead banks/SLBC \nConvenor banks have been advised, to prepare the bank group wise statements of \nLBS- MIS \u2013I, II and III as per prescribed formats and also place these statements for \nmeaningful review in  all DCC and SLBC meetings .  \nii)  In order to maintain consistency and integrity of data with the all India data of scheduled commercial banks and meaningful review/analysis of data, the ACP data needs to be grouped separately for scheduled commercial banks and ot her banks \nlike State cooperative banks & DCCBs etc. while presenting in the DCC/SLBC \nmeetings and submitting to our regional offices.  The data of scheduled commercial \nbanks needs to be further grouped into p ublic sector banks, private sector b anks and \nRegional Rural Banks to know the bank group wise position.   \n4.   Assignment of L ead Bank Responsibility  \n \ni) Lead Bank Scheme is administered by the Reserve Bank of India since 1969. The \nassignment of lead bank responsibility to designated banks in every dist rict is  done \nby Reserve Bank of India following a detailed procedure formulated for this purpose.  \nAs on June 30, 2017 ,   25 public sector banks and one private sector  bank  have \nbeen assigned lead bank responsibility in 70 6 districts of the country.   \nii) State Level Bankers \u2019 Committee  (SLBC) /Union Territory Level Bankers' \nCommittee (UTLBC)  as an apex level for um at State /Union Territory (UT)  level 17 \n \ncoordinates the activities of the financial institutions  and Government departments in \nthe State/Union Territory  under  the Lead Bank Scheme. SLBC Convenorship is \nassigned to banks for this purpose. As on June 30, 2017 , the SLBC/UTLBC \nconvenorship of 29 States and  7 Union Territories has been assigned to 15  public \nsector banks and one private sector bank.  List of St ate wise SLBC Convenor  banks  \nand district  wise lead banks is given  in Annex  I. \niii) The Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) has been extended to the districts in the \nmetropolitan areas thus bringing the entire country under the fold of the Lead Bank \nScheme.  \n5.    Roadmap for opening of banking outlets in unbanked villages \ni)   A  phase wise approach has been adopted to provide door step banking facilities \nin all the unbanked villages in the country. In November 2009, under Phase- I, \nguideline s for preparation of Roadmap for providing banking  services in villages with  \npopulation more than 2000 was issued.  After successful completion of P hase- I by \nMarch 2012, a roadmap to provide banking services in unbanked villages with less \nthan 2,000 population was rolled out in June 2012. Accordingly, SLBC Convenor \nbanks and lead banks were  advised to complete the process of providing banking \nservices in unbanked villages with population below 2000 (Phase II) by August 14, \n2015.  \n \n5.1 Roadmap for opening bri ck and mortar branches in villages with \npopulation more than 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial bank  \n \nAs brick and mortar branches are an integral component  in financial inclusion, it was \ndecided to focus on villages with population above 5000 without a bank branch of a \nscheduled commercial bank. This was to  enable banks to provide quality financial \nservices and timely support to BC outlets that would help in sustaining and \nstrengthening the services provided through BCs and also ensure cl ose supervision \nof BC operations.  Accordingly, SLBC Convenor banks were advised to identify \nvillages with population above 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial bank in their State and allot these villages among scheduled commercial \nbanks (i ncluding Regional Rural Banks) for opening of branches.   \n 18 \n \n5.2   Aligning roadmap for unbanked villages having population more than \n5000 with revised Guidelines on Branch Authorisation Policy  \n \nIn terms of circular DBR.No.BAPD.BC. 69/22.01.001/2016- 17 dated May 18, 2017  \nissued by DBR on \u2018Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy -  Revision of \nGuidelines\u2019,  final guidelines on \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 have been issued with a view to \nfacilitate  financial inclusion as also to provide flexibility  to banks  on the choice of delivery channel.   \n \nIn the circumstances, SLBC Convenor banks are advised to review and identify the unbanked rural centres (URCs) in villages with population above 5000, in light of the revised guidelines on rationalisation of branch authorisation policy and ensure that such unbanked rural centres in villages with population above 5000, if any, are banked forthwith by opening of CBS enabled banking outlet.  A confirmation stating that all unbanked rural centres in villages with population above 5000 have been banked, may be furnished to the respective  Regional Office of Financial Inclusion and Development Department of Reserve Bank of India latest by December 31,  \n2017.   \n \n6. Credit Deposit Ratio  \n \n6.1   CD ratio of banks in Rural and Semi -Urban Areas \n \n Banks have been advised to achieve a credit deposit ratio of 60% in respect of their \nrural and semi -urban branches separately on an all -India basis. While it is not  \nnecessary that this ratio should be achieved separately branch- wise, district -wise or \nregion- wise, the banks should nevertheless, ensure that wide disparity in the ratios \nbetween different States / Regions is avoided in order to minimise regional \nimbalanc e in credit deployment. The credit dispensation in certain districts is very \nlow, as a result of various factors such as lack of necessary infra- structure, varying \nability of different regions to absorb credit, etc. The banks may review the \nperformance of their bank branches in such areas and take necessary steps to augment the credit flow. The lead banks may discuss the problem in all its aspects with the other financial institutions in the district and also in the DCC forums.  \n \n \n   19 \n \n6.2    Implementation of  the recommendations of Expert Group on CD Ratio  \n \n \ni)   An Expert Group was constituted by Government of India to go into the nature \nand magnitude of the problem of low credit deposit (CD) ratio across States / Regions and to suggest steps to overcome the problem. The Expert Group \nexamined problems and causes of low CD ratio. As per the recommendations, the CD ratio of banks should be monitored at different levels on the basis of the following \nparameters \u2013 \nInstitution / Level  Indicator  \nIndividual banks at Head Office  Cu + RIDF  \nState Level (SLBC)  Cu + RIDF  \nDistrict Level  Cs \n \nWhere:   \n \nCu = Credit as per place of Utilization  \nCs = Credit as per place of Sanction  \nRIDF = Total Resource support provided to States under RIDF \nFurther, banks are advised that:  \n \n\u2022 In the districts having CD ratio  less than 40, Special Sub -Committees (SSCs) \nof DCC may be set up to monitor the CD ratio . \n\u2022 Districts having  CD ratio between 40 and 60, will be monitored under the \nexisting system by D CC, and  \n\u2022 The district with CD ratio  of le ss than 20 need to be treated on a special \nfooting.  \n \nii)  Special Sub-  Committee (SSCs) of DCC should be set up in the districts having \nCD ratio  less than 40, in order to monitor the CD ratio and to draw up Monitorable \nAction Plans (MAPs) to increase the C D ratio . The Lead District Manager is  \ndesignated as the convenor of the SSC, which in addition to District co- ordinators of \nbanks functioning in the area, will comprise of LDO  of RBI , DDM  of NABARD, District \nPlanning Officer or a representative of the Coll ector duly empowered to take \ndecisions on behalf of the district administration.  \nThe functions of the Special Sub- Committee are as under:  \n\u2022 The Special Sub- Committee (SSCs) will draw up Monitorable Action Plans \n(MAPs) for improving the CD ratio in their dist ricts on a self -set graduated \nbasis.  \n\u2022 For this purpose the SSC will hold a special meeting immediately after its \nconstitution and on the basis of the various ground level parameters, set for 20 \n \nitself a target for increasing the CD ratio initially for the curr ent year . It will \nalso, at the same meeting, set a definite time frame for the CDR beyond 60 in \nannual increments.  \n\u2022 Consequent on the completion of this process, the target and time frame self \nset by the SSC will be placed before the DCC for approval.  \n\u2022 Take up the plans for implementation and monitor the same assiduously once \nin two months.  \n\u2022 Report the progress to the DCC on quarterly basis and through them to the \nconvenor of SLBC.  \n\u2022 On the basis of the feedback received from the DCC regarding the progress in \nthe implementation of the Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs), consolidated \nreport will be prepared and tabled at all SLBC meetings for discussion / information.  \niii)  As regards the districts with CD ratio  less than 20, these are generally located in \nhilly, des ert, inaccessible terrains and / or those dependent solely on the primary \nsector and/ or characterized by a breakdown of the law and order machinery. In such \nareas, conventional methods are not likely to work unless the banking system and \nthe State Governm ent come together in a specially meaningful way.  \n \niv) While the framework for implementation for raising the CD ratio  in these districts \nwill be the same as in the case of districts with CD ratio  below 40 (i.e setting up of \nSSC etc.), the focus of attentio n and the level of efforts should be of a much higher \nscale.  \nFor this,  \n\u2022 All such districts should first be placed in a special category.  \n\u2022 Thereafter , the responsibility for increasing their CD ratio  should be taken by \nbanks and State Governments and the dis tricts should be \"adopted\" by the \nDistrict Administration and the l ead bank jointly.  \n\u2022 While banks would be responsible for credit disbursement, the State \nGovernment would be required to give an upfront commitment regarding its \nresponsibilities for creation of identified rural infrastructure together with \nsupport in creating an enabling environment for banks to lend and to recover their dues. Given a collaborative framework as outlined above, the Group was of the view that meaningful increase in CD ratio  is possible.  21 \n \n\u2022 Progress in the special category districts will be monitored at the district level \nand reported to the corporate offices of the concerned banks.  \n\u2022 CMDs of banks would give special attention to the CD ratio  in such districts.  \n \n7.   Direct Benefit Transfer  \n \n \nDirect Benefit Transfer  (DBT) was rolled out by  Government of India in selected \ndistricts since January 2013.  SLBC Conveno r banks were advised to co- ordinate \nwith the authorities to implement DBT .  Banks were advised to include the status of \nthe roll-out of DBT  as a regular agenda item for discussion in SLBC meetings as part \nof Financial Inclusion/ Direct  Benefit Transfer ( DBT) implementation. As a \nprerequisite to the implementation of the DBT, every eligible individual should have a \nbank account. Further, to make disbursements at the doorstep through the ICT-based BC model, banking outlets either through brick & mortar branches or the branchless mode is  needed in all villages across the country.  Hence, banks have \nbeen advised to:   \n\u2022 take steps to  complete account opening and seeding Aadhaar number in all the DBT districts.  \n\u2022 closely monitor the progress in seeding of Aadhaar number in bank accounts \nof beneficiaries.  \n\u2022 put in place a system  to provide  acknowledgement  to the beneficiary of seeding request and also send  confirmation of seeding of Aadhaar number.  \n\u2022 form DBT Implementation Co- ordination Committee, along with State \nGovernment  department concerned, at district level and review the seeding \nof Aadhaar number in bank accounts.  \n\u2022 ensure that dist rict and village wise names and other details  of business \ncorrespondents (BCs) engaged/other arrangements made by the bank is displayed  on the SLBC website.  \n\u2022 set up a Complaint Grievance Redressal mechanism in each bank and nominate a Complaint Redressal  Officer in each district, to redress the \ngrievances related to \u2018seeding of Aadhaar number in bank accounts'.  \n \n \n \n \n 22 \n \n8. Service Area Approach (SAA)  \n \ni) The Service Area Approach (SAA) introduced in April 1989 for planned and orderly \ndevelopment of rural and semi -urban areas was applicable to all scheduled \ncommercial banks including Regional Rural Banks.  Under SAA, each bank branch in rural and semi -urban area was designated to serve an area of 15 to 25 villages \nand the branch was responsible for meeting the needs of bank credit of its service area.  The primary objective of SAA was to increase productive lending and forge \neffective linkages between bank credit, production, productivity and increase in \nincome levels.  The SAA scheme was reviewed from time to t ime and appropriate \nchanges were made in the scheme to make it more effective.  \n \nii) The Service Area Approach scheme was reviewed in December 2004  and it was \ndecided to dispense with the restrictive provisions of the scheme while retaining the \npositive features of the SAA such as credit planning and monitoring of the credit purveyance. Accordingly, under SAA the allocation of villages among the rural and \nsemi -urban branches of banks were made not applicable for lending except under \nGovernment Sponsored Schemes. Thus , while  the commercial banks and RRBs are \nfree to lend i n any rural and semi -urban area, the borrowers have the choice of \napproaching any branch for their credit requirements.  \n8.1 Dispensing with No Due Certificate  \n \nIn order to ensure hassle free credit to all borrowers, especially in rural and semi -\nurban areas and keeping in view the technological developments and the different \nways available with banks to avoid multiple financing, banks have been advised to dispense with obtaining \u2018No Due Certif icate\u2019 from the individual borrowers (including \nSHGs & JLGs) in rural and semi -urban areas for all types of loans including loans \nunder Government Sponsored Schemes, irrespective of the amount involved unless the Government Sponsored Scheme itself provides  for obtention of \u2018No Dues \nCertificate\u2019.  Further, it is clarified that the policy of dispensing with No Due Certificate \nfor lending by banks is also applicable to urban areas including metropolitan cities.  \n \nii)   Banks are encouraged to use an alternative framework of due diligence as part \nof credit appraisal exercise other than the \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 which could, among others, consist of one or more of the following:  \n 23 \n \n\u2022 Credit history check through credit information companies  \n\u2022 Self-declaration or an affidavit from the borrower  \n\u2022 CERSAI registration  \n\u2022 Peer monitoring  \n\u2022 Information sharing among lenders  \n\u2022 Information search (writing to other lenders with an auto deadline)  \n \niii) Banks are also advised to submit information/data to all Credit Information \nCompanies (CICs), as required in terms of extant instructions issued by RBI.  \n 9.   Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022 \ni)  The Government of India in the Union Budget 2016- 17 had announced its resolve \nto double the income of farmers by 2022. Several steps have been taken towards attaining this objective including setting up of an inter -ministerial committee for \npreparation of a blue print for the same. This agenda has also been reiterated by the government in several forums and has acquired primacy from the point of view of \nrural and agricultural development.  \nii) The strategy to achieve this goal, inter -alia, include,  \n\u2022 Focus on irrigation with large budgets, with the aim of \"per drop, more crop\"  \n\u2022 Provision of quality seeds and nutrients based on soil health of each field  \n\u2022 Investments in warehousing and cold chains to prevent post -harvest crop \nlosses  \n\u2022 Promotion of value addition through food processing  \n\u2022 Creation of a national farm market, removing distortions and develop \ninfrastructure such as e- platform across 585 stations  \n\u2022 Strengthening of crop insurance scheme to mitigate risks at affordable cost  \n\u2022 Promotion of ancillary activities like poultry, bee- keeping and fisheries.  \niii. Needless to emphasize that acceleration in income generation is significantly dependent on better capital formation in agriculture. Towards this, banks should revisit their documentation for crop loans, simplify them where required and ensure \nspeedy sanctioning and disbursal of loans within specified time limits.  24 \n \niv. The Lead Bank Scheme, which ensures inter -departmental/governmental \ncoordination in financial sector, should therefore be leveraged to further the objective \nof doubling farmer\u2019s income by 2022. Lead banks are accordingly advised to ensure \nthe following:  \na. Work closely with NABARD in preparation of P otential Linked Plans (PLPs) & \nAnnual Credit Plans keeping the above strategy in consideration.  \nb. Include \u2018Doubling of Farmer\u2019s Income by 2022\u2019 as a regular agenda under \nLead Bank Scheme in various forums such as SLBC, DCC, DLRC and BLBC.  \nc. For the purpose of  monitoring and reviewing the progress, Lead banks may \nuse the benchmarks as may be provided by NABARD.  \nd. Map the overall strategy as given in para 9 (ii) above to the agriculture/agro-\nancillary lending plan of your bank.  \n \n10.

FID.BC.No.02/ 12.01.033/2017 -18                                  July 03, 2017  \n \nThe Chairman/ Managing Director/  \nChief Executive Officer  \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks  \n \nMadam / Dear Sir  \n \nMaster Circular on SHG -Bank Linkage Programme \n  \nThe Reserve Bank of India has, from time to time, issued a number of \nguidelines/instructions to banks on SHG -Bank Linkage Programme. In order to enable \nthe banks to have instructions at one place, the Master Circular incorporating the \nexisting guidelines/i nstructions on the subject has been updated and enclosed. This \nMaster Circular consolidates the circulars issued by Reserve Bank on the subject up to June 30, 2017 , as indicated in the Appendix\n.  \n Yours faithfully  \n  \n(Uma Shankar ) \nChief General Manager -in-Charge \nEncl: As above  \n   \n \n 2 \n Master Circular on SHG -Bank Linkage Programme \n \n1. Despite the vast expansion of the formal credit system in the country, dependence of \nthe rural poor on moneylenders somehow continued in many areas, especially for \nmeeting unforeseen requirements. Such dependence was pronounced in the case of \nmarginal farmers, landless labourers, petty traders and rural artisans belonging to \nsocially and economically backward classes and tribes whose propensity to save is \nlimited or too small to be mopped up by the banks. For various reasons, credit to these sections of the population has not been institutionalized to the extent desired. Studies \nconducted by NABARD, APRACA and ILO on the informal groups promoted by Non -\nGovernmental Organizations (N GOs) brought out that Self -Help Savings and Credit \nGroups had the potential to bring together the formal banking structure and the rural poor for mutual benefit and that their working had been encouraging.  \n2. Accordingly, NABARD launched a pilot project t o cover Self -Help Groups (SHGs) \npromoted by Non- Governmental Organizations, banks and other agencies and \nsupported it by way of refinance. The quick studies conducted by NABARD in a few states to assess the impact of the linkage project brought out encouraging and positive features like increase in loan volume of the SHGs, definite shift in the loaning pattern of the members from non- income generating activities to pr oduction activities, nearly 100 \nper cent  recovery performance, significant reduction in the transaction costs for both the \nbanks and the borrowers etc ., besides leading to a gradual increase in the income level \nof the SHG members. Another significant feature observed in the linkage project was that about 85 per cent  of the groups linked with ban ks were formed exclusively by \nwomen.  \n3. With a view to studying the functioning of SHGs and NGOs  for expanding their \nactivities and deepening their role in the rural sector, in November 1994, RBI constituted a Working Group comprising eminent NGO functionaries, academicians, consultants \nand bankers , under the Chairmanship of Shri S K  Kalia, the then Managing Director, \nNABARD. The Working Group was of the view that linking of SHGs with banks is a cost effective, transparent and flexible approach to improve t he accessibility of credit from 3 \n the formal banking system to the unreached rural poor, which is expected to offer the \nmuch needed solution to the twin problems being faced by the banks, viz . recovery of \nloans in the rural areas and the high transaction cos ts in dealing with small borrowers at \nfrequent intervals. The Group, therefore, felt that the thrust of the policy should be to encourage the formation of SHGs and linking them with banks , and in this regard, banks \nhave a major role to play. The Working Gr oup also recommended that banks should \ntreat the linkage programme as a business opportunity and they may design area and group specific loan packages , taking into account inter alia  the potential, local needs, \navailable talent/skills etc.  \n4. Linking of S HGs with banks has been emphasized in the Monetary P olicy Statements \nof Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget announcements from time to time and various guidelines have been issued to banks in this regard. To scale up the SHGs linkage programme and make it sustainable, banks were advised that they may consider lending to SHGs as part of their mainstream credit operations , both at policy \nand implementation level. They may include SHG linkage in their corporate strategy/plan, training curriculum of their of ficers and staff and implement it as a regular \nbusiness activity and monitor and review it periodically.  \n5. Separate Segment under priority sector: In order to enable the banks to report \ntheir SHG lending without difficulty, it was decided that the banks should report their lending to SHGs for on- lending to members of SHGs under the respective categories, \nviz. 'Advances to SHGs' irrespective of the purposes for which the members of SHGs have been disbursed loans. Lending to SHGs should be included by the b anks as part \nof their lending to the weaker sections.  \n6. Opening of Savings Bank A/c:  The SHGs , registered or unregistered , which are \nengaged in promoting savings habits among their members would be eligible to open savings bank accounts with banks. These SHGs need not necessarily have already availed of credit facilities from banks before opening savings bank accounts. KYC verification of all the members of SHG shall not be required while opening the savings bank account of the SHG as KYC verification of all the office bearers shall suffice. No 4 \n separate KYC verification of the members or office bearers shall be necessary at the \ntime of credit linking of SHGs.  \n7. SHG lending to be a part of planning process: Bank lending to SHGs should be \nincluded in branch credit plan, block credit plan, district credit plan and state credit plan \nof each bank. While no target is being prescribed under SHG bank linkage programme, utmost priority should be accorded to the sector in preparation of these plans. It should \nalso f orm an integral part of the bank\u2019s corporate credit plan.  \n8. Margin and Security Norms:  As per operational guidelines issued by NABARD, \nSHGs may be sanctioned savings linked loans by banks (varying from a saving to loan \nratio of 1:1 to 1:4). However, in c ase of matured SHGs, loans may be given beyond the \nlimit of four times the savings as per the discretion of the bank.  \n9. Documentation:  A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation \nis a precondition for augmenting flow of credit to SHGs. B anks should strive to remove \nall operational irritants and make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and disburse credit by delegating adequate sanctioning powers to branch managers. The loan \napplication forms, procedures and documents should be made si mple . It would help in \nproviding prompt and hassle- free credit.   \n10. Presence of defaulters in SHGs:  Defaults by a few members of SHGs and/or their \nfamily members to the financing bank should not ordinarily come in the way of financing SHGs per se by banks , provided the SHG is not in default. However, the bank loan may \nnot be utilized by the SHG for financing a defaulter member to the bank.  \n11. Capacity Building and Training:  Banks may initiate suitable steps to internalize \nthe SHGs linkage project and organize exclusive short duration programmes for the \nfield level functionaries. In addition, suitable awareness/sensitization programmes may be conducted for their middle level controlling officers as well as senior officers.  \n12. Monitoring and Review of SHG  Lending: Having regard to the potential of SHGs, \nbanks may have to closely monitor the progress regularly at various levels. In order to \ngive a boost to the ongoing SHG bank linkage programme for credit flow to the 5 \n unorganized sector, banks were advised i n January 2004 that monitoring of SHG bank \nlinkage programme may be made a regular item on the agenda for discussion at the \nSLBC and DCC meetings. It should be reviewed at the highest corporate level on a quarterly basis. Further , progress of the programme may be reviewed by banks at \nregular intervals. A progress report, as prescribed vide \ncircular \nFIDD.FID.BC.No.56/12.01.033/2014- 15 dated May 21, 2015 , may be sent to NABARD \n(Micro Credit Innovations Department), Mumbai, on a half -yearly basis, as on 30 \nSeptember and 31 March each year so as to reach within 30 days of the half -year to \nwhich the report relates.  \n13. Encourage SHG Linkage:  Banks should provide adequate incentives to their \nbranches in financing the Self Help Groups (SHGs) and establish linkages with them, making the procedures simple and easy. The group dynamics of  working of the SHGs \nneed neither be regulated nor formal structures imposed or insisted upon. The appr oach \nto financing of SHGs should be totally hassle- free and may  also include consumption \nexpenditures.  \n14. Interest rates:  The banks would have the discretion to decide on the  interest rates \napplicable to loans given to Self Help Groups/member beneficiari es. \n15. Service/ Processing charges:  No loan related and ad hoc service \ncharges/inspection charges should be levied on priority sector loans up to \u20b9 25,000. In the case of eligible priority sector loans to SHGs/ JLGs, this limit will be applicable per member and not to the group as a whole.  \n16. Total Financial Incl usion and Credit Requirement of SHGs:  Banks have been \nadvised to meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members, as envisaged in Paragraph 93 of the Union Budget announcement for the year 2008- 09, made by the \nHonourable Finance Minister , wherein it was  stated as under: \"Banks will be \nencouraged to embrace the concept of Total Financial Inclusion. Government will request all scheduled commercial banks to follow the example set by some public sector banks and meet the entire credit requirements of SHG mem bers, namely, (a) 6 \n income generation activities, (b) social needs like housing, education, marriage, etc. \nand (c) debt swapping\".  \n \n  \n------------------------  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 \n Appendix \n          List of Circulars consolidated in the Master Circular  \n \nSr. \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

Please do not respond in any manner to such offers.  \n1 \n  \nMaster Circular --Credit Facilities to Scheduled Castes (SCs) & Scheduled \nTribes (STs)  \nBanks should take the following measures to step up their advances to SCs / STs:  \n1. Planning Process  \n1.1 The District Level Consultative Committees formed under the Lead Bank \nScheme should continue to be the principal mechanism of co- ordination \nbetween banks and development agencies in this regard.  \n1.2 The district credit plans formulated by the lead banks should clearly  indicate  \nthe linkage of credit with employment and development schemes.  \n1.3 Banks will have to establish closer liaison with the District Industries Centres, \nwhich have been set up in different districts for prom oting self -employment.  \n1.4 At the block level, a certain weightage is to be given to scheduled castes / \nscheduled tribes in the planning process. Accordingly, the credit planning \nshould be weighted in favour of scheduled castes / scheduled tribes and speci al bankable schemes suited to members of these communities should be \ndrawn up to ensure their participation in such schemes and larger flow of credit to them for self -employment. It will be necessary for the banks to \nconsider loan proposals of these communities with utmost sympathy and \nunderstanding.  \n1.5 Banks should periodically review their lending procedures and policies to see \nthat loans are sanctioned in time, are adequate and production- oriented and \nthat they generate incremental income to make them s elf-liquidating.  \n1.6 While 'adopting' villages for intensive lending, villages with sizeable population \nof these communities may be specially chosen; the alternative of adopting \nspecific localities (bastis) in the concerned villages which have a \nconcentrat ion of these communities could also be considered.  \n \n 2 \n 2. Role of Banks  \n2.1 Bank staff may help the poor borrowers in filling up the forms and completing \nother formalities so that they are able to get credit facility within a stipulated \nperiod from the date of receipt of applications.  \n2.2 In order to encourage SC / ST borrowers to take advantage of credit facilities, \ngreater awareness among them about various schemes formulated by banks \nwill have to be created. As a majority of the eligible borrowers would be  \nilliterate persons, publicity through brochures, other literature, etc. will be of limited utility. The more desirable method would be for the field staff of banks \nto contact such borrowers and explain to them the salient features of the \nschemes as also t he advantages that will accrue. Banks should advise their \nbranches to organize meetings more frequently exclusively for SC / ST \nbeneficiaries to understand their credit needs and to incorporate the same in \nthe credit plan.  \n2.3 Circulars issued by RBI / NABARD should be circulated among the staff for \ncompliance.  \n2.4 Banks should not insist on deposits while considering loan applications under \nGovernment sponsored poverty alleviation schemes / self -employment \nprogrammes from borrowers belonging to SCs / STs. It should also be \nensured that applicable subsidy is not held back while releasing the loan \ncomponent till the full repayment of bank dues. Non release of subsidy upfront \namounts to under -financing and hampers asset creation / income generation.  \n2.5 The National Scheduled Tribes Finance & Development Corporation and \nNational Scheduled Castes Finance & Development Corporation have been \nset up under the administrative control of Ministry of Tribal Affairs and Ministry \nof Social Justice & Empowerment, respecti vely. The banks should advise their \nbranches / controlling offices to render all the necessary institutional support \nto enable the institution to achieve the desired objectives.  \n2.6 Advances sanctioned to State sponsored organizations of SC / ST, for the \nspecific purpose of purchase and supply of inputs to and / or the marketing of \noutputs of the beneficiaries viz. artisans, village and cottage industries of 3 \n these organizations, should be treated as Priority Sector Advances, subject to \nthe condition that th e relative advances are exclusively for the purpose of \npurchase and supply of inputs to and / or marketing of the outputs of \nbeneficiaries of these organizations.  \n2.7 Rejection of loan applications in respect of SCs / STs should be done at the \nnext higher level instead of at the branch level  and reasons  of rejection should \nbe clearly indicated.  \n3. Role of SC / ST Development Corporations  \nThe Government of India has advised all State Governments that the Scheduled \nCaste/ Tribes Development Corporations can c onsider bankable schemes / \nproposals for bank finance. As regards Collateral Security and / or third party \nguarantee for loans, guidelines issued to banks on priority sector lending will \napply.  \n4. Reservations for SC / ST Beneficiaries under Major Centrall y Sponsored \nSchemes.  \nThere are several major centrally sponsored schemes under which credit is \nprovided by banks and subsidy is received through Government Agencies. Credit flow under these schemes is monitored by RBI. Under each of these, there is a \nsignificant reservation / relaxation for the members of the SC / ST communities.  \n(i) Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana -  National Rural Livelihoods Mission:  \nThe Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India has launched \nDeendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission ( DAY- NRLM) \nby restructuring   erstwhile Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana,  effective \nfrom April 01, 2013.  DAY- NRLM would ensure adequate coverage of \nvulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of these beneficiaries are SC/STs.  Details regarding the scheme of DAY -NRLM are available in the \nMaster Circular FIDD.GSSD.CO.BC.No.04/09.01.01/2017- 18 dated July 01,  \n2017 . \n \n 4 \n  \n(ii) Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana -  National Urban Livelihoods Mission:  \nThe Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MoHUPA), Government \nof India, has launched the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana -  National Urban \nLivelihoods Mission (DAY -NULM) by restructuring erstwhile  Swarna Jayanti \nShahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY), effective from September 24, 2013, Under \nDAY- NULM, advances should be extended to SCs / STs to the extent of their \nstrength in the local population. Details regarding the scheme of DAY -NULM \nare available in the Master Circular FIDD.GSSD.CO.BC.No.03/09.16.03/2017-\n18 dated July 01, 2017 . \n (iii) Differential Rate of Interest Scheme  \nUnder the DRI Scheme, banks provide finance up to \u20b915,000/ - at a \nconcessional rate of interest of 4 percent per annum to the weaker sections of \nthe community for engaging in productive and gainful activities. In order to \nensure that persons belonging to SCs / STs also derive adequate benefit under the Dif ferential Rate of Interest (DRI) Scheme, banks have been \nadvised to grant to eligible borrowers belonging to SCs / STs such advances to the extent of not less than 2/5th (40 percent) of total DRI advances.  Further, \nthe eligibility criteria under  DRI that s ize of land holding should not exceed 1 \nacre of irrigated land and 2.5 acres of unirrigated land are not applicable to \nSCs / STs.  Members of SCs / STs satisfying the income criteria of the scheme \ncan also avail of housing loan up to \u20b9 .20,000 /- per beneficiary over and above \nthe individual loan of \u20b9 .15,000/ - available under the scheme.  \n5. Monitoring and Review  \n5.1 A special cell should be set up at the Head Office of banks for monitoring the \nflow of credit to SC / ST beneficiaries. Apart from ensuring the implementation of the RBI guidelines, the cell would also be responsible for collection of  \nrelevant information / data from the branches, consolidation thereof and \nsubmission of the requisite returns to RBI and Government.  \n \n 5 \n 5.2 Convenor bank (of SLBC) should invite the representative of National \nCommission for SCs / STs to attend SLBC meetings. Besides, the Convener \nbank may also invite representatives   from National Scheduled Castes   and   Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation (NSFDC) and State \nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development \nCorporation (SCDC) to attend SLBC meetings  \n5.3   A periodical review should be made by the Head Office of banks of the credit \nextended to SCs / STs on the basis of returns and other data received from \nthe branches.  \n5.4 Bank should review the measures taken to enhance the flow of credit to SC / \nST borrowers on a quarterly basis. The Review should also consider t he \nprogress made in lending to these communities directly or through the State \nlevel Scheduled Caste / Scheduled Tribe Corporations for various purposes based, amongst others, on field visits of the senior officers from the Head Office / Controlling Offices. Any major gap or variation in credit flow to SC/ST on a year to year basis should be reported to Board of the Bank for review under the themes  of \u201cFinancial Inclusion\u201d  in term of \ncircular \nDBRNo.BC.93/29.67.001/2014- 15 dated May14,  2015 .  \n6. Reporting Requirements \nData on a dvances to SCs and STs should be reported as prescribed in \nMaster Direction   under  Priority sector lending vide Master Direc tion  \nFIDD.CO.Plan.1/04.09.01/2016- 17 dated July 0 7, 2016  and updated as on \nDecember 22,  2016.

Credit  Facilities to Minority Communities : \n \nThe Government of India has indicated that care should be taken to see that minority \ncommunities secure, in a fair and adequate measure the benefits flowing from various \nGovernment sponsored schemes. Accordingly, a ll commercial banks are advised to \nensure smooth flow of ban k credit to minority communities.  \n \nGovernment of India has also forwarded a list of 121 minority concentration districts \nhaving at least 25% minority population, excluding those States / UTs where minorities \nare in majority (J & K, Punjab, Meghalaya, Mizor am, Nagaland and Lakshadweep). \nAccordingly all scheduled commercial banks are requested to speci ally monitor the \ncredit flow to minorities in these 121 districts, thereby, ensuring that the minority \ncommunities receive a fair and equitable portion of the c redit within the overall \ntarget of the priority sector  (list of Minority Concentration Districts at Annexure I ). \n \nIn terms of Reserve Bank's extant guidelines on lending to priority sector, a target of 40 \npercent of Adjusted  Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent amount of Off -\nBalance Sheet Exposures (OBE), whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous \nyear, has been mandated for lending to the priority sector by domestic scheduled \ncommercial banks and foreign bank s with 20 and above branches. Within this, a sub -\ntarget of 10 per cent of ANBC or Credit Equivalent amount of OBE, whichever is higher, \nas on March 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for lending to weaker \nsections which includes, among others, pers ons from minority communities . \n \n \n2.        Definition of Minority Communities  \n \n2.1 The following communities have been notified as minority communities by the \nGovernment of India , Ministry  of Minority Affairs ; \n(a)    Sikhs   \n(b)    Muslims   \n(c)    Christian s  \n(d)    Zoroastrians   \n(e)    Buddhists  \n(f)     Jains  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n2 \n  \n \n 2.2 In  the case of a partnership firm, if the majority of the partners belong to one or the \nother of the specified minority communities, advances granted to such partnership firms \nmay be treate d as advances granted to minority communities. Further, if the majority \nbeneficial ownership in a partnership firm belongs to the minority community, then such \nlending can be classified as advances to the specified communities. A company has a \nseparate leg al entity and hence advances granted to it cannot be classified as \nadvances to the specified minority communities.  \n \n3. Creation of Special Cell and Designating an exclusive Officer  \n \n3.1 A Special Cell should be set up in each bank to ensure smooth flow of credit to \nminority communities and it should be headed by an officer holding the rank of      \nDeputy General Manager/Assistant General Manager or any other similar rank who \nshould function as a 'Nodal Officer'.  \n \n3.2  The Lead Bank in each of the minority c oncentration districts should have an officer \nwho shall exclusively  look after the problems regarding the credit flow to minority \ncommunities. It shall be his responsibility to publicise among the minority \ncommunities various programmes of bank credit and also to prepare suitable \nschemes for their benefit in collaboration with branch managers.  \n \n3.3 The designated officer should exclusively look after aspects relating to credit \nassistance to minority communities in the concerned districts. The designated of ficer \nmay be attached to the Lead Bank set up at the district level. He would thus, be able \nto receive necessary guidance from Lead Bank Officer, who will be senior enough \nand have adequate experience for liaising effectively with the other credit institut ions \nand Government agencies, and will also be working in close collaboration with the \nbranch managers of other banks in the district. The designated officer will also \narrange group meetings for their guidance for formulation of schemes suitable for \nthe me mbers of the minority communities. It will be necessary for the banks \nconcerned to ensure that the role assigned to the designated officer/s is effectively \nfulfilled.  \n \n3.4 The Convenor banks of the District Consultative Committees (DCCs) and the State           \n       Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs) should ensure that steps taken to facilitate the   \n      flow of credit to the minority communities and the progress made in this regard are  \n      reviewed regularly at their meetings.  \n  \n  \n3 \n  \n3.5  The Convenor banks of  DLRC/SLRM/SLBCs may invite Chairman/ Managing \nDirectors of State Minority Commissions/Boards or the State Minorities Financial \nCorporations or their representatives to attend the meetings of District Level Review \nCommittee (DLRC), State Level Review Meeti ng (SLRM) and State Level Bankers \nCommittee (SLBC).  \n \n \n3.6  Names, designation and office addresses of (i) the officer -in-charge of the Special \nCell at Head Office and (ii) officer appointed by Lead Banks in the identified districts \nto look after exclusively th e problems of minority communities, should be furnished \nby banks to the National Commission for Minorities at the following address and \nupdated periodically:  \nThe Secretary  \nNational Commission for Minorities  \nGovernment of India  \n5th Floor ,Lok Nayak Bhawan  \nKhan Market  \nNew Delhi 110 003  \n \nA copy of the relevant communication may also be furnished to Financial Inclusion  \nand Development  Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai.  \n \n \n3.7  The Lead Banks in the identified districts having concentration of minority \ncommunities may involve the State Minority Commission / Finance Corporation in \nthe extension work including creating awareness, identification of beneficiaries, \npreparation of viable projects, provision of backward and forward linkages such as \nsupply of inputs/marketing, recovery etc.  \n \n3.8  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may collaborate with DDMs of NABARD/ \nNGOs/ Voluntary Organizations in reaching the poor through Self Help Groups \n(SHGs). Lead Banks of the Minority Concentration Districts will have to exercise the \npro-active role expected of them to ensure that the minority communities, \nparticularly those who are poor and illiterate have access to bank credit for taking up \nproductive activities.  \n \n4 Advances under DRI Scheme  \nBanks may route lo ans under the DRI scheme through State Minority \nFinance/Development Corporation on the same terms and conditions as are \napplicable to loans routed through SC/ST Development Corporations, subject to the \nbeneficiaries of the Corporations meeting the eligibil ity criteria and other terms and \nconditions prescribed under the scheme. Banks may ensure proper maintenance of \nthe register to evolve timely sanction and disbursement of loan applications.   \n  \n4 \n  \n5.   Monitoring  \n5.1 With a view to monitoring the performance of bank s in providing credit to the \nspecified minority communities, data on credit assistance provided to members of \nminority communities should be furnished to Reserve Bank of India and to the \nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Minority Aff airs, on half \nyearly basis as on the last working day  of March and September every year. The \nstatements (given in Annexure II) should reach RBI within one month from the close \nof each half year.\u201d  \n \n \n5.2  The Conven or banks of the Dist rict Consultative Committees in the identified \nminority concentrated districts should furnish the data on priority sector advances \ngranted by banks to specified minority communities compiled by them in the \nprescribed format (vide Annexure III ) for the district under their lead responsibility to \nthe concerned Regional Offices of RBl within one month from the close of the \nrelative quarter.  \n \n5.3  The progress made in regard to the flow of credit to the minority communities \nshould b e reviewed regularly at the meetings of the District Consultative \nCommittees (DCCs) and the State Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs).  \n \n \n5.4  The Lead Banks in the identified  minority concentrated  districts should furnish the \nrelevant extracts of the agenda notes  and the minutes of the meetings of the DCCs \nand of the respective SLBCs to the Union Ministry of Finance and to the Ministry of \nMinority Affairs  on a quarterly basis for their use.  \n \n6 Training  \n \n6.1  With a view to ensuring that the bank staff and officers have proper perspective and \nappreciation of the various programmes for welfare of minorities, necessary \norientation may be provided to officials and other staff. For this purpose, banks \nshould include suitable lecture sessions as part of all relevant training p rogrammes \nlike induction courses, programmes on rural lending, financing of priority sectors, \npoverty alleviation programmes, etc.  \n \n6.2  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may sensitise and motivate the staff \nposted to identified districts through prop er training to assist the minority \ncommunities under various credit schemes.  \n  \n  \n5 \n 6.3  The Lead Banks may organize sensitization workshops for bank officials regarding \nmicro credit/ lending to SHGs with the help of DDMs of NABARD.  \n \n6.4  The Lead Banks functioning in t he identified districts should organize Entrepreneur \nDevelopment Programmes so that the members of the minority communities in \nthese areas are enabled to derive the benefit of various programmes being financed \nby the banks. Depending upon the major vocatio n and type of activity undertaken by \nlarge sections of the people in the districts, suitable programmes may be organized \nin co -operation with State Governments, Industries Department, District Industries \nCentre, SIDBI, State Technical Consultancy Organizat ion, Khadi and Village \nIndustries Commission and other voluntary organizations which are fully equipped to \nimpart such training and orientation. The duration of the programme, the course \ncontent, the faculty support to be selected etc. should be decided by  each Lead \nBank taking into account the prevailing conditions, need and existing skills as well \nas aptitude of the people in the district.  \n \n7 Publicity  \n \n7.1  There should be good publicity about various anti -poverty programmes of the \nGovernment where there is la rge concentration of minority communities and \nparticularly in the districts listed in the Annexure I  which have a concentration of \nminority communities.  \n \n7.2  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may create awareness among  minority \ncommunities regarding credit facilities available from banks through appropriate \nmeasures which may include publicity through (i) print media i.e. distribution of \npamphlets in local languages, advertisements/articles in newspapers etc. (ii) TV \nchannels - DD/ local channels, (iii) participation / setting up of stalls in the Melas / \nfairs organized during the religious /festive occasions by these communities.  \n \n8.   National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC)  \n \n8.1  National Minorities  Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC) was \nestablished in September 1994 to promote economic and developmental activities \nfor the backward sections amongst the minorities. NMDFC works as an apex body \nand channelises its funds to the beneficiaries thr ough the State Minority Finance \nCorporation of the respective State/Union Territory Governments.  \n \n  \n  \n6 \n  \n \n8.2  The NMDFC is operating, inter -alia, the Margin Money Scheme. Bank finance \nunder the scheme will be upto 60 percent of the project cost. The remaining amou nt \nof the project cost is shared by NMDFC, the State channelising agency and the \nbeneficiary in the proportion of 25%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. Banks may \nimplement the Margin Money scheme evolved by NMDFC. While extending bank \nfinance, banks should bear in mind the guidelines/instructions issued by RBI from \ntime to time on priority sector advances. It may be ensured that the assets created \nout of the loan amount are mortgaged / hypothecated to the banks. Where \nrecoveries have been made by the banks, it wo uld be in order if the amounts are \nappropriated first towards bank dues.  \n \n9 Prime Minister\u2019s 15 Point Programme for the Welfare of Minorities  \nGovernment of India has revised the \u201cPrime Minister\u2019s New 15 -Point Programme for \nthe Welfare of Minorities\u201d. An impo rtant objective of the Programme is to ensure that \nan appropriate percentage of the priority sector lending is targeted for the minority \ncommunities and that the benefits of various government sponsored schemes reach \nthe under -privileged, which includes th e disadvantaged sections of the minority \ncommunities. The New Programme is to be implemented by the Central \nMinistries/Departments concerned through State Governments/Union Territories \nand envisages location of certain proportion of development projects in  minority \nconcentration districts. Accordingly, all scheduled commercial banks are required  to \nensure that within the overall target for priority sector lending and the sub -target of \n10 percent for the weaker sections, sufficient care is taken to ensure th at minority \ncommunities also receive an equitable portion of the credit. Lead Banks have been \nadvised to keep this requirement in view while preparing district credit plans.  \n \n \n                                            ------------------------------------  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n7 \n  \nAnnexure I \nList of 121 Minority Concentration Districts  \n(Vide paragraph 3.3, 5.3 and 7.1 ) \nSl.

NULM has been under implementation w.e.f. September 24, 2013 in a ll \ndistrict headquarters (irrespective of population) and all the cities with population of 1 lakh or more.  \n The Self Employment Program (SEP) of NULM focus es on providing financial \nassistance through provision of interest subsidy on loans to support establishment of I ndividual & Group Enterprises and S elf-Help Groups \n(SHGs) of urban poor. The erstwhile provision of capital subsidy for USEP \n(Urban Self Employment Program) and UWSP (Urban Women Self -Help \nProgram) under  SJSRY has been replaced by interest subsidy for loans to \nIndividual enterprise (SEP -I), Group enterprise  (SEP -G) and Self Help \nGroups ( SEP- SHGs).  With a view to improving the livelihood opportunities for \nthe poor in urban areas, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation \n(UPA Division),  Government of India vide their Office Memorandum No.K -\n14011/2/2012- UPA/FTS- 5196 dated February 19, 2016 has decided to \nenhance the scope of National Urban Livelihoods Mission. The Mission with \nenhanced scope was renamed as \u201cDeendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National \nUrban Livelihoods Mission (DAY -NULM)\u201d.  \n \nThe operational guidelines of the Self Employment Program (SEP) \ncomponent of DAY -NULM are as under:  \n1. Introduction:  \n1.1 The SEP  provides  financial assistance to individuals/groups \nincluding street venders/hawkers of urban poor for setting up gainful \nself-employment ventures/ micro- enterprises, suited to their skills, \ntraining, aptitude and local conditions. The programme also support s \nSelf Help Groups (SHGs) of urban poor to access easy credit from \nbank and avail interest subsidy on SHG loans. The SEP will also \nfocus on technology, marketing and other support services to the above beneficiaries engaged in micro enterprises for their livelihoods  \nand will also facilitate issuance of credit cards for working capital \nrequi rement of the entrepreneurs.  \n    \n3 \n 1.2 The underemployed and unemployed urban poor will be encouraged \nto set up small enterprises relating to manufacturing, servic e and \nsmall business for which there is considerable local demand. Local \nskills and local crafts should be particularly encouraged. Each Urban \nLocal Body (ULB) should develop a compendium of such \nactivities/projects keeping in view skills available, marketability of \nproducts, costs, economic viability etc.  \n \n1.3 The percentage of women beneficiaries under SEP shall not be less \nthan 30 percent. SCs and STs must be benefited at least to the \nextent of the proportion of their strength in the city/town population of \npoor. A special provision of 3 percent reservation should be made \nfor the differently -abled under thi s program. In view of the Prime \nMinister\u2019s 15 -Point Program for the Welfare of Minorities, at least 15 \npercent of the physical and financial targets under this component \nshall be earmarked for the minority communities.  \n \n2. Selection of Beneficiary & Procedure for Sponsoring Applications:  \nThe Community Organizers (COs) and professionals from Urban Local \nBody (ULB) will identify the prospective beneficiaries from among the urban \npoor. The community structures formed under Social Mobilization & \nInstitutional D evelopment (SM&ID) component of DAY - NULM viz. Self \nHelp Groups (SHGs) and Area Level Federations (ALFs) may also refer \nprospective individual and group entrepreneurs for purpose of financial assistance under SEP to ULB. The beneficiaries may directly appr oach \nULB or its representatives for assistance.  Banks may also identify \nprospective beneficiaries at their end and forward such cases directly to \nULB. The Banks  may also use their empaneled Business Correspondents \n(BCs) and Business Facilitators (BFs) to i ncrease the outreach. Due  \ndiligence wil l be undertaken as per the Banks\u2019 policy, in this regard.   \n \n2.1 The application for individual and group enterprise loans will be \nsponsored by the Urban Local Body (ULB) which will be the sponsoring agency for the individual and group enterprise.  \n \n2.2 The ULB will create awareness regarding SEP to the prospective \nbeneficiaries through mass media campaigns, I nformation Education \nand Communication (IEC) activities, adv ertisements in local \nnewspapers, City Livelihoods Centres (CLCs) etc. The ULB may also \ndisseminate information regarding this component through active \ninvolvement of Resource Organizations and its field staff.  \n \n2.3 The beneficiaries desirous of seeking financial assistance for setting up \nan enterprise can s ubmit an application of intent to the concerned ULB \nofficials on a plain paper with basic details viz: Name, Age, Contact    \n4 \n details, Address, Aadhaar details (if any), amount of loan required, \nbank account number (if available), type of enterprise/ activity,  category \netc. The intent could also be sent by mail /post to the ULB office. The ULB shall accept such intents throughout the year.  \n \n2.4 The community structures formed under Social Mobilization & \nInstitutional Development (SM&ID) component of DAY -NULM viz: Self \nHelp Groups (SHGs)/ Area Level Federations (ALFs) may also refer \nprospective individual and group entrepreneurs for purpose of financial \nassistance under SEP to ULB.  \n \n2.5 On submission/receipt of the intent from the beneficiary the respective \nULB will enter the details in a register/or MIS if available and hence will \ngenerate a waiting list of beneficiaries. The ULB will issue an \nacknowledgement to the beneficiary with a unique registration number, \nwhich may be used as a reference number for tracking the status of \napplication.  \n \n2.6 ULB will call the beneficiaries in order of the waiting list to complete \nrequisite documentation including filling of Loan Application Form (LAF), activity details, identity proof, address proof, bank account \ndetails etc. To verify the identity of the beneficiary, her/his Aadhar \nnumber will also be brought on record. If beneficiary does not have \nAadhar card, his/ her any other unique identification document like \nvoters\u2019 card, driving license etc. will be taken and s/he will  be helped to \nobtain Aadhar card as soon as possible. The State Urban Livelihoods \nMission (SULM)  may develop a Loan Application Form (LAF) in \nsuitable format in consultation with State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) convenor bank. The same LAF may be utili sed across the \nState/UTs. The Loan Application Form (LAF) will contain basic data in respect of economic status of the beneficiary and her/his family. This \ndata will be such that it can be used to analyse impact of the benefits \non her/his economic status at a later stage.  \n \n2.7 A Task Force constituted at ULB level will scrutinize the applications \nbased on experience, skills, viability of activity, scope of the activity etc.  \nThereafter , the Task Force will shortlist the applications and call for \ninterview of  the applicants  before recommending or rejecting the \napplication or call for additional  information from the applicant,  if \nrequired.  \n \n2.8 The Chief Executive Officer (CEO)/ Municipal Commissioner of ULB will \nbe responsible to constitute the Task Force and will be the Chairman of the Task force. There could be more than 1 task force at ULB level \ndepending upon the size/population of the ULB.     \n5 \n  \n2.9 The indicative composition of the Task Force is as follows:  \n \nSr.  \nNo. TASK Force at ULB level  Role  \n1. Chief Exec utive Officer (CEO) ULB/ Municipal \nCommissioner of ULB/ or any representative \nauthorized by CEO ULB  Chairman  \n2. Lead District Manager (LDM)  Member  \n3. City Project Officer (CPO), ULB/ or any authorized \nrepresentative of ULB  Member \nConvenor  \n4. Representa tive from District Industries Centre (DIC)  Member  \n5. Senior Branch Managers (Max -2) of banks  Member  \n6. Representatives(2) of Area Level Federation / City \nLevel Federation Member  \n \n2.10 The task force will then recommend the applications if found suitable, \nreject if found unsuitable or ask the beneficiary to submit further \nrequisite information for re- examination on case to case basis.  \n \n2.11 The case duly recommended by the task force will be forwarded by \nthe ULB to the concerned banks for further process ing. Such cases \nrecommended by task force have to be processed by concerned \nbanks within a time frame of 15 days. As these cases are already \nrecommended by the task force, such cases should be rejected by \nbanks only in exceptional circumstances.  \n \n2.12 The banks will send a periodic report to the ULB on the status of the \napplications received. In case of MIS being used, the banks may be allowed to update the status of application online in addition to \nmanual report.  \n \n2.13 Banks may also directly accept the l oan applications of urban poor \nbeneficiaries on the basis of relevant documents as per the guidelines \nof Prime Minister MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) or any other such scheme \nwithout the need of having prior sponsoring from ULB . The banks can \nsend details of such loans sanctioned by them to ULBs for confirmation of their eligibility for interest subsidy under DAY -NULM. \nTask Force constituted for scrutinizing applications should quickly clear these applications if they otherwise meet the criteria. On \nconfirmation of t heir eligibility, interest subsidy may be claimed from \nULBs on the pattern of interest subsidy claim for beneficiaries sponsored by ULBs . The subsidy will be transferred directly to the    \n6 \n loan account of DAY -NULM beneficiaries. This procedure will also be \ndirect benefit transfer compl iant.  \n3. Educational Qualifications and Training Requirement:  \n    No minimum educational qualification is required for prospective \nbeneficiaries under this component. However where the identified activity \nfor micro -enterprise development requires some special skills appropriate \ntraining must be provided to the beneficiaries before extending financial \nsupport . \n3.1 Employment through Skills Training and Placement (EST&P) : \nFinancial assistance should be extended only after the prospecti ve \nbeneficiary has acquired required skills for running the proposed \nmicro -enterprise.  Such training may not be necessary if the \nbeneficiary has already undergone training from a known institution, \nregistered NGO/Voluntary Organi sation or trained under any  \ngovernment scheme provided requisite certificate is produced. In \ncase the beneficiary has acquired requisite skills from family \noccupation such cases should be certified by the ULB before \nextending financial assistance.  \n \n3.2 Entrepreneurship Development Progr am (EDP): In addition to \nskill training of the beneficiaries, the ULB will also arrange to conduct \nEntrepreneurship Development Program for 3- 7 days for individual \nand group entrepreneurs. The EDP will cover basics of entrepreneurship development such as m anagement of an \nenterprise, basic accounting, financial management, marketing, \nbackward and forward linkages, legal procedures, costing and \nrevenue etc. In addition to above topics the module should also include group dynamics, allocation of work, profit s haring \nmechanism etc. for group enterprises.  \n \n3.3 The EDP module may be developed and finalized by State Urban \nLivelihoods Mission (SULM) supported by State Mission \nManagement Unit (SMMU) with assistance of an empaneled \ninstitution/agency or consulting firm and same may be utilized for \nconducting training program by the ULB. This EDP training may be \narranged through institutions such as Rural Self Employment \nTraining Institutes (RSETI), reputed institutions engaged in \nentrepreneurship development/ training, management/ educational \ninstitutes,  reputed NGOs  engaged in entrepreneurship \ndevelopment/ training etc.  \n    \n7 \n 3.4 Follow -up entrepreneurial support to Individual and Group \nentrepreneurs:    After financing to Individual and Group \nbeneficiaries, the ULB will also arrange to conduct follow -up \nEntrepreneurship Development Programme (EDP) as and when \nrequired. Such programme should preferably be conducted once in \nsix months for each beneficiary who has been given a loan.  During \nthe follow -up EDP, problems and issues faced by beneficiaries \nshould also be discussed and solutions should be given.   \n \n4. Pattern of Financial Assistance:   \nThe financial assistance available to urban poor in setting up individual and \ngroup enterprises will be in the form of Interest subsidy on the bank loans. \nInterest subsidy, over and above 7% rate of interest will be available on a \nbank loan for setting up of individual or group enterprises. The difference \nbetween 7% p.a. and the rate of interest charged by the bank will be \nprovided to banks under  DAY- NULM.  Interest subsidy will be given only in \ncase of timely repayment of loan. Suitable certification from banks wi ll be \nobtained in this regard. An additional 3 percent interest subvention will be \nprovided to all Women Self Help Groups (W SHGs ) who re pay their loan in \ntime. The Interest subsidy will be subject to timely repayment of the loan (as per the loan repayment schedule) and suitable certification obtained \nfrom banks by the ULB. The additional 3% interest subvention amount will \nbe reimbursed to the eligible WSHGs. The banks should credit the amount \nof 3% interest subvention to the eligible WHSGs accounts and thereafter seek the reimbursement.  \n \n5. Procedure for interest subsidy to Banks:  \n5.1 All sch eduled commercial banks (SCBs) which are on the Core \nBanking Solution (CBS) platform would be eligible for getting interest \nsubvention under the scheme.  \n \n5.2 After disbursement of loan to the beneficiaries, the concerned \nbranch of the bank will send details of disbursed loan cases to ULB \nalong with details of in terest subsidy amount.  \nProcedure I  \n \n5.3 The settlement of claims made by banks would be done on quarterly basis by the ULBs, however the submission of claims should be \nmonthly. The ULB will check the data at their end and will release the interest subsidy amount (difference between 7% p.a. and \nprevailing rate of interest) to the banks.      \n8 \n 5.4 A prescribed format for interest subsidy claims for loans  under this \ncomponent enclosed at ( Annex -I) \n \n5.5 The claims should not be pending more than a quarter. In case the \nclaims of the banks are not settled for a period of 6 months, SLBC is \nempowered to stop the scheme temporarily in selected cities subject \nto clearance of claims by such ULBs. In such eventualities, the \nclaims settlement should prospect ively be given to the Lead District \nBank.  \n \nProcedure - II \n \n5.6 Settlement  of Claims: Nodal Agency for releasing interest subsidy:  \nA public sector bank may be engaged by each State as nodal bank in \nconsultation with the convener of the respective State Level Bankers\u2019 \nCommittee (SLBC). All the Banks will consolidate data regarding \ninterest subsidy from their branches and upload on the portal of \nNodal Bank. The nodal bank, after verification, will transfer the \ninterest subsidy to the bank branches.  The State/UT w ill deposit \nsome funds in advance with the nodal bank, which will release funds to the bank branches as per guidelines of the DAY -NULM. Nodal \nbank will regularly render account of reimbursement to the SULM. This procedure will be followed in all three types of loans i.e. SEP (I), \nSEP (G) and SHG -Bank Linkage.  \n \n6. Individual Enterprises (SEP -I)-Loan & Subsidy \nAn urban poor individual beneficiary desirous of setting up an individual micro -enterprise for self -employment can avail benefit of \nsubsidized loan under this component from any bank. The norms/ specifications for individual micro- enterprise loans are as follows:  \n \n6.1 Age:  The prospective beneficiary should have attained the age of 18 \nYears at the time of applying for loan.  \n \n6.2 Project Cost (PC):  The Maximum unit Project Cost for an individual \nmicro -enterprise is \u20b9 2, 00,000 (\u20b9 Two Lakhs).  \n \n6.3 Collateral Guarantee on Bank Loan:  No collateral required.

SHG -Bank Linkage \u2013  General Guidelines \nLinking of SHGs with banks have been emphasized in the Monetary policy \nof Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget  announcements from time to \ntime and various guidelines in this regard have been issued by the Reserve \nBank of India (RBI) to banks. To scale up the SHGs linkage program and \nmake it sustainable, banks have been advised to consider lending to SHGs \nas part o f their mainstream credit operations both at policy and \nimplementation level.  \n \n8.1 Master Circular of RBI on SHG- Bank Linkage Programme, \nFIDD.FID.BC.No.06/12.01.033/2016- 17 dated July 01, 2016  contains \ninstructions on opening of Savings Bank Account of Self Help Groups \n(whether registered or unregistered), which are engaged in promoting \nhabit of savings among their members as a starting point. Thereafter, \nthe SHGs may be sanctioned Savings Linked Loans (varying from a \nsaving to loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4) after due assessment or grading by \nbanks. However, in case of matured SHGs, loans may be given \nbeyond the limit of four times the savings as per the discretion of the \nbank. The Banks have also been instructed that the advances to SHGs irrespective of the purposes for which the members of SHGs    \n11 \n should be included by the banks as part of their lending to the weaker \nsections.  \n \n8.2 Under Social Mobilization & Institution Development (SM&ID) \ncomponent of DAY -NULM, the ULB will do necessary groundwork to \nopen bank accounts for SHGs and facilitating access to Revolving \nFund (RF). The ULB may also engage Resource Organization (RO) \nfor the purpose or may directly facilitate SHGs through its staff. \n(Concept & Formation of SHGs, ROs and Revolving Fund has been \ndetailed out in Social Mobilization & Institutional Development \n(SM&ID) component of DAY - NULM).  \n 8.3 The banks will send the details of disbursed loan cases to the ULB \nalong with the calculation details of the interest subsidy amount. The \nULB will check  the data at their end and will release the inter est \nsubsidy amount on quarterly  basis to the banks following a similar \nprocedure as mentioned in Para 5.  The prescribed format for claim ing \nthe additional i nterest subvention is enclosed at ( Annex \u2013II\n). \n \n8.4 The ULB through its field staff or Resource Organization (ROs) will \nfacilitate  filling of loan applications for eligible SHGs to access credit \nfrom the banks. The ULB will be responsible to forward the Loan \napplication of the SHGs to the concerned banks with requisite \ndocumentation. The ULB will maintain area wise, bank -wise, ROs/ \nStaff wise data of SHGs loan applications forwarded to the banks. The same wil l be sent to SULM on a monthly basis.  \n \n8.5 In order to ensure effective SHG -Bank Linkage under DAY -NULM, the \nSULM will monitor and review the progress with banks on regular \nbasis and co- ordinate with SLBC for interest subsidy/ subvention on \nSHG Loans in the state. Active involvement of State level Bankers \u2019 \nCommittee (SLBC) and lead banks may be ensured for sensitization \nof bank and branch staff for financial inclusion of urban poor.  \n \n8.6 It may be noted that the identification, selection, formation and \nmoni toring of SHGs who are to get interest subvention would be the \nresponsibility of State/ ULBs and banks would not be liable for wrong \nidentification of SHGs who get interest subvention.  \n \n8.7 Type of Loan Facility: SHGs can avail either Term loan or a Cash \nCredit Limit (CCL) loan or both based on their need.  In case of need, \nadditional loan can be sanctioned even though the previous loan is outstanding.  \n \n8.8 RBI guidelines for prompt repayment are as follows:     \n12 \n a. For Cash Credit Limit to SHGs:  \ni) Outstanding bal ance shall not have remained in excess of the \nsanctioned limit/drawing power continuously for more than 30 \ndays.  \n \nii) There sh all be regular credits and debits in the account. In any \ncase there shall be at least one customer induced credit during the month.  \n \niii) Customer induced Credits during a month shall be sufficient to \ncover the interest debited during the month.  \n \nb. For Term Loan to SHGs: A term loan account where all of the \ninterest payments and/or instalments of principal were paid within 30 \ndays of t he due date during the entire tenure of the loans would be \nconsidered as an account having prompt payment.  The prompt \npayment guidelines will continue to be guided by RBI guidelines on the subject in future.  \n 9. Progress Reporting for SEP -I, SEP-G & SEP- SHG  \n9.1 The ULB will prepare a data sheet of the applications recommended by \nthe TASK force along with their status details of the sanction, \ndisbursement and rejection (along with reasons) after validating the \nsame with the respective banks. This data sheet will be sent to SULM \non a monthly basis.  \n \n9.2 The SULM will compile all the reports received from respective ULBs \nand will communicate to M/o HUPA on a monthly basis.  \n \n9.3 SULM must ensure that progress under SEP is reviewed in every SLBC \nand District Co nsultative Committee (DCC) meetings. Any other \nimportant issue with regard to SEP may be taken up by SULM with \nSLBC convener bank for effective coordination and implementation.  \n \n10. Credit Card for enterprise development  \n10.1 The financial assistance to the individual entrepreneurs though subsidized loan for setting up of enterprises under DAY -NULM could \nbe viewed as initial impetus to facilitate livelihood support to the urban poor. However the individual entrepreneurs require further \nfinancial support in terms  of working capital to make the enterprise \neconomically sustainable. This may include immediate and short \nterm monthly requirement of cash for meeting expenses for \npurchase of goods, raw materials and other miscellaneous    \n13 \n expenditures etc. The micro- entrepr eneur does not have a regular \nfixed monthly cash inflow/income to meet expenses arising out of \nentrepreneurial activities. To approach a financial institution for such \nimmediate credit requirement, it requires procedural documentation \nand consumes a lot of  time. This need for working capital credit is \ngenerally met from informal sources of credit (including money \nlenders) which is typically available at high rate of interest.  \n \n10.2 In order to support the micro- entrepreneurs to meet their working \ncapital and mis cellaneous credit needs, DAY -NULM will facilitate \naccess to  Credit Cards  or MUDRA Card through banks.  \n \n10.3 The SULM in consultation with the State Level Bankers Committee \n(SLBC) will finalize the norms, limits and specifications for issuance \nof Credit  Card (or ) MUDRA Card to the individual entrepreneurs. The \nGeneral Credit Card Scheme (GCC), which is being implemented by \nall scheduled commercial banks or any other variant of credit cards \nfor enterprise development of banks in urban areas, may be \nexplored by SULM and SLBC for the same. The Circular on revised \nGCC scheme has been issued by RBI notification vide RPCD.MSME  \n& NFS.BC.No.61/06.02.31/2013- 14 dated December 02, 2013  \navailable on RBI web- site \u2018www.rbi.org.in \u2019. \n \n10.4 The ULB will identify the prospective beneficiaries and will facilitate \nlinkages with banks for issuance of credit cards. The focus is to \ninitially facilitate issuance of credit  card to cover all the beneficiaries \nwho have availed financial assistance under SEP.  Additionally,  other \nbeneficiaries who are running their own business but have not \navailed assistance under SEP may also be covered if they satisfy \nthe norms of issuance of credit cards.  \n \n10.5 The targets for the same may be decided at ULB level and the \nprogress under this component is aggregated at SULM level and \ncommunicated to M/o HUPA periodically.  \n \n11. Technology, Marketing and Other Support  \n \n11.1 Micro entrepreneurs often need support in order to grow and sustain \ntheir businesses. Support needed may be for establishment, \ntechnology, marketing, and other services. Micro entrepreneurs who \nrun very small businesses may need to gain a better understanding \nof what the market needs, demand of the products produced by \nthem, prices, where to sell, etc. Support services under this    \n14 \n component are envisaged with a view to provide an encouraging \nenvironment for development of micro enterprises.  \n \n11.2 The City Livelihoods Centers (CLCs) established und er DAY- NULM \nwill offer services to the micro- enterprises such as in establishment \n(licenses, certificates registration, legal services etc.), production, \nprocurement, technology, processing, marketing, sales, packaging, \naccounting etc. for long term sustai nability. CLC s will also provide \nsupport in taking up feasibility/ assessment studies on market demand and market strategy for products and services of micro -\nenterprises.  \n \n11.3 All SEP individual and groups enterprises can avail the services from \nCLCs as per the norms of CLCs. The CLCs with support of ULB may \nalso tie up with various other government schemes which offer \nservices and benefits for micro- enterprise development for the \nbenefit of prospective beneficiaries.  \n \n11.4 The SULM may arrange for additional funds/ professional assistance \nfor the purpose of providing above services to CLCs.  \n \n12. Funding Pattern of SEP of DAY -NULM  \n12.1 Funding under this component will be shared between the Centre \nand the States as per the general norms under DAY -NULM.  \n \n12.2 The Ministry will allo cate funds to the states on annual basis based \non the targets assigned to the states. The states in consultation with \nthe respective SLBCs and ULBs will decide the targets and \ncorresponding funds will be allocated to ULBs so that full \nreimbursement to the banks on account of Interest subvention is \nsettled during the financial year and no subvention amount remain \noverdue or pending with the States.  \n \n13. Monitoring and Evaluation \n13.1 The S tate Mission management Unit (SMMU)  at the State level and \nCity Mission Managem ent Unit (CMMU) at the ULB level will closely  \nmonitor progress of activities /targets under this component, \nundertake reporting and evaluation. The SULM and the \nULB/executing agencies shall report timely progress in formats \nprescribed by the Mission Directorate from time -to-time, indicating \nthe cumulative achievement monthly and up to the end of the quarter \nand key issues in implementation.  \n    \n15 \n 13.2 In addition, under DAY -NULM, a comprehensive and robust IT -\nenabled DAY -NULM MIS will be established for tracking targets and \nachievements. States and ULBs will be required to submit their \nprogress reports online and may also use this tool to monitor \nprogress on the ground. In the spirit of proactive disclosure of \ninformation and ensuring transparency under DAY -NULM, key \nprogress reports under SEP will also be made available in the public \ndomain in a timely manner.  \n \n13.3 All the SEP beneficiaries should be visited periodically to assess the \nimpact of the benefit and also to know any problem being faced by \nthem.  The Community Organisers (COs) should visit all the \nbeneficiaries in their jurisdiction at least once in three months.  The \nproject officer/ technical experts at CMMU level should visit at least 50% beneficiaries once in three months.  The observations during the \nfield visit  should be kept in record and be uploaded on MIS also.  \n \n13.4 During the field visit mentioned above data on economic status of the beneficiaries should be collected and be compared with similar \ndata given in loan application form, to know the impact of the benefit \non the economic conditions of the beneficiaries.  \n \n13.5 Impact analysis studies may also be conducted at suitable interval to assess the impact of benefit under SEP on the economic status of \nthe beneficiaries.  \n \n13.6 To monitor progress of the targets vis -a-vis achievement under DAY -\nNULM, Banks are advised to furnish cumulative progress reports on \nquarterly basis as per enclosed proforma ( Annex III  & IV) to the \nDirector, UPA at dupa- mhupa@nic.in as well as to RBI on email  \nlatest by the end of next month of the quarter to which they relate.  \n \n13.7 Unique Code for loans under NULM:  Banks are advised to \ncategorise these loans under Non- Farm sector and use unique sub-\ncode in their database for loans granted under NULM. Further, \nseparate sub- sub-codes may also be assigned for SEP -I, SEP- G, \nSHG and WSHGs. Proper care must be taken while classifying loans \nunder NULM parti cularly relating to SHG and WSHGs  to enable \ndistinct identification of these loans vis- \u00e0-vis NRLM loans as WSHGs \nare eligible for additional 3 percent interest subvention.  \n \n \n \n    \n16 \n                               ANNEX- I  \nINTEREST SUBSIDY CLAIMS UNDER DEENDAYAL ANTYODAYA \nYOJANA - NATIONAL URBAN LIVELIHOODS MISSION (DAY- NULM)  \n \n1.

This Master Circular is placed in our website www.rbi.org.in . \n \n \nYours faithfully  \n \n \n \n(P. Vijaya Kumar)  \nChief General Manager  \n \n \nEncl. As above  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nANNEX  \nMaster Circular \u2013 Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated July 03 , 201 7 \n1.  Facility for exchange of notes and coins at bank branches  \n(a) All branches of banks in all parts of the country are mandated to provide the \nfollowing customer services, more actively and vigorously to the members of public \nso that there is no need for them to approach the RBI Regional Offices for this \npurpose:  \n(i) Issuing fresh / good quality notes and coins of all denominations on demand,  \n(ii) Exchanging soiled  / mutilated / defective notes, and  \n(iii) Accepting coins and notes either for transactions or exchange. In terms of \nsection 6 (1) of The Coinage Act, 2011, the coins issued under the authority of \nsection 4 shall be a legal tender in payment or on account , in case of : - \na) a coin of any denomination not lower than one rupee, for any sum not \nexceeding one thousand rupees;  \n \nb) a half -rupee coin, for any sum not exceeding ten rupees:  \nProvided that the coin has not been defaced and has not lost weight so as to be l ess \nthan such weight as may be prescribed in its case.  \n(b) All branches should provide the above facilities to members of public without any \ndiscrimination on all working days. The scheme of providing exchange facility by a \nfew select currency chest branches on one of the Sundays in a month will remain \nunchanged.  The names and addresses of such bank branches should be available \nwith the respective banks.  \n(c) The availability of the above -mentioned facilities at the bank branches should be \ngiven wide publicity for information of the public at large.  \n(d) None of the  bank branches should refuse to accept small denomination notes \nand / or coins tendered at their counters.  \n2.  Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 - Delegation of powers  \n(a) In terms of Section 28 read with Section 58 (2) of Reserve Bank of Ind ia Act, \n1934, no person is entitled as a right to recover from the Government of India or RBI \nthe value of any lost, stolen, mutilated or imperfect currency note of the GOI or \nbanknote. However, with a view to mitigating the hardship to the public in genui ne \ncases, it has been provided that the RBI may, with the previous sanction of the \nCentral Government, prescribe the circumstances in, and the conditions and \nlimitations subject to which, the value of such currency notes or banknotes may be \nrefunded as a m atter of grace.   \n \n2 \n (b) With a view to extending the facility for the benefit and convenience of public, all \nbranches of banks have been delegated powers under Rule 2(j) of Reserve Bank of \nIndia (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 for exchange of mutilated / defective notes free of \ncost.  \n3. Liberalized definition of a Soiled Note  \nIn order to facilitate quicker exchange facilities, the definition of soiled note has been \nexpanded . A \u2018soiled note\u2019 means a note which has become dirty due to normal wear  \nand tear and also includes a two piece note pasted together wherein both the pieces \npresented belong to the same note and form the entire note with no essential feature \nmissing. These notes should be accepted over bank counters in payment of \nGovernment dues and for credit to accounts of t he public maintained with banks. \nHowever, in no case, these notes should be issued to the public as re -issuable notes \nand shall be deposited in currency chests for onward transmission to RBI offices as \nsoiled note remittances for further processing.  \n4. Mut ilated Notes \u2013 Presentation and Passing  \nA mutilated note is a note of which a portion is missing or which is composed of \nmore than two pieces. Mutilated notes may be presented at any of the bank \nbranches. The notes so presented shall be accepted, exchanged  and adjudicated in \naccordance with Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules 2009.  \n5. Extremely brittle, burnt, charred, stuck up Notes  \nNotes which have turned extremely brittle or are badly burnt, charred or inseparably \nstuck up together and, therefore, cannot withstand normal handling, shall not be \naccepted by the bank branches for exchange. Instead, the holders may be advised \nto tender these notes to the concerned Issue Office where they will be adjudicated \nunder a Special Procedure.  \n6. Procedure for ex change of soiled/ mutilated/ imperfect notes  \n6.1 Exchange of soiled notes  \n \n \n6.1.1  Notes presented in small number : Where the number of notes presented by a \nperson is up to 20 pieces with a maximum value of ` 5000 per day, banks should \nexchange them over the counter, free of charge.  \n \n \n6.1.2 Notes presented in bulk : Where the number of notes presented by a person \nexceeds 20 pieces or ` 5000 in value per day, banks may accept them, against \nreceipt, for value to be credited later. Banks may levy service charges as permitted \nin Master Circular on Customer Ser vice in Banks \n(DBR.No.Leg.BC.21/09.07.006/ 2015 -16 dated July 1, 2015 ). In case tendered value \nis above ` 50000, banks a re expected to take the usual precautions.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n3 \n 6.2 Exchange of mutilated and imperfect notes  \n \n6.2.1 While designated branches may continue to follow the procedure as laid down \nin Part III of NRR, 2009 ( www.rbi.org.in  \u2192Publications\u2192Occassional) for exchanging \nmutilated and imperfect notes and issue receipt for the notes presented for \nadjudication, non -chest branches are required to follow the following procedure for \nnotes presented in small numbers and in bulk.  \n \n6.2.2 Notes presented in small number :  Where the number of notes presented by a \nperson is up to 5 pieces, non -chest branches should normally adjudicate the notes \nas per the procedure laid down in Part III of NRR, 2009 and pay the exchange value \nover the counter.  If the non -chest branches are not able to adjudicate the mutilated \nnotes, the notes may be received against a receipt and sent to the linked currency \nchest branch for adjudication. The probable date of payment should be informed to \nthe tenderers on the re ceipt itself and the same should not exceed 30 days. Bank \naccount details should be obtained from the tenderers for crediting the exchange \nvalue by electronic means.  \n \n6.2.3 Notes presented in bulk: Where the number of notes presented by a person is \nmore than 5 pieces not exceeding ` 5000 in value, should be advised to send such \nnotes to nearby currency chest branch by insured post giving his / her bank account \ndetails (a/c no, branch name, IFSC, etc. ) or get them exchanged thereat in person. \nAll other persons tendering mutilated notes whose value exceeds ` 5000 should be \nadvised to approach nearby currency chest branch. Currency chest branches \nreceiving mutilated notes through insured post should cred it the exchange value to \nthe account of sender by electronic means within 30 days of receipt of notes.  \n \n6.3 Tenderers aggrieved with the service provided by the banks in this regard may \napproach Banking Ombudsman concerned, following the procedure as laid  under \nBanking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006 with the bank /postal receipts as proof for \nnecessary action.  \n \n7. Notes bearing \"PAY\"/\"PAID\" \"REJECT\" stamps  \n(a) Every Officer -in-charge of the branch i.e. the Branch Manager and every Officer -\nin-charge of the Accounts  or Cash Wing of the Branch shall act as 'Prescribed \nOfficer' in each branch to adjudicate the notes received at the branch for exchange in \naccordance with Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009. After \nadjudicating mutilated notes, the Prescribed Officer is required to record his order by \nsubscribing his initials to the dated 'PAY'/ 'PAID'/ 'REJECT' stamp. The 'PAY' /'PAID' \n& 'REJECT' stamps should also carry the name of the bank and branch concerned \nand held under the custody of the 'Prescribed Of ficer' to avoid misuse.  \n \n(b) Mutilated / defective notes bearing 'PAY'/'PAID' (or 'REJECT') stamp of any RBI \nIssue Office or any bank branch, if presented for payment again at any of the bank \nbranches should be rejected under Rule 6(2) of Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) \nRules, 20 09 and the tenderer should be advised that the value of such note/s cannot \nbe paid since the same has already been paid as is evident from the PAY/PAID  \n \n4 \n stamps affixed on it/them. All bank branches have instructions not to issue notes \nbearing PAY/PAID stamp s to the public even through oversight. The branches \nshould caution their customers not to accept such notes from any bank or anybody \nelse.  \n8. Notes bearing slogans / political messages, etc.  \nAny note with slogans and message of a political nature written across it ceases to \nbe a legal tender and the claim on such a note will be rejected under Rule 6(3) (iii) of \nReserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009. Similarly, notes which are \ndisfigured may also be rejected under Rule 6(3) (ii) of Reserve Bank of  India (Note \nRefund) Rules, 2009  \n9. Deliberately cut notes  \nThe notes, which are found to be deliberately cut, torn, altered or tampered with, if \npresented for payment of exchange value should be rejected under Rule 6(3)(ii) of \nthe Reserve Bank of India (No te Refund) Rules, 2009. Although it is not possible to \nprecisely define deliberately cut notes, a close look at such notes will clearly reveal \nany deliberate fraudulent intention, as the manner in which such notes are mutilated \nwill follow a broad uniformi ty in the shape/location of missing portions of the notes, \nespecially when the notes are tendered in large numbers. The details of the case \nsuch as the name of the tenderer, the number of notes tendered and their \ndenominations should be reported thereafter  to the Deputy/General Manager, Issue \nDepartment, under whose jurisdiction the branch falls. The matter should also be \nreported to local police in case a large number of such notes are tendered.  \n10. Training  \nOur Issue Offices conduct training programmes fo r 'Prescribed Officers' of bank \nbranches on a priority basis. As the training programmes are intended to provide \nknowledge and in  still confidence in the Prescribed Officers in the process of \nadjudication of defective notes, it is imperative that the Presc ribed Officers of the \nbranches are deputed for such programmes.  \n11. Display of Notice Board  \nAll bank branches are required to display at their branch premises, at a prominent \nplace, a board indicating the availability of note exchange facility with the le gend, \n\"SOILED/MUTILATED NOTES ARE ACCEPTED AND EXCHANGED HERE\" for \ninformation of general public. Banks should ensure that all their branches provide \nfacility for exchange of notes and coins not only to their customers but also others. \nHowever, they should  ensure that the note exchange facility is not cornered by \nmoney changers / dealers in defective notes.  \n12. Disposal of notes adjudicated at bank branches  \nRegarding audit of the notes adjudicated by bank branches, the full value paid notes \nhave to be remit ted by all branches to the chest branches with which they have been \nlinked and therefrom to the Issue Offices concerned together with the next soiled  \n \n5 \n note remittance in the manner already laid down. The half value paid notes and \nrejected notes, which are h eld by the chest  branches in their cash balance, may \neither be remitted separately packed together with the full value paid notes or sent \nby registered and insured post as and when required. The full value paid notes will \nbe treated as chest remittance by the Issue Office while the half value paid notes \nand rejected notes will be treated as notes tendered for adjudication and processed \naccordingly. All chest  branches are required to submit to our Issue Offices a monthly \nstatement showing the number of notes adjudicated during the month.  \n13. Uncurrent Coins  \nThe coins of 25 paise  and below, issued from time to time, ceased to be legal tender \nfor payments as well as account with effect from June 30, 2011 in terms of Gazette \nNotification No. 2529 dated December 20, 2010 issued by the Government of India. \nThe coins of 25 paise and be low which ceased to be legal tender are requ ired to be \ndispatched to Issue O ffices of RBI concerned  on receipt of advice from the O ffice \nand in the manner specified by the Office  \n14. Monitoring and Control  \n(a) The Regional Managers / Zonal Managers of the banks may pay surprise visits to \nthe branches and report the position of compliance in this regard to the Head Office \nwhich will review such reports and take prompt remedial action, wherever necessary.  \n(b) Any non-compliance in this regard shall be viewed as violation of instructions \nissued by the Reserve Bank of India.  \n \n   \n \n6 \n Master Circular \u2013 Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated July 03, 2017  \n           List of circulars / notifications consolidated by  the Master Circular  \nSr. \nNo. Circular / Notification No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

The current Medium Term Framework (MTF) for FPI investment in Central \nGovernment Securities (G -secs) and State Government Securities (SDLs) was \nintroduced in October 2015 with the following major features: \na. Limits to be specified as a percentage of outstanding Stock \u2013 5% for G -secs; \n2% for SDLs, to be achieved by 31 March 2018, through half yearly reviews \nand quarterly increases.  \nb. Minimum tenor of investments at 3 years. \nc. 20% cap on FPI investment in any particular security. \nd. Preference for long-term investors \u2013 Allocation of 60% for \u2018long term\u2019 \ncategory and 40% for \u2018General\u2019 category.  \ne. Transfer of unutilized limits in \u2018Long Term\u2019 category to \u2018General\u2019 category.  \n 2 \n 3. Currently \u2018long term\u2019 category of FPI investors accounts for about 20% of the total \ninvestment by FPIs in Central Government securities. In order to recalibrate the Framework to meet the objective of a preference for long- term investors and also \nwith a view to manage the macro-prudential implications of evolving capital flows, the MTF has been reviewed. Based on the review, the following modifications are made \nto the Framework. \na. The overall cap of 5% for Central Government securities (G -Secs) and 2% for \nState Development Loans (SDLs) remain unchanged.  \nb. Future increases in the limit for FPI investment in Central Government securities will be allocated in the following ratio - 75% for \u2018Long-Term\u2019 category of FPIs and \n25% for \u2018General\u2019 category.  \nc. The practice of transferring unutilized limits of \u2018Long-Term\u2019 category to \u2018General\u2019 \ncategory of FPIs is done away with.  \nd. To harmonize the approach to FPI investments in SDLs  with that for Central \nGovernment securities, future increases in SDLs would be in the ratio of 75% for \n\u2018Long Term\u2019 category and 25% for \u2018General\u2019 category of FPIs.    \n \n4. RBI may, in future, continue to calibrate some features of the MTF depending on the evolving macro-economic conditions.  \n \nRevision of Limits for the Jul-Sep 2017 Quarter  \n5. The limits for investment by FPIs in Central Government Securities and State Development Loans (SDLs) for the quarter July -September 2017 are increased by \nINR 110 billion and INR 61 billion, respectively, and allocated as under:-  \n \nLimits for FPI investmen t in Government Securities  \n                           (INR Billion)                                          \n Central Government \nsecurities State Development \nLoans  \nAggregate  \nGeneral  Long \nTerm  Total  General  Long \nTerm  Total  \nExisting \nLimits  1,849  461 2,310  270 -- 270 2,580  \nRevised \nlimits  1,877  543 2,420  285 46 331 2,751  \n 3 \n  \n6. The revised limits will be effective from July 4, 2017. \n7. All other existing conditions, including the security -wise limits, investment of coupons \nbeing permitted outside the limits and investments being restricted to securities with a minimum residual maturity of three years, will continue to apply.  \n8.

The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the \nCentral and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the \nagency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual \nagreement. RBI pays agency commission to the a gency banks for the gover nment \nbusiness handled by them. This Master Circular consolidates the instructions \ncontained in the circulars listed in Annex  1. \nGovernment transactions eligible for a gency commission \n2. Transactions relating to the following government business undertaken by \nagency banks are eligible for agency commission:  \n(a) Revenue receipts  and payments on behalf of the Central/State Government  \n(b) Pension payments in respect of Central / State Governments  \n(c) Special Deposit Scheme (SDS) 1975  \n(d) Public Provident Fund (PPF) Scheme, 1968 \n(e) Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) , 2004 \n(f) Kisan Vikas Patra, 2014 and Sukanya Samriddhi Account  \n(g) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank as eligible for \nagency commission (viz. Relief Bonds/ Savings Bonds etc. transactions)  \n3. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from \nfinancial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commission as these \ntransactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business.  \nReserve Bank pays the agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for \nacting as agents for management of public debt. Transactions arising out of Letter s \nof Credit / Bank Guarantee opened by banks on behalf of Ministries/Departments etc. do not qualify for agency commi ssion.  \n4. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical mode or e- mode \n(challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the \nagency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive \nremuneration from the State Government for doing this work.  \n5. If the agency bank is engaged by t he State Government as Franking Vendor \nand it collects stamp duty from the public for franking the documents, it will not be \neligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to \nit as Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects  the stamp duty paid \nby the Franking Vendor for credit to the Treasury through challan in physical or e-mode for purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since \nit is a regular payment of Stamp Duty as stated above.   \n6. All agency banks while claiming agency  commission should certify that no \nclaim of agency commission is made on ineligible transactions . \n7. Agency banks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or \nthrough authorised branches of State Bank of India or offices of Reserve Bank of India wherever they do not have their own authorised direct tax collection branch 3 \n should indicate the same separately in the scroll. Such transactions will not be \neligible for payment of agency commission. Banks shoul d furnish a certificate to the \neffect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) paid by them have been excluded while claiming agency commission.  \nIn this connection, it is clarified that the following activities do not come under the purview of  agency bank business and are therefore not eligible for payment of \nagency commission.  \n(a) Furnishing of bank guarantees/security deposits, etc . through agency  banks \nby government contractors/suppliers, which constitute banking transactions undertaken by banks for their customers.  \n(b) The banking business of autonomous/statutory bodies /Municipalities / \nCorporations/Local Bodies.    \n(c) Payments of a capital nature such as capital contributions/subsidies/grants \nmade by governments to cover losses incurred by autonomous/statutory bodies / \nMunicipalities/ Corporations/Local Bodies.  \n(d) Prefunded schemes which may be implemented by a Central Government \nMinistry/Department (in consultation with CGA) and a State Government \nDepartment through any bank .  \nRates for agency commission \n8. As per paragraph 5 of the a gency bank agreement, RBI pays agency \ncommission at rates determined by it. The rates applicable with effect from July 1, \n2012 are as under:  \nSr. No. Type of Transaction  Unit Revised Rate  \na.  (i) Receipts - Physica l mode  Per transaction   \u20b9 50/- \n     (ii) Receipts - e-mode  Per transaction   \u20b9 12/- \nb. Pension Payments  Per transaction   \u20b9 65/- \nc. Payments other than Pension  Per   \u20b9 100 turnover  5.5 paise  \n \n9. In this context, the \u2018Receipts -e-mode transactions\u2019 indicated agai nst Sr. No. \na.(ii) in  the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from \nthe remitter\u2019s bank account through internet banking as well as such transactions  \nwhich do not involve physical  receipt of cash /instruments  at all . For example,  \nchallan generated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with cash / \ninstrument should be treated as transaction under physical mode.   \n \n10. With reference to the implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) \nregime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number \n(CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if \nmultiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This 4 \n means that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would \nconstitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records clubbed under a single challan \ni.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming \nagency commission. This will come into effect from July 1, 2017.  \n \n11. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that \na single challan ( electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only \nand not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains multiple major head/sub \nmajor head/minor head of accounts that will get credited.  Therefore, records clubbed \nunder a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single \ntransaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission.   \n12. Agency banks would be eligible to claim agency commission for pension \ntransactions at the rate of \u20b9 65/- per transaction only when the entire work relating to \ndisbursement of pension including pension calc ulation is attended to by them .  If the \nwork relating to pension calculations, etc., is attended to by the concerned \nGovernment Department  / Treasury and the bank branches are required only to \ncredit the amount of pension to the pensioners' accounts maintained with them by a single debit to Government Account, such transaction is to be categori sed under \n\u2018other than pension payment\u2019 and would be eligible for payment of agency \ncommission @ 5.5 paise per \u20b9  100/- turnover w.e.f. July 1, 2012.  \n13. Agency commission is payable to an agency bank at the full rate provided the \ntransactions are handled by the bank at all stages.  Where, however, the work is \nshared between two banks, the agency commission is shared between the banks in \nthe proportion of 75:25.  Thus, broadly, the agency commission is payable to the \nagency  banks as detailed below:  \n(a) At the full rate, in cases where the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages, i.e. , up to the stage of dispatch of scrolls and challans / cheques to the \nPay and Accounts Offices,  and treasuries/sub- treasuries .  \n(b) At 75% of the applicable  rate, where the dealing branch is required to account \nfor the transaction by passing on the scrolls and documents to the \nlocal/neares t branch of Reserve Bank of India or any agency bank conducting \ngovernment business.  \n(c) At 25% of the applicable rate, in the case of agency branch which received the scrolls and documents from dealing branches of other banks and is \nresponsible for the account ing of these transactions and dispatching of the \nscrolls and documents to the Pay and Accounts Offices, Treasuries, etc.  \n14. The number of transactions eligible for payment of agency commission should \nnot exceed 14 per pensioner per year.  This includes o ne monthly credit for payment \nof net pension and a maximum of two per year for payment of arrears on account of \nincrease in dearness relief, if applicable. Cases involving payment of arrears on \naccount of late start/restart of pension qualifies as a single transaction for claiming of \nagency commission. In other words, any payment of arrears on account of late 5 \n start/restart of pension should be treated as a single credit transaction and not as \nseparate monthly credits.    \nClaiming  agency commission  \n15. Agenc y banks are required to submit their claims for agency commission in \nthe prescribed format  to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions \nand the respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for State government \ntransactions . The revised formats for claiming agency commission for all agency \nbanks and separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the branch \nofficials and Chartered Accountants are given in Annex -2.  These certificates would \nbe in addition to the usual Certif icate from ED  / CGM (in charge of government  \nbusiness ) to the effect that there are no pension arrears to be credited / delays in \ncrediting regular pension / arrears thereof.    \n16. Where the External Auditor is also the Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Audit or, \nclaims can be certified by such Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor.  The auditor\u2019s certificate should, inter -alia, state that:  \n(a) \u2018receipt\u2019 and \u2018pension payment transactions\u2019 as also the agency \ncommission claims for \u2018payments other than pension payments\u2019 indicated \nin the agency commission claim application submitted to the RBI are tallied with the records maintained at the concerned branch/es of the  agency bank; and \n(b) the agency commission claims made in respect of volume (number) based \ntransactions viz . \u2018receipt\u2019 and \u2018pension payment transactions\u2019 have been \nclaimed only once and the same stands excluded while arriving at value based transactions in respect of \u2018payments other than pension payments\u2019.  \nIn addition to this, agency banks are required to ensur e that the agency bank\u2019s \ninternal inspectors / a uditors verify the agency commission claims submitted by their \nbranches and confirm their accuracy during the course of their i nspection / a udit.  \n17. Agency banks are required to ensure that agency commission claims \nsubmitted to the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India / Central Accounts \nSection, Nagpur in the prescribed format are accurate.  Agency banks may also alert \ntheir branches concerned to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to our \nRegional Offices are accurate.  Such erroneous claims, if certified by the Internal / \nConcurrent Auditors, will defeat the very purpose of making such requirement an essential condition for making quarterly claims.  \n18. Agency banks are advised to furnish thei r claim on agency commission to \nReserve Bank from two quarters to 90 days from the end of the quarter in which the \ntransactions have been conducted.  If the banks fail to lodge the claims within the \nstipulated period mentioned above they may forward the same only after giving \nreasons for delay.  This will be applicable for the agency commission claims for the \nquarter ended June 30, 2017 onwards.   \n19. RBI decided to reimburse agency banks the amount of Service Tax paid by \nthem on agency commission with effec t from July 1, 2012.  6 \n  \nDeduction of TDS on Agency Commission \n20. Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has clarified that \u2018tax would not be \nrequired to be deducted by RBI on the agency  commission paid or credited by it to \nagency banks for transacting general banking business of the Central Government \nand State Government s\u2019. However, agency commission would  be taxable in the \naccounts of banks concerned as it is part of the bank\u2019s income.  \n \nPenal interest for wrong claims \n21. Agency banks will be liable to pay penal interest at Bank Rate as notified by \nReserve Bank of India plus 2% for any wrong claims of agency commission settled.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 \n Annex 1 \nList of circulars consolidated in the Master Circular  \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

This M aster \nCircular consolidates important instructions on the subject issued by the Reserve Bank till June 30,  2017. It does not replace or supersede such existing government \ninstructions. In case of any doubt or apparent contradiction, agency banks may be \nguided by the relevant government instructions. Various circulars  issued in this \nconnection by the Reserve Bank of India are summarised hereunder for information.  \nGeneral Instructions \nGovernment orders on DR, etc. on websites \n2. In order to obviate the time lag between issue of DR orders and payment of DR to the \nbeneficiary and to render expeditious service to senior citizens, the following action is \nrequired to be taken:  \n(a) As soon as the sanction of Dearness Relief at revised rates is received from \nMinistry of  Finance, orders for payment of Dearness Relief to pensioners at \nrevised rates are issued and the copies of such orders are immediately sent to Heads of all Agency Banks by e- mail as well as by FAX with instructions to take \nnecessary action for expeditious  payment of Dearness Relief.  \n(b) The orders are put on website of Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievance and \nPensions ( http://www.persmin.nic.in\n) \n(c) Copies of orders are also sent by post to Heads of all Agency Banks  and \npublished in leading newspapers by Indian Banks' Association.  \n(d) Pension paying agency banks should act on the copies of the orders supplied by \nGovernment to the Head Offices and/or Regional Offices of authorised banks in \nthe State headquarters or hosted  on the website of the State Government.  \n(e) The Controlling Offices/ Head Offices of agency banks should closely monitor \nand supervise timely and correct disbursement of Government pension to eligible \npensioners.  \nNomination \n3. With a view to avoiding inconvenience to pensioners, all pension paying branches to \naccept Nomination Forms \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 as the case may be, submitted by Central \nCivil/Railway pensioners for the payment of arrears of pension to the heir(s).  \n4. In the case of Central Civil and Railway pensi oners, the pension paying banks should \nendorse the names of nominees as per nomination forms \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 on the front page of \nthe pass book and the branches may be advised to ensure that the procedure laid down in Schemes for disbursement of pension to pensioners by public sector banks are \nfollowed scrupulously.  \n \n   3 \n  \nAll India Service officers retiring from Government of India \n5. The accounting procedure to be followed for payment of pension to All India Service \nOfficers retiring from Government of India while on Central Deputation is given below:  \n(a) PPO number for All India Service Pensioners would incorporate, besides the 12 \ndigit numeric component used for Central Civil pensioner, a prefix indicating the service and the state cadre to which the pensioner belongs. A sample PPO \nnumber for an IAS Officer of Punjab cadre would be \u2013  IAS/Pb/438840400191.  \n(b) All India Service Pensioners will have the option to draw pension only through the authorised banks.  \n(c) The Special Seal Authority (SSA) issued by the CPAO would be in blue colour to \ndistinguish it from authorities issued for Central Civil pensioners. In addition, the authority will indicate the State Government to which the payment is debitable.  \n(d) One copy of the SSA will be sent to the concerned Accountant General for information and record.  \n(e) The concerned paying branches of the bank , after following the necessary \nprocedure for identifying the pensioner , would release the payment and add the \nname of All India Service Pensioner to the scrolls prepared for State Government \nPensioners to be routed for reimbursement to the reimbursing branches of the Reserve Bank/ State Bank as the case may be. Such scrolls are NOT  being \nhandled under Single Window System of pension reimbursement for Central \nGovernment Civil Pensioners and should not therefore be sent to CPAO . \n(f) The reimbursing branches would follow the procedure for the State Government \nPensioners and send advice to Reserve Bank, CAS, Nagpur and the \ncorresponding scrolls to the concerned Accountant General.  \n(g) The RBI, CAS, Nagp ur would debit the concerned State Government Account as \nper the procedure.  \nCredit of pension to joint account  \n6. Various Central Government M inistries  and State Governments  have modified the \nscheme for payment of pension permitting credit of pension also to a joint account \noperated by pensioner with his/her spouse in whose favour an authorisation for family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO). The joint account  of the pensioner \nwith the spouse could be operated either by 'Former or Survivor' or 'Either or Survivor' \nbasis subject to the following terms and conditions:  \n(a) Once pension has been credited to a pensioner's bank account, the liability of the \ngovernment/bank ceases. No further liability arises, even if the spouse wrongly \ndraws the amount.  \n(b) As pension is payable only during the life of a pensioner, his/her death shall be \nintimated to the bank at the earliest and in any case within one month of the demise, so that the bank does not continue crediting monthly pension to the joint account with the spouse, after the death of the pensioner. If, however, any amount has been wrongly credited to the joint account, it shall be recoverable from the joint account and/or any other account held by the pensioner/spouse either individually or jointly. The legal heirs, successors, executors, etc., shall also be liable to refund any amount, which has been wrongly credited to the joint \naccount.  4 \n (c) Payment of Arrears of Pension (Nom ination) Rules 1983 would continue to be \napplicable to a Joint Account with the pensioner's spouse. This implies that if \nthere is an 'accepted nomination' in accordance with rules 5 and 6 of these \nRules, arrears mentioned in the rules shall be payable to t he nominee.  \n7. Existing pensioners desiring to get their pension credited to a joint account as \nindicated above are required to submit an application to the bank branch, from where they are presently drawing pension in the prescribed form. This would also be signed by the pensioner's spouse in token of having accepted the terms and conditions laid down by the Ministry/Government concerned. The facility is applicable to existing / future \npensioners.  \n8. The scheme of some states/ministries add that opening of  joint account with any \nother person for credit of pension, except the spouse in whose favour family pension is \nauthorised in the PPO, shall not be permissible. Family pensioners are also not covered under the revised scheme. For specific details, the scheme of each individual \nMinistry/State Government may be examined.  \nRecording of PPO Number in the passbook of Pensioners / Family Pensioners  \n9.  It has been decided to record the PPO number in all the pension passbooks of the \npensioners/family pensioners iss ued to them. This is to alleviate the difficulties reported \nby pensioners/family pensioners to get duplicate Pension Payment Orders (PPO) in case of missing of original PPO, transfer of pension account from one bank/branch to another bank/branch, commencem ent of family pension to spouse or dependent \nchildren after the death of pensioner, etc. in the absence of ready availability of PPO numbers. Necessary instructions in this regard have already been issued to all authorised banks by the Central Pension Accounting Office vide their \nOffice \nMemorandum CPAO/Tech/Clarifications/P&PW/2014- 15/426- 497 dated September 17, \n2014  and Office of Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (Pension) vide their \nCircular No.185 dated November 28, 2016 . All agency banks are advised to record the \nPPO numbers on the passbook of pensioners/family pensioners.  \n \nIssue of Pension Slip \n10. It has been decided by Central Pension Accounting Office (CPAO)/Ministry of \nDefence/Railway and various State Governments  to issue pension slips to their \npensioners including family pensioners. Accordingly,  pension slips as per the prescribed \nformat are to be issued to these pensioners/family pensioners at the commencement of pension and thereafter, whenever there is a change in quantum of pension. Both halves of the Pension Payment Order (PPO) would also need to be updated. All agency banks \nwere advised to issue suitable instructions to their pension paying branches.  \nStaggering of pension payments \n11. Payment of pension only on the last day of the month causes much hardship to \npensioners as they have to wait  in queue for a long time to collect their pension. As per \ninstructions issued in 1995, agency banks were advised to spread disbursal of pension over the last four working days of the month, except for the month of March, which will \ncontinue to be credited on or after the first working day of April.  \n \n 5 \n  \nRecovery of excess/wrong payment made to a pensioner  \n12. Details of the uniform procedure evolved for recovery of excess/wrong payments \nmade to pensioners drawing pensions under the Scheme for payment of pension to \nCentral /Civil/Defence/Railways pensioners through agency  banks, are given below:  \na) As soon as the excess/wrong payment made to a pensioner comes to the notice of \nthe paying branch, the branch should adjust the same against the amount standing to \nthe credit to the pensioner\u2019s account to the extent possible including lumpsum arrears \npayment.  \nb) If the entire amount of overpayment cannot be adjusted from the account, the \npensioner may be asked to pay forthwith the balance amount of overpayment.  \nc) In case the pensioner expresses his inability to pay the amount, the same may be \nadjusted from the future pension payments to be made to the pensioners. For \nrecovering the overpayment made to pensioner from his future pension payment in instalments 1/3rd o f net (pension + relief) payable each month may be recovered unless \nthe pensioner concerned gives consent in writing to pay a higher instalment amount.  \nd) If the overpayment cannot be recovered from the pensioner due to his death or discontinuance of pensi on then action has to be taken as per the letter of undertaking \ngiven by the pensioner under the scheme.  \ne) The pensioner may also be advised about the details of over payment/wrong \npayment and mode of its recovery.  \n \nRefund of excess pension payment to Government   \n13. Whenever any excess / overpayment is detected the entire amount thereof should \nbe credited to the Government account in lump sum immediately when the excess/overpayment is due to an error on the part of the agency bank. If the \nexcess/wrong pay ment to the pensioner is due to errors committed by the government, \nthey may take up the matter with the full particulars of the cases with respective \nGovernment Department for a quick resolution of the matter. However, this must be a time bound exercise and the government authority\u2019s acknowledgement to this effect must be kept on the bank\u2019s record. The banks may take up such cases with government \ndepartments without reference to the Reserve Bank of India.  \nWithdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners  \n14. In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners \nin withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorise \nsuch pensioners as under:  \n\u2022 Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the \nbank  \n\u2022 Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also \nnot even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form \ndue to certain physical defect / incapacity.  \n15. With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their \naccounts, banks may follow the procedure as under:  6 \n \u2022 Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should \nbe identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom \nshould be a responsible bank official.  \n\u2022 Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also \nwould not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained on the cheque/withdraw al form, which should be identified by two independent \nwitnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official.  \nAccordingly, the agency banks are requested to instruct their branches to display the \ninstructions issued in this regard on their notice board so that sick and disabled \npensioners could make full use of these facilities. Banks are also advised to sensitise \nstaff members in the matter and to refer to the FAQs on pension disbursement hosted \non our website www.rbi.org.in\n in case of any doubt.  \nReimbursement of pension payments  \n16. Link branches of agency banks may submit reimbursement claims to Reserve Bank \nof India, Public Accounts Departments/ Central Accounts Section, Nagpur for \nCentral/State Government pension payments.  \nContinuation of either or survivor pension account after death of pensioner  \n17. All agency banks disbursing Central Government pension have been advised that in \ncase the spouse (Family pensioner) opts for existing joint account for credit of family pension, banks should not insist on opening a new account when the spouse is the survivor and having a joint account with the pensioner and in whose favour an authorisation for payment of family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO).  \n \nDigital Life Certificate  \n18. As per the present pension scheme, pensioners are required to furnish a life \ncertificate to the pension disbursing bank every year in November. In view of the difficulties faced by pensioners in submission of these certificates , and in order to \nalleviate these difficulties, the Government of India has since launched \u201cJeevan Pramaan\u201d, a digital life certificate based on Aadhaar Biometric Authentication on November 10, 2014. In order to facilitate Jeevan Pramaan, a web portal (jeevanpramaan.gov.in) was launched on November 10, 2014. All agency banks disbursing government pension may take necessary steps to implement and benefit from the scheme and issue necessary instructions to all their branches concerned and dealing staff. They are requested to work towards creating awareness about this facility amongst their pensioner customers through their branches, websites and other means. \nBanks may also suitably amend the FAQs on pension payments.  \n19. There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of \npension paying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to mandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgem ents. They were also requested to \nconsider entering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement \nas well as real time updation of records.  \nPayment of Central Civil Pension \n(a) Pension Payment Orders  7 \n 20. Some of the Pension Paying Bank branches do not update the amount of basic \npension/family pension whenever there is change in basic rates in both halves of the Pension Payment Order (PPO) concerned. In this connection, paragraphs 12.17 and 19.1 of the \"Scheme for Payment of Pensions to Central Government Civil Pensioners by Public Sector Banks\u201d are reproduced below:  The details of the scheme are available \nat http://cpao.nic.in/pdf/scheme_bookle_new.pdf\n  \u201cWhenever there is change in the \nbasic rates of pension and/or dearness relief on pension, the paying branch shall call back the pensioner's half of the PPO and record thereon the changes, indicating, inter -\nalia, the date(s) from which the changes are effective. After this is done, those halves \nwill be returned to the pensioners.\u201d (Para 12.17).  \n\u201cWhenever any additional relief on pensions is sanctioned by Government, an intimation \nto this effect will be sent by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare) to the authorised representative (by name) of each nominated public sector bank at the address given by the latter. Thereafter, it shall be the responsibility of the banks to collect through their representatives operating at Delhi or otherwise, the required number of copies (to be intimated in advance) of the sanction orders, along with the ready -reckoner relating \nthereto, from the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare) and send them immediately to their respective Head Offices for direct transmission to the paying branches within ten days for implementation. Each paying branch will promptly determine the revised rates of relief on pensions payable to the Central Government Civil Pensioners under its payment. The calculations of these rates applicable to individual pensioners would be made as in Annexure XXII (Page 50) and they will b e noted in disburser's portion of the PPOs along \nwith the date from which relief would take effect, under attestation by the Branch Manager or In -Charge before commencing payment of relief at the revised rates and/or \npayment of arrears, if any, due to the pensioners on this account\u2026\u201d (Para 19.1).  \nAgency banks may draw the attention of their pension paying branches to the above \nprovisions and advise them to strictly follow the instructions.  \nPayment of pension to Defence pensioners \n (a) Delay in submission of  pension payment scrolls  \n21. The procedure for transmission of pension payment scrolls by paying branches, link \nbranches and reimbursing branches is stipulated in of the booklet \u201cDefence Pension Payment Instructions \u201d.  The detailed instructions are available at \nhttp://cgda.nic.in/pdf/Defence%20Pension%20Payment%20Instructions%202013.pdf\n \nThe entire procedure detailed therein need s to be completed as per the timeframe fixed \nso that the payment scrolls are received at the Office of the PCDA (Pension), Allahabad latest by 15th of the following month (except for the month of March scrolls, which should invariably reach latest by 3rd w eek of every year). The Pension Paying \nBranches/ Link Branches / Reimbursing Branches are advised to put in place a more \nefficient system to ensure the following:  \n\u2022 Pension Paying Branches to submit pension payment scrolls to Link Branches \nwithin the stipulated time (by 10th of the following month). No bunching of scrolls is done.  \n\u2022 Link Branches to forward the original copy of the scroll along with summary sheet and summary documents to reimbursing banks (RBI/ SBI etc. as the case may \nbe) by 11th of each month.  8 \n \u2022 Reimbursing banks should forward the original copy of the scrolls directly to CDA \n(Pension), Allahabad after reimbursing pension paying bank, by debit to Government Account so as to reach PCDA (Pension) by 15th of the following \nmonth except for the March scrolls.  \n(b) Fake and fraudulent payments  \n22. The Office of the PCDA (Pension) has also noticed that in some cases of payment \nof gratuity and commutation amount were made to imposters on fake and fraudulent \nPPOs by the pension paying branches without observing prescribed checks.  Defence \npension paying branches are therefore requested to strictly follow the procedure laid \ndown in \u201cDefence Pension Payment Instructions \u201d by the PCDA (Pension) for \ndisbursement of pension to Defence pensioners to avoid fraudulent payments against \nfake pension payment orders.  \n \n(c) First payment of pension  \n23. It has also been observed that in the cases of first payment of pension, either PPO \nnumbers were not mentioned on the scrolls or incorrect PPO numbers were mentioned making it difficult to verify the correctness of the payment. Further, these payments \nwere being shown in the main pension payment scrolls along with the regular monthly payments of Defence Pensioners. The Pension Paying Branches/ Link Branches / Reimbursing Branches are advised to put in place a more efficient system to ensure the \nfollowing:  \n(a) In the cases of first payments of pension, pension paying branches should \nprepare scrolls carefully indicating correct PPO number, amount of gratuity and \ncommutation agai nst the name of each pensioner and submit the same \nseparately on a monthly basis in addition to the regular monthly payment cases \nwhich will continue to be prepared separately along with separate summary sheet.  \n(b) Pension paying branches should prepare separate summary sheets for \nregular monthly pension payment cases as well as first pension payment case.  \n(d) Single Window System  \n24. It has been decided in consultation with the Office of Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (Pension) to introduce Singl e Window System for reimbursement of Defence \nPension with effect from April 1, 2007. Hence, the Reimbursing Banks i.e. RBI (PADs), SBI and its associate banks will cease to reimburse Defence pension payments made by the banks with effect from April 1, 2007. Pension payments transactions may be reported through Link Cell in Nagpur to Central Accounts Section, Reserve Bank of India, Nagpur for fund settlement as in the case of Central Civil Pension. The agency banks are required to send the Payment scrolls to the office of the PCDA (P), Draupadi \nGhat, Allahabad.  \n25. All the past transactions remaining outstanding prior to April 1, 2007 for which Pension Payment Scrolls Advices are wanting shall be resolved through Reimbursing \nBranches of RBI/SBI and its Associates.  \nPayment of Pension to Railway Pensioners \n(a) Fake and fraudulent payments  9 26. The Ministry of Railways has detected cases of fraud wherein pension/ pension\narrears have been disbursed to unauthorised persons by some agency banks againstfake Pension Payment Orders (PPOs). Such fraudulent payments are made by pensionpaying branches without observing prescribed checks such as releasing payments byrelying upon calculation sheet not signed by authorised signatory, as alsononcompliance with laid down procedures, especially regarding receipt of PPOs bybanks. Railway pension paying branches are therefore requested to strictly follow theprocedure laid down in \u201cScheme for Payment of Railway Pension through Public SectorBanks\u201d by the Ministry of Railways (Railway Board) for disbursement of pension to\nRailway pensioners to avoid fraudulent payments against fake pension payment orders.\n(b) Issue of Due and Drawn statement\n27. All agency banks may issue suitable instructions to their pension paying branches\nfor issuance of \u2018Due and Drawn\u2019 statement in the prescribed form to Railway\npensioners, whenever there is a change/revision in their pension, so as to avoid\ninconvenience to the pensioners.\n(c) Single Window System\n28. The Single Window System (SWS) has been introduced in case of the\nreimbursement of Railway Pension payments by almost all agency banks . Railway\npension payments made by these banks will be reimbursed by RBI, Central Accounts\nSection, Nagpur.\nPayment of Pension to Telecom Pensioners \n(a) Single Window System\n29. Single Window System (SWS) was introduced in the case of reimbursement of\nTelecom Pension payments with State Bank of India, its Associates and NationalisedBanks  with effect from October 1, 2012. The revised scheme is available at  the\nfollowing link: http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/28 -9-12_1.pdf\n Telecom pension\npayments made by these banks will be reimbursed by RBI, Central Accounts Section,\nNagpur.\nCustomer Service  \n30.All agency bank s may issue instructions to their  dealing branches to adhere to the  \nrecommendations  of the Prabhak ar Rao Committee relating to pension payments and  \naccordingly als o instruct their  internal auditor s/inspectors to bestow due attention to  \nadherence to the items of wor k by the branches listed with respect to the checklist  \n(provided in Annex 1) and comment on the quality  of customer service in their r eports  \nwhich may be made available to Reserve Bank\u2019s ins pecting officers, as and when they  \nvisit the branc hes.\n31.Grievances of pensioners are not being addres sed properly at the branch lev el \nespecially after the setting up of Centralised Pension Processing Centres (CPPCs). To  \nprovide hassle free service to the pensioners, there should be a forum for regular  \ninteraction and settlement of grievances. Accordingly, agency banks should appoint  \none/two nodal officers at each Region/Zone for monitoring the resolution of grievances  \nof pensioners  on regular basis  and the GM/CGM  concerned should review the pos ition \nat monthly intervals.\n32.At locations outside the CPPCs , there should be designated nodal offic ers for  \npension related complaints who s hould be easily accessible to pensioners and who  \nshould hold regular meetings at different loc ations in their jurisdiction on the lines of 10 \n Pension Adalat. Each bank should establish toll free dedicated pension line manned by \ntrained persons with access to the database to answer queries, note down and redress \ncomplaints.  \n33. Following several complaints from  pensioners alleging inordinate delay in disbursing \nrevised pension and arrears, agency banks were advised as under:  \n(a) Pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in \ncrediting pension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum  \nfor the delay after the due date and the compensation shall be credited to the \npensioner's account automatically without any claim from the pensioner on the \nsame day when the bank affords credit for revised pension/ pension arrears, in \nrespect of all delayed pension payments made since October 1, 2008.  \n(b) Pension paying banks have been requested to put in place a mechanism \nto obtain immediately the copies of pension orders from the pension paying \nauthorities directly and make payments w ithout waiting for receipt of instructions \nfrom the Reserve Bank so that pensioners should get benefits announced by the \nGovernments in the succeeding month's pension payment itself.  \n(c) System of attending to customer service including pension payments ma y \nbe reviewed at periodical intervals.  \n(d) The branch should continue to be a point of referral for the pensioner lest \nhe/she feel disenfranchised.  \n(e) All branches having pension accounts should guide and assist the \npensioners in all their dealings with t he bank.  \n(f) Suitable arrangements should be made to place the arithmetic and other \ndetails about pension calculations on the web, to be made available to the \npensioners through the net or at the branches at periodic interval as may be \nnecessary and suffic ient advertisement is made about such arrangements.  \n(g) All claims for agency commission in respect of pension payments must be \naccompanied by a certificate from ED/CGM in charge of government business \nthat there are no pension arrears to be credited/ delays in crediting regular \npension/arrears thereof.  \nTraining \n34. In order to create better awareness among staff about pension payment schemes/ \nrules, banks may include this as an integral part of the training programmes conducted \nby their training establishments.  \n35.

As you are aware, the agency commission on government receipts is paid by \nReserve Bank per transaction basis. In this connection, with reference to the \nimplementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime, it is advised that a single \nCommon Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to \ngeneration of a Challan Identification Number (CIN), under GST payment process, may \nbe treated as a single transaction, even if multiple major head/sub major head/minor head \nof accounts are credited. This means  that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid \nthrough a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records \nclubbed under a single challan i.e. , CPIN ha ve to be treated as a single transaction for \nthe purpose of claiming agency commission. This will come into effect from July 1, 2017.  \n3. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that a \nsingle challan (electronic or physical)  should  be treated as single transaction only and not  \nmultiple transactions , even if the challan contains  multiple major head/ sub major  \nhead/minor head of accounts  that will get credited. We reiterate that r ecords clubbed \nunder  a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single transaction \nfor the purpose of claiming agency commission.  \n \n\u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930\ufffd \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \u0932\u0947\u0916\u093e \ufffd\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f ,  \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 \u0938\ufffd\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0932 \u0930\u0947\u0932\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0936\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0947 , \u092d\u093e\u092f\u0916\u0932\u093e , \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 400 008 \nDepartment of Government & Bank Accounts, Central Office, Opp. Mumbai Central Railway Station, 4th Floor, Byculla, Mumbai 400 008  \nTelephone: (022) 2308 4121, Fax No. (022) 2300 0370/2301 6072/2301 0095, e -mail: pcgmdgbaco@rbi.org.in \n \n\ufffd\u0939\u0928\u094d\u0926\ufffd \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948 , \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0907\u090f \u0964  \n-2- \n \nYours faithfully  \n  \n(Partha Choudhuri)  \nGeneral Manager  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n         \n \n \n        \n \n \n   \n \n \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT3274316CCA0FC1643219C6B0517FC2711F7.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 22, 2017", "info": " \n____________________________________________________________________________________  \n\u092c\ufffd\ufffd\u0915\u0902\u0917\ufffd\u0935\ufffd\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928\ufffd\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 ,\u0915\ufffd\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f , 12\u0935\u0940\u0902\u0914\u0930 13\u0935\u0940\u0902\u092e\u0902\u093f\u095b\u0932 , \u0915\ufffd\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f\u092d\u0935\u0928 , \u0936\u0939\ufffd\u0926\u092d\u0917\u0924\ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939\u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d , \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 400001 \n\u091f\u0947\u0932\ufffd\u092b\u094b\u0928 /Tel No: 22661602, 22601000 \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938/ Fax No: 022- 2270 5670, 2260 5671, 5691 2270, 2260 5692  \nDepartment of Banking Regulation,Central Office, 12th &  13th Floor, Central Office Bhavan, ShahidBhagat Singh Marg, Mumbai -  400001  \nTel No: 22661602, 22601000  Fax No: 022- 2270 5670, 2260 5671, 5691 2270, 2260 5692  \n \n \n \nRBI/2016- 17/326 \nDBR.No.Leg.BC. 76/09.07.005/2016- 17               June 22 , 2017 \n \n All Scheduled Commercial Banks  (including RRBs)  \nAll Small Finance Banks and Payment s Banks  \n \nDear Sir/  Madam,  \n \n \nRecording of Details of Transactions in Passbook/ Statement of Account  \n Please refer to instructions contained in Paragraphs 6 and 7 of our \ncircular \nDBOD.No.Leg.BC.74/09.07.005/2003- 04 dated April 10, 2004  on \"Committee on \nProcedures and Performance Audit on Public Services -  Report No. 3 -  Banking \nOperations : Deposit Accounts and Other Facilities Relating to Individuals (Non-\nBusiness)\" advising banks to avoid i nscrutable entries in passbooks / statements of \naccount and ensure that brief, intelligible particulars are invariably entered in passbooks / statements of account with a view to avoiding inconvenience to \ndepositors.  \n 2.

Recommendations for NBFCs wit h asset size \nbelow ` 500 crore  17 \nAnnex - I \n Template for reporting Cyber Incidents   \n  \n   \nPage 3 of 15 \n Introduction:  \nThe NBFC (Non-Banking Finance Company) sector has grown in size and complexity over the years. As the \nNBFC industry matures and achieves scale, its Information Technology /Information Security (IT/IS) \nframework, Business continuity planning (BCP), Disaster Recovery (DR) Management, IT audit, etc. must be \nbenchmarked to best practices.  \n \n2.   Accordingly, directions on IT Framework for the NBFC sector that are expected to enhance safety, \nsecurity, efficiency in processes leading to benefits for NBFCs and their customers are enclosed. NBFCs \nmay have already implemented or may be implementing some of the requirements indicated in the c ircular. \nNBFCs are therefore required to conduct a formal gap analysis between their current status and stipulations as laid out in the circular and put in place a time-bound action plan to address the gap and comply with the \nguidelines.  \n \n3.   The focus of the proposed IT framework is on IT Governance, IT Policy, Information & Cyber Security, IT Operations, IS Audit, Business Continuity Planning and IT Services Outsourcing. The \ndirections are categorized into two parts, those which are applicable to all NB FCs with asset size above `  \n500 crore (Considered Systemically Important) are provided in Section-A.  Directions for NBFCs with asset \nsize below `  500 crore are provided in Section-B.   \n \n4.   NBFCs may place these directions before their Board, together with a gap-analysis vis -a-vis the Master \nDirection and the proposed action by September 30, 2017. \n \n5.   NBFCs - Systemically Important shall comply with the Master Directions  by June 30, 2018 and other \nNBFCs ( asset size below `  500 crore) shall comply by Septe mber 30, 2018.  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \nPage 4 of 15 \n Section-A  \nIT GOVERNANCE  \n \n1. IT Governance \nIT Governance is an integral part of corporate governance. It involves leadership support, organizational \nstructure and processes to ensure that the NBFC\u2019s IT  sustains and extends business strategies and \nobjectives. Effective IT Governance is the responsibility of the Board of Directors and Executive \nManagement. \n Well-defined roles and responsibilities of Board and Senior Management are critical, while \nimplementing IT Governance. Clearly -defined roles enable effective project control. People, \nwhen they are aware of others' expectations from them, are able to complete work on time,  \nwithin budget and to the expected level of quality. IT Governance Stakeholders include: Board of Directors, \nIT Strategy Committees, CEOs,  Business Executives, Chief Information Officers ( CIOs ), Chief Technology \nOfficers (CTOs), IT Steering Committees (operating at an executive level and focusing on priority  setting, \nresource allocation and project tracking), Chief Risk  Officer  and Risk Committees . \n The basic principles of value delivery, IT Risk Management, IT resource management and performance \nmanagement must form the basis of governance framework. IT Governance has a continuous life -cycle. It's \na process in which IT strategy drives the processes, using resources necessary to execute responsibilities. \nGiven the criticality of the IT, NBFCs may follow relevant aspects of such prudential governance standards \nthat have found acceptability in the finance industry.  \n 1.1     IT Strategy Committee:  NBFCs  are required to form an IT Strategy Committee. The chairman of the \ncommittee shall be an independent director and CIO  & CTO  should be a part of the committee. The IT \nStrategy Committee should meet at an appropriate frequency but not more than six months should elapse between two meetings. The Committee shall work in partnership with other Board committees and Senior \nManagement to provide input to them. It will also carry out review and amend the IT strategies in line with the corporate strategies, Board Policy reviews , cyber  security arrangements and any other matter related to \nIT Governance. Its deliberations may be placed before the Board.   \n1.2 Roles and Responsibilities of IT Strategy Committee:  Some of the roles and responsibilities include:  \n\u2022 Approving IT strategy and policy documents and ensuring that the management has put an effective \nstrategic planning process in place;  \n\u2022 Ascertaining that management has implemented processes and practices that ensure that the IT deliver s value to the business ;  \n   \nPage 5 of 15 \n \u2022 Ensuring IT investments represent a balance of risks and benefits and that budgets are acceptable;  \n\u2022 Monitoring the method that management uses to determine the IT resources needed to achieve \nstrategic goals and provide high-level di rection for sourcing and use of IT resources ; \n\u2022 Ensuring proper balance of IT investments for sustaining NBFC\u2019s growth and becoming aware about \nexposure towards IT risks and controls.  \n \nIT POLICY  \n \n2.  NBFCs may formulate a Board approved IT policy, in line w ith the objectives of their organisation \ncomprising the following:  \na) An IT organizational structure commensurate with the size, scale and nature of business activities \ncarried out by the NBFC ;  \nb) NBFCs may designate a senior executive as the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or in -Charge of IT \noperations whose responsibility is to ensure implementation of IT Policy to the operational level \ninvolving IT strategy, value delivery, risk management and IT resource management .  \nc) To ensure technical competence at senior/m iddle level management of NBFC , periodic assessment \nof the IT training requirements should be formulated to ensure that sufficient, competent and capable \nhuman resources are available.  \nd) The NBFCs which are currently not using IPv6 platform should migrate to the same as per National Telecom Policy issued by the Government of India in 2012. (As per \nCircular DNBS(Inf.).CC.No \n309/24.01.022/2012-13 November 08, 2012 ) \n \nINFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY  \n \n3.  Information Security   \nInformation is an asset to all NBFCs and Information Security (IS) refers to the protection of these assets in order to achieve organizational goals. The purpose of IS is to control access to sensitive informati on,  \nensuring  use  only  by  legitimate  users  so  that  data  cannot  be  read  or compromised without proper authorization. NBFCs must have a board approved IS Policy with the following basic tenets:  \na) Confidentiality \u2013 Ensuring access to sensitive data to authorized users only . \nb) Integrity \u2013  Ensuring  accuracy  and  reliability  of  information by ensuring that there is  no  \nmodification without authorization.  \nc) Availability \u2013 Ensuring that uninterrupted data is available to users when it is needed.  \nd) Authenticity \u2013 For IS it is necessary to ensure that the data, transactions, communications or \ndocuments (electronic or physical) are genuine.  \n  \n   \nPage 6 of 15 \n 3.1  The IS Policy must provide for a IS framework with the following basic tenets : \na) Identification and Classification of Information Assets. NBFCs shall maintain detailed inventory \nof Information Asset with distinct and clear identification of the asset.  \nb) Segregation of functions: There should be segregation of the duties of the Security Officer/Group  \n(both physical securi ty as well as cyber security)  dealing exclusively with information systems \nsecurity and the Information Technology division which actually implements the computer systems. \nThe information security function should be adequately resourced in terms of the num ber of staff, \nlevel of skill and tools or techniques like risk assessment, security architecture, vulnerability \nassessment, forensic assessment, etc. Further, there should be a clear segregation of responsibilities relating to system administration, database administration and transaction \nprocessing.  \nc) Role based Access Control \u2013 Access to information should be based on well -defined user roles \n(system administrator, user manager, application owner etc.), NBFCs shall avoid dependence on \none or few persons for  a particular job. There should be clear delegation of authority for right to \nupgrade/change user profiles and permissions and also key business parameters (eg. interest rates) \nwhich should be documented.  \nd) Personnel Security - A few authorized application owners/users may have intimate knowledge of \nfinancial institution processes and they pose potential threat to systems and data. NBFC should have \na process of appropriate check and balance in this regard. Personnel with privileged access like \nsystem adminis trator, cyber security personnel, etc should be subject to rigorous background check \nand screening.  \ne) Physical Security - The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information can be impaired \nthrough physical access and damage or destruction to physical components. NBFCs need to create \na secured environment for physical security of IS Assets such as secure location of critical data, \nrestricted access to sensitive areas like data center etc.    \nf) Maker -checker is one of the important principles of authorization in the information systems of \nfinancial entities. For each transaction, there must be at least two individuals necessary for its \ncompletion as this will reduce the risk of error and will ensure reliability of information. \ng) Incident Management - The IS Policy should define what constitutes an incident. NBFCs shall \ndevelop and implement processes for preventing, detecting, analysing and responding to information security incidents.  \nh) Trails- NBFCs shall ensure that audit trails exist for IT assets satisfying its business requirements \nincluding regulatory and legal requirements, facilitating audit, serving as forensic evidence when \nrequired and assisting in dispute resolution. If an employee, for instance, attempts to access an \nunauthorized section, th is improper activity should be recorded in the audit trail.   \n   \nPage 7 of 15 \n i) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) - NBFCs may increase the usage of PKI to ensure confidentiality of \ndata, access control, data integrity, authentication and nonrepudiation.  \n \n3.2  Cyber Security  \nNeed for a Board approved Cyber -security Policy  \nNBFCs should put in place a cyber -security policy elucidating the strategy containing an appropriate \napproach to combat cyber threats given the level of complexity of business and acceptable levels of risk, \nduly approved by their Board. NBFCs should review the organisational arrangements so that the security \nconcerns are appreciated, receive adequate attention and get escalated to appropriate levels in the \nhierarchy to enable quick action.  \n \n3.3  Vulnerability Man agement  \nA vulnerability can be defined as an inherent configuration flaw in an organization\u2019s information technology \nbase, whether hardware or software, which can be exploited by a third party to gather sensitive information regarding the organization. Vul nerability management is an ongoing process to determine the process of \neliminating or mitigating vulnerabilities based upon the risk and cost associated with the vulnerabilities. \nNBFCs may devise a strategy for managing and eliminating vulnerabilities and such strategy may clearly be \ncommunicated in the Cyber Security policy. \n \n \n3.4   Cyber security preparedness indicators \nThe adequacy of and adherence to cyber resilience framework should be assessed and measured through \ndevelopment of indicators to assess the level of risk/preparedness. These indicators should be used for \ncomprehensive testing through independent compliance checks and audits carried out by qualified and \ncompetent professionals. The awareness among the stakeholders including employees may al so form a part \nof this assessment. \n \n3.5   Cyber Crisis Management Plan \nA Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP) should be immediately evolved and should be a part of the \noverall Board approved strategy. CCMP should address the following four aspects: (i) Detection (ii) \nResponse (iii) Recovery and (iv) Containment. NBFCs need to take effective measures to prevent cyber -\nattacks and to promptly detect any cyber -intrusions so as to respond / recover / contain the fall out. NBFCs \nare expected to be well prepared to face emerging cyber -threats such as \u2018zero-day\u2019 attacks, remote access \nthreats, and targeted attacks. Among other things, NBFCs should take necessary preventive and corrective \nmeasures in addressing various types of cyber threats including, but not limited to, denial of service, \ndistributed denial of services (DDoS), ransom -ware / crypto ware, destructive malware, business email  \n   \nPage 8 of 15 \n frauds including spam, email phishing, spear phishing, whaling, vishing frauds, drive-by downloads, browser \ngateway fraud, ghost a dministrator exploits, identity frauds, memory update frauds, password related frauds, \netc. \n \n3.6 Sharing of information on cyber -security incidents with RBI  \nNBFCs are required to report all types of unusual security incidents as specified in point No. 2 of Annex I \nwhich deals with Basic Information including Cyber Security Incidents as specified in CSIR Form of Annex I \n(both the successful as well as the attempted incidents which did not fructify) to the DNBS Central Office, \nMumbai. The other particulars of the reporting have been provided in template as per Annex I.  \n \n3.7   Cyber -security awareness among stakeholders / Top Management / Board \nIt should be realized that managing cyber risk requires the commitment of the entire organization to create a \ncyber -safe environment. This will require a high level of awareness among staff at all levels. Top \nManagement and Board should also have a fair degree of awareness of the fine nuances of the threats and \nappropriate familiarisation may be organized. NBFCs should proactively promote, among their customers, \nvendors, service providers and other relevant stakeholders an understanding of their cyber resilience \nobjectives, and require and ensure appropriate action to support their synchronised implementation and \ntesting.  \n \n3.8   Digital Signatures  \nA Digital Signature Certificate authenticates entity\u2019s identity electronically. It also provides a high level of \nsecurity for online transactions by ensuring absolute privacy of the information exchanged using a Digital \nSignatur e Certificate. NBFCs may consider use of Digital signatures to protect the authenticity and integrity \nof important electronic documents and also for high value fund transfer.  \n \n3.9   IT Risk Assessment  \nNBFCs should undertake a comprehensive risk assessment of their IT systems at least on a yearly basis. \nThe assessment should make an analysis on the threats and vulnerabilities to the information technology assets of the NBFC and its existing security controls and processes. The outcome of the exercise should be \nto find out the risks present and to determine the appropriate level of controls necessary for appropriate mitigation of risks. The risk assessment should be brought to the notice of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), CIO \nand the Board of the NBFC and should serve as an input for Information Security auditors.  \n  \n3.10   Mobile Financial Services NBFCs that are already using or intending to use Mobile Financial Services should develop a mechanism for \nsafeguarding information assets that are used by mobile appli cations to provide services to customers. The  \n   \nPage 9 of 15 \n technology used for mobile services should ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and must provide for \nend-to end encryption. \n \n3.11   Social Media Risks \nNBFCs using Social Media to market their products should be well equipped in handling social media risks \nand threats. As Social Media is vulnerable to account takeovers and malware distribution, proper controls, \nsuch as encryption and secure connections, should be prevalent to mitigate such risks.  \n \n3.12    Training  \nHuman link is the weakest link in the information security chain. Hence, there is a vital need for an initial and \nongoing training and information security awareness programme. The programme may be periodically \nupdated keeping in view changes  in information technology system, threats/vulnerabilities and/or the \ninformation security framework. There needs to be a mechanism to track the effectiveness of training \nprogrammes through an assessment / testing process. At any point of time, NBFCs need to maintain an \nupdated status on user training and awareness relating to information security.  \n \nIT OPERATIONS   \n \n4   IT Operations should support processing and storage of information, such that the required information is \navailable in a timely, reliable, secure and resilient manner. The Board or Senior Management should take into consideration the risk associated with existing and planned IT operations and the risk tolerance and then establish and monitor policies for risk management. \n \n4.1   Acquisition and Development of Information Systems (New Application Software) and Change \nManagement  \nIt has been the experience while implementing IT projects that many systems fail because of poor system \ndesign and implementation, as well as inadequate testing. NBFCs should identify system deficiencies and \ndefects at the system design, development and testing phases.  \nNBFCs should establish a steering committee, consisting of business owners, the development team and \nother stakeholders to provide oversight and monitoring of the progress of the project, including deliverables \nto be realized at each phase of the project and milestones to be reached according to the project timetable.  \n \n4.2   NBFCs are required to realign their IT systems on a regular basis in line with the changing needs of  its \ncustomers and business. The changes need to be done in such a way that adverse incidents and disruption  \n   \nPage 10 of 15 \n to services are minimized  while maximizing  value for the customers. For this purpose, NBFCs should \ndevelop, with the approval of their Board, a Change Management Policy that encompasses the following:  \na) prioritizing and responding to change proposals from business,  \nb) cost benefit analysis of the changes proposed,  \nc) assessing risks associated with the changes proposed,  \nd) change implementation, monitoring and reporting. \nIt should be the responsibility of the senior management to ensure that the Change Management policy is \nbeing followed on an ongoing basis.  \n \n4.3   IT Enabled Management Information System  \nThe IT function of an NBFC should support a robust and comprehensive Management Information System \n(MIS) in respect of various business functions as per the needs of the business. A good MIS should take care of information needs at all levels in the business including top management.  \n \n4.4  NBFCs may put in place MIS that assist the Top Management as well as the business heads in decision \nmaking and also to maintain an oversight over operations of various business verticals. With robust IT \nsystems in place, NBFCs may have the following as part of an effective system generated MIS  (indicative \nlist) \na) A dashboard for the Top Management summarising financial position vis -\u00e0-vis targets. It may include \ninformation on trend on returns on assets across categories, major growth business segments, \nmovemen t of net-worth etc. \nb) System enabled identification and classification of Special Mention Accounts and NPA as well as \ngeneration of MIS reports in this regard. \nc) The MIS should facilitate pricing of products, especially large ticket loans.  \nd) The MIS should capture regulatory requirements and their compliance.  \ne) Financial Reports including operating and non-operating revenues and expenses, cost benefit \nanalysis of segments/verticals, cost of funds, etc. (also regulatory compliance at transaction level)  \nf) Reports rel ating to treasury operations .  \ng) Fraud analysis - Suspicious transaction analysis, embezzlement, theft or suspected money -\nlaundering, misappropriation of assets, manipulation of financial records etc. The regulatory requirement of reporting fraud to RBI shoul d be system driven. \nh) Capacity and performance analysis of IT security systems  \ni) Incident reporting, their impact and steps taken for non -recurrence of such events in the future.  \n \n       4.5   MIS for Supervisory requirements - The MIS that help management i n taking strategic decisions \nshall also assist in generating the required information/returns for the supervisor.  The present structure of  \n   \nPage 11 of 15 \n reporting system (to the supervisor) needs to be kept in view while designing the MIS. All \nregulatory/supervisory returns should be system driven; there should be seamless integration between \nMIS system of the NBFC and reporting under COSMOS. Further , it is essential that \u201c\u201dRead Only \u201d access  \nbe provided to RBI Inspectors.  \n \nIS AUDIT  \n \n5.  Policy for Information System Audit (IS Audit) .  \n \nThe objective of the IS Audit is to provide an insight on the effectiveness of controls that are in place to \nensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of the organization\u2019s IT infrastructure. IS Audit shall identify \nrisks and methods to mitigate risk arising out of IT infrastructure such as server architecture, local and wide \narea networks, physical and information security, telecommunications etc.  \n \n5.1   IS Audit should form an integral part of Internal Audit system of the NBFC.  While designing the IS \nframework, NBFCs shall refer to guidance issued by Professional bodies like ISACA, IIA, ICAI in this regard. \nICAI has published \u201cStandard on Internal Audit (SIA) 14: Internal Audit in an Information Technology \nEnvironment\u201d on the subject.  NBFCs shall adopt an IS Audit framework duly approved by their Board. \nFurther, NBFCs shall have adequately skilled personnel in Audit Committee who can understand the results of the IS Audit. \n \n5.2 Coverage: IS Audit should cover effectiveness of  policy  and  oversight  of  IT systems,  evaluating  adequacy  of  processes  and  internal controls, recommend corrective action to address deficiencies and \nfollow -up. IS Audit should also evaluate the effectiveness of business continuity planning, disaster recovery \nset up and ensure that BCP is effectively implemented in the organization.  During the process of IS Audit, \ndue importance shall be given to compliance of all the applicable legal and statutory requirements .   \n \n5.3 Personnel \u2013 IS Audit may be conducted by an internal team of the NBFC. In case of inadequate internal \nskills, NBFCs may appoint an outside agency having enough expertise in area of IT/IS audit for the purpose. \nThere should be a  right mix of skills and understanding  of  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  so  as  to  \nassess  the efficacy of the framework vis -\u00e0-vis these standards. IS Auditors should act independently of \nNBFCs\u2019 Management both in attitude and appearance. In case of engagement of external professional service providers , independence and accountability issues may be properly addressed.     \n \n5.4 Periodicity  - The periodicity of IS audit should ideally be based on the size and operations of the NBFC \nbut may be conducted at least once in a year . IS Audit should be undertaken preferably prior to the statutory  \n   \nPage 12 of 15 \n audit so that IS audit reports are available to the statutory auditors well in time for examination and for \nincorporating comments, if any, in the audit reports. \n 5.5 Reporting \u2013   The framework should clearly prescribe the reporting framework, whether to the Board or \na Committee of the Board viz. Audit Committee of the Board (ACB)  \n 5.6 Compliance \u2013 NBFCs\u2019 management is responsible for deciding the appropriate action to be taken in \nresponse to reported observations and recommendations during IS Audit. Responsibilities for \ncompliance/sustenance of compliance, reporting lines, timelines for submission of compliance, authority for accepting compliance should be clearly delineated in the framework.  The framework may provide for an \naudit-mode access for auditors/ inspecting/ regulatory authorities.  \n \n5.7 Computer -Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs): NBFCs shall adopt a proper mix of manual \ntechniques and CAATs for conducting IS Audit. CAATs may be used in critical areas (such as detection of revenue leakage, treasury functions, assessing impact of control weaknesses, monitoring customer \ntransactions under AML requirements and generally in areas where a large volume of transactions are \nreported)  particularly  for  critical functions or processes having financial/regulatory/legal implications.  \n \nBusiness Continuity Planning \n \n6.   Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and Disaster Recovery  \nBCP forms a significant part of an organisation's overall Business Continuity Management plan, whi ch \nincludes policies, standards and procedures to ensure continuity, resumption and recovery of critical \nbusiness processes. BCP shall be designed to minimise the operational, financial, legal, reputational and \nother material consequences arising from a di saster. NBFC should adopt a Board approved BCP Policy. \nThe functioning of BCP shall be monitored by the Board by way of periodic reports. The CIO shall be \nresponsible for formulation, review and monitoring of BCP to ensure continued effectiveness. The BCP may \nhave the following salient features:   \n \n6.1 Business Impact Analysis-   NBFCs shall first identify critical business verticals, locations and shared \nresources to come up with the detailed Business Impact Analysis. The process will envisage the impact of \nany unforeseen natural or man-made disasters on the NBFC\u2019s business. The entity shall clearly list the \nbusiness impact areas in order of priority. \n \n6.2 Recovery strategy/ Contingency Plan-  NBFCs shall try to fully understand the vulnerabilities \nassociated with interrelationships between various systems, departments and business processes. The BCP  \n   \nPage 13 of 15 \n should come up with the probabilities of various failure scenarios. Evaluation of various options should be \ndone for recovery and the most cost-effective, practi cal strategy should be selected to minimize losses in \ncase of a disaster.  \n \n6.3 NBFCs shall consider the need to put in place necessary backup sites for their critical business systems \nand Data centers.   \n \n6.4 NBFCs shall test the BCP either annually or when significant IT or business changes take place to \ndetermine if the entity could be recovered to an acceptable level of business within the timeframe stated in \nthe contingency plan. The test should be based on \u2018worst case scenarios\u2019. The results along with the gap \nanalysis may be placed before the CIO and the Board.  The GAP Analysis along with Board\u2019s insight should \nform the basis for construction of the updated BCP.   \n \nIT SERVICES OUTSOURCING  \n  \n7. Policy for IT Services Outsourcing \nOutsourcing of IT related business process can provide an NBFC the opportunity to realise valuable \nstrategic and economic benefits. However, prior to commencement of any outsourcing arrangement, careful \nconsideration of risks, threats of contractual arrangements and regulatory compliance obligations must take \nplace.  Companies usually outsource their IT related business process to a third party vendor because of \nhigher efficiency, inadequate resources and lack of specialized knowledge. The NBFC\u2019s decision to \noutsource IT Services should fit into the institution\u2019s overall strategic plan and corporate objectives.  \n \n7.1   The terms and conditions governing the contract between the NBFC and the Outsourcing service \nprovider should be carefully defined in written agreements and vetted by NBFC\u2019s legal counsel on their legal \neffect and enforceability. The contractual agreement may have the following provisions.  \na) Monitoring and Oversight : Provide for continuous monitoring and assessment by the NBFC of the \nservice provider so that any neces sary corrective measure can be taken immediately . Outsourcing \nservice provider should have adequate systems and procedures in place to ensure protection of data/application outsourced. \nb) Access to books and records / Audit and Inspection: This would include :  \n \ni. Ensure that the NBFC has the ability to access all books, records and information relevant to the outsourced activity available with the service provider. For technology outsourcing, requisite \naudit trails and logs for administrative activities should be retained and accessible to the NBFC \nbased on approved requests .  \n   \nPage 14 of 15 \n ii. Provide the NBFC with the right to conduct audits on the service provider whether by its internal \nor external auditors, or by external specialists appointed to act on its behalf and to obtai n copies \nof any audit or review reports and findings made on the service provider in conjunction with the \nservices performed for the NBFC . \niii. The contractual agreement may i nclude clauses to allow the Reserve Bank of India or persons \nauthorized by it to access  the NBFC \u2019s documents, records of transactions, and other \nnecessary information given to, stored or processed by the service provider within a reasonable \ntime. This includes  information maintained in paper and electronic formats . \n \n7.2   The Board and seni or management are ultimately responsible for \u2018outsourcing operations\u2019 and for \nmanaging risks inherent in such outsourcing relationships. The Board of Directors of NBFCs is responsible \nfor effective due diligence, oversight and management of outsourcing and accountability for all outsourcing \ndecisions. The Board and IT Strategy committee have the responsibility to institute an effective governance \nmechanism and risk management process for all IT outsourced operations.  \n \n7.3    The Role of IT Strategy committee in respect of outsourced operations shall include  \na) Instituting an appropriate governance mechanism for outsourced processes, comprising of risk based policies and procedures, to effectively identify, measure, monitor and control risks associated \nwith outsourcing in an end to end manner ; \nb) Defining approval authorities for outsourcing depending on nature of risks and materiality of \noutsourcing;   \nc) Developing sound and responsive outsourcing risk management policies and procedures \ncommensurate with the nature, scope, and complexity of outsourcing arrangements ;  \nd) Undertaking a periodic review of outsourcing strategies and all existing material outsourcing arrangements ; \ne) Evaluating the risks and materiality of all prospective outsourcing based on the framework devel oped \nby the Board;  \nf) Periodically reviewing the effectiveness of policies and procedures ;  \ng) Communicating significant risks in outsourcing to the NBFC\u2019s Board on a periodic basis ; \nh) Ensuring an independent review and audit in accordance with approved policies and procedures ;  \ni) Ensuring that contingency plans have been developed and tested adequately ; \nj) NBFC should ensure that their business continuity preparedness is not adversely  compromised on \naccount of outsourcing. NBFCs  are expected to adopt sound business continuity management \npractices as issued by RBI and seek proactive assurance that the outsourced service provider \nmaintains readiness and preparedness for business continuity on an ongoing basis . \n  \n   \nPage 15 of 15 \n  \nSection-B  \n \nRecommendations for NBFCs with asset size below ` 500 crore \n \n8.    It is recommended that smaller NBFCs may start with developing basic IT systems m ainly for \nmaintaining the database. NBFCs having asset size below ` 500 crore shall have a Board approved \nInformation Technology policy/Information system policy . This policy may be designed considering the \nundermentioned basic standards and the same shall be put in place by September 30, 2018 . The IT \nsystems shall have:  \nI. Basic security aspects such as physical / logical access controls  and well defined passwor d policy ;  \nII. A well-defined user role;  \nIII. A Maker -checker  concept  to  reduce  the  risk  of  error  and  misuse and to ensure reliability of \ndata/information;   \nIV. Information Security and Cyber Security ; \nV. Requirements as regards Mobile Financial Services, Social Media and Digital Signature Certificates \nas indicated in para 3.18, 3.10 & 3.11 above; \nVI. System  generated  reports  for  Top  Management  summarising  financial position including operating and non-operating revenues and expenses, cost benefit analysis of s egments/verticals, \ncost of funds, etc.;  \nVII. Adequacy  to file regulatory returns to RBI (COSMOS Returns) ; \nVIII. A BCP policy duly approved by the Board ensuring regular oversight of the Board by way of periodic reports (at least once every year) ;  \nIX. Arrangement for backup of data with periodic testing.   \n \n8.1 IT Systems should be progressively scaled up as the size and complexity of NBFC\u2019s operations \nincreases.   \n Annex to Master Direction - Information Technology Framework for the NBFC  Sector   \n \n1 \n  \nAnnex - I \nTemplate for reporting Cyber Incidents  \n1.

These will supersede the \nbranch licensing guidelines in force. Detailed guidelines will be issued by end-April, 2017. \n  \n  3 \n Annex \nOpening of new place of business and transfer of existing places of business \n(Section 23 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949)  \nRevised Guidelines \n1. Scope of Application \nThese guidelines are applicable to all Domestic Scheduled Commercial B anks  (excluding Regional \nRural Banks ), Small Finance Banks , Payment Banks  and Local Area Banks .   \n2. Date of Application \nThese guidelines will come into effect from the date of issue of the Circular. \n3. Definitions \nThe following definitions are to be used for the purpose of this policy framework:  \n3.1 Banking Outlet /Part -time Banking Outlet  \n3.1.1 A \u2018Banking Outlet \u2019 for a Domestic Scheduled Commercial Bank  (DSCB), a Small Finance \nBank  (SFB)  and a Payment Bank  (PB) is a fixed point service delivery unit, manned by either \nbank\u2019s staff or its Business Correspondent where services of acceptance of deposits, encashment \nof cheques/  cash withdrawal or lending of money are provided for a minimum of 4 hours per day \nfor at least five days a week. It carries uniform signage with name of the bank and authorisation \nfrom it, contact details of the controlling authorities and complaint escalation mechanism. The bank \nshould have a regular off-site and on-site monitoring of the \u2018 Banking Outlet\u2019 to ensure proper \nsupervision, \u2018uninterrupted service\u2019 except temporary interruptions due to telecom connectivity , etc. \nand timely addressing of customer grievances. The working hours/days need to be displayed \nprominently.   \n3.1.2 A  banking outlet which does not provide delivery of service for a minimum of 4 hours per day \nand for at least 5 days a week will be considered a \u2018Part -time Banking Outlet\u2019.  \n \n 4 \n  \n3.2 Unbanked Rural Centre \nAn \u2018Unbanked Rural Centre\u2019  (URC) is a rural (T ier 5 and 6) centre that does not have a CBS -\nenabled \u2018 Banking Outlet\u2019 of a Scheduled Commercial Bank , a Small Finance B ank, a Payment \nBank or a Regional Rural Bank nor a branch of Local Area Bank or licensed Co-operative Bank for \ncarrying out customer based banking transactions.  \nN.B.1: Extension Counters, Satellite Offices, Part-shifted Branches , Ultra Small  Branches  and \nSpecialised Branches,  subject to their satisfying the definition given above, shall be treated as \nindependent \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 or \u2018Part-time Banking Outlets\u2019, as the case may be.   \nN.B.2:  ATMs, E - lobbies, Bunch Note Acceptor Machines (BNAM), Cash Deposit Machines \n(CDM), E- Kiosks and Mobile Branches will not be treated as \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019.  Point of Sale \n(PoS) terminals where limited cash withdrawal facility is allowed by banks in terms of extant \ninstructions without having an arrangement with the concerned entities as \u2018busi ness  \ncorrespondents\u2019 will not be considered as \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019.  \n4.  Opening of Banking Outlet s \u2013 General Permission  \n4.1 Domestic scheduled commercial banks (other than RRBs) are permitted to open, unless \notherwise specifically restricted, Banking Outlets in Tier 1 to Tier 6 centres without having the \nneed to take permission from Reserve Bank of India in each case. The policy covers the opening \nof \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 in all Tiers as defined on the basis of population as per Census 2011. The tier -\nwise and po pulation group-wise  classification of centres is provided in  Annex I.  \n4.2 The opening of \u2018 Banking Outlets\u2019 during a financial year will be subject to the conditions given \nbelow: \na) At least 25 percent of the total number of \u2018 Banking Outlets\u2019 opened during a financial year \nshould be opened in unbanked rural centres, as defined in Para 3.2 above.  \nb) A \u2018Part-time Banking Outlet\u2019, opened in any Centre, will be counted and added to the \ndenominator as well as numerator on pro rata basis for computing the requirement as well as the \ncompliance with the norm of opening 25 per cent Banking Outlets in unbanked rural centres. Some \nillustrations on the computation of part-time banking outlet have been given in Annex II.  5 \n c) A \u2018Banking Outlet\u2019/\u2018 Part-time Banking Outlet\u2019 opened in any Tier 3 to Tier 6 centre of North-\nEastern States and Sikkim as well as in any Tier 3 to 6 centre of Left-wing Extremism (LWE) \naffected districts as notified by the Government of India from time to time, will be considered as \nequivalent to opening a \u2018Banking Outlet\u2019/ \u2018Part-time Banking Outlet\u2019, as the case may be, in a URC. \nA list of 106 LWE affected districts in 10 States as notified by the Government as on February 24, \n2016 is being provided in Annex III.  As the overall objective of these gui delines is enabling \nexpansion of banking facilities in these underbanked/underserved centres, each banking outlet \nopened, irrespective of the banked/unbanked status of the Centre, will be reckoned as having \nbeen opened in a URC.  \nd) A full -fledged \u2018brick a nd mortar\u2019 branch opened in a rural (Tier 5 and 6) centre which is already \nbeing served by a fixed point BC outlet by any bank will also be eligible to be treated as equivalent \nto opening a \u2018Banking Outlet\u2019 in a URC. In other words, the first fixed point B C outlet of a bank as \nwell as the first \u2018brick and mortar \u2019 branch of any bank opened in a URC will be reckoned for \ncomputing compliance with the 25 per cent norm. \ne) A \u2018banking outlet\u2019 opened in a rural (Tier 5 and 6) centre which is serv ed by only a banki ng \noutlet of a Payment Bank will also be eligible to be treated as equivalent to opening a \u2018banking \noutlet\u2019 in a URC. In other words, the first \u2018banking outlet\u2019 by a Payment Bank as well as the first \n\u2018banking outlet\u2019  by any other bank opened in a URC will be reckoned for computing compliance \nwith the 25 per cent norm.  \nf) The time given to a bank for opening an outlet in a URC is one year. If a bank fails to adhere to \nthe requirement of opening 25% banking outlets in a year, appropriate penal measures, including restrictions on opening of Tier 1 branches, may be imposed. \n4.3 To encourage the banks to open/frontload more number  of bank ing outlets in unbanked rural \ncentres, they will be allowed to carry forward the benefit of the \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019, if any, opened  in \nexcess of the requirement specified in para 4.2 above, for a period of next 2 years. No extension to  \navail the benefit will be allowed.  \n4.4. To enable banks  to have information for identifying a URC, State Level Banker Committees \n(SLBCs ) shall play a constructive and proactive role. T he SLBCs  shall compile and have an  \nupdated list of all unbanked rural centres in the State which shall be displayed on their website. \nThis list will facilitate banks to choos e/indicate  the place where they wish to open a \u2018banking outlet. \u2019 \nBanks shall inform and coordinate with the SLBC Convenor bank to earmar k the centre identified 6 \n by them. If a bank fails to open the banking outlet in the prescribed period of 1 year as per Par a \n4.2 (f) above, the SLBC convenor bank may indicate the Centre as available for other banks to \nopen a banking outlet. The non-member banks of the SLBC , may also refer to the website and \nkeep the SLBC Convenor banks informed of the centres identified by them.  \n4.5    If a bank proposes to undertake government business at any of the banking outlets/part-time \nbanking ou tlets, it would require prior approval  of the Government authority concerned as also of \nDepartment of Government and Bank Accounts, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office. \n5. Merger/Closure/ Shifting/Conversion of \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 \n5.1 Banks having general permission may shift, merge or close all \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 (except rural \noutlets and sole semi -urban outlets) at their discretion.  \n5.2 Merger , Closure and shifting of any rural \u2018Banking Outlet\u2019 as well as a sole semi urban \u2018Banking \nOutlet\u2019 would require approval of the DCC/DLRC . However, conversion of any rural or sole semi -\nurban banking outlet into a full-fledged brick and mortar branch and vice versa would not require \nsuch approval. While  merging/ closing/shifting/converting a rural or a sole semi urban \u2018Banking \nOutlet\u2019, banks and DCC/DLRC shall ensure that the banking needs of the centre continue to be \nmet.   \n5.3 Banks should also ensure that customers of the Banking Outlet, which is being \nmerged/closed/shifted are informed well in time so as to avoid inconvenience to them. Further, \nbanks should ensure that they continue to fulfill the role entrusted to these \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 under \nthe Government sponsored programmes and Direct Benefit Transfer Schemes. \n5.4 It may further be ensured that \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 are shifted within the s ame or to a lesser \npopulation category, i.e., semi urban \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 to semi urban or rural centres and rural \n\u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 to other rural centres. \n6.  Opening/shifting/merger/closing/conversion of Banking Outlets \u2013  Guidelines for Banks \nwhich do not have General Permission \n6.1 Domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks from whom general permission has been withdrawn, \nshall obtain prior approval of Department of Banking Regulation (DBR), Central Office, RBI for \nopening all their branches. Further, in respect of their fixed point BC outlets, they shall also \napproach Reserve Bank  for permission except for outlets opened in Tier 5 and 6 Centres. Small \nFinance Banks, Payment Banks  as well as Local Area Banks (LABs) shall obtain prior approval of 7 \n DBR, Central Office, RBI for all categories of banking outlets.  These banks shall  submit their  \nAnnual Banking Outlet Expansion Plan (ABO EP) with the consolidated details of proposals for \nopening, closing, shifting, merger and conversion of these banking outlets  as per Proforma given in \nAnnex IV .   \n6.2 It should be ensured that all the proposals conform to the guidelines contained in the above \nparas applicable to banks having general permission. On approval of the consolidated proposal, \nindividual proposals for opening new branches at specific centres, for which prior permission is \nrequired from RBI, must be submitted in the prescribed Form VI  in terms of Rule 12 of the Banking \nRegulation (Companies Rules), 1949, to the DBR, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai for approval. The Proforma is given  at Annex V.  The AB OEP and any other proposals required to \nbe submitted to RBI in this regard should have the approval of the Board of Directors of the bank \nor such other authority to which powers have been delegated by the Board of the bank. Banks \nshall ensure that an authenticated / certified copy of such approval is invariably submitted along \nwith these proposal s. \n6.3  It is recognized that some banks , including Small Finance Banks, not having general \npermission would have taken specific approval of Reserve Bank for their Annual Branch Expansion \nPlan for the current year (2017-18) including approval for opening of 25% branches  in URCs, \nidentified as per the erstwhile definition of a URC. It is clarified that notwithstanding the revised \ndefinition of a URC, as per Para 3.2 above, branches opened at the centres authorized by the RBI \nwill be reckoned for assessing compliance with the 25% norm. \n7.  Grandfathering of MFI Structure of the Small Finance Banks \n7.1 In order to provide an enabling environment to preserve the advantages of the MFI/NBFC \nstructure of Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and with a view to further financial inclusion, SFBs are \nbeing allowed a time of 3 years from the date of commencement of business , to align their banking \nnetwork with the extant guidelines. Till such time, the existing structures may continue and would be treated as \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 though not immediately reckoning for the 25 per cent norm. \n \n7.2 Nevertheless , during this period of 3 years, for all the banking outlets opened or converted \nfrom the existing MFI branches in a year, they will have to open 25% banking outlets in unbanked \nrural centres in the same year. For this purpose, Banking Outlets converted from existing MFI \nbranches means, such of the existing NBFC/MFI branches where it intends to conduct banking 8 \n business of accepting deposits, allowing encashment of cheques/withdrawals besides carrying out \nthe current lending activities.  \n \n7.3  At the end of three years from the date of their commencement of business , all SFBs should \nhave opened in URCs, at least 25 per cent of their total  Banking Outlets failing which penal \nmeasures including restrictions on further expansion by such banks will be considered and \nimposed, as deemed appropriate.  With a view to bring all entities on a level playing field, this \ndispensation is applicable to all the existing banks that were NBFCs/MFI earlier as well as \nNBFC/MFI entities that may apply for bank licenc e in future . \n \n8. Manning of ATMs /E-kiosks/CDMs/BNAMs   \nBanks are allowed to set up onsite/offsite Automated Teller Machines (ATM s) at centres/places \nidentified by them, including SEZs . Banks are permitted to post suitable staff member(s) to provide \nguidance to the customers using the services of these outlets. Such ATMs  shall not be reckoned \nas \u2018banking outlets\u2019 as defined in paragraph 3.1 of the circular. \n9. Mobile Branches \u2013 Extension to All Tiers \nBanks are allowed to open/operate mobile branches in all Centres. These mobile branches  will not \nbe considered as Banking Outlets.   \n10. Setting up of Administrative Offices, Back Offices ( Central Processing Centres/Service \nBranches)  and Call Centres etc. \n10.1  Banks  having general permission can set up Administrative Offices (Head/Regional/Zonal \nOffices etc.), Training Centres, Back Offices  (Central Processing Centres (CPCs)/Service \nBranches) , Treasury Branches  and Call Centres, etc. without prior permission from Reserve Bank \nof India.   \n10.2 The bank s should ensure that back offices  i.e. CPCs/Service Branches which are set up \nexclusively to attend to back office functions such as data processing, verification and processing \nof documents, issuance of cheque books, etc. on requests received from other branches should \nnot have any direct interface with customers  for them to be not considered as banking outlets . \nBanks currently having specific permission to allow customer interface at these back offices \n(service branches and/or CPCs) , have to align wi th the above instructions within one year from the 9 \n date of this circular and report compliance to Department of Banking Regulation, Central Office, \nReserve Bank of India.  \n11. Business Facilitator/ Business Correspondent Model  \nThe instructions on Business Facilitator/Business Correspondent Model as contained in our Master \nCircular DBOD.No.BAPD.BC.7/22.01.001/2014-15 dated July 01, 2014  remain unchanged.   \n12.  Customer Education \nWhile the banks will continue to follow guidelines as indicated in our Master Circular \nDBOD.No.BAPD.BC.7/22.01.001/2014-15 dated July 01, 2014 , they should also ensure to \nenlighten people about banking outlets as adequate substitutes for physical \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 \nbranches  in low population density or low population locations. \n13.  Role of Board of Directors  \nFinancial inclusion being the overarching objective of banking expansion and in view of the \noperational flexibility being given to the banks, it is necessary that the Boards of the Banks should \nensure that arrangements are in place for  strict compliance with these guidelines , in letter and \nspirit . Banks are therefore, advised to put in place a regular off-site and on-site monitoring system \nof the \u2018Banking Outlet\u2019 to ensure proper supervision, \u2018uninterrupted service\u2019 and timely addressing  \nof customer grievances. The Board shall  regularly review and monitor the transactions in these \noutlets to see that banking services are being transacted in these outlets and more specifically the \ntarget customers for financial inclusion are getting the banking facilities in unbanked rural centres. As such, the Boards of banks should set internal targets for financial inclusion. Data on centre-wise \nand tier -wise customer accounts and transactions (Type and number of accounts, deposits \nreceived, advances m ade, remittances processed, outstanding balances, etc.) shall be captured \non regular basis. As the Small Finance Banks and Payment Banks have been set up to further financial inclusion and their client base would primarily be migrant labour workforce, low income \nhouseholds, small businesses, other unorganised sector entities, etc. their internal targets should \nbe in line with their objectives. The Board shall  review the progress in this regard on regular basis, \nsay on quarterly basis and make the required data available to Reserve Bank as and when \nrequired and called for.  \n \n 10 \n 14. Reporting Requirements  \n14.1 Banks shall furnish the information as per Proforma I ( Annex VI)  on opening of new place of \nbusiness i.e. branch/office/NAIOs (Non Administratively Independent Office) and Proforma II \n(Annex VII) on change in status \u2013 merger, conversion, closure etc. to Department of Statistics and \nInformation Management (DSIM), Banking Statistics Division, Reserve Bank of India, Central \nOffice, C -8/9, Bandr a-Kurla Complex, Mumbai -400051. \n14.2   As regards fixed point BC outlets classified as \u2018banking outlets\u2019, banks are required to report the data as per Annex VIII on quarterly basis s tarting from April 01, 2017. In order to furnish the \ninitial statistics, banks have to furnish the first such report to DSIM, Reserve Bank of India (position \nas on March 31, 2017), not later one month from the date of issue of this Circular .  \n14.3   From the current year 2017-18, the annual reporting on opening of branches to the \nDepartment of Banking Regulation, Central Office has been dispensed with. \n15.  All the salient changes made from the existing branch authorization framework are furnished \nin the Appendix. 11 \n Annex I \nDetails of tier -wise classification of centres based on population \ni) Classification of centres (tier-wise)           Population(as per 2011 Census)  \nTier 1    - 1, 00,000 and above \nTier 2    - 50,000 to 99,999 \nTier 3    - 20,000 to 49,999 \nTier 4    - 10,000 to 19,999 \nTier 5    - 5,000 to 9,999 \nTier 6    - Less than 5000  \nii) Population-group wise classification of centres  \nRural Centre       - Population up to 9,999  \nSemi -urban centre   - from 10,000 to 99,999  \nUrban centre    - from 1, 00,000 to 9, 99,999 \n         Metropolitan centre   - 10, 00,000 and above    12 \n Annex II \nIllustrations for calculation of part time banking outlets \nPrescribed Period for Banking Outlet is 4 hours per day for 5 days ( min. 20 hrs spread over 5 \ndays ) this will remain constant denominator.  For ensuring that fairly regular service is available to \ncustomers, a maximum of 4 hours per day will be counted.   \nExample I  \nA banking outlet works for 2 hours for 2 days  \nMultiplying 2 x 2= 4 hours out of 20 prescribed hours.  \nIt will be counted 0.2 (4/20) outlet.  \nIt would be added to the denominator ( if opened in any centre/any tier) and in the numerator (if \nopened in URC).   \nExample 2 :   \nA banking outlet works for 6 hours for 3 days  Max. benefit allowed :  4 hours per day  \nHence 4x3 = 12  so 12/20 = It will be equal to 0.6 outlet.  \nExample 3: \nTotal no. of Banking Outlets  (Full time )  opened - 100 \nOpened in URCs (Full time) \u2013  30 \nOpened in URCs (Part time Banking Outlet)  - 2 outlets work ing for 6 hours for 3 days in URCs  \nMax. Benefit allowed: 4 hours per day  \nHence 4x3 = 12  so 12/20 = It will be equal to 0.6 = 06*2 = 1.2 outlets.  \n \nFor computation of 25% URC,  \nTotal outlets opened = 100+1.2 = 101.2 \nOpened in URC = 30+1.2 =31.2 \nURC % = 31.2/101.2*100 = 30.83% (Complies with the norm)  \n  13 \n Annex - III \nList of LWE districts \nAndhra Pradesh    \n  \n1.

As announced in the First Bi -monthly Monetary Policy Statement for 2017 -18, \nadditional settlements in the NEFT system at half -hour intervals  are being  introduced \nto enhance the efficiency of the system and add to customer convenience . The half \nhourly settlements would speed up the funds transfer process  and provide faster credit \nto the destination accounts.

The Framework aims at early identification of stressed assets and timely \nimplementation of a corrective action plan (CAP) to preserve the economic value of \nstressed assets. In order to ensure that the CAP is finalised and formulated in an expeditious manner, the Framework specifies  various timelines within which lenders \nhave to decide and implement the CAP. The Framework also contains disincentives, \nin the form of asset classification and accelerated provisioning where lenders fail to adhere to the provisions of the Framework. Despite this, delays have been observed \nin finalising and implementation of the CAP,  leading to delays in resolution of \nstressed assets in the banking system.  \n 3. It is hereby clarified that the CAP can also include resolution by way of Flexible Structuring of Project Loans, Change in Ownership under  Strategic Debt \nRestructuring, Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A), etc.  \n \n \n 2 \n \n4.  In this context , it is reiterated that lenders must  scrupulously adhere to the \ntimelines prescribed in the Framework for finalising and implementing the C AP. To \nfacilitate timely decision making, it has been decided that, henceforth, t he decisions \nagreed upon by a minimum of 60 percent of creditors by value and 50 percent of \ncreditors by number in the JLF would be considered as the basis for deciding the \nCAP, and will be binding on all lenders , subject to the exit  (by substitution)  option \navailable in the Framework . Lenders shall ensure that their representatives in the \nJLF are equipped with appropriate mandates , and that decisions taken at the JLF \nare implemented by the lenders within the timelines.    \n \n5. It shall be noted that  \n(i) the stand of the participating banks while voting on the final proposal before the \nJLF shall be unambiguous and unconditional;  \n(ii) any bank which does not support the majority decision on the CAP may exit \nsubject to substitution within the stipulated time line, failing which it shall abide the decision of the JLF;  \n(iii) the bank shall implement the JLF decision without any additional conditionalities; \nand  \n(iv) the Boards s hall empower their executives to implement the JLF decision without \nrequiring further approval from the Board.  \n \n6.

As part of effective risk management, banks are  required, inter -alia, to have a \nsystem of separation of credit risk management function from the credit sanction  \nprocess . However, it is observed that the banks follow diverse practices in this \nregard . In order to bring uniformity in approach followed by banks , as also , to align \nthe risk management system with the best practices , banks are advised  as under:  \na) They shall lay down a Board -approved policy cle arly defining the role and \nresponsibilities of the CRO . \nb) Appointment of the CRO shall be for a fixed tenure  with the approval of the \nBoard of Directors of the banks. The CRO may be transferred/removed from \nhis post before completion of the tenure only with the approval of the Board \nand such premature transfer/removal shall be reported to the Department of \nBanking Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.

In case the CRO reports to the \nMD & CEO, the RMC shall meet the CRO on one -to-one basis, without the \npresence of the MD & CEO, at least on a quarterly ba sis.  \ne) The CRO shall not have any reporting relationship with the business verticals \nof the bank and shall not be given any business targets.  \nf) In case the CRO is associated with the credit sanction process, it shall be \nclearly enunciated whether the CRO\u2019s ro le would be that of an advis er or a \ndecision maker. The policy shall include the necessary safeguards to ensure \nthe independence of the CRO.  \ng) In banks that follow committee approach in credit sanction process  for high \nvalue proposals, if the CRO is one of t he decision makers in the credit \nsanction process, he shall have voting power  and all mem bers who are part of \nthe credit sanction process, shall individually and severally  be liable for all the \naspects, including risk perspective related to the credit prop osal.  If the CRO  \nis not a part of the credit sanction process, his role will be limited to that of an \nadvis er. \nh) In banks which do not follow committee approach for sanction of high value \ncredits , the CRO can only be an advis er in the sanction process and shall not \nhave any sanctioning power.  \ni) The CRO in his role as an advis er shall be an invitee to the credit \nsanction/approval committee without any voting rights in the proceedings of \nthe committee.  \nj) There shall not be any \u2018dual hatting\u2019 i.e. the CRO  shall not be given the \nresponsibility of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief \nFinancial Officer , Chief of the internal audit function or any other function . \n \nYours faithfully,  \n \n \n \n(S.

Banks are advised to make logistical arrangements to collect the posters/flyers/charts \nfrom the Regional offices of RBI during the first two weeks of May and distribute the same \nto their branches and FLCs well in advance before the Financial Literacy Week. \n \n5. During the week, the following activities have been planned:  \nI. Banks to advise their Financial Literacy Centres to conduct special camps on each \nof the five days in backward/unbanked areas. FLC Counsellors may utilize the \ncharts of A2 size for training purposes. FLCs may distribute the promotional \nmaterial of A5 sizes  to the participa nts.  \nII. All bank branches in the country may display A3 size posters on the five messages \nin the local language in a prominent place inside the branch premises. These \nposters will continue to be displayed for at least six months in the branch premises \neven after the Financial Literacy week is over.  \nIII. Banks may display one message each day on the home page of their websites in \nEnglish and Hindi and also display one message each day on the ATM screens across  the country in English and the local languages  (Annex ure) \nIV. All Rural branches may conduct one camp on any of the five days of the week after \nbranch hours. \nV.

For a successful bid of Rs.200 crore in 14 day Term Repo auction on April 18, \n2017, a participant provides a Central  Govt. security 8.40% GS 2024 worth Rs. \n208 crore market value (including 4% margin for Central Government security).  \nii. The dirty price of the security is calculated based on the latest file published by \nFIMMDA i.e. of April 17, 2017. Assume the price to be Rs. 110.  \niii. Therefore, the face value of security 8.40% GS 2024 that is debited from Repo \nConstituent  (RC)  account (after rounding- up) would be Rs.189.091 crore (208 x \n100 /110).  \nApril 20, 2017  \niv. The participant chooses to substitute Rs.100 crore face value of the security \n8.40% GS 2024 with a new security 8.83% GS 2023 on April 20, 2017.  \nv. The dirty price of 8.83% GS 2023 would be based on the latest available FIMMDA price in the system i.e. the file published on April 19, 2017. Assume the price to be 115.  \nvi.

In order to distinguish the    \nApril 201 7 (year 2017 -18) and Marc h Residual Transactions, the statement \npertaining to March Residual Transactions should be clearly marked as \"March Residual Account\".   \n Note: As advised in our circular GA.NB.No.376/42.01.001/1995 -96 dated May 22, \n1996 all the cheques/amounts realized on  or before March 31, 2017  should be \ntreated as transactions relating to the current financial year as \"March 201 7 or March \nResidual Transactions\", the reporting of which may take place during the month of \nApril (upto April 1 0, 2017 ).  But if any cheque is tendered on or before March 31, \n2017  and realized on or after April 1, 201 7, it will be treated as transaction for the \nnext financial year as \"April Transactions\".  Accordingly, the banks will prepare \nseparate scrolls for March 2017  and April 2017  (year 2017 -18) transactions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI2499854C3AA061A47999612E858E986F94E.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Mar 09, 2017", "info": "Reserve Bank of India  \nForeign Exchange Department  \nCentral Office \nMumbai \u2013 400 001 \n \n \nNotification No. FEMA. 387/2017 -RB                                                                                              March 09 , 2017 \n \nForeign Exchange Management (Tra nsfer or Issue of Security by a Person  \nResident outside India) ( Fourth Amendment) Regulations, 2017  \n \nIn exercise of the powers conferred by clause (b) of sub -section (3) of Section 6 and Section 47 of the Foreign \nExchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999), the Reserve Bank of India hereby makes the following amendments in \nthe Foreign Exchange Management (Tra nsfer or issue of Security by a Person Resident outside India) Regulations, 2000 \n(Notification No. FEMA. 20/2000 -RB dated 3rd May 2000 ) namely: - \n \n1.

The Indian Agents can in turn also \nappoint sub -agents to expand their network. The Indian Agent is not allowed to remit \nany amount to the Overseas Principal.
