In this connection, we advise that the Board for Financial Supervision (BFS), while\nexamining the roles of Professional and Nominee Directors, has observed  that Professional\nDirectors who  associate with companies for their expert knowledge act as Independent\nDirectors.  Such Independent Directors apart from receiving director's remuneration do not\nhave any material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the company, its promoters, its\nmanagement or its subsidiaries, which in the judgment of Board may affect their independent\njudgment.   BFS further     observed that as a guiding principle of disclosure, no material fact\nshould be suppressed while disclosing the names of a company which   is a defaulter and the\nnames of all directors should be published.  However, while doing so, a suitable\ndistinguishing remark could be made as a foot-note clarifying that the concerned person was\na 'nominee director' or 'independent director'.\n3.  In view of the above, banks and FIs are advised to substitute the words \"Professional\nDirectors\" by  \"Independent Directors\" in the reporting formats and report the names of all\ndirectors including Independent Directors and Nominee Directors of banks/FIs/Central\nGovt./State Govts in their lists of defaulters of Rs. 1 crore and above, suit-filed accounts and\nwilful defaulters of Rs. 25 lakhs and above to be submitted to Reserve Bank commencing\nfrom the period ending March 2002 and onwards. However, against the names of Nominee\nDirectors and Independent Directors, they should indicate the abbreviations  \"Nom\" and\n\"Ind\" respectively in brackets to distinguish them from other directors.\n4. Banks and FIs are also advised to keep in mind  our  instructions regarding exercise of due\ncaution while dealing with defaulting companies and their directors.\n5.

Accordingly, the Boards of public sector banks may formulate a policy\nfor recovery of these NPAs, keeping the following parameters in view.\n2. (i)   Coverage\na) The guidelines will cover all loan accounts with outstanding balance of up to\nRs.25,000 principal amount (excluding any interest element)  in all sectors\nirrespective of the nature of business or purpose, which have become NPAs as\non March 31, 1998.\nb) The guidelines will also cover suit-filed and decreed debts. After the\nsettlement is reached, the banks may take appropriate steps for closure of\ncases in respective courts.\nc) The scheme will not, however, cover cases of fraud, malfeasance and wilful\ndefaults.\nd) The guidelines will be operative up to June 30, 2002.2\n(ii)  Settlement Formula \u2013 Amount and cut-off date\nThe amount that should be recovered as settlement amount under these guidelines\nwould be the balance outstanding towards principal in the loan account as on March\n31, 1998. Any interest which is included in the outstanding amount as on March 31,\n1998 or accrued on the balance outstanding after March 31, 1998 will be waived.\n(iii) Payment\nThe amount of settlement arrived at as above, should normally be paid in one lump\nsum. In deserving cases, banks may consider recovering the settlement amount in\ninstallments with down payment of at least 25% to be received at the time of\nsettlement. The balance amount should be recovered within one year from the date of\nsettlement.\n(iv) Sanctioning Authority\nThe decision on the compromise settlement would be vested with the branch\nmanager.  In case the loan had been sanctioned by the branch manager himself, the\ndecision on compromise settlement for such cases, should be taken by the next higher\nauthority.\n(v) Non-discriminatory treatment\nThe banks should follow the above guidelines for compromise settlement of NPAs\ncovered, without discrimination.\n(vi) Formulation of Policy\nThe Board of Directors of the bank should frame policy on compromise settlement of\nNPAs covered under the guidelines. The banks can also devise their own accounting\nprocedure for treatment of the outstanding amount subject to the one-time settlement.\n(vii) Publicity\nBanks should give adequate publicity of the scheme to all the eligible defaulting\nborrowers to avail of the opportunity of One Time Settlement Scheme of their\noutstanding dues in terms of these guidelines.3\n(viii) Review by the Board\nA monthly report on the progress and details of settlement made should be submitted\nby the concerned authority to the next higher authority and the Head Office.

Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI.\nThe minimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in\nmultiples in Rs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent subsidiary\ngeneral ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish to\nparticipate. However, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An\nundertaking to the effect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be\nobtained and kept on record by the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz.\nname, amount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment\non the date of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment\nfrom their clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of notified\namount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be the\nresponsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a\ntransparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the\nshortfall will be taken to competitive portion.6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the main\nSGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The\nfacility for affording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of\nservicing investors who are not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would\nhave to indicate clearly at the time of tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts\n(face value ) to be credited to their SGL account and the CSGL account. Delivery in\nphysical form from the main SGL account is permissible at the instance of the\ninvestor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to their\nclients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients\nshall be completed within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such\ncosts may be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case\nthe transfer of securities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the\nconsideration amount payable by the client to the bank or PD would also include\naccrued interest from the date of issue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities, accrued\ninterest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be\nworked out by the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that\nno other costs such as funding costs should be built into the price or recovered from\nthe client.\nV. Information to RBI : Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating\nto operations under the Scheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for\nfrom time to time within the time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. Review: The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and accordingly,\nif and when considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/24917.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Dec 08, 2001", "info": "Auction of Government Securities:\nNon-competitive bidding facility to retail investors\nRef.No.IDMC.   /08.01.02/2001-2002.\nDecember 7, 2001\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks /All State Co-operative\nBanks/All Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative\nBanks/ All Primary Dealers\nAuction of Government Securities:\nNon-competitive bidding facility to retail investors\nDear Sirs,\nIt was announced in the 'Statement on Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2001-\n2002' that in order to encourage retail participation in the primary market for Government\nSecurities, it is proposed to allocate upto a maximum of 5 (five) percent of the notified\namount in auctions of select dated securities for allotment to retail investors on a \"non-\ncompetitive\" basis at the weighted average rate.

No. 752/01.10.00/98099 dated April 21, 1999 on the captioned\nsubject enumerating the treatment of preference shares, with original maturity of 20 years, issued\nby the FIs for the purpose of capital adequacy norms.\n2. Under the extant instructions, for compu tation of the amount of \u201cgrant equivalent\u201d, the\nmodalities for capturing the varying rates of dividend on the preference shares issued and the\nrate(s) of return on the utilisation / investment of the funds received by the FIs through the\nissuance of the preference shares, had not been explicitly spelt out. In this context, certain\nanomalies have been observed since the \u201cgrant equivalent\u201d accrues to the FIs even when, in a\nstructured transaction of issuance of preference shares, the quantum of cash outflows (on account\nof payment of dividend, dividend tax, where applicable, and income tax on investment income,\netc.) exceeds the amount of cash inflows on account of income on deployment of the funds\nreceived. Thus, the \u201cgrant equivalent\u201d gets reckoned as part of the regulatory capital even though\nthere is no unrequited transfer of funds at below the market rate from the subscriber(s) of the\npreference shares to the FI concerned, which could give rise to \u201c grant equivalent\u201d.\n3. In order, therefore, to obviate s uch anomalies in future, the norms have been reviewed and\nit has been decided to modify the present instructions in the matter. Accordingly, in respect of\npreference shares (existing as well as those that may be issued in future) of 20 year original\nmaturity, the amount of \u201cgrant equivalent\u201d that can be reckoned towards the Tier 1 capital of the\nFIs would be computed after making the following adjustments in the amount received against\nsubscription to the preference shares:\nAmount received against the preference shares \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(A)\nLESS :\n(a) the amount of corpus created in terms of our Circular DBS.

In case, the amount left after creating the corpus is not deployed in separate identifiable\ninvestments / securities but is used as part of the overall working funds of the institution, then the\ncash inflow on account of income thereon should be notionally  computed at the rate equal to the\nreturn on average working funds of the FI concerned during preceding financial year.\n5. As the tax rates on dividend payments / investment income might change over the life of\nthe preference shares / investments, the aforesaid computation should be reviewed at the balance\nsheet date every year, or more frequently if possible, to account for such changes and the amount\nof \u201cgrant equivalent\u201d adjusted suitably.

On a selective basis,\nthe Reserve Bank of India may permit a higher equity contribution by a promoter FI initially,\npending divestment of equity within the prescribed period [see Note (1) below]. The eligibility\ncriteria for joint venture participant will be as under, as per the latest available audited balance\nsheet:\ni. The owned fund of the FI should not be less than Rs. 500 crore. The owned fund\nfor the purpose should be computed as per the definition of \u2018net owned fund\u2019\nunder Section 45-IA of the RBI Act, 1934;\nii. The CRAR of the FI should be not less than 15%;\niii. The level of net non-performing assets should be not more than 5% of the total\noutstanding loans and advances;\niv. The FI should have earned net profit for the last three continuous years;\nv. The track record of the performance of the subsidiaries, if any, of the concerned FI\nshould be satisfactory;\nvi.

In case where a foreign partner contributes 26 per cent of the equity with the approval of\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority / Foreign Investment Promotion Board, more\nthan one FI may be allowed to participate in the equity of the insurance joint venture. Since such\nparticipants will also assume insurance risk, only those FIs which satisfy the criteria given in\nparagraph 2 above, would be eligible.\n4. No FI would be allowed to conduct insurance business with risk participation ,\ndepartmentally. A subsidiary or a company in the same group of the FI or of another FI engaged\nin non-banking or banking business, will not normally be allowed to join the insurance company\non risk participation basis.\n5. FIs, falling within the regulatory and supervisory domain of RBI, which are not eligible as\njoint venture participant, as per the foregoing criteria, can make investments up to 10 per cent of2\nthe owned fund of the FI or Rs.50 crore, whichever is lower, in the insurance company. Such\nparticipation shall be treated as an investment and should be without any contingent liability for\nthe FI. The eligibility criteria for these FIs will be as under:\ni. The CRAR of the FI should not be less than 15 per cent;\nii. The level of net NPA should be not more than 5 per cent of total outstanding loans and\nadvances;\niii. The FI should have earned net profit for the last three continuous years.\n6. All FIs entering into insurance business as agents or investors or on risk participation\nbasis will be required to obtain prior approval of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank will give\npermission to the FIs on a case to case basis keeping in view all relevant factors. It should be\nensured that risks involved in insurance business do not get transferred to the FI and that its\nbusiness does not get contaminated by any risks which may arise from insurance business.\nNote :\n(1) Holdin g of equity by a promoter FI in an insurance company or participation in any form\nin insurance business will be subject to compliance with any rules and regulations laid down by\nthe IRDA/ Central Government.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SIMPLIFICATION OF PROCEDURES\n1.1 Customer Service\n1.1.1 General\n(i) Banks may provide timely and adequate credit and also render\nessential customer services/guidance in regard to proceduralformalities and export opportunities to their exporter clients.\n(ii) Banks should open Export Counsel Offices to guide exporters\nparticularly the small ones and those taking up non-traditional\nexports.\n1.1.2 Delay in Crediting the Proceeds of Export Bills Drawn in Foreign\nCurrency\nDelays are observed in passing on the credit of export bills drawn in\nforeign currency to the exporters after the foreign currency amounts\nare credited to the \u2018Nostro\u2019 accounts of the banks. Although there areinstructions that the concessional post-shipment interest rate will ceasefrom the date of credit to the 'Nostro' account, the credit limits enjoyed\nby the exporters remain frozen till the actual date of credit of rupee\nequivalent to the account of the customer. There is, therefore, need topromptly restore the limit of the exporters on realisation of bills andpass on the rupee credit to the customer.\n1.1.3 Payment of Compensation to Exporters for Delayed Credit of Export\nBills\n(i) In respect of the delay in affording credit in respect of credit\nadvices complete in all respects, the compensation stipulated byFEDAI should be paid to the exporter client, without waiting for\na demand from the exporter.\n(ii) Banks should devise a system to monitor timely credit of the\nexport proceeds to the exporters\u2019 account and payment ofcompensation as per FEDAI rules.\n(iii) The internal audit and inspection teams of the banks should\nspecifically comment on these aspects in the reports.\n1.2   Sanction of Export Credit Proposals\n1.2.1 Time Limit for Sanction\n(i) The sanction of fresh/enhanced export credit limits should be\nmade within 45 days from the date of receipt of credit limit\napplication with the required details/information supported byrequisite financial/operating statements. In case of renewal oflimits and sanction of ad hoc credit facilities, the time taken by\nbanks should not exceed  30 days and 15 days respectively.21.2.2 Ad hoc Limit\n(i) At times, exporters require ad hoc limits to take care of large\nexport orders which were not foreseen earlier. Banks shouldrespond to such situations promptly. Apart from this, banks\nshould adopt a flexible approach in respect of exporters, who for\ngenuine reasons are unable to bring in corresponding additionalcontribution in respect of higher credit limits sought for specificorders. No additional interest is to be charged in respect of\nad hoc limits granted by way of pre-shipment/post-shipment\nexport credit.\n(ii) In cases where the export credit limits are utilised fully, banks\nmay adopt a flexible approach in negotiating the bills drawnagainst L/Cs and consider in such cases delegating\ndiscretionary/higher sanctioning powers to branch managers to\nmeet the credit requirements of the exporters. Similarlybranches may also be authorised to disburse a certain percentageof the enhanced/ad hoc limits, pending sanction by the higher\nauthorities/board/committee who had originally accorded\nsanctions, to enable the exporters to execute urgent exportorders in time.\n1.2.3.\n Other Requirements\n(i) All rejections of export credit proposals should be brought to the\nnotice of the Chief Executives of the banks explaining the\nreasons for rejection.\n(ii) The internal audit and inspection teams of the banks should\ncomment specifically on the timely sanction of export credit\nlimits within the time schedule prescribed by RBI.\n(iii) The export credit limits should be excluded for bifurcation of\nthe working capital limit into loan and cash credit components.\n(iv) Banks should nominate suitable officers as compliance officers\nin their foreign departments/specialised branches to ensure\nprompt and timely disposal of cases pertaining to exporters.\n(v) It is necessary to submit a review note at quarterly intervals to\nthe Board on the position of sanction of credit limits to\nexporters. The note may cover among other things, number ofapplications (with quantum of credit) sanctioned within theprescribed time-frame, number of cases sanctioned with delayand pending sanction explaining reasons therefor.31.3Simplification of Procedure for Delivery of Export Credit in Foreign\n           Currency and in Rupees\n1.3.1General\nWith a view to ensuring timely delivery of credit to exporters\nand removing  procedural  hassles, the following guidelines maybe brought into effect. These guidelines are applicable to Rupee\nexport credit as well as export credit in foreign currency .\n1.3.2Guidelines\n(i) Simplification of procedures\n(a) Banks should simplify the application form and reduce\ndata requirements from exporters for assessment of theircredit needs, so that exporters do not have to seek outsideprofessional help to fill in the application form or to\nfurnish data required by the banks.\n(b) Banks should adopt any of the methods, viz. Projected\nBalance Sheet method, Turnover method or Cash Budgetmethod, for assessment of working capital requirements of\ntheir exporter-customers, whichever is most suitable and\nappropriate to their business operations.\n(c) In the case of consortium finance, once the consortium has\napproved the assessment, member banks should\nsimultaneously initiate their respective sanction processes.\n(ii) 'On Line' credit to exporters\n(a) Banks provide 'Line of Credit' normally for one year which\nis reviewed annually. In case of delay in renewal, thesanctioned limits should be allowed to continueuninterrupted and urgent requirements of exporters should\nbe met on ad hoc basis.\n(b) In case of established exporters having satisfactory track\nrecord, banks should consider sanctioning a 'Line of Credit'\nfor a longer period, say, 3 years, with in-built flexibility to\nstep-up/step-down the quantum of limits within the overallouter limits assessed. The step-up limits will becomeoperative on attainment of pre-determined performance\nparameters by the exporters. Banks should obtain security\ndocuments covering the outer limit sanctioned to theexporters for such longer period.4(c) In case of export of seasonal commodities, agro-based\nproducts etc., banks should sanction Peak/Non-peak credit\nfacilities to exporters.\n(d) Banks should permit interchangeability of pre-shipment\nand post- shipment credit limits.\n(e) Term Loan requirements for expansion of capacity,\nmodernisation of machinery and upgradation of technologyshould also be met by banks at their normal rate of interest.\n(f) Assessment of export credit limits should be 'need based'\nand not directly linked to the availability of collateralsecurity. As long as the requirement of credit limit isjustified on the basis of the exporter's performance and\ntrack record, the credit should not be denied merely on the\ngrounds of non-availability of collateral security.\n(iii) Waiver of submission of orders or L/Cs for availing pre-\nshipment credit\n(a) Banks should not insist on submission of export order or\nL/C for every disbursement of pre-shipment credit, fromexporters with consistently good track-record. Instead, a\nsystem of periodical submission of a Statement of L/Cs or\nexport orders in hand, should be introduced.\n(b) Banks may waive, ab initio, submission of order/LC in\nrespect of exporters with good track record and put in\nplace the system of obtaining periodical statement of\noutstanding orders/LCs on hand. However, the same maybe incorporated in the sanction proposals as well as in thesanction letters issued to exporters and appropriately\nbrought to the notice of ECGC. Further, if such waivers are\npermitted at a time subsequent to sanction of export creditlimits with the approval of the appropriate authority, thesame may be incorporated in the terms of sanction by way\nof amendments and communicated to ECGC.\n(iv) Handling of export documents\nBanks are required to obtain, among others, original sale\ncontract/confirmed order/proforma invoice countersigned by\noverseas buyer/indent from authorised agent of overseas buyerfor handling the export documents as per Exchange Controlregulations. Submission of such documents need not be insisted\nupon at the time of handling the export documents, since the\ngoods have already been valued and cleared by the Customsauthorities, except in the case of transactions with Letters ofCredit (L/C) where the terms of L/C require submission of the\nsale contract/other alternative documents.5(v) Fast track clearance of export credit\n(a) At specialised branches and branches having sizeable\nexport business, a facilitation mechanism for assistingexporter-customers should be put in place for quick initialscrutiny of credit application and for discussions for\nseeking additional information or clarifications.\n(b) Banks should streamline their internal systems and\nprocedures to comply with the stipulated time limits for\ndisposal of export credit proposals and also endeavour to\ndispose of export credit proposals ahead of the prescribedtime schedule. A flow chart indicating chronologicalmovement of credit application from the date of receipt till\nthe date of sanction, should also accompany credit\nproposals.\n(c) Banks should delegate higher sanctioning powers to their\nbranches for export credit.\n(d) Banks should consider reducing at least some of the\nintervening layers in the sanctioning process. It would bedesirable to ensure that the total number of layers involved\nin decision-making in regard to export finance does not\nexceed three.\n(e) Banks should introduce a system of 'Joint Appraisal' by\nofficials at branches and administrative offices, to facilitate\nquicker processing of export credit proposals.\n(f) Where feasible, banks should set up a 'Credit Committee'\nat specialised branches and at administrative offices, for\nsanctioning working capital facilities to exporters. The\n'Credit Committee' should have sufficiently highersanctioning powers.\n(vi) Publicity and training\nGenerally, export credit at internationally competitive rates is\nmade available in foreign currency at select branches of banks.In order to make the scheme more popular, wide publicity\nshould be given by banks and more number of branches should\nbe designated for making available export credit in foreigncurrency. Officers at operating level should be provided withadequate training. In the matter of transfer of officials fromcritical branches dealing in export credit, banks should ensure\nthat the new incumbents posted possess adequate knowledge/\nexposure in the areas of forex as well as export credit to avoiddelays in processing/sanctioning of export credit limits andsubjecting exporters to the risk of cancellation of export orders.6(vii) Customer Education\n(a) Banks should bring out a Hand Book containing salient\nfeatures of the simplified procedures for sanction of ExportCredit in Foreign Currency at internationally competitiverates as well as in rupees for the benefit of their exporter-\nclients.\n(b) To facilitate interaction between banks and exporters,\nbanks should periodically organise Exporters' Meet at\ncentres with concentration of exporters\n1.3.3    Monitoring Implementation of Guidelines\n(i) Banks should ensure that exporters \u2019 credit requirements are met\nin full and promptly at competitive rates. The above referred\nguidelines must be implemented, both in letter and spirit, so asto bring about a perceptible improvement in credit delivery andrelated banking services to export sector. Banks should also\naddress the deficiencies, if any, in the mechanism of deployment\nof staff in their organisations to eliminate the bottlenecks in theflow of credit to the export sector.\n(ii) Banks should set up an internal team to visit branches\nperiodically, say, once in two months to gauge the extent of\nimplementation of the Guidelines.\n2. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n2.1 Export Credit Performance Indicator for Banks\n2.1.1 Banks are required to reach a level of outstanding export credit\nequivalent of 12% of each bank's net bank credit. Accordingly, the\nperformance of banks is being reviewed by the RBI, IECD at quarterlyintervals. The performance of the banks in extending export credit willbe assessed on the basis of the average export credit outstanding\nreported in the fortnightly statement of Export Credit Refinance Limits\nsubmitted on reporting Fridays to RBI, MPD, Central Office, Mumbai,a copy of which is to be forwarded to RBI, IECD, Central Office,Mumbai.\n2.1.2 Banks should endeavour to reach a level of export credit equivalent to\n12 percent of the bank \u2019s net bank credit. Where banks have already\nprovided export credit to the extent of 12 percent, endeavour should be\nmade to increase the same to a higher level and ensure that there is nofall in the ratio. No worthwhile export order should be denied exportcredit from the banks.\n2.1.3 Failure to achieve the stipulated level of export credit and or failure to\nshow a distinct improvement in export credit performance could invite\nbank-specific policy responses which could include raising of reserverequirements and withdrawal of refinance facilities. The Industrial &Export Credit Department of the Reserve Bank of India would closely\nmonitor the export credit performance of the banks.72.2 Quarterly Data of Export Credit Disbursements\nBanks should submit the export credit disbursement data on a quarterly basis in\nthe format given in Annexure 1 . Banks should ensure that the statement reaches\nReserve Bank of India, Industrial & Export Credit Department, Central Office,\nMumbai positively by the end of the month following the quarter to which itrelates.\n2.3 Pre-shipment Credit to Diamond Exporters - Conflict Diamonds &\nSierra Leone Rough Diamonds\nTrading in conflict diamonds  has been banned by U.N. Resolution Nos. 1173\nand 1176 as the conflict diamonds play a large role in funding the rebels in thecivil torn areas of Sierra Leone, Angola and Congo. There is also a prohibition\non the direct/indirect import of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone and\nLiberia in terms of the UN Resolution No. 1306 (2000) and 1343(2001)respectively.  In view of this, the banks should obtain an undertaking in the\nformat given in Annexure 2  from such of the clients who have been extended\ncredit for doing any business relating to diamonds.

PRE-SHIPMENT EXPORT CREDIT\n1.1 Pre-shipment Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC)\n1.1.1 Definition\n'Pre-shipment'  means any loan or advance granted or any other credit\nprovided by a bank to an exporter for financing the purchase,\nprocessing, manufacturing  or packing of goods  prior to shipment, on\nthe basis of letter of credit opened in his favour or in favour of some\nother person, by an overseas buyer or a confirmed and irrevocable\norder for the export of goods from India or any other evidence of anorder for export from India having been placed on the exporter or someother person, unless lodgement  of export orders or letter of credit with\nthe bank has been waived .\n1.1.2 General\nWith a view to making credit available to exporters at internationally\ncompetitive rates, authorised dealers have been permitted to extendPre-shipment Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC) to exporters for\ndomestic and imported inputs of exported goods at LIBOR/EURO\nLIBOR/EURIBOR related rates of interest as detailed below.\n1.1.3 Scheme\n(i) The scheme is an additional window for providing pre-shipment\ncredit to Indian exporters at internationally competitive rates of\ninterest. It will be applicable to only cash exports.\n(ii) The exporter will have the following two options to avail of\nexport finance:\n(a) to avail of pre-shipment credit in rupees and then the post-\nshipment credit either in rupees or discounting/\nrediscounting of export bills under EBR Schemementioned in paragraph 2.2.\n(b) to avail of pre-shipment credit in foreign currency and\ndiscount/rediscounting of the export bills in foreigncurrency under EBR Scheme.\n(iii) Choice of currency\n(a) The facility may be extended in one of the convertible\ncurrencies viz. US Dollars, Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen,Euro, etc.\n(b) To enable the exporters to have operational flexibility, it\nwill be in order for banks to extend PCFC in oneconvertible currency in respect of an export order invoicedin another convertible currency. For example , an exporter\ncan avail of PCFC in US Dollar against an export order\ninvoiced in Euro.  The risk and cost of cross currencytransaction will be that of the exporter.2(iv) Banks are permitted to extend PCFC for exports to ACU\ncountries.\n(v) The applicable benefit to the exporters will accrue only after the\nrealisation of the export bills or when the resultant export billsare rediscounted \u2018without recourse\u2019 basis.\n1.1.4 Source of Funds for Banks\n(i) The foreign currency balances available with the bank in\nExchange Earners Foreign Currency (EEFC) Accounts,Resident Foreign Currency Accounts (RFC) and Foreigncurrency (Non-Resident) Accounts (Banks) Scheme could beutilised for financing the pre-shipment credit in foreign\ncurrency.\n(ii) Banks are also permitted to utilise the foreign currency balances\navailable under Escrow Accounts and Exporters ForeignCurrency Accounts for the purpose, subject to ensuring that the\nrequirements of funds by the account holders for permissible\ntransactions are met and the limit prescribed for maintainingmaximum balance in the account under broad based facility isnot exceeded.\n(iii) Foreign currency lines of credit\n(a) In addition, banks may arrange for \u2018lines of credit\u2019  from\nabroad. Banks may negotiate lines of credit with overseas\nbanks for the purpose of grant of PCFC to exporters\nwithout the prior approval of the RBI, provided the rate ofinterest on the line of credit does not exceed 1 percent oversix months LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR. Cases\nwhere the rate of interest exceeds this ceiling should be\nreferred to RBI, Exchange Control Department, CentralOffice, Mumbai giving full details of the facility such asnames of foreign banks/institutions, amount of foreign\ncurrency, eligibility criteria, period of facility, spread, etc.\nfor prior approval.\n(b) As soon as the terms and conditions of the lines of credit to\nbe availed of by the bank from overseas banks have been\nfinalised, these may be advised to the Exchange Control\nDepartment, RBI, Central Office, Mumbai.\n(c) Banks should draw on the line of credit arranged only to\nthe extent of loans granted by them to the exporters under\nthe PCFC. However, where the overseas bank makingavailable the line of credit stipulates a minimum amountfor drawals which should not be very large, the small\nunutilised portion may be managed by the bank within its\nforeign exchange position and Aggregate Gap Limit(AGL) limit. Similarly, any pre-payment by the exportermay also be taken within the foreign exchange position\nand AGL limits.3(d) Banks may avail of lines of credit from other banks in\nIndia if they are not in a position to raise loans from\nabroad on their own, subject to the condition that ultimate\ncost to the exporter should not exceed 1.0 percent aboveLIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR, provided the bankdoes not have a branch abroad. The spread between the\nborrowing and lending bank is left to the discretion of the\nbanks concerned.\n(iv) In case, the exporters have arranged for the suppliers \u2019 credit for\nprocuring imported inputs, the PCFC facility may be extended\nby the banks only for the purpose of financing domestic inputs\nfor exports.\n1.1.5 Spread\n(i) The spread for pre-shipment credit in foreign currency will be\nrelated to the international reference rate such as LIBOR/EUROLIBOR/EURIBOR (6 months).\n(ii) The lending rate to the exporter should not exceed 1.0 percent\nover LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR, excluding withholdingtax.\n(iii) LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR rates are normally available\nfor standard period of 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months. Banks may\nquote rates on the basis of standard period if PCFC is requiredfor periods less than 6 months. However, while quoting rates fornon-standard period, banks should ensure that the rate quoted is\nbelow the next upper standard period rate.\n(iv) Banks may collect interest on PCFC at quarterly intervals\nagainst sale of foreign currency or out of balances in EEFC\naccounts or out of discounted value of the export bills if PCFC\nis liquidated within the quarterly rest for collection of interest.\n1.1.6 Period of Credit\n(i) The PCFC will be available as in the case of rupee credit\ninitially for a maximum period of 180 days; any extension of the\ncredit will be subject to the same terms and conditions as\napplicable for extension of rupee packing credit and it will alsohave additional interest cost of 2 percent above the rate for theinitial period of 180 days prevailing at the time of extension.\n(ii) Further extension will be subject to the terms and conditions\nfixed by the bank concerned and if no export takes place within360 days, the PCFC will be adjusted at T.T. selling rate for thecurrency concerned. In such cases, banks can arrange to remit\nforeign exchange to repay the loan or line of credit raised abroad\nand interest without prior permission of RBI.4(iii) For extension of PCFC within 180 days, banks are permitted to\nextend on a fixed roll over basis of the principal amount at the\napplicable LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR rate for extendedperiod plus permitted margin (1.0 percent over LIBOR/EUROLIBOR/EURIBOR).\n1.1.7 Disbursement of PCFC\n(i) In case, full amount of PCFC or part thereof is utilised to\nfinance domestic input, banks may apply appropriate spot ratefor the transaction.\n(ii) As regards the minimum lots of transactions, it is left to the\noperational convenience of banks to stipulate the minimum lots\ntaking into account the availability of their own resources.However, while fixing the minimum lot, banks may take intoaccount the needs of their small customers also.\n(iii) Banks should take steps to streamline their procedures so that no\nseparate sanction is needed for PCFC once the packing creditlimit has been authorised and the disbursement is not delayed atthe branches.\n1.1.8 Liquidation of PCFC Account\n(i) General\n(a) The facility of PCFC will be self-liquidating in nature.\nAccordingly, the PCFC should be liquidated out ofproceeds of export documents on their submission for\ndiscounting/rediscounting under the EBR Scheme detailed\nin paragraph 2.2.\n(b) The export bills will have to be discounted or covered by\ngrant of foreign currency loans (DP bills) to liquidate the\noutstanding PCFC. The question of sending export bills forcollection does not arise.\n(c) The PCFC should not be liquidated with foreign exchange\nacquired from other sources.\n(d) PCFC cannot be treated as a loan to be repaid in order to\navail of post-shipment credit separately.\n(ii) Packing credit in excess of F.O.B. value\nIn certain cases, (viz. agro based products like HPS Groundnut,\ndefatted & deoiled cakes, tobacco, pepper, cardamom, cashew\nnuts, etc.) where packing credit required is in excess of FOB\nvalue, PCFC would be available only for exportable portion ofthe produce.\n(iii) Substitution of order/commodity\nRepayment/liquidation of PCFC could be with export\ndocuments relating to any other order covering the same orany other commodity exported by the exporter . While5allowing substitution of contract in this way, banks should\nensure that it is commercially necessary and unavoidable. Banks\nshould also satisfy about the valid reasons as to why PCFC\nextended for shipment of a particular commodity cannot beliquidated in the normal method. As far as possible, thesubstitution of contract should be allowed if the exporter\nmaintains account with the same bank or it has the approval of\nthe members of the consortium, if any.\n1.1.9 Cancellation/Non-execution of Export Order\n(i) In case of cancellation of the export order for which the PCFC\nwas availed of by the exporter from the bank, or if the exporteris unable to execute the export order for any reason, it will be in\norder for the exporter to repay the loan together with accrued\ninterest thereon, by purchasing foreign exchange (principal +interest) from domestic market through the bank.  In such cases,interest will be payable on the rupee equivalent of principal\namount at the rate applicable to 'Export Credit Not Otherwise\nSpecified'  (ECNOS)  at pre-shipment stage plus a penal rate of\ninterest to be decided by the bank from the date of advance afteradjustment of interest of PCFC already recovered. Banks are\nfree to decide the rate of interest for ECNOS at pre-shipment\nstage, subject to PLR and spread guidelines.\n(ii) It will also be in order for the banks to remit the amount to the\noverseas bank, provided the PCFC was made available to\nexporter from the line of credit obtained from that bank.\n(iii) Banks may extend PCFC to such exporters subsequently, after\nensuring that the earlier cancellation of PCFC was due togenuine reasons.\n1.1.10 Running Account Facility for All Commodities\n(i) Banks are permitted to extend the \u2018Running Account \u2019 facility\nunder the PCFC Scheme to exporters for all commodities, on the\nlines of the facility available under rupee credit, subject to thefollowing conditions:\n(a) The facility may be extended provided the need for\n\u2018Running Account \u2019 facility has been established by the\nexporters to the satisfaction of the bank.\n(b) Banks may extend the facility only to those exporters\nwhose track record has been good.\n(c) In all cases, where Pre-shipment Credit \u2018Running Account \u2019\nfacility has been extended, the L/Cs or firm orders should be\nproduced within a reasonable period of time.\n(d)  The drawals made under Rupee \u2018Running Account \u2019\nfacility should not be converted into PCFC advances.6(e) The PCFC will be marked-off on the \u2018First-in-First-out \u2019\nbasis.\n(f) PCFC can also be marked-off with proceeds of export\ndocuments against which no PCFC has been drawn by theexporter.\n(ii) Banks should closely monitor the production of firm order or\nL/C subsequently by exporters and also the end-use of funds. Ithas to be ensured that no diversion of funds is made for\ndomestic use. In case of non-utilisation of PCFC drawals forexport purposes, the penal provisions stated above should bemade applicable and the \u2018Running Account \u2019 facility should be\nwithdrawn for the concerned exporter.\n(iii) Banks are required to take any prepayment by the exporter\nunder PCFC scheme within their foreign exchange position andAggregate Gap Limit (AGL) as indicated in paragraph 1.1.4 (iii)\n(c) above With the extension of \u2018Running Account \u2019 facility,\nmismatches are likely to occur for a longer period involving costto the banks. Banks may charge the exporters the funding cost,\nif any, involved in absorbing mismatches in respect of the\nprepayment beyond one month period.\n1.1.11 Forward Contracts\n(i) In terms of paragraph 1.1.3 (iii) above, PCFC can be extended\nin any of the convertible currencies in respect of an export order\ninvoiced in another convertible currency. Banks are also\npermitted to allow an exporter to book forward contract on thebasis of confirmed export order prior to availing of PCFC andcancel the contract (for portion of drawal used for imported\ninputs) at prevailing market rates on availing of PCFC.\n(ii) Banks are permitted to allow customers to seek cover in any\npermitted currency of their choice which is actively traded in themarket, subject to ensuring that the customer is exposed to\nexchange risk in a permitted currency in the underlying\ntransaction.\n(iii) While allowing forward contracts under the scheme, banks may\nensure compliance of the basic Exchange Control requirement\nthat the customer is exposed to an exchange risk in theunderlying transaction at different stages of the export finance.\n1.1.12 Sharing of EPC under PCFC\n(i) The rupee export packing credit is allowed to be shared between\nan export order holder and the manufacturer of the goods to be\nexported.7(ii) Similarly, banks may extend PCFC also to the manufacturer on\nthe basis of the disclaimer from the export order holder through\nhis bank. PCFC granted to the manufacturer can be repaid by\ntransfer of foreign currency from the export order holder byavailing of PCFC or by discounting of bills. Banks shouldensure that no double financing is involved in the transaction\nand the total period of packing credit is limited to the actual\ncycle of production of the exported goods.\n(iii) The facility may be extended where the banker or the leader of\nconsortium of banks is the same for both the export order holder\nand the manufacturer or, the banks concerned agree to such anarrangement where the bankers are different for export order\nholder and manufacturer. The sharing of export benefits will be\nleft to the mutual agreement between the export order holderand the manufacturer.\n1.1.13 Supplies from One EOU/EPZ/ SEZ Unit to Another EOU/EPZ/ SEZ\nUnit\n(i) PCFC may be made available to both the supplier EOU/EPZ/\nSEZ unit and the receiver EOU/EPZ/ SEZ unit.\n(ii) The PCFC for supplier EOU/EPZ/ SEZ unit will be for supply of\nraw materials/components of goods which will be further\nprocessed and finally exported by receiver EOU/EPZ/ SEZ unit.\nThe PCFC extended to the supplier EOU/EPZ/ SEZ unit will\nhave to be liquidated by receipt of foreign exchange from the\nreceiver EOU/EPZ/ SEZ unit, for which purpose, the receiver\nEOU/EPZ/ SEZ unit may avail of PCFC. The stipulation\nregarding liquidation of PCFC by payment in foreign exchangewill be met in such cases not by negotiation of export\ndocuments but by transfer of foreign exchange from the banker\nof the receiver EOU/EPZ/ SEZ unit to the banker of supplier\nEOU/EPZ/ SEZ unit. Thus, there will not normally be any post-\nshipment credit in the transaction from the supplier EOU/EPZ/\nSEZ unit\u2019s point of view.\n(iii) In all such cases, it has to be ensured by banks that there is no\ndouble financing for the same transaction. Needless to add, thePCFC to receiver EOU/EPZ/ SEZ unit will be liquidated by\ndiscounting of export bills.\n1.1.14 Deemed Exports\nPCFC may be allowed only for \u2018deemed exports \u2019 for supplies to\nprojects financed by multilateral/bilateral agencies/funds. PCFCreleased for \u2018deemed exports \u2019 should be liquidated by grant of foreign\ncurrency loan at post-supply stage, for a maximum period of 30 days\nor up to the date of payment by the project authorities, whichever isearlier.81.1.15 Refinance\nBanks will not be eligible for any refinance from RBI against export\ncredit under the PCFC scheme and, as such, the quantum of PCFCshould be shown separately from the export credit figures reported forthe purpose of drawing export credit refinance.\n1.1.16 Other Aspects\n(i) The applicable benefits such as credit of eligible percent of\nexport proceeds to EEFC Account etc. to the exporters will\naccrue only after realisation of the export bills and not at the\nstage of conversion of pre-shipment credit to post-shipment\ncredit (except when bills are discounted/ rediscounted 'withoutrecourse'). Surplus of export proceeds available after adjustingrelative export finance and credit to EEFC account should not\nbe allowed for setting-off of import bills.\n(ii) ECGC cover will be available in rupees only, whereas, PCFC is\nin foreign currency.\n(iii) For the purpose of reckoning banks' performance in extending\nexport credit, the rupee equivalent of the PCFC may be taken\ninto account.\n1.2 Diamond Dollar Account (DDA) Scheme\nUnder the Exim Policy 1997-2002, firms/companies dealing in\npurchase/sale of rough or cut and polished diamonds, with good track\nrecord of at least three years in import or export of diamonds with an\nannual average turnover of Rs. 5 crore or above during the preceding\nthree licensing years are permitted to carry out their business throughdesignated Diamond Dollar Accounts (DDAs). Under the DDA Scheme,it would be in order for banks to liquidate PCFC granted to a DDA\nholder by dollar proceeds from sale of cut and polished diamonds by\nhim to another DDA holder.\n2. POST-SHIPMENT EXPORT CREDIT\n2.1 Definition\n'Post-shipment Credit' means any loan or advance granted or any other credit\nprovided by an institution to an exporter of goods from India from the date ofextending credit after shipment of goods to the date of realisation of export\nproceeds.92.2.      Rediscounting of Export Bills Abroad Scheme (EBR)\n2.2.1      General\nBanks are also allowed to rediscount export bills abroad at rates linked\nto international interest rates at post-shipment stage.\n2.2.2.  Exporters' Choice\nThe exporters have the option to avail of pre-shipment credit and post-\nshipment credit either in rupee or in foreign currency. However, if thepre-shipment credit has been availed in foreign currency, the post-\nshipment credit has necessarily  to be under the EBR scheme since\nforeign currency pre-shipment credit has to be liquidated in foreigncurrency.\n2.2.3       Scheme\n(i) It will be comparatively easier to have a facility against bills\nportfolio (covering all eligible bills) than to have rediscounting\nfacility abroad on bill by bill basis. There will, however, be nobar if rediscounting facility on bill to bill basis is arranged by anbank in case of any particular exporter, especially for large\nvalue transactions.\n(ii) Banks may arrange a \"Bankers Acceptance Facility\" (BAF)\nfor rediscounting the export bills without any margin and duly\ncovered by collateralised documents.\n(iii) Each bank can have its own BAF limit(s) fixed with an overseas\nbank or a rediscounting agency or an arrangement with anyother agency such as factoring agency (in case of factoringarrangement, it should be on \"without recourse\" basis only).\n(iv) The exporters, on their own, can arrange for themselves a line of\ncredit with an overseas bank or any other agency (including afactoring agency) for discounting their export bills direct subjectto the following conditions:\n(a) Direct discounting of export bills by exporters with\noverseas  bank and/or any other agency will be done onlythrough the branch of a bank designated by him for this\npurpose.\n(b) Discounting of export bills will be routed through\ndesignated bank from whom the packing credit facility hasbeen availed of. In case, these are routed through any other\nbank, the latter will first arrange to adjust the amount\noutstanding under packing credit with the concerned bankout of the proceeds of the rediscounted bills.\n(v) As soon as terms and conditions of BAF/lines of credit or similar\nfacility with overseas bank/discounting agency or any other\nagency have been finalised, these may be advised by the bank orby the designated branch in the case of lines of credit negotiateddirectly by the exporter to the ECD, RBI, Central Office, Mumbai10together with a copy of the agreement entered into by the\nbank/exporter with overseas bank/discounting agency/any other\nagency, as the case may be.\n(vi) The limits granted to banks by overseas banks/discounting\nagencies under BAF will not be reckoned for the purpose ofborrowing limits fixed by RBI (ECD) for them.\n2.2.4       Eligibility Criteria\n(i) The Scheme will cover mainly export bills with usance period\nupto 180 days from the date of shipment (inclusive of normaltransit period and grace period, if any). There is, however, nobar to include demand bills if overseas institution has no\nobjection to it.\n(ii) For rediscounting export bills having payment terms beyond\n180 days from date of shipment, proposals will have to besubmitted to the RBI (ECD), Mumbai, furnishing all relevant\ndetails, for prior approval.\n(iii) The facility under the Scheme of Rediscounting may be offered\nin any convertible currency.\n(iv) Banks are permitted to extend the EBR facility for exports to\nACU countries.\n(v) For operational convenience, the BAF Scheme may be\ncentralised at a branch designated by the bank. There will,\nhowever, be no bar for other branches of the bank to operate the\nscheme as per their internal guidelines/instructions.\n2.2.5Source of On-shore Funds\n(i) There will be no bar on banks to utilise the foreign exchange\nresources available with them in Exchange Earners ForeignCurrency Accounts (EEFC), Resident Foreign Currency\nAccounts (RFC), Foreign Currency (Non-Resident) Accounts\n(Banks) Scheme, to discount usance bills and retain them intheir portfolio without resorting to rediscounting. In the case ofdemand bills [subject to what has been stated in paragraph 2.2.4(i) above], these may have to be routed through the existing\npost-shipment credit facility or by way of foreign exchange\nloans to the exporters out of the foreign currency balancesavailable with banks in the Schemes ibid.\n(ii) To facilitate the growth of local market for rediscounting export\nbills, establishment and development of an active inter-bank\nmarket is desirable. It is possible that banks hold bills in their\nown portfolio without rediscounting. However, in case of need,\nthe banks should also have access to the local market, whichwill enable the country to save foreign exchange to the extent ofthe cost of rediscounting. Further, as different banks may behaving BAF for varying amounts, it will be possible for a bank11which has balance available in its limit to offer rediscounting\nfacility to another bank which may have exhausted its limit or\ncould not arrange for such a facility.\n(iii) Banks may avail of lines of credit from other banks in India if\nthey are not in a position to raise loans from abroad on their own\nor they do not have branches abroad, subject to the conditionthat ultimate cost to the exporter should not exceed 1.0 percentabove LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR excluding withholding\ntax. The spread between the borrowing and lending bank is left\nto the discretion of the banks concerned.\n2.2.6Facility of Rediscounting 'with recourse' and 'without recourse'\nIt is recognised that it will be difficult to get \u2018without recourse\n\"facility from abroad under BAF or any other facility. Therefore, the\nbills may be rediscounted \u2018with recourse \u2019. However, if an AD is in a\nposition to arrange \u2018without recourse \u2019 facility on competitive terms, it\nis permitted to avail itself of such a facility.\n2.2.7Accounting Aspects\n(i) The Rupee equivalent of the discounted value of the export bills\nwill be payable to the exporter and the same should be utilised\nto liquidate the outstanding export packing credit.\n(ii) As the discounting of bills/extension of foreign exchange loans\n(DP bills) will be in actual foreign exchange, banks may apply\nappropriate spot rate for the transactions.\n(iii) The Rupee equivalents of discounted amounts/foreign exchange\nloan may be held in the bank \u2019s books distinct from the existing\npost-shipment credit accounts.\n(iv) In case of overdue bills banks may charge 2 percent above the\nrate of rediscounting of foreign exchange loan from the due date\nto the date of crystallisation.\n(v) Interest rate as per RBI interest rate directive for post-shipment\ncredit in Rupees will be applicable from the date of\ncrystallisation.\n(vi) In the event of export bill not being paid, it will be in order for\nthe bank to remit the amount equivalent to the value of the bill\nearlier discounted, to the overseas bank/agency which haddiscounted the bill, without the prior approval of the RBI.\n2.2.8\n Restoration of Limits and Availability of Export Benefits such as\nEEFC Account\nAs stated in paragraph 2.2.6 above, \"Without Recourse\" facility may\nnot generally be available. Thus, the restoration of exporter \u2019s limits\nand the availability of export benefits, such as credit to EEFC\naccounts, in case of \"with recourse\" facility,  will  be  effected  only onrealisation of export proceeds and not on the date of discounting/rediscounting of the bills, However, if the bills are rediscounted12\"without recourse\", the restoration of exporter \u2019s limits and availability\nof export benefits may be given effect immediately on rediscounting.\n2.2.9ECGC Cover\nIn the case of export bills rediscounted \u2018with recourse \u2019, there will not\nbe any change in the existing system of coverage provided by ExportCredit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) as the liability of the exporter\ncontinues till the relative bill is retired/paid. In other cases, where thebills are rediscounted \u2018without recourse \u2019, the liability of ECGC ceases\nas soon as the relative bills are rediscounted.\n2.2.10 Refinance\nBanks will not be eligible  for refinance from the RBI against export\nbills discounted/rediscounted under the Scheme and as such, the billsdiscounted/rediscounted in foreign currency should be shownseparately from the export credit figures reported for purposes of\ndrawing export credit refinance.\n2.2.11 Export Credit Performance\n(i) Only the bills rediscounted abroad \u2018with recourse \u2019 basis and\noutstanding will be taken into account for the purpose of export\ncredit performance. The bills rediscounted abroad \u2018without\nrecourse\u2019 will not count for the export credit performance.\n(ii) Bills rediscounted \u2018with recourse \u2019 in the domestic market could\nget reflected only in the case of the first bank discounting the\nbills as that bank alone will have recourse to the exporter and\nthe bank rediscounting will not reckon the amount as export\ncredit.\n3 INTEREST ON EXPORT CREDIT\n3.1Interest Rate Structure on Export Credit in Foreign Currency\n3.1.1 In respect of export credit to exporters at internationally competitive\nrates under the schemes of 'Pre-shipment Credit in Foreign Currency'\n(PCFC) and 'Rediscounting of Export Bills Abroad' (EBR), banks arepermitted to fix the rates of interest with reference to ruling LIBOR,EURO LIBOR or EURIBOR, wherever applicable, as under:13Type of Credit Interest Rate\n(percent p.a.)\nPre-shipment Credit\n(a) Upto 180 days Not exceeding 1% over\nLIBOR/EURO LIBOR/\nEURIBOR(i)\n(b) Beyond 180 days and upto 360\ndaysRate for initial period of\n180 days prevailing at\nthe time of extension +\n2.0 percentage points i.e.\n(i) (a) above + 2.0\nPost-shipment Credit\n(a) On demand bills for transit\nperiod (as specified by FEDAI)Not exceeding 1% over\nLIBOR/EURO LIBOR/\nEURIBOR\n(b) Against usance bills (credit for\ntotal period com prising usance\nperiod of ex port bills, transit\nperiod as s pecified by FEDAI,\nand grace period, wherever\napplicable)\nUpto 6 months from the date\nof shipmentNot exceeding 1% over\nLIBOR/EURO LIBOR/\nEURIBOR(ii)\n(c) Export bills (demand or\nusance) realised after due date\nbut upto date of crystillisationRate for (ii) (b) above +\n2.0 percentage points\nExport Credit Not OtherwiseSpecified (ECNOS)\n(a) Pre-shipment credit Free *(iii)\n(b) Post-shipment credit Free *\n* Banks are free to decide the rate of interest bein g rupee credit rate,\nkeeping in view the PLR and spread guidelines.14 Appendix\nMaster Circular\nEXPORT CREDIT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY\nList of Circulars consolidated by the Master Circular\nNo. Circular No. Date Subject\n1.

Special Financial Package for Large Value Exports - Rupee Credit Interest Rates\n5. Interest On Export Credit\n- Appendix\n- Index to key words\n1. PRE-SHIPMENT EXPORT CREDIT1.1 Rupee Pre-shipment Credit/Packing Credit\n1.1.1 Definition\n'Pre-shipment/Packing Credit'  means any loan or advance granted or any other credit\nprovided by a bank to an exporter for financing the purchase, processing,\nmanufacturing  or packing of goods  prior to shipment, on the basis of letter of credit\nopened in his favour  or in favour  of some other person, by an overseas buyer or a\nconfirmed and irrevocable order for the export of goods from India or any other evidence\nof an order for export from India having been placed on the exporter or some other\nperson, unless lodgement  of export orders or letter of credit with the bank has been\nwaived .\n1.1.2 Period of Advance\n(i) The period for which a packing credit advance may be given by a bank will depend\nupon the circumstances of the individual case, such as the time required for procuring,\nmanufacturing or processing (where necessary) and shipping the relative goods. It is\nprimarily for the banks to decide the period for which a packing credit advance may\nbe given having regard to the various relevant factors so that the period is sufficient\nto enable the exporter to ship the goods .\n(ii) If pre-shipment advances are not adjusted by submission of export documents within\n360 days from the date of advance, the advances will cease to qualify for concessive rate\nof interest to the exporter ab initio .\n(iii) RBI would provide refinance only for a period not exceeding 180 days.\n1.1.3 Disbursement of Packing Credit\n(i) Ordinarily, each packing credit sanctioned should be maintained as separate account\nfor the purpose of monitoring period of sanction and end-use of funds.\n(ii) Banks may release the packing credit in one lumpsum or in stages as per the\nrequirement for executing the orders/ LC.\n(iii) Banks may also maintain different accounts at various stages of processing,\nmanufacturing, etc. depending on the types of goods to be exported, e.g. hypothecation,\npledge, etc., accounts and may ensure that the outstanding balance in accounts are\nadjusted by transfer from one account to the other and finally by proceeds of relative\nexport documents on purchase, discount, etc.\n(iv) Banks should continue to keep a close watch on the end-use of the funds and ensure\nthat credit at lower rates of interest is used for genuine requirements of exports. Banks\nshould also monitor the progress made by the exporters in timely fulfilment of export\norders.\n1.1.4 Liquidation of Packing Credit\n(i) General\nThe packing credit/pre-shipment credit granted to an exporter must be liquidated\nout of proceeds of bill drawn for the exported commodities on its purchase,\ndiscount, etc. thereby converting pre-shipment credit into post-shipment credit. Ifnot so liquidated, banks should charge the rate of interest for ECNOS -Pre-\nshipment as indicated in paragraph 5.2.1 (4) from the date of advance.\n(ii) Packing credit in excess of export value\n(a) Where by-product can be exported\nWhere the exporter is unable to tender export bills of equivalent value for\nliquidating the packing credit due to the shortfall on account of wastage\ninvolved in the processing of agro products like raw cashew nuts, etc.,\nbanks may allow exporters, inter alia, to extinguish the excess packing\ncredit by export bills drawn in respect of by-product like cashew shell oil,\netc.\n(b) Where partial domestic sale is involved\nHowever, in respect of export of agro-based products like tobacco, pepper,\ncardamom, cashew nuts, etc., the exporter has necessarily to purchase a\nsomewhat larger quantity of the raw agricultural produce and grade it into\nexportable and non-exportable varieties and only the former is exported.\nThe non-exportable balance is necessarily sold domestically. For the\npacking credit covering such non-exportable portion, banks are required to\ncharge commercial rate of interest applicable to the domestic advance from\nthe date of advance of packing credit and that portion of the packing credit\nwould not be eligible for any refinance from RBI.\n(c) Export of deoiled/ defatted cakes\nBanks are permitted to grant packing credit advance to exporters of HPS\nground nut and deoiled/ defatted cakes to the extent of the value of raw\nmaterials required even though the value thereof exceeds the value of the\nexport order. The advance in excess of the export order is required to be\nadjusted either in cash or by sale of residual by-product oil within a period\nnot exceeding 30 days from the date of advance to be eligible for\nconcessional rate of interest.\n(iii) Banks have, however, operational flexibility  to extend the following relaxations\nto their exporter clients who have a good track  record :\n(a) Repayment/liquidation of packing credit with proceeds of export documents\nwill continue; however, this could be with export documents relating to any\nother order covering the same or any other commodity exported by the\nexporter . While allowing substitution of contract in this way, banks should\nensure that it is commercially necessary and unavoidable. Banks should also\nsatisfy about the valid reasons as to why packing credit extended for shipment\nof a particular commodity cannot be liquidated in the normal method. As far as\npossible, the substitution of contract should be allowed if the exporter maintains\naccount with the same bank or it has the approval of the members of the\nconsortium, if any.\n(b) The existing packing credit may also be marked-off with proceeds of export\ndocuments against which no packing credit has been drawn by the exporter.\nHowever, it is possible that the exporter might avail of EPC with one bank andsubmit the documents to another bank. In view of this possibility, banks may\nextend such facility after ensuring that the exporter has not availed of packing\ncredit from another bank against the documents submitted.\n(c) These relaxations should not be extended  to transactions of\nsister/associate/group concerns.\n1.1.5 'Running Account' Facility\n(i) As stated above, pre-shipment credit to exporters is normally provided on\nlodgement of L/Cs or firm export orders. It is observed that the availability of raw\nmaterials is seasonal in some cases. In some other cases, the time taken for\nmanufacture and shipment of goods is more than the delivery schedule as per export\ncontracts. In many cases, the exporters have to procure raw material, manufacture the\nexport product and keep the same ready for shipment, in anticipation of receipt of\nletters of credit/firm export orders from the overseas buyers. Having regard to\ndifficulties being faced by the exporters in availing of adequate pre-shipment credit in\nsuch cases, banks have been authorised  to extend Pre-shipment Credit \u2018Running\nAccount\u2019 facility in respect of any commodity , without insisting on prior lodgement\nof letters of credit/firm export orders, depending on the bank\u2019s judgement regarding the\nneed to extend such a facility and subject to the following conditions:\n(a) Banks may extend the \u2018Running Account\u2019 facility only to those exporters\nwhose track record  has been good  as also Export Oriented Units ( EOUs)/Units\nin Free Trade Zones/ Export Processing Zones ( EPZs) and Special Economic\nZones ( SEZs).\n(b) In all cases where Pre-shipment Credit \u2018Running Account\u2019 facility has been\nextended, letters of credit/firm orders should be produced within a reasonable\nperiod of time to be decided by the banks.\n(c) Banks should mark off individual export bills, as and when they are received\nfor negotiation/collection, against the earliest outstanding pre-shipment credit\non 'First In First Out' (FIFO) basis. Needless to add that, while marking off the\npre-shipment credit in the manner indicated above, banks should ensure that\nconcessive credit available in respect of individual pre-shipment credit does not\ngo beyond the period of sanction or 360 days from the date of advance,\nwhichever is earlier.\n(d) Packing credit can also be marked-off with proceeds of export documents\nagainst which no packing credit has been drawn by the exporter.\n(ii) If it is noticed that the exporter is found to be abusing the facility, the facility\nshould be withdrawn forthwith.\n(iii) In cases where exporters have not complied with the terms and conditions, the\nadvance will attract commercial lending rate ab initio . In such cases, banks will be\nrequired to pay higher rate of interest on the portion of refinance availed of by them\nfrom the RBI in respect of the relative pre-shipment credit. All such cases should be\nreported to the Monetary Policy Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office,Mumbai 400 001 which will decide the rate of interest to be charged on the refinance\namount.\n(iv) Running account facility should not be granted to sub-suppliers .\n1.1.6 Interest on Packing Credit\nInterest rate structure and instructions in regard thereto are detailed in paragraph 5.\n1.1.7 Export Credit against Proceeds of Cheques, Drafts, etc. Representing Advance Payment\nfor Exports\n(i) Where exporters receive direct remittances from abroad by means of cheques ,\ndrafts, etc. in payment for exports, banks may grant export credit at cencessive  intreest\nrate to exporters of good track record till the realisation  of proceeds of the cheque ,\ndraft etc. received from abroad, after satisfying themselves that it is against an export\norder, is as per trade practices in respect of the goods in question and is an approved\nmethod of realisation  of export proceeds as per extant rules.\n(ii) If, pending compliance with the above conditions, an exporter has been granted\naccommodation at normal commercial interest rate, banks may give effect to\nconcessive export credit rate retrospectively once the aforesaid conditions have been\ncomplied with and refund the difference to the exporter.\n1.2 Rupee Pre-shipment Credit to Specific Sectors/Segments\n1.2.1 Rupee Export Packing Credit to Manufacturer Suppliers for Exports Routed\nthrough STC/MMTC /Other Export Houses, Agencies, etc.\n(i) Banks may grant export packing credit to manufacturer suppliers who do not\nhave export orders/letters of credit in their own name, and goods are exported\nthrough the State Trading Corporation/Minerals and Metal Trading Corporation\nor other export houses, agencies, etc.\n(ii) Such advances will be eligible for refinance, provided the following\nrequirements are complied with apart from the usual stipulations:\n(a) Banks should obtain from the export house a letter setting out the\ndetails of the export order and the portion thereof to be executed by the\nsupplier and also certifying that the export house has not obtained and will\nnot ask for packing credit in respect of such portion of the order as is to be\nexecuted by the supplier.\n(b) Banks should, after mutual consultations and taking into account the\nexport requirements of the two parties, apportion between the two i.e. the\nExport House and the Supplier, the period of packing credit for which the\nconcessionary rate of interest is to be charged. The concessionary rates of\ninterest on the pre-shipment credit will be available upto the stipulated\nperiods in respect of the export house/agency and the supplier put\ntogether.\n(c) The export house should open inland L/Cs in favour of the suppliergiving relevant particulars of the export L/Cs or orders and the\noutstandings in the packing credit account should be extinguished by\nnegotiation of bills under such inland L/Cs. If it is inconvenient for the\nexport house to open such inland L/Cs in favour of the supplier, the latter\nshould draw bills on the export house in respect of the goods supplied for\nexport and adjust packing credit advances from the proceeds of such bills.\nIn case the bills drawn under such arrangement are not accompanied by\nbills of lading or other export documents, the bank should obtain through\nthe supplier a certificate from the export house at the end of every quarter\nthat the goods supplied under this arrangement have in fact been exported.\nThe certificate should give particulars of the relative bills such as date,\namount and the name of the bank through which the bills have been\nnegotiated.\n(d) Banks should obtain an undertaking from the supplier that the advance\npayment, if any, received from the export house against the export order\nwould be credited to the packing credit account.\n1.2.2 Rupee Export Packing Credit to Sub-Suppliers\n(i) Packing credit can be shared between an Export Order Holder ( EOH) and sub-\nsupplier of raw materials, components, etc. of the exported goods as in the case of\nEOH and manufacturer suppliers, subject to the following:\n(a) Running Account facility is not contemplated under the scheme. The\nscheme will cover the L/C or export order received in favour of Export\nHouses/Trading Houses/Star Trading Houses, etc. or manufacturer exporters only.\nThe scheme should be made available to the exporters with good track record.\n(b) Bankers to an EOH will open an inland L/C specifying the goods to be\nsupplied by the sub-supplier to the EOH against the export order or L/C received\nby him as a part of the export transaction. On the basis of such a L/C, the sub-\nsupplier's banker will grant EPC as working capital to enable the sub-supplier to\nmanufacture the components required for the goods to be exported. On supplying\nthe goods, the L/C opening bank will pay to the sub-supplier's banker against the\ninland documents received on the basis of inland L/C. Such payments will\nthereafter become the EPC of the EOH.\n(c) It is upto the EOH to open any number of L/Cs for the various components\nrequired with the approval of his banker/leader of consortium of banks within the\noverall value limit of the order or L/C received by him. Taking into account the\noperational convenience, it is for the L/C opening bank to fix the minimum\namount for opening such L/Cs. The total period of packing credit availed by the\nsub-supplier(s), individually or severally and the EOH should be within normal\ncycle of production required for the exported goods. Normally, the total period\nwill be computed from the date of first drawal of packing credit by any one of the\nsub-suppliers to the date of submission of export documents by EOH.\n(d) The EOH will be responsible for exporting the goods as per export order or\noverseas L/C and any delay in the process will subject him to the penal provisions\nissued from time to time. Once the sub-supplier makes available the goods as perinland L/C terms to the EOH, his obligation of performance under the scheme will\nbe treated as complied with and the penal provisions will not be applicable to him\nfor delay by EOH, if any.\n(e) The scheme is an additional window besides the existing system of sharing of\npacking credit between EOH and manufacturer in respect of exported goods as\ndetailed in paragraph 1.2.1 above. The scheme will cover only the first stage of\nproduction cycle . For example , a manufacturer exporter will be allowed to open\ndomestic L/C in favour of his immediate suppliers of components etc. that are\nrequired for manufacture of exportable goods. The scheme will not be extended to\ncover suppliers of raw materials/components, etc. to such immediate suppliers. In\ncase the EOH is merely a trading house, the facility will be available commencing\nfrom the manufacturer to whom the order has been passed on by the Trading\nHouse.\n(f) EOUs/ EPZ/ SEZ units supplying goods to another EOU/ EPZ/ SEZ unit for\nexport purposes are also eligible for rupee pre-shipment export credit under this\nscheme. However, the supplier EOU/ EPZ/ SEZ unit will not be eligible for any\npost-shipment facility as the scheme does not cover sale of goods on credit terms.\n(g) The scheme does not envisage any change in the total quantum of advance or\nperiod. Accordingly, the credit extended under the system will be treated as\nexport credit from the date of advance to the sub-supplier to the date of\nliquidation by EOH  under the inland export L/C system and upto the date of\nliquidation of packing credit by shipment of goods by EOH  and will be eligible\nfor refinance from RBI by the respective banks for the appropriate periods. It has\nto be ensured that no double financing of the same leg of the transaction is\ninvolved.\n(h) Banks may approach the ECGC for availing suitable cover in respect of such\nadvances.\n(i) The scheme does not envisage extending credit by a sub-supplier to the\nEOH/manufacturer and thus, the payment to sub-suppliers has to be made against\nsubmission of documents by L/C opening bank treating the payment as EPC of\nthe EOH.\n1.2.3 Rupee Pre-shipment Credit to Construction Contractors\n(i) The packing credit advances to the construction contractors to meet their initial\nworking capital requirements for execution of contracts abroad may be made on the\nbasis of a firm contract secured from abroad, in a separate account, on an undertaking\nobtained from them that the finance is required by them for incurring preliminary\nexpenses in connection with the execution of the contract e.g., for transporting the\nnecessary technical staff and purchase of consumable articles for the purpose of\nexecuting the contract abroad, etc..\n(ii) The advances should be adjusted within 180 days of the date of advance by\nnegotiation of bills relating to the contract or by remittances received from abroad in\nrespect of the contract executed abroad. To the extent the outstandings in the account\nare not adjusted in the stipulated manner, banks may charge normal rate of interest on\nsuch advance.(iii) The exporters undertaking project export contracts including export of services\nmay comply with the guidelines/instructions issued by Reserve Bank of India,\nExchange Control Department, Central Office, Mumbai from time to time.\n1.2.4 Export of Consultancy Services\n(i) Some of the Indian consultancy firms have taken up export of consultancy services\nin connection with the setting up of industrial and other projects in foreign countries.\nWhere such consultancy services form part of turnkey projects or joint ventures set up\nabroad, banks are considering suitable credit facilities at the pre-shipment and post-\nshipment stages. The exporters may need financial assistance from banks even in cases\nwhere consultancy services alone are exported, particularly, if no advance payments\nare received.\n(ii) Banks may consider granting suitable pre-shipment credit facilities against\nconsultancy  agreements to consultancy  firms for meeting the expenses of the technical\nand other staff employed for the project and purchase of any materials required for the\npurpose as well as for export of computer software, both standard and custom built\nsoftware programs, subject to the usual conditions of packing credit scheme.\n(iii) While deciding the pre-shipment facilities, advance payments received against the\ncontract must be taken into account.\n(iv) Banks may consider issuing suitable guarantees to exporters of consultancy\nservices of high value with large advance payment, taking into account the competence\nof the firm to undertake the assignment in question and other related aspects.\n1.2.5 Pre-shipment Credit to Floriculture, Grapes and Other Agro-based Products\n(i) In the case of floriculture, pre-shipment credit is allowed to be extended by banks\nfor purchase of cut-flowers, etc. and all post-harvest expenses incurred for making\nshipment.\n(ii) However, with a view to promoting exports of floriculture, grapes and other agro-\nbased products, banks are allowed to extend concessional  credit for working capital\npurposes in respect of export-related activities of all agro-based products including\npurchase of fertilisers , pesticides and other inputs for growing of flowers, grapes, etc.,\nprovided banks are in a position to clearly identify such activities as export-related and\nsatisfy themselves of the export potential thereof, and the activities are not covered by\ndirect/indirect finance schemes of NABARD  or any other agency, subject to the\nnormal terms & conditions relating to packing credit such as period, quantum,\nliquidation, etc.\n(iii) Export credit should not be extended for investments, such as, import of foreign\ntechnology, equipment, land development, etc. or any other item which cannot be\nregarded as working capital.\n2. POST-SHIPMENT EXPORT CREDIT\n2.1 'Post-shipment Credit' means any loan or advance granted or any other credit provided by abank to an exporter of goods from India from the date of extending credit after shipment of\ngoods to the date of realisation  of export proceeds and includes any loan or advance granted to\nan exporter, in consideration of, or on the security of any duty drawback allowed by the\nGovernment from time to time.\n2.2 Post-shipment advance can mainly take the form of -\n(i) Export bills purchased/discounted/negotiated.\n(ii) Advances against bills for collection.\n(iii) Advances against duty drawback receivcable from Government.\n2.3 Post-shipment credit is to be liquidated by the proceeds of export bills received from abroad\nin respect of goods exported.\n2.4 Rupee Post-shipment Export Credit\n2.4.1 Period\n(i) In the case of demand bills , the period of advance shall be the Normal Transit\nPeriod  (NTP)  as specified by FEDAI.\n(ii) In case of usance bills , credit can be granted for a maximum duration of 180 days\nfrom date of shipment inclusive of Normal Transit Period ( NTP) and grace period, if any.\nHowever, banks should closely monitor the need for extending post-shipment credit upto\nthe permissible period of 180 days and they should influence the exporters to realise the\nexport proceeds within a shorter period.\n(iii) 'Normal transit period'  means the average period normally involved from the date\nof negotiation/purchase/discount till the receipt of bill proceeds in the Nostro account of\nthe bank concerned, as prescribed by FEDAI from time to time. It is not to be confused\nwith the time taken for the arrival of goods at overseas destination.\n(iv) An overdue bill  -\n(a) in the case of a demand bill, is a bill which is not paid before the expiry of the\nnormal transit period, and\n(b) in the case of a usance bill, is a bill which is not paid on the due date.\n2.4.2 Interest Rate Structure\nInterest rate structure on post-shipment credit and instructions in regard thereto are\ndetailed in paragraph 5.\n2.4.3 Advances against Undrawn Balances on Export Bills\nIn export of certain commodities where exporters are required to draw the bills on the\noverseas buyer upto 90 to 98 percent of the FOB value of the contract, the residuary\namount being ' undrawn balance' is payable by the overseas buyer after satisfying\nhimself about the quality/ quantity of goods. Payment of undrawn balance is contingent\nin nature. Banks may consider granting advances against undrawn balances at\nconcessional rate of interest based on their commercial judgement and the track record\nof the buyer. Such advances are, however, eligible for concessional  rate of interest for amaximum period of 90 days only to the extent these are repaid by actual remittances\nfrom abroad and provided such remittances are received within 180 days after the\nexpiry of NTP in the case of demand bills and due date in the case of usance  bills. For\nthe period beyond 90 days, the rate of interest specified for the category ' ECNOS' at\npost-shipment stage may be charged.\n2.4.4 Advances against Retention Money\n(i) In the case of turn-key projects/construction contracts, progressive payments are\nmade by the overseas employer in respect of services segment of the contract, retaining\na small percentage of the progressive payments as retention money which is payable\nafter expiry of the stipulated period from the date of the completion of the contract,\nsubject to obtention  of certificate(s) from the specified authority.\n(ii) Retention money may also be sometimes stipulated against the supplies portion in\nthe case of turn-key projects. It may likewise arise in the case of sub-contracts. The\npayment of retention money is contingent in nature as it is a defect liability.\n(iii) The following guidelines should be followed in regard to grant of advances against\nretention money:\n(a) No advances may be granted against retention money relating to services\nportion  of the contract.\n(b) Exporters may be advised to arrange, as far as possible, provision of suitable\nguarantees, instead of retention money.\n(c) Banks may consider, on a selective basis, granting of advances against\nretention money relating to the supplies portion  of the contract taking into\naccount, among others, the size of the retention money accumulated, its impact\non the liquid funds position of the exporter and the past performance regarding\nthe timely receipt of retention money.\n(d) The payment of retention money may be secured by L/C or Bank Guarantee\nwhere possible.\n(e) Where the retention money is payable within a period of one year from the\ndate of shipment, according to the terms of the contract, banks should charge\nprescribed concessive rate of interest upto a maximum period of 90 days. The\nrate of interest prescribed for the category ' ECNOS' at post-shipment stage may\nbe charged for the period beyond 90 days.\n(f) Where the retention money is payable after a period of one year from the\ndate of shipment, according to the terms of the contract and the corresponding\nadvance is extended for a period exceeding one year, it will be treated as post-\nshipment credit given on deferred payment terms exceeding one year, and the\nrate of interest for that category will apply.\n(g) Advances against retention money will be eligible for concessional  rate of\ninterest only to the extent the advances are actually repaid by remittances\nreceived from abroad relating to the retention money and provided such\npayments are received within 180 days from the due date of payment of the\nretention money, according to the terms of the contract.2.4.5 Export on Consignment Basis\n(i) General\n(a) Export on consignment basis lends scope for a lot of misuse in the matter of\nrepatriation of export proceeds.\n(b) Therefore, export on consignment basis should be at par with exports on\noutright sale basis on cash terms in matters regarding the rate of interest to be\ncharged by banks on post-shipment credit. Thus, in the case of exports on\nconsignment basis, even if extension in the period beyond 180 days is granted\nby the Exchange Control Department for repatriation of export proceeds, banks\nwill charge appropriate concessive rate of interest only upto the notional due\ndate (depending upon the tenor of the bills), subject to a maximum of 180 days.\n(ii) Export of precious and semi-precious stones\nPrecious and semi-precious stones, etc. are exported mostly on consignment\nbasis and the exporters are not in a position to liquidate pre-shipment credit\naccount with remittances received from abroad within a period of 180 days from\nthe date of advance. Banks may, therefore, adjust packing credit advances in the\ncase of consignment exports, as soon as export takes place, by transfer of the\noutstanding balance to a special (post-shipment) account which in turn, should\nbe adjusted as soon as the relative proceeds are received from abroad but not\nlater than 180 days from the date of export or such extended period as may be\npermitted by Exchange Control Department, Reserve Bank of India. Balance in\nthe special (post-shipment) account will not be eligible for refinance from RBI.\n(iii) Consignment exports to CIS and East European Countries\n(a) RBI ( ECD) is allowing in deserving cases, on application by individual\nexporters with satisfactory track record, a longer period of upto 12 months for\nrealisation of proceeds of export on consignment basis in convertible currencies\nto CIS (former USSR) and East European Countries. Banks may extend post-\nshipment credit to such exporters for a longer period ab initio . Accordingly, the\ninterest rate applicable will be as follows:\nPeriod of Post-shipment Credit Rate of Interest\nUpto 90 days from the date of\nadvanceThe rate applicable for usance\nbills for period upto 90 days\nBeyond 90 days and upto 12\nmonths from the date of shipmentThe rate applicable for usance\nbills beyond 90 days and upto 6\nmonths from the date of\nshipment\n(b) It is expected that sales proceeds of goods exported on consignment basis to\nthe above countries would be realised within the permitted period of upto 12\nmonths and post-shipment credit liquidated. In case the sale proceeds are not\nrealised within the said period, the higher rate of interest as applicable for bills\nrealised beyond 6 months from the date of shipment i.e. ECNOS - Post-shipment will apply for the entire period beyond 6 months.\n(c) Refinance to banks against export credit would, however, be available from\nRBI upto a period of 180 days only each at pre-shipment and post-shipment\nstages.\n(iv) Consignment exports to Russian Federation against repayment of State Credit\nin rupees\n(a) RBI ( ECD ) is allowing on application, Export Houses/ Trading Houses/Star\nTrading Houses/Super Star Trading Houses with satisfactory track record, a\nlonger period of upto 360 days from the date of shipment for realisation  of\nproceeds of exports of permitted goods as announced by them from time to time\nto the Russian Federation on consignment basis against repayment of State\nCredits in rupees. For the procedure to be followed, reference may be made to\nAD(GP Series) Circular No. 5 dated May 31, 1999 and subsequent instructions,\nif any, issued in this regard by Exchange Control Department, Reserve Bank of\nIndia. Banks may extend post-shipment credit to such exporters for a longer\nperiod ab initio . Accordingly, the interest rate applicable will be as follows:\nPeriod of Post-shipment Credit Rate of Interest\nUpto 90 days from the date of\nadvanceThe rate applicable for usance\nbills for period upto 90 days\nBeyond 90 days and upto360 days\nfrom the date of shipmentThe rate applicable for usance\nbills beyond 90 days and upto 6\nmonths from the date of\nshipment\n(b) In case, sale proceeds are not realised within the said period, the higher rate\nof interest as applicable for bills realised beyond 6 months from the date of\nshipment will apply for the entire period beyond 6 months.\n(c) The refinance to banks against export credit would, however, be available\nfrom RBI upto a period of 180 days only each at pre and post shipment stages.\n2.4.6 Exports through the Warehouse-cum-Display Centres Abroad\n(i) Some Indian organisations/exporters are permitted by RBI ( ECD) to establish\nwarehouses abroad for storing the goods exported from India to enable them to arrange\noff-the-shelf sales for achieving greater penetration in the overseas markets. Since\nexports to these warehouses are in anticipation of orders from the buyers overseas, the\nprescribed period of realisation of proceeds of such export has been fixed upto fifteen\nmonths from the date of shipment as against the normal period of six months in other\ncases.\n(ii) In view of longer period of realisation permitted, ab initio , the interest rates on the\npost-shipment credit in rupee against exports through approved warehouses are as\nfollows:\nPeriod of Post-shipment Credit Rate of InterestUpto 90 days from the date of\nadvanceThe rate applicable for usance bills\nfor period upto90 days\nBeyond 90 days and upto 15 months\nfrom the date of shipmentThe rate applicable for usance bills\nbeyond 90 days and upto 6 months\nfrom the date of shipment\n(iii) In case sale proceeds are not realised within the said period, the higher rate of\ninterest as applicable for bills realised beyond 6 months from the date of shipment i.e.\nECNOS - Post-shipment will apply for the entire period beyond 6 months.\n(iv) Refinance to the bank against export credit would be available from RBI upto a\nperiod of 180 days only each at pre-shipment and post-shipment stages.\n2.4.7 Export of Goods for Exhibition and Sale\nBanks may provide finance to exporters against goods sent for exhibition and sale abroad\nin the normal course in the first instance, and after the sale is completed, allow the benefit\nof the concessive rate of interest on such advances, both at the pre-shipment stage and at\nthe post-shipment stage, upto the stipulated periods, by way of a rebate. Such advances\nshould be given in separate accounts.\n2.4.8 Post-shipment Credit on Deferred Payment Terms\nBanks may grant post-shipment credit on deferred payment terms for a period exceeding\none year, in respect of export of capital and producer goods as specified by RBI ( ECD)\nfrom time to time.\n2.5 Post-shipment Advances against Duty Drawback Entitlements\n2.5.1 Banks may grant post-shipment advances to exporters against their duty drawback\nentitlements as provisionally certified by Customs Authorities pending final sanction and\npayment.\n2.5.2 The advance against duty drawback receivables can also be made available to exporters\nagainst export promotion copy of the shipping bill containing the EGM Number issued by the\nCustoms Department. Where necessary, the financing bank may have its lien noted with the\ndesignated bank and arrangements may be made with the designated bank to transfer funds to the\nfinancing bank as and when duty drawback is credited by the Customs.\n2.5.3 These advances granted against duty drawback entitlements would be eligible for\nconcessional rate of interest and refinance from RBI upto a maximum period of 90 days from the\ndate of advance.\n2.6 ECGC Whole Turnover Post-shipment Guarantee Scheme\n2.6.1 The Whole Turnover Post-shipment Guarantee Scheme of the Export Credit Guarantee\nCorporation Ltd. ( ECGC) provides protection to banks against non-payment of post-shipment\ncredit by exporters. Banks may, in the interest of export promotion, consider opting for the\nWhole Turnover Post-shipment Policy. The salient features of the scheme may be obtained from\nECGC.\n2.6.2 As the post-shipment guarantee is mainly intended to benefit the banks, the cost of\npremium in respect of the Whole Turnover Post-shipment Guarantee taken out by banks may beabsorbed by the banks and not passed on to the exporters.\n2.6.3 Where the risks are covered by the ECGC, banks should not slacken their efforts towards\nrealisation of their dues against long outstanding export bills.\n3. DEEMED EXPORTS - CONCESSIVE RUPEE EXPORT CREDIT\n3.1 Banks are permitted to extend rupee pre-shipment and post-supply rupee export credit at\nconcessional  rate of interest to parties against orders for supplies in respect of projects\naided/financed by bilateral or multilateral agencies/funds (including World Bank, IBRD , IDA),\nas notified from time to time by Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance under the\nChapter \"Deemed Exports\" in Exim  Policy, which are eligible for grant of normal export benefits\nby Government of India.\n3.2 Advances provided should be adjusted from free foreign exchange representing payments for\nthe supplies of goods to these agencies.\n3.3 Banks may also extend rupee\n(i) pre-shipment credit, and\n(ii) post-supply credit (for a maximum period of 30 days or upto the actual date of\npayment by the receiver of goods, whichever is earlier).\nto other categories of supply of goods specified as 'Deemed Exports' under the same Chapter of\nExim Policy from time to time.\n3.4 The post-supply advances would be treated as overdue after the period of 30 days. In cases\nwhere such overdue credits are liquidated within a period of 180 days from the notional due date\n(i.e. before 210 days from the date of advance), the banks are required to charge, for such\nextended period, interest prescribed for the category ' ECNOS' at post-shipment stage. If the bills\nare not paid within the aforesaid period of 210 days, banks should charge from the date of\nadvance, the rate prescribed for ' ECNOS' - Post-shipment.\n3.5 Banks would be eligible for refinance from RBI for such rupee export credits extended both\nat pre-shipment and post-supply stages.\n4. SPECIAL FINANCIAL PACKAGE FOR LARGE VALUE EXPORTS -RUPEE\nCREDIT INTEREST RATES\n4.1 A special financial package has been drawn in consultation with the Government of India, for\nlarge value exports of select products, which are internationally competitive and have high value\naddition. The details of the financial package are furnished below:\n(i) The products eligible for export under special financial package are:\n(a) pharmaceuticals (including drugs, fine chemicals),(b) agro-chemicals (including inorganic and organic chemicals),\n(c) transport equipment (including commercial vehicles, two and three wheelers,\ntractors, railway wagons, locomotives),\n(d) cement (including glass, glassware, ceramics and refractories),\n(e) iron and steel (including iron & steel bars/rods and primary and semi-finished\niron & steel),\n(f) electrical machinery (including transmission line towers,          switch gear,\ntransformers).\n(g) leather and leather goods.\n(h) textiles\n(ii) Manufacturer exporters of above products with export contracts of Rs. 100 crore and\nabove in value terms in one year will be eligible for the special financial package.\n(iii) Validity period of the financial package will be from October 1, 2001 to September\n30, 2002.\n(iv) Exporters covered under the special financial package will be extended credit at\nconcessional rate of interest for an extended period upto 365 days at pre-shipment as well\nas post-shipment stages as against the maximum periods of 270 days and 180 days\nrespectively applicable for normal export credits. Further, the rate of interest of export\ncredit for period beyond 270 days and upto 365 days at pre-shipment stage will be the\nsame as for normal pre-shipment credit for period beyond 180 days and upto 270 days.\nSimilarly, post-shipment credit will be extended for periods beyond 180 days and upto\n365 days at the same rate of interest as applicable for normal post-shipment credit for the\nperiod beyond 90 days and upto 180 days.\n4.2 A monthly statement of credit extended at both pre and post-shipment stages under the above\nfinancial package may be forwarded to RBI, IECD.\n5. INTEREST ON EXPORT CREDIT\n5.1 General\n5.1.1 A ceiling rate has been prescribed for rupee export credit linked to Prime Lending Rates\n(PLRs) of individual banks available to their domestic borrowers. Banks have, therefore,\nfreedom to decide the actual rates to be charged within the specified ceilings. Further, the ceiling\ninterest rates for different time buckets under any category of export credit should be on the basis\nof the PLR relevant for the entire tenor of export credit.\n5.2 Interest Rate on Rupee Export Credit\n5.2.1 Interest Rate StructureAt present, the interest rate structure for rupee export credit applicable for the period\nfrom 26.09.2001 to 31.03.2002 is as under:\nType of Credit Interest Rate @\n1.Pre-shipment Credit\n(from the date of advance)\n(i)(a) Upto 180 days Not exceeding PLR\nminus 2.5 percentage points\n(b) Beyond 180 days and upto Not exceeding PLR plus\n270 days 0.5 percentage points\n(ii)Against incentives receivable Not exceeding PLR\nfrom Government (covered by minus 2.5 percentage points\nECGC Guarantee) upto 90 days\n2.Post-shipment Credit\n(from the date of advance)\n(i)On demand bills for transit Not exceeding PLR\nperiod (as specified by FEDAI) minus 2.5 percentage points\n(ii)Against usance bills^ (for total\nperiod comprising usance\nperiod of export bills, transit\nperiod as specified by FEDAI,\nand grace period, wherever\napplicable) +\n(a) Upto 90 days Not exceeding PLR\nminus 2.5 percentage points\n(b) Beyond 90 days and upto 6 Not exceeding PLR plus\nmonths from the date of shipment 0.5 percentage points\n(iii)Against incentives receivable Not exceeding PLR\nfrom Govt. (covered by ECGC minus 2.5 percentage points\nGuarantee) upto 90 days\n(iv)Against undrawn balances - do -\n(upto 90 days)\n(v)Against retention money (for - do -\nsupplies portion only) payablewithin one year from the date\nof shipment ( upto 90 days)\n3.Deferred Credit\n(i)Deferred credit for the period Free *\nbeyond 180 days\n4.Export Credit Not Otherwise\nSpecified ( ECNOS)\n(i)Pre-shipment credit Free*\n(ii)Post-shipment credit Free*\n^upto notional due date or actual due date, whichever is earlier.\n+Interest rate for credit beyond 90 days from the date of advance has to\nbe charged slab-wise (1-90 days and 91-180 days).\n@Since these are ceiling rates, banks would be free to charge any rate\nbelow the ceiling rates.\n*Banks are free to decide the rate of interest, keeping in view the PLR\nand spread guidelines.\n5.2.2 Application of Interest Rates\nThe revision in interest rates made from time to time is made applicable to fresh\nadvances as also  to the existing advances for the remaining period of credit.\n5.2.3 Interest on Pre-shipment Credit\n(i) Banks should charge interest on pre-shipment credit\n? upto 180 days, and\n? for the period beyond 180 days, but upto 270 days,\nat the rates to be decided by the bank within the ceiling rate arrived at on the basis of\nPLR relevant for the entire tenor of the export credit under the category.\nThe period of credit is to be reckoned from the date of advance.\n(ii) If pre-shipment advances are not liquidated from proceeds of bills on purchase,\ndiscount, etc. on submission of export documents within 360 days from the date of\nadvance, the advances will cease to qualify for concessive rate of interest ab initio .\n(iii) In cases where packing credit is not extended beyond the original period of\nsanction and exports take place after the expiry of sanctioned period but within a\nperiod of 360 days from the date of advance, exporter would be eligible for\nconcessional credit only upto the sanctioned period. For the balance period, interest\nrate prescribed for ECNOS at pre-shipment stage will apply. Further, the reasons for\nnon-extension of the period need to be advised by banks to the exporter.\n(iv) In cases  where exports do not take place within 360 days from the date of pre-shipment advance, such credits will be termed as \u2018Export Credit Not Otherwise\nSpecified\u2019 ( ECNOS) and banks may charge interest rate prescribed for \u2018 ECNOS - pre-\nshipment\u2019 from the very first day of the advance.\n(v) If exports do not materialise at all, banks should charge on relative packing credit\ndomestic lending rate plus penal rate of interest, if any, to be decided by the banks on\nthe basis of a transparent policy approved by their Board.\n5.2.4 Interest on Post-shipment Credit\n(i) Early payment of export bills\n(a) In the case of advances against demand bills, if the bills are realised before\nthe expiry of the normal transit period ( NTP), interest at the concessive rate\nshall be charged from the date of advance till the date of realisation  of such\nbills. The date of realisation of demand bills for this purpose would be the date\non which the proceeds get credited to the banks' Nostro accounts.\n(b) In the case of advance/credit against usance  export bills, interest at\nconcessive rate may be charged only upto the notional/actual due date or the\ndate on which export proceeds get credited to the bank\u2019s Nostro  account abroad,\nwhichever is earlier, irrespective of the date of credit to the borrower's/exporter's\naccount in India. In cases where the correct due date can be established\nbefore/immediately after availment  of credit due to acceptance by overseas\nbuyer or otherwise, concessive interest can be applied only upto the actual due\ndate, irrespective of whatever may be the notional due date arrived at, provided\nthe actual due date falls before the notional due date.\n(c) Where interest for the entire NTP in the case of demand bills or upto\nnotional/actual due date in the case of usance  bills as stated at (b) above, has\nbeen collected at the time of negotiation/purchase/discount of bills, the excess\ninterest collected for the period from the date of realisation  to the last date of\nNTP/notional due date/actual due date should be refunded to the borrowers.\n5.2.5 Overdue Export Bills\n(i) In case of export bills, the rate of interest decided by the bank within the ceiling rate\nstipulated by RBI  will apply upto the due date of the bill ( upto NTP in case of demand\nbill and specified period in case of usance bills).\n(ii) For the period beyond the due date viz. for the overdue period, the rate fixed for\n\u2018Export Credit not otherwise specified\u2019 ( ECNOS)  at post-shipment stage  will\napply and no penal interest should be charged additionally.\n(iii) Banks should ensure that the additional interest by way of overdue interest\n(ECNOS) should not be levied where there has been no advance (pre or post shipment)\ntaken by the exporter.\n5.2.6 Interest on Post-shipment Credit  Adjusted from Rupee Resources\nBanks should adopt the following guidelines to ensure uniformity in charging intereston post-shipment advances which are not adjusted in an approved manner due to non-\naccrual of foreign exchange and advances have to be adjusted out of rupee funds either\nfrom exporters' own resources or from out of the funds received from the Export Credit\nGuarantee Corporation of India Ltd. ( ECGC ) in settlement of claims preferred on them\non account of the relevant export consignment:\n(a) In case of exports to certain countries, exporters are unable to realise export\nproceeds due to non-expatriation of the foreign exchange by the Governments/Central\nBanking Authorities of the countries concerned as a result of their balance of payment\nproblems even though payments have been made locally by the buyers. In these cases\nECGC offer cover to exporters for transfer delays. Where ECGC have admitted the\nclaims and paid the amount for transfer delay, banks may charge interest as applicable\nto \u2018ECNOS - Post-shipment\u2019 even if the post-shipment advance may be outstanding\nbeyond six months from the date of shipment. Such interest would be applicable on the\nfull amount of advance irrespective of the fact that the ECGC admit the claims to the\nextent of 90 percent/75 percent and the exporters have to bring the balance 10\npercent/25 percent  from their own rupee resources.\n(b) In all other cases of adjustments out of rupee resources, banks may charge\ncommercial lending rate or the rate for \u2018 ECNOS -Post- shipment\u2019, whichever is higher\nfor the entire duration of the post-shipment advance.\n(c) In a case where interest has been charged at commercial rate or ECNOS  as per (b)\nabove, if export proceeds are realised  in an approved manner subsequently, the bank\nmay refund to the borrower the excess amount representing difference between the\nquantum of interest already charged as in (b) above and interest that is chargeable\ntaking into account the said realisation  after ensuring the fact of such realisation  with\nsatisfactory evidence. While making adjustments of accounts as in (b) above it would\nbe better if the possibility of refund of excess interest is brought to the notice of the\nborrower.\n5.2.7 Change of Tenor of Bill\n(i) In terms of AD(GP Series) Circular No. 28 dated 30.12.1998 issued by RBI ( ECD),\nbanks have been permitted, on request from exporters, to allow change of tenor of bills\nin respect of bills drawn on the original buyer or the alternative buyer, provided the\nrevised due date of payment does not fall beyond six months from the date of shipment\nand the change of tenor takes place before the original due date of payment of  bill.\n(ii) In such cases where change of tenor has been allowed, it would be in order for\nbanks to extend the concessional rate of interest upto the revised notional due date,\nsubject to a maximum period of six months from the date of shipment.\nNote:\n(Ceilings rates of interest on credit extended to exporters as prescribed in the circular\nare lower than the maximum lending rates normally charged to other borrowers and\nare, therefore, indicated as concessive in this sense).\nList of Circulars consolidated by the Master CircularNo. Circular No. Date Subject\n1.

It has been further decided that the Board of each bank\nshould formulate detailed guidelines for lending for margin trading, subject to the following\nparameters:\n(i) The finance extended for margin trading should be within the overall ceiling of 5%\nprescribed for exposure to capital market,\n(ii) A  minimum margin of 40 per cent should be maintained on the funds lent for margin\ntrading.\n(iii) The shares purchased with margin trading should be in dematerialised mode, under\npledge to the lending bank.  The bank should put in place an appropriate system for\nmonitoring and maintaining the margin of  40% on a regular basis.\n(iv) The Bank\u2019s Board should prescribe necessary safeguards to ensure that no \u201cnexus\u201d\ndevelops between inter-connected stock broking entities / stockbrokers and the bank\nin respect of margin trading.  Margin trading should be spread out by a bank among a\nreasonable number of stockbrokers and stock broking  entities.\n3. The Audit Committee of the Board should monitor periodically the bank\u2019s exposure by way of\nfinancing for margin trading and ensure that the guidelines formulated by the bank\u2019s Board,\nsubject to the above parameters, are complied with. Banks should disclose the total finance\nextended for margin trading in the \u201cNotes on Account\u201d to their Balance Sheets.\n4. A copy of the policy on financing of margin trading approved by the bank\u2019s Board may be\nforwarded to the RBI, in due course.2\n5.  The earlier guidelines issued by the RBI on September 22, 2001 will remain in operation until\nfresh guidelines are issued by the bank\u2019s Board as per this circular.\n6.

Objective\nTo provide an institutional mechanism for ensuring uninterrupted flow of credit to farmers in\nrain-fed areas for production purposes in case of natural calamities. The proposed arrangement\nproviding longer cycle will help those farmers who are denied credit facilities once they lose a\ncrop on account of drought or any other natural calamity.\n2. Concept\nIn a \u2018cycle\u2019 of 3 to 5 years farmer get good crop yields in 1 or 2 years. Whereas in other years\ndue to reasons beyond the control of the farmer he is not able to service his debt obligations,\nsecure credit to meet fresh production needs. The financing bank may, therefore, adopt a \u2018credit\ncycle approach\u2019 and set an overall term credit limit for a period of 3 to 5 years with sub limits for\nindividual years, so that farmer's production requirement is fully met. The repayment schedule\nmay be dovetailed to the repayment capacity of the farmer, based on crop yield during the year\nand the resultant income stream of the farmers  in such a way that the entire principal amount is\nrepaid over the credit cycle of 3 to 5 years.\n3. Scheme\nThe banks will accordingly grant a term \u201ccredit\u201d limit of 5 years to farmers (as indicated in para\n2 above). For fixing the yearly requirement of sub-limit, the banks may take 150% of the scale of\nfinance so as to provide a cushion for other small consumption and uncertain needs. The yearly\nsub-limits may be disbursed to farmers well before the cropping season repayable after a period\nof 12 months (approx.) on a due date to be fixed by the bank for all farmers in the jurisdiction of\nthe branch. However, in the event of drought or poor harvest the recovery of the amount by the\nBanks shall be proportionate to the crop yield of the area determined by the branch manager in\nassociation with his Regional/Controlling Office on the basis of their assessment after visits to\nthe farmers' fields. Recovery of the balance amount due shall be deferred to the next year. The\nbalance so deferred and the fresh loans made to the farmers during the next year shall be\nrecovered keeping in view the crop yield levels as done in the previous year. This process of\nrecovery shall be followed during the entire five year \u201ccredit cycle\u201d mentioned above. When the\nyields are substantially higher in good and very good years, the entire outstanding is to beii) also grant fresh crop loan/s for the next season/s,\nsubject to the rescheduled dates of repayment not exceeding the 5 year period and also servicing\nthe interest by farmers on due dates.\n4. Application of prudential norms\nAs per present norms, NPA classification in respect of agricultural advances is applicable where\ninterest and/or instalment of principal remains overdue for two harvest seasons but for period not\nexceeding two half years. In the Cyclical Credit Scheme the rescheduling of the instalments of\nprincipal alone would not cause a standard asset to be classified in the sub-standard category\nprovided  interest is paid every year and the loan/credit facility is fully secured.\n5. Additional instructions\ni] If the loan is covered under crop insurance scheme and if a claim is received, the same has to\nbe adjusted first against the interest component so that in a failed crop year interest payment need\nnot be insisted upon from the farmer for the purpose of avoiding the account turning NPA .\nii] The scheme could be dovetailed to the existing Kisan Credit Card [ KCC] Scheme provided\nthe card is issued for a period of 3 to 5 years.\niii]  The margin and security norms will be as per extant guidelines of RBI.\niv]  Default in repayment under any other circumstances will render the account as NPA.\nv]  The terms of agreement should be accordingly prescribed.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/24293.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 07, 2001", "info": "Stapling of Note Packets \u2013 Removal\nReserve Bank of India\nCentral Office\nDepartment of Banking Operations and Development\nCentre - 1, World Trade Centre\nCuffe Parade, Colaba, Mumbai - 400 005\nNovember 7, 2001\nKartika 16, 1923(S)\nDBOD No. Dir.

The practice has come under criticism from various\nquarters. Apart from damaging notes, multiple stapling reduces life span of notes and renders it\ndifficult for customers to open note packets easily. Further, it enables unscrupulous persons to\ninsert half notes pasted on papers into note packets.\n2.  It is also observed that banks do not sort notes into re- issuables and non- issuables, and issue\nsoiled notes to public. Banks also continue to follow the practice of writing number of note\npieces in loose packets on watermark window of notes which disfigures watermark impression\nand renders it difficult for easy recognition.\n3.  It has been therefore decided  that hereinafter and with immediate effect :   \na. banks should do away with stapling of any note packet and instead secure note packets\nwith paper bands,\nb. banks should sort notes into re- issuables and non- issuables, and issue only clean  notes to\npublic.

As you are aware , with a view to bringing about an  element of discipline in the utilisation\nof bank credit by large borrowers and gaining better control over the flow of credit, RBI had\nintroduced a ' Loan System' for delivery of bank credit in April 1995. The Loan System has\nbeen extended in  phases to cover larger number of borrowers with the percentage of loan\ncomponent of the working capital being gradually enhanced.  Currently, the Loan System is\napplicable to borrowers enjoying working capital credit limits of Rs.10 crore and above from\nthe banking system, and the minimum level of loan component in respect of such borrowers\nhas been fixed at 80 per cent .\n3.  The 'Loan System\" was introduced to minimise the risks of cash and liquidity management\non the part of the banking system, caused by volatile movements in cash credit component of\nworking capital. In the current environment of short-term investment opportunites available to\nboth corporates and banks, RBI has reviewed the guidelines relating to the 'Loan System'.\nAccordingly, it has been decided that banks will henceforth have the freedom to change the\ncomposition of working capital by increasing the cash credit component beyond 20 per cent or\nto increase the 'Loan component' beyond 80 per cent as the case may be, for working capital\nlimits of Rs. 10 crore  and above, if they so desire. Banks are expected to  appropriately price\neach of the two components of working capital finance, taking into account the impact of such\ndecisions on their cash and liquidity management. The guidelines relating to the  'Loan\nSystem', as currently applicable are set out in the Annexure.\n4. Consequently, paragraph 13 B.I.6 of Chapter 13 in the Manual of Instructions may be\nreplaced with the revised guidelines.\nYours faithfully,\n(S.S.Gangopadhyay)\nChief General Manager\nEncls: as aboveAnnexure\nGuidelines on Loan System for Delivery of Bank Credit\n1.  Loan Component and Cash Credit Component\n(a) In the case of borrowers enjoying working capital credit limits of Rs.10 crore and\nabove from the banking system, loan component should normally be 80 per cent.\nBanks, however, have the freedom to change the composition of working capital by\nincreasing the cash credit component beyond 20 per cent or to increase the 'Loan\nComponent' beyond 80 per cent as the case may be, if they so desire. Banks are\nexpected to appropriately price each of the two components of working capital\nfinance, taking into account the impact of such decisions on their cash and liquidity\nmanagement.\n(b) In the case of borrowers enjoying working capital credit limit of less than Rs.10\ncrore, banks may persuade them to go in for the `Loan System' by offering an\nincentive in the form of lower rate of interest on the loan component, as compared\nto the cash credit component.  The actual percentage of `loan component' in these\ncases may be settled by the bank with its borrower clients.\n(c) In respect of certain business activities, which are cyclical and seasonal in nature or\nhave inherent volatility, the strict application of loan system may create difficulties\nfor the borrowers. Banks may, with the approval of their respective Boards, identify\nsuch business activities, which may be exempt from the loan system of delivery.\n2.  Ad hoc Credit Limit\nAs at  present, ad hoc/additional credit  for meeting temporary requirements can be considered\nby the financing bank only after the borrower has fully utilised/exhausted the existing limit.\n3.  Sharing of Working Capital Finance\nThe  ground rules for sharing of cash credit and loan components may be laid down by the\nconsortium, wherever formed, subject to guidelines on bifurcation as stated in paragraph (1)\nabove.  The level of individual bank's share shall continue to be governed by the norm for single\nborrower/group exposure.\n4.  Rate of Interest\nBanks are allowed  to prescribe Prime Lending Rates and spreads over Prime Lending Rates\nseparately for `loan component' and 'cash credit component'.\n5.  Period of  of LoanThe minimum period of the loan for working capital purposes may be fixed by banks in\nconsultation with borrowers.  Banks may decide to split the loan component according to the\nneed of the borrower with different maturity bases for each segment and allow roll over.\n6.  Security\nIn regard to security, sharing of charge, documentation, etc., banks may themselves decide on the\nrequirement, If necessary, in consultation with the other participant banks.\n7.  Export Credit\nThe bifurcation of the working capital limit into loan and cash credit components, as stated in\nparagraph (1) above, would be effected after excluding the export credit limits (pre-shipment and\npost-shipment).  Export credit limit would continue to be allowed in the form hitherto  granted.\n8.  Bills limit for inland sales may be fully carved out of the `loan' component' . Bills limit also\nincludes limits for purchase of third party  (outstation) cheques/bank drafts. Banks must satisfy\nthemselves that bills limit is not misultilised and in this connection, the instructions contained in\nCircular DBOD. No. BC.8/16.13.100/92-93 dated July 27, 1992 should be carefully noted and\ncomplied with.\n9.  Renewal/Rollover of Loan Component\nThe `loan component' may be renewed/rolled over at the request of the borrower.\n10.   Provision for Investing Short-term Surplus Funds of Borrower\nThe banks, at their discretion, may permit the borrowers to invest their short-term/temporary\nsurplus in short-term money market instruments like Commercial Paper ( CP). Certificates of\nDeposit (CD) and in Term Deposit with banks, etc.\n11.  Applicability\nThe loan system would be applicable to borrowal accounts classified as `standard' or `sub-\nstandard'.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/24126.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 22, 2001", "info": " \nUBD.No.DS.PCB.CIR.16/13.05. 00/2001-02                                    October 22, 2001 \nChief Executive Officers of  \nAll Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks \nDear Sir, \nBank finance against shares and debentures  \nPlease refer to our circular no.

Stance of Monetary Policy\nfor the Second Half of 2001-02; and III Monetary and Credit Policy consists of three parts: I. Mid-\nterm Review of Macroeconomic and Monetary . Financial Sector Reforms and Monetary Policy\nMeasures.\nI.  Mid-term Review of Macroeconomic and\nMonetary Developments in 2001-02\nDomestic Developments\n2. The annual Statement on monetary and credit policy, released on April 19, 2001\nprojected a GDP growth of 6.0 to 6.5 per cent for the year 2001-02.  This projection was based on\nthe assumptions of a reasonable monsoon, good performance of exports and a revival of the\nindustrial sector beginning second quarter of the year.  As per the latest information available\nfrom the India Meteorological Department, the behaviour of the South-West monsoon this year\nhas been better than last two years, with 30 out of 35 sub-divisions showing normal or excess\nrainfall.  According to the current estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture, kharif output this year is\nexpected to increase by 2.5 million tonnes to 105.6 million tonnes.  Assuming a normal North-\nEast monsoon, agricultural growth in 2001-02 is expected to be significantly higher than the\nprevious year.\n3.        While agricultural performance is encouraging, the position regarding revival of industrial\nsector and export growth in the first half of the current year is not favourable.  According to the\nlatest estimates released by the Central Statistical Organisation, growth rate of industrial\nproduction during April-August 2001 was lower at 2.2 per cent as against 5.6 per cent in the\ncorresponding period of the previous year.  The deceleration in growth was observed across the\nsectors.  Manufacturing sector recorded a much lower growth rate of 2.5 per cent as compared\nwith 6.1 per cent in the previous year.  While basic goods, intermediate goods and consumer\ndurables have shown lower growth during April-August 2001 as compared with the corresponding\nperiod of the previous year, capital goods sector continues to show a negative growth rate (- 8.0\nper cent as against 4.3 per cent) reflecting a sluggish investment demand.  The performance of\nthe infrastructure industries, a stimulant for industrial activity, also remained at a low key.  The\ncomposite index of six infrastructure industries, viz., electricity, coal, steel, cement, crude\npetroleum and refinery products registered a substantially lower growth of 1.2 per cent during\nApril-August 2001 as against 6.9 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.  While\ncement, electricity and petroleum refinery products recorded lower growth rates than those in the\ncorresponding period of the previous year, coal and crude petroleum showed negative growth\nrates.  Export growth has also been negative.  According to the latest information available,\nexports in US dollar terms during the period April-August 2001 declined by  2.3 per cent against a\ngrowth of 21.1 per cent in the corresponding period last year.\n4. Taking into account the positive developments regarding the likely rate of growth in\nagriculture during the current year on the one hand, and the unfavourable behaviour of industrial\nand export sectors on the other, on balance, the projection of 6.0 to 6.5 per cent growth rate for\nthe year 2001-02 now appears optimistic.\n5. In view of the global uncertainty, and the impact of global slowdown on exports  as well as\ndomestic growth, a firm projection of revised growth rate for the year as a whole is difficult.\nAccording to the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF)  projections, which may be revised\ndownward again, the global growth rate during the current year is expected to be of the order of\n2.6 per cent and almost all developing as well as industrialised countries are likely to show a2\nsubstantially lower growth than projected a few months ago.  Recent growth projections for the\nIndian economy made by the IMF, other international agencies as well as domestic research and\nmonitoring agencies have also ranged widely from 4.5 to over 6.0 per cent.  Balancing various\nfactors, and assuming no further serious disruption in the world economic environment, at this\nstage, a projection in the range of 5.0 to 6.0 per cent growth rate in the current year may be\nreasonable for the purpose of credit and monetary management.  India is likely to be one of the\nvery few countries in the world which would show a growth rate of this order in the current year.\n6. The relatively sombre outlook for industrial growth is reflected in the credit flow during the\nperiod April-October 5, 2001.  The expansion of bank credit and other flows to the commercial\nsector from the banking system remained sluggish due to subdued industrial growth and\ndepressed investment demand.  Scheduled commercial banks\u2019 credit increased by 6.1 per cent\n(Rs.31,104 crore) upto October 5, 2001 as against an increase of 9.7 per cent (Rs.42,211 crore)\nin the corresponding period of the previous year. Food credit increased by Rs.10,211 crore as\nagainst Rs.7,193 crore in the previous year reflecting higher procurement operations.  The\nincrease in non-food bank credit by 4.4 per cent (Rs.20,894 crore) was lower as against an\nincrease of 8.5 per cent (Rs.35,018 crore) in the corresponding period of the previous year.  In\nlate September and early October 2001, however, some pick-up in non-food bank credit is\ndiscernible.\n7. The increase in scheduled commercial banks\u2019  investments in bonds/debentures/shares of\npublic sector undertakings and private corporate sector, commercial paper (CP), etc., was 4.3 per\ncent (Rs.3,333 crore) (upto September 21, 2001) as compared with an increase of 4.6 per cent\n(Rs.2,873 crore)  in the corresponding period of the previous year. Together with such\ninvestments, the increase in  total flow of resources from scheduled commercial banks to the\ncommercial sector was only 4.4 per cent (Rs.24,227 crore)  as against 8.0 per cent (Rs.37,891\ncrore) in the corresponding period of the previous year.  The year-on-year growth in resource flow\nwas 12.0 per cent as against 20.2 per cent a year ago.\n8. Scheduled commercial banks\u2019 investments in instruments issued by financial institutions\nand mutual funds this year declined by Rs.300 crore as against a decline of Rs.255 crore last\nyear.  Total resource flow to the commercial sector including capital issues, Global Depository\nReceipts  (GDRs) and borrowings from financial institutions was Rs.64,734 crore during the\nfinancial year so far as compared with Rs.83,178 crore in the previous year.  Most of the debt\nissues by both private corporates and public sector units are on private placement basis which\nhas caused some regulatory concerns.  (This issue is addressed in  Part III of this Review.)\n9. The feedback on credit flows received from banks reveals that at a disaggregated level\nduring April-August 2001, there was an increase in scheduled commercial banks\u2019 credit to\nagriculture, housing, consumer durables, personal loans, tourism, other textiles, pharmaceuticals,\nautomobiles, construction and infrastructure.  On the other hand, decline in credit was observed\nin petroleum, coal, cotton textiles, jute textiles, tobacco, vegetable oils, all engineering and\nwholesale trade.\n10. In the current financial year upto October 5, 2001, money supply (M 3) increased by 8.2\nper cent (Rs.1,08,102 crore) as compared to 8.3 per cent (Rs.93,762 crore)  in the corresponding\nperiod of the previous year.  On an annual basis, growth in M 3 at 16.6 per cent was higher than\nthe growth of 15.3 per cent a year ago.  Aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks\nincreased by 9.1 per cent (Rs.87,895 crore) as compared with an increase of 8.9 per cent\n(Rs.72,687 crore)  in the corresponding period of the previous year.  On an annual basis, growth\nin aggregate deposits at 18.6 per cent was higher than that of 15.4 per cent a year ago.  In view\nof the adverse developments in the other segments of the financial market, the relative\nattractiveness of bank deposits seems to have increased.  If the surge in deposit growth\ncontinues, it may pose a challenge to the banking system in deploying resources, particularly in\nthe context of sluggishness in credit and investment demand.3\n11.   Reserve money increased by 1.8 per cent (Rs.5,516 crore) in the current financial year upto\nOctober 12, 2001 as compared to an increase of 1.6 per cent (Rs.4,427 crore)  in the\ncorresponding period of the previous year.  On the sources side, while net RBI credit to the\nCentral Government showed a modest increase of 4.5 per cent (Rs.6,552 crore) as compared to\nan increase of 14.9 per cent (Rs.20,859 crore)  in the corresponding period of the previous year,\nRBI\u2019s net foreign exchange assets increased significantly by 9.9 per cent (Rs.19,531 crore) in\nsharp contrast to a decline of 2.1 per cent ( - Rs.3,469 crore) during the corresponding period of\nthe previous year.  RBI\u2019s subscriptions to primary issues  of  Central Government dated securities\n(Rs.21,679 crore) was more than offset by net open market sales (Rs.22,275 crore).  There was\nalso reduced reliance on standing facilities due to comfortable liquidity conditions.  On the\ncomponents side, while currency in circulation increased by 5.7 per cent (Rs.12,461 crore)  as\ncompared to 6.2 per cent (Rs.12,138 crore), bankers\u2019 deposits with RBI declined by 8.3 per cent (\n- Rs.6,766 crore)  as against a decline of 9.8 per cent                 ( - Rs.7,871 crore) reflecting the\nimpact of reduction in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR). On balance, the reserve money expansion is\nexpected to remain moderate during 2001-02.\n12. Annual inflation, as measured by variations in Wholesale Price Index (WPI), on a point-\nto-point basis, on October 6, 2001 was 3.2 per cent as against 7.4 per cent a year ago.  Annual\ninflation, as measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI) for industrial workers on a point-to-point\nbasis, was 5.2 per cent in August 2001 as against 4.0 per cent a year ago.\n13. The contribution to inflation emanating from \u2018fue l, power, light and lubricants\u2019 sub-group\n(weight 14.2)  was moderate at 5.7 per cent this year (compared to 31.4 per cent last year).   The\nannual inflation rate, excluding the impact of price increases of this energy related sub-group was\nat 2.6 per cent.  While prices of primary articles (weight 22.0) recorded an increase of 4.6 per\ncent, manufactured products (weight 63.7) registered an increase of 1.8 per cent.  Among primary\narticles, the increase in prices was concentrated in a few articles such as fruits and vegetables,\noilseeds  and pulses.  In manufactured products, the increase in prices of edible oils and cement\nwas relatively high.  The inflation outlook for the year appears comfortable as agricultural growth\nprospects remain positive, and foodgrain stocks are very high.\n14. The Union Budget for 2001-02 placed the net and gross  market borrowings of the Central\nGovernment respectively  at Rs.77,353 crore and Rs.1,18,852 crore.  Upto October 20, 2001, the\nCentral Government completed net market borrowings of Rs.66,647 crore and gross borrowings\nof Rs.96,251 crore.  The government market borrowing programme during 2001-02 has been\nconducted by elongating the maturity pattern and at a lower cost. The weighted average maturity\nof borrowings was 13.9 years this year as against 10.6 years last year. The weighted average\nyield on government borrowings through dated securities was lower by nearly 100 basis points at\n9.96 per cent this year as against 10.95 per cent last year.  In its debt management, RBI\ncontinued to combine auction issues with acceptance by private placement of dated securities\nconsistent with market conditions.  The total private placement of dated securities with RBI during\nthe current year so far was Rs.21,679 crore.  In order to neutralise the monetary impact of private\nplacements, RBI conducted outright open market operations (OMO) sales of government\nsecurities to the tune of Rs.27,359 crore (upto October 20, 2001).\n15.    Gross fiscal deficit of the Central Government at Rs.56,079 crore upto August 2001 was\nhigher by about 54 per cent over the corresponding period of last year and constituted about one\nhalf  of the budget estimate for the current year. Similarly, revenue deficit (Rs.43,640 crore)\naccounted for above 55 per cent of the budget estimate for the year as a whole.  Gross fiscal\ndeficit as a proportion of GDP so far has been higher at 2.3 per cent as against 1.7 per cent in the\ncorresponding period of the previous year.\n16. A steady increase in net foreign currency assets of the Reserve Bank combined with\nsubdued real economic activity  created a situation of excess liquidity during most part of the first\nhalf of the year. The Reserve Bank, therefore, had to actively manage liquidity not only through\noutright OMO sales of securities but also through its daily Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF).4\nThe average daily absorption through repo transactions under LAF amounted to about Rs.3,600\ncrore.\n17.    Scheduled commercial banks\u2019 investments in government securities this year (upto October\n5, 2001) has been significantly large at Rs.43,664 crore as compared with Rs.25,636 crore in the\ncorresponding period of the previous year.   Commercial banks already hold government\nsecurities much in excess of the prescribed Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR),  to the extent of\nRs.1,29,450 crore, constituting 36.3 per cent of NDTL.\n18.    The overall interest rate structure which had come down substantially in the last two years,\ncontinued to show a softening trend.  The prime lending rates (PLRs) of public sector banks,\nwhich were ranging between 11.75 and 13.00 per cent in September 2000, softened to 10.0-13.0\nper cent in March 2001 and further to 10.0-12.5 per cent by mid-October 2001.  As banks are\npermitted to lend to exporters and  their prime customers at sub-PLR rates, the cost of bank\nborrowings to such corporates has come down even further.  Long-term domestic deposit rates of\npublic sector banks declined from 10.5 per cent in March 2001 to 9.5 per cent by mid-October\n2001; however, at the shorter end there was a marginal increase by 25 basis points.\n19. As announced in the annual policy Statement of April 2001, during the first half of the\nfiscal year, the Reserve Bank continued to provide appropriate liquidity through its repo\noperations.  Barring a few days, the overnight call money rate remained around 7.0 per cent\nduring the entire period, and the overall easy liquidity conditions were reflected in the response to\ndaily repos conducted by RBI.  The interest rate environment also remained fairly soft with yields\non        10-year Government paper declining by about 100 basis points (on top of a decline of\nabout 170 basis points in the previous two years).  The weighted average discount rate on  CP  of\n61 to 90-day maturity declined from 11.74 per cent in end-September 2000 to 9.71 per cent in\nend-March 2001 and further to 8.58 per cent by end-September 2001.  This constitutes a decline\nof as much as 3.16 percentage points in the discount rate on such paper over the past year.\nExternal Developments\n20.      The world economy, which had slowed down considerably during the first eight months of\nthe year 2001, experienced one of its worst shocks in the aftermath of the September 11 events\nin the US.  All segments of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets, were badly\naffected.  While global financial markets have stabilised in the past four weeks, the outlook for\ngrowth and recovery in the world economy remains highly uncertain.  The outlook for growth in\nmajor industrialised countries as also the emerging economies has become adverse with\nestimated growth rates being scaled down.  According to the latest World Economic Outlook\nbrought out by the IMF, the downturn in the emerging markets of Asia is likely to continue for a\nlonger period than that anticipated earlier.  The advanced economies are expected to grow by\nonly 1.3 per cent during 2001 as compared with 3.8 per cent last year. However, according to the\nIMF, India and China are expected to be less affected by this downturn.  India is relatively\ninsulated from this global slowdown because of its lower share of trade in GDP and service\noriented and cost efficient information technology sector.  Since these growth projections were\nmade before  September 11, it is likely that actual global growth will be even less than projected.\nThe chances of world economy sliding into a recessionary phase are now believed to be much\ngreater than that a few weeks ago.\n21.     India was also affected by the global economic slowdown and instability in financial\nmarkets. Equity markets, which had shown a fall of about 360 points between end-March and\nend-August 2001, declined further, and BSE Sensex, the Index of the Mumbai Stock Exchange,\ntouched an eight year low on September 21, 2001. It has since gained 417 points to reach 3017\nby        October 19, 2001.   There was net capital outflow of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)\nby about US $ 179 million in September 2001.  Foreign exchange markets also became volatile\nwith the rupee showing a depreciation of 1.3 per cent vis-\u00e0-vis US dollar during the 10-day period5\nof September 11-20, 2001. The consequent uncertainties affected the bond market, particularly\nthe government securities market.\n22. Adverse external developments after S eptember 11, and their effect on India\u2019s financial\nmarkets, necessitated a quick response to provide appropriate liquidity and overall comfort to the\nmarkets.  In order to stabilise domestic financial markets, RBI announced the following measures\nduring the period September 15-25, 2001:\n? On September 15, 2001, despite some emerging pressures in the forex market, RBI\nannounced that it does not intend to presently shift its monetary policy stance in regard to\nkeeping interest rates stable with adequate liquidity.  RBI further assured the markets that\nit will be prepared to sell foreign exchange directly or indirectly, if it considers it necessary\nto do so, to meet any unusual supply-demand gap in view of the prevailing uncertainties.\n? In view of the extraordinary circumstances in the government securities market,  RBI\nopened a purchase window for select government securities on an auction basis.\n? On September 20, 2001, in consultation with the Government of India, Indian\ncompanies were permitted to increase the FII investment limit upto the sectoral\ncap/statutory ceiling, as applicable.\n? With effect from September 22, 2001, banks were allowed to finance stock brokers\nfor margin trading for an initial  period of 60 days (i.e., up to November 22, 2001) in\nactively traded scrips which form part of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty and\nBSE Sensex within the overall existing ceiling of bank exposure to capital market.\n? On September 24, 2001, in consultation with the Government of India, a special\nfinancial package was announced, for large value exports of six  select products, which\nwere internationally competitive and had high value addition.\n? With effect from September 26, 2001, interest rates charged by scheduled\ncommercial banks on pre-shipment and post-shipment rupee export credit were reduced\nby 1.0 percentage point for a period of six months (upto March 31, 2002).\n23.    The above measures had the desired effect of moderating possible panic reactions and\nreducing volatility in financial markets, particularly in  money, forex and government securities\nmarkets.  While financial markets are generally stable, liquidity is adequate, and interest rate\nenvironment is favourable, so far, there is no perceptible upturn in industrial output. This\ncontinues to be a matter of serious concern.  It is to be hoped that as global markets gain back\nmomentum after some time, it will have a favourable impact on the investment climate in India\nalso.\n24. The annual monetary policy Statements of last two years as well as m id-term Reviews\nhave attempted to highlight the main lessons emerging from our experience in managing the\nexternal sector during periods of external and domestic uncertainties.  The recent experience has\nonce again highlighted the need for continuous vigilance and the importance of building adequate\nsafety nets to withstand the effects of unexpected shocks and market uncertainties.  In this\ncontext, India\u2019s exchange rate policy of focusing on managing volatility with no fixed rate target,\nwhile allowing the underlying demand and supply conditions to determine the exchange rate\nmovements over a period in an orderly way, has stood the test of time.  Despite several\nunexpected external and domestic developments, India\u2019s external situation has remained\nsatisfactory.  RBI will continue to follow the same approach of watchfulness, caution and flexibility\nin regard to the forex market.  It will continue to monitor closely, as in the past, the developments\nin the financial markets at home and abroad, and carefully coordinate its market operations with\nappropriate monetary, regulatory and other measures as considered necessary from time to time.6\n25. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have increased sharply by over US $ 10 billion from\nUS $ 34.9 billion as on October 20, 2000 to US $ 45.1 billion by October 19, 2001.   India\u2019s\nsustained efforts to build an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves in the last few years\nhave also been fully vindicated by recent developments.  As pointed out in previous policy\nStatements, the overall approach to the management of India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves in\nrecent years has reflected the changing composition of balance of payments, and has\nendeavoured to reflect the \u201cliquidity risks\u201d associated with different types of flows and other\nrequirements.  The policy for reserve management is thus judiciously built upon a host of\nidentifiable factors and other contingencies.  Such factors, inter alia,  include: the size of the\ncurrent account deficit; the size of short-term liabilities (including current repayment obligations on\nlong-term loans); the possible variability in portfolio investment and other types of capital flows;\nthe unanticipated pressures on the balance of payments arising out of external shocks (such as,\nthe impact of the East Asian crisis in 1997-98 or increase in oil prices in 1999-2000 or recent\nevents in the US); and movements in the repatriable foreign currency deposits of  Non-resident\nIndians (NRIs).  Taking these factors into account, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are at\npresent comfortable.  However, there can be no cause for complacency.  We must continue to\nensure that, leaving aside short-term variations in reserve levels, the quantum of reserves in the\nlong run is in line with the rate of growth in the economy, the share of external sector in the\neconomy and the size of risk-adjusted capital flows.  This will provide us with greater security\nagainst unfavourable or unanticipated developments of the type witnessed recently as well as\nduring earlier years.\n26. On account of global slowdown, exports have not done well during the current year.\nIndia\u2019s exports during the first five months of the current financial year at about US $ 17.1 billion\nregistered a decline of 2.3 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year.  Imports\nincreased by 2.5 per cent as against an increase of 13.8 per cent last year.  Trade deficit in the\nfirst five months of the current financial year at US $ 4.6 billion was higher   than that of US $ 3.7\nbillion in the same period last year.  Oil imports declined by 6.1 per cent in US dollar terms as\ncompared with a large increase of 78.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year\non account of moderation of international oil prices.  Non-oil imports increased by 6.7 per cent\nduring April-August 2001 as against a decline of 3.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the\nprevious year.   While the surplus on the non-oil account declined from US     $ 2.9 billion to US $\n1.1 billion, the deficit on oil account  decreased from US $ 6.5 billion during April-August 2000 to\nUS $ 5.7 billion during April-August 2001. For the rest of the year, there is some uncertainty about\nthe likely course of international oil prices.  If the average oil prices for the rest of the financial\nyear are assumed to be at US $ 25.0 per barrel, the oil import bill for 2001-02 will be in the range\nof US $ 17.5-18.0 billion as against actual imports of US $ 15.6 billion in the previous year.\nHowever, on present reckoning, it is expected that the current account deficit for the year 2001-02\nwill still be well below 2.0 per cent of GDP and no significant pressures on balance of payments\nare expected on this account.\n27. A strong effort to accelerate the growth of exports is essential for long-term  viability of\nbalance of payments as well as for generation of income and employment in the economy.  As\nmentioned earlier, as part of the efforts to provide support to exporters during the prevailing\nperiod of global uncertainty, the Reserve Bank advised reduction in ceiling interest rates on rupee\nexport credit by 1.0 percentage point across the board for a period of six months.  It may be\nemphasised that so far as interest cost to the exporters is concerned, taking into account forward\npremia, the effective interest cost on six-month rupee export credit is only 3.0-4.0 per cent\n(assuming a forward premia of  5.0 per cent), which is internationally competitive.  Similarly,\nexporters are free to avail of foreign currency loans in the currency of their choice at\ninternationally competitive rates.   Foreign currency loans from banks in India can be availed of by\nexporters at LIBOR plus a maximum of 1.0 percentage point.\n28. In the past three years, several measures have also been introduced to ensure timely\ndelivery of credit to exporters at reasonable cost and removal of procedural hassles.  It was\nannounced in the last annual policy Statement that a survey of exporters\u2019 satisfaction would be7\nconducted through an independent agency.  Accordingly, the work of the survey has been\nentrusted to National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), New Delhi.  NCAER has\nlaunched the survey on August 31, 2001 and has started interacting with bank officials and\nexporters/export organisations at various centres in the country.\n29. In the recent period, procedures for financial transactions such as remittances,\ninvestments and maintenance of bank accounts, etc., for non-residents have been considerably\nsimplified.  Foreign direct investment (FDI) is permitted under the automatic route for most\nactivities except in certain circumstances and for a very small negative list.   Indian companies\nare allowed to increase the FII investment limit upto the sectoral caps/statutory ceilings as\napplicable. A number of steps have been taken to improve liquidity in the American Depository\nReceipt/Global Depository Receipt (ADR/GDR) market and to give opportunity to Indian\nshareholders to divest their shareholding in the ADR/GDR market abroad.  Indian companies\nwishing to make acquisitions of foreign companies or direct investment abroad in Joint\nVentures/Wholly Owned Subsidiaries can now invest upto US $ 50 million on an annual basis\nthrough automatic route with additional block allocation of foreign exchange subject to certain\nconditions.\n30. Over a period, considerable flexibility has been given to the corporates to hedge their\nforex exposure in the market. Instruments available to the corporates for hedging their exchange\nrisks include forward cover, currency options, foreign currency-rupee swaps, hedging of the loan\nexposures, etc.  Banks are also allowed to hedge their asset-liability portfolio, after obtaining\nnecessary policy approval in this regard from their top management.\n31. It is, however, observed that sometimes a no ticeable portion of the corporate foreign\ncurrency commitments tend to remain unhedged by the coporates on the basis of  their\nperceptions of the market and these could impact the overall financial status of the corporates\nunder severe uncertainties.  It is, therefore,  desirable for banks which have large exposures to\nsuch corporates to put in place a system for monitoring such unhedged external exposures.\nIllustratively, banks could consider introducing a periodical review of the unhedged portion of\nforeign currency exposures of the corporates whose total exposure is relatively large (say, above\nUS $ 25 million or so) through a suitable reporting system.\n32. The Reserve Bank will continue with its efforts to simplify procedures, reduce\ndocumentation requirements and further liberalise opportunities for productive investment in India\nby NRIs and others and by Indian corporates/entities abroad.  Further suggestions from experts,\ncorporates and market participants in these areas are welcome, and can be sent by e-mail at\nhelpnri@rbi.org.in\nII. Stance of Monetary Policy for\nthe Second Half of 2001-02\n33.     The annual  policy Statement of April 2001 had indicated that under normal circumstances\nand barring emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in domestic or external\nsectors, the overall stance of monetary policy for 2001-02 will be:\n? Provision of adequate liquidity to meet credit growth and support revival of\ninvestment demand while continuing a vigil on movements in the price level.\n? Within the overall framework of imparting greater flexibility to the interest rate\nregime in the medium-term, to continue the present stable interest rate\nenvironment with a preference for softening to the extent the evolving situation\nwarrants.\n34.     During the first half of the year, as pointed out in the previous section, in the conduct of\nmonetary policy, it was feasible to maintain adequate liquidity in the market, primarily through8\nflexible operation of repos and reverse repos under   LAF combined with OMO, when necessary.\nNotwithstanding a high level of market borrowing by the Government, it was also feasible to\nmaintain a stable interest rate environment, with further softening of interest rates.\n35.     At the short end of the market, the average call money rate came down sharply from 8.6\nper cent in early-April to 7.0 per cent in mid-October 2001.  During this period, the LAF repo rate\nalso came down from 7.0 per cent to 6.5 per cent.  The CRR was reduced by 50 basis points to\n7.5 per cent, effective May 19, 2001, augmenting lendable resources of the banking system by\nRs.4,500 crore. Responding to these operations, the interest rates in other money market\ninstruments also showed a declining trend.  For example, the primary yield on 91-day Treasury\nBills declined by 150 basis points from 8.5 per cent to 7.0 per cent between April and  mid-\nOctober 2001.  During the same period, primary yield on 364-day Treasury Bills fell by 168 basis\npoints from 8.85 per cent to 7.17 per cent.  The discount rates on CP also showed a similar trend.\nAt the long end of the market, the secondary market yields on government paper in the range of\n10-20 years have softened from 10.08-10.70 per cent in April to 9.12-9.92 per cent by mid-\nOctober 2001.\n36.     The decline in inflation rate since the mid-1990s, despite occasional supply and external\nshocks has had a positive impact on inflation expectations.  Because of this, it has been possible\nto reduce nominal interest rates on a sustained basis despite a high level of fiscal deficit and\nother structural rigidities. While the risks of inflation are relatively low, as of now, in the context of\nample liquidity already available in the system, RBI will continue to carefully manage the liquidity\nwith a judicious mix of the range of instruments available with it.\n37. Despite several uncertainties, the fundamentals of the economy as reflected in moderate\ninflation, stable and low interest rates, high foreign exchange reserves, large foodgrain stocks\nand competitive advantage of information technology related industries, are still strong. The\nprospects for agricultural growth during this year remain positive. Global and domestic inflationary\noutlook currently continues to be favourable.  It is, therefore, proposed to continue with the overall\nstance of monetary policy announced in the April Statement for the remaining half of the current\nyear and ensure that all legitimate requirements for credit are met consistent with price stability.\nUnless circumstances change unexpectedly, RBI will also endeavour to maintain the current\ninterest rate environment.\n38.   The Bank Rate will continue to remain the principal signaling instrument in so far as RBI is\nconcerned, providing directional guidance to the extent feasible, to general level of interest rates.\nThe LAF rates would operate around the Bank Rate, with a flexible corridor, as more active\noperating instruments for day-to-day liquidity management and steering short-term interest rates.\n39. While all efforts will be made to maintain the current stance of monetary policy, two\ncaveats are necessary in order to ensure that banks and market participants do not take too\ncomplacent a view on the current monetary and interest rate environment.  First, in their portfolio\nmanagement, banks, primary dealers (PDs) and other market participants must explicitly take into\naccount that the interest rate environment can change quite dramatically within a very short\nperiod of time. The substantial decline in interest rates in the last couple of years has resulted in\nlarge gains, realised and unrealised, to holders of medium and long-term securities.  It is of\nutmost importance that these gains are not frittered away or used for illiquid market operations.\nThe time when market conditions are favourable is also the time to build adequate reserves to\nguard against any possible reversal of the interest rate environment in future due to unexpected\ndevelopments. Difficulties faced by banks, PDs and other market operators in the first quarter of\nthe last fiscal year, i.e., 2000-01, when interest rates had to be increased by RBI (in order to\ncheck volatility in the foreign exchange market consequent upon sharp and frequent increases in\nthe international interest rates) provides a valuable lesson in this regard.\n40. Second, it needs to be recognised that in view of certain structural characteristics of our\nfinancial system, the scope for further softening in lending rates by banks and other financial9\nintermediaries is limited.  Following are some of the factors which reduce downward flexibility in\nthe interest rate structure in India:\n? Banks, particularly public sector banks, continue to be the primary mobilisers of domestic\nfinancial savings (in addition to Provident Funds, Small Saving Schemes, and Life\nInsurance Corporation).  Holders of term deposits in banks generally belong to fixed\nincome groups and expect a reasonable nominal interest rate, in excess of the long-term\nrate of inflation.  The recent reductions in deposit rates and return on small savings have\ncaused widespread concern among depositors because of lack of other risk-free avenues\nfor financial savings.  This constrains the ability of banks to effect further reduction in their\nlending rates without affecting their deposit mobilisation and the growth of financial\nsavings over the medium-term.\n? Banks have been given the freedom to offer \u201cvariable\u201d interest rates on longer-term\ndeposits.  However, for various reasons, the preference of depositors as well as the\ntraditional practice with banks tended to favour  fixed interest rates on term deposits.  This\npractice has effectively reduced the flexibility that banks have in lowering their lending\nrates in the short run, since the rates on the existing stock of deposits cannot be lowered.\n? For public sector banks, the average cost of funds is over 7.0 per cent, and  for many\nprivate sector banks, the average cost is even higher.  The non-interest operating\nexpenses generally work out to 2.5 to 3.0 per cent of total assets, putting pressure on the\nrequired spread over cost of funds.  Relatively high overhang of Non-Performing Assets\n(NPAs) pushes up further the lending rates.\n? There is a persistent and large volume of market borrowing requirements of the\nGovernment giving an upward bias to the interest rate structure.\n? In view of the above rigidities in cost, spread, and tenor of deposits, the link between\nvariation in the RBI\u2019s Bank Rate and the actual lending rates of banks, particularly at\nlower levels, is not as strong in India as in industrialised countries .  PLRs of banks for\ncommercial credit are entirely within the purview of the banks, and are not set by the\nReserve Bank. Decisions in regard to interest rates, therefore, have to be taken by banks\nthemselves in the light of various factors, including their own cost of funds, their\ntransaction costs, interest rates ruling in the non-banking sector, etc.\n41.   It is necessary to continue with the on-going efforts to reduce the impact of the above\nstructural constraints on the flexibility of our interest rate structure.  Recently, the Government\nhas taken important steps to reduce the prevailing interest rates on contractual savings like\nProvident Funds and National Saving Schemes.  A more sustainable and flexible interest rate\nregime for contractual savings has also been recommended by the Expert Committee set up by\nthe Government (Chairman: Dr. Y.V. Reddy).  It will also be highly desirable for banks to move\nover to a variable interest rate structure on longer-term deposits as early as possible.  Since\ninterest rates could vary in both directions, depending on the phase of the business cycle and\ninflationary outlook, a variable interest rate regime on long-term deposits does not necessarily\nimply  lowering of the average interest rate earned by depositors over a period of time (compared\nwith a fixed rate regime, which favours old deposits over new deposits when interest rates are\ncoming down, and vice versa  when rates are moving in the opposite direction).  In addition, banks\nhave to put in their best efforts to reduce their operating costs over time by improving productivity\nand increasing their volume of lending.\nIII. Financial Sector Reforms and\nMonetary Policy Measures\n42. The Reserve Bank has, in recent years an nounced various structural measures to\nstrengthen the financial system and improve the functioning of the different  segments of financial10\nmarkets.  The annual policy Statements and the mid-term Reviews assess the progress in these\nareas and also propose appropriate additional measures as necessary, in the light of experience\nand after appropriate consultations with banks, other financial institutions, and experts.  As\nfinancial markets in the last few months have been affected by several uncertainties and some\nturbulence, it may be useful to review the impact of recent developments on long-term objectives\nof financial sector  reforms before we deal with some of the specific measures.\nRecent Financial Market Developments\n43. Developments in equity market  since March 2001, and involvement of a few banks in\nproviding substantial support to a few stock -broking entities, contrary to RBI guidelines and\nnormal prudential requirements, have raised concerns regarding the potential vulnerability in\nIndia\u2019s financial sector. Fortunately, so far as the banking sector is concerned, the unethical and\nunwarranted lending practices on a significant scale were confined to only a few  relatively small\nprivate sector banks, and one fairly large Urban Co-operative Bank (UCB).  As such, it was\npossible, through temporary and limited liquidity support measures, to avoid the \u201ccontagion\u201d\nspreading from their activities in the equity market to the banking sector as a whole or to other\nimportant segments of the financial sector, particularly the money and government securities\nmarkets. Nevertheless, the recent experience in equity market, and its aftermath, have thrown up\nnew challenges for the regulatory and supervisory system as well as for standards of corporate\ngovernance in banks.\n44. First and foremost, it is essential to enforce all prudential norms and strengthen them\nfurther in order to minimise the possibility of contagion spreading from one segment of the market\nto another or from one defaulting institution to a number of inter-connected financial entities. The\nscope for \u201cregulatory forbearance\u201d has to be minimised in the event of emerging weaknesses in a\nfinancial institution (irrespective of whether its ownership is co-operative, public or private). In the\npast few years, the Reserve Bank has introduced a series of prudential measures for capital\nadequacy, income recognition and provisioning in respect of NPAs, disclosure and transparency\nin accounting, and risk containment. Certain additional legislative and other measures are also\nunder consideration of the Government. It is of utmost importance that all deposit-taking financial\nintermediaries \u2013 irrespective of whether they are in the public sector or in the private sector,\nwhether they are commercial banks or co-operative banks, whether they are non-banks or\nfinancial institutions  \u2013  should fully adhere to the prudential guidelines.\n45. The Reserve Bank recognises the need to strengthen its monitoring system for enforcement\nof prudential and risk management guidelines, and for taking swift action, wherever possible\nunder relevant laws, against defaulting entities. Measures for off-site monitoring and inspection,\nparticularly in respect of weak banks and co-operative institutions, have already been introduced.\nRBI proposes to further strengthen its monitoring and supervisory machinery and procedures, in\nconsultation with banks and other financial institutions, as necessary.\n46.As pointed out in the annual  policy Statement of April 2001, the prudential norms and the\nregulatory system prescribed for UCBs have traditionally been relatively soft, in comparison with\nthose for commercial banks. This is partly on account of historical reasons, and partly due to their\nsize being generally small and the preferential treatment of co-operative structure in general. At\npresent, three authorities are involved in regulatory and promotional aspects concerning UCBs \u2013\nthe Central Government (in case of banks having multi-state presence), State Governments and\nRBI. At times, this results in overlapping jurisdiction and difficulties in carrying out\nadministrative/prudential measures with the required speed and stringency. The recent\nexperience has also shown that irresponsible and unethical behaviour on the part of even a few\nco-operative banks in the country can have some contagion effect beyond the particular area or\nthe State concerned and may cause severe harm to depositors, including smaller co-operative\nbanks and impair confidence in the system. It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that prudential\nguidelines in respect of these banks are strengthened to protect public deposits, pending legal\nand institutional reforms.11\n47.  The April 2001 policy  Statement had, therefore, proposed some new prudential measures,\nparticularly in regard to maintenance and safety of securities held under the prescribed SLR,\nlending against shares, and the degree of access to call money market. In order to minimise any\nimmediate financial impact on UCBs, precautions were taken to introduce new prudential\nmeasures with a prospective date and allow sufficient time for UCBs to implement them in the\ninterest of their members.  Some State level apex co-operative banks have represented against\nthese measures on the ground that they may affect their financial operations and reduce their\nflexibility.\n48.  The Reserve Bank welcomes the on-going constructive dialogue with UCBs and their\nrepresentative associations. It will be prepared to further improve/modify specific measures\nsubject only to one condition, i.e., providing an adequate, workable and transparent mechanism\nfor protection of public deposits held in the co-operative sector. Needless to say that a viable co-\noperative financial system has to be such that interests of both the \u201cborrowing\u201d entities as well as\nthe \u201cdepositing\u201d public are protected. Past experience, even though confined to some errant co-\noperative banks, has made it abundantly clear that inter-bank co-operative deposits and lack of\nadequate secured liquid assets have substantially compromised the depositors\u2019 interests. As a\nresult, public confidence in the co-operative banking sector as a whole has also been shaken. In\nthe interest of the growth of the co-operative sector itself, there is no option but to devise a viable\nand transparent system for reasonable protection of public deposits.\n49. As mentioned earlier, three authorities (Central and State Governments and RBI) are\npresently involved in regulating, supervising and/or administering UCBs. There are as many as\n2,084 UCBs of which 51 are scheduled and the rest are  non-scheduled UCBs. In view of their\nlarge number as well as their dispersed and local character, their supervision and inspection pose\nspecial problems. At present, while accounts of UCBs are required to be audited by State\nGovernments, there has been substantial delay in completing audit of a large number of UCBs.\nRBI conducts statutory inspections normally once in two years in respect of scheduled UCBs,\nonce in two to three years in respect of non-scheduled UCBs, while the identified weak banks are\ninspected on annual basis.  Several committees, including a high power committee set up by  RBI\nin May 1999 under the Chairmanship of  Shri K. Madhava Rao, have made wide-ranging\nrecommendations for eliminating dual control and for improving the functioning of the co-\noperative banks. Most of these recommendations have been accepted by RBI, but\nrecommendations requiring legislative action at the level of State Governments have yet to be\nimplemented.\n50. In order to overcom e supervisory problems arising from the present three-pronged and\nmulti-level institutional system (consisting of the Centre, States and RBI), the Reserve Bank has\nsuggested setting up of a new Apex Supervisory Body for the entire urban co-operative banking\nsector. It has proposed that this Apex body could be under the control of a separate high-level\nsupervisory Board consisting of representatives of the Central Government, State Governments,\nRBI as well as experts and it could be given the responsibility of inspection/and supervision of\nUCBs and ensuring their conformity with prescribed prudential, capital adequacy and risk-\nmanagement norms.  The Reserve Bank has also forwarded its detailed proposals to the Central\nGovernment for setting up the Apex Supervisory Body.\n51. Recent events have also brought to the fore the need for Boards of banks and financial\ninstitutions to exercise proper vigilance and supervision over the functioning of commercial\nbanking and other financial institutions. In recent years, as part of on-going financial sector\nreforms, much greater autonomy and powers have been entrusted to their Boards, to lay down\neffective internal guidelines and procedures for transparency, disclosure, risk and asset-liability\nmanagement. Yet, it has been noticed that in some cases, the policy laid down by the Boards\nwas either flouted with impunity or the Board itself had failed to lay down appropriate internal\nguidelines for minimising risks and over-lending to certain entities without adequate security. If\nproblems of the type which have surfaced recently are to be avoided in the future, within the12\nframework of a deregulated and liberal financial system, the role of Boards becomes crucial. The\nReserve Bank proposes to set up a consultative group of directors of a select group of\ncommercial banks and financial institutions to suggest, for consideration by the Government/RBI,\nmeasures that should be taken to strengthen the internal supervisory role of Boards.\n52.  In the rest of this section, an attempt is made to review the progress in respect of various\nmonetary and other measures announced in recent years, and to propose some further measures\nof immediate as well as long-term importance.\nMonetary Measures\n(a) Bank Rate\n53. On the basis of a rev iew of macroeconomic and monetary developments, the Bank Rate\nis being reduced by 0.50 percentage point from 7.0 per cent to 6.50 per cent with effect from the\nclose of business today (October 22, 2001).  At this level, it is the lowest Bank Rate since May\n1973.\n(b) Cash Reserve Ratio - Reduction and Rationalisation\n54. All scheduled commercial banks [excluding Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)] are, at\npresent, required to maintain with the Reserve Bank of India a cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 7.5\nper cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL).  While the statutory minimum\nrequirement of CRR maintenance at        3.0 per cent is obligatory on the banks, additional CRR,\nranging between           4.5 per cent and 12.0 per cent since 1981, has been imposed from time to\ntime in order to reduce the overflow of liquidity due to excessive money supply in the economy.\nAt the same time, over a period, various exemptions given to the banks on certain specific\ncategories of liabilities for the CRR requirement resulted in the effective CRR being different from\nthe prescribed level in respect of individual banks.  The effective CRR for different banks vary\ndepending upon the composition of their liabilities, and for the banking system as a whole,\neffective CRR, at present is of the order of 6.3 per cent.  Exemptions and multiple prescriptions\nover time made in response to specific requirements have increased the complexity of CRR as an\ninstrument of liquidity management. With a view to rationalizing CRR prescription and moving\ntowards the long-term goal of keeping CRR normally at the statutory level, important changes are\nproposed below in respect of the coverage as well as the level of CRR for the banking system:\n? It is proposed to reduce the CRR by 200 basis points to 5.50 per cent from 7.50 per\ncent of NDTL.  Effective from the fortnight beginning November 3, 2001, CRR will be\nreduced to 5.75 per cent; and effective fortnight beginning December 29, 2001, the\nCRR will be reduced further to 5.50 per cent of NDTL.\n? At the same time, all the exemptions on the liabilities will be withdrawn except inter-\nbank liabilities, for the computation of NDTL (for requirement of maintenance of CRR)\nwith effect from fortnight beginning November 3, 2001.\n55. It is expected that t hese changes will facilitate the development of a short term yield\ncurve, develop money market, reduce the regulatory arbitrage between banks and non-banks,\nenhance the availability of lendable resources with the banks and improve the efficiency of\nindirect instruments in the conduct of monetary policy.  At the present level of NDTL, the\ncombined impact of the above two measures will result in augmenting lendable resources of the\nbanking system by about Rs.8,000 crore (about Rs.6,000 crore effective from\nNovember 3, 2001).\n56. It may, however, be emphasized that while the proposed CRR reduction is consistent\nwith the medium term objective, and the current circumstances of relatively low level of economic13\nactivity and reasonable inflation, RBI will continue to use the CRR instrument in both directions\nfor liquidity management in addition to other instruments (such as, the LAF.)\nc) Interest on Cash balances Maintained with RBI\n57. All scheduled commercial banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) are paid interest on\neligible cash balances maintained with RBI under CRR requirement at the rate of 6.0 per cent per\nannum effective April 21, 2001 against 4.0 per cent earlier.  In the annual policy Statement of\nApril 2001, it was announced that at a subsequent stage, interest will be paid at the Bank Rate.\nAccordingly, with effect from fortnight beginning November 3, 2001, the interest paid on eligible\ncash balances will be at the Bank Rate (i.e., 6.5 per cent).\nLiquidity Adjustment Facility  - Progress\n58.   The Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), introduced since June 5, 2000, has emerged as an\neffective and flexible instrument for influencing liquidity on a day-to-day basis.  A package of\nmeasures was announced in the annual policy Statement in April 2001 encompassing changes in\noperating procedures of LAF, a strategy for smooth transition of call money market to pure inter-\nbank market and a programme for rationalisation of liquidity support available to the system. A set\nof complementary measures in money and government securities markets was also introduced.\n59.  On the whole, this package of measures had a positive impact.  The LAF has rendered the\nnecessary flexibility to RBI to operate on liquidity and to some extent to signal interest rates in the\nshort-term money market.  The LAF operations, combined with strategic OMO, have evolved into\nthe principal operating procedure of monetary policy of the Reserve Bank in the short-run.  The\neffectiveness of LAF would be further strengthened as the system moves towards a pure inter-\nbank call/notice money market coupled with the growth of a deep and liquid repo/reverse repo\nmarket for non-bank participants.  Effective May 2001,  non-banks are permitted to lend upto 85\nper cent of their average daily lending during 2000-01. This has not caused any strain on the\nmarket with average daily aggregate lending in call money market improving to Rs.19,600 crore\nduring May-September 2001 compared to Rs.10,900 crore during the corresponding period of the\nprevious year.  Volatility in call money rates has also come down significantly.  It is encouraging\nto note that the volume of repo operations by non-bank participants has been increasing in the\nrecent period.\n60.   In the context of improving the effectiveness of LAF, it is reiterated that in addition to\novernight repos, RBI will also have the discretion to introduce longer-term repos upto 14-day\nperiod as and when required.\nCommercial Paper -  Dematerialised Holding\n61.   RBI issued fresh guidelines for issuance of Commercial Paper on October 10, 2000 relaxing\nthe terms and conditions and streamlining the procedures.  As indicated in the annual policy\nStatement of April 2001, banks, Financial Institutions (FIs), PDs and Satellite Dealers (SDs) are\nnow permitted to make fresh investments and hold CP only in dematerialised form, effective June\n30, 2001.  In this context, Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India\n(FIMMDA) circulated a \u201cReport of FIMMDA Working Group on Primary Markets Relating to\nMarket Conventions and Guidelines for Commercial Paper\u201d.  After extensive discussions on legal\nand related issues with depositories and RBI and after considering suggestions received from\ncorporates, members of FIMMDA and other market players, the operational guidelines in respect\nof CP in dematerialised form were made public by FIMMDA on June 29, 2001.  Further, to\nfacilitate conversion of  physicals into demat, FIMMDA, in consultation with market participants,\ndepositories and RBI, prepared the related guidelines and made them public on October 3, 2001.14\nThese guidelines seem to be working reasonably well, and no changes are being proposed at\npresent.\nDevelopment of Government Securities Market\n62. Following the announcement made in the U nion Budget for 2001-02, certain measures\nwere announced in the annual policy Statement for the development of government securities\nmarket.  Progress in regard to these measures is reviewed below:\n? As announced in the annual policy Statement, 14-day and 182-day Treasury Bills (TBs)\nhave been withdrawn from the week beginning May 14, 2001.  The notified amount of 91-\nday TBs has been simultaneously increased to Rs.250 crore.  It has also been ensured\nthat both the 91-day and 364-day TBs mature on the same day in order to facilitate the\navailability of adequate fungible stocks of TBs of varying maturities in the secondary\nmarket.  Increased attractiveness of TBs is evident from the fact that no devolvement on\nthe Reserve Bank has taken place in Treasury Bill auctions and the bid-coverage ratio,\nparticularly with respect to 364-day TBs, has also improved.\n? A Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) is being introduced with a view to facilitating\nelectronic bidding in auctions and secondary market transactions in government\nsecurities and dissemination of information on trades on a real-time basis. The\ntechnology infrastructure related to NDS has been tested with the involvement of all\nmarket participants, in Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN)\nenvironments.    Parallel runs are expected in November 2001.\n? The Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) was registered on April 30, 2001 under\nthe Companies Act, 1956 with the State Bank of India  as the chief promoter.  Initially, the\nCCIL will be clearing all transactions  in government securities and repos reported on the\nNDS of RBI and also rupee/US dollar forex spot and forward deals. The\noperationalisation of CCIL, linked to the NDS, is expected to commence  with a test run\nin November 2001.\n? Necessary amendments to notification issued by the Government for introduction of\nuniform price auction format for auctions of dated securities are being proposed.  With\nthe approval of the Government, the new auction format will be introduced on an\nexperimental basis.\n? A scheme of retail participation, including the middle segment encompassing Provident\nFunds, trusts, etc., in the primary market for government securities on non-competitive\nbasis has been finalised in consultation with market participants  and the Technical\nAdvisory Committee on Money and Government Securities Markets (TAC).  The  details\nof the scheme will be finalised soon.\n? The Reserve Bank has prepared a consultative paper drawing a road map for developing\nSeparate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS).  This is\nbeing placed on the RBI website inviting comments and suggestions from market\nparticipants.\n Review of the Satellite Dealer System\n63.    The Satellite Dealer system was introduced in 1996 to serve as a second tier to PDs in the\ngovernment securities market with the particular objective of promoting retail segment.  The\nexperience with SDs shows that in practice, SDs\u2019 role in retailing of government securities has\nremained very limited. Even as a complementary service, the SD system is perceived to result in15\nhigher transaction costs to retail investors.  Many of them being broking firms with limited capital\nstrength and having wider presence in non-government securities business have  also raised\nsome supervisory concerns.\n64.   In the light of the above experience, the Reserve Bank has decided to undertake a review of\nthe SD system in close consultation with SDs, PDs and the TAC. The review will consider the role\ncarved out for SDs in  the development of retail market, particularly in the context of the\nexpanding role of PDs,  emerging  alternative mechanism of retailing government securities on\nthe screen-based trading in exchanges, and the supervisory concerns in monitoring SDs\u2019\noperations.  The review will examine the scope for establishing a better linkage between SDs and\nPDs and thereby improving the SD system as an effective distribution channel at a retail level for\ngovernment securities.\nPrudential Measures\n(a) Credit Information Bureau\n65.   A mention was made in the annual policy Statement of April 2001 about the setting up of the\nCredit Information Bureau (CIB) to collect, process and share credit information on the borrowers\namong banks and FIs.  With a view to strengthen the legal mechanism, a draft legislation\ncovering, inter alia,  responsibilities of the Bureau, rights and obligations of the member credit\ninstitutions and safeguarding of the privacy rights has been forwarded to the  Government.\nPending such amendments, as a first step towards activating CIB, it has been decided to initiate\nthe process of collection and dissemination of some relevant information, within the existing legal\nframework.\n66.   In order to operationalise the process of collection and dissemination of the data on credit\ninformation by the CIB, RBI will constitute a Group drawing representation from CIB, Indian\nBanks\u2019 Association (IBA), select banks and FIs.  The Group will examine the possibility of the CIB\nperforming the role of collecting and disseminating information on the list of suit-filed accounts\nand the list of defaulters, including willful defaulters, which is presently handled by RBI. The\nGroup will also examine the other aspects of information collection and dissemination, such as,\nthe extent, periodicity and coverage including the feasibility of supplying such information on-line,\nto members in future. Ideally, it should also be possible to work out in future a \u2018query mode\u2019 to\nprovide any additional information needed and considered appropriate, on specific requests from\nmembers, including particulars relating to directors in the defaulting companies, as long as it is\nlegally permissible.  The Group will study all these issues and submit a report in one month\u2019s\ntime.  The transfer of work will be notified separately, thereafter.\n(b) Non-SLR Investments  by Banks\nand Financial Institutions\n67.  It has been observed that, of the investments by banks, a significant proportion of the banks\u2019\ninvestments in non-SLR securities is through the private placement route. The non-transparent\npractices in this market could be a matter of concern. RBI had accordingly issued guidelines in\nJune 2001 regarding the due diligence to be undertaken, the disclosures to be obtained and the\ncredit risk analysis to be made in regard to privately placed investments especially for unrated\ninstruments.  Banks have been advised to adopt an internal system of rating for issues of non-\nborrowers, whether rated or otherwise, and adopt prudential limits to mitigate adverse impact of\nconcentration and illiquidity.  Banks have also been advised to put in place proper risk\nmanagement systems for capturing and analysing the risks so as to take timely remedial\nmeasures.  A further review of non-SLR investments in the light of recent developments reveals\nthat the ease of mobilising funds through privately placed debt issues could lead to the use of\nsuch funds for risky purposes other than what is disclosed in the offer document.16\n68.    In order to contain the risks arising out of non-SLR investment portfolio of banks and FIs, in\nparticular through the private placement route, it is proposed to issue further prudential guidelines\nto be observed by banks.  These guidelines, inter alia , would cover: (i) the need for strengthening\nof internal rating systems, periodically tracking the rating changes in respect of issuers; (ii) fixing\nof prudential limits, with separate sub-limits for unrated, unquoted and privately placed\ninstruments; (iii) review by Board on total investments/disinvestments, regulatory compliance,\nrating changes in respect of issuers and non-performing investments; and (iv) disclosures in\n\u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 regarding issuer composition and non-performing investments.  A draft of\ndetailed operating guidelines are being issued separately, which will be finalised after further\nconsultation with banks and FIs.\n69. For effective risk management, it is necessary to put in place appropriate arrangements\nfor collecting and sharing of information regarding amounts of debt raised by corporates from the\nmarket, including through CPs, etc.   It is proposed to constitute a Working Group to evolve a\nframework for collecting and sharing by banks/FIs of information on private placement of debt\nwith CIB as a convenor, and representatives, inter alia,  of banks, FIs and RBI.  The proposed\nWorking Group will, inter alia , analyse the status in regard to existing stock of debt, and its use for\nthe purpose of evolving suitable guidelines in this regard. The Group will give its report in one\nmonth.\n70.  There is also a need for dissemination of information on secondary market trades in\nprivately placed debt and to this end, banks and FIs have already been advised that effective\nOctober 31, 2001, they will be permitted to make fresh investments and hold bonds and\ndebentures, privately placed or otherwise, only in dematerialised form.  Outstanding investments\nshould also be converted into demat form by June 2002. Transactions in such bonds could be\nreported by the National Securities Depository Limited/Central Depository Services Limited\n(NSDL/CDSL), with whom transfers of title are reported.  To enable the transparency of the\ntrades including nomenclature of the bonds, amount traded and the price at which traded, banks\nand FIs could evolve a reporting mechanism and the NSDL/CDSL can in turn disseminate such\ninformation to the market.\n71. The above arrangements would apply uniformly to all bonds issued by corporates, banks,\nFIs and State and Central Government sponsored institutions directly or as Special Purpose\nVehicles (SPVs). In regard to bonds guaranteed explicitly or implicitly through letters of comfort,\netc., mere availability of such guarantee should not determine the credit decision, and  banks and\nFIs should undertake due diligence on the intrinsic viability and bankability of  projects financed\nthrough issuance of such bonds.  This will go a long way in ensuring efficient use of resources\nmade available by banks and FIs, besides ensuring their creditworthiness.  Overall, any proposal\nof direct or indirect financing of  government budgets, directly or through SPVs should be\neschewed and proposals should be for specific monitorable projects, particularly in capital-\nintensive and high-cost sectors, including infrastructure.  Components of financing and returns\nneed to be well defined and assessed.\n (c) Transparency and Accounting Standards\n72.   Over a period, banks were advised to disclose in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 in the balance\nsheet, the details of the maturity pattern of loans and advances, investments, deposits and\nborrowings, movements in NPAs, exposure to sensitive sectors, etc.  As a further step in ensuring\ntransparency and credibility of their financial positions, it has been decided that   banks should\nfurnish the following additional disclosures in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 in their balance sheets,\nfrom the year ending March 2002: (i) movement of provisions held towards NPAs and (ii)\nmovement of provisions held towards depreciation on investments.\n73.  The Accounting Standards issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI)\nestablish the standards which have to be complied with by corporate entities so as to ensure that17\nthey present a true and fair view of the financial position of the entity.  These standards are\nperiodically being revised by ICAI, consistent with international accounting standards. Certain\ndifficulties in the adoption of the standards as finalised by the ICAI have been reported by banks.\nIt has, therefore, been decided to set up a Working Group comprising  representatives of ICAI,\nbanks and RBI  to identify the compliance as also gaps in compliance with the  accounting\nstandards and recommend steps to eliminate/reduce the gaps.\nSupervision and Monitoring\n74.     The Reserve Bank had introduced  in 1999 off-site returns to monitor liquidity and interest\nrate risks on quarterly basis with the intention to finally move over to a fortnightly reporting\nsystem.  The quarterly system has now  stabilised. Further progress made in respect of certain\nannouncements made in the annual policy Statement of April 2001 is reviewed below:\n? The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) released the second set of\nconsultative documents on  New Capital Accord.  RBI has forwarded its comments to\nBasel Committee, which have also been put on RBI website in May 2001.\n? A scheme of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA), based on  pre-determined trigger points, is\nplanned  as part of continued efforts  to enhance the existing supervisory framework.\nThe Reserve Bank, after examining the comments/suggestions received from scheduled\ncommercial banks on the scheme, has sought the  Government\u2019s  views before\nimplementation.\n? In order to involve banks in the smooth switch-over to Risk-based Supervision (RBS)\nprocess, the Reserve Bank has released a discussion paper seeking\ncomments/suggestions of experts/public.  The discussion paper highlights the initiatives\nand action required in setting up of a comprehensive risk management system, adoption\nof risk-based audit system, upgradation of management information and information\ntechnology systems, establishment of dedicated compliance units and resolving HRD and\ntraining related issues.  It is  planned to hold a pilot run of the RBS approach in due\ncourse.\nSettlement of Non-Performing Assets\n75. In July 1995, RBI had issued broad guidelines to scheduled commercial banks for\ncompromise or negotiated settlement of NPAs.  In May 1999, in order to facilitate settlement of\nNPAs in the small sector, the Reserve Bank issued guidelines for the constitution of Settlement\nAdvisory Committees (SACs) in public sector banks.  Banks had, however, represented that\nmuch progress could not be made in the recovery of NPAs despite setting up of SACs.\nAccordingly, in July 2000, in consultation with the Government, RBI had circulated simplified,\nnon-discretionary and non-discriminatory guidelines to provide a one-time impetus to reduction of\nthe stock of chronic NPAs by the recovery of dues relating to public sector banks which covered\naccounts upto Rs.5 crore in all sectors including the small scale sector, but excluded any cases of\nwillful default, fraud or malfeasance.  These guidelines specified the coverage of the scheme, the\nsettlement formula including the amount and cut-off date, and the manner of payment of the\nsettled dues.\n76. The settlement scheme laid out by these guidelines was operative till June 2001 and all\napplications received upto this date were to be processed by September 30, 2001.  Under this\nscheme, the public sector banks have recovered a total sum of Rs.2,192 crore in respect of 5.23\nlakh accounts as on July 30, 2001.\n77. Some representations have been received for further extension of the scheme.  Given\nthat the purpose of these guidelines was to provide an opportunity for \u201cone-time settlement\u201d within\nthe specified time period, and sufficient time has already been provided, it is not proposed to18\nextend this scheme.  However, the broad framework provided for settlement in the 1995\nguidelines will continue to be in place, and banks are free to design and implement their own\npolicies for recovery and write-off incorporating compromise and negotiated settlements with the\napproval of their Boards, particularly for old and unresolved cases falling under the NPA category.\nIn this respect, the experience with the one-time settlement scheme may also be taken into\naccount.  It is important, however, to ensure that any scheme formulated by bank Boards is\nsimple, non-discriminatory and transparent so that all eligible cases are accorded equal\ntreatment.\nUrban Co-operative Banks\n78. The annual policy Statement of April 2001 had announced a proposal to set up a new\nApex Supervisory Body to take over the entire inspection/supervisory functions relating to\nscheduled and non-scheduled Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) in consultation with the Central\nGovernment.  As a follow-up, after discussing various issues involved, RBI has submitted a draft\nBill on setting up of a separate Supervisory Authority to the Central Government.\n79. A Working Group constituted by the Reserve Bank to evolve asset-liability management\n(ALM) guidelines for UCBs has since submitted its Report.  The Reserve Bank has circulated the\nReport to select UCBs for their comments.  Based on the feedback, guidelines will be issued to\nscheduled UCBs.  In order to strengthen the supervisory mechanism, RBI has since introduced\noff-site monitoring system for scheduled UCBs.\n80.   In the annual policy Statement of April 2001, the UCBs were advised not to entertain any\nfresh proposals for lending directly or indirectly against security of shares either to individuals or\nany other entity and that such loans to individuals which had already been disbursed upto\npermissible amounts should continue only till the contracted date.  In response to representations\nreceived from UCBs and their federations, it is now proposed to allow UCBs to grant loans to\nindividuals against security of shares, subject to the following parameters:\n(i) Loans against shares/debentures may be granted to individuals to meet\ncontingencies and personal needs or for subscribing to rights or new issues of\nshares/debentures or for purchase in the secondary market.  Loans against\nprimary/collateral security of shares/debentures will be limited upto Rs.5 lakh, if the\nsecurity is in physical form, and upto Rs.10 lakh, if the security is in  demat form.\nAggregate of all such loans should be within the overall ceiling of 20.0 per cent of the\nowned funds of the bank, and margin of 40.0 per cent should be maintained in all\ncases of such loans .\n(ii) It is essential that before accepting shares as security, UCBs should put in place a\nrisk management system.   UCBs should also have Audit Committee of their Boards\nof Directors and all the approved loan proposals should be placed before the Audit\nCommittee at least once in two months.   Details of loans sanctioned should be\nreported to the Board in the subsequent Board meeting.  The Management and Audit\nCommittees should ensure that all loans against shares are made only to those\nindividuals who are not in any way connected with any stock-broking activity or stock-\nbroking entity.\n(iii) UCBs which have outstanding loans to individuals can renew them upto permissible\namounts beyond the contracted date on merits, subject to the  above conditions.\n(iv) As before, UCBs should ensure that there is no direct investment by them  in either\nprimary or secondary market under any circumstances.\n81.      As per the annual policy Statement of April 2001, UCBs were required to achieve certain\nhigher proportion of their SLR holding in the form of government and other approved securities as19\na percentage of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) by March 31, 2002.  UCBs and\ntheir federations have represented that, in current market conditions, many smaller UCBs were\nfacing genuine difficulties in adhering to the time schedule in achieving the prescribed levels of\nSLR holding.  In response to these representations, it is proposed to modify the time-frame for\nachieving the prescribed levels of SLR holding in the following manner:\nSLR Investments of UCBs: Revised Time-frame\nMinimum SLR holding in government and other approved securities as per\ncent of NDTL Category of UCBs\nPresent Earlier proposed for\nMarch 31, 2002Now proposed for\nMarch 31, 2002Now proposed\nfor September\n30,  2002\nNon-Scheduled UCBs\n1. UCBs with NDTL of\nRs.25 crore and above\n2.UCBs with NDTL of less\nthan Rs.25 crore10.0 %\nNil15.0 %\n 10.0 %12.5 %\n 7.5%15.0%\n10.0%\nScheduled UCBs 15.0 % 20.0 % 17.5 % 20.0%?\nIt is possible that a number of UCBs in any of the categories have already achieved as on\nOctober 20, 2001 or were nearer to the target set for end-March or end-September 2002.\nNotwithstanding the revision in the time-frame as proposed above, such UCBs are advised not to\nbring down their present level of SLR holding in government and other approved securities as a\nproportion of their NDTL.   \n82.  The Reserve Bank has already issued guidelines relating to capital adequacy norms to be\nfollowed by UCBs.  It is clarified that, under the existing guidelines, the scheduled UCBs are\nrequired to achieve the capital adequacy norms gradually by March 2004 and the non-scheduled\nUCBs by March 2005.  This time-table provides sufficient time for UCBs  to meet the prescribed\ncapital adequacy requirements, and UCBs are urged to gradually build up their owned capital in\nthe interest of their depositors.\nCredit Delivery Mechanism\n(a)   \u201cLoan System\u201d for Delivery of Bank Credit\n83.    RBI had introduced a \u201cLoan System\u201d for delivery of bank credit in April 1995 prescribing the\ncomposition of working capital finance into loan and cash credit components. The \u201cLoan System\u201d\nhas been extended in phases to cover larger number of borrowers and also a larger component\nof the working capital finance. At present, the \u201cLoan System\u201d is applicable to borrowers enjoying\nworking capital limit of Rs.10 crore and above from the banking system;  the loan component of\nthe working capital limit of such borrowers has been fixed at a high level of not less than 80 per\ncent.\n84.    The \u201cLoan System\u201d was introduced to minimise the risks of cash and liquidity management\non the part of the banking system, caused by volatile movements in cash credit component of\nworking capital. In the current environment of short-term investment opportunities available to\nboth corporates and banks, banks will henceforth have the freedom to change the composition of\nworking capital by increasing the cash credit component beyond 20 per cent, for working capital\nlimits of Rs.10 crore and above, if they so desire.  It is expected that banks will appropriately price20\neach of the two components of working capital finance, taking into account the impact of such\ndecisions on their cash and liquidity management.\n(b)  Consortium Arrangement for Food Credit\n85.   A Committee consisting of representatives of banks, RBI, Government of India and Food\nCorporation of India was constituted by the Reserve Bank for undertaking a review of the\nconsortium arrangement for food credit.  The Committee submitted its report in September 2001.\nThe Report of the Committee is under consideration in consultation with the concerned agencies\nand the Government.\n(c) Kisan Credit Cards\n86.    It has been observed that the introduction of Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) Scheme for eligible\nagricultural farmers has proved to be successful.  To accelerate the scheme to cover all eligible\nagricultural farmers within the next 3 years, the Reserve Bank has advised all banks about their\ntargets to be achieved for 2001-02.  During 2000-01, public sector banks had issued 23.90 lakh\nKCCs, close to the target and during the first quarter of 2001-02, they have issued 3.85 lakh\nKCCs.\nUniversal Banking\n87. It may be recalled that the policy regarding a pproach to Universal Banking was\nenunciated in the annual policy Statement of April 2000.  The salient operational and regulatory\nissues to be addressed by the financial institutions for conversion into a universal bank was also\ncommunicated by RBI through a circular dated April 28, 2001.  While no formal proposal has so\nfar been received by  RBI from any financial institution for transformation into a universal bank,\nsome of them have expressed their intent to move in this direction.  The Reserve Bank welcomes\nthe interest shown by some financial institutions in this regard and encourages them to formulate\nappropriate and detailed proposals for smooth conversion into universal banks, if they so wish.\nThe Reserve Bank intends to process applications promptly in the light of  considerations outlined\nin RBI\u2019s circular to FIs on approach to Universal Banking in April 2001.\n88. In processing a specific proposal, the overwhelming consideration of the Reserve Bank\nwill be to meet the strategic objectives of the concerned financial institution for meeting the varied\nneeds of different categories of customers, while at the same time ensuring healthy competition in\nthe financial system through transparent  and equitable regulatory framework applicable to all the\nparticipants in banking business.  It should, however, be recognised that the movement towards\nuniversal banking should foster stability and efficiency of the financial system, but by itself it\ncannot provide a viable or sustainable solution to the operational problems of individual\ninstitutions arising from low capitalisation, high level of NPAs, large asset\u2013liability mismatches,\nliquidity, etc.  While taking a flexible view on each application, the Reserve Bank will pay\nparticular attention to the primary need to ensure safety of public deposits, especially of small\ndepositors, and to promote the continued stability of the financial system as a whole, and of the\nbanking system in particular.\nNon-Banking Financial Companies\n89.   The Reserve Bank had received applications for Certificate of Registration (CoR) from\n36,505 Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), of which, 13,815 applications were approved\nand 18,355 were rejected as at the end of August 2001.  Only 776 NBFCs have been permitted to\naccept public deposits, of which 27 NBFCs were holding public deposits of Rs.50 crore and\nabove.\n 90. The companies whose applications for CoR have been rejected or the companies whose\nCoR has been cancelled, should continue to repay their deposits on due dates and dispose of21\ntheir financial assets within three years.  They are also advised to submit the returns at\nprescribed periodicity to RBI.\n91.    The ALM guidelines issued in June 2001 would become fully operational by March 31,\n2002. The NBFCs were, however, advised to commence trial run of the ALM process for the half\nyear ended September 30 and for the half year beginning October 2001. The NBFCs may bring\nto the notice of RBI any difficulties being faced  by them for appropriate consideration.\n92.   As pointed out in earlier policy  Statements, RBI places substantial importance to further\ndevelopment of the NBFC sector along prudent lines.  NBFCs are in a position to deliver credit to\nthe decentralised sector and to small borrowers at the local level in response to local\nrequirements, particularly for financing of transport and  other equipment.  RBI has, therefore,\nbeen discussing with the informal Advisory Group of NBFCs, and also with various NBFC\nassociations, the need to promote the formation of a Self Regulatory Organisation (SRO),\nparticularly for the benefit of smaller NBFCs. So far, there has not been much progress by the\nNBFC sector in finalising a scheme for formation of SRO.  RBI would continue with its efforts to\nencourage the NBFC sector to devise a viable mechanism for instituting a self regulatory system\nfor this sector.\nTechnology Upgradation\n93. In order to bring improvements in the payment and settlement system, some important\nmeasures taken by the Reserve Bank were announced in the annual policy Statement of April\n2001. To facilitate banks to effectively participate in the payment and settlement systems and to\nprovide a road map of the various payment system projects, a draft Payment System Vision\nDocument was prepared; based on the feedback received from banks and comments of the\nmembers of apex bodies such as the National Payments Council, the Vision Document is being\nfinalised. The other steps being taken up include the use of \u201cimaging\u201d of cheques as a precursor\nfor cheque truncation, which would be facilitated by the recommendations of the Working Group\non amendments to the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and the introduction of internet banking\nservices.\n94.   With a view to further improve the technology based infrastructure of  banks  and  also\nenable  them  to  effectively  use  the facilities offered by the Reserve Bank in the payment and\nsettlement system, the following further measures are proposed:\n? The Indian Financial Network (INFINET) is already available for use by all banks and\ncommon inter-bank applications are being implemented on this network.  Banks have to\ntake necessary steps to further strengthen their infrastructure base in respect of\nstandardisation, high levels of security and communication and networking to  make full\nuse of these resources.\n? If the benefits of the common inter-bank applications have to be fully realised, it is\nessential that connectivity of computers  located at different branches of banks is\nachieved early.  To begin with, it should be the endeavour of banks to achieve the goal of\nconnectivity of commercially important centres.  This will facilitate connectivity to the\nINFINET for achieving inter-city, inter-bank message transfer in a network environment\non a real time basis.\n? One of the systems provided by the Reserve Bank for quick, safe and secure movement\nof funds in an electronic mode is the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).  At present, the\nscheme is available for transfer of funds across about 8,500 branches of banks located at\nmajor commercial centres.  It is essential that concerted efforts are taken by banks to\npopularise the usage of this scheme which would result in quick funds transfer for clients,\nlesser reconciliation problems at banks and improve systemic efficiency.22\nRationalisation of Current Account Facility\nby the Reserve Bank\n95.   Since banks having large network of branches are the eventual payment service providers to\nthe rest of the non-banking community and also the essential conduits, apart from PDs, through\nwhich RBI effects its LAF and in the context of the recommendations of the Technical Group on\nphasing out of non-banks from call/ notice money  market,  a need was felt to rationalise/review\nthe present policy of  current account facility provided by RBI. Further, the operationalisation of\nthe CCIL and the proposed implementation of NDS would also obviate the need for having\ncurrent account with RBI by some of the non-bank entities. To look into all the above aspects, an\ninternal Group was set up which has since  submitted its Report. The Report has been placed on\nRBI\u2019s website and a copy of the Report has also been sent to all the current account holders for\ntheir comments.  These recommendations are also being examined by the Reserve Bank.\nLegal Reforms\n96.    It may be recalled that in the annual policy Statement of April 2001, major legal reforms\ninitiated in the banking sector covering areas such as security laws, Negotiable Instruments Act,\nfraud on banks, regulatory framework of banking, etc., were indicated.  Further progress in regard\nto various initiatives for legal reforms is given below:\n? The Working Group constituted by the Government for suggesting changes in the\nprovisions of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, to bring it in conformity with the\nInformation Technology Act, 2000 and also to examine the incorporation of electronic\ncheque, securitised certificates and other evolving products within the ambit of\nNegotiable Instruments Act has since submitted its recommendations to the Government\nin June 2001.  The Group, inter alia , recommended the introduction of truncation of\ncheques and electronic cheques and suggested appropriate legal amendments.\n? The Working Group on Asset Securitisation has drafted a Bill on Asset Securitisation\nwhich is under consideration of the Government.\n? The draft legislation prepared by another Working Group constituted by the Government\nto examine the vesting of powers with banks and FIs for taking possession and sale of\nsecurities without intervention of the courts has been put on the RBI Website in August\n2001 seeking comments from the   public. The draft Bill is under the consideration of the\nGovernment.\n? Proposals regarding amendments to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, Banking\nRegulation Act, 1949, Government Securities Bill in replacement of the Public Debt Act,\n1944, are currently under consideration of the Government.\n? In order to improve the legal system relating to payments in India, the Legal Task Force\nof the National Payments Council submitted a set of recommendations for preparing a\nnew legislation for regulating the payment systems in India.  For drafting a legislation on\nPayment Systems in India, an international consultant  and an eminent Indian draftsman\nhave been appointed by  RBI   in consultation with the National Payments Council.\n? An Expert Committee on Bank Frauds (Chairman: Dr.N.L. Mitra) submitted its Report to\nRBI in September 2001 which has been put on the RBI website. The Committee\nexamined and suggested both the preventive and curative aspects of bank frauds.  The\nimportant recommendations of the Committee include: a need for including financial fraud\nas a criminal offence and  amendments to the Indian Penal Code by including a new\nchapter on financial fraud;  amendments to the Indian Evidence Act to shift the burden of\nproof on the accused person and special provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure for\ntransferring the properties involved in the financial fraud and confiscating unlawful gains;23\nand preventive measures including the development of Best Code Procedures by banks\nand FIs.  The Report is being examined by the Reserve Bank.\n? Proposal to repeal the existing DICGC Act and replace it with a new Act is under\nconsideration.\n? Financial Companies Regulation Bill providing for a separate enactment in place of\nChapter III B and Chapter III C of the Reserve Bank of India Act and amendments to\nBanking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertaking)  Acts, 1970 & 1980\nbringing down the equity holding of the Government in the nationalised banks and also\nfor enabling financial restructuring of weak banks have been introduced in the Lok\nSabha.\nInternational Financial Standards and Codes\n97. The annual policy Statement of April 2001 mentioned about the significant progress\nmade by the Advisory Groups on International Financial Standards and Codes.  All the Advisory\nGroups constituted by the Standing Committee on International Financial Standards and Codes\nhave submitted their Reports to the Chairman of the Standing Committee and these reports are\nplaced on RBI Website www.rbi.org.in  for wider dissemination.  Copies of the Reports are being\nsent to various experts, economists, professionals, academicians, banks and institutions for their\ncomments. The Chairmen of individual Advisory Groups have been requested to explore the\npossibility of organising seminars on the themes. The Standing Committee will also prepare its\nown report indicating, inter alia,  the course of follow-up/reforms required and the regulatory\nagencies involved in such follow-up actions.\nMumbai\nOctober 22, 2001\n                                           ?

It is of utmost importance to take measures to ensure that sickness is arrested\nat the incipient stage itself. The branch officials should keep a close watch on the\noperations in the account and take adequate measures to achieve this objective.  The\nmanagements of the units financed should be advised about their primary\nresponsibility to inform the banks if they face problems which could lead to sickness\nand to restore the units to normal health. The organizational arrangements at branch\nlevel should also be fully geared for early detection of sickness and prompt remedial\naction. Banks/Financial Institutions will have to identify the units showing symptoms\nof sickness by effective monitoring and provide additional finance, if warranted, so as\nto bring back the units to a healthy track. An illustrative list of warning signals of\nincipient sickness that are thrown up during the scrutiny of borrowal accounts and\nother related records e.g. periodical financial data, stock statements, reports on\ninspection of factory premises and godowns, etc. is given in Appendix-I  which will\nserve as a useful guide to the operating personnel. Further, the system of asset\nclassification introduced in banks will be useful for detecting advances which are\ndeteriorating in quality well in time.  When an advance slips into the sub-standardcategory, as per norms, the branch should make full enquiry into the financial health\nof the unit, its operations, etc. and take remedial action.  The branch officials who are\nfamiliar with the day-to-day operations in the borrowal accounts should be under\nobligation to identify the early warning signals and initiate corrective steps promptly.\nSuch steps may include  providing  timely  financial  assistance depending on\nestablished need, if it is within the powers of the branch manager, and an early\nreference to the controlling office where the relief required are beyond his delegated\npowers.  The branch manager should also help the unit in sorting out difficulties\nwhich are non-financial in nature and require assistance from outside agencies like\nGovernment departments / undertakings, Electricity Boards, etc. He should also keep\nthe term lending institutions informed about the position of the units wherever they\nare also involved.\n2. The instructions issued to banks by RBI to set up cells at all regional centers,\nbesides at Head Office, to deal with sick industrial units and also provide expert staff\nincluding technical personnel to such cells are reiterated.\n3.  Definition of Sick SSI Unit\nAn SSI unit should be considered ' Sick' if\na) any of the borrowal accounts of the unit remains substandard for more\nthan six months i.e. principal or interest, in respect of any of its borrowal\naccounts has remained overdue for a period exceeding one year. The requirement\nof overdue period exceeding one year will remain unchanged even if the present\nperiod for classification of an account as sub-standard, is reduced in due course;\nor\nb) there is erosion in the net worth due to accumulated losses to the extent of\n50 per cent of its net worth during the previous accounting year;     \nand\nc) the unit has been in commercial produc tion for at least  two years.\nThis would enable banks to take action at an early stage for revival of the units.  The\nabove definition may be adopted for the purpose of reporting the  data  for the half-\nyear ending 31 March 2002, while  for the purpose of formulating nursing\nprogramme,  banks should go by the above definition with immediate effect.4.  Viability of Sick SSI Units\nA unit may be regarded as potentially viable if it would be in a position, after\nimplementing a relief package spread over a period not exceeding five years from the\ncommencement of the package from banks, financial institutions, Government  (\nCentral / State ) and  other  concerned  agencies,  as  may  be necessary,  to  continue\nto  service its repayment  obligations as agreed upon including those forming part of\nthe package, without the help of the concessions after the aforesaid period. The\nrepayment period for restructured (past) debts should not exceed seven years from the\ndate of implementation of the package. In the case of tiny/ decentralised sector units,\nthe period of reliefs/concessions and repayment period of restructured debts which\nwere hitherto, two years and three years respectively have been revised, so as not to\nexceed  five and seven years respectively, as in the case of other SSI units. Based on\nthe norms specified above, it will be for the banks/financial institutions to decide\nwhether a sick SSI unit is potentially viable or not. Viability of a unit identified as\nsick, should be decided quickly and made known to the unit and others concerned at\nthe earliest. The rehabilitation package should be fully implemented within six\nmonths from the date the unit is declared as 'potentially viable' / 'viable'. While\nidentifying and implementing the rehabilitation package, banks/ FIs are advised to do\n\u2018holding operation' for a period of six months. This will allow small-scale units to\ndraw funds from the cash credit account at least to the extent of their deposit of sale\nproceeds during the period of such \u2018holding operation'.\n5.  Reliefs and Concessions for\n     Rehabilitation of Potentially Viable Units\nIt is emphasised that only those units which are considered to be potentially viable\nshould be taken up for rehabilitation. The reliefs and concessions specified  are not  to\nbe given in a routine manner and have to be decided by concerned bank/financial\ninstitution based on the commercial judgment and merits of each case. Banks have\nalso the freedom to extend reliefs and concessions beyond the parameters in deserving\ncases.  Only in exceptional cases , concessions/ reliefs beyond the parameters should\nbe considered.  In fact, the viability study itself should contain a sensitivity analysis in\nrespect of the risks involved that in turn will enable firming up of the corrective actionmatrix. Norms for grant of reliefs and concessions by banks/financial institutions to\npotentially viable sick SSI units for rehabilitation are furnished in Appendix-II.\n6. Units becoming sick on account of wilful mismanagement, wilful default,\nunauthorized diversion of funds, disputes among partners / promoters, etc. should not\nbe considered for rehabilitation and steps should be taken for recovery of bank\u2019s dues.\nThe definition of wilful default, as given by RBI vide its Circular DBOD\nNo.BC.DL.(W)12/20.016.002(1)98-99  dated 20 February 1999,  will broadly cover\nthe following:\na) Deliberate non-payment of the dues despite adequate cash  flow and\ngood networth.\nb) Siphoning off of funds to the detriment of the defaulting unit.\nc) Assets financed have either not been purchased or have been sold\nand proceeds have been misutilised.\nd) Misrepresentation/falsification of records.\ne) Disposal/removal of securities without bank's knowledge.\nf) Fraudulent transactions by the borrower.\nThe views of the lending FI/banks in regard to wilful mismanagement of\nfunds/defaults will be treated as final.\n7.  Delegation of Powers\nThe delay in the implementation of agreed rehabilitation packages should be reduced.\nOne of the factors contributing to such delay was found to be the time taken for\nobtaining clearance from the Controlling Office for the relief and concessions.  As it\nis essential to accelerate the process of clearance, the banks and the financial\ninstitutions may delegate sufficient powers to senior officers at various levels such as\ndistrict, divisional, regional, zonal and also at head office to sanction the bank's or the\nfinancial institution's commitment to its share in the rehabilitation package drawn up\nin conformity with the prescribed guidelines.APPENDIX-I\nIllustrative list of warning signals of incipient sickness that\nare thrown up during the Scrutiny of Borrowal Accounts and other Related\nRecords (e.g. Periodical Financial Data, Statements,\nReport on Inspection of Factory Premises and Godowns, etc.)\na) Continuous irregularities in cash credit/overdraft accounts such as inability to\nmaintain stipulated margin on continuous basis or drawings frequently exceeding\nsanctioned limits, periodical interest debited remaining unrealised;\nb) Outstanding balance in cash credit account remaining continuously at the\nmaximum;\nc) Failure to make timely payment of instalments of principal and interest on term\nloans;\nd) Complaints from suppliers of raw materials, water, power, etc. about non-\npayment of bills;\ne) Non-submission or undue delay in submission or submission of incorrect stock\nstatements and other control statements;\nf) Attempts to divert sale proceeds through accounts with other banks;\ng) Downward trend in credit summations;\nh) Frequent return of cheques or bills;\ni) Steep decline in production figures;\nj) Downward trends in sales and fall in profits;\nk) Rising level of inventories, which may include large proportion of slow or non-\nmoving items;\nl) Larger and longer outstandings in bill accounts;\nm) Longer period of credit allowed on sale documents negotiated through the bank\nand frequent return by the customers of the same as also allowing large discount\non sales;\nn) Failure to pay statutory liabilities;\no) Utilisation of funds for purposes other than running the units.APPENDIX -II\nRelief and concessions which can be extended by\nbanks/financial institutions to potentially viable\nsick SSI units under rehabilitation\nThe viability and the rehabilitation of a sick SSI unit would depend primarily on the\nunit\u2019s ability to continue to service its repayment obligations including the past\nrestructured debts. It is, therefore, essential to ensure that ordinarily there is no write-\noff or scaling down of debt such as by reduction in rate of interest with retrospective\neffect except to the extent indicated in the guidelines.  The guidelines on various\nparameters on reliefs and concessions are given below.\ni) Interest Dues on Cash Credit and Term Loan\nIf penal rates of interest or damages have been charged, such charges should be\nwaived from the accounting year of the unit in which it started incurring cash losses\ncontinuously. After this is done, the unpaid interest on term loans and cash credit\nduring this period should be segregated from the total liability and funded. No interest\nmay be charged on funded interest and repayment of such funded interest should be\nmade within a period not exceeding three years from the date of commencement of\nimplementation of the rehabilitation programme.\nii) Unadjusted Interest Dues\nUnadjusted interest dues such as interest charged between the date up to which\nrehabilitation package was prepared and the date from which actually implemented,\nmay also be funded on the same terms as at ( i) above.\niii) Term Loans\nThe rate of interest on term loans may be reduced, where considered necessary, by not\nmore than three per cent in the case of tiny/ decentralised sector units and by not more\nthan two per cent for other SSI units, below the document rate.\niv) Working Capital Term Loan  (WCTL )\nAfter the unadjusted interest portion of the cash credit account is segregated as\nindicated at ( i) and (ii) above, the balance representing principal dues may be treated\nas irregular to the extent it exceeds drawing power. This amount may be funded asWorking Capital Term Loan ( WCTL) with a repayment schedule not exceeding 5\nyears. The rate of interest applicable may be 1.5 % to 3% points below the prevailing\nfixed rate / prime lending rate, wherever applicable, to all sick SSI units including tiny\nand decentralized units.\nv) Cash Losses\nCash losses are likely to be incurred in the initial stages of the rehabilitation\nprogramme till the unit reaches the break-even level. Such cash losses excluding\ninterest as may be incurred during the nursing programme may also be financed by\nthe bank or the financial institution, if only one of them is the financier. But if both\nare involved in the rehabilitation package, the financial institution concerned should\nfinance such cash losses. Interest may be charged on the funded amount at the rates\nprescribed by SIDBI under its scheme for rehabilitation assistance.\nFuture cash losses in this context will refer to losses from the time of implementation\nof the package up to the point of cash break-even as projected.  Future cash losses as\nabove, should be worked out before interest  (i.e., after excluding interest) on working\ncapital etc., due to the banks and should be financed by the financial institutions if it is\none of the financiers of the unit. In other words, the financial institutions should not\nbe asked to provide for interest due to the banks in the computation of future cash\nlosses and this should be taken care of by future cash accruals.\nThe interest due to the bank should be funded by it separately. Where, however, a\ncommercial bank alone is the financier, the future cash losses including interest will\nbe financed by it.\nThe interest on the funded amounts of cash losses/interest will be at the rates\nprescribed by Small Industries Development Bank of India under its scheme for\nrehabilitation assistance.\nvi) Working Capital\nInterest on working capital may be charged at 1.5% below the prevailing fixed / prime\nlending rate wherever applicable.   Additional working capital limits may be extended\nat a rate not exceeding the PLR.vii) Contingency Loan Assistance\nFor meeting escalations in capital expenditure to be incurred under the rehabilitation\nprogramme, banks/financial institutions may provide, where considered necessary,\nappropriate additional financial assistance upto 15 per cent of the estimated cost of\nrehabilitation by way of contingency loan assistance. Interest on this contingency\nassistance may be charged at the concessional rate allowed for working capital\nassistance.\nviii) Funds for Start-up Expenses and Margin for Working Capital\nThere will be need to provide the unit under rehabilitation with funds for start-up\nexpenses (including payment of pressing creditors) or margin money for working\ncapital in the form of long-term loans. Where a financial institution is not involved,\nbanks may provide the loan for start-up expenses, while margin money assistance\nmay either come from SIDBI under its Refinance Scheme for Rehabilitation or should\nbe provided by State Government where it is operating a Margin Money Scheme.\nInterest on fresh rehabilitation term loan may be charged at a rate 1.5% below the\nprevailing fixed / prime lending rate wherever applicable or as prescribed by SIDBI /\nNABARD  where refinance is obtained from it for the purpose.\nAll interest rate concessions would be subject to annual review depending on the\nperformance of the units .\nx)  Promoters' Contribution\nAs per the extant RBI guidelines, promoter's contribution towards the rehabilitation\npackage is fixed at a minimum of 10 per cent of the additional long term requirements\nunder the rehabilitation package in the case of tiny sector units and at 20 per cent of\nsuch requirements for other units. In the case of units in the decentralized sector,\npromoter\u2019s contribution may not be insisted upon. A need is felt for increasing the\npromoters' contribution towards rehabilitation from the present limits.   It is, therefore,\nopen to banks and financial institutions to stipulate a higher promoters' contribution\nwhere warranted. At least 50 per cent of the above promoters' contribution should be\nbrought in immediately and the balance within six months. For arriving at promoters'\ncontribution, the monetary value of the sacrifices from banks, financial institutionsand Government may be taken into account, in addition to the long - term\nrequirement  of  funds  under  the  rehabilitation  package.\nWhile evolving packages, it should be made a precondition that the promoters should\nbring in their contribution within the stipulated time frame. Further, in regard to\nconcessions and relief made available to sick units, banks should incorporate a \u2018Right\nof Recompense' clause in the sanction letter and other documents to the effect that\nwhen such units turn the corner and rehabilitation is successfully completed, the\nsacrifices undertaken by the Fls and banks should be recouped from the units out of\ntheir future profits/ cash accruals.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/23987.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 20, 2001", "info": "Prudential off-site surveillance system  ( PSRS) for Financial Institutions ( FIs)-\nRevision of Returns Formats\nREF.

Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(K. C. Bandyopadhyay)\nChief General Manager1\nGuidelines for Classification and Valuation  of Investments \u2013 Clarifications / Modifications\nS.\nNo.Present norms of RBI Suggestion / query Clarification / modification\n1. Definition of Joint Ventures\nThe Joint Ventures have been\ndefined as one in which the FI,\nalong with its subsidiaries, holds\nmore than 25% of the equity.\nOur instructions also permit\nunlimited inclusion of all equity\nholdings  of FIs in its subsidiaries\njoint ventures as defined above in\nthe \u201cHeld to Maturity\u201d category,\neven though equity shares, by\ndefinition, have no maturity.FIs could acquire equity in the\nborrower companies in excess of 25%\nalso through conversion  of loans,\nventure capital  assistance, etc., but as\nper the prescribed definition, such\ncases would be deemed to be joint\nventures and would necessarily have to\nbe placed in the HTM category. It is\ntherefore, suggested that such\ninvestments   should not be classified\nin the HTM category  but may be\nincluded in one of the six sub-\ncategories of the AFS or HFT\nclassification as per the nature of  the\ninstrumentA Joint Venture would be an entity in\nwhich a FI (along with the holdings, if any,\nby its subsidiary) holds more than 25% of\nequity capital pursuant to a Joint Venture\nagreement  duly entered into between /\namongst the FI and the joint venture\npartner(s) for furtherance of a commercial\nobjective. Besides, the companies floated\nby the FIs and in which the FI (along with\nthe holdings, if any, by its subsidiaries)\nholds more than 25 per cent of the equity\nshare capital, would also be classified as a\nJoint Venture.\nOnly such equity holdings, as also the\nequity held in subsidiaries, should be\nplaced in the HTM category \u2013 and not\nwhere a FI, along with its subsidiaries,\nacquires equity in excess of 25% on\naccount of conversion of loan, venture\ncapital assistance, etc.\n2. Treatment of preference shares\nAt present, the preference shares\nare not explicitly permitted to be\nincluded in the HTM category.The preference shares, if held in the\nHTM category, should also be\nexcluded from the prescribed ceiling of\n25% (of total investments) on HTM\ncategory investments on par with\ndebentures / bonds deemed to be in the\nnature of advance.The preference shares, other than\nconvertible preference shares, on account\nof their definite maturity period, may be\nincluded in the HTM category, regardless\nof their period of maturity, subject to the\nfollowing.\nThe preference shares, other than\nconvertible preference shares, acquired as a\npart of project financing and meeting the\nextant criteria for treating the bonds and\ndebentures as \u2018in the nature of advance\u2019,\nshould be treated in the nature of advance.2\nSuch preference shares would also not be\ncounted for the purpose of the ceiling of\n25% on the investments in the HTM\ncategory.\nSuch preference shares should be valued by\nnotionally extending to them the asset-\nclassification of the outstanding loans of\nthe issuing company and provision for\ndepreciation in the value of preference\nshares made accordingly. In case the said\nloans are in the standard category,\nprovision as per norms applicable to the\nstandard loan assets would be required for\nthe depreciation in the value of these\nshares. In case the loans are in the doubtful\ncategory, the preference shares held should\nbe treated as an unsecured facility and fully\nprovided for.\nAll other preference shares, if kept in the\nHTM category, should be reckoned within\nthe ceiling of 25% for the investments in\nthe HTM category. Such shares should be\nvalued at the acquisition cost unless\nacquired at a premium, in which case they\nshould be valued at the amortised cost. Any\ndiminution, other than temporary, in value\nof these shares should be determined and\nprovided for each investment individually\nand should not be set off against\nappreciation in other preference shares.\n3. Tenor of bonds/ debentures\ndeemed to be in the nature of\nadvance\nThe extant norms require\ndebentures / bonds issued as part\nof project finance with a tenor of\nthree years and above  or those\nissued as part of working capital\nfinance with tenor of less than\none year,  through private\nplacement with FI\u2019s stake of 10%\nor more in the issue, to be treated\nin the nature of advance. SuchThe borrowers issue privately placed\ndebentures for meeting project cost ,\nworking capital  needs, as part of debt\nrestructuring. Often, debentures of\nmore than one-year  maturity are\nprivately placed for meeting long term\nworking capital  requirements. Such\ndebentures are \u201cnormally\u201d in the\nnature of credit  and are held by the FIs\ntill maturity. Hence, these should be\ntreated as advance irrespective  of theirIt is difficult to accept the suggestion since\nany instrument issued by a company and\nplaced privately, say, CPs, CDs, could be\nargued to be in the nature of credit since all\nsuch instruments are fixed charge bearing\nliabilities of the issuer. Hence, the\nargument  could as well be extended to\nseveral other instruments too and not only\nto the privately placed debentures and\nbonds. As such, the suggestion is not\nacceptable.3\nbonds / debentures, though\nincluded in the HTM category,\nare not counted for the purpose of\n25% ceiling on the HTM\ncategory of investments.tenor (maturity) and purpose.\nThe RBI guidelines should not\ndifferentiate between project finance\ndebentures and working capital finance\ndebentures. All long term debentures\nwith maturity more than 3 years,\nshould be deemed to be in the nature of\nadvance and included in the HTM\ncategory, since these are primarily in\nthe nature of loans and are subject to\nthe same level of due diligence,\nappraisal, documentation, etc., as a\nnormal loan.Reckoning the predominantly long- term\nnature of loan assets of the FIs, it has been\ndecided to  modify the guidelines  to\nremove the exemption available at present\nfrom the 25% ceiling for the HTM category\nof investments in respect of the debentures\nacquired by FIs as part of working capital\nfinance with maturity of less than one year.\nThus, only the debentures / bonds with\ntenor of three years and more , acquired\nthrough private placement, with the FI\nholding at least 10% stake in the issue,\nwould be deemed to be in the nature of\nadvance and could be included in the HTM\ncategory and excluded for the purpose of\n25% ceiling on the HTM  category.\nAll debentures/ bonds of less than three-\nyear tenor,  therefore, should be placed in\nthe AFS or HFT category; such debentures,\nif kept in the HTM category, should be\nreckoned within the 25% ceiling.\n4. Frequency of inter-category\ntransfer of investments :\nAt present, the shifting among\ncategories is permitted only once\na year, normally at the beginning\nof the accounting year, with the\napproval of the Board of the FI.Shifting of investments from / to HTM\ncategory be permitted twice in a year\ninstead of once a year as prescribed at\npresent.The suggestion is not acceptable  as it\nwould lead to arbitraging in the regulatory\nprovisioning requirement.\n5-a Eligible investments for HTM\nCategory :\nAt present, only debt securities,\nwhich have a definite maturity,\nare intended to be included in the\nHTM category. Besides, equity\ninvestments in subsidiaries and\njoint ventures are permitted\nwithout any ceiling  in the HTM\ncategory.It is presumed that the equity shares of\ncompanies other than joint venture/\nsubsidiaries and units of mutual and\nother funds can also be categorised\nunder HTM category.In keeping with the international norms,\nonly debt securities are to be classified\nunder the HTM category.  The only\nexceptions permitted are the equity held in\nthe subsidiaries and joint ventures, apart\nfrom preference shares now permitted as\nat item 2 above. As such, the question of\nincluding equity of other companies and the\nunits of open-ended schemes of  mutual\nfunds in the HTM category does not arise.\n5-b Valuation of equity in HTM4\ncategory\nThe other-than-temporary\ndiminution in the value of equity\nheld in subsidiaries / joint\nventures, which are included in\nthe HTM category, is required to\nbe determined and provided for\neach investment, individually.Valuation of equity and of units of\nopen ended unit schemes need not be\ndone at amortised cost, as these have\nno maturity.In view of our comments at 5(a) above, the\nquestion becomes redundant.\nIt is, however, clarified that the equity\nholdings in the nature of advance should be\ncompulsorily placed in the \u2018Available\nFor Sale\u2019 category . Such equity should be\nvalued by notionally extending to it the\nasset-classification of the outstanding loans\nof the issuing company and provision for\ndepreciation in the value of equity made\naccordingly. In case the said loans are in\nthe standard category, provision as\napplicable to the standard loan assets would\nbe required for the depreciation in the\nequity value but in case the loans are in the\ndoubtful category, the equity held should be\ntreated as an unsecured facility and fully\nprovided for.\n6. Period of pendency of dues:\nWhere interest/ principal is in\narrears on securities included in\nany of the three categories, the FI\nshould not reckon income on\nsecurities and also provide for\ndepreciation in the value of\ninvestment.It is presumed that the definition of\narrears of interest / principal in respect\nof securities would be as per the extant\nprudential norms viz., 2 and 4 quarters\nfor interest and principal respectively.The period of pendency of dues should be\nreckoned as per the extant prudential\nnorms. With effect from the year ending 31\nMarch 2002, the overdue period for the\nprincipal amount has been reduced to 180\ndays only, vide our Circular no. C-23 dated\n24 April 2001. This change would also\napply to the arrears of principal in respect\nof securities.\n7. Valuation of preference shares:\nThe preference shares should be\nvalued on YTM basis, with the\nYTM arrived at with appropriate\nmark up over the YTM rates for\nCentral Government securities, as\nnotified by FIMMDA/ PDAI.\nHowever, our instructions are\nsilent regarding the impact of the\ntax-free nature of the dividend on\nthe preference shares, in the\nhands of the holder of these\nshares..YTM rates for valuation of preference\nshares should be lower than the YTM\nfor the debt instruments since\npreference dividend is tax-free in the\nhands of the investors ( FIs). Hence,\nYTM used for preference share\nvaluation should be discounted by the\nmarginal tax rate of the FI.It is clarified that the guidelines framed by\nFIMMDA for valuation of tax-free bonds\nshould be followed for valuation of\nunquoted preference shares, other than\nthose kept in the HTM category, as per the\nfollowing procedure:\na) Gross up the nominal (tax-free)\ndividend rate on the preference shares\nby the marginal income tax rate of the\nFI \u2013 which might change from year-to-\nyear \u2013 to get the cum-tax dividend rate\n;5\nb) Find the YTM of the GoI security of\nthe equal residual maturity from the\nrates declared by FIMMDA;\nc) Add the applicable credit spread / risk\npremium (as per the rating of the\npreference shares) specified by\nFIMMDA for that risk category, to the\nYTM of the GoI security arrived at\nstep (b) above.\nd) In case of unrated preference shares ,\nthe  credit spread / risk premium to be\nadded to the YTM of the GoI security\narrived at (b) above, should be\ndetermined in the following manner:\n(i) In case the company issuing\nunrated preference shares has any\nother rated instruments which are\noutstanding, then a rating one full-\nnotch below that rating should be\narrived at. (For instance, for a \u2018AAA\u2019\nrating, only \u2018AA\u2019 rating should be\nreckoned.). In case more than one\nrated instrument issued by the\ncompany is outstanding, then the\nrating of that instrument which has\nbeen assigned the rating most\nrecently, should be reckoned.  The\nrisk spread corresponding to such\nrating, as announced by FIMMDA,\nwould be the spread to be added to the\nYTM of the GoI security.\n(ii) In case, no other instrument of the\ncompany issuing the preference shares\nhas been rated and is outstanding, then\na credit spread not less than the spread\napplicable to a bond of minimum\ninvestment grade, i.e., a \u2018BBB\u2019 rated\nbond, would be the spread to be added\nto the YTM  of the GoI security.\ne) Compare the grossed up/ cum-tax6\ndividend rate of step (a) above with the\nrisk-adjusted YTM of the preference\nshare arrived at step (c) or (d) above\nand use the higher  of the two rates as\nthe effective YTM for valuation of the\npreference share.\n8. Ceiling on YTM valuation of\npreference shares:\nThe norms do not permit the\nvaluation of preference shares\nabove their redemption value,\neven if the YTM valuation\nhappens to be above the\nredemption value.The valuation of preference shares\nshould be strictly on YTM basis even\nif the YTM valuation results in a value\nhigher then the redemption value.Reckoning that the valuation methodology\nprescribed by us for the unquoted\npreference shares is quite refined, the\nrestriction of NOT valuing the preference\nshares above their redemption value stands\nwithdrawn. Accordingly, the unquoted\npreference shares should be valued strictly\non YTM basis even if such valuation results\nin a value higher then the redemption value.\n9(a) Definition of \u201cquoted\u201d shares:\nOur guidelines are silent\nregarding the definition of\n\u201cunquoted\u201d equity shares. Clarification is sought as to how old\nquotation could be considered to be\n\u201ccurrent\u201d quotations for deciding\nwhether the share is quoted.It is clarified that for an equity share, if the\nlatest market quotation available, as at the\ndate of valuation, is more than 30 day-old,\nit may be considered to be an unquoted\ninvestment and valued at break up value,\nas prescribed.\nFurthermore, the market price for valuation\nof quoted equity shares should not be\nderived from a solitary trade for a small-\nvolume transaction but should be the price\nobserved for a reasonable volume of\ntransaction between two independent\nparties in an arms-length relationship.\nThe \u2018thinly traded shares\u2019 should be\nidentified and valued as detailed below.\nThinly traded equity shares / equity\nrelated securities\u2019(such as convertible\ndebentures, equity warrants, etc):\nThe \u2018thinly traded equity / equity related\nsecurities\u2019 would be those for which the\ntrading in a month is for less than Rs. 5\nlakh or the total trading volume is less than\n50,000 shares.7\nWhere the stock exchange concerned\nidentifies such securities as per the\nforegoing criteria and publishes / provides\nsuch information for the preceding calendar\nmonth alongwith the daily quotations, such\nlatest  quotations should be used for\nvaluation of such shares.\nIn case the equity is listed on a stock\nexchange which does not provide such\ninformation, the FIs may undertake their\nown analysis as per above criteria to\ndetermine whether the share is a thinly\ntraded one. If so, the latest available\nquotation should be used for valuation.\n9(b) The age of the \u201clatest\u201d balance\nsheet:\nThe unquoted equity shares or\nwhere current quotations are not\navailable, are required to be\nvalued at \u201cbreak up\u201d value\nderived from the company\u2019s\nlatest balance sheet. Such balance\nsheet should NOT be older than\none year from the date of\nvaluation. In case, the latest\nbalance sheet is not available, the\nshares should be valued at Re.1/-\nper company.The break up value of unlisted\ncompanies may be determined as per\nthe latest balance sheet which should\nnot be more than 21 month old as\nagainst the present prescription of not\nmore than one year prior to the date of\nvaluation. The suggestion is relevant\nfor the companies which close their\nannual accounts on dates other than 31\nMarch.In view of the genuine operational\nproblems, it has been decided to modify the\nguidelines to provide that in respect of\ncompanies which close their annual\naccounts on dates other than 31 March, the\nlatest balance sheet used for determining\nthe break up value should not be older\nthan 21 months , as on the date of\nvaluation, failing which, the equity shares\nshould be valued @ Re. 1/- per  company.\n10. The ceiling of 25% on the HTM\ncategory:\nUnder the norms, the investments\nincluded in the HTM category\nshould not exceed 25% of the\ntotal investments.It has been suggested that in view of\nvery small investment portfolio of FIs\ncompared to the banks, 25% ceiling on\nHTM category, is too restrictive and\ndoes not provide scope for inclusion of\nlong-term equity investments in the\nHTM category. Hence, it has been\npleaded that the equity investments\nand bonds/ debentures deemed to be in\nthe nature of advance, should be\ncompulsorily included in the HTM\ncategory. Otherwise, the ceiling of\n25% on the HTM category be raised toAs already stated above at item 5(a) above,\nonly debt securities are to be included in\nthe HTM category, in keeping with the\ninternational norms. The permitted\nexceptions are equity in subsidiaries and\njoint ventures and now permitted,\npreference shares. As such, inclusion of\nequity in the HTM category is not\npermissible, as equity has no maturity.\nAs regards the suggestion for increasing the\nlimit on the HTM category to 35% to\nmaintain a level playing field with the8\n35%. banks which have only 25% ceiling, the\nargument is fallacious. In several other\nrespects too (e.g., CRR, SLR, priority\nsector lending, etc.), FIs do not carry the\nsame regulatory burden as banks .The\nsuggestion is not acceptable.\nComputation of the 25% ceiling :\nFor computing the ceiling of 25% for the\nHTM category, the following type of\ninvestments should be excluded from the\ntotal investments and 25% of the balance\namount would constitute the ceiling:\na) Equity held in subsidiaries / Joint\nVentures;\nb) Bonds / debentures and preference\nshares meeting the prescribed criteria\nand treated in the nature of advance;\nc) Other investments (equity shares) in\nthe nature of advance which may be\nheld in the AFS category.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/24691.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 13, 2001", "info": "Settlement of insurance claims in foreign currency\nA.P.( DIR Series) Circular No.8 (October 13, 2001)\nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA\nEXCHANGE CONTROL DEPARTMENT\nCENTRAL OFFICE\nMUMBAI - 400 001\nA.P.( DIR Series) Circular No.8\nOctober 13, 2001\nTo\nAll Authorised Dealers in Foreign Exchange\nDear Sirs/Madam,\nSettlement of insurance claims in foreign currency\nIn terms of paragraph B.3 of GIM requests for issue of general insurance policies\nin foreign currency other than those covered by the provisions of GIM are required to be\nreferred to RBI.

Srinivasan )\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nGuidance Note on Credit Risk Management\n1. Credit Risk Management: Policy Framework\n1.1 Risk is inherent in all aspects of a commercial operation and covers areas such as customer\nservices, reputation, technology, security, human resources, market price, funding, legal,\nregulatory, fraud and strategy. However, for banks and financial institutions, credit risk is the\nmost important factor to be managed. Credit risk is defined as the possibility that a borrower\nor counterparty will fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms . Creditrisk, therefore, arises from the banks' dealings with or lending to a corporate, individual,\nanother bank, financial institution or a country. Credit risk may take various forms, such as:\n? in the case of direct lending, that funds will not be repaid;\n? in the case of guarantees or letters of credit, that funds will not be forthcoming from\nthe customer upon crystallization of the liability under the contract;\n? in the case of treasury products, that the payment or series of payments due from the\ncounterparty under the respective contracts is not forthcoming or ceases;\n? in the case of securities trading businesses, that settlement will not be effected;\n? in the case of cross-border exposure, that the availability and free transfer of\ncurrency is restricted or ceases.\n1.1.2 The more diversified a banking group is, the more intricate systems it would need, to\nprotect itself from a wide variety of risks. These include the routine operational risks applicable\nto any commercial concern, the business risks to its commercial borrowers, the economic and\npolitical risks associated with the countries in which it operates, and the commercial and the\nreputational  risks concomitant with a failure to comply with the increasingly stringent\nlegislation and regulations surrounding financial services business in many territories.\nComprehensive risk identification and assessment are therefore very essential to establishing\nthe health of any counterparty.\n1.1.3 Credit risk management enables banks to identify, assess, manage proactively, and\noptimise their credit risk at an individual level or at an entity level or at the level of a\ncountry. Given the fast changing, dynamic world scenario experiencing the pressures of\nglobalisation, liberalization, consolidation and disintermediation, it is important that banks\nhave a robust credit risk management policies and procedures which is sensitive and\nresponsive to these changes.\n1.1.4 The quality of the credit risk management function will be the key driver of the changes\nto the level of shareholder return. Industry analysts have demonstrated that the average\nshareholder return of the best credit performance US banks during 1989 \u2013 1997 was 56%\nhigher than their peers . Low loan loss banks stage a quicker share price recovery than their\npeers, and in a credit downturn, the market rewards the banks with the best credit performance\nwith a moderate price decline relative to their peers.\n1.2  Building Blocks on Credit Risk:\nIn any bank, the corporate goals and credit culture are closely linked, and an effective credit\nrisk management framework requires the following distinct building blocks:1.2.1 Strategy and Policy\nThis covers issues such as the definition of the credit appetite, the development of credit\nguidelines and the identification and the assessment of the credit risk.\n1.2.2 Organisation\nThis would entail the establishment of competencies and clear accountabilities for managing\nthe credit risk.\n1.2.3 Operations/Systems\nMIS requirements of the senior and middle management, and the development of tools and\ntechniques will come under this domain.\n1.3 Strategy and Policy\n1.3.1 It is essential that each bank develops its own credit risk strategy or enunciates a plan that\ndefines the objectives for the credit-granting function. This strategy should spell out clearly the\norganisation\u2019s credit appetite and the acceptable level of risk - reward trade-off at both the\nmacro and the micro levels.\n1.3.2 The strategy would therefore, include a statement of the bank\u2019s willingness to grant loans\nbased on the type of economic activity, geographical location, currency, market, maturity and\nanticipated profitability. This would necessarily translate into the identification of target\nmarkets and business sectors, preferred levels of diversification and concentration, the cost of\ncapital in granting credit and the cost of bad debts.\n1.3.3 The policy document should cover issues such as organizational responsibilities, risk\nmeasurement and aggregation techniques, prudential requirements, risk assessment and review,\nreporting requirements, risk grading, product guidelines, documentation, legal issues and\nmanagement of problem loans. Loan policies apart from ensuring consistency in credit\npractices , should also provide a vital link to the other functions of the bank. It has been\nempirically proved that organisations with sound and well-articulated loan policies have been\nable to contain the loan losses arising from poor loan structuring and perfunctory risk\nassessments.\n1.3.4 The credit risk strategy should provide continuity in approach, and will need to take into\naccount the cyclical aspects of any economy and the resulting shifts in the composition and\nquality of the overall credit portfolio. This strategy should be viable in the long run and through\nvarious credit cycles.\n1.3.5 An organisation's risk appetite depends on the level of capital and the quality of loan\nbook and the magnitude of other risks embedded in the balance sheet. Based on its capital\nstructure, a bank will be able to set its target returns to its shareholders and this will1.3.6 Keeping in view the foregoing, a bank should have the following in place:\n i. dedicated policies and procedures to control exposures to designated higher risk sectors\nsuch as capital markets, aviation, shipping, property development, defence equipment,\nhighly leveraged transactions, bullion etc.\n ii. sound procedures to ensure that all risks associated with requested credit facilities are\npromptly and fully evaluated by the relevant lending and credit officers.\n iii. systems to assign a risk rating to each customer/borrower to whom credit facilities have\nbeen sanctioned.\n iv. a mechanism to price facilities depending on the risk grading of the customer, and to\nattribute accurately the associated risk weightings to the facilities.\n v. efficient and effective credit approval process operating within the approval limits\nauthorized by the Boards.\n vi. procedures and systems which allow for monitoring financial performance of customers\nand for controlling outstandings within limits.\n vii. systems to manage problem loans to ensure appropriate restructuring schemes. A\nconservative policy for the provisioning of non-performing advances should be\nfollowed.\n viii. a process to conduct regular analysis of the portfolio and to ensure on-going control of\nrisk concentrations.\n1.4 Credit Policies and Procedures\nThe credit policies and procedures should necessarily have the following elements:\n? Banks should have written credit policies that define target markets, risk acceptance\ncriteria, credit approval authority, credit origination and maintenance procedures and\nguidelines for portfolio management and remedial management.\n? Banks should establish proactive credit risk management practices like annual / half\nyearly industry studies and individual obligor reviews, periodic credit calls that are\ndocumented, periodic plant visits, and at least quarterly management reviews of troubled\nexposures/weak credits.\n? Business managers in banks will be accountable for managing risk and in conjunction\nwith credit risk management framework for establishing and maintaining appropriate\nrisk limits and risk management procedures for their businesses.\n? Banks should have a system of checks and balances in place around the extension of\ncredit which are:\n? An independent credit risk management function? Multiple credit approvers\n? An independent audit and risk review function\n? The Credit Approving Authority to extend or approve credit will be granted to individual\ncredit officers based upon a consistent set of standards of experience, judgment and\nability.\n? The level of authority required to approve credit will increase as amounts and transaction\nrisks increase and as risk ratings worsen.\n? Every obligor and facility must be assigned a risk rating.\n? Banks should ensure that there are consistent standards for the origination,\ndocumentation and maintenance for extensions of credit.\n? Banks should have a consistent approach toward early problem recognition, the\nclassification of problem exposures, and remedial action.\n? Banks should maintain a diversified portfolio of risk assets in line with the capital\ndesired to support such a portfolio.\n? Credit risk limits include, but are not limited to, obligor limits and concentration limits\nby industry or geography.\n? In order to ensure transparency of risks taken, it is the responsibility of banks to\naccurately, completely and in a timely fashion, report the comprehensive set of credit\nrisk data into the independent risk system.\n1.5 Organizational Structure\n1.5.1 A common feature of most successful banks is to establish an independent group\nresponsible for credit risk management. This will ensure that decisions are made with\nsufficient emphasis on asset quality and will deploy specialised skills effectively. In some\norganisations, the credit risk management team is responsible for the management of\nproblem accounts, and for credit operations as well. The responsibilities of this team are the\nformulation of credit policies, procedures and controls extending to all of its credit risks\narising from corporate banking, treasury, credit cards, personal banking, trade finance,\nsecurities processing, payment and settlement systems, etc. This team should also have an\noverview of the loan portfolio trends and concentration risks across the bank and for individual\nlines of businesses, should provide input to the Asset - Liability Management Committee of the\nbank, and conduct industry and sectoral studies. Inputs should be provided for the strategic and\nannual operating plans. In addition, this team should review credit related processes and\noperating procedures periodically.1.5.2 It is imperative that the independence of the credit risk management team is preserved,\nand it is the responsibility of the Board to ensure that this is not allowed to be compromised at\nany time.  Should the Board decide not to accept any recommendation of the credit risk\nmanagement team and then systems should be in place to have the rationale for such an action\nto be properly documented. This document should be made available to both the internal and\nexternal auditors for their scrutiny and comments.\n1.5.3 The credit risk strategy and policies should be effectively communicated throughout the\norganisation. All lending officers should clearly understand the bank's approach to granting\ncredit and should be held accountable for complying with the policies and procedures.\n1.5.4 Keeping in view the foregoing, each bank may, depending on the size of the\norganization or loan book, constitute a high level Credit Policy Committee also called Credit\nRisk Management Committee or Credit Control Committee, etc. to deal with issues relating\nto credit policy and procedures and to analyse , manage and control credit risk on a bank\nwide basis. The Committee should be headed by the Chairman/CEO/ED, and should\ncomprise heads of Credit Department, Treasury, Credit Risk Management Department\n(CRMD) and the Chief Economist. The Committee should, inter alia, formulate clear\npolicies on standards for presentation of credit proposals, financial covenants, rating\nstandards and benchmarks, delegation of credit approving powers, prudential limits on large\ncredit exposures, asset concentrations, standards for loan collateral, portfolio management,\nloan review mechanism, risk concentrations, risk monitoring and evaluation, pricing of\nloans, provisioning, regulatory/legal compliance, etc. Concurrently, each bank may also set\nup Credit Risk Management Department ( CRMD), independent of the Credit Administration\nDepartment. The CRMD should enforce and monitor compliance of the risk parameters and\nprudential limits set by the CPC. The CRMD should also lay down risk assessment systems,\nmonitor quality of loan portfolio, identify problems and correct deficiencies, develop MIS\nand undertake loan review/audit. Large banks may consider separate set up for loan\nreview/audit. The CRMD should also be made accountable for protecting the quality of the\nentire loan portfolio. The Department should undertake portfolio evaluations and conduct\ncomprehensive studies on the environment to test the resilience of the loan portfolio.1.5.5 Typical Organisational Structure\n1.6 Operations / Systems\n1.6.1 Banks should have in place an appropriate credit administration, measurement and\nmonitoring process. The credit process typically involves the following phases:\na)Relationship management phase i.e. business development.\nb)Transaction management phase: cover risk assessment, pricing, structuring of the facilities,\nobtaining internal approvals, documentation, loan administration and routine monitoring\nand measurement.\nc)Portfolio management phase: entail the monitoring of the portfolio at a macro level and the\nmanagement of problem loans.Managing Director\nHead of Credit RiskHead of RiskBoard/Board Sub Committee\n(Risk & Audit Committee)\nRisk Planning Cell\n?

Each bank should have a clear, well-documented scheme of delegation\nof limits. Authorities should be delegated to executives depending on their skill and experience\nlevels. The banks should have systems in place for reporting and evaluating the quality of the\ncredit decisions taken by the various officers.\n1.6.3 The credit approval process should aim at efficiency, responsiveness and accurate\nmeasurement of the risk. This will be achieved through a comprehensive analysis of the\nborrower's ability to repay, clear and consistent assessment systems, a process which ensures\nthat renewal requests are analyzed as carefully and stringently as new loans and constant\nreinforcement of the credit culture by the top management team.\n1.6.4 Commitment to new systems and IT will also determine the quality of the analysis being\nconducted. There is a range of tools available to support the decision making process. These\nare:\na) Traditional techniques such as financial analysis.\nb) Decision support tools such as credit scoring and risk grading.\nc) Portfolio techniques such as portfolio correlation analysis.\nThe key is to identify the tools that are appropriate to the bank.\nBanks should develop and utilize internal risk rating systems in managing credit risk. The\nrating system should be consistent with the nature, size and complexity of the bank's activities.\n1.6.5 Banks must have a MIS, which will enable them to manage and measure the credit risk\ninherent in all on- and off-balance sheet activities.  The MIS should provide adequate\ninformation on the composition of the credit portfolio, including identification of any\nconcentration of risk. Banks should price their loans according to the risk profile of the\nborrower and the risks associated with the loans.\n2. Credit  Rating Framework\n2.1 Background\n2.1.1 A Credit-risk Rating Framework ( CRF) deploys a number/ alphabet/ symbol as a\nprimary summary indicator of risks associated with a credit exposure. The underlying logic\nfor a CRF is the limitations associated with a binary classification of loans/exposures into a\n\u201cgood\u201d or a \u201cbad\u201d category. Such a rating framework is the basic module for developing a\ncredit risk management system and all advanced models/approaches are based on this\nstructure. Occasionally, a conventional opinion is held that CRFs have lost their relevance\nand utility and current credit risk management practices have graduated to more\nscientific/quantitative models. This view is incorrect and without substantial exception, allusers of advanced credit risk management systems have adopted and continue to utilise\nCRFs. These frameworks have been primarily driven by a need to standardise and uniformly\ncommunicate the \u201cjudgement\u201d in credit selection procedures. The point here is that these\nrating frameworks, which are logic-based and utilise responses made on a specified scale,\npromote the accuracy and consistency of the judgement exercised by the banks/FIs and are\nnot a substitute to the vast lending experience accumulated by their professional staff.\n2.1.2 Some of the details collated by the Federal Reserve Board of the United States are\nuseful in indicating the current relevance of CRFs. The survey undertaken by the Federal\nReserve (titled \u201cSurvey of Terms of Business Lending\u201d) has concluded that all the large\nrespondent banks/FIs in the US use an internal risk-rating scale for calibration and\ncommunication of the credit-risk associated with each exposure or with each borrower. For\nlarge banks/FIs, as indicated in the survey, the proportion of amount of loans rated internally\nis nearly 100%. This survey has also highlighted that over time, the number of risk\ncategories have increased and the distribution of the credit-exposures over these categories\nhas widened, implying that the users continue to adjust and fine-tune their internal CRFs for\nfacilitating better decision-making.\n2.2 End Use of Risk-Ratings made on the CRF\nThe approach to developing and implementing a CRF can be derived backwards from the\ndecision-making that would be supported by these classifications/readings. Broadly, the\noutput from the CRF can be classified into transaction-level analysis and portfolio-level\nanalysis. As evident, the CRF outputs would be relevant for individual credit selection,\nwherein either a borrower or a particular exposure/facility is rated on the CRF. The other\nassociated decisions would be related to pricing (credit-spread) and specific features of the\nloan facility. This would largely constitute transaction-level analysis. In addition to this, the\nrisk calibration would be relevant for surveillance and monitoring, internal MIS and\nassessing the aggregate risk profile of bank/lender. These would be relevant for portfolio-\nlevel analysis. For instance, the spread of credit exposures across various CRF categories,\nthe mean and the standard deviation of losses occurring in each CRF category and the\noverall migration of exposures would highlight the aggregated credit-risk for the entire\nportfolio of the bank/FI.\n2.3 Basic Architecture of CRFs\nThe following elements outline the basic architecture and the operating principles of any\nCRF. These are discussed in some detail in this section.1 Grading system for calibration of credit risk\n? Nature of grading system\n? Number of grades used\n? Further refinements in the grading system\n2. Operating design of CRF\n? Which exposures are rated?\n? Rating process, credit approval and surveillance procedures\n? Functional responsibilities for the CRF\n? Operating the CRF system\n? Formality of procedures and communications\n? CRF and the credit culture\n3. Aggregated credit risk profile and CRFs\n? Portfolio surveillance and reporting\n? Provisioning and reserve creation\n? Profitability and risk mapping of credit products\n? Guidelines for pricing and asset buildup\n? Dynamic asset portfolio management\n2.4 Grading System for Calibration of Credit Risk\nThe internal credit-risk grading system should be developed with the singular objective of\ncomprehensive understanding, representation and communication of the default risks\nassociated with an exposure. This communication should be readily comparable, amenable\nfor aggregation/ disaggregation and should reflect the regulatory stipulations on asset\nclassification (e.g. the RBI asset classification). In addition, the grading system for the CRFs\nshould be versatile ( upgradable) and should have the ability to absorb changes in the lending\nenvironment. It is anticipated that over a period of time, risk categorisation is further refined\nand the spread/distribution of exposures over risk categories widens. The grading system\nshould therefore be amenable to adjustments and should accommodate the refinements in\nexposure classification.\n2.5 Number of Grades Used in the CRF\nThe number of grades used in the CRF depends on the anticipated spread in credit-quality of\nthe exposures taken by the bank. This, in turn, is dependent on the present and the future\nbusiness profile of the bank and the anticipated level of specialisation/diversification in the\ncredit portfolio. CRFs with a large number of scales/grades on the rating scale are, asevident, more expensive to operate as the costs of additional information for (very) fine\ngradation of credit-quality increase sharply. A bank can initiate the risk-grading activity on a\nrelative smaller/narrower scale and introduce new categories as the risk-gradation improves\nand the spread of exposures widens.\n2.6 Nature of Grading System for the CRF\n2.6.1 The grading system adopted for a CRF could be an alphabetic, numeric or an alpha-\nnumeric scale. Since rating agencies follow a particular scale (AAA, AA+, BBB etc.), it is\nprudent to avoid a similar gradation system. This could create confusion in internal\ncommunications. In addition, since the rating scale is widely used and published, it is best to\nfollow an alternative grading structure since this would permit some comparable\nbenchmarking between the two mechanisms. Several banks utilise a numeric scale to reflect\nthe risk-ratings of their existing and proposed credit exposures. The number of grades for the\n\u201cacceptable\u201d and the \u201cunacceptable\u201d credit risk categories would depend on the incremental\neffort and the related benefits of finer risk gradation. Normally, numeric scales developed\nfor CRFs are such that the lower the credit-risk, the lower is the calibration on the scale.\n2.6.2 As an illustrations, the CRF scale could consists of 9 categories, of which categories 1\nto 5 represent various grades of acceptable credit risk and categories 6 to 9 represent\nunacceptable levels of credit risk associated with an exposure under consideration/existing\nexposure. The scale, starting from category \u201c1\u201d (which would represent lowest level credit\nrisk) and ending at \u201c9\u201d (which would represent the highest level of credit risk), could be\ndeployed to calibrate, benchmark, compare and monitor credit risk associated with the\nbank\u2019s exposures and give indicative guidelines for credit risk management activities. The\nkey parameter that would summarise all the credit risks would be the certainty in the\nbusiness and the financial environment of the borrower and correspondingly the extent to\nwhich cash flows would meet the financial obligations. There is a possibility that this scale\nwould increase the rigor and debate involved in the appraisal process for marginal cases\n(which are expected to be more volatile to changes in the underlying\narrangements/assumptions in comparison to credit proposals which have a lower calibration\non the grading scale).\n2.7 Key Outputs of the CRF\n2.7.1 The calibration on the risk-grading scale is expected to define the pricing and related\nterms and conditions for the accepted credit exposures. It is possible to define broad pricing\nbands and directly link the band with the calibration on the risk-rating scale. Further\nrefinement in the pricing proposal would be based on the bank\u2019s judgement of the prominent2.7.2 In addition to the pricing related decisions, the calibration on the proposed CRF would\nallow for a superior assessment on the quantum of exposure for any credit proposal. The\nquantum (or amount of facility sanctioned) would depend on the credit-score on the CRF.\nFor relatively inferior credit quality proposals, bank could link their assistance to a\npercentage of the total debt required by the obligor/borrower. This would help in a larger\ndispersion of risk amongst lenders and limit risk concentration in moderate credit-quality\nprojects. A similar benchmarking could be made for decisions related to the tenure of the\nproposed assistance.\n2.7.3 For all adverse movements in the credit-quality over the life cycle of the exposure, the\nbank would have to initiate specific surveillance arrangements and remedial measures to\nkeep a close track of deteriorating credit quality. For instance, the frequency of surveillance\non category 5 exposures could be kept at quarterly intervals, while those on category 3 loans\ncould be half-yearly. More importantly, movement of an existing exposure to the\n\u201cunacceptable\u201d category of credit risk (grades 6 to 9) should directly identify the extent of\nprovisioning (loan loss reserves) that need to be earmarked for expected losses. Though such\nloss-provisions are often specified by the regulator (e.g. the RBI provisioning norms), it is\noften argued (and widely practiced) that banks should develop their own internal norms and\ncertain level of \u201creasonable over-provisioning\u201d should be maintained as a best practice.\nSpecifically, while the credit exposure/asset is clearly facing rapid/steady erosion and is on\nthe downhill transition path (from \u201cpoor\u201d to \u201csub-standard\u201d categories), anticipatory\nprovisioning can be done based on the calibrations on the risk-rating scale.\n2.8 Operating Design of the CRF\nThe above discussions conclude some points of view on the grading system for calibration\nof credit risk. As mentioned elsewhere in the Note, the judgement exercised by the\noperations/ risk / credit staff of the bank/FIs is central to the operations of the CRF.\n2.9 Which Exposures are Rated\nThe first element of the operating design is to determine which exposures are rated through\nthe CRF. There may be a case for size-based classification of exposures and linking the risk-\nrating process to these size-based categories. The shortcoming of this arrangement is that\nthough significant credit migration/deterioration/erosion occurs in the smaller sized\nexposures, these are not captured by the CRF. In addition, the size-criteria are also linked\nwith the tenure-criteria for an exposure. In several instances, large-sized exposures over a\nshort tenure may not require the extent of surveillance and credit monitoring that is requiredfor a smaller sized long-tenure exposure. Given this apparent lack of clarity, it is perhaps\nprudent to follow a policy of \u2018all exposures are to be rated\u2019 .\n2.10 The Risk-Rating Process\nThe credit approval process within the bank is expected to replicate the flow of\nanalysis/appraisal of credit-risk calibration on the CRF. The risk rating assigned to each\ncredit proposal directly leads into the related decisions of acceptance (or rejection), amount,\ntenure and pricing of the (accepted) proposal. The CRF is designed in such a way that the\nrisk-rating has certain (default) linkages with the amount, tenure and pricing of exposure.\nThese default linkages are either specified upfront or are developed with empirical details\nover a period of time. For each proposal, the credit/risk staff would assign a rating and\nforward the recommendation to the higher level of credit selection process. The proposed\nrisk-rating is either reaffirmed or re-calibrated at the time of final credit approval and\nsanction. Any revisions in the risk-ratings are utilised to upgrade the CRF system and the\noperating guidelines. In this manner, the CRF maintains its \u201cincremental upgradation\u201d\nfeature and changes in the lending environment are captured by the system. The risk-rating\nprocess would be equally relevant in the credit-monitoring/surveillance stage. All changes in\nthe underlying credit-quality are calibrated on the risk-scale and corresponding remedial\nactions are initiated. The risk-rating and the responsibilities for surveillance are finalised as\npart of the \u201csign-off\u201d procedures and the required documentation is completed.\n2.11 Assigning & Monitoring Risk-Ratings\nIn conventional banks, the practice of segregating the \u201crelationship management\u201d and the\n\u201ccredit appraisal\u201d functions is quite prevalent. One of the variants of this arrangement is that\ncredit limits are specified and corresponding responsibilities for calibration on the risk-rating\nscale are divided between the \u201crelationship\u201d and the \u201ccredit\u201d groups. All large sized\nexposures (above a limit) are appraised independently by the \u201ccredit\u201d group. Generally, the\nactivities of assigning and approving risk-ratings need to be segregated. Though the front-\noffice or conventional relationship staff can assign the risk-ratings, the responsibilities of\nfinal approval and monitoring should be vested with a separate credit function.\n2.12 The Mechanism of Arriving at Risk-Ratings\n2.12.1 The risk ratings, as specified above, are collective readings on the pre-specified scale\nand reflect the underlying credit-risk for a prospective exposure. The CRF could be separate\nfor relatively peculiar businesses like banking, finance companies, real-estate developers,peculiarity of a particular industry can be captured by assigning different weightages to\naspects like entry barriers, access to technology, ability of new entrants to access raw\nmaterials, etc. The following step-wise activities outline the indicative process for arriving at\nrisk-ratings.\nStep I Identify all the principal business and financial risk elements\nStep II Allocate weightages to principal risk components\nStep III Compare with weightages given in similar sectors and check for consistency\nStep IV Establish the key parameters (sub-components of the principal risk elements)\nStep V Assign weightages to each of the key parameters\nStep VI Rank the key parameters on the specified scale\nStep VII Arrive at the credit-risk rating on the CRF\nStep VIII Compare with previous risk-ratings of similar exposures and check for consistency\nStep IX Conclude the credit-risk calibration on the CRF\n2.12.2 The risk-rating process would represent collective decision making principles and as\nindicated above, would involve some in-built arrangements for ensuring the consistency of\nthe output. The rankings would be largely comparative. As a bank\u2019s perception of the\nexposure improves/changes during the course of the appraisal, it may be necessary to adjust\nthe weightages and the rankings given to specific risk-parameters in the CRF. Such changes\nwould be deliberated and the arguments for substantiating these adjustments would be\nclearly communicated in the appraisal documents.\n2.13 Standardisation and Benchmarks for Risk-Ratings\n2.13.1  In a lending environment dominated by industrial and corporate credits, the assignors\nof risk-ratings utilise benchmarks or pre-specified standards for assessing the risk profile of\na potential borrower. These standards usually consist of financial ratios and credit-migration\nstatistics, which capture the financial risks posed by the potential borrower (e.g. operating\nand financial leverage, profitability, liquidity and debt-servicing ability). The business risks\nassociated with an exposure (e.g. cyclicality of industry, threats of product or technology\nsubstitution etc.) are also addressed in the CRF. The output of the credit-appraisal process,\nspecifically the financial ratios, is directly compared with the specified benchmarks for a\nparticular risk category. In these cases, the risk-rating is fairly standardised and CRF\nallocates a grade or a numeric value for the overall risk profile of the proposed exposure. For\ninstance, assume a scale from \u201c1\u201d to \u201c6\u201d, with \u201c1\u201d representing extremely low financial risk.If Gross Revenues are between Rs.800 to Rs.1000 crores assign a score of 2\nIf Operating Margin is 20% or more assign a score of 2\nIf ROCE is 25% or more assign a score of 1\nIf Debt : Equity is between 0.60 and 0.80 assign a score of 2\nIf interest cover is 3.50 or more assign a score of 1\nIf DSCR is 1.80 or more assign a score of 1\n2.13.2 The next step would be to assign weightages to these risk-parameters. In an industrial\ncredit environment, the CRF may place higher weightages on size (as captured in gross\nrevenues), profitability of operations (operating margins), financial leverage (debt: equity)\nand debt-servicing ability (interest cover). Assume that the CRF assigns a 20% weightage to\neach of these four parameters and the ROCE and DSCR are given a 10% weightage each.\nThe weighted-average score for the financial risk of the proposed exposure is 1.40, which\nwould correspond with the extremely low risk/highest safety level-category of the CRF\n(category 1). Similarly, the business and the management risk of the proposed exposure are\nassessed and an overall/comprehensive risk rating is assigned.\n2.13.3 The industrial credit environment permits a significantly higher level of\nbenchmarking and standardisation, specifically in reference to calibration of financial risks\nassociated with credit exposures. For all prominent industry-categories, any lender can\ncompile profitability, leverage and debt-servicing details and utilise these to develop internal\nbenchmarks for the CRF. As evident, developing such benchmarks and risk-standards for a\nportfolio of project finance exposures, as in the case of the bank, would be an altogether\ndiverse exercise.\n2.14 Written Communications & Formality of Procedure\nThe two critical aspects of the formality of procedure in the risk-rating process are ( i) the\nprocess-flow through which a credit-transaction would flow across various units and (ii) the\nwritten communication on the risk-ratings assigned to a particular proposal. The process-\nflow required for the credit appraisal exercise, which is possibly a sub-component of the\ninternal MIS for the bank, would be explicitly drafted and communicated and would clearly\nidentify the transactions and linkages between various operating units of the bank.\nThe above discussion broadly presents some (possibly critical) dimensions of the operating\ndesign of the proposed CRF for banks. As evident, these details are merely indicative and\ncould be useful in demarcating the scope of work required for the CRF.\n2.15 CRFs and Portfolio Credit-RiskThe outputs of the CRF would highlight the spread (or frequency-distribution) of the credit-\nrisk in the asset-portfolio of the bank and would give indicative guidelines for future asset\nbuild-up efforts. This section briefly covers some aspects of portfolio credit-risk\nmanagement, a process which would possibly be facilitated by implementing the CRF.\n2.16 Portfolio Surveillance and Reporting\nThe conventional internal MIS of a bank would identify the problem-loans in the asset\nportfolio, as per the guidelines given by the regulatory body (i.e. the asset-classification\nguidelines of RBI). These details, however, represent only a component of the credit-risks\naccumulated in the asset portfolio of a bank. The CRF can be used for informing the top\nmanagement on the frequency distribution of assets across risk-rating categories, the extent\nof migration in the past (e.g. movement of exposures from higher to lower risk-categories or\nvice-versa) and the anticipated developments in the aggregated credit portfolio. The senior\nmanagement may benefit from such outputs in terms of steering the organisation through\nvarious risk-cycles (e.g. initial low-risk low-return phase to consolidation and further to an\nincremental rise in relatively high-risk high-return exposures).\n2.17 Adequate Levels of Provisioning for Credit Events\n2.17.1 The spread of the portfolio credit-risk and the trends in credit migration would allow\nthe management of the bank to determine the level of provisioning required to absorb\nunanticipated erosions in the credit quality of exposures. In most cases, provisions for loan-\nlosses are based on the prevailing regulatory and accounting directives. However, the\nmanagement may find merit in certain prudent level of \u201cover-provisioning\u201d. This decision\nmay be facilitated by factors like the volume and the spread of credit-exposures in the\n\u201caverage\u201d and \u201cbelow average but acceptable\u201d risk-rating categories of the CRF. This\nexercise may add stability and resilience to the capital adequacy and profitability of the\nbank.\n2.17.2 The extent of provisioning required could be estimated from the Expected Loss on\nDefault (which is a product of the Probability of Default and Loss Given. Since these\nprobabilities can be assigned only after significant empirical details are available, the bank\ncould (possibly) adopt a policy of allocating/provisioning an amount which is a proportion\nof the aggregated exposures in the moderate or \u201cbarely-acceptable\u201d levels of credit-risk, as\ndefined by the CRF.\n2.18 Guidelines for Asset Buildup, Aggregate Profitability and Pricing\n2.18.1  As discussed above, a clear analysis of the prevailing risk-posture of the bank, which\nwould be facilitated by the CRF, would give strong recommendations for future assetbuildup and business development activities. The assessment of profitability, across various\nrisk-categories and credit products, would outline the overall risk-adjusted return. The extent\nof provisioning (allocation of economic capital) would be based on actual and anticipated\nerosion in credit quality and would define the \u201ccost\u201d of maintaining an exposure in the\nbank\u2019s credit portfolio. A similar analysis could be undertaken for a specific credit-product\nand the \u201cfully- costed\u201d risk-adjusted return can be assessed. This, as expected, would define\nthe contours of the pricing-decisions and the incremental impact (of a set of exposure/credit-\nproducts) on bank\u2019s profitability can be assessed with greater clarity and consistency.\n2.18.2 Thus a CRF is expected to benefit the bank by enhancing the consistency and the\ntransparency of the credit-selection process. The underlying motivation for acceptance of a\nCRF, as witnessed in the lending environment, is the standardisation and the explicit\ncommunication of the \u201cjudgement\u201d involved in credit selection. The CRF, in no manner, is a\nsubstitute to the vast lending experience accumulated in a bank/FI. The benefits of such a\nCRF system, in addition to those described above, could include a more amenable\ninteraction with rating agencies and regulatory bodies.\n2.19 Sample Credit Rating Framework\n2.19.1 Ratings should be based on the following considerations:\na) default likelihood of the debtor\nb) nature and provisions of the obligation\nc) dilution in the rights of the bank  in the event of financial distress, under the laws\naffecting creditor's rights\n2.19.2 Credit risk for counterparty arises from an aggregation of the following:\na) External risk\n- sector risk (including government policies)\nb) Internal risk with respect to counterparty\n- business risk\n- financial risk\n- management risk\n- project risk\n2.19.3 Any risk rating model would need to evaluate each of the above risks individually\nand aggregate the same to arrive at an overall rating measure.\ni) Evaluation of industry/sector risk\nThe evaluation of industry/sector risk could look at parameters such as :\na) Industry attractiveness determined by intensity of competition, barriers to entry,b) Industry returns\nc) Cyclicality in earnings\nSuitable measures to evaluate each of the above may be determined, which could then be\naggregated so as to determine overall industry/sector risk.\nii) Evaluation of business risk\nThe business position of a company is a function of its relative positioning within the\nindustry/sector. The business position of a company would be determined by its market\nposition and operating efficiencies.\nSuitable parameters, relevant to the industry/sector in which the company is operating may\nbe selected for evaluation of the same.  The parameters may be suitably scored based on the\nrelative strength of the company being rated vis-\u00e0-vis competitors in the industry. The scores\nmay be aggregated to arrive at an overall business score.\niii) Evaluation of financial risk\nEvaluation of financial risks could typically entail :\na) Analysis of past financials\n- operating margins, ROCE, interest cover, leverage, liquidity ratios, contingent\nliabilities, etc.\nAnalysis of past financials should include qualitative aspects like accounting quality,\ndisclosure norms, changes in accounting policies, etc.\nb) Analysis of future cash flows including projected profitability\nc)   Flexibility to raise required resources\nd)   Strength of sponsor group\ne)   Adequacy of debt service coverage\nf) Projected leverage\nThe parameters may be suitably scored and aggregated to arrive at the financial risk score.\niv) Evaluation of management risk\nEvaluation of management risk would involve :\nAssessment of management capability in terms of\na) track record of the management\nb) quality of the management personnel\nc) payment record with banks\nd) financial conservatism\ne) market standing/credibility\nf) support from group companiesThe overall score on management would be arrived at by aggregation of the individual\nscores on these parameters selected.\nv) Evaluation of project risk\nProjects of significant size impact the risk profile of a company (even if existing operations\nare satisfactory).\nAnalysis of project risks would involve\na) determination of size of project in relation to existing net worth\nb) likelihood and extent of overruns\nc) assessment of implementation risks\nd) technology/stabilization risks\ne) risks related to statutory clearances\nf) assessment of funding risks\ng) assessment of post-implementation risks such as market, company\u2019s business position\netc.\n2.20 Estimation of overall risk\nThe overall risk rating could be arrived at by aggregation of individual scores of the\ndifferent risk categories and mapping of the same to a suitable rating symbol.3. APPROACH TO CREDIT RISK MODELS\n3.1 A credit risk model seeks to determine, directly or indirectly, the answer to the following\nquestion: Given our past experience and our assumptions about the future, what is the value\nof a given loan or fixed income security? Equivalently, what is the (quantifiable) risk that\nthe promised cash flows will not be forthcoming? The techniques in measuring credit risk\nthat have evolved over the last twenty years are prompted by these questions and dynamic\nchanges in the loan market.\n3.1.1  The importance of credit risk modelling should be seen as the consequence of three\nfactors. First, banks are becoming increasingly quantitative in their treatment of credit risk.\nSecond, new markets are emerging in credit derivatives and the marketability of existing\nloans is increasing through securitizations and the loan sales market. Third, regulators are\nconcerned to improve the current system of bank capital requirements especially as it relates\nto credit risk.\n3.1.2  The credit risk models are intended to aid banks in quantifying, aggregating and\nmanaging risk across geographical and product lines. The outputs of these models also play\nincreasingly important roles in banks\u2019 risk management and performance measurement\nprocesses, including performance-based compensation, customer profitability analysis, risk-\nbased pricing and active portfolio management and capital structure decisions. Credit risk\nmodelling may result in better internal risk management, and may have the potential to be\nused in the supervisory oversight of banking organisations.\n3.1.3  Since banks\u2019 credit exposures typically cut across geographical locations and product\nlines, the use of credit risk models offers banks a framework for examining this risk in a\ntimely manner, centralising data on global exposures and analysing marginal and absolute\ncontributions to risk. These properties of models may contribute to an improvement in a\nbank\u2019s overall ability to identify, measure and manage risk.\n3.2 In the measurement of credit risk, models may be classified along three different\ndimensions: the techniques employed, the domain of applications in the credit process and\nthe products to which they are applied.\n3.2.1 Techniques : The following are the more commonly used techniques:\n(a) Econometric Techniques  such as linear and multiple discriminant analysis, multiple\nregression, logic analysis and probability of default, or the default premium, as a\ndependent variable whose variance is explained by a set of independent variables.(b) Neural networks  are computer-based systems that use the same data employed in the\neconometric techniques but arrive at the decision model using alternative\nimplementations of a trial and error method.\n(c) Optimisation models  are mathematical programming techniques that discover the\noptimum weights for borrower and loan attributes that minimize lender error and\nmaximise profits.\n(d) Rule-based or expert systems  are characterised by a set of decision rules, a knowledge\nbase consisting of data such as industry financial ratios, and a structured inquiry process\nto be used by the analyst in obtaining the data on a particular borrower.\n(e) Hybrid Systems using direct computation, estimation, and simulation are driven in part\nby a direct causal relationship, the parameters of which are determined through\nestimation techniques. An example of this is the KMV model, which uses an option\ntheoretic formulation to explain default and then derives the form of the relationship\nthrough estimation.\n3.2.2  Domain of application: These models are used in a variety of domains:\n(a) Credit approval: Models are used by themselves or in conjunction with a judgemental\noverride system for approving credit in the consumer lending business. The use of such\nmodels has expanded to include small business lending and first mortgage loan approvals.\nThey are generally not used in approving large corporate loans, but they may be one of the\ninputs to a decision.\n(b) Credit rating determination: Quantitative models are used in deriving \u2018shadow bond\nrating\u2019 for unrated securities and commercial loans. These ratings in turn influence portfolio\nlimits and other lending limits used by the institution. In some instances, the credit rating\npredicted by the model is used within an institution to challenge the rating as- signed by the\ntraditional credit analysis process.\n(c) Credit risk models may be used to suggest the risk premiums that should be charged in\nview of the probability of loss and the size of the loss given default. Using a mark-to-market\nmodel, an institution may evaluate the costs and benefits of holding a financial asset.\nUnexpected losses implied by a credit model may be used to set the capital charge in\npricing.\n(d) Financial early warning: Credit models are used to flag potential problems in the\nportfolio to facilitate early corrective action.\n(e) Common credit language: Credit models may be used to select assets from a pool to\nconstruct a portfolio acceptable to investors or to achieve the minimum credit quality neededto obtain the desired credit rating. Underwriters may use such models for due diligence on\nthe portfolio (such as a collateralized pool of commercial loans).\n(f) Collection strategies: Credit models may be used in deciding on the best collection or\nworkout strategy to pursue. If, for example, a credit model indicates that a borrower is\nexperiencing short-term liquidity problems rather than a decline in credit fundamentals, then\nan appropriate workout may be devised.\n3.2.3 Relevance to the decision maker : Credit Risk Models have assumed importance\nbecause they provide the decision maker with insight or knowledge that would not otherwise\nbe readily available or that could be marshalled at prohibitive cost. In a marketplace where\nmargins are fast disappearing and the pressure to low cost is unrelenting, models give their\nusers a competitive edge.\n3.3  Credit Risk Models\n3.3.1 The literature on quantitative risk modelling has two different approaches to credit risk\nmeasurement. The first approach is the development of statistical models through analysis of\nhistorical data. This approach was frequently used in the last two decades. The other type of\nrisk modelling comprises structural models where the distribution of assets was modelled by\na stochastic process.\n3.3.2 The statistical approach tries to rate the firms on a discrete or continuous scale. It\nbasically constructs a mapping from the domain of all potential information on financial\nvariables to a range of values, which can be easily compared and used for the purpose of\ndecision-making. The linear model introduced by Altman (1967), also known as the Z-score\nModel, is an example of a reduced linear discriminating  model. The Altman model separates\ndefaulting firms from non-defaulting ones on the basis of the discriminatory power of a\nlinear combination of financial ratios. Altman, Hartzell, and Peck (1995,1996) have\nmodified the original Z-score model to develop a model specific to emerging markets. This\nmodel is known as the Emerging Market Scoring ( EMS) model.\n3.3.3  The second type of modelling approach tries to capture asset-value distribution of the\nfirm over time. These structured models are developed on the contingent-claim framework\nof corporate capital structure. The leading example of stock market-based credit risk model\nis the expected default frequency ( EDF) model developed by the KMV Corporation. It\ncalculates the asset value of a firm from the market value of its equity using an option\npricing based approach that recognizes equity as a call option on the underlying asset of thefirm. Mimicking the asset distribution of the firm by a stochastic process, it tries to estimate\nthe asset value path of the firm over a time horizon. Finally, default probability, the chance\nof the estimated asset value falling below a pre-specified default point, is calculated.  This\nmodel is based conceptually on Merton's (1974) contingent claim framework and has been\nworking very well for estimating default risk in a liquid market.\n3.3.4  Closely related to credit risk models are portfolio risk models.  In the last three years,\nimportant advances have been made in modelling credit risk in lending portfolios. The new\nmodels are designed to quantify credit risk on a portfolio basis, and thus have applications in\nappropriate diversification as well as portfolio based pricing. Two of these models, the\nRiskMetrics Group's CreditMetrics Model and Credit Suisse Financial Product's\nCreditRisk+ Model, have been released freely to the public in 1997 and have quickly\nbecome influential benchmarks. Though there are differences in the approaches, both\nmodels estimate the loss distribution associated with the portfolio and identify the risky\ncomponents by inspecting the risk contribution of each member in the portfolio.\n3.4  A brief overview of the four credit risk models that have achieved global acceptance as\nbenchmarks for measuring stand-alone as well as portfolio credit risk are given in annexure-\nI.\n3.5 From the foregoing discussion, it may be observed that t he methodology in building the\nmodels will involve the conceptual methodology , parameter specification  and estimation\nand validation .\n3.5.1  Conceptual methodology\nA wide range of practices is observed in the conceptual approaches to credit risk modelling.\nThey are:\n\u2022 Different approaches to the measurement of credit loss : Most banks employ either of two\nconceptual definitions of credit loss: the default-mode paradigm, in which a credit loss arises\nonly if a borrower defaults within the planning horizon, and the mark-to-market paradigm,\nin which credit deterioration short of default is also incorporated. Banks may also choose to\nadopt different time horizons for monitoring credit risk.\n\u2022 Different methodologies for the measurement of exposure and loss given default : In\nmeasuring exposure to a line of credit, some banks employ a largely judgemental approach\nfor estimating recovery values of loans in the event of default, while others rely on more\nempirically based techniques.\u2022 Unconditional and conditional models : Unconditional models typically reflect borrower\nor facility-specific information, while conditional models also incorporate information on\nthe state of the economy.\n\u2022 Different approaches to the aggregation of credit risk : Credit risk may be measured at the\nindividual asset level, as is typically the case with large corporate and capital market\ninstruments; conversely, aggregate (pooled) data may be used to quantify the risk of smaller\nloans with similar risk profiles.\n\u2022 Different techniques for measuring the interdependence of factors  that contribute to\ncredit losses. For example, banks may utilise various methods for measuring the correlation\nbetween defaults and rating migrations.\nA bank qualifying for the approach would formally measure its credit risk by developing\nestimates of probability density functions for losses stemming from credit risk (either\nindependently or in joint fashion). The estimates of loss distributions would be made for all\nbusiness (or product) lines within the bank. In order not to stifle the evolution of best\npractices within the risk- modelling arena, a diversity of risk modelling practice would be\npermitted. In the next stage, the calculation of adequate capital could be made for each\nbusiness line and then the business line calculations added up to reach an institution-wide\ncapital allocation.\n3.5.2   Parameter specification and estimation\nThe basic problems in developing models of credit risk are (a) obtaining adequate data and\n(b) devising a satisfactory way of handling the covariability of credit exposures. On data,\nbanks face the difficulty that they have only recently begun to collect relevant information in\na systematic manner. Many do not even know simple facts about defaults in their loan books\ngoing back in time. Although serious, this difficulty is transitional  and will be mitigated as\ntime goes by and perhaps also as banks make arrangements to share data. The more serious\ndata problem is that bank loans and even many corporate bonds are either partly or totally\nilliquid and mark-to-market values are therefore not available. This means that one must rely\non some other measure of value in order to establish and track the riskiness of credit-\nsensitive exposures. The next major problem faced by credit risk analysis is that of\nmodelling the covariation in credit risk across different exposures.\nDue to the current limitations on internal default data, model parameters may require, to\nsome degree, the pooling of information from several sources. The reliability of such data,\nand its comparability with banks\u2019 own portfolio characteristics or default experience, is a\nkey consideration in evaluating accuracy of the credit risk models being visualised.3.5.3   Validation\nIf internal models were to be used in setting regulatory capital requirements, regulators\nwould need some means of ensuring that a bank\u2019s internal model represents accurately the\nlevel of risk inherent in the portfolio and the required regulatory capital.  At present, there is\nno commonly accepted framework for periodically verifying the accuracy of credit risk\nmodels and in future methods such as sensitivity testing are likely to play an important role\nin this process. It is important to note that the internal environment in which a model\noperates \u2013 including the amount of management oversight, the quality of internal controls,\nthe rigour  of stress testing, the reporting process and other traditional features of the credit\nculture \u2013 will also continue to play a key part in the evaluation of a bank\u2019s risk management\nframework.  Estimation of some model parameters, such as the assignment of an internal\nloan grading or assignment of an obligor to one or more industry sectors, may also require\nsome judgement.4.  Portfolio Management and Risk Limits\n4.1 The need for credit portfolio management emanates from the potential adverse impact of\nconcentration of exposures and necessity to optimise the benefits associated with\ndiversification. The conventional approach to credit portfolio management has been largely\nbased on the counterparty exposure limits. The definition of counterparty, specifically in the\nIndian banking system, has focussed on a single company (obligor) and a Promoter Group.\nThe intention has been to specify limits, based on the capital base of the bank, which would\nbe guidelines for incremental asset/exposure build-up. This \u201cforward\u201d or incremental\napproach to credit portfolio management is, to an extent, a reactive strategy and though it\ndoes guide the decision-making process, it possibly has limited contribution for managing\nthe existing credit portfolio of the bank.\n4.2 The recent developments in the measurement and management of portfolio credit risk\nhave been based on two key attributes: correlation and volatility. Though the credit portfolio\nmay be well-diversified and fulfils the prescribed criteria for counterparty exposure limits,\nthe instance of correlation can still be very high and may impact the portfolio quality\n(default levels) under stress conditions. A part of this is on account of the limited definition\nof \u201ccounterparty\u201d. Consider two companies, one operates large capacities in the steel sector\nand the other a large player in the cement sector, promoted by two entirely unrelated\npromoters. Though these would classify as two separate counterparties, both of them may be\nhighly sensitive to the Government\u2019s expenditure in new projects/investments. Thus,\nreduction in Government investments would impact these two companies simultaneously\n(correlation), impacting the credit-quality of such a portfolio (volatility), even though from a\nregulatory or conventional perspective, the risk had been diversified (2 separate promoters, 2\nseparate industries).\n4.3  In addition to the widespread instances of high correlation and resultant volatility, the\nemergence of new techniques for managing a bank\u2019s credit portfolio have actively\ncontributed to the development and adoption of broader credit risk management practices.\nSpecifically, the adoption and wider acceptance of securitisation of loan assets in the\ndeveloped markets has permitted banks to pursue credit portfolio management on a\nproactive note. These have usually been in the nature of collateralised loan obligations.\nThough securitisation of loan receivables, mainly consumer and auto loans, has been\nprevalent in India, it has usually been deployed as an asset acquisition or a hive-off approach\nrather than active credit portfolio management. The steps taken to enhance the liquidity anddepth of debt markets in India and simplify the process of securitisation are expected to\nimprove the prospects of credit portfolio management in the near future.\n4.4  The measurement of credit-portfolio concentration has been elaborated in detail in the\nregulatory prescriptions for counter-party exposures in India. The issue of credit portfolio\ncorrelation is discussed here in some detail. In statistical terms, credit portfolio correlation\nwould mean the number of times companies/counter-parties in a portfolio defaulted\nsimultaneously. As evident, this analysis is impossible in practice and the number of such\ninstances for developing a reasonable generalisation would be too few. Some credit portfolio\nmanagement techniques developed overseas estimate the correlation between defaults and\nbond-market spreads and generalise this for assessing the correlation in a given portfolio.\nGiven the limited data on corporate bond market spreads and their statistical linkages with\nratings in India, this approach may not be appropriate for Indian banks at this stage. In\naddition to the limited replacability of portfolio credit risk management techniques practiced\nin the developed markets, recommendations for the Indian banking system must be based on\ntheir existing systems and procedures and availability of relevant data.\n4.5  One possible technique for analysing credit-portfolio correlation is based on a macro-\neconomic factor model. This approach involves projecting the performance (volatility) of a\ncredit portfolio under altering macro-economic environments. In specific terms, this would\ninvolve a stress-test on the debt-servicing ability of a portfolio of borrowers under\nalternative scenarios. The input data would consist of the projected financial performance\n(income statement & balance sheet details) of each of these portfolio constituents. In the\nappraisal system adopted by Indian banks in general, these are normally developed for\nindividual borrowers for seeking credit approvals from the specific internal authorities. Such\nportfolio constituents could be relatively independent counterparties, spanning a relatively\nwide spectrum of region, industry, size of operation, adoption of technology and promoters.\nThe key financial parameters of these counterparties (growth, profitability, access to funds,\netc.) should be linked to the macro-economic parameters under consideration. Some of the\nrelevant macro-economic parameters could include overall growth rates, growth in exports,\nindustrial and agricultural sectors, interest rates, exchange rates, import duties and equity\nmarket and liquidity conditions. By developing alternative scenarios for these parameters,\nthe credit-portfolio\u2019s aggregate performance (default rates and levels) can be assessed and\npossible correlation between a set of obligors (even though they constitute entirely separate\ncounterparties) may be established. For instance, under the assumptions of low overalleconomic growth, poor growth in agriculture sector and reduction in import duties, the\nassessment may give some correlation between the borrowers in the petrochemicals industry\nand the consumer-electronics industry. Though there may not be any \u201c counterparty\u201d\nrelationship in this set of borrowers, both of them are possibly susceptible to reduced import\nduties and low economic growth. These illustrations are relatively simplistic and the detailed\nanalysis, as discussed above, may give critical inputs for minimising the credit risk of the\ngiven portfolio. A possible advantage of starting with the macro-economic factor model is\nthat it is amenable to the current levels of credit risk assessment practices in Indian Banks\nand can be correspondingly adopted with relative ease. Though superior and more\nsophisticated tools have been developed, their findings may be limited due to the lack of\nrepresentative data. Such options can be considered as Indian Banks further enhance their\ninternal systems and processes in credit risk management.5.  Inter-bank Exposure/ Credit Limits\n5.1 During the course of its business, a bank often incurs exposures to other banks often on a\nreciprocal basis, in support of trade transactions, money placements for liquidity management\npurposes, hedging, for trading and transactional banking services such as clearing and custody.\nBanks are natural counterparties for several transactions and it is therefore, important that a\nproper credit evaluation of the banks is undertaken similar to the assessment done for\ncompanies.\n5.2  Previous default experience in the financial sector has shown that the governments will\nnormally support a large bank in difficulty, as this will otherwise have a ripple effect across the\nbanking industry in particular and the economy in general. However, the South East Asian\ncrisis has shown that this support cannot be taken for granted. The experience in Korea and\nIndonesia are cases in point, where the existing lenders were perforce to rollover the lines of\ncredit for a number of years. Over the past few years, the global credit environment has\nchanged from a relatively stable condition to a state of extreme volatility, and banks cannot\nremain insulated from these exogenous factors.\n5.3 Sophisticated risk assessment of bank exposures is vital to the sustained growth of any\nbank, and must cover past data and future trends. It must cover both the interpretation of the\nbank's financial statements as well as forming a judgement on non-financial areas such as\nmanagement, ownership, peer/market perception and country factors.\n5.4 The key financial parameters to be evaluated for any bank are:\na)Capital Adequacy\nb)Asset Quality\nc)Liquidity\nd)Profitability\n5.4.1 Capital  Adequacy\n5.4.1.1 Banks with high capital ratios above the Basel Committee\u2019s minimum levels,\nparticularly Tier I, will be assigned a high rating whereas the banks with low ratios well below\nthe Basel standards and with low ability to access capital will be at the other end of the\nspectrum.\n5.4.1.2  Capital adequacy needs to be appropriate to the size and structure of the balance sheet\nas it represents the buffer to absorb losses during difficult times, whereas over capitalizationcan impact overall profitability. Related to the issue of capitalization, is also the ability to raise\nfresh capital as and when required. Publicly listed banks and state owned banks may be best\npositioned to raise capital whilst the private banks or regional banks are dependant entirely on\nthe wealth and/or connections of their owners.\n5.4.1.3  The capital adequacy ratio is normally indicated in the published audited accounts. In\naddition, it will be useful to calculate the Capital/Total Assets ratio which indicates the owners'\nshare in the assets of the business. The ratio of Tier I capital to Total Assets represents the\nextent to which the bank can absorb a counterparty collapse. Tier I capital is not owed to\nanyone and is available to cover possible losses. It has no maturity or repayment requirement,\nand is expected to remain a permanent component of the counterparty's capital.\n5.4.1.4  The Basel standards currently require banks to have a capital adequacy ratio of 8%\nwith Tier I ratio at 4%. The Reserve Bank of India requirement is 9%. The Basel Committee is\nplanning to introduce the New Capital Accord and these requirements could change the\ndimension of the capital of banks.\n5.4.2  Asset Quality\n5.4.2.1 The asset portfolio in its entirety should be evaluated and should include an assessment\nof both funded lines and off-balance sheet items. The quality of the loan book will be reflected\nin the non-performing assets and provisioning ratios, whilst exposure to the capital market and\nsensitive sectors will be indicated by the high volatility, affecting both valuations and earnings.\n5.4.2.2 The key ratios to be analyzed are charge- offs/Gross Loans ratio, Non-performing\nLoans/Gross Loans ratio, Provisions/Gross Loans ratio and Provisions/Non-Performing Loans\nratio.\n5.4.2.3  Some issues which should be taken cognisance of, and which require further critical\nexamination are:\n-where exposure to a particular sector is above 10% of total assets\n-where a significant part of the portfolio is to counterparties based in countries which are\nconsidered to be very risky\n- where non-performing advances which are not provided for are above 5% of the loan\nassets.\n-  where loan loss provision is less than 50% of the Gross NPA.\n-where high risk/return lending accounts for the majority of the assets.-rapid rates of loan growth. These can be a precursor to reducing asset quality as periods of\nrapid expansion are often followed by slow downs which make the bank vulnerable.\n-net impact of mark-to-market values of treasury transactions.\n-correlation between the off-balance sheet items to the total assets.\n5.4.2.4 Commercial banks are increasingly venturing into investment banking activities where\nasset considerations additionally focus on the marketability of the assets, as well as the quality\nof the instruments. Investments should be reflected on mark-to market basis and sticky\ninvestments should be treated as \"non-performing\".\n5.4.3  Liquidity\n5.4.3.1  Commercial bank deposits generally have a much shorter contractual maturity than\nloans, and liquidity management needs to provide a cushion to cover anticipated deposit\nwithdrawals.  The key ratios to be analyzed are Total Liquid Assets/Total Assets ratio (the\nhigher the ratio the more liquid the bank is), Total Liquid Assets/Total Deposits ratio (this\nmeasures the bank's ability to meet withdrawals), Loans/Deposits ratio and the inter-bank ratio.\n5.4.3.2  It is necessary to develop an appropriate level of correlation between assets and\nliabilities. Account should be taken of the extent to which borrowed funds are required to\nbolster capital and the respective redemption profiles.\n5.4.3.3  Generally liquid asset/total deposits ratio of 40% and above is considered to be good.\nOn the other hand, an inter-bank ratio of 35% or higher, high reliance on liquid assets which are\nexposed to the vagaries of the capital markets, continued downward trend in the liquidity ratios,\nand lack of core deposits should be viewed with caution.\n5.4.4  Profitability\n5.4.4.1  A consistent year on year growth in profitability is required to provide an acceptable\nreturn to shareholders and retain resources to fund future growth. The key ratios to be analyzed\nare Return on Average Assets (measures a bank's growth/decline in comparison with its\nbalance sheet expansion/contraction), Return on Equity (provides an indication of how well the\nbank is performing for its owners), Net Interest Margin (measures the difference between\ninterest paid and interest earned, and therefore a bank's ability to earn interest income) and\nOperating Expenses/Net Revenue (the cost/income ratio of the bank).5.4.4.2  The degree of reliance upon interest income compared with fees earned, heavy\ndependency on certain sectors, and the sustainability of income streams are relevant factors to\nbe borne in mind.\n5.5 In addition to the quantitative indices, other key parameters to be assessed are:\nOwnership\n5.5.1  The spread and nature of the ownership structure is important, as it impinges on the\npropensity to introduce additional capital. Support from a large body of shareholders is\ndifficult to obtain if the bank's performance is adverse, whilst a smaller shareholder base\nconstrains the ability to garner funds. Where the shareholder base is narrow, or where a\nsingle party is the majority shareholder, then the asset book should be examined closely.\nManagement Ability\n5.5.2  Frequent changes in senior management, change in a key figure, and the lack of\nsuccession planning need to be viewed with suspicion. Risk management is a key indicator\nof the management's ability as it is integral to the health of any institution. Risk management\nshould be deeply embedded and respected in the culture of the financial institution.\nPeer Comparison/Market Perception\n5.5.3  It is recognized that balance sheets tend to show different structures from one country to\nanother, and from one type of bank to another. Accordingly, it is appropriate to assess a bank's\nfinancial statements against those of its comparable peers.\nSimilarly market sentiment is highly important to a bank's ability to maintain an adequa te\nfunding base, but is not necessarily reflective of published information. Account needs to be\ntaken where the overall performance of the peer sector in general falls below international\nstandards.\nImportance of the Bank in the Economy\n5.5.4  This will give an idea about the support which the bank can get from the government.\nBanks which are systemically important to the country's banking system and national stability\nare likely to get a higher level of Government support.\nCountry of Incorporation/Regulatory Environment\n5.5.5  Country risk needs to be evaluated, as even if a bank is financially strong, it may not be\npermitted to meet its commitments in view of the regulatory environment or the financial state\nof the country in which it is operating in.5.6  Based on the above factors the banks should be rated  (called bank tierings). An\nindicative tiering scale is:\nBank Tier Description\n1 Low risk\n2 Modest risk\n3 Satisfactory risk\n4 Fair Risk\n5 Acceptable Risk\n6 Watch List\n7 Substandard\n8 Doubtful\n9 Loss\n5.7 Facilities\nFacilities to banks can be classified into three categories:\na) on balance sheet items such as cash advances, bond holdings and investments, and off-\nbalance sheet items which are not subject to market fluctuation risk such as guarantees,\nacceptances and letters of credit.\nAll these lines should be credit risk weighted at 100 pct.\nb)    facilities which are off-balance sheet and subject to market fluctuation risk such as FEX\nand derivative products.\nc) Settlement facilities\nThese  cover risks arising through payment systems or through settlement of treasury\nand securities transactions.\nThe tiering system enables a bank to establish internal parameters to help determine acceptable\nlimits to a particular banking group. These parameters should be used to determine the\nmaximum level of (a), (a) and (b), maximum tenors for term products which may be considered\nprudent for a bank, and settlement limits.\nMedium term loan facilities and standby facilities should be sanctioned very exceptionally.\nStandby lines, by their very nature, are likely to be drawn only at a time when the risk in\nmaking funds available is generally perceived to be unattractive.\nThe credit risk management of exposure to banks should be centralized. Bank-wise exposure\nlimits should be set taking into account the counterparty and country risks.6. Off Balance Sheet Exposure\nAssessment of Limits\n6.1. The mechanics involved in the assessment of non-fund lines should be similar to those\nentailed in the assessment of funded lines. A non-fund line will become a funded liability in\ncase the customer is not able to meet his commitments. Banks, whilst assessing the funded\nlines, should take into account the level of Letters of Credit ( LCs) and usance LCs proposed\nto be sanctioned to the customer. Sanction of such lines would in many cases lower the level\nof the funded requirement of the company.\n6.2 Banks must also ensure that the security, which is available to the funded lines, also covers\nthe LC lines and the guarantee facilities. On some occasions, it will be appropriate to take a\ncharge over the fixed assets as well, especially in the case of long term guarantees.\n6.3  In the case of guarantees covering contracts, banks must ensure that the clients have the\nrequisite technical skills and experience to execute the contracts. The value of the contracts\nmust be determined on a case-by-case basis, and separate limits should be set up for each\ncontract. The progress vis-\u00e0-vis physical and financial indicators should be monitored\nregularly, and any slippages should be highlighted in the credit review.\n6.4  As contracts are generally for a term of 2-3 years, banks must obtain cash flows over this\ntime horizon, arising from the specific contract they intend to support, and determine the\nviability of financing the contract.\n6.5  Financial guarantees and EPCG guarantees are generally long term in nature, and\nassessment of these requirements should be similar to the evaluation of requests for term loans.\n6.6  The temptation to sanction non-fund lines is high in view of the substantial commission\nincomes which can be obtained. However, as such lines could crystallize into funded liabilities,\nthe utmost care should be taken whilst extending these facilities.7. Country and Transfer Risk\n7.1 Country risk  is the possibility that a country will be unable to service or repay its debts\nto foreign lenders in a timely manner. In banking this risk arises on account of cross border\nlending and investment.  The risk manifests itself either in the inability  or the\nunwillingness  of the obligor to meet its liability.\nCountry risk comprises of the following risks:\n? Transfer risk which is the core risk under country risk, arises on account of the\npossibility of losses due to restrictions on external remittances. Consequently, an obligor\nmay be able to pay in local currency, but may not be able to pay in foreign currency.\nThis type of risk may occur when foreign exchange shortages either close or restrict a\ncountry\u2019s cross border foreign exchange market.\n? Sovereign risk  is associated with lending to government of a sovereign nation or to\ntaking government guarantees. The risk lies in the fact that sovereign entities may claim\nimmunity from legal process or might not abide by a judgement, and it might prove\nimpossible to secure redress through legal action. The fact that `sovereigns cannot go\nbust\u2019 does not mean that there is no risk involved in sovereign lending, for the risk may\nmanifest itself in terms of rehabilitation of an indebted country in terms of financial\nsolvency and liquidity for which there may be rescheduling of country debt or external\ndebt.\n? Non-sovereign or political risk  involves risk to lenders/investors that the repatriation of\ntheir loan/investment in a particular country is restricted for political reasons.  Non-\nsovereign risk includes, in addition to sovereign risk, private claims and direct\ninvestments like lending to corporates and project finance lending and includes risks\nassociated with legal frameworks, economic environment, political environment,\nlegislative process, risks of appropriation and expropriation.\n? Cross border risk  \u2013 arises on account of the borrower being a resident of a country\nother than where the cross border asset is booked, and includes exposures to local\nresidents denominated in currencies other than the local currency.\n? Currency risk  is the possibility that exchange rate changes will alter the expected\namount of principal and return of the lending or investment.  At times, banks may try to\ncope with this specific risk on the lending side by shifting the risk associated with\nexchange rate fluctuations to the borrowers. The risk however does not get extinguished,\nbut gets converted to credit risk.? Macroeconomic and Structural Fragility Risk has come into prominence after the\nEast Asian crises of 1990s. In these crises firms could purchase foreign exchange to\nservice foreign debt but collapse of exchange rates and surge in interest rates due to\nsevere government restrictions on firms owning external debt resulted in highly\nunfavourable exchange rates and very high interest costs on domestic borrowings for\nthese firms. This severely impaired these firms\u2019 ability to service foreign debt. The\nstructural fragility risk can also include that associated with poor development of\ndomestic bankruptcy laws and weak courts for their enforcement.\n7.2  Broad Contours of CRM\nThe broad contours of CRM are:\nI. CR Assessment\nCR assessment is concerned with the assessment of the risk associated with lending to or\ninvesting in a country, taking into account various economic, social and political factors. For\ncountry risk assessment , lending banks may use various methods to evaluate the relative\nrisks of interruption in the servicing or repayment of obligations by borrowers of a particular\ncountry.  The basis of such assessment may be statistical and other information available\nfrom national and international sources on a country\u2019s economic policy, outlook for\ndevelopment, political and social stability, as also direct experience of local conditions from\nstaff stationed there/visits by staff.  Banks may use their own ratings on the basis of internal\nevaluation or depend upon the external ratings for CRM. In addition to ratings provided by\nrating agencies, certain periodicals like \u201cInstitutional Investor\u201d and \u201c Euromoney\u201d also\nprovide country ratings.\nII. Country Limits\nBanks should fix limits on various categories of lendings and investments based on the\nassessment of the risk.  Country limits may normally suggest the maximum exposure,\nbarring special conditions, which may warrant or justify exposure higher than the limit that\ncould be taken on a country given its risk rating.  Country exposure  is an individual bank\u2019s or\nbanking group\u2019s exposure in its total claims on borrowers, in individual foreign countries,\nwhich may be higher or lower than the actual country limit. Measures of exposure take into\naccount guarantees or other factors that could transfer country risk to a different country\nthan that of the borrower. Essentially country exposure consists of all assets, which\nrepresent claims on residents of another country.III. Monitoring of Country Exposures\nBanks should monitor their exposure \u2013 country by country \u2013 on an ongoing basis to ensure\nthat units operate within their limits. For ongoing monitoring banks use early warnings\nindicators. These indicators cover general economic indicators viz. GDP  growth rate,\ninflation, unemployment, fiscal deficit, foreign exchange ( FX) reserves, etc.; welfare and\nequity indicators viz. rise in unemployment, fall in savings and/or investment, etc.; internal\nbalance like rise in fiscal deficit, inflation and debt; external balance indicators like large\ntrade deficit, heavy debt burden, large negative errors and omissions and fall in reserves.\nCertain critical levels and significant variations have been defined. Any significant changes\nand breach of critical levels would warrant a relook at country limits. International banks\nalso keep contingency action plans ready for dealing with sudden deterioration in country\nrisk rating.8. Loan Review Mechanism/ Credit Audit\nCredit Audit examines compliance with extant sanction and post-sanction processes and\nprocedures laid down by the Bank from time to time.\n8.1 Objectives of Credit Audit\n? Improvement in the quality of credit portfolio\n? Review sanction process & compliance status of large loans\n? Feedback on regulatory compliance\n? Independent review of Credit Risk Assessment\n? Pick-up early warning signals and suggest remedial measures\n? Recommend corrective action to improve credit quality, credit administration and\ncredit skills of staff\n8.2 Structure of Credit Audit Department\nThe credit audit / loan review mechanism may be assigned with a specific Department or the\nInspection and Audit Department.\n8.3 Functions of Credit Audit Department\n? To process Credit Audit Reports\n? To follow up with controlling authorities\n? To process the responses received and arrange for closure of the relative Credit Audit\nReports\n? To apprise the Top Management\n? To analyse Credit Audit findings and advise the departments/functionaries concerned\n? To maintain database of advances subjected to Credit Audit\n8.4 Scope and coverage of Credit Audit\n? Only standard assets, commercial advances accounts with total indebtedness above\nthe prescribed cut-off are covered.\n? All accounts of sister/associate concerns of the units at the same branch even with\nindebtedness of less than cut-off amount are also examined to verify whether the\nconduct of these accounts is prima facie in order.\n? A percentage of accounts below the cut-off amount are also subjected to Credit Audit\non random sample basis.\n8.5 Frequency of Credit AuditEach account required to be audited is subjected to audit within a period of 3 to 6 months of\nits sanction/enhancement/renewal.\n8.6 Procedure is followed for Credit Audit\n? Credit Audit is conducted on site, i.e. at the branch which has appraised the advance\nand where the main operative credit limits are made available.\n? Report on conduct of accounts of allocated limits are to be called from the allocatee\nbranches.\n? Credit auditors are not required to visit borrowers\u2019 factory/office premises.\n8.7 Major areas are examined during Credit Audit\n? Appraisal\n? Conformity with guidelines\n? CRA rating\n? Assessment\n? Sanction\n? Follow-up\n? Supervision\n? Monitoring & Control\n? Early warning signals\n? Asset quality\n? Portfolio concentration\n9. RAROC  Pricing/ Economic Profit\n9.1 In acquiring assets, banks should use the pricing mechanism in conjunction with\nproduct/geography/industry/tenor limits. For example, if a bank believes that construction\nloans for suburban malls are unattractive from a portfolio perspective, it can raise the price\nof these loans to a level that will act as a disincentive to borrowers. This is an instance of\nmarginal cost pricing -the notion that the price of an asset should compensate the institution\nfor its marginal cost as measured on a risk-adjusted basis. The more a product increases a\nlender's portfolio concentration, the higher its marginal cost to that lender. Marginal cost\npricing may not always work. A bank may have idle capacity-a large cost base and capital\nthat has not been deployed. While such an institution clearly would not want to make a loanat a negative spread, it would probably view even a small positive spread as worthwhile as\nlong as the added risk was acceptable.\n9.2 Institutions tend to book unattractively priced loans when they are unable to allocate\ntheir cost base with clarity or to make fine differentiations of their risks. If a bank cannot\nallocate its costs, then it will make no distinction between the cost of lending to borrowers\nthat require little analysis and the cost of lending to borrowers that require a considerable\namount of review and follow up. Similarly, if the spread is tied to a too coarsely graded risk-\nrating system (one, for example, with just four grades) then it is more difficult to\ndifferentiate among risks when pricing than if the risk rating is graduated over a larger scale\nwith, say, 15 grades.\n9.3 A cost-plus-profit pricing strategy  will work in the short run, but in the long run\nborrowers will balk and start looking for alternatives. Cost-plus- profit pricing will also\nwork when a bank has some flexibility to compete on an array of services rather than\nexclusively on price. The difficulties with pricing are greater in markets where the lender is\na price taker rather than a price leader.\nTraditional pricing for credit risk has followed the cost-plus-profit approach as, shown in\nFigure.\n9.4 Thus the pricing is based on the borrower's risk rating, tenor, collateral, guarantees, and\ncovenants. A capital charge is applied based on a hurdle rate and a capital ratio. The historic\nloan loss rate used for each of the risk-rating categories is used to calculate the expected lossBorrowerFacility\nFinal\nPrice\nAnalyse Borrower\nCharacteristics\nIndustry\nFinancial statements\nManagement\nBusiness PlansPricing base\nPrime/LIBOR/MIBOR\nCredit Spread Based on\nBorrower Rating\nTenor\nCollateral\nGuarantees\nCovenants\nMatched Funding Cost\nCapital Charge\nOverhead\nOther fees\nCompetitionallowance to be built into the price. The two other inputs needed are the capital ratio and the\nrequired rate of return on capital. Using these assumptions, the rate to be charged for a loan\nto a customer with a given rating could be calculated.\n9.5 This relatively simple approach to credit pricing works well as long as the assumptions\nare correct-especially those about the borrower\u2019s credit quality. This method is used in many\nbanks today. The main drawback is that only \u2018expected losses are linked to the borrower\u2019s\ncredit quality. The capital charge on an 8% capital ratio at 16%t (cost of equity) may not be\nsufficient, and the capital charge based on the volatility of losses in the credit risk category\nmay also be too small. If the loan were to default, the loss would      have to be made up\nfrom income from non-defaulting loans. Another drawback of this method is that it\nimplicitly assumes only two possible states for a loan: default or no default. It does not\nmodel the credit risk premium or discount resulting from improvement or decline in the\nborrower's financial condition, which is meaningful only if the asset may be repriced or sold\nat par.\n9.6 Banks have long struggled to find the best ways of allocating capital in a manner\nconsistent with the risks taken. They have found it difficult to come up with a consistent and\ncredible way of allocating capital for such varying sources of revenue as loan commitments,\nrevolving lines of credit (which have no maturity), and secured versus unsecured lending.\nOne approach is to allocate capital to business units based on their asset size. Although it is\ntrue that a larger portfolio will have larger losses, this approach also means that the business\nunit is forced to employ all the capital allocated to it. Moreover, this method treats all risks\nalike. Another approach is to use the regulatory (risk-adjusted) capital as the allocated\ncapital. The problem with this approach is that regulatory capital may or may not reflect the\ntrue risk of a business. For example, for regulatory purposes, a loan to a AAA-rated\ncustomer requires the same amount of capital per Rupees lent as one to a small business. Yet\nanother approach is to use unexpected losses in a sub-portfolio (standard deviation of the\nannual losses taken over time) as a proxy for capital to be allocated. The problem with this\napproach is that it ignores default correlations across sub-portfolios. The volatility of a sub-\nportfolio may in fact dampen the volatility of the institution's portfolio, so pricing decisions\nbased on the volatility of the sub-portfolio may not be optimal. In practical terms, this means\nthat one line of business within a lending institution may sometimes subsidize another.\nRisk Adjusted Return on Capital ( RAROC)9.7 As it became clearer that banks needed to add an appropriate capital charge in the\npricing process, the concept of risk adjusting the return or risk adjusting the capital was\nborn. The value-producing capacity of an asset (or a business) is expressed as a ratio that\nallows comparisons to be made between assets (or businesses) of varying sizes and risk\ncharacteristics. The ratio is based either on the size of the asset or the size of the capital\nallocated to it. When an institution can observe asset prices directly (and/or infer risk from\nobservable asset prices) then it can determine how much capital to hold based on the\nvolatility of the asset. This is the essence of the mark-to-market concept. If the capital to be\nheld is excessive relative to the total return that would be earned from the asset, then the\nbank will not acquire it. If the asset is already in the bank's portfolio, it will be sold. The\navailability of a liquid market to buy and sell these assets is a precondition for this approach.\nWhen banks talk about asset concentration and correlation, the question of capital allocation\nis always in the background because it is allocated capital that absorbs the potential\nconsequences (unexpected losses) resulting from such concentration and correlation causes.\n9.8 Risk-adjusted return on capital ( RAROC) was introduced by Bankers Trust in the late\n1970s. It is based on a mark-to-market concept. As defined by Bankers Trust, RAROC\nallocates a capital charge to a transaction or a line of business at an amount equal to the\nmaximum expected loss (at a 99% confidence level) over one year on an after-tax basis. As\nmay be expected, the higher the volatility of the returns, the more capital is allocated.\nThe higher capital allocation means that the transaction has to generate cash flows\nlarge enough to offset the volatility of returns, which results from the credit risk,\nmarket risk, and other risks taken . The RAROC process estimates the asset value that\nmay prevail in the worst-case scenario and then equates the capital cushion to be provided\nfor the potential loss.\n9.9 There are four basic steps in this process:\nI. Analyze the activity or product and determine the basic risk categories that it contains, for\nexample, interest rate (country, directional, basis, yield curve, optionality), foreign\nexchange, equity, commodity, and credit and operating risks.\n2. Quantify the risk in each category by a market proxy.\n3. Using the historical price movements of the market proxy over the past three years,\ncompute a market risk factor, given by the following equation\nRAROC risk factor = 2.33 x weekly volatility x square root of 52x (I- tax rate)In this equation, the multiplier 2.33 gives the volatility (expressed as a percent) at the 99\npercent confidence level.  The term 52 converts the weekly price movement into an annual\nmovement. The term (I - tax rate) converts the calculated value to an after-tax basis.\n4. Compute the Rupee amount of capital required for each risk category by multiplying the\nrisk factor by the size of the position.\nEstablishing the maximum expected loss in each product line and linking the capital to this\nloss makes it possible to compare products of different risk levels by stating the risk side of\nthe risk-reward equation in a consistent manner. The risk-to-reward ratio thus becomes\ncomparable.\n9.10 RAROC is an improvement over the traditional approach in that it allows one to\ncompare two businesses with different risk (volatility of returns) profiles. Using a hurdle\nrate, a lender can also use the RAROC principle to set the target pricing on a relationship or\na transaction. Although not all assets have market price distribution, RAROC is a first step\ntoward examining an institution\u2019s entire balance sheet on a mark-to-market basis-if only to\nunderstand the risk-return trade- offs that have been made.\n10. New Capital Accord: Implications on Credit Risk\n10.1 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision had released in June 1999 the first\nConsultative Paper on a New Capital Adequacy Framework  with the intention of replacing\nthe current broad-brush 1988 Accord. The Basel Committee has now released a Second\nConsultative Document in January 2001, which contains refined proposals for the three\npillars of the New Accord \u2013 Minimum Capital Requirements, Supervisory Review and\nMarket Discipline.\n10.2 The Committee proposes two approaches, viz., Standardised and IRB for estimating\nregulatory capital.  Under the standardised approach, the Committee desires neither to\nproduce a net increase nor a net decrease, on an average, in minimum regulatory\ncapital, even after accounting for operational risk.    Under the IRB approach, the\nCommittee\u2019s ultimate goals are to ensure that the overall level of regulatory capital is\nsufficient to address the underlying credit risks and also  provides capital incentives\nrelative to the standardised  approach, i.e., a reduction in the risk weighted assets of\n2% to 3% (foundation IRB approach) and 90% of the capital requirement underfoundation approach for advanced IRB approach to encourage banks to adopt IRB\napproach for providing capital.\n10.3 The minimum capital adequacy ratio would continue to be 8% of the risk-weighted\nassets, which cover capital requirements for market (trading book), credit and operational\nrisks. For credit risk , the range of options to estimate capital extends to include a\nstandardised , a foundation  IRB and an advanced IRB approaches.\n10.4.1  Standardised Approach\nUnder the standardised approach, preferential risk weights in the range of 0%, 20%, 50%,\n100% and 150% would be assigned on the basis of external credit assessments.\n10.4.2 IRB Approach\nThe Committee now proposes two approaches \u2013 foundation and advanced - as an alternative\nto standardised approach for assigning preferential risk weights.  Under the foundation\napproach, banks, which comply with certain minimum requirements viz. comprehensive\ncredit rating system with capability to quantify Probability of Default (PD) could assign\npreferential risk weights, with the data on Loss Given Default ( LGD) and Exposure at\nDefault ( EAD) provided by the national supervisors.\nIn order to qualify for adopting the foundation approach, the internal credit rating system\nshould have the following parameters/conditions:\n? each borrower within a portfolio must be assigned the rating before a loan is\noriginated.\n? Minimum of 6 to 9 borrower grades for performing loans and a minimum of 2 grades\nfor non-performing loans.\n? Meaningful distribution of exposure across grades and not more than 30% of the\ngross exposures in any one borrower grade.\n? Each individual rating assignment must be subject to an independent review or\napproval by the Loan Review Department.\n? Rating must be updated at least on annual basis.\n? The Board of Directors must approve all material aspects of the rating and PD\nestimation.\n? Internal and External audit must review annually, the banks\u2019 rating system including\nthe quantification of internal ratings.? Banks should have individual credit risk control units that are responsible for the\ndesign, implementation and performance of internal rating systems.  These units\nshould be functionally independent.\n? Members of staff responsible for rating process should be adequately qualified and\ntrained.\n? Internal rating must be explicitly linked with the banks\u2019 internal assessment of\ncapital adequacy in line with requirements of Pillar 2.\n? Banks must have in place sound stress testing process for the assessment of capital\nadequacy.\n? Banks must have a credible track record in the use of internal ratings at least for the\nlast 3 years.\n? Banks must have robust systems in place to evaluate the accuracy and consistency \u2013\nsystem, processing and the estimation of the PDs.\n? Banks must disclose in greater detail the rating process, risk factors, validation etc.\nof the rating system.\nThe regulators are required to set rules for estimating the value of Loss Given Default\n(LGD) - unrealized portion and Exposure At Default ( EAD).  Under the advanced approach,\nbanks would be allowed to use their own estimates of PD, LGD and EAD, which could be\nvalidated by the supervisors.  Under both the approaches, risk weights would be expressed\nas a single continuous function of the PD, LGD and EAD.  The IRB approach, therefore,\ndoes not rely on supervisory determined risk buckets as in the case of standardised approach.\nThe Committee has proposed an IRB approach for retail loan portfolio, having homogenous\ncharacteristics distinct from that for the corporate portfolio. The Committee is also working\ntowards developing an appropriate IRB approach relating to project finance.\n10.5 The adoption of the New Accord, in the proposed format, requires substantial\nupgradation of the existing credit risk management systems.  The New Accord also provided\nin-built capital incentives for banks, which are equipped to adopt foundation or advanced\nIRB approach.  The adoption of IRB approach, however, impinges upon complying with\nconditionality attached.  Banks, may, therefore, upgrade the credit risk management systems\nfor optimising capital.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Annexure-I\nCredit Risk Models\nA brief overview of the four credit risk models that have achieved global acceptance as\nbenchmarks for measuring stand-alone as well as portfolio credit risk are given below. The\nmodels are\n? Altman's  Z-score model,\n? KMV model for measuring default risk,\n? CreditMetrics, and\n? CreditRisk+.\nThe first two models were developed to measure the default risk associated with an\nindividual borrower. The Z-score model separates the 'bad' firms or the firms in financial\ndistress from the set of 'good' firms who are able to service their debt obligations in time.\nThe KMV model, on the other hand, estimates the default probability of each firm. Thus, the\noutput of this model can be used as an input for risk based pricing mechanism and for\nallocation of economic capital. The other two models are the most frequently used portfolio\nrisk models in credit risk literature. The two models are intended to measure the same risks,\nbut impose different restrictions, make different distributional assumptions and use different\ntechniques for calibration.\n3.4.1 Z-Score Model\nAltman's Z-score model is an application of multivariate discriminant analysis in credit risk\nmodelling. Financial ratios measuring profitability, liquidity, and solvency appeared to have\nsignificant discriminating power to separate the firm that fails to service its debt from the\nfirms that do not. These ratios are weighted to produce a measure (credit risk score) that can\nbe used as a metric to differentiate the bad firms from the set of good ones.\nDiscriminant analysis is a multivariate statistical technique that analyzes a set of variables in\norder to differentiate two or more groups by minimizing the within-group variance and\nmaximizing the between-group variance simultaneously. Altman started with twenty-two\nvariables (financial ratios) and finally five of them were found to be significant. The\nresulting discriminant function1 was\n     5 4 3 2 1999.0 006.0 033.0 014.0 012.0 X X X X X Z ? ? ? ? ?\nWhere,\n                                                         ?1X Working Capital / Total Assets,\n  ?2X Retained Earnings / Total Assets,\n  ?3X  Earnings before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets,\n  ?4X  Market Value of Equity / Book Value of Total Liabilities,\n  ?5X  Sales / Total Assets.\nAltman found a lower bound value of 1.81 (failing zone) and an upper bound of 2.99 (non-\nfailing zone) to be optimal. Any score in-between 1.81 and 2.99 was treated as being in the\nzone of ignorance.\nThis original Z-score model was revised and modified several times in order to find the\nscoring model more specific to a particular class of firms. These resulted in the private firm's\nZ-score model, non-manufacturers' Z-score model and Emerging Market Scoring ( EMS)\nmodel.\n3.4.2 KMV Model\nKMV Corporation has developed a credit risk model2 that uses information on stock prices\nand the capital structure of the firm to estimate its default probability. This model is based\non Merton's (1973) analytical model of firm value. The starting point of this model is the\nproposition that a firm will default only if its asset value falls below a certain level ( default\npoint ), which is a function of its liability. It estimates the asset value of the firm and its asset\nvolatility from the market value of equity and the debt structure in the option theoretic\nframework. Using these two values, a metric ( distance from default  or DfD) is constructed\nthat represents the number of standard deviations that the firm's asset value is away from the\ndefault point. Finally, a mapping is done between the DfD values and actual default rate,\nbased on the historical default experience. The resultant probability is called Expected\nDefault Frequency  (EDF).\nIn summary, EDF is calculated in the following three steps:\ni) Estimation of asset value and asset volatility from equity value and volatility of\nequity return,\nii) Calculation of distance from default:\nThe DfD is calculated using the following formula:\n                                                       Volatility Asset Value Assetpo Default Value AssetDfD*int ??\niii) Calculation of expected default frequency.\n3.4.3 CreditMetrics Approach\nIn April 1997, J.P. Morgan released the CreditMetrics  Technical Document3 that\nimmediately set a new benchmark in the literature of portfolio risk management. This\nprovides a method for estimating the distribution of the value of the assets in a portfolio\nsubject to changes in the credit quality of individual borrower. A portfolio consists of\ndifferent stand-alone assets, defined by a stream of future cashflows. Each asset has a\ndistribution over the possible range of future rating class. Starting from its initial rating, an\nasset may end up in any one of the possible rating categories.  Each rating category has a\ndifferent credit spread, which will be used to discount the future cash flows. Moreover, the\nassets are correlated among themselves depending on the industry they belong to. It is\nassumed that the asset returns are normally distributed and change in the asset returns causes\nthe change in the rating category in the future. Finally, the simulation technique is used to\nestimate the value distribution of the assets. A number of scenarios are generated from a\nmultivariate normal distribution, which is defined by the marginal rating transition\ndistribution of the individual assets and the correlation values among them. Each scenario\nindicates a future state to which an asset can migrate. Discounting by the appropriate credit\nspread, the future value of the asset is estimated. Generation of a large number of scenarios\ncan give a fair idea on the distribution of asset values. The mean asset value, asset volatility,\npercentile level and the marginal risk volume can summarize the output of this model.\nThough there are a few subtle issues that have been raised by practitioners regarding the\nimplementation of this model, e.g., the estimation of correlation between the credit quality\nof two assets, CreditMetrics should be viewed as the first attempt to address a long-standing\nproblem in portfolio risk measurement.\n3.4.4 CreditRisk+\nCreditRisk+, introduced by Credit Suisse Financial Products ( CSFP), is a model of default\nrisk. Each asset has only two possible end-of-period states: default and non-default. In the\nevent of default, the lender recovers a fixed proportion of the total exposure. The default rateis considered as a continuous random variable. It does not try to estimate the default\ncorrelation directly. Here, the default correlation is assumed to be determined by a set of risk\nfactors. Conditional on these risk factors, default of each obligor follows a Bernoulli\ndistribution. To get the unconditional probability generating function for the number of\ndefaults, it assumes that the risk factors are independently gamma-distributed random\nvariables.  The final step in CreditRisk+ is to obtain the probability generating function for\nlosses. Conditional on the number of default events, the losses are entirely determined by the\nexposure and the recovery rate. Thus, the distribution of asset values can be estimated from\nthe following input data:\n? Exposure of individual asset\n? Expected default rate\n? Default rate volatilities\n? Recovery rate given default\n? Risk sectors\nThe CreditRisk+ manual4 provides the recurrence relation used to calculate the value\ndistribution.\n                                                                                                                                                                          3 Source: CreditMetricsTM : The Benchmark for Understanding Credit Risk.  Technical Document by\nGupton, G.M., Finger, C.C., and Bhatia, M.; New York: J.P.Morgan, Inc.Annexure-II\nThe mechanics for the derivation of PD, LGD in the Internal Rating Based ( IRB) Approach\nin the proposed New Capital Accord are presented below.\n(a) Probability of Default (PD)\nThere are two scenarios for the estimation of PD, viz., Underlying borrower \u2013 no third-\nparty guarantor or credit protection seller and Underlying borrower supported by\nguarantee or credit derivative\nUnderlying borrower \u2013 no third-party guarantor or credit protection seller\nThe PD of an exposure is the greater of the one-year PD associated with the internal\nborrower grade to which that exposure is assigned, or 3 basis points (0.03%).\nUnderlying borrower supported by guarantee or credit derivative\nThere are two approaches for the recognition of credit risk mitigation in the form of\nguarantees and credit derivatives: a foundation approach and an advanced approach for\nthose banks which meet the specific minimum requirements.\nPD adjustments for guarantees and credit derivatives under the foundation approach .\nThe effective probability of default (PD*) applicable to the covered portion of the exposure\nwill be:\nPD* = w x PDB + (1- w) x PDG\nwhere:\nPDB is the probability of default of the obligor ;\nPDG is the probability of default of the guarantor/protection provider; and\nw is the weight applied to the transaction (0 or 0.15) .\nThe uncovered portion of the exposure is assigned the PD of the underlying obligor.\nPD adjustments for guarantees and credit derivatives under the advanced approach\nUnder this option, banks would use their own internal assessment of the degree of risk\ntransfer, within supervisory defined parameters when credit protection in the form of\nguarantees or credit derivatives is taken. Specifically, the guaranteed facility would receive a\nPD appropriate to the borrower or the guarantor\u2019s borrower grade, or an intermediate grade\nif a bank deems full substitution treatment not to be warranted.\n(b) Loss Given Default ( LGD)\n3.5.2 A bank must provide an estimate of the loss given default ( LGD) for each corporate\nexposure. There are two approaches for deriving this estimate: a foundation approach and an\nadvanced approach.Treatment of unsecured claims and non- recognised collateral\nUnder the foundation approach, senior claims on corporates without specifically recognised\ncollateral will be assigned a 50% LGD.\nSubordinated claims on corporates without specifically recognised collateral will be\nassigned a 75% LGD.\nEligible collateral under the foundation approach\nThere are two broad categories of eligible collateral under the foundation IRB approach:\nfinancial collateral and specified commercial and residential real estate collateral (physical\ncollateral).\nMethodology for recognition of financial collateral under the foundation approach\nFollowing the comprehensive approach, the effective LGD applicable to a collateralised\ntransaction can be expressed as follows, where:\n? LGD is that of the unsecured exposure before recognition of collateral (either 50% or\n75%, as above);\n? E is the uncollateralised exposure amount (i.e. cash lent or securities lent or posted);\n? C is the current value of the collateral received;\n? HE, HC, and HFX are haircuts, and\n? w is the floor factor applied to the secured portion of the transaction and is set at 0.15.\nThe adjusted value after haircut of the collateral ( CA ) is:\nCA=C/1+HC+HE+HFX\nIf the value of the exposure exceeds the adjusted value of the collateral, i.e. E > CA ,\nthen:\nLGD* = LGD x [1-(1- w) x (CA/E)]\nIf the value of the exposure is less than the adjusted value of the collateral, i.e. E < CA , then\nLGD* is subject to a floor:\nLGD* = w x LGD\nMethodology for Recognition of CRE and RRE Collateral\nThe methodology for determining the effective LGD ( LGD*) under the foundation approach\nfor cases where banks have taken commercial real estate ( CRE) or residential real estate\n(RRE) collateral to secure a corporate exposure is as follows.\nExposures where the minimum eligibility requirements are met, but the ratio of current\ncollateral value (C) to the nominal exposure (E) is below a threshold level of 30% would\nreceive the appropriate LGD for unsecured exposures or those secured by non- recognised\ncollateral of 50%.Exposures where the ratio of collateral value to the nominal exposure exceeds a second,\nhigher threshold level of 140% would be assigned an LGD of 40%.\n3.6.3 LGD under the Advanced Approach\nSubject to certain additional minimum requirements, supervisors may permit banks to use\ntheir own internal estimates of LGD for corporate exposures. Supervisory recognition of\ninternal estimates of LGD will be limited to banks that meet qualitative and quantitative\nminimum requirements that are more rigorous than those required of institutions making use\nof the foundation IRB approach. Banks eligible for the IRB approach that are unable to meet\nthese higher minimum requirements would utilise the foundation LGD treatment described\nabove.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/23401.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Sep 20, 2001", "info": "Notification No. FEMA. 45 /2001-RB dated September 20, 2001 \n \nReserve Bank of India \nExchange Control Department \nCentral Office \nMumbai-400 001 \n \nNotification No. FEMA.  45    /2001-RB dated September 20, 2001   \nIn exercise of the powers conferred by clause (b) of  sub-section (3) of Section 6 and Section 47 of the \nForeign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) and in partial modification of its Notification No. \nFEMA 20/2000-RB dated 3\nrd May 2000, the Reserve Bank of I ndia makes the following amendments in \nthe Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of  Security by a Person Resident outside India) \nRegulations, 2000, as amended from time to time, namely:-  \n1.

Treatment of restructured accounts\nThe instructions regarding regulatory treatment  of restructured standard and\nsubstandard loans  were conveyed vide  Circular No. DBOD .  BP. BC. 98 & 113 /\n21.04.048/ 2000-2001 dated 30 March 2001 and 30 April 2001 respectively. It is\nfurther clarified that :\n(i) The instructions issued vide the above Circulars  would be applicable to all type\nof credit facilities including working capital limits, extended to industrial units,\nprovided they are fully covered by tangible securities.\n(ii) As trading involves only buying  and selling of commodities  and  the problems\nassociated with manufacturing units such as bottleneck in commercial\nproduction, time and cost escalation etc. are not applicable to them, these\nguidelines should not be applied to restructuring/ rescheduling of credit facilities\nextended to traders.\n(iii) While assessing the extent  of security cover available to the credit facilities,\nwhich are being restructured/ rescheduled,  collateral security would also be\nreckoned, provided such collateral is a tangible security properly charged to the\nbank  and is not in the intangible form like  guarantee etc. of the promoter/\nothers.\n2. Accounting of broken period interest\nBanks were advised  vide the Circular No. BP.

The AS-\n13 prescribes a modified  procedure  for treatment of broken period interest in respect2\nof securities  purchased with the objective of trading. Since AS - 13 is not applicable\nto banks, they  may strictly follow  the guidelines issued by RBI vide the  above\ncircular  for accounting of broken period interest .\n3.  Recognition of income on investments treated as NPAs\nThe investments are also subject to  the prudential norms on income recognition.\nTherefore ,   banks should not book income on accrual basis in respect of any security,\nirrespective of the category in which it is included, where the interest/ principal is in\narrears for more than 180 days. With effect from   31 March 2004,  banks should not\nbook income on accrual basis  if the interest/ principal is in arrears for more than 90\ndays.\n4.  Interest payable on matured deposits\nBanks follow divergent practices   in making  provisions, or otherwise, for interest\npayable on matured deposits.  It was decided that, banks may devise their own policy\nin the matter, based on the past trend/ experience and follow this  policy consistently.\n5.  Credit Card Outstandings\nBanks were advised vide Circular No. BC.BC. 24/ 21.04.048/ 99 dated 30 March\n1999 that outstandings in credit card operations should be shown as part of   \"\nAdvances\".

General\n2. Definitions\n3. Income Recognition\n4. Asset Classification\n5. Provisioning Norms\n1.  GENERAL\n1.1 In line with the international practices and as per the recommendations made by the\nCommittee on the Financial System (Chairman Shri M. Narasimham ), the Reserve Bank of\nIndia has introduced, in a phased manner, prudential norms for income recognition, assetRBI_MC_IRAC_20011\nclassification and provisioning for the advances portfolio of the banks so as to move towards\ngreater consistency and transparency in the published accounts.\n1.2 The policy of income recognition should be objective and based on record of recovery\nrather than on any subjective considerations. Likewise, the classification of assets of banks\nhas to be done on the basis of objective criteria which would ensure a uniform and consistent\napplication of the norms. Also, the provisioning should be made on the basis of the\nclassification of assets based on the period for which the asset has remained non-performing\nand the availability  of  security and the realisable value thereof.\n1.3 With the introduction of prudential norms, the Health Code-based syste m for\nclassification of advances has ceased to be a subject of supervisory interest. As such, all\nrelated reporting requirements, etc. under the Health Code system also cease to be a\nsupervisory requirement. Banks may, however, continue the system at their discretion as a\nmanagement information tool.\n2.  DEFINITIONS\n2.1 Non-performing assets\n2.1.1 An asset, including a leased asset, becomes non-performing when it ceases to\ngenerate income for the bank.  A \u2018non-performing asset\u2019 ( NPA) was defined as a\ncredit facility in respect of which the interest and/ or instalment of principal has\nremained \u2018past due\u2019 for a specified period of time.  The specified period was reduced\nin a phased manner as under:\nYear ending March 31 Specified period\n1993 four quarters\n1994 three quarters\n1995 onwards two quarters\n2.1.2 An amount due under any credit facility is treated as \u201cpast due\u201d when it has\nnot been paid within 30 days from the due date. Due to the improvements in the\npayment and settlement systems, recovery climate, upgradation of technology in the\nbanking system, etc., it was decided to dispense with \u2018past due\u2019 concept, with effect\nfrom March 31, 2001.  Accordingly, as from that date, a Non-performing Asset\n(NPA) shall be an advance where\ni) interest and/or instalment of principal remain overdue for a period of more\nthan 180 days in respect of a Term Loan,\nii) the account remains \u2018out of order\u2019 for a period of more than 180 days, in\nrespect of an Overdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC),\niii) the bill remains overdue for a period of more than 180 days in the case of bills\npurchased and discounted,\niv) interest and/or instalment of principal remains overdue for two harvest seasons\nbut for a period not exceeding two half years in the case of an advance granted\nfor agricultural purposes, and\nv) any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than 180 days\nin respect of other accounts.\n2.1.3 With a view to moving towards international best practices and to ensure\ngreater transparency, it has been decided to adopt the \u201890 days\u2019 overdue\u2019 norm forRBI_MC_IRAC_20012\nidentification of NPAs, from the year ending March 31, 2004.  Accordingly, with\neffect from March 31, 2004, a non-performing asset ( NPA) shall be a loan or an\nadvance where;\ni) interest and/ or instalment of principal remain overdue for a period of more\nthan 90 days in respect of a term loan,\nii) the account remains \u2018out of order\u2019 for a period of more than 90 days, in respect\nof an Overdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC),\niii) the bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bills\npurchased and discounted,\niv) interest and/or instalment of principal remains overdue for two harvest seasons\nbut for a period not exceeding two half years in the case of an advance granted\nfor agricultural purposes, and\nv) any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days\nin respect of other accounts.\n2.2 'Out of Order' status\nAn account should be treated as 'out of order'  if the outstanding balance remains\ncontinuously in excess of the sanctioned limit/drawing power. In cases where the\noutstanding balance in the principal operating account is less than the sanctioned\nlimit/drawing power, but there are no credits continuously for six months as on the\ndate of Balance Sheet or credits are not enough to cover the interest debited during the\nsame period, these accounts should be treated as 'out of order' .\n2.3 \u2018Overdue\u2019\nAny amount due to the bank under any credit facility is \u2018overdue\u2019 if it is not paid on\nthe due date fixed by the bank.\n3. INCOME RECOGNITION\n3.1 Income recognition - Policy\n3.1.1  The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of\nrecovery. Internationally income from non-performing assets ( NPA) is not recognised\non accrual basis but is booked as income only when it is actually received. Therefore,\nthe banks should not charge and take to income account interest on any NPA.\n3.1.2  However, interest on advances against term deposits, NSCs, IVPs, KVPs and\nLife policies may be taken to income account on the due date, provided adequate\nmargin is available in the accounts.\n3.1.3  Fees and commissions earned by the banks as a result of re-negotiations or\nrescheduling of outstanding debts should be recognised on an accrual basis over the\nperiod of time covered by the re-negotiated or rescheduled extension of credit.\n3.1.4  If Government guaranteed advances become NPA, the interest on such\nadvances should not be taken to income account unless the interest has been realised.\n3.2 Reversal of income\n3.2.1 If any advance, including bills purchased and di scounted, becomes NPA as at\nthe close of any year, interest accrued and credited to income account in the\ncorresponding previous year, should be reversed or provided for if the same is not\nrealised. This will apply to Government guaranteed accounts also .RBI_MC_IRAC_20013\n3.2.2 In respect of NPAs, fees, commission and similar income that have accrued\nshould cease to accrue in the current period and should be reversed or provided for\nwith respect to past periods, if uncollected.\n3.2.3 Leased Assets\ni)  The net lease rental s (finance charge) on the leased asset accrued and credited\nto income account before the asset became non-performing, and remaining\nunrealised, should be reversed or provided for in the current accounting\nperiod.\nii) The term 'net lease rentals' would mean the amount of finance charge taken to\nthe credit of Profit & Loss Account and would be worked out as gross lease\nrentals adjusted by amount of statutory depreciation and lease equalisation\naccount.\niii) As per the 'Guidance Note on Accounting for Leases'  issued by the Council\nof the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ( ICAI), a separate Lease\nEqualisation Account should be opened by the banks with a corresponding\ndebit or credit to Lease Adjustment Account, as the case may be. Further,\nLease Equalisation Account should be transferred every year to the Profit &\nLoss Account and disclosed separately as a deduction from/addition to gross\nvalue of lease rentals shown under the head 'Gross Income'.\n3.3 Appropriation of recovery in NPAs\n3.3.1 Interest realise d on NPAs may be taken to income account provided the credits\nin the accounts towards interest are not out of fresh/ additional credit facilities\nsanctioned to the borrower concerned.\n3.3.2 In the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the bor rower for the\npurpose of appropriation of recoveries in NPAs (i.e. towards principal or interest due),\nbanks should adopt an accounting principle and exercise the right of appropriation of\nrecoveries in a uniform  and consistent  manner.\n3.4 Interest Applic ation\nThere is no objection to the banks using their own discretion in debiting interest to an NPA\naccount taking the same to Interest Suspense Account or maintaining only a record of such\ninterest in proforma accounts.\n3.5  Reporting of NPAs\n3.5.1 Banks are required to furnish a Report on NPAs as on 31st March each year after\ncompletion of audit. The NPAs would relate to the banks\u2019 global portfolio, including\nthe advances at the foreign branches. The Report should be furnished as per the\nprescribed format given in the Annexure.\n3.5.2 While reporting NPA figures to RBI, the amount held in interest suspense\naccount, should be shown as a deduction from gross NPAs as well as gross advances\nwhile arriving at the net NPAs.  Banks which do not maintain Interest Suspense\naccount for parking interest due on non-performing advance accounts, may furnish the\namount of interest receivable on NPAs as a foot note to the Report.RBI_MC_IRAC_20014\n3.5.3. Whenever NPAs are reported to RBI, the amount of technical write off, if any,\nshould be reduced from the outstanding gross advances and gross NPAs to eliminate\nany distortion in the quantum of NPAs being reported.\n4. ASSET CLASSIFICATION\n4.1 Categories of NPAs\nBanks are required to classify non-performing assets further into the following three\ncategories based on the period for which the asset has remained non-performing and the\nrealisability of the dues:\na) Sub-standard Assets\nb) Doubtful Assets\nc) Loss Assets\n4.1.1 Sub-standard Assets\nA sub-standard asset was one, which was classified as NPA for a period not\nexceeding two years. With effect from 31 March 2001, a sub-standard asset is one,\nwhich has remained NPA for a period less than or equal to 18 months . In such\ncases, the current net worth of the borrower/ guarantor or the current market value of\nthe security charged is not enough to ensure recovery of the dues to the banks in full.\nIn other words, such an asset will have well defined credit weaknesses that jeopardise\nthe liquidation of the debt and are characterised by the distinct possibility that the\nbanks will sustain some loss, if deficiencies are not corrected .\n4.1.2 Doubtful Assets\nA doubtful asset was one, which remained NPA for a period exceeding two years.\nWith effect from 31 March 2001, an asset is to be classified as doubtful, if it has\nremained NPA for a period exceeding 18 months . A loan classified as doubtful has\nall the weaknesses inherent in assets that were classified as sub-standard, with the\nadded characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, \u2013 on\nthe basis of currently known facts, conditions and values \u2013 highly questionable and\nimprobable.\n4.1.3 Loss Assets\nA loss asset is one where loss has been identified by the bank or internal or external\nauditors or the RBI inspection but the amount has not been written off wholly.  In\nother words, such an asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its\ncontinuance as a bankable asset is not warranted although there may be some salvage\nor recovery value.\n4.2 Guidelines for classific ation of assets\n4.2.1 Broadly speaking, classification of assets into above categories should be done\ntaking into account the degree of well-defined credit weaknesses and the extent of\ndependence on collateral security for realisation of dues.\n4.2.2 Banks should establish appropriate internal systems to eliminate the tendency\nto delay or postpone the identification of NPAs, especially in respect of high value\naccounts.  The banks may fix a minimum cut off point to decide what would\nconstitute a high value account depending upon their respective  business levels. The\ncut off point should be valid for the entire accounting year. Responsibility and\nvalidation levels for ensuring proper asset classification may be fixed by the banks.RBI_MC_IRAC_20015\nThe system should ensure that doubts in asset classification due to any reason are\nsettled through specified internal channels within one month from the date on which\nthe account would have been classified as NPA as per extant guidelines.\n4.2.3 Accounts with temporary deficienci es\n(i) The classification of an asset as NPA should be based on the record of recovery.\nBank should not classify an advance account as NPA merely due to the existence of\nsome deficiencies which are temporary in nature such as non-availability of adequate\ndrawing power based on the latest available stock statement, balance outstanding\nexceeding the limit temporarily, non-submission of stock statements and  non-renewal\nof the limits on the due date, etc. In the matter of classification of accounts with such\ndeficiencies banks may follow the following guidelines:\na) Banks should ensure that drawings in the working capital accounts are covered by\nthe adequacy of current assets, since current assets are first appropriated in times\nof distress. Drawing power is required to be arrived at based on the stock\nstatement which is current.  However, considering the difficulties of large\nborrowers, stock statements relied upon by the banks for determining drawing\npower should not be older than three months.   The outstanding in the account\nbased on drawing power calculated from stock statements older than three  months,\nwould be deemed as irregular.  A working capital borrowal account will become\nNPA if such irregular drawings are permitted in the account for a continuous\nperiod of 180 days even though the unit may be working or the borrower's\nfinancial position is satisfactory.\nb) Regular and ad hoc credit limits need to be reviewed/ regularised not later than\nthree months from the due date/date of ad hoc sanction.  In case of constraints\nsuch as non-availability of  financial statements and other data from the\nborrowers, the branch should furnish evidence to show that renewal/ review of\ncredit limits is already on and  would be completed  soon.  In any case, delay\nbeyond six months is not considered desirable as a general discipline. Hence, an\naccount where the regular/ ad hoc credit limits have not been reviewed/ renewed\nwithin 180 days from the due date/ date of ad hoc sanction will  be treated as\nNPA.\n4.2.4 Accounts regular ised near about the balance sheet date\nThe asset classification of borrowal accounts where a solitary or a few credits are\nrecorded before the balance sheet date should be handled with care and without scope\nfor subjectivity. Where the account indicates inherent weakness on the basis of the\ndata available, the account should be deemed as a NPA.  In other genuine cases, the\nbanks must furnish satisfactory evidence to the Statutory Auditors/Inspecting Officers\nabout the manner of regularisation of the account to eliminate doubts on their\nperforming status.\n4.2.5 Asset Classification to be borrower-wise and not facility-wise\ni) It is difficult to envisage a situation when only one facility to a borrower\nbecomes a problem credit and not others. Therefore, all the facilities granted\nby a bank to a borrower will have to be treated as NPA and not the particular\nfacility or part thereof which has become irregular.RBI_MC_IRAC_20016\nii) If the debits arising out of devolvement  of letters of credit or invoked\nguarantees are parked in a separate account, the balance outstanding in that\naccount also should be treated as a part of the borrower\u2019s principal operating\naccount for the purpose of application of prudential norms on income\nrecognition, asset classification and provisioning.\n4.2.6 Advances under consortium arrangements\nAsset classification of accounts under consortium should be based on the record of\nrecovery of the individual member banks  and other aspects having a bearing on the\nrecoverability of the advances . Where the remittances by the borrower under\nconsortium lending arrangements are pooled with one bank and/or where the bank\nreceiving remittances is not parting  with the share of other member banks, the\naccount will be treated as not serviced in the books of the other member banks and\ntherefore,  be treated as NPA. The banks participating in the consortium should,\ntherefore, arrange to get their share of recovery transferred from the lead bank or get\nan express consent from the lead bank for the transfer of their share of recovery, to\nensure proper asset classification in their respective books.\n4.2.7 Accounts where there is erosion in the value of security\ni) A NPA need not go through the various stages of classification in cases of\nserious credit impairment and such assets should be straightaway classified as\ndoubtful or loss asset as appropriate. Erosion in the value of security can be\nreckoned as significant when the realisable value of the security is less than 50\nper cent of the value assessed by the bank or accepted by RBI at the  time of\nlast inspection, as the case may be. Such NPAs may be straightaway classified\nunder doubtful category  and provisioning should be made as applicable to\ndoubtful assets.\nii) If the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank/ approved\nvaluers/ RBI is less than 10 per cent of the outstanding in the borrowal\naccounts, the existence of security  should be ignored and the asset should be\nstraightaway classified as loss asset. It may be either written off or fully\nprovided for by the bank.\n4.2.8 Advances to PACS/ FSS ceded to Commercial Banks\nIn respect of agricultural advances as well as advances for other purposes granted by\nbanks to ceded PACS / FSS under the on-lending system, only that particular credit\nfacility granted to PACS / FSS which is in default for a period of two harvest seasons\n(not exceeding two half years)/two quarters, as the case may be, after it has become\ndue will be classified as NPA  and not all the credit facilities sanctioned to a PACS /\nFSS. The other direct loans & advances, if any, granted by the bank to the member\nborrower of a PACS/ FSS outside the on-lending arrangement will become NPA even\nif one of the credit facilities granted to the same borrower becomes NPA.\n4.2.9 Advances against Term Deposits, NSC\u2019s, KVP/ IVP, etc\nAdvances against term deposits, NSCs eligible for surrender, IVPs, KVPs and life\npolicies need not be treated as NPAs. Advances against gold ornaments, government\nsecurities and all other securities are not covered by this exemption.\n4.2.10   Loans with moratorium for payment of interestRBI_MC_IRAC_20017\ni) In the case of bank finance given for industrial projects or for agricultural\nplantations etc. where moratorium is available for payment of interest,\npayment of interest becomes 'due' only after the moratorium or gestation\nperiod is over. Therefore, such amounts of interest do not become overdue and\nhence NPA, with reference to the date of debit of interest. They become\noverdue after due date for payment of interest, if uncollected.\nii) In the case of housing loan or similar advances granted to staff members\nwhere interest is payable after recovery of principal, interest need not be\nconsidered as overdue from the first quarter onwards. Such loans/advances\nshould be classified as NPA only when there is a default in repayment of\ninstalment of principal or payment of interest on the respective due dates\n4.2.11   Agricultural advances\ni) In respect of advances granted for agricultural purpose where interest and/or\ninstalment of principal remains unpaid after it has become past due for two\nharvest seasons but for a period not exceeding two half-years, such an advance\nshould be treated as NPA. The above  norms should  be made applicable only\nin respect of short term agricultural loans for production and marketing of\nseasonal agricultural  crops such as paddy, wheat, oilseeds, sugarcane etc. In\nrespect of other activities like horticulture, floriculture or allied activities such\nas animal husbandry, poultry farming etc., assessment of NPA   would be done\nas in the case of other advances.\nii) Where natural calamities impair the repaying capacity of agricultural\nborrowers, banks may decide on their own as a relief measure - conversion of\nthe short-term production loan into a term loan or re- schedulement  of the\nrepayment period; and the sanctioning of fresh short-term loan, subject to\nvarious guidelines contained in RBI circulars RPCD.No.PLFS.BC.128/\n05.04.02/97-98 dated 20.06.98 and RPCD.No.PLFS.BC.9/05.01.04/98-99\ndated 21.07.98.\niii) In such cases of conversion or re- schedulement, the term loan as well as fresh\nshort-term loan may be treated as current dues and need not be classified as\nNPA. The asset classification of these loans would thereafter be governed by\nthe revised terms & conditions and would be treated as NPA if interest and/or\ninstalment of principal remains unpaid, after it has become past due, for two\nharvest seasons but for a period not exceeding two half years.\n4.2.12   Government guaranteed advances\nThe credit facilities backed by guarantee of the Central Government though overdue\nmay be treated as NPA only when the Government repudiates its guarantee when\ninvoked. This exemption from classification of Government guaranteed advances as\nNPA is not for the purpose of recognition of income. With effect from 1st April 2000,\nadvances sanctioned against State Government guarantees should be classified as\nNPA in the normal course, if the guarantee is invoked and remains in default for more\nthan two quarters. With effect from March 31, 2001 the period of default is revised as\nmore than 180 days.\n4.2.13   Restructuring/ Rescheduling of LoansRBI_MC_IRAC_20018\ni) A standard asset where the terms of the loan agreement regarding interest and\nprincipal have been renegotiated or rescheduled after commencement of production\nshould be classified as sub-standard and should remain in such category for at least\none year of satisfactory performance under the renegotiated or rescheduled terms.  In\nthe case of sub-standard and doubtful assets also, rescheduling does not entitle a bank\nto upgrade the quality of advance automatically unless there is satisfactory\nperformance under the rescheduled / renegotiated terms. Following representations\nfrom banks that the foregoing stipulations deter the banks from restructuring of\nstandard and sub-standard loan  assets even though the modification of terms might\nnot jeopardise the assurance of repayment of dues from the borrower, the norms\nrelating to restructuring of standard and sub-standard assets   were reviewed in March\n2001. In the context of restructuring of the accounts, the following stages at which the\nrestructuring / rescheduling / renegotiation of the terms of loan agreement could take\nplace, can be identified:\na) before commencement of commercial production;\nb) after commencement of commercial production but before the asset has\nbeen classified as sub standard,\nc) after commencement of commercial production and after the asset has\nbeen classified as sub standard.\nIn each of the foregoing three stages, the rescheduling, etc., of principal and/or of\ninterest could take place, with or without sacrifice, as part of the restructuring package\nevolved.\nii) Treatment of Restructured Standard Accounts\na) A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone , at any of the\naforesaid first two stages would not cause a standard asset to be classified\nin the sub standard category provided the loan/credit facility is fully\nsecured.\nb) A rescheduling of interest element  at any of the foregoing first two stages\nwould not cause an asset to be downgraded to sub standard category\nsubject to the condition that the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the element\nof interest, measured in  present value terms , is either written off or\nprovision is made to the extent of the sacrifice involved. For the purpose,\nthe future interest due as per the original loan agreement in respect of an\naccount should be discounted to the present value at a rate appropriate to\nthe risk category of the borrower (i.e., current PLR+  the appropriate credit\nrisk premium for the borrower-category) and compared with the present\nvalue of the dues expected to be received under the restructuring package,\ndiscounted on the same basis.\nc) In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present\nvalue terms, as at  (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be\nwritten off or provision made  to the extent of the sacrifice involved.\niii) Treatment of restructured sub-standard accounts\na) A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, would render a sub-\nstandard asset eligible to be continued  in the sub-standard category for the\nspecified period, provided  the loan/credit facility is fully secured .\nb) A rescheduling of interest element would render a sub-standard asset\neligible to be continued  to be classified in  sub standard  category for the\nspecified period subject to the condition that the amount of sacrifice, ifRBI_MC_IRAC_20019\nany, in the element of interest, measured in present value terms , is either\nwritten off or provision is made to the extent of the sacrifice involved. For\nthe purpose, the future interest due as per the original loan agreement in\nrespect of an account should be discounted to the present value at a rate\nappropriate to the risk category of the borrower (i.e., current PLR + the\nappropriate credit risk premium for the borrower-category) and compared\nwith the present value of the dues expected to be received under the\nrestructuring package, discounted on the same basis.\nc) In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present\nvalue terms, as at (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be\nwritten off or provision made to the extent of the sacrifice involved. Even\nin cases where the sacrifice is by way of write off of the past interest dues,\nthe asset should continue to be treated as sub-standard.\niv) Upgradation of restructured accounts\nThe sub-standard accounts which have been subjected to restructuring etc.,\nwhether in respect of principal instalment or interest amount, by whatever\nmodality, would be eligible to be upgraded to the standard category only after\nthe specified period i.e., a period of one year after the date when first payment\nof interest or of principal, whichever is earlier, falls due, subject to satisfactory\nperformance during the period. The amount of provision made earlier, net of\nthe amount provided for the sacrifice in the interest amount in present value\nterms as aforesaid, could also be reversed after the one year period. During\nthis one year period, the sub-standard asset will not deteriorate in its\nclassification if satisfactory performance of the account is demonstrated\nduring the period. In case, however, the satisfactory performance during the\none year period is not evidenced, the asset classification of the restructured\naccount would be governed as per the applicable prudential norms with\nreference to the pre-restructuring payment schedule.\n4.2.14   Availability of security/ net worth of borrower/guarantor\nThe availability of security or net worth of borrower/ guarantor should not be taken\ninto account for the propose of treating an advance as NPA or otherwise, as income\nrecognition is based on record of recovery.\n4.2.15   Take-out Finance\nTakeout finance is the product emerging in the context of the funding of long-term\ninfrastructure projects. Under this arrangement, the institution/the bank financing\ninfrastructure projects will have an arrangement with any financial institution for\ntransferring to the latter the outstanding in respect of such financing in their books on\na pre-determined basis.  In view of the time-lag involved in taking-over, the\npossibility of a default in the meantime cannot be ruled out. The norms of asset\nclassification will have to be followed by the concerned bank/financial institution in\nwhose books the account stands as balance sheet item as on the relevant date.  If the\nlending institution observes that the asset has turned NPA on the basis of the record of\nrecovery, it should be classified accordingly.   The lending institution should not\nrecognise income on accrual basis and account for the same only when it is paid by\nthe borrower/ taking over institution (if the arrangement so provides).  The lending\ninstitution should also make provisions against any asset turning into NPA pending its\ntake over by taking over institution.   As and when the asset is taken over by theRBI_MC_IRAC_200110\ntaking over institution, the corresponding provisions could be reversed.     However,\nthe taking over institution, on taking over such assets, should make provisions treating\nthe account as NPA from the actual date of it becoming NPA even though the account\nwas not in its books as on that date.\n4.2.16   Post-shipment Supplier's Credit\n(i) In respect of post-shipment credit extended by the banks covering export of\ngoods to countries for which the ECGC\u2019s  cover is available, EXIM  Bank has\nintroduced a guarantee-cum-refinance programme whereby, in the event of\ndefault, EXIM  Bank will pay the guaranteed amount to the bank within a\nperiod of 30 days from the day the bank invokes the guarantee after the\nexporter has filed claim with ECGC .\n(ii) Accordingly, to the extent payment has been received from the EXIM Bank,\nthe advance may not be treated as a non-performing asset for asset\nclassification and provisioning purposes.\n4.2.17   Export Project Finance\ni) In respect of export project finance, there could be instances where the actual\nimporter has paid the dues to the bank abroad but the bank in turn is unable to\nremit the amount due to political developments such as war, strife, UN\nembargo, etc.\nii) In such cases, where the lending bank is able to establish through documentary\nevidence that the importer has cleared the dues in full by depositing the\namount in the bank abroad before it turned into NPA  in the books of the bank,\nbut the importer's country is not allowing the funds to be remitted due to\npolitical or other reasons, the asset classification may be made after a period of\none year from the date the amount was deposited by the importer in the bank\nabroad.\n4.2.18   Advances under rehabilitation approved by BIFR/ TLI\nBanks are not permitted to upgrade the classification of any advance in respect of\nwhich the terms have been re-negotiated unless the package of re-negotiated terms has\nworked satisfactorily for a period of one year. While the existing credit facilities\nsanctioned to a unit under rehabilitation packages approved by BIFR /term lending\ninstitutions will continue to be classified as sub-standard or doubtful as the case may\nbe, in respect of additional facilities sanctioned under the rehabilitation packages, the\nIncome Recognition, Asset Classification norms will become applicable after a period\nof one year from the date of disbursement.\n5. PROVISIONING NORMS\n5.1 General\n5.1.1 The primary responsibility for making adequate provisions for any diminution\nin the value of loan assets, investment or other assets is that of the bank managements\nand the statutory auditors. The assessment made by the inspecting officer of the RBI\nis furnished to the bank to assist the bank management and the statutory auditors in\ntaking a decision in regard to making adequate and necessary provisions in terms of\nprudential guidelines.RBI_MC_IRAC_200111\n5.1.2 In conformity with the prudential norms, provisions should be made on the\nnon-performing assets on the basis of classification of assets into prescribed\ncategories as detailed in paragraphs 4 supra. Taking into account the time lag between\nan account becoming doubtful of recovery, its recognition as such, the realisation of\nthe security and the erosion over time in the value of security charged to the bank, the\nbanks should make provision against sub-standard assets, doubtful assets and loss\nassets as below:\n5.2 Loss assets\nThe entire asset should be written off. If the assets are permitted to remain in the books for\nany reason, 100 percent of the outstanding should be provided for.\n5.3 Doubtful assets\ni) 100 percent of the extent to which the advance is not covered by the realisable\nvalue of the security to which the bank has a valid recourse and the realisable\nvalue is estimated on a realistic basis.\nii) In regard to the secured portion, provision may be made on the following basis, at\nthe rates ranging from 20 percent to 50 percent of the secured portion depending\nupon the period for which the asset has remained doubtful:\nPeriod for which the advance has\nbeen considered as doubtfulProvision requirement (%)\nUp to one year 20\nOne to three years 30\nMore than three years 50\niii)Additional provisioning consequent upon the change in the definition of doubtful\nassets ( vide para 4.1.2 above) effective from March 31, 2001 has to be made in\nphases as under:\n? As on 31.03.2001 , 50 percent of the additional provisioning\nrequirement on the assets which became doubtful on account of new norm of\n18 months for transition from sub-standard asset to doubtful category.\n? As on 31.03.2002 , balance of the provisions not made during the\nprevious year, in addition to the provisions needed, as on 31.03.2002 .\nNote:  Valuation of Security for provisioning purposes\nWith a view to bringing down divergence arising out of difference in assessment of the value\nof security ,  in cases of NPAs with balance of Rs. 5 crore and above stock    audit   at   annual\nintervals   by   external agencies appointed as per the guidelines approved by the Board\nwould be mandatory in order to enhance the reliability on stock valuation. Collaterals such as\nimmovable properties charged in favour of the bank should be got valued once in three years\nby valuers appointed as per the guidelines  approved by the Board of Directors.\n5.4 Sub-standard assets\nA general provision of 10 percent on total outstanding should be made without making any\nallowance for DICGC/ ECGC guarantee cover and securities available.\n5.5 Standard assetsRBI_MC_IRAC_200112\ni) From the year ending 31.03.2000 , the banks should make a general provision of a\nminimum of 0.25 percent on standard assets on global loan portfolio  basis.\nii) The provisions on standard assets should not be reckoned for arriving at net\nNPAs.\niii) The provisions towards Standard Assets need not be netted from gross advances\nbut shown separately as 'Contingent Provisions against Standard Assets' under\n'Other Liabilities and Provisions - Others' in Schedule 5 of the balance sheet.\n5.6 Floating provisions\nSome of the banks make a 'floating provision' over and above the specific provisions made in\nrespect of accounts identified as NPAs. The floating provisions, wherever available, could be\nset-off against provisions required to be made as per above stated provisioning guidelines.\nConsidering that higher loan loss provisioning adds to the overall financial strength of the\nbanks and the stability of the financial sector, banks are urged to voluntarily set apart\nprovisions much above the minimum prudential levels  as a desirable practice.\n5.7 Provisions on Leased Assets\ni)     Sub-standard assets\n(a) 10 percent of the 'net book value' .\n(b) As per the 'Guidance Note on Accounting for Leases' issued by the ICAI,\n'Gross book value'  of a fixed asset is its historical cost or other amount\nsubstituted for historical cost in the books of account or financial statements.\nStatutory depreciation should be shown separately in the Profit & Loss\nAccount. Accumulated depreciation should be deducted from the Gross Book\nValue of the leased asset in the balance sheet of the lessor to arrive at the 'net\nbook value' .\n(c) Also, balance standing in 'Lease Adjustment Account' should be adjusted in\nthe 'net book value' of the leased assets. The amount of adjustment in respect\nof each class of fixed assets may be shown either in the main balance sheet or\nin the Fixed Assets Schedule as a separate column in the section related to\nleased assets.\nii)  Doubtful assets\n100 percent of the extent to which the finance is not secured by the realisable\nvalue of the leased asset. Realisable value to be estimated on a realistic basis.\nOver and above  provision as per (a) above, the following provision on the net\nbook value  of the secured portion  should be made, depending upon the period\nfor which asset has been doubtful:\nPeriod %age of provision\nUp to one year 20\nOne to three years 30\nMore than three years 50\niii)  Loss assets\nThe entire asset should be written-off. If for any reason, an asset is allowed to\nremain in books, 100 percent of the 'net book value'  should be provided for.\n5.8 Guidelines for Provisions under Special Circumstances\n5.8.1 Government guaranteed advancesRBI_MC_IRAC_200113\ni) With effect from 31 March 2000, in respect of advances sanctioned against\nState Government guarantee, if the guarantee is invoked and remains in\ndefault for more than two quarters (180 days at present), the banks should\nmake normal provisions as prescribed in paragraph 4.1.2  above.\nii) As regards advances guaranteed by State Governments, in respect of which\nguarantee stood invoked as on 31.03.2000 , necessary provision was allowed\nto be made, in a phased manner, during the financial years ending\n31.03.2000  to 31.03.2003  with a minimum of 25 percent each year.\n5.8.2 Advances granted under rehabilitation packages approved by BIFR/term\nlending institutions\ni) In respect of advances under rehabilitation package approved by BIFR/term\nlending institutions, the provision should continue to be made in respect of\ndues to the bank on the existing credit facilities  as per their classification\nas sub-standard or doubtful asset.\nii) As regards the additional facilities sanctioned as per package finalised by\nBIFR and/or term lending institutions, provision on additional facilities\nsanctioned need not be made for a period of one year  from the date of\ndisbursement.\niii) In respect of additional credit facilities granted to SSI units which are\nidentified as sick [as defined in paragraph 5(a) of RPCD  circular\nNo.PLNFS.BC.99/06.02.031/92-93 dated 17.04.93] and where\nrehabilitation packages/nursing programmes have been drawn by the banks\nthemselves or under consortium arrangements, no provision need be made\nfor a period of one year.\n5.8.3 Advances against term deposits, NSCs eligible for surrender, IVPs, KVPs, and\nlife policies are exempted from provisioning requirements.\n 5.8.4 However, advances against gold ornaments, government securities and all\nother kinds of securities are not exempted from provisioning requirements.\n5.8.5     Treatment of interest suspense account\nAmounts held in Interest Suspense Account should not be reckoned as part of\nprovisions. Amounts lying in the Interest Suspense Account should be deducted from\nthe relative advances and thereafter, provisioning as per the norms, should be made on\nthe balances after such deduction.\n5.8.6     Advances covered by ECGC/ DICGC   guarantee\nIn the case of advances guaranteed by DICGC/ ECGC, provision should be made only\nfor the balance in excess of  the amount guaranteed by these Corporations. Further,\nwhile arriving at the provision required to be made for doubtful assets, realisable\nvalue of the securities should first be deducted from the outstanding balance in respect\nof the amount guaranteed by these Corporations and then provision made as\nillustrated hereunder:\nExample\nOutstanding Balance Rs. 4 lakhs\nDICGC Cover 50 percent\nPeriod for which the advance has remained doubtful More than 3 years\nremained doubtful\nValue of security held\n(excludes worth of Rs.)Rs. 1.50 lakhsRBI_MC_IRAC_200114\nProvision required to be made\nOutstanding balance Rs. 4.00 lakhs\nLess: Value of security held Rs. 1.50 lakhs\nUnrealised balance Rs. 2.50 lakhs\nLess: DICGC Cover\n(50% of unrealisable balance)Rs. 1.25 lakhs\nNet unsecured balance Rs. 1.25 lakhs\nProvision for unsecured portion of advance Rs. 1.25 lakhs (@ 100 percent of\nunsecured portion)\nProvision for secured portion of advance Rs. 0.75 lakhs (@ 50 percent of\nsecured portion)\nTotal provision required to be made Rs. 2.00 lakhs\n5.8.7 Advance covered by CGTSI guarantee\nIn case the advance covered by CGTSI guarantee becomes non-performing, no\nprovision need be made towards the guaranteed portion. The amount outstanding in\nexcess of the guaranteed portion should be provided for as per the extant guidelines\non provisioning for non-performing advances.  Two  illustrative examples are given\nbelow:\nExample I\nAsset classification status: Doubtful \u2013 More than\n3 years;\nCGTSI Cover 75% of the amount\noutstanding or75% of\nthe unsecured amount\nor Rs.18.75 lakh,\nwhichever is the least:\nRealisable value of\nSecurity Rs.1.50 lakh\nBalance outstanding Rs.10.00 lakh\nLess  Realisable value of\nsecurityRs.  1.50 lakh\nUnsecured amount Rs. 8.50 lakh\nLess CGTSI cover (75%) Rs. 6.38  lakh\nNet unsecured and\nuncovered  portion:Rs. 2.12  lakh\nProvision Required\nSecured portion Rs.1.50 lakh Rs.  0.75 lakh (@ 50%)\nUnsecured & uncovered\nportionRs.2.12 lakh  Rs.  2.12 lakh ( 100%)\nTotal provision required Rs.  2.87 lakh\nExample II\nAsset classification status : Doubtful \u2013 More than 3\nyears;\nCGTSI Cover 75% of the amountRBI_MC_IRAC_200115\noutstanding or75% of\nthe unsecured amount\nor  Rs.18.75 lakh,\nwhichever is the least\nRealisable value of Security  Rs.10.00 lakh\nBalance outstanding Rs.40.00 lakh\nLess  Realisable  value of\nsecurityRs. 10.00 lakh\nUnsecured amount Rs. 30.00 lakh\nLess CGTSI cover (75%) Rs. 18.75 lakh\nNet unsecured and uncovered\nportion:Rs. 11.25 lakh\nProvision Required\nSecured portion Rs.10.00 lakh Rs.  5.00 lakh (@ 50%)\nUnsecured & uncovered\nportionRs.11.25 lakh Rs.11.25  lakh ( 100%)\nTotal provision required Rs. 16.25  lakh\n5.8.8 Take-out finance\nThe lending institution should make provisions against a 'take-out finance' turning\ninto NPA pending its take-over by the taking-over institution. As and when the asset\nis taken-over by the taking-over institution, the corresponding provisions could be\nreversed.\n5.8.9 Reserve for Exchange Rate Fluctuations Account ( RERFA)\nWhen exchange rate movements of Indian rupee turn adverse, the outstanding amount\nof foreign currency dominated loans (where actual disbursement was made in Indian\nRupee) which becomes past due, goes up correspondingly, with its attendant\nimplications of provisioning requirements. Such assets should not normally be\nrevalued. In case such assets need to be revalued as per requirement of accounting\npractices or for any other requirement, the following procedure may be adopted:\n? The loss on revaluation of assets has to be booked in the bank's Profit\n& Loss Account.\n? Besides the provisioning requirement as per Asset Classification,\nbanks should treat the full amount of the Revaluation Gain relating to the\ncorresponding assets, if any, on account of Foreign Exchange Fluctuation as\nprovision against the particular assets.\n5.9 Writing-off of NPAs\n5.9.1  In terms of Section 43(D) of the Income Tax Act 1961, income by  way of\ninterest in relation to such categories of bad and doubtful debts as may be prescribed\nhaving regard to the guidelines issued by the RBI in relation to such debts, shall be\nchargeable to tax in the previous year in which it is credited to the bank\u2019s profit and\nloss account or received, whichever is earlier.\n5.9.2  This stipulation is not applicable to provisioning required to be made as\nindicated above. In other words, amounts set aside for making provision for NPAs as\nabove are not eligible for tax deductions.RBI_MC_IRAC_200116\n5.9.3  Therefore, the banks should either make full provision as per the guidelines or\nwrite-off such advances and claim such tax benefits as are applicable, by evolving\nappropriate methodology in consultation with their auditors/tax consultants.\nRecoveries made in such accounts should be offered for tax purposes as per the rules.\n5.10 Write-off at Head Office Level\nBanks may write-off advances at Head Office level, even though the relative advances\nare still outstanding in the branch books. However, it is necessary that provision is\nmade as per the classification accorded to the respective accounts. In other words, if\nan advance is a loss asset, 100 percent provision will have to be made therefor.RBI_MC_IRAC_200117\nAnnexure\nReporting Format for Non-Performing\nAssets  \u2013  Gross  and  Net  Position\n[Vide paragraph 3.5]\nName of the Bank:\nPosition as on \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n(Rupees in crore up to two decimals)\nParticulars Amount\n1.

No.C-11/01.02.00/1999-2000 dated 31 December 1999\nprescribing the Guidelines for ALM System in the FIs. The Guidelines have been in operation\nfor more than a year now and in the process of operationalising the Guidelines, certain issues\nhave arisen which need to be addressed. With a view, therefore, to addressing these issues as also\nto refine the ALM Guidelines, it has been decided to amend the Guidelines, with immediate\neffect, to the extent indicated below.\n2. Time-buckets for slotting of the off-balance sheet items\n In order to clarify the treatment of the contingent cash flows emanating from the off-balance\nsheet items and to ensure their time-bucketing as per the timing of the underlying cash flows, it\nhas been decided to amplify the treatment of some of these items for the purpose of compiling\nthe liquidity and interest rate gap reports. Accordingly, the item C(f) of Appendix I and items\nA.7 and B.12(a) of Appendix II to the aforesaid Circular may please be substituted by the items\nas indicated in the Annexure .\n3. Treatment of  securities in the trading book for Interest Rate Sensitivity statement\nPara 6.3 of the ALM Guidelines, inter alia, stipulates the criteria to be applied for keeping the\nsecurities in the \u2018trading book\u2019. In this context, it has been represented to us that since the\nsecurities in the \u2018trading book\u2019 are already subject to a system of marking-to-market on weekly /\ndaily basis, and the resultant revaluation gains / losses are reflected in the profit and loss account,\nthe interest rate risk of the trading book stands adequately addressed. Hence, the inclusion of the\ntrading book securities in various time-buckets for the purpose of preparing Interest Rate\nSensitivity statement could lead to distortions. It has also been brought out that a ceiling on\nmaximum maturity / duration of the trading portfolio could restrict the development of an active\nmarket in longer-duration securities which could adversely impact their liquidity. Moreover,\nsubsequent to the issuance of the ALM Guidelines in December 1999, we have also issued the\nGuidelines for Classification and Valuation of Investment vide Circular DBS.FID. No. C-9\n/01.02.00/2000-01 dated 9 November 2000 which, inter alia, also require classification of the\ninvestment portfolio of the FIs into three categories including the \u201cHeld for Trading\u201d category.Hence, there is also a need to harmonise the definitions of the \u201cTrading Book\u201d of ALM\nguidelines and the \u201cHeld for Trading\u201d category of the investment portfolio.\n4. However, reckoning that  the FIs are still in a nascent stage of developing risk\nmanagement systems and with a view to keeping the ALM  system simple at the initial stages, it\nhas been decided that the \u201ctrading book\u201d may continue to be covered under the ALM  system, till\nthe ALM  system stabilises  and the FIs are able to migrate to more sophisticated techniques for\nmanagement of interest rate risk, separately for the banking and the trading book.  Meanwhile,\nhowever, the securities in the Trading Book may be slotted as per their residual maturity or\nrepricing maturity for floating rate securities, as against the defeasance period prescribed at\npresent.

However, delay in agreement amongst different lending\ninstitutions often comes in the way of such endeavours.\n1.2 Based on the experience in other countries like the U.K., Thailand, Korea, etc.\nof putting in place institutional mechanism for restructuring of corporate debt and\nneed for a similar mechanism in India, a Corporate Debt Restructuring System has\nbeen evolved, as under :\n2. Objective\nThe objective of the Corporate Debt Restructuring ( CDR) framework is to ensure\ntimely and transparent mechanism for restructuring of the corporate debts of viable\nentities facing problems, outside the purview of BIFR, DRT and other legal\nproceedings, for the benefit of all concerned.  In particular, the framework will aim\nat preserving viable corporates that are affected by certain internal and external\nfactors and minimize the losses to the creditors and other stakeholders through an\norderly and coordinated restructuring programme.\n3. Structure\nCDR system in the country will have a three tier structure :\n\u2022 CDR Standing Forum\n\u2022 CDR Empowered Group\n\u2022 CDR Cell\n3.1  CDR Standing Forum :\n3.1.1 The CDR Standing Forum would be the representative general body of all\nfinancial institutions and banks participating in CDR system. All financial institutions3\nand banks should participate in the system in their own interest. CDR Standing Forum\nwill be a self empowered body, which will lay down policies and guidelines, guide\nand monitor the progress of corporate debt restructuring.\n3.1.2 The Forum will also provide an official platform for both the creditors and\nborrowers (by consultation) to amicably and collectively evolve policies and\nguidelines for working out debt restructuring plans in the interests of all concerned.\n3.1.3 The CDR Standing Forum shall comprise Chairman&  Managing Director,\nIndustrial Development Bank of India; Managing Director, Industrial Credit &\nInvestment Corporation of India Limited; Chairman, State Bank of India; Chairman,\nIndian Banks Association and Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India as well as\nChairmen and Managing Directors of all banks and financial institutions participating\nas permanent members in the system. The Forum will elect its Chairman for a period\nof one year and the principle of rotation will be followed in the subsequent years.\nHowever, the Forum may decide to have a Working Chairman as a whole-time officer\nto guide and carry out the decisions of the CDR Standing Forum.\n3.1.4  A CDR Core Group will be  carved out of the CDR Standing Forum to assist\nthe Standing Forum in convening the meetings and taking decisions relating to policy,\non behalf of the Standing Forum. The Core Group will consist of Chief Executives of\nIDBI, ICICI, SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Indian\nBanks Association and a representative of Reserve Bank of India.\n3.1.5 The CDR Standing Forum shall meet at least once every six months and would\nreview and monitor the progress of corporate debt restructuring system. The Forum\nwould also lay down the policies and guidelines to be followed by the CDR\nEmpowered Group and CDR Cell for debt restructuring and would ensure their\nsmooth functioning and adherence to the prescribed time schedules for debt\nrestructuring. It can also review any individual decisions of the CDR Empowered\nGroup and CDR Cell.\n3.1.6 The CDR Standing Forum, the CDR Empowered Group and CDR Cell\n(described in following paragraphs) shall be housed in IDBI. The administrative and\nother costs shall be shared by all financial institutions and banks. The sharing pattern\nshall be as determined by the Standing Forum.\n3.2   CDR  Empowered Group and CDR Cell\n3.2.1 The individual cases of corporate debt restructuring shall be decided by the\nCDR Empowered Group, consisting of ED level representatives of IDBI, ICICI\nLimited and SBI as standing members, in addition to ED level representatives of\nfinancial institutions and banks who have an exposure to the concerned company. In\norder to make the CDR Empowered Group effective and broad based and operate\nefficiently and smoothly, it would have to be ensured that each financial institution\nand bank, as participants of the CDR system, nominates a panel of two or three EDs,\none of whom will participate in a specific meeting of the Empowered Group dealing\nwith individual restructuring cases. Where, however, a bank / financial institution has\nonly one Executive Director, the panel may consist of senior officials, duly authorized\nby its Board.  The level of representation of banks/ financial institutions on the CDR\nEmpowered Group should be at a sufficiently senior level to ensure that concerned4\nbank / FI abides by the necessary commitments including sacrifices, made towards\ndebt restructuring.\n3.2.2 The Empowered Group will consider the preliminary report of all cases of\nrequests of restructuring, submitted to it by the CDR Cell. After the Empowered\nGroup decides that restructuring of the company is prima-facie feasible and the\nenterprise is potentially viable in terms of the policies and guidelines evolved by\nStanding Forum, the detailed restructuring package will be worked out by the CDR\nCell in conjunction with the Lead Institution.\n3.2.3 The CDR Empowered Group would be mandated to look into each case of debt\nrestructuring, examine the viability and rehabilitation potential of the Company\nand approve the restructuring package within a specified time frame of 90 days,  or at\nbest 180 days of reference to the Empowered Group.\n3.2.4 There should be a general authorisation by the respective Boards of the\nparticipating institutions / banks in favour of their representatives on the CDR\nEmpowered Group, authorising them to take decisions on behalf of their organization,\nregarding restructuring of debts of individual corporates.\n3.2.5 The decisions of the CDR Empowered Group shall be final and action-reference\npoint. If restructuring of debt is found viable and feasible and accepted by the\nEmpowered Group, the company would be put on the restructuring mode. If,\nhowever, restructuring is not found viable, the creditors would then be free to take\nnecessary steps for immediate recovery of dues and / or liquidation or winding up of\nthe company, collectively or individually.\n3.3  CDR Cell\n3.3.1 The CDR Standing Forum and the CDR Empowered Group will be assisted by a\nCDR Cell in all their functions. The CDR Cell will make the initial scrutiny of the\nproposals received from borrowers / lenders, by calling for proposed rehabilitation\nplan and other information and put up the matter before the CDR Empowered Group,\nwithin one month to decide whether rehabilitation is prima facie feasible, if so, the\nCDR Cell will proceed to prepare detailed Rehabilitation Plan with the help of lenders\nand if necessary, experts to be engaged from outside. If not found prima facie\nfeasible, the lenders may start action for recovery of their dues.\n3.3.2 To begin with, CDR Cell will be constituted  in IDBI, Mumbai and adequate\nmembers of staff for the Cell will be deputed from banks and financial institutions.\nThe CDR Cell may also take outside professional help. The initial cost in operating\nthe CDR mechanism including CDR Cell will be met by IDBI initially for one year\nand then from contribution from the financial institutions and banks in the Core\nGroup at the rate of Rs.50 lakh each and contribution from other institutions and\nbanks at the rate of Rs.5 lakh each.\n3.3.3 All references for corporate debt restructuring by lenders or borrowers will\nbe made to the CDR Cell.  It shall be the responsibility of the lead institution /\nmajor stakeholder  to the corporate, to work out a preliminary restructuring plan in\nconsultation with other stakeholders and submit to the CDR Cell within one month.5\nThe CDR Cell will prepare the restructuring plan in terms of the general policies and\nguidelines approved by the CDR Standing Forum and place for the consideration of\nthe Empowered Group within 30 days for decision.  The Empowered Group can\napprove or suggest modifications, so, however, that a final decision must be taken\nwithin a total period of 90 days. However, for sufficient reasons the period can be\nextended maximum upto 180 days from the date of reference to  the CDR Cell.\n4. Other features:\n4.1  CDR will be a Non-statutory mechanism\n4.1.1 CDR mechanism will be a voluntary system based on debtor-creditor agreement\nand inter-creditor agreement.\n4.1.2 The scheme will not apply to accounts involving only one financial institution or\none bank. The CDR mechanism will cover only multiple banking accounts /\nsyndication / consortium accounts with outstanding exposure of Rs.20 crore and\nabove by banks and institutions.\n4.1.3 The CDR system will be applicable only to standard and sub-standard accounts.\nThere would be no requirement of the account / company being sick, NPA or\nbeing in default for a specified  period before reference to the CDR Group. However,\npotentially viable cases of NPAs will get priority.  This approach would provide the\nnecessary flexibility and facilitate timely intervention for debt restructuring.\nPrescribing any milestone(s) may not be necessary, since the debt restructuring\nexercise is being triggered by banks and financial institutions or with their consent. In\nno case, the requests of any corporate indulging in wilful default or misfeasance will\nbe considered for restructuring under CDR.\n4.1.4 Reference to Corporate Debt Restructuring System could be triggered by  (i) any\nor more of the secured creditor who have minimum 20% share in either working\ncapital or term finance, or (ii) by the concerned corporate, if supported by a bank or\nfinancial institution having stake as in ( i) above.\n4.2  Legal Basis\nThe legal basis to the CDR mechanism shall be provided by the Debtor-Creditor\nAgreement ( DCA) and the Inter-Creditor Agreement.  The debtors shall have to\naccede to the DCA, either at the time of original loan documentation (for future cases)\nor at the time of reference to Corporate Debt Restructuring Cell. Similarly, all\nparticipants in the CDR mechanism through their membership of the Standing Forum\nshall have to enter into a legally binding agreement, with necessary enforcement and\npenal clauses, to operate the System through laid-down policies and guidelines.\n4.3  Stand-Still Clause\n4.3.1 One of the most important elements of Debtor-Creditor Agreement would be\n'stand still' agreement binding for 90 days,  or 180 days by both sides. Under this\nclause, both the debtor and creditor(s) shall agree to a legally binding 'stand-still'\nwhereby both the parties commit themselves not to taking recourse to any other6\nlegal action  during the 'stand-still' period, this would be necessary for enabling the\nCDR System to undertake the necessary debt restructuring exercise without any\noutside intervention judicial or otherwise.\n4.3.2 The Inter-Creditors Agreement would be a legally binding agreement amongst\nthe secured creditors, with necessary enforcement and penal clauses, wherein the\ncreditors would commit themselves to abide by the various elements of CDR system.\nFurther , the creditors shall agree that if 75% of secured creditors by value,  agree to\na debt restructuring package, the same would be binding on the remaining secured\ncreditors.\n5. Accounting treatment for restructured accounts\nThe accounting treatment of accounts restructured under CDR would be governed by\nthe prudential norms indicated in circular DBOD. BP. BC. 98 / 21.04.048 / 2000-01\ndated March 30, 2001. Restructuring of corporate debts under CDR could take place\nin the following stages:\n(a) before commencement of commercial production;\n(b) after commencement of commercial production but before the asset has been\nclassified as sub-standard;\n(c) after commencement of commercial production and the asset has been\nclassified as sub-standard.\n6. The prudential treatment of the accounts, subjected to restructuring under CDR,\nwould be governed by the following norms:\n6.1  Treatment of standard accounts restructured under CDR:\na) A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, at any of the aforesaid\nfirst two stages [paragraph 5(a) and (b) above] would not cause a standard\nasset to be classified in the sub-standard category, provided the loan / credit\nfacility is fully secured.\nb) A rescheduling of interest element at any of the foregoing first two stages\nwould not cause an asset to be downgraded to sub-standard category subject to\nthe condition that the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the element of interest,\nmeasured in present value terms, is either written off or provision is made to\nthe extent of the sacrifice involved. For the purpose, the future interest due as\nper the original loan agreement in respect of an account should be discounted\nto the present value at a rate appropriate to the risk category of the borrower\n(i.e. current PLR + the appropriate credit risk premium for the borrower-\ncategory) and compared with the present value of the dues expected to be\nreceived under the restructuring package, discounted on the same basis.\nc) In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value\nterms, as at (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or\nprovision made to the extent of the sacrifice involved.\n6.2 Treatment of sub-standard accounts restructured under CDR:7\na) A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, would render a sub-\nstandard asset eligible to be continued in the sub-standard category for the\nspecified period, provided the loan / credit facility is fully secured.\nb) A rescheduling of interest element would render a sub-standard asset eligible\nto be continued to be classified in sub-standard category for the specified\nperiod subject to the condition that the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the\nelement of interest, measured in present value terms, is either written off or\nprovision is made to the extent of the sacrifice involved. For the purpose, the\nfuture interest due as per the original loan agreement in respect of an account\nshould be discounted to the present value at a rate appropriate to the risk\ncategory of the borrower (i.e., current PLR + the appropriate credit risk\npremium for the borrower-category) and compared with the present value of\nthe dues expected to be received under the restructuring package, discounted\non the same basis.\nc) In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value\nterms, as at (b) above, the  amount of sacrifice should either be written off or\nprovision made to the extent of the sacrifice involved. Even in cases where the\nsacrifice is by way of write off of the past interest dues, the asset should\ncontinue to be treated as sub-standard.\nThe sub-standard accounts at  6.2 (a), (b) and (c)  above, which have been subjected\nto restructuring, etc. whether in respect of principal instalment or interest amount, by\nwhatever modality, would be eligible to be upgraded to the standard category only\nafter the specified period, i.e., a period of one year  after the date when first\npayment of interest or of principal, whichever is earlier, falls due, subject to\nsatisfactory performance during the period. The amount of provision made earlier, net\nof the amount provided for the sacrifice in the interest amount in present value terms\nas aforesaid, could also be reversed after the one-year period.\n6.3  During this one-year period, the sub-standard  asset will not deteriorate in its\nclassification if satisfactory performance of the account is demonstrated during the\nperiod. In case, however, the satisfactory performance during the one year period is\nnot evidenced, the asset classification of the restructured account would be governed\nas per the applicable prudential norms with reference to the pre-restructuring payment\nschedule.\n6.4  The asset classification under CDR would continue to be bank-specific based on\nrecord of recovery of each bank, as per the existing prudential norms applicable to\nbanks.\n7.  Disclosure\nBanks should also disclose in their published Annual Accounts, under the \u201cNotes on\nAccounts\u201d, the following information in respect of CDR undertaken during the year :\n\u2022 Total amount of loan assets subjected to restructuring under CDR.\n\u2022 The amount of standard assets subjected to CDR.\n\u2022 The amount of sub-standard assets subjected to CDR.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/22752.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Aug 20, 2001", "info": "Move towards Risk Based Supervision ( RBS) of banks -\ndiscussion paper\n13th August 2001\nDBS.CO/ RBS/58/36.01.002/2001-02\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(Except Regional Rural Banks)\nDear Sirs,\nMove towards Risk Based Supervision ( RBS) of banks -\ndiscussion paper\nPlease refer to paragraph 76 of our Governor's statement on 'Monetary and Credit Policy for\nthe year 2000-2001' wherein it has been stated that the Reserve Bank would be developing an\noverall plan for moving towards Risk-based Supervision ( RBS) with the assistance of\ninternational consultants.  Accordingly, Pricewaterhouse Coopers ( PwC), a firm of\nconsultants based in London, were engaged to undertake a review of the current regulatory\nand supervisory regime and prepare the blue print for the transition to a more sophisticated\nsystem of RBS incorporating international best practices.  A discussion paper on the 'Move\ntowards Risk-based Supervision of banks' has been prepared summarizing the\nrecommendations of the consultants and is enclosed.\n2.  It may be observed from the discussion paper that the Reserve Bank would focus its\nsupervisory attention on the banks in accordance with the risk each bank poses to itself as\nwell as to the system.  The risk profile of each bank would determine the supervisory\nprogramme comprising off-site surveillance, targeted on-site inspections, structured meetings\nwith banks, commissioned external audits, specific supervisory directions and new policy\nnotices in conjunction with close monitoring through a Monitorable Action Plan (MAP)\nfollowed by enforcement action, as warranted.  The successful implementation of the process\nof RBS entails adequate preparation, both on the part of the  Reserve Bank and the\ncommercial banks.\n3.  The introduction of RBS would require the banks to reorient their organisational set up\ntowards RBS and put in place an efficient risk management architecture, adopt risk focused\ninternal audit, strengthen the management information system, and set up compliance units .\nThe banks would also be required to address HRD issues like manpower planning, selection\nand deployment of staff and their training in risk management and risk based audit.  It is\nevident that change management is a key element in RBS and the banks should have clearly\ndefined standards of corporate governance, well documented policies and efficient practices\nin place so as to clearly demarcate the lines of responsibility and accountability so that they\nalign themselves to meet the requirements of RBS.\n4. The discussion paper may please be placed before the Board of Directors for deliberation\nin the next meeting.  The comments of the bank on the various aspects of the discussion paper\nmay please be forwarded to us as early as possible but before September 30, 2001.On the\nbasis of the feed back received from the banks further discussions would be held.2\n5.  In the meanwhile, kindly acknowledge receipt.\n(A.L.Narasimhan)\nChief General Manager-in-charge\nEncl: Discussion paper on \u201cMove towards Risk Based Supervision of banks\u201d\nReserve Bank of India\nDepartment of Banking Supervision\nCentral Office\nMove towards Risk based Supervision of banks \u2013\na discussion paper\nPart I\nBackground\n1.The international banking scene has in recent years witnessed strong trends towards\nglobalization and consolidation of the financial system.  Stability of the financial system has\nbecome the central challenge to bank regulators and supervisors throughout the world. The\nmulti-lateral initiatives leading to evolution of international standards and codes and\nevaluation of adherence thereto represent resolute attempts to address this challenge.\n2.The Indian banking scene has witnessed progressive deregulation, institution of\nprudential norm and an emulation of international supervisory best practices. The supervisory\nprocesses have also concomitantly evolved and have acquired a certain level of robustness\nand sophistication with the adoption of the CAMELS1/CALCS2 approach to supervisory risk\nassessments and rating.  The tightening of exposure and prudential norms and enhancement\nin disclosure standards in phases over a period of time have more closely aligned the Indian\nbanking system to international best practices. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been\nconstantly endeavouring to enhance the sophistication and efficiency levels of its supervisory\nprocesses.\n3.The  announcement  made  by  the Governor, RBI, as part of the monetary and credit\npolicy statement for 2000-2001 that RBI would be developing an overall plan for moving\ntowards risk-based supervision ( RBS) with the assistance of international consultants\nsignified the launch of a new initiative in this direction.  Pricewaterhouse Coopers ( PWC)\nbased in London, were selected to undertake a review of the current regulatory and\nsupervisory processes of the RBI with a view to assisting in the introduction of risk based\nregulation and supervision in India.  The RBS will be a regime in which RBI's resources will\nbe directed towards the areas of greater risk to its supervisory objectives.  There are two legs\nto implementing effective risk-based processes: first, explicit supervisory objectives must be\nset and secondly, the risks posed to these objectives by the activities of commercial banks\nmust be assessed and addressed.  The current review represents further stage in the overall\ndevelopment of RBI's approach to regulating and supervising banks in the light of the earlier\nPadmanabhan Committee and Narasimham Committee reports.  Based on the work of the\ninternational consultants, RBI intends to move towards a RBS system in stages.3\nCurrent approach\n4.The current supervisory process adopted by the Department of Banking Supervision\n(DBS) is applied uniformly to all supervised institutions.  Though scrutiny of systems and\nprocedures prevailing in supervised institution is an integral part of on-site inspection, there is\nscope for more focus on the risk profile of the institutions.  The current approach is largely\non-site inspection driven supplemented by off-site monitoring and the supervisory follow-up\ncommences with the detailed findings of annual financial inspection. The process is based on\nCAMELS/ CALCS approach where capital adequacy, asset quality, management aspects,\nearnings, liquidity and systems and control are examined keeping in view the requirements of\nSection 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  The on-site inspections are conducted, to a\nlarge extent with reference to the audited balance sheet dates.  The off-site and market\nintelligence play a supplemental role.  While in several external jurisdictions, the supervisory\nprocess extensively leverages on the work done by others, such as the internal and external\nauditors , the use made of these resources in India is rather limited. No legal framework exists\nfor the external auditors to report to the supervisor their adverse findings on issues having\nsupervisory implications.\nRisk-based Supervision - A New approach\n5.Considering the growing diversities and complexities of banking business, the spate\nof product innovation with complex risk phenomena, the contagion effects that a crisis can\nspread and the consequential pressures on supervisory resources, the RBS approach, the\nfoundation of which would be based on the CAMELS based approach, would be more\nappropriate.  By optimizing the synergies from the different activities, including the\nregulatory and supervisory functions, the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the\nsupervisory process can be substantially enhanced.\nObjectives of RBS\n6.The RBS approach essentially entails the allocation of supervisory resources and\npaying supervisory attention in accordance with the risk profile of each institution.   The\napproach is expected to optimize utilisation of supervisory resources and minimize the impact\nof crisis situation in the financial system. The RBS process essentially involves continuous\nmonitoring and evaluation of the risk profiles of the supervised institutions in relation to their\nbusiness strategy and exposures. This assessment will be facilitated by the construction of a\nRisk matrix for each institution.\n7.The instruments of RBS will be by way of enhancement as well as refining of the\nsupervisory tools over those traditionally employed under the CAMELS approach viz. on-site\nexamination and off-site monitoring.  The RBS processes and the outcome will be forward\nlooking beyond focusing attention on the rectification of deficiencies with reference to the\non-site inspection date.  The extent of on-site inspection would be largely determined by the\nquality and reliability of off-site data, and the reliability of the risk profile built up by banks.\nThe effectiveness of the RBS would clearly depend on banks' preparedness in certain critical\nareas, such as quality and reliability of data, soundness of systems and technology,\nappropriateness of risk control mechanism, supporting human resources and organisational\nback-up.4\nSupervision process\nThe major elements of RBS approach are set out below:\nRisk profiling of banks\n8.The central plank for RBS is an accurate risk profiling for each bank.  The risk profile\nwould be a document, which would contain various kinds of financial and non-financial risks\nfaced by a banking institution.  The risk assessment would entail the identification of\nfinancial activities in which a bank has chosen to engage and the determination of the types\nand quantities of risks to which these activities expose the banking institution.  The type of\nrisk that banking institution face individually or in combination include, but are not limited\nto, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risks.  The quantity of risks\nassociated with a given activity may be assessed by the volume of assets and the off-balance\nsheet items that the activity represents or the portion of revenue derived from that activity.\nActivities that are new to an institution or for which exposure is not readily quantifiable may\nalso represent high risk to an institution that would also be evaluated and included in the risk\nprofile document.  The risk profile will also be designed to provide a systematic assessment\nfrom the supervisor's perspective of the adequacy and effectiveness of the bank's\norganisation, management and controls.  The main risk-profiling device at present is the\nCAMELS rating based on on-site inspection, which in course of time will be derived from\noff-site returns and other information.  CAMELS rating would continue to be the core of risk\nprofile compilation, but the successive ratings would be used to reflect trends in contrast to\nbeing used as a static annual indicator of risk.\n9.The risk profile of each bank will draw upon a wide range of sources of information,\nbesides CAMELS rating, such as, off-site surveillance and monitoring ( OSMOS) data,\nmarket intelligence reports, ad-hoc data from external and internal auditors, information from\nother domestic and overseas supervisors, on-site findings, sanctions applied etc.  The data\ninputs would be assessed for its significance and quality before being fed into the risk profile.\nAll outliers i.e. banks which fall outside the normal distribution based on characteristics such\nas profitability, new business activity, balance sheet growth etc. would be identified on the\nbasis of a two-tailed test (i.e. too good or too bad) and investigated on a regular basis. The\nrisk profile would be constantly updated.\n10.The key components of the risk profile document would be the following:\n\u2022 CAMELS rating with trends\n\u2022 Narrative description of key risk features captured under each CAMELS component\n\u2022 Summary of key business risks including volatility of trends in key business risk\nfactors\n\u2022 Monitorable action plan and bank\u2019s progress to date\n\u2022 Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats ( SWOT) analysis\n\u2022 Sensitivity analysis\nRBI would undertake a formal assessment of the risk profile of each bank on a regular basis.\nThe period between assessments would vary depending on the materiality of the risk profile\nof a bank, with an average period of one year.  However, more frequent assessments would\nbe resorted to for higher risk banks and less frequent assessment for lower risk banks.\nSupervisory cycle5\n11.The supervisory process would commence with the preparation of the bank risk\nprofile (based on data furnished by banks to the DBS of RBI, besides data from other\nsources).   The supervision cycle will vary according to risk profile of each bank, the\nprinciple being the higher the risk the shorter will be the cycle.  The supervision cycle will\nremain at 12 months in the short-term and will be extended beyond 12 months for low risk\nbanks at a suitable stage.  In cases where more frequent application of supervisory process\nwill be necessary, the cycle could even be lesser than 12 months.\nSupervisory programme\n12.RBI would prepare a bank specific supervisory programme which will set out the\ndetailed work plan for the bank.  The scope and objectives of the inspection programme will\nderive from analysis of risk profile.  The supervisory programme would be tailored to\nindividual banks and would focus on the highest risk areas as well as specify the need for\nfurther investigation in identified problem areas. The supervisory programme would be\nprepared at the beginning of the supervisory cycle and would yet be flexible enough to permit\namendments warranted by subsequent major developments.  The supervisory programme\nwould also identify the package of supervisory tools to be deployed from a range consisting\nof:\n\u2022 greater off-site surveillance\n\u2022 targeted on-site inspection\n\u2022 structured meetings with banks\n\u2022 commissioned external audits\n\u2022 specific supervisory directions\n\u2022 new policy notices (i.e. new policy directions to banks emanating from individual\nbank level concerns which are relevant for the industry)\nOn-site inspection would be largely targeted to specific areas unless a full scope inspection is\nwarranted as per the bank-specific supervisory progamme.  A monitorable action plan\n(MAP), the details of which are given later, to mitigate risks to supervisory objectives posed\nby individual banks would be drawn up for follow-up. Variable supervisory cycles and\nvariable frequency of inspections would therefore characterise the supervisory process under\nRBS.\nInspection process\n13.The risk assessment of individual banks would be performed in advance of on-site\nsupervisory activities.  The risk assessment process would highlight both the strengths and\nvulnerabilities of an institution and would provide a foundation from which to determine the\nprocedures to be conducted during the inspection.  The current full-scope on-site inspections,\nwhich are carried out annually cover a substantive asset evaluation.  The inspections under\nthe new approach would be largely systems based rather than laying emphasis on underlying\ntransactions and asset valuations.  The inspection would target identified high-risk areas from\nthe supervisory perspective and would focus on the effectiveness of mechanism in capturing,\nmeasuring, monitoring and controlling various risks.  The inspection procedure would\ncontinue to include transaction testing and evaluation the extent of which will depend on the\nmateriality of an activity and the integrity of the risk management system and the control\nprocess.6\nReview, evaluation and follow-up\n14.An evaluation will be undertaken to ensure that the supervisory programme has\nindeed been completed and been effective in improving the risk profile of the bank\nconcerned.  If need be, further tools will be employed including additional inspection visits.\nThe findings of inspection and other supervisory information on records would be used to\nproduce a comprehensive document of supervisory risks and the bank\u2019s assigned ratings for\nfollow-up of supervisory concerns.  The risk profile document of the bank will accordingly\nbe updated in the light of new information. This process will support the issue of the\nsupervisory letter to the bank, which would be discussed with the bank\u2019s management or the\nBoard of Directors.\nMonitorable Action Plan\n15.The aim of supervisory follow-up would be to ensure that banks take corrective action\nin time to remedy or mitigate any significant risks that have been identified during the\nsupervisory process.  The major device in this respect would be the MAP.  MAPs are already\nused by RBI to set out the improvements required in the areas identified during the current\non-site and off-site supervisory process.  However, MAPs would be made more robust in a\nnumber of ways.  MAPs will in many cases include directions to banks on actions to be\ntaken.  The remedial actions that would be outlined, would be tied explicitly to the areas of\nhigh risks identified in the risk profiling as well as the supervisory process and should lead to\nimprovements in the systems and controls environment at the bank.  Key individuals at the\nbank would have to be made accountable for each of the action points.  If actions and\ntimetable set out in the MAP are not met, RBI would consider issuing further directions to the\ndefaulting banks and even impose sanctions and penalties.\nSupervisory organisation\n16.Within the RBI, the regulatory and supervisory structure funct ion separately at present\nmaking it necessary for banks to have more than one contact point with the RBI Regulation\n(DBOD) and Supervision ( DBS) departments for their interaction on supervisory and\nregulatory issues.  As the bank specific issues would be with reference to the broad regulatory\nframework in place, a Central Point of Contact in RBI would be of convenience to banks.\nUnder the RBS, there would be a focal point for all contacts by banks both at the Central\nOffice of RBI and its ROs, in respect of all matters relating to regulatory/supervisory issues.\nThis focal point would be the main conduit for information and communication between the\nbanks and RBI.\nEnforcement process and incentive framework\n17.While the aim of supervisory follow-up is to  ensure that banks take corrective action\nto mitigate significant risks, the persistence of deficiencies would pose a risk to RBI\u2019s\nsupervisory objectives.  A system of incentives and disincentives has been contemplated\nunder the RBS to better serve attainment of these objectives.   Banks with a better compliance\nrecord and a good risk management and control system could be entitled to an incentive\npackage which could be in the form of longer supervisory cycle and lesser supervisory\nintervention.  The banks, which fail to show improvement in response to the MAP, would be\nsubjected to a disincentive package such as, more frequent supervisory examination and\nhigher supervisory intervention including directions, sanctions and penalties.  The mandatory7\nand discretionary actions as enshrined in the Prompt Corrective Action ( PCA) framework\nwould be a part of the supervisory enforcement action.  The enforcement function would be\ncarried out through an independent Enforcement Cell to be set up at the BSD to ensure\nconsistency of treatment, maintain objectivity and neutrality of enforcement action.\nRole of external auditors in banking supervision\n18.The use of specialist third parties, such as, external auditors can be of significant aid\nto the bank supervisors.  In some countries, external auditors are required to perform an early\nwarning function and inform supervisors without delay of information material to the\nsupervisor. The Basel consultative paper \u2018Internal audit in banks and the relationship of the\nsupervisory authorities with internal and external auditors\u2019 discusses the commonality of\nfocus and concern of external auditors and bank supervisors.  The supervisory process instead\nof duplicating the efforts of the external and internal auditors in some areas should seek to\nleverage off the work done by these agencies.  Towards part achievement of this goal, the\nLFAR format, which is currently under revision, will have to be brought into use at the\nearliest.  RBI would look forward to make more use of external auditors as a supervisory tool\nby widening the range of tasks and activities which external auditors perform at present.  RBI\nwould enter into dialogue with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the bank\nmanagement to chalk out an action plan.\nChange management implications\n19.Change management is a key element in ensuring that switchover to RBS takes place\nin an orderly and effective manner. Banks should have clearly defined standards of corporate\ngovernance and documented policies and practices in place so as to clearly demarcate the\nlines of responsibility and accountability.  They will have to address several organisational\nissues to realign themselves to meet the requirements of RBS.  The details of actions that\nneed to be taken by banks are enumerated in Part II.\nPart II\n20.Bank level preparations\n(a)Setting up of risk management architecture\nWith the progressive deregulation of the financial system as also to address systemic\nconcerns on the safety and soundness of the banking system, RBI advised banks in India in\nFebruary 1999 to introduce, effective from April 1, 1999, a scientific system of Asset-\nLiability Management.  RBI also issued in October 1999 comprehensive guidelines for\nputting in place an effective and comprehensive Risk Management System.  The guidelines\nenvisaged that banks would set up proper organizational structure, policies, procedures, limits\nfor credit, market and operational risk management.  Under the ALM guidelines banks were\nexpected to cover 100% of their assets and liabilities by April 1, 2000.  A review undertaken\nby RBI has revealed that most of the banks are yet to cover 100 per cent of their assets and\nliabilities for ALM or set up proper risk management systems and policies for managing\ncredit, market, operational and other risks.8\nAs stated earlier in paragraph 13, supervisory resources would be focused on the areas of\nhigher risks to a bank.  The risk profile would highlight both the strengths and vulnerabilities\nof a bank and would provide a foundation from which to determine the procedures to be\nconducted during an on-site examination.\nUnder a risk-focused on-site examination approach, the degree of transaction testing would\nbe reduced when internal risk management processes are determined to be adequate or risks\nare considered minimal.  When, however, risk management processes or internal controls are\nconsidered inappropriate, additional transaction testing sufficient to fully assess the degree of\nrisk exposure in a function or activity would be performed.   It would be necessary for banks\nto carry out a fresh review of their current status of risk management architecture by an\nexpert team and initiate measures to bridge the gaps.\n(b)Adoption of Risk focused Internal Audit\nInternal Audit is an independent activity designed to improve the bank's operations.\nThe internal audit function is a part of the ongoing monitoring of the system of internal\ncontrol and assists the staff in effective discharge of their responsibilities.  The success of\ninternal audit function depends largely on the extent of reliance the bank management would\nplace in guiding the bank's operations.  The Internal Audit Department will therefore have to\nbe independent from the internal control process and be given an appropriate standing within\nthe bank to carry out its assignments with objectivity and impartiality.  The Internal Audit\nDepartment should therefore be provided with appropriate resources and staff to achieve its\nobjectives.  Historically, the internal audit system in banks has been concentrating on: ( i)\ntransaction testing, accuracy and reliability of accounting records and financial reports, (ii)\ntesting of integrity, reliability and timeliness of control report, and (iii) adherance to legal and\nregulatory requirements.  Though transaction testing would remain a reliable and essential\nexamination aspect of internal auditing, in the changing scenario such testing by itself would\nnot be sufficient.  Over the years, the evolvement of financial instruments and markets have\nenabled banks to reposition their portfolio risk exposure.  It has become clear that periodic\nassessment based on transaction testing alone cannot keep pace with the rapid changes\noccurring in financial risk profiles.  In this context the widening of the scope of internal\nauditing assumes significance.  The internal audit would have to capture in a larger way the\napplication and effectiveness of risk management procedures and risk assessment\nmethodology and critical evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control\nsystems.  The internal audit department should pay special attention to auditing the banking\nactivity in all the places through which the activity is undertaken.  The precise scope of work\nof internal auditing must be determined by each bank but as a minimum, must review and\nreport upon the control environment as a whole, the process by which risks are identified,\nanalysed  and managed, the line of controls over key processes, the reliability and integrity of\ncorporate management function, safeguarding of assets and compliance with rules and\nregulations.\nTo achieve these objectives, banks would have to gradually move towards risk focused\nauditing, in addition to the system of selective transaction based auditing.  The\nimplementation of risk based auditing would mean that greater emphasis is placed on the\ninternal auditor's role of mitigating risks.  By focussing on effective risk management the\ninternal auditor would not only offer remedies for current trouble areas but also anticipate\nproblems and play an important role in protecting the bank from risk hazards.  The risk based\nauditing would not only cover assessment of risks at the branch level but would also cover, as9\nan independent assessing authority, assessment of risks at the corporate level and the overall\nprocess in place to identify, measure, monitor and control the risks.  In order to focus\nattention on areas of greater risk to the bank, a location-wise and activity-wise risk\nassessment should be performed in advance of on-site risk based auditing.  This would allow\nidentification of high risk areas which would enable prioritising the activities and locations\nfor risk based audit.  If initial inquiries into the risk management system raise material doubt\nas to the system's effectiveness, no significant reliance should be placed on the system and a\nmore extensive series of tests need to be undertaken to ensure that the bank's exposure to risk\nfrom a given function or activity is accurately captured and monitored.  The high-risk areas\nneed to be looked into more frequently than the low risk areas.\nRisk based audit would be an aid to the ongoing risk management by banks, as it would\nprovide checks and balances in the system.  The banks could form a small Committee of\nexecutives and entrust them with the responsibility to chalk out an action plan, implement\nand monitor the progress in adoption of risk management systems and risk focused audit and\nreport to the Top Management and Board of Directors periodically.\n(c) Strengthening of Management Information System\nand Information Technology\nA principal foundation for RBS is the availability of detailed data.  Under RBS the\nmonitoring needs of RBI will differ based on the risk profile of a bank and accordingly RBI\nmay require banks to provide information in addition to the data now being furnished in the\nOSMOS returns.  Consequently, there is a need to devise a policy for backup and storage of\nvarious databases on regular intervals.  The policy should specify details like frequency of\nbackups, media to be used, off-site storage areas, departments and officials (Data Managers)\nresponsible for these actions.  The accuracy, completeness and the timeliness of data are very\nimportant and would have to be ensured by banks through up-gradation of their management\ninformation and information technology systems.  The Data Manager's role should be created\nin order to ensure that the data has integrity, is stored in correct place, comprehensive and\ntimely.  The Data Managers should be made responsible for specific databases.  Banks should\nreview the present status of the management information and information technology systems\nand initiate necessary measures to ensure that RBI data needs as well as supervisory reporting\nsystems are streamlined.\n(d)Addressing HRD issues\nA major transitional task towards completion of risk management set up and\nintroduction of risk based audit will be the reorientation of the staff to meet the required\nobjectives.  The potential primary obstacles will be the skill formation of the staff and\nplacement in appropriate positions.  Banks may have to create a dedicated risk management\nteam at head office and reorient the Internal Audit Department to undertake risk-based audit.\nThese objectives could be attained through addressing several HRD issues like manpower\nplanning, selection and deployment of staff and extensive training in risk management\nincluding asset liability management and risk based audit.  The banks will have to adopt a\nforward looking training arrangement through appropriate course designing and compilation\nof training materials keeping in view the best international practices and procedures.\n(e)Setting up of Compliance Unit10\nBanks are required to take corrective action to remedy or mitigate any significant\nrisks which have been identified in the earlier part of the supervisory cycle and which have\nbeen incorporated into the current risk profile.  RBI will issue bank specific MAP which will\ninclude directions to banks on actions to be taken.  If the actions and timetable set out in the\nMAP fail to be met, RBI may issue further directions or impose sanctions or take mandatory\nand discretionary actions, if deficiencies continue to persist.  It is therefore necessary for\nbanks to set up a dedicated compliance unit to coordinate various actions of the bank for\ncompliance and for periodical reporting to RBI, and ensure the completion of compliance\naction within the time period indicated in the MAP.  The compliance unit should be headed\nby a Chief Compliance Officer of the rank of not less than a General Manager who will be\nresponsible and accountable for timeliness and accuracy of the compliance.\nPart III\nImplementation Schedule\n21.The major transitional task would be the reorientation of organizational se t up by\nbanks in line with the recommendations for bank level preparation.  The main obstacle during\nthe transitional period would be skill formation, attitudinal changes, development and\nretention of specialist staff, extensive training and redeployment of staff.  It is not\ncontemplated to change over to RBS approach in one go.  It will be implemented in a gradual\nmanner.  However, the shift to RBS approach would not necessarily await the completion of\nbank level preparation.  The concept is intended to be rolled out at the earliest, as the\ninadequacies in risk management systems in banks will themselves be a supervisory risk.  As\nthe CAMELS rating would be an important input in bank risk profiling, the CAMELS\napproach through on-site inspection would concurrently be followed along with the RBS\napproach in the shorter term.  The procedure would be reviewed at the appropriate time in the\nlight of the quality of Management Information System in banks and the accuracy and\ncompleteness of relevant off-site data furnished to the BSD of RBI which would then form\nthe basis for compilation of CAMELS rating.  At that stage, the on-site inspection for\nCAMELS rating would be by way of exception.\n22.It is intended to roll out the RBS process in phases beginning from the last quarter of\nthe financial year 2002-2003.  It is, therefore, necessary for banks to initiate immediate\nmeasures for completion of the tasks indicated in paragraph 21 of this document by the end of\nthe calendar year 2002.  Banks may like to set up an in-house change management team to\nmonitor the progress of implementation and suggest ways and means to overcome the\nobstacles.\n1.

To enable banks to have current instructions at one place, a Master Circular\nincorporating all the existing guidelines/instructions/directives on the scheme has been\nprepared and is appended. We advise that this Master Circular consolidates all the\nprevious instructions issued by RBI up to 30th June 2001, which are listed in the\nAppendix.\nPlease acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(A.V.Sardesai)\nChief General Manager-in-charge\nRural Planning and Credit Department\nCentral Office\nReserve Bank of India\nMumbai\nSWARNJAYANTI GRAM SWAROZGAR YOJANA ( SGSY)\nThe Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India have launched a new\nprogramme known as 'Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana' ( SGSY)  by\nrestructuring the following existing schemes:\n1. Integrated Rural Development Programme ( IRDP)\n2. Training of Rural Youth for Self Employment ( TRYSEM)\n3. Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas ( DWCRA)\n4. Supply of Improved Toolkits to Rural Artisans ( SITRA)\n5. Ganga Kalyan Yojana ( GKY)6. Million Wells Scheme ( MWS)\nDetailed \u2018Guidelines\u2019 have been circulated to all DRDAs /Banks by the Ministry of Rural\nDevelopment.\n1. The Scheme\nThe SGSY Scheme is operative from 1st April, 1999  in rural areas  of the country.\nSGSY is a holistic Scheme covering all aspects of self employment such as\norganisation of the poor into Self Help Groups, training, credit, technology,\ninfrastructure and marketing. The scheme will be funded by the Centre and the States in\nthe ratio of 75:25 and will be implemented by Commercial Banks, Regional Rural\nBanks and Co-operative Banks. Other financial institutions, Panchayat Raj Institutions,\nDistrict Rural Development Agencies ( DRDAs), Non-Government Organisations\n(NGOs), Technical institutions in the district, will be involved in the process of\nplanning, implementation and monitoring of the scheme. NGO's help may be sought in\nthe formation and nurturing of the Self Help Groups ( SHGs) as well as in the\nmonitoring of the progress of the Swarozgaris. Where feasible their services may be\nutilised in the provision of technology support, quality control of the products and as\nrecovery monitors cum facilitators.\nThe Scheme aims at establishing a large number of micro enterprises in the rural areas.\nThe list of Below Poverty Line ( BPL) households identified through BPL census duly\napproved by Gram Sabha will form the basis for identification of families for assistance\nunder SGSY.\nThe objective of SGSY is to bring every assisted family above the poverty line within\nthree years by providing them income-generating assets through a mix of bank credit and\nGovernment subsidy. The rural poor such as those with land, landless labour, educated\nunemployed, rural artisans and disabled are covered under the scheme.\nThe assisted families known as Swarozgaris can be either individuals or groups and\nwould be selected from BPL families by a three member team consisting of Block\nDevelopment Officer, Banker and Sarpanch.\nSGSY will focus on vulnerable sections of the rural poor. Accordingly the SC/ST will\naccount for at  least 50 percent, Women 40 percent, and the disabled 3 percent of those\nassisted.\n2. Skill Upgradation\nOnce the person or group of persons has been identified for assistance, their training need\nalso is to be ascertained with reference to Minimum Skill Requirement ( MSR). The\nassessment regarding technical skills would be made by line departments and that of\nmanagerial skills by the banker, while scrutinising the loan applications. Swarozgaris\npossessing skills will be put through basic orientation programme which is mandatory.\nThis programme includes elements of Book Keeping, knowledge of market, identification\nand appraisal, acquaintance with product costing, product pricing, familiarisation with\nproject financing by banks as well as basic skills in the key activity identified. It will befor a short duration of not more than 2 days. BDOs, Bankers and line departments will act\nas resource persons for imparting the training. The training expenditure will be met by\nDRDAs.\nFor those beneficiaries who need additional skill development/ upgradation of skills,\nappropriate training would be organised through Government institutions, ITIs,\npolytechnics, Universities, NGOs etc. Swarozgaris will be eligible for loans under SGSY\nwhen they possess Minimum Skill Requirement, and it will be disbursed only when they\nhave satisfactorily completed the skill training.\nFor this training, Swarozgaris will be entitled for financial assistance if they are required\nto undergo training for more than a week. The rate of assistance would be fixed locally.\nThe bank will provide loans to the Swarozgaris for this purpose. However, as the credit\nhas to be extended before the project is taken up, notwithstanding the general security\nnorms for lending under the scheme, banks may extend loans for skill development\ntraining with or without collateral/third party guarantee at their discretion.\n3. Activity Clusters, Key Activities\nMajor share of assistance upto 75 percent (both by number and funding) will be for key\nactivities and they should be taken up in clusters. For this, 4-5 key activities will be\nidentified for each block with the approval of Panchayat Samithis at block level and\nDRDA/ ZP at the District level. One or two activities in each block would be identified\nduring 1999-2000 so that implementation can be started straight away. On farm activities\nto be assisted would include minor irrigation such as open dug well/bore/tube well/lift\nirrigation/check dam etc. Non farm activities will include those activities that result in the\nproduction of goods/services that have ready market. The unit cost as fixed by the\nregional Committees of NABARD should be taken into consideration as indicative\ncost while fixing the unit cost for the farm sector. In regard to loans falling under\nISB Sector, the responsibility of fixing the unit cost and other techno-economic\nparameters is of the District SGSY Committee . The selection of activities should be\nsuch that it would afford the Swarozgari an opportunity to expand his asset and skill base\nin three years and at least in the third year the net income would be not less than Rs.\n2,000/- p.m.\n4. Self-Help Groups ( SHGs)\nThe Self Help Groups shall be organised by Swarozgaris drawn from the BPL list approved\nby Gram Sabha. The Scheme provides for formation of Self Help Groups ( SHGs),\nnurturing and their linkages with banks.\nGroup activities will be given preference and progressively majority of the funding will\nbe for Self Help Groups. Half the groups formed at block level should be exclusively\nwomen groups.\nSHG under SGSY may consist of 10 to 20 persons belonging to BPL families. In case of\nminor irrigation and in the case of disabled persons this number may be a minimum of 5\npersons. The group shall not comprise more than one member of the same family. A\nperson should not be a member of more than one group. SHG may be an informal groupor registered under Societies Act, State Co-operative Act or as a partnership firm. The\nassistance (loan cum subsidy) may be extended to individuals in a group or to all\nmembers in the group for taking up income generation activities.\nIn States and Union Territories where the formation of SHGs has not taken root, banks\nmay continue to extend credit facilities to eligible individual Swarozgaris.\n5. Revolving Fund\nEvery SHG that is in existence at least for a period of six months and which has\ndemonstrated the potential of a viable group will receive a revolving fund of Rs.25 ,000/-\nfrom banks as cash credit facility. Of this a sum of Rs.10 ,000/- will be given to the bank\nby the DRDA. Banks may charge interest only on the sum exceeding Rs. 10,000/- .\nThe revolving fund is provided to the groups to augment the group corpus so as to enable\nlarger number of members to avail loans and also to facilitate increase in the per capita\nloan available to the members. The revolving fund imparts credit discipline and financial\nmanagement skills to the members so that they become credit worthy. SHGs that have\ndemonstrated their successful existence, will receive   assistance for economic activities\nunder the scheme.\n6. Lending Norms\nThe size of loan under the scheme would depend on the nature of project. There is no\ninvestment ceiling  other than the unit cost i.e. investment requirement worked out for the\nproject. The loans under the scheme would be composite loan comprising of Term Loan\nand working capital. The loan component and the admissible subsidy together would be\nequal to total project cost. Banks may follow model project report set out in key activities\nof the districts for finalising the project cost of the Swarozgaris. Under any\ncircumstance under financing is to be avoided . Swarozgaris will be given the full\namount of loan and subsidy and they will have the freedom to procure the assets\nthemselves. Disbursements up to Rs.10 ,000/- under ISB sector may be made in cash\nwhere a number of items are to be bought.\nEmphasis is laid on multiple dose of assistance . This would mean assisting a Swarozgari\nover a period of time with second and subsequent dose(s) of credit enabling him/her to\ncross the poverty line as also access higher amounts of credit. Subsidy entitlement for all\ndoses taken together should not exceed the limit prescribed for that category. The second\nand subsequent doses may be granted by the same bank or any other bank during the\ncurrency of first/earlier loan provided the bank is satisfied about the financial discipline\nof the first/earlier dose.\nLoans under the Scheme will carry interest as per the directives on interest rates\nissued by Reserve Bank of India from time to time .\nAll loans granted under the scheme are to be treated as advances under priority sector.\nLoan applications should be disposed of within 15 days and at any rate not later than one\nmonth.Branch Managers may be vested with adequate discretionary powers to sanction\nproposals under the scheme without reference to any higher authority.\n7. Assistance to IRDP borrowers\nThe existing IRDP borrowers may also be considered for second/multiple dose of\nassistance under SGSY if they have failed to cross the poverty line because of no fault of\ntheirs.\nBanks may also extend credit under SGSY to non-wilful defaulter  owing dues up to Rs.\n5,000/- under IRDP. Subsidy available to the existing IRDP beneficiaries would be\nrestricted to the maximum ceiling prescribed for the category less the amount already\navailed by the borrower under IRDP.\n8. Insurance Cover\nInsurance cover is available for assets/live stock bought out of the loan. Swarozgaris are\ncovered under the Group Insurance Scheme as per the details given at paragraphs 4.35 &\n4.36 of the SGSY guidelines.\n9. Security Norms\nFor individual loans up to Rs. 50,000/- and group loans up to Rs. 3 lakhs, the assets\ncreated out of bank loan would be hypothecated to the bank as primary security. In cases\nwhere movable assets are not created as in land based activities such as dug well, minor\nirrigation etc., mortgage of land may be obtained. Where mortgage of land is not possible\nthird party guarantee may be obtained at the discretion of the bank.\nFor all individual loans exceeding Rs. 50,000/- and group loans exceeding Rs. 3 lakhs  in\naddition to primary security such as hypothecation/mortgage of land or third party\nguarantee as the case may be, suitable margin money/other collateral security in the form\nof insurance policy, marketable security/deeds of other property etc. may be obtained at\nthe discretion of the bank.\n10. Subsidy\nSubsidy under SGSY will be uniform at 30 percent of the project cost, subject to a\nmaximum of Rs. 7,500/-. In respect of SC/STs it will be 50 percent of the project cost\nsubject to a maximum of Rs. 10,000/-. For groups of Swarozgaris ( SHGs) the subsidy\nwould be at 50 percent of the cost of the project, subject to a ceiling of Rs. 1.25 lakhs.\nThere will be no monetary limit on subsidy for irrigation projects. Subsidy under SGSY\nwill be back ended. The availability of the benefit of subsidy to swarozgaris would be\ncontingent on the proper utilisation of loan as also its prompt repayment and maintaining\nthe asset in good condition. The procedure for operation of Subsidy Reserve Fund\naccounts as detailed in paragraph 4.17 of the SGSY guidelines may please be followed.\nDRDAs will be opening savings banks accounts with the principal participating bank\nbranches for administration of subsidy. These accounts are to be reconciled every three\nmonths and they will be subject to annual audit.\n11. Post Credit Follow-upLoan Pass books in regional languages may be issued to the Swarozgaris  which may\ncontain all the details of the loans disbursed to them.\nBank branches may observe one day in a week as non public business working day to\nenable the staff to go to the field and attend to the problems of Swarozgaris.\nBanks should ensure through proper monitoring and verification that quality assets have\nbeen procured by the Swarozgaris. Necessary documents relating to acquisition of assets\nshould be obtained by the bank and also followed through visits by field staff. In case of\nnon-procurement of assets by the Swarozgari in spite of reasonable time and opportunity,\nthe bank shall be free to cancel the loan and recover the money. Legal proceedings\n(Civil/Criminal) wherever necessary may be initiated against the Swarozgari and against\nall members in case of SHG for recovery of loan.\n12. Risk Fund for Consumption Credit\nThe scheme provides for the creation of Risk Fund with 1 percent of SGSY funds at\nDistrict level. Consumption loans not exceeding Rs. 2000/- per swarozgari  would be\nprovided by the banks. Assistance to the extent of 10 percent of the total consumption\nloans disbursed by banks to the SGSY swarozgaris during the year would be provided out\nof this Risk Fund.\n13. Repayment of Loan\nAll SGSY loans are to be treated as medium term loans with minimum repayment period\nof five years. Instalments for repayment of loan will be fixed as per the unit cost\napproved by the NABARD/ Dist. SGSY Committee. There will be a moratorium on\nrepayment of loans during the gestation period. Repayment instalments should not be\nmore than 50 percent of the incremental net income expected from the project. Number\nof instalments may be fixed taking into consideration the principal amount, the interest\nliability and the repayment period.\nSwarozgaris will not be entitled for any benefit of subsidy if the loan is fully repaid\nbefore the prescribed lock-in period. The repayment period for various activities under\nSGSY can broadly be categorised into 5, 7 and 9 years depending on the project. The\ncorresponding lock-in period would be 3, 4 and 5 years respectively. If the loan is fully\nrepaid before the currency period, the Swarozgaris will be entitled only to pro-rata\nsubsidy.\n14. Recovery\nPrompt recovery of loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks\nshall take all possible measures, i.e., personal contact, organisation of joint recovery\ncamps with District Administration, legal action, etc to ensure recovery. In case, even\nafter this, the banks fail to recover the entire dues, the process of forfeiture of subsidy for\nadjustment against dues may be taken up. After getting the approval of the District SGSY\ncommittee the concerned bank may adjust the subsidy against the Swarozgari's dues. If\nthe bank is able to realise any amount subsequently over and above the amount due to it,\nthe amount may be returned to the DRDA.The banks may engage the services of NGOs or individuals (other than government\nservants) as monitor-cum-recovery facilitators, on a commission basis. A processing-\ncum-monitoring fee of 0.5 percent of the loan amount may be charged to the Swarozgaris\nto meet this expenditure. Prompt repayment at the Swarozgari's level , will entitle\nhim/her to waiver of the 0.5 percent processing-cum-monitoring fee .\nKeeping in view the importance of loan recovery, banks should prepare the list of\ndefaulters under IRDP before the end of September 1999  and furnish the same to\nGram Sabha/ BDO/ DRDA and initiate recovery efforts.\n15. Refinance of SGSY Loans\nBanks are eligible for refinance from NABARD for the loans disbursed under SGSY as\nper their guidelines. The eligibility for refinance is related to the recovery position of the\nbanks.\n16. Role of Banks and State Agencies\nBanks will be closely involved with Government agencies in implementing, planning and\npreparation of projects, identification of key activities, clusters, self-help groups,\nidentification of individual swarozgaris  infrastructure planning as well as capacity\nbuilding and choice of activity of the SHGs , grading of SHGs , selection of Swarozgaris ,\npre-credit activities and post credit monitoring including loan recovery. The bank has\nthe final say in the selection of Swarozgaris .\n17. Deputation of Bank Officials to the DRDAs\nAs a measure of strengthening of DRDAs and for promoting a better credit environment,\ndeputation of bank officials to DRDAs has been suggested. Banks may consider deputing\nofficers at various levels to the state Governments/ DRDAs in consultation with them.\n18. Supervision and Monitoring\nBanks may set up SGSY cells at Regional/ Zonal Offices. These cells should periodically\nmonitor and review the flow of credit to SGSY Swarozgaris, ensure the implementation\nof the guidelines of the scheme, collect data from the branches and make available\nconsolidated data to the Head Office of the bank. The banks should ensure that no query\nfrom the field level remains unattended by the Head Office. Monitoring of the Scheme at\nthe Head Office level of the bank may be entrusted to a Senior Officer and the progress\nof this programme may be reviewed on a regular basis by the Top Management.\nThe Scheme provides for the setting up of SGSY committees at Block/ District/State and\nCentral level. These committees will hold periodical meetings wherein the\nimplementation of the scheme will be reviewed and monitored. It is expected that banks\nwill actively participate in these meetings and maintain closer co-ordination with the\ndifferent agencies responsible for the implementation of SGSY.\n19. Service Area ApproachThe district SGSY Committee set up under the Scheme has been authorised to reallocate\nthe villages, which are either not covered by any bank branch or where the concerned\nbranch is not able to perform for any reason whatsoever. The district SGSY Committee's\ndecision on reallocation would be placed before DCC for its consideration and further\nnecessary action.\n20. Submission of Data\nClose monitoring at all levels would contribute greatly to the effective implementation of\nthe Scheme. Formats for reporting progress under SGSY as received from Ministry of\nRural Development are given in Annexure 1(2) to 1(7) . The information has to be\ncompiled bank-wise at the block as well as district level to the corresponding\nblock/district authority by the concerned bank and also to be used for the State-level\ninformation by substituting district for the block for monitoring and implementation of\nthe scheme.\nQuarterly progress reports under the scheme may be furnished to RBI/Ministry of Rural\nDevelopment, Government of India, New Delhi as per the proforma enclosed for\nmonitoring the State wise/bank wise progress in the implementation of the scheme. The\nfirst such report to be submitted for the year ended 31st March 2000.\nThe recovery statement under the scheme may be submitted as per format enclosed on a\nhalf yearly basis at the end of March/September every year within 45 days from the close\nof half year to which it relates. The  data relating to SC/ST segment may be furnished\nseparately in the annual statements as at end of march.\nBanks may include the scheme details and concepts as course contents in the training\nprogrammes for staff members and hold sensitisation programmes on SGSY  wherever\nnecessary to further strengthen the scheme.\nThe review of the progress under SGSY  scheme may be made by the banks at\nRegional/ Zonal /Head Office on a quarterly basis. A copy of the review note duly\napproved by the Board may be forwarded to the Ministry of Rural Development, New\nDelhi and Rural Planning & Credit Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office,\nMumbai .\n21. Annual Credit Plan 1999-2000\nAllocation made in the credit plan for IRDP are to be carried over to the SGSY scheme.\nAll loans disbursed under IRDP since April 1999 are to be treated as disbursed SGSY.\nIn case of loans partly disbursed under IRDP, they are to be treated as committed liability\nunder SGSY and the balance loan has to be disbursed under SGSY.\nIn respect of loans sanctioned under IRDP but not disbursed, the cases have to be\nreviewed to see if they fit into the basic criteria that it would lead to the assisted family\ncoming above the poverty line. If so, the loan can be disbursed.In so far as pending proposals under IRDP are concerned, they have to be reviewed with\nreference to key activities selected in the block. If the pending applications fit into\nparameters of these key activities, the loans can be sanctioned under SGSY.\n22. Credit Mobilisation Targets\nThe State-wise credit mobilisation targets are fixed by GOI every year. The State-wise\ntargets may be allocated among commercial banks, co-operative banks and RRBs  by\nSLBCs. The SLBCs should finalise the targets of individual banks on the basis of\nacceptable parameters like resources, number of rural/ semi-urban branches, etc., so that\neach bank will be in a position to arrive at its corporate target, the achievement of which\nwill be strictly monitored by RBI. Every effort should be taken by the banks to achieve\nthe credit target fixed on the above basis.\n23. LBR Returns\nThe Code No. for SGSY under LBR reporting system has been allotted and communicated\nto the banks. ( Vide circular SAA 8/08.01.04/1999-2000 dt.20th January 2000).\nSeparate guidelines have been issued by the Ministry of Rural Development indicating\nthe role and responsibilities of the line departments, banks, NGOs , Swarozgaris. Banks\nshould issue suitable instructions to their controlling offices/branches for implementation.\n24. Clarifications\nIn regard to the above, some issues have been raised by banks in the operationalisation of\nthe scheme. These issues together with clarifications are given in Annexure 1(1) .\nOperational issues which may arise during the course of implementation of the scheme\nmay be resolved locally in the Block/ District/State Level Committees in consultation\nwith officials of line departments keeping overall content of the scheme in view to ensure\nthat the smooth implementation of the scheme is not impeded.\nAnnexure 1(1)\nSwarnjayanti Swarozgar Yojana ( SGSY) - Clarifications\nNo. Matter Referred Clarifications\nScheme\n1. State Governments have been informed\nthat from 1.4.1999 only the BPL census\nlist that has been undertaken in IX Plan\n(1999-2000 to 2003-2004) will be the valid\nlist.\nAverage size of family that can be taken\ninto account for calculating the income\nlevel to identify BPL families.Ministry of Rural Development has\nconfirmed that the IXth Plan BPL list is\navailable with Local Authorities. The list\nwill be made available to all the banks.\nBPL list is the basis for consideration for\nassistance.\n2. Formalities for formation of SHG & for The SHG formation should take requiredNo. Matter Referred Clarifications\nlending to SHG would require minimum\none year whereas individuals may be\nassisted immediately. Due to delays for\nSHG lending, individual lending is\npreferred by Swarozgaris. Relaxation may\nbe granted for SHG, financing during\n1999-2000.time and should not be driven by any\ntargets. Process approach for formation of\ngroups should be followed as detailed in\nthe guidelines. Existing DWCRA groups\nmay be considered for financing in key\nactivities, if they possess characteristics of\na good SHG. As a relaxation during 1999-\n2000, more number of individual\nSwarozgaris may be financed under SGSY.\n3. The stipulation on category wise\nreservations (40% for Women, 50% for\nSC/ST, 3% for disabled) should be relaxed\nand flexibility offered.Achievement of sub-targets may be\nensured by Banks at District level.\nFlexibility is not possible as the focus of\nthe scheme will be particularly on\nvulnerable groups\nSkill Upgradation\n1. Financial assistance to undergo skill\ndevelopment training conducted for more\nthan a week.\n(a) Maximum ceiling limit/mode/p eriod\nof repayment.Quantum of assistance for skill\ndevelopment training would be dependent\non the nature of skill development, the\ninstitution facility available in the locality\nand the period of training. It would also\ndepend on the nature of the activity and the\nSwarozgari. It would not be possible to\nprescribe any period of training.  The  cost\nwould  vary accordingly.\nThese issues may be decided at the\nDistrict- SGSY Committee level. As the\nborrower has to undertake an activity and\nstart repaying the skill development loan\nalong with activity specific loan. The\nrepayment period may run concurrently.\nMode of payment is left to the individual\njudgement of the lending bank.\n(b) Inclusion of the cost of training as\npart of the project and release the loan\nfor training as 1st instalment so that\nwe can minimise the documentation\nformalities, (only one account insteadSeparate documentation would be\nnecessary, as the project cost would be\ndisbursed separately after the training.No. Matter Referred Clarifications\nof two separate accounts)\nii) Who will fix the quantum of\nassistance locally?By and large, the scale of assistance is\nfixed by the District SGSY committee.\nMinor variations, if any, can always be\ndecided by the banks in consultation with\nthe line department officials or the DRDA\nofficials.\niii) Whether loan is to be given to the\nindividual swarozgari or to the group?Loan can be given either to the group or to\nthe Individual Swarozgari.\nActivity Clusters, Key activities\n1. Block SGSY Committee should compile\nand update the data on village profile.\nChoice between spread and cluster based\nefficiency should be left to Block SGSY\nCommittee.Key activities to be pursued by the\nSwarozgaris will be on the basis of village\nprofiles/ P.L.P./ S.A.A./Credit Plans. Block\nSGSY Committee will have the say in the\nselection of Key activities and spread/\nclusters.\nSelf Help Groups\n1. Modalities to ensure sub targets for SC/ST,\nWomen and Physically handicapped in the\ncase of group loan.Sub targets may be monitored by the banks\nat the District level to achieve required\ntargets.\n2.

Whether the member of a family can\nbecome member of different group and\navail loan?Yes. The subsidy is given to the group and\nnot to the individuals.\n5. If Bank advance is granted to any\nindividual member, then how the loan\naccounts will be maintained in Bank\nBooks? Such loans to individuals would\nnot conform to group approach.The loan is either to an individual in a\ngroup or to a group and the books will be\nmaintained accordingly. The loan may be\ngiven to the members and routed through\nSHG and recovery may be made though\nSHG.\n6. Whether a group with less than ten\nmembers can be considered?Minimum of ten members must be\nmaintained in a group other than those forNo. Matter Referred Clarifications\ndisabled and minor irrigation activities.\n7. Existing SHGs (including BPL and non-\nBPL families) offer ready scope for\ncoverage under SGSY?BPL members of a mixed group can avail\nloans in individual capacity. Mixed groups\nare not entitled to group subsidy. However,\nan exception has been made for DWCRA\ngroups for this year only.\n8. Appropriate Grading criteria should be\nestablished for newly formed groups. The\nprocedure for assessing and selecting the\nagencies to do the grading, training etc.\nhave not been elaborated in the new SGSY\nguidelines.DCC/ SLBC can decide the grading based\non NABARD rating norms. No external\nagency is required unless DCC/ SLBC\ndecide otherwise.\nRevolving Fund\n1. (a) Whether the cash credit will be of\npermanent nature or can be recovered\non reducing balance over five years\nand terms of the loan.The revolving fund - (cash credit facility)\nmay be necessary on a permanent basis\nand may co-exist with the SHG.\n(b) When the account has to be brought\ninto credit balance adjusted.Cash Credit account should be monitored\ncontinuously and renewed periodically\ndepending on the necessity.\n(c) Rs. 10,000/- paid by DRDA has to be\nrepaid or not or treated as grant?Rs. 10,000/- from DRDA may be treated\nas subsidy grant in so far as the bank is\nconcerned. As far as group is concerned, it\nis a cash credit and has therefore to be\nrepaid. Only, interest is not charged on\noutstanding upto Rs. 10,000/-).\n(d) Method of liquidation of CC A/c. It would be liquidated like any other cash\ncredit. The liability of the group is for the\nentire amount of cash credit outstanding.No. Matter Referred Clarifications\n2. (a) Mode of sanction and recovery  under\nrevolving fund is to be clarified.\nWhether it would be Rs. 25,000/- for\nall groups and linked to thrift ratio or\nnumber of members.Revolving fund is not linked to the savings\nbut is given only to those groups that have\npassed the first round of grading.\nRevolving fund would be Rs. 25,000/- for\nall groups irrespective of number of\nmembers and may be opened in the name\nof SHG. The operation of the account may\nbe decided by a resolution of the group.\nThe account will be in the form of cash\ncredit. Interest will be charged on credit\navailed in excess of Rs. 10,000/-. Bankers\nmay decide the quantum of cash credit\nlimit within the overall limit of Rs.\n25,000/- ( Rs. 10,000/- + Rs. 15,000/-). The\ncash credit account ( RF) may continue\n till the SHG is in operation and the fund is\noperated to the satisfaction of the lending\nbanker.\n(b) Whether the operative limit or RF\nA/c. is to be reduced to Rs. 15,000/-The operative limit will remain at Rs.\n25,000/-\n(c) Whether the banks have to take\ndocuments for Rs. 25,000/- or Rs.\n15,000/-.Banks will have to take documents for Rs.\n25,000/-.\n3. (a) How is the DRDA subsidy of Rs.\n10,000/- to be treated? Should it be\ncredited to the cash credit account\nstraight away or to be kept in a\nseparate non-interest bearing account\nas deposit?It is a subsidy for Revolving Fund of the\ngroup and therefore may be kept in subsidy\nReserve Fund A/c. in the name of SHG.\nThis would, therefore, not attract\nCRR/ SLR requirement. No interest should\nbe charged on the Rs. 10,000/- credited to\nthe subsidy reserve fund i.e. the SHG\nwould be required to pay interest on bank\ncredit portion only.\n(b) The loan or subsidy does not bear any\nrelation to the number of members in\nthe group which may vary from 5 to\n20 in a SHG. Groups with smaller\nmembership will get more per capita\nrevolving fund.The loan amount would depend on the\nproject undertaken by the group. The\nRevolving Fund and Subsidy limits are for\na group and variation in per capita\nrevolving fund/subsidy will therefore exist.\n(c) Revo lving fund loan/subsidy does not\nbear a relation to the group savings.\nGroup savings indicate the capacity of\nthe group to rotate the funds amongRevolving fund and subsidy are two\nsupports available for SHGs under SGSY\nand their entitlement are not linked to\nsavings.No. Matter Referred Clarifications\nthemselves.\n(d) Security and interest norms for\nRevolving fund.For Revolving Fund, simple letter of\nundertaking from Group members would\nbe sufficient in addition to inter-se\nagreement and usual documentation.

In such\ncases, borrowers may be allowed to go\nbeyond the Service Area. SGSY\nCommittees at Block/District may decide\nsuch cases.\n2. An individual who has availed a non minor\nirrigation loan is willing to avail a loan for\nminor irrigation. Eligible quantum of\nsubsidy may be specified.A SGSY borrower under non minor\nirrigation will not be eligible for assistance\nand subsidy entitlement under minor\nirrigation loan.\n3. Who is responsible authority for\npreparation of project profile and who will\ndecide the reality of the profiles, technical\nfeasibility, economic viability etc. for each\nblock and who is the authority for\napproval?The Block SGSY Committee is required to\nprepare project profiles of 8-10 key\nactivities. For this, the potential linked\nplans of NABARD, village credit profile\nof SAA may be relied on. These project\nprofiles along with recommendations of\nPanchayat Samiti should be forwarded to\nDistrict SGSY Committee which will\nscrutinise the proposals and approve them.\n4. Whether the stamp duty on Hypothecation\nagreement, general form of Guarantee and\nIrrevocable Power of Attorney is waived or\nnot? If not, the quantum of stamp duty toThe waiver of stamp duty on various\ndocuments to be executed by individual/\ngroup loanees rests with the State\nGovernments.No. Matter Referred Clarifications\nbe levied for each document?\n5.

SGSY\nCommittee in order to ensure\nnecessary safeguards for this\npurpose?Banks may disburse all loans for\nagricultural purposes in cash and this will\nbe applicable in all Blocks/Districts.\n7. Emphasis is laid on multiple doses of\nassistance. Whether the credit can be given\nto more than one activity? Whether\nsubsequent doses of credit can be provided\nto the same activity or to different activity?More than one activity can be assisted.\nHowever, the activity should be within the\nkey activities identified.\n8. In case of financing through SHG, the\nsavings mobilised by SHG may be taken as\nmargin. A stipulation of bringing in a\nmargin of 25% by way of group savings\nwill reduce the future debt service burden\nof the beneficiaries.Savings of the group need not be linked to\nthe loan under SGSY as the target group is\nfrom the BPL list. Loan is given to a SHG.\nonly if the grading is satisfactory ( para 3.1\nof the guidelines). As per the guidelines\nfull project cost has to be financed.\n9. It is stated that under-financing should be\navoided. Does it mean that the individual\nbanker has absolutely no discretion to\ndetermine the amount of loan?Financing of the project has to be as per\nthe project profile. The project profile\nindicates the amount of investment that is\nrequired for each activity. However, the\nbankers do have a final say in the sanction\nof loans as indicated in the guidelines.\n10. Documents to be obtained from\nindividuals/ SHG under SGSYThe application and documentation\nformats provided for individuals/group\nloaning under IRDP may be used with\nsuitable modifications under SGSY.\nInsurance Cover\n1.

Group may consist of 10 to 20 persons-\nMaximum quantum of loan to the group\ncould be Rs. 10 lakhs and minimum may\nbe Rs. 5 lakhs. Collateral security upto Rs.\n10 lakhs should be waived.The security norms were revised in the\nCLCC meeting held in June'99. Norms\nindicated in paragraph 5.9 of the Master\nCircular may be followed\n2. In case of group loans, if the group is not\nin a position to offer its own assets as\ncollateral security, banks may seek\ncollateral security from individual\nmembers of the Group. Norms may be\nstipulated for obtaining collateral security\nin respect of group loans.Collateral Security may be obtained if the\nprime security is not sufficient. In such a\ncase it will be open to the bank to seek\ncollateral from individual members of the\ngroup or others depending on the\ncircumstances of the case. Bankers are free\nto decide.\nSubsidy\n1. RPCD.BC.6/568(A)(P) dated 10.7.91\npermits the principal branches in a district\nto allow overdrawing to the extent of 10%\nof total subsidy allocated for the year. The\nlimits for each bank is decided in the\nmeeting to finalise physical financial target\nwhether the said guidelines under IRDP\nwould hold good for SGSY. If so, the latest\nposition in the matter.The same instructions will hold good under\nSGSY.\n2. What will be the subsidy component in\nmultiple doses of credit involving Minor\nIrrigation Project where there is no\nmonetary ceiling?There is no ceiling on subsidy in respect of\nminor irrigation project even in case of\nmultiple doses of credit for individual as\nwell as for group loans.

If Swarozgari does not purchase the .assets\nwithin one month from the date of release\nof the amount by the bank, what steps\nshould be initiated and how to recover the\nloan amount from the Swarozgari?The reasons for non procurement should be\nlooked into by the bank/ BDO. If the non-\nprocurement of assets is wilful or due to\nnegligence of the Swarozgari, after giving\nreasonable opportunity for procurement the\nbank is free to cancel the loan and recover\nthe money.\nRisk Fund for Consumption Credit\n1. 10% of consumption loans disbursed by\nbanks could be provided out of Risk Fund\nat District Level for Swarozgaris from\nWeaker Section. Whether this 10% is\nsubsidy or repayable loan.The banks will get 10% of the\nconsumption credit disbursed by them\nduring the year from DRDA to maintain a\nrisk fund. The fund enables the bank to\nwrite-off consumption loans which have\nbecome irrevocable.\n2. At what point of time consumption credit\nis to be disbursed and whether any separate\napplication form/security document is\nrequired to be obtained or it should be\nincluded within SGSY application form\nand limit will be inclusive of consumption\nloan limit.Swarozgaris (other than Self Help Group\nmembers) may be considered for\nconsumption loan not exceeding Rs.\n2,000/-. Separate application/document\nwould be necessary. The members of\nSHGs will not be eligible for consumption\nloan, it is open for the SHGs to meet this\nfrom the cash credit facility.\n3. Modalities of opening/applying for the risk\nfund may be elaborated. Who will be the\nimplementing agency for this fund and\nwhat does it cover?Risk Fund is to be constituted by banks to\ncover the risk arising out of loans\nsanctioned for consumption purposes to\nWeaker Section including SGSY\nborrowers, small marginal farmers,\nlandless agricultural workers, rural artisans\netc. ( para 4.30 of SGSY guidelines). The\nmodalities are available in Annexure XXI\nof IRDP Manual.\nRepayment of Loan\n1. Does the 'number of instalments' and\n'repayment' have the same meaning?The repayment period varies according to\nthe activity taken up. Number of\ninstalments would, therefore, depend on\nthe amount of loan, interest liability andNo. Matter Referred Clarifications\nthe repayment period (i.e. 5, 7 and 9 years\nas the case may be) of the activity for\nwhich the loan has been given. This will be\npart of the Project Profile.\n2. What is prompt repayment period to entitle\nfor the waiver of 0.5% processing-cum-\nmonitoring fee. If waived, how further\npayment may be made?So long as the loan repayment has not been\ndelayed by the Swarozgari beyond a\nschedule of time limit (with grace period)\nfor repayment instalment the account may\nbe considered as regular. The processing-\ncum-monitoring fee could be waived in the\nlast instalment.\n3. In case the loan is fully repaid before\ncertain period specified i.e. lock-in-period,\nthe borrower is eligible for pro-rata\nsubsidy. The working of pro-rata needs\nelucidation.Working of pro-rata subsidy for SGSY\nrepayment is enclosed.\n4. Income of beneficiary necessarily crosses\nRs. 2,000/- p.m. net of bank instalment,\nafter taking up the activity or at the end of\nthird year. It may not be possible for a poor\nman to take up activity of such a scale\nwhich would generate cash surpluses of\nmore than Rs. 4,000/-. District SGSY\nCommittee may attempt to formulate\ncomparatively bigger project which may\nfail for want of skill and experience.A number of Project profiles being worked\nout in the field and the feedback from the\nStates indicate that this can be achieved.\nRecovery\n1. Incentive and disincentive for recovery.\nWhether the processing-cum-monitoring\nfee is to be charged as one time measure in\nconcerned Swarozgaris accounts or\nwhether it can be charged every year.The processing-cum-monitoring fee has to\nbe charged once at the time of\ndisbursement of the loan.\n2. RBI circular reads: In case of default in\nrepayment of loan by any Swarozgari,\nbanks may adjust subsidy (including\ninterest earned) against his dues after\ngetting approval from Dist. SGSY\nCommittee.No interest is payable on the subsidy kept\nin Subsidy Reserve Fund A/c. and like-\nwise no interest is chargeable on the\namount of loan representing subsidy\nportion. The clause \"including interest\nearned\" may be deleted from RBI circular\nas well as para 4.24 of Government\nguidelines.No. Matter Referred Clarifications\n3. Whether processing charges are to be\nlevied at the time of disbursement or at the\ntime of referring the case to NGO for\nassistance in recovery and monitoring.\nWhether it has to be refunded in case of\nprompt recovery?The processing-cum-monitoring charges\nmay be levied at the time of disbursement\nof loan and refunded i.e. adjusted towards\nthe repayment in the last instalment since\nthe repayment position will be known\ntowards the end.\n4. A benchmark level of recovery should be\nmaintained at each village/block and banks\nwould have to review about further lending\nin such village/block where recovery is\nless than the minimum level.The banks have been requested to prepare\nthe defaulters list by end of September\n1999. The matter will be reviewed at the\nappropriate time. For SGSY, minimum\nrecovery levels should be 80%.\nSupervision & Monitoring\n1. In some States, the quarterly meetings of\nBlock Committees under SAA are being\nturned into SGSY Committee meetings,\nthus defeating the purpose for setting up\nseparate fora under SGSY at Block/ Dist.\nLevel.The issues relating to SGSY are to be\ntaken up for discussion in the Block and\nDistrict SGSY committees. SGSY has\nspecific committees because it requires\nspecial attention. The need for separate\ncommittees on SGSY exists at least for the\nfirst 2-3 years so that issues can be\ndiscussed threadbare.\n2. Convenors at all levels except at District\nlevel are Government officials - LDM is\nthe convenor at District level forum. In\nview of this and for meaningful co-\nordination between the agencies, convenor\nat district level be changed and District\nlevel government official may be\nnominated as convenor District SGSY\nCommittee.There is no change in the existing position.\n3. It has been suggested that Block level\nSGSY Committee monthly meetings of\nthat month and quarterly BLBC meetings\nbe synchronised to enable the LDO to\nattend them on selective basis.LDOs may attend the Block level SGSY\nmeetings selectively only when they attend\nSC/DCC meetings if the BLBC is\nconducted before or after.\n4. Similarly, under SGSY there is a District\nSGSY Committee which is akin to SC of\nDCC. There is need to synchronise these\nfora also.The present position may continue.\nService Area Approach\n1. Under SGSY Scheme, District SGSY\nCommittee has been empowered to\nallocate the villages which are either notThis was discussed and decided in the\nCLCC. In order to ensure that such\nreallocation does not pose any problem atNo. Matter Referred Clarifications\ncovered by any bank branch or where\nconcerned bank branch has not performed\nfor any reason. Please clarify whether the\nreallocation of village is restricted to\nSGSY Scheme alone or for all other\nbanking activities in the village and\nwhether RBI approval is necessary.the level of implementation we have\nadvised in para XVIII of our circular dated\n1.9.1999 that the reallocation decision be\nreferred to DCC for its consideration and\nnecessary action.\n2. In case group loaning covering 2/3\nvillages, the branch having more members\nfrom its service area may finance the\nGroup.The Block/District SGSY Committee may\ndecide on the basis of allocation given to\neach branch. Group loaning can also be\ndecided by the BLBC/ DCC/SC.\nSubmission of Data\n1.

Special\nconditions, if any, attached to such licence should strictly be adhered to while opening letters\nof credit or making remittances.A.3 Obligation of Purchaser of Foreign Exchange\n(i) In terms of Section 10(6) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999\n(FEMA), any person acquiring foreign exchange is permitted to use it either for\nthe purpose mentioned in the declaration made by him to an authorised  dealer\nunder Section 10(5) of the Act or to use it for any other purpose for which\nacquisition of exchange is permissible under the said Act, or Rules or Regulations\nframed thereunder.\n(ii) Where foreign exchange acquired has been utilised for import of goods   into\nIndia the authorised dealer should ensure that importer furnishes an evidence of\nimport to his satisfaction, as laid down in paragraph A.18.\n(iii) In case payment for import is made by way of credit to non-resident account of\nthe overseas exporter or by way of credit to resident account of a non-resident\nbank, authorised dealer should ensure compliance with sub-paragraph ( i) and (ii)\nabove.\n(iv) The Directions contained in this paragraph are also applicable where payment for\nimports into India is made through ACU mechanism.\nA.4 Manner of R upee Payment\nPayments for retirement of bills drawn under letters of credit as well as bills received from\nabroad for collection against imports into India, must be received by authorised  dealers,\nirrespective of amount, by debit to the account of the importer maintained with themselves or by\nmeans of a crossed cheque drawn by the importer on his other bankers. Payments against bills,\nunder no circumstances, should be accepted in cash.\nA.5 Letters of Authority\nAuthorised dealers may open letters of credit or make remittances where the Exchange Control\n(EC) copy of the relative import licence has been issued in the name of a party other than the\napplicant, provided the applicant produces a letter of authority obtained from the import licence\nholder in his favour authorising him, inter- alia , to open letters of credit or make remittances for\npayment towards import under the licence (subject to the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated\nin this regard in the EXIM Policy in force). Authorised dealers may also open letters of credit or\nmake remittances towards imports permitted without licences on behalf of authorised agents of\nimporters, after satisfying themselves by reference to the EXIM Policy in force that the importers\nare permitted to utilise services of agents for the imports in question. In all such cases, the\nresponsibility for production of the Customs Bill of Entry, wherever  required, will rest on the\nletter of authority holder or agent.\nA.6 Form A 1Applications by persons, firms and companies for making payments towards imports into India\nmust be made on form A1. Variants of this form have been devised in different colours to be\nused for -\n(i)remittance in foreign currency,\n(ii)transfer of rupees to non-resident bank accounts, and\n(iii)remittance through Asian Clearing Union.\nCare should be taken to ensure that duly filled in A1 form in appropriate format has been\nobtained.\nA.7Imports Financed in Rupees\nDirections contained herein  are also applicable to imports which are financed in rupees and\npayment for which is made by crediting rupees to a non-resident account in India or to a rupee\naccount maintained by a non-resident bank.\nA.8 Endorsement on Import Licences\n(i) Authorised dealers should note to endorse on the \u2018Exchange Control Copy\u2019 of\nimport licences, under their stamp and signature, the details of letters of credit\nopened or forward contracts booked or remittances made in foreign currency as\nalso the amount of insurance and  freight paid by the importer locally in rupees,\nwherever licences have been obtained by importers.\n(ii) Authorised dealers may likewise endorse on the \u2018Exchange Control Copy\u2019 of  the\nimport licence the value of the back-to-back inland letters of  credit  opened by\nthem on behalf of duty free licence  holders (including transferees) as   required\nin terms of the relevant  provisions of the EXIM Policy in force.\nA.9 Import Licences for c.i.f. Value\n(i) Import licences are normally issued for the c.i.f. value of the goods to be\nimported.  Import licences cannot be used to the full amount in cover of  f.o.b.\ncost of the goods leaving insurance and freight to local agent of the supplier, as\nadditional charges to be paid in rupees over the amount specified in the import\nlicence.\n(ii) Importers sometime enter into contracts on f.o.b. terms and agree to the suppliers\npaying for the freight to be reimbursed to them along with the cost of the goods.\nAuthorised dealers in such cases should, before making the remittance of freight\ncharges, ascertain the actual freight amount paid with reference to the original\nfreight bill or memo issued by the shipping company or the amount stated on the\nrelative bill of lading.\nA.10Surrender of Import LicencesExchange Control copy of the import licence submitted by importer for opening of L/C or\nmaking remittance when fully utilised, should be retained by authorised dealers and may be\npreserved till scrutiny by the internal audit or inspection is completed.\nA.11 Advance Remittance\nAuthorised dealers may allow advance remittance for import of goods without any ceiling\nsubject to the following conditions :\n(a) the importer should hold the EC copy of a valid import licence if  the goods to be\nimported requiring licence for import under the EXIM Policy in force;\n(b) remittance is made direct to the suppliers;\n(c) if the amount of advance remittance exceeds U.S.$25,000 or its equivalent, a\nguarantee from an international bank of repute situated outside India or a\nguarantee of an authorised dealer in India, if such  a guarantee is issued against\nthe counter-guarantee of an international bank of repute situated outside India,\nshould be obtained. An unconditional standby L/C from an international bank of\nrepute situated outside India may also be accepted in lieu of bank guarantee\nprovided it is irrevocable, non-transferable and lists out full particulars  of the\ntransactions and there is a clear provision for prompt   payment   being  received\nin  convertible  currency  in  an approved manner. The validity of the guarantee\n/letter of credit should adequately cover the period for the  purpose of enforcing\npayment;\n(d) physical import of goods into India should be made within three months (twelve\nmonths in case of  capital goods)  from  the date of remittance and the importer\nshould give an undertaking to furnish  documentary evidence of import within\nfifteen days from the close of the relevant period. Authorised dealers, if satisfied\nwith the request, may allow extension of time for import not exceeding one month\n(three months in case of capital goods). In cases where the advance remittance has\nbeen made against a bank guarantee, the guarantee should be suitably amended, if\nneed be, to cover the extended period for import of  goods into India; and\n(e) authorised dealer should ensure that in the event of non-import of      goods, the\namount of advance remittance is repatriated to India or is utilised for any other\npurposes for which release of exchange is permissible under the Act, Rules or\nRegulations made thereunder, to the satisfaction of the authorised dealer.\nA.12 Time Limit for Settlement of Import Payments\n(i)      In terms of the extant Rules, remittances against imports should be completed not later\nthan six months from the date of shipment. Accordingly, deferred payment arrangements\ninvolving payments beyond a period of six months from the date of shipment are treated as\nexternal commercial borrowings which require prior approval of the Reserve Bank/Governmentof India { cf: Regulation 5 (3) of Reserve Bank Notification No. FEMA 3/2000-RB dated May 3,\n2000}. There would, however, be no objection to importers withholding amounts not exceeding\n15 per cent of the cost of goods towards guarantee of performance, etc. Authorised dealers may\nmake remittances of amounts so withheld, provided the earlier remittance had been made\nthrough them. No payment of interest is permissible on such withheld amounts.\n(ii)Sometimes, settlement of import dues may be delayed due to disputes, financial\ndifficulties, etc. Authorised dealers may make remittances in such cases even if the period of six\nmonths has expired, provided -\n(a) authorised dealer is satisfied about the genuineness of the circumstances leading\nto the delay in payment; and\n(b) no payment of interest is involved for the additional period. However, in cases\nwhere the overseas supplier insists on payment of interest, it may be allowed in\naccordance with the provisions contained in paragraph A.13, upto a maximum\nperiod of 60 days beyond 180 days from the date of shipment provided the import\nbill is paid within that period.\nNOTES:\nA.     In case of import bills negotiated under letter of credit and retired by   importer\nafter expiry of six months from the date of shipment of relative goods, settlement\nof the payment would be deemed to be completed within six months from the date\nof shipment if reimbursement was made  to the overseas bank within that period,\nB.       Remittances against import of books may be allowed without restriction as to\ntime limit, provided no interest payment is involved nor has the importer\nforgone any part of the discount/ rebate normally allowed to importers towards\ncompensation for delay in settlement of dues.\nA.13   Interest on Import Bills\n(i)    Authorised   dealers may make remittances on account of interest accrued on usance bills\nunder 'normal interest clause' or of overdue interest payable on sight bills for a period not\nexceeding six months from the date of shipment in respect of imports without prior approval of\nReserve Bank.\nNOTE : Interest under 'normal interest clause' would mean interest at the 'prime' rate (or\nits equivalent) of the country in the currency of which the goods are invoiced or LIBOR for\nthe currency.\n (ii)    In case of pre-payment of usance import bills, remittances may be made only after\nreducing the proportionate interest for the un-expired portion of usance at the rate, according to\nthe contract, at which the interest has been claimed  for the usance period or the prime rate orLIBOR of the currency in which the goods have been invoiced , whichever is applicable.\nWhere interest is not separately claimed, remittances may be allowed after deducting the\nproportionate interest for the un-expired portion of usance at the prevailing 'prime' rate/ LIBOR\nof the currency of invoice.\nA.14    War Risk Insurance/Bunker/Congestion Surcharge\n             /Premium for Extended Insurance\nAuthorised dealers may make remittances towards war risk insurance premium,\nbunker/ congestion  surcharge at foreign ports, premia for extended insurance cover, etc., which\nare incidental to imports.\nA.15  Imports under Penalty\nAuthorised  dealers may make remittances against goods imported without authority, but later\nallowed to be cleared by the Customs Authorities against payment of penalty, to the extent of\nc.i.f. value of the goods indicated on the relative Exchange Control copy of the Customs Bill of\nEntry evidencing imports of goods to India.\nA.16     Remittances against Replacement Imports\n(i)  In case import of an item does not require licence under the Export -Import Policy in force\nand there is a need for remittance of foreign exchange for import of replacement goods for a\ndefective item imported earlier, the remittance should be made after ensuring that there is no\ndouble payment for the same import.\n(ii)  Where goods are short-supplied, damaged, short-landed or lost in transit, the procedure laid\ndown below should be followed for payment against replacement goods:\n(a) In cases where no letter of credit has been opened or remittances made, Exchange\nControl copy of the import licence may be  automatically treated as valid for the\nreplacement consignment,  provided it is shipped within the validity period of the\nlicence.\n(b) If the Exchange Control copy has already been utilised to cover the opening of a\nletter of credit against the original goods which have been lost, the original\nendorsement to the extent of the value of the lost goods may be cancelled by\nauthorised  dealers without reference to the Reserve Bank, provided the insurance\nclaim relating to the lost goods has been settled in favour of the importer by\nremittance from abroad through an authorised  dealer, if insurance was covered\nabroad and by local payment in rupees if insurance was covered in India. Payment\nfor the replacement goods may then be made against suitable endorsement on the\nimport licence subject to the conditions that the replacement consignment is\nshipped within the validity period of the licence.(c) If replacement goods are to be shipped after the expiry of import licence, the\nimporter should be asked to apply to DGFT for replacement or for revalidation of\nthe expired licence.\nA.17      A Guarantee for Replacement Import\nIn case  replacement goods for a defective import are being sent by the overseas supplier before\nthe defective goods imported earlier are dispatched out of India, authorised dealers may issue\nguarantees at the request of importer clients for the despatch/return of defective goods, according\nto their commercial judgement.\nA.18   Evidence of Import\n(i) Obligations of purchaser of foreign exchange as contained in sub-section (6) of Section 10 of\nForeign Exchange Management Act ,1999 are indicated in paragraph A.3, ibid.\n(ii)    In case of all imports, except import through couriers, where value of foreign exchange\nremitted/paid for import into India exceeds US $ 5000 or its equivalent , it is obligatory on the\npart of authorised dealers through whom the relative remittance was made to ensure that the\nimporter submits :-\n(a) the Exchange Control copy of the Bill of Entry for home consumption, or\n(b) in case of 100% Export Oriented Units the exchange control copy of the Bill of\nEntry for warehousing, or\n(c) Customs Assessment Certificate or Postal Appraisal Form as declared  by the\nimporter to the custom authorities, where import has been made by post , as an\nevidence that the goods for which the payment was made have actually been\nimported into India.\n(iii)  where imports are made in  non-physical form, i.e., software or data through internet/\ndatacom channels and drawings and designs through e-mail/fax a certificate from a Chartered\nAccountant that the software/data/ drawing/design has been received by the importer may be\nobtained.\nNote: Authorised dealers should advise importers to keep Custom authorities informed of the\nimports made by them under this  clause.\n(iv)    In respect of remittances for imports through courier services, authorised dealers should\nensure submission of the Exchange Control copy of the Bill of Entry in case of imports valued at\nRupees one lakh or more.  Where the value of import is less than Rs. one lakh, authorised  dealers\nmay obtain from the importer, a copy of the Bill of Entry, in the prescribed form issued by the\nCustoms in the name of registered courier, duly certified by the courier company indicating\nthereon the particulars of the consignment for which the copy has been issued.\n(v)  Authorised dealers should ensure that in all cases, including cases of advance remittance\npermitted in terms of paragraph A.11 above, evidence of import is submitted by their importercustomer and is duly verified.  In respect of imports on D/A. basis, since goods would normally\nbe cleared before the due date of payment, authorised dealers should insist on production of\nevidence of import at the time of effecting remittance of import bill.  Authorised dealers should\nadvise this requirement to their importer customer  while delivering the documents against\nacceptance.\nNOTE: A.In respect of imports on D/A basis if importers fail to produce documentary evidence\ndue to genuine reasons such as non-arrival of consignment, delay in delivery/customs\nclearance of consignment, etc., authorised dealers may, if satisfied with the genuineness of\nrequest,  allow reasonable time not exceeding three months from the date of remittance to the\nimporter to submit the evidence of import.\n(vi)      Authorised dealers should in all cases acknowledge receipt of evidence of import e.g.\nExchange Control copy of the Bill of Entry, Postal Appraisal Form or Customs Assessment\nCertificate, etc., from importers by issuing acknowledgement slips containing the following\nparticulars:\n(a) importer's full name and address with code number ;\n(b) import licence number and date (wherever applicable);\n(c) bank's reference of letter of credit number ,etc., if any;\n(d) number and date of Exchange Control copy of the Bill of  Entry/ Postal\nAppraisal Form or Customs Assessment Certificate and the amount of import ;\nand\n(e) particulars of goods imported.\n(vii)    Internal inspectors or auditors (including external auditors appointed by authorised\ndealers) should carry out 100 per cent verification of the documents evidencing import, e.g.\nExchange Control copies of Bills of Entry or Postal Appraisal Form or Customs Assessment\nCertificate, etc.\n(viii)   Documents evidencing import into India received in terms of paragraph A.18(ii) above\nshould be preserved by authorised dealers for a period of one year from the date of its\nverification as required under sub-paragraph (vii) above. However, in respect of cases which\nare under investigation by investigating agencies, the documents should be destroyed only\nafter obtaining clearance from the investigating agency concerned.\nA.19   Follow up by Authorised Dealers\n(i)     In case an importer does not furnish the document of evidence of import, as required under\nparagraph A.18, within 3 months from the date of remittance involving foreign exchange\nexceeding US$5,000, the authorised dealer should rigorously follow-up for the next 3 months ,\nincluding issue of registered letters to the importer ,for submission of an appropriate document as\nevidence of import.\n(ii)     Authorised dealers should forward to the Reserve Bank a statement on   half yearly basis\nas at the end of June & December of every year, in form BEF  (format enclosed) furnishingdetails of import transactions, exceeding US$5,000 in respect of which importers have defaulted\nin submission of an appropriate document evidencing import within 6 months from the date of\nremittance.  The said half yearly statement should be submitted to the Regional Office of the\nReserve Bank under whose jurisdiction the authorised dealer is functioning, within 15 days from\nthe end of half year to which the statement relates.\n Note: A. In cases where at the time of advance remittance purpose of remittance  was\nindicated as import and subsequently the exchange has been used for a purpose\nfor which sale of exchange is permissible, and a document to the satisfaction of\nauthorised dealer has been produced, such cases should not be treated as\ndefault and hence be excluded from the BEF statement .\n                  B .    Authorised dealers may accept Into Bond Bill of Entry as a provisional evidence\nof import into India. However, they may ensure submission of Exchange Control\ncopy of the Bill of Entry for Home consumption within a reasonable period of\ntime. Wherever Into Bond Bill of Entry has been submitted such cases need not\nbe reported in BEF statement.\nA.20  Precautions for Handling Import Documents\nAuthorised dealers should exercise due care while handling import documents on collection\nbasis on behalf of importer customers with reference to their line of business, financial standing,\nfrequency of  import,  etc.  to  establish the genuineness of the import. In the case of bills\ninvolving large values, authorised dealers should satisfy themselves that the importer is known\nto be trading in items mentioned in the shipping documents or that the items are required for his\nactual use. In case of importers who are not their constituents, authorised dealers should, at the\ntime of acceptance of the documents/making payment, call for detailed Certificate-cum-Report\nfrom their bankers in support of the genuineness of imports.\nA.21     Receipt of import Bills/Documents\n(i)  Import bills and documents should be received from the banker of the seller by the banker of\nthe buyer in India. Authorised dealers should not, therefore, make remittances where import\nbills have been received directly by the importers from the overseas seller, except in the\nfollowing cases:\n(a) Where the value of import bill does not exceed U.S.$ 10,000.\n(b) Import bills received by wholly-owned Indian subsidiaries of foreign companies\nfrom their principals.\n(c) Import bills received by Super Star Trading Houses, Star Trading Houses,\nTrading Houses, Export Houses ,100% Export Oriented Units/ Units in Free Trade\nZones, Public Sector Undertakings and Limited Companies.\n(d) Where the value of import bill does not exceed U.S.$ 25,000 in respect of import\nof -\n(i) books and magazines(ii) life saving drugs/ equipments by Hospitals, etc. and\n(iii) imports by reputed research and other development institutions  like Tata\nInstitute of Fundamental Research, C-DOT, Indian  Institute of\nTechnology, Indian Institute of Science and  Universities.\n(e) Import bills received by all limited companies viz. Public limited, public limited\nand private limited companies.\n(ii)In all other cases, at the request of importer clients, authorised dealers may receive bills\ndirect from the overseas seller up to U.S.$ 25,000 (U.S. Dollars Twenty five thousand only),\nprovided the authorised dealer is fully satisfied about the financial standing/status and track\nrecord of the importer customer. Before extending the facility, authorised dealer should obtain\nreport on each individual overseas seller from the overseas banker or reputed credit agency.\nA.22   Postal Imports\nRemittances   against   bills  received for collection in respect of imports by post parcel may be\nmade by authorised dealers, provided the goods imported are such as are normally despatched by\npost parcel. In these cases, the relative parcel receipts must be produced as evidence of despatch\nthrough the post and an undertaking to submit Postal Appraisal Form or Customs Assessment\nCertificate as evidence of import  within three months from the date of remittance should be\nfurnished by importers. If the parcel has already been received  in  India  Postal  Appraisal  Form\nor  Customs  Assessment   Certificate should be produced in support of the remittance\napplication. Where goods to be imported are not of a kind normally imported by post parcel or\nwhere authorised  dealer is not satisfied about the bonafides  of the application, the case should be\nreferred to the Reserve Bank for prior approval with full particulars together with relative parcel\nreceipt/s and Postal Appraisal Form or Customs Assessment Certificate.\nNOTE: Authorised dealers may make remittances towards import of books by post parcel by\nbook-sellers/publishers against bills received for collection, irrespective of the amounts\ninvolved, without prior approval of the Reserve Bank against endorsement on the\nimport licence wherever applicable in the normal course. They may also make\nremittances even if import licences covering the imports have been issued subsequent\nto the date of import subject to endorsement on such licences.\nA.23   Import of Gold/Platinum/Silver by Nominated Banks/Agencies\n(i) Import of Gold on Consignment basis\nGold may be imported by the nominated agencies/banks on consignment basis where the\nownership of the goods will remain with the supplier and the importer (consignee) will be\nacting as an agent of the supplier (consignor). Remittances towards the cost of import shall be\nmade as and when sales take place and in terms of the provisions of agreement entered into\nbetween the overseas supplier and nominated agency/bank.(ii) Import of gold on unfixed price basis\nThe nominated agency/bank may import gold on outright purchase basis subject to the condition\nthat although ownership of the gold shall be passed on to the importer at the time of import\nitself, the price of gold shall be fixed later, as and when the importer sells the gold to the users.\nNOTE: Instructions contained in this paragraph would also apply to import of\nplatinum and silver.\nA.24  Import of films on lease/rental basis\nAuthorised dealers may allow remittance of rent, royalty, licence fee, profit, etc., in connection\nwith import of cinematograph feature films and video films subject to the following conditions:\n(i)  a 'No Objection Certificate' from Central Board of Film Certification, wherever\nrequired, has been submitted;\n(ii) a Chartered Accountant's certificate is produced indicating that the payment to\noverseas supplier is due and the amount sought to be remitted is in conformity\nwith the terms of contract; and\n(iii)  an undertaking/Certificate regarding payment of income-tax has been submitted.\nA.25Import factoring\nAuthorised dealers may enter into arrangements with international factoring companies of\nrepute, preferably members of Factors Chain International, without approval of the Reserve\nBank.  However, authorised dealers will have to ensure compliance with the extant exchange\ncontrol directions relating to imports, EXIM policy in force and any other guidelines/directives\nissued by the Reserve Bank in this regard.\nA.26    Import of Gold, Silver & Jewellery\nGold brought by an NRI in accordance with the Export and Import Policy in vogue, is permitted\nto be sold to residents against payment in rupees. Authorised dealers should credit the amounts\nso received only to ordinary non-resident rupee ( NRO) accounts of the concerned NRI seller.\nSection- B\nMerchanting Trade\nAuthorised  dealers may take necessary precautions in handling merchant trade transactions or\nintermediary trade transactions to ensure that (a) goods involved in the transaction are permitted\nto be imported into India, (b) such transactions do not involve foreign exchange outlay for a\nperiod exceeding three months, and (c) all Rules, Regulations and Directions applicable to export\nout of India are complied with by the export leg and all Rules, Regulations and Directionsapplicable to import are complied with by the import leg of merchanting  trade transactions .\nAuthorised dealers are also required to ensure timely receipt of payment for the export leg of such\ntransactions.\nSection -  C\n Import of Currency\n(i)    Import of currency , including cheques, is governed by clause (g) of sub-section (3) of\nSection 6 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, and the Foreign Exchange\nManagement (Export and import of currency) Regulations 2000, made by  the Reserve Bank\nvide Notification No. FEMA 6/RB-2000 dated  May 3, 2000.\n(ii)   All imports of currency not covered by the general permission granted under the\nRegulations require prior permission of the Reserve Bank.BEF\n(See paragraph A.19)\nStatement showing details of remittances effected towards import in respect of which\ndocumentary evidence has not been received despite reminders\nName and address of AD branch .....................................\nName of Controlling Office of AD branch ...........................\nStatement for the half year ......................................\nNOTES:\ni)  The statement should be submitted, in duplicate, to the Regional Office of the Reserve Bank\nunder whose jurisdiction of A.D. branch is functioning.\nii)Details of transactions where the amount of remittance exceeds US$ 5000 or its\nequivalent should only be included in the statement.\niii)The statement should include details of all re mittances from India or payments from\nabroad in connection with imports, including advance payments, delayed payments, etc.\nirrespective of the source of funding (i.e. EEFC accounts/foreign currency accounts maintained\nin India and abroad, payments out of external commercial borrowings, foreign investments in the\nshares of importers etc.)\niv)The cases reported in Part I of statement for the previous half year should not be reported\nagain in Part I of the statement for the current half year.\nv)  In case no transaction is required to be reported, 'NIL' statement should be submitted.\nvi)  Statement should be submitted within 15 days from the end of the half year.Part I\nInformation regarding importers who have defaulted in submission of\nthe documentary evidence of import\nSr.\nNo.Importer/\nExporter\nCode No.Name\nand\naddress\nof the\nimporterNo. and\ndate of\nimport\nlicences,\nif anyBrief\ndescriptio\nn of goodsDate of\nremittance\n/ paymentCurrenc\ny and\namountRupee\nequiva-\nlentRemarks\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nA.

BC. 12/13.03.00/2001-02\nAugust 13, 2001\nShravana 22 , ,1923(S)\nChief Executives of all Scheduled Commercial Banks\nDear Sir,\nMaster Circular-Exposure Norms\nAs you are aware, the Reserve Bank of India has, from time to time, issued a number of\ncirculars containing instructions to banks on matters relating to credit exposure, extent of\ninvestments in shares, debentures, bonds and debt instruments of corporate bodies, Public\nSector Undertakings ( PSU), Financial Institutions and other banks and unsecured guarantees\nand advances. In order to enable the banks to have all the existing instructions on the subject at\none place, a Master Circular was prepared wherein the existing instructions were consolidated.\nFurther, this Master Circular has been suitably revised after incorporating the instructions\nissued between 1st July 2000 and 30th June 2001.\n2.It may be noted that all the instructions contained in circulars listed in Part A of the\nAppendix as   well as   in the relevant paragraphs   indicated in Column 4 of the Part B of the\nAppendix have been consolidated. We advise that this revised Master Circular supersedes the\ninstructions contained in these circulars issued by the RBI.\nYours faithfully\n(K.Seetharamu)\nChief General Manager\nMaster Circular on Exposure Norms\n1. General\n1.1 As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration\nof credit risks, the Reserve Bank of India has advised the banks to fix limits on their exposure -\n- to individual borrowers and group  borrowers in India,\n- to specific industry or sectors, and\n- towards unsecured guarantees and unsecured advances.\n1.2 In addition, banks are also required to observe certain statutory and regulatory exposure\nlimits in respect of -\n- advances against shares, debentures & bonds, and\n- investments in shares, debentures & bonds.22. Credit exposures to individual/group borrowers\n2.1 Ceilings\n2.1.1 The credit exposure ceiling should be fixed in relation to bank's capital funds and it\nshould not exceed 25 percent of capital funds in the case of individual borrowers including\npublic sector undertakings upto March 31, 2000 and 20% from April 1, 2000; such credit\nshould not exceed 50 percent in the case of group borrowers. Internationally, exposure\nceilings are computed in relation to total capital as defined under capital adequacy\nstandards (Tier I and Tier II Capital). Taking into account the best international practices, it\nhas been decided to adopt the concept of capital funds as defined under capital adequacy\nstandards for determining exposure ceiling uniformly both by domestic and foreign banks,\neffective from March 31, 2002. The exposure ceiling limits applicable from April 1, 2002\nwould be based on the capital funds in India as computed above. As the concept of capital\nfunds has been broadened to represent total capital (Tier I and Tier II), it has been decided\nto adjust the exposure ceiling for single borrower from the existing 20 per cent to 15 per\ncent of capital funds effective from March 31, 2002. Similarly, the group exposure limits\nwill be adjusted effective from March 31, 3003, to 40 per cent of capital funds.\n2.1.2 Credit exposure to borrowers belonging to a group may exceed the exposure norm of\n50 percent of the bank\u2019s capital funds by an additional 10 percent (i.e. upto 60 percent) ,\nprovided the additional credit exposure is on account of extension of credit to\ninfrastructure projects  (i.e. power, telecommunication, roads and ports). Since the group\nexposure limits will be adjusted effective from March 31, 2002, to 40 per cent of capital\nfunds, this limit will be extendable by another 10 per cent i.e. upto 50 per cent effective\nfrom that date.\n2.1.3 Lending under Consortium Arrangements\nThe exposure limits will be applicable to lending under consortium arrangements, wherever\nformalised.\n2.2 Exemptions\n2.2.1 Rehabilitation of Sick/Weak Industrial Units\nThe above ceilings on single/group exposure limits would not be applicable to\nexisting/additional credit facilities (including funding of interest and irregularities) granted\nto weak/sick industrial units under rehabilitation packages.\n2.2.2   Food credit\nBorrowers to  whom limits are allocated directly by the Reserve Bank, for food credit, will\nbe exempt from the ceiling.\n2.3 Definitions\n2.3.1 Capital Funds\nCapital funds for the purpose will comprise paid-up capital and free reserves as per the\npublished accounts  as on 31st   March of the previous year Reserves, if any, created by\nway of revaluation of fixed assets etc. may be excluded for the purpose. As already\nmentioned in para 2.1.1, Capital Funds in India would comprise of Tier I and Tier II capital\nas defined under capital adequacy standards with effect from March 31, 2002.32.3.2 In the case of foreign banks , the components of capital funds are defined as\nunder:\n(a) Tier I & II capital (excluding revaluation reserves) as on 31 March of the\nprevious year. Average outstanding foreign currency loans granted to Indian companies by\nthe foreign banks and their wholly owned subsidiaries at the end of each month during the\nprevious year ended March.\n(cf. para 2 & 3 of circular 9 at Appendix B).\n(b) Average monthly outstanding for the previous year ended 31st March under the\nlines of credit granted to banks in India under PCFC and other schemes approved by the\nRBI.\n(c) Average monthly outstandings for the previous year ended 31st March under\nthe foreign currency line of credit granted by the Head Office/other offices of the bank to\nthe Indian branch under PCFC and other schemes approved by the RBI.\nWith effect from March 31, 2002 capital funds in India would comprise of Tier I & II\ncapital as defined under capital adequacy standards.\n2.3.3   Exposure\nExposure shall include credit exposure ( funded and non-funded credit limits) and\ninvestment exposure ( underwriting  and similar commitments ) as well as certain types of\ninvestments in companies. The sanctioned limits or outstandings, whichever are higher,\nshall be reckoned for arriving at exposure limit. However, in respect of non-funded credit\nlimits, only 50 percent of such limits or outstandings, whichever is higher , need be taken\ninto account for the purpose.\ni. In line with international best practices it has been decided that non-fund based\nexposures should also be reckoned at 100 per cent effective from April 1, 2003.\nii. At present, derivative products such as Forward Rate Agreements ( FRAs) and\nInterest Rate Swaps ( IRSs) are also captured for computing exposure by applying the\nconversion factors to notional principal amounts as per the original exposure method\nprescribed in Annexure 1 and 2 of our circular MPD.BC. 187/07.01/279/1999-2000 dated\nJuly 7, 1999. It has been decided that, effective from April 1, 2003, banks should also\ninclude forward contracts in foreign exchange and other derivative products like currency\nswaps, options, etc. at their replacement cost value in determining individual/group\nborrower exposure. The methodology to be adopted by banks for arriving at the\nreplacement cost value is being advised separately.\n2.3.4  Credit expo sure comprises of the following elements:\n(a) all types of funded and non-funded credit limits.\n(b) facilities extended by way of equipment leasing, hire purchase finance and factoring\nservices.\n(cf. para (iii) of circular 10 at Appendix B).\n(c) advances against shares, debentures, bonds, units of mutual funds, etc. to stock\nbrokers, market makers.\n(d) bank loan for financing promoters contributions.\n(e) bridge loans against equity flows/issues.4(f) financing of Initial Public Offerings ( IPOs).\nInvestments\n2.3.5 Investments comprise the following elements:\n(a) investments in shares and debentures of companies acquired through direct\nsubscription, devolvement arising out of underwriting obligations or purchase from\nsecondary markets or on conversion of debt into equity, shall be reckoned for arriving\nat single borrower/group borrower exposure limit.\n(b) investment in PSU bonds through direct subscription, devolvement arising out\nof underwriting obligations or purchase made in the secondary market, shall be\nreckoned for arriving at single borrower/group borrower exposure limit.\n(c) investments in Commercial Papers ( CPs) issued by Corporate Bodies/ PSUs\nshall be reckoned for arriving at single borrower/group borrower exposure limit.\n(d) investment made by the banks in bonds and debentures of corporates which are\nguaranteed by a PFI (as per list given in Annexure 1 ) will be treated as an exposure by\nthe bank on the PFI and not on the corporate.\n(cf. para 7 of circular 4 at Appendix B).\n2.3.6 Loans and advances granted against the security of bank\u2019s own t erm deposits\nmay be excluded from the purview of the exposure ceiling.\nGroup\n2.3.7 The concept of 'Group' and the task of identification of the borrowers belonging\nto specific industrial groups is left to the perception of the banks/financial institutions.\nBanks/financial institutions are generally aware of the basic constitution of their clientele\nfor the purpose of regulating their exposure to risk assets. The group to which a particular\nborrowing unit belongs, may, therefore, be decided by them on the basis of the relevant\ninformation available with them, the guiding principle being commonality of management\nand effective control.\n2.3.8 For identifying the group to which a company registered under Section 26(2) of\nMRTP Act, 1969 belongs, a reference may be made to the Industrial House-wise list of\ncompanies registered under the Act. The relative list is given in Annexure 2 .\n2.3.9 In respect of borrowers not covered by the MRTP Act, the group affiliation may be\ndecided by banks on the basis of the principle explained above.\n(cf. para 3 of circular 13 at Appendix B).\n2.3.10 In the case of a split in the group, if the split is formalised, the splinter groups will\nbe regarded as separate groups. If banks and financial institutions have doubts about the\nbona fides  of the split, a reference may be made to RBI for its final view in the matter to\npreclude the possibility of a split being engineered in order to prevent coverage under the\nGroup Approach.\n(cf. para ii  of circular 12 at Appendix B).\n2.4 Review\n2.4.1 An annual review of the implementation of exposure management measures may be\nplaced before the Board of Directors before the end of June and a copy each of such review\nmay be furnished for information to the Chief General Manager, Department of Banking5Operations and Development, Reserve Bank of India, World Trade Centre, Mumbai and to\nthe concerned Regional Offices of DBOD.\n3. Credit exposure to industry or certain sectors\n3.1 Internal Exposure Limits\n3.1.1 Specific Sectors\nApart from limiting the exposures to individual or Group of borrowers, as indicated above,\nthe banks may also consider fixing internal limits for aggregate commitments to specific\nsectors e.g. textiles, jute, tea, etc. so that the exposures are evenly spread over various\nsectors. These limits could be fixed by the banks having regard to the performance of\ndifferent sectors and the risks perceived. The limits so fixed may be reviewed periodically\nand revised, as necessary.\n3.1.2 Exposure to Real Estate\nBanks should frame comprehensive prudential norms relating to the ceiling on the total\namount of real estate loans, single/group exposure limits for such loans, margins, security,\nrepayment schedule and availability of supplementary finance and the policy should be\napproved by the bank's Board.\n3.1.3 While framing the bank's policy, the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank\nshould be taken into account. Banks should ensure that the bank credit is used for\nproductive construction activity and not for activity connected with speculation in real\nestate.\n3.2 Exposure to Leasing, Hire Purchase and Factoring Services\n3.2.1 Banks should maintain a balanced portfolio of equipment leasing, hire purchase and\nfactoring services vis-\u00e0-vis the aggregate credit. Their exposure to each of these activities\nshould not exceed 10 percent of total advances.\n(cf. para iv of circular 10 at Appendix B).\n3.3 Exposure to Indian Joint Ventures/Wholly-owned Subsidiaries Abroad\n3.3.1 Banks are allowed to extend credit/non-credit facilities (viz. letters of credit and\nguarantees) to Indian Joint Ventures/Wholly-owned Subsidiaries abroad. Banks are also\npermitted to provide at their discretion, buyer's credit/acceptance finance to overseas\nparties for facilitating export of goods & services from India.\n3.3.2 The above exposure will, however, be subject to a limit of 5 percent  of the\nunimpaired Tier I capital . Higher limits could be considered by the Reserve Bank on\nmerits.\n(cf. para 1 of circular 1 at Appendix B).\n3.3.3 While extending such facilities, banks will have to, inter alia, comply with\nSection 25 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, in terms of which the assets in India of\nevery banking company at the close of business on the last Friday of every quarter shall not\nbe less than 75 percent of its demand and time liabilities in India. In other words, aggregate\nassets outside India should not exceed 25 percent of the bank's demand and time\nliabilities in India .6(cf. para 1(iii) of circular 1 at Appendix B).\n3.3.4 The banks should also comply with all existing safeguards/p rudential guidelines\nrelating to capital adequacy, and exposure norms indicated in paragraph 2.1, ibid.\n3.4 Exposure Limits on Advances against Shares and Holding of Shares as Investments*\n*[For detailed instructions please see Master Circular dated August 28, 1998 on Bank\nFinance against Shares and Debentures and Circular DBOD BP.BC. 119/21.04.137/2000-\n01 dated May 11, 2001 on Bank Financing of Equities and Investments in Shares \u2013 Revised\nGuidelines.]\n3.4.1 Statutory Limit on Shareholding in Companies\nIn terms of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, no banking company shall\nhold shares in any company, whether as pledgee , mortgagee  or absolute owner , of an\namount exceeding 30 percent of the paid-up share capital of that company or 30 percent of\nits own paid-up share capital and reserves, whichever is less, except as provided in sub-\nsection (1) of Section 19 of the Act. Shares held in demat form should also be included for\nthe purpose of determining the exposure limit. This is an aggregate holding limit for\neach company .\n3.4.2   While granting any advance against shares, underwriting an issue of shares, or\nacquiring any shares on investment account or even in lieu of debt of any company, these\nstatutory provisions should be strictly observed.\n(cf. annexure to  circular 5 at Appendix B).\n3.4.3 Regulatory Limits\nThere is also a regulatory stipulation that bank\u2019s aggregate investment in shares ,\nconvertible debentures, bonds, etc. should not exceed 5 per cent of their total outstanding\nadvances (including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous year . This\nceiling of 5 per cent prescribed for investment in shares will henceforth apply to total\nexposure including both fund based and non-fund based to capital market in all forms.\nCertain types of loans and advances against shares are also treated as banks\u2019 investment in\nshares for the purpose of observing this ceiling. Therefore, loans and advances against\nshares for specified purposes are to be clubbed with banks\u2019 investment in shares,\nconvertible debentures, bonds, etc. and the ceiling stipulation of 5 per cent is to be\ncomplied with. The details are given in para 5 below.\nWithin the above overall ceiling of 5 per cent for total exposure to market, the total\ninvestment in shares, convertible bonds and debentures and units of equity-oriented mutual\nfunds by a bank should not exceed 20 per cent of its net worth.\n3.4.4 Advances against Shares to Individuals\nLoans at all the offices of a bank, against the security of shares, debentures and PSU bonds\nto individuals, if held in physical form should not exceed the limit of Rs. 10 lakh per\nborrower (individual) with margin of 40%.\n3.4.5 If the securities are held in demat form, the loans at all the offices of a bank,\nshould not exceed the limit of Rs. 20 lakhs per borrower (individual) with margin of 40%.\nBanks may now grant advances for subscribing to IPOs to individuals. The\nmaximum amount of finance that can be granted to an individual against IPO should\nbe Rs. 10 lakh. The corporates should not be extended finance for investment in other7companies\u2019 IPOs and NBFCs should not be provided finance for further lending to\nindividuals for IPOs. Finance extended by a bank for IPOs should be reckoned as an\nexposure to capital market and hence included within 5% of the bank\u2019s total\noutstanding advances (including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous\nyear.\n(cf. para 7 of Circular 1 at Appendix A)\n3.4.6 Banks should formulate with the approval of their Boards the Lending Policy for\ngrant of advances to individuals against shares, debentures, bonds keeping in view RBI\nguidelines. As a prudential measure, the banks may also consider laying down\nappropriate limits of such advances .\n(cf. para 3(ii), 3(iii) and 3(iv) of circular 5  at Appendix B).\n3.4.7 Advances against units of Mutual funds\nAdvances against units of mutual funds including units of Unit-64 scheme would attract the\nquantum and margin requirements as applicable to advances against shares and debentures\nwherever stipulated.\n3.4.8 Bank finance to employees to buy shares of their own companies\nBanks may provide finance to employees of companies to buy shares of their own\ncompanies. The advance may be granted upto 90 percent of the purchase price of the shares\nbut not exceeding Rs. 50,000/- or six months' salary of the employees, whichever is less.\n3.4.9 Advances against Shares to Stock Brokers and Market Makers\nThe banks are free to provide credit facilities to stockbrokers and market makers on the\nbasis of their commercial judgment, within the policy framework approved by their Boards.\nHowever, in order to avoid any nexus emerging between inter-connected stock broking\nentities and banks, the Board of each bank should fix, within the overall ceiling of 5 per\ncent of their total outstanding advances (including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of\nthe previous year a sub-ceiling for total advances to \u2013\ni all the stock brokers and market makers (both fund based and non-fund based, i.e.\nguarantees); and\nii. to any single stock broking entity, including its associates/ inter-connected companies.\n(cf. para 8 of Circular 1 at Appendix A).\n3.5Bank Loans for Financing Promoters Contributions\n3.5.1 Loans sanctioned to corporates  against the security of shares (as far as possible\ndemat shares) for meeting promoter\u2019s contribution to the equity of new companies in\nanticipation of raising resources, should be treated as bank\u2019s investments in shares which\nwould thus come under the ceiling of 5 per cent of the banks\u2019 total outstanding advances\n(including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous year prescribed for bank\u2019s\ntotal exposure including both fund based and non-fund based to capital market in all forms.\n(cf. para 2 of Circular 1 at Appendix A) .\n3.5.2 These loans will also be subject to individual/g roup of borrowers exposure\nnorms detailed in paragraph 2.1.1, ibid.\n3.5.3 These loans will also be subject to statutory limit  on shareholding in companies\ndetailed in paragraph 3.4.1 above.83.5.4  Under the refinance scheme of Export Import Bank of India , the bank may\nsanction term loans on merits for eligible Indian promoters for acquisition of equity in\noverseas joint ventures/ wholly owned subsidiaries, provided the term loans have been\napproved by the EXIM Bank for refinance.\n3.6Bridge Loans\n3.6.1    Banks have been permitted to sanction bridge loans to companies for a period\nnot exceeding one year against expected equity flows/issues. Such loans should be included\nwithin the ceiling of 5 per cent of the banks\u2019 total outstanding advances (including\nCommercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous year prescribed for total exposure\nincluding both fund based and non-fund based to capital market in all forms.\n3.6.2   Banks should formulate their own internal guidelines with the approval of their\nBoard of Directors for grant of such loans, exercising due caution and attention to security\nfor such loans.\n3.6.3   Banks may also extend bridge loans against the expected proceeds of Non-\nConvertible Debentures, External Commercial Borrowings, Global Depository Receipts\nand/or funds in the nature of Foreign Direct Investments, provided the bank is satisfied that\nthe borrowing company has already made firm arrangements for raising the aforesaid\nresources/funds.\n4. Exposure to unsecured guarantees and unsecured advances\n4.1.1 Banks have to limit their commitment by way of unsecured guarantees in such a\nmanner that 20 percent of the bank\u2019s outstanding unsecured guarantees plus the total of\noutstanding unsecured advances do not exceed 15 percent of total outstanding advances.\nGuarantees counter-guaranteed by another bank need not be taken into account for the\npurpose of the norm.\n(cf. para 1 & 2 of circular 15 and para 4(iii) of circular. 18  at Appendix B).\n4.1.2  For the purpose of conforming to the above norm, gua rantees covered by\ncounter-guarantees of the Central Government and the State Governments, public sector\nfinancial institutions and insurance companies will be regarded as secured guarantees.\n(cf. para 4(iv) of  circular 18 at Appendix B).\n4.1.3 However, deferred payment guarantees should be backed by adequate tangible\nsecurity or by counter-guarantees of the Central Government or the State Governments or\npublic sector financial institutions, or by counter-guarantees of insurance companies or\nother banks, provided the counter-guarantees of insurance companies or other banks are\nthemselves backed by adequate tangible security. Where the counter-guarantees by\ncommercial banks are backed by adequate tangible securities, then all guarantees, including\ndeferred payment guarantees, will be treated as secured guarantees.\n4.1.4 In exceptional cases, the banks may give deferred payment guarantees on an\nunsecured basis for modest amounts to first class customers who have entered into deferred\npayment arrangements in consonance with Government policy. But such unsecured\nguarantees should be accommodated within the maximum ceiling limits.\n(cf.  instructions in para 4(iv) of circular 18 at Appendix B).95. Exposure norms for investments\n5.1 Banks' Investments in Shares, Debentures and Bonds\n5.1.1 Banks are allowed to invest in the \u2013\n\u2022 Ordinary shares of corporate bodies including other banks,\n\u2022 Shares of public sector undertakings, and\n\u2022 Convertible debentures of corporate bodies including other banks,\nsubject to a ceiling of 5 per cent of the banks\u2019 total outstanding  advances (including\nCommercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous year. Within the above overall ceiling\nbanks investment in shares convertible bonds and debentures and units of equity-oriented\nmutual funds should not exceed 20 per cent of its net worth. The banks are required to\nadhere to the ceiling on an ongoing basis and should exercise care to see that the limit is\nnot exceeded.\n5.1.2 The investment ceiling includes  \u2013\n\u2022 direct investment by a bank in equity shares, convertible bonds and debentures and\nunits of equity oriented mutual funds\n\u2022 investments by banks in the subordinated debts of other banks.\n\u2022 units of Mutual Fund schemes the corpus of which is not exclusively invested in\ncorporate debt.\n\u2022 bank finance for financing promoter\u2019s contribution towards equity capital of new\ncompanies.\n\u2022 bridge loans to companies.\n5.1.3 The investment ceiling excludes  investments in -\n\u2022 preference shares,\n\u2022 non-convertible debentures/bonds of private corporate bodies,\n\u2022 equities/bonds of All-India Financial Institutions (as per list given in Annexure 3 ),\n\u2022 bonds issued by Public Sector Undertakings,\n\u2022 units of Mutual Funds under schemes where corpus is invested exclusively in debt\ninstruments,\n\u2022 venture capital including units of dedicated venture capital funds meant for\nInformation Technology, and\n\u2022 investments in Certificate of Deposits (CDs) of other banks/financial institutions.\n5.1.4 Investments in shares and debentures/bonds, included in the 5 percent ceiling on\ninvestments or excluded from the ceiling, are to be reckoned for the purpose of arriving at\nthe prudential norm of credit exposure for single borrower and group of borrowers as\nstipulated in paragraph 2.1.1 above.\n5.1.5    The investments will include the acquisition through -10\u2022 direct subscription,\n\u2022 private placements,\n\u2022 secondary markets, or\n\u2022 holdings through devolvement of underwriting obligations.\n5.1.6 Purchase of shares and debentures in the secondary market (other than inter-bank\ntransactions) should be only through recognised stock exchanges and registered stock\nbrokers.\nBank's Investment in the Bonds of a Corporate\n5.1.7  For the purpose of calculation of exposure norm, investments made by the banks in\nbonds and debentures of corporates which are guaranteed by a PFI, as per list given in\nAnnexure 1 , will be treated as an exposure by the bank on the PFI and not on the corporate.\n(cf. para 7 of circular. 4 at Appendix B).\n5.1.8   Guarantees issued by the PFI to the bonds of corporates will be treated as an\nexposure by the PFI to the corporates to the extent of 50 percent being a non-fund facility,\nwhereas the exposure of the bank on the PFI guaranteeing the corporate bond will be 100\npercent.\n5.1.9 The PFI before guaranteeing the bonds/debentures should, however, take into\naccount the overall exposure of the guaranteed unit to the financial system.\nExposure Limit on Shareholding in Companies\n5.1.10 As indicated in paragraph 3.4.1 above, bank's investments in shares inclusive of\nlendings  against shares have also to be subjected to statutory provisions contained in\nSection 19(2) whereby the aggregate holding  in a company should not exceed 30 percent\nof the company's paid-up capital or 30 percent of the bank's paid-up capital and reserves,\nwhichever is less.\nBank's Investment in Venture Capital\n5.1.11 In order to encourage the flow of finance for venture capital, the bank\u2019s investment\nin venture capital (including units of dedicated Venture Capital Funds meant for\nInformation Technology) would be over and above the ceiling of 5 per cent of the banks\u2019\ntotal outstanding advances (including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous\nyear. This would , however, be subject to the condition that the venture capital funds/\ncompanies are registered with SEBI.\nBanks' Investment in Subordinated Debt Instruments\n5.1.12 A high level of cross holding of subordinated debt instruments (issued by banks\nand financial institutions to raise Tier II capital) among banks and financial institutions,\ndoes not necessarily lead to accretion of capital to the financial system. As such, a bank's\ninvestment in Tier II bonds issued by other banks and financial institutions shall be\npermitted upto 10 percent  of the investing bank's total capital. The total capital for this\npurpose will be same as that reckoned for the purpose of capital adequacy.\n (cf. para 2(ii) of circular. 1 at Appendix B).\n5.1.13 Investments by banks in the subordinated debts of other banks shall also be\nsubject to the ceiling of 5 percent  applicable to investments in shares and debentures of\ncorporate bodies.115.2Underwriting of Corporate Shares and Debentures\n5.2.1 Generally, there are demands on the banks for underwriting the issues of shares\nand debentures. In order to ensure that there is no over exposure to underwriting\ncommitments to earn fees, the Reserve Bank has laid down the following guidelines which\nthe banks should strictly follow:\n5.2.2 The statutory provision contained in Section 19(2) & (3) of the Banking\nRegulation Act, 1949 regarding holding of shares in any company as pledgee/mortgagee or\nabsolute owner, should be strictly adhered to.\n5.2.3 The banks have to ensure that the shares/debentures including PSU equities and\nshares of other banks, Mutual Funds (the corpus of which is not exclusively invested in\ncorporate debt instruments), the units of UTI subscribed and/or devolving on them as a part\nof their underwriting obligations in any particular year do not exceed 5 per cent of the\nbanks\u2019 total outstanding advances (including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the\nprevious year.\n5.2.4 It may be noted that the limit placed is on the shares and debentures that may be\nheld in the bank\u2019s own portfolio as a result of devolvement and not on the amount of\nunderwriting that the bank may engage in. Normally, the amount of underwriting is a\nmultiple of the amount which devolves finally.\n5.2.5 The banks are required to adhere to the ceiling of 5 per cent of the total\noutstanding advances (including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous year\non an ongoing basis. Banks should exercise care to see that the limit is not exceeded .\n5.2.6 The ceiling of 5 percent does not include investments in preference shares and\nnon-convertible debentures/bonds of private corporate bodies. The ceiling excludes\ninvestment in venture capital including units of dedicated venture capital funds meant for\nInformation Technology.\n5.2.7 The ceiling excludes investments in units of Mutual Funds under schemes\nwhere the corpus is invested exclusively in debt instruments.\n5.2.8 Investments including underwriting devolvements in equities/bonds issued by\nthe All India Financial Institutions, mentioned in Annexure 1 , would be outside the ceiling\nof 5 percent prescribed for investments in shares (including PSU equities) and debentures\nof corporate bodies.\n5.2.9 The underw riting exposure to any company which will include other funded and\nnon-funded credit limits should not exceed 20 percent of capital funds of the bank in the case\nof a single company and 50 percent ( upto 60 percent, provided the additional credit exposure\nis on account of extention  of credit to infrastructure project) in the case of group of\ncompanies. The non-funded limits may be taken at 50 percent of the limit or outstandings,\nwhichever is higher.\n5.2.10 While taking up underwriting commitments, banks or their subsidiaries, should\nensure that the aggregate of such commitments are included in the exposure limits fixed by\nthe Reserve Bank.\n (cf. para 2 (a)of circular. 11 at Appendix B).\n5.2.11 In the case of underwriting, the commitments under a single oblig ation should\nbe fixed taking into account the owned funds of banks or their subsidiaries and the capacity\nto meet the commitments that may devolve and should not in any case exceed 15 percent of\nan issue.125.2.12 Banks should consider sub-underwriting for e very underwritten issue so as to\nminimise chances of devolution on their own account. This is not mandatory. The need for\nand extent of such sub-underwriting is a matter of the bank\u2019s discretion.\n5.2.13 As part of merchant banking activities, while taking up underwriting\nobligations, banks should carefully evaluate the proposals so as to ensure that the issues\nwill have adequate public response and the prospect of devolution of such\nshares/debentures on the underwriting banks will be minimal.\n5.2.14 Banks s hould ensure that the portfolio is diversified and that no unduly large\nunderwriting obligations are taken up in the shares and debentures of a company or a group\nof companies. Banks should make enquiries regarding the other underwriters and their\ncapacity to fulfil the obligations.\n5.2.15 Banks should formulate within the above parameters, their own internal\nguidelines as approved by their Boards of Directors on investments in corporate\nshares/debentures of companies or group of companies including norms to ensure that\nexcessive investment in any single company is avoided and that due attention is given to\nthe maturity structure and quality of such investments.\n5.3     Prohibition on underwriting operations\n5.3.1 Banks should not underwrite issue of Commer cial Paper by any Company,\nPrimary Dealer or Satellite Dealer.\n5.3.2 Banks should not extend Revolving Underwriting Facility to short-term\nFloating Rate Notes/Bonds or debentures issued by corporate entities.\n5.3.3   An annual review covering the underwriting operations taken up during the year,\nwith company-wise details of such operations, the shares/debentures devolved on the\nbanks, the loss (or expected loss) from unloading the devolved shares/debentures indicating\nthe face-value and market value thereof, the commission earned, etc. may be placed before\ntheir Boards of Directors within 2 months of the close of the fiscal year.\n(cf. para 2 of circular. 16 at Appendix B).\n5.4 Underwriting of bonds of Public Sector Undertakings\n5.4.1  Banks can play a useful role in relation to issue of bonds by public sector\nundertaking by underwriting a part of these issues.\n5.4.2   However, it should be kept in view that the major responsibility of the banks is to\nmeet the growing credit needs, especially of working capital of industrial, export and\npriority sectors. This should not be lost sight of by the banks while undertaking new\nactivities.\n5.4.3  Banks should subject the proposals for underwriting to proper scrutiny having regard\nto all the relevant factors and accept such commitments only on well reasoned commercial\nconsiderations with the approval of the appropriate authority.\n5.4.4  With a view to enabling the banks to deploy their surplus funds more\nremuneratively, the banks will have the freedom to acquire PSU bonds including through\nunderwriting devolvements without any ceiling .\n5.4.5 However, the banks should formulate their own internal guidelines as approved\nby their Boards of Directors on investments in and underwriting of PSU bonds, including13norms to ensure that excessive investment in any single PSU is avoided and that due\nattention is given to the maturity structure of such investments. Banks would also need to\ntake into account that such investments are subject to risk weight and necessary\ndepreciation has to be fully provided for.\n5.4.6  Further, such investments in PSU bonds including shares and debentures and\nsubscription to Commercial Papers of PSUs should be reckoned for the purpose of arriving\nat prudential norms of credit exposure for single borrower and group of borrowers.\n5.4.7 Banks should undertake an annual review of the underwriting operations relating\nto bonds of the public sector undertakings, with PSU-wise details of such operations, bonds\ndevolved on the banks, the loss (or expected loss) from unloading the devolved bonds\nindicating the face-value and market value thereof, the commission earned, etc. and place\nthe same to their Boards of Directors within two months from the close of the fiscal year.\n(cf. para 1 of circular 14 at Appendix B).145.5 'Safety Net' Schemes for Public Issues of Shares, Debentures, etc.\n5.5.1 Reserve Bank has observed that some banks/their subsidiaries are providing buy-back\nfacilities under the name of \u2018Safety Net\u2019 Schemes in respect of certain public issues as part\nof their merchant banking activities. Under such schemes, large exposures are assumed by\nway of commitments to buy the relative securities from the original investors at any time\nduring a stipulated period at a price determined at the time of issue, irrespective of the\nprevailing market price.\n5.5.2  In some cases, such schemes are being offered suo motto  without any request\nfrom the company whose issues are supported under the schemes. Apparently, there is no\nundertaking in such cases from the issuers to buy the securities. There is also no income\ncommensurate with the risk of loss built into these schemes, as the investor will take\nrecourse to the facilities offered under the schemes only when the market value of the\nsecurities falls below the pre-determined price.\n5.5.3 Banks/their subsidiaries should refrain from offering such \u2018Safety Net\u2019 facilities\nby whatever name called.\n5.5.4  In some cases, the issuers provide buy-back facilities to original investors upto\nRs. 40,000/- in respect of non-convertible debentures after a lock-in-period of one year to\nprovide liquidity to debentures issued by them.\n  5.5.5   If, at the request of the issuers, the banks or their subsidiaries find it necessary to\nprovide additional facilities to small investors subscribing to new issues, such buy-back\narrangements should not entail commitments to buy the securities at pre-determined\nprices. Prices should be determined from time to time, keeping in view the prevailing stock\nmarket prices for the securities. Commitments should also be limited to a moderate\nproportion of the total issue in terms of the amount and should not exceed 20 percent\nof the owned funds of the banks/their subsidiaries . These commitments will also be\nsubject to the overall exposure limits which have been or may be prescribed from time to\ntime.15Annexure 1\nMaster Circular\nExposure Norms\nList of All-India Financial Institutions\n(Counter party exposure and assignment of Risk weight- List of institutions guaranteeing\nbonds of corporates  )\n[Vide paragraph 2.3.5  & 5.1.7]\n1.

No. Plan. BC. 10/ PL-09.01/ 89-90 dated 27 July\n1989 and Paragraph No. IV.7 of the Master Circular on Lending to Priority Sector\nregarding guidelines on charging of penal interest by banks in respect of priority sector\nloans.\n2. In this connection, banks have been advised vide DBOD circular No. BP.BC. 31/\n21.04.048/ 2000-01 dated 10 October 2000, that the issue of charging penal interests that\nshould be levied for reasons such as default in repayment, non-submission of financial\nstatements etc. has been left to the Board of each bank. Banks have been advised to\nformulate policy for charging such penal interest with the approval of their Boards, to be\ngoverned by well accepted principles of transparency, fairness, incentive to service the\ndebt and due regard to difficulties of customers.\n3. The issue has been examined by us in the context of loans to borrowers under priority\nsector. It has been decided that while no penal interest should be charged by banks for\nloans under priority sector up to Rs 25,000 as hitherto, banks will be free to levy penal\ninterest for loans exceeding Rs 25,000, in terms of circular of 10 October 2000 referred to\nabove.\n4.

RPCD No.SP.BC . 13 /09.10.01/2001-02\nAugust  13, 2001\nAll Indian Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(Excluding RRBs)\nDear Sir,\nCredit facilities  to Minority Communities -  Evaluation  Study\nIn pursuance of the recommendations of the National Commission for Minorities to have\na wider assessment of the economic problems of minorities, we conducted a quick study\nthrough our Regional Offices, with a view to assessing the progress made by banks in\ngranting loans to minority communities and in implementation of our instructions on the\nsubject. (Ref. our circular No. SP.BC.43/09.10.01/96-97 dated 10, October 1996 )  The\nstudy covered all the 44 districts which have been identified as having concentration of\nminority communities (listed in annexure A) and 59 bank branches located in these\ndistricts.\n2.  A gist of the findings/conclusions of the study relevant to banks operating in these\ndistricts are given in Annexure B.  It would be seen therefrom that though loan\napplications of minority communities were generally  processed without undue/deliberate\ndelay and there were no rejection without valid reasons,  greater efforts are called for by\nthe Lead Banks in the minority concentration districts for giving a special thrust to\naccelerate the flow of credit to the minority communities.  Monitoring and review of the\ncredit flow to the minority communities also requires to be strengthened.  These issues\nshould be taken up for discussion  in SLBC/DLRC/DCC meetings especially in the\ndistricts identified as having a concentration of minority population and flow of credit\nshould be vigorously monitored.  Suitable   lecture sessions may be included in the\nrelevant training programmes for staff to   make  them   more   receptive   to   the   credit\nneeds  of    the    minority  communities.  There is also a need to create greater awareness\nof the facilities from banks available to the members of the minority communities   and\nthe Lead Banks  of  the  minority  concentration districts  will  have to make concerted\nefforts to ensure that the minority communities particularly those who  are   poor  and\nilliterate   have   access   to  bank  credit  for  taking  up productive activities by providing\npublicity to anti-poverty programmes of the Government and organising Entrepreneur\nDevelopment Programmes etc.\n3.  We shall be glad if you will please issue suitable instructions to all your controlling\noffices and branches to effectively implement the guidelines contained in our circular No.\nSP.BC.43/09.10.01/96-97 dated 10, October 1996, especially to the features listed at\nAnnexure B   which require remedial measures at branch level.\n4.

Also, the names of the\ndesignated officers in these districts should be furnished to the National Commission for\nMinorities.\nThe study revealed that an exclusive officer was nominated by the Lead Bank in only 5\ndistricts.  Lead Banks in  39 districts have not designated an officer to exclusively cater to\nthe needs of the minority borrowers.\n B)   Monitoring -  Review of progress  in the flow of credit to Minorities\na)   As per RBI instructions the progress made in flow of credit to the minority\ncommunities should be reviewed regularly at the meetings of the District  Consultative\nCommittees and  the  State Level Bankers Committees.  Further ,  the extracts from\nagenda notes and minutes of meetings of DCCs/SLBCs  of   Minority Concentration\nDistricts   should be  forwarded  to Ministry  of  Finance,  and  Ministry of Social Welfare\n(Govt. of India)  on a quarterly basis.\nAs regards DCC meetings in Minority Concentration Districts, review was made in 23\ndistricts only.\n As regards  extracts of Agenda notes/Minutes of meetings of SLBC/sDCCs,  the\nrespective Lead Banks of the Minority Concentration Districts were not forwarding  the\nsame to the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Social Welfare.\nb)  As per RBI  instructions,  Chairmen/Managing Directors or their representatives of\nState Minority Commission/Boards/Minority  Financial Corporations  should  be  invited\nto  attend  meetings  of  SLBC/SLRM   and\n DLRC  of the   Minority Concentration Districts.  The study reveals that while the\nrepresentatives of State Minority Commission were being invited for the SLBC meetings\nin most of the states having minorities concentration districts ,  such invitation was not\nbeing extended for DLRS meetings.mincir5\nC)       Training of bank staff\nAs per extant instructions, the officers and staff of banks dealing with credit should  be\ngiven necessary training regarding credit for welfare of minorities in courses such as\ninduction course, programmes on rural lending, financing of priority sector, poverty\nalleviation programmes etc.\nDuring the course of the discussions and interaction with the Lead Bank officials and\nmanagers of the branches visited for the study it was observed that most of the banks had\nnot included  specific lecture sessions on extension of bank credit to the minorities as part\nof all  relevant training programmes  like   induction  course,  programmes   on\nrural/priority  sector.\nFurther, Reserve Bank of India  instructions for  organising Entrepreneur Development\nProgrammes for the members of the minority communities to derive the benefit of various\nprogrammes  of Government being granted through banks have not been  complied with\nby banks.\nD)      Advances to Minority Communities under DRI Scheme\nAs per RBI instructions, banks may route loans under DRI scheme through State\nMinority  Finance/Development  Corporations  on  the same  terms and conditions  as are\napplicable to the loans routed through SC/ST Development Corporations  subject  to  the\nbeneficiaries  of  the corporations satisfying the eligibility criteria and other terms and\nconditions prescribed under the scheme.\nIt was observed in the study that the bank branches covered  had not received loan\napplication   forms  from   the   State   Minority   Finance/Development Corporations  for\nseeking financial assistance under DRI.\nE)   Sanction and disbursement of loans by bank branches\nWhile the study revealed that there was no deliberate delay in sanction of loan\napplications of minority communities by the branches visited the loan application register\nwas not found to have been maintained properly by some  branches.  Banks may ensure\nproper maintenance of the register to evolve timely sanction and disbursement of the loan\napplications.mincir6\nF)     Publicity\nIt is necessary to adequately  publicise the  various anti-poverty programmes of the\nGovernment wherever there is large concentration of minority communities and\nparticularly  in 44 minority concentration districts.\nThe study revealed that adequate publicity for various anti-poverty programmes of the\nGovernment was not given in most of the districts having large concentration of minority\ncommunities.\nThere is an imperative need  for concerted efforts from banks, financial institutions and\nGovernment agencies for paying focussed attention for ensuring adequate flow of bank\ncredit  to the minority communities.\n Conclusion\nThe Lead Banks of the Minority Concentration Districts will have to exercise the  pro-\nactive role expected of them to ensure that the minority communities, particularly those\nwho are poor and illiterate have access to bank credit for taking up productive activities.\nIn most of the identified districts taken up for study, special thrust for increasing the\ncredit flow to minority communities was found to be lacking in the Lead Banks.  The RBI\ninstructions in this regard viz.  designating  an officer to exclusively deal with problems\nof credit to minority communities, creating awareness of the various credit schemes\nthrough publicity, organising Entrepreneurship Development Programmes,  monitoring of\nflow of credit to minority communities at District level meetings, etc. should  be\ncomplied with.  Please ensure that steps are taken to adhere to RBI instructions and that\nthey are observed both in letter and spirit.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/23004.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Aug 13, 2001", "info": "1Annexure 1\nReport on Actual or Suspected Frauds in Banks\n[Vide paragraph 4.1.2 ( i)]\n1.Name of the bank\n2.Name of the branch\ni) Place\nii) District\niii) State\n3.Department concerned\n4.Name and nature of account\n5.Nature of fraud\ni) Misappropriation  and\ncriminal breach of trust\nii) Fraudulent encashment\nthrough forged\ninstruments/manipulation\nof books of accounts or\nthrough fictitious accounts\nand conversion of property\niii) Unauthorised credit\nfacilities extended for\nreward or for illegal\ngratification\niv) Negligence and cash\nshortages\nv) Cheating and forgery2vi) Irregularities in foreign\nexchange transactions\nvii) Others (to be mentioned)\n6.Total amount involved\n7.i) Date of occurrence\nii) Date on which detected\niii) Reasons for delay, if any,\nin detecting the fraud\niv) Date on which reported to\nRBI\nv) Reasons for delay, if any,\nin reporting the fraud to\nRBI\n8.Brief history/modus operandi\n9.Fraud committed by\ni) Internal force (staff)\nii) External force (outsiders)\niii) Internal and external\nforces (staff and outsiders)\n10.i) Whether the controlling\noffice (Regional/ Zonal)\ncould detect the fraud by a\nscrutiny of control returns\nsubmitted by the branch\nii) If not, the steps taken by\nthe bank to improve the\ninformation system311.i) The date(s) on which last\ninternal inspection/audit\nwas conducted at the\nbranch( es) during the\nperiod between the date of\nfirst occurrence of the\nfraud and its detection\nii) Whether the branch was\nunder concurrent audit\nduring the period of\noccurrence of fraud\n12.Action taken/proposed to be\ntaken\ni) Whether any complaint\nwith the Police/CBI has\nbeen lodged.

Frauds perpetrated in banks show an increasing trend mainly\non account of non-adherence/improper implementation of various guidelines.\n1.2 The primary responsibility for preventing frauds is that of bank managements.\nReserve Bank of India, on its part, has been advising banks from time to time\nabout the major fraud prone areas and the safeguards necessary for their\nprevention. Various guidelines/ instructions issued from time to time were also\ncompiled in a Compendium of Instructions up to December 1995 and supplied to\nbanks along with circular No.DOS.317/23.11.001/96 dated 9 September 1996.\n1.3 Reserve Bank of India has also been circulating to banks details of frauds of\ningenious nature which come to its notice so that individual banks could introduce\nnecessary safeguards by means of appropriate procedures and internal checks\nhaving regard to the modus operandi of the frauds.\n1.4 For the purpose, it is very important that Reserve Bank of India receives full\ninformation about the incidence of frauds and the action taken by the banks to\nprevent them.\n1.5 In order to enable both the Government of India and Reserve Bank of India to\nhave required information on frauds, suitable reporting system has been\nintroduced which is detailed hereunder.2.TIMELY DETECTION AND REPORTING\n2.1 It has been observed that very often frauds are detected in banks only long\nafter their perpetration, thus allowing the fraud to continue for a long time. The\nEstimates Committee of Parliament also has observed that in spite of the existence\nof various control systems and arrangements to supervise the working of branches\nof banks through internal and external inspections/audits, vigilance machinery,\netc., a number of frauds perpetrated are not detected during the course of\ninspection/audit.\n2.2 It is also observed that in some cases, the fraud reports are submitted to\nReserve Bank of India with considerable delay and many a time without adequate\ninformation. The reasons for delay in detection and in reporting are also not\nclearly stated in the fraud reports. On certain occasions, Reserve Bank of India\ncomes to know about frauds involving large amounts only through press reports.\nThis happens due to non-reporting of frauds by banks immediately on their\ndetection.\n2.3 Banks must examine the reasons for delay in reporting of frauds to Reserve\nBank of India and ensure that the reporting system is suitably streamlined so that\nfrauds are reported without any delay.\nBanks must fix staff accountability in respect of delays in reporting of\nfrauds to Reserve Bank of India.\n3.CLASSIFICATION OF FRAUDS\n3.1 In order to have uniformity in reporting cases of frauds, the question of\nclassification of bank frauds on the basis of the provisions of the Indian Penal\nCode has been considered and frauds have been classified as under:\n(i) Misappropriation and criminal breach of trust.\n(ii) Fraudulent encashment through forged instruments, manipulation of\nbooks of account or through fictitious accounts and conversion of\nproperty.\n(iii) Unauthorised credit facilities extended for reward or for illegal\ngratification.\n(iv) Negligence and cash shortages.\n(v) Cheating and forgery.\n(vi) Irregularities in foreign exchange transactions.\n(vii) Any other type of fraud not coming under the specific heads as above.\n3.2 Cases of 'negligence and cash shortages' referred to in item (iv) above are to\nbe reported as frauds if the intention to cheat/defraud is suspected/proved.3.3 Cases of theft and burglary should not be reported as frauds. All cases of theft,\nburglary, dacoity and robbery may be reported separately as detailed in paragraph\n8.\n4.REPORTING OF FRAUDS\n4.1 Reporting of actual or suspected frauds\n4.1.1 Frauds involving amounts up to Rs. 1 lakh\n(i) The cases of individual frauds involving amounts up to Rs. 1\nlakh each are not to be reported individually as and when such\nfrauds come to banks' notice.\n(ii) Banks should report such frauds in a consolidated form\ncategory-wise on a quarterly basis as detailed in paragraph 5.3.\n4.1.2 Frauds involving amounts in excess of Rs. 1 lakh\n(i) To enable Reserve Bank of India to have immediate information on\nall actual or suspected frauds in excess of Rs. 1 lakh each, banks\nshould report to Reserve Bank of India full details of frauds, as soon as\nsuch frauds come to their notice but within three weeks of detection, in\nthe format given in Annexure  1 (in duplicate) as under:\nReport in duplicate to be submitted to the Department of Banking\nSupervision (DBS) at the respective Regional Office of the RBI under\nwhose jurisdiction the Head Office of the bank falls.\nA copy of the fraud report should also be submitted to the Regional\nOffice of RBI in whose area the branch of the bank at which the fraud\nis perpetrated, is functioning.\n(ii) Report to the Board\n(a) Banks should ensure that all major frauds involving Rs. 1 lakh and\nabove are reported to their Board of Directors promptly on their\ndetection.\n(b) While examining such cases, it is absolutely essential to take note of\nthe failure on the part of the concerned branch officials, as well as\ncontrolling authorities, and initiate appropriate action against the\nofficials responsible for causing the fraud or loss.\n(c) A copy of the note put up to the Board may also be sent promptly to\nthe Chief General Manager, Department of Banking Supervision,\nReserve Bank of India, Central Office, World Trade Centre, Mumbai \u2013\n400 005.\n(iii) Clarifications for reporting of actual/ suspected frauds\n(a) The report should include instances where banks have been put to loss\nthrough misrepresentation, breach of trust, manipulation of books of\naccount, fraudulent encashment  of instruments like cheques , drafts andbills of exchange, unauthorised  handling of securities charged to the\nbank, misfeasance, embezzlement, misappropriation of funds,\nconversion of property, cheating, shortages, irregularities, etc.\n(b) Cases of attempted frauds need not be reported to Reserve Bank of\nIndia in the above format but may be done by way of a letter ( para\n4.1.6).\n(c) Banks should ensure that in the fraud reports, 'brief history/ modus\noperandi' is presented concisely avoiding vague and generalised terms.\n(d) Frauds perpetrated on subsidiaries and affiliates/joint ventures\nfunctioning both in India and abroad may be treated by banks\nincorporated in India on par with those of their branches and may be\nreported in the above prescribed format as and when detected.\n(e) Public sector banks having overseas branches/offices should report all\nfrauds perpetrated at their overseas branches to the Regional Office of\nReserve Bank of India under whose jurisdiction the Head Office of the\nbank falls.\n4.1.3 Frauds Involving amounts of Rs. 5 lakh and above\n(i) Banks should report to Reserve Bank of India by means of a D.O.\nletter addressed to the Chief General Manager in-charge of\nDepartment of Banking Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, Central\nOffice, all cases of frauds involving Rs. 5 lakh and above within a\nweek or / after such frauds coming to the notice of the bank\u2019s Head\nOffice.\n(ii) For this purpose, banks may issue suitable instructions to their\ncontrolling offices and branches to furnish the requisite information\nrelating to the frauds to the controlling/Head Office immediately on\ndetection.\n(iii) The above D.O. letter may contain brief particulars such as the names\nof parties

Where the existing level of exposure as on\nOctober 31, 1999  is more than 20 percent, banks should reduce the exposure\nto 20 percent of capital funds over two year period i.e. by end October 2001.\n(cf. para (ii) of circular 2 at Appendix B).\n2.1.3  Credit exposure to borrowers belonging to a group may exceed the exposure\nnorm of 50 percent of the bank\u2019s capital funds by an additional 10 percent (i.e.\nupto 60 percent) , provided the additional credit exposure is on account of\nextension of credit to infrastructure projects  (i.e. power, telecommunication,\nroads and ports).22.1.4 Lending under Consortium Arrangements\nThe exposure limits will be applicable to lending under consortium\narrangements, wherever formalised.32.2 Exemptions\n2.2.1 Rehabilitation of Sick/Weak Industrial Units\nThe above ceilings on single/group exposure limits would not be applicable to\nexisting/additional credit facilities (including funding of interest and\nirregularities) granted to weak/sick industrial units under rehabilitation\npackages.\n2.2.2 Food credit\nBorrowers to  whom limits are allocated directly by the Reserve Bank, for food\ncredit, will be exempt from the ceiling.\n2.3 Definitions\n2.3.1 Capital Funds\nCapital funds for the purpose will comprise paid-up capital and free reserves as\nper the published accounts  as on 31st   March of the previous year Reserves, if\nany, created by way of revaluation of fixed assets etc. may be excluded for the\npurpose.\n2.3.2 In the case of foreign banks , the components of capital funds are defined as\nunder:\n(a) Tier I & II capital (excluding revaluation reserves) as on 31 March of the\nprevious year. Average outstanding foreign currency loans granted to Indian\ncompanies by the foreign banks and their wholly owned subsidiaries at the end\nof each month during the previous year ended March.\n(cf. para 2 & 3 of circular 9 at Appendix B).\n(b) Average monthly outstanding for the previous year ended 31st March under the\nlines of credit granted to banks in India under PCFC and other schemes\napproved by the  RBI.\n(c) Average monthly outstandings for the previous year ended 31st March under\nthe foreign currency line of credit granted by the Head Office/other offices of\nthe bank to the Indian branch under PCFC and other schemes approved by the\nRBI.\n2.3.2 Exposure\nExposure shall include credit exposure ( funded and non-funded credit limits)\nand investment exposure ( underwriting  and similar commitments ) as well as\ncertain types of investments in companies. The sanctioned limits or\noutstandings, whichever are higher, shall be reckoned for arriving at exposure\nlimit. However, in respect of non-funded credit limits, only 50 percent of such\nlimits or outstandings, whichever is higher , need be taken into account for the\npurpose.\n2.3.4 Credit exposure  comprises of the following elements:\n(a) all types of funded and non-funded credit limits.\n(b) facilities extended by way of equipment leasing, hire purchase finance and\nfactoring services.4(cf. para (iii) of circular 10 at Appendix B).\n(c) advances against shares, debentures, bonds, units of mutual funds, etc. to stock\nbrokers, market makers.\n(d) bank loan for financing promoters contributions.\n(e) bridge loans against equity flows/issues.\nInvestments\n2.3.5Investments comprise the following elements:\n(a) investments in shares and debentures of companies acquired through direct\nsubscription, devolvement arising out of underwriting obligations or purchase\nfrom secondary markets or on conversion of debt into equity, shall be reckoned\nfor arriving at single borrower/group borrower exposure limit.\n(b) investment in PSU bonds through direct subscription, devolvement arising out\nof underwriting obligations or purchase made in the secondary market, shall be\nreckoned for arriving at single borrower/group borrower exposure limit.\n(c) investments in Commercial Papers (CPs) issued by Corporate Bodies/PSUs\nshall be reckoned for arriving at single borrower/group borrower exposure limit.\n(d) investment made by the banks in bonds and debentures of corporates which are\nguaranteed by a PFI (as per list given in Annexure 1 ) will be treated as an\nexposure by the bank on the PFI and not on the corporate.\n(cf. para 7 of circular 4 at Appendix B).\n2.3.6Loans and advances granted against the security of bank\u2019s own term deposits\nmay be excluded from the purview of the exposure ceiling.\nGroup\n2.3.7 The concept of 'Group' and the task of identification of the borrowers belonging\nto specific industrial groups is left to the perception of the banks/financial\ninstitutions. Banks/financial institutions are generally aware of the basic\nconstitution of their clientele for the purpose of regulating their exposure to risk\nassets. The group to which a particular borrowing unit belongs, may, therefore,\nbe decided by them on the basis of the relevant information available with them,\nthe guiding principle being commonality of management and effective control.\n2.3.8For identifying the group to which a comp any registered under Section 26(2) of\nMRTP Act, 1969 belongs, a reference may be made to the Industrial House-\nwise list of companies registered under the Act. The relative list is given in\nAnnexure 2 .\n2.3.9 In respect of borrowers not covered by the MRTP Act, the group affiliation may\nbe decided by banks on the basis of the principle explained above.\n(cf. para 3 of circular 13 at Appendix B).\n2.3.10 In the case of a split in the group, if the split is formalised, the splinter groups\nwill be regarded as separate groups. If banks and financial institutions have\ndoubts about the bona fides  of the split, a reference may be made to RBI for its\nfinal view in the matter to preclude the possibility of a split being engineered in\norder to prevent coverage under the Group Approach.5(cf. para ii  of circular 12 at Appendix B).\n2.4 Review\n2.4.1 An annual review of the implementation of exposure management measures\nmay be placed before the Board of Directors before the end of June and a copy\neach of such review may be furnished for information to the Chief General\nManager, Department of Banking Operations and Development, Reserve Bank\nof India, World Trade Centre, Mumbai and to the concerned Regional Offices\nof DBOD.\n3. Credit exposure to industry or certain sectors\n3.1 Internal Exposure Limits\n3.1.1 Specific Sectors\nApart from limiting the exposures to individual or Group of borrowers, as\nindicated above, the banks may also consider fixing internal limits for aggregate\ncommitments to specific sectors e.g. textiles, jute, tea, etc. so that the exposures\nare evenly spread over various sectors. These limits could be fixed by the banks\nhaving regard to the performance of different sectors and the risks perceived.\nThe limits so fixed may be reviewed periodically and revised, as necessary.\n3.1.2 Exposure to Real Estate\nBanks should frame comprehensive prudential norms relating to the ceiling on\nthe total amount of real estate loans, single/group exposure limits for such loans,\nmargins, security, repayment schedule and availability of supplementary finance\nand the policy should be approved by the bank's Board.\n3.1.3While framing the bank's policy, the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank\nshould be taken into account. Banks should ensure that the bank credit is used\nfor productive construction activity and not for activity connected with\nspeculation in real estate.\n3.2 Exposure to Leasing, Hire Purchase and Factoring Services\n3.2.1 Banks should maintain a balanced portfolio of equipment leasing, hire purchase\nand factoring services vis-\u00e0-vis the aggregate credit. Their exposure to each of\nthese activities should not exceed 10 percent of total advances.\n(cf. para iv of circular 10 at Appendix B).\n3.3 Exposure to Indian Joint Ventures/Wholly-owned Subsidiaries Abroad\n3.3.1 Banks are allowed to extend credit/non-credit facilities (viz. letters of credit and\nguarantees) to Indian Joint Ventures/Wholly-owned Subsidiaries abroad. Banks\nare also permitted to provide at their discretion, buyer's credit/acceptance\nfinance to overseas parties for facilitating export of goods & services from\nIndia.63.3.2 The above exposure will, however, be subject to a limit of 5 percent  of the\nunimpaired Tier I capital . Higher limits could be considered by the Reserve\nBank on merits.\n(cf. para 1 of circular 1 at Appendix B).\n3.3.3 While extending such facilities, banks will have to, inter alia , comply with\nSection 25 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, in terms of which the assets in\nIndia of every banking company at the close of business on the last Friday of\nevery quarter shall not be less than 75 percent of its demand and time liabilities in\nIndia. In other words, aggregate assets outside India should not exceed 25\npercent of the bank's demand and time liabilities in India .\n(cf. para 1(iii) of circular 1 at Appendix B).\n3.3.4The banks should also comply with all existing saf eguards/prudential guidelines\nrelating to capital adequacy, and exposure norms indicated in paragraph 2.1, ibid.\n3.4 Exposure Limits on Advances against Shares and Holding of Shares as\nInvestments*\n*[For detailed instructions please see Master Circular dated August 28, 1998 on\nBank Finance against Shares and Debentures.]\n3.4.1 Statutory Limit on Shareholding in Companies\nIn terms of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, no banking\ncompany shall hold shares in any company, whether as pledgee , mortgagee  or\nabsolute owner , of an amount exceeding 30 percent of the paid-up share capital\nof that company or 30 percent of its own paid-up share capital and reserves,\nwhichever is less, except as provided in sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Act.\nShares held in demat form should also be included for the purpose of\ndetermining the exposure limit. This is an aggregate holding limit for each\ncompany .\n3.4.2   While granting any advance against shares, underwriting an issue of shares, or\nacquiring any shares on investment account or even in lieu of debt of any\ncompany, these statutory provisions should be strictly observed.\n(cf. annexure to  circular 5 at Appendix B).\n3.4.3Regulatory Limits\nThere is also a regulatory stipulation that bank's aggregate investment in shares,\nconvertible debentures, bonds, etc. should not exceed 5 percent of their\nincremental deposits of the previous year. Certain types of loans and advances\nagainst shares are also treated as banks' investment in shares for the purpose of\nobserving this ceiling. Therefore, loans and advances against shares for\nspecified purposes are to be clubbed with banks' investments in shares,\nconvertible debentures, bonds, etc. and the ceiling stipulation of 5 percent is to\nbe complied with. The details are given in para 5 below.\n3.4.4Advances against Shares to Individuals7Loans at all the offices of a bank, against the security of shares, debentures and\nPSU bonds to individuals, if held in physical form should not exceed the limit\nof Rs. 10 lakhs per borrower (individual) with margin of 50%.\n3.4.5If the securities are held in demat form, the loans at all the offices of a bank,\nshould not exceed the limit of Rs. 20 lakhs per borrower (individual) with\nmargin of 25%.\n3.4.6 Banks should formulate with the approval of their Boards the Lending Policy\nfor grant of advances to individuals against shares, debentures, bonds keeping in\nview RBI guidelines. As a prudential measure, the banks may also consider\nlaying down appropriate limits of such advances .\n(cf. para 3(ii), 3(iii) and 3(iv) of circular 5  at Appendix B).\n3.4.7 Advances against units of Mutual funds\nAdvances against units of mutual funds including units of Unit-64 scheme\nwould attract the quantum and margin requirements as applicable to advances\nagainst shares and debentures wherever stipulated.\n3.4.8Bank finance to employees to buy shares of their own companies\nBanks may provide finance to employees of companies to buy shares of their\nown companies. The advance may be granted upto 90 percent of the purchase\nprice of the shares but not exceeding Rs. 50,000/- or six months' salary of the\nemployees, whichever is less.\n3.4.9Advances against Shares to Stock Brokers and Market Makers\nBanks should lay down a detailed loan policy for granting advances to Stock\nBrokers and Market Makers and also a policy for grant of guarantees on behalf\nof brokers which should keep in view the maximum exposure  for individual\ncredits within the prescribed prudential single borrower limit as detailed in\nparagraph 2.1.1 ibid. The Board may also consider laying down a limit on\nthe aggregate exposures of the bank to this sector .\n3.5Bank Loans for Financing Promoters Contributions\n3.5.1 Loans sanctioned to corporates against the security of shares (as far as possible\ndemat shares) for meeting promoter's contribution to the equity of new\ncompanies in anticipation of raising resources, should be treated as bank's\ninvestments in shares which would thus come under the ceiling of 5 percent  of\nthe incremental deposits of the previous year prescribed for investments in\nshares/convertible debentures of PSUs, corporate bodies, and units of mutual\nfund schemes.\n(cf. para (v)of circular 7 at Appendix B).\n3.5.2 These loans will also be subject to individual/group of borrowers exposure\nnorms detailed in paragraph 2.1.1, ibid.\n3.5.3 These loans will also be subject to statutory limit  on shareholding in companies\ndetailed in paragraph 3.4.1 above.\n3.5.4   Under the refinance scheme of Export Import Bank of India, the bank may\nsanction term loans on merits for eligible Indian promoters for acquisition of8equity in overseas joint ventures/ wholly owned subsidiaries, provided the term\nloans have been approved by the EXIM Bank for refinance.\n3.6Bridge Loans\n3.6.1  Banks have been permitted to sanction bridge loans to companies for a period not\nexceeding one year against expected equity flows/issues. Such loans should be\nincluded within the ceiling of 5 percent of incremental deposits of the previous\nyear for bank's investments in ordinary shares, convertible debentures of\ncorporates including PSU shares, loans to corporates for meeting promoters\ncontributions and in units of mutual fund schemes the corpus of which is not\nexclusively invested in corporate debt instruments.\n3.6.2   Banks should formulate their own internal guidelines with the approval of their\nBoard of Directors for grant of such loans, exercising due caution and attention\nto security for such loans.\n3.6.3   Banks may also extend bridge loans against the expected proceeds of Non-\nConvertible Debentures, External Commercial Borrowings, Global Depository\nReceipts and/or funds in the nature of Foreign Direct Investments, provided the\nbank is satisfied that the borrowing company has already made firm\narrangements for raising the aforesaid resources/funds.\n4. Exposure to unsecured guarantees and unsecured advances\n4.1.1Banks have to limit their commitment by way of unsecured guarantees in such a\nmanner that 20 percent of the bank\u2019s outstanding unsecured guarantees plus the\ntotal of outstanding unsecured advances do not exceed 15 percent of total\noutstanding advances. Guarantees counter-guaranteed by another bank need not\nbe taken into account for the purpose of the norm.\n(cf. para 1 & 2 of circular 15 and para 4(iii) of circular. 18  at Appendix B).\n4.1.2  For the purpose of conforming to the above norm, guarantees covered by\ncounter-guarantees of the Central Government and the State Governments,\npublic sector financial institutions and insurance companies will be regarded as\nsecured guarantees.\n(cf. para 4(iv) of  circular 18 at Appendix B).\n4.1.3 However, deferred payment guarantees should be backed by adequate tangible\nsecurity or by counter-guarantees of the Central Government or the State\nGovernments or public sector financial institutions, or by counter-guarantees of\ninsurance companies or other banks, provided the counter-guarantees of\ninsurance companies or other banks are themselves backed by adequate tangible\nsecurity. Where the counter-guarantees by commercial banks are backed by\nadequate tangible securities, then all guarantees, including deferred payment\nguarantees, will be treated as secured guarantees.\n4.1.4 In exceptional cases, the banks may give deferred payment guarantees on an\nunsecured basis for modest amounts to first class customers who have entered\ninto deferred payment arrangements in consonance with Government policy.\nBut such unsecured guarantees should be accommodated within the maximum\nceiling limits.9(cf.  instructions in para 4(iv) of circular 18 at Appendix B).\n5. Exposure norms for investments\n5.1 Banks' Investments in Shares, Debentures and Bonds\n5.1.1 Banks are allowed to invest in the -\n\u2022 ordinary shares of corporate bodies including other banks,\n\u2022 shares of public sector undertakings, and\n\u2022 convertible debentures of corporate bodies including other banks,\nsubject to a ceiling of 5 percent  of their incremental deposits of the\nprevious year. The banks are required to adhere to the ceiling on an\nongoing basis  and should exercise care to see that the limit is not\nexceeded.\n5.1.2 The investment ceiling includes  -\n\u2022 investments by banks in the subordinated debts of other banks.\n\u2022 units of Mutual Fund schemes the corpus of which is not exclusively\ninvested in corporate debt.\n\u2022 bank finance for financing promoters contribution towards equity capital\nof new companies.\n\u2022 bridge loans to companies.\n5.1.3 The investment ceiling excludes  investments in -\n\u2022 preference shares,\n\u2022 non-convertible debentures/bonds of private corporate bodies,\n\u2022 equities/bonds of All-India Financial Institutions (as per list given in\nAnnexure 3 ),\n\u2022 bonds issued by Public Sector Undertakings,\n\u2022 units of Mutual Funds under schemes where corpus is invested exclusively\nin debt instruments,\n\u2022 venture capital including units of dedicated venture capital funds meant for\nInformation Technology, and\n\u2022 investments in Certificate of Deposits (CDs) of other banks/ financial\ninstitutions.\n5.1.4 Investments in shares and debentures/bonds, included in the 5 percent ceiling on\ninvestments or excluded from the ceiling, are to be reckoned for the purpose of\narriving at the prudential norm of credit exposure for single borrower and group\nof borrowers as stipulated in paragraph 2.1.1 above.\n5.1.5 The investments will include the acquisition through -10\u2022 direct subscription,\n\u2022 private placements,\n\u2022 secondary markets, or\n\u2022 holdings through devolvement of underwriting obligations.\n5.1.6Purchase of shares and debentures in the secondary market (other than inter-\nbank transactions) should be only through recognised stock exchanges and\nregistered stock brokers.\nBank's Investment in the Bonds of a Corporate\n5.1.7  For the purpose of calculation of exposure norm, investments made by the banks\nin bonds and debentures of corporates which are guaranteed by a PFI, as per list\ngiven in Annexure 1 , will be treated as an exposure by the bank on the PFI and\nnot on the corporate.\n(cf. para 7 of circular. 4 at Appendix B).\n5.1.8   Guarantees issued by the PFI to the bonds of corporates will be treated as an\nexposure by the PFI to the corporates to the extent of 50 percent being a non-\nfund facility, whereas the exposure of the bank on the PFI guaranteeing the\ncorporate bond will be 100 percent.\n5.1.9  The PFI before guaranteeing the bonds/debentures should, however, take into\naccount the overall exposure of the guaranteed unit to the financial system.\nExposure Limit on Shareholding in Companies\n5.1.10 As indicated in paragraph 3.4.1 above, bank's investments in shares inclusive of\nlendings against shares have also to be subjected to statutory provisions\ncontained in Section 19(2) whereby the aggregate holding  in a company should\nnot exceed 30 percent of the company's paid-up capital or 30 percent of the\nbank's paid-up capital and reserves, whichever is less.\nBank's Investment in Venture Capital\n5.1.11 In order to encourage the flow of finance for venture capital, the bank's\ninvestment in venture capital (including units of dedicated Venture Capital\nFunds meant for Information Technology) would be over and above the ceiling\nof 5 percent of incremental deposits of the previous year prescribed for\ninvestment in equity shares including PSU shares, convertible debentures of\ncorporates and in units of Mutual Fund schemes, the corpus of which is not\nexclusively invested in corporate debt instruments. This would, however, be\nsubject to the condition that the venture capital funds/companies are registered\nwith SEBI.\n(cf. para 2 (iv) of circular. 1 at Appendix B).\nBanks' Investment in Subordinated Debt Instruments\n5.1.12 A high level of cross holding of subordinated debt instruments (issued by banks\nand financial institutions to raise Tier II capital) among banks and financial\ninstitutions, does not necessarily lead to accretion of capital to the financial\nsystem. As such, a bank's investment in Tier II bonds issued by other banks and11financial institutions shall be permitted upto 10 percent  of the investing bank's\ntotal capital. The total capital for this purpose will be same as that reckoned for\nthe purpose of capital adequacy.\n(cf. para 2(ii) of circular. 1 at Appendix B).\n5.1.13 Investments by banks in the subordinated debts of other banks shall also be\nsubject to the ceiling of 5 percent  applicable to investments in shares and\ndebentures of corporate bodies.\n5.2Underwriting of Corporate Shares and Debentures\n5.2.1Generally, there are demands on the banks for underwriting the issues of shares\nand debentures. In order to ensure that there is no over exposure to underwriting\ncommitments to earn fees, the Reserve Bank has laid down the following\nguidelines which the banks should strictly follow:\n5.2.2The statutory provision contained in Section 19(2) & (3) of the Banki ng\nRegulation Act, 1949 regarding holding of shares in any company as\npledgee/mortgagee or absolute owner, should be strictly adhered to.\n5.2.3The banks have to ensure that the shares/debentures including PSU equities and\nshares of other banks, Mutual Funds (the corpus of which is not exclusively\ninvested in corporate debt instruments), and units of UTI subscribed and/or\ndevolving on them as a part of their underwriting obligations in any particular\nyear do not exceed 5 percent of their incremental deposits of the previous year.\n5.2.4It may be noted that the limit placed is on the shares and debentures that may be\nheld in the bank\u2019s own portfolio as a result of devolvement and not on the\namount of underwriting that the bank may engage in. Normally, the amount of\nunderwriting is a multiple of the amount which devolves finally.\n5.2.5The banks are required to adhere to the ceiling of 5 percent of incremental\ndeposits of previous year on an ongoing basis. Banks should exercise care to see\nthat the limit is not exceeded.\n(cf. para 2 of circular. 16 at Appendix B).\n5.2.6The ceiling of 5 percent does not include investments in preference shares and\nnon-convertible debentures/bonds of private corporate bodies. The ceiling\nexcludes investment in venture capital including units of dedicated venture\ncapital funds meant for Information Technology.\n5.2.7The ceiling excludes investments in units of Mutual Funds under schemes where\nthe corpus is invested exclusively in debt instruments.\n5.2.8Investments including under writing devolvements in equities/bonds issued by\nthe All India Financial Institutions, mentioned in Annexure 1 , would be outside\nthe ceiling of 5 percent prescribed for investments in shares (including PSU\nequities) and debentures of corporate bodies.\n5.2.9The underwriting exposure to any company which will include other funded and\nnon-funded credit limits should not exceed 20 percent of capital funds of the bank\nin the case of a single company and 50 percent (upto 60 percent, provided the\nadditional credit exposure is on account of extention of credit to infrastructure12project) in the case of group of companies. The non-funded limits may be taken at\n50 percent of the limit or outstandings, whichever is higher.\n5.2.10While taking up underwriting commitment s, banks or their subsidiaries, should\nensure that the aggregate of such commitments are included in the exposure\nlimits fixed by the Reserve Bank.\n(cf. para 2 (a)of circular. 11 at Appendix B).\n5.2.11In the case of underwriting, the commitments under a single obligation should\nbe fixed taking into account the owned funds of banks or their subsidiaries and\nthe capacity to meet the commitments that may devolve and should not in any\ncase exceed 15 percent of an issue.\n5.2.12Banks should consider sub-underw riting for every underwritten issue so as to\nminimise chances of devolution on their own account. This is not mandatory.\nThe need for and extent of such sub-underwriting is a matter of the bank\u2019s\ndiscretion.\n5.2.13As part of merchant banking activities, w hile taking up underwriting\nobligations, banks should carefully evaluate the proposals so as to ensure that\nthe issues will have adequate public response and the prospect of devolution of\nsuch shares/debentures on the underwriting banks will be minimal.\n5.2.14Banks should ensure that the portfolio is diversified and that no unduly large\nunderwriting obligations are taken up in the shares and debentures of a company\nor a group of companies. Banks should make enquiries regarding the other\nunderwriters and their capacity to fulfil the obligations.\n5.2.15Banks should formulate within the above parameters, their own internal\nguidelines as approved by their Boards of Directors on investments in corporate\nshares/debentures of companies or group of companies including norms to\nensure that excessive investment in any single company is avoided and that due\nattention is given to the maturity structure and quality of such investments.\n5.3     Prohibition on underwriting operations\n5.3.1Banks should not underwrite issu e of Commercial Paper by any Company,\nPrimary Dealer or Satellite Dealer.\n5.3.2Banks should not extend Revolving Underwriting Facility to short-term\nFloating Rate Notes/Bonds or debentures issued by corporate entities.\n5.3.3   An annual review covering the underwriting operations taken up during the year,\nwith company-wise details of such operations, the shares/debentures devolved\non the banks, the loss (or expected loss) from unloading the devolved\nshares/debentures indicating the face-value and market value thereof, the\ncommission earned, etc. may be placed before their Boards of Directors within\n2 months of the close of the fiscal year.\n(cf. para 2 of circular. 16 at Appendix B).\n5.4 Underwriting of bonds of Public Sector Undertakings\n5.4.1  Banks can play a useful role in relation to issue of bonds by public sector\nundertaking by underwriting a part of these issues.135.4.2   However, it should be kept in view that the major responsibility of the banks is\nto meet the growing credit needs, especially of working capital of industrial,\nexport and priority sectors. This should not be lost sight of by the banks while\nundertaking new activities.\n5.4.3  Banks should subject the proposals for underwriting to proper scrutiny having\nregard to all the relevant factors and accept such commitments only on well\nreasoned commercial considerations with the approval of the appropriate\nauthority.\n5.4.4  With a view to enabling the banks to deploy their surplus funds more\nremuneratively, the banks will have the freedom to acquire PSU bonds\nincluding through underwriting devolvements without any ceiling .\n5.4.5 However, the banks should formulate their own internal guidelines as approved\nby their Boards of Directors on investments in and underwriting of PSU bonds,\nincluding norms to ensure that excessive investment in any single PSU is\navoided and that due attention is given to the maturity structure of such\ninvestments. Banks would also need to take into account that such investments\nare subject to risk weight and necessary depreciation has to be fully provided for.\n5.4.6  Further, such investments in PSU bonds including shares and debentures and\nsubscription to Commercial Papers of PSUs should be reckoned for the purpose\nof arriving at prudential norms of credit exposure for single borrower and group\nof borrowers.\n5.4.7 Banks should undertake an annual review of the underwriting operations relating\nto bonds of the public sector undertakings, with PSU-wise details of such\noperations, bonds devolved on the banks, the loss (or expected loss) from\nunloading the devolved bonds indicating the face-value and market value\nthereof, the commission earned, etc. and place the same to their Boards of\nDirectors within two months from the close of the fiscal year.\n(cf. para 1 of circular 14 at Appendix B).\n5.5'Safety Net' Schemes for Public Issues of Shares, Debentures, etc.\n5.5.1  Reserve Bank has observed that some banks/their subsidiaries are providing buy-\nback facilities under the name of \u2018Safety Net\u2019 Schemes in respect of certain\npublic issues as part of their merchant banking activities. Under such schemes,\nlarge exposures are assumed by way of commitments to buy the relative\nsecurities from the original investors at any time during a stipulated period at a\nprice determined at the time of issue, irrespective of the prevailing market price.\n5.5.2  In some cases, such schemes are being offered suo motto  without any request\nfrom the company whose issues are supported under the schemes. Apparently,\nthere is no undertaking in such cases from the issuers to buy the securities. There\nis also no income commensurate with the risk of loss built into these schemes, as\nthe investor will take recourse to the facilities offered under the schemes only\nwhen the market value of the securities falls below the pre-determined price.\n5.5.3 Banks/their subsidiaries should refrain from offering such \u2018Safety Net\u2019 facilities\nby whatever name called.145.5.4  In some cases, the issuers provide buy-back facilities to original investors upto\nRs. 40,000/- in respect of non-convertible debentures after a lock-in-period of\none year to provide liquidity to debentures issued by them.\n5.5.5   If, at the request of the issuers, the banks or their subsidiaries find it necessary to\nprovide additional facilities to small investors subscribing to new issues, such\nbuy-back arrangements should not entail commitments to buy the securities\nat pre-determined prices . Prices should be determined from time to time,\nkeeping in view the prevailing stock market prices for the securities.\nCommitments should also be limited to a moderate proportion of the total\nissue in terms of the amount and should not exceed 20 percent of the owned\nfunds of the banks/their subsidiaries . These commitments will also be subject\nto the overall exposure limits which have been or may be prescribed from time\nto time.15Annexure 1\nMaster Circular\nExposure Norms\nList of All-India Financial Institutions\n(Counter party exposure and assignment of Risk weight- List of institutions guaranteeing bond\ns of corporates  )\n[Vide paragraph 2.3.5  & 5.1.7]\n1.

Sardesai)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge2LENDING TO PRIORITY SECTOR\nAt a meeting of the National Credit Council held in July 1968, it was emphasised that\ncommercial banks should increase their involvement in the financing of priority sectors, viz.,\nagriculture and small scale industries. The description of the priority sectors was later\nformalised in 1972 on the basis of the report submitted by the Informal Study Group on\nStatistics relating to advances to the Priority Sectors constituted by the Reserve Bank in May\n1971. On the basis of this report, the Reserve Bank prescribed a modified return for reporting\npriority sector advances and certain guidelines were issued in this connection indicating the\nscope of the items to be included under the various categories of priority sectors. Although\ninitially there was no specific targets fixed in respect of priority sector lending, in November\n1974 the banks were advised to raise the share of these sectors in their aggregate advances to\nthe level of 331/ 3  percent by March 1979.\nAt a meeting of the Union Finance Minister with the Chief Executive Officers of public sector\nbanks held in March 1980, it was agreed that banks should aim at raising the proportion of\ntheir advances to priority sectors to 40 percent by March 1985. Subsequently, on the basis of\nthe recommendations of the Working Group on the Modalities of Implementation of Priority\nSector Lending and the Twenty Point Economic Programme by Banks, all commercial banks\nwere advised to achieve the target of priority sector lending at 40 percent of aggregate bank\nadvances by 1985. Sub-targets were also specified for lending to agriculture and the weaker\nsections within the priority sector. Since then, there have been several changes in the scope of\npriority sector lending and the targets and sub-targets applicable to various bank groups.\nAt present, the priority sector broadly comprises the following :\n(i) Agriculture\n(ii) Small Scale Industries\n(iii) Other activities / borrowers (such as small business, retail trade, small transport\noperators, professional and self employed persons, housing, education loans, microcredit\netc.)\nSECTION  I\nCLASSIFICATION OF PRIORITY SECTOR ADVANCES\nDetailed classification containing the list of items in different segments of priority sector\nadvances is given below.\n1.

MAIN TARGETS FOR ALL SCHEDULED COMMERCIAL BANKS EXCLUDING\nFOREIGN BANKS\n1.1 The scheduled commercial banks are expected to enlarge credit to priority sector and\nensure that priority sector advances constitute 40 percent of net bank credit and that a\nsubstantial portion is directed to the weaker sections.\n1.2 Within the overall main lending target of 40 percent of net bank credit, it should be\nensured that:\n(i) 18 percent of net bank credit goes to agricultural sector,\n(ii) 10 percent of net bank credit is given to the \u2018weaker sections\u2019 and\n(iii) 1 percent of previous year\u2019s net bank credit is given under the\nDifferential Rate of Interest ( DRI) scheme.\n2. SUB-TARGETS FOR ALL SCHEDULED COMMERCIAL BANKS EXCLUDING\nFOREIGN BANKS\n2.1  Direct/ Indir/ect Agricultural Lending\n(i) Taking into consideration the fact that ultimate objective of agricultural credit\nwhether 'direct' or 'indirect' is to help the agricultural production, the lendings under the\n'direct' and 'indirect' categories of agricultural advances will be clubbed for the purpose\nof computing performance of banks vis-\u00e0-vis the sub-target of 18 percent.\n(ii) however, to ensure that the focus of the banks on the direct category of\nagricultural advances does not get diluted; the lendings under the indirect category\nshould not exceed one-fourth of the agricultural sub-target of 18 percent, i.e. 4.5\npercent of net bank credit.\n(iii) Advances under the 'indirect' category in excess of 4.5 percent of net bank\ncredit would not be reckoned in computing performance under the sub-target of 18\npercent. However, all agricultural advances under the categories 'direct' and 'indirect'14will be reckoned in computing performance under the overall priority sector target of\n40 percent of the net bank credit.\n2.2  Small Scale Industries\nIn order to ensure that credit is available to all segments of the SSI sector, banks should\nensure that -\n(a) 40 percent of the total credit to small scale industry goes to the cottage\nindustries, khadi & village industries, artisans and tiny industries with\ninvestment in plant and machinery upto Rs. 5 lacs;\n(b) 20 percent of the total credit to small scale industry goes to SSI units\nwith investment in plant and machinery between Rs. 5 lakhs and Rs. 25 lakhs;\nand\n(c) the remaining 40 percent goes to other SSI units with investment\nexceeding Rs. 25 lakhs.\n2.3  DRI Advances\n(i) It should be ensured that not less than 40 percent of the total advances granted\nunder DRI scheme go to scheduled caste/scheduled tribes.\n(ii) At least two third i.e. 662/3 percent of DRI advances should be granted through\nrural and semi-urban branches.\nUnder the DRI Scheme, financial assistance is provided at concessional rate of interest\n(4 percent per annum) to selected low income groups, for productive endeavours.\n2.4  Weaker Sections\n(i) In order to ensure that more under-privileged sections in the priority sector are\ngiven proper attention in the matter of allocation of credit, it should be ensured that the\nadvances to the weaker sections reach a level of 25 percent  of priority sector advances\nor 10 percent of net bank credit .\n(ii) The weaker sections under priority sector include the following:\n(a) Small and marginal farmers with land holding of 5 acres and less and\nlandless labourers, tenant farmers and share croppers.\n(b)Artisans, village and cottage industries where individual credit limits do\nnot exceed Rs. 25,000/-\n(c) Beneficiaries of Swarnjayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana ( SGSY)\n(d) Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\n(e) Beneficiaries of Differential Rate of Interest ( DRI) scheme\n(f) Beneficiaries under Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rojgar Yojana ( SJSRY)\n(g) Beneficiaries under the Scheme for Liberation and Rehabilitation of\nScavangers ( SLRS).\n(h) Advances to Self Help Groups\n3. TARGETS FOR FOREIGN BANKS153.1.1 With a view to reducing the disparity between the domestic banks and the foreign\nbanks operating in India in regard to their priority sector obligations the minimum lending\nto priority sector by the foreign banks shall be 32 percent of their net credit.\n3.1.2 However, keeping in view that the foreign banks have no rural branch network, the\ncomposition of priority sector advances in their case will be inclusive of export credit\nprovided by them.\n3.1.3 Within the overall target of 32 percent to be achieved by foreign banks, the advances\nto small scale industries sector should not be less than 10 percent of the net bank credit and\nthe export credit should not be less than 12 percent of the net bank credit.\n[The net bank credit should tally with the figures reported in the fortnightly return\nsubmitted under section 42(2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.]\n4.       DEPOSIT BY FOREIGN BANKS WITH SIDBI TOWARDS SHORTFALL IN\nPRIORITY SECTOR LENDING\n4.1In the event of failure to attain the stipulated targets and sub-targets, the foreign banks\nwill be required to make good the shortfall in the achievement of the targets / sub-targets\nby depositing for a period of one year, an amount equivalent to the shortfall with the Small\nIndustries Development Bank of India ( SIDBI) at the interest rate of 8 percent per annum\nor as may be decided by the Reserve Bank from time to time.\n4.2The shortfall in achieving the priority sector lending target ad the sub-targets should be\ncomputed as on the last reporting Friday of March every year and made good by placing a\ndeposit with SIDBI as stated above. The deposits should be placed before the end of April\nof that year.\n4.3 In regard to the above, it is to be clarified that in the event of failure on the part of\nforeign banks to achieve any of the stipulated sub-targets in respect of advances to SSI\nsector and export credit, even if they achieve the overall target of 32 percent, the shortfall\nshould be made good by placing with SIDBI a deposit of an amount equivalent to the\nshortfall in each of the sub-targets. Also, in the event of failure on the part of banks to\nachieve one of the sub-targets or both the sub-targets, and also the overall target of 32\npercent, the shortfall in achieving the sub-targets and the overall target should be made\ngood by placing with SIDBI a deposit of an amount equivalent to ( i) aggregate shortfall in\nthe sub-targets, or (ii) the shortfall in the overall target, whichever shortfall is higher. In\ncase the shortfall is in achievement of the overall target only and not in the sub-target,\nbanks should make good the shortfall in achieving the overall target.\n4.4The outstanding balances of these deposits placed with SIDBI may be reckoned as part\nof their priority sector advances during the currency of the deposits, as indirect finance to\nSSIs. The amount of deposits should, however, be shown separately in the returns on\npriority sector advances submitted to RBI.\n5.CONTRIBUTION BY B ANKS TO RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT\nFUND ( RIDF)\n5.1 Domestic scheduled commercial banks having shortfall in lending to priority sector /\nagriculture are allocated amounts for contribution to the Rural Infrastructure Development\nFund (RIDF) established in NABARD. Details regarding operationalisation of the RIDF16such as the amounts to be deposited by banks, interest rates on deposits, period of deposits\netc., are decided every year after announcement in the Union Budget about setting up of\nRIDF. The contributions to be made by banks are communicated to the banks concerned\nseparately.\n5.2 Shortfall in lending to priority sector / agriculture is taken into account while making\nallocations to banks under RIDF, which amount has to be deposited with NABARD at a\ncertain rate of interest. In the case of RIDF-I to VI, the rate of interest on deposits placed in\nthe Fund was uniform for all banks irrespective of the extent of their shortfall. It has now\nbeen decided to link the rate of interest on RIDF deposits to the banks\u2019 performance in\nlending to agriculture.  Accordingly, banks will receive interest from NABARD on\ncontribution to RIDF-VII at rates of interest inversely proportional to the shortfall in\nagricultural lending, as indicated below:\nSr.\nNo.Shortfall in lending to agriculture in\nterms of percentage to Net Bank\nCredit (i.e. Target minus\nachievement)Rate of interest on the\nentire deposit to be\nmade in RIDF VII\n(Percent per annum)\n1Less than 2 percentage points 10.0\n22 per cent to 4.99 percentage points 9.0\n35 per cent to 8.99 percentage points 8.0\n4Above 9 percentage points 7.0\nSECTION IV\nCOMMON GUIDELINES FOR PRIORITY SECTOR ADVANCES\n1. Based on the recommendations made by the working groups and high powered committees\nappointed by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank, a set of comprehensive\nguidelines to be followed for advances to all categories of borrowers in the priority sector were\nevolved. These guidelines are detailed in the subsequent paragraphs. Banks should follow these\ncommon guidelines prescribed by the Reserve Bank for all categories of advances under the\npriority sector .\n2. PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS\n2.1 Completion of Application Forms\nIn areas covered by special schemes such as SGSY, the concerned project authorities like\nDRDAs, DICs etc. should arrange for completion of application forms received from\nborrowers. In other areas, the bank staff should help the borrowers for this purpose.\n2.2 Issue of Acknowledgement of Loan Applications\nBanks should give acknowledgement for loan applications received from weaker sections.\nTowards this purpose, while getting fresh stocks of application forms printed, it may be17ensured that these forms have perforated portion for acknowledgement to be completed and\nissued by the receiving branch. Each branch may affix on the main application form as well\nas the corresponding portion for acknowledgement, a running serial number. While using\nthe existing stock of application forms till then, an acknowledgement (separately prepared)\nshould be given for each application, care being taken to ensure that the serial number\ngiven on the acknowledgement is also recorded on the main application.\n2.3 Disposal of Applications\nAll loan applications upto a credit limit of Rs. 25,000/- should be disposed of within a\nfortnight and those for over Rs. 25,000/-, within 8 to 9 weeks.\n2.4 Rejection of Proposals\nBranch Managers may reject applications (except in respect of SC/ST) provided the cases\nof rejection are verified subsequently by the Divisional/Regional Managers. In the case of\nproposals from SC/ST, rejection should be at a level higher than that of Branch Manager.\n2.5 Register of Rejected Applications\nA register should be maintained at branch wherein the date of receipt,\nsanction/rejection/disbursement with reasons therefor etc., should be recorded. The register\nshould be made available to all inspecting agencies.\n3. MODE OF DISBURSEMENT OF LOAN\nAs far as possible, disbursement of loan amounts sanctioned should be made directly to the\nsuppliers of inputs such as seeds, fertilisers, raw materials, implements, trucks, machinery,\netc.\n4. REPAYMENT SCHEDULE\n4.1 Repayment programme should be fixed taking into account the sustenance\nrequirements, surplus generating capacity, the break-even point, the life of the asset, etc.,\nand not in an \"ad hoc\" manner. In respect of composite loan upto Rs. 50,000/- to artisans,\nvillage and cottage industries, repayment schedule may be fixed for term loan component\nonly (subject to SIDBI's requirements being fulfilled).\n4.2 In case of default on account of natural calamities like floods, drought, etc. crop loans\nmay be converted into medium-term loans of 3 to 5 years and extension/ re- phasement may\nbe allowed in the case of term loans.\n4.3 In the case of other borrowers affected by natural calamities, banks may convert\ndrawings in excess of the value of security into a term loan repayable over a reasonable\nperiod of time and provide further working capital and extend/re-phase the instalments due\nunder term loans.\n5. GUARANTEE PREMIUM\n5.1 The premium payable to DICGC on the advances granted to the 'Weaker Sections' in\nthe priority sector should be borne by the bank and should not be recovered from the\nborrowers.\n5.2 Premium should be borne by the banks in respect of -18housing loans upto Rs. 5,000/- to SC/ST and weaker section;\npure consumption loans as defined by the Government of India; and\nother borrowers for loans upto Rs. 25,000/- excluding -\nloans to individuals against the security of shares and debentures/bonds,\nloans for purchase of consumer durables, and\nother non-priority sector personal loans.\n5.3 Guarantee premium should be borne by the bank in the case of sick SSI units during the\nperiod of rehabilitation programme.\n5.4 In the case of other borrowers, the absorption/recovery of guarantee premium from the\nborrowers is left to the bank's discretion. Banks should formulate suitable internal\nguidelines duly approved by the Board of Directors and on that basis, the guarantee fee\nmay be charged to the borrowers.\n6. RATES OF INTEREST\nThe rates of interest on various categories of priority sector advances will be as per RBI\ndirectives issued from time to time.\n7. PENAL INTEREST\n7.1.1 The policy of levying penal rates should be implemented with discrimination and\nselectivity. In order to avoid indiscriminate levy of penal rate, the decisions on penal rate\nshould be taken at a fairly higher level in each bank.\n7.1.2 No penal interest should be charged for loans upto Rs. 25,000/-.\n7.1.3 For limits over Rs. 25,000/- the aggregate penal/additional interest should not exceed\n2 percent over and above the rate of interest applicable/normally charged to the borrowers.\n8. INSPECTION CHARGES\n8.1.1 No inspection charges should be levied on advances upto Rs. 5,000/-.\n8.1.2 For advances above Rs. 5,000/- but upto Rs. 25,000/-, inspection charges may be\nlevied at the flat rate of Rs. 2.50 per inspection per borrower. These charges should,\nhowever, not exceed Rs. 10 per year per borrower.\n8.1.3 For loans above Rs. 25,000/- reasonable inspection charges may be levied; care\nshould, however, be taken to see that the inspection charges on advances to the weaker\nsections in the priority sector are lower than the rates framed for such inspection in other\ncases.\n9. INSURANCE AGAINST FIRE AND OTHER RISKS\n9.1.1 Banks may waive insurance of assets financed by bank credit in the following cases:\nNo. Category Type of\nRiskType of Assets19(a)All categories of priority\nsector advances upto and\ninclusive of Rs. 10,000/-Fire & other\nrisksEquipment and\ncurrent assets\nAdvances to SSI sector\nupto and inclusive of Rs.\n25,000/- by way of -\n\u2022 Composite loans to\nartisans, village and\ncottage industriesFire Equipment and\ncurrent assets\n\u2022 All term loans Fire Equipment(b)\n\u2022 Working capital where\nthese are against non-\nhazardous goodsFire Current Assets\n9.1.2 Where, however, insurance of vehicle or machinery or other equipment/assets is\ncompulsory under the provisions of any law or where such a requirement is stipulated in\nthe refinance scheme of any refinancing agency or as part of a Government-sponsored\nprogrammes such as, IRDP (since replaced by SGSY), insurance should not be waived\neven if the relative credit facility does not exceed Rs. 10,000/- or Rs. 25,000/-, as the case\nmay be.\n10. OTHER CHARGES\nBanks should not levy any other service charges except by way of reimbursement of\nreasonable out of pocket expenses.\n11. PHOTOGRAPHS OF BORROWERS\nWhile there is no objection to taking photographs of the borrowers, for purposes of\nidentification, banks themselves should make arrangements for the photographs and also\nbear the cost of photographs of borrowers falling in the category of Weaker Sections. It\nshould also be ensured that the procedure does not involve any delay in loan disbursement.\n12. DISCRETIONARY POWERS\nAll Branch Managers of banks should be vested with discretionary powers to sanction\nproposals from weaker sections without reference to any higher authority. If there are\ndifficulties in extending such discretionary powers to all the Branch Managers, such\npowers should exist at least at the district level and arrangements be ensured that credit\nproposals on weaker sections are cleared promptly.\n13. MACHINERY TO LOOK INTO COMPLAINTS\n13.1.1 There should be a machinery at the regional offices\nto entertain complaints from the borrowers if the branches do not follow these guidelines,\nand\nto verify periodically that these guidelines are implemented by the branches in actual\npractice.2013.1.2 The names and addresses of the officer with whom complaints can be lodged should\nbe displayed on the notice board of every branch.\n14. AMENDMENTS\nThese guidelines are subject to any instructions that may be issued by\nthe RBI from time to time.21Annexures\n\u2022 Annexure I\n\u2022 Annexure II\n\u2022 Annexure III\nAnnexure I\nMaster Circular\nGENERAL GUIDELINES ON\nPRIORITY SECTOR LENDING\nIllustrative List of Small Scale\nService Business (Industry Related) Enterprises ( SSSBEs)\n(Vide paragraph 2.3.2 of Section I)\n[As pre circular issued by the Ministry of Industries, Government of India]\n1.

The contents of the Annexure may be modified by way of additions, deletions\nor substitutions, from time to time, as may be mutually agreed upon between the two\nGovernments.  The credit will not cover third country imports.  The export of goods and\nservices from India and their import into Mauritius under the line of credit shall take\nplace through normal commercial channels and will be subject to the laws and\nregulations in force in both the countries.\n2. The broad terms and conditions of the line of credit are as under :\n(a) All contracts will be subject to the approval of the Government of India and the\nGovernment of Mauritius and shall contain a clause to that effect.  The contracts\nshould be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs,\nGovernment of India, New Delhi, for approval.  The Government of Mauritius\nand the State Bank of India, New Delhi, will be informed in respect of each\napproved contract by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.: 2 :\n(b) The credit of US $ 100 million will cover 90 per cent of f.o.b. value of the eligible\ngoods and services to be exported from India. The 10 per cent of the f.o.b. value\nshall be paid by the importer in U.S. Dollars at the time of opening of the letter of\ncredit.  Accordingly, letters of credit should specify that 10 per cent value shall be\nmet out of the remittances from Mauritius while the balance 90 per cent shall be\nfinanced from the credit. The value of the contract should be expressed in U.S.\nDollars.\n(c) All disbursements under the credit should be made under letters of credit opened\nby banks in Mauritius only. All letters of credit shall be advised by banks in\nMauritius to the State Bank of India, New Delhi, for onward transmission to the\nexporter/s either direct or through another bank in India, if any, nominated by the\nexporter/s. Normal commercial practices followed in respect of advising\npayments under letters of credit will be applicable. All claims to the State Bank of\nIndia for payment of 90 per cent of the f.o.b. value will need to be supported by a\ncertificate of the negotiating bank that the 10 per cent amount directly payable has\nbeen received. The letters of credit should be supported by a copy of the contract\nand should contain the following reimbursement clause :\n \u201cReimbursement for 90 per cent of the f.o.b. value of the contract shall be\nprovided by the State Bank of India, New Delhi from US$ 100 million credit\nextended by the Government of the Republic of India to the Government of\nthe Republic of Mauritius. The letter of credit is negotiable after the State\nBank of India has issued an advice that it is operative. All claims to the State\nBank of India for payment of 90 per cent of the f.o.b. value will need to be\nsupported by a certificate of the negotiating bank to the effect that the 10 per\ncent directly payable has been received\".\n3.The contracts to be financed under the credit agreement for items specified in\nparagraph 1 of the Annexure should be signed and relative letters of credit established by\nMay 31, 2002 and the full amount be drawn under the credit by May 31, 2003.

On receipt of the full\npayment of bills in the manner indicated above, authorised dealers should certify\nduplicate copies of the relative GR/SDF/SOFTEX Forms and forward the same to the\nconcerned office/s of Reserve Bank in the usual manner.: 3 :\n5.Ordinarily, no agency commission shall be payable in respect of exports financed\nunder the line of credit.  However, Reserve Bank may consider on merit, requests for\npayment of commission upto a maximum extent of 5 per cent of the f.o.b. value in\nrespect of capital goods which require after sales service.  In such cases, commission will\nhave to be paid in Mauritius by deduction from the invoice value of the relevant shipment\nand the reimbursable amount will be 90 per cent of the f.o.b. value minus the commission\npaid.  Approval for payment of commission should be obtained before the relevant\nshipment is effected.\n6.Authorised dealers may bring the contents of this circular to the notice of their\nconstituents engaged in exports to Mauritius.\n7.The directions contained in this circular have been issued under Secti on 10(4) and\nSection 11(1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999).

Authorised dealers are, therefore, advised to suitably inform the\nmembers of public that remittance in any form  towards participation in lottery schemes\nare prohibited under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. Further, these restrictions\nare also applicable to remittances for participation in lottery like schemes functioning\nunder different names like money circulation scheme, or remittances for the purpose of\nsecuring prize money/awards etc.\n3.

It is observed that the level of advances granted under the scheme continues to be far\nbelow the prescribed target of 1% of aggregate advances of the previous year. The Standing\nCommittee on Finance on Demand for Grants (2001-02) of the Ministry of Finance has\nexpressed serious concern over the unsatisfactory implementation of DRI scheme by banks.\nThe Committee has expressed its unhappiness at the continuous decline in the advances under\nDRI scheme by Public Sector Banks as a percentage to their total advances from 0.40%\nin1996 to 0.18% in 2000 and the dismal performance by Private Sector Banks in lending\nunder DRI scheme. As you are aware, DRI scheme exclusively caters to the credit\nrequirements of the weakest among the weak and is a niche scheme for the benefit of poor\nsections of the rural and urban population. It is, therefore necessary that the scheme be\nimplemented with greater vigor by banks.\n3.

CP, as a privately placed instrument, was introduced in India in 1990\nwith a view to enabling highly rated corporate borrowers to diversify their sources of short-\nterm borrowings and to provide an additional instrument to investors. Subsequently, primary\ndealers and satellite dealers were also permitted to issue CP to enable them to meet their\nshort-term funding requirements for their operations.  To  keep pace with several\ndevelopments in the financial market, and in the light of recommendations made by an\nInternal Group ,Reserve Bank , in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 45 J, 45 K\nand 45 L of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934) had issued revised guidelines\nfor issue of CP vide Notification No. IECD/1/08.15.01/2000-01 dated October 10, 2000 as\namended vide Notification No.IECD / 2 /08.15.01/2000-01 dated April 30, 2001, replacing\nall earlier directions/guidelines on the subject. Full text of the guidelines for issue of CP\nincorporating all the amendments issued till date is given below for ready reference.\nWho can issue Commercial Paper ( CP)\n2.Corporates, primary dealers ( PDs) and satellite dealers ( SDs), and the all-India\nfinancial institutions ( FIs) that have been permitted to raise short-term resources under the\numbrella limit fixed by Reserve Bank of India are eligible to issue CP.\n3.A corporate would be eligible to issue CP provided - (a) the tangible net worth of the\ncompany, as per the latest audited balance sheet, is not less than Rs. 4 crore; (b) company has\nbeen sanctioned working capital limit by bank/s or all-India financial institution/s; and (c) the\nborrowal  account of the company is classified as a Standard Asset by the financing bank/s/\ninstitution/s.\nRating Requirement\n4.All eligible participants shall obtain the credit rating for issuance of Commercial\nPaper  from either the Credit Rating Information Services of India Ltd. ( CRISIL) or the\nInvestment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Ltd. ( ICRA) or the Credit\nAnalysis and Research Ltd. (CARE) or the FITCH Ratings India Pvt. Ltd. or such other credit\nrating agency ( CRA) as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time, for\nthe purpose.  The minimum credit rating shall be P-2 of CRISIL or such equivalent rating by\nother agencies.  The issuers shall ensure at the time of issuance of CP that the rating so\nobtained is current and has not fallen due for review.\nMaturity\n5.CP can be issued for maturities between a minimum of 15 days and a maximum upto\none year from the date of issue.  The maturity date of the CP should not go beyond the date\nup to which the credit rating of the issuer is valid.\nDenominations6.CP can be issued in denominations of Rs.5 lakh or multiples thereof. Amount invested\nby single investor should not be less than Rs.5 lakh (face value).\nLimits and the Amount of Issue of CP\n7.CP can be issued as a \"stand alone\" product.   The aggregate amount of CP from an\nissuer shall be within the limit as approved by its Board of Directors or the quantum indicated\nby the Credit Rating Agency for the specified rating, whichever is lower. Banks and FIs will,\nhowever, have the flexibility to fix working capital limits duly taking into account the\nresource pattern of companies\u2019 financing including CPs.\n8.An FI can issue CP within the overall umbrella limit fixed by the RBI i.e., issue of CP\ntogether with other instruments viz., term money borrowings, term deposits, certificates of\ndeposit and inter-corporate deposits should not exceed 100 per cent of its net owned funds, as\nper the latest audited balance sheet.\n9.The total amount of CP proposed to be issued should be raised within a period of two\nweeks from the date on which the issuer opens the issue for subscription.  CP may be issued\non a single date or in parts on different dates provided that in the latter case, each CP shall\nhave the same maturity date. Every CP issue should be reported to the Chief General\nManager, Industrial and Export Credit Department ( IECD), Reserve Bank of India, Central\nOffice, Mumbai through the Issuing and Paying Agent  ( IPA) within three days from the date\nof completion of the issue, incorporating details as per Schedule II.\n10.Every issue of CP, including renewal, should be treated as a fresh issue.\nWho can act as Issuing and Paying Agent ( IPA)\n11.Only a scheduled bank can act as an IPA for issuance of CP.\nInvestment in CP\n12.CP may be issued to and held by individuals, banking companies, other corporate\nbodies registered or incorporated in India and unincorporated bodies, Non-Resident Indians\n(NRIs) and Foreign Institutional Investors ( FIIs).  However, investment by FIIs would be\nwithin the limits set for their investments by Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI).\nMode of Issuance\n13.CP can be issued either in the form of a promissory note (Schedule I) or in a\ndematerialised form through any of the depositories approved by and registered with SEBI.\nAs regards the existing stock of CP, the same can continue to be held either in physical form\nor can be dematerialised, if both the issuer and the investor agree for the same.\n14.CP will be issued at a discount to face value as may be determined by the issuer.\n15. No issuer shall have the issue of Commercial Paper underwritten or\nco-accepted.\nPreference for Dematerialised form16.While option is available to both issuers and subscribers to issue/hold CP in\ndematerialised or physical form, issuers and  subscribers are encouraged to prefer exclusive\nreliance on dematerialised form of issue/holding.  However, with effect from June 30, 2001,\nbanks, FIs, PDs and SDs are directed to make fresh investments and hold CP only in\ndematerialised form. Outstanding investments in scrip form in the books of banks, FIs, PDs\nand SDs should also be converted into dematerialised form by October 31, 2001.  Thus, with\neffect from November 1, 2001, these entities will hold CP only in dematerialised form.\nPayment of CP\n17.The initial investor in CP shall pay the discounted value of the CP by means of a\ncrossed account payee cheque to the account of the issuer through IPA. On maturity of CP,\nwhen the CP is held in physical form, the holder of the CP shall present the instrument for\npayment to the issuer through the IPA.  However, when the CP is held in demat form, the\nholder of the CP will have to get it redeemed through the depository and receive payment\nfrom the IPA.\nStand-by Facility\n18.In view of  CP being a `stand alone\u2019 product, it would not be obligatory in any manner\non the part of banks and FIs to provide stand-by facility to the issuers of CP.  Banks and FIs\nwould, however, have the flexibility to provide for a CP issue, credit enhancement by way of\nstand-by assistance/credit backstop facility, etc., based on their commercial judgement and as\nper terms prescribed by them.  However, these should be within the prudential norms as\napplicable and subject to specific approval of the Board.\nProcedure for Issuance\n19.Every issuer must appoint an IPA for issuance of CP.  The issuer should disclose to\nthe potential investors its financial position as per the standard market practice. After the\nexchange of deal confirmation between the investor and the issuer, issuing company shall\nissue physical certificates to the investor or arrange for crediting the CP to the investor's\naccount with a depository. Investors shall be given a copy of IPA certificate to the effect that\nthe issuer has a valid agreement with the IPA and documents are in order (Schedule III).\nRole and Responsibilities\n20.The role and responsibilities of issuer, IPA and CRA are set out below :\n(a)  Issuer\nWith the simplification in the procedures for CP issuance, issuers would now have\nmore flexibility.

NABARD has, in consultation with the representatives of insurance companies,\nbankers and Govt. of India, finalised the Personal Accident Insurance Scheme for KCC\nholders, for uniform implementation by banks throughout the country. A specimen of the\nMaster Policy is annexed. The procedure for collection of insurance premia, issue of\nmaster insurance policy, extension of insurance cover, settlement of insurance claims etc.\nhave been simplified and made hassle-free. The salient features of the Scheme are as\nunder:\ni) The servicing of the business will be undertaken by the four insurance\ncompanies on zone wise basis so as to cover entire country.\nii) The insurance company for each zone will designate an office at the district\nlevel as the nodal office for coordinating the implementation of personal\naccident insurance scheme for KCC holders in the district.\niii) A Master Insurance Policy will be issued by this office to each Zonal /\nRegional office of commercial bank covering all its KCC holders.\niv) The premium payable for a one year policy is Rs.15/- while the same for 3-year\npolicy will be Rs.45/-.\nv) The insurance coverage would be available under the Policy only from the date\nof receipt of premium by the insurance company.\nvi) The banks may ensure to incorporate the name of the Nominee in the Kisan\nCredit Card-cum-Pass Book.\nvii) A simplified claim settlement procedure has been evolved under the Scheme\nwhereby an Enquiry-cum-Verification Committee comprising representatives\nof the Branch Manager of the implementing bank, Lead Bank Officer and the\ninsurance company would certify the nature of the accident causing disability /\ndeath and recommend settlement of insurance claims.\n3. While announcing the personal accident insurance package to the KCC holders,\nHon'ble Union Finance Minister, in his Budget Speech, had also mentioned that the\npremium burden will be shared by the card issuing institutions. It has since been decided\nin consultation with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Banking, Government ofIndia that the premium payable to the insurance company under the said Scheme shall be\nshared between the KCC issuing bank and the KCC holder in the ratio of 2:1.\n4. You are requested to initiate necessary steps to operationalise the Scheme\nexpeditiously in consultation with the identified insurance company entrusted with the\nresponsibility of administering the Scheme at the State/ District level. Operational issues,\nif any, coming up during the course of implementation of the Scheme may be taken up\ndirectly with the concerned nominated office of the insurance company for immediate\nremedial action.\n5. Please ensure that all the existing KCC holders are covered under the Personal\nAccident Insurance Policy.

Risk Coverage\nThe benefits under the scheme are as under:\na) Death due to accident (within 12 months of the accident) caused\nby outward, violent and visible meansRs.50,000/-\nb) Permanent total disability Rs.50,000/-\nc) Loss of two limbs or two eyes or one limb and one eye Rs.50,000/-\nd) Loss of one limb or one eye Rs.25,000/-\n(The cover is subject to exclusions as per Annexure 'A'\n4. Period of Master Policy\nThis Master Policy shall remain valid for a period of three years effective from     /    /2001\nto     /    /2004.  Modification/alteration of any of or all the terms and conditions of the\npolicy shall be made at the end of the three years period.  The review of the premium and\nclaims experience under the scheme shall be made at the end of this period and depending\nupon the claims experience, if exceeds 70%, the premium shall be suitably loaded.\n5. Period of Insurance\nThe insurance cover will be in force for a period of one year from the date of receipt of\npremium from the participating Banks in cases where annual premium is paid.  In case theparticipating Banks opt to pay the three year premium then the period of insurance would\nbe for three years from the date of receipt of premium.\n6. Premium\nIt is agreed that the participating banks will pay to the designated insurance company a\npremium of Rs.15 (net) per KCC holder towards the annual premium.  The cover will\ncease at the end of one year from the date of receipt of the premium.  In order to ensure\ncontinuity of the policy the banks should arrange to pay the premium for the next year in\nadvance to keep the policy continuously in force.  However participating banks have the\noption to pay the premium at the rate of Rs.45/- for a three years policy period.  The\nService Tax is waived for this cover.\n7. Operational procedure\na) The servicing of the business will be undertaken by the four Companies on zone\nwise basis as under:\nSr.\nNo.Name of the Companies Zone States\n1. National Ins. Co. Ltd. Eastern Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Manipur,\nMeghalaya, Nagaland, Orissa, Sikkim,\nArunachal Pradesh, Tripura, West\nBengal\n2. The new India Assurance\nCo. Ltd.Western Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh,\nMaharashtra, Dadra & Nagar Haveli,\nGoa, Daman & Diu\n3. The Oriental Ins. Co. Ltd. Northern Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu &\nKashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar\nPradesh, Uttarnchal, Chandigarh &\nDelhi\n4. United India Ins. Co. Ltd. Southern Andhra Pradesh, Karntaka, Kerala,\nAndaman and Nicobar, Pondicherry,\nTamil Nadu, Lakshadweep\nb) The Head Office of District Central Co-operative Banks and RRBs and\nZonal/Regional Offices of Commercial Banks will pay the premium to the nearest\ndesignated office of the insurance company along with the list of KCC holders.\nThis office will be nominated by the Head Office of the insurance company in the\nrespective Zones.\nc) This designated office of the insurance company will issue Master Policy covering\nthe KCC holders separately to each of the Head Offices of the District Central Co-\noperative Banks, RRBs and Zonal/Regional Offices Commercial Banks.d) To begin with, it is desirable to cover all the existing KCC holders who are on the\nbooks of the participating banks.

It\nis expected that there will be some time lage between the collection of premium\nfrom the card holders and its remittance to the insurance company.  In cases where\nany accident occurs in between, the card holder is not held covered during this gap.\nSo as to ensure that the card holder gets covered from the date of collection of the\npremium, the Banks may consider to arrange to keep extra premium as deposit\nwith the insurance company.

Since the present\nPass Book does not contain nominee details, the same has to be incorporated in the\nPass Book.\ni) While the new members can be included in the scheme on monthly basis there is\nno provision for deletion of the KCC members already enrolled.  If for any reason\nthey are going outside the scope of KCC scheme during the policy period, theywill still continue to be covered under the scheme for the period for which they\nwere originally insured.\n8.

Changes   in RNBC DirectionsAn amendment is made to the paragraphs 2 and 20 of the RNBC (Reserve Bank) Directions,\n1987 to substitute the words \" Non-Banking Financial Companies (Reserve Bank) Directions,\n1977 \" with the words \"Non-Banking Financial Companies Acceptance of  Public Deposit\n(Reserve Bank) Directions 1998 \".\nClarifications\n7.  Accounting for Repossessed Assets\nThe Bank has been receiving various references seeking clarification on procedure of accounting\nin respect of repossessed assets.  The issue was also discussed in the Informal Advisory Group\non NBFCs and it has been decided that the proper accounting procedure would be as follows :\n(a)    In case the asset is taken as part of Fixed assets for own use\n(i) The  repossession of leased or hire purchase assets should be treated as\nforeclosure of the contract of lease  or hire purchase finance;\n(ii) The accounting adjustment should be done in these cases by taking the assets\nat its book value;\n(iii) In case of hire purchase assets, in arriving at the book value, the asset value\nshould be depreciated by 20 per cent per annum of the cost on straight-line\nmethod;\n(iv) The realisable value has to be arrived at after deducting the expenditure likely\nto be incurred on resale of the asset;\n(v) The provision in regard to deficit between book value and realisable value\nshould be made in the current year itself.\n(b)    In case the asset is still treated as part of Lease / hire purchase portfolio\nThe asset should continue to be treated as non-performing and provisions should be made\naccording to the provisioning norms on the lines of those applicable to rescheduled contracts.\n8.  Computation of amount of public deposits for determination\nof SLR - Impact of TDS\nNBFCs are required to maintain liquid assets on outstanding liabilities in respect of public\ndeposits together with interest accrued thereon, as per the provisions of section 45-IB of the RBI\nAct.  The NBFCs are obliged to deduct TDS, wherever applicable and remit the same to\nGovernment.  A question has arisen as to the computation of aggregate amount of liabilities\nunder the head 'public deposits' where interest is payable on cumulative basis and TDS on such\ninterest amount has been remitted to Government.  It has been noticed that companies arefollowing different practices for computing the net amount of outstanding public deposit\nliabilities while taking into account TDS on interest accrued.  It is clarified that NBFCs may  net\noff the  TDS actually deducted and remitted to Government from the interest payable on deposits\nas applicable and maintain liquid assets on outstanding public deposit liabilities.\n9.  Auditors to include violation of RBI Act/Directions in their report\nto the shareholders of the company\nUnder the provisions of  sub-section (2) of Section 227 of the Companies Act, 1956, the\nStatutory Auditor of a company is required to make a report to the members of the company on\nthe accounts examined by him and certify that these accounts present a true and fair picture of\nthe company.  Under Section 45MA(2) of the RBI Act, 1934, the Statutory Auditor would also\nbe making a report to the RBI regarding any contravention by an NBFC in respect of compliance\nwith provisions of the RBI Act, 1934 and Directions issued thereunder.  Section 45MA (2) also\nrequires that such contravention should form part of the report under Section 227(2) of the\nCompanies Act, 1956.   Statutory auditors of NBFCs are advised that contravention of RBI Act /\nDirections  should also form part of the reports submitted by them to the shareholders of the\ncompany under Section 227(2) of the Companies Act, 1956, besides directly reporting such\ncontraventions to RBI.  Such a measure is expected to improve the accountability of the\nmanagement to the company shareholders.\n10.Conversion of NBFCs from the category of \"deposit\ntaking companies\" to \"non-deposit taking companies \"\nAs you are aware the Bank issues (I) Certificates of Registration (CoR) to eligible companies\nwith authorisation to accept public deposits and  (ii) to companies not so eligible and not\npresently holding public deposits  issues CoR  without authorisation to accept public deposits.\nThe companies at (i) above  which are so authorised can accept public deposits to the extent of\ntheir eligibility as determined by Directions issued in this regard.  It is observed that some of the\nNBFCs which have accepted and held public deposits have since repaid entire public deposits or\nplaced necessary amounts in escrow accounts thus becoming a non-public deposit taking\ncompany.  They do not submit the periodical returns  to the Bank under the impression that they\nneed not submit such returns since they are not holding public deposits any longer.  It is clarified\nthat  the companies having  CoR with authorisation to accept deposits, though they may no\nlonger hold public deposit, are required to continue to  furnish returns on liquid assets, prudential\nnorms, annual return on deposits, etc. in terms of Directions.  However, in order to give some\noperational freedom, it has been decided to  give an option to these NBFCs holding CoR with\nauthorisation to accept  public deposits but not holding  public deposits  that  -\n(i) the company may comply with all the requirements as applicable to a public\ndeposit taking NBFC irrespective of their not holding public deposits viz.\n(a) it would  have to submit all the returns namely, the quarterly return on liquid\nassets, half yearly return on the prudential norms and annual return on\ndeposits.  In case the company choses to retain `A' category certificate but\ndoes not submit the statutory returns, an appropriate adverse action for not\ncomplying with the directions of Reserve Bank of India would be taken\nagainst it  including a review of the CoR granted to it;(b) it would have to comply with all the prudential norms including the CRAR\nand the exposure norms; so that  there would be few  supervisory concerns if\nthe company chooses to accept public deposits  again without prior specific\napproval of RBI;  OR\n(ii) the company  may surrender the CoR issued to it with authorisation to accept\npublic deposits and obtain another CoR which does not authorise it to accept\npublic deposits so that it can enjoy the freedom from submission of returns as also\nthe exemptions from CRAR and exposure norms.  Such company,  when it\nintends to take public deposits,  would obtain prior specific approval of RBI;\nAccordingly, the NBFCs which have branded their CoR as a public deposit taking\ncompany, but currently not holding public deposits are advised to exercise the option within 30\ndays of the receipt of this letter failing which punitive measures would be initiated against them\nfor non-submission of the returns.\n(11)A copy each of the amending Notifications No.  148, 149 and 150  is enclosed.  You are\nrequested to ensure meticulous compliance with the regulatory framework.\nYours faithfully,\n(R.

DNBS (PD).CC.No.15 /02.01 / 2000-2001\nJune  27, 2001\nAll NBFCs\n(Including the residuary non-banking companies)\nDear Sir,\nAsset Liability Management (ALM) System for NBFCs - Guidelines\nAs you are aware, the guidelines for introduction of ALM system by banks and all India financial\ninstitutions have already been issued by Reserve Bank of India  and the system has become operational.\nSince the operations of financial companies also give rise to Asset Liability mismatches  and interest rate\nrisk exposures, it has been decided to introduce an ALM System for the Non-Banking Financial\nCompanies (NBFCs)  as well, as part of their overall system for effective risk management in their\nvarious portfolios.  A copy of the guidelines for Asset Liability Management (ALM) system in NBFCs  is\nenclosed.\n2. The abovementioned guidelines would be applicable to all the NBFCs irrespective of whether\nthey  are accepting / holding public deposits or not.   However to begin with,  NBFCs  (engaged in and\nclassified as equipment leasing, hire purchase finance, loan, investment and residuary non-banking\ncompanies) meeting the criteria of asset base of Rs.100 crore (whether accepting / holding public deposits\nor not) or holding public deposits of Rs. 20 crore  or more (irrespective of their asset size)  as per their\naudited balance sheet as of 31 March 2001 would be required to put in place  the ALM System.  The Chit\nFund Companies i.e: Miscellaneous Non-Banking Companies (MNBCs), and Nidhi Companies i.e.,\nMutual Benefit Finance Companies (MBFCs) have been kept out of the purview of these guidelines.\n3. NBFCs may commence the trial run during the period ending 30 September 2001, which may\ncontinue during the half year beginning 1 October 2001.  The guidelines should however, be fully\noperational  by the year ending 31 March 2002.  A system of half yearly reporting is being put in place in\nthis regard and the first Asset Liability Management return as on 30 September 2002 may be submitted to\nRBI by only those NBFCs which are holding public deposits within a month  of close of the relevant half\nyear i.e., before 31 October 2002 and  continue thereafter in similar manner.  The half yearly returns\nwould comprise of three  parts :\n(i) Statement of structural liquidity in format ALM - Annexure - I;\n(ii) Statement of short term dynamic liquidity in format ALM - Annexure - II; and\n(iii) Statement of Interest Rate Sensitivity in format ALM - Annexure - III.In the case of companies not holding public deposits, separate supervisory arrangements would be made\nand advised in due course of time.\n4. It would be desirable to constitute a small Group under the charge of the Chief Executive Officer\nor a senior executive responsible for treasury function of the institution, with members drawn from\nresources, investments, foreign exchange, credit and MIS areas.  The Group should be entrusted with the\ntask of carrying out necessary spade work for formalising the ALM System in the institution.  A\ncertificate regarding constitution of the Asset Liability Management Committee i.e., ALCO should be\nsent to the Bank before 31 October 2001.\n5. A pre-requisite for putting in place the ALM System is a strong Management Information System\n(MIS).  For a quick analysis and consolidation of the data, it may be necessary to computerise the MIS\nand make use of specialised software for managing the assets and liabilities with respect to the maturity\nmismatches and the various risks associated with such mismatches.  The NBFCs would do well to install\nsuch systems at the earliest,  if not already done.\n6. In  the  meanwhile,  in  the  course   of    the   trial  runs  during   the  period   ending 30\nSeptember 2001 and beginning 1 October 2001; if the companies face any operational difficulties in\nimplementing the guidelines or if they have any suggestions to make for improvement of the guidelines,\nthey may communicate the same to the Regional Office of RBI under whose jurisdiction the registered\noffice of the company is situated.\n7. Other NBFCs which do not meet the criteria  mentioned in para 2, are also recommended  to put\nin place the system of ALM as it is the endeavour of the Bank to gradually introduce it for all the NBFCs,\nfor safeguarding  interests of depositors and preventing systemic risks.\n8. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n( R. Sadanandam )\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nEncl: As above\nGUIDELINES FOR ASSET - LIABILITY MANAGEMENT (ALM) SYSTEM\nIN NON-BANKING FINANCIAL COMPANIES (NBFCs)In the normal course, NBFCs are exposed to credit and market risks in view of the asset-liability\ntransformation. With liberalisation in Indian financial markets over the last few years and\ngrowing integration of domestic markets  with external markets and entry of MNCs for meeting\nthe credit needs of not only the corporates but also the retail segments, the risks associated with\nNBFCs' operations have become complex and large, requiring strategic management. NBFCs are\nnow operating in a fairly deregulated environment and are required to determine on their own,\ninterest rates  on deposits, subject to the ceiling of maximum rate of interest  on deposits they can\noffer on deposits prescribed by the Bank; and advances   on a dynamic basis. The interest rates\non   investments of NBFCs in government and other securities are also now market related.\nIntense competition for business involving both the assets and liabilities has brought pressure on\nthe management of NBFCs  to maintain a good balance among spreads, profitability and long-\nterm viability. Imprudent liquidity management can put NBFCs' earnings and reputation at great\nrisk. These pressures call for structured and comprehensive measures and not just ad hoc action.\nThe managements of NBFCs  have to base their business decisions on a dynamic and integrated\nrisk management system and process, driven by corporate strategy. NBFCs  are exposed to\nseveral major risks in the course of their business - credit risk, interest rate risk, , equity /\ncommodity price risk , liquidity risk and operational risk. It is, therefore, important that NBFCs\nintroduce effective risk management systems that address the issues relating to interest rate  and\nliquidity risks.\n2.NBFCS  need to address these risks in a structured manner by upgrading their risk\nmanagement and adopting more comprehensive Asset-Liability Management (ALM) practices\nthan has been done hitherto. ALM, among other functions, is also concerned with risk\nmanagement and provides a comprehensive and dynamic framework for measuring, monitoring\nand managing liquidity and  interest rate equity and commodity price risks of major operators in\nthe financial system  that needs to be closely integrated with the NBFCs'  business strategy. It\ninvolves assessment of various types of risks and altering the asset-liability portfolio in a\ndynamic way in order to manage risks.\n3.This note lays down broad guidelines in respect of interest rate and liquidity risks\nmanagement systems in NBFCs, which form part of the Asset-Liability Management (ALM)\nfunction. The initial focus of the ALM function would be to enforce the risk managementdiscipline i.e. managing business after assessing the risks involved. The objective of good risk\nmanagement systems should be that these systems will evolve into a strategic tool for NBFCs\nmanagement.\n4.The ALM process rests on three pillars:\n\u2022 ALM Information Systems\n\u21d2 Management Information Systems\n\u21d2 Information availability, accuracy, adequacy and expediency\n\u2022 ALM Organisation\n\u21d2 Structure and responsibilities\n\u21d2 Level of top management involvement\n\u2022 ALM Process\n\u21d2 Risk parameters\n\u21d2 Risk identification\n\u21d2 Risk measurement\n\u21d2 Risk management\n\u21d2 Risk policies and tolerance levels.\n5.ALM Information Systems\n \n 5.1ALM has to be supported by a management philosophy which clearly specifies the risk\npolicies and tolerance limits. This framework needs to be built on sound methodology with\nnecessary information system as back up. Thus, information is the key to the ALM process. It is,\nhowever, recognised that varied business profiles of NBFCs  in the public and private sector do\nnot make the adoption of a uniform ALM System for all  NBFCs feasible. There are various\nmethods prevalent world-wide for measuring risks. These range from the simple Gap Statement\nto extremely sophisticated and data intensive Risk Adjusted Profitability Measurement methods.\nHowever, though the central element for the entire ALM exercise is the availability of adequate\nand accurate information with expedience; and the systems existing, if any, in some of the major\nNBFCs  do not generate information in the manner required for ALM. Collecting accurate data\nin a timely manner will be the biggest challenge before the NBFCs , particularly those lackingfull scale computerisation. However, the introduction of base information system for risk\nmeasurement and monitoring has to be addressed urgently.\n \n 5.2NBFCs have heterogeneous organisational structures, capital base, asset sizes,\nmanagement profile, business activities and geographical spread. Some of them have large\nnumber of branches and agents/brokers whereas some have unitary offices.  Considering the\nlarge network of branches and the lack of (an adequate) support system to collect information\nrequired for ALM which analyses information on the basis of residual maturity and repricing\npattern of liabilities and assets, it will take time for NBFCs  in the present state to get the\nrequisite information. In respect of investment portfolio and funds managemnet, in view of the\ncentralised nature of the functions, it would be much easier to collect reliable information. The\ndata and assumptions can then be refined over time as the  NBFC management gain experience\nof conducting business within an ALM framework. The spread of computerisation will also help\nNBFCs in accessing data.\n6.ALM Organisation\n6.1 a) Successful implementation of the risk management process would require strong\ncommitment on the part of the senior management in the NBFC, to integrate basic operations and\nstrategic decision making with risk management. The Board should have overall responsibility\nfor management of risks and should decide the risk management policy of the NBFC and set\nlimits for liquidity, interest rate and equity price risks.\nb) The Asset - Liability Committee (ALCO) consisting of the NBFC's senior management\nincluding Chief Executive Officer (CEO) should be responsible for ensuring adherence to the\nlimits set by the Board as well as for deciding the business strategy of the NBFC  (on the assets\nand liabilities sides) in line with the NBFC's budget and decided risk management objectives.\nc) The ALM Support Groups consisting of operating staff should be responsible for\nanalysing, monitoring and reporting the risk profiles to the ALCO. The staff should also prepare\nforecasts (simulations) showing the effects of various possible changes in market conditions\nrelated to the balance sheet and recommend the action needed to adhere to NBFC's  internal\nlimits.6.2The ALCO is a decision making unit responsible for balance sheet planning from risk-\nreturn perspective including the strategic management of interest rate and liquidity risks. Each\nNBFC  will have to decide on the role of its ALCO, its responsibility as also the decisions to be\ntaken by it. The business and risk management strategy of the NBFC  should ensure that the\nNBFC  operates within the limits / parameters set by the Board. The business issues that an\nALCO would consider, inter alia, will include product pricing for both deposits and advances,\ndesired maturity profile and mix of the incremental assets and liabilities, prevailing interest rates\noffered by other peer NBFCs for the similar services/product, etc. In addition to monitoring the\nrisk levels of the NBFC, the ALCO should review the results of and progress in implementation\nof the decisions made in the previous meetings. The ALCO would also articulate the current\ninterest rate view of the NBFC  and base its decisions for future business strategy on this view.\nIn respect of the funding policy, for instance, its responsibility would be to decide on source and\nmix of liabilities or sale of assets. Towards this end, it will have to develop a view on future\ndirection of interest rate movements and decide on funding mixes between fixed vs floating rate\nfunds, wholesale vs retail deposits, money market vs capital market funding, domestic vs foreign\ncurrency funding, etc. Individual NBFCs  will have to decide the frequency of holding their\nALCO meetings.\n6.3     Composition of ALCO\nThe size (number of members) of ALCO would depend on the size of each institution, business\nmix and organisational complexity. To ensure commitment of the Top Management and timely\nresponse to market dynamics, the CEO/CMD/President or the Director should head the\nCommittee. The Chiefs of Investment, Credit, Resources Management or Planning, Funds\nManagement / Treasury, International Business and Economic Research can be members of the\nCommittee. In addition, the Head of the Technology Division should also be an invitee for\nbuilding up of MIS and related computerisation. Large NBFCs may even have Sub-committees\nand Support Groups.\n6.4     Committee of DirectorsThe Management Committee of the Board or any other Specific Committee constituted by the\nBoard should oversee the implementation of the system and review its functioning periodically.\n6.5 ALM Process:\n \n The scope of ALM function can be described as follows:\n\u2022 Liquidity risk management\n\u2022 Management of market risks\n\u2022 Funding and capital planning\n\u2022 Profit planning and growth projection\n\u2022 Forecasting and analysing 'What if scenario' and preparation of contingency plans\n \n The guidelines given in this note mainly address Liquidity and Interest Rate risks.\n7.    Liquidity Risk Management\n7.1Measuring and managing liquidity needs are vital for effective operation of NBFCs . By\nensuring an NBFC's ability to meet its liabilities as they become due, liquidity management can\nreduce the probability of an adverse situation developing. The importance of liquidity transcends\nindividual institutions, as liquidity shortfall in one institution can have repercussions on the\nentire system. NBFCs  management should measure not only the liquidity positions of NBFCs\non an ongoing basis but also examine how liquidity requirements are likely to evolve under\ndifferent assumptions. Experience shows that assets commonly considered as liquid, like\nGovernment securities and other money market instruments, could also become illiquid when the\nmarket and players are unidirectional. Therefore, liquidity has to be tracked through maturity or\ncash flow mismatches. For measuring and managing net funding requirements, the use of a\nmaturity ladder and calculation of cumulative surplus or deficit of funds at selected maturity\ndates is adopted as a standard tool. The format of the Statement of Structural Liquidity is\ngiven in Annexure I.\n7.2The Maturity Profile as given in Appendix I could be used for measuring the future cash\nflows of NBFCs  in different time buckets. The time buckets, may be distributed as under:\ni)  1 day to 30/31 days (One month)ii)  Over one month and upto 2 months\niii)  Over two months and upto 3 months\niv)  Over 3 months and upto 6 months\nv)  Over 6 months and upto 1 year\nvi)  Over 1 year and upto 3 years\nvii)  Over 3 years and upto 5 years\nviii)  Over 5 years\n7.3      NBFCs holding public deposits are required to invest up to a prescribed percentage (15%\nas on date) of their public deposits in approved securities in terms of liquid asset requirement of\nScetion 45-IB of the RBI Act, 1934. Residuary Non-Banking Companies (RNBCs) are required\nto invest up to 80% of their deposits in a manner as prescribed in the Directions issued under the\nAct ibid. There is no such requirement for NBFCs which are not holding public deposits. Thus\nvarious NBFCs including RNBCs would be holding in their investment portfolio securities\nwhich could be broadly classifiable as 'mandatory securities' (under obligation of law) and other\n'non-mandatory securities'. In case of NBFCs not holding public deposits, all the investment\nsecurities and in case of NBFCs holding public deposits, the surplus securities (held over and\nabove the requirement) would fall in the category of 'non-mandatory securities'. The NBFCs\nholding public deposits may be given freedom to place the mandatory securities in any time\nbuckets as suitable for them. The listed non-mandatory securities may be placed in any of the \"1\nday to 30/31 days (One month)\", Over one month and upto 2 months\" and \"Over two months and\nupto 3 months\" buckets depending upon the defeasance period proposed by NBFCs. The unlisted\nnon-mandatory securities (eg; equity shares, securities without a fixed term of maturity etc.) may\nbe placed in the \"Over 5 years\" buckets, whereas unlisted non-mandatory securities having a\nfixed term of maturity may be placed in the relevant time bucket as per residual maturity. The\nmandatory securities and listed securities may be marked to market for the purpose of the ALM\nsystem. Unlisted securities may be valued as per Prudential Norms Directions.\n7.4     Alternatively, the NBFCs may also follow the concept of Trading Book which is as\nfollows:\ni) The composition and volume are clearly defined;ii) Maximum maturity/duration of the portfolio is restricted;\niii) The holding period not to exceed 90 days;\niv) Cut-loss limit prescribed;\nv) Defeasance periods (product-wise) i.e. time taken to liquidate the position on the basis of\nliquidity in the secondary market are prescribed;\nNBFCs  which maintain such \u2018Trading Books\u2019 and complying with the above standards may\nshow the trading securities under \"1 day to 30/31 days (One month)\", Over one month and upto 2\nmonths\" and \"Over two months and upto 3 months\" buckets on the basis of the defeasance\nperiods. The Board/ALCO of the NBFCs  should approve the volume, composition,\nholding/defeasance period, cut loss, etc. of the \u2018Trading Book'. The remaining investments\nshould also be classified as short term and long term investments as required under Prudential\nNorms.\n7.5   The policy note recorded by the NBFCs on treatment of the investment portfolio for the\npurpose of ALM and approved by their Board/ALCO should be forwarded to the Regional\nOffice of the Department of Non-Banking Supervision of RBI under whose jurisdiction the\nregistered office of the company is located.\n7.6Within each time bucket, there could be mismatches depending on cash inflows and\noutflows. While the mismatches upto one year would be relevant since these provide early\nwarning signals of impending liquidity problems, the main focus should be on the short-term\nmismatches viz., 1-30/31 days.  NBFCs, however, are expected to monitor their cumulative\nmismatches (running total) across all time buckets by establishing internal prudential limits with\nthe approval of the Board / Management Committee. The mismatches (negative gap) during 1-\n30/31 days in normal course may not exceed 15% of the cash outflows in this time bucket. If an\nNBFC, in view of its current asset -liability profile and the consequential structural mismatches,\nneeds higher tolerance level, it could operate with higher limit sanctioned by its Board /\nManagement Committee giving specific reasons on the need for such higher limit. The discretion\nto allow a higher tolerance level is intended for a temporary period, i.e. till March 31, 2002.7.7     The Statement of Structural Liquidity ( ALM-Annexure I ) may be prepared by placing\nall cash inflows and outflows in the maturity ladder according to the expected timing of cash\nflows. A maturing liability will be a cash outflow while a maturing asset will be a cash inflow.\nWhile determining the likely cash inflows / outflows, NBFCs  have to make a number of\nassumptions according to their asset - liability profiles. While determining the tolerance levels,\nthe NBFCs  may take into account all relevant factors based on their asset-liability base, nature\nof business, future strategy, etc. The RBI is interested in ensuring that the tolerance levels are\ndetermined keeping all necessary factors in view and further refined with experience gained in\nLiquidity Management.\n7.8      In order to enable the NBFCs  to monitor their short-term liquidity on a dynamic basis\nover a time horizon spanning from 1 day to 6 months, NBFCs  may estimate their short-term\nliquidity profiles on the basis of business projections and other commitments for planning\npurposes. An indicative format ( ALM-Annexure II ) for estimating Short-term Dynamic\nLiquidity is enclosed.\n8.       Currency Risk\nFloating exchange rate arrangement has brought in its wake pronounced volatility adding a new\ndimension to the risk profile of NBFCs'  balance sheets having foreign assets or liabilities. The\nincreased capital flows across free economies following deregulation have contributed to\nincrease in the volume of transactions. Large cross border flows together with the volatility has\nrendered the NBFCs'  balance sheets vulnerable to exchange rate movements.\n9.       Interest Rate Risk (IRR)\n9.1      The operational flexibility given to NBFCs  in pricing most of the assets and liabilities\nimply the need for the financial system to hedge the Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the\nrisk where changes in market interest rates might adversely affect an NBFC's  financial\ncondition. The changes in interest rates affect NBFCs  in a larger way. The immediate impact of\nchanges in interest rates is on NBFC's  earnings (i.e. reported profits) by changing its Net Interest\nIncome (NII). A long-term impact of changing interest rates is on NBFC's  Market Value of\nEquity (MVE) or Net Worth as the economic value of NBFC's  assets, liabilities and off-balancesheet positions get affected due to variation in market interest rates. The interest rate risk when\nviewed from these two perspectives is known as \u2018earnings perspective\u2019 and \u2018economic value\nperspective', respectively. The risk from the earnings perspective can be measured as changes in\nthe Net Interest Income (NII) or Net Interest Margin (NIM). There are many analytical\ntechniques for measurement and management of Interest Rate Risk. To begin with, the\ntraditional Gap analysis is considered as a suitable method to measure the Interest Rate Risk in\nthe first place. It is the intention of RBI to move over to the modern techniques of Interest Rate\nRisk measurement like Duration Gap Analysis, Simulation and Value at Risk over time when\nNBFCs  acquire sufficient expertise and sophistication in acquiring and handling MIS.\n9.2      The Gap or Mismatch risk can be measured by calculating Gaps over different time\nintervals as at a given date. Gap analysis measures mismatches between rate sensitive liabilities\nand rate sensitive assets (including off-balance sheet positions). An asset or liability is normally\nclassified as rate sensitive if:\ni)  within the time interval under consideration, there is a cash flow;\nii)  the interest rate resets/reprices contractually during the interval;\niii)  dependent on RBI changes in the interest rates/Bank Rate;\niv)  it is contractually pre-payable or withdrawal before the stated maturities.\n9.3    The Gap Report should be generated by grouping rate sensitive liabilities, assets and off-\nbalance sheet positions into time buckets according to residual maturity or next repricing period,\nwhichever is earlier. The difficult task in Gap analysis is determining rate sensitivity. All\ninvestments, advances, deposits, borrowings, purchased funds, etc. that mature/reprice within a\nspecified timeframe are interest rate sensitive. Similarly, any principal repayment of loan is also\nrate sensitive if the NBFC  expects to receive it within the time horizon. This includes final\nprincipal payment and interim instalments. Certain assets and liabilities to receive/pay rates that\nvary with a reference rate. These assets and liabilities are repriced at pre-determined intervals\nand are rate sensitive at the time of repricing. While the interest rates on term deposits are fixed\nduring their currency, the tranches of advances portfolio is basically floating. The interest rates\non advances received could be repriced any number of occasions, corresponding to the changes\nin PLR.\nThe Gaps may be identified in the following time buckets:i)  1-30/31 days (One month)\nii)  Over one month  to 2 months\niii)  Over two months to 3 months\niv)  Over 3 months to 6 months\nv)  Over 6 months to 1 year\nvi)  Over 1 year to 3 years\nvii)  Over 3 years to 5 years\nviii)  Over 5 years\nix)  Non-sensitive\nThe various items of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet items may be\nclassified as explained in Appendix - II and the Reporting Format for interest rate sensitive assets\nand liabilities is given in ALM-Annexure III.\n9.4   The Gap is the difference between Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) and Rate Sensitive\nLiabilities (RSL) for each time bucket. The positive Gap indicates that it has more RSAs than\nRSLs whereas the negative Gap indicates that it has more RSLs than RLAs. The Gap reports\nindicate whether the institution is in a position to benefit from rising interest rates by having a\npositive Gap (RSA > RSL) or whether it is in a position to benefit from declining interest rates\nby a negative Gap (RSL > RSA). The Gap can, therefore, be used as a measure of interest rate\nsensitivity.\n9.5      Each NBFC  should set prudential limits on individual Gaps with the approval of the\nBoard/Management Committee. The prudential limits should have a relationship with the Total\nAssets , Earning Assets or Equity. The NBFCs  may work out Earnings at Risk (EaR) or Net\nInterest Margin (NIM) based on their views on interest rate movements and fix a prudent level\nwith the approval of the Board/Management Committee. For working out EaR or NIM any of the\ncurrent models may be used.\n9.6     RBI intends to introduce capital adequacy for market risks in due course.\n10.     General10.1    The classification of various components of assets and liabilities into different time\nbuckets for preparation of Gap reports (Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity) as indicated in\nAppendices I & II is the benchmark. NBFCs  which are better equipped to reasonably estimate\nthe behavioral pattern of various components of assets and liabilities on the basis of past data /\nempirical studies could classify them in the appropriate time buckets, subject to approval from\nthe ALCO / Board. A copy of the note approved by the ALCO / Board may be sent to the\nRegional Office of the Department of Non-Banking Supervision of  RBI under whose\njurisdiction the registered office of the company is located. These notes may contain 'what if\nscenario' analysis under various assumed conditions and the contingency plans to face various\nadverse developments.\n10.2    The present framework does not capture the impact of premature closure of deposits and\nprepayment of loans and advances on the liquidity and interest rate risks profile of NBFCs. The\nmagnitude of premature withdrawal of deposits at times of volatility in market interest rates is\nquite substantial. NBFCs should, therefore, evolve suitable mechanism, supported by empirical\nstudies and behavioral analysis to estimate the future behavior of assets, liabilities and off-\nbalance sheet items to changes in market variables and estimate the probabilities of  options.\n10.3     A scientifically evolved internal transfer pricing model by assigning values on the basis\nof current market rates to funds provided and funds used is an important component for effective\nimplementation of ALM System. The transfer price mechanism can enhance the management of\nmargin i.e. lending or credit spread, the funding or liability spread and mismatch spread. It also\nhelps centralising interest rate risk at one place which facilitates effective control and\nmanagement of interest rate risk. A well defined transfer pricing system also provides a rational\nframework for pricing of assets and liabilities.\nAppendix - I\nMaturity Profile - Liquidity\n Heads of Accounts Time-bucket category\nA.

HOUSING FINANCE POLICY, ALLOCATION AND ACHIEVEMENT OF\nTARGET\n1.1National Housing Policy\n1.1.1As a part of the strategy to overcome the colossal housing shortage, the\nCentral Government has adopted a comprehensive National Housing Policy which,\namong other things, envisages -\n(i) development of a viable and accessible institutional system for the provision of\nhousing finance;\n(ii) establishing a system where housing boards and development authorities\nwould concentrate on acquisition and development of land and infrastructure; and\n(iii) creation of conditions in which access to institutional finance is made easier\nand affordable for individuals for construction/buying of houses/flats. This may\ninclude outright purchase of houses/flats constructed by or under the aegis of\npublic agencies.\n1.1.2Banks, with their vast branch network throughout the length and breadth of the\ncountry, occupy a very strategic position in the financial system and have an\nimportant role to play in providing credit to the housing sector in consonance with the\nNational Housing Policy. Therefore, the banks should gear up to deliver the requisite\n\u2018housing finance\u2019 .\n1.2Housing Finance Allocation\n1.2.1 Keeping in view the objectives of the National Housing Finance Po licy, RBI\nannounces policy relating to housing finance allocation and other related matters,\nannually.\n1.2.2Every year, banks will need to achieve the prescribed target of \u2018housing\nfinance\u2019 fixed on the basis of their growth of deposits recorded during the previous\nyear.\n(i) For the financial year  April 2001 to March 2002, each bank is required to\ncompute its share of the housing finance allocation at 3 per cent of its incremental\ndeposits as on the last reporting Friday of March 2001 over the corresponding\nfigure of the last reporting Friday of March 2000.\n(ii) This is the minimum housing finance allocation and there is no objection to\nthe banks exceeding this level, having regard to their resources position.\n(iii) By the end of April each year, banks should submit to RBI, the final figures\nof deposits as on the last reporting Friday of March of preceding two financial\nyears and the amount of housing finance allocation computed at the prescribed\nrate for the current financial year.\n1.3Target Achievement by BanksBanks may deploy their funds under the housing finance allocation in any of\nthe three categories, i.e.,\n(i)direct finance,\n(ii)indirect finance, or\n(iii)investment in bonds of NHB/HUDCO, or combination thereof.\n2.CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES\n2.1 Classification\nThe Working Group appointed by RBI to examine the role of banking system in\nproviding finance for housing schemes, classified construction activities in the\nfollowing three categories:\n(i)Categories of construction activities eligible for ban k credit as\n\u2018housing finance\u2019 and inclusion in the yearly allocation.\n(ii) Categories of construction activities eligible for bank credit but not to be\nincluded in the \u2018housing finance\u2019 allocation.\n(iii) Categories of construction activities not eligible for bank credit.\n2.2Bank credit eligible for inclusion in the Housing Finance Target under Annual\nHousing Finance Allocation\nThe following types of bank credit will be eligible  for being treated as \u2018housing\nfinance\u2019  under the Annual Housing Finance Allocation:\n(i)Direct housing finance up to Rs. 5 lakh provided per dwelling in semi-\nurban/rural areas and up to Rs. 10 lakh provided in urban/ metropolitan areas.\n(ii) Finance provided for construction of residential houses to be constructed\nby public housing agencies like HUDCO, Housing Boards, local bodies,\nindividuals, co-operative societies, employers, etc., excepting the housing\nfinance of the nature mentioned in paragraph 2.3 below, priority being\naccorded for financing construction of houses meant for economically weaker\nsections, low income group and middle income group.\n(iii) Finance for construction of educational, health, social, cultural or other\ninstitutions/ centres, which are part of a housing project and which are\nnecessary for the development of settlements or townships;\n(iv) Finance for shopping complexes, markets and such other centres catering\nto the day to day needs of the residents of the housing colonies and forming\npart of a housing project;\n(v) Finance for construction meant for improving the conditions in slum areas\nfor which credit may be extended directly to the slum-dwellers on the\nguarantee of the Government, or indirectly to them through the State\nGovernment agencies;(vi) Bank credit given for slum improvement schemes to be implemented by\nSlum Clearance Boards and other public agencies ;\n(vii) Finance provided to -\n(a) the bodies constituted for undertaking repairs to houses, and\n(b) the owners of building/house/flat, whether occupied by themselves or\nby tenants, to meet the need-based requirements for their\nrepairs/additions, after satisfying themselves regarding the estimated cost\n(for which requisite certificate should be obtained from an\nEngineer/Architect, wherever necessary) and obtaining such security as\ndeemed appropriate;\n(viii) Housing finance provided by banks for which refinance is availed of\nfrom National Housing Bank (NHB);\n(ix) Investment in the guaranteed/non-guaranteed bonds and debentures of\nNHB/HUDCO in the primary market , provided investment in non-\nguaranteed bonds is made only if guaranteed bonds are not available.\n2.3Bank credit not eligible for inclusion in the Housing Finance Allocation\nThe following types of bank credit for construction will not be reckoned for the\npurpose of achievement of housing finance allocation:\n(i) Housing finance granted by banks to their own employees.\n(ii) Housing finance granted to non-resident Indians ( NRIs) direct or through\nHousing Finance Institutions.\n(iii) Direct housing loans in excess of Rs. 5 lakh and Rs. 10 lakh provided in\nsemi-urban/rural areas and Urban/Metropolitan centres, respectively.\n(iv) Housing loans taken over by banks from other banks.\n(v) Industries manufacturing building material for construction.\n(vi) Construction of warehouses, including those to be constructed for Food\nCorporation of India, godowns  and cold storages .\n(vii) Buildings which do not form a part of housing project like hospitals,\nclinics, schools, colleges, markets, shopping centres and cinema houses.\n(viii) Construction of hotels and accommodation for tourist and commercial\noffices.\n(ix) Construction of hostels.\n2.4 Construction activities not eligible for bank credit\n2.4.1 Banks should not grant finance for construction of buildings meant purely for\nGovernment/Semi-Government offices, including Municipal and Panchayat offices.However, banks may grant loans for activities, which will be refinanced by\ninstitutions like NABARD.\n2.4.2 Projects undertaken by public sector entities which are not corporate bodies (i.e.\npublic sector undertakings which are not registered under Companies Act or which\nare not corporations established under the relevant statute) may not be financed by\nbanks. Even in respect of projects undertaken by corporate bodies, as defined above,\nbanks should satisfy themselves that the project is run on commercial lines and that\nbank finance is not in lieu of or to substitute budgetary resources envisaged for the\nproject. The loan could, however, supplement budgetary resources if such\nsupplementing was contemplated in the project design. Thus, in the case of a housing\nproject, where the project is run on commercial lines, and the Government is\ninterested in promoting the project either for the benefit of the weaker sections of the\nsociety or otherwise, and a part of the project cost is met by the Government through\nsubsidies made available and/or contributions to the capital of the institutions taking\nup the project, the bank finance should be restricted to an amount arrived at after\nreducing from the total project cost the amount of subsidy/capital contribution\nreceivable from the Government and any other resources proposed to be made\navailable by the Government.\n2.4.3 Banks had, in the past, sanctioned term loans to corporations set up by\nGovernment like State Police Housing Corporation, for construction of residential\nquarters for allotment to employees where the loans were envisaged to be repaid out\nof budgetary allocations. As these projects cannot be considered to be run on\ncommercial lines, it would not be in order for banks to grant loans to such projects.\n3.DIRECT HOUSING FINANCE\n3.1Direct Housing Finance refers to the finance provided to individuals or groups of\nindividual including co-operative societies.\n3.2Banks are free to evolve their own guidelines with the approval of the ir Boards on\naspects such as security, margin, age of dwelling units, repayment schedule, etc.\n3.3Ceiling on Housing Loans Per Dwelling\n(i) Semi-urban/Rural areas  - Rs. 5 lakh\n(ii) Urban/Metropolitan centres - Rs. 10 lakh\n3.4Other Guidelines\nThe following types of bank finance may be included under Direct Housing\nFinance:\n(i) Bank finance extended to a person who is already owning a house in the\ntown/village where he resides, for buying/ constructing a second house in the\nsame or other town/ village for the purpose of self occupation.\n(ii) Bank finance extended for purchase of a house by a borrower who\nproposes to let it out on rental basis on account of his posting outside theheadquarters or because he has been provided accommodation by his\nemployer.\n(iii) Bank finance extended to a person who proposes to buy an old house\nwhere he is presently residing as a tenant.\n(iv) Bank finance granted only for purchase of a plot, provided a declaration is\nobtained from the borrower that he intends to construct a house on the said\nplot, with the help of bank finance or otherwise, within a period of two years\nfrom the availment of the said finance.\n(v) Supplementary finance\n(a) Banks may consider requests for additional finance within the overall\nceiling for carrying out alterations/ additions/repairs to the house/flat\nalready financed by them.\n(b) In the case of individuals who might have raised funds for construction/\nacquisition of accommodation from other sources and need supplementary\nfinance, banks may extend such finance after obtaining pari passu or\nsecond mortgage charge over the property mortgaged in favour of other\nlenders and/or against such other security, as they may deem appropriate.\n4.INDIRECT HOUSING FINANCE\n4.1 General\nBanks should ensure that their indirect housing finance is channelled by way of\nterm loans to housing finance institutions, housing boards, other public housing\nagencies, etc., primarily for augmenting the supply of serviced land and\nconstructed units. It should also be ensured that the supply of plots/houses is time\nbound and public agencies do not utilise the bank loans merely for acquisition of\nland. Similarly, serviced plots should be sold by these agencies to co-operative\nsocieties, professional developers and individuals with a stipulation that the\nhouses should be constructed thereon within a reasonable time, not exceeding\nthree years. For this purpose, the banks may take advantage of various guidelines\nissued by NHB for augmenting the supply of serviced land and constructed units.\n4.2Lending to Housing Intermediary Agencies\n4.2.1 Lending to Housing Finance Institutions\n(i)Banks may grant term loans to housing finance institutions taking in to\naccount(long-term) debt-equity ratio, track record, recovery performance\nand other relevant factors.(ii)In terms of NHB guidelines, housing finance companies\u2019 total\nborrowings, whether by way of deposits, issue of debentures/ bonds, loans\nand advances from banks or from financial institutions but excluding any\nloans obtained from NHB, should not exceed 10 to 15 times of their net\nowned funds (i.e. paid-up capital and free reserves less accumulated balance\nof loss, deferred revenue expenditure and intangible assets).\n(iii)In respect of housing finance companies, which are eligible to draw\nrefinance from NHB, the quantum of term loan to be sanctioned to them will\nnot be linked to net owned funds as NHB has already prescribed the above\nreferred ceiling on total borrowings of housing finance companies. A list of\nhousing finance companies approved by NHB for the purpose of refinance\nmay be obtained by the banks directly from NHB.\n(iv)The quantum of term loans to be granted by banks to other housing\nfinance institutions, together with outstanding balances in the existing term\nloans, if any, from the banking system, should not exceed three times of\ntheir net owned funds as per the last audited balance sheet, within the overall\nceiling fixed by NHB.\n4.2.2 Lending to Housing Boards and Other Agencies\nBanks may extend term loans to state level housing boards and other public\nagencies. However, in order to develop a healthy housing finance system, while\ndoing so, the banks must not only keep in view the past performance of these\nagencies in the matter of recovery from the beneficiaries but they should also\nstipulate that the Boards will ensure prompt and regular recovery of loan\ninstalments  from the beneficiaries.\n4.2.3Financing of Land Acquisition\nIn view of the need to increase the availability of land and house sites for increasing\nthe housing stock in the country, banks may extend finance to public agencies for\nacquisition and development of land, provided it is a part of the complete project,\nincluding development of infrastructure such as water systems, drainage, roads,\nprovision of electricity, etc. Such credit may be extended by way of term loans. The\nproject should be completed as early as possible and, in any case, within three\nyears, so as to ensure quick re-cycling of bank funds for optimum results. If the\nproject covers construction of houses, credit extended therefor in respect of\nindividual beneficiaries should be on the same terms and conditions as stipulated\nfor direct finance.\n4.2.4 Terms and Conditions for Lending to Housing Intermediary Agencies\n(i)In order to enhance the flow of resou rces to housing sector, term loans may be\ngranted by banks to housing intermediary agencies against the direct loans\nsanctioned/ proposed to be sanctioned by the latter, irrespective of the per borrower\nsize of the loan extended by these agencies and such term loans would be reckoned\nfor the purpose of achievement of their housing finance allocation.(ii)Banks can grant term loans to housing intermediary agencies against the direct\nloans sanctioned/proposed to be sanctioned by them to Non-Resident Indians also.\nHowever, banks should ensure that housing finance intermediary agencies\nbeing financed by them, are authorised by RBI to grant housing loans to\nNRIs as all housing finance intermediaries are not authorised by RBI to\nprovide housing finance to NRIs. Further, such finance granted by banks to\nhousing finance intermediary agencies against the latters\u2019 on-lending to\nNRIs will not be treated as housing finance for the purpose of scheme of\nyearly allocation of housing finance applicable to banks.\n(iii) Banks have freedom to charge interest rates to housing intermediary agencies\nwithout reference to Prime Lending Rate (PLR).\n4.3Term Loans to Private Builders\nIn view of the important role played by professional builders as providers of\nconstruction services in the housing field, especially where land is acquired\nand developed by State Housing Boards and other public agencies,\ncommercial banks may extend credit to private builders on commercial terms\nby way of loans linked to each specific project. The period of credit for loans\nextended by banks to private builders may be decided by banks themselves\nbased on their commercial judgement subject to usual safeguards and after\nobtaining such security as banks may deem appropriate. Such credit may be\nextended to builders of repute, employing professionally qualified personnel.\nIt should be ensured, through close monitoring, that no part of such funds is\nused for any speculation in land. Care should also be taken to see that prices\ncharged from the ultimate beneficiaries do not include any speculative\nelement, that is, prices should be based only on the documented price of land,\nthe actual cost of construction and a reasonable profit margin.\n5. HOUSING LOANS UNDER PRIORITY SECTOR\n5.1The following housing finance limits will be considered as Priority Sector Advances:\n5.1.1Direct Finance\n(i)Loans up to Rs. 5 lakh in rural/semi-urban areas and up to Rs.\n10 lakh in urban/ metropolitan centres for construction of houses by\nindividuals.\n(ii)Loans up to Rs. 50,000/- for repairs to damaged houses by\nindividuals.\n5.1.2Indirect Finance\n(i)Assistance given to any governmental agency for construction\nof houses, or for slum clearance and rehabilitation of slum dwellers,\nsubject to a ceiling of Rs. 5 lakh of loan amount per housing unit.\n(ii)Assistance given to a non-governmental agency approved by\nthe National Housing Bank for the purpose of refinance forconstruction of houses or for slum clearance and rehabilitation of\nslum dwellers, subject to a ceiling of Rs. 5 lakh of loan amount per\nhousing unit.\n5.1.3Investments in Bonds\nInvestment by banks in bonds issued by NHB/HUDCO exclusively\nfor financing of housing, irrespective of the loan size per dwelling\nunit will be reckoned for inclusion under priority sector advances.\n6.RBI REFINANCE\nFinance provided by the banks would not be eligible for refinance from Reserve\nBank.\n7.REPORTING\n7.1Banks should compile the data relating to Housing Finance at half-yearly intervals on\nthe lines of format given in Annexure 1  and keep it ready for being made available to the\nbank\u2019s internal inspectors/RBI\u2019s inspectors.\n7.2For the purpose of monitoring the macro-level performance of the commercial banks\nin disbursement of housing finance vis-\u00e0-vis their housing finance allocation, banks\nshould submit, on a quarterly basis, details of disbursements made by them towards\nhousing finance, as per the format given in Annexure  2 within 20 days from the close of\nthe respective quarter.\n7.3Housing loans taken over from other banks should not be included in the quarterly\nstatement for showing the achievement of housing finance allocation.\n8. OPENING OF SPECIALISED HOUSING FINANCE BRANCHES\n8.1In view of the priority accorded to the development of housing as also to achieve\ngreater professionalism, there is a need for establishment of specialised branches at\ncertain centres exclusively to cater to housing finance. It is the intention that a housing\nfinance branch should be established in each district. But this can be brought about\ngradually based on the policies and perceptions for greater involvement of commercial\nbanks in the housing sector.\n8.2Since the housing finance is a new concept to banks, initially the opening of such\nspecialised branches may be restricted to semi-urban/urban areas and the number of such\nbranches to be allowed will depend on the size and spread of the bank. Requests for this\nkind of branch in rural area will also be considered where there is a clear need and\nassured viability. While formulating their proposals, banks may, therefore, keep in view\nthe following aspects for consideration:\n8.2.1The housing finance branch of a bank should be in any of the districts for\nwhich the bank has lead responsibility or, in the case of banks having very nominal\nlead responsibility, in districts where they have a large presence.8.2.2 Banks should avoid opening of such housing finance branches at metropolitan\ncentres which are served by quite a few specialised  housing finance companies like\nHDFC or housing finance subsidiaries of the commercial banks.\n8.2.3 The housing finance branches may be set up in areas where there is a\nconcentration of branches of the same bank designated to handle housing finance\nbusiness so that the expertise available in the specialised branch could be used for\nservicing the other designated branches.\n8.2.4While formulating their proposals, banks should, as far as possible, give\npreference to smaller urban and semi-urban centres where there is enough potential\nfor opening of such branches.\n8.2.5 The proposals should cover a ll the states to ensure a wider geographical\ndispersion of housing finance branches.\n8.2.6 The applicant bank should also explore the feasibility of converting any of its\nloss-making branches at the centre into a proposed housing finance branch. Apart\nfrom this, banks could designate one of their branches in each district for the purpose\nof housing finance in addition to their normal banking functions.\nThe availability of housing finance services at specialised branches should also be\nwidely publicised.\n8.2.7 In the interest of effecting economy in expenditure, the proposed housing\nfinance branches, as far as possible, may be accommodated in any of the existing\npremises of the bank at the centre.\n8.2.8Banks may also indicate the existing construction activi ties, likely\ndevelopment in the business, their involvement in financing such projects/\nconstruction work (whether in consortium or individual basis) at the centre.\n8.2.9National Housing Bank will be prepared to take up the task of training the\nstaff to be posted in the specialised housing finance branches so that they are\nequipped with the necessary skills for the work.\n8.3Banks should send to Reserve Bank (Department of Banking Operations and\nDevelopment), a list of centres where they would like to open specialised branches\nindicating the order of preference along with information in the proforma given in\nAnnexure 3 .\n9. HOME LOAN ACCOUNT SCHEME (HLAS) FOR NHB\n9.1Foreclosure of Loans Obtained from Other Sources\n9.1.1Under the HLAS, a member of HLAS is e ligible for a loan after subscription\nto the scheme for a minimum period of 5 years.\nThe member has to declare while joining the scheme/availing loan that he/ she\ndoes not own a house/flat. However, a member may acquire a house or a flat\nfrom a public agency/co-operative/ private builder by obtaining a loan from a\nbank at the normal rate of interest or from friends and relatives or through ahire-purchase scheme of Housing Board/ Development Authority. Thereafter,\nwhen the member becomes eligible for a loan under HLAS, he/she may\napproach the bank for such a loan to repay the loan(s) raised earlier from other\nsources.\n9.1.2There is no objection to bank loans under HLAS being utilised for foreclosing\nloans secured earlier from other sources, as a special case.\n9.2Classification of Deposits/Loans under HLAS\nUnder HLAS, the participating bank is required to accept deposits on behalf of\nNHB and make use of these deposits by way of refinance under any scheme\napproved by NHB from time to time. The surplus funds, if any, not so utilised (i.e.\nexcess of deposits over refinance) can either be remitted by the participating bank\nto NHB or retained by it, subject to compliance with the statutory reserve\nrequirements as under:\n(i) The deposits under the HLA Scheme are on a recurring basis; and they should\nbe treated as \u2018time\u2019 liabilities, subject to reserve requirements under Section\n42(1) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 as also under Section 24 of the\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949 and included under item II (a) (ii) of Form \u2018A\u2019.\n(ii) In terms of sub-clause (ii) of clause (c) of the Explanation to Sub-Section (1)\nof Section 42 of the RBI Act, as amended by clause 3 of the Second Schedule to\nthe National Housing Bank Act, 1987, \u2018liabilities\u2019 will not include any loan taken\nfrom NHB.\nHence, the deposits utilised as refinance from NHB should be deducted from the\ntotal deposits received under the HLA Scheme while including the amount under\nitem II (a) (ii) of Form \u2018A\u2019.\nAppendix\nMaster Circular\nHOUSING FINANCE\nList of Circulars consolidated in the Master Circular\nNo.Circular No. Date Subject Para No.\n1.IECD.No.8/03:27:35/ 16.11.99 Transfer of Housing Loan 2.3 (iv),\n1999-2000 Accounts vis-\u00e0-vis Housing 7.3\nFinance Allocation \u2013 Clarification\n2.IECD.No.(HF)5/03:27: 29.10.99 Housing Finance - Modification 4.2.4(i),\n25/99-2000 in Loan Size (ii)\n3.IECD.No .(HF)2/03.27. 07.08.

The Group had\nfocussed on three major areas of I-banking, i.e, (i) technology and security issues, (ii)\nlegal issues and (iii) regulatory and supervisory issues. A copy of the Group\u2019s report is\nenclosed. RBI has accepted the recommendations of the Group to be implemented  in a\nphased manner. Accordingly, the following guidelines are issued for implementation by\nbanks. Banks are also advised that they may be guided by the original report, for a\ndetailed guidance on different issues.\nI. Technology and Security Standards:\na. Banks should designate a network and database administrator with clearly defined\nroles as indicated in the Group\u2019s report. ( Para 6.2.4)\nb.  Banks should have a security policy duly approved by the Board of Directors.\nThere should be a segregation of duty of Security Officer / Group dealing\nexclusively with information systems security and Information Technology\nDivision which actually implements the computer systems. Further, Information\nSystems Auditor will audit the information systems. ( Para 6.3.10, 6.4.1)\nc.  Banks should introduce logical access controls to data, systems, application\nsoftware, utilities, telecommunication lines, libraries, system software, etc.\nLogical access control techniques may include user-ids, passwords, smart cards or\nother biometric technologies. ( Para 6.4.2)\nd. At the minimum, banks should use the proxy server type of firewall so that there\nis no direct connection between the Internet and the bank\u2019s system. It facilitates a\nhigh level of control and in-depth monitoring using logging and auditing tools.\nFor sensitive systems, a stateful inspection firewall is recommended which\nthoroughly inspects all packets of information, and past and present transactions\nare compared. These generally include a real time security alert. ( Para 6.4.3)\ne. All the systems supporting dial up services through modem on the same LAN as\nthe application server should be isolated to prevent intrusions into the network as\nthis may bypass the proxy server. ( Para 6.4.4)2\nf. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is the most favoured technology for secure\nInternet banking services. However, as it is not yet commonly available, banks\nshould use the following alternative system during the transition, until the PKI is\nput in place:\n 1. Usage of SSL (Secured Socket Layer), which ensures server\nauthentication and use of client side certificates issued by the banks\nthemselves using a Certificate Server.\n 2. The use of at least 128-bit SSL for securing browser to web server\ncommunications and, in addition, encryption of sensitive data like\npasswords in transit within the enterprise itself.    (Para 6.4.5)\ng. It is also recommended that all unnecessary services on the application server\nsuch as FTP (File Transfer Protocol), telnet should be disabled. The application\nserver should be isolated from the e-mail server. (Para 6.4.6)\nh. All computer accesses, including messages received, should be logged. Security\nviolations (suspected or attempted) should be reported and follow up action taken\nshould be kept in mind while framing future policy. Banks should acquire tools\nfor monitoring systems and the networks against intrusions and attacks. These\ntools should be used regularly to avoid security breaches. The banks should\nreview their security infrastructure and security policies regularly and optimize\nthem in the light of their own experiences and changing technologies. They\nshould educate their security personnel and also the end-users on a continuous\nbasis. (Para 6.4.7, 6.4.11, 6.4.12)\ni. The information security officer and the information system auditor should\nundertake periodic penetration tests of the system, which should include:\n 1. Attempting to guess passwords using password-cracking tools.\n 2. Search for back door traps in the programs.\n 3. Attempt to overload the system using DDoS (Distributed Denial of\nService) & DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.\n 4. Check if commonly known holes in the software, especially the browser\nand the e-mail software exist.\n 5. The penetration testing may also be carried out by engaging outside\nexperts (often called \u2018Ethical Hackers\u2019). (Para 6.4.8)\nj. Physical access controls should be strictly enforced. Physical security should\ncover all the information systems and sites where they are housed, both against\ninternal and external threats. ( Para 6.4.9)\nk. Banks should have proper infrastructure  and  schedules for backing up data. The\nbacked-up data should be periodically tested to ensure recovery without loss of\ntransactions in a time frame as given out in the bank\u2019s security policy. Business\ncontinuity should be ensured by setting up disaster recovery sites. These facilities\nshould also be tested periodically. ( Para 6.4.10)3\nl. All applications of banks should have proper record keeping facilities for legal\npurposes. It may be necessary to keep all received and sent messages both in\nencrypted and decrypted form. ( Para 6.4.13)\nm. Security infrastructure  should be properly tested before using the systems and\napplications for normal operations. Banks  should upgrade the systems by\ninstalling patches released by developers to remove bugs and loopholes, and\nupgrade to newer versions which give better security and control. ( Para 6.4.15)\nII. Legal Issues\na. Considering the legal position prevalent, there is an obligation on the part of banks\nnot only to establish the identity but also to make enquiries about integrity and\nreputation of the prospective customer. Therefore, even though request for opening\naccount can be accepted over Internet, accounts should be opened only after proper\nintroduction and physical verification of the identity of the customer. ( Para  7.2.1)\nb. From a legal perspective, security procedure adopted by banks for authenticating\nusers needs to be recognized by law as a substitute for signature. In India, the\nInformation Technology Act, 2000, in Section 3(2) provides for a particular\ntechnology (viz., the asymmetric crypto system and hash function) as a means of\nauthenticating electronic record. Any  other method used by banks for authentication\nshould be recognized as a source of legal risk.  (Para  7.3.1)\nc. Under the present regime there is an obligation on banks to maintain secrecy and\nconfidentiality of customers\u2018 accounts. In the Internet banking scenario, the risk of\nbanks not meeting the above obligation is high on account of several factors. Despite\nall reasonable precautions, banks may be exposed to enhanced risk of liability to\ncustomers on account of breach of secrecy, denial of service etc., because of hacking/\nother technological failures. The banks should, therefore, institute adequate risk\ncontrol measures to manage such risks. ( Para 7.5.1-7.5.4)\nd. In Internet banking scenario there is very little scope for the banks to act on stop-\npayment instructions from the customers. Hence, banks should clearly notify to the\ncustomers the timeframe and the circumstances in which any stop-payment\ninstructions could be accepted. ( Para 7.6.1)\ne. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 defines the rights of consumers in India and is\napplicable to banking services as well. Currently, the rights and liabilities of\ncustomers availing of Internet banking services are being determined by bilateral\nagreements between the banks and customers. Considering the banking practice and\nrights enjoyed by customers in traditional banking, banks\u2019 liability to the customers\non account of unauthorized transfer through hacking, denial of service on account of\ntechnological failure etc. needs to be assessed and banks providing Internet banking\nshould insure themselves against such risks. ( Para 7.11.1)\nIII. Regulatory and Supervisory Issues :4\nAs recommended by the Group, the existing regulatory framework over banks will be\nextended to Internet banking also. In this regard, it is advised that:\n 1. Only such banks which are licensed and supervised in India and have a physical\npresence in India will be permitted to offer Internet banking products to residents of\nIndia. Thus, both banks and virtual banks incorporated outside the country and\nhaving no physical presence in India will not, for the present, be permitted to offer\nInternet banking services to Indian residents.\n 2. The products should be restricted to account holders only and should not be\noffered in other jurisdictions.\n 3. The services should only include local currency products.\n 4. The \u2018in-out\u2019 scenario where customers in cross border jurisdictions are offered\nbanking services by Indian banks (or branches of foreign banks in India) and the\n\u2018out-in\u2019 scenario where Indian residents are offered banking services by banks\noperating in cross-border jurisdictions are generally not permitted and this\napproach will apply to Internet banking also. The existing exceptions for limited\npurposes under FEMA i.e. where resident Indians have been permitted to continue\nto maintain their accounts with overseas banks etc., will, however, be permitted.\n 5. Overseas branches of Indian banks will be permitted to offer Internet banking\nservices to their overseas customers subject to their satisfying, in addition to the\nhost supervisor, the home supervisor.\nGiven the regulatory approach as above, banks are advised to follow the following\ninstructions:\na. All banks, who propose to offer transactional services on the Internet should\nobtain prior approval from RBI. Bank\u2019s application for such permission should\nindicate its business plan, analysis of cost and benefit, operational arrangements\nlike technology adopted, business partners, third party service providers and\nsystems and control procedures the bank proposes to adopt for managing risks.\nThe bank should also submit a security policy covering recommendations made in\nthis circular and a certificate from an independent auditor that the minimum\nrequirements prescribed have been met. After the initial approval the banks will\nbe obliged to inform RBI any material changes in the services / products offered\nby them.  ( Para 8.4.1, 8.4.2)\nb. Banks will report to RBI every breach or failure of security systems and\nprocedure and the latter, at its discretion, may decide to commission special audit\n/ inspection of such banks. (Para 8.4.3)\nc. The guidelines issued by RBI on \u2018Risks and Controls in Computers and\nTelecommunications\u2019 vide circular DBS.CO.ITC.BC. 10/ 31.09.001/ 97-98 dated\n4th February 1998 will equally apply to Internet banking. The RBI as supervisor\nwill cover the entire risks associated with electronic banking as a part of its\nregular inspections of banks. ( Para 8.4.4, 8.4.5)5\nd. Banks should develop outsourcing guidelines to manage risks arising out of third\nparty service providers, such as, disruption in service, defective services and\npersonnel of service providers gaining intimate knowledge of banks\u2019 systems and\nmisutilizing the same, etc., effectively. ( Para 8.4.7)\ne. With the increasing popularity of e-commerce, it has become necessary to set up\n\u2018Inter-bank Payment Gateways\u2019 for settlement of such transactions. The protocol\nfor transactions between the customer, the bank and the portal and the framework\nfor setting up of payment gateways as recommended by the Group should be\nadopted. ( Para 8.4.7, 8.4.9.1 \u2013 8.4.9.5)\nf. Only institutions who are members of the cheque clearing system in the country\nwill be permitted to participate in Inter-bank payment gateways for Internet\npayment. Each gateway must nominate a bank as the clearing bank to settle all\ntransactions. Payments effected using credit cards, payments arising out of cross\nborder e-commerce transactions and all intra-bank payments (i.e., transactions\ninvolving only one bank) should be excluded for settlement through an inter-bank\npayment gateway. ( Para 8.4.7 )\ng. Inter-bank payment gateways must have capabilities for both net and gross\nsettlement. All settlement should be intra-day and as far as possible, in real time.\n(Para  8.4.7)\nh. Connectivity between the gateway and the computer system of the member bank\nshould be achieved using a leased line network (not through Internet) with\nappropriate data encryption standard. All transactions must be authenticated.\nOnce, the regulatory framework is in place, the transactions should be digitally\ncertified by any licensed certifying agency. SSL / 128 bit encryption must be used\nas minimum level of security. Reserve Bank may get the security of the entire\ninfrastructure both at the payment gateway\u2019s end and the participating\ninstitutions\u2019 end certified prior to making the facility available for customers use.\n(Para 8.4.7 )\ni. Bilateral contracts between the payee and payee\u2019s bank, the participating banks\nand service provider and the banks themselves will form the legal basis for such\ntransactions. The rights and obligations of each party must be clearly defined and\nshould be valid in a court of law. ( Para 8.4.7)\nj. Banks must make mandatory disclosures of risks, responsibilities and liabilities of\nthe customers in doing business through Internet through a disclosure template.\nThe banks should also provide their latest published financial results over the net.\n(Para 8.4.8)\nk. Hyperlinks from banks\u2019 websites, often raise the issue of reputational risk. Such\nlinks should not mislead the customers into believing that banks sponsor any\nparticular product or any business unrelated to banking.  Hyperlinks from a\nbanks\u2019 websites should be confined to only those portals with which they have a\npayment arrangement or sites of their subsidiaries or principals. Hyperlinks to6\nbanks\u2019 websites from other portals are normally meant for passing on information\nrelating to purchases made by banks\u2019 customers in the portal. Banks must follow\nthe minimum recommended security precautions while dealing with request\nreceived from other websites, relating to customers\u2019 purchases. ( Para 8.4.9)\n2. The Reserve Bank of India have decided that the Group\u2019s recommendations as detailed\nin this circulars should be adopted by all banks offering Internet banking services, with\nimmediate effect.  Even though the recommendations have been made in the context of\nInternet banking, these are applicable, in general, to all forms of electronic banking and\nbanks offering any form of electronic banking should adopt the same to the extent\nrelevant.\n3. All banks offering Internet banking are advised to make a review of their systems in\nthe light of this circular and report to Reserve Bank the types of services offered, extent\nof their compliance with the recommendations, deviations and their proposal indicating a\ntime frame for compliance. The first such report must reach us within one month from the\ndate of this circular. Banks not offering any kind of I-banking may submit a \u2018nil\u2019 report.\n4. Banks who are already offering any kind of transactional service are advised to report,\nin addition to those mentioned in paragraph above, their business models with projections\nof cost / benefits etc. and seek our post-facto approval.\n5.

Srinivasan)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nEncls: As above", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/21569.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 14, 2001", "info": "Income recognition, asset classification and\nprovisioning norms for advances\nDBOD.BP.BC.  132 / 21.04.048/ 2000-2001\nJune 14, 2001\nAll Commercial Banks   (excluding RRBs)\nDear Sir,\nIncome recognition, asset classification and\nprovisioning norms for advances\nAs you are aware, the prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and\nprovisioning introduced in 1992, eliminated the subjective element in these areas and introduced\nobjectivity to a large extent. The identification of a Non Performing Asset (NPA), which is the\nbasis for application of the prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and\nprovisioning, is based on the record of recovery and was expected to enable the banks to apply\nthe norms in a uniform manner.  However, in practice, there are instances of non-compliance\nwith the prudential requirements by banks and also divergence in the assessment of NPAs by\nbanks, Statutory Auditors and RBI Inspecting Officers. The Board for Financial Supervision of\nRBI, therefore, desired that causes for the persistence of divergences in assessment of NPAs\nshould be examined. As a sequel, a Working Group was constituted by the RBI in March 2000,\nwith Shri P.R. Khanna, Chartered Accountant, as Chairman, to   broadly   examine   the   causes\nfor divergence in asset classification and make suitable recommendations to narrow down the\ndivergences.\n2. The Working Group has since submitted its recommendations. The Group\u2019s analysis shows\nthat the divergence in asset classification and provisioning requirement has been arising\nprimarily due to the following factors:\ni) Non compliance with RBI guidelines.\nii) Subjectivity arising out of some flexibility in the guidelines issued by RBI on income\nrecognition, asset classification and provisioning.\niii) Differences in valuation of security by banks, Statutory Auditors and   RBI.\n3. The recommendations of the Group were recently discussed by RBI with a cross section of\nbanks. The banks generally expressed their agreement with the recommendations and also\nsuggested a few minor changes, with a view to further eliminating the divergences. It has now\nbeen decided to make the following modifications to strengthen the systems in banks and issue\ncertain clarifications in a question- answer format on  the instructions already  issued.\n(A)  Divergence due  to non compliance with RBI guidelines\nThe periodical inspections of RBI have brought out instances of deviation on income\nrecognition, asset classification and provisioning even where the instructions are clear and\nunambiguous. Banks should ensure scrupulous compliance with the instructions for recognition\nof credit impairment and view aberrations by dealing officials seriously. The elimination of\ndivergences in asset classification of larger credit limits should help the banks to institutionalise2\nconscious efforts towards compliance with prudential guidelines at all levels, for the entire asset\nportfolio, in due course. It is, therefore, advised that:\n(i) Banks should establish appropriate internal systems to eliminate the tendency to delay or\npostpone the identification of NPAs, especially in respect of high value accounts.  The banks\nmay fix a minimum cut off point to decide what would constitute a high value account depending\nupon their respective business levels. The cut off point should be valid for the entire accounting\nyear.\n(ii) Responsibility and validation levels for ensuring proper asset classification may be fixed\nby the bank.\n(iii)   The system should ensure that doubts in asset classification due to any reason are settled\nthrough specified internal channels within one month from the date on which the account would\nhave been classified as NPA as per extant  guidelines.\nRBI would continue to identify the divergences arising due to non-compliance, for fixing\naccountability. Where there is wilful non-compliance by the official responsible for classification\nand is well documented, RBI would initiate deterrent action including imposition of monetary\npenalties.\n(B) Divergence arising out of flexibility in the instructions issued by RBI on income\nrecognition, asset classification and provisioning\nBased on the discussions, the Group identified RBI instructions on prudential norms which lent\nscope for difference in interpretation between banks, Statutory Auditors and Inspecting Officers\nof RBI. In the light of the recommendations of the Group, it has been decided to clarify some of\nthe extant guidelines on prudential norms relating to income recognition, asset classification and\nprovisioning issued vide our Circular DBOD.No. BP. BC. 9 / 21.04.048/ 97 dated 29 January\n1997.\n(i)      Temporary irregularities   [para 2 (a) of the Circular]\nQ: Whether a working capital account will become a NPA if the stock statements are not\nsubmitted regularly?  What should be the period for which the stock statements can be in arrears\nbefore the account is treated as a NPA?\nA: Banks should ensure that drawings in the working capital accounts are covered by the\nadequacy of current assets, since current assets are first appropriated in times of distress.\nConsidering the practical difficulties of large borrowers, stock statements relied upon by the\nbanks for determining drawing power should not be older than three months.   The outstandings\nin the account based on drawing power calculated from stock statements older than three  months,\nwould be deemed as irregular.  A working capital borrowal account will become NPA if such\nirregular drawings are permitted in the account for a continuous period of 180 days even though\nthe unit may be working or the borrower's financial position is satisfactory.\nQ: Whether an account will become a NPA if the review/ renewal of regular/ adhoc credit limits\nare not done when due? What should be the periodicity of review/ renewal to decide the present\nstatus of an account?3\nA: Regular and adhoc credit limits need to be reviewed/ regularised not later than three months\nfrom the due date/date of adhoc sanction.  In case of constraints such as non-availability of\nfinancial statements and other data from the borrowers, the branch should furnish evidence to\nshow that renewal/ review of credit limits is already on and would be completed soon.  In any\ncase, delay beyond six months is not considered desirable as a general discipline. Hence, an\naccount where the regular/ adhoc credit limits have not been reviewed/ renewed within 180 days\nfrom the due date/ date of adhoc sanction will  be treated as NPA.\n(ii)    Regularisation of the account around  the date of  balance    sheet   [para  2 (c )  of the\nCircular ]\nQ:  Whether it will be in order to treat a borrowal account as \u2018standard\u2019 if it has been irregular for\na major part of the year, but has been regularised near the balance sheet date?\nA: The asset classification of borrowal accounts where a solitary or a few credits are recorded\nbefore the balance sheet date should be handled with care and without scope for subjectivity.\nWhere the account indicates inherent weakness on the basis of the data available, the account\nshould be deemed as a NPA.  In other genuine cases, the banks must furnish satisfactory\nevidence to the Statutory Auditors/Inspecting Officers about the manner of regularisation of the\naccount to eliminate doubts on their performing status.\n(iii)    Classification of NPAs where there is a threat to recovery\n         [para  2 (d) of the Circular ]\nQ: How should the instructions on classification of NPA straightaway as doubtful or a loss asset\nbe interpreted and what can be termed as a \u2018significant\u2019 credit impairment\u2019?\nA: The circular provides that a NPA need not go through the various stages of classification in\ncase of serious credit impairment and such assets should be straightaway classified as a doubtful/\nloss asset as appropriate. Erosion in the value of security can be reckoned as significant when the\nrealisable value of the security is less than 50 per cent of the value assessed by the bank or\naccepted by RBI at the time of last inspection, as the case may be. Such NPAs may be\nstraightaway classified under doubtful category  and provisioning should be made as applicable\nto doubtful assets.\n(C)Absence of specific  guidelines  on certain  issues\n(i)     Classification of credit facilities under consortium\nQ: In certain cases of consortium accounts, though the record of recovery in the account with a\nmember bank may suggest that the account is a NPA, the banks submit that, at times, the\nborrower has deposited adequate funds with the consortium leader/ member of the consortium\nand the bank\u2019s share is due for receipt.  In such cases, will it be in order for the member bank to\nclassify the account as \u2018standard\u2019 in its books?\nA: As already clarified at item 2 (b) of our Circular DBOD. No. BP. BC. 9/ 21.04.048/ 97 dated\n29 January 1997, asset classification of accounts under consortium should be based on the\nrecord of recovery of the individual member banks  and other aspects having a bearing on the\nrecoverability of the advances . Where the remittances by the borrower under consortium lending\narrangements are pooled with one bank and/or where the bank receiving remittances is not4\nparting with the share of other member banks, the account will be treated as not serviced in the\nbooks of the other member banks and therefore, be treated as NPA. The banks participating in\nthe consortium should, therefore, arrange to get their share of recovery transferred from the lead\nbank or get an express consent from the lead bank for the transfer of their share of recovery, to\nensure proper asset classification in their respective books.\n(ii)  Appropriation of Recoveries\nQ: What is the practice to be adopted by banks regarding appropriation of    recoveries in NPA\naccounts   (i.e. towards principal or interest).\nA: In the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the borrower for the purpose, banks\nshould adopt an accounting principle and exercise the right of appropriation of recoveries in a\nuniform  and consistent  manner.\n(iii)   Activities allied to agriculture\nQ: The guidelines conveyed vide Circular DBOD. No. BP. BC. 17/ 21.04.048/ 98 dated 4 March\n1998 stipulate the income recognition/ asset classification norm of two harvest seasons/ two half-\nyears for direct agricultural loans. Whether the same norm can be extended to floriculture and\nallied agriculture activities like poultry, animal husbandry etc.?\nA. It is clarified that the above norms should be made applicable only in respect of short term\nagricultural loans for production and marketing of seasonal agricultural crops such as paddy,\nwheat, oilseeds, sugarcane etc. In respect of other activities like horticulture, floriculture or allied\nactivities such as animal husbandry, poultry farming etc., assessment of NPA would be done as\nin the case of other advances.\n(iv)   Overdues in other credit facilities\nQ: There are instances where banks park the dues from a borrower in respect of devolved letters\nof credit and invoked guarantees in a separate account, irrespective of whether the borrower\u2019s\ncredit facilities are regular or not. How to determine when the account in which such dues are\nparked has become a NPA?\nA: A number of banks adopt the practice of parking the dues of the borrower in respect of\ndevolved letters of credit and invoked guarantees in a separate account which is not a regular\nsanctioned facility. As a result these are not reflected in the principal operating account of the\nborrower. This renders application of the prudential norms for identification of NPAs difficult. It\nis, therefore, advised that if the debits arising out of devolvement  of letters of credit or invoked\nguarantees are parked in a separate account, the balance outstanding in that account also should\nbe treated as a part of the borrower\u2019s principal operating account for the purpose of application\nof prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning.\n(v)  Treatment of loss assets\nQ: A NPA account will be classified as a loss asset only when there is no security in the account\nor where there is considerable erosion in the realisable value of the security in the account. What\ncan be termed as a \u2018considerable\u2019 erosion for the account to be classified as a loss asset?\nA: If the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank/ approved valuers/ RBI is less\nthan 10 per cent of the outstandings in the borrowal accounts, the existence of security should be5\nignored and the asset should be straightaway classified as loss asset. It may be either written off\nor fully provided for by the bank.\n(D)  Valuation of security\nQ: A major source of divergence in provisioning requirement was the realisable value of the\nprimary and collateral security. Can uniform guidelines be prescribed for adoption in this area, at\nleast for large value accounts?\nA: With a view to bringing down divergence arising out of difference in assessment of the value\nof security it has been decided that in cases of NPAs with balance of Rs. 5 crore and above;\na) The current assets and their valuation are looked into at the time of Statutory Audit.\nHowever, in order to enhance the reliability on stock valuations, stock    audit   at   annual\nintervals   by   external agencies appointed as per the guidelines approved by the Board would be\nmandatory.\nb) Collaterals such as immovable properties charged in favour of the bank should be got\nvalued once in three years by valuers appointed as per the guidelines  approved by the Board of\nDirectors.\n4.

Banks have also been advised vide\npara 4 of our circular DBOD. No. BP .(SC).BC.98 / 21.04.103/ 99 dated October 7, 1999 on Risk\nManagement Guidelines to look into  specific risk management aspects while processing investment\nproposals.\n2. A recent review of the non-SLR investment portfolio of banks has revealed that some banks\nhave made significant investment in privately placed unrated bonds and, in certain cases, in bonds\nissued by corporates who are not their borrowers. While assessing such investment proposals on\nprivate placement basis, in the absence of standardised and mandated disclosures, including credit\nrating, banks may not be in a position to conduct proper due diligence to take an investment decision.\nThus, there could be deficiencies in the appraisal of privately placed issues. While it is not the intention\nto prohibit banks from subscribing to unrated instruments on private placement basis, however, as\nsuch investments could cause some concern, banks should put in place appropriate systems to ensure\nthat investment in privately placed unrated instruments is made in accordance with the systems and\nprocedures prescribed under the respective bank\u2019s investment policy approved by the Board.\n3. Further, the risk arising from inadequate disclosure in offer documents should be recognised\nand banks should prescribe minimum disclosure standards as a policy  with  Board approval.  In this\nconnection, we may state that Reserve Bank of India had constituted a Technical Group comprising\nofficials drawn from treasury departments of a few banks and experts on corporate finance to study ,\ninter-alia,  the methods of acquiring, by banks, of non-SLR investments in general and private\nplacement route, in particular and to suggest measures for regulating these investments. The Group had\ndesigned a format containing the minimum disclosure requirements as well as certain conditionalities\nregarding documentation and creation of charge for private placement issues, which may serve as a\n'best practice model'  for the banks.  We enclose the details of the Group\u2019s recommendations in the\nAnnexure and advise that  banks may introduce with immediate effect  suitable format of disclosure\nrequirements on the lines of the recommendations of the Technical Group with the approval of their\nBoard.\n4. With a view to ensuring that the investments by banks i n unrated issues through private\nplacement, both of the borrower customers and non-borrower customers, do not give rise to systemic\nconcerns, it is necessary  that banks should ensure that their investment policies duly approved by the\nBoard of Directors are formulated after taking into account the following aspects:2\na) The Boards of banks should lay down policy and prudential limits on investments in\nbonds and debentures including cap on unrated issues and on private placement basis, sub limits\nfor PSU bonds, corporate bonds, guaranteed bonds, issuer ceiling, etc.\nb) Investment proposals should be subjected to the same degree of credit risk analysis as\nany loan proposal.  Banks should make their own internal credit analysis and rating even in\nrespect of rated issues and should not entirely rely on the ratings of external agencies. The\nappraisal should be more stringent in respect of investments in instruments issued by non-\nborrower customers.\nc) In case of unrated issues or issues of companies who are not their borrowers, banks\nshould have an internal system of rating.  For this purpose, banks should insist on obtaining\nadequate information from the issuers in a suitable manner as indicated in paragraph 3 above.\nd) As a matter of prudence, banks should stipulate entry level minimum ratings/ quality\nstandards and industry-wise, maturity-wise ,  duration-wise, issuer-wise etc. limits  to mitigate\nthe adverse impacts of concentration and the risk of illiquidity. The  investments in unrated\nprivately placed bonds and debentures should be well diversified.\n(e) The banks should put in place proper risk management systems for capturing and\nanalysing the risk in respect of these investments and taking remedial measures in time. The\n'rating' migration of the issuers and the consequent diminution in the portfolio quality should\nalso be tracked at periodic intervals.\n5.  These instructions may be placed before the Investment Committee /  Board of Directors of the bank\nfor their information.\n6.    Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(M.R. Srinivasan)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nEncls:  As above\nANNEXURE\nRecommendations of the Group on Non-SLR investments of banks\nPro-forma of minimum disclosure requirements in respect of private placement issues - Model\nOffer Document\nAll issuers must issue an offer document with terms of issue, authorised by Board Resolution not older\nthan 6 months from the date of issue.  The offer document should specifically mention the Board\nResolution authorising the issue and designations of the officials who are authorised to issue the offer\ndocument.  The offer document may be printed or typed \u201cFor Private Circulation Only\u201d.  The Offer3\nDocument should be signed by the authorised signatory. The offer document should contain the\nfollowing minimum information :\nI.  General Information\n1. Name and address of registered office of the company\n2. Full names (expanded initials), addresses of Directors and the names of companies where\nthey are Directors.\n3. Listing of the issue (If listed, name of the Exchange)\n4.

Name address of the trustee \u2013 consent letter to be produced (in case of debenture issue)\n7. Rating from any Rating Agency and / or copy of the rationale of latest rating.\nII. Particulars of the issue\na) Objects\nb) Project cost and means of financing (including contribution of promoters) in case of new\nprojects.\nIII. The model offer document should also contain the following information :\n(1)  Interest rate payable on application money till the date of allotment.\n(2) Security : If it is a secured issue, the issue is to be secured, the offer documents should  mention\ndescription of security, type of security, type of charge, Trustees, private charge-holders, if any, and\nlikely date of creation of security, minimum security cover, revaluation, if any.\n(3) If the security is collateralised by a guarantee, a copy of the guarantee or principal terms of the\nguarantee are to be included in the offer document.\n(4) Interim Accounts, if any.\n(5) Summary of last audited Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account with qualifications by Auditors,\nif any.\n(6) Last two published Balance Sheet may be enclosed.\n(7) Any conditions relating to tax exemption, capital adequacy etc. are to be brought out fully in the\ndocuments.\n(8) The following details in case of companies undertaking major expansion or new projects :- (copy of\nproject appraisal may be made available on request)4\na) Cost of the project, with sources and uses of funds\nb) Date of commencement with projected cash flows\nc) Date of financial closure (details of commitments by other institutions to be provided)\nd) Profile of the project (technology, market etc)\ne) Risk factors\n(9)  If the instrument is of tenor of 5 years or more, projected cash flows .\nIV .Banks may agree to insist upon the following conditionalities\n     for issues under private placements\nAll the issuers in particular private sector corporates, should be willing to execute a subscription\nagreement in case of all secured debt issues, pending the execution of Trust Deed and charge\ndocuments.  A standardised subscription agreement may be used by the banks, inter- alia, with the\nfollowing important provisions.\n(a)  Letter of Allotment should be made within 30 days of allotment. Execution of Trust\nDeed and charge documents will be completed and debentures certificates will be despatched\nwithin the time limit laid down in the Companies Act but not exceeding in any case, 6 months\nfrom the date of the subscription agreement.\n(b) In case of delay in complying with the above, the company will refund the amount of\nsubscription with agreed rate of interest, or, will pay penal interest of 2% over the coupon rate\ntill the above conditions are complied with, at the option of the bank.\n(c) Pending creation of security, during the period of 6 months (or extended period), the\nprincipal Directors of the company should agree to indemnify the bank for any loss that may be\nsuffered by the bank on account of the subscription to their debt issue.  (This condition will not\napply to PSUs).\n(d) It will be the company\u2019s responsibility to obtain consent of the prior charge-holders for\ncreation of security within the stipulated period.  Individual banks may insist upon execution of\nsubscription agreement or a suitable letter to comply with the terms of offer such as\nappointment of trustee, creation of security etc. on the above lines.\n(e) Rating : The Group recommends that the extant regulations of SEBI in regard to rating\nof all debt instruments in public offers would be made applicable to private placement also.\nThis stipulation will also apply to preference shares which are redeemable after 18 months.\n(f) Listing : Currently, there is a lot of flexibility regarding listing required by banks in\nprivate placement issues.  However, the Group recommends that listing of companies should be\ninsisted upon, ( exceptions, if any, to this rule shall be provided in the Investment Policy of the\nbanks) which would in due course help develop secondary market.  The advantage of listing\nwould be  that the listed companies would be required to disclose information periodically to\nthe Stock Exchanges which would also help develop the secondary markets by way of investor\ninformation.  In fact, SEBI has advised all the Stock Exchanges that all listed companies should\npublish unaudited  financial results on a quarterly basis and that they should inform the Stock\nExchanges immediately of all events which would have a bearing on the\nperformance/operations of the company as well as price sensitive information.\n(g) Security / documentation : To ensure that the documentation is completed and security\nis created in time, the Group has made recommendations which is contained in this model offer\ndocument.  It may be noted that in case of delay in execution of Trust Deed and Charge\ndocuments, the company will refund the subscription with agreed rate of interest or will pay\npenal interest of 2% over the coupon rate till these conditions are complied with at the option of5\nthe bank.  Moreover, Principal Directors of the company will have to agree to indemnify the\nbank for any loss that may be suffered by the bank on account of the subscription to the debt\nissue during the period of 6 months (or extended period) pending creation of security.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/21439.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 28, 2001", "info": "Annexure\n                                                         For office use only\nThe Regional Director,                           |------------------|\nReserve Bank of India,                           | Regn no.          |\nPublic Debt Office,                              |                  |\nFort,                                            |------------------|\nMumbai - 400 001.\nDear Sir,\nTender for 20-year Government Stock for an aggregate amount\nof Rs.2,000 crore : Auction to be held on May 29,2001.\n    \n        Pursuant to Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of\nEconomic Affairs Notification No 4(7)-W&M/2001(1) dated May 25, 2001\nand the tender notice issued by you, I/we, the undersigned hereby offer\nto purchase the 20-year Government Stock, at the auction to be held by\nyou on the captioned date as set out below :\ni)    Name\n      Constituents Name $$\nii)   Address\n                                               /-------------------\\\niii)  SGL Code, if any                         |                   |\n                                               \\-------------------/\niv)   Telephone No.\nv)    Nominal value of the                     /-------------------\\\n      Government Stock                         | Rs.                |\n      required                                 \\-------------------/\nvi)   Yield per cent per annum desired         /-------------------\\\n      to be earned thereon (expressed          |                   |\n      up to two decimal points).                \\-------------------/\nvii)  Place at which interest\n      should be paid\n    Undertaking\n1.

The Working\nGroup submitted its Report to IBA in May 1999 and the same was circulated by\nIBA among member banks for necessary action. Further, Government of India has\nalso conferred industry status to the \u2018Entertainment Industry including Films\u2019.\nHowever, despite the above developments, film financing has not made much\nheadway so far.\n2. Against this background, it is felt desirable to formulate, for the\ninformation of banks, guidelines on various aspects of lending to film industry so\nthat banks may participate in financing this important economic activity.\nAccordingly, RBI, after extensive consultations with banks, IBA and\nrepresentatives of film industry, has framed broad guidelines regarding bank\nfinance for production of films, which are set out in the enclosed memorandum.\nIt may, however, be stated that the stance of Reserve Bank\u2019s policy of bestowing\noperational freedom to banks in the matter of credit dispensation remains\nunchanged and that banks are free to take lending decisions based on their own\nexperience and other relevant information without reference to Reserve Bank,\nkeeping in view the spirit of the guidelines.\n3. The guidelines will be reviewed after a year based on the feedback received\nfrom the banks.\n4. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,(S.S.Gangopadhyay)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nGuidelines for financing film production\nIntroduction\n1.1  Film production constitutes the most important part of film industry. Film\nproduction involves development of story, screenplay, dialogue, etc., music\nrecording, film shooting, lab processing and post production activities such as\nediting, dubbing, re-recording, mixing, taking final prints, obtaining censor\nclearance and release of prints for distribution. Under the existing financing\npractices followed in the industry, the producers normally bring in about 25 per\ncent of the cost of production of a film and, the balance 75 per cent is met by way\nof advance payments from distributors and finance from private financiers. A\npeculiar feature of film production is that the producer recovers the entire cost of\nproduction of a film before / at the time of release of the film through sale of\ndistribution rights to the  distributors (normally distributors pay up to 40 per cent\nof the agreed amount when the film is under production and the balance at the\ntime of the release of the film).\n1.2 Given the need for institutional finance for film production, the broad\nguidelines for financing this activity are enumerated in the following paragraphs.\n2. Eligibility\n\u2022 Banks may provide finance to film producers (corporate as well as non-\ncorporate entities) with good track record in the relative field.\n\u2022 Banks may also provide finance to these entities for production of films\nin participation with the National Film Development Corporation (please\nsee item 4).\n3. Direct Finance for Film Production\n3.1 Criteria for financing\n\u2022 Banks may obtain from the producers a detailed budget for each film,\nclearly indicating the entire cost estimates for the film and the means of\nfinancing the same.\n\u2022 Ordinarily producers are required to bring in at least 25 per cent of the\nproject cost as promoters' contribution. Producers are also required to tie\nup the advances from the Distributors in the usual course as per usualpractice (sales advances) to cover 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the budget.\nThus, bank advances could be for the balance requirement of 35 per\ncent to 40 per cent of the project cost. However, in deserving cases\nwhere the banks are quite comfortable with the project as well as the\nbackground of the producers, the financing could be increased up to\n50 per cent of the project cost on merits .\n\u2022 Banks may provide finance to such of the projects where the total\ncost of production of a film does not exceed Rs.10 crore. The amount\nsanctioned should be within the overall ceiling of the prudential exposure\nnorms prescribed by RBI from time to time. Banks may also internally\nprescribe a suitable limit for their overall exposure to the film industry.\n\u2022 The disbursement of bank loan should ordinarily start only after utilising\nthe promoter\u2019s contribution and advance payments from the distributors.\nThere may not, however, be any objection to bank loan being disbursed\nside by side along with payments by distributors on proportionate basis.\nThe arrangement should be firmed up at the commencement of the\nproject. However, in any case, banks may disburse loan only after the\npromoter has brought in his contribution to the project.\n  3.2  Period of Loan\n The period of loan may be fixed based on the financing bank's assessment\nof cash generation of the project.\n3.3 Security\n\u2022 Banks may obtain the Laboratory Letter conveying rights on the\nnegatives in favour of the lenders.\n\u2022 The Music Audio/Video rights, CD/ DVD/internet rights, Satellite Rights,\nChannel Rights, Export/International Rights, etc.  should also be assigned\nto the banks to serve as main security along with the negative rights in the\nform of lab letter, through appropriate documentation.\n\u2022 First hypothecation charge on all the tangible movable assets under the\nproject.\n\u2022 Assignment of all agreements and Intellectual Property Rights ( IPRs) in\nfavour of the lenders.  Lenders to have right in negotiation of valuation of\nall IPRs.\n\u2022  Collaterals, if necessary, may be obtained at the discretion of banks.\u2022 A Trust & Retention Account ( TRA) may be maintained for all capital as\nwell as revenue inflows and outflows.  Thus, receivables on sale of all\nIPRs may be credited to TRA.  The modalities of TRA may be worked\nout on case-to-case basis to the satisfaction of the lenders.  A No\nObjection Certificate ( NOC) from all concerned parties for the TRA\narrangement will be required.  The lenders will have first charge on the\nTRA.\n\u2022 Banks may look into the legal aspects of the laboratory letter, assignment\nof music, audio/video rights, etc.\n3.4 Insurance\nThe existing insurance products as acceptable to banks may be obtained\nfrom film producers.\n3.5 Follow-up/ Monitoring\nBanks should devise appropriate accounting and information/data\nsubmission formats for periodic flow of information from the producers. They\nshould also obtain periodical progress reports, cash flow statements, audit reports\nand such other reports as are considered necessary. Banks may also consider\nappointing specialised  agencies for monitoring the timely shooting/processing of\nthe film and assessing the reasonableness of the expenditure.\n3.6 Risk factors\nProduction completion risk is one of the major risks in any film\nproduction.  To mitigate this risk, it would be necessary for banks to carefully\nappraise the projects having due regard to the track record of the producers as also\nthe distributors. If necessary, banks may also engage industry specialists\n/consultants for evaluation of proposals. Insurance of risks, key personnel, etc.\nneeds to be organised.  Pending development of appropriate risk insurance\nproducts, the existing products such as equipment insurance, key personnel\ninsurance, etc. could be availed of.\n4. Finance through NFDC/to NFDC\n4.1   The National Film Development Corporation Ltd. ( NFDC) is a specialised\nagency set up by Government of India for promoting quality cinema.  NFDC\nproduces, co-produces and finances films, particularly small budget films. Over\nthe years, it has provided a wide range of services essential for the integrated\ngrowth of Indian cinema.  Considering that appraisal of film projects requiresspecial skills (which all banks may not be equipped with, at least in the initial\nyears), banks, at the request of NFDC, may also consider extending credit for\nproduction of films in participation with NFDC. This would be an additional\nchannel for extending credit to the film industry. The detailed modalities in this\nregard (including security cover) may be worked out mutually by banks and\nNFDC.\n4.2Banks may also consider providing reasonable credit facility to NFDC\ntaking into account usual safeguards observed while taking credit exposure.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/20730.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 14, 2001", "info": "Export of goods and services against repayment of\nState credit granted by erstwhile Soviet Union\nA.P.(DIR Series) Circular No.33  (May 10, 2001 )\nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA\nEXCHANGE CONTROL DEPARTMENT\nCENTRAL OFFICE\nMUMBAI  400 001\nA.P.(DIR Series) Circular No.33\nMay 10, 2001\nTo\nAll Authorised Dealers in Foreign Exchange\nDear Sirs\nExport of goods and services against repayment of\nState credit granted by erstwhile Soviet Union\nAttention of authorised dealers is drawn to Annexure I to A.D.(G.P.Series) circular\nNo.4 dated May 19, 1999, indicating names of nominated banks in India for handling\nmatters relating to exports to Russia against repayment of State credit.\n2.

The study report was circulated to banks for their comments and\nsuggestions.  Based on the response received from banks, it has been decided that banks\nshould adopt the following additional safeguards to ensure that their credit card operations\nare run on sound, prudent and profitable lines.\n(i) Recovery of overdues\n\u2022 Credit card debt is an unsecured line of credit.  Repayment of credit card dues depends\nprimarily upon the card holders\u2019 capacity to repay. The highly competitive environment\nin credit card business has provided customers with opportunity to hold more than one\ncredit cards from different banks with the intention to pay only minimum monthly\npayments on outstanding balances.  As a result, the card holders are often overextended\nand  unable to repay the dues in full.  As banks are aware, credit card operations entail\ncredit risk in their overall credit portfolio. Relaxed underwriting standards, aggressive\nsolicitation programmes, inadequate account management increase credit risk and may\nlead to overdues and non-performing assets in the credit card portfolios of banks.  It is\ntherefore imperative that banks take immediate steps to reduce the incidence of default in\nthis business and closely monitor the recovery of credit card outstandings.  Banks may\nformulate specific Action Plans to this effect with the approval of their Board of\nDirectors.\n\u2022 Banks are advised to observe the code of ethics formulated by the Indian Banks\u2019\nAssociation while engaging recovery agents for collection of credit card overdues.\n(ii) Sharing of information on credit card holders\nCredit Information Bureaus are now  being set up to provide a mechanism for mitigating\ncredit risk by enhancing the quality of credit decisions and help in curbing the growth of fresh\nnon-performing assets.  Banks are advised to become members of one or more Credit\nInformation Bureaus in order to maintain the selectivity of customers in their credit card\nbusiness.  Banks are also advised to take advantage of the existing negative file projects to\nguard against defaults in this business.\n(iii) Fraud ControlThe common methods of fraudulent usage of credit cards include the following:\n\u2022 Fraud at application stage\n\u2022 Misuse of lost/stolen cards and cards not received by genuine applicants\n\u2022 Counterfeit and altered cards\n\u2022 Merchants acting in collusion with card holder\nBanks are advised to set up internal control systems to combat frauds committed through the\nabove or other methods.  Fraud prevention committees/task forces are in existence which\nformulate laws to prevent frauds and take proactive fraud control and enforcement measures.\nBanks are advised to actively participate in  such fraud prevention committees/task forces.\n(iv)  Processing\nIn order to provide efficient back office solution to the cards management process and in the\nareas of accounts receivables, billing, settlement and other related services it is necessary that\nbanks have in place a proper processing solution.  Banks are advised to make use of\ndevelopments in this area to ensure better operating controls.\n(v) Fees/Charges on credit cards\nFees are charged by banks for services in respect of credit card operations.  These include\nmembership/entrance fees, renewal/annual fees, service charges on revolving credit facility\nand penal charges for overdue payments.  Disputes often occur between card issuing banks\nand card holders regarding the basic level of penal charges. Banks are advised to clearly spell\nout fees/charges to the cardholder at the time of their applying for credit card, if not done so\nfar.  In particular, banks should bring to the notice of the cardholder, the rates of interest to be\ncharged in case of delays and default in payments, besides the membership/renewal fees.\n2.

BP.

Based on the feed back received\nfrom banks and market participants on the recommendations made by the Technical Committee\nand on the amendments proposed to the earlier guidelines, Reserve Bank of India has since\nrevised the guidelines on banks\u2019 investment in shares and financing of equities. In this\nconnection, a reference is also invited to paragraph 105 of the Statement on Monetary and Credit\nPolicy for the year 2001-2002. The revised guidelines are enclosed in the Annexure for\ncompliance by banks and are in supersession of earlier circular DBOD. BP. BC. 51/ 21.04. 137/\n2000-01 dated November 10, 2000.\n2. The revised guidelines include certain \u201cTransitional Provisions\u201d in order to ensure smooth\ntransition to the new guidelines and to provide sufficient time to banks to adjust  their portfolio\nof investment in shares and advances / guarantees against shares.\n3. The CMDs / CEOs of banks are requested to give their personal attention  particularly to the\nprovisions relating to putting in place the risk management and internal control systems\nenunciated in paragraph 12 of the revised guidelines.\n4.  This circular may please be put up before the Board of Directors at its next meeting.\n5.  Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n( M.R. Srinivasan)\nChief General Manager-in- Charge.\nAnnexure\nReserve Bank of India\nDepartment  of  Banking  Operations  and  Development(DBO&D)\nCentral Office2\nRevised Guidelines on Bank Financing of Equities and Investments in Shares\nreferred to in  circular  DBOD. BP. BC. 119 / 21.04.137 / 2000-2001\n dated May 11 ,  2001\nCoverage of the Guidelines\n1. Broadly, banks can acquire shares, debentures and units of mutual funds etc., for three\ndifferent purposes :\n(a)  for  making direct investment in shares / debentures etc. at bank\u2019s own risk;\n(b)  for making loans and advances to individuals and sharebroking entities for the purpose of\nmaking investment in capital markets on their own account. Here, the investment risk is that of\nthe individual or stock- broking entities. Loans / advances by banks are normally fixed in value\nand carry the stipulated interest rate, and the risk to banks could arise on account of inadequacy\nof margins or the inability of borrowers to meet their repayment / interest obligations to banks\nbecause of volatility in share prices or other related reasons, and\n(c) shares/ debentures may be assigned to banks by individuals and corporates as collateral and\nadditional security for certain approved purposes which do not involve stock broking or\ninvestment in capital market.\nThese guidelines cover investments in shares, convertible bonds and debentures and units of\nequity-oriented mutual funds and advances against equity shares, bonds and debentures, units of\nmutual funds, etc. for purposes (a) and (b) above. In respect of (c) above, banks are free to accept\nadditional shares, debentures, units of mutual funds etc. as collateral for approved purposes as\nper the normal banking practice and appraisal procedures.\nCeiling on  overall  exposure to capital market :\n2.   The ceiling of 5 per cent prescribed for investment in shares will henceforth apply to total\nexposure including both fund based and non-fund based, to capital market by a bank in all forms.\nThe ceiling will illustratively cover :\ni) Direct investment by a bank in equity shares, convertible bonds and debentures\nand units of equity oriented mutual funds;\nii) Advances against shares to individuals for investment in equity shares  (including\nIPOs ), bonds and debentures, units of equity-oriented  mutual funds etc;\niii) Secured and unsecured advances to stockbrokers and guarantees issued on behalf\nof stockbrokers and market makers;\n3. The 5 per cent ceiling will be computed in relation to the bank\u2019s total outstanding advances\n(including Commercial Paper) as on March 31, of the previous year. Non-fund based facilities\nand investment by banks in non-convertible debentures and other similar instruments (excluding\nCommercial Paper) ,  should not be included in computing the total outstanding advances of the3\nbank. Further, for computing the ceiling on exposure to capital market, direct investment in\nshares by banks will be calculated at cost  price of the shares.\n4.   As mentioned in paragraph 1 (c) above, it is clarified that the ceiling of 5 per cent will not\ninclude collateral of equity shares / bonds and debentures offered to the bank by corporares  other\nthan NBFCs, for availing of secured loans for working capital or other productive purposes\nwhich do not involve stock broking  or investment in capital markets. Advances made by banks to\nindividuals for personal purposes like education, housing, consumption etc ., will also be outside\nthe 5 per cent ceiling.\nCeiling on direct investment in shares, etc\n5.   Within the above overall ceiling of 5 per cent for total exposure to capital market, the total\ninvestment in shares, convertible bonds and debentures and units of equity-oriented mutual funds\nby a bank should not exceed 20 per cent of its net worth, as hitherto. While making investment in\nequity shares etc., whose prices are subject to volatility, the banks should keep in view the\nfollowing guidelines :\n(i) The ceiling for investment in shares, etc., as stated in the above paragraph (i.e., 20 per\ncent of net worth), is the maximum permissible ceiling and a bank\u2019s Board of Directors\nis free to adopt a lower ceiling for the bank, keeping in view its overall risk profile and\ncorporate strategy.\n(ii) Banks may make investment in shares directly taking into account the in-house\nexpertise available within the bank as per the investment policy approved by the Board\nof Directors subject to compliance with the risk management and internal control\nsystems indicated below.\n(iii) Banks may also make investment in units of UTI and SEBI - approved other diversified\nmutual funds with good track records as per the investment policy approved by the\nBoard of Directors.  Such investments should be in specific schemes of  UTI / Mutual\nFunds  and not by way of placement of funds with UTI / Mutual Funds for investment\nin the capital market on their behalf.\n(iv) Underwriting commitments taken up by the banks in respect of primary issues through\nbook building route would also be within the above overall ceiling.\n(v) Investment in equity shares and convertible bonds and debentures of corporate entities\nshould as hitherto, be reckoned for the purpose of arriving at the prudential norm of\nsingle-borrower and borrower-group exposure ceilings.\nAdvances  against  shares  and debentures\n(a) Advances to individuals :\n6. The present maximum ceilings of advances to individuals against security of shares and\ndebentures (i.e. Rs.10 lakhs against physical shares and Rs.20 lakh against dematerialized shares)\nwill continue. Such loans are meant for genuine individual investors, and banks should not\nsupport collusive action by a large group of individuals, belonging to the same corporate or their\ninter-connected entities to take multiple loans in order to support particular scrips or stock-\nbroking activities of the concerned firms.4\n(b)  Financing of Initial Public Offerings( IPOs):\n7.  The maximum amount of finance that can be granted to an individual for IPOs  (i.e., Rs.10\nlakh) as at present, remains unchanged.  The corporates should not be extended finance for\ninvestment in other companies\u2019 IPOs and NBFCs should not be provided finance for further\nlending to individuals for IPOs. Finance extended by a bank for IPOs should be reckoned as  an\nexposure to capital market.\n (c)  Avoidance of concentration to a few stock broking entities :\n8.   The banks are free to provide credit facilities to stock brokers and market makers on the basis\nof their commercial judgment, within the policy framework approved by their Boards.  However,\nin order to avoid any nexus emerging between inter-connected stock broking entities and banks,\nthe Board of each bank should fix, within the overall ceiling of 5 per cent prescribed in\nparagraph 2 above, a sub-ceiling for total advances to \u2013\n(i) all the stock brokers and market makers (both fund based and non-fund based, i.e.\nguarantees) and\n(ii) to any single stock broking entity, including its associates / inter-connected companies.\n(d)   Margins on advances against shares / issue of guarantees.\n9.   A uniform margin of 40 per cent shall be applied on all advances / financing of IPOs / issue\nof guarantees. A minimum cash margin of 20 per cent ( within the margin of 40%)  shall be\nmaintained in respect of guarantees issued by banks.  The above margin of 40 per cent will apply\nto all fresh advances / guarantees issued.  The existing advances / guarantees issued may\ncontinue at the earlier margins until they come up for renewal.\n(e)  Financing of arbitrage operations\n10.  Banks should not undertake arbitrage operations themselves or extend credit facilities\ndirectly or indirectly to stockbrokers for arbitrage operations in Stock Exchanges.\n11. While banks are permitted to acquire shares from the secondary market, they should ensure\nthat no sale transaction is undertaken without actually holding the shares in its investment\naccount.\nRisk Management and internal control systems:\n12.  Banks desirous of making investment in equity shares / debentures, financing of equities and\nissue of guarantees within the above ceiling, should observe the following guidelines:\na) Investment policy\n(i) Build up adequate expertise in equity research by establishing a dedicated equity\nresearch department, as warranted by their scale of operations ;5\n(ii) Formulate a transparent policy and procedure for investment in shares, etc., with the\napproval of the Board ;\nb) Investment Committee\nThe decision in regard to direct investment in shares, convertible bonds and debentures  should\nbe taken by the Investment Committee set up by the bank\u2019s Board. The Investment Committee\nshould be held accountable for the investments made by the bank.\nc) Risk Management\n(i) Banks should ensure that their exposure to stockbrokers is well diversified  in terms\nof number of broker clients, individual inter-connected broking entities.\n(ii)  While sanctioning advances to stockbrokers, the banks should take into account the\ntrack record and credit worthiness of the broker, financial position of the broker,\noperations on his own account and on behalf of clients, average turn over period of\nstocks and shares, the extent to which broker\u2019s funds are required to be involved in\nhis business operations, etc.\n(iii) While processing proposals for loans to stockbrokers, banks are also advised to\nobtain details of facilities enjoyed by the broker and all his connected companies\nfrom other banks.\n(iv) While granting advances against shares and debentures to other borrowers also,\nbanks should obtain the details of credit facilities availed by them or their\nassociates/inter-connected companies from other banks for the same purpose (i.e.\ninvestment in shares etc.). This is necessary in order to  ensure that high leverage is\nnot built up by the borrower or his associate or inter-connected companies with\nbank finance ;\nd)  Separation of functional responsibilities\n(i) There should be clear separation of decision making in regard to investment in\nshares / advances against shares which will be done by the Investment Committee,\n(ii) The surveillance and monitoring of investment in shares / advances against shares\nshall be done by the Audit Committee of the Board, which shall review in each of\nits meetings, the total exposure of the bank to capital market both fund based and\nnon-fund based, in different forms as stated in paragraph 1 above and ensure that the\nguidelines issued by RBI are complied with and adequate risk management and\ninternal control systems are in place.\n(iii) The Audit Committee shall keep the Board informed about the overall exposure to\ncapital market, the compliance with the RBI and Board guidelines, adequacy of risk\nmanagement and internal control systems etc.\n(v) In order to avoid any possible conflict of interest, it should be ensured that the\nstockbrokers as directors on the Boards of banks or in any other capacity, do not\ninvolve themselves in any manner with the Investment Committee or in the\ndecisions in regard to making investments in shares, etc., or advances against shares.\nValuation and Disclosure6\n13.  Equity shares in a bank\u2019s portfolio - as primary security or as collateral for advances or for\nissue of guarantees and as an investment- should be marked to market preferably on a daily\nbasis, but at least on weekly basis. Banks should disclose the total investments made in equity\nshares, convertible bonds and debentures and units of equity oriented mutual funds as also\naggregate advances against shares in the \u2018Notes on Account\u2019 to their balance sheets.\nTransitional provisions:\n14.  In respect of banks whose exposure to capital market by way of investment in shares and\nadvances against shares is in excess of the ceiling as prescribed in paragraph 2 above, the\nfollowing transitional provisions are provided in order to ensure smooth transition to the revised\nguidelines:\na. Such banks whose exposure to capital market is in excess of the ceiling prescribed in\nparagraph 2 above, should formulate a time-bound plan for gradually reducing their\nexposure to stock market in line with the prudential ceiling now prescribed. In working\nout the time bound plan, the advances granted to individuals against shares for investment\npurposes, may not be recalled and in case of any difficulties arising on this account, the\nbanks may approach RBI for suitable relaxation.  This time-bound plan, along with data\non exposures under investment and various categories of advances / guarantees, should\nbe submitted to the RBI by June 15, 2001.  Meanwhile, these banks should not make any\nfresh investment in equity shares / advances against shares and issue guarantees.\nb. The margin of 40% indicated in paragraph 9 above will apply to all fresh advances /\nfinancing of IPOs / issue of guarantees. Earlier advances /  guarantees may continue at\nthe existing margins until they come up for renewal.\nc. CMDs / CEOs of all banks should review their present portfolio of investment in shares /\nadvances against shares / guarantees and in case investment / advances / guarantees are\nbeyond the limits prescribed by its Board or are in violation of the guidelines of\nNovember 10, 2000, such investment / advances / guarantees should be reduced at the\nearliest. This review should also cover cases of excessive advances / guarantees in favour\nof any particular  entities and their inter-connected companies.         \nReview of the Guidelines\n15   A  review of  the amended Guidelines will again be undertaken by the RBI-SEBI Technical\nCommittee after six months.  For this purpose, banks may submit data  relating to the actual\ninvestment in equity shares, convertible bonds and debentures and equity-oriented mutual funds\nas also advances against shares to individuals, stock brokers and their associates / inter-\nconnected companies, guarantees issued on behalf of brokers, financing of IPOs, the operational\nproblems if any, faced by banks, etc. to RBI by the end of September, 2001.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/20665.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 08, 2001", "info": "Guidelines for Issue of Commercial Paper\nRef.No.IECD. 15 /08.15.01/2000-01\nApril 30, 2001\nThe Chairmen/Chief Executives of\nAll Scheduled Banks, Primary Dealers,\nSatellite Dealers and All-India Financial Institutions\nDear Sirs,\nGuidelines for Issue of Commercial Paper\nAs announced in the Statement on Monetary and Credit Policy for the year\n2001-2002, certain changes have been effected in the guidelines for issue of\ncommercial paper (CP).

As a step towards progressive deregulation of interest rates on\ndeposits and advances and providing more operational flexibility to banks and\neliminating rigidities, the following measures have been introduced with immediate\neffect.\n(i) Shortening of Minimum Maturity Period of Term Deposits\nInterest rates on all term deposits are currently free and banks now offer an array of\nrates across maturities of 15 days (and above) which is the minimum maturity for\ndomestic term deposits. With a view to moving further towards deregulation,\nproviding opportunities for non-banks to invest short-term surplus funds in a more\nflexible manner when they are phased out from call money market and to enable\nbanks to have more flexibility in their Asset Liability Management (ALM), it has\nbeen decided to reduce the minimum maturity period for domestic/Ordinary Non-\nResident/Non-Resident Special Rupee (NRSR) term deposits to 7 days from the\npresent 15 days, at the discretion of individual banks. But, this facility will be\navailable only in respect of single term deposits of Rs. 15 lakh and above where banks\nhave the freedom to offer differential rates of interest according to size of deposits.\nHowever, the stipulation of minimum maturity of 15 days for Certificates of Deposit\n(CDs) and Commercial Paper (CP) will continue.\n(ii) Deposit Scheme for Senior Citizens2\nAs per the present regulations ( cf: paragraphs 22(c) of Master Directive DBOD No.\nDir. BC. 46/13.03.00/2000-2001 dated November 4, 2000), banks are prohibited to\ndiscriminate in the matter of rates of interest paid on deposits, except in respect of\nsingle term deposits exceeding Rs. 15 lakh. Based on the requests from several senior\ncitizens and their organizations, it has been decided to permit banks to formulate, with\nthe approval of their Boards of Directors, fixed deposit schemes specifically for senior\ncitizens offering higher and fixed rates of interest as compared to normal deposits of\nany size. These schemes should also incorporate simplified procedures for automatic\ntransfer of deposits to nominees of such depositors in the event of death. For the sake\nof uniformity, IBA will be advising the banks about the eligibility criteria for Senior\nCitizens.\n(iii) Term Deposits \u2013 Flexibility\na) As per the extant guidelines on domestic/NRE term deposits ( cf: paragraph 9\nof Master Directive DBOD No. Dir BC 46/13.03.00/2000- 2001, dated\nNovember 4, 2000), it is mandatory for banks to allow premature withdrawals,\nif requested by the depositors. However, banks are free to prescribe penal rates\nof interest for allowing premature withdrawal except in the case of\nreinvestment in term deposits with the same bank. Premature withdrawal of\nlarge sums may impact the ALM function of the banks. It has, therefore, been\ndecided to give freedom to banks to exercise their discretion to disallow\npremature withdrawal of large deposits held by entities other than individuals\nand Hindu Undivided Families. Banks would, however, have to notify such\ndepositors of their policy of disallowing premature withdrawals in advance,\ni.e. at the time of accepting such deposits. In regard to existing deposits,\npresent provision will continue until the time of renewal of individual\ndeposits.\nb) At present, in terms of paragraph 1( i) of Master Directive DBOD No. Dir.BC\n46/13.03.00/2000-2001, dated November 4, 2000, banks are free to renew\noverdue domestic term deposits at an interest rate applicable on the date of\nmaturity. In order to facilitate better ALM, it has been decided that renewal of\noverdue term deposits at the rate of interest prevailing on the date of maturity\nbe allowed only for an overdue period of 14 days. In case, the overdue period\nexceeds 14 days and if the depositor places entire amount of overdue deposit3\nor a portion thereof as a fresh term deposit, banks may prescribe their own\ninterest rate for the overdue period on the amount so placed as a fresh deposit.\nBanks, however, have to inform the depositors in advance of their policy for\nrenewal of overdue deposits.\n(iv) Interest rates on FCNR(B) Deposits\nAt present, banks are free to accept FCNR (B) deposits for a maturity period of 1-3\nyears and to offer fixed or floating rates, the latter with an interest reset period of six\nmonths, subject to the ceiling of LIBOR/SWAP rates plus 50 basis points for the\ncorresponding maturity. It has now been decided to revise the above ceiling\ndownward to LIBOR/SWAP rates for the corresponding maturity.\n(The above guidelines will not be applicable to RRBs/LABs).\n(v) Review of Norms Relating to Prime Lending Rate\nAt present, loans upto Rs. 2 lakh carry the prescription of not exceeding the Prime\nLending Rate (PLR) and on the loans above Rs. 2 lakh, banks are free to determine\nrate of interest subject to PLR and spread guidelines. Keeping in view the\ninternational practice and to provide further operational flexibility to commercial\nbanks in deciding their lending rates, it has been decided to relax the requirement of\nPLR being the floor rate for loans above Rs. 2 lakh. Banks may now offer loans at\nbelow PLR rates to exporters or other creditworthy borrowers including public\nenterprises on the lines of a transparent and objective policy approved by the\nrespective Boards.\nBanks will continue to declare the maximum spread of interest rates over PLR.\nHowever, given the prevailing credit market in India and the need to continue with\nconcessionality for small borrowers, the practice of treating PLR as the ceiling for\nloans upto Rs. 2 lakh will continue.\n(The above guidelines will not be applicable to RRBs/LABs).\n(Amending Directives DBOD No. Dir BC 104,105,106/13.03.00/2000-2001 dated\nApril 19, 2001 are enclosed).\n(vi) Preference for Dematerialised Holding\nIn terms of the circular DBOD No. Dir. BC. 115/13.07.05/98-99 dated December 9,\n1998, banks were advised to settle the transactions in securities as notified by\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) only through depositories. Banks4\nwere also advised that after the commencement of mandatory trading in demat form,\nthey would not be able to sell the shares of listed companies if they were held in\nphysical form.\nIn order to extend the demat form of holding to other instruments like    bonds,\ndebentures and equities, it has now been decided that with effect from October 31,\n2001, banks, FIs, PDs and SDs will be permitted to make fresh investments and hold\nbonds and debentures, privately placed or otherwise, only in dematerialized form.\nOutstanding investments in scrip forms should also be converted into dematerialized\nform by June 30, 2002. As regards equity instruments, they will be permitted to be\nheld by the above mentioned institutions only in dematerialized form, from a date to\nbe notified in consultation with SEBI.\nYours faithfully,\n(M.

Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning\nA. Asset Classification \u2013 Adoption of 90 days norm\na) At present, a loan is classified as non-performing when the interest and/or instalment of\nprincipal remain overdue for a period of more than 180 days as against the international best\npractice of 90 days payment delinquency. With a view to moving towards international best\npractices and to ensure greater transparency, it has been decided to adopt the 90 days norm\nfrom the year ending March 31, 2004.  Accordingly, with effect from March 31, 2004, a non-\nperforming asset (NPA) shall be  a loan or an  advance where;\ni) interest and/or instalment of principal remain overdue for a period of more than 90 days\nin respect of a term loan,\nii) the account remains \u2018out of order\u2019 for a period of more than 90 days, in respect of an\nOverdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC),\niii) the bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bills purchased\nand discounted,\niv) interest and/or instalment of principal remains overdue for two harvest seasons but for a\nperiod not exceeding two half years in the case of an advance granted for agricultural\npurposes, and\nv) any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect\nof other accounts.\nb) The banks are, therefore, required to chalk out an appropriate transition path for smoothly\nmoving over to the 90 days norm.  As a facilitating measure, banks should move over to\ncharging of interest at monthly rests, by April 1, 2002.  However, the date of classification of\nan advance as NPA should not be changed on account of charging of interest at monthly\nrests.   Banks should, therefore, continue to classify an account as NPA only  if the interest\ncharged during any quarter  is not serviced fully within 180 days from the end of the quarter\nwith effect from April 1,  2002  and 90 days from the end of the quarter with effect from\nMarch 31, 2004. Banks would have to substantially upgrade their existing Management\nInformation System (MIS) for collecting data on loans, where the interest and/or instalment\nof principal remain overdue for a period of more than 90 days in order to crystallise NPAs on\na 90 days norm.  Banks should commence making additional provisions for such loans,2\nstarting from the year ending March 31, 2002, which would strengthen their balance sheets\nand ensure smooth transition to the 90 days norm by March 31, 2004. Banks are, therefore,\nadvised to work out necessary modalities and submit their action plans early and in any case\nby December 31, 2001 after approval by their Boards to RBI. The implementation of the\nplans will be monitored by RBI on a half-yearly basis.\nB. Provisioning Requirements:\nIn terms of extant prudential regulations, banks are required to make provisions as under in\nrespect of various categories of assets.\nWe have been  constantly reviewing the regulatory requirements in respect of prudential\nprovisions and it is proposed to gradually enhance provisioning requirements in future.\nConsidering that higher loan loss provisioning adds to the overall financial strength of the\nbanks and the stability of the financial sector, banks are urged to voluntarily set apart\nprovisions much above the minimum prudential levels  as a desirable practice.\n2. Credit Exposure to Individual / Group Borrowers\n It was announced in the Mid-term Review of October 2000 that a review of current practices\nregarding credit exposure limits vis-\u00e0-vis international practices shows that there are certain\nissues which require further consideration. The first relates to the concept of `capital funds\u2019;\nsecond relates to the scope of the measurement of credit exposure , in particular, the coverage\nof non-fund and other off-balance sheet exposures; and the third relates to the level of\nexposure limit itself.  Taking into account the complexities involved, and based on the\ncomments and suggestions received from the banks on the issues, it has been decided to\neffect the following changes.\n a)  Concept of Capital Funds\nInternationally, exposure ceilings are computed in relation to total capital as defined under\ncapital adequacy standards (Tier I and Tier II Capital).  Taking into account the best\ninternational practices, it has been decided to adopt the concept of capital funds as defined\nunder capital adequacy standards for determining exposure ceiling uniformly both by\ndomestic and foreign banks, effective from March 31, 2002.  The  exposure ceiling limits\napplicable from  April 1, 2002 would be based on the capital funds in India as  computed\nabove.\n \nb) Measurement of Credit Exposure\ni) At present ,  in respect of non fund based credit limits, only 50% of such limits or\noutstandings, whichever is higher,  is needed to be taken into account for computing the\nextent of exposure.  In line with international best practices, it has been decided that non-\nfund based exposures should also be reckoned at 100 per cent with effect from April 1,\n2003.Asset Classification Provision requirements\nStandard assets 0.25%,\nSubstandard assets 10%\nDoubtful assets between 20 per cent to 50 per cent of the secured\nportion depending on the age of NPA, and 100% of\nthe unsecured portion.3\nii) At present ,  derivative products such as Forward Rate Agreements ( FRAs) and Interest\nRate Swaps ( IRSs) are also captured for computing exposure by applying the conversion\nfactors to notional principal amounts as per the original exposure method prescribed in\nAnnexure 1 and 2 of our circular MPD. BC. 187/07.01.279/1999-2000 dated  July 7, 1999.\nIt has been decided that, effective from April 1, 2003, banks should also include forward\ncontracts in foreign exchange and other derivative products like currency swaps, options,\netc.  at their replacement cost value in determining individual/ group borrower exposure.\nThe methodology to be adopted by banks for arriving at the replacement cost value is  being\nadvised separately.\n \n c) Level of Exposure Limit\nAs the concept of capital funds has been broadened to represent total capital (Tier I and Tier\nII), it has been decided to adjust the exposure ceiling for single borrower from the existing 20\nper cent to 15 per cent of capital funds effective from March 31, 2002. Similarly, the  group\nexposure limits will be adjusted effective from March 31, 2002, to 40 per cent of capital\nfunds.  In case of financing for infrastructure projects, the limit is extendable by another 10\nper cent, i.e., up to 50 per cent.\nPlease acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\nsd/\n(M.R.Srinivasan )\nChief General Manager-in-charge.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/20563.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 04, 2001", "info": "Filing of suits to recover dues from Wilful Defaulters\nMay 2, 2001\nDBOD No. BP.BC.115  /21.03.038/2000-01\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) and\nNotified All India Financial Institutions\nDear Sir,\nFiling of suits to recover dues from Wilful Defaulters\nPlease refer to our Circular DBOD.

A review of the information on wilful defaults submitted to us revealed that there are quite\na few cases where the amount outstanding is substantial but the banks and FIs have not\ninitiated any legal action.

It has, therefore, been decided that\nbanks and FIs should examine all cases of wilful defaults of Rs.1.00 crore and above and file\nsuits in such cases, if not already done.  Banks and FIs should also examine whether in such\ncases of wilful defaults, there are instances of cheating / fraud by the defaulting borrowers\nand if so, they should also file criminal cases against those borrowers.  In other cases\ninvolving amounts below Rs.1.00 crore, banks and FIs should take appropriate action,\nincluding legal action, against the defaulting borrowers.\n4.

The position\nwas reviewed and it was observed that banks have not taken adequate advantage of the Lok\nAdalats for compromise settlement of their NPAs.  There are certain advantages in using the\nforum of Lok Adalats by banks and financial institutions in compromise settlement of their\nNPAs.  There are no court fees involved when fresh disputes are referred to it.  It can take\ncognizance of any existing suit in the court as well as look into and adjudicate upon fresh\ndisputes.  If no settlement is arrived at, the parties can continue with court proceedings.  Its\ndecrees have legal status and are binding.  It has, therefore, been decided that with a view to\nmaking increasing use of the forum of Lok Adalats to settle banking disputes involving\nsmaller amounts, banks and financial institutions should follow the following guidelines for\nimplementation.\n1.    Ceiling of amount for coverage under Lok Adalats\nAs hitherto, cases involving an amount upto Rs.5 lakh may be referred to Lok Adalats. The\nmatter of raising the amount upto Rs.10 lakh has been taken up with the appropriate\nauthority.\n2.   Coverage of Borrowers\nIn order to make a definite impact on reduction of NPAs, the scheme may include all NPA\naccounts, both suit filed and non-suit filed accounts, which are in \u201cdoubtful\u201d and \u201closs\u201d\ncategory, with outstanding balance of Rs.5 lakh (Rs. 10 lakh when the limit is enhanced).\nNo cut off date is suggested since Lok Adalat is an on-going process.\n3.   Settlement Formula\nThe settlement formula would be flexible and left to the Board of Directors of each\ninstitution.  However, certain essential parameters, as under, should be kept in view:\n i. A decree should be sought from the Lok Adalat for the principal amount and interest\nclaimed in the suit, and after full payment of decree amount, a discharge certificate\nshould be issued by the bank / financial institution.\n ii. As regards recovery of the book dues as on the date the account became NPA or\ntransferred to protested bills account, and interest and other costs charged to the\nborrower\u2019s account thereafter, the Board of Directors of the bank/institution should\nframe flexible policies in this regard, taking into account the value of security, the\nrepaying capacity of the borrower, and cost of recovery, etc.\n iii. As regards repayment period, it is suggested that in order to make any immediate impact\non reduction of NPAs, the repayment period should be within one to three years.2\n iv. The negotiated agreement with the borrower should contain a default clause in terms of\nwhich if the borrower does not pay the installments due regularly, within the repayment\nperiod, the entire debt will fall due for payment and bank may initiate legal proceedings.\n v. The Lok Adalats settle cases on the spot.  The Officers representing the institutions\nshould have sufficient powers to accept the compromises worked out within the policy\nframework laid down by the Board of Directors of each institution. As the objective of\nthe whole exercise is to settle arrear cases expeditiously the banker should respond pro-\nactively to the suggestion of the Presiding Officer of the Lok Adalat.\n4.   Organisational Arrangements\nThe individual banks and financial institutions should be more pro-active and should take\nthe responsibility of organising Lok Adalats.  The experience of implementation of RBI\nguidelines issued to public sector banks vide our circular DBOD.No.\nBP.BC.11/21.01.040/99-00 dated   July 27, 2000 on one-time settlement may be kept in\nview.  In this regard, the institutions should get in touch with State / District / Taluk level\nLegal Services Authorities for organising Lok Adalats.  The banks / financial institutions\nshould prescribe clear guidelines to their operating staff and monitor the progress regularly.\nThe banks should report the progress to the Central Office of the Department of Banking\nOperations and Development, and the financial institutions should report to the Central\nOffice of the Department of Banking Supervision (Financial Institutions Division), Reserve\nBank of India at quarterly intervals within one month from the quarters ending March, June,\nSeptember and December, as per format enclosed.  Reserve Bank of India would monitor\nthe progress made by the institutions in effecting recovery under the scheme.  The convener\nbanks of State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) and lead banks of districts should give\nnecessary publicity to the Scheme through various modes, under their areas of operations.\n5.   These guidelines become effective immediately.   A copy of instructions / circular issued\nby the banks / Financial Institutions to the operating units may be sent to RBI and the\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs (Banking\nDivision), New Delhi.\n6.

Securities held by Reserve Bank of India on behalf of banks in the Repo\nConstituents\u2019 SGL Account will be counted for SLR purpose. However, securities\ntransferred to RBI under Reverse Repos will not be counted for SLR purposes. As a\ncustodian of securities, the Securities Department of the Reserve Bank of India will\nissue Constituents\u2019 SGL balance certificates, which would give details on total loan-\nwise securities held in the Repo Constituents\u2019 SGL Account as on any date.\n15.

IDMC.No.4376 /03.75.00/2000-01\nMay 3, 2001\nTo,\nAll Primary Dealers and Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs)\nDear Sirs,\nSub: Scheme of Liquidity Adjustment Facility: 2001-2002\nAs announced in the Statement on Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2001-02, the\nexisting Liquidity Adjustment Facility has been reviewed and certain amendments have\nbeen made. The revised Scheme will be made effective from May 8, 2001. Please find\nenclosed a copy of the revised Scheme.\nYours faithfully,\n(T. C. Nair)\nChief General Manager\nEncl: As aboveScheme of Liquidity Adjustment Facility: 2001-2002\nAs indicated in April 2000 Policy Statement, the scheme of Liquidity Adjustment Facility\n(LAF) is being introduced progressively in three convenient stages in order to ensure\nsmooth transition. In the first stage, with effect from June 5, 2000, variable rate Repo\nauctions with the same day settlement were introduced replacing the Additional\nCollateralised Lending Facility (ACLF) to banks and Level II support to Primary Dealers\n(PDs). The second stage of LAF envisages replacement of Collateralised Lending Facility\n(CLF) to banks and Level I support to PDs by variable rate Repo auctions. It was\nindicated that the effective date for the second stage would be decided in consultation\nwith banks and PDs. Taking the above factors into consideration and on the basis of\nexperience gained in operating LAF coupled with wide ranging consultations with the\nmarket participants, it has been decided to revise the earlier LAF Scheme, circulated vide\nour letter No. 3968/03.75.00/99-2000 dated May 29, 2000. The main features of the\nrevised Scheme, known as LAF Scheme 2001-2002, are as under:\n1. The Scheme\nUnder the scheme, ( i) Repo auctions (for absorption of liquidity) and (ii) Reverse Repo\nauctions (for injection of liquidity) will be conducted on a daily basis (except Saturdays).\nBut for the intervening holidays and Fridays, the Repo tenor will be one day. On Fridays,\nthe auctions will be held for three days maturity to cover the following Saturday and\nSunday. The funds under LAF are expected to be used by the banks for their day-to-day\nmismatches in liquidity.\n2.  Fixed rate Repo auction\nRBI will henceforth have an additional option to switchover to fixed rate Repos on\novernight basis; but this option is expected to be sparingly used. For the purpose of such\nRepos, the rates of interest intended to be offered would be announced as part of auction\nannouncement on the previous evening or before 10.00 a.m. on the day of auction, if\nnecessary.\n3.  Long term Repo\nIn addition to overnight Repos, RBI will also have the discretion to introduce longer-term\nRepos up to 14 day period as and when required.\n4.   Rate of Interest\nAt present, auctions under LAF are conducted on ''uniform price'' basis. It has been\ndecided to introduce '' multiple price '' auction, in place of existing uniform price auction\non an experimental basis for one month period during May 2001. Interest rates in respect\nof both Repos and Reverse Repos will be, accordingly, based on the bids quoted by\nparticipants and subject to the cut-off rates as decided by the Reserve Bank of India, at\nMumbai. The Repo/Reverse Repo rate in per cent per annum expected by the tendererwill be expressed up to two decimal points rounded off to the nearest 5 basis points. As\nthere will be no adjustment for accrued coupon, the cash flow will depend upon the Repo\nrate emerging on day-to-day basis.\n5. Mechanics of operations:\ni) The LAF auction timing is being advanced by 30 minutes. Bids will be\nreceived in tender forms ( Annexures I and II) at IDM Cell before 10.30 a.m ., as\nagainst 11.00 a.m. at present.  A separate box for the purpose will be kept at the\nreception on the Ground floor of the Central Office Building, RBI, Mumbai .\nProcessing of the bids will be done at IDMC. The auction results will be\ndisplayed by Mumbai Office by 12.00 noon  as against 12.30 p.m. at present.\nii) The Repo will be conducted as \u201cHold in Custody\u201d type, wherein the Reserve\nBank of India will act as a custodian for the participants and hold the securities\non their behalf in the Repo/Reverse Repo Constituents\u2019 Accounts. In pursuant to\nthis, the participants will have to give an undertaking as given in the respective\ntender forms authorizing RBI to act on behalf of them.  Reserve Bank of India\nshall not, however be responsible for any loss, damage or liability on account of\nacting as the Custodian on behalf of the participants. A Repo Constituents\u2019 SGL\nAccount (RC SGL Account) and Reverse Repo Constituents\u2019 SGL Account\n(RRC SGL Account) will be opened and held in the Securities Department in\nMumbai Office for this purpose which will have institution-wise subsidiary\nrecords of the securities sold under Repo and securities bought under Reverse\nRepo. RBI will have Subsidiary Accounts in the case of both of these Accounts.\niii) On success in auction in respect of Repos, the tenderer\u2019s RC SGL Account\nwill be credited with the required quantum of securities debiting Bank\u2019s\nsubsidiary account/Investment Account.  Likewise, the tenderer\u2019s Current\nAccount will be debited for the resultant cash flows and credited to the Bank\u2019s\nAccount. The transaction will be reversed in the second leg.\niv) In the case of Reverse Repos, on acceptance of bid, the tenderer's SGL\naccount/ RRC SGL Account will be debited with the required quantum of\nsecurities and credited to Bank\u2019s Investment Account/Subsidiary RRC SGL\nAccount. Accordingly, the tenderer\u2019s Current Account will be credited with the\nReverse Repo amount, debiting the Bank's account. The transactions will be\nreversed in the second leg.\nv) Transactions between RBI and counter parties including operation of the RC\nSGL Account and RRC SGL Account would not require separate SGL forms as\nprovision will be made in the application form for the purpose. Likewise, transfer\nof securities from/to RBI\u2019s Investment Account and Subsidiary Accounts in the\nRepo and Reverse Repo SGL account will not require signing of SGL transfer\nforms. However, transfer from tenderer\u2019s SGL Account to the RRC SGL Account\nwill require completion of SGL form. In the case of Reverse Repos, tenderers willhave the option to either use the RRC SGL Account route or getting their SGL\nAccounts debited for the purpose of transferring securities to RBI.\nvi) Pricing of all securities including Treasury Bills will be at face value for\nRepo/Reverse Repo operations by RBI. Accrued interest as on the date of\ntransaction will be ignored for the purpose of pricing of securities. Coupon, if any,\nwill be transferred to RBI in the case of Repos, and RBI will collect the coupon, if\nany, on the due date and credit the same to the party\u2019s Current Account in the case\nof Reverse Repos.\n6.  Eligibility\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) and Primary\nDealers ( PDs) having Current Account and SGL Account with RBI, Mumbai will be\neligible to participate in the Repo and Reverse Repo auctions.\n7. Minimum bid size\nTo enable participation of small level operators in LAF and also to add further\noperational flexibility to the scheme, the minimum bid size for LAF is being reduced\nfrom the existing Rs.10 crore to Rs.5 crore and in multiples of Rs.5 crore thereafter.\n8.  Eligible Securities\nRepos and Reverse Repos will be undertaken in all transferable Government of India\ndated Securities/Treasury Bills (except 14 days Treasury Bills).\n9.  Margin Requirement\nA margin will be uniformly applied in respect of the above collateral securities\ncomprising the Government of India dated securities/ Treasury bills. The amount of\nsecurities offered or tendered on acceptance of a bid for Rs.100 will be Rs.105 in terms of\nface value.\n10. Settlement of Transactions\nThe settlement of transactions in the auction will take place on the same day.\n11. SLR and Securities held in Repo SGL Account\nSecurities held by RBI on behalf of banks' Repo Constituents\u2019 SGL account and credit\nbalance in the RRC SGL Account will be counted for SLR purpose and a certificate will\nbe issued to banks by RBI on a fortnightly basis. As far as valuation etc. for SLR purpose\nis concerned, extant DBOD instructions will apply.\n12. Terms and ConditionsTender Forms for \u201c Repo Auction\u201d and \u201cReverse Repo Auction\u201d along with terms and\nconditions are enclosed at Annexures I and II.\n13. Information Dissemination\nFor a smooth transition to full-fledged operation of LAF, banks and PDs are being\nprovided a back-stop facility at variable rate of interest, as a cushion over the normal\nliquidity facility at Bank Rate. Along with the auction results, the rate of interest\napplicable for the back-stop facility for the concerned day will also be announced for the\nbenefit of the participants who wish to avail of such facility. Further, to facilitate better\nbidding by the participants, additional information on the aggregate cash balances of\nscheduled commercial banks maintained with RBI, during the fortnight, on a cumulative\nbasis with a lag of two days as also weighted average cut-off yield will also be released\nas a part of the Press Release on money market operations.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/20545.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 02, 2001", "info": "1Educational Loan Scheme\nApril 28, 2001\nRPCD.PLNFS.BC.NO.83/06.12.05/2000-01\nThe Chairman/Managing Director\nAll scheduled commercial banks\nDear Sir\nEducational Loan Scheme\nThe Finance Minister in a meeting with the Chief Executives of the public sector banks on 13 June\n2000 had highlighted the role of commercial banks in facilitating pursuit of higher education by\npoor, but meritorious students.

It would be observed from para 89 (copy enclosed at Annexure  I) of\nthe policy statement that though the DFIs are expected to continue to have a special role in\nthe Indian financial system till the debt market demonstrates substantial improvements in\nterms of liquidity and depth, the FIs have an option to transform into a bank provided the\nprudential norms as applicable to banks are fully satisfied. For achieving full compliance\nwith the regulatory norms as applicable to banks, the approach recognises the need for a\ntransition path  to be worked out by the FIs.\n2. In this context, we advise that in evolving t he path for transition of a FI to a\nuniversal bank, several operational and regulatory issues will need to be addressed. Some\nof the salient issues are briefly enumerated at Annexure II  for information and guidance\nof the financial institutions. In order to avoid any transitional problems, it is also desirable\nto ensure that transition is gradual and sufficient precaution is taken to fully conform to\nrequirements of consolidated supervision. Should an FI choose to exercise the option\navailable to it and formally decide to convert itself into a universal bank, it may formulate\na road map for the transition path and strategy for smooth conversion into an universal\nbank over a specified time frame. The plan should specifically provide for full compliance\nwith prudential norms as applicable to banks over the proposed period.

The Khan Working Group held the view that DFIS should be allowed to\nbecome banks at the earliest. The RBI released a \u2018Discussion Paper\u2019 (DP) in January 1999\nfor wider public debate. The feedback  on the discussion paper indicated that while the\nuniversal banking is desirable from the point of view of efficiency of resource use, there is\nneed for caution in moving towards such a system by banks and DFIs. Major areas\nrequiring attention are the status of financial sector reforms, the state of preparedness of\nthe concerned institutions, the evolution of the regulatory regime and above all a viable\ntransition path for institutions which are desirous of moving in the direction of universal\nbanking. It is proposed to adopt the following broad approach for considering proposals in\nthis area:\n(a) The principle of \u201cUniversal Banking\u201d is a desirable goal and some progress has\nalready been made by permitting banks to diversify into investments and long-term\nfinancing and the DFIs to lend for working capital, etc. However, banks have\ncertain special characteristics and as such any dilution of RBI\u2019s prudential and\nsupervisory norms for conduct of banking business would be inadvisable.  Further,\nany conglomerate, in which a bank is present, should be subject to a consolidated\napproach to supervision and regulation.\n(b) Though the DFIs would continue to have a special role in the Indian financial\nSystem, until the debt market demonstrates substantial improvements in terms of\nliquidity and depth, any DFI, which wishes to do so, should have the option to\ntransform into bank (which it can exercise), provided the prudential norms as\napplicable to banks are fully satisfied. To this end, a DFI would need to prepare a\ntransition path in order to fully comply with the regulatory requirement of a bank.\nThe DFI concerned may consult RBI for such transition arrangements. Reserve\nBank will consider such requests on a case by case  basis.\n(c) the regulatory framework of RBI in respect of DFIs would need to be strengthened\nif they are given greater access to short-term resources for  meeting their financing\nrequirements, which is necessary.\n(d) In due course, and in the light of evolution of the financial system, Narasimham\nCommittee\u2019s recommendation that, ultimately there should be only banks and\nrestructured NBFCs can be operationalised.\n_____________\nANNEXURE II\nSalient operational and regulatory issues to be addressed by\nthe FIs for conversion into a Universal Bank\na)Reserve requirements\nCompliance with the cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio requirements (under\nSection 42 of  RBI Act, 1934, and Section 24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949,\nrespectively ) would be mandatory for an FI after its conversion into a universal bank.3\nb)Permissible activities\nAny activity of an FI currently undertaken but not permissible for a bank under Section\n6(1) of the B. R. Act, 1949, may have to be stopped or divested after its conversion into a\nuniversal bank ..\nc) Disposal of non-banking assets  -\nAny immovable property, howsoever acquired by an FI, would, after its conversion into a\nuniversal bank, be required to be disposed of within the maximum period of 7 years from\nthe date of acquisition, in terms of  Section 9 of the B. R. Act.\nd)        Composition of the Board\nChanging the composition of the Board of Directors might become necessary for some of\nthe FIs after their conversion into a universal bank, to ensure compliance with the\nprovisions of Section 10(A) of the B. R. Act, which requires at least 51% of the total\nnumber of directors to have special knowledge and experience.\ne)        Prohibition on floating charge of assets\nThe floating charge, if created by an FI, over its assets, would require, after its conversion\ninto a universal bank, ratification by the Reserve Bank of India under Section 14(A) of the\nB. R. Act, since a banking company is not allowed to create a floating charge on the\nundertaking or any property of the company unless duly certified by RBI as required under\nthe Section.\nf)Nature of subsidiaries\nIf any of the existing subsidiaries of an FI is engaged in an activity not permitted under\nSection 6(1) of the B R Act , then on conversion of the FI into a universal bank, delinking\nof such subsidiary / activity from the operations of the universal bank would become\nnecessary since Section 19 of the Act permits  a bank to have subsidiaries only for one or\nmore of the activities permitted under Section 6(1) of B. R. Act.\ng)Restriction on investments\nAn FI with equity investment in companies in excess of 30 per cent of the paid up share\ncapital of that company or 30 per cent of its own paid-up share capital and reserves,\nwhichever is less, on its conversion into a universal bank, would need to divest such\nexcess holdings to secure compliance with the provisions of Section 19(2) of the B. R.\nAct, which prohibits a bank from holding shares in a company in excess of these limits.\nh)      Connected lending\nSection 20 of the B. R. Act prohibits grant of loans and advances by a bank on security of\nits own shares or grant of loans or advances on behalf of any of its directors or to any firm\nin which its director/manager or employee or guarantor is interested.  The compliance with\nthese provisions would be mandatory after conversion of an FI to a universal bank.\ni)         Licensing\nAn FI converting into a universal bank would be required to obtain a banking licence from\nRBI under Section 22 of the B. R. Act, for carrying on banking business in India, after\ncomplying with the applicable conditions.4\nj)      Branch network\nAn FI, after its conversion into a bank, would also be required to comply with extant\nbranch licensing policy of RBI  under which the new banks are required to allot at east 25\nper cent of their total number of branches in semi-urban and rural areas.\nk)         Assets in India\nAn FI after its conversion into a universal bank, will be required to ensure that at the close\nof business on the last Friday of every quarter, its total assets held in India are not less than\n75 per cent of its total demand and time liabilities in India, as required of a bank under\nSection 25 of the B R Act.\nl)        Format of annual reports\nAfter converting into a universal bank, an FI will be required to publish its annual balance\nsheet and profit and loss account in the in the forms set out in the Third Schedule to the B\nR Act, as prescribed for a banking company under Section 29 and Section 30 of the B. R.\nAct .\nm)     Managerial remuneration of the Chief Executive Officers\nOn conversion into a universal bank, the appointment and remuneration of the existing\nChief Executive Officers may have to be reviewed with the approval of RBI in terms of\nthe provisions of Section 35 B of the B. R. Act. The Section stipulates fixation of\nremuneration of the Chairman and Managing Director of a bank by Reserve Bank of India\ntaking into account the profitability, net NPAs and other financial parameters. Under the\nSection, prior approval of RBI would also be required for appointment of Chairman and\nManaging Director.\nn)Deposit insurance\nAn FI, on conversion into a universal bank, would also be required to comply with the\nrequirement of compulsory deposit insurance from DICGC up to a maximum of Rs.1 lakh\nper account, as applicable to the banks.\no)Authorised Dealer\u2019s Licence\nSome of the FIs at present hold restricted AD licence from RBI, Exchange Control\nDepartment to enable them to undertake transactions necessary for or incidental to their\nprescribed functions.  On conversion into a universal bank, the new bank would normally\nbe eligible for fulfledged authorised dealer licence and would also attract the full rigour of\nthe Exchange Control Regulations applicable to the banks at present, including prohibition\non raising resources through external commercial borrowings.\np)Priority sector lending\nOn conversion of an FI to a universal bank, the obligation for lending to \u201cpriority sector\u201d\nup to a prescribed percentage of their \u2018net bank credit\u2019 would also become applicable to it .\nq) Prudential norms5\nAfter conversion of an FI in to a bank, the extant prudential norms of RBI for the all-India\nfinancial institutions would no longer be applicable but the norms as applicable to banks\nwould be attracted and will need to be fully complied with.\n(This list of regulatory and operational issues is only illustrative and not exhaustive).", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/20534.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 02, 2001", "info": "Indian Direct Investment outside India\nA.P.

The\nCommittee had submitted its recommendations based on which the revised policy\napproach to area of operation of the urban banks is set out in the following paragraphs:\n2.  Extension of area of operation to the adjoining districts\nLicensed urban co-operative banks, which are not classified as weak/sick, only  are\neligible for extension of area of operation beyond their present limits.\nAt present, banks are required to obtain prior permission of Reserve Bank of India, for\nextending their area of operation beyond the district of their registration. With a view to\ngiving more operational freedom to UCBs in this regard, it has been decided to allow new\nas well as existing urban co-operative banks to extend their area of operation to the whole\nof the district of  registration and to its adjoining districts within their state of registration\nwithout prior permission of Reserve Bank of India . Accordingly, henceforth, banks\nneed not approach Reserve Bank for seeking \"no objection\" in this regard and they may\ndirectly approach Registrar of Co-operative Societies of the concerned State for extension\nof area of operation to the entire district of registration and its adjoining districts within\nthe state of registration.\n3.    Extension of area of operation beyond the adjoining districts\nAn urban co-operative bank desirous of extending its area of operation beyond  adjoining\ndistricts to its district of registration but within the state may do so with  prior\npermission of Reserve Bank  subject to complying with following norms:\n(i) its  owned funds (share capital + free reserves) should not be less than the Entry\nPoint Capital prescribed for the highest category centre in that  district/s fororganising a new multi-branch bank as indicated in our circular\nUBD.No.1/08.00.01/2000-01, dated 30 August 2000. As the existing  banks may\ntake sometime to achieve the revised  Entry Point Norms( EPNs) their requests for\nextension of area of operation  would be considered based on EPNs prescribed\nvide our circular UBD.No.RCS.NBL.4/08.00. 00/97-98 dated 21 March, 1998 till\n31 March 2003. Thereafter, only such banks' requests will be considered which\nhave achieved the EPNs prescribed in our circular dated August 30, 2000.\n(ii) it should have achieved prescribed targets for priority sector lending.\n(iii) its net NPAs should be less than 10% of its net loans and advances and it should\nhave made full provisions as prescribed by RBI.\n(iv) it should have posted net profits during the preceding 2 years.\n(v) it should have complied with the RBI regulatory framework, such as compliance\nwith CRR/SLR requirements, timely submission of prescribed returns/statements\nand satisfactory compliance with RBI inspection findings etc.\n4.     Extension of area of operation beyond the state of registration\nAn urban cooperative bank with the prior approval of Reserve Bank may extend  its\narea of operation beyond its state of registration provided its owned funds are not less\nthan  Rs.50 crore and it complies with norms stipulated at para 3 above,.\n5.  Requests regarding extension of area of operation may be made to the concerned\nRegional Office under whose jurisdiction  the banks are functioning.\nThis circular supersedes all our earlier instructions on the subject.\nYours faithfully,\n(M.M.S.Rekhrao)\nChief General Manager", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/21408.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 26, 2001", "info": "Recommendations of the High Power Committee -\nReview of Branch Licensing Policy\nBL(PCB)No.47/ 07.01.00 / 2000-1\nApril 26, 2001\nVaisakha 6,1923(S)\nChief Executive Officers of\nPrimary ( Urban ) Co-operative Banks\n(except Salary Earners' Banks)\nDear Sir,\nRecommendations of the High Power Committee -\nReview of Branch Licensing Policy\nReserve Bank of India had constituted a High Power Committee on Urban Co-operative Banks\n(UCBs) under the Chairmanship of Shri K. Madhava Rao, to review the performance of UCBs and\nsuggest necessary measures to strengthen them. One of the terms of reference to the Committee\nwas to review the existing policy relating to branch licensing of UCBs. The recommendations\nmade by the Committee in this regard have been examined. Based on these recommendations,\nBranch Licensing Policy has been revised and is given in the following paragraphs:\n2. Licensed urban co-operative banks, which are not classified as weak/sick may apply for\nallotment of centres under the Annual Action Plan (AAP) to Urban Banks Department, Central\nOffice, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. The Annual Action Plan will be for a period of twelve\nmonths beginning 1st April of the year. Before applying for allotment of centres the urban banks\nshould ensure that they satisfy the following criteria.\n i. Capital to Risk Assets Ratio (CRAR) of banks should not be less than that prescribed by\nRBI from time to time. (This condition will come into force only after application of CRAR\nto UCBs);\n ii. Banks should have posted net profits during each of the preceding 2 years;\n iii. their net NPAs should be less than 10% of their net loans and advances as on the last\nbalance sheet date and they should have made requisite provisions as per RBI\nguidelines;\n iv. Banks should have achieved the target prescribed by RBI for priority sector advances;\n v. Banks should have demonstrated track record of compliance with provisions of B.R. Act\n1949 (AACS), R.B.I. Act, 1934 and the instructions/ directions issued by RBI from time to\ntime. They should maintain requisite level of CRR and SLR and also ensure timely\nsubmission of statutory and other returns.\n3. Banks which have been organised as unit banks and have been extended relaxation in the\nentry point capital (Please see RBI circular UBD.No.1/08.00.00/ 2000-01, dated 30 August 2000)\nwould be eligible to open branches only after augmenting their owned funds to the level required\nfor opening a new bank (other than a unit bank) at the place where the bank was organised or\nwhere the branch is desired to be opened, whichever is higher. For instance, if a unit bank was\norganised at category `D' centre and it intends to open a branch at `B' category centre, such a\nbank\u2018s owned funds should necessarily be raised to entry point capital prescribed for `B' category\ncentre.\n4. Similarly if a bank, other than a unit bank, desires to open a branch at a higher category centre\nthan the centre at which it was established within the district of its registration, the owned funds ofthe bank should atleast be equivalent to the entry point capital prescribed for that centre.\nIllustratively, if a bank situated at `C' category centre intends to open a branch at `B' category\ncentre, in the same district, its owned funds should be equivalent to the entry point capital\nprescribed for `B' category centre. Further, an Urban Co-operative Bank which desires to open a\nbranch at a centre other than its district of registration but within the state of registration, must\nhave owned funds not less than the entry point capital applicable for organisation of a new Urban\nCo-operative Bank (other than a unit bank) at the highest category centre in that State.\nIllustratively, if a bank registered in district `X' desires to open a branch in district `Y' within the\nstate of registration then its owned funds should not be less than the entry point capital applicable\nfor highest category centre in the State.\n5. As some of the existing banks may not be in a position to immediately augment their owned\nfunds to the desired level for being eligible for branch expansion such banks will be allotted\ncentres on restricted basis on their complying with entry point norms prescribed vide our circular\nUBD.No.RCS. NBL.4/08.00.00/ 97-98 dated 21 March 1998. However, they will have to raise\ntheir owned funds to the prescribed level (Please see our circular UBD.No.1 /08.00.00/2000-01\ndated 30 August 2000) by 31 March 2003, failing which they will not be eligible for further branch\nexpansion.\n6. Urban co-operative banks which satisfy the norms indicated above, may prepare Annual Action\nPlans for opening new branches / upgradation of extension counters into full fledged branches for\nthe next 12 months , with the approval of their Boards of Directors. Their applications should be\nforwarded along with annexure I, II and III (enclosed to this circular) to the Central Office of the\nUrban Banks Department, Mumbai with a copy to the concerned Regional Office of Urban Banks\nDepartment. Annexure III indicating classification of assets and provisions made against non-\nperforming assets should be duly certified by statutory auditors or Chartered Accountants. On\nscrutiny of Action Plans and other information/ particulars, banks which comply with our\nprescribed norms would be allotted centres for opening of branches.\n7. It has been observed that some banks open extension counters without complying with the\nnorms laid down in this regard and subsequently approach Reserve Bank of India for upgradation\nof the same into full-fledged branches. It has been decided that in future, such banks would not\nbe allotted centres unless they close unauthorised extension counters. Further, a centre where a\nbank has opened an unauthorised extension counter, such a centre would not be considered for\nopening a branch in future.\n8. Scheduled urban co-operative banks which comply with the norms indicated at para 2 above,\nmay open mobile/ satellite offices. Such of the scheduled UCBs, which desire to open\nmobile/satellite offices may indicate the same in annexure II along with other centres where they\nintend to open branches.\n9. Banks have been making frequent requests for change of allotted centres due to various\nreasons. In order to give more flexibility to banks in this regard, it has been decided that\nhenceforth banks need not indicate the exact address of the proposed branch in the Annual\nAction Plan but only indicate the name of the town/city within their area of operation, in the order\nof their preference, where they desire to open branches. Centres would be allotted strictly in the\norder of preference given by banks. However, once a centre is allotted no request for change in\nthe allotted centre would be entertained.  Banks are, therefore, requested to choose the centres at\nwhich they wish to open branches after careful consideration of business potential and availability\nof premises at such centres. After making arrangements for opening of branch/es, banks should\napproach the concerned Regional Offices of Urban Banks Department under whose jurisdiction\nthey operate, in form V, indicating the exact postal address of the place where the branch is to be\nopened, for issuance of licence within a period of 6 months from the date of allotment of the\ncentre. Similarly, banks are required to open branches within the validity period of the licence. No\nrequest for extension of time will be entertained except in the circumstances beyond the control of\nthe banks.\n10. It has also been observed that some of the urban co-operative banks have been submitting\nseparate applications for each centre. It may be carefully noted that all centres where a bank\ndesires to open branches under the AAP should be indicated in Annexure II enclosed to this\ncircular and only one application need be sent. Similarly some of the banks are submittingstatements/ Annexures which are not required/ called for. Banks are, therefore, advised to submit\nonly the requisite information/ data indicated in this circular.\n11. It may be carefully noted that in case the information/particulars furnished by a bank is found\nto be incorrect, Reserve Bank of India would take a serious view in the matter and the bank would\nbe liable for penal action, including debarring it from allotment of centres for the next 3 years.\n12.

Revised policy approach\nLicensed urban co-operative banks which are not classified as weak/sick, are eligible to open\nextension counters. Only scheduled urban co-operative banks, which fulfill the norms laid\ndown in paragraph 3 below can open ECs, without prior permission of RBI . However such\nbanks should approach our concerned Regional Office with an application as per enclosed format\n(Please see Annexure ) for post facto approval, within one month from the date of opening of\nECs. Under the revised policy, non-scheduled urban co-operative banks are not eligible to open\nECs without the prior permission of Reserve Bank. Such of the non-scheduled UCBs which fulfill\nthe norms stipulated at para 3 of the circular may approach the concerned Regional Office of the\nUBD RBI, under whose jurisdiction their Registered Office is located, with an application as per\nformat in Annexure for seeking prior permission  to open ECs. Such of the banks which open\nECs, without seeking prior permission from RBI will have to close down the same and these\nwould not be considered for regularisation/ upgradation into full fledged branch/ es.\n3. Eligibility norms for opening extension counters.\nAn UCB which desires to open ECs should comply with the following norms,\n(i) Extension Counters may be opened by UCBs (non-scheduled UCBs have to obtain prior\napproval) within the premises of educational institutions, big offices, factories and hospitals of\nwhich the concerned urban co-operative bank is the principal banker . Request from other banks\nto the institution may be considered, only if opening of an EC is not considered feasible by the\nprincipal banker and/or its base branch is beyond 10 Kms from the EC. No extension counter\nshould be opened in market place, residential colony, shopping centre etc.\n(ii) The number of direct beneficiaries/ accounts attached to the institution should be at least 500.\n(iii) The base branch of the bank to which the proposed extension counter is linked should be\nwithin a distance of 10 kms. to facilitate incorporation of transactions of EC in the accounts of the\nbase branch on a day-to-day basis.(iv) Before opening an extension counter, the bank should take into account important factors\nsuch as need, viability and overall merits of opening of the EC.\n(v) The level of net NPAs of the bank should be less than 10% of its net loans and advances\noutstanding as on 31 March of the latest financial year and the bank should have made full\nprovisions as per RBI norms.\n(vi) The bank should have achieved the target prescribed by Reserve Bank of India for priority\nsector lending.\n(vii) The bank should have made net profits in each of the two preceding years.\n(viii) The bank should have complied with SLR/CRR requirements on a continuous basis should\nnot have violated RBI guidelines and should also have submitted statutory and other returns to\nRBI in time.\n(ix) ECs should not be opened merely for collection of fees, payment of bills for electricity, water,\ntelephones, etc . as it is primarily the responsibility of the concerned institution.\n(x) The facilities at an extension counter should be restricted to -\n(a) acceptance of deposits;\n(b) issue and encashment of drafts and mail transfers;\n(c) encashment of travellers' cheques and\n(d) collection of bills.\n4.

It is important\nto take necessary remedial measures urgently to remove the weaknesses that have\nbeen noticed so that India\u2019s financial sector  continues to remain strong and safe.\nCertain prudential measures to further strengthen the system are dealt with in Part III.\n3.Like last  year, a technical and analytical review of macroeconomic and\nmonetary developments is being issued as a separate document. This document\nprovides the necessary macroeconomic and other information in somewhat greater\ndetail with the help of simple charts and tables.\nI. Review of Macroeconomic and Monetary\nDevelopments: 2000-01\nDomestic Developments\n4.According to the latest estimates of the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO),\nthe GDP growth in 2000-01 is likely to be about 6.0 per cent as compared with 6.4 per\ncent and 6.6 per cent in the previous two years.   The growth in agricultural sector was\nat 0.9 per cent during 2000-01 as against 0.7 per cent in the previous year.  The\ngrowth in mining and quarrying sector was expected to be significantly higher at 4.5\nper cent as compared with 1.7 per cent a year ago. The overall growth performance of\nthe industrial sector during 2000-01 is estimated to be somewhat lower than that in the\nprevious year. Combined with the continued good performance of the services sector,\nparticularly of information technology related services, the economy is expected to\nshow a growth rate of 6.0 per cent or very close to it, despite low agricultural growth.\n5.The Gujarat earthquake has caused considerable damage.  While the\nimmediate loss of production may not be sizeable, the cost of restoration of\ninfrastructure is expected to cause a fiscal strain on the state reflecting loss of revenue2and financing of relief and rehabilitation.   Production of principal agricultural\ncommodities from the state such as oilseeds, cotton and tobacco may suffer.    While\nthere has not been major damage to large industrial installations, industrial\nenvironment could be affected because of infrastructural constraints.  Despite these\nnegative factors, on an overall reckoning, the impact of the quake on GDP growth is\nestimated to be small.   In order to enable the state government to deal with the\nsituation, the Reserve Bank has taken several initiatives which are reviewed in the\nPart III of this Statement.\n6.The annual rate of inflation on a point-to-point basis  as measured by\nvariations in the wholesale price index (base 1993-94 = 100) worked out to 4.9 per\ncent in 2000-01 as against 6.8 per cent a year ago.  While inflation on account of\nmanufactured products (weight 63.7) at 3.7 per cent was modest,  primary articles\n(weight 22.0) showed a marginal decline of 0.3 per cent. The  rise in WPI was mainly\ndue to increase in prices of \u2018fuel, power, light and lubricants\u2019 sub-group (weight 14.2)\nwhich recorded a substantial increase of 15.3 per cent on top of an increase of 26.9\nper cent a year ago.  Inflation as reflected in consumer price index (CPI) was much\nlower at 3.0 per cent (on a point-to-point basis) and 4.0 per cent (on an average basis)\nup to end-February 2001.\n7.During 2000-01, the annual growth in money supply (M 3) on a point-to-point\nbasis, was higher at 16.2 per cent as against 14.6 per cent a year ago.  This overall\nmonetary expansion captured large inflows amounting to about Rs.26,000 crore of\nIndia Millennium Deposits (IMDs).  Net of IMD inflows, the annual growth in M 3\nwould work out to 13.9 per cent.  Among the components, the growth in aggregate\ndeposits of the scheduled commercial banks at 17.8 per cent was higher than that of\n13.9 per cent in the previous year.  The expansion in currency with the public was\nlower at 10.8 per cent (about Rs.20,400 crore) as against 11.7 per cent (about\nRs.19,800 crore) in the previous year.  This could   partly be attributed to lower\nagricultural activity and partly to the larger base in the previous year on account of\nY2K uncertainties.\n8.The increase in reserve money during 2000-01 at 8.3 per cent (about\nRs.23,200 crore) was comparable to that of 8.1 per cent (about Rs.21,000 crore) in the\nprevious year. While the monetisation of Central Government deficit was about3Rs.9,000 crore, the expansion in reserve money largely emanated from increase in net\nforeign exchange assets (NFEA).  On the other hand, claims on banks and commercial\nsector showed a decline of about Rs.5,800 crore reflecting easy liquidity conditions.\n9. The year-on-year growth of non-food credit in the range of 19 - 22 per cent\nduring the first three quarters of the year (April-December 2000) was significantly\nhigher than that in the previous year.  Expansion in credit during this period partly\nreflected the increase in stocks of fertilizers, sugar, petroleum and automobiles.\nMoreover, credit flow to infrastructure sector and retail segment was relatively high.\nConsumer credit had also expanded in line with accelerated production of consumer\ndurables.  The pace of credit growth has, however,  decelerated since December 2000\nwhich is in line with subdued industrial activity.  For the year as a whole, non-food\ncredit has registered a lower growth of 14.3 per cent (Rs.58,800 crore) as against an\nincrease of 16.5 per cent (Rs.58,200 crore) in the previous year.\n10.The total flow of funds from scheduled commercial banks to the commercial\nsector including banks\u2019 investments in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector\nundertakings and private corporate sector, commercial paper, etc., are estimated at\nabout Rs.71,500 crore (15.1 per cent) as against Rs.71,600 crore (17.9 per cent) in the\ncorresponding period of the previous year.  Total flow of resources to the commercial\nsector, including capital issues, global depository receipts (GDRs) and borrowing\nfrom financial institutions are placed at about Rs.1,49,000 crore as compared with\nRs.1,38,000 crore  in the previous year.\n11.The increase in food credit was much higher at Rs.14,300 crore as compared\nwith Rs.8,900 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year reflecting larger\nscale of procurement operations. The buffer stock of foodgrains peaked to 46.8\nmillion tonnes at end-February 2001.  The opportunity costs arising from fiscal and\nmonetary perspectives of such large buffer stock operations need to be carefully\nconsidered.   As the gap between the procurement and issue prices widen, the large\nbuffer stock tends to result in the food subsidy assuming the nature of producers\u2019\nsubsidy rather than benefiting the targeted consumers.  In this context, the reforms in\nthe management of the food economy announced in the Union Budget 2001-02 such\nas enlarging the role of state governments in both procurement and distribution of\nfoodgrains for Public Distribution System (PDS), review of the operations of the4Essential Commodities Act (1955) to facilitate free inter-state movement of\nfoodgrains and reduction in the list of essential commodities are meant to enhance the\nefficiency of the food procurement and distribution system.\n12.As per the revised estimates in the Union Budget, the fiscal deficit of the\nCentral Government for 2000-01 was placed at Rs.1,11,972 crore as against budget\nestimate of Rs.1,11,275 crore.  This containment of fiscal deficit facilitated the task of\nmonetary and debt management as the market borrowing programme of the Central\nGovernment  (Rs.1,15,183 crore gross and Rs.73,787 crore net) could be put through\nwithout undue pressure on interest rates.  The state governments' net market\nborrowings of Rs.12,880 crore were almost the same as Rs.12,886 crore in the\nprevious year. The estimated reduction in fiscal deficit to 4.7 per cent of GDP for\n2001-02 and the promise of the Fiscal Responsibility Legislation should provide an\nenabling environment for smooth conduct of debt management.\n13.As emphasised in the previous policy statements, the overall monetary\nmanagement becomes difficult when a large and growing borrowing programme of\nthe government, year after year, puts pressure on the absorptive capacity of the\nmarket.  The banking system even now holds government securities of around 35.0\nper cent of its net demand and time liabilities as against the minimum statutory\nrequirement of 25.0 per cent.  In terms of volume, such holdings above the statutory\nliquidity ratio (SLR) amounted to as much as Rs.1,00,000 crore, which is substantially\nhigher than  the net annual borrowings of the government.  In this context, the effort\ntowards fiscal consolidation aimed at in the Union Budget for 2001-02 is a very\nwelcome development. The reduction in fiscal deficit coupled with lowering of\ninterest rates on contractual savings would facilitate a move towards a favourable\ninterest rate regime.  This should also help in releasing  government resources for\nmuch needed investment in physical and social infrastructure, which in turn could\nstimulate private investment. Further gains from a sustained fiscal consolidation will\nbe realised over a period of time through stabilisation of inflationary expectations in\nthe economy.\n14.The average cost of primary issuance of Government of India (GOI) dated\nsecurities came down to 10.95 per cent during 2000-01 from 11.77 per cent in the\nprevious year, a decline in interest cost of over 80 basis points. There was also a5perceptible downward shift in secondary market yields on government securities\nacross the maturity spectrum during the second half of the year.   The yield on\ngovernment securities with one-year residual maturity which had peaked to 10.82 per\ncent in August 2000 from 9.23 per cent in April 2000 has subsequently moderated to\n9.05 per cent by March 2001. Thus, there has been a reduction in yield of as much as\n180 basis points (or 1.8 percentage points) in these securities since August 2000.\nSimilarly, the yield on government securities with 10-year residual maturity which\nhad risen from 10.37 per cent in April 2000 to 11.57 per cent in September 2000 fell\nto 10.36 per cent by March 2001.\n15.In view of the easy liquidity conditions and softer interest rate environment,\nthe overall monetary conditions are at present reasonably comfortable.  However, last\nyear\u2019s experience once again confirms that monetary management has now become\nmuch more complex than was the case even a few years ago. This is because of\nseveral factors, such as the on-going integration of financial markets across the world,\nthe phenomenal increase in financial turnover, liberalization of the economy, and the\nrapidity with which unanticipated domestic and international tremors get transmitted\nto financial markets across the world because of the new technology.  It will be\nrecalled that at the beginning of the last financial year, the Reserve Bank had taken\nsteps to ease monetary policy. However, these measures had to be quickly reversed\n(in July 2000), in view of unfavourable international developments, particularly\nsuccessive increases in interest rates in major industrial economies. The need to\nquickly change the policy stance in the light of emerging situation has also been the\nexperience of other monetary authorities including the US and European central\nbanks. It is important to emphasise this, as, in case the present economic\ncircumstances change, it may again become necessary to take appropriate monetary\nmeasures which may not be in consonance with the present easy conditions. Keeping\nthese realities in view, it is particularly important for banks and financial institutions\nto make adequate allowances for unforeseen contingencies in their business plans, and\nfully take into account the implications of changes in the monetary and external\nenvironment on their operations.\n16.A factor which further complicates the conduct of monetary policy during\ncertain periods is the difficulty in the correct assessment of the potential  inflationary6pressures based on the latest available data for the current period.  While the WPI and\nCPI inflation rates generally move in tandem, there were periods in which one rate\nwidely differed from the other in opposite directions. For instance, during the period\n1995-96 to 1998-99, the CPI inflation ruled significantly higher than the WPI, while\nduring 1999-2000 and 2000-01, the reverse is true. Secondly, while there is little\ndisagreement that in the medium to long-run, inflation is largely caused by monetary\nexpansion, in the short-run inflation could be affected by non-monetary and supply\nside factors. It may be recalled that during the early part of 1998-99, the headline\ninflation rate as measured by variations  in WPI had shown a sharp increase following\nsubstantial rise in prices of certain food items such as fruits and vegetables and in\nOctober 1998, a conscious decision was taken, not to tighten the reins of monetary\npolicy, since such an increase in prices emanated from temporary supply problems.\nThe inflation rate reversed itself as the supply situation improved, and the monetary\npolicy stance taken earlier proved to be correct.  (However, the position could have\nturned out to be different if inflationary pressures had persisted or accelerated due to\nemergence of unexpected demand or supply side pressures.)\n17.We faced a similar situation in most part of 2000-01 when the increase in the\noverall inflation rate emanated from the sharp increase in international crude prices. If\nthe increase in prices on account of petroleum related sub-group is excluded from the\nWPI, the inflation rate which peaked to 4.8 per cent in mid-January 2001, has since\ncome down to 2.6 per cent by end-March 2001. It, therefore, becomes extremely\nimportant to appreciate the underlying inflation rate from different angles before\nbuilding up an appropriate policy stance. The Reserve Bank will continue its on-going\nwork on further refinement of the methodology for assessment of the inflationary\noutlook based on different indices and a set of monetary indicators which could best\nguide the formulation of monetary policy in a changing environment.\n18.In the Statement of April 1999, a mention was made about the need for\ndeveloping a robust short-term operational model for better understanding of the\ntransmission mechanism of the monetary policy. In line with this, a liquidity\nassessment model is being structured, on the basis of available data,  so as to assess\nboth the mechanism and inter-linkages among different segments of the financial\nsystem.7External Developments\n19.There were significant changes in the external environment after April 2000\nwhen the last annual Policy Statement was presented.  It may be recalled that during\nthe year 1999-2000, despite a sharp increase in oil prices, foreign currency assets of\nIndia had increased by US $ 5.5 billion and forex market was generally stable. This\nposition changed markedly during the first half of the year 2000-01, particularly\nduring the period mid-May to mid-August 2000. In view of the continued high oil\nprices, combined with successive increases in interest rates in the US and Europe and\nlower capital inflows, there was a decline in India\u2019s foreign currency assets by US $\n2.5 billion in the first six months of the year. Forex markets also witnessed\nconsiderable instability with rupee depreciating against US dollar by 5.3 per cent\nbetween April and September 2000.  During this period, US dollar also appreciated\nagainst other major currencies, such as the Euro and the Pound Sterling.\n20.The second half of the year, however, saw a sharp turnaround in the forex\nmarket. India\u2019s  foreign currency assets increased by about US $ 7.0 billion, and\nexchange rate movements were generally orderly and range-bound. This favourable\ndevelopment was largely due to restoration of confidence in India\u2019s external prospects\nin view of the highly successful launch of the India Millennium Deposits (IMD)\nscheme by the State Bank of India, which attracted deposits of US $ 5.5 billion. It is\nsignificant that, excluding the effect of IMD scheme, there was actually an increase of\nUS $ 1.5 billion in India\u2019s foreign currency assets during the second half of the year\n(as against a decline of US $ 2.5 billion during the first half of the year on a\ncomparable basis).\n21.The sharp turnaround in the foreign exchange situation and the behaviour of\nforex markets during the previous year is highly instructive for management of the\nexternal sector. As mentioned above, the behaviour of the forex market was sharply\ndifferent during the two halves of the year, even though there was no significant\nchange in the \u2018real\u2019 economy or important economic variables, such as, the growth\nrate, trade deficit or oil prices. Reserves in the first half of the year averaged US $\n36.7 billion, which was several times higher than the additional cost of oil imports or\neven the size of anticipated current account deficit. Exports also did well throughout8the year with an average growth (in US dollar terms) of 20.1 per cent in the first half\nand 16.3 per cent in the second half (up to February 2001). In May 2000, the Reserve\nBank had also announced that, as and when necessary, it would directly meet the\nforeign exchange requirements for imports by the Indian Oil Corporation as well as\ngovernment debt service payments in order to meet the temporary demand-supply\ngaps.  Yet, forex markets showed considerable instability and anxiety during the first\nhalf as compared with the second half of the year.  An analysis of the behaviour of the\nmarket during these two periods, leads to following broad conclusions.\n\u2022 The day-to-day movements, in the short-run, in foreign exchange markets\nhave little to do with the so-called \u2018fundamentals\u2019 or country\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its payments obligations, including debt service. Any adverse news, and\n\u2018expectations\u2019 generated by it tend to play a paramount role. Adverse\nexpectations are also generally self-fulfilling because of their adverse effect on\n\u201cleads and lags\u201d in export/import receipts and payments, remittances and\ninter-bank positions.\n\u2022 In view of inter-bank activity, which sets the pace in forex markets,\ntransaction volumes in \u201cgross\u201d terms are several times higher, and more\nvariable, than \u201cnet\u201d flows. Exchange rates are more sensitive to \u201cgross\u201d flows,\nand variability in \u201cgross\u201d flows in turn is sensitive to exchange rate\nexpectations.\n\u2022 Any initial adverse movement, following bad news or unfavourable\ndevelopment may get exacerbated because of greater inter-bank activity.\nGiven the \u201cbandwagon\u201d effect of any adverse movement and the herd\nbehaviour of market participants, the situation can lead to further buying or\nhedging activity among non-bank participants. The \u201cDaily Earnings At Risk\u201d\n(DEAR) strategies of risk management tends to reinforce herd behaviour.\nThere is a natural tendency to do what everyone else is doing in the event of\nany adverse development rather than taking a contra position, particularly in\nthin and underdeveloped markets dominated by a few leading operators.\n\u2022 Developing countries generally have smaller and localised forex markets\nwhere nominal domestic currency values are expected to show a depreciating\ntrend, particularly if relative inflation rates are higher than those of major\nindustrial countries.  In this situation, there is a greater tendency among\nmarket participants to hold long positions in foreign currencies and to hold\nback sales when expectations are adverse and currencies are depreciating, than\nthe other way round when currencies are appreciating and expectations are\nfavourable. Thus, market behaviour is not symmetrical in both directions.\n\u2022 The tendency of importers/exporters and other end-users to look at exchange\nrate movements as a source of return without adopting appropriate risk\nmanagement strategies, at times, creates severe uneven supply-demand9conditions, often based on \u201cnews and views\u201d.  A self-sustaining triangle of\nsupply demand mismatch, increased inter-bank activity to take advantage of it\nand accentuated volatility triggered by negative sentiments, not in tune with\nfundamentals can be set in motion, requiring quick intervention/response by\nauthorities.\n22.The above realities of the foreign exchange markets make the task of\ndetermining appropriate exchange rate and market intervention policies extremely\ndifficult for central banks all over the world. In principle, and in theory, there is a\nstrong case for either freely floating exchange rates (without intervention) or a\ncurrency board type arrangement of fixed rates. In practice, however, because of the\noperational realities of foreign exchange markets, empirical research shows that most\ncountries have adopted intermediate regimes of various types including fixed pegs,\ncrawling pegs, fixed rates within bands, managed floats with no pre-announced path,\nand independent floats with foreign exchange intervention moderating the rate of\nchange and preventing undue fluctuations. By and large, barring a few, most countries\nhave some variety of \u201cmanaged\u201d floats and central banks intervene in the market\nperiodically.\n23.Part of the reason for concern with exchange rate is also the likely effect of\nadverse developments in forex market on the real economy, as has been seen in East\nAsia, Russia, Mexico and Brazil a couple of years ago, and Turkey and Argentina\ncurrently. The \u201ccontagion\u201d effect is quick, and a sharp change in the currency value\ncan affect the real economy more than proportionately. Exporters may suffer if there\nis unanticipated sharp appreciation and debtors or other corporates may be affected\nbadly if there is a sharp depreciation, which can also lead to bank failures and\nbankruptcies.\n24.Against this background, India\u2019s exchange rate policy of focusing on\nmanaging volatility with no fixed rate target while allowing the underlying demand\nand supply conditions to determine the exchange rate movements over a period in an\norderly way has stood the test of time. Despite several unexpected external and\ndomestic developments, India\u2019s external situation continues to remain satisfactory.\nRBI will continue to follow the same approach of watchfulness, caution and\nflexibility in regard to forex market in the current year also.1025.Our own experience last year, has highlighted the importance of building up\nforeign exchange reserves to take care of unforeseen contingencies, volatile capital\nflows and other developments which can affect expectations adversely.  The emerging\neconomies have to rely largely on their own resources during external exigencies (or\ncontagion) as there is no international  \u201clender of last resort\u201d to provide additional\nliquidity at short notice on acceptable terms. Thus, the need for adequate reserves is\nunlikely to be eliminated or reduced even if exchange rates are allowed to float freely.\nSharp exchange rate movements can be highly disequilibrating and costly for the\neconomy during periods of uncertainty or adverse expectations, whether real or\nimaginary.  These economic costs are likely to be substantially higher than the net\nfinancial cost, if any, of holding reserves. The success of the IMD scheme last year,\nand the confidence generated by it was a crucial factor in stabilizing India\u2019s forex\nmarkets and containing risks to the real economy in the second half of the year.\n26.The overall approach to the management of India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves\nin recent years has reflected the changing composition of balance of payments, and\nhas endeavoured to reflect the \u201cliquidity risks\u201d associated with different types of\nflows and other requirements. The policy for reserve management is thus judiciously\nbuilt upon a host of identifiable factors and other contingencies. Such factors, inter\nalia, include: the size of the current account deficit; the size of short-term liabilities\n(including current repayment obligations on long-term loans); the possible variability\nin portfolio investments and other types of capital flows; the unanticipated pressures\non the balance of payments arising out of external shocks (such as the impact of the\nEast Asian crisis in 1997-98 or increase in oil prices in 1999-2000); and movements\nin the repatriable foreign currency deposits of non-resident Indians.  Taking these\nfactors into account, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are at present  comfortable.\nHowever, there can be no cause for complacency. We must continue to ensure that,\nleaving aside short-term variations in reserve levels, the quantum of reserves in the\nlong-run is in line with the growth in the economy and the size of risk-adjusted capital\nflows.  This will provide us with greater security against unfavourable or\nunanticipated developments, which can occur quite suddenly.\n27.The developments in respect of India\u2019s balance of payments, particularly\nexports, also require continuous vigilance.  Fortunately, in       2000-01, exports have11done well and it is essential to keep up the momentum to ensure that balance of\npayments do not become a constraint on economic growth. In the past, several\nmeasures were introduced to ensure timely delivery of credit to exporters and remove\nprocedural hassles.    As indicated in the Mid-term Review of October 2000, the\nsuggestions received from exporters and export trade organisations were examined by\nRBI and the Bankers' Group and guidelines were issued to banks to further simplify\nprocedures for export credit.  These include adopting a flexible approach in\nnegotiating bills drawn against LCs over and above the sanctioned limits, delegating\ndiscretionary/higher sanctioning powers to branches, authorisation to branches for\ndisbursing a certain percentage of enhanced/ad-hoc limits pending sanction, to\nincorporate all sanctions including waiver of submission of order/LC for every\ndisbursal and export credit and submission of a statement of orders/LCs in hand at\nperiodical intervals in the sanction letter and advise ECGC immediately about the\nterms of sanction to facilitate faster claim settlement.\n28.RBI has been arranging seminars at major exporting centres for the benefit of\nexporters and branch level bank officials for resolving the problems relating to export\ncredit and meeting foreign currency requirements.  RBI has also been holding\nmeetings of All India Export Advisory Committee (AIEAC) at quarterly intervals for\ndeliberating on the issues raised by exporter organisations and taking appropriate\naction.  Further, exporters have also been advised that they can call on concerned\nsenior officials of RBI on any working day during a designated time-slot without prior\nappointment for redressal of their grievances. In order to have a feedback on\nsimplification of procedures by RBI for export credit delivery as also the level of\nexporters\u2019 satisfaction with bank services, it is proposed to conduct a survey with the\nhelp of an independent outside agency.\n29.As a step t owards simplification of procedures in the field of exports, all status\nholders (export/trading/super trading houses) and manufacturer exporters who are\nexporting more than one-half of their production and recognised as such by the\nDirectorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), have recently been extended a\nsimplified facility to write off their export outstandings to the extent of 5.0 per cent of\ntheir average annual export realisation in the preceding three years.1230.For mitigating the problems of exporter s due to the severe earthquake,\nguidelines have been issued to banks for providing relief/concessions.  These include\nextending the period of packing credit, conversion of dues into short-term loans\nrepayable in suitable instalments and relaxation in NPA classification norms.\n31.In the recent period, procedure of financial transactions such as remittances,\ninvestments and maintenance of bank accounts, etc., for non-resident Indians (NRIs)\nhas been considerably simplified and the feedback from the NRIs on this count has\nbeen very positive.  The Reserve Bank would continue to welcome suggestions for\nfurther improving various facilities pertaining to NRIs.\n32.Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) can invest in a company under the\nportfolio investment route up to 24.0 per cent of the paid-up capital of the company\nwhich could now be increased to 49.0 per cent (40.0 per cent earlier) by the concerned\nIndian company by passing a resolution by its Board of Directors followed by passing\nof a special resolution to that effect by its General Body.\n33.In order to encourage foreign investment, foreign direct investment (FDI) is\npermitted under the automatic route for most activities except in certain circumstances\nand for a very small negative list. New foreign investment proposals in the IT sector\nhave been allowed automatic approval irrespective of whether the investor has an\nexisting joint venture or technical collaboration in the country. No monetary ceilings\nhave been placed on investment under the automatic route.  Foreign Investment\nPromotion Board (FIPB) now considers applications for FDI up to 100 per cent for oil\nrefining sector, business-to-business e-commerce and internet service providers (ISPs)\nsubject to certain conditions.   FDI under the automatic route has been permitted up to\n100 per cent for all manufacturing activities (with certain exceptions) in Special\nEconomic Zones (SEZs). As announced in the Union Budget, FDI in Non-Banking\nFinancial Companies (NBFCs) will be put on the automatic route.  Foreign equity\nparticipation up to 26 per cent has been allowed in the insurance sector subject to\nissue of necessary licence by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority\n(IRDA).  The Reserve Bank has given general permission to Indian companies which\nare eligible under the automatic route or have SIA/FIPB approval to issue shares to\ntheir foreign collaborators, subject only to certain reporting requirements.1334.Continuing with the policy of liberalisation of the capital account following\nthe announcement made in the Union Budget in March 2001, a number of steps have\nbeen taken to improve liquidity in the ADR/GDR market and to give opportunity to\nIndian shareholders to divest their shareholding in the ADR/GDR market abroad.\nThus, two-way fungibility in ADR/GDR issues of Indian companies has been\nintroduced, subject to sectoral caps, wherever applicable.  Stockbrokers in India have\nnow been allowed to purchase shares and deposit these with the Indian custodians for\nissue of ADRs/GDRs by the overseas depository to the extent of those being\nconverted into underlying shares.  Indian companies have been permitted to sponsor\nADR/GDR issues with an overseas depository against shares held by a shareholder,\nwho wish to use this option subject to compliance with Foreign Currency Convertible\nBonds and Ordinary Shares (through Depository Receipt Mechanism) Scheme, 1993\nand guidelines issued by the Government.\n35.Indian companies wishing to make acquisitions of foreign companies or direct\ninvestment abroad in Joint Ventures/Wholly Owned Subsidiaries can now invest up to\nUS $ 50 million on an annual basis through automatic route without being subject to\nthe three year profitability condition.  Additional block allocation of foreign exchange\nover the limit of US $ 50 million is available to companies with proven track record,\nsubject to certain conditions. Companies may invest 100 per cent of the proceeds of\ntheir ADR/GDR issues for acquisitions of foreign companies and direct investments\nin Joint Ventures and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries. Any Indian company that has\nissued ADRs/GDRs may now acquire shares of foreign companies engaged in the\nsame area of core activity up to an amount of US dollar 100 million or an amount\nequivalent to ten times of their exports in the previous year, whichever is higher.\nEarlier, such stock swap facility was available only to Indian companies in certain\nsectors. Partnership firms providing certain specified professional services, viz.,\nchartered accountancy, legal services, medical and health care services, information\ntechnology and entertainment software related services are allowed to invest abroad in\nforeign concerns in the same line of activity subject to certain criteria.\n36.In order to provide stimulus to the growth of the  venture capital industry in\nIndia, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been made the single point\nnodal agency for registration of both domestic and overseas venture capital funds14which are allowed to invest through the automatic route, subject to SEBI regulations.\nGeneral permission has been granted to SEBI registered Foreign Venture Capital\nInvestments (FVCIs) to invest in Indian Venture Capital Undertakings (IVCUs) or in\na Venture Capital Fund (VCF) and divest its investments at any price mutually\nacceptable to the buyer and the seller.\n37. In order to provide appropriate information, \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d\n(FAQs) on various topics relating to foreign exchange matters  have also been made\navailable on RBI\u2019s website ( www.fema.rbi.org.in ).  In addition, for queries from\npublic relating to specific transactions, eight dedicated e-mail addresses have been\nprovided on RBI\u2019s website covering different types of transactions.\n38.The Reserve Ba nk will continue with its efforts to simplify procedure, reduce\ndocumentation requirements and further liberalise opportunities for productive\ninvestment in India by NRIs and others and by Indian corporates abroad.  Further\nsuggestions by experts, corporates and market participants in these areas would be\nwelcome.\nII. Stance of Monetary Policy for 2001-02\n39.During March 2001, the equity markets experienced considerable turbulence\nand uncertainty leading to problems in certain stock exchanges as well as\nliquidity/insolvency problems in some co-operative banks, which in turn affected\ncertain commercial banks also.  An important priority of the Reserve Bank during this\ndifficult period was to try and minimise the \u201ccontagion\u201d spreading from equity\nmarkets to money and government securities markets or to the banking system as a\nwhole. In order to achieve this objective, it was necessary to provide assurance of\nsufficient collateralised liquidity to banks, and to take early action to prevent the\nproblem affecting particular co-operative banks in one region from spreading to other\nfinancial institutions. By and large, so far, money market as well as government\nsecurities market have continued to function normally.  Further, there has been no\nreduction in market liquidity in spite of some cases of payment delays/defaults. There\nhas also been no immediate adverse impact of stock market turbulence on interest\nrates.1540.The recent experience in equity markets, and its aftermath, have thrown up\nnew challenges for the regulatory system as well as for the conduct of monetary\npolicy. It has become evident that certain banks in the co-operative sector did not\nadhere to their prudential norms nor   to the well-defined regulatory guidelines for\nasset-liability management nor even to the requirement of meeting their inter-bank\npayment obligations. Even though such behaviour was confined to a few relatively\nsmall banks, by national standards, in two or three locations, it caused losses to some\ncorrespondent banks in addition to severe problems for depositors.  In the interest of\nfinancial stability, it is important to take measures to strengthen the regulatory\nframework for the co-operative sector by removing \u201cdual\u201d control by laying down\nclear-cut guidelines for their management structure and by enforcing further\nprudential standards in respect of access to uncollateralised funds and their lending\nagainst volatile assets.  In the light of recent experience, some corrective steps to\nprevent commercial banks from taking undue risks in their portfolio management are\nalso outlined in Part III of this Statement.\n41. The overall macroeconomic indicators, despite recent developments in the\nequity market, continue to be favourable for growth with price stability. As mentioned\nearlier, GDP growth is likely to be about 6.0 per cent in 2000-01 in line with the\nprojection indicated in the Mid-term Review. The \u201cheadline\u201d inflation rate at 4.9 per\ncent turned out to be lower than expected in the Mid-term Review. Excluding the\npetroleum sub-group, the inflation rate was 2.6 per cent as on March 31, 2001. The\nexternal sector was also comfortable during the year as a whole with exports doing\nwell and current account deficit expected to be considerably lower than 2.0 per cent of\nGDP. Money supply growth was also by and large in line with projected trajectory\nand the recent Budget has signalled a firm commitment towards fiscal consolidation\nand reduction in fiscal deficit.  The interest rates, after some hardening in mid-year,\nhad softened  in the later part of 2000-01.  The primary yields in Treasury Bills of\nvarious maturities which had risen from a range of 7.0-9.2 per cent in April 2000 to\nclose to 11.0 per cent in August 2000 have since declined to a range of 8.8-9.1 per\ncent by March 2001.  The primary yield on 10-year government securities has fallen\nfrom a peak of 11.7 per cent in October 2000 to 10.7 per cent in January 2001.  The\nsecondary market yields have also moved in tandem with the primary market.1642.While there is still consid erable uncertainty, it is widely expected that the\nworld GDP growth would be substantially lower in 2001 compared with a high\ngrowth of about 5.0 per cent in the previous year, driven by the slowdown of the US\neconomy. A favourable factor this year is that the international inflationary\nenvironment is reasonably benign. Low inflationary expectations have facilitated\nsubstantial reduction in international interest rates in order to revive economic activity\nin major industrial countries.  India cannot but reckon the impact of these global\ndevelopments though for several reasons, including its relatively small share of trade,\nGDP growth in India is unlikely to be as seriously affected by these developments, as\nin many other countries. While merchandise exports growth may slightly moderate,\nsoftware exports with more diversified destinations and private remittances may still\nbe maintained. The size of current account deficit is, therefore, expected to continue\nto be well within 2.0 per cent of GDP.\n43.The fiscal deficit of the Central Government is budgeted at 4.7 per cent of\nGDP for 2001-02 and the borrowing programme of the Centre at Rs.1,18,852 crore\n(gross) and Rs.77,353 crore (net).  While the borrowing programme in respect of\nsome States has come under stress, RBI expects to conduct debt management without\nserious pressure on overall liquidity and interest rates.\n44. Against this background, the Reserve Bank proposes to continue to ensure that\nall legitimate requirements for credit are met consistent with price stability. Towards\nthis objective, the Reserve Bank will continue its policy of active demand\nmanagement of liquidity through OMO, including two-way sale/purchase of Treasury\nBills, and further reduction in CRR as and when required. Unless circumstances\nchange unexpectedly, or current problems in some segments of the market are not\nresolved soon, on the present reckoning, it should also be possible to maintain the\ncurrent interest rate environment, and explore the  possibility of some further\nsoftening in medium and long-term rates over time, following the stance of interest\nrate flexibility announced in the recent Budget. However, as emphasized last year as\nwell as in Part I of this Statement, in formulating their business plans, banks and\nfinancial institutions should be prepared for a reversal or tightening of monetary\npolicy in case the underlying inflationary situation turns adverse or there are\nunfavourable and unexpected external developments.1745.A realistic projection of the overall grow th rate for the current year 2001-2002\nis presently difficult in view of uncertainties pertaining to the outlook for industrial\ngrowth.  As mentioned above, the objective conditions for revival of growth are\nfavourable, but the trend in growth of output and investment demand in the last\nquarter of the previous year has not been very encouraging.  Assuming revival of the\nindustrial sector from the next quarter, reasonable monsoon, and good performance of\nexports, for purposes of monetary policy formulation, for the year as a whole, growth\nrate of real GDP may be placed at 6.0 to 6.5 per cent.  The rate of inflation is assumed\nto be close to that in the previous year, i.e., within 5.0 per cent; the projected\nexpansion in broad money (M 3) for 2001-02 is about 14.5 per cent.  Consistent with\nprevailing elasticities, this order of growth in M 3 would lead to an increase in\naggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks at about the same rate (or about\nRs.1,34,000 crore).  Non-food bank credit adjusted for investment in commercial\npaper, shares/debentures/bonds of PSUs and private corporate sector is projected to\nincrease by 16.0 to 17.0 per cent.  This magnitude of credit expansion is expected to\nadequately meet the credit needs of the productive sectors of the economy.\n46.The Mid-term Review of October 1999 underlined the need to undertake\nconcrete steps to remove certain inherent rigidities so that the interest rate structure\ncan be made more flexible during different phases of the business cycle.  Since then,\nthere has been some easing of constraints on the flexibility of interest rates in the\nfinancial system as a whole. Assuming a continued positive outlook for inflationary\nexpectations, further flexibility would be facilitated if consistent progress is made in\ncertain directions. As emphasised in the Budget, there is urgent need for consistent\nand credible fiscal adjustment combined with flexibility in administered interest rates.\nThe financial system should also improve its operational efficiency and aim at further\nreduction in cost of intermediation.  In this regard, there is a need to improve the debt\nrecovery system so that the burden of NPAs on the financial system is eased.\nAlthough banks have been given the freedom to quote flexible and variable rates on\ndeposits, the bulk of the deposits are still at fixed rates which become unsustainable\nwhen lending rates are lowered. It is necessary for banks to undertake further\nimprovements in operational efficiency and active liability management for interest\nrate flexibility in line with changes in the inflationary outlook.  A reduction in fiscal18deficit and overall government borrowing programme could facilitate easing the\nregulatory burden in the banking system by reducing the relatively high level of CRR.\nThere is also a need to rationalise the tax regime so that tax-induced  distortions in\neffective rates of return between different instruments and markets are avoided.\n47.  The Bank Rate changes by RBI combined with CRR and repo rate changes\nhave emerged as signalling devices for interest rate changes and important tools of\nliquidity and monetary management. The Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)\nintroduced since June 2000 has proved to be an effective mechanism for absorbing\nand/or injecting liquidity on a day-to-day basis in a more flexible manner and, in the\nprocess, providing a corridor for the call money market.  The experience with LAF\nhas been satisfactory and RBI\u2019s endeavour will be to make it more efficient, by\nremoving some of the existing institutional, procedural and technological constraints.\nThe Reserve Bank will also continue with its effort to bring about orderly\ndevelopment and smooth functioning of financial markets and takes further steps in\nfinancial sector reforms.\n48.In sum, under normal circumstances and barring emergence of any adverse\nand unexpected developments in domestic or external sectors, the overall stance of\nmonetary policy for 2001-02 will be:\n\u2022 Provision of adequate liquidity to meet credit growth and support revival of\ninvestment demand while continuing a vigil on movements in the price level.\n\u2022 Within the overall framework of imparting greater flexibility to the interest\nrate regime in the medium-term, to continue the present stable interest rate\nenvironment with a preference for softening to the extent the evolving\nsituation warrants.\nIII. Financial Sector Reforms and\nMonetary Policy Measures\n49.The recent annual Policy Statements as well as Mid-term Reviews have\nfocussed on the structural measures to strengthen the financial system and to improve\nthe functioning of the various segments of financial markets. The main objectives of\nthese measures have been to increase operational effectiveness of monetary policy,\nredefine the regulatory role of the Reserve Bank, strengthen the prudential and\nsupervisory norms, improve the credit delivery system and develop the technological19and institutional infrastructure of the financial sector.  In this year\u2019s Policy also, it is\nproposed to make further progress in these areas.   As far as possible, changes of\nstructural nature being proposed have been decided after extensive consultations with\nexperts and market participants.\n50.As announced before, the short-term credit and regulatory measures, like\nchanges in the Bank Rate or CRR, do not necessarily form a part of bi-annual Policy\nStatements. These short-term measures are announced, from time to time, in the light\nof emerging developments in the domestic and international financial markets.  Thus,\nrecently after a review of developments in the international and domestic financial\nmarkets, Reserve Bank lowered the Bank Rate and CRR on February 16, 2001.  A\nfurther reduction in the Bank Rate was announced after the Budget on March 1, 2001.\nNo further changes in CRR or the Bank Rate are being proposed just now.  These will\nbe announced as and when considered necessary in the light of overall monetary and\nother developments.\nReview of Liquidity Adjustment Facility - Stage II\n51.As indicated in April 2000 Policy Statement, the sc heme of Liquidity\nAdjustment Facility (LAF) is being introduced progressively in three convenient\nstages in order to ensure smooth transition.  In the first stage, with effect from June 5,\n2000, the Additional Collateralised Lending Facility (ACLF) and Level II support to\nPrimary Dealers (PDs) were replaced by variable rate repo auctions with the same day\nsettlement. The second stage of LAF envisages replacement of Collateralised Lending\nFacility (CLF) and Level I support to PDs by variable rate repo auctions.  It was\nindicated that the effective date for the second stage would be decided in consultation\nwith banks and PDs.  On the basis of experience gained and wide ranging\nconsultations, it has been decided to move forward to implement the second stage in\nwell defined steps, as described below.  The third stage envisages multiple auctions\nintra-day, which will become feasible with the proposed introduction of electronic\ntransfers of funds and securities.\n52.An internal Group has reviewed the scheme taki ng into account feedback\nreceived from the market participants and have made several suggestions to make the\nLAF more effective. The working of the LAF was also considered by the Technical20Advisory Committee on Money and Government Securities Markets.  A seminar was\nalso organised sometime ago by Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives\nAssociation (FIMMDA) on the subject. By and large, it has been observed that LAF\nhas been working satisfactorily as a flexible instrument for injecting/absorbing\nliquidity and also as an interest rate signal for the short-term money market.  The\nsuggestions emerging from these consultations broadly relate to the procedural\naspects relating to the auctions, the need for a second level support, etc., so as to make\nthe LAF operationally more flexible and hassle free.\n53.The experience with the LAF has also shown that the LAF can be made fully\neffective only when it becomes the primary instrument of liquidity adjustment and the\nother forms of liquidity support to the system, viz., collateralised lending facility and\nexport credit refinance to banks and liquidity support to PDs are gradually replaced\nwith the LAF. However, these facilities were granted on certain specific\nconsiderations in the past.  The replacement of these facilities has, therefore, to be\nstructured and staggered over a reasonable period so that the transition to LAF as a\nprimary instrument does not cause any serious operational problems for banks and\nPDs to adjust their asset-liability positions smoothly.\n54.Yet another requirement for the LAF to become fully effective is the need to\nmove towards a pure inter-bank call/notice money market and the need to create\nopportunities for activating the repo market with adequate safeguards and for other\nalternative short-term investment options to the non-bank participants, which are at\npresent allowed to lend in the call/notice money market.\n55.Taking into account the above considerations, it is proposed to announce a\npackage of measures encompassing changes in operating procedures of LAF\nincluding auction methods and periods, a strategy for smooth transition of call money\nmarket to pure inter-bank market and a comprehensive and coherent programme for\nrationalisation of liquidity support available to the system at present, through various\nfacilities for different requirements of the market. It is also proposed to announce\ncertain complementary and associated measures in money and government securities\nmarkets.  The package as a whole is expected to provide considerable operational\nflexibility to the market participants enhancing smooth flow of funds across21instruments and participants resulting in further integration of money market, thereby\nimproving it as a more effective transmission channel of monetary policy.\n56.The scheme will, as usual be constantly under review in consultation with the\nmarket participants and the Technical Advisory Committee on Money and\nGovernment Securities Markets with a view to refining and improving procedural and\noperational aspects.\n(a) Changes in Standing Liquidity\nFacilities Available to the System and\nIntroduction of Back-stop Facility\n57.At present, banks are provided with liquidity support at the Bank Rate under\ntwo schemes, viz., (i) Collateralised Lending Facility  (CLF) which is available to\neach scheduled commercial bank at a level of 0.125 per cent of its average aggregate\ndeposits during the year 1997-98 and (ii) export credit refinance to the extent of 50.0\nper cent of the increase in its outstanding export credit eligible for refinance over the\nlevel of such outstanding as on February 16, 1996. The PDs are provided at present\nwith collateralised liquidity support, and PD-wise limits are based on certain norms\nrelating to their commitments to RBI.\n58.When the LAF wa s reviewed, it was felt that for a smooth transition to full-\nfledged operation of LAF, the system would need a back-stop facility at a variable\nrate of interest, as a cushion, over and above the support available through standing\nliquidity facilities at the Bank Rate and through the LAF operations in daily auctions.\n59.Taking the above features into account and the need for a gradual switchover\nto the subsequent stage of LAF, the following modifications to the present standing\nliquidity facilities are announced:\n\u2022 It is proposed to split the standing liquidity facilities available from RBI into\ntwo parts, viz., (i) normal facility and  (ii) back-stop facility.  Accordingly, the\ntotal quantum of support available to banks under CLF and export credit\nrefinance, and the quantum of support available for PDs will be spilt into two\ncomponents, i.e., normal facility and back-stop facility.\n\u2022 The normal facility will be provided at the Bank Rate. The back-stop facility\nwill be provided at a variable daily rate.  The variable rate would be linked to\ncut-off rates emerging in regular LAF auctions and in the absence of such22rates, to National Stock Exchange \u2013 Mumbai \u2013 Inter-bank Offer Rate (NSE-\nMIBOR) as detailed below:\n(i) The variable rate for the back-stop facility, to be fixed on a daily\nbasis would be 1.0 percentage point over the reverse repo cut-off\nrate at which funds were injected earlier during the day in the\nregular LAF repos auctions.\n(ii) Where no reverse repo bid was accepted as part of LAF auction,\nthe rate will be 2.0 to 3.0 percentage points over the repo cut-off\nrate of the day emerged in LAF auction as may be decided by RBI.\n(iii) In case no bids were accepted earlier during the day at either repo\nor reverse repo auctions, the rate will be 2.0 to 3.0 percentage\npoints over NSE-MIBOR as may be decided by RBI.\n\u2022 Back-stop facility would be operated till close of banking hours.\n\u2022 Of the total limits of liquidity support available to PDs and banks, the normal\nfacility would initially constitute about two-thirds and the back-stop facility\nabout one-third.  PD-wise and bank-wise limits will be announced separately.\n60.At present, banks are provided export credit refinance on the basis of\noutstanding export credit eligible for refinance on an incremental  basis over a base\ndate.  It has been observed that some banks which had large exposure to the export\nsector on the base date are either unable to get any refinance from RBI or they have\nvery small entitlements.  For instance, a bank, which had an outstanding credit, say,\n30.0 per cent of total advances as on February 16, 1996 and an outstanding credit of\nthe same absolute amount in a recent period, does not get any refinance facility as per\nthe current formula even though as a percentage of total advances, export credit may\nconstitute a very high proportion.  It has, therefore, been decided to rationalize the\nexport credit refinance facility so that the facility reflects more closely the extent of\ntotal credit support being provided by banks to exporters.  Now, the limits would be\nfixed on the basis of total outstanding export credit eligible instead of the incremental\nexport credit eligible over a base date.\n61.It has accordingly been decided that with effect from the fortnight beginning\nMay 5, 2001, scheduled commercial banks would be provided export credit refinance\nto the extent of 15.0 per cent of the outstanding export credit eligible for refinance as\nat the end of the second preceding fortnight. With the change in formula, the23illustrative bank mentioned above will continue to remain entitled to a certain\npercentage of refinance. In case the volume of export credit by these banks increases,\ntheir refinance facility will also correspondingly increase.\n62.As a matter of further comfort to all banks, the existing ref inance limit as on\nMay 4, 2001 as per the current formula will constitute the minimum limit available\nfor a bank up to March 31, 2002.\n \n63.All the above revisions will be effective from the fortnight beginning May 5,\n2001.\n(b) Changes in LAF Operating Procedures\n64.The following measures relate to LAF operating procedures:\n\u2022 The minimum bid size for LAF is being reduced from the existing Rs.10 crore\nto Rs.5 crore to add further operational flexibility to the scheme and enable\nsmall level operators to participate.\n\u2022 The LAF timing is being advanced by 30 minutes - 10.30 a.m. for receipt of\nbids and for announcement of results to 12.00 noon.\n\u2022 With a view to stabilising market expectations and arresting volatility in call\nrates, it has been decided to provide the market with additional information.\nThe market would be provided with information on the scheduled commercial\nbanks\u2019 aggregate cash balances maintained with RBI on a cumulative basis\nduring the fortnight with a lag of two days.\n\u2022 At present, repo auctions are conducted without any pre-announced rate and\nbids are accepted on the basis of uniform price method.  With a view to\nproviding quick interest rate signals, when necessary, in order to meet\nunexpected domestic or external developments, RBI will henceforth have an\nadditional option to switchover to fixed rate repos on overnight basis; but this\noption is expected to be sparingly used.  For the purpose of such repos, the\nrates of interest intended to be offered would be announced as part of auction\nannouncement on the previous evening or before 10.00 a.m. on the day of\nauction, if necessary.\n\u2022 In addition to overnight repos, RBI will also have the discretion to introduce\nlonger-term repos up to 14 day period as and when required.\n65.At present, au ctions under LAF are conducted on uniform price basis.\nUniform price auction has the advantage of setting a single repo rate for absorption or\ninjection of funds. Further, unlike multiple price auction, there is no problem of so24called \u201cwinner\u2019s curse\u201d, as all the successful bidders get the same rate.  However, an\nimportant disadvantage of the uniform price system is that, as bidders are sure to\nsucceed at the most favourable rate, there is a possibility of indiscriminate or\nirresponsible bidding out of alignment with the market. Under multiple price auction,\non the other hand, as bidders get differential rates in accordance to their need and\nassessment of cost, greater commitment to bidding is likely to be ensured and the\nintensity of demand in the market is clearly reflected in the bidding pattern. While\nthere is no conclusive evidence about the superiority of one method over the other,\ncountry experience shows that both the methods are used for different instruments and\nat different times, depending upon the circumstances.   The issue between the two\nauction methods under LAF was discussed recently in a FIMMDA Seminar and a\nview had emerged that RBI should at this stage switchover to multiple price auction\nsystem.  It has, therefore, been decided to introduce multiple price auction (in place of\nexisting uniform price auction) on an experimental basis for one month period during\nMay 2001. The system would be evaluated on the basis of experience. The weighted\naverage cut-off yield in case of multiple price auction would be released to the public\nwhich along with cut-off rates will provide a band for call money market to operate.\n66.The medium-term objective is to move over gradually to liquidity adjustment\nonly through LAF combined with back-stop facility at variable rates as mentioned\nearlier and to do away with various specific standing liquidity facilities available now\nat the Bank Rate.\n(c) Rationalisation of Interest Rates on Export Credit\n67.At present, export credit is provided by prescribing speci fic rates of interest on\npre-shipment credit and mostly as a ceiling in the case of post-shipment credit.\nHenceforth, it is proposed to make interest rate on export credit extended by banks to\nbe indicated as a ceiling rate in respect of all categories so that interest rate charged by\nthe banks can actually be lower than the prescribed rate. Along with this, it is also\nproposed to link such ceiling rates to the Prime Lending Rates (PLRs) of respective\nbanks available to their other domestic borrowers.  Accordingly, in respect of pre-\nshipment credit up to 180 days, the ceiling rate applicable will be 1.5 percentage\npoints below the PLR  (Details are in Annexure-1); banks would be free to charge\ninterest rate below the ceiling rate prescribed, viz., 1.5 percentage points below PLR.2568.At present, banks prescribe PLR for short-term and also on tenor-linked basis\nfor different maturity periods. The application of interest rates on export credit by\nbanks will be on the basis of the relevant PLR prescribed by the bank.  Currently, the\ntenor-linked PLR up to 180 days by three major public sector banks is in the range of\n10.0-10.5 per cent.  Thus, the ceiling rates prescribed as above would result in the\nmajor public sector banks effectively reducing the interest rates on export credit by\nabout 1.0-1.5 percentage points to 8.5-9.0 per cent compared to the present prescribed\nlending rate of 10.0 per cent for pre-shipment credit up to 180 days (and as a ceiling\nfor post-shipment credit up to 90 days).  This is expected to introduce healthy\ncompetition and provide exporters a greater choice to avail of banking services in\nterms of interest rate, quality of service and transaction costs.\n69.It may be mentioned that at present, the forward premium for US dollars in the\nIndian market is around 4.5 per cent for 6 months.  An exporter can thus avail of\nrupee export credit at 8.5-9.0 per cent interest rate and sell the expected export\nearnings in the forward market, effectively reducing the interest cost to only around\n4.0-4.5 per cent, which is internationally highly competitive.\n70.Exporters now also have the option to avail of pre- and post-shipment credit in\nforeign currency which is available at a ceiling rate of LIBOR plus 1.5 percentage\npoints. With the ceiling rate on FCNR (B) deposits being changed to LIBOR (instead\nof LIBOR plus 0.5 percentage point \u2013 covered later in this Statement), it has been\ndecided to revise the ceiling rate on foreign currency loans for exports by banks to\nLIBOR plus 1.0 percentage point which will make this rate even more competitive.\n(d) Complementary Measures Associated with\nMoney and Government Securities Markets\n71.As part of streamlining the LAF and improving the transmission channel of\nmonetary policy, the following complementary and associated measures in respect of\nmoney and government securities markets are announced:\n(i) Moving towards Pure Inter-bank\nCall Money Market2672.In addition to select corporates, which route calls transactions through PDs,\nthere are several non-banks such as financial institutions and mutual funds, which are\npermitted to lend directly in the call/notice money market. Following the\nrecommendations of Narasimham Committee II, it was decided to move towards a\npure inter-bank (including PDs) call/notice money market.  With a view to planning a\nsmooth phasing out of these institutions from call/notice money market, as indicated\nin the Mid-term Review of October 2000, a Technical Group, which included\nrepresentatives from RBI, non-banks and banks was constituted.  The Group has since\nsubmitted its report. This report was placed on RBI website ( www.rbi.org.in ) on\nMarch 29, 2001 for further comments and suggestions from experts and other market\nparticipants.  The Group has, inter alia , recommended a strategy for gradually\nphasing out non-bank participation.  In the light of the recommendations of the Group\nand the feedback received on the recommendations, following steps are being taken:\n\u2022 Permission to corporates to route their call transactions through PDs would be\navailable up to June 30, 2001, as announced in the Mid-term Review of\nOctober 2000.\n\u2022 Access to other non-bank institutions (including financial institutions, mutual\nfunds and insurance companies) to operate in call/notice money market would\nbe gradually reduced in four stages:\n- In stage I, with effect from May 5, 2001 non-banks would be allowed\nto lend up to 85.0 per cent of their average daily lendings in call\nmarket during 2000-01.\n- In stage II, with effect from the date of operationalisation of Clearing\nCorporation, non-banks would be allowed to lend up to 70.0 per cent\nof their average daily lendings in call market during 2000-01.\n- In stage III, with effect from three months after stage II, access of\nnon-banks to call/notice money market would be equivalent to 40.0 per\ncent of their average daily lendings in call market during 2000-01.\n-  In stage IV, with effect from three months after stage III, access of\nnon-banks to call/notice money market would be equivalent to 10.0 per\ncent of their average daily lendings in call market during 2000-01.\n\u2022 From a date to be notified by RBI, after the on-set of stage IV, non-banks will\nnot be permitted to lend in call/notice money market.\n73.The above measures woul d allow sufficient time for market participants on\nboth lending and borrowing side to adjust their portfolios without any disruption in27the market as the programme will be implemented in four stages indicated, in line\nwith the recommendations of the Technical Group.  With the proposed establishment\nof the Clearing Corporation, repo operations would not only become more efficient, it\nwould also be possible to undertake repo transactions in non-government securities. It\nis envisaged that eventually both call money market and repo/reverse repo market\ncombined with market for other money market instruments like term money,\nCommercial Paper (CP), Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and Treasury Bills would\nconstitute an integrated market for equilibrating short-term funds for both banks and\nnon-banks.  Also such an integration is expected to make the money market an\neffective transmission channel for monetary policy.\n(ii) Shortening of Minimum Maturity\nPeriod of Term Deposits\n74.Interest rates on all term deposits are currently free and banks now offer an\narray of rates across maturities above 15 days, which is the minimum maturity for\nterm deposits. With a view to moving further towards deregulation, providing\nopportunities for non-banks to invest short-term surplus funds in a more flexible\nmanner when they are phased out from call money market and to enable banks to\nhave more flexibility in their Asset Liability Management (ALM), it has been decided\nto reduce the minimum maturity period for term deposits to 7 days from the present\n15 days at the discretion of individual banks.  But, this facility will be available only\nin respect of wholesale deposits of Rs.15 lakh and above where banks have the\nfreedom to offer differential rates according to size of deposits. However, the\nstipulation of minimum maturity of 15 days for CDs and CP will continue.\n(iii) Relaxation in Daily Minimum\nCash Reserve Ratio Maintenance\nRequirement\n75.As per the Reserve Bank of India Act, Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) has to be\nmaintained on an average daily basis during a reporting fortnight by all scheduled\nbanks. Along with lagged reserve maintenance, the minimum daily requirement was\nreduced to 65.0 per cent from the earlier 85.0 per cent to improve the cash\nmanagement of banks and for smooth inter-bank adjustment of liquidity. The\nminimum requirement is not, however, applicable to the reporting Friday of the\nfortnight.  It is now proposed to reduce the maintenance of daily minimum28requirement of 65.0 per cent to 50.0 per cent for the first seven days of the reporting\nfortnight while continuing with the minimum requirement of 65.0 per cent for the rest\nof the fortnight; this minimum requirement, however, will be applicable to all seven\ndays including the reporting Friday without any exception. This will come into force\nwith effect from the fortnight beginning August 11, 2001.  This will enable banks to\nhave further flexibility of holding reserves depending upon their intra-period cash\nflows.  This measure is expected to reduce volatility in the call money market.\n(iv) Interest on Cash Balances Maintained\nwith Reserve Bank of India under\nCash Reserve Ratio\n76.At present, all scheduled commercial banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks)\nare paid interest on eligible cash balances maintained with RBI under CRR\nrequirement at the rate of 4.0 per cent per annum. While the medium-term objective\nwill continue to be to reduce CRR to the statutory minimum, as an intermediate\nmeasure, interest rate on eligible balances will be aligned with the Bank Rate in two\nstages.  In the first stage, with effect from the fortnight beginning April 21, 2001, the\ninterest paid on eligible balances will be increased to 6.0 per cent.  At a subsequent\nstage, to be announced later, interest paid will be at the Bank Rate.\n(v) Exemption of Inter-bank Term\nLiability from Minimum Cash\nReserve Requirement\n77.At present, inter-bank liabilities are exempt from CRR prescription subject to\nthe minimum requirement of 3.0 per cent.  As inter-bank borrowings are of short-term\nnature and do not cause any secondary deposit expansion, it is proposed to exempt the\ninter-bank term liabilities of maturity of 15 days and above from the prescription of\nminimum CRR requirement of 3.0 per cent.  Besides a marginal saving on cost to\nbanks, this measure is expected to help in developing inter-bank term money market.\nThis measure will be effective from the fortnight beginning August 11, 2001 .\n(vi) Treasury Bill Market\n78.The present 14 day Treasury Bill and 182 day Treasury Bill auctions are\nproposed to be discontinued and instead, the notified amount in the 91 day Treasury\nBill auctions will be increased to Rs.250 crore.  The notified amount in the 364 day29Treasury Bill auction will remain at Rs.750 crore.  It is proposed to synchronise the\ndates of payment for both 91 day and 364 day Treasury Bills.  As such, both the 91\nday and 364 day Bills will mature on same dates and together they can provide\nadequate fungible stock of Treasury Bills of varying maturities in the secondary\nmarket. The market clearing yields and the increased floating stock which are\nfungible are expected to activate the secondary market in Treasury Bills.\n(vii) T plus 1 Settlement for SGL Settled Transactions\n79.Currently, transactions in government securities are required  to be settled on\nthe trade date or next working day unless the transaction is through a broker of a\npermitted stock exchange in which case settlement can be on     T plus 5 basis. With\nthe progress made in computerization of Public Debt Office (PDO), it is possible to\nhave pooled terminal facility located at Regional Offices across the country and\nmember-terminals paving the way for a Negotiated Dealing System (NDS)\n(Annexure-3).  In the proposed NDS, all trades between members of NDS will have to\nbe reported on the NDS which will be directly linked to the settlement system.  In\norder that the market participants prepare themselves for the NDS, it is proposed that\nwith effect from June 2, 2001, all transactions settled through the Delivery versus\nPayment (DVP) system of RBI will be on T plus 1 basis.  As this will provide\ncertainty to market participants in respect of demand for settlement funds for\nsecurities transactions on the day of settlement, it is expected to improve cash and\nliquidity management among money market participants.  This will also have a\nstabilising influence on call money market.  \nInterest Rate Policy\n(a) Review of Norms Relating\nto Prime Lending Rate\n80.As a step towards deregulation of interest rates and providing more\noperational flexibility to banks, Prime Lending Rate (PLR) was introduced in April\n1997.  Since then, the norms relating to the operation of PLR by banks has been\nsubstantially rationalised and liberalised.  Banks were given freedom to declare their\nown PLRs along with a maximum spread.  Later, the Prime Term Lending Rate\n(PTLR) was introduced and subsequently banks were provided with the freedom to30offer tenor-linked PLRs.  Banks also have now the flexibility to offer lending rates on\na fixed rate or on a floating rate basis.\n81.At present, PLR serves as the ceiling rate for credit limits of up to Rs.2 lakh\nand as a floor for loans or credit limits above Rs.2 lakh.  The rationale for this policy\nis that PLR being the rate chargeable to the best borrower of the bank, transparency\nand objectivity requires that it should be the minimum rate chargeable to a borrower.\nHowever, based on requests from the banking system, banks were given the\nflexibility to charge interest rates without reference to the PLR in respect of certain\ncategories of loans/credit like discounting of bills, lending to intermediary agencies,\netc., in the Mid-term Review of October 1999.\n82.In recent meetings with bankers, a request was made that the PLR should be\nconverted into a reference or benchmark rate for banks rather than treating it as the\nminimum rate chargeable to the borrowers. In this context, a review of the\ninternational practices also shows that while the PLR was traditionally the lowest rate\ncharged to the prime borrowers with highest credit rating, in recent years, the practice\nof providing loans even below the PLR by banks has become common.\n83.Keeping in view the international practice and to provide further operational\nflexibility to commercial banks in deciding their lending rates, it has been decided to\nrelax the requirement of PLR being the floor rate for loans above Rs.2 lakh.  Banks\nwill be able to offer loans at below-PLR rates to exporters or other creditworthy\nborrowers including public enterprises on the lines of a transparent and objective\npolicy approved by their Boards. Banks will continue to declare the maximum spread\nof interest rates over PLR. However, given the prevailing credit market in India and\nthe need to continue with concessionality for small borrowers, the practice of treating\nPLR as the ceiling for loans up to Rs.2 lakh will continue.\n(b) Deposit Schemes for Senior Citizens\n84.As per present regulations, banks are prohibited to discriminate in the matter\nof rates of interest paid on deposits except in respect of single term deposits exceeding\nRs.15 lakh.  Based on the requests received from several senior citizens and their\norganisations, it has been decided to permit banks to formulate fixed deposit schemes\nspecifically meant for senior citizens offering higher and fixed rates of interest as31compared to normal deposits of any size.  These schemes should also incorporate\nsimplified procedures for automatic transfer of deposits to nominees of such\ndepositors in the event of death.\n(c) Term Deposits \u2013 Flexibility to Banks\n85.Banks have been given the freedom to offer fixed/floating rates on term\ndeposits and allow pre-mature withdrawal of such deposits.  On the basis of\nsuggestions received from banks, in order to facilitate better ALM, the following\nchanges in the existing provisions are proposed:\n\u2022 As per the extant guidelines on domestic/NRE deposits, it is mandatory for\nbanks to allow premature withdrawals, if requested by the depositors.\nHowever, banks are free to prescribe penal rate of interest for allowing\npremature withdrawal except in the case of reinvestment in term deposits with\nthe same bank. However, premature withdrawal of large sums may impact the\nALM function of the banks. It is, therefore, proposed that banks will be given\nfreedom to exercise their discretion to disallow premature withdrawal of large\ndeposits held by entities other than individuals and Hindu Undivided Families.\nBanks would, however, have to inform such depositors of their policy of\ndisallowing premature withdrawals in advance, i.e., at the time of accepting\nsuch deposits.  In regard to existing deposits, present provision will continue\nuntil the time of renewal of individual deposits.\n\u2022 At present, banks are free to renew overdue domestic term deposits at an\ninterest rate applicable on the date of maturity. In order to facilitate better\nALM, it is proposed that renewal of overdue deposits at the rate of interest\nprevailing on the date of maturity be allowed only for an overdue period of 14\ndays. In case the overdue period exceeds 14 days, the deposits should be\ntreated like term deposits and banks may prescribe their own interest rate for\nthe overdue period. Banks, however, have to inform the depositors in advance\nof their policy for renewal of overdue deposits.\n(d) Interest Rate on FCNR(B) Deposits\n86.At present, banks are free to accept FCNR(B) deposits for a maturity period of\n1-3 years and to offer fixed or floating rates, the latter with a interest reset period of\nsix months, subject to the ceiling of LIBOR/SWAP rates plus 50 basis points for the\ncorresponding maturity.  Based on the feedback received from the banks, it has been\ndecided to revise the above ceiling downward to LIBOR/SWAP rates for the\ncorresponding maturity.32Development of Government Securities Market\n87.     Following the announcement made in the Union Budget for 2001-02, the\nReserve Bank has already taken the following measures:\n\u2022 A Clearing Corporation with State Bank of India as chief promoter with five\nother banks and financial institutions is expected to commence its operations\nby June 2001.  The Corporation is expected to facilitate clearing and\nsettlement of money, government securities and forex transactions.  Annexure-\n2 provides more details on the proposals relating to the Clearing Corporation.\n\u2022 It was mentioned in the Mid-term Review of October 2000 that in order to\npromote retail access to government securities, an order driven screen-based\ntrading in government securities on the stock exchanges would be introduced\nin consultation with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).  The\nprogress in implementation is being continuously reviewed.\n\u2022 It has been decided to introduce an electronic Negotiated Dealing System\n(NDS) by June 2001 with a view to facilitating transparent electronic bidding\nin auctions and secondary market transactions in government securities on a\nreal-time basis.  Annexure-3 provides more details about the proposed NDS.\n\u2022 The Public Debt Act is proposed to be replaced by the Government Securities\nAct.  The enactment will provide flexibility in undertaking transactions in\ngovernment securities and facilitate retailing.\n88.  In order to strengthen the institutional mechanism in government securities\nmarket, taking into account market risk faced by PDs, capital adequacy guidelines\nwere issued to them in December 2000 based on the accepted international standards.\nThe following measures are being announced for further development of government\nsecurities market:\n\u2022 In order to encourage retail participation in the primary market for government\nsecurities, it is proposed to allocate up to a maximum of 5.0 per cent of the\nnotified amount in each auction of dated securities for allotment to retail\ninvestors on a non-competitive basis at the weighted average cut-off yield. The\nscheme will be operated only through the PDs and SDs.  Individuals, and\nprovident funds will be allowed to participate and entitled for allotment under\nthis scheme and such allotment will be outside the notified amount.  This\nscheme will be on an experimental basis after which it will be reviewed and\nmodified, if necessary.\n\u2022 Presently, the uniform price auction format is used for the issuance of 91 day\nTreasury Bills.  It is proposed to extend the format to the auctions of dated\nsecurities, on a selective and experimental basis, in order to assess the benefits\nof such format.  The notification for the respective auctions will specify the\nformat to be used, viz., uniform price or multiple price.33\u2022 The scheme of Satellite Dealers (SDs) was established in December 1996 to\ndevelop supporting infrastructure as a second tier to the PDs in government\nsecurities.  The facilities extended to SDs include entitlement for current and\nSGL accounts with RBI and access to liquidity support through repos to the\nextent of 50.0 per cent of the outstanding stock at the end of the previous day.\nOn a review of the scheme, it has been decided that while the current\neligibility criteria for accreditation as a SD would continue, the existing\nliquidity support available from RBI will be discontinued.  The SDs will be\nable to fund themselves in the repo market as with the setting up of the\nClearing Corporation, transactions in the repo market by SDs will be\nfacilitated.\n89.  It may be mentioned that the proposed NDS and the Cleari ng Corporation will\nresult in more transparent and efficient trading in the money, government securities\nand forex markets.  Simultaneously, it will ensure efficient and secure settlement by\nhaving electronic links among the trading system, clearing corporation and the Public\nDebt Office (PDO) and payment system.\nProgress towards Separation\nof Debt Management\n90.      A Working Group on Separation of Debt Management from Monetary\nManagement set up in the RBI in November 1997 submitted its Report in December\n1997.  The Working Group recommended, inter alia , separation of debt management\nfrom monetary management and establishment of an independent company under\nCompanies Act, 1956 to take over the debt management function.  In that context,\nwhile no view was taken on the details of implementation, a decision to separate the\ntwo functions was considered desirable in principle.  It was, however felt that\nseparation of the two functions would be dependent on the fulfilment of three pre-\nconditions, viz., development of financial markets, reasonable control over fiscal\ndeficit and necessary legislative changes.\n91.Subsequent developments demonstrate substantial progress on all the fronts:\n\u2022 First, significant progress has been made in the development and integration of\nfinancial markets with the introduction of new instruments and participants,\nstrengthening of the institutional infrastructure and greater clarity in the\nregulatory structure.  Notably, the recent amendment to the Securities\nContracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 demarcated the regulatory roles of the RBI\nand SEBI over the financial markets.34\u2022 Second, in the Budget Speech of 2000-01, the Finance Minister expressed the\nneed to accord greater operational flexibility to the RBI for conduct of\nmonetary policy and regulation of the financial system.  Accordingly, RBI has\nproposed amendments to various Acts, which is under active consideration.\n\u2022 Third, RBI has already proposed amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act\nto take away the mandatory nature of management of public debt by the RBI\nand vesting the discretion with the Central Government to undertake the\nmanagement of the public debt either by itself or to assign it to some other\nindependent body, if it so desires.\n\u2022 Fourth, the proposed Fiscal Responsibility Bill when passed is expected to\nbring in reasonable control over the fiscal deficit.  Apart from elimination of\nrevenue deficit by March 31, 2006 and bringing down the fiscal deficit to 2.0\nper cent of GDP in the same period, the proposed Bill envisages prohibition of\ndirect borrowings by the Central Government from RBI after three years\nexcept by way of advances to meet temporary cash needs.\n\u2022 Fifth, with the setting up of the Clearing Corporation and the operation of the\nfull-fledged LAF and the other technological infrastructure being put in place,\nRBI will be able to operate its instruments of monetary policy with greater\nflexibility and the proposed separation of debt management will greatly\nfacilitate the independence of RBI in performing its monetary management\nfunction.\n92.In the above context, once legislative actions with regard to Fiscal\nResponsibility Bill and amendments with regard to the Reserve Bank of India Act are\naccomplished, it is proposed to take up with the Government the feasibility of and\nfurther steps for separation of government debt management function from RBI.\nPrudential Measures\n(a) Adoption of 90 days Norm for\nRecognition of Loan Impairment\n93.At present, a loan is classified as non-performing when the interest and/ or\ninstalment of principal remain overdue for a period of more than 180 days as against\nthe international best practice of 90 days payment delinquency. With a view to\nmoving towards international best practices and to ensure greater transparency, it has\nbeen decided to adopt the 90 days norm from the year ending March 31, 2004.\n94.The banks are, therefore, required to chalk out an appropriate transition path\nfor smoothly moving over to the 90 days norm.  As a facilitating measure, banks35should move over to charging of interest at monthly rests by April 1, 2002. Banks\nwould have to substantially upgrade their existing Management Information System\n(MIS) for collecting data on loans, where the interest and/or instalment of principal\nremain overdue for a period of more than 90 days in order to crystalise NPAs on a 90\ndays norm.  Banks should commence making additional provisions for such loans,\nstarting from the year ending March 31, 2002, which would strengthen their balance\nsheets and ensure smooth transition to the 90 days norm by March 31, 2004. Banks\nare, therefore, advised to work out necessary modalities and submit their action plans\nafter approval by their Boards to RBI. The implementation of the plans will be\nmonitored by RBI on a half-yearly basis.\n95.RBI is constantly reviewing the regulatory requirements in respect of\nprudential provisions and it is proposed to gradually enhance provisioning\nrequirements in future. Considering that higher loan loss provisioning adds to the\noverall financial strength of the banks and the stability of the financial sector, banks\nare urged to voluntarily set apart provisions much above the minimum prudential\nlevels prescribed by RBI as a desirable practice.\n(b) Prudential Norms for Financial Institutions\n96.As per the extant guidelines, financial institutions (FIs) are required to treat a\ncredit facility as non-performing if interest is overdue for more than 180 days and/or\nthe principal is overdue for more than 365 days. Over the years, a number of steps\nhave been taken by Government of India to improve the legal framework governing\nrecovery of dues of banks and FIs. The Reserve Bank has already circulated to banks\nand FIs the ground-rules on certain areas requiring co-ordination, particularly in\nrespect of large value projects jointly financed by banks and FIs, with a view to\navoiding delays and facilitating better solution to the common problems for\nimplementation. Since the banking system is moving towards 90 days norm for\nrecognition of loan impairment, it has been decided to bring in convergence in the\nnorms for asset classification between FIs and banks over a reasonable period.\nAccordingly, to start with, the asset of a financial institution would be treated as non-\nperforming if interest and/or principal remain overdue for 180 days instead of the\npresent 365 days, with effect from the year ending March 31, 2002.36(c) Norms for Statutory Central Auditors\nin respect of Private Sector Banks\n97.Of late, it was observed by RBI that there was no uniformity amongst private\nsector banks in regard to the appointment of their Statutory Central Auditors (SCAs).\nMany banks were appointing audit firms of a smaller size and proprietary concerns\nwith comparatively less experience.  Considering the fast changes that are taking\nplace in the financial sector in general and in the field of banking in particular as also\nthe use of latest technology by some of the new private sector banks in their day-to-\nday operations, RBI had examined the issue of prescribing minimum eligibility\nstandards for the audit firms before approving their names as statutory auditors for\nIndian private sector banks. Accordingly, with effect from the year 2001-02, the audit\nfirms recommended by Indian private sector banks for appointment as their SCAs will\nhave to satisfy the prescribed standards in this regard such as minimum standing,\nminimum number of full time partners associated with the firm for a period of at least\n3 years, minimum number of chartered accountants exclusively associated with the\nfirm, number of professional audit staff as well as minimum statutory central audit\nexperience for the auditors.  With a view to applying the prescribed minimum\nstandards, Indian private sector banks have been classified into two categories on the\nbasis of their asset size as at end-March of the previous year, i.e., banks with an asset\nsize up to Rs.5,000 crore and those with above Rs.5,000 crore.\n(d) Revised Guidelines for Recovery of NPAs\n98.As announced in the Union Budget for 1999-2000, guidelines for constitution\nof Settlement Advisory Committees (SACs) for compromise settlement of chronic\nNon-Performing Assets (NPAs) of small sector were framed.  While banks were\nrequired to take effective measures to strengthen the credit appraisal and post credit\nmonitoring to arrest the incidence of fresh NPAs, a more realistic approach was\nneeded to reduce the stock of existing and chronic NPAs in all categories. The\nguidelines were, therefore, modified in July 2000 which provided a simplified, non-\ndiscretionary and non-discriminatory mechanism for recovery of NPAs. The\nguidelines are in RBI website www.rbi.org.in . The Government and RBI have\nreceived a number of representations from industry/trade associations, individual\nborrowers as also from banks that the period of the guidelines should be extended.37Accordingly, t he revised guidelines, operative till March 31, 2001 were extended up\nto June 30, 2001; for processing these applications/cases, banks have been given time\nup to September 30, 2001. All public sector banks are required to uniformly follow\nthese guidelines, so that they maximise recovery of NPAs within the stipulated time.\n(e)  Credit Exposure to Individual/Group Borrowers\n99.It was announced in the Mid-term Revie w of October 2000 that a review of\ncurrent practices regarding credit exposure limits vis-\u00e0-vis international practices\nshows that there are certain issues which require further consideration.  The first\nrelates to the concept of `capital funds\u2019; second relates to the scope of the\nmeasurement of credit exposure, in particular, the coverage of non-fund and other off-\nbalance sheet exposures; and the third relates to the level of exposure limit itself.\nTaking into account the complexities involved, a discussion paper on the subject was\nprepared and circulated among a few public sector, private sector and foreign banks.\nBased on the comments and suggestions received from the banks on the issues,\nfollowing measures are announced:\n \n\u2022 Internationally, exposure ceilings are computed in relation to total capital as\ndefined under capital adequacy standards (Tier I and Tier II Capital).  Taking\ninto account the best international practices, it has been decided to adopt the\nconcept of capital funds as defined under capital adequacy standards for\ndetermining exposure ceiling uniformly both by domestic and foreign banks,\neffective from March 31, 2002.\n \n\u2022 In line with international best practices, it has been decided that non-fund\nbased exposures should be reckoned at 100 per cent and in addition, banks\nshould include forward contracts in foreign exchange and other derivative\nproducts like currency swaps and options, at their replacement cost value in\ndetermining individual/group borrower exposure ceiling, effective from April\n1, 2003.\n \n\u2022 As the concept of capital funds has been broadened to represent total capital\n(Tier I and Tier II), it has been decided to adjust the exposure ceiling for single\nborrower from the existing 20.0 per cent to 15.0 per cent effective from March\n31, 2002. Similarly, the group exposure limits will be adjusted effective from\nMarch 31, 2002 to 40.0 per cent of capital funds. In case of financing for\ninfrastructure projects, the limit is extendable by another 10.0 per cent, i.e., up\nto 50.0 per cent.\n(f) Debt Recovery Tribunals38100.It has been announced in the Union Budget for 2001-02 that the Government\nhas decided to set up 7 more Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) during 2001-02 in\naddition to the existing 22 DRTs and 5 Appellate Tribunals to facilitate banks to\nquickly recover their dues from borrowers.  Besides, the Government has proposed to\nbring in legislation for facilitating foreclosure and enforcement of securities in case of\ndefault so as to enable banks and financial institutions to realise their dues.\n(g) Defaulters\u2019 List \u2013 Widening the Coverage\n101.The RBI annual publication of the list of defaulters to banks and financial\ninstitutions of Rs.1 crore and above, introduced in 1995, is confined to suit filed cases\ndue to the secrecy provisions enshrined in the banking laws. The coverage of the\nscheme was widened by bi-annual circulation of the names of defaulters of Rs.1 crore\nand above in the doubtful or loss category as well. A scheme for collection and\ndissemination of information on willful defaulters with outstanding balance of Rs.25\nlakh and above, on quarterly basis, was also introduced in February 1999.  Pending\nappropriate amendments in banking laws, RBI has also advised banks to incorporate a\ncondition in the loan agreement for obtaining consent of the borrowers to disclose\ntheir names in the event of their becoming defaulters. Banks, which have not yet put\nin place the system of obtaining consent of the borrowers, are advised to complete the\nprocess by September 30, 2001.\n(h) Revised Guidelines on Exposure\nof Banks to Stock Market\n102.As announced in the Mid-term Review of October 2000, the RBI-SEBI\nTechnical Committee has reviewed the RBI guidelines on banks\u2019 investments in\nshares as also advances against shares and other connected exposures.  In making its\nrecommendations, the Committee has taken into account the recent experiences of the\nbanks and the exposures taken by them by way of advances against shares and\nfinancial guarantees.  The report of the RBI-SEBI Technical Committee, which was\nsubmitted to RBI on April 12, 2001 was released on the same day by RBI for\ncomments/suggestions by experts/market participants and others.  The report is\navailable on RBI website.39103.The Technical Committee has found that the overall exposur e of banks in\ncapital markets (both in terms of funded and non-funded credit facilities) continues to\nbe modest at 1.76 per cent of total advances of banks in February 2001.  Banking\nsystem as a whole and public sector banks, accounting for the overwhelming\nproportion of deposits and advances in the economy, have currently an exposure of\n1.76 per cent and 0.49 per cent of total advances, respectively, compared to 1.88 per\ncent and 0.53 per cent, respectively, in March 2000, showing overall, a negligible\nimpact of the guidelines issued last year. However, some relatively small banks (in\nterms of their share in total advances) do not seem to have observed appropriate risk\nmanagement guidelines, particularly in respect of advances against shares and non-\nfunded guarantees to a few stock broking entities (including their associated and inter-\nconnected companies).  This concentration of exposure on a few entities by these few\nbanks was unjustified on prudential grounds and substantially increased the risks\nattached to such advances/guarantees, besides raising serious ethical concerns.\n104.The Technical Committee\u2019s recommendations are expected to minimise the\npossibility of such unwarranted and unethical \u201cnexus\u201d emerging between some inter-\nconnected stock broking entities and promoters/managers of some private sector or\nco-operative banks. At the same time, the Technical Committee\u2019s recommendations\nprovide head-room for growth of banks\u2019 financial support to capital market with\nappropriate disbursal of funds by multiplicity of banks among the customers.\n105.In the light of the recommendations of the Technical Committee, RBI\nproposes to revise the guidelines issued earlier in November 2000 on banks\u2019\ninvestments in shares as also advances against shares and other connected exposures.\nIt is proposed to issue the final guidelines in this regard in early May 2001 after taking\ninto account further comments/suggestions received by RBI.\n106.It is also proposed to review the actual working of the revised guidelines aga in\nafter six months. Financing of assets backed by equity is a relatively new activity for\nmost banks. It was anticipated by RBI, when the present guidelines were issued in\nNovember 2000, after intensive and open consultations with all concerned, that some\nrevisions in these guidelines might be required in the light of actual experience.\nBanks were also requested to keep a close watch on their operations and monitor data\nrelating to this sector.  All banks, large and small, are once again advised to carefully40monitor their operations in this sensitive sector in order to minimize risk and\nmaximize transparency.\n(i) Reliance on Call Money Market\n107.With the progressive deregulation, it is essential that banks adopt asset-\nliability management technique for scientific management of balance sheets.\nAccordingly, RBI issued comprehensive guidelines on Asset-Liability Management\nSystem in February 1999, advising banks to put in place a scientific system with\neffect from April 1, 1999.  As a prudent measure, banks were, inter alia , advised that\nmismatches in cash flows during the first two time-buckets, viz., 1-14 days and 15-28\ndays should not, in any case, exceed 20 per cent of the cash outflows.  Further, to\ncontain short-term funding, banks were advised to set caps on inter-bank borrowings,\nespecially call borrowings.\n108.Narasimham Committee II has also recommended that there must be clearly\ndefined prudent limits beyond which banks should not be allowed to rely on the call\nmoney market and that access to the call market should essentially be for meeting\nunforeseen swings and not as a regular means of financing banks\u2019 lending operations.\nRecognising, however, that the money and fixed income securities markets were not\nwell-developed and that banks had been advised to comply with the prudential limits\non mismatches, it was decided to move away from placing product-specific limit.\nHowever, a review undertaken by RBI had revealed that a few banks were overly\nexposed to the call money market.  These banks were specifically advised to chart\ndefinite plans to reduce maturity mismatches and avoid excessive reliance on call\nmoney market.  A recent assessment has indicated that some of the banks have taken\nconcrete steps in building core deposit base, arranging committed lines of credit, etc.,\nin order to reduce their dependence on call money borrowings.  If, however, any bank\ncontinues to rely excessively on call money market for carrying out their banking\noperations, after discussion with such bank, RBI will lay down specific ceilings to\nreduce its long-term dependence on call money.\n(j) Commercial Paper\n(i) Preference for Dematerialised holding41109.As part of the new guidelines for issue of CP released in October 2000, banks,\nFIs, PDs and SDs were advised to invest and hold CP only in dematerialised form, as\nsoon as arrangements for such dematerialisation are put in place. As the existing\narrangements for dematerialised holding of CP are now considered adequate and\nsatisfactory, it has been decided that with effect from June 30, 2001, banks, FIs, PDs\nand SDs will be permitted to make fresh investments and hold CP only in\ndematerialised form. Outstanding investments in scrip form should also be converted\ninto dematerialised form by October 31, 2001.\n110.As a coro llary, it is also considered expedient to extend the demat form of\nholding to other investments like bonds, debentures and equities.  Accordingly, with\neffect from October 31, 2001 banks, FIs, PDs and SDs will be permitted to make fresh\ninvestments and hold bonds and debentures, privately placed or otherwise, only in\ndematerialised form.  Outstanding investments in scrip form, should also be converted\ninto dematerialised form by June 30, 2002. As regards equity instruments, they will be\npermitted to be held by the above mentioned institutions only in dematerialised form,\nfrom a date to be notified in consultation with SEBI.\n(ii) Documentation and Procedure\n111.As part of the new guidelines on issue of CP released in October 2000,\nFIMMDA was entrusted with the task of prescribing standard procedures and\ndocumentations that are to be followed by the participants, in consonance with the\ninternational best practices. In this regard, FIMMDA has been in dialogue with RBI\nand in the process of devising such standard procedures and documentation. Before\nfinalisation, FIMMDA would circulate a draft of these guidelines among its members\nand other market participants.\n(k) New Basel Capital Accord\n112.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has recently released the\nsecond set of consultative documents on a new Capital Accord. The new Accord\nprovides a range of options of increasing sophistication for providing explicit capital\nfor credit, market and operational risks. It is envisioned that the new Accord will be\nimplemented in member jurisdictions in 2004. In RBI, an internal Working Group is\ncurrently examining the implications of the new Accord.42113.While the 1988 Accord could be easily adopted on account of its simplicity\nand flexibility, the more sophisticated provisions incorporated in the new Accord pose\nsignificant implementation challenges for banks and supervisors. The feedback\nreceived from a few banks indicates that they would have to substantially upgrade\ntheir existing MIS, risk management practices and procedures and technical skills of\nstaff. Banks should, therefore, initiate necessary steps to ensure that they are geared to\nadopt the new Accord, as and when approved.  In this context, banks are advised to\nassess their preparedness to adopt the new Accord, and formulate a plan for\nimplementation.\n(l)  Consolidated Accounting and Supervision\n114.The Board for Financial Supervision has evolved an approach for consolidated\nsupervision as appropriate in the Indian context based on which, a set of   measures\nwas announced last year.  A multi-disciplinary Working Group has been set up to\nlook into the introduction of consolidated accounting and quantitative techniques for\nconsolidated supervision, in line with international best practice. The Group is\nexpected to submit its report before July 2001.\n(m) Move towards Risk-based Supervision\n115.As indicated in April 2000 Policy Statement, there is a growing acceptance\nthat risk based supervision (RBS) approach would be more efficient than the\ntraditional transaction based approach. Accordingly, following the recommendations\nof an international consultant, appointed to advise on a proper structuring of the RBS\napproach, a dedicated Group has been set up within RBI for project implementation\nand to drive the change management implication.  To meet the requirements of RBS,\nbanks would have to take immediate measures to improve the reliability and\nrobustness of their risk management, management information, and supervisory\nreporting systems.\n(n) Credit Information Bureau\n116.A mention was made in the April 2000 Policy Statement regarding State Bank\nof India entering into a Memorandum of Understanding with HDFC Ltd. and other43foreign technology partners to set up a Credit Information Bureau (CIB) which would\nprovide an institutional mechanism for sharing of credit information among banks and\nFIs. CIB has since been set up with a paid up capital of Rs.25 crore. The Bureau will\ncollect, process and share credit information on the borrowers of credit institutions.\nAs per the existing legislative framework, success of CIB would largely depend on\nthe banks\u2019 efforts to obtain consent of borrowers for disclosure and make available\nthe information to the Bureau. While CIB can be functional within the existing\nframework, to strengthen the legal mechanism for making the functioning of CIB\neffective, a draft master legislation covering responsibilities of the Bureau, rights and\nobligations of the member credit institutions, safeguarding of the privacy rights, has\nbeen forwarded to Government of India.\n(o) Prompt Corrective Action\n117.As indicated in the Mid-term Review of October 2000, a framework for\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA) was prepared with various trigger points for prompt\nresponses by the supervisors. The draft scheme was posted on the RBI website, and\nsent to select banks. Based on the suggestions received, the scheme has been\nmodified. The scheme will be finalised in consultation with banks and the\nGovernment.\n(p) Macro-Prudential Indicators\n118.The Mid-term Review of October 2000 indicated that a half-yearly financial\nstability review using Macro-Prudential Indicators (MPIs) would be prepared for\ninternal circulation.  In this regard, an inter-departmental Group was constituted and a\npilot review of MPIs for the half-year ended March 2000 was finalised and a review\nfor September 2000 has since been prepared. While the initial reviews are likely to be\nlargely compilations of MPIs, over time, these reviews are expected to act as the\nfoundation of an early warning system by highlighting potential vulnerabilities in the\nfinancial system. They would also show linkages between the macroeconomic\nindicators and the balance sheets of individual institutions with the eventual objective\nof building appropriate models in the Indian context.  These periodical reviews would\nalso identify issues for further examination or internal research and suggest44improvements in the data collection/ compilation process through constant analysis of\nemerging literature in this area.\nUrban Co-operative Banks\n (i) Prudential Measures\n119.It has to be recognised that the present prudential norms and the regulatory\nsystem prescribed for Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) are relatively soft in\ncomparison with those for commercial banks. This is partly on account of historical\nreasons, and partly due to their size being generally small and the preferential\ntreatment of co-operative structure in general.  At present, three authorities are\ninvolved in regulatory and promotional aspects concerning the UCBs \u2013 the Central\nGovernment (in case of banks having multi-state presence), State Governments and\nRBI. At times, this results in overlapping jurisdiction and difficulties in carrying out\nadministrative/prudential measures with the required speed and stringency. The recent\nexperience has also shown that irresponsible and unethical behaviour on the part of\neven a few co-operative banks in the country can have some contagion effect beyond\nthe particular area or the state concerned and may cause severe harm to depositors,\nincluding smaller co-operative banks, and impair the confidence in the system. It is\nnecessary to ensure that immediate interim measures are taken to ward off such\ncontingencies with serious adverse consequences without continuing to wait for legal\nand institutional reform. The following measures are proposed:\n\u2022 Even at present, co-operative banks are not permitted to invest directly in\nstock markets or lend to stock brokers. They can, however, lend to individuals\nagainst pledge of shares up to Rs.10 lakh per borrower, if the shares are in the\nphysical form, and up to Rs.20 lakh if they are in demat form. Available\ninformation shows that a few UCBs have ignored the present guidelines and\nestablished a nexus with certain stock brokers in order to operate in the stock\nmarket. In order to prevent any possible misuse in the future, it is necessary to\nstop lending by UCBs directly or indirectly to individuals or corporates\nagainst security of stocks. With immediate effect, UCBs are being advised not\nto entertain any fresh proposals for lending directly or indirectly against\nsecurity of shares either to individuals or any other entity. They are also\nadvised to unwind existing lending to stock-brokers or direct investment in\nshares, which were not permissible, at the earliest. Advances to individuals\nagainst security of stocks that have already been disbursed, up to permissible\namounts, may however, continue till the contracted date.  The managements of\nco-operative banks should immediately communicate above measures to the45concerned members and the steps being taken by the bank to implement the\nnew guidelines.\n\u2022 In order to reduce the excessive reliance of some UCBs in the call money\nmarket, it is being provided that their borrowings in the call/notice money\nmarket on a daily basis should not exceed 2.0 per cent of their aggregate\ndeposits as at end March of the previous financial year. The existing freedom\nto lend in the call/notice money market will continue.\n\u2022 As parking of funds by UCBs with other UCBs may pose a systemic risk, as a\nsafety precaution, UCBs are advised not to increase their term deposits with\nother UCBs. While UCBs will not be permitted to increase their term deposit\nbalances with other UCBs, the outstanding deposits with other UCBs as on\nApril 19, 2000, could be unwound before end of June 2002.  UCBs may\nmaintain current account balances at their discretion with other UCBs to meet\ntheir day-to-day clearing and remittance requirements.\n\u2022 UCBs are allowed to maintain their SLR (25.0 per cent of NDTL) in the form\nof investments in government and other approved securities or as deposits\nwith District Central Co-operative Banks/State Co-operative Banks. As per\nextant guidelines, the scheduled UCBs are required to maintain at least 15.0\nper cent of NDTL in government and other approved securities; non-scheduled\nUCBs with deposits of Rs.25 crore and above are required to maintain at least\n10.0 per cent of their NDTL in government and other approved securities; and\nin respect of non-scheduled UCBs with deposits of less than Rs.25 crore there\nis no stipulation regarding maintenance of SLR in the form of government and\nother approved securities. It is now proposed to increase the proportion of\nSLR holding in the form of government and other approved securities as\npercentage of NDTL in the following manner, which should be achieved by\nend-March 2002:\nCategory of UCBs SLR holding in Government and other\napproved\nsecurities as per cent of NDTL\nPresent Proposed\nNon-Scheduled UCBs\ni)UCBs with deposits of\nRs.25 crore and above10.0 per cent 15.0 per cent\nii) UCBs with deposits of\nless than Rs.25 croreNil 10.0 per cent\nScheduled UCBs 15.0 per cent 20.0 per cent\n\u2022 With effect from April 1, 2003, the scheduled UCBs will need to maintain\ntheir entire SLR assets of 25.0 per cent of NDTL only in government and\nother approved securities.  Further, compliance with CRR requirements on par\nwith scheduled commercial banks would be prescribed in due course.46\u2022 All the scheduled UCBs and non-scheduled UCBs with deposits of Rs.25\ncrore and above would henceforth be required to maintain investments in\ngovernment securities only in SGL Accounts with RBI or in constituent SGL\nAccounts of public sector banks and PDs. Non-scheduled UCBs with deposits\nof less than Rs.25 crore will have the facility of maintaining government\nsecurities in physical or scrip form.\n\u2022 UCBs should, in their operations, take note of the fact that commercial banks\nmay establish appropriate inter-bank monetary limits for discounting of pay-\norders issued by scheduled co-operative banks, taking into account the size of\ntheir deposits/net worth, etc.\n120.It may be noted that, in order to minimize any immediate financial impact on\nUCBs, all the measures are either \u201cprospective\u201d in nature or sufficient time has been\nallowed for UCBs to implement them in the interest of their members.  The above\nmeasures should provide greater security for depositors and members of UCBs and\ncontribute to the development of the UCB sector on sound lines.\n(ii) A New Supervisory Structure for UCBs?\n121.As mentioned earlier, three authorities (Central and State Governments and\nRBI) are presently involved in regulating, supervising and/or administering UCBs.\nThere are as many as 2,084 UCBs of which 51 are scheduled UCBs and the rest are\nunscheduled. In view of the large number as well as their dispersed and local\ncharacter, their supervision and inspection pose special problems. At present, while\naccounts of UCBs are required to be audited by state governments, there has been\nsubstantial delay in completing audit of a large number of UCBs. RBI conducts\nstatutory inspections normally once in two years in respect of scheduled UCBs, once\nin two to three years in respect of non-scheduled UCBs, while the identified weak\nbanks are inspected on annual basis.\n122.Concerned about the potential consequences of the present multiplicity of\nauthorities involved in supervising and regulating the UCBs and other problems that\nhad been observed, RBI had set up a high level committee in May 1999 under the\nChairmanship of Shri K.Madhava Rao. The Committee also had representatives of the\nco-operative banking sector and RBI as well as other experts as members.  The\nCommittee submitted its Report in November 1999 and this report was also sent to47Central and State Governments for consideration. The Committee made wide-ranging\nrecommendations for improving the functioning of the co-operative banks. These\nrecommendations, inter alia , included proposals to substantially improve the entry-\npoint norms, induction of professional management, abolition of dual supervisory\ncontrol, and stiffer prudential and other parameters. Most of the recommendations of\nthe Committee have been accepted by RBI, but recommendations requiring legislative\naction at the level of State Governments have yet to be implemented. RBI is following\nup with State Governments to implement the recommendations of the Committee as\nearly as possible.\n123.In the light of the recent experience, one of the  options that deserves to be\nseriously considered is the setting up of a new apex supervisory body which can take\nover the entire inspection/supervisory functions in relation to scheduled and non-\nscheduled UCBs. This apex body could be under the control of a separate high-level\nsupervisory board consisting of representatives of the Central Government, State\nGovernments, RBI as well as experts and it may be given the responsibility of\ninspection/and supervision of UCBs and ensuring their conformity with prudential,\ncapital adequacy and risk-management norms laid down by RBI.\n124.RBI proposes to consult the Central Government on the above suggestion, and\nif found acceptable in principle, the proposal could be pursued further in consultation\nwith State Governments and others concerned. RBI will be prepared to provide\nmanpower and other assistance to the new apex supervisory body as necessary.\nOwnership Functions of Reserve Bank of India\n125.The Reserve Bank holds at present shares in State Bank of India (SBI),\nNational Housing Bank (NHB), Infrastructure Development Finance Company\n(IDFC), Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), National\nBank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Bharatiya Reserve Bank\nNote Mudran Ltd. (BRBNML), Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI) and\nSecurities Trading Corporation of India (STCI).\n126.It may be recalled that Narasimham Committee II was of the view that\nappropriately, RBI should not own the institutions it regulates.  In the Discussion48Paper prepared by RBI on Harmonising the Role and Operations of Development\nFinancial Institutions and Banks (January 1999), it was suggested that in order to\nenable RBI to concentrate its regulatory and supervisory functions, the ownership of\nfinancing institutions could ideally be delinked from RBI through transfer of such\nownership to the Government.  It was stated indeed that RBI should desist from\ncontinuing with its ownership functions in both commercial banking and refinance or\ndevelopment finance segments.\n127.RBI has accepted the recommendation for transfer of ownership of its shares\nin SBI, NHB and NABARD to the Central Government, and is in touch with the\nGovernment in this regard.  The matter has to be examined further by the Government\nand RBI in detail, and a view taken by the Government since policy decisions and\nlegislative actions are involved.\n128.RBI also plans to initiate the process in respect of IDFC at an appropriate time\nin future. In respect of BRBNML, there is no intention to d ivest RBI\u2019s\nshareholding at this stage since RBI is a captive customer and there are no regulatory\nimplications. In respect of DICGC, RBI had already submitted proposals to the\nGovernment for framing a new Act to make it consistent with financial sector\nliberalization.\n129.RBI has, consistent with the above approach, already divested most of its\nshareholding in DFHI and STCI.  Currently, RBI holds only 10.50 per cent of the\nshares in DFHI and 14.40 per cent of the shares in STCI.  It has been decided to\ncompletely divest these shareholdings in the current year.\nCredit Delivery Mechanism\nRelief Measures for Gujarat\n130.In view of the devastating effect of earthquake in the state of Gujarat in\nJanuary 2001 resulting in wide-spread damage to the properties and heavy loss of life,\nRBI announced a package of relief measures for the State.  These measures cover:\n\u2022 The loan classification status in case of borrowers affected by the earthquake\nis frozen on an \u2018as-is-where-is\u2019 basis up to March 31, 2003 at concessional\ninterest rate of 10.0 per cent without application of penalty provisions.49\u2022 Notwithstanding the present loan classification status, the affected small\ntraders, small business, self-employed and small road transporters, etc., would\nbe sanctioned fresh loans up to Rs.1 lakh for the purpose of\nrestoration/rehabilitation of their business at interest rates not exceeding PLR.\n\u2022 Banks are advised to grant loans up to Rs.2 lakh at interest rate not exceeding\nPLR for repairs/reconstruction of houses/shops damaged by the earthquake.\n\u2022 Provision of additional limits/rescheduling of existing limits for affected small\nscale industries (SSI), business, trade and industry under a need based\napproach at PLR up to Rs.10 lakh and at banks\u2019 discretion beyond Rs.10 lakh.\n\u2022 Loans for repair/construction of houses and shops and to small traders, small\nbusiness, self-employed and small road transport operators, etc., will be\nreckoned as priority sector lending.\n\u2022 Waiving of processing fee for the affected beneficiaries.\n\u2022 In respect of agricultural loans, banks are not to recover principal or interest\nfrom the affected farmers for a period of two years with a provision for\nreschedulement up to 7 years.\n\u2022 For purposes of interest rate on loans to affected borrowers, PLR of the SBI\nwill be uniformly applied by all banks.\n\u2022 On the request from National Housing Bank (NHB), RBI has sanctioned a\nlong-term loan of Rs.1,000 crore at 6.0 per cent rate of interest per annum\nrepayable over 18 years to enable NHB to provide refinance assistance to\nhousing finance companies, banks, etc., providing loans for reconstruction of\nhouses, etc., to the affected people.\n\u2022 Relief/concessions for affected exporters include extending the period of\npacking credit, conversion of dues into short-term loans repayable in suitable\ninstalments and relaxation in NPA classification norms.\nNon-Banking Financial Companies\n131.In recent years, the Reserve Bank has taken a number of initiatives and steps\nto speed up the reform process in the functioning of Non-Banking Financial\nCompanies (NBFCs). In terms of the extant Regulations (Section 45-IA of the\namended RBI Act, 1934), NBFCs are not permitted to commence/carry on financial\nbusiness as defined in the Act without a Certificate of Registration (CoR) from RBI.\nThe Bank has received applications for CoR from 36,870 NBFCs, of which 12,690\napplications were approved and 17,736 were rejected as at end-February 2001. Out of\nthe total approvals of 12,690 applications, only 734 have been permitted to accept50public deposits. It may be mentioned that, of these, only 25 NBFCs have public\ndeposits of over Rs.50 crore.  It may be reiterated that NBFCs not registered with\nRBI, and those institutions which are not permitted to accept public deposits, should\nnot raise public deposits.   Further, NBFCs are advised to repay public deposits as per\nthe terms of their acceptance and continue to adhere to the provisions of RBI Act and\nother directives issued from time to time.\n132.With a view to further strengthening the regulato ry/supervisory framework on\nNBFCs, the following measures are proposed:\n(a)  Separate Act for Non-Banking\nFinancial Companies\n133.In order to facilitate NBFCs to effectively perform their role in the economic\ndevelopment of the country, the Government has proposed a separate legislation to\nprovide for enhanced protection to the depositors of NBFCs. The Bill is under\nconsideration of the Government.\n(b) Draft Guidelines for Asset Liability\nManagement for Non-Banking\nFinancial Companies\n134.The Reserve Bank has concluded its consultations with NBFCs and other\nconcerned institutions on the draft guidelines for asset-liability management for\nNBFCs.  The final guidelines would be issued shortly.\nTechnology Upgradation\n135.Improvement in payment system h as been one of the priority areas of financial\nsector reform.  In this direction, the following further steps are being taken:\n(a) Payments System Vision Document\n136.The Mid-term Review of October 2000 mentioned about the preparation of a\n\"Payments System Vision Document\" focussing on the implementation of the\nsystemically important payment system applications having impact on large value\ninter-bank funds transfers. The draft Vision Document was prepared and widely\ncirculated. RBI has received feedback from banks and comments from the members\nof apex bodies such as the National Payments Council. The Reserve Bank is51examining these comments/feedback and the final version of the Vision Document\nwould be published shortly. The Vision Document would provide a road map of\nimportant developments in the payment system project.  This would facilitate banks in\ngetting themselves fully prepared to participate effectively in the new products aimed\nat better payment and settlement services.\n(b) \u2018Imaging\u2019 as Pre-cursor\nfor Cheque Truncation\n137.As part of the Mid-term Review of October 2000, stages of development\nrelating to introduction of imaging to serve as pre-cursor for cheque truncation were\nmentioned.  A Working Group constituted by the Ministry of Finance, Government of\nIndia is examining the legal requirements for cheque truncation under the Negotiable\nInstruments Act.\n(c) Internet Banking\n138.As indicated in the Mid-term Review of October 2000, the Working Group on\nInternet Banking has since submitted its report which has been accepted for\nimplementation.  As a part of this process, a staggered approach, based on the levels\nof technology usage in different banks is being prepared covering the conduct of\ninternet based transactions in a highly secured environment with appropriate risk\ncontrol measures and risk management techniques.\n(d) Indian Financial Network\n139.In addition to the extensive use of Indian Financial Network (INFINET) for\ninformation flow and funds movements, further steps have been taken in improving\nthe infrastructure for facilitating efficient funds management. Accordingly, it has been\ndecided to set up a structured financial messaging backbone system for which SWIFT\nlike message formats have been finalised and circulated to the banks to encompass\nvarious types of intra and inter-bank applications including those of government\ntransactions and debt-related transactions.\n140.The other technology related infrastructure such as the Securities Settlement\nSystem, the Negotiated Dealing System, the Centralised Funds Management System\nand the Real Time Gross Settlement System are all slated for completion shortly.52Banks, therefore, need to take suitable measures by ensuring intra-city connectivity\nand networking of branches and setting up of gateways at major cities.  The 21 centres\nwhere RBI has a presence have been identified for network connectivity by the\nNational Payments Council.  However, intra-city and intra-bank networking within\nthese 21 centres will have to be done by individual banks.\nLegal Reforms\n141.The major legal reforms initiated in the banking sector in the recent months\nencompass areas such as security laws, Negotiable Instruments Act, fraud on banks\nand regulatory framework of banking. RBI has forwarded its recommendations to\nGovernment of India for comprehensive amendments to the Reserve Bank of India\nAct, 1934 and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, which are under consideration by\nthe Government.  Government of India has constituted a Working Group for\nsuggesting changes in the provisions of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, to bring it\nin conformity with the Information Technology Act, 2000 and also to examine the\nincorporation of electronic cheque, securitised certificate and other evolving products\nwithin the ambit of Negotiable Instruments Act.  Further, with the increasing level\nand complexity of frauds and the difficulties being faced by banks in recovering the\nfinancial loss by recourse to legal process, RBI has constituted a Committee on legal\naspects of bank frauds to define financial frauds, lay down procedural laws, examine\nthe process of investigation of bank frauds and prosecution of persons involved.\n142.Government of India constituted an Expert Committee under the chairmanship\nof Shri T.R.Andhyarujina for the purpose of formulating specific proposals to give\neffect to the suggestions made by Narasimham     Committee II relating to changes\nneeded in the legal framework.  The Committee submitted its report in February 2000.\nAs a follow-up,  Government of India constituted a Working Group (Chairman:\nShri S.H.Bhojani, with Shri M.R.Umarji, as a member from RBI) on asset\nsecuritisation in July 2000 to examine the Expert Committee\u2019s recommendations for\nimplementation.  This Working Group has drafted a Bill on asset securitisation for\nenactment and submitted to the Government.\n143.Another Working Group was constituted by the Government in July 2000\n(Chairman: Shri M.R.Umarji), to examine the vesting of powers with banks and FIs53for taking possession and sale of securities without intervention of the courts and to\ndraft a Bill for consideration of the Government.  The report of the Group is expected\nto be submitted shortly.\nInternational Financial Standards and Codes\n144.In the Mid-term Review of October 2000, it was mentioned that some of the\nAdvisory Groups on International Standards and Codes had submitted their reports in\npart/full to the Standing Committee, constituted by RBI in consultation with the\nGovernment.  Advisory Groups, which consist of non-official experts, have since\nmade significant progress in firming up their views in various subject areas.  As of\nnow, the reports/part of reports in respect of the following subjects have already been\nreceived by the Standing Committee:  (i) Transparency of Monetary and Financial\nPolicies (Final), (ii) Payment and Settlement System, (iii) Insurance Regulation, (iv)\nBanking Supervision (Part I), (v) Accounting and Auditing, (vi) Bankruptcy Laws\n(Interim) and (vii) Corporate Governance.  The remaining reports on three subjects,\nviz., Data Dissemination, Fiscal Transparency and Securities Market Regulation are\nexpected by May 2001. All the reports of the Advisory Groups have been put on the\nRBI website www.rbi.org.in  for debate and discussion.  These reports are also being\nprinted for wider dissemination. The Standing Committee also plans to help the\nGroups in organising Seminars/Workshops to enhance awareness and concretise\nviews on the recommendations and seek comments/feedback from both private and\npublic sector organisations, international institutions and experts. The work of the\nStanding Committee and non-official advisory groups in this important area has been\ncommended internationally.\nRegulations Review Authority\n145.The Regulations Review Authority (RRA), which was constituted on April 1,\n1999 for reviewing the Reserve Bank\u2019s rules, regulations and reporting system based\non the suggestions received from general public at large, market participants and other\nusers of services of RBI, has ceased its operations from March 31, 2001 on expiry of\nits term.  During two years of its operations, RRA received a number of suggestions,\nmany of which were implemented.  This helped in removal of redundancies in the\nreporting system, simplification of rules and internal procedures in various functional54areas within RBI and also brought about some improvement in operational efficiency\nin commercial banks which enabled better customer service. An important outcome of\nRRA\u2019s initiative was the arrangement for preparation of master circulars in many\nregulatory areas, incorporating RBI\u2019s instructions/ guidelines at one place.\n146.Though the RRA has ceased its operations, in view of the favourable respons e\nto the Scheme, RBI has decided to make the review exercise an integral part of its\ninternal system and accordingly, has put in place an alternate mechanism under the\ncharge of an Executive Director for dealing with such applications from April 1,\n2001.  This will help RBI to further simplify procedures, reduce paper work and\nimprove customer service, on an on-going basis.\nMid-term Review\n147.A review of credit and monetary developments in the first half of the current\nyear will be undertaken in October 2001.  The Mid-term Review will be confined to a\nreview of monetary developments and to such changes as may be necessary in\nmonetary policy and projections for the second half of the year.\nMumbai\nApril 19, 2001\nAnnexure-1\nCurrent and Revised Interest Rate\nStructure on Export Credit\nCategory Existing Revised*\n(With effect from\nMay 5, 2001)\nPre-shipment Credit\n(i) Up to 180 days 10.0 per cent Not exceeding PLR\nminus 1.5 percentage\npoints\n(ii) Beyond 180 days  and up to\n270 days13.0 per cent Not exceeding PLR plus\n1.5 percentage points\nPost-shipment Credit\na) On demand bills for  transit\nperiod (as  specified by FEDAI)Not exceeding\n10.0 per centNot exceeding PLR\nminus 1.5 percentage55points\nb) Usance Bills\n(i) Up to 90 days Not exceeding\n10.0 per centNot exceeding PLR\nminus 1.5 percentage\npoints\n(ii) Beyond 90 days and  up to 6\nmonths from date  of shipment12.0 per cent Not exceeding PLR plus\n1.5 percentage points\n* Note : 1.

The system of providing liquidity support has been reviewed in the light of\nthe performance of PDs under the scheme during the year 2000-01. The proposed\nrevisions were discussed with the Primary Dealers in the meeting held on 31st March\n2001 and their suggestions and comments elicited.  The revised \" Scheme for Bidding,\nUnderwriting and Liquidity Support to Primary Dealers \u2013 2001-02 \"  is enclosed and\nit supercedes the earlier scheme with immediate effect.\nYours faithfully,\n(Smt.

SCHEME FOR UNDERWRITING\nTerms And Conditions For Underwriting\n(A) Dated Securities\na) On announcement of the notified amount for dated securities of the Central\nGovernment and the State Governments for which auction is held, Primary Dealers\nwill be collectively offered to underwrite upto 100 per cent of the notified amount in\nrespect of all issues where amounts are notified .\nb) A Primary Dealers shall offer to underwrite an amount not exceeding five times of\nits net owned funds The amount so arrived at should not also exceed 30 per cent of\nthe notified amount of the issue.  An illustration has been appended in Annexure I.\nc) Bids will be tendered by Primary Dealers in a specified proforma ( Annexure II)\nindicating the amounts and fees at which they would be willing to accept\nunderwriting commitments.  A PD would be allowed to submit multiple bids for\nunderwriting.\nd) The bids will be tendered by each Primary Dealer in a sealed cover so as to reach the\nChief General Manager, Internal Debt Management Cell, RBI, Central Office,\nMumbai, before 2.30 p.m. ( upto 12.30 p.m. if it is a Saturday) on the working day\nimmediately preceding the day of auction of the loan.   A Primary Dealer who does\nnot wish to participate in the underwriting of a particular issue should submit \u2018NIL\u2019\nbid.\ne) Depending upon the bids submitted for underwriting, the Reserve Bank will decide\nthe cut-off rate of fee and the underwriting amount upto which bids would be\naccepted.  Bids would be accepted at the fee as quoted by individual PrimaryDealers upto the cut-off fee.  All bids quoted above the cut-off fee would be\nrejected.\nf) RBI reserves the right to accept any amount of underwriting upto 100 per cent of the\nnotified amount or even reject all the bids tendered by PDs for underwriting, without\nassigning any reason.\ng) Primary Dealers will invariably bid at all auctions at least to the extent of their\nunderwriting commitment as accepted by the Reserve Bank.  PDs would be allowed\nto set-off the accepted bids in the auction against their underwriting commitment\naccepted by the Bank, in case of devolvement.\nh) Devolvement of securities, if any, on Primary Dealers will take place on pro-rata\nbasis, depending upon the amount of underwriting obligation of each Primary Dealer\nafter setting off the successful bids in the auction.  An illustration has been provided\nin Annexure III.\ni) The cut-off fee and the underwriting amount accepted by Reserve Bank will be\nintimated to the Primary Dealers at the earliest after a decision is taken in the matter.\nj) Underwriting fee will be paid on the entire amount accepted for underwriting by the\nReserve Bank, irrespective of the actual amount of devolvement.\nk) Underwriting Fee will be paid by the Reserve Bank by credit to the current account\nof the respective Primary Dealers at the Reserve Bank of India, Fort, Mumbai, on\nthe date of the auction.\nl) In case of State Government floatation through auction, the same system of\nunderwriting will be followed.\n(B) Treasury Billsa) Each PD will individually commit, at the beginning of the year, to submit minimum\nbids as a fixed percentage of the notified amount of Treasury Bills in each auction.\nb) The minimum percentage of the bids for each PD will be determined by the Reserve\nBank, by negotiation with the PD so that the whole issue of Treasury Bills at 100 per\ncent is apportioned amongst all PDs collectively. The percentage of minimum bidding\ncommitment so determined by the Reserve Bank will remain unchanged for the entire\nfinancial year or till the conclusion of agreement on bidding commitments for the\nnext financial year, whichever is later.  In determining the minimum bidding\ncommitment, RBI will take into account the offer made by the PD, its net owned\nfunds and its track record.\nc) If any Primary Dealer in any auction of Treasury Bills, fails to submit the required\nminimum bid or submits a bid lower than its commitment, the Reserve Bank will\nreduce assured liquidity support to the extent of shortfall/ failure in submission of\nbids for a period of six months from the date the decision is communicated to the\nPrimary Dealer. For instance, if a bid is short by an amount of Rs. 10 crore, liquidity\nsupport will be reduced by an amount of Rs. 10 crore for six months.\n2. SCHEME FOR LIQUIDITY SUPPORT TO PRIMARY DEALERS\nIn terms of the \u201cGuidelines for Primary Dealers in the Government Securities Market\u201d,\nPDs are provided with liquidity support by the Reserve Bank Of India through\nrepos/refinance against Central Government securities. Under the existing scheme\nliquidity support is linked to bidding commitment, success in primary auctions and\nsecondary market operations. With a view to fine tune the scheme further, certain\nchanges in the scheme have been effected. The parameters based on which liquidity\nsupport will be allocated among the PDs are also given below.\na) Under the existing system, the liquidity support is provided at Bank Rate for Level \u2013I\nas determined by the Reserve Bank for each PD. With the introduction of LAF, PDshave been participating alongwith banks in the LAF. Under the Monetary and Credit\nPolicy 2001-02 announced by RBI, in order to facilitate a smooth transition to full\nfledged LAF, it is proposed to split the Level I liquidity support at Bank Rate into two\nparts \u2013 normal facility and backstop facility. The normal facility will be provided at\nBank Rate while the backstop facility will be at a variable daily rate. The daily\nvariable rate will b e linked to cut-off rates emerging in LAF auctions and in the\nabsence of such rates to National Stock Exchange, Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate\n(NSE- MIBOR) as detailed below:\ni) The variable rate for the backstop facility, to be fixed on a daily basis\nwould be 1 percentage point over the reverse repo cut-off rate at which\nfunds were injected earlier during the day in thew regular LAF auctions.\nii) Where no reverse repo bid was accepted as part of LAF auction, the rate\nwill be 2.0 to 3.0 percentage points over the repo cut off rate of the day\nwhich emerged in LAF auction as may be decided by RBI.\niii) On Saturdays and on other days when no bids for repo or reverse repo\nauctions have been received/accepted, the rate for back stop facility will\nbe between 1.0 to 3.0 percentage points over NSE- MIBOR as may be\ndecided by RBI.  The exact mark-up will depend upon the assessment of\nliquidity conditions.\nb) Of the total limits of liquidity support available to PDs, the normal facility would\ninitially constitute about two thirds and the backstop facility about one-third.\nc) Backstop facility would be operated till close of banking hours.\nd) Liquidity support against the collateral of Government securities available to PDs will\nbe based on the bidding commitment and other parameters. Approximately 75% of\nthe total assured liquidity support (Level I plus backstop) will be provided on the\nbasis of bidding commitments. The ratio for G Secs to T Bills will be 3:1.  In\nfinalising bidding commitments the RBI will take into account the NOF, the offer\nmade by the PD and its track record. The prescribed success ratio in respect of\nGovernment dated securities and Treasury Bills will continue to be 40%.e) The balance quantum of 25 % of the total assured liquidity support will be distributed\non the basis of secondary and primary market performance in the ratio 3:2.\nf) The total assured liquidity support (normal plus backstop facility) will be subject to\nmaximum of thrice the net owned funds of respective PD. For application of this\nclause, in order to bring in uniformity, the latest available paid up capital as on 31st\nMarch 2001 certified by the Statutory Auditors will be considered. Till such time the\nfigures as per the latest audited balance sheet will be relied upon.\nAnnexure I\nIllustration showing the amount a PD can offer for underwriting.\nNotified Amount of the issue : Rs.2,000 crore\nName of\nPDNOF 5 times of\nNOF30 % of\nNotified\nAmountAdmissible\namount\nA 50 250 600 250\nB 500 2500 600 600\nC 200 1000 600 600\nD 120 600 600 600\nNote: PD can underwrite a maximum of 5 times NOF in an issue, subject to this\namount being less than or equal to 30 % of the notified amount.\nAnnexure II\nTo\nThe Chief General Manager,\nInternal Debt Management Cell,\nReserve Bank of India,\nCentral Office,\nMumbai - 400 001.Madam,\nTender for Underwriting\nIn terms of the Scheme for Bidding, Underwriting and Liquidity Support to Primary\nDealers issued by RBI on April 19, 2001, we hereby submit the following bids for\nunderwriting:\nTender for Underwriting\nSecurity -------------------\nDate of Auction -------------------\nNet Owned Funds (audited figure) -------------------\nBid/s for underwriting\nSr.No. Underwriting\nAmountUnderwriting\nFees\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nTotal ---------\nWe hereby undertake that on acceptance of our bid/s, we shall take up the devolvement,\nif any, upto the underwriting amount as decided by the Reserve Bank.\nYours faithfully,\n(Signature)\nName\nDesignationAnnexure III\nIllustration showing the underwriting amount, cut-off rate of under-\nWriting fee accepted by the Reserve Bank and devolvement on PDs.\nRBI sells GOI security of 5-year tenure for an aggregate amount of Rs.2000 crore\n(nominal) through an auction.

With a view to moving further towards deregulation, providing opportunities for\nnon-banks to invest short-term surplus funds in a more flexible manner when they are phased\nout from call money market and to enable banks to have more flexibility in their Asset\nLiability Management ( ALM ), it has been decided to reduce the minimum maturity period for\ndomestic/Ordinary Non-Resident/Non-Resident Special Rupee ( NRSR ) term deposits to 7\ndays from the present 15 days, at the discretion of individual banks. But, this facility will be\navailable only in respect of single term deposits of Rs. 15 lakh and above where banks have\nthe freedom to offer differential rates of interest according to size of deposits. However, the\nstipulation of minimum maturity of 15 days for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and\nCommercial Paper ( CP) will continue.\n(ii) Deposit Scheme for Senior Citizens2\nAs per the present regulations ( cf: paragraphs 22(c) of Master Directive DBOD No. Dir. BC.\n46/13.03.00/2000-2001 dated November 4, 2000), banks are prohibited to discriminate in the\nmatter of rates of interest paid on deposits, except in respect of single term deposits\nexceeding Rs. 15 lakh. Based on the requests from several senior citizens and their\norganizations, it has been decided to permit banks to formulate, with the approval of their\nBoards of Directors, fixed deposit schemes specifically for senior citizens offering higher and\nfixed rates of interest as compared to normal deposits of any size. These schemes should also\nincorporate simplified procedures for automatic transfer of deposits to nominees of such\ndepositors in the event of death. For the sake of uniformity, IBA will be advising the banks\nabout the eligibility criteria for Senior Citizens.\n(iii) Term Deposits \u2013 Flexibility\na) As per the extant guidelines on domestic/ NRE term deposits ( cf: paragraph 9 of\nMaster Directive DBOD No. Dir BC 46/13.03.00/2000- 2001, dated November 4,\n2000), it is mandatory for banks to allow premature withdrawals, if requested by the\ndepositors. However, banks are free to prescribe penal rates of interest for allowing\npremature withdrawal except in the case of reinvestment in term deposits with the\nsame bank. Premature withdrawal of large sums may impact the ALM function of the\nbanks. It has, therefore, been decided to give freedom to banks to exercise their\ndiscretion to disallow premature withdrawal of large deposits held by entities other\nthan individuals and Hindu Undivided Families. Banks would, however, have to\nnotify such depositors of their policy of disallowing premature withdrawals in\nadvance, i.e. at the time of accepting such deposits. In regard to existing deposits,\npresent provision will continue until the time of renewal of individual deposits.\nb) At present, in terms of paragraph 1( i) of Master Directive DBOD No. Dir.BC\n46/13.03.00/2000-2001, dated November 4, 2000, banks are free to renew overdue\ndomestic term deposits at an interest rate applicable on the date of maturity. In order\nto facilitate better ALM, it has been decided that renewal of overdue term deposits at\nthe rate of interest prevailing on the date of maturity be allowed only for an overdue\nperiod of 14 days. In case, the overdue period exceeds 14 days and if the depositor\nplaces entire amount of overdue deposit or a portion thereof as a fresh term deposit,\nbanks may prescribe their own interest rate for the overdue period on the amount so\nplaced as a fresh deposit. Banks, however, have to inform the depositors in advance of\ntheir policy for renewal of overdue deposits.3\n(iv) Interest rates on FCNR (B) Deposits\nAt present, banks are free to accept FCNR (B) deposits for a maturity period of 1-3 years and\nto offer fixed or floating rates, the latter with an interest reset period of six months, subject to\nthe ceiling of LIBOR/SWAP rates plus 50 basis points for the corresponding maturity. It has\nnow been decided to revise the above ceiling downward to LIBOR/SWAP rates for the\ncorresponding maturity.\n(The above guidelines will not be applicable to RRBs/ LABs).\n(v) Review of Norms Relating to Prime Lending Rate\nAt present, loans upto Rs. 2 lakh carry the prescription of not exceeding the Prime Lending\nRate ( PLR) and on the loans above Rs. 2 lakh, banks are free to determine rate of interest\nsubject to PLR and spread guidelines. Keeping in view the international practice and to\nprovide further operational flexibility to commercial banks in deciding their lending rates, it\nhas been decided to relax the requirement of PLR being the floor rate for loans above Rs. 2\nlakh. Banks may now offer loans at below PLR rates to exporters or other creditworthy\nborrowers including public enterprises on the lines of a transparent and objective policy\napproved by the respective Boards.\nBanks will continue to declare the maximum spread of interest rates over PLR. However,\ngiven the prevailing credit market in India and the need to continue with concessionality for\nsmall borrowers, the practice of treating PLR as the ceiling for loans upto Rs. 2 lakh will\ncontinue.\n(The above guidelines will not be applicable to RRBs/ LABs).\n(Amending Directives DBOD No. Dir BC 104,105,106/13.03.00/2000-2001 dated April\n19, 2001 are enclosed).\n(vi) Preference for Dematerialised Holding\nIn terms of the circular DBOD  No. Dir. BC. 115/13.07.05/98-99 dated December 9, 1998,\nbanks were advised to settle the transactions in securities as notified by Securities and\nExchange Board of India ( SEBI) only through depositories. Banks were also advised that\nafter the commencement of mandatory trading in demat form, they would not be able to sell\nthe shares of listed companies if they were held in physical form.4\nIn order to extend the demat form of holding to other instruments like    bonds, debentures\nand equities, it has now been decided that with effect from October 31, 2001, banks, FIs, PDs\nand SDs will be permitted to make fresh investments and hold bonds and debentures,\nprivately placed or otherwise, only in dematerialized form. Outstanding investments in scrip\nforms should also be converted into dematerialized form by June 30, 2002. As regards equity\ninstruments, they will be permitted to be held by the above mentioned institutions only in\ndematerialized form, from a date to be notified in consultation with SEBI.\nYours faithfully,\n(M.

The matter has since been examined and we\nadvise as under.\n2. In terms of our circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.129/21.04.043-92 dated April 27, 1992, read\nwith DBOD.No.BP.BC.35/21.01.002/99  dated April 24, 1999, banks were advised, inter alia,\nthat a standard asset where the terms of the loan agreement regarding interest and principal have\nbeen renegotiated or rescheduled after commencement of production should be classified as sub-\nstandard and should remain in such category for at least one year of satisfactory performance\nunder the renegotiated or rescheduled terms. In the case of sub-standard and doubtful assets also,\nrescheduling does not entitle a bank to upgrade the quality of advance automatically unless there\nis satisfactory performance under the rescheduled/renegotiated terms. Further, in terms of\ncircular DBOD.No.BP.BC.45/21.04.048/99  dated May 10, 1999, in cases where commercial\nproduction had commenced but not stabilized, it was left to the Board of Directors of banks to\ndecide whether there is a need for rescheduling of the loan and treat the loan as standard asset\nsubject to certain conditions stipulated therein. It has, however, been represented to us that the\nforegoing stipulations deter the banks from restructuring of standard and  sub-standard loan\nassets even though the modification of terms might not jeopardise the assurance of repayment of\ndues from the borrower. The present norms have, therefore, been reviewed in the light of the\ninternational best practices and the BIS guidelines in the matter and it has been decided to\neffect certain changes in the norms relating to restructuring / rescheduling / renegotiation\nof terms of the standard and sub-standard loan assets , as detailed in the  following\nparagraphs.\n3. In the context of restructuring of the accounts, the following stages at which the\nrestructuring/rescheduling/ renegotiation of the terms of loan agreement could take place, can be\nidentified:\n(a) before commencement of commercial production;\n(b) after commencement of commercial production but before the asset has been classified as\nsub standard,\n(c) after commencement of commercial production and the asset has been classified as\nsubstandard.2\nIn each of the foregoing three stages, the rescheduling, etc., of principal and/or of interest could\ntake place, with or without sacrifice, as part of the restructuring package evolved.\n4. The prudential tre atment of the accounts, subjected to\nrestructuring/rescheduling/ renegotiation of terms, would be governed by the following norms:\n4.1 Treatment of restructured standard accounts\na.A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, at any of the aforesaid first\ntwo stages would not cause a standard asset to be classified in the sub standard\ncategory provided the loan/credit facility is fully secured.\nb.A rescheduling of interest element at any of the foregoing first two stages would\nnot cause an asset to be downgraded to sub standard category subject to the condition\nthat the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the element of interest, measured in present\nvalue terms, is either written off or provision is made to the extent of the sacrifice\ninvolved. For the purpose the future interest due as per the original loan agreement in\nrespect of an account should be discounted to the present value at a rate appropriate to\nthe risk category of the borrower (i.e., current PLR + the appropriate credit risk\npremium for the borrower-category) and compared with the present value of the dues\nexpected to be received under the restructuring package, discounted on the same basis.\nc.In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value\nterms, as at (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or\nprovision made to the extent of the sacrifice involved.\n4.2 Treatment of restructured sub-standard accounts\na.A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, would render a substandard\nasset eligible to be continued in the sub-standard category for the specified period,\nprovided the loan/credit facility is fully secured.\nb.A rescheduling of interest element would render a sub-standard asset eligible to\nbe continued to be classified in sub standard category for the specified period\nsubject to the condition that the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the element of interest,\nmeasured in present value terms, is either written off or provision is made to the\nextent of the sacrifice involved. For the purpose, the future interest due as per the\noriginal loan agreement in respect of an account should be discounted to the present\nvalue at a rate appropriate to the risk category of the borrower (i.e., current PLR + the\nappropriate credit risk premium for the borrower-category) and compared with the\npresent value of the dues expected to be received under the restructuring package,\ndiscounted on the same basis.\nc. In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value\nterms, as at (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or provision\nmade to the extent of the sacrifice involved. Even in cases where the sacrifice is\nbyway of write off of the past interest dues, the asset should continue to be treated as\nsub-standard.3\nThe sub-standard accounts at 4.2 (a), (b) and (c) above, which have been subjected to\nrestructuring, etc, whether in respect of principal instalment  or interest amount, by\nwhatever modality, would be eligible to be upgraded to the standard category  only\nafter the specified period, i.e., a period of one year after the date when first payment of\ninterest or of principal, whichever is earlier, falls due, subject to satisfactory\nperformance during the period. The amount of provision made earlier, net of the\namount provided for the sacrifice in the interest amount in present value terms as\naforesaid, could also be reversed after the one-year period.\nDuring this one-year period, the sub-standard asset will not deteriorate in its\nclassification if satisfactory performance of the account is demonstrated during the\nperiod. In case, however, the satisfactory performance during the one year period is not\nevidenced, the asset classification of the restructured account would be governed as per\nthe applicable prudential norms with reference to the pre-restructuring payment\nschedule.\nApplicability\n5. The foregoing norms for restructuring, etc., would be applicable to standard and sub-\nstandard assets only, in supercession of the existing RBI norms in respect of such assets in so\nfar as they relate to restructuring/rescheduling/ renegotiation of the terms of the loan\nagreement. All other prudential guidelines relating to income recognition, asset classification and\nprovisioning would remain unaltered.\n6. The foregoi ng changes in the norms would be applicable only to the standard and sub-\nstandards accounts which are subjected to restructuring / rescheduling / renegotiation of terms\nduring the current financial year and thereafter.\nDisclosure\n7. Banks should also discl ose in their published Annual Accounts, under the Notes on\nAccounts, the following information in respect of restructuring, etc., undertaken during the year :\n- total amount of loan assets subjected to restructuring, etc;\n- the amount of standard assets subjected to restructuring, etc.; and\n- the amount of sub-standard assets subjected to restructuring, etc.,\nGeneral\n8. All standard and sub-standard accounts subjected to restructuring, etc., and covered under\nparagraph 4 above, would continue to be eligible for fresh financing of funding requirements, by\nthe lenders as per their normal policy parameters and eligibility criteria.\n9.

The \u201cCore Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\u201d drawn\nup by the Basel  Committee in 1997, which were in the nature of minimum requirements intended\nto guide supervisory authorities in strengthening their current supervisory regime, also stressed\nupon the necessity of supervisors having at their disposal adequate supervisory measures, backed\nby legal sanctions, to bring about timely corrective action when banks fail to meet prudential\nrequirements (such as minimum capital adequacy ratios), when there are regulatory violations or\nthe depositors\u2019 interest is threatened in any other way.\n2. A scheme of PCA  formulated by the Bank  was discussed with select bankers.  A\ndiscussion paper on PCA, prepared taking into account the preliminary views of these bankers\nwas put on the website for wider circulation, discussion and debate.  A press release on the above\nwas also issued.  Bankers and others were requested to offer their suggestions and comments on\nthe proposed scheme of PCA.  Taking into account the feed back, comments and suggestions\nreceived from bankers and others, the scheme has been revised.  While certain actions can be\ninitiated by RBI on its own, certain other actions shall be initiated in consultation / with approval\nof Government of India. The details are furnished in the annexure attached to the revised\nscheme.  A copy of the revised scheme is enclosed.\n3. The PCA scheme is proposed to be introduced as a supervisory tool in addition to the\nexisting measures. As will be revealed from the scheme, a schedule of corrective actions has\nbeen worked out based on three parameters, i.e. CRAR, Net NPAs  and Return on Assets ( RoA)\nwhich represent the three important parameters, viz. capital adequacy, asset quality and\nprofitability. Certain trigger points have been determined for the PCA framework under the three\nparameters taking into account the practicability of implementation of certain measures in the\nIndian context.  Triggers based on CRAR, Net NPAs and ROA are linked to a bank\u2019s\nperformance in three critical areas which are quantifiable and which form an integral part of the\nsupervisory oversight.\n4. For every t rigger point, a set of mandatory and discretionary actions has been laid down.\nThe actions are designed to pre-empt any deterioration in the soundness of banks. The rationale\nfor classifying the PCAs into mandatory and discretionary is that some of the actions are\nessential to restore the financial health of banks while other actions will be taken at the discretion\nof RBI depending upon the profile of each bank. In cases where banks do not show\nimprovement, despite taking mandatory actions, some of the discretionary actions will getconverted into mandatory actions.   However, in exceptional cases, RBI will have the right to\nwaive mandatory provisions. The total PCA framework for a bank will be determined by\naggregating the PCAs under the various parameters.\n5. As mentioned in paragraph 8 of the enclosed scheme, published balance sheet, off-site\nreturns and on-site inspection report will be the primary sources for identifying the banks which\ncould be placed under the PCA framework.\n6. In order to enable us t o take a final view on the matter, you are requested to offer your\ncomments on the proposed scheme of Prompt Corrective Action. Your comments may reach us\nwithin a period of one month from the date of this letter.\nYours faithfully,\n(A.L. Narasimhan)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nEncl: 10 Sheets\nAnnexure\nPrompt Corrective Action\n1. Introduction\n1.1 The 1980s and early 1990s were a period of great stress and turmoil for banks and financial\ninstitutions all over the globe, viz. Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Mexico, several Nordic countries,\nVenezuela and USA, etc.  In USA, more than 1600 commercial and savings banks insured by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) were either closed or given FDIC financial\nassistance during this period.  More than 900 Savings and Loan Associations were closed or\nmerged with assistance from Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ( FSLIC) during\n1983 to 1990.  The cumulative losses incurred by the failed institutions exceeded US $ 100\nbillion.  These losses resulted in the insolvency and closure of FSLIC and its replacement by the\nResolution Trust Corporation ( RTC) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund ( SAIF).\n1.2 These events led to the search for appropriate supervisory strategies to avoid bank failures as\nthey can have a destabilising effect on the economy. For this reason, medium or large banks are\nrarely closed and the governments try to keep them afloat.  In both industrial and emerging\nmarket economies, bank rescues and mergers are more common than outright closure of the\nbanks.  If banks are not to be allowed to fail, it is essential that corrective action is taken well in\ntime when the bank still has adequate cushion of capital so as to minimise  the cost to the\ninsurance fund / public exchequer in the event of a forced liquidation of the bank.  In this\ncontext, supervisory action can be at two levels:\n? early recognition of problems and corrective actions\n? supervision and monitoring of troubled banksIdentifying problem banks early is one of the responsibilities of bank supervisors.  The other\nresponsibility is to initiate corrective action in an attempt either to prevent failure or to limit\nlosses.\n1.3 These objectives are sought to be achieved by establishing various trigger points and graded\nmandatory responses by the supervisors.  This represents partial replacement of regulatory\ndiscretion by rules, as the prescribed actions are generally likely to be a mix of mandatory and\ndiscretionary actions.  The case for automatic rules is that it will contain regulatory forbearance\n(i.e. hoping that problems will solve themselves) - which has been a very common complaint\nagainst the supervisors - and will lead to quick action.  Prompt action is important as the cost of\nrestructuring / liquidation of a bank is likely to rise, the longer that action is delayed.\n1.4 The structured, predetermined capital or asset ratios that trigger actions by the regulatory\nauthorities have two purposes :  one is to reduce a bank\u2019s moral hazard behaviour. The several\ntrigger points serve as speed breakers or trip wires to slow deterioration of weak banks and\nreduce incentives and opportunities for banks to increase their risky assets. Banks are encouraged\nto perform better by enticements (i.e. lesser restrictions on moving to higher zones).  Such\nStructured Early Intervention and Resolution ( SEIR) include carrots as well as sticks.  The other\npurpose is to reduce the regulators\u2019 agency problem.  The regulators first have the opportunity of\nusing their discretion to get banks to restore depleted capital.  But if the banks do not respond\nand their capital ratios continue to fall, appropriate sanctions including resolution at least cost to\nthe Insurance Corporation become mandatory.\n1.5 Since both the discretionary and the mandatory actions and other rules are explicit and\nknown a priori to banks, they help shape the future behaviour of the banks so that the regulators\nhave stronger ex-ante  influence and are not faced as often with unexpected fait accompli .\n1.6 The Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (Principle 22) of Basel  Committee on\nBanking Supervision mandate that banking supervisors must have at their disposal adequate\nsupervisory measures, backed by legal sanctions, to bring about timely corrective action when\nbanks fail to meet prudential requirements (such as minimum capital adequacy ratios), when\nthere are regulatory violations or where their depositors are threatened in any other way.  In\nextreme circumstances, this should include the ability to revoke the banking licence or\nrecommend its revocation.  The penal actions range from restricting the current activities of the\nbank, withholding approval of new activities or acquisitions, restricting or suspending payment\nto shareholders, restricting asset transfers, restrictions on discretionary powers of managers,\ndirectors or controlling owners, arranging a take-over by or merger with healthier institutions.\n1.7 The Financial Stability Assessment Programme  (FSAP ), jointly made by International\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank team on India\u2019s compliance with the Basel  Committee\u2019s\nCore Principles highlighted that lack of explicit rules mitigating against supervisory forbearance\nis a major weakness and that the time limit set by the Reserve Bank for taking remedial measures\nis too long.\n2. Prompt Corrective Action Framework in other countries2.1  The best-known example of such a regime is in USA.  Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation Improvement Act ( FDICIA) was passed in 1991 to limit regulatory forbearance by\nrequiring ( i) a more timely closure of failing institutions and (ii) early intervention in problem\nbanks.  These are known as Prompt Corrective Action ( PCA).  The FDIC Improvement Act,\n1991, requires each appropriate federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to\nresolve the problems of insured depository institutions at the least possible long-term loss to the\ndeposit insurance fund.  PCA is a framework of supervisory actions for insured depository\ninstitutions that are not adequately capitalised.  For this purpose, banks are placed in one of the\nfive zones (i.e. Well Capitalised, Adequately Capitalised, Undercapitalised, Significantly\nUndercapitalised and Critically Undercapitalised) based on three capital ratios ( CRAR, Tier I to\nRisk Weighted Assets and Tier I to Total Assets).  Every Zone, other than the Well Capitalised\nZone, has a set of mandatory and discretionary provisions with increasing severity.  The\nprescribed actions include establishing a capital restoration plan, restrictions on deposit taking,\ninterest payable on deposits, new activities, acquisitions, officers\u2019 pay, asset growth, payment of\ndividends, and management fees, etc.  Banks, which are critically undercapitalised for a\nprescribed period, face closure.\n2.2 In the US, the FDIC is required to compute and document the costs of resolving a troubled\ninstitution in alternative ways and justify its option used as the least cost one.   However, an\nexemption from least cost resolution is provided for banks that regulators judge as too-big-to-fail\nand where not protecting their uninsured depositors or creditors from loss would have serious\nadverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability.  The Act prescribes a stringent\nmethodology for exercise of such discretion. It requires a determination of threat of systemic risk\nby the Secretary of Treasury upon the written recommendation of two thirds of FDIC Board of\nDirectors and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and after consultation with\nthe President.\n2.3  USA was not the only country to experience serious banking problems in recent years.  A\nstudy by the IMF reported that over 130 of the 181 member countries reported banking crises\nsince 1980 . Banks\u2019 regulatory system, as a consequence, came under intense scrutiny, and\nfundamental questions were raised about its effectiveness in anticipating and limiting the number\nof bank failures and losses to the deposit insurance fund.  Consequently, a system of PCA regime\noperates in many other countries too, designed to address the problems developing in banking\nsystem in a prompt manner. Rules based on compulsory quantitative triggers (in relation to\ncapital levels) for action by supervisors patterned on the rules set in the FDIC Improvement Act,\n1991 have been devised in some industrial economies and in a number of emerging market\neconomies (e.g. Korea, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Hong Kong).  Some of the\ncountries have rule-based system to initiate actions against banks which, apart from non\ncompliance of CRAR , are unable to meet the obligations, carrying out business detrimental to the\ninterests of depositors or creditors, which suffer from illiquidity , insolvency, large losses, serious\nviolation of laws and regulations, imminent loss, etc. (e.g. Singapore, Brazil, Mexico, Peru,\nHungary, Poland and Saudi Arabia).\n2.4 The financial crisis that began in Asia has once again brought the importance of the PCA to\nthe fore.  The crisis clearly demonstrated the importance of robust and efficient domestic\nfinancial systems.  Weak banking systems and poorly developed capital markets contributed tomis-allocation of resources that led to the crisis.  Key to the strengthening of domestic financial\nsystem is the implementation of sound practices for regulation, supervision, settlement, and\naccounting and disclosure standards. The implementation of sound practices depends on\nincentives to do so.  These can be in the form of market-based incentives, either alone or in\ncombination with official or regulatory incentives.  These have been emphasised in the Report of\nthe Working Group on Strengthening Financial Systems  (of BIS / IMF / OECD / World Bank) .\nThe Working Group recommends adopting, implementing and enforcing a method of structured\nearly intervention in the banking sector  which includes a well considered set of mechanisms to\nensure a consistent, timely and graduated response by supervisors.\n3. Existing Framework for Supervisory Action\n3.1 Under the powers conferred under RBI Act, 1934 and Banking Regulation Act, 1949,\nReserve Bank has been taking bank-specific supervisory corrective actions where the financial\nposition warrants such measures.  These included directing banks to submit quarterly\nMonitorable Action Plans and progress reports on various targets set by the Reserve Bank, such\nas augmentation of capital, improvement in profitability, reduction of NPAs, reconciliation of\nentries in inter-branch, inter-bank and nostro accounts, review / renewal of borrowal accounts,\netc.  In extreme cases, Reserve Bank had also put caps on credit-deposit ratio, restrictions on\npayment of dividend, call money borrowings and raising of high cost deposits including\nCertificate of Deposit, ban on recruitment, opening of branches, etc.  Where the financial\nposition so warrants, Reserve Bank effects changes in the management of banks by removal of\nthe Chief Executive Officer or Directors of the Board.  In addition, RBI appoints additional\nDirectors / Observers to oversee the functioning of the bank so as to prevent the affairs of the\nbank being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of present or future depositors.  RBI\nalso exercises powers in extreme cases to place banks under moratorium or initiate winding up\nproceedings.\n3.2 Though there are explicit provisions  (Sections 35A, 36AA, 36AB, 37, 46 to 48 of Banking\nRegulations Act, 1949) empowering Reserve Bank to initiate appropriate corrective actions\nagainst banks which are showing signs of distress, these are not properly structured and no time\nlimit is set for response to such actions in the case of definite weaknesses in banks.  It is,\ntherefore, necessary that we should evolve rule-based corrective actions, which are transparent\nfor addressing early warning signals.\n4. Prompt Corrective Action ( PCA)\n4.1  In the light of the discussions above, there is a need to put in place a rule-based PCA regime\nin India too, as a part of our commitment to adopt the international best practices and comply\nfully with the Core Principles.\n4.2  The PCA or the rule-based framework prevalent in USA and other countries focuses on the\nneed to prevent insolvency of banks by taking corrective actions well in time.  It is, however,\nconsidered desirable to build a broader PCA  regime in India so as to delineate rule-based actions\nnot only for shortfall in capital but also for other indicators of deficiency so that a seamless\nparadigm for corrective actions can be put in place for major deficiencies in banks\u2019 functioning.5. Framework for PCA\n5.1  Thus a schedule of corrective actions has been worked out based on three parameters, i.e.\nCRAR, Net NPAs and Return on Assets ( RoA), which represent capital adequacy, asset quality\nand profitability.  For every trigger point a set of mandatory and discretionary PCAs has been\nlaid down. The PCAs are designed to pre-empt any deterioration in the soundness of banks. Any\nactions, without duly recognising the diverse profile and factors contributing to the problems in\nbanks, however, may not achieve the desired effect. The PCA, therefore, encompasses certain\nactions, which should bring immediate improvements, while some action points would be\ninitiated in alignment with the severity of the problem. Thus, a set of Mandatory and\nDiscretionary action points, in conformity with the magnitude of problems, is proposed to be in\nplace to bring about improvement in the functioning of banks. The rationale for classifying the\nrule based action points into Mandatory and Discretionary is that some of the actions are\nessential to restore the financial health of banks while other actions will be taken at the discretion\nof RBI depending upon the profile of each bank.  In cases where banks do not show\nimprovement, despite taking mandatory actions, some of the discretionary actions will get\nconverted into mandatory actions.    In exceptional cases, RBI will have the right to waive\nmandatory provisions.\n5.2  The total PCA framework for a bank will have to be determined by aggregating the PCAs\nunder the various parameters.\n5.3   While there are mandatory provisions proposed for the merger of banks under certain\nconditions, discretion would still be with RBI in enforcing merger where such a step can cause\nsystemic problems.  However, a rigorous methodology for such discretionary treatment will be\nput in place.\n5.4  The Basel Committee proposes the existing regulatory capital requirement as the minimum\nand that banks should hold capital in excess of the minimum on the basis of risk profile, track\nrecord in risk management, experience and quality of personnel, nature of the market, etc.  In the\nUK, Financial Services Authority ( FSA) prescribes different minimum capital ratios (Triggers)\nfor different banks.  The \u2018Trigger\u2019 ratio is considered sacrosanct.  Banks must meet their trigger\nratios at all times and a breach of this is considered a serious violation which has the effect of\nputting the banks\u2019 customers at unacceptable risk.  In order to avoid such a situation, FSA\nexpects the banks to maintain capital at a level higher than the trigger ratio, which is the \u2018Target\u2019\nratio.  The target ratio is normally \u00bd% to 1% above the trigger ratio and acts as a regulatory\nbuffer.  The banks are expected to inform FSA if the capital falls below either the target or\ntrigger ratio at any time.  The expectation is that the capital will normally be above the target\nratio, and if it falls to the target level, then corrective action can be initiated in time to prevent\nbreach of the trigger.  Thus in UK, the target ratio acts as a proxy for the regulatory minimum\ncapital requirement.\n5.5 However, in India, banks are at present required to maintain 9% CRAR as the regulatory\nminimum capital.  Bank-specific capital adequacy requirements have not yet been prescribed.\nUnder the circumstances, trigger points for initiating prompt corrective actions have beenproposed when banks\u2019 CRAR falls below the regulatory minimum. While a marginal slip-back in\nthe prescribed CRAR could be the first trigger point of supervisory action, further erosion, in the\nbands of 3% each in CRAR, could be the trigger points for subsequent stages.  The trigger points\nbased on capital adequacy requirements will be suitably modified when RBI adopts the proposal\nof bank-specific varying CRAR, as articulated in the second pillar of the New Capital Adequacy\nFramework.\n5.6 The trigger points for NPAs and ROA may have to be set afresh every third year depending\nupon the performance parameters of the banks.\n6. Trigger Points\n6.1 CRAR :  Three trigger points have been set:\n(i) CRAR less than 9%, but equal or more than 6%\n(ii) CRAR less than 6%, but equal or more than 3%\n(iii) CRAR less than 3%\n6.2 NPAs\n6.2.1 As per the data in the Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India (1999-2000), more\nthan 80% of the public sector banks, 75% of old private sector banks and more than 73% of\nforeign banks and all the new private sector banks had net NPAs  of less than 10%.  Thus, the\n10% level could be the trigger level for PCA.    This is an appropriate level considering the fact\nthat 9% of NPA is the ceiling for granting autonomy to Public Sector Banks.\n6.2.2  Two trigger points have been set as under:\n(i) Net NPAs over 10% but less than 15%\n(ii) Net NPAs 15% and above\n6.3 ROA\n6.3.1  Internationally 1% ROA is considered as a benchmark.  However, the results of banks for\nthe last three years show very variations in ROA among all the bank groups as may be seen from\nthe data given below: -\n1997-98 1998-99 1999-2000\nPublic Sector banks\n    Of which, nationalized banks0.77\n0.620.42\n0.370.57\n0.44\nOld Private Sector banks 0.81 0.48 0.84\nNew Private Sector banks 1.55 1.03 0.97\nForeign banks 0.97 0.69 1.176.3.2 In view of such sharp variations in ROA, it is difficult to set a trigger ROA at a level close\nto the desired level i.e. 1%.  Also, keeping in view the Indian reality, a trigger point of ROA\nbelow 0.25% has been proposed.\n7. Mandatory and Discretionary Actions\n7.1 Actions based on CRAR\n7.1.1  Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio is one of the significant indicators of the financial\nsoundness of banks. CRAR normally comes down either due to unrestricted growth in assets,\nespecially risk-weighted assets without concomitant increase in capital or inadequate internal\ngeneration because of low earnings or high expenditure or poor asset quality resulting in heavy\nprovisioning requirement. Such banks will have little cushion to absorb any shocks, triggered by\ncredit / market risk or other external developments. Therefore, the mandatory and discretionary\nactions proposed are aimed at augmenting capital, restricting asset growth, especially risk-\nweighted assets, enhancing the internal generation through cost containment, and moderating\nrisks in operations.  In more severe cases of capital shortfall, change in management or\nownership may also have to be resorted to.  Finally, in extreme cases, banks may have to be\nmerged if the capital adequacy does not improve from the threshold level of 3% within a\nreasonable time or if the management / promoters do not show any inclination to restore capital\nto the desired level.  The underlying idea is that a bank which is hovering at a very critical level\ndoes not show any improvement despite reasonable opportunities ought to be closed down while\nit has some capital so as to minimise the cost to the insurance fund / public exchequer.\n7.1.2  The mandatory and discretionary actions for the three zones are given below.  These have\nbeen designed to increase in severity as the capital shortage becomes more critical.\nCRAR less than 9%, but equal or more than 6%\n7.1.3  The situation implies that the bank fails to comply with the minimum regulatory CRAR of\n9%, which exhibits its inability to absorb future shocks.  The poor capital base is exacerbated by\nlow earnings, heavy provisioning requirements due to high level of NPAs, high intermediation\ncosts, asset-liability mismatches and bank\u2019s strong appetite for risky assets.  It also exhibits\nbank\u2019s inability to access the capital market. In such cases, the bank is not in a position to\ngainfully expand its asset base for improving profitability.  The bank\u2019s flexibility to operate in\ninter bank and overseas markets would be severely restricted, forcing the bank to adopt narrow\nbanking.\n7.1.4 Mandatory Actions\n? Submission and implementation of capital restoration plan\n? Restriction on expansion of risk-weighted assets\n? Restriction on entry into new lines of business\n? Paying off costly deposits and CDs\n? Reduction / suspension of dividend payments7.1.5 Discretionary Actions\n? Ordering of recapitalisation\n? Reduction in stake in subsidiaries\n? Shedding of risky business\n? Restrictions on borrowings from inter bank market\n? Revision of credit / investment strategy and controls\nCRAR less than 6%, but equal or more than 3%\n7.1.6  It showed further deterioration in capital base due to combination of factors, such as\ncontinuous losses, heavy provisioning requirements due to precarious asset quality, failure to\nadjust risk-weighted assets due to illiquidity, promoters\u2019 inability to bring in additional capital,\netc. indicating higher possibility of bank failure.\n7.1.7 Mandatory Actions\n? Same as for category (7.1.4) above\n? Discussion with the bank\u2019s Board on corrective plan of action\n? Ordering of recapitalisation\n? Reduction in stake in subsidiaries\n? Revision of credit / investment strategy and controls\n? Reduction in advances / capital expenditure / overheads\n7.1.8 Discretionary Actions\n? Bringing in new Management / Board\n? Appointment of consultants for business / organisational restructuring\n? Change of promoters / change in ownership\n? Merger if the bank fails to submit / implement recapitalisation plan or fails to recapitalise\npursuant to order, within such period as RBI may stipulate.\nCRAR less than 3%\n7.1.9  This indicates all-round deterioration in capital adequacy, which may have arisen out of\nvery poor asset quality and earnings of the bank. It also shows the inability of the existing\nmanagement to infuse fresh capital, which point to the fact that induction of new management\nwith adequate resources is the only solution to restore the position. Given the asset quality\nproblem and poor earnings, the possibility of a quick turnaround is ruled out. Immediate\ninjection of capital is only alternative to avert the failure.\n7.1.10 Mandatory Actions\n? Same as for category (7.1.7) above\n? Appointment of observers to monitor the functioning of the bank? Merger or amalgamation / liquidation / moratorium if the bank\u2019s CRAR does not improve\nbeyond 3% within one year or within such extended period as granted by RBI\n7.1.11 Since the financial position of a bank with CRAR less than 3% will be a matter of serious\nconcern for the supervisor, there is no scope for taking discretionary actions against the bank and\nin such cases mandatory actions alone will be more appropriate.\n7.2 Actions based on Net NPAs\n7.2.1  Poor asset quality is due to deficiencies in credit administration, i.e. sub-standard credit\nappraisal, follow-up and recovery of loan assets and weaknesses in credit risk management.\nLack of adequate income inhibits the banks from making provisions as per regulatory\nrequirements.  As such, to reduce the net NPAs, the steps needed are: a clear cut loan as well as\nrecovery policy, drive for recovery of NPAs, upgradation of skills, revamping of credit\nadministration and risk management systems and entertaining only high quality proposals. A\nsound loan review mechanism needs to be in place to protect the quality of loan portfolio.\nExpanding avenues to generate fee-based income and measures for containment of costs would\nalso be desirable to ensure that banks make adequate provisions.\n7.2.2  The set of mandatory and discretionary actions for the two zones are as under:\nNet NPAs over 10% but less than 15%\n7.2.3   Net NPAs in excess of 10% clearly demonstrates the poor asset quality of banks, which\nwill have serious implications not only for current earnings but also its future income.  Such\nbanks\u2019 charge on Net Interest Income for loan loss provisioning / write off will be substantial.\nFurther, the situation may also lead to serious provisioning implications in future due to\nmigration of such NPAs into higher categories. The huge stock of NPAs forces the banks place\ntheir entire credit administration machinery in dealing with problem loans with little time for\nfollow-up of other assets. This may also prevent the bank from undertaking profitable loan\nbusiness. In a few cases, banks may be tempted to take on risky loans for generating more\nincome, leading to adverse selection. High NPAs will also restrict the banks\u2019 flexibility in\nassuming interest rate and exchange rate risks, even under favourable environment.  The\ncoverage ratio of such banks will be at a very unsustainable level.\n7.2.4 Mandatory Actions\n? Special drive to reduce the stock of NPAs and contain generation of fresh NPAs\n? Review of loan policy\n? Upgrading credit appraisal skills and systems\n? Strengthening of follow-up of advances including loan review mechanism for large loans\n? Effective follow-up of suit filed / decreed debts\n? Putting in place proper credit-risk management polices / process / procedures / prudential\nlimits\n? Reduction of loan concentration - individual, group, sector, industry, etc.7.2.5 Discretionary Actions\n? Restriction on entry into new lines of business.\n? Reduction / suspension of dividend payments\n? Reduction in stake in subsidiaries\nNet NPAs 15% and above\n7.2.6 It shows structural weaknesses in loan policy / administration and inability of banks to\nadequately provide for loan impairment.  Also, such banks have little or no scope or inclination\nto provide for more than the regulatory provisioning requirements.  It could be possible that the\nsub-standard assets constitute a significant portion of the NPAs.  In such an event, the bank may\nhave to face the situation of making higher provisioning requirements in future due to migration\nof sub-standard advances to lower categories. Such banks will have limited flexibility in\nabsorbing future shocks and undertaking profitable business. The earning potential is severely\nrestricted, with limited scope for internal generation of capital. In pursuit for higher income, such\nbanks could be assuming low quality assets, which may lead to adverse selection.\n7.2.7  Mandatory Actions\n? Same as for category (7.2.4) above\n? Discussion with bank\u2019s Board on corrective plan of action\n? Restriction on entry into new lines of business\n? Reduction / suspension of dividend payments\n? Reduction in stake in subsidiaries\n7.2.8  In case of banks having net NPAs of 15% and above, mandatory action alone will be\napplicable.\n7.3  Action based on Return on Assets ( ROA)\n7.3.1  Return on Assets is one of the important indictors of the overall efficiency of banks. ROA\ncomes down due to various factors such as high non performing assets, low fee- based income,\nhigh intermediation costs due to overstaffing, etc. Proposed actions aim at improving the income\nand containing expenses, reduction of high cost deposits, possible reduction in high level of\nprovisioning / write off and tapping of avenues to increase fee based income.\nROA less than 0.25%\n7.3.2  ROA at less than 0.25% indicates abysmal productivity of assets. The lower ROA may\nalso be due to unsustainable level of NPAs, high cost-income ratio due to heavy non-operating\nexpenditure including staff expenditure and inability of the bank to tap off-balance sheet\nbusiness opportunities.  It could be possible that the bank suffered losses on account of interest\nrate and currency mismatches.  Imprudent pricing of assets and liabilities without reckoning cost\n-yield relationship also leads to lower ROA.  Raising the ROA requires restructuring of asset-liability profile, scientific pricing, undertaking fee-based activities, control over non-operating\nexpenditure and reduction of NPAs to contain provisioning level within reasonable range.\n7.3.3 Mandatory Actions\n? Paying off costly deposits and CDs\n? Increasing fee based income\n? Containing administrative expenses\n? Special drive to reduce the stock of NPAs and contain generation of fresh NPAs\n? Restriction on entry into new lines of business\n? Reduction / suspension of dividend payments\n? Restrictions on borrowings from inter bank market\n7.3.4 Discretionary Actions\n? Capital expenditure only for technological upgradation and for day-to-day operations within\nBoard approved limits\n? Staff expansion / filling up of vacancies only with prior approval of RBI, except recruitment\nof specialists\n8. Institutional Mechanism\nThe published balance sheets, off-site returns and on-site inspection reports will be the primary\nsources for identifying the banks, which could be placed under the PCA framework.   If a bank\u2019s\nperformance under any of the three broad parameters has crossed the trigger point, the bank will\nbe placed under corrective action programme. Such corrective action will consist specific\nmandatory action and those of discretionary actions, which in the opinion of Reserve Bank, may\nbe applied to the concerned bank.  Once a bank is under corrective action programme, BFS will\nbe informed of the same.\n9. Application of Mandatory and Discretionary Actions\nWhile some of the actions under PCA can be initiated by the Reserve Bank of India on its own,\nin certain cases prior approval of the Government of India will be obtained by the RBI.  Details\nof these actions are indicated in the Annexure.\n10. Legal Protection to Supervisors\nAs regards legal protection to supervisors who will be authorising Prompt Corrective Action,\nSection 54 of Banking Regulation Act, 1949 provides for the following:\nS.54 (1) No suit or other legal proceeding shall lie against the Central Government, the\nReserve Bank or any officer for anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done in\npursuance of this Act.\n          (2) Save as otherwise expressly provided by or under this Act, no suit or other legal\nproceeding shall lie against the Central Government, the Reserve Bank or any officer for anydamage caused or likely to be caused by anything in good faith done or intended to be done in\npursuance of this Act.\n11 Conclusion\n11.1 Allowing a bank to fail is the tragedy that a supervisor should try to avoid.  In order to\nensure that banks are not allowed to fail, it is essential that corrective actions must be taken when\nbanks have adequate cushion of capital and their financial position is still satisfactory. This is\nimportant since low or negative capital base and adverse financial conditions will induce banks\nto try desperate measures such as, offering very high interest rates on deposits to fund high risk\nborrowers. The Basel Committee had also endorsed the need for supervisors taking timely\ncorrective action when banks fail to meet CRAR or other prudential requirements. It is accepted\nthat intervention should be guided by rules rather than left to the discretion of supervisors.\n11.2   The rule-based framework in most of the countries focuses on the need to prevent\ninsolvency of banks. It is, however, considered desirable to build a broader PCA  regime in India\nso as to delineate rule-based actions not only for shortfall in capital but also for other indicators\nof deficiency so that a seamless paradigm for corrective actions can be put in place for major\ndeficiencies in banks\u2019 functioning.  Accordingly, a schedule of corrective actions has been\nworked out based on three parameters, i.e. CRAR, Net NPAs and ROA.  It is suggested to\nincorporate a blend of mandatory and discretionary prompt actions for every trigger point to deal\ncomprehensively with different dimensions of problems.   However, the discretion to enforce\nPCA will be vested with RBI.\nAnnexure\nMandatory / Discretionary actions under the scheme of Prompt Corrective Action ( PCA)\nI.

Some of the public sector banks have approached us seeking clarifications regarding the\nmanner in which the annexing of the balance sheets etc. of the subsidiaries is to be done.  We\nhave examined the matter and it has been decided as under:\ni) Parent bank may  annex only the annual accounts and  Auditors\u2019 report of  the\nsubsidiaries to its balance sheet.\nii) The Directors\u2019 report in respect of the subsidiaries should be made available\non the web site of the parent bank and may be made available by the parent\nbank, on request, to those who desire to have them.\niii) The above procedure  should be continued  till such time the bank switches\nover to the consolidated balance sheet system.\niv) Accounting year of the entities which are banking subsidiaries should\nnormally  be co-terminus with that of the parent bank and hence the date of the\nannual accounts of such subsidiaries, annexed to the parent\u2019s balance sheet,\nshould coincide with the date of  annual accounts of the parent.  In respect of\nsubsidiaries which may have an  accounting year different from that of the\nparent bank, the annual accounts annexed should not relate  to a date earlier\nthan six months prior to the date of the annual accounts of the parent bank.\nYours faithfully,\n(B.Mahapatra)\nGeneral Manager", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/19956.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Mar 29, 2001", "info": "Receipt of Foreign Contributions by\nAssociations/Organisations in India\nunder Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976\nDBOD.No.BP.BC. 92  /21.01.023/2000-1\nMarch 22 , 2001\nAll Commercial Banks\n(Excluding RRBs)\nReceipt of Foreign Contributions by\nAssociations/Organisations in India\nunder Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976\nPlease refer to our circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.74/21.01.023/2000-01 dated February 1, 2001,\nadvising banks  the  exemption granted by Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs,\nwith immediate effect and upto 31st March 2001 to all associations/organisations (other than a\npolitical party) having a definite cultural, economic, educational, religious or social\nprogramme  from the provisions of section 6(1-A) of the Foreign Contribution Regulation\nAct, 1976, to accept foreign contribution for providing relief to the earthquake victims of\nGujarat without obtaining a formal approval of the Central Government subject to certain\nconditions mentioned therein.\n2 .

It has, however, been represented to us that the foregoing stipulations deter the\nfinancial institutions from restructuring of standard and sub standard loan assets even though the\nmodification of terms might not jeopardise the assurance of repayment of dues from the borrower.\nThe present norms have, therefore, been reviewed in the light of the international best practices\nand the BIS guidelines in the matter and it has been decided to effect certain changes in the norms\nrelating to restructuring / rescheduling / renegotiation  of terms of the standard and sub-standard\nloan assets, as detailed in the following paragraphs.\n3.In the context of r estructuring of the accounts, the following stages at which the\nrestructuring / rescheduling / renegotiation of the terms of loan agreement could take place, can\nbe identified:\n(a) before commencement of commercial production;2\n(b) after commencement of commercial production but before the asset has been classified as\nsub standard,\n(c) after commencement of commercial production and the asset has been classified as sub\nstandard.\nIn each of the foregoing three stages, the rescheduling, etc., of principal and/or of interest could\ntake place, with or without sacrifice, as part of the restructuring package evolved.\n4.The prudential treatment of the accounts, subjected to restructuring / rescheduling /\nrenegotiation of terms, would be governed by the following norms:\n4.1Treatment of restructured standard accounts\na. A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, at any of the aforesaid first\ntwo stages would not cause a standard asset to be classified in the sub standard\ncategory provided the loan/credit facility is fully secured.\nb. A rescheduling of interest element at any of the foregoing first two stages would\nnot cause an asset to be downgraded to sub standard category subject to the\ncondition that the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the element of interest, measured\nin present value terms , is either written off or provision is made to the extent of\nthe sacrifice involved. For the purpose, the future interest due as per the original\nloan agreement in respect of an account should be discounted to the present value\nat a rate appropriate to the risk category of the borrower (i.e., current PLR + the\nappropriate credit risk premium for the borrower-category) and compared with the\npresent value of the dues expected to be received under the restructuring package,\ndiscounted on the same basis.\nc. In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value\nterms, as at  (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or\nprovision made to the extent of the sacrifice involved.\n4.2 Treatment of restructured sub-standard accounts\na.A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, would render a sub-standard\nasset eligible to be continued  in the sub-standard category for the specified period,\nprovided  the loan/credit facility is fully secured .\nb.       A rescheduling of interest element would render a sub-standard asset\neligible to be continued  to be classified in  sub standard  category for the\nspecified period subject to the condition that the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the\nelement of interest, measured in present value terms , is either written off or3\nprovision is made to the extent of the sacrifice involved. For the purpose, the\nfuture interest due as per the original loan agreement in respect of an account\nshould be discounted to the present value at a rate appropriate to the risk category\nof the borrower (i.e., current PLR + the appropriate credit risk premium for the\nborrower-category) and compared with the present value of the dues expected to\nbe received under the restructuring package, discounted on the same basis.\nc.       In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present\nvalue terms, as at (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or\nprovision made to the extent of the sacrifice involved. Even in cases where the\nsacrifice is by way of write off of the past interest dues, the asset should continue\nto be treated as sub-standard.\nThe sub-standard accounts at (a), (b) and (c) above, which have been subjected to restructuring,\netc, whether in respect of principal instalment  or interest amount, by whatever modality, would be\neligible to be upgraded to the standard category  only after the specified period, i.e., a period of\none year after the date when first payment of interest or of principal, whichever is earlier, falls\ndue, subject to satisfactory performance during the period. The amount of provision  made earlier,\nnet of the amount provided for the sacrifice in the interest amount in present value terms as\naforesaid, could also be reversed  after the one-year period.\nDuring this one-year period, the sub-standard asset will not deteriorate in its classification if\nsatisfactory performance of the account is demonstrated during the period. In case, however, the\nsatisfactory performance during the one year period is not evidenced, the asset classification of\nthe restructured account would be governed as per the applicable prudential norms with reference\nto the pre-restructuring payment schedule .\nRestructuring of doubtful/loss assets\n5.The extant instructions relating to doubtful/loss assets which are subsequently classified as\nsub-standard consequent to restructuring/renegotiations/rescheduling will remain unchanged.\nAccordingly, the reversal of provisions made or amount written off till the asset becomes eligible\nto be classified as performing asset, will continue to be NOT permitted, as hitherto. Such sub-\nstandard assets, if subsequently subjected to restructuring/renegotiations/rescheduling, would be\ngoverned by the norms of paragraph 4 above.\nApplicability4\n6. The foregoing norms for restructuring, etc., of standard and sub-standard assets would be\napplicable, in supercession of the existing RBI norms  in respect of such assets in so far as they\nrelate to restructuring/ rescheduling / renegotiation  of the terms of the loan agreement.

As on 31st March 2000 the NPAs for the Indian Banking System aggregated\nRs.60,841 crore # # and those for the select all-India FIs it stood at Rs. 18,146.00 crore # #. In\nthis context, a view has been expressed that at least a part of the reason for phenomenal rise\nin NPAs has been a lack of the requisite co-ordination between the banks and FIs particularly\nwhere they are joint financiers of large value projects. (It is recognised in this regard that\npursuant to the recommendations of the Working Group on Harmonizing the role and\noperations of DFIs and Banks [Chairman Shri S.H. Khan], a Standing Co-ordination\nCommittee  has become operational since October 1999 under the aegis of IDBI and select\nFIs and banks are represented on the Committee ). Such jointly financed projects also give\nrise to certain operational issues which, it is felt, can be better addressed through a more\neffective and closer co-ordination between the two sets of lenders viz., the banks and the FIs.\nIn this background, the Governor, Reserve Bank of India, had taken two meetings of select\nFIs and banks, the latter one on 7 November 2000; the minutes of the meeting were sent to\nthe participants on 24 November 2000. It was decided at the meeting that while the matter of\ntreatment of restructured accounts for asset classification purposes would be examined by\nRBI as a regulator, on certain other issues of mutual interest to the FIs and banks, a draft \"non\npaper\" would be prepared to facilitate further discussion in the matter among the banks and\nthe FIs. Accordingly, this paper seeks to raise the following issues for comments from the\nselect banks and the FIs:\n\u2022 Delay in sanction of various credit facilities\n\u2022 Asset classification across consortium  members\n\u2022 Disciplining borrowers - change in management\n\u2022 Levy of charges in problem / restructured accounts\n\u2022 Implementation of Group Approach for borrowers\n\u2022 Sharing of securities and cash flows - Trust & Retention Account (TRA) mechanism\n2.Various aspects of each of the foregoi ng issues are briefly discussed in the following\nparagraphs in order to facilitate the formulation of \"ground rules\" or a code of conduct by\nbanks / institutions.\n(a)  Delay in sanction of various credit facilities\nOne of the reasons for the mounting NPAs in the Indian financial sector is stated to be the\ninordinate delays in sanctioning credit facilities, particularly, under project financing, where\nsubstantial quantum of cost overrun needs to be financed by the members of the consortium\nin respect of  \"last mile\" projects or in  other cases involving restructuring or rehabilitation of\naccounts.  The delay arises generally on account of lack of co-ordination and consensus\namong lenders on financing the amount of cost overrun or restructuring or rehabilitation.  At\ntimes the delays also arise for want of commitment for working capital facilities from the\nbankers though the term lending for the project might have been fully tied up.  This in turn\ndelays the operationalisation of the project.\nThe issues raised in this regard are : (a) the introduction of the concept of super majority\nwhose decision should be binding on all the members of the consortium, and (b) the time\nframe within which the entire credit processing for new as well as the existing projectsincluding overrun financing should be completed.  The various ramifications of these issues\nare discussed below.  \nA view has been expressed that to obviate delay in financing, the decision should be taken as\nper the \"super majority\" of lenders that should be binding on all the members of the\nconsortium.  Super majority in such cases is suggested to be the secured creditors with more\nthan 70 per cent share in total lending.  It is also suggested that  inter creditor agreement\nmight  also be necessary in such cases to make the super majority  decision legally  binding\non all the members. A contrary view has also been expressed that the concept of  \"super-\nmajority\" should not be imposed on the dissenting minority in the consortium since in project\nfinancing the banks, as working capital providers, would always be in minority and,\ntherefore, would not be able to safeguard their interests. Further, it was suggested that in case\nof overrun financing, the share of the dissenting minority should be frozen at the existing\nlevels and any further contribution required from the minority in the overrun financing,\nshould be contributed by the majority itself. As a variation to this view, it was suggested that\nin consortia where a single lender holds more than 30 per cent share of the total lending, the\ndecision by a simple majority comprising 51% share in total lending, should suffice and\nshould be treated as binding on all the members of the consortium.\nOn examining the above views, the following approach may be appropriate:\n(a) As regards the time-frame for sanction of facilities, it is felt that in the case of\naccounts where only two lenders are involved, any issues relating to sanction of\nfacilities should be expeditiously resolved by mutual discussions between them.\n(b) In case where more than two lenders were involved, their agreement or disagreement\nfor sanction of facilities must be conveyed within a maximum period of 90 days from\nthe date of receiving loan applications, complete in all respects.\n(c) In case of fresh loan proposals involving more than two lenders, the sanction or\nrejection should be conveyed within a period of two months from the date of the\nappraisal note by the lenders which had initially agreed in-principle to participate in\nthe financing.\n(d) In case of accounts involving restructuring, the lead institutions should complete the\nrestructuring process within three months while the other participating lenders should\nconvey their decision within two months from the date of receipt of appraisal note\n(b)      Asset classification across consortium  members\nIn the days prior to the deregulation of the Indian financial system, the Reserve Bank had\nprescribed detailed guidelines for financing of borrowers under consortium arrangement.\nOne of the prescriptions of those guidelines was that all the members should follow the asset\nclassification of the leader of the consortium regardless of the performance of the account in\ntheir own respective books.  However, with progressive deregulation and liberalisation  of the\nbanking sector and realising  certain anomalies in the aforesaid dispensation, Reserve Bank\nstipulated that in consortium financing each lender could classify the asset according to the\nrecord of recovery in its own books regardless of asset classification in the books of the\nleader of the consortium. It is now contended that such liberalisation has given rise to certain\nunhealthy and unethical practices on the part of the borrowers.\nThere were broadly two streams of thought regarding asset classification of consortium\naccounts.  While one view is that  uniform asset classification across all the members of the\nconsortium should be reintroduced by Reserve Bank to pre-empt the possibility of theborrower playing one lender against the other, a counter-view is that the asset classification\nshould continue to be lender- specific as at present  and should not be guided by the\nclassification of the lead lender.  It is argued in this regard that such  a system is necessarily\nto create the right incentives for the lenders for effective follow up and recovery and for\nrewarding the recovery efforts of the lenders by way of  better asset classification.  It is\nfurther averred that lender-specific classification is all the more necessary for reflecting true\nand fair picture of the asset quality in accordance with the performance of the account in the\nbooks of each of the lender rather than being distorted by imposition  lead classification\nacross all the lenders.  Prima facie , there appears to be some merit in this line of argument.\nA practical difficulty in following the classification of the lead institution / super majority of\nlenders / lead and second lead institution is the likelihood of change in the asset  classification\nby the auditors of the lead, etc., institution subsequent to such classification having been\nadopted by other members of the consortium. A suggestion, therefore, made in this context  is\nto put in place a mechanism to ensure that where the lead classification is already adopted by\nthe members of the consortium, the auditors of the lead institution do not subsequently effect\na change in the asset classification since it creates a system-wide repurcussion for all the\nlenders.  While this practical constraint is understood and recognised, it may not be feasible\nin practice to place an embargo on the auditors of the lead institution from changing the asset\nclassification in the books of a lender as per their own best judgement.\nMajority view would seem to be in favour of continuing the existing dispensation of lender-\nspecific asset classification of  a consortium account.\n(c)    Disciplining borrowers - change in management\nA view has been expressed that the recalcitrant attitude of certain defaulting borrowers and\ntheir deliberate non-cooperation with the lenders for turning around the unit, have also\nsignificantly contributed to the burgeoning levels of NPAs in the system.  In such\ncircumstances, lenders are at times constrained to adopt the extreme measure of effecting a\nchange in the management of borrowing unit with a view to inducing an element of credit\ndiscipline and improving the health and viability of the borrowing unit.  Since changing the\nmanagement of the borrowing unit is an extreme measure, to be adopted only exceptionally, a\nquestion arises as to what should be the specific criteria for resorting to the extreme remedy\nof changing the management of the defaulting borrowing unit.\nThere is divergence in the views held in this regard. While some of the criteria suggested for\nthe purpose are listed in the Annexure I , it has also been indicated that continuance of an\naccount in the NPA category for a period of 18 months should be ground enough for effecting\na change in the management of the unit.  The modality suggested in this case is the invocation\nof the \"convertibility clause\" in the loan agreements and creation of a pool of professional\nmanagers for running the unit on behalf of the lenders after the change in the management is\neffected. Certain other criteria suggested for the purpose are diversion of funds, unapproved\ninvestments in the associate firms, more than 50 per cent erosion in the networth and inability\nof the promoters to infuse fresh funds equal to losses of the unit. It has also suggested in the\nsame breath that BIFR has outlived its utility and needs to be wound up since it has in effect\nbecome a shelter and resort for the sick units and wilful defaulters.\nAs a variant of the aforesaid approach it has also been suggested that once an account\nbecomes NPA, the promoters should be asked to pledge their entire stake (shareholding) in\nfavour of the lender.  The lenders thereafter should prescribe  specific milestones to beachieved by the borrowers within the specified time frame. The progress in achieving the\nmilestones should be closely monitored and if the promoters / borrowers are unable to\ncomply with the prescribed benchmarks and time schedule, the lending institution should\neffect a change in the management of the borrowing unit on the strength of its majority\nshareholding in the borrowing company.\nYet another view expressed in this regard is that the case-specific decision for change in\nmanagement of a particular borrowing unit should be left to the discretion of the members of\nthe consortium on a case to case basis and no uniform approach should be mandated for the\npurpose.\nAs regards the concept of change in the management for disciplining the borrowers, it is\npointed out that the success rate for banks in cases of change in management of the\nborrowing unit, has been very low and this approach, therefore, does not inspire much\nconfidence as a solution to turning around sick / defaulting unit.\nBesides, it is also mentioned that the extant provisions of Banking Regulation Act do not\npermit the banks to have a majority stake in a company unlike the FIs, which are not subject\nto any such restriction.  It is, therefore, indicated that if a change in management by the banks\nis to be a practicable option for turning around the sick units, necessary amendments to\nprovisions of  B. R. Act would be a pre-requisite for the purpose.\nA reference is also made in this regard to the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act\nwhich do not provide any legal protection to the nominee directors nominated by the banks\non the Boards of the borrowing companies whereas the nominee directors of FIs on the Board\nof borrowing companies do enjoy certain legal protection.   This anomally too needs to be\nresolved before change in management of units could emerge as viable option.\nA related issue raised in this regard is whether while effecting any change in management of\na company within a group, the change in the management of even the healthy units of the\ngroup should also be considered, especially if several units within the group are in the non-\nperforming category.\nFurthermore, it is pointed out that mere change of management of the defaulting unit   is not\nthe solution to the underlying fundamental problems and hence, there is a need to provide for\ndeterrent punishment to the wilful defaulters through appropriate statutory enactments.\nReckoning the divergence of views in respect of uniform criteria for effecting change in\nmanagement of defaulting unit, the practicable solution appears to be to follow the views of\nthe majority of lenders in a consortium (say 70 per cent of total funded exposure), on a\nconsortium-specific basis.  It may also be worthwhile to effect the change in management in a\nfew extreme cases expeditiously, which could create deterrent example for the borrowing\ncommunity.\n(d)Levy of charges in problem accounts\nA view has been expressed that one of the reasons for high level of NPAs in the Indian\nfinancial system is the application of not only high rate of interest applicable at the time of\nsanction of loan but also levy of various other charges, such as, penal interest, overdue\ninterest, liquidated damages, etc., at very high rates by the lenders.  Such levies have resulted\nin inflating the amount of NPAs especially when viewed in the current low interest rate\nregime.  A question, therefore, arises whether it would prudentially be desirable to evolve aceiling on levy of such penal, etc., charges from the defaulters in respect of problem accounts\nso that the level of NPAs is not unduly distorted.\nDivergent views have been expressed in this regard. On the one hand it has been suggested\nthat the concept of penal interest, liquidated damages, etc., should be dispensed with\naltogether as it has failed to serve the purpose of disciplining the borrowers. On the other\nhand a suggestion has also emanated from certain quarters for placing a ceiling of 18 per cent\non all levies taken together as it is expected to adequately cover the cost of funds even in the\nerstwhile high interest rate regime.\nIn another variant of the proposed ceiling it has been suggested that instead of prescribing an\nabsolute ceiling on total charges, the ceiling on penal charges should be fixed at 2 to 3 per\ncent above the contracted rate of interest regardless of what the contracted rate was.\nIt is also contended that reckoning very high rates at which various levies and charges have\nbeen debited to the borrowers in the past, if any concession is considered desirable for\nrecovery of dues, it should be extended only as a part of overall restructuring / rehabilitation\npackage and not otherwise. However, such concession should be extended subject to the\nright of recompense  being reserved by the lenders. This suggestion is, however, countered\nby stating that the right to recompense clause has proved to be ineffective since BIFR and the\nborrowers have not agreed to such a clause and even though such a clause was included in the\nrehabilitation package, recoveries have not been possible.\nReckoning divergent views and suggestions made in the matter, majority felt that while the\nconsortium members should decide the rate of interest to be charged on such accounts, penal\ninterest or other charges, if any, should not exceed two percentage points above the\ncontracted rate.\n(e)Group approach for borrowers\nIt has  been a common experience that within a borrower group, while some of the units\nmight be facing difficulties and may be defaulters to the lenders, certain other units of the\nsame Group might be quite healthy and prosperous. The issues have been raised whether in\nsuch a situation it would be feasible or desirable to grant additional credit facilities to the\nhealthy units of the group with a condition that such facilities be used only for repaying the\ndues of the defaulting unit.  It is contended in this context that even in cases where such\npossibilities might exist, there is a lack of requisite cooperation between the banks and FIs.\nCertain basic issues have also been raised in this regard regarding the definition of Group.  It\nis contended before adopting a \"group approach\" , a clarity in definition of \"Group\" was a pre-\nrequisite which needed to be studied in depth by an expert group.\nThe adoption of the group approach on the foregoing lines with a view to recovering the dues\nof the non-performing units by granting fresh facilities to the healthy units of the group has\ngenerally not been well received.  It has been pointed out that such an approach would be\nneither legally tenable nor workable in practice besides amounting to a tacit approval for\ndiversion of funds.  Such an approach is also contended to be contrary to the principles of\ngood corporate governance since it would not be in the interest of the minority shareholders\nof the healthy companies of the group and could also undermine the financials of such\nhealthy units in the long run.  Moreover, every company in a group being a separate legal\nentity, such a linkage in lending to the healthy units of a group, might not stand the legal\nscrutiny.   As a counter argument, however, it has been mentioned that such an approach\ncould possibly be considered in cases where non-performing unit had diverted the funds tothe healthy units of the group and the non-performing unit was considered to be financially\nviable.\nOn the other hand, a view has been expressed that, regardless of the legal tenability of the\naforesaid approach, there should not be a blanket prohibition on  adopting such a practice and\nthe decision to adopt this approach, if found feasible in certain cases, should be left to the\ndiscretion and commercial judgement of the lenders concerned. This was particularly\nnecessary since there could be circumstances where such an approach was considered\nappropriate on account of genuine difficulties of the non-performing unit or where the owners\n/ shareholders of the healthy units were willing to borrow for meeting the dues of the non-\nperforming units.  It was also pointed out that the aforesaid group approach could possibly be\nconsidered as a part of overall restructuring package in respect of a defaulting unit.  Hence,\nno uniform approach or rules should be laid down in this regard.\nReckoning the various practical difficulties in operationalising the group approach, a\npragmatic solution which emerges is to exercise due circumspection in extending fresh credit\nfacilities to the units of a group where certain other units have been in default with the\nlenders.  However, it would also need to be ensured that the normal funding requirements of\nthe healthy performing units do not get hampered in the process. It was, however, felt that if\n70 % majority of lenders (in terms of their funded exposures) agree to effect a change in the\nmanagement of the defaulting borrowal  unit, or to convert the loans to equity for subsequent\noff-loading of the same to the highest bidder through auction, they should take such decisions\non a consortium-specific basis. Such action should be taken in certain specific circumstances\n(e.g., where sickness was induced by the same promoters in several units) in at least a few\ncases expeditiously in order to set a deterrent example  in this regard.\n(f) Sharing of securities and cash flows - Trust & Retention Account (TRA) mechanism\nIn the joint financing of large value projects by banks and FIs, the sharing of securities as also\nof the cash flows of the borrowers has been a contentious issue.  A general view is expressed\nthat while the banks are reluctant to create pari passu or second charge over the current assets\nin favour of the FIs, the FIs try to delay the creation of pari passu or second charge on the\nfixed assets of the borrowers in favour of the banks.  Likewise, in the problem accounts when\nthe cash flows of the borrowers are not sufficient to service the dues of the banks as well as\nof the FIs, well defined mechanism does not exist for equitable sharing of cash flows between\nthe two sets of lenders. Hence, it is felt that there is a need to evolve an effective and smooth\nmechanism for safeguarding the interests of both classes of lenders in jointly financed large\nprojects.\nA view has emerged in this regard that all the assets of the borrowers available as security\n(current or fixed) should be pooled together and shared by term lenders  ( FIs ) as also the\nworking capital providers (banks) as per their weighted average share in the total exposure to\nthe borrower.  It is, however, stated in this regard that such an approach of pooling and\nsharing of securities while perhaps feasible in respect of fresh loans, would not be workable\nin respect of old / existing stock of NPAs since the charges of the lenders would have already\nbeen registered and would, therefore, have chronological priority.  As regards creation of a\nsecond charge over the assets of the borrowers, while a view  is expressed that it should not\nbe a problem at all since creation of second charge does not dilute the security available to\nthe first charge holder, apprehensions are also expressed that  creation of second charge\nmight result in withholding of consent by the second charge holders for creation of pari passu\ncharge for additional facilities subsequently granted by the first charge holders.As regards pro rata  sharing of securities among the lenders in consortium, a view has also\nbeen expressed that at times the FIs hold certain securities by way of  pledge of promoters'\nshares or the real estate, etc.,  in the project company but such a security  is not shared by\nthem with the other lenders in the consortium.   Such FIs subsequently enter into undisclosed\narrangements with the borrowers / promoters for disposal of such securities at attractive\nprices but do not involve the banks in the exercise and also do not share the proceeds with the\nother members of the consortium.  There was, therefore, a need to curb such practices in the\nsystem.\nAs regards the system of Trust and Retention Account (TRA - a brief write up furnished at\nAnnexure  II), it has been opined that TRA mechanism would be possible to adopt only if the\nbanks and FIs share the charge over the entire assets of the borrower and only if such sharing\nis made a part of the terms and conditions of sanction of limits.  On the other hand, adoption\nof TRA mechanism is strongly advocated since it is stated to be a healthy practice, is\nexpected to bring about greater discipline among the borrowers and would be fair and\ntransparent to all the members of the consortium.  It has also been argued  in this regard that\nsince the TRA concept has been successful in case of infrastructure financing, it could be\nsuitably adapted for project financing as well.  However, a technical point has been raised in\noperationalising  the TRA mechanism that all the cash flows of borrower   (such as proceeds\nof the bill discounted for a manufacturing project) cannot be shared with the FIs since the bill\nfinancing by definition is meant to be self liquidating in nature and proceeds must be fully\nappropriated by the discounting bank only. Certain apprehensions have also been expressed\nthat the TRA mechanism is biased in favour of the FIs and is not fair to the banks, the\nprocedure is quite cumbersome and is not practicable in all the cases.\nThere is, therefore, a need to take a view that where TRA mechanism is not feasible, what\nshould the alternative mechanism be to safeguard the interest of all the lenders.\nANNEXURE I\nSuggested criteria for effecting change in management of  defaulting units\n1) Chronic wilful default of the borrower;\n2) Loss of confidence in the management of the borrowing unit by the lenders - to be\ndecided by the majority of lenders;\n3) Non-compliance with the time frame and  quantum of committed contribution from\nthe promoters;\n4) Non-commencement of commercial production within one year from the date\noriginally planned without assigning any unavoidable reasons.\n5) Any fraudulent action / convictions under any law;\n6) Any major penal action by any regulatory authority against the management of the\ncompany evidencing fraudulent intentions of the management;\nANNEXURE II\nTrust and Retention Account (TRA) mechanism\nTRA mechanism has been a common feature in financing of infrastructure projects. It seeks\nto protect the project lenders against the credit risk (the risk of debt service default) byinsulating the cash flows of the project company. This is done through shifting the control\nover future cash flows from the hands of the borrowers (project company) to an independent\nagent, called TRA agent , duly mandated by the lenders.\n2.The infrastructure projects are executed through a separate company created for th e\npurpose (called 'Special Purpose Vehicle' - SPV) and the shares of the SPV would normally\nbe held, among others, by the sponsors of the project. The cash flows of the SPV (project\ncompany) are subjected to a TRA arrangement. Under this arrangement, the lenders , the\nborrower  and the TRA agent  enter into a tri-partite agreement , which provides for all\nrevenues of the project to be directed into a single account, maintained with the designated\nTRA agent. The lenders, in consultation with the borrower, draw up a detailed mandate  for\nthe TRA agent as to periodic transfer and utilisation of funds available in the TRA. The\nmandate basically spells out the manner and purpose of various payments including the debt\nservice to the lenders. The payment to the lenders is to be made directly by the TRA agent, as\nper its mandate, without any intervention by the borrower. For operational convenience, the\nTRA could be sub-divided into several sub-TRAs dedicated to separate heads of expenses /\npurposes. In case of multi currency cash flows, there could also be separate TRAs with the\nsame agent or different TRA agents for handling the cash flows in various currencies. Thus,\nthe TRA agent acts as a trustee on behalf of the lenders and ensures that the cash flows are\naccessible to the borrower / project company, strictly as per the mandate. Thus, the TRA\nmechanism could be viewed as a sophisticated version of the traditional 'No Lien' accounts,\non which the concerned bank could not exercise its right of general lien.\n3.Illustratively , the mandate to the TRA agent by the lenders for appropriation of cash\nflows could prescribe the following sequence for end use of funds:\n\u2022 All operation and maintenance expenses of the project;\n\u2022 Monthly dues / accruals of net principal and interest payments to lenders;\n\u2022 A debt service reserve equal to, say, six months' dues  - which could also be backed by a\nletter of credit to be arranged by the sponsors of the project company;\n\u2022 A cash reserve equal to, say, four months' operating expenses;\n\u2022 After meeting all the foregoing obligations, either through L/C or out of project cash\nflows, the residual funds, if any, would be available to the project company for disposal\nas per their discretion or as pre-determined by the mandate given to the TRA agent. .\n4.A Trust and Retention Account mechanism needs to be distinguished from an Escrow\nAccount arrangement, though the two are somewhat similar. An Escrow Account is an\narrangement for safeguarding the borrower against its customers from the payment risk for\nthe goods or services sold by the former to the latter. This is achieved by removing the\ncontrol over the cash flows from the hands of the customer to an independent agent, who in\nturn could ensure appropriation of cash flows as per the its mandate. The Escrow\narrangement provides for directing a pre-determined payment stream from the customers of\nthe borrower to a special account maintained with a designated agent. Payment / deposit by\nthe user / buyer into such an account is assumed to be a valid discharge of his liability to the\nsupplier of the goods / services. An Escrow arrangement involves parties different from the\nparties in a TRA mechanism. The Escrow arrangement would involve usually four parties:\nthe lender, the borrower, the customers of the borrower and the Escrow Agent. The mandate\nto the Escrow Agent would normally be finalised by the lenders in consultation with the\nborrower and its customers.\n5.Thus, for instance, in financing of a power plant which sells its power generated to a\nSEB, the Escrow arrangement would involve the power producer (borrower), the SEBconcerned (customer), the bank / FI (lenders) and the Escrow Agent (a designated bank). The\nSEB would agree to direct its collection centres to deposit the electricity charges received\nfrom retail consumers, into a designated account with the designated bank (Escrow agent)\nand to direct its bulk consumers to deposit their payments directly with the Escrow Agent in\nthe specified account. The Escrow Agent would then appropriate the funds in the Escrow\naccount as per the priority laid down in the Escrow Agreement.\n# # : Source : Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India, 1999-2000", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/19612.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Mar 12, 2001", "info": "Interest Rate on Export Credit\nDBS.

Srinivasan)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nEncls: As above\nInformal note for discussion on \u201cCo-ordination issues between banks and FIs\u201d\n1.Introduction\nThe level of NPAs in the Indian Financial System which has recorded an up-ward\ntrend in the recent past has been an area of concern among the lenders as well as for\nthe supervisors and the Government. As on 31st March 2000 the NPAs for the Indian\nBanking System aggregated Rs.60 ,841 crore # # and those for the select all-India FIs it\nstood at Rs. 18,146.00 crore # #. In this context, a view has been expressed that at least\na part of the reason for phenomenal rise in NPAs has been a lack of the requisite co-\nordination between the banks and FIs particularly where they are joint financiers of\nlarge value projects. (It is recognised in this regard that pursuant to the\nrecommendations of the Working Group on Harmonizing the role and operations of\nDFIs and Banks [Chairman Shri S.H. Khan], a Standing Co-ordination Committee\nhas become operational since October 1999 under the aegis of IDBI and select FIs and\nbanks are represented on the Committee ). Such jointly financed projects also give\nrise to certain operational issues which, it is felt, can be better addressed through a\nmore effective and closer co-ordination between the two sets of lenders viz., the banks\nand the FIs.\nIn this background, the Governor, Reserve Bank of India, had taken two meetings of\nselect FIs and banks, the latter one on 7 November 2000; the minutes of the meeting\nwere sent to the participants on 24 November 2000. It was decided at the meeting that\nwhile the matter of treatment of restructured accounts for asset classification purposes\nwould be examined by RBI as a regulator, on certain other issues of mutual interest to\nthe FIs and banks, a draft \"non paper\" would be prepared to facilitate further\ndiscussion in the matter among the banks and the FIs. Accordingly, this paper seeks to\nraise the following issues for comments from the select banks and the FIs:\n\u2022 Delay in sanction of various credit facilities\n\u2022 Asset classification across consortium  members\n\u2022 Disciplining borrowers - change in management\n\u2022 Levy of charges in problem / restructured accounts\n\u2022 Implementation of Group Approach for borrowers\n\u2022 Sharing of securities and cash flows - Trust & Retention Account (TRA)\nmechanism\n2.Various aspects of each of the foregoing issues are briefly discussed in the\nfollowing paragraphs in order to facilitate the formulation of \"ground rules\" or a code\nof conduct by banks / institutions.(a)      Delay in sanction of various credit facilities\nOne of the reasons for the mounting NPAs in the Indian financial sector is stated to be\nthe inordinate delays in sanctioning credit facilities, particularly, under project\nfinancing,\nwhere substantial quantum of cost overrun needs to be financed by the members of\nthe consortium in respect of  \"last mile\" projects or in  other cases involving\nrestructuring or rehabilitation of accounts.  The delay arises generally on account of\nlack of co-ordination and consensus among lenders on financing the amount of cost\noverrun or restructuring or rehabilitation.  At times the delays also arise for want of\ncommitment for working capital facilities from the bankers though the term lending\nfor the project might have been fully tied up.  This in turn delays the\noperationalisation of the project.\nThe issues raised in this regard are : (a) the introduction of the concept of super\nmajority whose decision should be binding on all the members of the consortium, and\n(b) the time frame within which the entire credit processing for new as well as the\nexisting projects including overrun financing should be completed.  The various\nramifications of these issues are discussed below.\nA view has been expressed that to obviate delay in financing, the decision should be\ntaken as per the \"super majority\" of lenders that should be binding on all the members\nof the consortium.  Super majority in such cases is suggested to be the secured\ncreditors with more than 70 per cent share in total lending.  It is also suggested that\ninter creditor agreement might  also be necessary in such cases to make the super\nmajority  decision legally  binding on all the members. A contrary view has also been\nexpressed that the concept of  \"super-majority\" should not be imposed on the\ndissenting minority in the consortium since in project financing the banks, as working\ncapital providers, would always be in minority and, therefore, would not be able to\nsafeguard their interests. Further, it was suggested that in case of overrun financing,\nthe share of the dissenting minority should be frozen at the existing levels and any\nfurther contribution required from the minority in the overrun financing, should be\ncontributed by the majority itself. As a variation to this view, it was suggested that in\nconsortia where a single lender holds more than 30 per cent share of the total lending,\nthe decision by a simple majority comprising 51% share in total lending, should\nsuffice and should be treated as binding on all the members of the consortium.\nOn examining the above views, the following approach may be appropriate:\n(a) As regards the time-frame for sanction of facilities, it is felt that in the case of\naccounts where only two lenders are involved, any issues relating to sanction\nof facilities should be expeditiously resolved by mutual discussions between\nthem.\n(b) In case where more than two lenders were involved, their agreement or\ndisagreement for sanction of facilities must be conveyed within a maximum\nperiod of 90 days from the date of receiving loan applications, complete in all\nrespects.\n(c) In case of fresh loan proposals involving more than two lenders, the sanction\nor rejection should be conveyed within a period of two months from the date\nof the appraisal note by the lenders which had initially agreed in-principle to\nparticipate in the financing.(d) In case of accounts involving restructuring, the lead institutions should\ncomplete the restructuring process within three months while the other\nparticipating lenders should convey their decision within two months from the\ndate of receipt of appraisal note\n(b)   Asset classification across consortium  members\nIn the days prior to the deregulation of the Indian financial system, the Reserve Bank\nhad prescribed detailed guidelines for financing of borrowers under consortium\narrangement.  One of the prescriptions of those guidelines was that all the members\nshould follow the asset classification of the leader of the consortium regardless of the\nperformance of the account in their own respective books.  However, with progressive\nderegulation and liberalisation  of the banking sector and realising  certain anomalies in\nthe aforesaid dispensation, Reserve Bank stipulated that in consortium financing each\nlender could classify the asset according to the record of recovery in its own books\nregardless of asset classification in the books of the leader of the consortium. It is now\ncontended that such liberalisation has given rise to certain unhealthy and unethical\npractices on the part of the borrowers.\nThere were broadly two streams of thought regarding asset classification of\nconsortium accounts.  While one view is that  uniform asset classification across all\nthe members of the consortium should be reintroduced by Reserve Bank to pre-empt\nthe possibility of the borrower playing one lender against the other, a counter-view is\nthat the asset classification should continue to be lender- specific as at present  and\nshould not be guided by the classification of the lead lender.  It is argued in this regard\nthat such  a system is necessarily to create the right incentives for the lenders for\neffective follow up and recovery and for rewarding the recovery efforts of the lenders\nby way of  better asset classification.  It is further averred that lender-specific\nclassification is all the more necessary for reflecting true and fair picture of the asset\nquality in accordance with the performance of the account in the books of each of the\nlender rather than being distorted by imposition  lead classification across all the\nlenders.  Prima facie , there appears to be some merit in this line of argument.\nA practical difficulty in following the classification of the lead institution / super\nmajority of lenders / lead and second lead institution is the likelihood of change in the\nasset  classification by the auditors of the lead, etc., institution subsequent to such\nclassification having been adopted by other members of the consortium. A suggestion,\ntherefore, made in this context  is to put in place a mechanism to ensure that where the\nlead classification is already adopted by the members of the consortium, the auditors\nof the lead institution do not subsequently effect a change in the asset classification\nsince it creates a system-wide repurcussion for all the lenders.  While this practical\nconstraint is understood and recognised, it may not be feasible in practice to place an\nembargo on the auditors of the lead institution from changing the asset classification\nin the books of a lender as per their own best judgement.\nMajority view would seem to be in favour of continuing the existing dispensation of\nlender-specific asset classification of  a consortium account.\n(c)   Disciplining borrowers - change in management\nA view has been expressed that the recalcitrant attitude of certain defaulting\nborrowers and their deliberate non-cooperation with the lenders for turning around the\nunit, have also significantly contributed to the burgeoning levels of NPAs in thesystem.  In such circumstances, lenders are at times constrained to adopt the extreme\nmeasure of effecting a change in the management of borrowing unit with a view to\ninducing an element of credit discipline and improving the health and viability of the\nborrowing unit.  Since changing the management of the borrowing unit is an extreme\nmeasure, to be adopted only exceptionally, a question arises as to what should be the\nspecific criteria for resorting to the extreme remedy of changing the management of\nthe defaulting borrowing unit.\nThere is divergence in the views held in this regard. While some of the criteria\nsuggested for the purpose are listed in the Annexure I , it has also been indicated that\ncontinuance of an account in the NPA category for a period of 18 months should be\nground enough for effecting a change in the management of the unit.  The modality\nsuggested in this case is the invocation of the \"convertibility clause\" in the loan\nagreements and creation of a pool of professional managers for running the unit on\nbehalf of the lenders after the change in the management is effected. Certain other\ncriteria suggested for the purpose are diversion of funds, unapproved investments in\nthe associate firms, more than 50 per cent erosion in the networth and inability of the\npromoters to infuse fresh funds equal to losses of the unit. It has also suggested in the\nsame breath that BIFR has outlived its utility and needs to be wound up since it has in\neffect become a shelter and resort for the sick units and wilful defaulters.\nAs a variant of the aforesaid approach it has also been suggested that once an account\nbecomes NPA, the promoters should be asked to pledge their entire stake\n(shareholding) in favour of the lender.  The lenders thereafter should prescribe\nspecific milestones to be achieved by the borrowers within the specified time frame.\nThe progress in achieving the milestones should be closely monitored and if the\npromoters / borrowers are unable to comply with the prescribed benchmarks and time\nschedule, the lending institution should effect a change in the management of the\nborrowing unit on the strength of its majority shareholding in the borrowing company.\nYet another view expressed in this regard is that the case-specific decision for change\nin management of a particular borrowing unit should be left to the discretion of the\nmembers of the consortium on a case to case basis and no uniform approach should be\nmandated for the purpose.\nAs regards the concept of change in the management for disciplining the borrowers, it\nis pointed out that the success rate for banks in cases of change in management of the\nborrowing unit, has been very low and this approach, therefore, does not inspire much\nconfidence as a solution to turning around sick / defaulting unit.\nBesides, it is also mentioned that the extant provisions of Banking Regulation Act do\nnot permit the banks to have a majority stake in a company unlike the FIs, which are\nnot subject to any such restriction.  It is, therefore, indicated that if a change in\nmanagement by the banks is to be a practicable option for turning around the sick\nunits, necessary amendments to provisions of  B. R. Act would be a pre-requisite for\nthe purpose.\nA reference is also made in this regard to the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments\nAct which do not provide any legal protection to the nominee directors nominated by\nthe banks on the Boards of the borrowing companies whereas the nominee directors\nof FIs on the Board of borrowing companies do enjoy certain legal protection.   Thisanomally too needs to be resolved before change in management of units could\nemerge as viable option.\nA related issue raised in this regard is whether while effecting any change in\nmanagement of a company within a group, the change in the management of even the\nhealthy units of the group should also be considered, especially if several units within\nthe group are in the non-performing category.\nFurthermore, it is pointed out that mere change of management of the defaulting unit\nis not the solution to the underlying fundamental problems and hence, there is a need\nto provide for deterrent punishment to the wilful defaulters through appropriate\nstatutory enactments.\nReckoning the divergence of views in respect of uniform criteria for effecting change\nin management of defaulting unit, the practicable solution appears to be to follow the\nviews of the majority of lenders in a consortium (say 70 per cent of total funded\nexposure), on a consortium-specific basis.  It may also be worthwhile to effect the\nchange in management in a few extreme cases expeditiously, which could create\ndeterrent example for the borrowing community.\n(d)Levy of charges in problem accounts\nA view has been expressed that one of the reasons for high level of NPAs in the\nIndian financial system is the application of not only high rate of interest applicable at\nthe time of sanction of loan but also levy of various other charges, such as, penal\ninterest, overdue interest, liquidated damages, etc., at very high rates by the lenders.\nSuch levies have resulted in inflating the amount of NPAs especially when viewed in\nthe current low interest rate regime.  A question, therefore, arises whether it would\nprudentially be desirable to evolve a ceiling on levy of such penal, etc., charges from\nthe defaulters in respect of problem accounts so that the level of NPAs is not unduly\ndistorted.\nDivergent views have been expressed in this regard. On the one hand it has been\nsuggested that the concept of penal interest, liquidated damages, etc., should be\ndispensed with altogether as it has failed to serve the purpose of disciplining the\nborrowers. On the other hand a suggestion has also emanated from certain quarters for\nplacing a ceiling of 18 per cent on all levies taken together as it is expected to\nadequately cover the cost of funds even in the erstwhile high interest rate regime.\nIn another variant of the proposed ceiling it has been suggested that instead of\nprescribing an absolute ceiling on total charges, the ceiling on penal charges should be\nfixed at 2 to 3 per cent above the contracted rate of interest regardless of what the\ncontracted rate was.\nIt is also contended that reckoning very high rates at which various levies and charges\nhave been debited to the borrowers in the past, if any concession is considered\ndesirable for recovery of dues, it should be extended only as a part of overall\nrestructuring / rehabilitation package and not otherwise. However, such concession\nshould be extended subject to the right of recompense  being reserved by the lenders.\nThis suggestion is, however, countered by stating that the right to recompense clause\nhas proved to be ineffective since BIFR and the borrowers have not agreed to such a\nclause and even though such a clause was included in the rehabilitation package,\nrecoveries have not been possible.Reckoning divergent views and suggestions made in the matter, majority felt that\nwhile the consortium members should decide the rate of interest to be charged on such\naccounts, penal interest or other charges, if any, should not exceed two percentage\npoints above the contracted rate.\n(e)Group approach for borrowers\nIt has  been a common experience that within a borrower group, while some of the\nunits might be facing difficulties and may be defaulters to the lenders, certain other\nunits of the same Group might be quite healthy and prosperous. The issues have been\nraised whether in such a situation it would be feasible or desirable to grant additional\ncredit facilities to the healthy units of the group with a condition that such facilities be\nused only for repaying the dues of the defaulting unit.  It is contended in this context\nthat even in cases where such possibilities might exist, there is a lack of requisite\ncooperation between the banks and FIs. Certain basic issues have also been raised in\nthis regard regarding the definition of Group.  It is contended before adopting a\n\"group approach\" , a clarity in definition of \"Group\" was a pre-requisite which needed\nto be studied in depth by an expert group.\nThe adoption of the group approach on the foregoing lines with a view to recovering\nthe dues of the non-performing units by granting fresh facilities to the healthy units of\nthe group has generally not been well received.  It has been pointed out that such an\napproach would be neither legally tenable nor workable in practice besides amounting\nto a tacit approval for diversion of funds.  Such an approach is also contended to be\ncontrary to the principles of good corporate governance since it would not be in the\ninterest of the minority shareholders of the healthy companies of the group and could\nalso undermine the financials of such healthy units in the long run.  Moreover, every\ncompany in a group being a separate legal entity, such a linkage in lending to the\nhealthy units of a group, might not stand the legal scrutiny.   As a counter argument,\nhowever, it has been mentioned that such an approach   could possibly be considered\nin cases where non-performing unit had diverted the funds to the healthy units of the\ngroup and the non-performing unit was considered to be financially viable.\nOn the other hand, a view has been expressed that, regardless of the legal tenability of\nthe aforesaid approach, there should not be a blanket prohibition on  adopting such a\npractice and the decision to adopt this approach, if found feasible in certain cases,\nshould be left to the discretion and commercial judgement of the lenders concerned.\nThis was particularly necessary since there could be circumstances where such an\napproach was considered appropriate on account of genuine difficulties of the non-\nperforming unit or where the owners / shareholders of the healthy units were willing\nto borrow for meeting the dues of the non-performing units.  It was also pointed out\nthat the aforesaid group approach could possibly be considered as a part of overall\nrestructuring package in respect of a defaulting unit.  Hence, no uniform approach or\nrules should be laid down in this regard.\nReckoning the various practical difficulties in operationalising the group approach, a\npragmatic solution which emerges is to exercise due circumspection in extending\nfresh credit facilities to the units of a group where certain other units have been in\ndefault with the lenders.  However, it would also need to be ensured that the normal\nfunding requirements of the healthy performing units do not get hampered in the\nprocess. It was, however, felt that if 70 % majority of lenders (in terms of their funded\nexposures) agree to effect a change in the management of the defaulting borrowalunit, or to convert the loans to equity for subsequent off-loading of the same to the\nhighest bidder through auction, they should take such decisions on a consortium-\nspecific basis. Such action should be taken in certain specific circumstances (e.g.,\nwhere sickness was induced by the same promoters in several units) in at least a few\ncases expeditiously in order to set a deterrent example  in this regard.\n(f) Sharing of securities and cash flows - Trust & Retention Account (TRA)\nmechanism\nIn the joint financing of large value projects by banks and FIs, the sharing of\nsecurities as also of the cash flows of the borrowers has been a contentious issue.  A\ngeneral view is expressed that while the banks are reluctant to create pari passu or\nsecond charge over the current assets in favour of the FIs, the FIs try to delay the\ncreation of pari passu or second charge on the fixed assets of the borrowers in favour\nof the banks.  Likewise, in the problem accounts when the cash flows of the\nborrowers are not sufficient to service the dues of the banks as well as of the FIs, well\ndefined mechanism does not exist for equitable sharing of cash flows between the two\nsets of lenders. Hence, it is felt that there is a need to evolve an effective and smooth\nmechanism for safeguarding the interests of both classes of lenders in jointly financed\nlarge projects.\nA view has emerged in this regard that all the assets of the borrowers available as\nsecurity (current or fixed) should be pooled together and shared by term lenders  ( FIs\n) as also the working capital providers (banks) as per their weighted average share in\nthe total exposure to the borrower.  It is, however, stated in this regard that such an\napproach of pooling and sharing of securities while perhaps feasible in respect of\nfresh loans, would not be workable in respect of old / existing stock of NPAs since the\ncharges of the lenders would have already been registered and would, therefore, have\nchronological priority.  As regards creation of a second charge over the assets of the\nborrowers, while a view  is expressed that it should not be a problem at all since\ncreation of second charge does not dilute the security available to the first charge\nholder, apprehensions are also expressed that  creation of second charge might result\nin withholding of consent by the second charge holders for creation of pari passu\ncharge for additional facilities subsequently granted by the first charge holders.\nAs regards pro rata  sharing of securities among the lenders in consortium, a view has\nalso been expressed that at times the FIs hold certain securities by way of  pledge of\npromoters' shares or the real estate, etc.,  in the project company but such a security  is\nnot shared by them with the other lenders in the consortium.   Such FIs subsequently\nenter into undisclosed arrangements with the borrowers / promoters for disposal of\nsuch securities at attractive prices but do not involve the banks in the exercise and\nalso do not share the proceeds with the other members of the consortium.  There was,\ntherefore, a need to curb such practices in the system.\nAs regards the system of Trust and Retention Account (TRA - a brief write up\nfurnished at Annexure  II), it has been opined that TRA mechanism would be possible\nto adopt only if the banks and FIs share the charge over the entire assets of the\nborrower and only if such sharing is made a part of the terms and conditions of\nsanction of limits.  On the other hand, adoption of TRA mechanism is strongly\nadvocated since it is stated to be a healthy practice, is expected to bring about greater\ndiscipline among the borrowers and would be fair and transparent to all the membersof the consortium.  It has also been argued  in this regard that since the TRA concept\nhas been successful in case of infrastructure financing, it could be suitably adapted for\nproject financing as well.  However, a technical point has been raised in\noperationalising  the TRA mechanism that all the cash flows of borrower   (such as\nproceeds of the bill discounted for a manufacturing project) cannot be shared with the\nFIs since the bill financing by definition is meant to be self liquidating in nature and\nproceeds must be fully appropriated by the discounting bank only. Certain\napprehensions have also been expressed that the TRA mechanism is biased in favour\nof the FIs and is not fair to the banks, the procedure is quite cumbersome and is not\npracticable in all the cases.\nThere is, therefore, a need to take a view that where TRA mechanism is not feasible,\nwhat should the alternative mechanism be to safeguard the interest of all the lenders.\n# # : Source : Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India, 1999-2000\nANNEXURE I\nSuggested criteria for effecting change in management of  defaulting units\n1) Chronic wilful default of the borrower;\n2) Loss of confidence in the management of the borrowing unit by the lenders -\nto be decided by the majority of lenders;\n3) Non-compliance with the time frame and  quantum of committed contribution\nfrom the promoters;\n4) Non-commencement of commercial production within one year from the date\noriginally planned without assigning any unavoidable reasons.\n5) Any fraudulent action / convictions under any law;\n6) Any major penal action by any regulatory authority against the management of\nthe company evidencing fraudulent intentions of the management;\nANNEXURE II\nTrust and Retention Account (TRA) mechanism\nTRA mechanism has been a common feature in financing of infrastructure projects. It\nseeks to protect the project lenders against the credit risk (the risk of debt service\ndefault) by insulating the cash flows of the project company. This is done through\nshifting the control over future cash flows from the hands of the borrowers (project\ncompany) to an independent agent, called TRA agent , duly mandated by the lenders.\n2.The infrastructure projects are executed t hrough a separate company created\nfor the purpose (called 'Special Purpose Vehicle' - SPV) and the shares of the SPV\nwould normally be held, among others, by the sponsors of the project. The cash flows\nof the SPV (project company) are subjected to a TRA arrangement. Under this\narrangement, the lenders , the borrower  and the TRA agent  enter into a tri-partite\nagreement , which provides for all revenues of the project to be directed into a single\naccount, maintained with the designated TRA agent. The lenders, in consultation with\nthe borrower, draw up a detailed mandate  for the TRA agent as to periodic transferand utilisation of funds available in the TRA. The mandate basically spells out the\nmanner and purpose of various payments including the debt service to the lenders.\nThe payment to the lenders is to be made directly by the TRA agent, as per its\nmandate, without any intervention by the borrower. For operational convenience, the\nTRA could be sub-divided into several sub-TRAs dedicated to separate heads of\nexpenses / purposes. In case of multi currency cash flows, there could also be separate\nTRAs with the same agent or different TRA agents for handling the cash flows in\nvarious currencies. Thus, the TRA agent acts as a trustee on behalf of the lenders and\nensures that the cash flows are accessible to the borrower / project company, strictly\nas per the mandate. Thus, the TRA mechanism could be viewed as a sophisticated\nversion of the traditional 'No Lien' accounts, on which the concerned bank could not\nexercise its right of general lien.\n3.Illustratively , the mandate to the TRA agent by the lenders for appropriation\nof cash flows could prescribe the following sequence for end use of funds:\n\u2022 All operation and maintenance expenses of the project;\n\u2022 Monthly dues / accruals of net principal and interest payments to lenders;\n\u2022 A debt service reserve equal to, say, six months' dues  - which could also be\nbacked by a letter of credit to be arranged by the sponsors of the project company;\n\u2022 A cash reserve equal to, say, four months' operating expenses;\n\u2022 After meeting all the foregoing obligations, either through L/C or out of project\ncash flows, the residual funds, if any, would be available to the project company\nfor disposal as per their discretion or as pre-determined by the mandate given to\nthe TRA agent. .\n4.A Trust and Retention Account mechanism needs to be distinguished from an\nEscrow Account arrangement, though the two are somewhat similar. An Escrow\nAccount is an arrangement for safeguarding the borrower against its customers from\nthe payment risk for the goods or services sold by the former to the latter. This is\nachieved by removing the control over the cash flows from the hands of the customer\nto an independent agent, who in turn could ensure appropriation of cash flows as per\nthe its mandate. The Escrow arrangement provides for directing a pre-determined\npayment stream from the customers of the borrower to a special account maintained\nwith a designated agent. Payment / deposit by the user / buyer into such an account is\nassumed to be a valid discharge of his liability to the supplier of the goods / services.\nAn Escrow arrangement involves parties different from the parties in a TRA\nmechanism. The Escrow arrangement would involve usually four parties: the lender,\nthe borrower, the customers of the borrower and the Escrow Agent. The mandate to\nthe Escrow Agent would normally be finalised by the lenders in consultation with the\nborrower and its customers.\n5.Thus, for instance, in financing of a power plant which sel ls its power\ngenerated to a SEB, the Escrow arrangement would involve the power producer\n(borrower), the SEB concerned (customer), the bank / FI (lenders) and the Escrow\nAgent (a designated bank). The SEB would agree to direct its collection centres to\ndeposit the electricity charges received from retail consumers, into a designated\naccount with the designated bank (Escrow agent) and to direct its bulk consumers to\ndeposit their payments directly with the Escrow Agent in the specified account. The\nEscrow Agent would then appropriate the funds in the Escrow account as per the\npriority laid down in the Escrow Agreement.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/19520.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Mar 08, 2001", "info": "Normal Transit Period (NTP) for exports\nto Iraq under U.N.Guidelines\nIECD.No.12/04.02.02/2000-01\nMarch 7, 2001\nThe Chairmen/Chief Executives\n of all commercial banks\nDear Sir,\nNormal Transit Period (NTP) for exports\nto Iraq under U.N.Guidelines\n-----------------------------------------------\nPlease refer to our circular IECD.No.21/04.02.02/98-99 dated March 8, 1999\nadvising the banks to extend concessional rate of interest in respect of exports to Iraq\nunder UN guidelines for a maximum period of 60 days.\nIn view of the difficulties being experienced by the exporters in realising export\nproceeds in time, the issue has been re-examined in consultation with Foreign Exchange\nDealers' Association of India (FEDAI) and they have enhanced the NTP to a maximum\nof 90 days from the date of shipment for such exports by duly amending the relevant rule\nvide their AR Circular No.01/2001 dated February 2, 2001 (copy enclosed).

The description of the priority sectors was later\nformalised in 1972 on the basis of the report submitted by the Informal Study Group on\nStatistics relating to advances to the Priority Sectors constituted by the Reserve Bank in May\n1971. On the basis of this report, the Reserve Bank prescribed a modified return for reporting\npriority sector advances and certain guidelines were issued in this connection indicating the\nscope of the items to be included under the various categories of priority sectors. Although\ninitially there was no specific targets fixed in respect of priority sector lending, in November\n1974 the banks were advised to raise the share of these sectors in their aggregate advances to\nthe level of 331/ 3  percent by March 1979.\nAt a meeting of the Union Finance Minister with the Chief Executive Officers of public sector\nbanks held in March 1980, it was agreed that banks should aim at raising the proportion of\ntheir advances to priority sectors to 40 percent by March 1985. Subsequently, on the basis of\nthe recommendations of the Working Group on the Modalities of Implementation of Priority\nSector Lending and the Twenty Point Economic Programme by Banks, all commercial banks\nwere advised to achieve the target of priority sector lending at 40 percent of aggregate bank\nadvances by 1985.

MAIN TARGETS FOR ALL SCHEDULED COMMERCIAL BANKS EXCLUDING\nFOREIGN BANKS\n1.1 The scheduled commercial banks are expected to enlarge credit to priority sector\nand ensure that priority sector advances constitute 40 percent of net bank credit and that\na substantial portion is directed to the weaker sections.\n1.2 Within the overall main lending target of 40 percent of net bank credit, it should be\nensured that:\n(i) 18 percent of net bank credit goes to agricultural sector,\n(ii) 10 percent of net bank credit is given to the \u2018weaker sections\u2019\nand\n(iii) 1 percent of previous year\u2019s net bank credit is given under the\nDifferential Rate of Interest (DRI) scheme.\n2. SUB-TARGETS FOR ALL SCHEDULED COMMERCIAL BANKS EXCLUDING\nFOREIGN BANKS\n2.1  Direct/Indirect Agricultural Lending\n(i) Taking into consideration the fact that ultimate objective of\nagricultural credit whether 'direct' or 'indirect' is to help the\nagricultural production, the lendings under the 'direct' and\n'indirect' categories of agricultural advances will be clubbed for\nthe purpose of computing performance of banks vis-\u00e0-vis the\nsub-target of 18 percent.\n(ii) however, to ensure that the focus of the banks on the direct\ncategory of agricultural advances does not get diluted; the\nlendings under the indirect category should not exceed one-\nfourth of the agricultural sub-target of 18 percent, i.e. 4.5\npercent of net bank credit.\n(iii) Advances under the 'indirect' category in excess of 4.5 percent\nof net bank credit would not be reckoned in computing\nperformance under the sub-target of 18 percent. However, all\nagricultural advances under the categories 'direct' and 'indirect'\nwill be reckoned in computing performance under the overall\npriority sector target of 40 percent of the net bank credit.\n2.2  Small Scale Industries\nIn order to ensure that credit is available to all segments of the SSI\nsector, banks should ensure that -\n(a) 40 percent of the total credit to small scale industry goes to\nthe cottage industries, khadi & village industries, artisans15and tiny industries with investment in plant and machinery\nupto Rs. 5 lacs;\n(b) 20 percent of the total credit to small scale industry goes to\nSSI units with investment in plant and machinery between\nRs. 5 lakhs and Rs. 25 lakhs; and\n(c) the remaining 40 percent goes to other SSI units with\ninvestment exceeding Rs. 25 lakhs.\n2.3  DRI Advances\n(i) It should be ensured that not less than 40 percent of the total\nadvances granted under DRI scheme go to scheduled caste/scheduled\ntribes.\n(ii) At least two third i.e. 662/3 percent of DRI advances should be\ngranted through rural and semi-urban branches.\nUnder the DRI Scheme, financial assistance is provided at\nconcessional rate of interest (4 percent per annum) to selected low\nincome groups, for productive endeavours.\n2.4  Weaker Sections\n(i) In order to ensure that more under-privileged sections in the priority\nsector are given proper attention in the matter of allocation of credit, it\nshould be ensured that the advances to the weaker sections reach a level\nof 25 percent  of priority sector advances or 10 percent of net bank\ncredit.\n(ii) The weaker sections under priority sector include the following:\n(a) Small and marginal farmers with land holding of 5 acres and less\nand landless labourers, tenant farmers and share croppers.\n(b) Artisans, village and cottage industries where individual credit\nlimits do not exceed Rs. 25,000/-\n(c) Beneficiaries of Swarnjayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY)\n(d) Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\n(e) Beneficiaries of Differential Rate of Interest (DRI) scheme\n(f) Beneficiaries under Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rojgar Yojana\n(SJSRY)\n(g) Beneficiaries under the Scheme for Liberation and Rehabilitation of\nScavangers (SLRS).\n(h) Advances to Self Help Groups\n3. TARGETS FOR FOREIGN BANKS\n3.1.1 With a view to reducing the disparity between the domestic banks and the\nforeign banks operating in India in regard to their priority sector obligations the16minimum lending to priority sector by the foreign banks shall be 32 percent of\ntheir net credit.\n3.1.2 However, keeping in view that the foreign banks have no rural branch\nnetwork, the composition of priority sector advances in their case will be\ninclusive of export credit provided by them.\n3.1.3 Within the overall target of 32 percent to be achieved by foreign banks,\nthe advances to small scale industries sector should not be less than 10 percent\nof the net bank credit and the export credit should not be less than 12 percent of\nthe net bank credit.\n[The net bank credit should tally with the figures reported in the fortnightly return\nsubmitted under section 42(2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.]\n4.       DEPOSIT BY FOREIGN BANKS WITH SIDBI TOWARDS SHORTFALL IN\nPRIORITY SECTOR LENDING\n4.1In the event of failure to attain the stipulated targets and sub-targets, the\nforeign banks will be required to make good the shortfall in the\nachievement of the targets / sub-targets by depositing for a period of one\nyear, an amount equivalent to the shortfall with the Small Industries\nDevelopment Bank of India (SIDBI) at the interest rate of 8 percent per\nannum or as may be decided by the Reserve Bank from time to time.\n4.2The shortfall in achieving the priority sector lending target ad the sub-\ntargets should be computed as on the last reporting Friday of March\nevery year and made good by placing a deposit with SIDBI as stated\nabove. The deposits should be placed before the end of April of that\nyear.\n4.3In regard to the above, it is t o be clarified that in the event of failure on\nthe part of foreign banks to achieve any of the stipulated sub-targets in\nrespect of advances to SSI sector and export credit, even if they achieve\nthe overall target of 32 percent, the shortfall should be made good by\nplacing with SIDBI a deposit of an amount equivalent to the shortfall in\neach of the sub-targets. Also, in the event of failure on the part of banks\nto achieve one of the sub-targets or both the sub-targets, and also the\noverall target of 32 percent, the shortfall in achieving the sub-targets and\nthe overall target should be made good by placing with SIDBI a deposit\nof an amount equivalent to ( i) aggregate shortfall in the sub-targets, or\n(ii) the shortfall in the overall target, whichever shortfall is higher. In\ncase the shortfall is in achievement of the overall target only and not in\nthe sub-target, banks should make good the shortfall in achieving the\noverall target.\n4.4The outstanding balances of these deposits placed with SIDBI may be\nreckoned as part of their priority sector advances during the currency of\nthe deposits, as indirect finance to SSIs. The amount of deposits should,\nhowever, be shown separately in the returns on priority sector advances\nsubmitted to RBI.175.CONTRIBUTION BY B ANKS TO RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE\nDEVELOPMENT FUND (RIDF)\nDomestic scheduled commercial banks having shortfall in lending to priority\nsector / agriculture are allocated amounts for contribution to the Rural\nInfrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) established in NABARD. Details\nregarding operationalisation of the RIDF such as the amounts to be deposited by\nbanks, interest rates on deposits, period of deposits etc., are decided every year\nafter announcement in the Union Budget about setting up of RIDF. The\ncontributions to be made by banks are communicated to the banks concerned\nseparately.\nSECTION IV\nCOMMON GUIDELINES FOR PRIORITY SECTOR ADVANCES\n1. Based on the recommendations made by the working groups and high powered committees\nappointed by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank, a set of comprehensive\nguidelines to be followed for advances to all categories of borrowers in the priority sector were\nevolved. These guidelines are detailed in the subsequent paragraphs. Banks should follow these\ncommon guidelines prescribed by the Reserve Bank for all categories of advances under the\npriority sector .\n2. PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS\n2.1 Completion of Application Forms\nIn areas covered by special schemes such as SGSY, the concerned project\nauthorities like DRDAs, DICs etc. should arrange for completion of application\nforms received from borrowers. In other areas, the bank staff should help the\nborrowers for this purpose.\n2.2 Issue of Acknowledgement of Loan Applications\nBanks should give acknowledgement for loan applications received from\nweaker sections. Towards this purpose, while getting fresh stocks of application\nforms printed, it may be ensured that these forms have perforated portion for\nacknowledgement to be completed and issued by the receiving branch. Each\nbranch may affix on the main application form as well as the corresponding\nportion for acknowledgement, a running serial number. While using the existing\nstock of application forms till then, an acknowledgement (separately prepared)\nshould be given for each application, care being taken to ensure that the serial\nnumber given on the acknowledgement is also recorded on the main application.\n2.3 Disposal of Applications\nAll loan applications upto a credit limit of Rs. 25,000/- should be disposed of\nwithin a fortnight and those for over Rs. 25,000/-, within 8 to 9 weeks.\n2.4 Rejection of Proposals18Branch Managers may reject applications (except in respect of SC/ST) provided\nthe cases of rejection are verified subsequently by the Divisional/Regional\nManagers. In the case of proposals from SC/ST, rejection should be at a level\nhigher than that of Branch Manager.\n2.5 Register of Rejected Applications\nA register should be maintained at branch wherein the date of receipt,\nsanction/rejection/disbursement with reasons therefor etc., should be recorded.\nThe register should be made available to all inspecting agencies.\n3. MODE OF DISBURSEMENT OF LOAN\nAs far as possible, disbursement of loan amounts sanctioned should be made directly to\nthe suppliers of inputs such as seeds, fertilisers, raw materials, implements, trucks,\nmachinery, etc.\n4. REPAYMENT SCHEDULE\n4.1 Repayment programme should be fixed taking into account the sustenance\nrequirements, surplus generating capacity, the break-even point, the life of the asset,\netc., and not in an \"ad hoc\" manner.

Banks should formulate suitable internal\nguidelines duly approved by the Board of Directors and on that basis, the guarantee fee\nmay be charged to the borrowers.\n6. RATES OF INTEREST\nThe rates of interest on various categories of priority sector advances will be as\nper RBI directives issued from time to time.\n7. PENAL INTEREST\n7.1.1 The policy of levying penal rates should be implemented with\ndiscrimination and selectivity. In order to avoid indiscriminate levy of penal\nrate, the decisions on penal rate should be taken at a fairly higher level in each\nbank.\n7.1.2 No penal interest should be charged for loans upto Rs. 25,000/-.\n7.1.3 For limits over Rs. 25,000/- the aggregate penal/additional interest should\nnot exceed 2 percent over and above the rate of interest applicable/normally\ncharged to the borrowers.\n8.

These\ncharges should, however, not exceed Rs. 10 per year per borrower.\n8.1.3 For loans above Rs. 25,000/- reasonable inspection charges may be levied;\ncare should, however, be taken to see that the inspection charges on advances to\nthe weaker sections in the priority sector are lower than the rates framed for\nsuch inspection in other cases.\n9. INSURANCE AGAINST FIRE AND OTHER RISKS\n9.1.1 Banks may waive insurance of assets financed by bank credit in the\nfollowing cases:\nNo. Category Type of\nRiskType of Assets\n(a)All categories of priority\nsector advances upto and\ninclusive of Rs. 10,000/-Fire & other\nrisksEquipment and\ncurrent assets\n(b)Advances to SSI sector\nupto and inclusive of Rs.\n25,000/- by way of -20\u2022 Composite loans to\nartisans, village and\ncottage industriesFire Equipment and\ncurrent assets\n\u2022 All term loans Fire Equipment\n\u2022 Working capital where\nthese are against non-\nhazardous goodsFire Current Assets\n9.1.2 Where, however, insurance of vehicle or machinery or other\nequipment/assets is compulsory under the provisions of any law or where such\na requirement is stipulated in the refinance scheme of any refinancing agency\nor as part of a Government-sponsored programmes such as, IRDP (since\nreplaced by SGSY), insurance should not be waived even if the relative credit\nfacility does not exceed Rs. 10,000/- or Rs. 25,000/-, as the case may be.\n10. OTHER CHARGES\nBanks should not levy any other service charges except by way of reimbursement of\nreasonable out of pocket expenses.\n11. PHOTOGRAPHS OF BORROWERS\nWhile there is no objection to taking photographs of the borrowers, for purposes of\nidentification, banks themselves should make arrangements for the photographs and also\nbear the cost of photographs of borrowers falling in the category of Weaker Sections. It\nshould also be ensured that the procedure does not involve any delay in loan disbursement.\n12. DISCRETIONARY POWERS\nAll Branch Managers of banks should be vested with discretionary powers to sanction\nproposals from weaker sections without reference to any higher authority.

To provide relief to the affected\nexporters, it has been decided to extend the following concessions:\n(i) Extension of pre-shipment credit\nIn cases where shipment  is likely to be delayed beyond the specified time due to\nthe calamity banks may, after satisfying themselves of the genuineness of the case ,\nextend upto 180 days, pre-shipment credit granted for periods less than 180 days (based\non the production cycle), at the interest rate applicable for the period upto 180 days (10\nper cent per annum)  and for the period beyond 180 days and upto 360 days banks may\ncharge the concessional rate applicable for the period beyond 180 days and upto 270\ndays, (13 per cent per annum).  Extension of credit beyond 360 days may also be\nconsidered, where necessary, on  the  basis  of bank's commercial judgement and\ndiscretion  at the rate applicable for `ECNOS-Pre shipment'  and with the approval of the\nbank's Board.\nIn cases where the pre-shipment credit has been granted in foreign currency,\nextension  beyond  180  days may be allowed as per the actual cost of roll-over instead of\napplying 2 per cent over the rate charged for the period upto 180 days as per extant\ninstructions.\n(ii) Conversion of dues into\n     short term loans\n Banks may convert the overdue pre-shipment credit, wherever considered\nnecessary, into a short term loan repayable within a reasonable period of time after taking\ninto account the settlement of ECGC claim, if any, in respect of guarantees taken by the\nbank.

We have examined the accounting\nissues in consultation with the Institute of Chartered Accountant of India (ICAI) and the\naccounting treatment of VRS expenditure is given below.\n2. The VRS related expenditure will comprise of:\n i. Ex-gratia payment of a sum equal to 2 months pay for every year of service\nrendered or pay for the remaining period of service, whichever is less and\n ii. Termination benefits like gratuity, pension / provident fund, commutation of\npension, encashment of accumulated leave, cost of reimbursement of travel and\ntransportation at the time of retirement, etc.\n2.1 Ex-gratia Payment\nThe bank is required to recognise the liability in respect of VRS ex- gratia payment in the\naccounting year in which the decision to accept the VRS of an employee is taken and\ncommunicated to him / her.  Unless expensed in the same period, the entire ex- gratia\namount as a result of VRS, can be treated as an extra-ordinary item and as Deferred\nRevenue Expenditure.\n2.2 Termination Benefits\nAs regards termination benefits in respect of VRS employees, banks should normally\nhave made provision on actuarial basis.  However, in view of the early retirement under\nthe VRS, it is possible that the amount of termination benefits payable may be more than\nthe provision made in this respect in the past for that employee.  The excess of2\ntermination benefits payable over the provision held in this regard, unless expensed in the\nsame year, can be treated as an extra-ordinary item and Deferred Revenue Expenditure.\n2.3 Period of Deferment\nThe period of deferment would be restricted to a maximum of 5 years including the year\nof acceptance of VRS application by a bank.\n2.4  Leave Encashment Expenditure\nIn respect of encashment of leave salary and similar other expenditure, most banks have\nnot made the provision on an actuarial basis and have treated the same on a cash basis.  In\nthat event any payment made for encashment of leave salary for employees who have\nopted for VRS must be treated as an expenditure for the year and cannot be treated as\nDeferred Revenue Expenditure.\nIf any bank has provided for encashment of leave salary on an actuarial basis or chooses\nto provide for it on an actuarial basis, the excess of the payment over the actuarial\nliability provided can be treated as Deferred Revenue Expenditure and amortised over a\nperiod not exceeding five years.\n2.5 Allocation of Expenditure\nWhile allocating the Deferred Revenue Expenditure, it should be recognised that the tax\nbenefits for the whole expenditure will arise in the first year itself.  Therefore, the basis of\nallocation should be as under:\n(i) for the first year the charge should be equal to the sum of the tax benefit\nobtained + 1/5th of the balance\n(ii) in each of the other 4 years, the charge should be equal to 1/5th of the net\namount i.e. the gross amount less the tax benefit obtained for the first year.\nAn illustrative example is given in the Annexure.\n2.6  Disclosure\nThe Board of Directors of a bank must disclose the accounting policies              followed\nin respect of VRS expenditure.  If VRS applications were accepted subsequent to the\nclosure of the accounting year, the Board of Directors would be required to make a\ndisclosure in the Board Report of that fact and of the likely impact of the VRS.\n3.  Regulatory Issues3\n3.1 Banks have also approached us that the VRS related Deferred Revenue Expenditure\nmay not be reduced from Tier I capital.  We have examined the issue and advise that in\nview of the extra-ordinary nature of the event, VRS related Deferred Revenue\nExpenditure would not be reduced from Tier I capital.  The position will stand\nregularized by the end of the accounting year in which the deferred expenses are totally\nwiped out.\n3.2 Some banks have proposed to meet the VRS related expenditure partly on cash basis\nand the other part in the form of bonds and requested us to treat the bond as subordinated\ndebt counting for Tier II capital.  It is advised that the bonds to be issued to the VRS\nemployees as compensation package, net of the unamortised  Deferred Revenue\nExpenditure, could be treated as Tier II capital, subject to compliance with the terms and\nconditions stipulated in our circular No.DBOD.BP.BC.5 /21.01.002/98-99 dated 8\nFebruary 1999 for issue of such bonds.\nYours faithfully,\n(A. Ghosh)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge4\nAnnexure\nRecognition of Tax Benefit for Allocation of Expenditure - Example\nIf the Deferred Revenue Expenditure is 100 and spread over five years, taking into\naccount the tax savings, the amount to be charged off in each year should be as under:\nYear Gross charge Tax saving Net charge\n2000-2001 38.5 38.5 --\n12.3 --- 12.3\n50.8 38.5 12.3\n2001-2002 12.3 -- 12.3\n2002-2003 12.3 -- 12.3\n2003-2004 12.3 -- 12.3\n2004-2005 12.3 -- 12.3\n100.0 38.5 61.5\n If a bank does not have adequate taxable income to fully absorb the deduction for VRS\nin the 1st year, the charge in the 1st year may be lower and in later years higher than in the\nabove example.

The matter was\nexamined in detail by the Committee of Secretaries [ COS]. Consequent to that, the\nMinistry of Finance, Banking Division has prepared a report in consultation with various\nGovernment and Non-Government agencies, Reserve Bank of India and public sector\nbanks, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Small Industries\nDevelopment Bank of India, Ministry of SSI & ARI and the Department of Women and\nChild Development on how to more fully meet the credit needs of women particularly in\nthe tiny and SSI sectors within the existing institutional framework. The Report contained\nan Action Plan to be implemented by public sector banks. The meeting of the Committee\nof Secretaries held on 14 September 2000 has recommended the Action Plan to\nGovernment which has since accepted the same.\nAs desired by Government we forward herewith a copy of the Report containing the\nAction Plan to be implemented by public sector banks. You are requested to take\nappropriate action for implementation of Action points 1 to 13 of the Action Plan. Kindly\nadvise the Banking Division, Government of India the steps taken/progress made in\nimplementing every action point on a quarterly basis commencing from the quarter ended\nMarch 2001. The progress report to Banking Division may be sent within one month of the\nend of each quarter with copy to us.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n[A.V.Sardesai]\nChief General Manager\nEncls :Copy of the Report [Action Plan only]\nACTION PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION BY BANKS\nThe strategy for increasing women's access to the formal financial sector should be a long\nterm goal with flexibility to adapt to local needs and situations. This will help build up an\neffective and efficient financial intervention. Besides, attitudinal change of society and\nremoval of unequal inheritance laws and practices could enable women to exercise\nproperty\" rights and have a better standing in the society. The following action points are\nrequired to be taken up by banks in order to reach potential women entrepreneurs and\nencourage them to avail credit and credit plus services from banks :-(1) Redefining of Banks' policies / Long term plans\n(i)Banks should redefine its policies by taking into ac count women's requirements in\na focused and integrated manner.\n(ii) Banks should have a Charter for women which must be published. They should\nprepare long term plans and within that area plans with a view to outreach credit to\nwomen. To start with, banks should earmark at least 2 per cent of their net bank credit for\nwomen and raise it to 5 per cent in 5 years time. For this purpose, they may take into\naccount credit extended to women directly for smaller projects; credit under different\nschemes of banks/Government sponsored schemes and credit to companies where majority\nof the promoters shares are held by women; partnership firms where majority partners are\nwomen and proprietary concerns where proprietors are women.\n(iii) Banks must ensure that the b enefits under various poverty alleviation and\nemployment promotion schemes go to the women in the prescribed ratio.\n(2) Setting up women cells\n(i) Women's cells should be set up at the banks' head office as well as in their regional\noffices where information, counseling/guidance and other credit related services for\nwomen entrepreneurs are readily available. The cell at the head office should function\nunder the Executive Director of the Bank. The cell should preferably be handled by women\nofficers/staff and act as data collecting center for information about women entrepreneurs\nand for monitoring the status of applications received and extent of credit disbursed. The\ncell should also disseminate information to women entrepreneurs about various credit\nrelated schemes and facilities available with the bank particularly for self employment.\n(ii) At the branch level, or clusters of branches in rural areas, the bank should have a\ndesk visibly placed in order to provide women with relevant information and guide/assist\nthem in making loan applications etc. As far as possible the desk should be handled by a\nwell trained lady staff member particularly in rural areas.\n(iii) Special attention should be given to women in every branch. One officer in each\nbranch should be designated exclusively for dealing with cases of flow of credit to women.\nBanks should have a target for covering at least 20 women per branch for lending and 20\nfor training.\n(3) Simplification of procedural formalities\nThe application forms, appraisal standards and other procedural requirements for extending\nfinance to women entrepreneurs should be simplified as far as possible. Banks should\nensure that the managerial staff assist women entrepreneurs in understanding the banks'\nprocedural formalities in a simple manner. They should also give assistance in the\npreparation of project reports and completion of other paper work.\n(4) Orientation of Bank officers/staff on\ngender concerns/credit requirements of women\n(i) Banks should take  appropriate measures to ensure that the branch level\nfunctionaries do not have traditional bias of preferring men to women in financing. For thispurpose the bank staff should be oriented through short term training programmes in which\na special component on gender concerns can be incorporated.\n(ii) Banks should also organize workshops of two-three days duration for its branch\nmanagers/staff on different aspects of handling credit requirements of women. Banks\nshould also invite members of Non- Government Organisations ( NGOs) or women social\nworkers to these workshops for active interaction so that the problems being faced by the\nwomen entrepreneurs could be better understood by bank staff in an informal manner.\n(5)Pubticitv campaian for creatina awareness about credit facilities\n(i)Banks should launch Awareness Programmes/Publicity Campaigns about schemes\navailable for women. Attractive publicity material such as posters, charts, can be specially\ndesigned in a simple manner so that women are able to understand it easily. The publicity\nmaterial should be available in different languages and should be widely distributed\nparticularly in rural and semi-urban areas. Gender concerns should also be addressed\nthrough publicity material viz. slogans on hoardings/bus shelters etc.\n(ii)For the large numbers of illiterate and semi-literate women, particularly in the rural\nand semi-urban areas, the banks should make efforts to inform them through audio-visual\nmethods/slides and charts about the different schemes under which finance is available.\nBanks should establish contact with the. village panchayats to seek their assistance in\ndissemination/distribution of information material to women in the village and for delivery\nof credit to identified women.\n(iii)Banks can also explore the possibility of using the local radio and the television\nnetwork for disseminating information to women in the farthest corners of the country.\n(iv) Banks should interact with schools/colleges/universities for publicizing scheme s\nand programmes for women.\n(v)In the present computer age, banks should make use of creating web- sites through\nwhich wider publicity could be given about various schemes/credit facilities available with\nthe bank for women entrepreneurs. This would help all sections of the society to have easy\naccess to such information particularly the young, educated urban women who are using\ncomputers.\n(6)Entrepreneurship Development Programmes/Training facilities for Women\n(i) Banks should organize entrepreneurship development programmes exclusively for\nwomen entrepreneurs. For this purpose the banks can contact various Entrepreneurship\nDevelopment Institutes in the country and develop appropriate programmes for women in\nthe urban and rural areas.\n(ii)Banks should finance training courses for women, particularly in the area of\ninformation technology.\n(iii) There is a need for more training institutes particularly in the rural areas to cater to\nthe training requirements/skill upgradation of rural women\n(iv)During school/college vacations banks should involve teachers/students in training\nprogrammes for women(v) Government organizations should give preference to purchase of goods made by\nwomen entrepreneurs\n(7)Specialised branches for women\n(i) Banks should make concerted efforts to open specialized branches in identified\nareas for financing women entrepreneurs on the lines of 881 branches or Agricultural\nFinance branches. The specialized branches should cater exclusively and at least\npredominantly to the requirements of women entrepreneurs in an integrated manner. Apart\nfrom the other banking functions, these branches could act as a Centre for women which\noffers inter alia, facilities like a small library, credit related counseling and guidance\nservices and information about various schemes. The branch should be fully computerized\nand may also collect information about schemes/ programmes available for women in other\nbanks and organizations so that women coming to one branch can have access to\ninformation about schemes in other banks as well.\n(ii)Over the next one year, at least one specialized branch for women would \" be\nopened in every district of the country. RBI will proportionally allocate the numbers of\nsuch branches to be opened by each bank.\n(8) Motivational strategies to enthuse bank officials/staff\nBanks should use motivational strategies to enthuse their managers/staff to achieve targets\nfor women. Their work in this area should be given appropriate recognition. Banks can\ngive annual awards to the 3 best performing branches in achieving targets plus providing\ncredit related services to women.\n(9) Monitoring system\nA monitoring system should be in place for submitting regular reports on the credit flow to\nwomen. It should be an item on the calendar for Review being submitted to the Board of\nDirectors of the bank. RBI should also monitor and give suitable directions to banks from\ntime to time.\n(10) Data collection\nSeparate data about credit flow to women is not presently available. Data should be\ngenerated by banks and quarterly reports submitted to RBI who should process the\ninformation and create a separate data base for women. Data for women should be\ncollected separately for amounts advanced through micro-credit, credit to small scale\nindustries and credit to medium/large industries. RBI should also assess the extent of\nfinancial assistance given to women in the last 2-3 years, latest by September, 2000.\n(11 )Strenathenina of existina schemes\n(i) There should be greater int eraction between NABARD/SIDBI and banks. Existing\nschemes and programmes being implemented by them should be further strengthened both\nin terms of coverage as well as volume of credit. Other facilities offered under these\nschemes eg. Training/orientation should also get more attention.\n(ii) There is no direct alliance between SIDBI and banks. SIDBI should explore the\npossibility of having a tie-up with banks for women's schemes.(12) Increasing the limit for non- obtention\nof collateral security\n(i) Banks insistence on collateral/securities is a major impediment in borrowing by\nwomen. Banks should therefore implement the recent measures taken by Government /\nRBI for increasing the limit for non- obtention of collateral security from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.5\nlakh. Banks may also consider whether loans beyond Rs.5 lakhs i.e. at least upto Rs.10\nlakhs could be offered without collateral.\n(ii) Banks should encourage women entrepreneurs to avail loans on liberal terms like\nminimum margin money.

NABARD and SIDBI are already involving the Women's\nself help groups for reaching out to women entrepreneurs. Banks can also. take initiative in\nworking out viable strategies to work with more Self Help Groups ( SHGs) and women's\ncooperatives and fix a yearly target for lending to SHGs.\n14) Mahila Rural Co-operative Banks\nMahila Rural Cooperative Banks on the lines of Mahila Urban Cooperative banks should\nbe set up for assisting women in the semi-urban and rural areas.
