With a view to further \nenhance the ease of doing business and quicken the approval process, it has been decided to delegate more powers to the Authorised Dealer Category \u2013 I banks (AD banks) in the following areas: \n 1. Direct Dispatch of Shipping Documents   1.1 In terms of Paragraph 2 of A. P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 6 dated August 13, 2008\n, AD \nbanks have been allowed to regularise cases of dispatch of shipping documents by the exporter direct to the consignee or his agent resident in the country of the final destination of goods, up to USD 1 million or its equivalent per export shipment. \n 1.2 With a view to simplify the procedure, it has been decided to do away with the limit of USD 1 million per export shipment.    1.3 Accordingly, AD banks may regularize such direct dispatch of shipping documents irrespective of the value of export shipment, subject to following conditions:  \na) The export proceeds have been realized in full except for the amount written off, if \nany, in accordance with the extant provisions for write off.  \nb) The exporter is a regular customer of AD bank for a period of at least  six months. \nc) The exporter\u2019s account with the AD bank is fully compliant with Reserve Bank\u2019s \nextant KYC / AML guidelines. \nd) The AD bank is satisfied about the bonafides of the transaction.  \n 2. \u201cWrite-off\u201d of unrealized Export bills  2.1 Attention is invited to A.P. (DIR. Series) Circular No.  88 dated March 12, 2013\n on \u201cwrite-\noff\u201d of unrealized export bills. To provide greater flexibility to the AD banks  and to reduce the time taken for according such approvals, the extant procedure is revised as under:  \n   Particulars Limit Limit (%) In relation to \nSelf-write-off by an exporter  (Other than the Status Holder Exporter) 5% Total export proceeds \nrealized during the \ncalendar year preceding \nthe year in which the \nwrite-off is being done Self-write-off by Status Holder Exporter 10% \nWrite-off by AD Category-1 Bank 10% \n \n2.2 The above limits of self-write-off and write-off by the AD bank shall be reckoned cumulatively and shall be available subject to the following conditions:  a) The relevant amount has remained outstanding for more than one year;  b) Satisfactory documentary evidence is furnished indicating that  the exporter had made all efforts to realise the export proceeds; c) The exporter is a regular customer of the bank for a period of at least 6 months, is fully compliant with KYC/AML guidelines and AD Bank is satisfied with the bonafides of the transaction.  d) The case falls under any of the undernoted categories :  i) The overseas buyer has been declared insolvent and a certificate from the official liquidator, indicating that there is no possibility of recovery of export proceeds, has been produced. ii) The unrealized amount represents the balance due in a case settled through the intervention of the Indian Embassy, Foreign Chamber of Commerce or similar Organization; iii) The goods exported have been auctioned or destroyed by the Port / Customs / Health authorities in the importing country; iv) The overseas buyer is not traceable over a reasonably long period of time.  v) The unrealized amount represents the undrawn balance of an export bill (not exceeding 10% of the invoice value) remaining outstanding that turned out to be unrealizable despite all efforts made by the exporter; vi) The cost of resorting to legal action would be disproportionate to the unrealized amount of the export bill or where the exporter even after winning the Court case against the overseas buyer could not execute the Court decree due to reasons beyond his control; vii)  Bills were drawn for the difference between the letter of credit value and actual export value or between the provisional and the actual freight charges but the amounts have remained unrealized consequent to dishonor of the bills by the overseas buyer with no prospects of realization. 2.3 Notwithstanding anything contained in para 2.1 and 2.2 above, the AD bank may, on request of the exporter, write-off unrealised export bills without any limit in respect of cases falling under any of the categories specified at 2.2 (d) (i), (ii) and (iii) above provided AD bank is satisfied with the documentary evidence produced.   2.4 AD banks may also permit write-off of outstanding amount of export bills up to the specified ceilings indicated in para 2.1 above, where the documents have been directly dispatched by the exporter to the consignee or his agent resident in the country of final destination of goods if the case falls under any of the categories specified at 2.2 (d) (i), (ii) and (iii) above.  2.5 The AD bank shall ensure that the exporter seeking write-off has submitted documentary evidence towards surrendering of proportionate export incentives, if any, availed of in respect of the relative export bill.  2.6 In case of self-write off, the AD bank shall obtain from the exporter, a certificate from Chartered Accountant indicating the export realization in the preceding calendar year and details of the amount of write-off, if any, already availed of during the current calendar year along with the requisite details of the EDF/Export Bill under the write-off request. The certificate shall also indicate that the export incentives, if any, availed by the exporter have been surrendered. 2.7 The following cases, however, would not qualify for the \u201cwrite-off\u201d facility: a. Exports made to countries with externalization problem i.e. where the overseas buyer has deposited the value of export in local currency but the amount has not been allowed to be repatriated by the Central Bank authorities of the country  concerned.  b. EDF/Softex which are under investigation by agencies like, Enforcement Directorate, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Bureau of Investigation, etc. as also the outstanding bills which are subject matter of civil / criminal suit.  2.8 AD banks shall report write-off of export bills in Export Data Processing and Monitoring System (EDPMS).  2.9 AD banks shall put in place a system to carry out random check / percentage check of the export bills so written-off by their internal Inspectors/Auditors (including external Auditors). 2.10 Requests of write-off not covered under the above instructions may be referred to the Regional Office concerned of the Reserve Bank.  3.

Currently, RBI grants authorisation to new entities desirous of operating a payment \nsystem for specified periods up to five years. Similar approach is adopted for renewal of \nvalidity of authorisation to existing entities. To reduce licensing uncertainties and enable PSOs \nto focus on their business as also to optimise utilisation of regulatory resources, it has been \ndecided to, hereafter, grant authorisation for all PSOs (both new and existing) on a perpet ual \nbasis, subject to the usual conditions. \n  \n3. For existing authorised PSOs, grant of perpetual validity shall be examined as and \nwhen the CoA becomes due for renewal subject to their adherence to the following:  \na) Full compliance with the terms and conditions subject to which authorisation was \ngranted; \nb) Fulfilment of entry norms such as capital, networth requirements, etc.;  \nc) No major regulatory or supervisory concerns related to operations of the PSO, as \nobserved during onsite and / or offsite monitoring; \nd) Efficacy of customer grievance redressal mechanism;  \ne) No adverse reports from other departments of RBI / regulators / statutory bodies, etc.  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n4. Existing PSOs who do not satisfy all conditions will be given one- year renewals to \nenable them to comply; if any entity fails to do so in a reasonable time, its authorisation may \nbe withdrawn.  \n \n5. If an entity becomes non-compliant with any of the conditions of authorisation, RBI \nmay undertake action as deemed fit under the provisions of PSS Act, including imposition of \nrestrictions on payment system operations and / or revocation of CoA.  \n 6.

The arrangement entailed joint contribution of credit at the facility level by both  the lenders as also sharing of risks and rewards. \n 2. Based on the feedback received from the stakeholders and to better leverage the respective comparative advantages of the banks and NBFCs in a collaborative effort , it has been decided to provide greater operational flexibility to the lending institutions, while requiring them to conform to the regulatory guidelines on outsourcing, KYC, etc. The primary focus of the revised scheme, rechristened as \u201cCo-Lending Model\u201d (CLM), is to improve the flow of credit to the unserved and underserved sector of the economy and make available funds to the ultimate beneficiary at an affordable cost, considering the lower cost of funds from banks and greater reach of the NBFCs. Detailed features of the CLM are furnished in the Annex.\n \n 3. In terms of the CLM, banks are permitted to co-lend with all registered NBFCs (including HFCs) based on a prior agreement. The co-lending banks will take their  share of the individual loans on a back-to-back basis in their books. However, NBFCs shall be required to retain a minimum of 20 per cent share of the individual loans on their books.

The banks and NBFCs shall formulate Board approved policies for entering into the CLM and place the approved policies on their websites.  Based on their  Board approved policies, a Master Agreement may be entered into between the two partner institutions which shall inter-alia include, terms and conditions of the arrangement, the criteria for selection of partner institutions, the specific product lines and areas of operation, along with provisions related to segregation of responsibilities as well as customer interface and protection issues, as detailed in the Annex\n. \n 5. The Master Agreement may provide for the banks to either mandatorily take  their share of the individual loans originated by the NBFCs in their books as per the terms of the agreement, or to retain the discretion to reject certain loans after their due diligence prior to taking in their books, subject to the conditions specified in the Annex.\n \n 6. The banks can claim priority sector status in respect of their share of credit while engaging in the CLM adhering to the specified conditions.   7. The CLM shall not be applicable to foreign banks (including WOS) with less than 20 branches.   8. This circular supersedes the \ncircular FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.08/04.09.01/2018-19 dated \nSeptember 21, 2018.  However, outstanding loans in terms of the circular ibid would \ncontinue to be classified under priority sector till their repayment or maturity, whichever is earlier. \n \nYours faithfully, \n  (Gautam Prasad Borah) Chief General Manager-in-Charge \n ANNEX \n Essential Features of Co-Lending Model between Banks and NBFCs   I.  Scope   1. The Master Agreement entered into by the banks and NBFCs for implementing the CLM may provide either for the bank to mandatorily take their share of the individual loans as originated by the NBFC in their books or retain the discretion to reject certain loans subject to its due diligence. \n \na. If the Agreement entails a prior, irrevocable commitment on the part of the bank to take into its books its share of the individual loans as originated by the NBFC, \nthe arrangement must comply with the extant guidelines on Managing Risks and \nCode of Conduct in Outsourcing of Financial Services by Banks issued vide \nRBI/2014-15/497/DBR.No.BP.BC.76/21.04.158/2014-15 dated March 11, 2015  \nand updated from time to time. In particular, the partner bank and NBFC shall have to put in place suitable mechanisms for ex-ante due diligence by the bank as the credit sanction process cannot be outsourced under the extant guidelines.  \n \nb. The bank shall also be required to comply with the Master Directions -  Know Your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016, issued vide \nRBI/DBR/2015-16/18 Master \nDirection DBR.AML.BC.No.81/14.01.001/2015-16 dated February 25, 2016  and \nupdated from time to time, which already permit regulated entities, at their option, to rely on customer due diligence done by a third party, subject to specified conditions. \n \nc. However, if the bank can exercise its discretion regarding taking into its books the loans originated by NBFC as per the Agreement, the arrangement will be akin to a direct assignment transaction. Accordingly, the taking over bank shall ensure compliance with all the requirements in terms of Guidelines on Transactions Involving Transfer of Assets through Direct Assignment of Cash Flows and the Underlying Securities issued vide \nRBI/2011-12/540 \nDBOD.No.BP.BC-103/21.04.177/2011-12 dated May 07, 2012  and RBI//2012-\n13/170 DNBS. PD. No. 301/3.10.01/2012-13 August 21, 2012  respectively, as \nupdated from time to time, with the exception of Minimum Holding Period (MHP) which shall not be applicable in such transactions undertaken in terms of this CLM.  \nd. The MHP exemption shall be available only in cases where the prior agreement between the banks and NBFCs contains a back-to-back basis clause and Annex\u2026 \nEssential Features of Co-Lending Model between Banks and NBFCs  \n~ 2 ~ \n complies with all other conditions stipulated in the guidelines for direct assignment.  \n \n2. Banks shall not be allowed to enter into co-lending arrangement with an NBFC belonging to the promoter Group.  II. Customer related issues   3. The NBFC shall be the single point of interface for the customers and shall enter into a loan agreement with the borrower, which shall clearly contain the features of the arrangement and the roles and responsibilities of NBFCs and banks.  \n \n4. All the details of the arrangement shall be disclosed to the customers upfront and their explicit consent shall be taken.  \n \n5. The ultimate borrower may be charged an all-inclusive interest rate as may be agreed upon by both the lenders conforming to the extant guidelines applicable to both.       \n \n6. The extant guidelines relating to customer service and fair practices code and the obligations enjoined upon the banks and NBFCs therein shall be applicable mutatis mutandis in respect of loans given under the arrangement.  \n \n7. The NBFC should be able to generate a single unified statement of the customer, through appropriate information sharing arrangements with the bank. \n \n8. With regard to grievance redressal, suitable arrangement must be put in place by the co-lenders to resolve any complaint registered by a borrower with the NBFC within 30 days, failing which the borrower would have the option to escalate the same with the concerned Banking Ombudsman/Ombudsman for NBFCs or the Customer Education and Protection Cell (CEPC) in RBI.   III. Other Operational Aspects  \n \n9. The co-lending banks and NBFCs shall maintain each individual borrower\u2019s account for their respective exposures. However, all transactions (disbursements/ repayments) between the banks and NBFCs relating to CLM shall be routed through an escrow account maintained with the banks, in order to avoid inter-mingling of funds. The Master Agreement shall clearly specify the manner of appropriation between the co-lenders.  \n Annex\u2026 \nEssential Features of Co-Lending Model between Banks and NBFCs  \n~ 3 ~ \n 10. The Master Agreement may contain necessary clauses on representations and warranties which the originating NBFC shall be liable for in respect of the  share of the loans taken into its books by the bank.  \n \n11. The co-lenders shall establish a framework for monitoring and recovery of the loan, as mutually agreed upon. \n \n12. The co-lenders shall arrange for creation of security and charge as per mutually agreeable terms. \n \n13. Each lender shall adhere to the asset classification and provisioning requirement, as per the respective regulatory guidelines applicable to each of them including reporting to Credit Information Companies, under the applicable regulations for its share of the loan account. \n \n14. The loans under the CLM shall be included in the scope of internal/statutory audit within the banks and NBFCs to ensure adherence to their respective internal guidelines, terms of the agreement and extant regulatory requirements.  \n \n15. Any assignment of a loan by a co-lender to a third party can be done only with the consent of the other lender.  \n \n16. Both the banks and the NBFCs shall implement a business continuity plan to ensure uninterrupted service to their borrowers till repayment of the loans under the co-lending agreement, in the event of termination of co-lending arrangement between the co-lenders.

The applications shall comply with the instructions laid down in the Framework. 4.  This directive is issued under Section 18 read with Section 10(2) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007). Yours faithfully, \n \n(P. Vasudevan) Chief General Manager  Annex  Framework for Recognition of a Self-Regulatory Organisation  for Payment System Operators1  (DPSS.CO.PD.No.503/02.12.004/2020-21 dated October 22, 2020)   1. Introduction 1.1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as the regulator of payment and settlement systems in the country, sets the necessary regulatory framework, through a consultative process, to ensure that different types of payment systems operate in the country to meet the various payment needs in the economy. Over time, a bouquet of payment instruments has evolved to meet the expectations of different segments of users. 1.2. As the payment ecosystem matures and the number of payments systems proliferate, it becomes necessary, in the interest of optimal use of regulatory resources, that the payments industry develops standards in respect of system security, pricing practices, customer protection measures, grievance redressal mechanisms, etc. While self -regulation would release regulatory resources that can be better f ocused on issues of systemic importance, it would, by virtue of being developed by the industry itself, be more appropriate and encourage better compliance. As the industry is forced to think in terms of developing systems that conform to best international practices, it would enhance global competitiveness.  1.3. It has, therefore, been decided to encourage the establishment of a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) for Payment Systems Operators ( PSOs). 1.4. An SRO is a non-governmental organisation that sets and enforces rules and standards relating to the conduct of member entities in the industry, with the aim of protecting the customer and promoting ethical and professional standards. The SRO is expected to resolve disputes among its members internally through mutually accepted processes to ensure that members operate in a disciplined environment and even accept penal actions by the SRO. An ideal SRO would function beyond the narrow self-interests of the industry and address larger concerns, such as protecting customers, furthering training and education and strive for development of members, the industry and the ecosystem as a whole. \n                                                           \n1 \u2018Payment System\u2019 as defined under 2(i) of Payments and Settlement Systems Act, 2007; Operators include System Participants and System Providers as defined under Section 2(p) and 2(q) of the Act.    1.5. Regulations, standards, dispute resolution and enforcement by an SRO get legitimacy not just by mutual agreement of its members, but also by the efficiency with which self - regulation is perceived to be administered. Such regulations supplement, but do not replace, applicable laws or regulations.  2. Characteristics of an SRO 2.1. An SRO is expected to have the following characteristics in order to gain the trust and confidence of its members: \u2022 Authority, derived from membership agreements, to set behavioural and professional standards and enforce them on the members;  \u2022 Objective and well-defined processes to make rules and enforce them among members;  \u2022 Standardised procedures for handling conflicts and disputes, as well as methods to resolve them through a transparent and consistent dispute resolution mechanism ; \u2022 Effective means of oversight over its members and ensuring that they adhere to the rules and regulations of the industry as also mutually accepted ethical and professional standards of behaviour; and  \u2022 Develop surveillance methods for effective monitoring.  3. Eligibility for Recognition of an SRO by RBI 3.1. The SRO shall be set-up as a not-for-profit company under the Companies Act, 2013. 3.2. Only regulated payment system entities, viz, banks and non-bank PSOs can be members of an SRO. 3.3. The SRO shall be professionally managed with clear bye laws.  3.4. The memorandum / bye laws of the SRO shall specify the criteria for admission of members and the functions it will discharge. It shall also provide for the manner in which the Board of Directors (governing body) would function. 3.5. RBI may, if it deems necessary, require that the appointment of important positions in the Board of Directors of the SRO be subject to its prior approval. 3.6. The SRO shall be financially viable to carry on the activities handled or assigned to it. The fee for membership of the SRO shall be reasonable and uniform across all members.   4. Requirements Related to Management of Affairs of the SRO  4.1. The Board of Directors and management of the SRO shall satisfy the fit and proper criteria  (FPC) on an ongoing basis. Here, FPC would mean that the person is of high integrity, with  blemishless character and having relevant expertise in relevant fields in the payments ecosystem. 4.2. Any change in directorship or adverse development about any Director shall be immediately reported to RBI. 4.3. At least one-third of members in the Board of Directors shall be independent and not associated with member institutions. 4.4. The Board shall frame a code of conduct to be followed by its members.  4.5. The SRO should be in a position to monitor adherence to the code of conduct as well as compliance with regulations by its members.  4.6. The SRO shall follow transparent practices for establishing its governance processes; setting standards, prescribing benchmarks, etc.  5. Grant of Recognition as an SRO 5.1. A group / association of payment system operators (banks as well as non -banks) shall apply to RBI seeking recognition as an SRO. 5.2. RBI reserves the right to require the applicant to submit further information or clarification as deemed necessary, before deciding on the grant of recognition as an SRO. 5.3. On finding the applicant suitable, RBI shall issue a \u201cLetter of Recognition\u201d as an SRO.  5.4. RBI, if in its considered opinion, concludes that the SRO is functioning in a manner detrimental to the public interest, it may withdraw its recognition to an SRO after giving due opportunity to the entity to further its views / comments.   6.

This would be in addition to the shifting permitted at the beginning of the accounting year.

Please do not respond in any manner to such offers.\n \n2  Master Circular  \n             Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) \n \n1. Background \n \nThe Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), Government of India launched the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) by restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY) with effect from 01st April 2013 (\nRBI Circular No. RBI/2012-13/559 dated 27 \nJune 2013 ). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - \nNational Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016 .The DAY -NRLM is the flagship program of Govt. of India for promoting poverty reduction through building strong institutions of the poor, particularly women, and enabling these institutions to access a range of financial services and livelihoods. DAY-NRLM adopts a demand driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State specific poverty reduction action plans. The blocks and districts in which all the components of DAY-NRLM would be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs, would  be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas remaining would be non-intensive blocks and districts. \nThe key features of DAY-NRLM have been furnished in Annex I . \n \n2. Women SHGs and their Federations \n \n2.1 Women SHGs under DAY-NRLM consist of 10-20 persons. In case of special SHGs i.e. groups in the difficult areas, groups with disabled persons, and groups formed in remote tribal areas, this number may be a minimum of 5 persons. \n \n2.2 DAY-NRLM promotes affinity-based women Self Help Groups (SHGs). \n \n2.3 Only for groups to be formed with Persons with disabilities, and other special categories like elder, transgender, DAY-NRLM will have both men and women in the Self- Help Groups.  \n2.4 SHG is an informal group and registration under any Societies Act, State cooperative Act or a partnership firm is not mandatory vide Circular RPCD.No. Plan\n BC.13/PL- 09.22/90-91 dated July 24\nth, 1991. However, Federations of Self Help Groups formed at Village, Gram Panchayat, Cluster or higher level may be registered under appropriate acts prevailing in their respective states. \n \nFinancial Assistance to the SHGs \n3. Revolving Fund: DAY-NRLM, MoRD, would provide Revolving Fund (RF) support to SHGs in existence for a minimum period of 3/6 months  and follow the norms of good SHGs, i.e. they follow \u2018Panchasutra\u2019 \u2013 regular meetings, regular savings, regular internal lending, regular recoveries and maintenance of proper books of accounts. Only such SHGs that have not received any RF earlier would be provided with RF, as corpus, with a 3  minimum of \u20b910,000 and up to a maximum of \u20b915,000 per SHG. The purpose of RF is to strengthen their institutional and financial management capacity and build a good credit history within the group.\n \n \n4. Capital Subsidy has been discontinued under DAY-NRLM: No Capital Subsidy would be sanctioned to any SHG from the date of implementation of DAY-NRLM. \n \n5. Community Investment Support Fund (CIF) CIF would be provided by MoRD to the SHGs promoted under DAY \u2013 NRLM in all blocks (intensive and non-intensive) and would be routed through the Village level/ Cluster level Federations, to be maintained in perpetuity by the Federations. The CIF would  be used, by the Federations, to advance loans to the SHGs and/or to undertake the common/collective socio-economic activities. \n \n6. Introduction of Interest subvention: DAY-NRLM has a provision for interest subvention, to cover the difference between the Lending Rate of the banks and 7%, on all credit from the banks/ financial institutions availed by women SHGs, for a maximum of \u20b9 300,000/- per SHG. This would be available across the country in two ways:  (i) In 250 identified districts, banks may lend to the women SHGs @7% up to an aggregated loan amount of \u20b9300,000/-. The banks would be subvented to the extent of difference between the Weighted Average Interest Charged and 7%, subject to the maximum limit of 5.5%. An additional interest subvention of 3% is also available on prompt repayment by the SHGs, reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%.    (ii)\n In the remaining districts, the banks may lend at their respective lending rates, applicable to SHGs. In these districts, all women SHGs under DAY\u2013 NRLM would be eligible for interest subvention on prompt repayment. The difference between the bank lending rates and 7% for loans up to \u20b9300,000/- subject to a maximum limit of 5.5%, would be subvented directly in the loan accounts of the SHGs by the SRLMs. This part of the scheme would be operationalized by the SRLMs. \n \n\u2022 Salient features of the Scheme are enclosed in Annex II . \n\u2022 The list of 250 identified districts is as per Annex III . \n\u2022  Subvented interest rate would be communicated separately to the banks by GoI/RBI.  \n \n    4  7. Role of banks: \n \n \n7.1 Opening of Savings account: \n \n7.1.1 Opening of Savings account of SHGs: The role of banks would commence with opening of accounts for all the Women SHGs including members with disability and the Federations of the SHGs. The SHGs engaged in promoting of savings habits among their members would be eligible to open savings bank accounts.  (i) Know Your Customer (KYC) verification of only the office bearers shall suffice for opening of savings bank account. (ii)  Banks may not insist on Permanent Account Number (PAN) of SHGs at the time of opening of account or transactions and may accept declaration in Form No 60 as may be required. (iii) For KYC verification pertaining to SHG members during opening of accounts, instructions of Department of Banking Regulation in \nMaster Direction on KYC (dated \nFebruary 25, 2016 , updated as on April 20, 2020) (Part VI \u2013 Paragraph 43) shall be \nadhered to while completing Customer Due Diligence (CDD ) process. CDD means identifying and verifying the customer and the beneficial owner . Accordingly, the current instructions under Simplified norms for Self Help Groups (SHGs) mention that while opening of accounts Customer Due Diligence (CDD) of all the members of SHG shall not be required and CDD of only the office bearers shall  suffice. At the time of credit linking of SHGs, banks may undertake KYC verification of all the members in the SHG. However, opening of savings account of all members with the bank shall not be made a prerequisite for credit linkage of SHGs. Banks are advised to maintain separate Savings and loan account for Self Help Groups.\n \n(iv) Business Correspondents deployed by banks may also be authorized to open Saving Bank Accounts of the SHGs after verification/approval of the base branch, subject to adherence to extant BC guidelines and in accordance with the bank\u2019s Boar d approved policy on Business Correspondents. However, ensuring compliance with KYC and AML norms under the BC model continues to be the responsibility of the banks.    \n \n7.1.2 Opening of Savings account of Federation of SHGs: Banks are advised to open savings account of Federations of SHGs at village, Gram Panchayat, Cluster or higher level. These accounts may be categorized as savings account for \u2018Association of persons\u2019. The \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 (KYC) norms for the signatories of such accounts as spec ified from time to time by Reserve Bank of India would be applicable.\n  \n7.1.3 Opening of Current Account of Producer Groups (PGs): In order to facilitate collective production and marketing for their produce, banks are advised to open current account for Producer Groups promoted under DAY-NRLM at village, Gram Panchayat, Cluster or higher level. The \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 (KYC) norms for the signatories of such accounts as specified from time to time by Reserve Bank of India would be applicable. 5   7.1.4 Transaction in Savings/Cash Credit account of SHGs and Federation of SHGs: SHGs and their federations may be encouraged to transact through their respective saving accounts and Cash Credit Loan accounts on regular basis. To facilitate this, banks are advised to enable transactions in jointly operated savi ngs/Cash Credit account of SHGs and their federations with interoperable facility at retail outlets managed by Business Correspondents. Banks are also advised to extend all such services to SHGs and their federations through Business Correspondents  as per their board approved policies.  7.2 Lending Norms to individual SHG members and SHGs  7.2.1 The eligibility criteria for the SHGs to avail loans: \n \n\u2022 SHGs should be in active existence at least since the last 6 months as per the books of account of SHGs and not from the date of opening of S/B  account. \n\u2022 SHGs should be practicing \u2018Panchasutras\u2019 i.e. Regular meetings; Regular savings; Regular inter-loaning; Timely repayment; and Up-to-date books of accounts; \n\u2022 Qualified as per grading norms fixed by NABARD. As and when the federations of the SHGs come to existence, the grading exercise may be done by the Federations to support the banks. \n\u2022 The existing defunct SHGs are also eligible for credit if they are revived and continue to be active for a minimum period of 3 months. \n \n7.2.2 Loan Application: It is advised that all banks may use the Common Loan Application Forms recommended by Indian Bank\u2019s Association (IBA) for extending credit facility to SHGs.\n  \n7.2.3 Loan amount: Emphasis is laid on the multiple doses of assistance under DAY - NRLM. This would mean assisting an SHG over a period of time, through repeat doses of credit, to enable them to access higher amounts of credit for taking up sustainable livelihoods and improve on the quality of life. \n \nSHGs may avail either Term Loan (TL) or a Cash Credit Limit (CCL) loan or both based on the need. In case of need, additional loan may be sanctioned even though the previous loan is outstanding, based on the repayment behavior and performance of the SHG.  The amount of credit under different facilities are as follows: Cash Credit Limit (CCL): In case of CCL, banks are advised to sanction minimum loan of \u20b9 6 lakh to each eligible SHGs for a period of 3 years with a yearly drawing power (DP). The drawing power may be enhanced annually based on the repayment performance of 6  the SHG. The drawing power may be calculated as follows:  \u2022 DP for First Year: 6 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b91 lakh, whichever is higher \u2022 DP for Second Year: 8 times of the corpus at the time review/ enhancement or minimum of \u20b92 lakh, whichever is higher \u2022 DP for Third Year: Minimum of \u20b96 lakh based on the Micro credit plan prepared by SHG and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit history.\n \n\u2022 DP for Fourth Year onwards: Above \u20b96 lakh, based on the Micro credit plan prepared by SHG and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit History.  \n \nTerm Loan: In case of Term Loan, banks are advised to sanction loan amount in doses as mentioned below: \u2022 First Dose: 6 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b91 lakh, whichever is higher \u2022 Second Dose: 8 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b92 lakh, whichever is higher \u2022 Third Dose: Minimum of \u20b96 lakh, based on the Micro credit plan prepared by the SHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit history. \u2022 Fourth Dose onwards: Above \u20b96 lakh, based on the Micro credit plan prepared by the SHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit History.  \n \nBanks are advised take necessary measures to ensure that eligible SHGs are provided with repeat loans. Banks are advised to coordinate with DAY -NRLM to institutionalize a mechanism for online submission of loan application from SHGs for tracking and timely disposal of application. \n \n(Corpus is inclusive of revolving funds, if any, received by that SHG, its own savings, interest earning by SHG from on-lending to its members, income from other sources, and funds from other sources in case of promotion by other institutes/NGOs.)  \n \n7.3 Purpose of loan and repayment: \n \n7.3.1  The loan amount would be distributed among members based on the Micro Credit Plan (MCP) prepared by the SHGs. The loans may be used by members for meeting social needs, high cost debt swapping, construction or repair of house, construction of toilets and taking up sustainable livelihoods by the individual members within the SHGs or to finance any viable common activity started by the SHGs. \n \n7.3.2  In order to facilitate use of loans for augmenting livelihoods of SHG members, it is advised that at least 50% of loans above \u20b92 lakh, 75% of loans above \u20b94 lakh and at 7  least 85% of loans above \u20b96 lakh be used primarily for income generating productive purposes. Micro Credit Plan (MCP) prepared by SHGs would form the basis for determining the purpose and usage of loans. \n \n7.3.3  Repayment schedule for Term Loans may be as follows: \n\u2022 The First dose of loan may be repaid in 24-36 months in monthly/Quarterly Instalments. \n\u2022 The Second dose of loan may be repaid in 36-48 months in monthly/Quarterly instalments. \n\u2022 The Third dose of loan may be repaid in 48-60 months based on the cash flow in monthly/Quarterly instalments. \n\u2022 The loan from Fourth dose onwards may be repaid between 60-84 months based on the cash flow in monthly/ quarterly installments. \n  \n7.3.4 All facilities sanctioned under DAY- NRLM would be governed by the Asset Classification norms issued by Reserve Bank of India from time to time.  \n7.4. Security and Margin:  No collateral and no margin would be charged up to \u20b910.00 lakh limit to the SHGs. No lien should be marked against savings bank account of SHGs and no deposits should be insisted upon while sanctioning loans \n \n7.5. Dealing with Defaulters: It is desirable that willful defaulters should not be financed under DAY-NRLM. In case willful defaulters are members of a group, they might be allowed to benefit from the thrift and credit activities of the group including the corpus built up with the assistance of Revolving Fund. But at the stage of accessing bank loan by SHG for financing economic activities by its members, the willful defaulters should not have the benefit of such bank loan until the outstanding loans are repaid. Willful defaulters of the group should not get benefits under the DAY-NRLM Scheme and the group may be financed excluding such defaulters while documenting the loan. However, banks should not deny loan to entire SHG on the pretext that spouse or other family members of individual members of SHG being a defaulter with the bank. Further, non-willful defaulters should not be debarred from receiving the loan. In case default is due to genuine reasons, b anks may follow the norms suggested for restructuring the account with revised repayment  schedule. \n \n8  Credit Target Planning 8.1   Based on the Potential Linked Plan/State Focus Paper prepared by NABARD, SLBC sub-committee on SHG Bank Linkage may arrive at the district -wise, block-wise and branch-wise credit plan. The sub- committee should consider the existing SHGs, New SHGs proposed, and number of SHGs eligible for fresh and repeat loans as suggested 8  by the SRLMs to arrive at the credit targets for the states. The targets so decided should be approved in the SLBC and reviewed and monitored periodically for effective implementation. 8.2 The district-wise credit plans should be communicated to the DCC. The Block - wise/Cluster-wise targets are to be communicated to the bank branches through the Controllers. 9 Post credit follow-up 9.1 Loan pass books or statement of accounts in regional languages may be issued to the SHGs which may contain all the details of the loans disbursed to them and the terms and conditions applicable to the loan sanctioned. The passbook should be updated with every transaction made by the SHGs. At the time of documentation and disbursement of loan, it is advisable to clearly explain the terms and conditions as part of financial  literacy. 9.2  Bank branches may observe one fixed day in a fortnight to enable the staff to go to the field and attend the meetings of the SHGs and Federations to observe the operations of the SHGs and keep a track of the regularity in the SHGs meetings and performance. 10  Repayment: Prompt repayment of the loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks shall take all possible measures, i.e. personal contact, organization of joint recovery camps with District Mission Management Units (DPMUs) / District Rural Development Agency(DRDAs) to ensure the recovery of loans. Keeping in view, the importance of loan recovery, banks should prepare a list of defaulting SHGs under DAY-NRLM every month and furnish the list in the BLBC, DCC meetings. This would ensure that DAY-NRLM staff at the district/ block level would assist the bankers in initiating the repayment \n \n11  Supervision and monitoring of the Scheme Banks may set up cells for Self Help Groups at respec tive Regional/Zonal offices of banks. These cells should periodically monitor and review the flow of credit to the SHGs, ensure the implementation of the guidelines to the scheme, collect data from the branches and make available consolidated data to the Head office and the DAY -NRLM units at the districts/ blocks. The cell should also discuss this consolidated data in the SLBC, BLBC and DCC meetings regularly to maintain the effective communication  with the state staff and all banks. \n \n11.1 State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee: SLBCs shall constitute a sub-committee on SHG bank linkage. The sub-committee should consist of members from all banks operating in the State, RBI, NABARD, CEO of SRLM, representatives of State Rural Development Department, Secretary-Institutional Finance and Representatives of Development Departments etc. The sub- committee shall discuss a specific agenda of review, implementation and monitoring of the SHG-Bank linkage and the issues/ constraints in achievement of the credit target. The decisions of SLBCs should be derived from the analysis of the reports of the sub-committee. \n 9  11.2  District Coordination Committee: The DCC shall regularly monitor the flow of credit to SHGs at the district level and resolve issues that constrain the flow of credit to the SHGs at district level. This committee should \nhave participation of LDMs, AGM of NABARD, district coordinators of the banks and DPMU staff representing DAY -NRLM and office bearers of SHG federations \n \n11.3  Block level Bankers Committee: The BLBC shall take up issues of SHG bank linkage at the block level. In this Committee, the SHGs/ Federations of the SHGs should be included as members to raise their voice in the forum. Branch wise status of SHG credit shall be monitored at the BLBC. \n \n11.4  Reporting to Lead District Managers: The branches may furnish the progress report and the delinquency report achieved under various activities of DAY -NRLM in the format at Annex\u2013IV and Annex -V\n to the LDM every month for onward submission to \nSpecial Steering Committee/sub-committee constituted by SLBC. \n \n11.5  Reporting to RBI: Banks may give a state-wise consolidated report on the progress made on DAY-NRLM to RBI/NABARD at quarterly intervals. The data may be submitted within a month from the end of the concerned quarter. \n \n11.6 LBR returns: Existing procedure of submitting LBR returns to be continued duly furnishing the correct code \n \n12  Financial Literacy: Financial Literacy is one of the important strateg ies to spread awareness on financial behavior and keep households informed about various financial products and services. DAY-NRLM has trained and deployed a large number of cadre called \u2018Financial Literacy Community Resource Persons (FL- CRPs)\u2019 to carry out financial literacy camps at village level. Financial Literacy Centers (FLC) established by various banks may coordinate with respective SRLMs and utilize the services of FL- CRPs to conduct village camps on Financial Literacy. \n \n13  Data Sharing: \n \n13.1 Data sharing on a mutually agreed format / interval may be provided to DAY -NRLM or State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs) for initiating various strategies including recovery etc.  The financing banks are advised to regularly share data on loans to SHGs with the DAY- NRLM or SRLMs, directly from the CBS platform. \n \n13.2  Banks should share data of Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) with DAY -NRLM on agreed formats to facilitate higher enrollment and claim settlement under the mentioned  schemes. \n 10  13.3  Banks to share data of all SHG transactions being done at Business Correspondents points using Dual Authentication technology introduced by banks on a mutually agreed format/interval only after obtaining consent of  the customer. However, the banks should ensure preservation and protection of the security and confidentiality of customer information in the custody or possession of BC.   14 DAY-NRLM support to the bankers:  14.1 SRLM would develop strategic partnerships with major banks at various levels. It would invest in creating enabling conditions for both the banks and the poor for a mutually rewarding relationship.  14.2 SRLM would assist the SHGs through imparting financial Literacy, extending counselling services on savings, credit, insurance, pension and training on Micro-  investment Planning embedded in capacity building.  \n14.3  SRLMs would extend support to banks for improving quality of banking services to poor clients including follow-up for recovery of over dues if any, by positioning customer relationship managers (Bank Mitra/ Sakhi) with every bank branch involved in financing of SHGs. \n  \n14.4  Leveraging IT mobile technologies and institutions of poor, youth or SHG member as business facilitators and business correspondents.  14.5  Community Based Repayment mechanism (CBRM): One exclusive sub - committee for SHG Bank Linkage may be formed at village/cluster/ block level which would provide support to the banks in ensuring proper utilization of loan amount, recovery etc. The bank linkage sub - committee members from each village level federation along with project staff would meet once in a month under the chairmanship of the Branch Manager in the branch premises with the agenda items relating to bank  linkage. 11  Annex I       \nKey Features of DAY-NRLM     1. Universal Social Mobilization: To begin with, DAY-NRLM would ensure that at least one member from each identified rural poor household, preferably a woman, is brought under the Self Help Group (SHG) network in a time bound manner. Subsequently, both women and men would be organized for addressing livelihood issues i.e.  farmers organizations, milk producers\u2019 cooperatives, weavers associations, etc.  All these institutions are inclusive and no poor would be left out of them. DAY -NRLM would ensure adequate coverage of vulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of the beneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are minorities and 3% are persons with disability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of all households under the automatically included criteria and households with at least one deprivation criteria as per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC).    2. Participatory Identification of poor (PIP): The experience from SGSY suggests that the current BPL list has large inclusion and exclusion errors. To widen the target groups beyond the BPL list and to include all the needy poor identified as households with at least one deprivation criteria as per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC). DAY- NRLM would also undertake community-based process i.e. participation of the poor in the process of identifying the target group. Participatory process based on sound methodology and tools (social mapping and well-being categorization, deprivation indicators) and also locally understood and accepted criterion ensures local consensus that inadvertently reduces the inclusion and exclusion errors and enables formation of the groups on the basis of mutual affinity. Over the years, the participatory method of identifying the poor have been developed and applied successfully in the states like AP, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha.     The households identified with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC along with households identified through the P.I.P process would be accepted as DAY-NRLM target group and would be eligible for all the benefits under the programme. The list finalized after PIP process would be vetted by the Gram Sabha and approved by the Gram Panchayat.     Till the PIP process is undertaken by the State in a particular district/Block, the rural households with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC list would be targeted under DAY-NRLM. As already provided in the Framework for implementation of DAY - NRLM, up to 30% of the total membership of the SHGs may be from among the population marginally above the poverty line, subject to the approval of other members 12  of the group. This 30% also includes the poor households whose name does not figure in the SECC list but are as poor as those included in SECC list.    3. Promotion of Institutions of the poor: Strong institutions of the poor such as SHGs and their village level and higher-level federations are necessary to provide space, voice and resources for the poor and for reducing their dependence on external agencies. They empower them and also act as instruments of knowledge and technology dissemination, and hubs of production, collectivization and commerce. DAY -NRLM, therefore, would focus on setting up these institutions at various levels. In addition, DAY - NRLM would promote specialized institutions like Livelihoods collectives, producers\u2019 cooperative/companies for livelihoods promotion through deriving economies of scale, backward and forward linkages, and access to information, credit, technology, markets etc.  The Livelihoods collectives would enable the poor to optimize their limited resource.     4. Strengthening all existing SHGs and federations of the poor. There are existing institutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of NGOs. DAY - NRLM would strengthen all existing institutions of the poor in a partnership mode. The self-help promoting institutions both in the Government and in the NGO sector would promote social accountability practices to introduce greater transparency. This would be in addition to the mechanisms that would be evolved by SRLMs and state governments. The learning from one another underpins the key processes of learning in DAY -NRLM.    5. Emphasis on Training, Capacity building and skill building: DAY -NRLM would ensure that the poor are provided with the requisite skills for managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods, enhancing their credit absorption capacity and credit worthiness, etc. A multi-pronged approach is envisaged for continuous capacity building of the targeted families, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders. Particular focus would be on developing and engaging community professionals and community resource persons for capacity building of SHGs and their federations and other collectives. DAY - NRLM would make extensive use of ICT to make knowledge dissemination and capacity building more effective. \n \n 6. Revolving Fund and Community investment support Fund (C.I.F): A Revolving Fund would be provided to eligible SHGs as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thrift and accumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long -run and immediate consumption needs in the short-run. The C.I.F would be a corpus and used for meeting the members\u2019 credit needs directly and as catalytic capital for leveraging repeat bank finance. The C.I.F would be routed to the SHGs through the Federations.  The key to coming out of poverty is continuous and easy access to finance, at reasonable rates, till they accumulate their own funds in large measure. 13     7. Universal Financial Inclusion: DAY-NRLM would work towards achieving universal financial inclusion, beyond basic banking services to all the poor households, SHGs and their federations. DAY-NRLM would work on both demand and supply side of Financial Inclusion. On the demand side, it would promote financial literacy among the poor and provides catalytic capital to the SHGs and their federations. On the supply side, it would coordinate with the financial sector and encourage use of Information, Communication & Technology (ICT) based financial technologies, business correspondents and community facilitators like \u2018Bank Mitras\u2019. It would also work towards universal coverage of rural poor against loss of life, health and assets. Further, it would work on remittances, especially in areas where migration is endemic.     8. Provision of Interest Subvention: The rural poor need credit at low rate of interest and in multiple doses to make their ventures economically viable. In order to ensure affordable credit, DAY-NRLM has a provision for subvention on interest rate above 7% per annum for all eligible SHGs, who have availed loans from mainstream financial institutions.     9. Funding Pattern: DAY-NRLM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the financing of the programme would be shared between the Centre and the States in the ratio of 60:40 (90:10 in case of North Eastern States including Sikkim; completely from the Centre in case of UTs). The Central allocation earmarked for the States would broadly be distributed in relation to the incidence of poverty in the States.     10. Phased Implementation: Social capital of the poor consists of the institutions of the poor, their leaders, community professionals and more importantly community resource persons (poor women whose lives have been transformed through the support of their institutions). Building up social capital takes some time in the initial years, but it multiplies rapidly after some time. If the social capital of the poor does not play the lead role in DAY-NRLM, then it would not be a people\u2019s programme. Further, it is important to ensure that the quality and effectiveness of the interventions is not diluted. Therefore, a phased implementation approach is adopted in DAY-NRLM. DAY-NRLM would reach all districts by the end of 12th Five-year Plan.     11. Intensive blocks. The blocks that are taken up for implementation of DAY -NRLM, \u2018intensive blocks\u2019, would have access to a full complement of trained professional staff and cover a whole range of activities of universal and intense social and financial inclusion, livelihoods, partnerships etc. However, in the remaining blocks or non-intensive blocks, the activities may be limited in scope and intensity.     12. Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs). RSETI concept is buil t on the model pioneered by Rural Development Self Employment Institute (RUDSETI) \u2013  a 14  collaborative partnership between SDME Trust and Canara Bank. The model envisages transforming unemployed youth into confident self- employed entrepreneurs through a short duration experiential learning programme followed by systematic long duration hand holding support. The need-based training builds entrepreneurship qualities, improves self-confidence, reduces risk of failure and develops the trainees into change agents. Banks are fully involved in selection, training and post training follow up stages. The needs of the poor articulated through the institutions of the poor would guide RSETIs in preparing the participants/trainees in their pursuits of self - employment and enterprises. DAY-NRLM would encourage public sector banks to set up RSETIs in all districts of the country.  \n \n                         15  Annex II    Interest Subvention Scheme for Women SHGs   Interest subvention scheme on Credit to Women SHG s in rural areas would be available in following two ways:  I. Interest subvention scheme on credit to women SHGs in 250 districts:   i. All women SHGs would be eligible for Interest subvention on credit up to \u20b93 lakh at subvented rate of 7% per annum. SHGs availing capital subsidy under SGSY in their existing credit outstanding would not be eligible for benefit under this scheme.   ii. The commercial banks (Public Sector, Private Sector and Small Finance Banks) would lend to all the women SHGs in rural areas at the rate of 7% up to an aggregated loan amount of \u20b9300,000/- in the 250 districts as provided in Annexure III\n. For the women \nSHGs in these districts an additional interest subvention of 3% is also available on prompt repayment, reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%. \n iii. All commercial banks (Public Sector, Private Sector and Small Finance Banks) would  be subvented to the extent of difference between the Weighted Av erage Interest Charged (WAIC as specified by Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance) and 7% subject to the maximum limit of 5.5%. This subvention would be available to all the banks on the condition that they make SHG credit available at 7% p.a. in the 250 districts.   iv. Further, the SHGs would be provided with an additional 3% subvention on the prompt repayment of loans. For the purpose of Interest Subvention of additional 3% on prompt repayment, an SHG account would be considered prompt payee if it satisfies the following criterion.   a. For Cash Credit Limit:  i. Outstanding balance shall not have remained in excess of the limit/drawing power continuously for more than 30 days. ii. There should be regular credit and debits in the accounts. In any case there shall be at least one customer induced credit during a month. iii. Customer induced credit should be sufficient to cover the interest debited during the month.   b. For the Term loans: A term loan account where all of the interest payments and/or instalments of principal were paid within 30 days of the due date during the tenure of the loan, would be considered as an account having prompt payment.  16   v. The banks should credit the amount of 3% interest subvention to the eligible prompt payee SHG loan accounts and seek the reimbursement after the end of reporting quarter.  vi. The funding for the scheme would be met out of Central Allocation under DAY- NRLM   vii. The interest subvention scheme shall be implemented through a Nodal Bank selected by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD). The Nodal Bank would operationalize the scheme through a web based platform, as advised by MoRD. The nodal bank would be notified by MoRD.  viii. In order to avail the Interest Subvention on credit extended to the SHGs @ 7% (regular subvention), all Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks and Small Finance Banks are required to upload the SHG loan account information on the Nodal Bank\u2019s portal as per the required technical specification. The banks should also submit the claims for 3% additional subvention on the same portal.  ix. Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks and Small Finance Banks must submit the regular claims (difference between WAIC or lending rate and 7%) and additional cl aims (@ 3% on prompt repayment) on a quarterly basis as on June 30, September 30, December 31, and March 31 by last week of the subsequent month.  x. The banks are required to submit claim certificate on quarterly basis to the nodal bank. The claims submitted by any bank should be accompanied by claim certificate (in original) certifying the claims for subvention as true and correct ( Annexure-VI & VII\n). The \nclaims of any bank for the quarter ending March would be settled by MoRD only on receipt of the Statutory Auditor\u2019s certificate for the complete F inancial Year from the bank.  \n xi. Any remaining claim pertaining to the disbursements made during the year  and not included during the year, may be consolidated separately and marked as an 'Additional Claim' and submitted to Nodal Bank by banks latest by June every year, duly audited by Statutory Auditor\u2019s certifying the correctness. No claims from banks pertaining to interest subvention for Financial Year are admissible after June 30.   xii. Any corrections in claims by banks shall be adjusted from later claims based on auditor\u2019s certificate. The corrections must be made on the Nodal Bank\u2019s portal accordingly.      17  II. Interest subvention scheme for Category II Districts (Other than 250 districts).   In the Category II districts, banks may charge the SHGs as per their respective lending norms and the difference between the lending rates and 7% subject  to a maximum limit of 5.5% would be subvented directly in the loan accounts of the SHGs by the SRLMs. The funding for this subvention would be provided to the State Rural Livelihoods Missions (SRLMs) from the allocation for DAY- NRLM. In pursuance of the above, the salient features and the operational guidelines in respect of the interest subvention for the category II districts, are as follows:  (A) Role of the Banks:  All banks are required to furnish the details of the credit disbursement and credit outstanding of the SHGs across all districts in the desired format as suggested by the MoRD, directly from the CBS platform, to the Ministry of Rural Development (through FTP or interface) and to the SRLMs. The information should be provided on a monthly basis to facilitate the calculation and disbursement of the Interest Subvention amount to SHGs.   (B) Role of the State Governments:   i. All women SHGs from rural areas under DAY- NRLM would be eligible for interest subvention on credit upto \u20b93 lakh at the rate of 7% per annum on prompt repayment.   ii. This scheme would be implemented by the State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs). SRLMs would provide interest subvention to the eligible SHGs who have accessed loan from commercial and cooperative banks. The funding for this subvention would be met out of the Central Allocation and State Contribution as per the norms of Government of India.   iii. The SHGs would be subvented to the extent of difference between the lending r ate of the banks and 7% subject to a maximum limit of 5.5% by the SRLMs, directly on a monthly/quarterly basis. An e-transfer of the subvention amount would be made by the SRLM to the loan accounts of the SHGs who have repaid promptly. In case the loan account is already closed, or e-transfer to the loan account is not successful due to any reason, the subvention amount may be transferred to the corresponding savings account of the concerned SHGs.  iv. For the purpose of the Interest Subvention, an account would be considered as prompt payee if it satisfies the following criterion:     18  a. For Cash Credit Limit:  1. Outstanding balance shall not have remained in excess of the limit/drawing power continuously for more than 30 days  2. There should be regular credit and debits in the accounts. In any case there shall be at least one customer induced credit during a month  3. Customer induced credit should be sufficient to cover the interest debited during the month.   b. For the Term loans: A term loan account where all of the interest payments and/or instalments of principal were paid within 30 days of the due date during the tenure of the loan, would be considered as an account having prompt payment   v. Women SHGs who have availed capital subsidy under SGSY in their existing loans, would not be eligible for benefit of Interest Subvention for their subsisting loan under this scheme.   vi. SRLMs should submit Quarterly Utilization Certificate indicating subvention amounts transferred to the Loan accounts of the eligible SHGs.   III. The States with state specific interest subvention schemes are advised to harmonize their guidelines with the Central scheme.  19    \nAnnexure-III List of 250 eligible Districts for the Interest

No. DoS.CO.PPG./SEC.03/11.01.005/2020-21                 September 14, 2020  The Chairman / Managing Director / Chief Executive Officer All Scheduled Commercial Banks (Excluding RRBs) and All Small Finance Banks   Madam / Dear Sir,  Automation of Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning  processes in \nbanks \n We invite a reference to our circular DBS.CO.PPD.No.1950/11.01.005/2011- 12 dated August 04, 2011, in terms of which banks were advised, inter alia, to have appropriate IT system in place for identification of Non-Performing Assets (NPA) and generation of related data/ returns, both for regulatory reporting and bank\u2019s own MIS requirements. It is, however, observed that the processes for NPA identification, income recognition, provisioning and generation of related returns in many banks are not yet fully automated. Banks are still found to be resorting to manual identification of NPA and also over-riding the system generated asset classification by manual intervention in a routine manner.  2. In order to ensure the completeness and integrity of the automated Asset Classification (classification of advances/investments as NPA/NPI and their upgradation), Provisioning calculation and Income Recognition processes, banks are advised to put in place / upgrade their systems to conform to the following guidelines latest by June 30, 2021.  Coverage: 2.1 All borrowal accounts, including temporary overdrafts, irrespective of size, sector or types of limits, shall be covered in the automated IT based system (System) for asset classification, upgradation, and provisioning processes. Banks\u2019 investments shall also be covered under the System. 2.2 Asset classification rules shall be configured in the System, in compliance with the regulatory stipulations.   \n  \n2 2.3 Calculation of provisioning requirement shall also be System based as per pre-set rules for various categories of assets, value of security as captured in the System and any other regulatory stipulations issued from time to time on provisioning requirements.  2.4 In addition, income recognition/derecognition in case of impaired assets (NPAs/NPIs) shall be system driven and amount required to be reversed from the income account should be obtained from the System without any manual intervention. 2.5 The System shall handle both down-grade and upgrade of accounts through Straight Through Process (STP) without manual intervention.  Frequency: 2.6 The System based asset classification shall be an ongoing exercise for both down-gradation and up-gradation of accounts. Banks should ensure that the asset classification status is updated as part of day end process. Banks should also be able to generate classification status report at any given point of time with actual date of classification of assets as NPAs/NPIs.   Exceptions: 2.7 Exceptions may be granted from System driven classification in certain circumstances, which are expected to be minimum and temporary. It may be emphasised that these exceptions are from automated classification and not from IRAC norms  and shall be subject to the conditions as explained below. 2.8 Banks shall not resort to manual intervention / over-ride in the System based asset classification process. In any exceptional circumstance where manual intervention is required to override the System classification, it must have at least two level authorisation. Such delegation of powers for authorising the exceptions should be as per the Board approved policy of the bank (by CEO, in case of unavailability of Board) and preferably should be done from the centralised location and suitably documented. Further, any such intervention shall have appropriate audit trails and subjected to audit by concurrent and statutory auditors. Detail reports of such manual intervention sh all be placed before the Audit Committee / Audit Head (banks having no Board) regularly . 2.9 Banks shall maintain logs for all exceptions i.e. manual interventions / over-rides including, but not limited to, the date and time stamp; purpose/reason; user-IDs, name and designation of those making such manual intervention and necessary account details. These logs shall   \n  \n3 also be stored for a minimum period of three years and not be tampered with during the storage period. These logs shall be system generated.  System Requirements and System Audit: 2.10 In case a separate application outside the CBS is used as the System for NPA/NPI identification and/or classification, the System must have access to the required data from the CBS and/or other relevant applications of the bank and the borrower/investment accounts shall be updated back into the CBS automatically, wherever applicable, through STP. 2.11 Banks shall keep the business logic and other parameters/ configurations of the System updated to ensure that the System based identification, classification, provisioning and income recognition are strictly in compliance with the regulatory guidelines  on an ongoing basis. There should be periodic system audit, at least once in a year, by Internal / External Auditors who are well versed with the system audit both on system parameters as also from the perspective of compliance to Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning guidelines.  General: 2.12 Banks may draw up their standard operating procedure (SOP) for S ystem based NPA classification for usage by the operating staff. 2.13 Baseline requirements for the NPA classification have been provided in the Annex. \nBanks are required to adhere to these instructions while designing and maintaining the System.  3. The adherence to these instructions will be examined as part of supervisory assessment of the banks and in case of non-compliance, suitable supervisory / enforcement action shall be initiated against the concerned bank.  Yours faithfully,   (Ajay Kumar Choudhary) Chief General Manager Encl: As above (Annex)     \n  \n4 Annex Baseline Requirements for the NPA classification Solution  I. Data Input 1. Data Input in the system by any means should be fully captured and stored without truncation [For example, time stamp - with date and time, narration field, or any other text data captured]. 2. Ensure presence of necessary validation/verification checks in the solution for the user inputs, wherever applicable. Such validations, among other things should check for data type validations, min/max value, exceptions, etc. 3. Ensure necessary data validation/checks in the system for the data keyed in manually, wherever applicable. For example, such validations with master data (or parameters used in asset classification fed into the system as per the internal policy of the bank) could prevent issues related to incorrect entries generally seen (illustrative but not exhaustive list) in margin setting, moratorium period, security valuation, repayment schedule, products mapped/linked to different categories of account holders (as per applicability) etc.  4. Data input shall be effected only after authentication and authorisation.   II. User Access Management 5. Ensure that all \u201cuser-ids\u201d in the solution have unique identification. If there are any generic user-ids used, it should only be used under exceptional circumstances and such ids should be mandatorily mapped to the employee ID of the user to fix accountability of the activities carried-out under the generic ID. 6. Provide for two-factor or higher level of authentication for the users of the application. 7. Restrict the access to the solution on \u201cneed to have/least privilege\u201d basis for all users.  8. Provide for maker checker authorisation /control for transactions (an illustrative list of transactions includes updating/modifying the internal accounts, customer accounts, parameters \u2013 both financial and non-financial that affect the status of the credit portfolio/loan/asset.) entered in the solution. This shall also include transactions/activities carried out by administrator accounts in the application. (For example: Activities such as create/update/modify user-ids, roles, privileges including access rights to various modules;  system related activities including updates to master data, etc. should have at least two individuals to complete the activity).   \n  \n5  \nIII. Straight Through Processing (STP) 9. Provide for straight-through processing (STP) and support for STP integration with all critical systems/add-on sub-systems/modules etc., in a seamless and secure manner for NPA/NPI classification as per extant guidelines on IRAC. Such STP mechanism shall seamlessly take into account all the facilities availed by a given customer  (in case of advances) and all the instruments of an entity (where bank has made investments in an entity), maintained across multiple systems of the bank without any manual intervention. Further, banks shall also ensure that the updated account status, including asset classification of the customer accounts, flow to the CBS automatically, if NPA classification process is performed outside CBS.   IV. Back-end Data Access Restriction 10. Any changes to the data, parameters from backend sh all be avoided. The solution should provide for changes to the data items only through front end (from the application (Ex: CBS) itself and not through the backend database update) after requisite authorisation. Audit trails/logs of access, changes to any data, parameters, if any, should be captured with specific user details in the system. 11. In case of exceptions in rare circumstances, such changes should be duly approved at an appropriate level and documented. Provision for MIS report should be available to auditors to generate complete list of back-end access and changes made.   V. Audit Logs  12. Provisions of audit trails/logs to capture details of mandatory fields (that are essential to complete the transaction and essential to identify the transaction for  audit/forensic purpose in the future) of all the transactions (financial and non-financial) shall be made. 13. Logs should be maintained for changing the master data. System generated activity logs of the users with administrative privileges should also be maintained. 14. Secure storage and retention of logs in encrypted format with access controls in a n archival solution.     \n  \n6 VI. System Generated NPAs  15. All parameters required for NPA/NPI identification shall be captured in the CBS or associated sub-system(s)/module(s) meant for NPA/NPI identification/classification of asset codes as per Income Recognition and Asset Classification (IRAC) norms and extant instructions. It should provide for separate MIS report capturing all parameters for NPA /NPI identification. Such parameters could either be configured in database or application itself as per the architecture of the solution/sub-system.   VII. Test Environment  16. The existing test environment in the bank with dummy data and functional logic similar to that of the product environment of the solution shall be made available to the supervisors during their onsite supervisory visit(s) as per the requirements. This shall be required, inter alia, to perform sample transactions review to assess whether the solution adheres in complying with regulatory prescriptions in the extant environment for NPA /NPI identification as per applicability.      ************************* ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT372E157BAAD1114EFCA3055B5EC99ECB18.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Sep 11, 2020", "info": " \n\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\ufffd \ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0915\ufffd \ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928, 12\u0935\ufffd/ 13\u0935\ufffd \u092e\u0902\u093f\u095b\u0932, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400001 \u091f\u0947\u0932\u0940\u092b\u094b\u0928/ Tel No: 22661602, 22601000 \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938/ Fax No: 022-2270 5691 Department of Regulation, Central Office, Central Office Building, 12\nth/ 13th Floor, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  Mumbai - 400001  \n  \n\"Caution: RBI never sends mails, SMSs or makes calls asking for personal information like bank account details, passwords, et c.

The Reserve Bank had accordingly set up an Expert Committee with Shri K. V. Kamath as the Chairperson, as announced in the press release dated August 7, 2020\n. The Expert \nCommittee has since submitted its recommendations to the Reserve Bank on September 4, \n2020 , which have been broadly accepted by the Reserve Bank. \n3. Accordingly, all lending institutions shall mandatorily consider the following key ratios while finalizing the resolution plans in respect of eligible borrowers under Part B of the Annex to the Resolution Framework: \nKey Ratio  Definition  \nTotal Outside Liabilities / \nAdjusted Tangible Net \nWorth (TOL/ATNW) Addition of long -term debt, short term debt, current \nliabilities and provisions along with deferred tax liability \ndivided by tangible net worth net of the investments and \nloans in the group and outside entities. \nTotal Debt / EBI TDA Addition of short term and long -term debt divided by \naddition of profit before tax, interest and finance charges \nalong with depreciation and amortisation. \n2  Current Rat io Current assets divided by current liabilities  \nDebt Service Coverage \nRatio (DSCR) For the relevant year addition of net cash accruals along with \ninterest and finance charges divided by addition of current portion of long term debt with interest and finance charges.  \nAverage Debt Service \nCoverage Ratio (ADSCR)  Over the period of the loan addition of net cash accruals \nalong with interest and finance charges divided by addition of current portion of long term debt with interest and finance charges. \n 4. The sector-specific thresholds (ceilings or floors, as the case may be) for each of the above key ratios that should be considered by the lending institutions in the resolution assumptions with respect to an eligible borrower are given in the Annex\n. In respect of those sectors where \nthe sector-specific thresholds have not been specified, lending institutions shall make their own internal assessments regarding TOL/ATNW and Total Debt/EBI TDA. However, the current ratio and DSCR in all cases shall be 1.0 and above, and ADSCR shall be 1.2 and above.  \n5. Lending institutions are free to consider other financial parameters as well while finalizing the resolution assumptions in respect of eligible borrowers apart from the above mandatory ke y ratios and the sector-specific thresholds that have been prescribed. The above requirements are applicable even in cases when there is only one lending institution with exposure to an eligible borrower. 6. The ratios prescribed in paragraph 4 are intended as floors or ceilings, as the case may be, but the resolution plans shall take into account\n the pre-Covid-19 operating and financial performance of the borrower and impact of Covid-19 on its operating and financial performance at the time of finalising the resolution plan, to assess the cashflows in subsequent years, while stipulating  appropriate ratios in each case.  \n7. Given the differential impact of the pandemic on various sectors/entities, the lending institutions may, at their discretion, adopt a graded approach depending on the severity of the impact on the borrowers, while preparing or implementing the resolution plan. Such graded approach may also entail classification of the impact on the borrowers into mild, moderate and severe, as recommended by the Committee.  8. Lending institutions are expected to ensure compliance to TOL/ATNW agreed as per the resolution plan at the time of implementation itself. Nevertheless, in all cases, this ratio shall have to be maintained as per the resolution plan by March 31, 2022 and on an ongoing basis thereafter. However, wherever the resolution plan envisages equity infusion, the same may  be suitably phased-in over this period. All other key ratios shall have to be maintained as per the resolution plan by March 31, 2022 and on an ongoing basis thereafter.  9. The compliance in regard to meeting the agreed ratios must be monitored as financial covenants on an ongoing basis, and during subsequent credi t reviews. Any such breach not rectified within a reasonable period, in terms of the loan contract, will be considered as financial difficulty.  Other Clarifications - Applicability of ICA and Escrow account 10. The various requirements of the Resolution Framework, especially the mandatory requirement of ICA, wherever applicable, and maintenance of an escrow account after implementation of a resolution plan, shall be applicable at the borrower -account level, i.e. the 3  legal entities to which the lending institutions have exposure to, which could include a special purpose vehicle having a legal-entity status, set up for a project. 11. It is further clarified that signing of ICA is a mandatory requirement for all lending institutions in all cases involving multiple lending institutions, where the resolution process is invoked, and the requirement of additional provisions if the ICA is not signed within 30 days of invocation does not substitute for the mandatory nature of ICA. Compliance with this regulatory requirement shall be assessed for all lending institutions as part of the supervisory review.

Consequently, average DSCR threshold is also not prescribed.  \n##In the roads sector, the financing  is cash flow based and at SPV level where the level of debt is  decided at the time of initial project appraisal. The working capital cycle in this sector is also negative. Accordingly, ratios like TOL / ATNW, Debt/EBITDA and Current ratio may not be relevant at the time of restructuring in this sector. \n@Most of the companies in the sector do not use long term debt for funding their operations and are unlisted. Hence DSCR and average DSCR may not be relevant for the sector.  \n  ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/34COVID19122F09F4AE2A4C96B5A89E8250A5FF7F.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Sep 05, 2020", "info": "\u092a\u092f\ufffd\u0935\u0947\ufffd\u0923 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\u0947 \ufffd \u0940 \u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\ufffd\u0932\u092f, \u0935\ufffd\ufffd \u091f\ufffd\u0947\u0921 \u0938\ufffd\u091f\u0930, \u0938\ufffd\u091f\u0930-1, \u0915\u092b \u092a\u0930\u0947\u0921, \u0915\u094b\u0932\u093e\u092c\u093e, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 \u2013 400 005 \u091f\u0947\u0932\u0940\u092b\u094b\u0928: 022- 2216 3395 \u092b\u0948 \ufffd: 022-2218 0157  \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932 - cgmicdosco@rbi.org.in \nDepartment of Supervision, Central Office, World Trade Centre, Centre I, Cuffe Parade, Colaba, Mumbai - 400 005 Tel: 022-2216 3395 Fax: 022-2218 0157 e-mail:  cgmicdosco@rbi.org.in \n\u092c\ufffd\u0915 \u093f\u0939\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 \u092e\ufffd \u092a\ufffd\u093e\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0917\u0924 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964\nRBI/2020-21/33 Ref.No.DOS.CO.PPG./SEC.01/11.01.005/2020-21 September 05, 2020 \nThe Chairman / Managing Director / Chief Executive Officer All Scheduled Commercial Banks (Excluding RRBs) All Local Area Banks All Small Finance Banks and All Payment Banks \nM\nadam /Dear Sir, \nLong Form Audit Report (LFAR) - Review \nPlease refer to RBI circular No. DBS.CO.PP.BC.11/11.01.005/2001-2002 dated April 17, 2002 on revision of Long Form Audit Report (LFAR). \n2.

The appendix\n to this questionnaire \nadditionally contains questions, which are relevant to the specialized branches dealing in foreign exchange transactions, branches having very large advances, recovery of non- performing assets (NPA) and clearing house operations, if any. Auditors of foreign branches of Indian banks should also furnish this report. In the case of foreign branches, reference to Reserve Bank of India should be construed to include Reserve Bank of India, as well as the relevant regulating authority of the foreign country where the branch is located\n.  A. Guiding principles on objective, strategy, scope and coverage of LFAR for branch auditors i. The overall objective of the branch audit should be to have transaction testing and provide inputs to the Statutory central Auditors on adequacy of implementation of various policy and regulatory requirements, including efficacy of the system and assurance functions (risk management, compliance and internal audit) at branch level.   ii. The threshold fixed for different purposes  for comments in the LFAR will decide that above the threshold, the transaction detailing needs to be seen and commented upon. However, below the threshold, the system and processes should be checked and commented upon.  \niii. Verification of data integrity and data related control systems and processes should be \ncarried out and commented upon, with the special thrust on those data inputs  which are \nto be used for MIS at corporate office level and for supervisory reporting purposes . \niv.  Where any of the comments made by the auditors in their LFAR is adverse, they should \nconsider whether a qualification in their main report is necessary. It should not, \nhowever, be assumed that every adverse comment in the LFAR would necessarily result \nin a qualification in the main report. In deciding whether a qualification in the main \nreport is necessary, the auditors should use their professional judgment in the facts and \ncircumstances of each case.     B.

Accordingly, from FY 2021 -22 onwards, a higher w eight (125%) \nwould be assigned to the incremental  priority sector credit  in the identified districts \nwhere the credit flow is comparatively low er (per capi ta PSL less than \u20b96000) , and a \nlower weight (90%) would be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in  the \nidentified districts where the credit flow is comparatively high er (per capita PSL \ngreater than \u20b925,000) . The list of both categories of districts is given in Annex IA  & \nIB. This list will be valid for a period up to FY 2023 -24 and will be reviewed thereafter. \nThe districts other than those mentioned in Annex IA and IB will continue to have \nexisting weightage of 100%.  \n  \nThe b anks should continue to report the actual outstanding amount  in QPSA  returns  \nas hitherto. Adjustments for weights to incremental PSL credit will be done by RBI , \nbased on reporting of district wise credit flow to FIDD, CO through the A DEPT  \ndatabase.

The policy should also prescribe differential time schedules for review/renewal of borrower limits so that lower rated borrowers whose financials show signs of problems are subjected to renewal control more frequently. The \nMaster Circular for Urban \nCooperative Banks (UCBs) on Management of Advances \u2013  UCBs dated July 1, 2015 , \nrequires all UCBs to lay down policy guidelines for periodic review of the working capital limits.  \n 2. Further, in terms of the \nMaster Circular DBR.No.BP.BC.2/21.04.048/2015-16 dated \nJuly 1, 2015  on Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and \nProvisioning pertaining to Advances and the Master Circular DCBR.BPD. (PCB) MC \nNo.12/09.14.000/2015-16 dated July 1, 2015  on Income Recognition, Asset \nClassification, Provisioning and Other Related Matters \u2013 UCBs as applicable to SCBs and UCBs respectively, an account where the regular/ad-hoc credit limits have not been reviewed/renewed within the prescribed timeline from the due date/date of ad- hoc sanction will be treated as Non-Performing Asset.    \n2  \n3. Banks are, therefore, expected to have a detailed Board approved policy on methodology and periodicity for review/renewal of credit facilities within the overall regulatory guidelines, and adhere to the same strictly.   4. However, an analysis of practices followed by the lenders while reviewing/renewing credit facilities has brought out certain supervisory concerns, including that of frequent/repeated ad-hoc review/renewal of credit facilities instead of regular review/renewals, non-capturing and/or inaccurate capturing of review/renewal data in the banking/information systems, and non-coverage of review/renewal activities under the concurrent audit/internal audit mechanism.  5. In this connection, we reiterate that timely and comprehensive review/renewal of credit facilities should be an integral part of the Board approved loan policy and credit risk management framework, and banks should avoid frequent and repeated ad- hoc/short review/renewal of credit facilities without justifiable reasons. Banks are also advised to capture all the data relating to regular as well as ad -hoc/short review/renewal of credit facilities in their core banking systems/management information systems and make the same available for scrutiny as and when required by any audit or inspection by Auditors/RBI.

While computing Adjusted Net Worth (ANW), the am ount\nrepresenting any direct or indirect capital contribution made by  one CIC in another CIC, to\nthe extent such amount exceeds ten per cent of Owned Funds  of the investing CIC, shall be\ndeducted. All other terms and conditions for computation of ANW remain the sam e.\n2.2 The deduction requirement shall take immediate effect for any investment made by a CIC \nin another CIC after date of issue of this circular. In cases where the investment by a CIC in \nanother CIC is already in excess of 10 percent as on the date of this circular, the CIC need \nnot deduct the excess investment as on the date of this circular from owned funds for \ncomputation of its ANW till March 31, 2023. \n3.G roup Structure\n3.1 To address the complexity in group structures and existence of multiple CICs within a\ngroup, it has been decided that the number of layers of CIC s within a Group (including the\nparent CIC) shall be restricted to two, irrespective of the extent of direct or indirect holding/\ncontrol exercised by a CIC in the other CIC. If a CIC makes any direct/ indirect equity\ninvestment in another CIC, it will be deemed as a layer for the investing CIC.

The Payment System Vision-2021 of Reserve Bank highlights the need for technology- driven, rule-based, customer-friendly and transparent dispute redressal systems. As a step in this direction, authorised Payment System Operators (PSOs) \u2013 banks and non-banks \u2013 and their participants are hereby advised to put in place system/s for ODR for resolving disputes and grievances of customers.   3. To begin with, authorised PSOs shall be required to implement an ODR system for disputes and grievances related to failed transactions in their  respective payment systems by January 1, 2021. The PSOs shall provide access to such a system to its participating members i.e., Payment System Participants (PSPs). Any entity setting up a payment system in India thereafter or participating therein, shall make available the ODR system at the commencement of its operations. The minimum requirements of the ODR system are specified in Annex\n.  \n   \n  4. Based on experience gained, ODR arrangement would later be extended to cover disputes and grievances other than those related to failed transactions. Please note that if the grievance remains unresolved up to one month, the customer may approach the \nReserve Bank - \nIntegrated Ombudsman Scheme, 2021  (as amended from time to time).  \n 5. This directive is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).  Yours faithfully,  (P. Vasudevan) Chief General Manager  Encl. : As above      \n Annex  DPSS.CO.PD No. 116 / 02.12.004 / 2020-21 dated August 6, 2020   \nMinimum Requirements of the ODR System \n1. Applicability \n1.1. These requirements apply to all authorised Payment Systems Operators (PSOs) \u2013  banks and non-banks \u2013 and their participating members [Payment System Participants ( PSPs)].   \n2. Concept of the ODR system \n2.1. The ODR system should be a transparent, rule-based, system-driven, user-friendly and unbiased mechanism for resolving customer disputes and grievances, with zero or minimal manual intervention.  \n3. Structure of the ODR system \n3.1. Each PSO shall make available an ODR system for resolving disputes and grievances arising out of failed transactions and provide the participating PSPs an access to the system. 3.2. The PSO and its PSPs shall provide the customers an access for lodging the disputes and grievances relating to failed transactions, irrespective of such transactions being on-us or off-us in nature.   \n4. Types of transactions covered under the scope of the ODR system  \n4.1. To begin with, disputes and grievances relating to failed transactions shall be covered under the ODR system. The scope, thus, includes all transaction types mentioned in the RBI circular DPSS.CO.PD No.629/02.01.014/2019-20 dated September 20, 2019\n on \n\u201cHarmonisation of Turn Around Time (TAT) and customer compensation for failed transactions using authorised Payment Systems\u201d.  \n4.2. All provisions, including those relating to TAT and compensation to customers mentioned in the above circular need to be adhered to while resolving disputes and grievances using the ODR system.  \n5. Lodging and tracking of disputes and grievances \n5.1. Customers shall be provided with one or more channels \u2013 web-based or paper-based complaint form, IVR, mobile application, call centre, SMS, through branches or offices, etc. \u2013 for lodging disputes and grievances. As mentioned above, such facility shall be  \n provided by the PSO as well as by the PSP (the issuer institutions with whom the customer has a relationship) with a mechanism to link / access the ODR system put in place by the PSO. The industry may progressively increase the variety of these channels .  5.2. In addition to the above channels, in case of mobile phone-based systems like Unified Payments Interface (UPI), third party app providers (TPAPs) shall also provide customers with a facility to lodge disputes and grievances through the same mobile app used for making payments, which shall be integrated with the ODR system. 5.3. The process of lodging the dispute or grievance shall be simple and involve only necessary minimum details. The ODR system should be made capable of automatically fetching full details based on the information provided by the customer. The aspect of data confidentiality shall specifically be taken care of while designing such parameters. 5.4. Once a customer has lodged the dispute or grievance, a unique reference number shall be allocated by the ODR system. Facility shall be provided to the customers for tracking the status of the dispute or grievance using this reference number.   --------------------------- ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/21ODR602F0A579EB246AA885776A76122DB0C.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Aug 06, 2020", "info": "  RBI/2020-21/20 DOR.No.BP.BC/7/21.04.048/2020-21                       August 6, 2020 All Scheduled Commercial Banks All Payments Banks  Madam/Dear Sir,  Opening of Current Accounts by Banks - Need for Discipline  Please refer to the circular DBR.Leg.BC.25./09.07.005/2015- 16 dated July 2, 2015\n on the \nsubject. The instructions on opening of current accounts by banks have been reviewed and the revised instructions are as under: \ni. No bank shall open current accounts for customers who have availed credit facilities in the form of cash credit (CC)/ overdraft (OD) from the  banking system and all transactions shall be routed through the CC/OD account.  ii. Where a bank\u2019s exposure\n1 to a borrower is less than 10 per cent of the exposure of the banking system to that borrower, while credits are freely permitted, debits to the CC/OD account can only be for credit to the CC/OD account of that borrower with a bank that has 10 per cent  or more of the exposure of the banking system to that borrower. Funds will be remitted from these accounts to the said transferee CC/OD account at the frequency agreed between the bank and the borrower. Further, the credit balances in such accounts shall not be used as margin for availing any non- fund based credit facilities. In case there is more than one bank having 10 per cent or more of the exposure of the banking system to that borrower, the bank to which the funds are to be remitted may be decided mutually between the borrower and the banks. It may be noted that banks with exposure to the borrower of less than 10 per cent of the exposure of the banking system can offer working capital demand loan (WCDL) / working capital term loan (WCTL) facility to the borrower. \n                                                           \n1 \u2018Exposure\u2019 for the purpose of these instructions shall mean sum of sanctioned fund based and non- fund based credit facilities \n2  \n  \n \niii. Where a bank has a share of 10 per cent or more in the total exposure of the banking system to the borrower, it can provide CC/OD facility as hitherto. iv. In case of borrowers covered under guidelines on loan system for delivery of bank credit issued vide \ncircular DBR.BP.BC.No.12/21.04.048/2018-19 dated \nDecember 5, 2018 , bifurcation of working capital facility into loan component \nand cash credit component shall henceforth be maintained at individual bank level in all cases, including consortium lending.\n v. In case of customers who have not availed CC/OD facility from any bank, banks may open current accounts as under: a) In case of borrowers where exposure of the banking system is \u20b950 crore or more, banks shall be required to put in place an escrow mechanism. Accordingly, current accounts of such borrowers can only be opened/maintained by the escrow managing bank. However, there is no restriction on opening of \u2018collection accounts\u2019 by lending banks subject to the condition that funds will be remitted from these accounts to the said escrow account at the frequency agreed between the bank and the borrower. Further, the balances in such accounts shall not be used as margin for availing any non-fund based credit facilities. While there is no prohibition on amount or number of credits in \u2018collection accounts\u2019, debits in these accounts shall be limited to the purpose of remitting the proceeds to the said escrow account. Non-lending banks shall not open any current account for such borrowers. b) In case of borrowers where exposure of the banking system is \u20b9 5 crore or more but less than \u20b950 crore, there is no restriction on opening of current accounts by the lending banks. However, non-lending banks may open only collection accounts as defined at (v) (a) above.  c) In case of borrowers where exposure of the banking system is less than \u20b95 crore, banks may open current accounts subject to obtaining an undertaking from such customers to the effect that customers shall inform the bank(s), if and when the credit facilities availed by them from the banking system becomes \u20b95 crore or more. The current account of such customers, as and when the exposure of the banking system becomes \u20b95 crore or more and \u20b950 crore or more, will be governed by the provisions of para (v) (b) and (v) (a) respectively. 3  \n  \n \nd) Banks are free to open current accounts of prospective customers who have not availed any credit facilities from the banking system, subject to necessary due diligence as per their Board approved policies.   2. Banks shall monitor all current accounts and CC/ODs regularly, at least on a quarterly basis, specifically with respect to the exposure of the banking system to the borrower, to ensure compliance with these instructions.   3. Banks should not route drawal from term loans through current accounts. Since term loans are meant for specific purposes, the funds should be remitted directly to the supplier of goods and services. Expenses incurred by the borrower for day to day operations should be routed through CC/OD account, if the borrower has a CC/OD account, else through a current account.   4. As regards existing current and CC/OD accounts, banks shall ensure compliance with the above instructions within a period of three months from the date of this circular.

Such wide spread impact could impair the entire recovery process, posing significant financial stability risks . \n                                                 \n1 The term \u201cPrudential Framework\u201d, wherever used in this circular, refers to the \u201c Prudential \nFramework for Resolution of Stressed Assets) Directions 2019, dated June 7, 2019 \u2019\u2019. \n2  3. Considering the above, with the intent to facilitate revival of real sector activities and mitigate the impact on the ultimate borrowers, it has been decided to provide a window under the Prudential Framework to enable the lenders to implement a resolution plan in respect of eligible corporate exposures without change in ownership, and personal loans, while classifying such exposures as Standard, subject to specified conditions. The details of the facility are given in the Annex.  \n4. The lending institutions shall ensure that the resolution under this facility is extended only to borrowers having stress on account of Covid19. Further, the lending institutions will be required to assess the viability of the resolution plan, subject to the prudential boundaries laid out in this Annex\n. Towards this end, each \nlending institution shall put in place a Board approved policy detailing the manner in which such evaluation may be done and the objective criteria that may be applied while considering the resolution plan in each case.  \n5. Accounts which do not fulfill the required eligibility conditions to be considered for resolution under this framework may continue to be considered for resolution under the Prudential Framework, or the relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions where the Prudential Framework is not applicable.  6. While the Prudential Framework is otherwise not applicable to certain categories of lending institutions to which this circular is addressed, exposures of these lending institutions shall also be included for any resolution under this facility. Consequently, without prejudice to the specific conditions applicable to this facility, all the norms applicable to implementation of a resolution plan, including the mandatory requirement of Inter-Creditor Agreements (ICA) and specific implementation conditions, as laid out in the Prudential Framework shall be applicable to all lending institutions for any resolution plan  implemented under this facility. Terms used in this document, to the extent not defined herein, shall have the same meaning assigned to them in the Prudential Framework.   Yours faithfully, (Saurav Sinha) Chief General Manager-in-Charge 3   Annex Conditions for the Resolution Framework for COVID-19-related Stress   1. The framework shall be applicable to eligible borrowers \u2013  corporate persons or otherwise \u2013 subject to the conditions specified herein. Part A of this Annex pertains to requirements specific to resolution of personal loans  and Part B pertains to resolution of other eligible borrowers. Part C prescribes the prudential treatment of the exposures in respect of which resolution plans  are implemented under this facility while Part D lists the disclosure requirements for the lending institutions with respect to the resolution plans implemented under this framework. For this purpose, lending institution shall mean the entities to which the covering circular is addressed. 2. Without prejudice to the exceptions specified in paragraphs 25- 28 of the Prudential Framework, the following categories of borrowers / credit facilities shall not be eligible for a resolution plan under this framework: a. MSME borrowers whose aggregate exposure to lending institutions  collectively, is `25 crore or less as on March 1, 2020. b. Farm credit as listed in Paragraph 6.1 of Master Direction \nFIDD.CO.Plan.1/04.09.01/2016-17 dated July 7, 2016 (as updated)  or \nother relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions. \nc. Loans to Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), Farmers' Service Societies (FSS) and Large-sized Adivasi Multi- Purpose Societies (LAMPS) for on-lending to agriculture. d. Exposures of lending institutions to financial service providers\n2.  \n                                                 \n2 Financial service providers shall have the same meaning as in sub- section (17) of Section 3 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act, 2016. 4  e. Exposures of lending institutions to Central and State Governments; Local Government bodies (eg. Municipal Corporations); and, body corporates established by an Act of Parliament or State Legislature.  f. Exposures of housing finance companies where the account has been rescheduled in terms of para 2(1)(zc)(ii) of the Master Circular -  The Housing Finance Companies (NHB) Directions, 2010 after March 1, 2020, unless a resolution plan under this framework has been invoked by other lending institutions. However, from the date of this circular, any resolution necessitated on account of the economic fallout of Covid-19 pandemic, shall be undertaken only under this framework.   3. The lending institutions shall frame Board approved policies pertaining to implementation of viable resolution plans for eligible borrowers under this framework, ensuring that the resolution under this facility is provided only to the borrowers having stress on account of Covid19. The Board approved policy shall, inter alia, detail the eligibility of borrowers in respect of whom the lending institutions may be willing to consider the resolution, and shall lay down the due diligence considerations to be followed by the lending institutions to establish the necessity of implementing a resolution plan in respect of the concerned borrower. 4. The reference date for the outstanding amount of debt that may be considered for resolution shall be March 1, 2020.   A. Resolution of Stress in Personal Loans 5. This part shall be applicable to resolution of personal loans3 sanctioned to individual borrowers by lending institutions. However, credit facilities provided by lending institutions to their own personnel/staff shall not be eligible for resolution under this framework. \n                                                 \n3 \u2018Personal loans\u2019, for the purpose of this circular shall have the same meaning as defined in the Circular DBR.No.BP.BC.99/08.13.100/2017-18 dated January 4, 2018\n on \u201cXBRL Returns \u2013 \nHarmonization of Banking Statistics\u201d.  5  6. Only those borrower accounts shall be eligible for resolution under this framework which were classified as standard, but not in default for more than 30 days with the lending institution as on March 1, 2020.  7. The eligible borrowers\u2019 accounts should continue to be classified as Standard till the date of invocation of resolution under this framework. For this purpose, the date of invocation shall be the date on which both the borrower and lending institution have agreed to proceed with a resolution plan under this framework. 8. Resolution under this framework may be invoked not later than December 31, 2020 and must be implemented within 90 days from the date of invocation. However, the lending institutions should strive for early invocation.  9. The resolution plans may inter alia include rescheduling of payments, conversion of any interest accrued, or to be accrued, into another credit facility, or, granting of moratorium, based on an assessment of income streams of the borrower, subject to a maximum of two years. Correspondingly, the overall tenor of the loan may also get modified commensurately. The moratorium period, if granted, shall come into force immediately upon implementation of the resolution plan.  10.  The resolution plan shall be deemed to be implemented only if all of the following conditions are met: a. all related documentation, including execution of necessary agreements between lending institutions and borrower and collaterals provided, if any, are completed by the lenders concerned in consonance with the resolution plan being implemented; b. the changes in the terms of conditions of the loans get duly reflected in the books of the lending institutions; and, c. borrower is not in default with the lending institution as per the revised terms. 11.  Any resolution plan implemented in breach of the above stipulated timeline shall be fully governed by the Prudential Framework, or the relevant 6  instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions where the Prudential Framework is not applicable.  B. Resolution of Other Exposures 12.  This part shall be applicable to all other eligible exposures of lending institutions not covered in Part \u2018A\u2019. 13.  Only those borrower accounts shall be eligible for resolution under this framework which were classified as standard, but not in default for more than 30 days with any lending institution as on March 1, 2020. Further, the accounts should continue to remain standard till the date of invocation.   14.  In case where there is only one lending institution with exposure to the borrower, the decision regarding the request for resolution by the borrower may be taken by the lending institution as per the Board approved policy of the institution and within the contours of this framework. For this purpose, the date of invocation shall be the date on which both the borrower and lending institution have agreed to proceed with a resolution plan under this framework.  15.  If there are multiple lending institutions with exposure to the borrower, t he resolution process shall be treated as invoked in respect of any borrower i f lending institutions representing 75 per cent by value of the total outstanding credit facilities (fund based as well non-fund based), and not less than 60 per cent of lending institutions by number agree to invoke the same.  16.  Resolution under this framework may be invoked not later  than December 31, 2020 and must be implemented within 180 days from the date of invocation.   17.  In all cases involving multiple lending institutions, where the resolution process is invoked and consequently a resolution plan has to be implemented, ICA shall be required to be signed by all lending institutions within 30 days from the date of invocation. In case of housing finance companies, this shall be applicable irrespective of whether the account has been rescheduled in terms of para 2(1)(zc)(ii) of the Master Circular - The Housing Finance Companies (NHB) Directions, 2010.  7  18.  In cases where the resolution process has been invoked but lending institutions representing not less than 75 per cent by value of the total outstanding credit facilities (fund based as well non-fund based) and not less than 60 per cent of lending institutions by number, do not sign the ICA within 30 days from the invocation, the invocation will be treated as lapsed. In respect of such borrowers, the resolution process cannot be invoked again under this framework. 19.  Lenders to the borrower which are other than the lending institutions as per this circular may also sign the ICA, if they so desire. If such lenders sign the ICA, they shall be fully bound by the stipulations of the ICA . 20.  All disputes, if any, between signatories to the ICA regarding the resolution process shall be settled as per the provisions of the ICA  and the Reserve Bank will not intermediate any such disputes. Lending institutions shall ensure that the ICA contains such a dispute redressal mechanism  that clearly lays down the recourse available to a signatory to the ICA who wants to raise a dispute. 21.  As the resolution process requirements and the prudential treatment subsequent to the implementation are applied collectively to all lenders, including those to which the Prudential Framework is not applicable, the ICA should provide for suitable mechanisms for information sharing amongst lending institutions during and after implementation of the resolution plan. 22.  If any of the above timelines are breached at any point, the resolution process ceases to apply immediately in respect of the borrower concerned. Any resolution plan implemented in breach of the above stipulated timelines shall be fully governed by the Prudential Framework , or the relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions where the Prudential Framework is not applicable, as if the resolution process was never invoked under this framework. Expert Committee  23.  The Reserve Bank shall constitute a Committee which shall recommend a list of financial parameters which, in their opinion would be required to be 8  factored into the assumptions that go into each resolution plan, and the sector specific benchmark ranges for such parameters. The parameters shall inter alia cover aspects related to leverage, liquidity, debt serviceability etc.  The Committee shall be called the Expert Committee.   24.  The Expert Committee shall submit such list of financial parameters and the sector-specific desirable ranges for such parameters to the Reserve Bank, which, in turn, will notify the same, along with modifications, if any, within 30 days.  25.  The Expert Committee shall also have the responsibility of vetting the resolution plans to be implemented under this window in respect of all accounts where the aggregate exposure of the lending institutions at the time of invocation of the resolution process is `1500 crore and above. The Committee shall check and verify that all the processes have been followed by the parties concerned as desired without interfering with the commercial judgments exercised by the lenders. 26.  The Expert Committee shall have its secretariat at the Indian Banks\u2019 Association. The compensation to the members of the Committee and all expenses related to the Committee and its secretariat shall be borne by the Reserve Bank.  Permitted features of the resolution plan  27.  The resolution plan may involve any action as provided in Paragraph 13 of the \u201cPrudential Framework\u201d, except compromise settlements which shall continue to be governed by the provisions of the Prudential Framework  or the relevant instructions, if any, applicable to specific category of lending institutions where the Prudential Framework is not applicable.  The resolution plan may also include sanctioning of additional credit facilities to address the financial stress of the borrower on account of Covid19 even if there is no renegotiation of existing debt. 28.  The lending institutions may allow extension of the residual tenor of the loan, with or without payment moratorium, by a period not more than two years. The 9  moratorium period, if granted, shall come into force immediately upon implementation of the resolution plan.  29.  The revised assumptions that go into the plan shall, at the minimum, factor in the financial parameters decided by the Expert Committee and the ranges for such parameters, as notified by the Reserve Bank. Conversion into other securities and valuation 30.  The resolution plan may provide for conversion of a portion of the debt into equity or other marketable, non-convertible debt securities issued by the borrower, provided the amortisation schedule and the coupon carried by such debt securities are similar to the terms of the debt held on the books of the lending institutions, post implementation of the resolution plan. The holding of such instruments by the respective lending institutions shall be subject to the extant instructions on investments as applicable to them.  31.  The valuation of equity instruments issued, if any, shall be governed by the provisions of Paragraphs 19(c) and 19(d) of the Annex to the Prudential Framework whereas debt securities shall be valued as per the instructions compiled at Paragraph 3.7.1 of the Master Circular - Prudential Norms for \nClassification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated \nJuly 1, 2015  (as amended from time to time), or other relevant instructions as \napplicable to specific category of lending institutions. \n32.  In case the lending institutions convert any portion of the debt into any other security, the same shall collectively be valued at Re.1. Other features 33.  Resolution plans in respect of accounts where the aggregate exposure of the lending institutions at the time of invocation of the resolution process  is `100 crore and above, shall require an independent credit evaluation (ICE)  by any one credit rating agency (CRA) authorized by the Reserve Bank under the Prudential Framework. 34.  The resolution plan shall further provide that in accounts involving consortium or multiple banking arrangements, post implementation of the plan , all receipts 10  by the borrower, all repayments by the borrower to the lending institutions, as well as all additional disbursements, if any, to the borrower by the lending institutions as part of the resolution plan, shall be routed through an escrow account maintained with one of the lending institutions.  35.  To ensure that the above operations are carried out smoothly, lending institutions shall enter into a formal agreement with the escrow manager detailing the duties and responsibilities of the escrow manager and the lending institutions, as well as the enforcement mechanism that will be contractually available to the escrow manager to ensure that lending institutions service their disbursement obligations on a timely basis.  C. Asset classification and provisioning 36.  Additional finance to borrowers in respect of whom the resolution plan has been invoked, if sanctioned even before implementation of the plan in order to meet the interim liquidity requirements of the borrower, may be classified as \u2018standard asset\u2019 till implementation of the plan regardless of the actual performance of the borrower with respect to such facilities in the interim.  37.  However, if the resolution plan is not implemented within the stipulated timelines, the asset classification of the additional finance sanctioned will be as per the actual performance of the borrower with respect to the additional finance or the rest of the credit facilities, whichever is worse.  38.  If a resolution  plan is implemented in adherence to the provisions of this facility, the asset classification of borrowers\u2019 accounts classified as Standard may be retained as such upon implementation, whereas the borrowers\u2019 accounts which may have slipped into NPA between invocation and implementation may be upgraded as Standard, as on the date of implementation of the plan. 39.  In respect of personal loans where a resolution plan is implemented under this facility, the lending institutions shall keep provisions from the date of implementation, which are higher of the provisions held  as per the extant IRAC norms immediately before implementation, or 10 percent of the 11  renegotiated debt exposure of the lending institution post implementation (residual debt). 40.  In other cases where a resolution plan is implemented under this facility, the lending institutions, which had signed the ICA within 30 days of invocation,  shall keep provisions from the date of implementation, which are higher of the provisions held as per the extant IRAC norms immediately before implementation, or 10 percent of the total debt, including the debt securities issued in terms of clause 30, held by the ICA signatories post-implementation of the plan (residual debt).  41.  However, lending institutions which did not sign the ICA within 30 days of invocation shall, immediately upon the expiry of 30 days,  keep provisions of 20 per cent of the debt on  their books as on this date (carrying debt), or the provisions required as per extant  IRAC norms, whichever is highe r. Even in cases where the invocation lapses on account of the thresholds for ICA signing not being met, in terms of clause 18, such lending institutions which had earlier agreed for invocation but did not sign the ICA shall also be required to hold 20 percent provisions on their carrying debt. 42.  The additional provisions maintained, if any, by lending institutions in terms of the circular DOR.No.BP.BC.63/21.04.048/2019-20 dated April 17, 2020 in \nrespect of such borrowers, to the extent not already reversed, may be utilised for meeting the provision requirements in all cases under this facility. \n43.  Any additional provisions maintained in terms of Paragraph 17 of the Prudential Framework, wherever applicable, may be reversed at the time of invocation of the   resolution plan under this facility. However, if the plan is not implemented within 180 days from invocation, provisions as per the Prudential Framework shall be required to be maintained, as if a resolution process was never invoked under this window.  Reversal of Provisions  44.  In case of personal loans resolved under this facility, half of the above provisions may be written back upon the borrower paying at least 20 per  cent of the residual debt without slipping into NPA post implementation of the plan, 12  and the remaining half may be written back upon the borrower paying another 10 per cent of the residual debt without slipping into NPA subsequently. 45.  In case of resolution of other exposures, the provisions maintained by the ICA signatories may be reversed as prescribed in clause 44. However, in respect of the non-ICA signatories while half of the provisions may be reversed upon repayment of 20 percent of the carrying debt, the other half may be reversed upon repayment of another 10 per cent of the carrying debt , subject to the required IRAC provisions being maintained. Post Implementation Performance 46.  For personal loans, after implementation of the resolution plan in terms of this facility, the subsequent asset classification will be governed by the criteria laid out in the Master Circular - Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset \nClassification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances dated July 1, 2015  or \nother relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions. \n47.  In respect of exposures other than personal loans, any default by the borrower with any of the signatories to the ICA during the monitoring period shall trigger a Review Period of 30 days. Monitoring period, for this purpose, is defined as the period starting from the date of implementation of the resolution plan  till the borrower pays 10 percent of the residual debt, subject to a minimum of one year from the commencement of the first payment of interest or principal  (whichever is later) on the credit facility with longest period of moratorium. 48.  If the borrower is in default with any of the signatories to the ICA at the end of the Review Period, the asset classification of the borrower with all lending institutions, including those who did not sign the ICA, shall be downgraded to NPA from the date of implementation of the resolution plan or the date from which the borrower had been classified as NPA before implementation of the plan, whichever is earlier. 13  49.  In all cases, further upgradation shall be subject to implementation of a fresh restructuring under the Prudential Framework, or the relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions where the Prudential Framework is not applicable. 50.  Upon completion of the monitoring period without being classified as NPA, the asset classification norms will revert to the criteria laid out in the Master \nCircular - Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and \nProvisioning pertaining to Advances dated July 1, 2015  or other relevant \ninstructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions .  51.  The provisions required to be maintained under this window, to the extent not already reversed, shall be available for: (i) the provisioning requirements when any of the accounts, where a resolution plan had been implemented, is subsequently classified as NPA; as well as, (ii) the additional provisioning requirements on account of Paragraph 17 of the Prudential Framework, as and when the Prudential Framework becomes applicable in respect of the particular account. D. Disclosures and Credit Reporting 52.  Lending institutions publishing quarterly statements shall, at the minimum, make disclosures as per the format prescribed in Format -A\n in their financial \nstatements for the quarters ending March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021  and September 30, 2021. Such lending institutions shall also make disclosures in the format prescribed in \nFormat-B  every half-year, i.e., in the financial \nstatements as on September 30 and March 31, starting from the half-year ending September 30, 2021 till all exposures on which resolution plan was implemented are either fully extinguished or completely slips into NPA, whichever is earlier. \n53.  Lending institutions required to publish only annual financial statements shall make the required disclosures in their annual financial statements, along with other prescribed disclosures. 54.  The credit reporting by the lending institutions in respect of borrowers where the resolution plan is implemented under this facility shall reflect the 14  \u201crestructured\u201d status of the account if the resolution plan involves renegotiations that would be classified as restructuring under the Prudential Framework. The credit history of the borrowers shall consequently be governed by the respective policies of the credit information companies as applicable to accounts that are restructured. 15  Format \u2013 A Format for disclosures to be made in the quarters ending March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021 Type of \nborrower (A) \nNumber of accounts where resolution plan has been implemented under this window (B) \nexposure to accounts mentioned at (A) before implementation of the plan (C) \nOf (B), aggregate amount of debt that was converted into other securities (D) \nAdditional funding sanctioned, if any, including between invocation of the plan and implementation (E) \nIncrease in provisions on account of the implementation of the resolution plan \nPersonal \nLoans       \nCorporate \npersons*      \n Of which, \nMSMEs      \nOthers       \nTotal       \n*As defined in Section 3(7) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016    16  Format-B Format for disclosures to be made half yearly starting September 30, 2021 Type of \nborrower Exposure to accounts  \nclassified as Standard consequent to implementation of resolution plan   \u2013 Position as at the end of the previous half-year (A) Of (A), aggregate debt \nthat slipped into NPA during the half-year Of (A) amount \nwritten off during the half-year Of (A) amount paid \nby the borrowers during the half-year Exposure to \naccounts classified as Standard consequent to implementation of resolution plan \u2013 Position as at the end of this half-year \nPersonal \nLoans      \nCorporate \npersons*      \nOf which \nMSMEs      \nOthers       \nTotal       \n* As defined in Section 3(7) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016  ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT168F87DBE0F71643B3B17BC8278108C16B.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "info": " \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \ufffd\u0930\u091c\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\ufffd\u0915  \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA www.rbi.org.in  \n\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 (\u0917\u0948\u0930-\u092c \ufffd \ufffd\u0915\u0902 \u0917 \u093f\u0935\ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915 \u0902 \u092a\u093f\u0928\u092f\u093e\u0902) , \u0915\ufffd \ufffd \u0940 \u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, 2\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u095b\u0932 , \u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\ufffd, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908-400 001 \u091f\u0947\u0932\u0940\u092b\u094b\u0928:+91-22-22709038, \u0908\u092e\u0947\u0932:helpdnbr@rbi.org.in Department of Regulation (Non-Banking Financial Companies), Central Office, 2\nnd Floor, Main Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort, Mumbai \u2013 400 001                                                               Tel No:  +91-22-22709038, Email :helpdnbr@rbi.org.in\n  \n\ufffd\u0939\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948 , \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e \ufffd\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0907\u090f \u0964  \n RBI/2020-21/15     DOR (NBFC).CC.PD.No.116/22.10.106/2020-21   July 24, 2020 To Non-Banking Financial Companies and Asset Reconstruction Companies implementing Indian Accounting Standards  Madam / Sir, Implementation of Indian Accounting Standards\n \nPlease refer to paragraph 3 of the Annex to our circular DOR (NBFC).CC.PD.No.109 \n/22.10.106/2019-20 dated March 13, 2020 , on the captioned subject, in terms of which \nany net unrealised gains arising on fair valuation of financial instruments, should not be included in owned funds whereas all such net losses should be considered.  \n2.  On a review, it has been decided that the unrealised gain/loss on a derivative transaction undertaken for hedging may be offset against the unrealised loss/gain recognized in the capital (either through Profit or Loss or through Other Comprehensive Income) on the corresponding underlying hedged instrument.

In this connection, we inform that Government of India (GoI), vide Gazette Notification S.O. \n2119 (E) dated June 26, 2020 , has notified new criteria for classifying the enterprises as Micro, \nSmall and Medium enterprises. The new criteria will come into effect from July 1, 2020. The details are as under:  \n \n2.1   Classification of enterprises \n \nAn enterprise shall be classified as a Micro, Small or Medium enterprise on the basis of the following criteria, namely: \n \n(i) a micro enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not  exceed one crore rupees and turnover does not exceed five crore rupees;  \n \n(ii)   a small enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not        exceed ten crore rupees and turnover does not exceed fifty crore rupees; and  (iii) a medium enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not  exceed fifty crore rupees and turnover does not exceed two hundred and fifty crore rupees  2.2   Composite criteria of investment and turnover for classification  \n \n(i) A composite criterion of investment and turnover shall apply for classification of an enterprise as micro, small or medium. \n   \n   2 \n (ii) If an enterprise crosses the ceiling limits specified for its present category in either of the two criteria of investment or turnover, it will cease to exist in that category and be placed in the next higher category but no enterprise shall be placed in the lower category unless it goes below the ceiling limits specified for its present category in both the criteria of investment as well as turnover.

A revised version \nof Master Circular on the subject is annexed for your information and necessary action. This Master Circular is placed in our website \nwww.rbi.org.in . \nYours faithfully (Ishan Shukla) Chief General Manager Encl. As above \nMaster Circular \u2013 Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated July 01, 2020  \n1. Facility for exchange of notes and coins at bank branches  (a) All branches of banks in all parts of the country are mandated to provide the following customer services, more actively and vigorously to the members of public so that there is no need for them to approach the RBI Regional Offices for this purpose: (i) Issuing fresh / good quality notes and coins of all denominations on demand, (ii) Exchanging soiled / mutilated / defective notes,* * Small Finance Banks and Payment Banks may exchange mutilated and defective notes at their option. and (iii) Accepting coins and notes either for transactions or exchange. It will be preferable to accept coins, particularly, in the denominations of \u20b9 1 and 2, by weighment. However, accepting coins packed in sachets of 100 each would perhaps be more convenient for the cashiers as well as the customers. Such sachets may be kept at the counters and made available to the customers. (b) All branches should provide the above facilities to members of public without any discrimination on all working days. The scheme of providing exchange facility by a f ew select currency chest branches on one of the Sundays in a month will remain unchanged. The names and addresses of such bank branches should be available with the respective banks. (c) The availability of the above-mentioned facilities at the bank branches should be given wide publicity for information of the public at large. (d) None of the bank branches should refuse to accept small denomination notes and / or coins tendered at their counters. All coins in the denomination of 50 paise, \u20b9 1/-, 2/-, 5/-, 10/- and 20/- of various sizes, theme and design issued from time to time by the Government of India continue to be legal tender. 2. Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 [As amended by Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Amendment Rules, 2018]  - Delegation of powers (a) In terms of Section 28 read with Section 58 (2) of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, no person is entitled as a right to recover from the Government of India or RBI the value of any lost, stolen, mutilated or imperfect currency note of the GOI or banknote. However, with a view to mitigating the hardship to the public in genuine cases, it has been provided that the RBI may, with the previous sanction of the Central Government, prescribe the circumstances in, and the conditions and limitations subject to which, the value of such currency notes or banknotes may be refunded as a matter of grace. (b) With a view to extending the facility for the benefit and convenience of public, all branches of banks have been delegated powers under Rule 2(j) of Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 [As amended by Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Amendment Rules, 2018]  (hereinafter referred to as NRR, 2009) for exchange of mutilated / defective notes free of cost.  (c) The NRR, 2009 were amended to enable the public to exchange mutilated notes in Mahatma Gandhi (New) series, which are smaller in size compared to the earlier series. The minimum area of the single largest undivided piece of the note required for payment of full value for notes of  rupees fifty and above denominations were also revised. The Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Amendment Rules, 2018 have since been notified in the Gazette of India on September 6, 2018. 3. Liberalized definition of a Soiled Note In order to facilitate quicker exchange facilities, the definition of soiled note has been expanded. A \u2018soiled note\u2019 means a note which has become dirty due to normal wear and tear and also includes a two piece note pasted together wherein both the pieces presented belong to the  same note and form the entire note with no essential feature missing. These notes should be accepted over bank counters in payment of Government dues and for credit to accounts of the public maintained with banks. However, in no case, these notes should be issued to the public as re - issuable notes and shall be deposited in currency chests for onward transmission to RBI offices as soiled note remittances for further processing. 4. Mutilated Notes \u2013 Presentation and Passing A mutilated note is a note of which a portion is missing or which is composed of more than two pieces. Mutilated notes may be presented at any of the bank branches. The notes so presented shall be accepted, exchanged and adjudicated in accordance with  NRR, 2009\n. \n5. Extremely brittle, burnt, charred, stuck up Notes Notes which have turned extremely brittle or are badly burnt, charred or inseparably stuck up together and, therefore, cannot withstand normal handling, shall not be accepted by the bank branches for exchange. Instead, the holders may be advised to tender these notes to the Issue Office concerned where they will be adjudicated under a Special Procedure.  6. Procedure for exchange of soiled/mutilated/imperfect notes 6.1 Exchange of soiled notes 6.1.1 Notes presented in small number: Where the number of notes presented by a person is up to 20 pieces with a maximum value of ` 5000 per day, banks should exchange them over the counter, free of charge. 6.1.2 Notes presented in bulk: Where the number of notes presented by a person exceeds 20 pieces or ` 5000 in value per day, banks may accept them, against receipt, for value to be credited later. Banks may levy service charges as perm itted in Master Circular on Customer Service in Banks (DBR.No.Leg.BC.21/09.07.006/2015-16 dated July 1, 2015 ). In case tendered \nvalue is above ` 50000, banks are expected to take the usual precautions. \n6.2 Exchange of mutilated and imperfect notes 6.2.1 While designated branches may continue to follow the procedure as laid down in Part III of NRR, 2009 (www.rbi.org.in\n\u2192Publications\u2192Occassional) for exchanging mutilated and \nimperfect notes and issue receipt for the notes presented for adjudication, non- chest branches are required to follow the following procedure for notes presented in small numbers and in bulk. \n6.2.2 Notes presented in small number : Where the number of notes presented by a person is up to 5 pieces, non-chest branches should normally adjudicate the notes as per the procedure laid down in Part III of NRR, 2009 and pay the exchange value over the counter. If the non -chest branches are not able to adjudicate the mutilated notes, the notes may be received against a receipt and sent to the linked currency chest branch for adjudication. The probable date of payment should be informed to the tenderers on the receipt itself and the same should not exceed 30 days. Bank account details should be obtained from the tenderers for crediting the exchange value by electronic means. 6.2.3 Notes presented in bulk: Where the number of notes presented by a person is more than 5 pieces not exceeding ` 5000 in value, the tenderer should be advised to send such notes to nearby currency chest branch by insured post giving his / her bank account details (a/c no, branch name, IFSC, etc.) or get them exchanged thereat in person. All other persons tendering mutilated notes whose value exceeds ` 5000 should be advised to approach nearby currency chest branch. Currency chest branches receiving mutilated notes through insured post should credit the exchange value to the account of sender by electronic means within 30 days of receipt of notes. 6.3 Tenderers aggrieved with the service provided by the banks in this regard may approach Banking Ombudsman concerned, following the procedure as laid under Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006 with the bank /postal receipts as proof for necessary action. 7. Notes bearing \"PAY\" / \"PAID\" / \"REJECT\" stamps (a) Every Officer-in-charge of the branch i.e. the Branch Manager and every Officer -in-charge of the Accounts or Cash Wing of the Branch shall act as 'Prescribed Officer' in each branch to adjudicate the notes received at the branch for exchange in accordance with NRR, 2009. After adjudicating mutilated notes, the Prescribed Officer is required to record his order by subscribing his initials to the dated 'PAY'/ 'PAID'/ 'REJECT' stamp. The 'PAY' /'PAID' & 'REJECT' stamps should also carry the name of the bank and branch concerned and held under the custody of the 'Prescribed Officer' to avoid misuse. (b) Mutilated / defective notes bearing 'PAY'/'PAID' (or 'REJECT') stamp of any RBI Issue Office or any bank branch, if presented for payment again at any of the bank branches should be rejected under Rule 6(2) of NRR, 2009 and the tenderer should be advised that the value of such note/s cannot be paid since the same has already been paid as is evident from the PAY/PAID stamps affixed on it/them. All bank branches have instructions not to issue notes bearing PAY/PAID stamps to the public even through oversight. The branches should caution their customers not to accept such notes from any bank or anybody else. \n8. Notes with slogans/ scribbling/ stain etc \n  \n(a) Notes with slogans, political or religious messages, scribbling, stain (including colour stain) \netc are unfit for usage and circulation and go against Clean Note Policy of RBI.  \n  \n(b) Such notes received from members of public may not be reissued for circulation.  They may \nbe remitted to currency chest for onward remittance to RBI offices.  \n  \n(c) Any note with slogans and message of a political or religious nature written across it ceases \nto be a legal tender and the claim on such a note will be rejected under Rule  6(3) (iii) of NRR, \n2009. Similarly, notes which are disfigured may also be rejected under Rule 6(3) (ii) of NRR, \n2009 .  \n  \n(d) All Bank notes with scribbling / stain (including colour stain) on them continue to be legal \ntender. Such notes can be deposited or exchanged in any bank branch.  \n  \n9. Deliberately cut notes \nThe notes, which are found to be deliberately cut, torn, altered or tampered with, if presented for payment of exchange value should be rejected under Rule 6(3)(ii) of the NRR, 2009. Although it is not possible to precisely define deliberately cut notes, a close look at such notes will clearly reveal any deliberate fraudulent intention, as the manner in which such notes are m utilated will follow a broad uniformity in the shape/location of missing portions of the notes, especially when the notes are tendered in large numbers. The details of the case such as the name of the tenderer, the number of notes tendered and their denominations should be reported thereafter to the Deputy/General Manager, Issue Department, under whose jurisdiction the branch falls. The matter should also be reported to local police in case a large number of such notes are tendered. 10. Training Our Issue Offices conduct training programmes for 'Prescribed Officers' of bank branches on a priority basis. As the training programmes are intended to provide knowledge and instill confidence in the Prescribed Officers in the process of adjudication of defective notes, it is imperative that the Prescribed Officers of the branches are deputed for such programmes.  11. Display of Notice Board All bank branches are required to display at their branch premises, at a prominent place, a board indicating the availability of note and coin exchange facility with the legend, \"SOILED/MUTILATED NOTES AND COINS ARE ACCEPTED AND EXCHANGED HERE\" for information of general public. Banks should ensure that all their branches provide facility for exchange of notes and coins not only to their customers but also others. However, they should ensure that the note exchange facility is not cornered by money changers / dealers in defective notes. 12. Disposal of notes adjudicated at bank branches Regarding audit of the notes adjudicated by bank branches, the full value paid notes have to be remitted by all branches to the chest branches with which they have been linked and therefrom to the Issue Offices concerned together with the next soiled note remittance in the manner already laid down. The half value paid notes and rejected notes, which are held by the chest branches in their cash balance, may either be remitted separately packed together with the full value paid notes or sent by registered and insured post as and when required. The full va lue paid notes will be treated as chest remittance by the Issue Office while the half value paid notes and rejected notes will be treated as notes tendered for adjudication and processed accordingly. All chest branches are required to submit to our Issue Offices a monthly statement showing the number of notes adjudicated during the month. 13. Uncurrent Coins The coins of 25 paise and below, issued from time to time, ceased to be legal tender for payments as well as account with effect from June 30, 2011 in terms of Gazette Notification No. 2529 dated December 20, 2010 issued by the Government of India. 14. Monitoring and Control (a) The Regional Managers / Zonal Managers of the banks may pay surprise visits to the branches and report the position of compliance in this regard to the Head Office which will review such reports and take prompt remedial action, wherever necessary.  (b) Any non-compliance in this regard shall be viewed as violation of instructions issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the Central and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the agency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual agreement. RBI pays agency commission to the agency banks for the government business handled by them. This Master Circular consolidates the instructions contained in the circulars listed in Annex 1\n. \nGovernment transactions eligible for agency commission  2. Transactions relating to the following government business undertaken by agency banks are eligible for agency commission paid by RBI: (a) Revenue receipts and payments on behalf of the Central/State Government s (b) Pension payments in respect of Central / State Governments  and (c) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank as eligible for agency commission   3. The Agency banks also undertake the work related to Small  Savings Schemes (SSS) the commission for which is borne by Government of India.  Though the settlement of commission on such SSS is processed by RBI  and settled at Central Accounts Section (CAS), Nagpur, the rates of agency commission related to SSS transactions are decided by Government of India. Agency commission claims on Special Deposit Scheme (SDS) related transactions (where mirror accounts are maintained in RBI) are also settled at CAS, Nagpur. 4. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from financial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commission as these transactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business.  Reserve Bank pays the agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for acting as agents for management of public debt.  5. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical mode or e- mode (challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the agency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive remuneration from the State Government for doing this work.  6. If the agency bank is engaged by the State Government as Franking Vendor and it collects stamp duty from the public for franking the documents, it will not be eligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to it as Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects  the stamp duty paid by the Franking Vendor for credit to the Treasury through challan in physical or e-mode for purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since it is a regular payment of Stamp Duty as stated above.  3  Government transactions not eligible for agency commission  7. Agency banks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or through authorised branches of State Bank of India or offices of Reserve Bank of India wherever they do not have their own authorised direct tax collection branch should indicate the same separately in the scroll. Such transactions will not be eligible for payment of agency commission. Banks should furnish a certificate to the effect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) paid by them have been excluded while claiming agency commission. 8. The following activities, inter alia, do not come under the purview of agency bank business and are therefore not eligible for payment of agency commission.  (a) Furnishing of bank guarantees/security deposits, etc . through agency banks by government contractors/suppliers, which constitute banking transactions undertaken by banks for their customers.  (b) The banking business of autonomous/statutory bodies /Municipalities/ companies/ Corporations/Local Bodies.   (c) Payments which have been classified as capital in nature by government to cover losses incurred by autonomous/statutory bodies/ Municipalities/ Corporations/Local Bodies, etc.. (d) Prefunded schemes which may be implemented by a Central Government Ministry/Department (in consultation with CGA) and a State Government Department through any bank.  (e) Transactions related to Gold Monetisation Scheme 2015  \n(f) Transactions arising out of Letters of Credit / Bank Guarantee opened by banks on behalf of Ministries/Departments etc. do not qualify for agency commission as RBI only reimburses the paid amount to the banks based on the mandate received from the governments.  (g) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank or Central or State Government as ineligible for agency commission  9. Agency Banks are advised to meticulously follow instructions issued by RBI from time to time regarding transactions which are not eligible for agency commission and submit their claims for agency commission accordingly. All agency banks while claiming agency commission should certify that no claim of agency commission is made on ineligible transactions. \n \nReporting of transactions by agency banks to RBI 10. With effective from December 16, 2019, agency banks authorised to collect GST shall upload their luggage files in RBI\u2019s QPX/E-Kuber on all days except on 4  RTGS holidays (including Sundays and non-working Saturdays) notified by RBI from time to time.  11. State government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) of previous month reported after 8th of the succeeding month and those pertaining to earlier months should be reported to RBI through a separate statement for accounting, after being confirmed by the competent authorities of concerned state government.  12. For Central Government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) or any adjustments thereof, if reported after a gap of 90 days from the date of transaction, agency banks have to obtain prior approval from concerned ministry/department and submit the same to RBI separately at the time of reporting such transactions for settlement.   Rates for agency commission 13. As per agency bank agreement, RBI pays agency commission at rates determined by it. The rates applicable with effect from July 1, 2019 are as under: Sr. No. Type of Transaction  Unit Revised Rate  \na.  (i) Receipts - Physical mode Per transaction  \u20b9 40/- \n     (ii) Receipts - e-mode Per transaction  \u20b9 9/- \nb. Pension Payments  Per transaction   \u20b9 75/- \nc. Payments other than Pension Per   \u20b9 100 turnover 6.5 paise per     \n\u20b9 100 \n 14. In this context, the \u2018Receipts-e-mode transactions\u2019 indicated against Sr. No. a.(ii) in the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from the remitter\u2019s bank account through internet banking as well as such transactions  which do not involve physical  receipt of cash /instruments  at all. For example, challan generated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with cash / instrument should be treated as transaction under physical mode.    15. With reference to the implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number (CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This means that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records clubbed under a single challan i.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission effective July 1, 2017.  5  16. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that a single challan (electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only and not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains mult iple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts that will get credited.  Therefore, records clubbed under a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission.   17. Agency banks would be eligible to claim agency commission for pension \ntransactions at the rate of \u20b9 75 per transaction only when the entire work relating to disbursement of pension including pension calculation is attended to by them .  If the work relating to pension calculations, etc., is attended to by the concerned Government Department / Treasury and the banks are required only to credit the amount of pension to the pensioners' accounts maintained with them by a single debit to Government Account, such transaction is to be categorised under \u2018other than pension payment\u2019 and would be eligible for payment of agenc y commission @ 6.5 \npaise per \u20b9 100/- turnover w.e.f. July 1, 2019. \n18. The number of transactions eligible for payment of agency commission should not exceed 14 per pensioner per year.  This includes one monthly credit for payment of net pension and a maximum of two per year for payment of arrears on account of increase in dearness relief, if applicable. Cases involving payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension qualifies as a single transaction for claiming of agency commission. In other words, any payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension should be treated as a single credit transaction and not as separate monthly credits. 19. Agency commission is payable to an agency bank at the full rate provided the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages.  Where, however, the work is shared between two banks, the agency commission is shared between the banks in the proportion of 75:25.  Thus, broadly, the agency commission is payable to the agency banks as detailed below: (a) At the full rate, in cases where the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages, i.e., up to the stage of dispatch of scrolls and challans / cheques to the Pay and Accounts Offices, and treasuries/sub-treasuries.  (b) At 75% of the applicable rate, where the dealing branch is required to account for the transaction by passing on the scrolls and documents to the local/nearest branch of Reserve Bank of India or by any agency bank conducting government business. (c) At 25% of the applicable rate, in the case of agency branch which received the scrolls and documents from dealing branches of other banks and is responsible for the accounting of these transactions and dispatching of the scrolls and documents to the Pay and Accounts Offices, Treasuries, et c. 20. All agency banks should settle their agency transactions for both funds and agency commission directly with the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank 6  instead of routing them through any other agency bank that acts as aggregator in certain cases. So also for payments made by all agency banks on behalf of state government/s get directly settled with the concerned Regional Office of RBI. Agency Transaction details/scrolls may be sent directly by individual agency bank to the concerned State Government/Treasury.\n This new arrangement for settlement of state government funds on day to day basis (receipts and payments) directly with Reserve Bank is with effect from January 1, 2018. \n \nClaiming agency commission  21. Agency banks are required to submit their claims for agency commission in the prescribed format to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions and the respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for  State government transactions. However, agency commission claims with respect to GST receipt transactions will be settled at Mumbai Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India only and accordingly all agency banks, authorized to collect GST, are advised to submit their agency commission claims pertaining to GST receipt transactions at Mumbai Regional Office only. The revised formats for claiming agency commission for all agency banks and separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the branch officials and Chartered Accountants or Cost Accountants are given in \nAnnex \n2, Annex 2A and Annex 2B  respectively. These certificates would be in addition to \nthe usual Certificate from ED / CGM (in charge of government  business) to the effect that there are no pension arrears to be credited / delays in crediting regular pension / arrears thereof. \n22. Where the External Auditor is also the Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor, claims can be certified by such Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor. In addition to this, agency banks are required to ensure that the agency bank\u2019s internal inspectors / auditors verify the agency commission claims submitted by their branches and confirm their accuracy during the course of their inspection / audit.    23. Reference is also drawn to the instructions contained in our letter dated November 4, 2016 advising the process of claiming reimbursement of service tax (ST) on agency commission received for Central and State Government transactions, centrally from Reserve Bank of India at Central Accounts Section, Nagpur. The same process continued even after Service Tax got subsumed into the Goods and Service Tax (GST) framework. This process of centralised claims submission has been replaced with a system whereby applicable GST (18% at present) shall be paid along with agency commission by the respective Regional Offices of RB I / CAS, Nagpur as the case may be.  24. For eligible government transactions done with effect from July 01, 2019, agency banks shall submit the agency commission claims, including applicable GST amount, as per revised agency commission rates indicated above, to RBI at respective ROs / CAS, Nagpur as per the extant instructions issued by RBI in this regard. TDS on GST shall be deducted as applicable by RBI at the time of making 7  agency commission payment in accordance with Government instructions in the matter.  25. However, for eligible government transactions done by agency banks upto June 30, 2019, agency banks shall continue to submit agency commission claims as well as the centralized claims for ST/GST reimbursement as hitherto.  26. Agency banks are required to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India / Central Accounts Section, Nagpur as applicable in the prescribed format are accurate.  Agency banks may also alert their branches concerned to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to our Regional Offices are accurate.  Such erroneous claims, if certified by the Internal / Concurrent Auditors, will defeat the very purpose of making such requirement an essential condition for making quarterly claims.  27. Agency banks are advised to furnish their claim on agency commission to Reserve Bank within 60 calendar days from the end of the quarter in which the transactions have been conducted.  If the banks fail to lodge the claims within the stipulated period mentioned above they may forward the same to RBI only after giving reasons for delay.     Penal interest for wrong claims  28. As per the agreement that agency banks have with RBI, violation or non-compliance of instructions issued by Government or Reserve Bank shall attract imposition of penalty. Agency banks will be liable to pay penal interest at Bank Rate as notified by Reserve Bank of India plus 2% for any wrong claims of agency commission settled.       8  Annex 1 List of circulars consolidated in the Master Circular  \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

This Master Circular consolidates important instructions on the subject issued by the Reserve Bank of India till June 30, 2020 (listed in Appendix\n). It does not replace or supersede any \nexisting government instructions on the matter. The instructions issued by Pension Sanctioning Authority of the Central and State Governments and circulated by RBI in the past will continue to remain in operation subject to changes being made by the competent authority. In case of any doubt or apparent contradiction, agency banks may be guided by the relevant government instructions. Contents of various circulars issued in this connection by the Reserve Bank of India are summarised  hereunder. \n \nGeneral Instructions \n \nGovernment orders on DR, etc. on websites \n \n2. In order to obviate the time lag between issue of DR orders and payment of DR to the beneficiary and to render expeditious service to senior citizens, the following actions are required to be taken:  (a) It has been decided to discontinue the procedure of forwarding government orders in respect of dearness relief etc. to pension paying agency banks. Agency Banks may, therefore, act on the copies of government orders supplied by government to them through post, fax, e-mails or by accessing from the website and authorize their pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately.  (b) All agency banks are advised to scrupulously follow all the guidelines /instructions contained in various notifications of Government (Central as well as States) and 3  take necessary action immediately without waiting for any further instructions from RBI\n. \n \n        Timing of pension disbursement by agency banks.  3. The pension paying banks will credit the pension amount in the accounts of the pensioners based on the instructions given by respective Pension Paying Authorities. Recovery of excess/wrong payment made to a pensioner  \n \n4. Details of the uniform procedure for recovery of excess/wrong payments made to pensioners drawing pensions under the Scheme for payment of pension to Central\n/Civil/Defence/Railways pensioners through agency banks have been put in place by RBI in consultation with Government of India are given below: \n a. As soon as the excess/wrong payment made to a pensioner comes to the notice of the paying branch, the branch should adjust the same against the amount standing to the credit to the pensioner\u2019s account to the extent possible including lumpsum arrears payment. \n \nb. If the entire amount of overpayment cannot be adjusted from the account, the pensioner may be asked to pay forthwith the balance amount of overpayment. \n \nc. In case the pensioner expresses his inability to pay the amount, the same may be adjusted from the future pension payments to be made to the pensioners. For recovering the overpayment made to pensioner from his future pension payment in instalments 1/3rd of net (pension + relief) payable each month may be recovered unless the pensioner concerned gives consent in writing to pay a higher instalment amount.     d.  If the overpayment cannot be recovered from the pensioner due to his death or discontinuance of pension, then action has to be taken as per the letter of undertaking given by the pensioner under the scheme. \n 4  e. The pensioner may also be advised about the details of over payment/wrong payment and mode of its recovery. Refund of excess pension payment to Government \n \n5. Whenever any excess / overpayment is detected the entire amount thereof should be credited to the Government account in lump sum immediately when the excess/overpayment is due to an error on the part of the agency bank. This action is independent of recovery from the pensioner.  6. If the excess/wrong payment to the pensioner is due to errors committed by the government, banks may take up the matter with the full particulars of the cases with respective Government Department for a quick resolution of the matter. However, this must be a time bound exercise and the government authority\u2019s acknowledgement to this effect must be kept on the bank\u2019s record. The banks may take up such cases with government departments without reference to the Reserve Bank of  India.  Withdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners  \n \n7. In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners in withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorise such pensioners as under:  a. Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the bank. \n \nb. Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also not even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form due to certain physical defect / incapacity. 8. With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their accounts, banks may follow the procedure as under:  a. Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should be identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom should be a responsible bank official. 5   \nb. Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also would not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained on the cheque/withdrawal form, which should be identified by two independent witnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official.  9. Accordingly, the agency banks are requested to instruct their branches to display the instructions issued in this regard on their notice board so that sick and disabled pensioners could make full use of these facilities. Agency Banks are also advised to strictly implement the instructions issued by RBI regarding the facilities to be provided to the sick and disabled persons and  sensitise staff members in the matter and to refer to the FAQs on pension disbursement hosted on our website www.rbi.org.in \nin case of \nany doubt. \n Reimbursement of pension payments \n \n10. Link branches of agency banks may submit reimbursement claims to Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur / Government Banking Division at Regional Office for Central/State Government pension payments. \n \nContinuation of either or survivor pension account after death of pensioner  \n \n11. All agency banks disbursing Central Government pension have been advised that in case the spouse (Family pensioner) opts for existing joint account for credit of family pension, banks should not insist on opening a new account when the spouse is the survivor and having a joint account with the pensioner and in whose favour an authorisation for payment of family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order  (PPO). Life Certificate- Issuance of Acknowledgement  \n \n12. There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of pension paying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to mandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also advised to 6  consider entering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as real time updation of records. Single Window System for reimbursement of Pension Payments  \n \n13. Single Window System was introduced to facilitate prompt settlement of reimbursement claims and reconciliation. The underlying objective is to make each pension paying bank responsible in its own right to effect settlement without the intervention of RBI Offices or SBI (at District Headquarters) in the process eliminating cause of delay in reimbursement claims.  Customer Service \n \n14. All agency banks may issue instructions to their dealing branches to adhere to the recommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee relating to pension payments. A checklist may be provided to the inspecting officers/auditors, which may at a minimum include the items given in Annex 1\n. Agency banks may also instruct their \ninternal auditors/inspectors to comment on the quality of customer service in their reports which may be made available to Reserve Bank\u2019s inspecting officers, as and when they visit the branches. \n \n15. Grievances of pensioners are not being addressed properly at the branch level especially after the setting up of Centralised Pension Processing Centres (CPPCs). To provide hassle free service to the pensioners, there should be a forum for regular interaction and settlement of grievances. Accordingly, agency banks should appoint one/two nodal officers at each Region/Zone for monitoring the resolution of grievances of pensioners on regular basis and the GM/CGM concerned should review the position at monthly intervals\n \n 16. At locations outside the CPPCs, there should be designated nodal officers for pension related complaints who should be easily accessible to pensioners and who should hold regular meetings at different locations in their jurisdiction on the lines of Pension Adalat. Each bank should establish toll free dedicated pension line manned by  trained persons 7  with access to the database to answer queries, note down and redress  complaints.  17. Following several complaints from pensioners alleging inordinate delay in disbursing revised pension and arrears, agency banks are advised as under: a. Pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in crediting pension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for the delay after the due date of payment and the compensation shall be credited to the pensioner's account automatically without any claim from the pensioner on the same day when the bank affords credit for revised pension/ pension arrears, in respect of all delayed pension payments made since October 1,  2008. b. Pension paying banks have been advised to put in place a mechanism to obtain immediately the copies of pension orders from the pension paying authorities directly and make payments without waiting for receipt of instructions from the Reserve Bank of India so that pensioners should get benefits announced by  the Governments in the succeeding month's pension payment  itself. c. When the agency bank is calculating pension, the branch should continue to be a point of referral for the pensioner lest he/she feel disenfranchised. d. All branches having pension accounts should guide and assist the pensioners in all their dealings with the bank. e. Suitable arrangements should be made to place the arithmetic and other details about pension calculations on the web, to be made available to the pensioners through the net or at the branches at periodic interval as may be necessary and sufficient advertisement is made about such arrangements. f. All claims for agency commission by banks in respect of pension payments must be accompanied by a certificate from ED/CGM in charge of government business that there are no pension arrears to be credited/ delays in crediting regular pension/arrears thereof. g. All agency banks disbursing pension are advised to provide considerate and sympathetic customer service to the pensioners, especially to those pensioners who are of old age. 8  Annex 1  Checklist relating to Government Business (pension related) for internal/concurrent audit  Internal inspections should assess branch performance in servicing pensioner customers. In this regard, the following may be ensured:  1. A specific questionnaire covering all aspects of pension payment may be devised for use during inspection of pension paying branches. 2. Inspecting officers may also, during inspections, call up pensioners at random and enquire about their satisfaction with pension-related services. 3. A detailed check-list relating to pension payments/government business may be given by banks to internal auditors/inspectors in order to adhere to the recommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee, constituted by the Government of India, relating to pension payments/government business.  These include the following: \n \n(a) Whether there is delay in payment of pension, revision of pension, revision in dearness relief etc. (b) Whether the branch manager has structured interaction with a cross section of pensioners serviced at the branch on quarterly basis, where the number of pensioners of all governments and departments exceeds a fixed number, say, 100 or 200. (c) Whether nominations have been obtained for all pension accounts. (d) Whether pension accounts have been converted into joint accounts wherever applicable. (e) Whether the bank branch has an effective complaint redressal mechanism and the complaints of pensioners are attended promptly and their grievances redressed expeditiously. (f) Whether the pension is credited to pensioner\u2019s account during the last four working days of the month except for the month of March for which pension is to be credited 9  on or after first working day of April. (g) Whether the pension paying branch obtains Life Certificate/ Non- employment certificate/ Employment Certificate from the pensioners in the month of November every year. (h) Whether pension paying branches deduct income tax at source from pension payments wherever applicable. (i) Whether paper tokens in acknowledgement of cheques presented are invariably given by the tax collecting branches. (j) Whether the challans are stamped giving bank\u2019s BSR code and Challan Identification Number (CIN) clearly. (k) Whether the stamped challans are kept in the custody of bank\u2019s staff and handed over to the concerned tax payer only on production of the paper token. 10  Appendix \n \nList of circulars consolidated for the Master Circular  \n \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1 Ref.Co.DGBA(NBS)No.44/GA.64(11 - \nCVL) 90/91 18.04.1991  Scheme for payment of pension to Central \nCivil/Defence/Railways pensioners \nthrough public sector banks -Recovery of \nexcess/wrong payments made to the \nPensioners  \n2 Ref.Co.DGBA(NBS)No.50/GA.64(11 - \nCVL) 90/91 06.05.1991  Scheme for payment of pension to Central \nCivil/Defence/Railways pensioners \nthrough public sector banks -Recovery of \nexcess/wrong payments made to the \nPensioners  \n3 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.130/45.01.001/2002 - \n03 30.08.2002  Single Window System for \nReimbursement of pension payments \nmade to Central Government Civil \nPensioners by public sector banks  \n4 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.H -\n506/45.01.001/2002-03 12.04.2003  Payment of Pension to Government \nPensioners through Public Sector Banks \u2013  \nSteps taken by Government to minimize \ndelay in payment of Dearness Relief (DR) \nto Pensioners \u2013 Discontinuation of \nforwarding Government  orders in respect  \nof DR etc. through Reserve Bank of India.  \n5 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No .11303/45.01.003/200\n5-06 06.02.2006  Disbursement of pension through Public  \nSector Banks \u2013 Payment of Dearness \nRelief (DR)  \n6 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.H -3085/45.01.001  \n/2008-09 01.10.2008  Recommendations of the Prabhakar  Rao \nCommittee on customer service \u2013 Pension \nPayments.  \n7 DGBA.GAD.No .H-3078/45.01.001/2008 - \n09 01.10.2008  Establishment of Centralised Pension  \nProcessing Centre (CPPC)  \n8 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.H -7652/45.05.031/  \n2008-09 03.03.2009  Scheme for payment of pension to Central \nGovernment \nCivil/Defence/Railway/Telecom/ Freedom \nFighters/ State Governments Pensioners \nby Public Sector Banks- Staggering of \npension payments by PSBs.  \n9 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.H -10450/45.03.001/  \n2008 -09 01.06.2009  Recovery / Refund of overpayment of  \npension to the Government Account.  \n10 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.H 3194/45.01.001  \n/2009-10 14.10.2009  Scheme for payment of pension to Central \nCivil/ Defence/ Railway/Telecom \nPensioners/ Freedom Fighters/ State \nGovernments' Pensioners through Public \nSector Banks- Facility for withdrawal of \npension by old/ sick/ disabled/ \nincapacitated pensioners.  \n11 Ref.D O.No.CSD.CO/8793/13.01.001/200 \n9-10 09.04.2010  Pension Payment to central/ State Govt. \nPensioners by agency Banks-  \nCompensation for delay  \n12 DGBA.GAD.

Studies conducted by NABARD in a few states to assess the impact of the linkage project have brought out encouraging and positive features like increase in loan volume of the SHGs, definite shift in the loaning pattern of the members from non-income generating activities to production activities, nearly 100 per cent recovery performance, significant reduction in the transaction costs for both the banks and t he borrowers etc., besides leading to a gradual increase in the income level of the SHG members. Another significant feature observed in the linkage project is  that about 85 per cent of the groups linked with banks were formed exclusively by women.  2. Recognizing the importance of SHG Bank linkage, banks have been advised to meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members, as envisaged in Paragraph 93 of the Union Budget announcement for the year 2008-09, made by the Honorable Finance Minister, wherein it was stated as under: \"Banks will be encouraged to embrace the concept of Total Financial Inclusion. Government will request all scheduled commercial banks to follow the example set by some public sector banks and meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members, namely, (a) income generation activities, (b) social needs like housing, education, marriage, etc. and (c) debt swapping\". Linking of SHGs with banks has thus been emphasized in the Monetary Policy Statements of Reserve Bank of India and Uni on Budget announcements from time to time and various guidelines have been issued to banks in this regard. 3. Banks should provide adequate incentives to their branches in financing the Self Help Groups (SHGs) and establish linkages with them, making the procedures simple and easy. The group dynamics of working of the SHGs need neither be regulated nor formal structures imposed or insisted upon. The approach to financing of SHGs should be totally hassle-free and may also include consumption expenditures.  Accordingly, the following guidelines should be adhered to enable effective linkage of SHGs with the banking sector.    3  4. Opening of Savings Bank A/C a) The SHGs, registered or unregistered, which are engaged in promoting savings habits among their members are eligible to open savings bank accounts with banks. These SHGs need not necessarily have already availed of credit facilities from banks before opening savings bank accounts. The instructions of the Department of Banking Regulation in the Master Direction - Know Your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016\n \npertaining to SHG members (Chapter VI-Paragraph 43) shall be adhered to, while completing Customer Due Diligence (CDD)\n1 process.  b) Accordingly, the current instructions under Simplified norms for Self Help Groups (SHGs) mention that CDD of all the members of SHG as mentioned in the above Direction shall not be required while opening the savings bank account of the SHG . CDD of all the office bearers shall suffice. No separate CDD of the members or office bearers shall be necessary at the time of credit linking of SHGs.  5. Lending to SHGs a) Bank lending to SHGs should be included in branch credit plan, block credit plan, district credit plan and state credit plan of each bank. Utmost priority should be accorded to the sector in preparation of these plans. It should also form an integral part of the bank\u2019s corporate credit plan.  b) As per operational guidelines issued by NABARD, SHGs may be sanctioned savings linked loans by banks (varying from a saving to loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4). However, in case of matured SHGs, loans may be given beyond the limit of four times the savings as per the discretion of the bank. c) A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation is a precondition for augmenting flow of credit to SHGs. Banks should strive to remove all operational irritants and make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and disburse credit by delegating adequate sanctioning powers to branch managers. The loan application forms, procedures and documents should be made simple. It would help in providing prompt and hassle-free credit. \n                                                            \n1 Customer Due Diligence - means identifying and verifying the customer and the beneficial owne r 4  6. Interest rates The banks would have the discretion to decide on the interest rates applicable to loans given to Self Help Groups/member beneficiaries.  7. Service/Processing charges No loan related and ad hoc service charges/inspection charges should be levi ed on priority sector loans up to \u20b9 25,000. In the case of eligible priority sector loans to SHGs/JLGs, this limit will be applicable per member and not to the group as a whole.   8. Separate Segment under priority sector In order to enable the banks to report their SHG lending without difficulty, it is decided that the banks should report their lending to SHGs for on-lending to members of SHGs under the respective categories, viz. 'Advances to SHGs' irrespective of the pur poses for which the loans have been disbursed to the SHG members. Priority Sector loans to SHGs are considered under \u201cWeaker Sections\u201d category. 9. Presence of defaulters in SHGs Defaults by a few members of SHGs and/or their family members to the financin g bank should not ordinarily come in the way of financing SHGs per se by banks, provided the SHG is not in default. However, the bank loan may not be utilized by the SHG for financing a defaulter member to the bank.  10. Capacity Building and Training a) Banks may initiate suitable steps to internalize the SHGs linkage project and organize exclusive short duration programmes for the field level functionaries. In addition, suitable awareness/sensitization programmes may be conducted for their middle level contr olling officers as well as senior officers. b) Banks shall refer to instructions on Financial Literacy by FLCs and rural branches \u2013 Policy review vide \nCircular FIDD.FLC.BC.No.22/12.01.018/2016-17 dated March 02, \n2017  conducting tailored programs targeting SHGs . 5  11. Monitoring and Review of SHG Lending Considering the potential of SHGs, banks shall closely monitor the progress regularly at various levels. In order to give a boost to the ongoing SHG bank linkage programme for credit flow to the unorganized sector, monitoring of SHG bank linkage programme shall  be a regular item on the agenda for discussion at the SLBC and DCC meetings. It should be reviewed at the highest corporate level on a quarterly basis. Further, progress of the programme may be reviewed by banks at regular intervals . The progress under SHG-BLP, as prescribed vide RBI letter FIDD.CO.FID.No.3387/12.01.033/2017 -18 dated April 26, 2018 shall be reported to NABARD (Micro Credit Innovations Department), Mumbai, on a  quarterly basis, and the returns in the \nprescribed format  shall be submitted within 15 days \nfrom due date. \n12. Reporting to CICs Recognizing the importance of credit information reporting in respect of the SHG members for financial inclusion, banks are advised to adhere to the guidelines issued by Department of Banking Regulation on \nCredit information reporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) members\n dated June 16, 2016 and Credit information reporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) members\n dated January 14, 2016. ------------------------ 6  Annex - List of Circulars consolidated in the Master Circular  Sr. \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

R. Gadgil (Gadgil Study Group) on the O rganizational Framework for the Implementation of the Social Objectives, which submitted its report in October 1969. The Study Group drew attention to the fact that commercial banks did not have adequate presence in rural areas and also lacked the required rural orientation. The Study Group, therefore, recommended the adoption of an 'Area Approach' to evolve plans and programmes for the development of an adequate banking and credit structure in the rural areas.  (ii)  A Committee of Bankers on Branch Expansion Programme of P ublic Sector Banks appointed by the Reserve Bank of India under the Chairmanship of Shri F. K. F. Nariman (Nariman Committee) endorsed the idea of an \u2018A rea Approach\u2019 in its report (November 1969), recommending that in order to enable the Public Sector Banks to discharge their social responsibilities, each bank should concentrate on certain districts where it should act as a 'Lead Bank'.       (iii)  Pursuant to the above recommendations, the Lead Bank Scheme was introduced by the Reserve Bank of India in December 1969.The Scheme aims at coordinating the activities of banks and other developmental agencies through various fora in order to achieve the objective of enhancing the flow of bank finance to  the priority sector and other sectors and to promote banks ' role in the overall development of the rural sector. For coordinating the activities in the district, a particular bank is assigned \u2018Lead Bank\u2019 responsibility of the district. The Lead Bank is expected to assume a leadership role for coordinating the efforts of the credit institutions and the Government.    (iv)  In view of the several changes that had taken place in the financial sector, the Lead Bank Scheme was last reviewed by the High Level Committee headed by Smt. Usha Thorat, the then Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in 2009.  (v)  The High Level Committee held wide ranging discussions with various stakeholders viz. State Governments, banks, development institutions, academicians, NGOs, MFIs etc. and noted that the Scheme has been useful in achieving its original objectives of improvement in br anch expansion, deposit mobilisation and lending to the priority sector, especially in rural/semi urban areas.  5  There was overwhelming consensus that the Scheme needs to continue. Based on the recommendations of the Committee, the guidelines were issued to SLBC Convenor banks and Lead Banks for implementation.  (vi) Envisaging greater role for private sector banks, Lead Banks were advised to ensure that private sector banks are more closely involved in the implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme. Private sector banks should involve themselves more actively by leveraging on Information Technology bringing in their expertise in strategic planning. They should also involve themselves in the preparation as well as implementation of the District Credit Plan.   (vii)  In view of the changes that have taken place in the financial sector over the years, the Reserve Bank of India had constituted a \u201cCommittee of Executive Directors\u201d of the Bank to study the efficacy of the Scheme and suggest measures for its improvement. Based on the Committee\u2019s recommendations and feedback received from various stakeholders, certain \u2018action points\u2019 were issued to SLBC Convenors/Lead Banks and NABARD on April 6, 2018.   2.  Fora under Lead Bank Scheme 2.1     Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) is a forum for achieving coordination between credit institutions and field level development agencies at the block level . The forum prepares and reviews the implementation of the Block Credit Plan and also resolves operational problems in the implementation of the credit programmes of banks. The Lead District Manager (LDM) of the district is the Chairman of the Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee. All the banks operating in the block including the Small Finance Banks, Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks, RRBs, the District Central Co-operative Banks, Block Development Officer, technical officers in the block, such as extension officers for agriculture, industries and co-operatives are members of the Committee. BLBC meetings are held at quarterly intervals. To strengthen the BLBC forum which operates at the base level of the Lead Bank Scheme, it is necessary that all branch managers attend BLBC meetings and enrich the discussions with their valuable inputs. Controlling Heads of banks 6  may also attend a few of the BLBC meetings selectively. Participation by the District Development Manager (DDM) of NABARD in BLBCs would ensure better and more meaningful discussions for the development of the Block. Therefore, NABARD has been advised that DDMs should attend all Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee meetings in their district and actively participate in the credit planning exercise and review meetings at the block level.  The Lead District Officer (LDO) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) selectively attends the BLBC meetings. The representatives of Panchayat Samitis are also invited to attend the meetings at half yearly intervals so as to share their knowledge and experience on rural development in the credit planning exercise. Payments Banks should also be invited to attend the meetings.   2.2 District Consultative Committee (DCC)   2.2.1 Constitution of DCC The District Consultative Committees were constituted in the early seventies as a common forum at the district level for bankers as well as Government agencies/departments to facilitate coordination in implementing various developmental activities under the Lead Bank Scheme. The District Collector is the Chairman of the DCC meetings. Reserve Bank of India, NABARD, al l the commercial banks including Small Finance Banks Wholly  Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks, RRBs, Payments Banks, co-operative banks including the District Central Cooperative Bank (DCCB), various State Government departments and allied agencies are the members of the DCC. The Lead District Officer (LDO) represents the Reserve Bank as a member of the DCC.  The Lead District Manager (LDM) convenes the DCC meetings. The Director of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Institute (MSME-DI) in the district is an invitee in districts where MSME clusters are located to discuss issues concerning MSMEs.    2.2.2 Conduct of DCC Meetings   i) DCC meetings should be convened by the Lead Banks at quarterly intervals. ii) At the DCC level, sub-committees as appropriate, may be set up to work intensively on specific issues and submit reports to the DCC for its consideration.  7  iii) DCC should give adequate feedback to the SLBC on various issues that need to be discussed on a wider platform, so that these receive adequate attention at the State Level.  2.2.3 Agenda for DCC Meetings   While Lead Banks are expected to address the problems particular to the concerned districts, some of the important areas which are common to all districts which the lead banks should invariably discuss in the fora are as under:  i) Review of progress under financial inclusion plan (FIP). ii) The specific issues inhibiting and enabling IT enabled financial inclusion  iii) Issues to facilitate 'enablers' and remove/minimise 'impeders' for banking development for inclusive growth  iv) Monitoring initiatives for providing 'Credit Plus' activities by banks and State Governments such as setting up of Financial Literacy Centres  (FLCs) and RSETI\n# type Training Institutes for providing skills and capacity building to manage businesses.  v) Scaling up financial literacy efforts to achieve financial inclusion.  vi) Review of performance of banks under District Credit Plan (DCP)  vii) Flow of credit to priority sector and weaker sections of the society  viii) Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022 ix) Assistance under Government sponsored schemes  x) Grant of educational loans  xi) Progress under SHG - bank linkage  xii) SME financing & bottlenecks thereof, if any  xiii) Timely submission of data by banks  xiv) Review of relief measures (in case of natural calamities wherever applicable)  The above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. The lead banks may include any other agenda item considered necessary.   # Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) should be more actively involved and monitored at various fora of LBS particularly at the DCC level. Focus should be on development of skills to enhance the credit absorption capacity in the area and renewing the training programmes towards sustainable micro enterprises. RSETIs should design specific programmes for each district/ block, keeping in view 8  the skill mapping and the potential of the region for necessary skill training and skill up gradation of the rural youth in the district.   2.2.4 Role of LDMs   As the effectiveness of the Lead Bank Scheme depends on the dynam ism of the District Collectors and the Lead District Managers (LDMs), with supportive role of the Regional/Zonal Office, the office of LDM should be sufficiently strengthened with appropriate infrastructural support being the focal point for  the successful implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme. Apart from the provision of a separate office space, technical infrastructure like computers, printer, data connectivity, etc. which are basic necessities for LDMs to discharge their core responsibilities  may be provided to LDMs\u2019 Office without exception.  Officers of appropriate level , attitude and possessing requisite leadership skills should be posted as LDMs. Additionally, it is suggested that a dedicated vehicle may be provided to LDMs\u2019 to facilitate closer liaison with the bank officials, district administration officials as also to organise/ attend various financial literacy initiatives and meetings. The absence of a specialist officer/assistant for data entry/analysis is a common and major  issue faced by LDMs. Liberty to hire the services of skilled computer operator may be given to the LDMs to overcome the shortage of staff/ in case appropriate staff is not posted at LDM office .  Further, for successful functioning of the Lead Bank Scheme, we expect  Lead Banks to go the extra mile to provide facilities over and above the bare minimum to these critical field functionaries. Apart from the usual role of LDMs like convening meetings of the DCC/DLRC and periodical meetings of DDM/LDO/ Government officials  for resolving outstanding issues etc., the new functions envisaged for LDMs include the following:  i) Monitoring the implementation of the District Credit Plan  ii) Associate with the setting up of Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs), RSETIs by banks  iii) Associate with organizing financial literacy camps by FLCs and rural branches of banks. iv) Holding annual sensitisation workshops for banks and Government officials with participation by NGOs/Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)  9  v) Arranging for quarterly awareness and feedback public meetings, grievance redressal etc.   2.2.5 Quarterly Public Meeting and Grievance Redressal  The Lead District Manager should convene a quarterly public meeting at various locations in the district in coordination with the LDO of Reserve Bank, banks hav ing presence in the area and other stakeholders to generate awareness of the various banking policies and regulations relating to the common person, obtain feedback from the public and provide grievance redressal to the extent possible at such meetings or facilitate approaching the appropriate machinery for such redressal.   2.2.6 District Level Review Committee (DLRC) Meetings DLRC meetings are Chaired by the District Collector and attended by members of the District Consultative Committee (DCC). Public Representatives i.e. Local MPs/MLAs/ Zilla Parishad Chiefs are also invited to these meetings.  The DLRC meetings should be convened by the Lead Banks at least once in a quarter. The DLRC is a forum to review the pace and quality of the implementation of various programmes under the Lead Bank Scheme in the district . Hence, association of non- officials is considered useful. Lead Banks are required to ensure the presence of public representatives in DLRC meetings as far as possible. Therefore, Lead Banks should fix the date of DLRC meetings with due regard to the convenience of the representatives of the public i.e. MPs/MLAs etc. and invite and involve them in all functions conducted by the banks in the districts, such as opening of new banking outlets, distribution of Kisan Credit Cards, SHG credit linkage programmes , etc. Responses to queries from public representatives need to be accorded highest priority and attended to promptly. The follow up of the DLRC\u2019s decisions is required to be discussed in the DCC meetings.  2.2.7 DCC/DLRC meetings- Annual Calendar of Meetings i) DCC and DLRC are the important fora facilitating coordination among commercial banks, Government agencies and others at the district level to review and find solutions to the problems hindering developmental activities. Therefore, it is necessary that all the members participate and deliberate in these  meetings. On a review of the DCC/DLRC meetings, it was observed that late receipt/non- receipt of intimation of the date of meetings, clash of dates with other events, commonality of 10  dates etc., hinder participation of members in these meetings, thus undermining the prime objective of conducting the above meetings.  ii)   Lead Banks have, therefore, been advised to prepare an Annual Schedule of DCC and DLRC meetings on Calendar year basis for all districts in consultation with the Chairperson of the meetings, Lead District Officer of the RBI and Public Representatives in case of DLRC.  This yearly Calendar should be prepared in the beginning of each year and circulated to all members as advance intimation for blocking future dates to attend the DCC and DLRC meetings and the meetings should be conducted as per the calendar.  While preparing the Calendar , it should be ensured that DCC and DLRC meetings are not held simultaneously.   2.3 State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)   2.3.1 Constitution of SLBC  i) The State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) was constituted in April 1977, as an apex inter-institutional forum to create adequate coordination machinery in all States, on a uniform basis for development of the State. SLBC is chaired by the Chairman/ Managing Director/ Executive Director of the Convenor Bank. It comprises representatives of commercial banks including Small Finance Banks, Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks, RRBs, Payments Banks, State Cooperative Banks, RBI, NABARD, heads of Government departments including representatives from National Commission for Scheduled Castes/Tribes, National Horticulture Board, Khadi & Village Industries Commission etc. and representatives of financial institutions operating in a State, who come together and sort out coordination problems at the policy implementation level.  Representatives of various organizations from different sectors of the economy like industry bodies, retail traders, exporters, farmers\u2019 unions, etc. are special invitees in the SLBC meetings for discussing their specific problems, if any. SLBC meetings are held on quarterly basis. The responsibility for convening the SLBC meetings would be of the SLBC Convenor Bank of the State.   ii) Recognising that SLBCs, primarily as a committee of bankers at the State level, play an important role in the development of the State, illustrative guidelines on the conduct of State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee meetings have been issued. 11  2.3.2 Conduct of SLBC Meetings  i)  SLBC meetings are required to be held regularly at quarterly intervals.  The meetings are chaired by the Chairman/ Managing Director/ Executive Director of the Convenor Bank and co-chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary or Development Commissioner of the State concerned.  In cases where the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer/Executive Director of the SLBC Convenor Bank is unable to attend SLBC Meetings, the Regional Director of the RBI shall co-chair the meetings along with the Additional Chief Secretary/Development Commissioner of the State concerned. A High Level of participation in SLBC/UTLBC meetings ensures an effective and desired outcome with meaningful discussion on issues of public policy of both the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India.  ii)  The Chief Minister/Finance Minister and senior level officers of the State/RBI (of the rank of Deputy Governor / Executive Director) may be invited to attend the SLBC meetings.  Further, the State Chief Ministers are encouraged to attend at least one SLBC meeting in a year.  iii)  State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee meetings should primarily focus on policy issues with participation of only the senior functionaries of the banks/ Government Departments.  All routine issues may be delegated to sub- committee(s) of the SLBC. A Steering Sub-committee may be constituted in the SLBC to deliberate on agenda proposals from different stakeholders and finalise a compact agenda for the SLBC meetings. Typically, the Sub-Committee could consist of SLBC Convenor, RBI & NABARD representatives & senior State Government representative from the concerned department, e.g. Finance/ Institutional Finance and two to three banks having major presence.   iv) Other issue-specific sub-committees may be constituted as required.  The sub committees may examine the specific issues relating to agriculture, micro, small/medium industries/enterprises, handloom finance, export promotion and financial inclusion, etc. in-depth and devise solutions/recommendations for adoption by the full committee. They are expected to meet more frequently than the SLBC. The composition of the sub-committees and subjects/ specific issues impeding/enabling financial inclusion to be deliberated upon, may vary from State to State depending on the specific problems/issues faced by the States.   12  v)   The secretariat/offices of the SLBC should be sufficiently strengthened to enable the SLBC Convenor Bank to effectively discharge its functions.   vi)  The various fora at lower levels may give adequate feedback to the SLBC on issues that need to be discussed on a wider platform.   vii)   Several institutions and academicians are engaged in research,  studies etc. that have implications for sustainable development in agriculture and MSME sector. Engaging with such research institutions and academicians would be useful in bringing in new ideas for furthering the objectives of the Lead Bank Scheme. The SLBCs may, therefore, identify such academicians and researchers and invite them as 'special invitees' to attend SLBC meetings occasionally both for adding value to the discussions and also associate them with studies appropriate to the State. Other 'special invitees' may be invited to attend SLBC meetings depending on the agenda items/issues to be discussed in the meetings.   viii)  The activities of NGOs in facilitating and channelling credit to the low income households are expected to increase in the coming years. Several corporate houses are also engaged in corporate social responsibility activities for sustainable development. A linkage with such NGOs/Corporate houses operating in the area to ensure that the NGOs/corporates provide the necessary 'credit plus' services can help leverage bank credit for inclusive growth. Success stories could be presented in SLBC meetings to serve as models that could be replicated.    2.3.3 Revised Agenda for SLBC Meetings  1.

Any other item, with the permission of the Chair  15  The above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. SLBC Convenor Banks may include any other agenda item considered necessary.   2.3.4   SLBC - Yearly Calendar of Meetings  i)  To improve the effectiveness and streamline the functioning of SLBC/UTLBC meetings, SLBC Convenor Banks have been advised to prepare a yearly calendar of programmes (calendar year basis) in the beginning of the year itself, for conducting the meetings. The calendar of programmes should clearly specify the cut off dates for data submission to SLBC and acceptance thereof by the SLBC Convenor. This yearly calendar should be circulated to all the concerned as an advance intimation for blocking of future dates of senior functionaries of various agencies like Central Government, State Governments, banks, RBI, etc. The SLBC/UTLBC meetings should be conducted as per the calendar under all circumstances. The agenda should also be circulated in advance without waiting for the data from defaulting banks. The matter should, however, be taken up with the defaulting banks in the SLBC meeting. In addition, the SLBC Convenor Bank should write a letter in this regard to the controlling office of the defaulting banks under advice to the Regional Office of RBI. The SLBC Convenor Bank will, however, continue to follow-up with banks for timely data submission. Further, in case the Chief Minister, Finance Minister or other very senior functionaries are not able to attend the SLBC on some very rare occasion, then if so desired by them, a special SLBC meeting can be held.  Following broad guidelines should be used for preparation of the calendar of programmes:   \nActivity  To be completed by (Date)  \nPrepa ration of calendar of SLBC/UTLBC \nmeetings and intimation to all the concerned \nof the cut- off dates for submission of data \nand dates of meetings as per the dateline \ngiven below. 15th January every year  \nReminder regarding the exact date of \nmeeting and submi ssion of data by banks to \nSLBC 15 days before end of the quarter  \nDead line for receipt of information/data by \nSLBC Convenor Bank 15 days from the end of the quarter  \nDistribution of ag enda cum background \npapers 20 days from the end of the quarter  16  \nHolding  of the meeting  \n Within 45 days from the end of the \nquarter \nForwarding the minutes of the meeting to all \nstakeholders Within 10 days from holding the \nmeeting \nFollow -up of the action p oints emerged from \nthe meeting To be completed within 30 days of \nforwarding the minutes (for review in the next meeting) \n      ii)   The objective of preparing the calendar of meetings in the beginning of the year is to ensure adequate notice of these meetings and timely compilation and dispatch of agenda papers to all stakeholders. It also ensures clear cut guidelines for the submission of data to SLBC Convenors by participating banks & Government Departments. It is expected to save precious time of SLBC C onvenors otherwise spent in taking dates from various senior functionaries attending these SLBC meetings.  iii)  SLBC Convenor Banks need to appreciate the advantages of ensuring adherence to the yearly calendars.  SLBC Convenor Banks have therefore been advised to give wide publicity to the annual calendar at the beginning of the year and ensure that dates of senior functionaries expected to attend the meetings are blocked for all meetings by their offices.  In case, despite blocking dates, if for some reason, the senior functionary is not able to attend the meeting, the meeting should be held as planned in the calendar.  More importantly, the data for review in these meetings should be received as per deadlines set in the calendar and those who do not submit the data in time should be asked to explain the reasons for delay in sending the data that may be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Under no circumstance, should the preparation of the agenda be delayed beyond the dates stipulated as per the calendar.  2.3.5 SLBC Website \u2013 Standardisation of information /data  SLBC Convenor Banks are required to maintain the SLBC websites where all instructions pertaining to LBS and Government Sponsored Schemes are made available and are accessible to the common man desiring any information relating to the conduct of meetings or State-wise data/bank-wise performance. In order to standardize the information and data that is to be made available on the SLBC website, an indicative list of the information & data is giv en in the Annex II\n.  SLBCs 17  should arrange to place the prescribed minimum information on the websites of SLBCs of their bank and keep it updated regularly, at least on quarterly basis. Banks may note that the list is only indicative and SLBCs are free to put any additional information considered relevant for the State.   2.3.6 Liaison with State Government   SLBC Convenor Banks are expected to co-ordinate the activities of all banks in the State, discuss with State Government officials, the operational problems in lending, extending necessary support for banking development and to achieve the objective of financial inclusion. 2.3.7 Capacity Building/Training/Sensitization Programmes   i) There is a need for sensitising the District Collectors and CEOs of Zil la Parishads on banks and banking in general as also on the specific scope and role of the Lead Bank Scheme. In each State, a full day \u2018Sensitisation W orkshop\u2019 may be convened by the SLBC Convenor Bank every year, preferably in April/May. Such sensitisation should form part of the probationary training of such officers. Further, as soon as they are posted in a district, the SLBC may arrange for exposure visits for the District Collectors to the SLBC Convenor\u2019s office for sensitisation and understanding of t he Lead Bank Scheme.   ii) Staff at the operational level of banks and government agencies associated with implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme need to be aware of the latest developments and emerging opportunities. There is need for staff sensitisation/  training/seminars, etc. at periodic intervals on an ongoing basis.  3. Implementation of Lead Bank Scheme  3.1 Preparation of credit plans Planning plays an important role in the implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme and a bottom-up approach is adopted to map the existing potential for development.  Under LBS, planning starts with identifying block-wise/ activity-wise potential estimated for various sectors.  18  3.2 Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) i) Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) are a step towards decentralized credit planning with the basic objective of mapping the existing potential for development through bank credit. PLPs take into account the long term physical potential, availability of infrastructure support, marketing facilities, and policies/programmes of Government etc.  NABARD to take measures to ensure that PLPs should be more focussed and implementable so that banks can utilize them  more gainfully while preparing the Branch Credit Plan. PLPs should emphasise on promotion of sustainable agricultural practices suitable to local conditions. While preparing the PLPs, the focus must be on identifying processes and projects that :  a. reduce the carbon foot-print, b. prevent the overuse of fertilizers, c. ensure efficient utilisation of water and  d. address agricultural pollution issues. \n \nThe plans must also focus on promoting innovative farming systems such as organic farming, bio dynamic farming, permaculture and sustainable small -scale farming, as also promoting Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and Farmers\u2019 Markets. Such initiatives must be supported by appropriate investments and project finance frameworks.  ii) A pre-PLP meeting is convened by LDM during June every year to be attended by banks, Government agencies, etc., to reflect their views and c oncerns regarding credit potential (sector/activity-wise) and deliberate on major financial and socio-economic developments in the district in the last one year and priorities to be set out for inclusion in the PLP. The DDM of NABARD makes a presentation in this meeting outlining the major requirements of information for preparing the PLP for the following year. The preparation of PLP for the next year is to be completed by August every year to enable the State Government to factor in the PLP projections.   iii) The procedure for preparing the District Credit Plan is as follows:  a) Controlling Offices of commercial banks including Small Finance Banks, Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks and Head Office of RRB and DCCB/LDB circulate the accepted block-wise/activity-wise potential to all 19  their branches for preparing the Branch Credit Plans (BCP) by their respective branch managers.  Banks should ensure that the exercise of preparation of branch/block plans is completed in time by all branches so that the Credit Plans become operational on time. b) A special Block Level Bankers' Committee (BLBC) meeting is  convened for each block where the Branch Credit Plans are discussed and aggregated to form the Block Credit Plan.  The DDM and the LDM guide the BLBC in finalizing the plan, ensuring that the Block Credit Plan is in tune with the potentials identified activity-wise including in respect of Government Sponsored Schemes.   \n \nc) All the Block Credit Plans of the district are aggregated by the LDM to form the District Credit Plan (DCP). This plan indicates an analytical assessment of the credit needs of the district to be deployed by all the financial institutions operating in the district and the total quantum of funds to be earmarked as credit by all the financial institutions for a new financial year. The Zonal/Controlling Offices of banks, while finalizing their business plans for the year, should take into account the commitments made in the DCP which should be ready well in time before the performance budgets are finalized.   \n \nd) The District Credit Plan is then placed before the DCC by the Lead District Manager for final acceptance/approval.  All the District Credit Plans are eventually aggregated into a State Level Credit Plan to be prepared by SLBC Convenor Bank and launched by the 1st of April every year.   \n \ne) The corporate business targets for branches, blocks, districts and states may be aligned with the Annual Credit Plans (ACP) to ensure better implementation. The Controlling Offices of the banks in each stat e should synchronize their internal business plans with the ACP. 3.3   Monitoring the Performance of Credit Plans The performance of the credit plans is reviewed in the various fora created under the Lead Bank Scheme as shown below:  20  \nAt Block Level  Block L evel Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC)  \nAt District Level  District Consultative Committee (DCC) & District \nLevel Review Committee (DLRC) \nAt State Level  State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)  \n                                                        Monitoring of LBS by RBI - Monitoring Information System (MIS)  i)  Data on Annual Credit Plan (ACP) is an important element to review the flow of credit in the State.  ACP formats are aligned with the extant reporting guidelines on priority sector lending. Accordingly, the ACP is to be prepared considering the categories of priority sector that would include Agriculture, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Export Credit, Education, Housing, Social Infrastructure, Renewable Energy and Others.  Further, it has been decided that bank loans to Micro/Small and Medium Enterprises (Services), engaged in providing or rendering of services as defined in terms of investment in equipment under MSMED Act, 2006, shall qualify under priority sector without any credit cap.  Accordingly,  the applicable loan limits per borrower to Micro/Small Enterprises (\u20b9 5 crore) and Medium Enterprises (\u20b9 10 crore) under the MSMEs Sector (Services) for classification under priority sector have been removed.  The reporting statement for ACP target is LBS-MIS-I (\nAnnex \nIV), statement for disbursement and outstanding LBS-MIS-II (Annex V ) and ACP \nachievement vis-\u00e0-vis ACP target, LBS-MIS-III ( Annex VI ).  SLBC Convenor Banks/ \nLead Banks have been advised to prepare the statements LBS MIS I, II and III as per the revised formats starting from the financial year 2018- 19.  They should prepare the bank group wise statements of LBS-MIS-I, II and III as per the prescribed formats and also place these statements for meaningful review in  all DCC and SLBC meetings.  \nii)  In order to maintain consistency and integrity of data with the A ll-India data of scheduled commercial banks and facilitate a meaningful review/analysis of data, the ACP data needs to be grouped separately for scheduled commercial banks and other banks like State Cooperative Banks, DCCBs, etc. while presenting in the DCC/SLBC meetings and submitting to our Regional Offices.  The data pertaining to scheduled commercial banks needs to be further grouped into public sector banks, private sector banks, Regional Rural Banks, Small Finance Banks and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks to know the bank group wise position.   21  3.4   Revised mechanism of Data Flow for LBS fora meetings  At present, discussions at the quarterly meetings of the various LBS fora viz. State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC), District level Consultative Committee (DCC) and Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) primarily focus on the performance of banks in the disbursement of loans vis-a-vis the allocated target under the Annual Credit Plan. The integrity & timeliness of the data submitted by banks for the purpose has been an issue as a significant portion of this data is manually compiled and entered into the Data Management Systems of the SLBC Convenor Banks. The extent to which this data corresponds with the data present in the Core Banking Solution (CBS) of the respective banks also varies significantly. Therefore, there is need of a standardized system to be developed on the website maintained by each SLBC to enable uploading and downloading of the data pertaining to the Block, District as well as the State. The relevant data must also be directly downloadable from the CBS and/ or MIS of the banks with a view to keeping manual intervention to a minimal level in the process. The procedure relating to the envisaged intervention in this area is given below:  \nManagement of Data Flow at LBS Fora \u2013 Procedure \ni. Each bank\u2019s CBS should have a provision to generate a report pertaining to all LBS related data/ tables to Excel. This data should have information pertaining to all the branches operating in the state including fields/ columns for District & Block name. Access to Download & Export this data from the bank\u2019s CBS should be given to the Controlling Offices of the banks who would be solely responsible for the process of \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 for all districts/ blocks within their jurisdiction.   \n \nii. The \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 process is the process of uploading this Excel file (downloaded in step (i) above) on the SLBC websites. SLBC websites should have a provision to \u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 all the data present in the Excel Sheet on the database of the SLBC website. This would obviate any manual \u2018data entry\u2019 at the SLBC/ Controlling Office level.  \n \niii. To facilitate the above functionality, each SLBC Convenor Ban k would have to add this \u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 functionality to their SLBC website along with the requisite capabilities at the back-end. \n 22  iv. The SLBC website would, thus, effectively work as a data aggregation platform. Further, data analysis capabilities could also be added to the SLBC websites depending on the available resources.  \n \nv. The SLBC websites should provide access to LDMs to download district and block specific data directly from this website thus ensuring integrity and timely availability of data. \n \nvi. There could still be some data pertaining to State Government Schemes/ other data that is not available on the CBS or MIS of the banks. This would have to be collated at the Controlling Office level as is done now. At the SLBC website, functionalities could be provided to enter this data too. This could then be downloaded by the LDMs for district/ block level reports. Banks may also add Open Format fields like \u2018text boxes\u2019 for data or information that is special or is entered/ used once in a while.    vii. Such a system ensures that LDMs & SLBC Convenor Banks have to do zero or minimal data entry/ feeding and all data is entered by a single \u2018custodian of data\u2019 which is the Controlling Office of each bank. Any information to be provided by Government extension agencies could also be similarly uploaded.  Necessary modifications may be made on the SLBC websites and to the CBS & MIS systems of all banks to implement the envisaged data flow mechanism . \n \nA Working Group of select SLBC Convenor banks and NABARD was constituted by RBI to work out a standardised system for collection, storage, presentation and management of data on the SLBC/ UTLBC website. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), which may be followed by SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks, member banks and LDMs, as suggested by the Working Group for management of the data flow is given at Annex III\n. \n 4.   Assignment of Lead Bank Responsibility  i) Lead Bank Scheme is administered by the Reserve Bank of India since 1969. The assignment of Lead Bank responsibility to designated banks in every district is done by the Reserve Bank of India following a detailed procedure formulated for this 23  purpose. As on June 30, 2020, 12 public sector banks and one private sector bank have been assigned Lead Bank responsibility in 726 districts of the country. ii) State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)/Union Territory Level Bankers' Committee (UTLBC), as an apex level forum at the State/Union Territory (UT) level, coordinates the activities of the financial institutions and Government departments in the State/Union Territory under the Lead Bank Scheme. SLBC/UTLBC Convenorship is assigned to banks for this purpose. As on June 30, 2020, the SLBC/ UTLBC convenorship of 28 States and 8 Union Territories has been assigned to 11 public sector banks and one private sector bank. A List of State/UT wise SLBC/UTLBC Convenor Banks and district wise Lead Banks is given in Annex I\n. \niii) The Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) has been extended to the districts in the metropolitan areas, thus bringing the entire country under the fold of the Lead Bank Scheme.  5.   Banking Penetration   i)  Over the years, the focus of the Lead Bank Scheme has shifted to inclusive growth and financial inclusion. The use of Information Technology (IT) and intermediaries has enabled banks to increase the outreach, scale and depth of banking services at affordable cost.   ii)   SLBC Convenor Banks / Lead Banks are advised to focus attention on the need for achieving 100% financial inclusion through penetration of banking services in the rural areas. Upon issuance of DoR revised guidelines on \u2018Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy\u2019 on May 18, 2017 clarifying on \u2018Banking Outlet\u2019, banks were advised to consider opening of a CBS-enabled banking outlet or a part time banking outlet, as the case may be, in unbanked rural centres.  iii)  SLBC Convenor Banks should take up with the State Governments, impeders such as issues of road/digital connectivity, conducive law and order situation, uninterrupted power supply, adequate security, etc. for ensuring banking expansion at all centres where penetration by the formal banking system is required. However, these impeders should not inhibit the scaling up of financial inclusion initiatives.   5.1   Roadmap for providing banking services in unbanked villages 24  In November 2009, a roadmap to provide banking services in villages with population more than 2000 was rolled out.  All the identified villages have been provided with banking services through branches, business correspondents or through other modes such as ATMs and mobile vans. Later, in June 2012, a roadmap to provide banking services in unbanked villages with less than 2,000 population was rolled out. SLBC Convenor Banks and Lead Banks were advised to complete the process of providing banking services in unbanked villages with population below 2000 by August 14, 2015.  5.2 Roadmap for opening brick and mortar branches in villages with population more than 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial bank  As brick and mortar branches are an integral component of financial inclusion, it was decided to focus on villages with population above 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial bank. This was to enable banks to provide quality financial services and timely support to BC outlets that would help in sustaining and strengthening the services provided through BCs and also ensur ing close supervision of BC operations. Accordingly, SLBC Convenor B anks were advised to identify villages with population above 5000 without a bank branch of a sc heduled commercial bank in their State and allot these villages among scheduled commercial banks (including Regional Rural Banks) for opening of branches.    5.3   Aligning roadmap for unbanked villages having population more than 5000 with revised Guidelines on Branch Authorisation Policy   In terms of circular DBR.No.BAPD.BC.69/22.01.001/2016-17 dated May 18, 2017\n \nissued by DoR on \u2018Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy - Revision of Guidelines\u2019, final guidelines on \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 have been issued with a view to facilitate financial inclusion as also to provide flexibility to banks on the choice of delivery channel.  Accordingly, SLBC Convenor Banks have been advised to identify all unbanked rural centres (URCs) in the State, compile and maintain an updated list of all such centres. The updated list should be displayed on the website of each SLBC to facilitate banks to choose/indicate the place/centre where they wis h to open a \u2018banking outlet\u2019. \n 25  ii)   Further, SLBC Convenor Banks have been advised that in order to comply with the criteria of opening at least 25 percent of the total banking outlets in unbanked rural centres in Tier 5 & 6  centres, as  prescribed  vide DoR  circular dated May 18, 2017,  banks should give priority to villages without a banking outlet having population more than 5000 (i.e. Tier 5 centres) and ensure that all such villages under their jurisdiction are covered with a CBS-enabled Banking Outlet on priority basis.   iii)  The updated list of unbanked rural centres should be tabled in all SLBC meetings during discussions on the progress of providing banking services in unbanked rural centres.   5.4 National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI): 2019- 2024 \u2013 Universal Access to Financial Services  Providing banking access to every village within a 5 KM radius / hamlet of 500 households in hilly areas has been one of the key objectives of the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI): 2019-2024. Accordingly, SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor banks have been advised to review the presence of banking outlets of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and Payments Banks (PBs) in every village within a 5 K M radius / hamlet of 500 households in hilly areas under their jurisdiction(s) and ensure that universal access to financial services are provided to all such villages.   6. Credit Deposit Ratio (CD Ratio)  6.1   CD Ratio of Banks in Rural and Semi-Urban Areas  Banks have been advised to achieve a CD Ratio of 60 percent in respect of their rural and semi-urban branches separately on an All-India basis. While it is not necessary that this ratio should be achieved separately, branch-wise, district-wise or region-wise, the banks should, nevertheless, ensure that wide disparity in the ratios between different States / Regions is avoided in order to minimise regional imbalance in credit deployment. The credit dispensation in certain districts is very low, as a result of various factors such as lack of necessary infrastructure, varying ability of different regions to absorb credit, etc. Banks may review the performance of 26  their bank branches in such areas and take necessary steps to augment the credit flow. The Lead Banks may discuss the problem in all its aspects with the other financial institutions in the district and also in the DCC forum.    6.2    Implementation of the Recommendations of the Expert Group on CD Ratio  i)   An Expert Group was constituted by the Government of India to go into the nature and magnitude of the problem of low CD Ratio across States / Regions and to suggest steps to overcome the problem. The Expert Group examined the problems and causes of low CD Ratio and made recommendations. As per the recommendations, the CD Ratio of banks should be monitored at different levels based on the following parameters \u2013 \nInstitution / Level  Indicator  \nIndividual Banks at Head Office  Cu + RIDF  \nState Level (SLBC)  Cu + RIDF  \nDistrict Level  Cs \n Where:   Cu = Credit as per place of Utilization Cs = Credit as per place of Sanction RIDF = Total Resource support provided to States under RIDF Further, banks are advised that:   \u2022 In the districts having CD Ratio less than 40 percent, Special Sub-Committees (SSCs) of the DCC shall be set up to monitor the CD Ratio. \u2022 Districts having CD Ratio between 40 and 60 percent, shall be monitored under the existing system by the DCC, and \u2022 The district with CD Ratio of less than 20 percent need to be treated on a special footing.  ii)  Special Sub-Committees (SSCs) of the DCC should be set up in the districts having CD Ratio less than 40 percent, in order to monitor the CD Ratio and to draw up Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs) to increase the CD R atio. The Lead District Manager (LDM) is designated as the Convenor of the SSC which, in addition to the District Co-ordinators of banks functioning in the area, should comprise of the LDO of RBI, the DDM of NABARD, the District Planning Officer or a representative of the Collector duly empowered to take decisions on behalf of the district administration.  27  The functions of the Special Sub-Committee are as under: \u2022 The SSCs should draw up Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs) for improving the CD Ratio in their districts on a self-set graduated basis. \u2022 For this purpose, the SSC should hold a special meeting immediately after its constitution and on the basis of the various ground level parameters, set for itself, a target for increasing the CD Ratio initially for the current year. It will also, at the same meeting, set a definite time frame to achieve a CD Ratio more than 60 percent in annual increments. \u2022 Consequent to the completion of this process, the target and time frame self set by the SSC should be placed before the DCC for approval. \u2022 The plans for implementation must then be taken up by the SSC and monitored assiduously once in two months. \u2022 The SSC should report the progress on the implementation of the plan to the DCC on a quarterly basis and through them to the Convenor of the SLBC. \u2022 On the basis of the feedback received from the DCC regarding the progress in the implementation of the Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs), a consolidated report should be prepared by the SSC and tabled at all SLBC meetings for discussion / information. iii)  As regards the districts with a CD Ratio less than 20 percent, these are generally located in hilly, desert or inaccessible terrains and / or those dependent solely on the primary sector and/ or characterized by a breakdown of the law and order machinery. In such areas, conventional methods are not likely to work unless the banking system and the State Government come together in a specially meaningful way.  iv) While the framework for implementation for raising the CD Ratio in these districts will be the same as in the case of districts with CD Ratio below 40 percent (i.e. setting up of SSC etc.), the focus of attention and the level of efforts should be of a much higher scale. For this,  \u2022 All such districts should first be placed in a special category.  \u2022 Thereafter, the responsibility for increasing their CD Ratio should be taken by banks and State Governments and the districts should be \"adopted\" by the District Administration and the Lead Bank jointly. 28  \u2022 While banks would be responsible for credit disbursement, the State Government would be required to give an upfront commitment regarding its responsibilities for creation of identified rural infrastructure together with support in creating an enabling environment for banks to lend and to recover their dues.  \u2022 Progress in the special category districts should be monitored at the district level and reported to the corporate offices of the concerned banks.  \u2022 The Chairmen/ Managing Directors of banks should give special attention to the CD Ratio in such districts.  7.   Direct Benefit Transfer  \nDirect Benefit Transfer (DBT) was rolled out by the Government of India in selected districts in January 2013. It was expanded to other districts subsequently.  SLBC Convenor Banks were advised to co-ordinate with the Government authorities to implement DBT.  Banks were advised to include the status of the roll-out of DBT as a regular agenda item for discussion in SLBC meetings as part of Financial Inclusion/Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) implementation. As a prerequisite to the implementation of the DBT, every eligible individual should have a bank account. Further, to make disbursements at the doorstep through the ICT- based BC model, banking outlets either through brick & mortar branches or the branchless mode is  needed in all villages across the country.  Hence, banks have been advised to:  \n\u2022 take steps to complete the opening of bank accounts and seeding of Aadhaar numbers in all bank accounts.  \u2022 closely monitor the progress in seeding of Aadhaar number with the bank accounts of beneficiaries. \u2022 put in place a system to provide the beneficiary of the seeding request an acknowledgement and also send a confirmation of the seeding of Aadhaar number. \u2022 form a DBT Implementation Co-ordination Committee, along with the State Government department concerned, at district level and review the seeding of Aadhaar numbers in bank accounts.  29  \u2022 ensure that district and village wise names and other details of  business correspondents (BCs) engaged/other arrangements made by the bank are  displayed on the SLBC website. \u2022 set up a Complaint Grievance Redressal mechanism in each bank and nominate a Complaint Redressal Officer in each district, to redress the grievances related to \u2018seeding of Aadhaar number in bank accounts'.   Banks were further advised to ensure that opening of bank accounts and seeding of Aadhaar numbers with existing or new accounts of eligible beneficiaries opened for the purpose of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) under social welfare schemes, was in conformity with the provisions listed under Section 16 of the Master Direction -  Know Your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016 (updated as on May 29, 2019) and extant provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering (PML) Rules.   8. Service Area Approach (SAA)  i) The Service Area Approach (SAA), introduced in April 1989 for planned and orderly development of rural and semi-urban areas was applicable to all scheduled commercial banks including Regional Rural Banks.  Under SAA, each bank branch in a rural or semi-urban area was designated to serve an area of 15 to 25 villages  and the branch was responsible for meeting the needs of bank credit of  its service area.  The primary objective of SAA was to increase productive lending and forge effective linkages between bank credit, production, productivity and increase in income levels.  The SAA scheme was reviewed from time to time and appropriate changes were made in the scheme to make it more effective.   ii) The Service Area Approach scheme was reviewed in December 2004 and it was decided to dispense with the restrictive provisions of the scheme while retaining the positive features of the SAA such as credit planning and monitoring of the credit purveyance. Accordingly, under SAA, the allocation of villages among the rural and semi-urban branches of banks were made not applicable for lending except under Government Sponsored Schemes. Thus, while the commercial banks and RRBs are free to lend in any rural and semi-urban area, the borrowers have the choice of approaching any branch for their credit requirements.  30    8.1 Dispensing with \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019  In order to ensure hassle free credit to all borrowers, especially in rural and semi- urban areas and keeping in view the technological developments and the different ways available with banks to avoid multiple financing, banks have been advised to dispense with obtaining a \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 from the individual borrowers (including SHGs & JLGs) in rural and semi-urban areas for all types of loans including loans under Government Sponsored Schemes, irrespective of the amount involved unless the Government Sponsored Scheme itself provides for obtention of a \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019. Further, it is clarified that the policy of dispensing with a \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 for lending by banks is also applicable to urban areas including metropolitan cities.  ii)   Banks are encouraged to use an alternative framework of due diligence as part of the credit appraisal exercise other than the \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 which could, among others, consist of one or more of the following: \u2022 Credit history check through Credit Information Companies (CICs) \u2022 Self-declaration or an affidavit from the borrower \u2022 CERSAI registration \u2022 Peer monitoring \u2022 Information sharing among lenders \u2022 Information search (writing to other lenders with an auto deadline)   iii) Banks are also advised to submit information/data to all Credit Information Companies (CICs), as required in terms of extant instructions issued by RBI.   9.   Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022 i)  The Government of India, in the Union Budget 2016-17, had announced its resolve to double the income of farmers by 2022. Several steps have been taken towards attaining this objective including setting up of an inter -ministerial committee for preparation of a blue print for the same. This agenda has also been reiterated by the government in several fora and has acquired primacy from the point of view of rural and agricultural development. 31  ii) The strategy to achieve this goal, inter-alia, includes,   \n\u2022 Focus on irrigation with large budgets, with the aim of \"per drop, more crop\"  \n\u2022 Provision of quality seeds and nutrients based on soil health of each field  \n\u2022 Investments in warehousing and cold chains to prevent post -harvest crop losses \n\u2022 Promotion of value addition through food processing \n\u2022 Creation of a national farm market, removing distortions and development of  infrastructure such as e-platform across 585 stations \n\u2022 Strengthening of the crop insurance scheme to mitigate risks at affordable cost \n\u2022 Promotion of ancillary activities like poultry, bee-keeping and fisheries iii. Needless to emphasize that acceleration in income generation is significantly dependent on better capital formation in agriculture. Towards this, banks should revisit their documentation for crop loans, simplify them where required and ensure speedy sanctioning and disbursal of loans within specified time limits.   iv. The Lead Bank Scheme, which ensures inter-departmental/governmental coordination in the financial sector, should, therefore, be leveraged to further the objective of doubling farmers\u2019 income by 2022. Lead Banks are accordingly advised to ensure the following: a. Work closely with NABARD in the preparation of Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) & Annual Credit Plans (ACPs) keeping the above strategy in consideration b. Include \u2018Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022\u2019 as a regular agenda under the Lead Bank Scheme in various fora such as SLBC, DCC, DLRC and BLBC  c. For the purpose of monitoring and reviewing the progress, Lead B anks may use the benchmarks as may be provided by NABARD  d. Map the overall strategy as given in para 9 (ii) above to the agriculture/agro-ancillary lending plan of the bank.  10. Expanding and Deepening of Digital Payments Ecosystem   32   With a view to expanding and deepening the digital payments ecosystem, t he SLBCs/UTLBCs were advised to identify one district in their respective States/UTs on a pilot basis in consultation with banks and stakeholders and allocate it to a bank with significant footprint which will endeavour to make the district 100% digitally enabled within one year, in order to enable every individual in the district to make/ receive payments digitally in a safe, secure, quick, affordable and convenient manner. SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks were also advised to devise a time bound roadmap to all branches of member banks (Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks, Regional Rural Banks, Small Finance Banks and Payments Banks) located in the identified district(s) for on-boarding merchants/ traders/ businesses/ utility service providers to facilitate fully digital transactions.  Further, SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks were advised to constitute a Sub-Committee on Digital Payments at SLBC/ UTLBC level.  11.

Banks may continue to access overnight funds under the MSF against their excess SLR \nholding as advised in our circular FMD.No.65/01.18.001/11-12 dated December 21, 2011 . \n \nYours faithfully   (Dr. S K Kar)    Chief General Manager   ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/259MSFE3EA811D8394E4DD8B6989A714CBCD466.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 24, 2020", "info": "\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, 2\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932, \u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001 \u0926\u0942\u0930\u0927\u094d\u0935\u0928\u0940:+91-22-22709038, \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932:helpdnbr@rbi.org.in Department of Regulation, Central Office, 2\nnd Floor, Main Office Building ,ShahidBhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  Mumbai \u2013 400 001 Tel No:+91-22-22709038,  Email: helpdnbr@rbi.org.in   \ufffd\u0939\u0902\u0926\u0940\u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948, \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e \ufffd\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u0922\u093e\u0908\u092f\u0947\n \nRBI/2019-20/258 DOR (NBFC) (PD) CC. No.112/03.10.001/2019-20                                    \nJune 24, 2020   \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) All Non-Banking Financial Companies (including Housing Finance Companies)  \nMadam/ Dear Sir,  \n \nLoans Sourced by Banks and NBFCs over Digital Lending Platforms:  \nAdherence to Fair Practices Code and Outsourcing Guidelines  \n \nIt has been observed that many digital platforms have emerged in the financial sector claiming to offer hassle free loans to retail individuals, small traders, and other borrowers. Banks and NBFCs are also seen to be engaging digital platforms to provide loans to their customers. In addition, some NBFCs have been registered with Reserve Bank as \u2018digital-only\u2019 lending entities while some NBFCs are registered to work both on digital and brick-mortar channels of credit delivery. Thus banks and NBFCs are observed to lend either directly through their own digital platforms or through a digital lending platform under an outsourcing arrangement. 2. It has further been observed that the lending platforms tend to portray themselves as lenders without disclosing the name of the bank/ NBFC at the backend, as a consequence of which, customers are not able to access grievance redressal avenues available under the regulatory framework. Of late, there are several complaints against the \nlending platforms  which primarily relate to exorbitant interest rates, non- transparent methods to calculate interest, harsh\n recovery measures, unauthorised use of personal data and bad\n behavior.  \n3. Although digital delivery in credit intermediation is a welcome development, concerns \nemanate from non-transparency of transactions and violation of extant guidelines on \noutsourcing of financial services and Fair Practices Code, etc. issued to banks and \nNBFCs, a reference to which is drawn in the Annex.  It is, therefore, reiterated that banks \nand NBFCs, irrespective of whether they lend through their own digital lending platform \nor through an outsourced lending platform, must adhere to the Fair Practices Code \nguidelines in letter and spirit. They must also meticulously follow regulatory instructions \non outsourcing of financial services and IT services.   4. It must be noted that outsourcing of any activity by banks/ NBFCs does not diminish \ntheir obligations, as the onus of compliance with regulatory instruc tions rests solely with \nthem. Wherever banks and NBFCs engage digital lending platforms as their agents to \nsource borrowers and/ or to recover dues, they must follow the following instructions:  \na) Names of digital lending platforms engaged as agents shall be  disclosed on the \nwebsite of banks/ NBFCs.  \nb) Digital lending platforms engaged as agents shall be directed to disclose upfront \nto the customer, the name of the bank/ NBFC on whose behalf they are \ninteracting with him.  \nc) Immediately after sanction but before execution of the loan agreement, the \nsanction letter shall be issued to the borrower on the letter head of the bank/ \nNBFC concerned. \nd) A copy of the loan agreement along with a copy each of all enclosures quoted in \nthe loan agreement shall be furnished to all borrowers at the time of sanction/ \ndisbursement of loans. \ne) Effective oversight and monitoring shall be ensured over the digital lending \nplatforms engaged by the banks/ NBFCs. \nf) Adequate efforts shall be made towards creation of awareness about the \ngrievance redressal mechanism. \n \n5. Any violation in this regard by banks and NBFCs (including NBFCs registered to \noperate on \u2018digital-only\u2019 or on digital and brick-mortar channels of delivery of credit) will \nbe viewed seriously.   \n \nYours faithfully \n \n \n(Manoranjan Mishra) \nChief General Manager \n \n \n   Annex \n \nReference to extant instructions \n \na) Para 2.5.2 (ii) (loan appraisal and terms/conditions) of \u2018Guidelines on Fair Practices \nCode for Lender\u2019 and Para 2.6 of \u2018Guidelines on Recovery Agents engaged by banks\u2019, of \nMaster Circular on \u2018Loans and Advances \u2013 Statutory and Other Restrictions\u2019 dated July \n01, 2015 ; \nb) Para 4 of Annex to circular on \u2018 Guidelines on Managing Risks and Code of Conduct in \nOutsourcing of Financial Services by banks\u2019 dated November 03, 2006  \nc) Para 8.5(b) of Master Circular on \u2018Customer Service in Banks\u2019 dated July 01, 2015 ; \nd) Para 29 (loan appraisal and terms/conditions) of the guidelines on Fair Practices Code \nand Para 4 of Annex XXV (Directions on Managing Risks and Code of Conduct in \nOutsourcing of Financial Services by NBFCs) of the Master Directions on Non-Banking \nFinancial Company - Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking Company and Deposit \ntaking Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016   \ne) Para 7.2 of Section A of Master Direction on \u2018Information Technology Framework for the \nNBFC Sector\u2019 dated June 08, 2017 ; and, \nf) Para 29 (loan appraisal and terms/conditions) of the guidelines on Fair Practices Code \nand Para 4.1 of Annex XIX (Directions on Managing Risks and Code of Conduct in \nOutsourcing of Financial Services by NBFCs) of the Master Directions on Non-Banking \nFinancial Company \u2013 Non-Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking Company \n(Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016 . \n***** \n \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/CCN112LNBCF387F4EE693D74EA6A70E6938C7CDCE47.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 22, 2020", "info": "", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTIFICATION3554EC37E9B34713BB667358852887D2.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 22, 2020", "info": " \nRBI/2019-20/257 Ref.No.3105/IDMD/08.02.032/2019-20                                                                     June 22, 2020\n   \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks  \nAll State Co-operative Banks/All Scheduled Primary  \n(Urban) Co-operative Banks/All Financial Institutions/  \nAll Primary Dealers.    \n Dear Sir/Madam,\n   \nAuction of Government of India Dated Securities  \n  \nGovernment of India has offered to sell (re-issue) three dated securities for a notified amount of \n`30,000 crore as per the following details: \n \nSr \nNo Security Notified \nAmount \n (in ` crore)  GoI Notification Auction Date Settlement \ndate \n1 5.22% GS 2025 12,000 F.No.4(5) W&M/2020 dated June 22, 2020 June 26, 2020 (Friday) \nJune 29 , 2020      \n(Monday) 2 6.19% GS 2034 11,000 \n3 7.16% GS 2050 7,000 \n  Total 30,000       \n \nGoI will have the option to retain additional subscription up to `2 ,000 crore each against any one or more of the above securities.

Reserve Bank has been taking measures to improve awareness through its e -BAAT programmes and organising campaigns on safe use of digital payment modes, to avoid sharing critical personal information like PIN, OTP, passwords, etc.   2. Inspite of these initiatives, incidence of frauds continue to bedevil digital users, often using the same modus operandi users were cautioned about, such as luring them to disclose vital payment information, swapping sim cards, opening links received in messages and mails, etc. There are also cases of users being tricked into downloading spurious apps that access critical information stored on devices. It is, therefore, essential that all payment systems operators and participants \u2013 banks and non-banks \u2013 continue and reinforce efforts to spread awareness about digital safety.   3. All authorised payment systems operators and participants are hereby advised to undertake targeted multi-lingual campaigns by way of SMSs, advertisements in print and visual media, etc., to educate their users on safe and secure use of digital payments.   4.

These instructions were issued with the approval of Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C & AG).  \n2. The office of C & AG has now advised that they have reconsidered the matter based on feedback received from the Accountants General and hence do not concur \nwith proposal of ignoring the penal interest amount of \u20b9  500/- or below. O/o C&AG has advised that they have withdrawn their concurrence given earlier based on which RBI had issued the instructions vide the above circular of \nSeptember 26, 2019  and have \nalso indicated that the AG offices are being advised that in all the cases of calculation of penal interest the ibid circular should not be taken into account.  \n3. Further, the O/o C&AG has also advised that since the circular No. RBI/2007/291 \nDGBA GAD.No. H-14061/31.04.008/2006-07 dated March 21, 2007  already provides \nfor a methodology to calculate penal interest based on transaction value of upto \u20b9 1 \nlakh and above \u20b9 1 lakh, there is no need for further filters of \u20b9 500/- or below (as per our circular DGBA.GAD.No.H-4831/42.01.011/2012-13 dated February 18, 2013).  2 \n  4. Accordingly, agency banks are advised that the \ncircular RBI/2019-20/70 \nDGBA.GBD.No.653/42.01.011/2019-20 dated September 26, 2019  stands withdrawn \nfrom the date of its issue.

As announced in the \nGovernor\u2019s \nStatement of May 22, 2020 , the intensification of COVID-19 disruptions has imparted priority to \nrelaxing repayment pressures and improving access to working capital by mitigating the burden of debt servicing, prevent the transmission of financial stress to the real economy, and ensure the continuity of viable businesses and households. Consequently, the detailed instructions in this regard are as follows: \n(i) Rescheduling of Payments \u2013 Term Loans and Working Capital Facilities 2. In  view of the extension of lockdown and continuing disruption on account of COVID -19, all commercial banks (including regional rural banks, small finance banks and local area banks), co-operative banks, All-India Financial Institutions, and Non-banking Financial Companies (including housing finance companies) (\u201clending institutions\u201d) are permitted to extend the moratorium by another three months i.e. from June 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 on payment of all instalments in respect of term loans (including agricultural term loans, retail and crop loans) . Accordingly, the repayment schedule for such loans as also the residual tenor, will be shifted across the board . Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period. \n3. In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash credit/overdraft (\u201cCC/OD\u201d), lending institutions are permitted to allow a deferment  of another three months, from June 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020, on recovery of interest applied in respect of all such facilities. Lending institutions are permitted, at their discretion, to convert the accumulated interest for the deferment period up to August 31, 2020, into a funded interest term loan (FITL) which shall be repayable not later than March 31, 2021.  (ii) Easing of Working Capital Financing  4. In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of CC/OD to borrowers facing stress on account of the economic fallout of the pandemic, lending institutions  may, as a one- time measure,  (i) recalculate the \u2018drawing power\u2019 by reducing the margins till August 31, 2020. However, in all such cases where such a temporary enhancement in drawing power is considered, the margins shall be restored to the original levels by March 31, 2021; and/or,   (ii) review the working capital sanctioned limits upto March 31, 2021, based on a reassessment of the working capital cycle.  5. The above measures shall be contingent on the lending institutions satisfying themselves that the same is necessitated on account of the economic fallout from COVID -19. Further, accounts provided relief under these instructions shall be subject to subsequent supervisory review with regard to their justifiability on account of the economic fallout from COVID -19. 6. Lending institutions may, accordingly, put in place a Board approved policy to implement the above measures. Asset Classification  7. The conversion of accumulated interest into FITL, as permitted in terms of paragraph 3 above, and the changes in the credit terms permitted to the borrowers to specifically tide over economic fallout from COVID-19 in terms of paragraph 4 above, will not be treated as concessions granted due to financial difficulty of the borrower, under Paragraph 2 of the Annex to the \nReserve Bank of \nIndia (Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets) Directions, 2019 dated June 7, \n2019  (\u2018Prudential Framework\u2019), and consequently, will not result in asset classification \ndowngrade.  \n8. In respect of accounts classified as standard as on February 29, 2020, even if overdue, the moratorium period, wherever granted in respect of term loans, shall be excluded by the lending institutions from the number of days past-due for the purpose of asset classification under the IRAC norms. The asset classification for such accounts shall be determined on the basis of revised due dates and the revised repayment schedule.  9. Similarly, in respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash credit/overdraft (\u201cCC/OD\u201d), where the account is classified as standard, including SMA, as on February 29, 2020, the deferment period, wherever granted in terms of paragraph 3 above shall be excluded for the determination of out of order status.  10. All other provisions of circulars dated March 27, 2020 and April 17, 2020\n shall remain \napplicable mutatis mutandis. \nYours faithfully, (Saurav Sinha) Chief General Manager-in-Charge  ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT2455D86E6F80D9D4BC29C0DFAA43D76D9A4.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 23, 2020", "info": "\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \ufffd\u0930\u091c\u0935\ufffd \u092c\ufffd\u0915 __________________RESERVE BANK OF INDIA _________________  \nwww.rbi.org.in \n \n \n______________________________________________________________________   \n\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\ufffd \u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0940 \u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\ufffd\u0932\u092f, \u0915\ufffd \u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0940 \u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\ufffd\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928, 12\u0935\u0940\u0902/ 13\u0935\u0940\u0902 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u095b\u0932, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\ufffd, \u092b\u094b\u091f\ufffd, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400001 \u091f\u0947\u0932\u0940\u092b\u094b\u0928/ Tel No: 22661602, 22601000 \u092b\u0948 \ufffd/ Fax No: 022-2270 5691   Department of Regulation, Central Office, Central Office Building, 12\nth/ 13th Floor, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  Mumbai \u2013 400001   \u093f\u0939\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948\n, \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0907\u090f  \n \nRBI/2019-20/243  DOR.No.BP.BC.70/21.01.003/2019-20                   May 23, 2020  All Scheduled Commercial Banks  (Excluding Regional Rural Banks)   Dear Sir/Madam,   Large Exposures Framework \u2013 Increase in Exposure to a Group of Connected Counterparties  Please refer to our circular No.DBR.No.BP.BC.43/21.01.003/2018-19 dated June 03, 2019\n on the \ncaptioned subject. In terms of para 5.2 of the circular, the sum of all the exposure values of a bank to a group of connected counterparties must not be higher than 25 percent of the bank\u2019s available eligible capital base at all times. \n 2. On account of the COVID-19 pandemic, debt markets and other capital market segments are witnessing heightened uncertainty. As a result, many corporates are finding it difficult to raise funds from the capital market and are predominantly dependent on funding from banks.

Accordingly, to ensure that farmers do not have to pay penal i nterest and at the same time continue getting the benefits of interest subvention scheme, Government has decided to continue the availability of 2% IS and 3% PRI to farmers for the extended period of repayment upto 31.05.2020 or date of repayment , whichever is earlier, for short term crop loans upto \u20b93 lakh per farmer which have become due between March 01, 2020 and May 31, 2020.  4. Banks are therefore advised to extend the benefit of IS of 2% and PRI of 3% for short term crop loans upto \u20b9 3 lakh to farmers whose accounts have become due or shall become due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020.  5. All other terms and conditions remained unchanged. \n \nYours faithfully,  (Sonali Sen Gupta) Chief General Manager  \n", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/ISPRI3D88B966C9184A2C83D88DB5DB2CF4B8.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 20, 2020", "info": "", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT20042020_EN97FB72E765504BC4AB499A3E4799A254.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 20, 2020", "info": " RBI/2019-20/223 Ref.No.IDMD/08.02.032/2019-20                                                                         \nApril 20, 2020    \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks  \nAll State Co-operative Banks/All Scheduled Primary  \n(Urban) Co-operative Banks/All Financial Institutions/  \nAll Primary Dealers.    \nDear Sir/Madam,   \nAuction of Government of India Dated Securities  \n  \nGovernment of India has offered to sell (re-issue) four dated securities for a notified amount of ` 21,000 crore as per the following details: \n \nSr \nNo Security Notified  Amount  \n(in ` crore)  GoI \nNotification  Auction \nDate  Settlement \ndate \n1 5.09% GS 2022  3,000  F.No.4(5) W&M/2020 dated April 20, 2020 April 24, 2020 (Friday) April 27, 2020      (Monday) 2 6.45% GS 2029  9,000  \n3 GoI FRB 2031  4,000  \n4 7.19% GS 2060 5,000 \n  Total  21,000       \n \nGoI will have the option to retain additional subscription up to ` 2,000 crore each against any one or more of the above securities.

This impacts the withdrawal of interbank deposits placed by other UCBs with such bank as also timely discharge of interbank exposures such as discounted bills drawn under Letter of Credit (LC) issued by the UCB under AID.  2. In order to ensure that such exposures are objectively recognised in the financial statements of UCBs and also with a view to addressing the systemic impact of provisioning requirements on such exposures, it has been decided as under: a) The interbank exposures arising from deposits placed by UCBs with a UCB under AID and their non-performing exposures arising from discounted bills drawn under LCs issued by a UCB under AID shall be fully provided within five years at the rate of 20% annually.  Further, the interest receivable on the deposits shall not be recognised as income by the UCBs. b) If the UCBs choose to convert such deposits into long term perpetual debt instruments (e.g. Innovative Perpetual Debt Instrument - IPDI) which may be recognised as capital instrument under a scheme of restructuring/ revival of a UCB under AID, provision on the portion of deposits converted into such instruments shall not be required.  3.

In this regard, the detailed instructions with regard to asset classification and provi sioning are as follows: \n(i) Asset Classification under the Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification (IRAC) 2. In terms of the circular DOR.No.BP.BC.47/21.04.048/2019-20 dated March 27, 2020\n \n(\u2018Regulatory Package\u2019), the lending institutions were permitted to grant a moratorium of three months on payment of all term loan instalments falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 (\u2018moratorium period\u2019). As such, in line with the clarification provided by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, in respect of all accounts classified as standard as on February 29, 2020, even if overdue, the moratorium period, wherever granted, shall be excluded by the lending institutions from the number of days past -due for the purpose of asset classification under the IRAC norms.  \n 3. Similarly in respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash credit/overdraft (\u201cCC/OD\u201d), the Regulatory Package permitted the recovery of interest applied during the period from March 1, 2020 upto May 31, 2020 to be deferred (\u2018deferment period\u2019). Such deferment period, wherever granted in respect of all facilities classified as standard , including SMA, as on February 29, 2020, shall be excluded for the determination of out of order status.  4.  NBFCs which are required to comply with Indian Accounting Standards (IndAS) shall , as hitherto, continue to be guided by the guidelines duly approved by their Boards and as per ICAI Advisories for recognition of the impairments. (ii) Provisioning 5.  In respect of accounts in default but standard where provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) above are applicable, and asset classification benefit is extended, lending institutions shall make general provisions of not less than 10 per cent of the total outstanding of such accounts, to be phased over two quarters as under: (i) Quarter ended March 31, 2020 \u2013 not less than 5 per cent  (ii) Quarter ending June 30, 2020 \u2013 not less than 5 per cent  6. The above provisions may be adjusted against the actual provisioning requirements for slippages from the accounts reckoned for such provisions. The residual provisions at the end of the financial year can be written back or adjusted against the provisions required for all other accounts.  7. The above provisions shall not be reckoned for arriving at net NPAs till they are adjusted against the actual provisioning requirements as under paragraph 6 above. Further, till such adjustments, these provisions shall not be netted from gross advances but shown separately in the balance sheet as appropriate.  8. All other provisions required to be maintained by lending institutions , including the provisions for accounts already classified as NPA as on February 29, 2020 as well as subsequent ageing in these accounts, shall continue to be made in the usual manner.     Other Conditions 9. The exclusions permitted in terms of para 2 and 3 above shall be duly reckoned by the lending institutions in their supervisory reporting as well as reporting to credit information companies (CICs); i.e., the days past due and SMA status, where applicable, as on March 1, 2020 will remain unchanged till May 31, 2020.   10. The lending institutions shall suitably disclose the following in the \u2018Notes to Accounts\u2019 while preparing their financial statements for the half year endi ng September 30, 2020 as well as the financial years 2019-20 and 2020-2021: (i) Respective amounts in SMA/overdue categories, where the moratorium/deferment was extended, in terms of paragraph 2 and 3;  (ii) Respective amount where asset classification benefits is extended.

On a review, it has been decided that in respect of accounts which were within the Review Period as on March 1, 2020, the period from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020 shall be excluded from the calculation of the 30-day timeline for the Review Period. In respect of all such accounts, the residual Review Period shall resume from June 1, 2020, upon expiry of which the lenders shall have the usual 180 days for resolution. 4. In respect of accounts where the Review Period was over, but the 180-day resolution period had not expired as on March 1, 2020, the timeline for resolution shall ge t extended by 90 days from the date on which the 180-day period was originally set to expire.   \n  5. Consequently, the requirement of making additional provisions specified in paragraph 17 of the Prudential Framework shall be triggered as and when the extended resolution period, as stated above, expires.  6. In respect of all other accounts, the provisions of the Prudential Framework shall be in force without any modifications. 7. The lending institutions shall make relevant disclosures in respect of accounts where the resolution period was extended in the \u2018Notes to Accounts\u2019 while preparing their financial statements for the half year ending September 30, 2020 as well as the financial years FY2020 and FY2021.  \n Yours faithfully,  (Saurav Sinha) Chief General Manager-in-Charge  ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/219PRUDENTIALFRAMEWORK432FCCE0C77E4280985E3CDA4C2ECB13.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 17, 2020", "info": " \nRBI/2019-20/217  \nDOR.BP.BC.No.65/21.04.098/2019-20 \nApril 17, 2020 \nAll Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks, Local Area Banks and Payments Banks)  Madam/Dear Sir,  Basel III Framework on Liquidity Standards \u2013 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) \n \nPlease refer to our circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.120/21.04.098/2013 -14 dated June 9, 2014  \nand associated circulars thereon.  \n2. As part of post Global Financial Crisis (GFC) reform s, Basel Committee on Banking \nSupervision (BCBS) had introduced Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which requires banks \nto maintain High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) to meet 30 days net outgo under stressed \nconditions. Further, as per Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the banks in India are required to \nhold liquid assets to maintain Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). In view of the fact that liquid \nassets under SLR and HQLAs under LCR are largely the same, we have been allowing \nbanks to use a progressively increasing proportion of the SLR securities for being \nconsidered as HQLAs for LCR so that the need to maintain liquid assets for both the \nrequirements is optimised.  \n3. At present the assets allowed as Level 1 High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs), inter alia, \nincludes among others within the mandatory SLR requirement, Government securities to \nthe extent allowed by RBI under (i) Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) and (ii) Facility to Avail \nLiquidity for Liquidity Coverage Ratio (FALLCR) [15 per cent of the bank's NDTL w ith effect \nfrom April 1, 2020]. Given that SLR has now been reduced to 18 per cent of NDTL from \nApril 11, 2020, and with increase in MSF from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of the banks \u2019 NDTL \n(with effect from March 27, 2020 and applicable upto June 30, 2020) , entire SLR-eligible \nassets held by banks are now permitted to be reckoned as HQLAs for meeting LCR .   \n4. Further, banks1 are required to maintain LCR of 100 per cent with effect from January 1, 2019. In order to accommodate the burden on banks\u2019 cash flows on account of the Covid19 pandemic, banks are permitted to maintain LCR as under: From date of circular to September 30, 2020  -                    80 per cent Oct 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 -                                           90 per cent April 1, 2021 onwards -                                                       100 per cent \n                                                           \n1 SFBs are required to meet LCR of 90 per cent with effect from January 1, 2020 and 100 per cent from January 1, 2021\n Banks shall prepare LCR restoration plans upon breach of the aforesaid prescribed LCR requirement, for scrutiny by the Department of Supervision, Reserve Bank of India.

In this regard, \nthe detailed instructions are as follows: \n(i) Rescheduling of Payments \u2013 Term Loans and Working Capital Facilities \n2. In respect of all term loans (including agricultural term loans, retail and crop loans), \nall commercial banks (including regional rural banks, small finance banks and local \narea banks), co-operative banks, all-India Financial Institutions, and NBFCs (including \nhousing finance companies) (\u201clending institutions\u201d)  are permitted to grant a \nmoratorium of three months on payment of all instalments1 falling due between March \n1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. The repayment schedule for such loans as also the residual \ntenor, will be shifted across the board by three months after the moratorium period. \nInterest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during \nthe moratorium period.  \n                                                 \n1 Instalments will include the following payments falling due from  March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020: (i) principal and/or interest components; (ii) bullet repayments; (iii) Equated Monthly instalments; ( iv) credit card dues.     \n2 \n 3. In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash credit/overdraft  \n(\u201cCC/OD\u201d), lending institutions are permitted to defer the recovery of interest applied \nin respect of all such facilities during the period from March 1, 2020 upto May 31, 2020 \n(\u201cdeferment\u201d). The accumulated accrued interest shall be recovered immediately after \nthe completion of this period. \n(ii) Easing of Working Capital Financing \n4. In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of CC/OD to borrowers \nfacing stress on account of the economic fallout of the pandemic , lending institutions \nmay recalculate the \u2018drawing power\u2019 by reducing the margins and/or by reassessing \nthe working capital cycle. This relief shall be available in respect of all such changes \neffected up to May 31, 2020 and shall be contingent on the lending institutions \nsatisfying themselves that the same is necessitated on account of the economic fallout \nfrom COVID-19. Further, accounts provided relief under these instructions shall be \nsubject to subsequent supervisory review with regard to their justifiability on account \nof the economic fallout from COVID-19. \nClassification as Special Mention Account (SMA) and Non -Performing Asset \n(NPA) \n5. Since the moratorium/deferment/recalculation of the \u2018drawing power\u2019 is being \nprovided specifically to enable the borrowers to tide over economic fallout from \nCOVID-19, the same will not be treated as concession or change in terms and \nconditions of loan agreements due to financial difficulty of the borr ower under \nparagraph 2 of the Annex to the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Framework for \nResolution of Stressed Assets) Directions, 2019 dated June 7, 2019 (\u201c Prudential \nFramework\u201d). Consequently, such a measure, by itself, shall not result in asset \nclassification downgrade. \n6. The asset classification of term loans which are granted relief as per paragraph 2 \nshall be determined on the basis of revised due dates and the revised repayment \nschedule. Similarly, working capital facilities where relief is provided as per paragraph \n3 above, the SMA and the out of order status shall be evaluated considering the  \n    \n3 \n application of accumulated interest immediately after the completion of the deferment \nperiod as well as the revised terms, as permitted in terms of paragraph 4 above.  \n7. The rescheduling of payments, including interest, will not qualify as a default for the \npurposes of supervisory reporting and reporting to Credit Information Companies  \n(CICs) by the lending institutions.  CICs shall ensure that the actions taken by lending \ninstitutions pursuant to the above announcements do not adversely impact the credit \nhistory of the beneficiaries. \nOther Conditions \n8. Lending institutions shall frame Board approved polices for providing the above-\nmentioned reliefs to all eligible borrowers, inter alia, including the objective criteria for \nconsidering reliefs under paragraph 4 above and disclosed in public domain. \n9. Wherever the exposure of a lending institution to a borrower is `5 crore or above as \non March 1, 2020, the bank shall develop an MIS on the reliefs provided to its \nborrowers which shall inter alia include borrower-wise and credit-facility wise \ninformation regarding the nature and amount of relief granted.  \n10. The instructions in this circular come into force with immediate effect. The Board \nof Directors and the key management personnel of the lending institutions shall ensure \nthat the above instructions are properly communicated down the line in their respective \norganisations, and clear instructions are issued to their staff regarding their  \nimplementation. \nYours faithfully, \n \n(Saurav Sinha) Chief General Manager-in-Charge ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI186B27003E9DB3D4FB49BDDF955F4289D68.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Mar 27, 2020", "info": " \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA  \nwww.rbi.org.in  \n \n\ufffd\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940\u092f \u092c\u093e\u095b\u093e\u0930 \ufffd\u0935\ufffd\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \ufffd\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917,\u0915\ufffd\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928, \u0928\u094c\u0935\u0940\u0902 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932, \u0936\u0939\ufffd\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908\u2013400001.\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u092b\u094b\u0928: (91-22) 2260 1000,\u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938: (91-22) 22702290 \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932: cgmfmrd@rbi.org.in \nFinancial Markets Regulation Department, Central Office Building, 9th Floor, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort, Mumbai \u2013  400001.

In terms of para 7.13 of the circular, any Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) instrument (e.g. SBLC/BG from Head Office/other overseas branch) from which CRM benefits like shifting of exposure/ risk weights etc. are not derived, may not be counted as an exposure on the CRM provider.    3. Banks have sought clarity on whether the above-mentioned guidelines will apply to exposures to a person resident outside India also. In this connection, it is clarified that the above clause will also apply to non-fund based credit facilities provided to a person resident outside India ie., the exposure can be reckoned on the person resident outside India instead of treating it as an exposure on Head Office/ other overseas branch, 2  provided the transaction is otherwise compliant with Foreign Exchange Management (Guarantees) Regulations, 2000 (FEMA 8).   4. The exposures thus shifted to a person resident outside India, will attract a minimum risk weight of 150%. 5.

The Government of India has decided that the date of closure of r esidual transactions for the month of March 2020 be fixed as April 10, 2020 for the Financial Year 2019-20. In view of the ensuing closing of government accounts for the financial year 2019-20, receiving branches including those not situated locally, should adopt special arrangements such as courier service etc., for passing on challans/scrolls etc., to the Nodal/Focal Point branches so that all payments and collections made on behalf of government towards the end of March are accounted for in the same financial year. These instructions regarding special messenger arrangements may please be informed to all branches concerned.  3. As regards reporting of March 2020 transactions by Nodal/Focal Point branches in April, the branches may be advised to follow the procedure as outlined in the Annex\n. \nTo sum up, the Nodal/Focal Point branches will be required to prepare separate sets of scrolls, one pertaining to March residual transactions and another for April transactions during the first 10 days of April 2020. The Nodal/Focal Point branches should also ensure that the accounts for all transactions (revenues/tax collections/payments) are effected at the receiving branches up to March 31, 2020 in the accounts for the current financial year itself and are not mixed up with the transactions of April 2020. Also, while reporting transactions pertaining to March  \n2020 up to April 10, 2020, the transactions of April 2020 should not be mixed up with the residual transactions relating to March 2020. 4. Kindly issue necessary instructions in the matter to your branches concerned immediately. \n \nYours faithfully     (Partha Choudhuri) General Manager  Encl: As above  \n \n                        \n ANNEX \n  \n \nReporting of March 2020 Transactions \n 1. Beginning from April 1, 2020, the Nodal/Focal Point branches will segregate on a daily basis all scrolls/challans pertaining to March 2020 received from the receiving branches concerned and prepare separate main scrolls for:  (a) scrolls for transactions of March 2020 or earlier period (i.e. effected during the previous financial year 2019-20) and (b) scrolls pertaining to current transactions (i.e. those effected from April 1, 2020 onwards). \n \n2. The main scrolls for March 2020 transactions prepared from April 1 to April 10, 2020 are to be distinctly marked as March Residual - 1, March Residual - 2 and so on upto April 10, 2020. In other words, serial number should be allotted in consecutive order for each main scroll of March 2020 transactions sent from April 1 to April 10, 2020. These scrolls alongwith the copies of daily summary of Receipts and Payments prepared separately for March 2020 transactions will be forwarded to the Departmental Officials concerned (i.e. Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers and Designated Officers) in the usual way.  The Nodal/Focal Point branches will also be required to report the above transactions to the Link Cell through separate Daily Memos. These advices must be sent to enable the Link Cell of each bank at Nagpur, to make daily settlement with Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section (CAS) Nagpur. On receipt of advices from the Nodal/Focal Point branches, the Link Cell should segregate the advices for the March Residual transactions and forward them separately to Reserve Bank of India, CAS, Nagpur . This procedure should continue upto and inclusive of April 1 0, 2020 only. All transactions reported thereafter by the receiving branches will be reported and accounted for in the usual manner in the accounts of the month of report irrespective of the date of transaction. Following the special arrangements for March 2020 transactions, it is necessary for the Nodal/Focal Point branches to prepare two sets of DMS to be submitted to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers for March 2020 transactions - one for transactions upto March 31, 2020 and another for March Residual Transactions adjusted by Nodal/Focal Point branches with Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur, during April 1 to April 1 0, 2020.   Since the Nodal/Focal Point branch will also be reporting the April 2020 transactions pertaining to year 2020-21 in addition to March 2020 Residual transactions, monthly statement for April transactions should be compiled and furnished to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers in the usual way. In order to distinguish the April 2020 (year 2020-21) and March Residual Transactions, the statement pertaining to March Residual Transactions should be clearly marked as \"March Residual Account\". The statement of March (Residual) Transactions should be sent by all Focal Point Branches to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers latest by April 18, 2020.   Note: As advised in our circular GA.NB.No.376/42.01.001/ 1995-96 dated May 22, 1996 all the cheques/amounts realized on or before March 31, 2020 should be treated as transactions relating to the current financial year as \"March 2020  or March Residual Transactions\", the reporting of which may take place during the month of April (upto April 10, 2020). But if any cheque is tendered on or before March 31, 2020 and realised on or after April 1, 2020, it will be treated as transaction for the next financial year as \"April Transactions\". Accordingly, the banks will prepare separate scrolls for March 2020 and April 2020 (Financial year 2020-21) transactions.

Several confirmed cases have also been detected in India, which highlight the need of a co-ordinated strategy for handling the emerging situations  for protecting the resilience of the Indian financial system.    2. While the Government of India, in co-ordination with the state machineries, is already taking steps for preventing and controlling the local transmission of disease, further steps, including the indicative list presented below, are required to be taken by the respective banks/financial institutions as a part of their existing operational and business continuity plans: (a)  Devising strategy and monitoring mechanism concerning the spread of the disease within the organisation, making timely interventions for preventing further spread in case of detection of infected employees including travel plans and quarantine requirements as well as avoiding spread of panic among staff and  members of the public;    \n  \n(b) Taking stock of critical processes and revisiting  Business Continuity Plan (BCP) in the emerging situations/scenarios with the aim of continuity in critical interfaces and preventing any disruption of services, due to absenteeism either driven by the individual cases of infections or preventive measures;  (c) Taking steps of sharing important instructions/ strategy with the staff members at all levels, for soliciting better response and participation and s ensitizing the staff members about preventive measures/steps to be taken in suspected cases, based on the instructions received from health authorities, from time-to-time;   (d) Encourage their customers to use digital banking facilities as far as possible.   3. Besides taking steps as above for ensuring business process resilience, supervised entities should also assess the impact on their balance sheet, asset quality, liquidity, etc. arising out of potential scenarios such as further spread of COVID-19 in India and its effect on the economy, contagion from wider disruption in the global economy and the global financial system, etc. Based on the above studies, they should take immediate contingency measures to manage the risks under intimation to us. 4. As the situation requires to be monitored closely, both from business and social perspective, a Quick Response Team may be constituted for the purpose, which shall provide regular updates to the top management on significant developments and act as a single point of contact with regulators/outside institutions/agencies. \n \n Yours faithfully,    (Ajay Kumar Choudhary) Chief General Manager ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT1728EEC42EF697147629A2261A4EAF2D3DD.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Mar 13, 2020", "info": "  \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\ufffd\u0915  \n__________________________RESERVE BANK OF INDIA________________________ \nwww.rbi.org.in  \n\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915 \ufffd \ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0938\u0940-7, \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u095b\u0932, \u092c\u093e\u0928\u094d\ufffd\u093e-\u0915\u0941 \u0932 \u093e \u0930\u094d  \u0938 \u0902 \u0915\u0941\u0932, \u092c\u093e\u0928\u094d\ufffd\u093e ( \u092a\u0942\u0935\u0930\u094d), \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400051 , \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924  \u092b\u094b\u0928: \n(022) 26571112 ; \u0908 \u092e\u0947\u0932: cgmdcbrco@rbi.org.in  \n Department of Regulation, Central Office,  C-7, 1st Floor, Bandra-Kurla Complex, Mumbai - 400051, India \nPhone: (022) 26571112; E-mail: cgmdcbrco@rbi.org.in  \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \u093f\u0939\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 \u092e\ufffd \u092a\ufffd\u093e\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0917\u0924 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u2014 \n\u091a\u0947\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0928\u0940 : \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \ufffd\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932, \u0921\u093e\u0915, \u090f\u0938\u090f\u092e\u090f\u0938 \u092f\u093e \u092b\u094b\u0928 \u0915\u0949\u0932 \u0915 \u0947  \u091c\ufffd\u0930\u092f\u0947 \u0915\u094b\u0908  \u092d\u0940 \ufffd\u093f\ufffd\u0917\u0924 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u091c\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \u0916\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u092c\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0930\u093e , \u092a\u093e\u0938\u0935\u0921\u0930\u094d \u0906\ufffd\u0926 \u0928\u0939\ufffd \u092e\u093e\u0901\u0917\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u092f\u0939 \u0927\u0928 \u0930\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u092f\u093e \n\u0926\u0947\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \ufffd\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935 \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u0939\ufffd \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0910\u0938\u0947 \ufffd\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935\ufffd \u0915\u093e \ufffd\u0915\u0938\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \ufffd\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u091c\u0935\u093e\u092c \u092e\u0924 \u0926\u0940\u093f\u091c\u090f\u0964  Caution: RBI never sends mails, SMSs or makes calls asking for personal in formation like bank account details, passwords, etc. \nIt never keeps or offers funds to anyone.

Cir.No.44/13.05.00/2004-05 dated April 15, 2005\n, Primary \n(Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) were permitted to have exposures up to 15 per cent and 40 per cent of their capital funds to a single borrower and a group of borrowers, respectively. On a review, it has been decided that, henceforth, the prudential exposure limits for UCBs for a single borrower/party and a group of connected borrowers/parties shall be 15 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, of their tier-I capital.  \n2.1.1 The revised exposure limits shall apply to all types of fresh exposures taken by UCBs. UCBs shall bring down their existing exposures which are in excess of the revised limits to within the aforesaid revised limits by March 31, 2023. However, where the \nexisting exposure comprises only term loans and non-fund-based facilities, while no further exposure shall be taken on such borrowers, these facilities may be allowed to continue as per their respective repayment schedule / till maturity. \n2.1.2 Tier-I capital as on March 31 of the preceding financial year shall be reckoned for the purpose of fixing the exposure limits. Tier-I capital for the purpose will be the same as that prescribed for computation of capital adequacy of UCBs (vide \nMaster Circular \ndated July 1, 2015 on Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy ), as amended from time to \ntime.  2.1.3 Whether borrowers/parties belong to a \u2018group of connected borrowers/parties\u2019 shall be determined based on the instructions contained at para 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the \nMaster \nCircular DCBR.CO.BPD. (PCB) MC No.13/13.05.000/2015-16 dated July 1, 2015 , as \namended from time to time. \n2.1.4 All other extant instructions on the subject, including the definition of exposure, will remain unchanged. \n2.2 UCBs shall have at least 50 per cent of their aggregate loans and advances comprising loans of not more than \u20b925 lakh or 0.2% of their tier I capital, whichever is higher, subject to a maximum of Rs.1 crore, per borrower/party. Tier I capital for this purpose shall be reckoned in the manner provided in paragraph 2.1.2 above. Notwithstanding the above, UCBs shall adhere to the revised exposure limits stipulated at para 2.1 above. UCBs which do not, at present, comply with the prescribed threshold shall be in conformity with the above requirements  by March 31, 2024.  \n2.2.1 It is clarified that \u2018loans\u2019 for the purpose shall include all types of funded and non-funded exposures in the nature of credit.  3. Revised Priority Sector Lending Target 3.1 In terms of the \ncircular DCBR.BPD (PCB).Cir.No.07/09.09.002/2017-18 dated May 10, \n2018 , the overall priority sector lending (PSL) target for UCBs stood at 40% of the adjusted \nnet bank credit (ANBC) or credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposure (CEOBSE), whichever is higher. On a review, it has been decided that the overall PSL target for UCBs shall stand increased to 75 per cent of ANBC or CEOBSE, whichever is higher.  \n3.1.1 UCBs shall comply with the above target by March 31, 2024 as per the following \nmilestones: \nPSL targe ts to be achieved by  \nMarch 31, \n2021 March 31, \n2022 March 31, \n2023 March 31, \n2024 \n45% of \nANBC or \nCEOBSE, \nwhichever is \nhigher 50% of \nANBC or \nCEOBSE, \nwhichever is \nhigher 60% of \nANBC or \nCEOBSE, whichever is higher 75% of \nANBC or \nCEOBSE, whichever is higher \n 3.1.2 The extant sub-targets under the priority sector shall remain unchanged. 4. UCBs shall prepare, with the approval of their Board, an Action Plan for compliance with the aforesaid revised exposure limits and priority sector lending targets. They are also advised to establish an appropriate mechanism to regularly monitor the progress made under the Action Plan for compliance with the above instructions.  5. A copy of this circular should be placed before the Board of Directors of the UCB in its next meeting and a confirmation thereof should be sent to the concerned Regional Office of Department of Supervision, Reserve Bank of India.  Yours faithfully,    (Neeraj Nigam) Chief General Manager Enclosure : As above    Extract of the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated December 5, 2019 1. Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks \u2013 Exposure Limits and Priority Sector Lending With a view to reducing concentration risk in the exposures of primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) and to further strengthen the role of UCBs in promoting financial inclusion, it is proposed to amend certain regulatory guidelines relating to UCBs. The guidelines would primarily relate to exposure norms for single and group/interconnected borrowers, promotion of financial inclusion, priority sector lending, etc. These measures are expected to strengthen the resilience and sustainability of UCBs and protect the interest of depositors. An appropriate timeframe will be provided for compliance with the revised norm s. A draft circular proposing the above changes for eliciting stakeholder comments will be issued shortly.

In \norder to promote a high quality and consistent implementation as well as facilitate \ncomparison and better supervision, the Reserve Bank has framed regulatory guidance \non Ind AS given in the Annex  which will be applicable on Ind AS implementing NBFCs \nand Asset Reconstruction Companies ( ARCs) for preparation of their financial \nstatements from financial year 2019-20 onwards. \n2.  The annexed instructions and guidelines relate to specific prudential aspects of Ind \nAS implementation by NBFCs/ARCs and are not meant to  provide a comprehensive \ncommentary on the accounting standards or comprehensive technical interpretation \nof the standards, nor intended to cover all possible situations. Accordingly, with \nrespect to matters not dealt with in the Annex, NBFCs/ARCs  are required to refer to \nthe notified accounting standards, application guidance, educational material and \nother clarifications issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ( ICAI). \nYours faithfully, -sd- (Manoranjan Mishra) Chief General Manager  \n \nAnnex Implementation of Indian Accounting Standards by Non-Banking Financial Companies and Asset Reconstruction Companies\n1  The responsibility of preparing and ensuring fair presentation of the financial statements of a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) / Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) vests primarily with its Board of Directors. The Reserve Bank, expects a high quality implementation of Ind AS which will require detailed analysis, application of judgment and detailed documentation to support judgments. These guidelines focus on the need to ensure consistency in the application of the accounting standards in specific areas, including asset classification and provisioning, and provide clarifications on regulatory capital in the light of Ind AS implementation.   1. Governance Framework (a) In view of the criticality of the nature of the business model in determining the classification of financial assets and restrictions on subsequent reclassification, NBFCs/ARCs are advised to put in place Board approved policies that clearly articulate and document their business models and portfolios.  NBFCs/ARCs shall also articulate the objectives for managing each portfolio. (b) NBFCs/ARCs shall frame their policy for sales out of amortised cost business model portfolios and disclose the same in their notes to financial statements.  (c) The Reserve Bank expects the Board of Directors to approve sound methodologies\n2 for computation of Expected Credit Losses(ECL) that address policies, procedures and controls for assessing and measuring credit risk on all lending exposures, commensurate with the size, complexity and risk profile specific to the NBFC/ARC. The parameters and assumptions considered as well as their sensitivity to the ECL output should be documented.   NBFCs/ARCs are advised to not make changes in the parameters, assumptions and other aspects of their ECL model for the purposes of profit smoothening. The rationale and \n                                            \n1 NBFCs/ARCs that are required to implement Ind AS in terms of  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time  \n2 NBFCs/ARCs may draw reference to Guidance on Credit Risk and Accounting for Expected Credit Losses issued by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in December 2015 , which is structured around 11 principles out of which first eight principles deal with supervisory guidance and inter- alia cover Board/Senior Management\u2019s responsibilities, adoption of sound methodologies for credit risk measurement, disclosure requirements etc.  \n -2- \njustification for any change in the ECL model should be documented and approved by the Board.  Similarly, any adjustments to the model output (i.e. a management overlay) should be approved by the Audit Committee of the Board (ACB) and its rationale and basis should be clearly documented.  (d) Ind AS 109 does not explicitly define default\n3, but requires entities to define default in a manner consistent with that used for internal credit risk management. It is recommended that the definition of default adopted for accounting purposes is guided by the definition used for regulatory purposes. The ACB should approve the classification of accounts that are past due beyond 90 days but not treated as impaired, with the rationale for the same clearly documented. Further, the number of such accounts and the total amount outstanding and the overdue amounts should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.  (e) Regardless of the way in which NBFC/ARC assesses significant increase in credit risk, there is a rebuttable presumption under Ind AS 109 that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Ind AS 109 also permits that an NBFC/ARC can rebut this presumption if it has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates that the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition even though the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. NBFCs/ARCs should educate their customers on the need to make payments in a timely manner. However, in limited circumstances, where NBFCs/ARCs do rebut the presumption, it should be done only with clear documentation of the justification for doing so. All such cases shall be placed before the ACB. NBFCs/ARCs shall not defer the recognition of significant increase in credit risk for any exposure that is overdue beyond 60 days. \n                                            \n3 Para B5.5.37 of Ind AS 109 states that \u201c\u2026an entity shall apply a default definition that is consistent with the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes for the relevant financial instrument and consider qualitative indicators (for example, financial covenants) when appropriate. However, there is a rebuttable presumption that default does not occur later than when a financial asset is 90 days past due unless an entity has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate t hat a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate. The definition of default used for these purposes shall be applied consistently to all financial instruments unless information becomes available that demonstrates that another default definition is  more appropriate for a particular financial instrument.\u201d\n     \n -3- \n2. Prudential Floor for ECL (a) NBFCs/ ARCs shall hold impairment allowances as required by Ind AS.  In parallel NBFCs/ARCs shall also maintain the asset classification and compute provisions as per extant prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) including borrower/beneficiary wise classification, provisioning for standard as well as restructured assets, NPA ageing, etc.  A comparison (as per the template in Appendix\n) between provisions \nrequired under IRACP and impairment allowances made under Ind AS 109 should be disclosed by NBFCs/ARCs in the notes to their financial statements to provide a benchmark to their Boards, RBI supervisors and other stakeholders , on the adequacy of provisioning for credit losses. \n(b) Where impairment allowance under Ind AS 109 is lower than the provisioning required under IRACP (including standard asset provisioning), NBFCs/ARCs shall appropriate the difference from their net profit or loss after tax to a separate \u2018Impairment Reserve\u2019.  The balance in the \u2018Impairment Reserve\u2019 shall not be reckoned for regulatory capital.  Further, no withdrawals shall be permitted from this reserve without prior permission from the Department of Super vision, RBI. (c) The requirement for \u2018Impairment Reserve\u2019 shall be reviewed, going forward.  3. Computation of Regulatory Capital and Regulatory Ratios (a) In determining \u2018owned funds\u2019 , \u2018net owned funds\u2019 and \u2018regulatory capital\u2019, NBFCs and ARCs shall be guided by  the following: i) Any net unrealised gains arising on fair valuation of financial instruments, including such gains arising on transition to Ind AS, should not be included in owned funds whereas all such net losses should be considered. In determining the net unrealised gains for reduction from owned funds, NBFCs should categorise financial assets measured at fair value into two categories viz.  A. Investments in shares of other NBFCs  and in shares, debentures, bonds, etc. in Group companies that are required to be reduced while determining Tier I Capital as defined in paragraph 2(xxxii) of the  Non-Banking Financial Company-Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking  \n -4- \nCompany and Deposit taking Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016; and B. Others  While netting may be done within the aforementioned categories, net gains from one category should not be offset against losses in the other category.   ii) Any unrealised gains or losses recognised in equity due to (a) own credit risk and (b) cash flow hedge reserve shall be derecognised while determining owned funds. iii) Since unrealised gains on category A have been excluded in computation of owned fund, NBFCs shall reduce the lower of acquisition cost or fair value of investments/advances in subsidiaries/other group companies and other NBFCs while determining Tier I capital as specified in paragraph 2(xxxii) of the aforementioned Master Directions.  Net unrealised gains on Category B (i.e. \u2018Others\u2019) to the extent they have been excluded in regulatory capital , shall also be reduced from risk weighted assets. iv) ARCs shall apply the guidelines specified in sub-paragraph (i) to (iii) above mutatis mutandis while determining net owned funds. v) Where NBFCs/ARCs use fair value as deemed cost at the date of transition with respect to Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) in terms of Ind AS 101, and the difference between the deemed cost and the current carrying cost is adjusted directly in retained earnings, any fair value gains upon such transition shall be reckoned as Tier II capital for NBFCs/ net owned funds for ARCs at a discount of 55 percent. vi) 12 month expected credit loss (ECL) allowances for financial instruments i.e. where the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition, shall be included under general provisions and loss reserves in Tier II capital within the limits specified by extant regulations. Lifetime ECL shall not be reckoned for regulatory capital (numerator) while it shall be reduced from the risk weighted assets. vii) Securitised assets not qualifying for de-recognition under Ind AS due to credit enhancement given by the originating NBFC on such assets shall be risk  \n -5- \nweighted at zero percent.  However, the NBFC shall reduce 50 per cent of the amount of credit enhancement given from Tier I capital and the balance from Tier II capital.  (b) Regulatory ratios, limits and disclosures shall be based on Ind AS figures.  Impaired assets and restructured assets shall be considered as non- performing assets (NPA) for calculation of NPA ratios.    \n -6- \nAppendix Template for Disclosure in Notes to Financial Statements \nAsset Classification as per \nRBI Norms Asset \nclassifica\ntion as \nper Ind \nAS 109 Gross \nCarrying \nAmount as \nper Ind AS Loss \nAllowances \n(Provisions)  \nas required \nunder Ind AS \n109 Net Carrying \nAmount Provisions \nrequired as \nper IRACP \nnorms Difference \nbetween Ind \nAS 109 \nprovisions \nand IRACP \nnorms  \n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)=(3) -(4) (6) (7) = (4) -(6) \nPerforming Assets        \nStandard Stage 1            \nStage 2            \nSubtotal              \n              \nNon-Performing Assets (NPA)        \nSubstandard  Stage 3            \n              \nDoubtful -  up to 1 year  Stage 3            \n1 to 3 years  Stage 3            \nMore than 3 year s Stage 3            \nSubtotal  for doubtful              \n              \nLoss  Stage 3            \nSubtotal for NPA               \n              \nOther items such as guarantees, loan commitments, etc. which are in the scope of Ind AS 109 but not \ncovered under current Income \nRecognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) norms Stage 1            \nStage 2            \nStage 3           \nSubtotal              \n              \nTotal Stage 1            \nStage 2            \nStage 3            \nTotal            \n  ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI170F341D8DE49C04D4B8382D855A9858583.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Mar 06, 2020", "info": " \n\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\ufffd \ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u0915\ufffd \ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928, 12\u0935\ufffd/ 13\u0935\ufffd \u092e\u0902\u093f\u095b\u0932, \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400001 \u091f\u0947\u0932\u0940\u092b\u094b\u0928/ Tel No: 22661602, 22601000 \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938/ Fax No: 022-2270 5691 Department of Regulation, Central Office, Central Office Building, 12\nth/ 13th Floor, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  Mumbai - 400001  \n  \n\"Caution: RBI never sends mails, SMSs or makes calls asking for personal information like bank account details, passwords, etc. It never ke eps or offers funds to anyone.

(DIR Series) Circular ibid:  i. For a trade to be classified as merchanting trade, goods acquired shall not enter  the Domestic Tariff Area.  ii.

The MTT shall be undertaken for the goods that are permitted for exports / imports under the prevailing Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) of India as on the date of shipment. All rules, regulations and directions applicable to exports (except Export Declaration Form) and imports (except Bill of Entry) shall be complied with for the export leg and import leg respectively.  iv.

The payment system landscape has witnessed rapid developments since then with increased adoption of technology, availability of payment products, entry of more non- bank players, dis-intermediation, significant surge in turnover, etc.  To ensure that the payment systems are safe and secure and the various stakeholders conform to regulatory requirements, on review it has been decided to revise the process of levy of penalty on payment system operators by the Reserve Bank of India.   3. A table showing the changes made to the existing framework is in Annex 1\n; salient \nfeatures of the revised framework are in Annex 2 . The revised framework continues to \ncentre around objectivity and transparency in the decision-making process.

Powers of RBI to \nimpose fine and \ncompound Powers of RBI to impose fine and \ncompound contraventions have been mentioned; the type of contravention / violation for which RBI has powers to impose fine and compound, are not explicitly indicated. RBI has powers to impose monetary penalty  in respect of certain contraventions as well as \ncompound certain contraventions. The type / nature of contravention for which penalty can be imposed and compounded are different and vary. This has been detailed including the procedure to be followed. \n2. Procedure for \nimposing monetary penalty / fine Single procedure for imposing \nmonetary penalty / fine in respect of \ncontraventions identified by RBI as \nwell as compounding of \ncontraventions. Considering that the powers of RBI to impose monetary penalty  and compound \ncontraventions are different, and further that the nature of identification of contraventions is also different, separate procedures have been proposed.  \n3. Delegation of \npowers to \nimpose fine and \ncompound contraventions There is no mention of delegation of \npowers or about the designated \nauthority. The powers to impose monetary penalty on account of RBI identified contraventions and \ncompounding of contraventions have been separated. \n4.

Type of \ncontraventions \nthat can be \ncompounded All contraventions could be \ncompounded. All offences mentioned in Section 26 of PSS Act, 2007 except those relating to sub -section \n2 of Section 26, can be compounded.  \n All eligible contraventions, irrespective of its nature of being quantifiable or non - quantifiable, shall be compounded. Annex 2 \n         (DPSS.CO.OD.No.1328/06.08.005/2019-20 dated January 10, 2020) \n  Framework for imposing monetary penalty on authorised payment system operators / banks under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007  1. Offences and Penalties 1.1 Section 26 of the Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS) Act, 2007 defines the following activities as offences, which are punishable with imprisonment or fine or both: (i) operation of a payment system without authorisation by RBI;  (ii) failure to comply with the terms and conditions subject to which authorisation was issued; (iii) wilful submission of a false statement of information or wilful omission to submit a material statement in any application for authorisation or return or other document; (iv) failure to produce any statement, information, returns or documents; (v) disclosure of any prohibited information; (vi) non-compliance of RBI directions or failure to pay the penalty imposed by RBI; and  (vii) contravention of any provisions of the Act or of any regulation, order or direction made or given thereunder, in respect of which no penalty has been specified.   2. Powers of RBI to impose fine 2.1 In terms of Section 30 of the PSS Act, RBI is empowered to impose a penalty not exceeding \u20b9 5 lakh or twice the amount involved in such contravention or default where such amount is quantifiable, whichever is more, in case of contraventions / defaults of the nature mentioned in Section 26 (2) and 26 (6) of the Act. Further, if such contravention or default is a continuing one, a further penalty up to \u20b9 25,000/- for every day after the first during which the contravention or default continues, can be imposed.   3. Powers of RBI to compound offences 3.1 Section 31 of PSS Act empowers RBI to compound contraventions of any of the punishable offences under the Act, not being an offence punishable with imprisonment / imprisonment and fine.  4. With the continuous evolution and increased pace of development of payment landscape in the country, including the entry of non-bank players leveraging the technological developments, and the consequent requirement to ensure safe, secure and efficient payment systems, a need was felt to review the entire process of levy of penalty so as to ensure the efficacy of implementation of various RBI directions and regulations.  5. Accordingly, the entire process has been reviewed and a revised framework, as briefed below, is being put in place with immediate effect.  6. Principles for imposing monetary penalty / compounding a contravention 6.1 Following factors will be considered for determining the materiality of a contravention, whether on account of those identified by RBI or a compounding application from the contravener: (i) Severity of contravention in terms of degree of breach of norms/limits (isolated, localised, extensive, widespread); (ii) Period and frequency of a similar contravention during the past 5 years ; (iii) Seriousness of the contravention; Percentage of amount involved in the contravention vis-\u00e0-vis total value of transactions handled by the contravener during the period under consideration; (iv) Amount involved in the contravention; and (v) Submission of wrong / false / incomplete compliance.  6.2 Following factors will be considered for determining the amount of monetary   penalty to be imposed on any entity, resulting from 6.1 above: (i) Amount of gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, accruing to the contravener as a result of the contravention; (ii) Amount of loss caused to any other authority / agency / exchequer and / or to any other market participant; (iii) Monetary benefits accruing to the contravener from delayed / non-compliance;  7. Imposition of monetary penalty for RBI identified contraventions   (i) An indicative list of the contraventions / violations is as under: a. Wilful submission of a false statement of information or wilful omission of a material statement to RBI; b. Delay / non / incomplete / incorrect submission of various statutory / regulatory returns / statements / documents, etc.; c. Contravention of any provisions of the Act or of any regulation, directions  / instructions made thereunder; d. Issues in maintenance of net worth requirements, etc. e. Non-compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) norms; f. Issues in maintenance of nodal / escrow accounts; g. Breach of limits in loading, fund transfer, etc. of PPIs; h. Inadequacies in storage of payment system data in India; and i. Any other contravention of directions / instructions \u2013 specific or general.  \n(ii) Designated authority to impose penalty \n\u2022 In case of quantifiable contraventions, a Committee of Senior Officers, comprising of the Chief General Manager / Officer-in-Charge, Department of Payment and Settlement Systems (DPSS), Central Office and senior officers from two other Departments of RBI, shall be the designated authority.  \u2022 In case of non-quantifiable contraventions, a Committee, comprising of ED in- Charge of DPSS and Chief General Managers from two other Departments of RBI (Committee of CGMs), shall be the designated authority.  \u2022 For contraventions, partly quantifiable and partly non-quantifiable, the Committee  of CGMs shall be the designated authority.   \n(iii) Procedure for imposing penalty \n(a) Call for information: On receipt of information on a contravention, RBI may call for \nadditional information from the contravener. \n(b) Issue of Explanation Letter: On identification of a contravention, a letter calling for \nexplanation would be issued to the contravener.  \n(c) Issue of Show Cause Notice (SCN):  \n\u2022 If the RBI is not satisfied with the reasons / explanations furnished by the contravener, an SCN may be issued based on the parameters mentioned in para 6.1 above, advising the contravener to show cause as to why the amount specified in the notice should not be imposed as penalty. For the purpose, a matrix has been formulated to derive a weighted score based on certain parameters.  \u2022 In cases where a contravener has already been issued with more than one Cautionary / Warning / Displeasure letters for a particular type of contravention by RBI on earlier occasions of contraventions during the last 5 years, an SCN shall be issued on the subsequent occasion/s irrespective of the overall weighted score arrived at. \n(d) Personal Hearing: The contravener shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity \nof being heard, if requested by the contravener in reply to the SCN.  \n(e) Issue of Speaking Order: The Designated Authority shall pass a Speaking Order \nbased on the information and supportive documents presented by the contravener and also the submissions made in this connection by them during the personal hearing.  (iv) Amount of monetary penalty: \na. The amount of monetary penalty may vary depending on impact on account of various factors.  b. The amount of monetary penalty for a contravention shall not exceed \u20b9 5 lakh or double the amount of contravention, whichever is higher , where such amount is quantifiable. For non-quantifiable contravention, the maximum penalty shall be \u20b9 5 lakh per contravention. \nc. A Matrix has been formulated for determining the amount of penalty. The actual \namount may vary depending on the circumstances of the cases.  \nd. The amount of penalty, after considering the mitigating factors, may differ depending upon the extent of overall weighted score, as given in Appendix 1\n. In case where the \namount of resultant penalty may affect the viability of the contravener  or otherwise disproportionate or unfair, or even where neither the extent of impact nor the intent of committing the contravention is clearly established, the designated authority may exercise its discretionary power and take a fair view to either reduce or impose an appropriate amount of penalty, subject to statutory limits.  \n \n(v) Payment of monetary penalty:  \na. The monetary penalty shall be payable within a period of thirty days from the date of the order.  b. In case of failure in payment of penalty amount, RBI will initiate appropriate action against the contravener as per Section 8 or Section 30 (3) or Section 33 of PSS Act.   \n(vi) Disclosure: \na. The entities shall disclose the details of monetary penalty paid in their Notes to Accounts that are part of Annual Financial Statements for the financial year in which the penalty is levied. b. RBI shall disclose the penalty levied on its website.  8. Compounding of contraventions (i) An indicative list of the contraventions / violations for compounding, is as under: a. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of authorisation issued by RBI;  b. Failure to produce / furnish any statement, information, returns or other documents to RBI or answer any question relating to the operation of payment system;  c. Disclosure of any information prohibited under Section 22 of PSS Act;  d. Non-compliance / contravention of any provisions of the Act / Regulation / order / directions made or given in respect of which no penalty has been specified in the Act;  e. Violations of KYC / AML norms; f. Delay / non / incomplete / incorrect submission of various statutory / regulatory returns / statements / documents, etc. (other than an act punishable under sub-section 2 of Section 26) g. Issues in maintenance of nodal/escrow accounts; h. Breach of limits in loading, fund transfer, etc. of PPIs; i. Inadequacies in storage of payment system data in India; and j.

Cir No. 3/12.05.001/2014-15 dated November \n27, 2014  on the captioned subject containing the Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) for \nUCBs. Keeping in view the experience gained, it has been decided to further rationalize the SAF to make it more effective in bringing about the desired improv ement in the UCBs as also expeditious resolution of UCBs experiencing financial stress. Reserve Bank will continue to monitor asset quality, profitability and capital / net worth of UCBs under the revised SAF. The main features of the revised SAF are indicated herein below: \n2. Thresholds/triggers and Supervisory Action The revised SAF envisages initiation of corrective action by the UCB and/or supervisory action by the Reserve Bank on breach of the specified thresholds (triggers) in respect of the specified financial parameters/indicators. The actions mentioned in the following paragraphs may be taken on breach of the specified thresholds. 2.1 Asset quality: A UCB may be placed under SAF when its Net NPA s exceed 6% of its net advances. Depending on the severity of stress, Reserve Bank may take one or more of the following actions: a) Advising the UCB to submit a Board-approved Action Plan for reducing its Net NPAs below 6% b) Advising the Board of Directors of the UCB to review the progress under the Action Plan on quarterly/monthly basis c) Advising the UCB to submit the post-review progress report to Reserve Bank d) Restriction on declaration/payment of dividend/donation without prior approval of RBI e) Curtailment of sanction/renewal of credit facilities to sectors/segments having high proportion of NPAs/defaults  f) Reduction in exposure limits for fresh loans and advances  g) Restriction on fresh loans and advances carrying risk-weights more than 100% 2.2 Profitability: A UCB may be placed under SAF when it incurs losses for two consecutive financial years or has accumulated losses on its balance sheet . Depending on the severity of stress, Reserve Bank may take one or more of the following actions: a) Advising the UCB to submit a Board-approved Action Plan for restoring the profitability and/or wiping out the accumulated losses  b) Advising the Board of Directors of the UCB to review of progress under the Action Plan on quarterly (or more frequent) basis.  c) Prohibition on declaration/payment of dividend/donation d) Restriction on incurring capital expenditure beyond a specified limit, without prior approval of the Reserve Bank  e) Measures for reduction in interest and operating/administrative expenses 2.3 Capital to Risk-weighted Assets ratio (CRAR): A UCB may be placed under SAF when its CRAR falls below 9%. Depending on the severity of stress, Reserve Bank may take one or more of the following actions: a) Advising the UCB to submit a Board-approved Action Plan for increasing the CRAR to 9% or above within 12 months  b) Advising the Board of Directors of the UCB to review the progress under the Action Plan on quarterly/monthly basis and submit the post-review progress report to Reserve Bank c) Seeking a Board-approved proposal for merging the UCB with another bank or converting itself into a credit society d) Prohibition on declaration/payment of dividend/donation e) Restriction on incurring capital expenditure beyond a specified limit, without prior approval of the Reserve Bank  f) Measures for reduction in interest and operating/administrative expenses g) Reduction in exposure limits for fresh loans and advances  h) Restriction on fresh loans and advances carrying risk -weights beyond the specified limit i) Restriction on expansion of size of the balance sheet j) Restriction on fresh borrowings, except for meeting temporary liquidity mismatches k) Prohibition on sanction/disbursal of fresh loans and advances other than loan s against collateral security of term deposits / NSCs / KVPs / insurance policies  l) Prohibition on expansion of size of the deposits   2.4 Actions such as imposition of all-inclusive directions under section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (as applicable to co-operative societies) and issue of show cause notice for cancellation of banking license may be considered by the Reserve bank when continued normal functioning of the UCB is no longer considered to be in the interest of its depositors  / public. 3. Implementation of the revised SAF 3.1 Supervisory action will normally be initiated on the basis of the financial position of UCBs  as assessed during the statutory inspection. However, action may also be taken on the basis of the reported/audited financial position which may be subsequently reviewed, if necessary, on the basis of the statutory inspection findings. 3.2 Although supervisory action taken will primarily be based on the criteria specified under the revised SAF, Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking appropriate supervisory action in case stress is noticed in other important indicators/parameters or i n case of serious governance issues. Reserve Bank will also not be precluded from taking any supervisory actions other than those indicated in this circular, based on merits of each case.  3.3 The revised SAF will be implemented with immediate effect. Super visory action already taken under the earlier SAF will be reviewed and revised instructions, if any, will be issued to the UCBs concerned. 4. A copy of this circular should be placed before the Board of Directors of your bank in its next meeting and a confirmation thereof should be sent to the concerned Regional Office of Department of Supervision of Reserve Bank of India.
