The Reserve Bank of India had constituted the Expert Committee on Urban Co-\noperative Banks  to examine the issues in urban cooperative banking sector  and to review \nregulatory/ supervisory approach for strengthening the sector. Based on the \nrecommendations of the Expert Committee, RBI had released the Revised Regulatory \nFramework for Urban Co- operative Banks (UCBs) on July 19, 2022.  \n3. Accordingly , it has been decided to adopt a four -tiered regulatory framework, as against \nthe existing two- tiered framework, for categorization of UCBs. Going forward, this \ncategorization may be used for differentiated regulatory prescriptions aimed at \nstrengthening the financial soundness of the UCBs.  \n4. The categorization of UCBs, based on their  deposit size, is enclosed in Annex . \nCommencement  \n5. The instructions shall be applicable with immediate effect.  \nApplicability  \n6.

In this regard, it is advised that Government of India has approved the continuation of \nthe Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS)  with modification for the financial years 2022- 23 \nand 2023- 24 with the following stipulations:   \n \n(i) In order to provi de short  term crop loans and short term loans for allied activities \nincluding animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc.  upto an overall limit \nof \u20b93 lakh to farmers through KCC  at concessional interest rate during the year s \n2022-23 and 2023- 24, it has been decided to provide interest subvention  to \n \n lending institutions viz. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and  Private Sector Banks (in \nrespect of loans given by their rural and semi -urban branches only) , Small \nFinance Banks  (SFBs)  and computerized Primary Agriculture  Cooperative \nSocieties (PACS) which have been ceded with Scheduled Commercial Bank s \n(SCBs) , on use of their own resources . This i nterest subvention will be calculated \non the loan amount from the date of disbursement /drawal up to the date of actual \nrepayment of the loan by the farmer or up to the due date of the loan fixed by the \nbanks , whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year.  The \napplicable lending rate to farmers and the rate of interest subvention for the \nfinancial year s 2022- 23 and 2023 -24 will be as follows:  \nFinancial Year Lending rate to farmers  Rate of Intere st \nSubvention to Lending \nInstitutions  \n2022 -23 7% 1.50% \n2023 -24 7% 1.50% \n \n(ii) An additional interest subvention of  3% per annum  will be provided to such of \nthose farmers repaying in time,  i.e., from the date of disbursement of the  loan/ s \nupto the actual date of repayment or upto the due date fixed by the bank s for \nrepayment of such l oan/s, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of \none year from the date of disbursement. This also implies that the farmers repaying promptly  as above would get short term  crop loans  and/or short term \nloans for allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. @ 4% per annum during the financial  years 2022-23 and 2023- 24. This \nbenefit would not accrue to those farmers who repay their agri loans after one year of availing such loans.  \n \n(iii) Interest subvention and p rompt repayment incentive benefits on short term crop \nloans and short term loans for allied activities will be available on an overall limit of \u20b93 lakh per annum subject to a maximum sub- limit of \u20b92 lakh per farmer in \nrespect of those farmers involved only in activities related to animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. The limit for crop loan component will take \npriority for interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits and the  \n residual amount will be considered towards allied activities including animal  \nhusbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. subject to the cap as mentioned \nabove. (Illustrations ) \n \n(iv) In order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store \ntheir produce in warehouses, the benefit of i nterest subvention under KCC will be \navailable to small and marginal farmers for a further period of upto six months \npost the harvest of the crop against negotiable warehouse receipts on the produce stored in warehouse s accredited with Wa rehousing Development Regulatory \nAuthority (WDRA), at the same rate as applicable to the crop loan.  \n \n(v) To provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, the applicable rate of interest subvention for that year will be made available to banks for the first year on the restructured loan amount. Such restructured loans will attract normal rate of interest from the second year onwards.  \n \n(vi) However,  to provide relief  to farmers affected due to severe natural calamities, \nthe applicable rate of interest subvention for that year will be made available to \nbanks for first three years/entire period (subject to a maximum of five years) on \nthe restructured loan amount. Further, in all such cases, the benefit of prompt \nrepayment incentive @3% per annum shall also be provided to the affected \nfarmers. The grant of such benefit in cases of severe natural calamities s hall, \nhowever, be decided by a High Level (HLC) based on the recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) and Sub Committee of National \nExecutive Committee (SC -NEC).  \n \n(vii) To ensure hassle- free benefits to farmers under the ISS, Aadhar linkage w ould \ncontinue to be mandatory for availing the above mentioned short term loans in \n2022- 23 and 2023- 24. \n \n(viii) All the above mentioned short term loans processed in 2022- 23 and 2023- 24 are \nrequired to be brought on the ISS portal/DBT platform.

Reserve Bank of India (Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022  \n3 \n CHAPTER II \u2013  GENERAL GUIDELINES  \n4. Computation of UFCE  \n(a) Banks shall ascertain the Foreign Currency Exposure (FCE)  of all entities2 at least \non an annual basis . Banks shall compute the FCE  following the relevant accounting \nstandard applicable for the entity . \nExplanation: Banks shall consider the i tems maturing or having cash flows over \nthe period of next five years .  \nNote: For arriving at the foreign currency exposure of entities, their exposure \nfrom all sources including foreign currency borrowings and External Commercial \nBorrowings shall be taken into account.  \n(b) Banks shall assess the Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure (UFCE)  of entities  \nwith FCE by obtaining information on UFCE from the concerned entity .  \nProvided that  the information on UFCE shall be obtained from entities on a \nquarterly basis based on statutory audit, internal audit  or self -declaration by the \nconcerned entity.  \nProvided further that UFCE information sh all be audited and certified by the \nstatutory auditors of the entity , at least on an annual basis . \n5. Provisioning and Capital Requirements  \n(a) Banks shall determine the potential  loss to an entity from UFCE using the largest \nannual volatility in the USD- INR exchange rates during the last ten years.3  \nNote: The Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure ( UFCE) in currencies other \nthan USD shall  be converted into USD using the current market rates  for \ndetermining the potential loss from UFCE . \n(b) Banks shall determine the susceptibility of the entity to adverse exchange rate \nmovements  by comput ing the ratio of  the potential loss to entity from UFC E and the \n                                                            \n2 The requirement in clause 4(a) would not be applicable for  entities which are already  submit ting the \ninformation on UFCE as per clause 4(b).  \n3  Banks shall use the data published by FEDAI on largest annual volatility of USD -INR rate over a period of last \n10 years  and the same shall be used for computation of potential  loss by multiplying it with  UFCE.  Reserve Bank of India (Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022  \n4 \n entity\u2019s EBID over the last four quarters  as per the latest quarterly results certified by \nthe statutory auditors4. \nNote: (1) In cases  where banks are not in position to obtain information on UFCE \nor EBID from listed entities for the latest quarter due to restrictions on \ndisclosure of such information prior to finalisation of accounts , banks shall \nhave the option to use data pertaining to the immediately  preceding last \nfour quarter s for computing capital and provisioning requirements.  \n(2) In case of unlisted entities  where  the audited results of the last quarter  \nare not available,  the latest  audited quarterly or annual  results available \nshall be used. The annual  EBID figure used shall  at least be of the last \nfinancial year.  \n(c) Accordingly, banks shall apply incremental capital and provisioning requirements5  \nto all exposures to such entities as under :  \nPotential  Loss / EBID (%)  Incremental \nProvisioning \nRequirement  Incremental Capital  \nRequirement  \nUpto  15 per cent  0 0 \nMore than 15 per cent and \nupto 30 per cent  20bps  0 \nMore than 30 per cent and \nupto 50 per cent  40bps  0 \nMore than 50 percent and upto \n75 per cent  60bps  0 \nMore than 75 per cent  80 bps  25 per  centage point6 \nincrease in the risk weight  \n                                                            \n4 For the purpose of this sub- clause,  the directions  do not differentiate between limited audited results and full \naudited results . \n5 Incremental capital and provisioning requirements sha ll be o ver and  above the present requirements i.e.,  \ngeneral provision for standard assets and applicable credit risk weights as per Master Circular - Prudential norms \non Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances  dated  April  1, 2022  and \nMaster Circular \u2013 Basel III Capital Regulations  dated April 1, 2022  respectively.  \n6 For example: for an entity which otherwise attracts a risk weight of 50 per cent, the applicable risk weight \nwould become 75 per cent.  Reserve Bank of India (Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022  \n5 \n Note: The incremental provisioning for UFCE shall  be based on the total \nexposure amount which is used for computing standard asset provisioning and \nincremental capital requirements for UFCE shall be based on the total exposure \namount which is used for computing credit risk capital requirements . \n(d) Banks shall calculate the incremental provisioning and capital requirements at a \nminimum on a quarterly basis.  \n(e)  For projects under implementation and the new entities, banks shall calculate the \nincremental provisioning and capital requirements based on projected average annual \nEBID for the three years from the date of commencement of commercial operations . \nProvided that  the incremental capital and provisioning requirement shal l be \nsubject ed to a minimum floor of 20 bps of provisioning requirement.  \n(f) In cases where the bank is not able to get sufficient data to assess UFCE and \ncompute incremental capital and provisioning requirements  except for the smaller \nentities covered under the alternative method provided in sub- clause (g) below , the \nbank shall take a conservative view and place the exposure to the entity at the last \nbucket which requires incremental provisioning of 80bps and a 25 per  centage point  \nincrease in risk weight . \n(g) Banks shall have the option to  follow an alternative method f or exposures to smaller \nentities which are having foreign currency exposures and are not in position to provide \ninformation on their UFCE as per clause 4( b). Under this alternative method , banks \nshall apply an incremental provisioning of 10 bps over and above extant standard \nasset provisioning instead of computing incremental capital and provisioning \nrequirements  as provided in clause 5(a) to 5(e) .  \nExplanation: For this purpose, smaller ent ities are those entities on which total \nexposure of the banking system is at Rs. 50 crore or less.  \n6. System s and Controls  \n(a) Banks sh all incorporate the risk of  UFCE of entities  in their internal credit rating \nsystem  and credit risk management  policies and procedures . \n(b) Banks shall stipulate internal limits for UFCE within  the overall Board approved risk \npolicy of the bank .  Reserve Bank of India (Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022  \n6 \n 7. Consortium Lending  \n(a) In the case of consortium / multiple banking arrangements, the consortium leader \n/ bank having the largest exposure shall have the lead role in monitoring the unhedged \nforeign exchange exposure of entities . \nNote:  Banks shall put in place a system for information sharing and dissemination \nin terms of circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.94/08.12.001/2008 -2009 dated December \n8, 2008 on 'Lending under Consortium Arrangement / Multiple Banking \nArrangements',  as amended from time to time \n8. Exemption / Relaxation \n(a) Banks shall have the option to ex clude the following exposures from the calculation \nof UFCE:  \n(i) Exposures to entities classified as sovereign7, bank s8 and individuals .  \n(ii) Exposures  classified as Non -Performing Assets.  \n(iii) Intra-group foreign currency exposures of Multinational Corporations (MNCs) \nincorporated outside India9.   \nProvided that  the bank is satisfied that such foreign currency exposures \nare appropriately hedged or managed robustly by the parent.  \n(iv) Exposures arising from derivative transactions and / or factoring transactions \nwith entities, provided such entities have no other exposures to banks in India.  \n9. Capital Treatment  and Disclosures  \nThe incremental provision require ment  for UFCE shall be  treated as general provision \nfor disclosures and inclusion in Tier 2 capital.  \n10. Overseas Branches/Subsidiaries  \n(a) The provisions of these Directions shall be applicable to overseas \nbranches/subsidiaries of banks  subject to the following:  \n                                                            \n7 For this purpose, sovereign shall include domestic and foreign sovereign as provided in paragraph 5.2 and 5.3 \nof Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations dated April 1, 2022 , as amended from time to time.  \n8 For this purpose, RBI regulated financial institut ions (SIDBI, NABARD, NHB , EXIM Bank  and NaBFID), Bank of \nInternational Settlement (BIS), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and eligible Multilateral Development Banks \n(MDBs) listed in paragraph 5.5 of Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations dated April 1, 2022 shall be \nconsidered as \u2018bank\u2019.  \n9 For example, an Indian subsidiary of an  MNC in corporated outside  India ma y have borrowed from its parent.  Reserve Bank of India (Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022  \n7 \n (i) With respect to the exposure to entities incorporated outside India, information \non UFCE shall be obtained from such entities on a quarterly basis based on \ninternal audit or self -declaration and the requirement of certificate from statutory \naudit ors on annual basis , as provided in clause 4( b), may not be insisted upon. \nIn cases where bank is not able to obtain information on UFCE from concerned \nentities, the treatment provided  in clause 5(f) shall apply.  \n(ii)  Banks shall compute the potential loss due to UFCE by replacing INR with \nthe domestic currency of that jurisdict ion and USD with the foreign currency (i.e., \ncurrency other than domestic currency of that jurisdiction) in which the entity has \nmaximum exposure in clause 5(a) .  \nNote: Banks shall compute the largest annual volatility over a period of last \nten years in the following manner: First, daily changes in the foreign \nexchange rates  shall be computed as a log return of today's rate over the \nprevious day 's rate. Second, daily volatility shall  be computed as standard \ndeviation of these returns over a period of one year (250 observations). Third,  this daily volatility shall  be annualised by multiplying it by square root \nof 250. This computation shall  be performed on a daily basis for the all the  \ndays in the last ten years. The largest annual volatility thus computed shall  \nbe used for the computation of the potential  loss by multiplying it with the \nUFCE.  \nChapter II I \u2013 REPEAL PROVISIONS  \n11.1 With the issue of these Directions, the instructions / guidelines contained in the  \nfollowing circulars issued by the Reserve Bank stand repealed.  \n Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1 DBOD.BP.BC.37/21.04.048/2001 -\n2002 October \n27, 2001 Monetary and Credit Policy \nMeasures - Mid-Term Review for \nthe Year 2001-2002 - Unhedged \nForeign Currency Exposures of \nCorporates  \n2 DBOD.BP.BC.51/21.04.103/2003 -\n2004 December \n5, 2003 Mid-term Review of Monetary and \nCredit Policy for the year 2003-04 - \nUnhedged Foreign Currency \nExposures of Corporates  Reserve Bank of India (Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022  \n8 \n 3 DBOD.BP.BC.96/21.04.103/2008 -\n09 December \n10, 2008 Unhedged Foreign Exchange \nExposure of Clients - Monitoring by \nBanks  \n4 DBOD.BP.BC.No.76/21.04.103/20\n11-12 February \n2, 2012 Second Quarter Review of \nMonetary Policy 2011-12 \u2013 \nUnhedged Foreign Currency \nExposu re of Corporates  \n5 DBOD.BP.BC.No.61/21.04.103/20\n12-13 November \n21, 2012 Second Quarter Review of \nMonetary Policy 2012-13 \u2013 \nUnhedged Foreign Currency \nExposure of Corporates  \n6 DBOD.No.BP.BC.85/21.06.200/20\n13-14 \n January \n15, 2014 Capital and Provisioning \nRequirements for Exposures to \nentities with Unhedged Foreign \nCurrency Exposure \n7 DBOD.No.BP.BC.116/21.06.200/2\n013-14 June 3, \n2014 Capital and Provisioning \nRequirements for Exposures to \nentities with Unhedged Foreign \nCurrency Exposure -Clarifications  \n8 Mailbox Clarification  July 8, \n2016 Capital and Provisioning \nRequirements for Exposures to \nEntities with Unhedged Foreign \nCurrency Exposure \n9 DOR.No.MRG.BC.41/21.06.200/20\n20-21 \n February \n17, 2021 Capital and provisioning \nrequirements for exposures to \nentities with Unhedged Foreign \nCurrency Exposure \n \n11.2 All approvals / acknowledgements given under the above circulars shall be \ndeemed as given under these Directions.  \n11.3 All the repealed circulars are deemed to have been in force prior to the coming \ninto effect of these Directions . Explanatory Note  to Reserve Bank of India  \n(Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022  \n1 \n Explanatory Note1 to Reserve Bank of India (Unhedged Foreign Currency \nExposure) Directions, 2022 \nOctober 11, 2022 \nIntroduction \n1. Unhedged foreign cur rency exposures of any entity  are an area of concern not \nonly for the individual entity but also to the entire financial system. Entities which do \nnot hedge their foreign currency exposures can inc ur significant losses during the \nperiod of heightened volatility in foreign exchange rates. These losses may reduce \ntheir capacity to service the loans taken from the banking system and increase their \nprobability of default thereby affect ing the health of the banking system . \nBackground and Rationale \n2. The Reserve Bank of India first introduced the concept in October 1999 as part \nof ris k management systems  after it was observed during the economic crises in some \ncountries that banks bear additional credit risk on entities  which have unhedged  \nforeign currency  risk. Accordingly, banks were advised to evolve a suitable framework \nfor regular monitoring of foreign currency  risk exposure of entities  which do not have \nnatural hedge and to factor such unhedged exposures of entities  into the risk rating \nsystem for taking credit decisions .  \n3. The aim of the framework was that the banks should price the risk from \nUnhedged Foreign Currency Exposure (UFCE) as credit risk premium  which may  \nnudge entities  to hedge their foreign currency  exposures in the market. To this end,  \nbanks were further advised though a series of instructions to a) regularly monitor  the \nunhedged portion of large foreign currency  exposures  of entities ; b) have a Board \napproved policy on hedging of foreign currency loans ; and c) have a mechanism for \ninformation sharing on UFCE in case of consortium lending. However, a sizeable \nportion of entities\u2019  foreign currency  exposures remained unhedged resulting in \nsignificant but avoidable risks to entities\u2019  balance sheets, in turn, impacting the quality \nof bank\u2019s assets.  \n                                                            \n1 Explanatory Note is a non -technical description of t he rationale / background for introducing the Reserve Bank \nof India (Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022. The sole purpose of this note is to facilitate \nbetter understanding of the Directions by market participants. In case of any conflict  between the explanatory \nnote and the Directions, the Directions shall prevail.  Explanatory Note  to Reserve Bank of India  \n(Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022  \n2 \n 4. To address the risk on bank\u2019s books, banks were advised to maintain \nincremental provisioning and capital requirements for their  exposures to entities with \nUFCE. The process of computing incremental provisioning and capital requirements \ncan be summarised in following steps:  \na) Step 1: A ssess the foreign currency exposure (FCE)  of the entity.  \nb) Step 2: A scertain the amount of UFCE from entities\u2019  FCE taking into account  \ntwo types of hedges \u2013  natural hedge and financial hedge.  \nc) Step 3: Estimate the potential loss to the entity from UFCE exposure of entity \ndue to exchange rate movements.  \nd) Step 4: Maintain incremental provisioning and capital requirements against \nbanks\u2019 exposure to the entity b ased on impact of likely / potential loss on entity \u2019s \noverall profitability . \n5. Base d on banks \u2019 feedback, a few amendments were made to the guidelines for \noperational clarity and accuracy of information obtained. These included, inter a lia, \nallowing collection of information on UFCE directly from entities (through self -certified \n/ audited UFCE certificates) ; clarification on capital treatment of incremental \nprovision ing requirement for UFCE;  and treatment in case bank is unable to obtain  \ninformation on UFCE  from entity . Banks were also given an option to follow an \nalternative method for their exposure to smaller entities. Under this alternative method, \ninstead of obtaining information on UFCE from smaller entities, bank could maintain \nincremental provisioning of 10 bps  for such exposures .  \n6. Further, some exposures were excluded from the ambit of these instructions, \nnamely, inter -bank exposures, intra- group exposures of Multinational Corporations \nincorporated outside India and exposure to entities which have not borrowed from \nIndian banking system . \nKey Changes in the Directions \n7. In addition to consolidating all the instructions on the subject at one place, the \nkey changes that have been incorporated in the Directions are as follows:  \n7.1 Definition of Entity : At present, banks are required to assess  UFCE of all \nentities. The term \u2018entities\u2019 is defined as those entities which have borrowed from banks including borrowing in INR and other currencies irrespective of the size of Explanatory Note  to Reserve Bank of India  \n(Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022  \n3 \n exposure / enti ty. On a review, the revised definition of entity states that \u201cEntity\u201d means \na counterparty  to which bank has exposure in any currency.   \n7.2 Exemption from UFCE guidelines : At present, banks' exposures to an entity \narising from derivative transactions  only is excluded from the purview of UFCE \nguidelines . This exemption has been expanded to include factoring transactions. \nAccordingly, banks\u2019 exposures to an entity arising from derivative transactions and/or \nfactoring transactions only shall be excluded from the purview of UFCE guidelines . In \naddition, t o provide further clarity, the entities exempted from the ambit of these \nguidelines have been provided separately.  \n7.3 Alternative method for exposure to smaller entities : At present, banks have the \noption to follow an alternative method for exposures to \u2018 smaller entities \u2019 which have a) \nUFCE; and b) are not in position to provide information on their UFCE to the bank. However, without obtaining information on UFCE from such entities [refer (b) above)] , \nbanks will not be in position to ascertain whether the entity has U FCE or not [refer (a) \nabove)] . To address this issue, the alternative method has been made applicable for \nexposure to \u2018 smaller entities \u2019 which have FCE,  instead of UFCE , and are not in position \nto provide information on their U FCE.  Further, the definition of \u2018smaller entities\u2019 for this \npurpose has been revised.  \n7.4 Incremental Capital Requirement : At present, t he incremental capital \nrequirement for exposures falling in the last bucket is provided as  25 per cent increase \nin risk weight.  It is clarified that the incremental requirement is 25 percentage points \nincrease in risk weight . For example, if a n entity  which otherwise attracts a risk weight \nof 50%  falls in the last bucket, the applicable risk weight would be 75% (50%+25%).  \nThis is because the exposures falling in same bucket will have equal increase in their \nriskiness irrespective of the original risk weight applicable.  \n***** ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/UNHEDGEDFOREIGN557B15D6B5B8417887A64D6CCB6A8C5F.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 11, 2022", "info": " \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\ufffd \u092c\ufffd\u0915  \n_________________________ RESERVE BANK OF INDIA  ______________________  \nwww.rbi.org.in  \n \n \n\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917,\u0915\ufffd \ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f , 12 \u0935\ufffd \u0914\u0930 13 \u0935\ufffd \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932, \u0915\ufffd \ufffd \u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928 , \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924  \ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d,\u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d,\u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908-400001  \n\u0926\u0942\u0930\u092d\u093e\u0937: 022-22601000 \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938: 022-22705691 \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932: cgmicdor@rbi.org.in                                                                                                                                                                \n            ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nDepartment of Regulation, Central Office, 12th and 13th Floor, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 \nTel: 022 - 2260 1000 F ax: 022 -2270 5691 email: cgmicdo r@rbi.org.in  \n \n\ufffd\u0939\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948 \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e \ufffd\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0907\u090f  \nRBI/2022- 23/130 \nDOR.ACC.REC.No. 74/21.04.018/2022 -23                                        October 11, 2022 \nMadam / Dear Sir,  \nReserve Bank of India (Financial Statements - Presentation and Disclosures) \nDirections, 2021 -  Disclosure of Divergence in Asset Classification and \nProvisioning \nIn terms of paragraph C.4(e) of Annexure III to the Reserve Bank of Indi a (Financial \nStatements -Presentation and Disclosures) Directions, 2021, commercial banks  \n(excluding Regional Rural Banks (RRBs))  are required to disclos e details of \ndivergence  in asset classification and provisioning where such divergence assessed \nby the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) exceeds certain specified thresholds . In order  to \nstrengthen compliance with income recognition, asset classification and provisioning \nnorms, it has  now been decided to introduce similar  disclosure requirements for  \nPrimary (Urban)  Co-operative Banks (UCBs) and revise the specified thresholds for \ncommercial banks.  \n2.  Accordingly, for the financial statements for the year ending March 31, 2023, banks \nshall make suitable disclosures in the manner specified in paragraph C.4(e) of \nAnnex  III to the afore- mentioned Directions, if either or both of the following conditions \nare satisfied:  \n(a) the additional provisioning for non- performing assets (NPAs) assessed by the \nRBI exceeds 10 per cent of the reported profit before provisions and \ncontingencies1 for the reference period; and  \n                                                            \n1 To determine this threshold, UCBs should add back (a) tax expense, and (b) provisions for standard \nand non- performing assets (recognised as expenses in their Profit and Loss Account) to their reported \nnet profits for the year.   \n \n2 \n(b) the additional Gross NPAs identified by the R BI exceed 10 per cent of the \nreported2 incremental Gross NPAs for the reference period.   \nProvided further that i n the case of UCBs  the threshold for reported incremental \nGross NPAs  specified in paragraph 2(b) above shall be 15 per cent , which shall \nbe reduced progressively in a phased manner, after review.  \n3. The thresholds specified in paragraph ( 2) above shall be revised for disclosures in \nannual financial statements for the year ending March 31, 2024, and onwards , as \nunder:  \nRef. Threshold linked to: Commercial \nBanks  (%) UCBs  \n(%) \n2(a) Reported profit before provisions and contingencies  5 5 \n2(b) Reported incremental Gross NPA  5 15* \n*May be reduced subject to review  \nApplicability  \n4.  These instructions are applicable to all commercial banks  (excluding R egional \nRural Banks) and all Primary (Urban) Co -operative Banks .

As per para 16 of the Master Direction \u2013 No n-Banking Financial Company -Systemically \nImportant Non-Deposit taking Company and Deposit taking Company (Reserve Bank ) \nDirections 2016 , applicable NBFCs that are part of a common Group or are floated by a \ncommon set of promoters shall not be viewed on a standalone basis. In line with the existing \npolicy on consolidation of assets of the NBFCs in a Group, the total assets of all the NBFCs1 \nin a Group2 shall be consolidated to determine the threshold for their classification in the \nMiddle Layer.  \n3. If the c onsolidated asset (consolidation as per para 2 above) size of the Group is \u20b91000 \ncrore and above, then each Investment and Credit Company ( NBFC- ICC), Micro Finance \nInstitution ( NBFC- MFI), NBFC-Factor and Mortgage Guarantee Company ( NBFC -MGC ) lying \nin the Group shall be classified as an NBFC in the Middle Layer  and consequently, regulations \nas applicable to the Middle Layer shall be applicable to them.

How will these NBFCs be classified in various \nlayers? \nComment s \u2013On a standalone basis, as per SBR Regulatory Framework,  \n\u2022 HFCs and IFCs will , by default,  be included in the Middle Layer but may move to the \nUpper Layer  based on the supervisory filtering process.  \n\u2022 NBFC-ICC and NBFC -MFI will  be classified in B ase Layer (as their asset size \nconstitutes less than \u20b91000 crore in the example). \n\u2022 NBFC-P2P and NBFC without public funds and customer interface will , by default,  be \nincluded in the Base Layer. \nBased on consolidation of assets of all the NBFCs in the Group, the consolidated asset size \nof the Group becomes \u20b91320 crore (higher than the asset size threshold of \u20b91000 core for \nclassification in Middle Layer). As such, NBFC -ICC and NBFC -MFI will be classified in the \nMiddle Layer. HFC and IFC will continue to be classified in the Middle Layer in this example. \nHowever , NBFC -P2P and NBFC without public funds and customer interface will continue to \nbe classified in the Base Layer.  \nSituation - If the asset size of NBFC -ICC in the above example is \u20b9 10 crore, then would it be \nstill classified in Middle Layer?  \nComment s- Yes, both NBFC -ICC and NBFC -MFI would still be classified in Middle Layer as \nthe consolidated asset size of the Group at \u20b9103 0 crore is higher than the asset size threshold \nof \u20b91000 core for Middle Layer.  \n*** ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI129CEAD60B20A804890B68E2C53FE0C0B5E.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 11, 2022", "info": " \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f  \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\ufffd  \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA  \n \n\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , \u0915 \ufffd \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\ufffd\u0932\u092f  ,\u093f\ufffd\u0924\u0940\u092f \u0924\u0932  ,\u092e\u0941\ufffd \u092d\u0935\u0928 , \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u0930\u094b\u0921 , \u092b\u094b\u091f\ufffd ,  \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 -400001 \nDepartment of Regulation, Central Office, 2nd Floor, Main Building,  Shaheed Bhagat Road, Fort, Mumbai -400 001  \nEmail: cgmicdor@rbi.org.in  \n \u093f\u0939\ufffd\u0940 \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948 , \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u0922\u093e\u0907\u090f\u0964  RBI/2022- 23/128 \nDoR.SIG.FIN.REC. 75/26.03.001/2022- 23                                              October 11, 2022 \n \nAll Asset Reconstruction Companies                                                 \nDear Sir/ Madam,  \nReview of Regulatory Framework for Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)  \nARCs play a vital role in the management of distressed financial assets of banks and \nfinancial institutions. Considering their critical role, a need was felt to review their functioning and operating framework. Accordingly, as part of the \nStatement on \nDeve lopmental and Regulatory Policies  released along with the Monetary Policy \nStatement on April 7, 2021, the Reserve Bank of India had set up a Committee to \nundertake a comprehensive review of the working of ARCs and recommend suitable measures for enabling them to function in a more transparent and efficient manner.   \n2.

Settlement of Dues Payable by the Borrowers under One- time Settlement  \n(i) Under earlier guidelines\n2, each ARC was required to frame a Board- approved policy \nlaying down the broad parameters for settlement of debts due from the borrowers. Further, the Board was permitted to delegate powers to a committee comprising any \n                                                            \n2 (a) Every ARC shall frame a policy duly approved by the Board of Directors laying down the broad parameters for \nsettlement of debts due from borrowers; (b) The policy may,  inter  alia, cover aspects such as cut- off date, formula \nfor computation of realisable amount and settlement of account, payment terms and conditions, and borrower's \ncapability to pay the amount settled; (c) Where the settlement does not envisage payment o f the entire amount \nagreed upon in one instalment, the proposals should be in line with and supported by an acceptable business plan, projected earnings and cash flows of the borrower; (d) The proposal should not materially affect the asset liability \nmanag ement of the ARC or the commitments given to investors; (e) The Board of Directors may delegate powers to \na committee comprising any director and/ or any functionaries of the company for taking decisions on proposals for \nsettlement of dues; (f) Deviation f rom the policy should be made only with the approval of the Board of Directors.   \n6 \n director and/ or any functionaries of the ARC for taking decisions on the proposals for \nsettlement of dues. On a review, the guidelines for the reconstruction of financial assets through settlement of dues payable by the borrowers have been modified as follows:  \na) Settlement of dues with the borrower shall be done only after the proposal is \nexamined by an Independent Advisory Committee (IAC)\n3 which shall consist of \nprofessionals having technical/ finance/ legal background. IAC, after assessing the financial position of the borrower, the time fra me available for recovery of the dues \nfrom the borrower, projected earnings & cash flows of the borrower and other \nrelevant aspects, shall give its recommendations to the ARC regarding settlement \nof dues with the borrower.  \nb) The Board of Directors including at least two independent directors shall deliberate \non the recommendations of IAC and consider the various options available for recovery of dues before deciding whether the option of settlement of dues with the borrower is the best option available under  the existing circumstances and the \ndecision, along with detailed rationale, shall be specifically recorded in the minutes of the Board meeting.  \nc) Settlement with the borrower should be done only after all possible steps to recover the dues have been taken and there are no further prospects of recovering the debt.  \nd) The Net Present Value (NPV) of the settlement amount should generally be not \nless than the realizable value of securities. If there is a significant variation between \nthe valuation of securities recorded at the time of acquisition of financial assets \nand the realisable value assessed at the time of entering into a settlement, reasons thereof shall be duly recorded.  \n                                                            \n3 Under extant guidelines, an ARC is required to constitute an IAC for examining the proposals related to change in \nor takeover  of management of business of the borrower. This IAC shall  also now  examine the proposals of settlement \nof dues with the borrower.   \n7 \n e) The settlement amount should preferably be paid in lump sum. In cases where the \nborrower is unable to pay the entire amount in lump sum,  IAC shall make specific \nrecommendations about minimum upfront lump- sum payment and maximum \nrepayment period.  \nf)  ARCs  shall frame a Board- approved policy based on the above- mentioned \nframework.  \n(ii) Instruction s given under paragraph 2(B)4 of the circular DNBS.(PD).CC.No.37/ SCRC/ \n26.03.001/ 2013- 2014 dated March 19, 2014 on \u2018 Buyback of assets from ARCs by the \ndefaulters and acquisition of assets by ARCs from sponsor banks\u2019 are hereby withdrawn and ARCs shall ensure compliance with Section 29A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 in dealing with the prospective buyers.  \n9. Policy on Management Fees \nThe circular DOR.NBFC(ARC) CC. No. 9/26.03.001/2020- 21 dated July 16, 2020  on Fair \nPractices Code (FPC) requires ARCs to put in place a Board- approved policy on the \nmanagement fee, expenses and incentives. In order to ensure that management fee/ \nincentives charged by ARCs are reasonable and transparent,  the following additional \nmeasures shall be adopted:  \n                                                            \n4  Promoters of the defaulting company/ borrowers or guarantors are allowed to buy back their assets from the ARCs \nprovided the following conditions are met:  \nI. Such a settlement is considered helpful in (i) minimizing or eliminating the cost of litigation and the attendant loss \nof time;(ii) arresting the negative impact of diminution in the value of secured assets which are likely to rapidly lose \nvalue once a unit becom es non -operational;(iii) where the recovery/ resolution process would appear to be rather \nuncertain; and iv) where such settlement will be beneficial for restructuring purposes.  \nII. The valuation of the asset is worked out by the ARCs after factoring in th e following components: The current \nvalue of the proposed settlement (valuation of the asset not more than six months old) vis -\u00e0-vis the net present \nvalue of the recoveries under the alternative mode of resolution taking into consideration the timelines in volved \ntherein; Likely positive or negative changes in the value of the secured asset on account of passage of time; Likely \ndiminution in realisation due to accumulation of statutory dues, liability to employees, etc.; Other factors, if any, \nwhich may affe ct recoveries. \nIII. ARCs shall frame a Policy duly approved by the Board of Directors, which should include the above aspects besides those already contained in clause 7 (5) of the ARC (Reserve Bank) Guidelines and Directions, 2003, as updated from \ntime to  time.  \n  \n8 \n (i) Any management fee/ incentives charged towards the asset reconstruction or \nsecuritisation activity shall come only from the recovery effected from the underlying financial assets.  \n(ii) The Board- approved policy shall indicate the quantitative cap/ limit on the \nmanagement fee/ incentives under various scenarios, any deviation from which shall require approval of the Board.  \n10. Minimum Net Owned Fund (NOF) Requirement  \nThe minimum NOF (as required under para 4 of the \ncircular DNBR. PD (ARC) CC. No. \n03/26.03.001/2016- 17 dated April 28, 2017 on S ecuritisation and Reconstruction of \nFinancial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002- Section 3(1)(b) - \nRequirement of NOF for ARCs) is hereby increased to \u20b9300 crore on an ongoing basis \nfrom the existing requirement of \u20b9100 crore. Consequently, any ARC obtaining the certificate of registration on or after the date of this circular shall not commence the business of securitisation or asset reconstruction without having minimum NOF of \u20b9300 crore . The following glide path is provided for the existing ARCs to achieve the minimum \nrequired NOF of \u20b9 300 crore:  \nCurrent Minimum NOF  By March 31, 2024  By March 31, 2026  \n\u20b9100 crore  \u20b9200 crore  \u20b9300 crore  \nIn case of non- compliance at any of the above stages, the non- complying ARC shall be \nsubject to supervisory action, including prohibition on undertaking incremental business till it reaches the required minimum NOF applicable at that  time.  \n11. Deployment of Surplus Funds  \nPara (e) of the \ncircular DNBS(PD) CC.No.18/SCRC/26.03.001/2009 -2010 d ated April 21, \n2010 on t he subject has been amended. In order to allow  ARCs to manage their surplus \nfunds efficiently, in addition to the avenues already permitted, they are now permitted to \ndeploy the available surplus funds in short -term instruments viz., money market mutual \nfunds, certificates of deposit and corporate bonds/ commercial papers which have a short -\nterm rating equivalent to the long- term rating of AA - or above by an eligible CRA, subject \nto the following conditions:   \n9 \n (i) Maximum investment in such instruments is capped at 10% of the NOF of the ARC.  \n(ii) The ARC shall have a Board- approved policy in this regard.  \n12.

Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) \u2013  expansion in scope of permitted activities  \nAt present, Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) are permitted to undertake foreign currency \nbusiness for limited purposes. With a view to strengthen the role of SPDs as market makers, on a \npar with banks operating primary dealer business, it is proposed to enable SPDs to offer all foreign \nexchange market -making facilities as currently permitted to Category -I Authorised Dealers, subject \nto prudential guidelines. This measure would give forex customers  a broader spectrum of market -\nmakers in managing their currency risk, thereby adding breadth to the forex market in India. Wider market presence would improve the ability of SPDs to provide support to the primary issuance and secondary market activities in government securities, which would continue to be the major focus \nof primary dealer activities. Regulations in this regard would be issued separately.  \n \n***** \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT126AFD18E135EDB4059BD126A18C87DB48D.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 10, 2022", "info": " \n  \nRBI/2022- 23/125 \nDOR.STR.REC.71/21.06.201/2022- 23                   October 10,  2022  \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks  \n(including Small Finance Banks)  \n(Excluding Local Area Banks, Regional R ural B anks and Payments Banks ) \nMadam /Dear Sir,  \nReview of Prudential Norms \u2013 Risk Weig hts for Exposures to Corporates and NBFC s \nPlease refer to paragraph  6.8.1 (i)  of Master Circular  on Basel III capital regulations dated \nApril 1, 2022 in terms of which  banks are permitted to derive risk weights for their unrated \nexposures based on the ratings available for a specific rated  debt subject to the  conditions \nspecified that the bank\u2019s facility ranks pari passu or senior to the specific rated debt in all \nrespects and the maturity of the unassessed claim is not later than the maturity of the rated \nclaim . Banks may also refer to paragraph 6.2.5 of the Master Circular ibid regarding publication \nof bank loan ratings  by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs).   \n2. It is observed that the Press Releases (PRs) issued by ECAIs on rating actions are often  \ndevoid of the lenders\u2019 details. Absence of such information may result in  banks applying the \nderived risk weights for unrated exposures , without satisfying themselves regarding adherence \nto prescribed conditions . This may, consequentially, lead to  potential ly lower provision of \ncapital as well as underpricing of risks. I n order to address the above information asymmetry , \nthe Reserve Bank had  advised the ECAIs vide letter dated June 4, 2021 to disclose the name \nof the banks and the corresponding credit facilities rated by them in the PRs issued on rating \nactions by August 31, 2021, after obtaining requisite conse nt from the borrowers .  \n3. However, on a review it has been observed that the above disclosures are not available in a \nlarge number of PRs  issued by ECAIs owing to the absence of requisite consent by the \nborrowers  to the ECAIs . It is, therefore, advised that a bank loan rating without the above \ndisclosure by the ECAI shall not be eligible for being reckon ed for capital computation by \nbanks. B anks shall treat such exposures as unrated and assign applicable risk weights in terms \nof paragraph 5.8.1 of the Master Circular ibid  read with amendments carried out from time to \ntime.   \n \n  \n4. Illustratively , a scenario may be assumed, where a borrower has availed credit facilities from \nBanks A, B and C and external rating from an ECAI is obtained only in respect of the credit \nfacility extended by Bank A. If the ECAI has disclosed the name of Bank A and the \ncorresponding credit facility rated by it, then Bank A can reckon the said rating  for risk \nweighting purpose. Banks B and C are permitted to derive risk weights  for their respective \nunrated credit facilities subject to conditions stated in paragraph 6.8.1 (i) of Master Circular  \nibid, as permitted hitherto . In the event of ECAI not making the above disclosure, none of the \nbanks shall reckon the said rating, and therefore shall apply risk weight s of 100 percent or 150 \npercent as applicable in terms of extant instructions . \n5. The above instructions shall  be effective from March 31, 2023. \nYours faithfully, \n \n(Manoranjan Mishra ) \nChief General Manager  ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/REVIEWRWS3DEF38B18F3F4D45860F92C8F81432FA.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 06, 2022", "info": " \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\ufffd \u092c\ufffd\u0915  \n_________________________ RESERVE BANK OF INDIA  ______________________  \nwww.rbi.org.in   \n\u0909\u092a\u092d\u094b\ufffd\u093e  \u093f\u0936\ufffd\u0923  \u0914\u0930 \u0938\u0902\u0930\ufffd\u0923  \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , \u0915\ufffd \u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0940 \u092f  \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\ufffd\u0932\u092f , \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0940  \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932 ,\u0905\u092e\u0930  \u093f\u092c\ufffd\ufffd\u0902\u0917 ,\u0938\u0930 \u092a\u0940.\u090f\u092e.\u0930\u094b\u0921,\u092b\u094b\u091f\ufffd,\u092e\u0941\ufffd\u0908  - 400 001 \nConsumer  Education and Protection Department,  Central  Office, 1st Floor,  Amar  Building,  Sir P.M.Road,  Fort, Mumbai  - 400 001  \n\u091f\u0947\u093f\u0932\u092b\u094b\u0928  /Tel No: 91-22-22603000/22604000 \u092b\u0948 \ufffd /Fax No: 91 -22-22631744  \n\u2013  \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \u093f\u0939\u0902\u0926\u0940  \u092e\ufffd \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091a\u093e\u0930  \u0915\u093e \ufffd\u093e\u0917\u0924  \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948  \u2013  \n\u091a\u0947\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0928\u0940 : \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\ufffd \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \ufffd\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932, \u0921\u093e\u0915, \u090f\u0938\u090f\u092e\u090f\u0938  \u092f\u093e \u092b\u094b\u0928-\u0915\u0949\u0932 \u0915\u0947 \u091c\ufffd\u0930\u090f \u093f\u0915\u0938\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \u0935\u094d \u092f\ufffd\ufffd \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0940  \u091c\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0948\u0915 \u0915\u0947 \u0916\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u092c\u094d \u092f\u094c\u0930\u093e, \u092a\u093e\u0938\u0935\u0921\ufffd  \u0906\u093f\u0926 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u0902\u0917\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u092f\u0939 \u0927\u0928 \u0930\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947 \u0928\u0947 \n\u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d \u0924\u093e\u0935 \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e  \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0910\u0938\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d \u0924\u093e\u0935\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u093f\u0915\u0938\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \u0924 \u0930 \u0940 \u0915\u0947  \u0938\u0947 \u091c\u0935\u093e\u092c  \u092e\u0924 \u0926\u0940\u093f\u091c\u090f\u0964  \nCaution:  RBI never sends mails, SMSs or makes call asking for personal information like Bank Account details, passwords, etc.  \nIt never keeps or offers funds to anyone.

If the  \n2 \n \napplicant subsequently approaches for payment of LSF for the same delayed reporting, the date of receipt  of \nsuch application shall be treated as the reference date for the purpose of calculation of \u201cn\u201d . \nf) The facility for opting for LSF shall be available up to three years from the due date of reporting/ submission. \nThe option of LSF shall also be available for delayed reporting/submissions under the Notification No. FEMA \n120/2004-RB  and earlier corresponding regulations, up to three years  from the date of notification of Foreign \nExchange Management (Overseas Investment) Regulations, 2022.   \ng) In case a person responsible for any submission or filing under the provisions of FEMA, neither makes such \nsubmission/filing within the specified time nor makes such submission/filing along with LSF, such person shall \nbe liable for penal action under the provisions of FEMA, 1999.  \n \n2.

The UCBs  under  Tier 3 and Tier 4 \ncategories  shall treat the guidelines in the Circular as a set of minimum guidelines only \nand accordingly frame their own guidelines taking into account their corporate \ngovernance framework, the scale of operations, risk profile, organi sational structure  \nand code of conduct , etc.  \n2. Compliance Risk  \nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or \nloss of reputation a UCB  may suffer , as a result of its failure to comply with laws, \nregulations, rules, and codes of conduct, etc., applicable to its activities .  \n3. Scope and Coverage of Compliance Function \nCompliance Function shall ensure strict observance of all statutory and regulatory \nrequirements for the UCB, including standards of conduct, managing conflict of \ninterest, treating customers fairly and ensuring the suitability of customer  service .  \n4.

A transition time of six months will be provided for ensuring \ncompliance with these guidelines , as and when such UCBs come out of AID .  \n5 \u2018Board Committee\u2019  means \u2018Audit Committee of the Board\u2019    \n \n4 \n 5. Responsibilities of Compliance Function \n5.1 Compliance Function shall be responsible for undertaking the following activities \nat the minimum:  \ni) Assist the Board and the Senior Management in overseeing the implementation \nof Compliance P olicy including policies and procedures,  prescriptions in \nCompliance Manuals, internal codes of conduct, etc.   \nii) Play the central role in identifying the level of C ompliance  risk in the \norganisation.  The Compliance risks in existing  / new products and processes \nshall be analysed and appropriate risk mitigants put in place. The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) shall be a member of the 'new product' committee/s\n6. \nAll new products shall be subjected to intensive monitoring at least  for the first \nsix months of introduction to ensure that the indicative parameters of Compliance risk are adequately monitored.  \niii) Complia nce Function shall monitor and test Compliance by performing sufficient \nand representative C ompliance testing, and the results of such C ompliance  \ntesting shall be reported to the Senior Management.

Staff accountability shall be examined for major Compliance failures.  \niv) Ensure compliance of regulatory  / supervisory directions given by RBI in both \nletter and spirit in a time -bound and sustainable manner.  RBI will continue to \nexpect an effective Compliance Program where all Risk Mitigation Plan (RMP) \n/ Monitorable Action Plan (MAP) points are complied with within the timelines prescribed. Unsatisfactory compliance with RMP/MAP may invite penal action \nfrom RBI.  \nv) Attend to compliance with directions from other regulators in cases where the \nactivities of the entity are not limited to the regulation / supervision of \nRBI. Further, discomfort conveyed to the UCB on any issue by ot her regulators , \nand action taken by any other authorities / law enforcement agencies,  shall be \nbrought to the notice of RBI.  \n                                                            \n6 If there is no such committee in existence, then the CCO shall evaluate all new products before these \nare launched.   \n \n5 \n vi) The Compliance Department  may also serve as a reference point for the staff \nfrom operational departments for seeking clarifications  / interpretations of \nvarious regulatory and statutory guidelines.  \n5.2 The CCO shall be the nodal point of contact between the UCB and the regulators  \n/ supervisors  and shall necessarily be a participant in the structured or other regular \ndiscussions held w ith RBI. Further, compliance to RBI inspection reports shall be \ncommunicated to RBI necessarily through the office of the Compliance Function.  \n5.3 In some UCBs, there may be separate departments  / divisions looking after \ncompliance with different statutory  and other requirements. In such cases, the \ndepartments concerned shall hold the prime responsibility for their respective areas, \nwhich shall be clearly outlined. Adherence to applicable statutory provisions and regulations is the responsibility of each st aff member. However, the Compliance \nFunction would need to ensure overall oversight.   \n6. Broad Contours of Compliance Framework in UCBs  \nA. Compliance Policy \na. The UCB shall lay down a Board- approved Compliance Policy clearly spelling out \nits Compliance philosophy, expectations on Compliance culture, structure and role of \nthe Compliance Function, the role of CCO, processes for identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing and reporting on C ompliance risk. The Policy shall be reviewed \nat least once a year.   \nb. Broadly, the Policy shall ensure coverage of the following aspects:  \ni) Measures to ensure the independence of the Compliance F unction and its \nresponsibility to freely disclose findings and views to Senior Management , \nBoard / Board Committee;  \nii) Focus on various regulatory and statutory C ompliance requirements ; \niii) Monitoring mechanism for the C ompliance testing procedure;  \niv) Reporting requirements , including Compliance risk assessment and change in \nrisk profile, etc., to the Senior Management and to the Board / Board \nCommittee ;  \nv) The authority of the Compliance Function to have access to information as specified in Part D below ;  \n \n6 \n vi) A mechanism for dissemination of information on regulatory prescriptions and \nguidelines among staff and periodic updating of operational manuals; and \nvii) The approval process for all new processes and products by the Compliance Department , prior to their introduction.  \nB. Compliance Structure \nThe Compliance Department shall be headed by the Chief Compliance Officer, \nmeeting the requirem ents prescribed in this Circular. UCBs are free to adopt their own \norganizational structure for the Compliance Function. However, the function shall be independent and sufficiently resourced, its responsibilities shall be clearly specified , \nand its activities shall be subject to periodic and independent review.  \nC. Compliance Programme \nUCBs shall carry out an annual Compliance risk assessment in order to identify and \nassess major C ompliance risks faced by them and prepare a plan to manage the risks. \nThe annual review , to be carried out by the Senior Management, shall ensure coverage \nof at least  the following aspects:  \ni) Compliance failures, if any , during the preceding year and consequential losses \nand regulatory action,  as also steps taken to avoid recurrence of the same;  \nii) Listing of all major regulatory guidelines issued during the preceding year and \nsteps taken to ensure compliance ; \niii) Compliance with fair practices codes and adherence to standards set by self -\nregulatory bodies and accounting standards ; and \niv) Progress in the rectification of significant deficiencies and implementation of recommendations pointed out in various audits and RBI inspection reports.  \nD. Authority  \nThe CCO and Compliance Function shall have the authority to communicate with any staff member and have access to all records or files that are necessary to enable her  \n/ him to carry out entrusted responsibilities in respect of C ompliance issues. This \nauthority shall flow from the Compliance Policy of t he UCB.  \nE. Dual Hatting  \ni. There shall not be any 'dual hatting,' i.e., the CCO shall not be given any responsibility which brings elements of conflict of interest, especially any role relating to business.  \n \n7 \n The CCO shall generally not be a member of any committee which conflicts her / his \nrole as CCO with responsibility as a member of the committee, including any committee dealing with purchases  / sanctions. In case the CCO is a member of any such \ncommittee, that would only be an advisory role.  \nii. The staff in the Compliance Department shall primarily focus on C ompliance \nFunction. However, the Compliance staff could be assigned some other duties while \nensuring that there is no conflict of interest.  \nF. Qualifications and Staffing of Compliance Function \nApart from having staff with basic qualifications and practical experience in business \nlines / audit & inspection functions, Compliance F unction shall have adequate staff \nmembers with knowledge of statutory  / regulatory prescriptions, law, accountancy, risk \nmanagement, information technology, etc. Appropriate succession planning shall be ensured to avoid any future skill gap.  \nG. Internal Audit  & Independent Review of Compliance Function \nCompliance risk shall be included in the risk assessment framework of the Internal Audit Function, and Compliance Function shall be subject to regular internal audit.   The \nCCO shall be kept informed of audit findings related to C ompliance, which shall serve \nas a feedback mechanism for assessing the areas of Co mpliance failures.  \nH.

Such ventures \nthrough easier access to  technology , research and development,  a wider global market and \nreduced cost of capital along with other benefits increase  the competitiveness of Indian entities \nand boost their brand value. These overseas investments are also important drivers of foreign \ntrade and technology transfer  thus boosting domestic employment, investment and growth \nthrough such interlinkages .  \n2.  In keeping with the spirit of liberali sation  and to promote ease of doing business , the Central \nGovernment and the Reserve Bank of India have been progressively simplifying the procedures \nand rationalising the rules  and regulations  under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. \nIn this direction,  a significant step has been taken with operationali sation of a new Overseas \nInvestment regime.

The new \nregime simplif ies the existing framework for overseas investment by persons resident in India to \ncove r wider economic activity and significantly  reduc es the need for seeking specific approval s. \nThis will reduce the compliance burden and associated compliance costs.  \n2 \n  \n3. Some of the significant changes brought about through the new rules and regulations  are \nsummarised below : \n(i) enhanc ed clarity with respect to various definitions ; \n(ii) introduction of the concept of \u201cstrategic sector \u201d; \n(iii) dispensing with the requirement of approval for: \na. deferred payment of consideration;   \nb. investment/disinvestment by persons resident in India under investigation by any \ninvestigative agency /regulatory body ;  \nc. issuance of corporate guarantees to or on behalf of second or subsequent level step \ndown subsidiary  (SDS);   \nd. write -off on account of disinvestment;   \n(iv)  introduction of \u201cLate Submission Fee (LSF) \u201d for reporting delays. \n 4.

Reference shall be made to OI Rules  and OI Regulations  for the definitions of the various terms \nused in these directions . However, the major terms are reiterated and elaborated below : \n(i) \u201cforeign entity\u201d  - the extant concept of Joint Venture (JV)  and Wholly Owned Subsidiary \n(WOS) is substituted under the new regime with the concept of f oreign entity, which means an \nentity formed or registered or incorporated outside India, including in International Financial \nServices Centre ( IFSC ) in India, that has limited liability. \u2018Limited liabil ity\u2019 would mean a structure \nsuch as a limited liability company, limited liability partnership, etc. where the liability of the person \nresident in India is clear and limited. In case of a foreign entity being an investment fund or vehicle, \nduly regulated by the regulator for the financial sector in the host jurisdiction and set up as a trust \noutside India, the liability of the person resident in India shall be clear and limited not exceeding \nthe interest or contribution in the fund  in any manner . Further, the trustee of such fund shall be a \nperson resident outside India.  \n(ii) \u201cstrategic sector\u201d  shall include energy and natural resources sectors such as Oil, Gas, Coal, \nMineral Ores , submarine cable system and start-ups and any other sector  or sub-sector as \ndeemed fit by the Central Government. The restriction of limited liability structure of foreign entity \nshall not be mandatory for entities with core activity in any strategic sector. Accordingly, Overseas \nDirect Investment ( ODI) can be made in such sector s in unincorporated entities as well. An Indian \nentity  is also permitted to participate in a consortium with other international operators to construct \nand maintain submarine cable systems on co-ownership basis. AD banks may allow remittances \nfor ODI in strategic sector  after ensuring that Indian entity  has obtained necessary permission \nfrom the competent authority , wherever applicable.  \n(iii) \u201ccontrol\u201d means the right to appoint majority of the directors or to control the management \nor policy decisions exercisable by a person or persons acting individually or in concert, directly or \nindirectly, including by virtue of their shareholding or management rights or shareholders\u2019 \nagreements or voting agreements that entitle them to ten percent or more of voting rights or in \nany other manner  in the entity . \n(iv) \u201cIndian entity\u201d  \u2013 the extant concept of Indian party  (IP) where all the investor s from India in \na foreign entity were together considered as IP , has been substituted under the new regime with \nthe concept of Indian entity where each investor entity shall be separately considered as an Indian \nentity . Indian entity shall mean a company defined under the Companies Act, 2013 or a body \ncorporate incorporated by any law for the time being in force or a Limited Liability Partnership \nformed under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 or a partnership firm registered under the \nIndian Partnership Act, 1932. 5 \n (v) \u201csubsidiary\u201d/ \u201c step down subsidiary (SDS)\u201d  of a foreign entity  means an entity in which the \nforeign entity  has control and the structure of such subsidiary/SDS shall comply with the structural \nrequirements of a foreign entity , i.e., such subsidiary/SDS shall also have limited liability where \nthe foreign entity \u2019s core activity is not in strategic sector . The investee entities of the foreign entity  \nwhere such foreign entity  does not have control (as defined above) shall  not be treated as SDSs \nand therefore need not be reported henceforth.  \n(vi) \u201cOverseas Direct Investment (ODI) \u201d means (i) acquisition of any unlisted equity capital or \nsubscription as a part of the Memorandum of Association of a foreign entity , or (ii) investment in \n10% or more of the paid -up equity capital of a listed foreign entity , or (iii) investment with control \nwhere investment is less than 10% of the paid-up equity capital of a listed foreign entity .  \nExplanation: Once an investment in a foreign entity  is classified as ODI, the investment \nshall continue to be treated as ODI even if such investment falls below 10% of the paid-up equity \ncapital or the investor loses control in the foreign entity .  \n(vii) \u201cequity capital\u201d  means equity shares or perpetual capital  or instruments that are \nirredeemable or contribution to non -debt capital of a foreign entity , which is in the nature of fully \nand compulsorily convertible instruments. Accordingly, any instrument which is redeemable or \nnon-convertible or optionally convertible shall be treated as debt  for the purpose of OI \nRules/Regulations/Directions . \n(viii) \u201cfinancial commitment\u201d  by a person resident in India means the aggregate amount of \ninvestment by way of ODI, debt other than Overseas Portfolio Investment ( OPI) and non-fund-\nbased facility or facilities extended by it to all foreign entities .

The existing sub- para 2.2.2. (v) stands deleted (and hence the existing sub- paras \n2.2.2.(vi) to 2.2.2.(viii) have accordingly been renumbered) . The corresponding \nprovisions have been suitably incorporated in sub- para 2.4.i. (a) and 2.4.i. (b).  \n \n3. The sub- para 2.2.2. (vii) has been amended to read as follows:  \n \n\u201cCentral Government has decided that with effect from November 5, 2016, designated \nbanks will be paid handling charges (including gold purity testing, refining, transportation, storage and any other relevant costs) for a new MLTGD at a flat rate of 1.5% and commission at the rate of 1% of the rupee equivalent of the amount of gold mobilized under the scheme until further notice.  In case of renewal of deposits, as banks will not incur any expenses on purity testing, refining, transportation, storage \nand insurance etc., the banks will only be given a fixed commission of 1% of the rupee equivalent of the amount of gold on the date of renewal towards their administrative and account maintenance cost. \u201d  \n \n4. A new sub- para 2. 4 has been inserted (and hence the existing sub- paras 2.4 to 2.10 \nhave accordingly been  renumbered)  which  reads as follows -  2  Guidelines for Renewal/Redemption of MLTGD  \ni. General  \na. The redemption of principal at maturity shall, at the option of the depositor, be either \nin Indian Rupee equivalent of the value of deposited gold at the time of redemption, or in gold. However, any premature redemption of MLTGD shall be only in INR. The designated bank shall seek the option of collecting maturing proceeds in gold or in \nIndian Rupee equivalent from the depositor at the time of initial deposit. Additionally, nominee details along with their share in the maturity proceeds may also be ascertai ned by the bank at the time of opening the account. In case of existing \naccounts, designated banks shall ensure the availability of the aforementioned information and submit a compliance report to RBI within six months from the date of issue of these direc tions .  \nb. The interest accrued on MLTGD shall be calculated with reference to Indian Rupee equivalent of value of gold at the time of deposit and will be paid only in INR.  \nc. Designated banks shall inform  the depositors about redemption through letter and \nother means (such as SMS, email, phone call etc. wherever details are available), at least 120 days prior to redemption date and ask them to submit their response within \n30 days on their preference for redemption or renewal. The bank, in its \ncommunication, should include a list of its state- wise branches where the facility of \nredemption in gold is available while also clearly specifying the additional administrative charges to be borne by the depositor for redemption in gold. In its commu nication to the depositor, the bank shall  ask for options on the following:  \n(i) Renewal or Redemption  \n(ii) Redemption in gold or in INR (only for depositors who sought redemption in gold at the time of deposit), along with the name of the branch from where the depositor will collect the gold, as applicable  \nd. The depositor shall be required to present the original deposit certificate issued by the corresponding designated bank for redemption/renewal/premature closure of the MLTGD.  \ne. In case of redemption in INR, if the original saving/current account provided to the \nbank at the time of deposit is not operational, the depositor shall provide details of \nthe alternate saving/current account to the concerned bank.  \nf. Deposits maturing on non- business day shall  be redeemed on the next working day \nwithout any interest for the intervening period.  \n 3  g. In case a deposit is not redeemed on the due date, or the deposit certificate is \npresented for redemption after due date, no interest will be paid on the outstanding deposit for the period overdue.  \nh. The renewal of deposits with retrospective effect shall  not be allowed. Designated \nbanks shall seek the option for renewal from existing customers in the letter which is to be issued as at para 2.4. i.(c) above.  \ni. The excess interest paid in case of premature closure can either be adjusted from the principal amount at the time of repayment or should be recovered separately from the customer by crediting the full principal amount at the time of redemption.  \nj. Designated banks shall pay the amount due at redemption to the depositors on the due date, incur redemption expenses, if applicable and subsequently raise claim to the Government of India through Reserve Bank of India.  \nk. Notwithstanding the procedures and timelines laid down through  these guidelines, \nRBI may issue instructions to banks keeping in mind the practical considerations of banks and the concerns of the depositors.  \nii. Redemption in Gold   \na. The quantity of gold shall be payable in multiples of 10 grams and the remaining \nfraction of gold shall be payable in INR (principal along with interest). With regards \nto fractional quantity, for example 37.103 grams gold deposit, fractional quantity is 7.103 grams which is less than 10 grams, needs to be paid in INR at the prevailing gold rate on the maturity date. The applicable prevailing rate will be governed by \nprovisions at para 2.1.1 of this  Master Direction.  \nb. In case of redemption of deposit in gold, the administrative charge at a rate of 0.5%\n1 \nof the notional redemption amount as on the maturity date in terms of INR will be collected from the depositor and paid to the designated banks to cover logistical and operational costs involved in redemption. These administrative charges may be adjusted against the payment of fractional quantity in INR. If this amount is not found \nsufficient, then the administrative charges may be adjusted against the interest payable to the depositor or may be recovered in cash from the depositor.  \nc. If the depositor does not indicate any choice for mode of redemption (gold or INR) to the bank in response to its 120- day prior communication (issued as at para 2.4. i.(c) \nabove), the option indicated at the time of account opening will prevail. Further, in \n                                                 \n1 The administrative charge has been revised from 0.2% to 0.5% vide Circular DoR.AUT.REC.58/23.67.001/2022- 23 \ndated  August 0 4, 2022 . However, all deposits prior to this date will continue to be governed by the 0.2% (of the \nnotional redemption amount as on th e maturity date in terms of INR) administrative charge in case of redemption in \ngold.  4  case the gold is not redeemed by the customer on the maturity date, such stock will \ncontinue to be kept in the custody of the bank for a maximum period of 60 days. The \ndepositor can renew the deposit during this 60- day period but would be liable to pay \nthe applicable administr ative charge (refer para 2.4.ii .(b) above). If the depositor \ndoes not redeem the deposit on the due date or within 60 days from the maturity \ndate and has also not renewed the deposit, the redemption will automatically be \nmade in INR and the money shall be credited in the linked saving/current account of \nthe depositor in the concerned bank. In case of non- availability of an active bank \naccount, the banks will report the same to RBI, on priority.    \nd. The payment of interest in case of cumulative deposit shall be calculated with reference to Indian Rupee equivalent of value of gold at the time of deposit.  \ne. Arrangement of gold by the designated bank:  \n(i) Each bank shall maintain the stock of gold, at least equivalent to the gold redemption due in next 3 months, out of the gold mobilised under MLTGD. Each bank before giving MLTGD gold for auction to MMTC, shall  seek prior \npermission from RBI. RBI , on behalf of Government of India,  will give such \npermission after assessing the redemption requirement of MLTGD for the next three months and the total stock of gold available with all the banks.  \n(ii) Surplus MLTGD gold with one bank can be transferred to another bank to meet MLTGD redemption. This inter -bank transfer of gold will not be treated as inter -\nbank lending by banks. Banks may also be allowed to purchase India Good Delivery Standard (IGDS) gold/LGDS (LBMA\u2019s Good Delivery Standard) gold bars from the local refineries empaneled with the banks or MMTC and can get \nreimbursement from Government of India.  \n(iii) In case sufficient gold is not available with any bank for redemption, RBI  will \nbring it to the notice of Government of India at least 3 months prior to the date of redemption and an appropriate decision on sourcing of gold shall be taken by \nthe Government.  \niii. Redemption in INR \u2013 Modalities  \nIn case of redemption in INR, the depositor may furnish the original deposit certificate  with his account details in any GMS b ranch of the bank and his  account \nwill be credited accordingly.  \niv. Renewal of Deposit \u2013  Modalities  \na. If a depositor is interested to continue the deposit under GMS either as a MTGD or LTGD, he may be allowed to renew his  deposit irrespective of the option exercised 5  at the time of original gold deposit. However, renewal with retrospective effect shall \nnot be allowed.  \nb. The depositor may inform about his willingness for the renewal of the deposit to the \ndesignated bank in response to the bank\u2019s communication (refer para 2.4.i. (c) \nabove). The bank shall obtain relevant instructions regarding the period of the deposit, redemption option (gold or INR), and interest payment (periodically or on \nmaturity), etc.  \nc. Deposit will be accepted at the prevailing rate on the date of receipt of such request and not from the date of maturity. The customer will not be eligible to claim interest \nfor intervening period.  \nv. Partial Renewal and Partial Redemption in gold/INR \u2013 Modalities  \na. Part of the deposit may also be allowed to be renewed as per the process and terms mentioned above in para 2.4. (iv).  \nb. The redemption of the remaining gold deposit as per the option exercised by the depositor may be permitted.

Credit Facilities to Minority Communities: \n \n1.1 In order to ensure that minority communities secure, in a fair and adequate \nmeasure, the benefits flowing from various Government sponsored schemes, Scheduled Commercial Banks (referred to as \u2018 banks \u2019 hereafter)  are advised to \nensure smooth flow of bank credit to minority  communities.  \n \n1.2 Government  of India has forwarded a list of 121 minority concentration districts         \nhaving at least 25% minority population ( Annexure I\n), excluding those States/UTs \nwhere minorities are in majority (Jammu  & Ka shmir , Punjab, Meghalaya, Mizoram, \nNagaland and Lakshadweep). Accordingly, banks are advised to specially monitor the credit flow to minorities in these 121 districts  thereby, ensuring that the minority \ncommunities receive a fair and equitable portion of the credit within the overall target of the priority sector\n \n \n1.3 In terms of Reserve Bank's Master Direction on P riority Sector  Lending (PSL) dated \nSeptember 04, 2020 ( as updated from time to time) , a target of 40 percent of \nAdjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent amount of Off -Balance \nSheet Exposures (OBE), whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for lending to the priority sector by domestic scheduled commercial banks and foreign banks ; for Small Finance Banks the target  is 75% of \ntheir Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) . Within this, a sub- target of 1 1.5 per cent  of \nANBC or Credit Equivalent amount of OBE, whichever is higher, as  on March 31 of \nthe previous year, has been mandated for FY: 2022- 23 for lending to weaker \nsections which includes, among others, persons from minority communities.    \n \n2.    Definition of Minority Communities  \n \n2.1 The following communities have been notified as minority communities by the Government of India,\n Ministry  of Minority Affairs : \n(a)    Sikhs   \n(b)    Muslims   \n(c)    Christians   \n(d)    Zoroastrians   \n(e)    Buddhists  \n(f)     Jains  \n \n  \n  \n2 \n  \n2.2 In the case of a partnership firm, i f the majority of the pa rtners belong to one or the \nother of the specified minority  communities, advances granted to such partnership \nfirms may be treated as advances granted to minority communities. Further, if the \nmajority beneficial ownership in a partnership firm belongs to the minority \ncommunity, then such lending can be classified as advances to the specified communities. A company is a separate legal entity and hence advances granted to \nit cannot be classified as advances to the specified minority communities.  \n \n3.    Creation of Special Cell and d esignating an exclusive Officer  \n \n3.1  Each bank should set up a special cell having a Nodal Officer holding the rank of \nDeputy General Manager/Assistant General Manager or any other similar rank, in order to ensure smooth flow of credit to minority communities.  \n \n3.2  The Lead Bank in each of the minority concentration districts should have an officer   \nwho shall exclusively look after the problems regarding the credit flow to minority \ncommunities. It shall be his /her responsibility to publicise among the minority \ncommunities various programmes of bank credit and also to prepare suitable schemes for their benefit in collaboration with branch managers.  \n \n3.3  The designated officer should exclusively look after aspects relating to credit \nassistance to minority communities in the concerned districts. The designated officer \nmay be attached to the Lead Bank set up at the district level  so as to receive \nnecessary guidance from Lead District Manager , who will be senior enough and \nhave adequate experience for liaising effectively with the other credit institutions and Government agencies and will also be working in close collaboration with the branch \nmanagers of other banks in the district. The designated officer will also arrange group meetings for their gui dance for formulation of schemes suitable for the \nmembers of the minority communities. B anks concerned may  ensure that the role \nassigned to the designated officer/s is effectively fulfilled.\n \n \n3.4  The name, designation and office address of (i) the officer -in-charge of the Special \nCell at Head Office and (ii) officer appointed by lead banks in the identified districts to look after the problems of minority communities exclusively, should be furnished by banks to the National Commission for Minorities and updated periodically. A copy of the relevant communication may also be furnished to The Chief General Manager, Financial Inclusion and Development Department, Reserve Bank of India, SBS Marg, Fort, Central Office, Mumbai 400001.\n \n  \n  \n3 \n 4. Role of Lead Banks \n \n4.1  Lead Banks of the Minority Concentration Districts will have to exercise the pro-\nactive role expected of them to ensure that the minority communities, particularly \nthose who are poor  and illiterate have access to bank credit for taking up productive \nactivities.  \n \n4.2  The Lead Banks in the 121 identified districts having concentration of minority \ncommunities may involve the State Minority Commission/Finance Corporation in the extension work including creating awareness, identification of beneficiaries, \npreparation of viable projects, provision of backward and forward linkages such as \nsupply of inputs/marketing, recovery etc.  \n \n4.3  They may collaborate with District Development Managers (DDMs) of \nNABARD/NGOs/Voluntary Organizations in reaching the poor through Self Help Grou ps (SHGs).  \n \n4.4  The Convenor banks of the District Consultative Committees (DCCs), District Level \nReview Committees (DLRCs) and the State Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs) should ensure that steps taken to facilitate the flow of credit to the minority communit ies and the progress made in this regard are reviewed regularly at their \nmeetings. Chairman/Managing Director of State Minority Commissions/Boards or the State Minorities Financial Corporations or their representatives may be invited to attend the meetings  of DLRCs/SLBCs.  \n \n5.   Advances under DRI Scheme \nBanks may route loans under the DRI scheme through State Minority Finance/Development Corporation on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to loans routed through SC/ST Development Corporations, s ubject to the \nbeneficiaries of the Corporations meeting the eligibility criteria and other terms and conditions prescribed under the scheme. Banks may ensure proper maintenance of the register to evolve timely sanction and disbursement of loan applications . \n \n6.   Monitoring  \n6.1  D ata on credit extended to members of minority communities should be furnished \nto Reserve Bank of India and to the Government of India, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Minority Affairs, on half yearly basis as at the end of March and \nSeptember every year  within one month from the end of each half year  (\nAnnexure \nII). \n \n  \n  \n4 \n 6.2  The Conveno r banks of the District Consultative Committees in the identified \nminority concentrated districts should furnish the data on priority sector advances \ngranted by banks to specified minority communities compiled by them in the prescribed format (Annexure III\n) for the district under their lead responsibility to the \nconcerned Regional Offices of RBl within one mont h from the close of the relative \nquarter.  \n \n6.3  The progress made in regard to the flow of credit to the minority communities \nshould be reviewed regularly at the meetings of the District Consultative Committees (DCCs) and the State Level Bankers Committees (S LBCs).  \n \n \n6.4  The Lead Banks in the identified minority concentrated districts should furnish the \nrelevant extracts of the agenda notes and the minutes of the meetings of the DCCs and of the respective SLBCs to the Union Ministry of Finance and to the Ministry  of \nMinority Affairs on a quarterly basis for their use.  \n \n7 Training \n \n7.1  With a view to ensuring that the bank staff and officers have proper perspective and \nappreciation of the various programmes for welfare of minorities, necessary orientation may be provided to officials and other staff. For this purpose, banks should include suitable lecture sessions as part of all relevant training programmes like induction courses, programmes on rural lending, financing of priority sectors, poverty alleviation programmes,  etc. \n \n7.2  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may sensitise and motivate the staff \nposted to identified districts through proper training to assist the minority communities under various credit schemes.  \n \n7.3  The Lead Banks may organize sensitization workshops for bank officials regarding \nmicro credit/lending to SHGs with the help of DDMs of NABARD.  \n \n7.4  The Lead Banks functioning in the identified districts should organize Entrepreneur \nDevelopment Programmes so that the members of the minority communities in these areas are enabled to derive the benefit of various programmes being financed by the banks. Depending upon the major vocation and type of activity undertaken by large sections of the people in the districts, suitable programmes may be organized in co -operation with State Governments, Industries Department, District Industries \nCentre, SIDBI, State Technical Consultancy Organization, Khadi and Village Industries Commission and other voluntary organizations which are fully equipped to  \n  \n5 \n impart such training and orientation. The duration of the programme, the course \ncontent, the faculty support to be selected etc. should be decided by each Lead Bank taking into account the prevailing conditions, need and existing skills as well as aptitude of the people in the district.  \n \n8 Publicity  \nBanks should create publicity through various means about the anti -poverty \nprogrammes of the Government where there is large concentration of minority communities and particularly in the districts listed in the Annexure I\n. The lead banks \nin the identified districts may create awareness among minority communities regarding credit facilities available from banks through appropriate measures which may include publicity through (i) print media i.e., distribution of  pamphlets in local \nlanguages, advertisements/articles in newspapers etc. (ii) TV channels - DD/local \nchannels, (iii) participation/setting up of stalls in the Melas/fairs organized during the religious/festive occasions by the minority communities.  \n \n9.   National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC)  \nNMDFC promotes economic and developmental activities for the backward \nsections amongst the minorities. NMDFC works as an apex body and channelises its funds to the beneficiaries through the State Minority Finance Corporation of each  \nState/Union Territory . Banks may implement the schemes evolved by NMDFC. \nWhile extending finance, banks should bear in mind the guidelines/instructions issued from  time to time on priority sector advances.   \n \n10. Prime Minister\u2019s New 15 Point Programme for the Welfare of Minorities \nAn important objective of the above Programme is to ensure that an appropriate \npercentage of the priority sector lending is targeted for the minority communities \nand that the benefits of various government sponsored schemes reach the under -\nprivileged, which includes the disadvantaged sections of the minority communities. \nThe New Programme is to be implemented by the Central Ministries/Departments concerned through State Governments/Union Territories and envisages location of certain proportion of development projects in minority concentration districts. Accordingly, all scheduled commercial banks are required to ensure that within the \noverall target for priority sector lending and the sub- target of 1 1.5 per cent for the \nweaker sections  for FY : 2022- 23, sufficient care is taken to ensure that minority \ncommunities also receive an equitable portion of the credit. Lead Banks have been advised to keep this requirement in view while preparing D istrict Credit Plans. \n  \n  \n6 \n Annexure I \nList of 121 Minority Concentration Districts  \n(Vide paragraph 1.2 and 8) \nSl.

Planning Process  \n \n1.1 The District Level Consultative Committees formed under the Lead Bank Scheme \nshould continue to be the principal mechanism of co- ordination between banks and \ndevelopment agencies in this regard.  The district credit plans formulated by the lead \nbanks should clearly indicate t he linkage of credit with employment and development \nschemes.  \n \n1.2 Banks will have to establish closer liaison with the District Industries Centres, \nwhich have been set up in different districts for promoting self -employment.  \n \n1.3 At the block level, a cer tain weightage is to be given to SCs/STs in the planning \nprocess. Accordingly, the credit planning should be weighted in their favour and \nspecial bankable schemes suited to them  should be drawn up to ensure their \nparticipation and larger flow of credit to  them for self-employment . It will be necessary \nfor the banks to consider their loan proposals with utmost sympathy and \nunderstanding.  \n \n1.4 Banks should periodically review their lending procedures and policies to see that \nloans are sanctioned in time, are adequate and production- oriented and that they \ngenerate incremental income to make them  self-liquidating.   \n \n1.5 While 'adopting' villages for intensive lending, villages with sizeable population of \nSC/ST communities may be specially chosen. Alternatively, specific localities (bastis) \nin the concerned villages which have a concentration of these communities could also \nbe adopted.  \n \n2. Role of Ban ks \n \n2.1 Bank staff may help the borrowers in filling up the forms and completing other \nformalities so that they are able to get credit facility within a stipulated period from the \ndate of receipt of applications.    \n \n3 \n  \n2.2 In o rder to encourage SC/ ST borrowers  to take advantage of credit facilities, \ngreater awareness among them about various schemes formulated by banks needs  \nto be created through various means such as brochures, visits by field staff etc  so that \nsalient features of the schemes, as also the advantages that will accrue to them are \nknown to such borrowers.  Banks should advise their branches to organize meetings \nmore frequently exclusively for SC /ST beneficiaries to understand their credit ne eds \nand to incorporate the same in the credit plan.  \n \n2.3 Circulars issued by RBI/ NABARD should be circulated among the staff for \ncompliance.   \n \n2.4 Banks should not insist on deposits while considering loan applications under \nGovernment sponsored poverty alleviation schemes /self-employment programmes \nfrom borrowers belonging to SCs/ STs. It should also be ensured that applicable \nsubsidy is not held back while releasing the loan component till the full repayment of bank dues. Non -release of subsidy upfront amounts to under -finan cing and hampers \nasset creation/ income generation.  \n \n2.5 The National Scheduled Tribes Finance & Development Corporation and National Scheduled Castes Finance & Development Corporation have been set up under the administrative control o f Ministry of Tribal Affairs and Ministry of Social Justice & \nEmpowerment, respectively. B anks should advise their branches/ controlling offices to \nrender all the necessary institutional support to enable these  institution s to achieve \nthe desired objectives.  \n \n2.6. Loans sanctioned to State Sponsored Organisations for Scheduled Castes/ \nScheduled Tribes for the specific purpose of purchase and supply of inputs and/or the \nmarketing of the outputs of the beneficiaries of these o rganisations are eligible for \npriority sector classification.  \n \n2.7 Rejection of  SC/STs \u2019 loan applications under government programmes  should be \ndone at the next higher level instead of at the branch level and reasons of rejection \nshould be clearly indicated . \n    \n \n4 \n 3. Role of SC/ ST Development Corporations  \n \nThe Government of India has advised all State Governments that the Scheduled \nCaste/ Scheduled Tribes Development Corporations can consider bankable \nschemes/ proposals for bank finance.  \n \n4. Reservations for SC/ ST beneficiaries under m ajor Centrally Sponsored \nSchemes.  \nThere are several major centrally sponsored schemes under which credit is provided \nby banks and subsidy is received through Government Agencies. Credit flow under \nthese schemes is monitored by RBI. Under each of these, there is a significant \nreservation/ relax ation for the members of the SC/ ST communities.  \n4.1 Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana -  National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY -NRLM)  \n \n \n \nDAY-NRLM  (previously known as NRLM)  was launched by the Ministry of Rural \nDevelopment, Government of India by restructuring the erstwhile Swarnajayanti Gram \nSwarozgar Yojana, effective from  April 1, 2013.  DAY-NRLM would ensure adequate \ncoverage of vulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of these benefi ciaries \nare SC/STs. Details  of the scheme are available in the Master Circular on D AY-NRLM  \nas updated from time to time.  \n \n4.2 Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY -NULM)  \n \n \nThe Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHU A), Government of India, launched  \nthe DAY-NULM  (previously known as NULM)  by restructuring  the erstwhile Swarna \nJayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana  (SJSRY), effective from  September 24, 2013.  Under \nDAY-NULM, adv ances should be extended to SCs/ STs to the extent of their strength \nin the loc al population. Details of  the scheme  are available in the Master  Circular  on \nDAY-NULM  as updated from time to time.   \n4.3 Differential Rate of Interest (DRI) Scheme  \n \nUnder the DRI Scheme, banks provide finance up to \u20b915,000/ - at a concessional rate \nof interest of 4 per cent  per annum to the weaker sections of the community for \nengaging in productive and gainful activities. In order to ensure that persons belonging \nto SCs/ STs also derive adequate benefit under the DRI Scheme, banks have been \nadvised to grant elig ible borrowers belonging to SCs/ STs such advances to the extent \nof not less than 2/5th (40 percent) of total DRI advances. Further, the eligibility criteria  \n \n5 \n under DRI , viz. size of land holding should not exceed 1 acre of irrigated land and 2.5 \nacres of unirrig ated land,  are not applicable to SCs/STs. Members of SCs/ STs \nsatisfying the income criteria of the scheme can also avail of housing loan up to \n\u20b920,000/ - per beneficiary over and above the individual loan of \u20b915,000/ - available \nunder the scheme.  \n \n5. Credit Enhancement Guarantee Scheme for Scheduled Castes (CEGSSC)  \nThe CEGSSC was launched by Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment on May  6, \n2015 with the objective of promoting entrepreneurship amongst the Scheduled Castes \n(SCs), by providing credit enhancement guarantee to Member Lending Institutions \n(MLIs), which extend  financial assistance to these entrepreneurs. IFCI Ltd. has been \ndesignated as the Nodal Agency under the scheme, to issue the guarantee cover in \nfavour of MLIs  for financing SC entrepreneurs . \n \nIndividual  SC entrepreneurs /Registered Companies and Societies/Registered \nPartnership Firms/Sole Proprietorship firms having more than 51% shareholding  and \nmanagement control for the previous  6 months by SC entrepreneurs/  promoters/  \nmembers  are eligible for guarantee from IFCI Ltd. against the loans extended by MLIs.   \n \nThe amount of g uarantee cover under CEGSSC  ranges from a minimum of  \u20b90.15 cr \nto a maximum  of \u20b95.00 cr. \n \nThe t enure of g uarantee is up to a m aximum  of 7 years or repayment period,  whichever \nis earlier.  \n \n6. Monitoring and Review  \n \n6.1 A special cell should be set up at the Head Office of banks for monitoring the flow \nof credit to SC/ ST beneficiaries. Apart from ensuring the implementation of the RBI \nguidelines, the cell would also be responsible for col lection of relevant information/ data \nfrom the branches, consolidation thereof and submission of the requisite returns to  \nRBI and Government.  \n \n6.2 The Head Office of banks should periodically review  the credit extended to \nSCs/ STs on the basis of returns and other data received from the branches. Any major \ngap or variation in credit flow to SC s/STs on a year to year basis should be reported  \n \n6 \n to the Board  as part of the  review on the theme of \u201cFinancial Inclusion\u201d in term of \ncircular DBR No.BC.93/29.67.001/2014- 15 dated May  14, 2015.   \n \n6.3 Bank s should review the measures taken to enhance the flow of c redit to SC/ ST \nborrowers on a quarterly basis.

Though t hey have the option to apply afresh \non meeting the prescribed criteria, ceasing operations may lead to disruption in payment systems . \nIt is also possible that s ome PAs had  not applied to RBI due to  non-fulfilment of  eligibility criteria.  \n \n3. Keeping in view the disruption caused by  the C OVID-19 pandemic , and to ensure smooth \nfunctioning of  the payment s ecosystem , it has since been decided to allow another window to all \nsuch PAs (existing as on March 17, 2020) to apply  to RBI . They can apply by September 30, 2022 \nand shall have a net worth of \u20b915 crore as on March 31, 2022. They shall be permitted to continue \ntheir operations till they receive communication from RBI regarding the fate of their application.  \nThe timeline  of March 31, 2023 for  achieving the net worth of \u20b925 crore shall , however,  remain.   \n \n \n 2 \n  \n4. All other provisions of the circulars referred to above, shall continue to be applicable.  \n \n5. This directive is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of the PSS Act, 2007 \n(Act 51 of 2007).  \n \nYours faithfully,  \n \n(P.

However, the \nentire loan (irrespective of the loan outstanding, even if it subsequently goes below \u20b910 lakh) would be eligible for cov erage under Credit Guarantee Fund for Micro Units \n(CGFMU).   \n \n8  (iii)  For loan to SHG s above \u20b910 lakh and up to \u20b9 20 lakh, a margin not exceeding 10% of \nthe loan amount exceeding \u20b9 10 lakh may be obtained as per the bank\u2019s approved loan \npolicy.  \n \n7.3.7 Dealing with Defaulters:  \nWillful defaulters  should not be financed under  DAY- NRLM.  In case willful defaulters are \nmembers of a group, they may be allowed to benefit from the thrift and credit activities of \nthe group including the corpus built up with the assistanc e of Revolving Fund. However, \nas regards credit facilities, the group may be financed excluding such defaulters while \ndocumenting the loan. Banks should not deny loans to SHG s on the grounds of  family \nmember s of individual members of SHG being defaulter s with the bank. Further, non-\nwillful defaulters should not be debarred from receiving loans. In case default is due to \ngenuine reasons, banks may follow the norms prescribed for restructuring the credit \nfacilities . \n7.3.8 Documentation and follow - up \n(i) Loan pass books or statement of accounts in regional languages may be issued to the \nSHGs which may contain all the details of the loans disbursed to them and the terms \nand conditions applicable to the loan sanctioned. The passbook should be updated \nwith every transaction made by the SHGs.  At the time of documentation and \ndisbursement of loan, banks may clearly explain the terms and conditions as part of financial  literacy.  \n(ii)  Bank branches may designate one fixed day in a fortnight to enable the staff to go to  \nthe field and attend the meetings  of the SHGs  and Federations  to observe the operations \nof the SHGs , keep a track of the regularity of  the SHGs \u2019 meetings and monitor their \nperformance.  \n \n8 Recovery:  \nPrompt repayment of the loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks  shall take all possible measures,  such as  personal  contact  and  organization of joint \nrecovery camps with District Mission Management Units  (DMMUs)/District Rural \nDevelopment Agency  (DRDAs ) to ensure the recovery of loans. Keeping in view the  \n \n9  importance of loan recovery, banks should prepare a list of defaulting SHGs under DAY -\nNRLM every month and furnish the list in the Block  Level Bankers  Committee ( BLBC)  and \nDistrict Consultative Committee (DCC)  meetings.  This would enable the DAY- NRLM  staff \nat the block /district level to assist  the bankers in initiating recovery . \n \n9 Credit  Target  Planning and Monitoring of the Scheme \n(i) Banks may set up cells for Self Help Groups in their  respective Regional/Zonal offices . \nThese cells should periodically monitor and review the flow of credit to the SHGs, ensure the implementation of the S cheme, collect data from the branches and make \navailable consolidated data to the Head O ffice and the DAY -NRLM units at the \ndistricts/blocks. The consolidated data may also be discussed in the State  Level  \nBankers\u2019  Committee  (SLBC), BLBC and DCC meetings regularly to maintain effective \ncommunication with the state staff and all banks.  \n(ii)   State  Level  Bankers\u2019  Committee:  SLBCs  shall constitute a sub-committee  on SHG bank \nlinkage. The sub- committee should consist of members from all banks operating in the \nState, RBI, NABARD, CEO of SRLM, representatives of State Rural Development \nDepartment, Secretary -Institutional Finance and r epresentatives of Development \nDepartm ents etc.  Based on the Potential  Linked  Plan/State  Focus  Paper  prepared by \nNABARD,  the SLBC sub -committee on SHG Bank Linkage may arrive at the district -\nwise, block -wise and branch- wise credit plan. The sub- committee should consider the \nexisting SHGs, new SHGs  proposed,  and number  of SHGs  eligible  for fresh  and repeat  \nloans  as suggested by the SRLMs to arrive at the credit targets for the states. The \ntargets so decided should be approved in the SLBC and reviewed and monitored periodically for effective implementation. The sub- committee shall discuss a specific \nagenda of review, implementation and monitoring of the SHG -Bank linkage and the \nissues/constraints in achievement of the credit target. The decisions of the SLBC \nshould be derived from the analysis of the reports of the sub-committee.  \n(iii) The district -wise credit plans should be communicated to the District Consultative \nCommittee (DCC). The b lock- wise/ cluster -wise targets are to be communicated to the \nbank branches through the Controllers . \n(iv) District Co nsultative  Committee: The DCC shall regularly monitor the flow of credit to \nSHGs at the district level and resolve issues that constrain such  flow of credit.  This  \n \n10  committee  should include DM MU staff representing DAY -NRLM and office bearers of \nSHG federations  in addition to other members . \n(v)  Block  Level  Bankers  Committee:  The BLBC shall take up issues of SHG bank linkage \nat the block level. In this Committee, the SHGs/Federations of the SHGs should be \nincluded as members to raise their voice in the forum. Branch- wise status of SHG \ncredit shall be monitored at the BLBC.  \n(vi) Reporting to Lead District Managers:  The branches may furnish the progress report \nand the delinquency report under various activities of DAY -NRLM in the format at \nAnnex \u2013III and IV to the LDM every month for onward submission to Special Sub-\nCommittee constituted by  SLBC.  \n(vii) Reporting to RBI: Banks may furnish a state -wise consolidated report on the progress \nmade under  DAY- NRLM to RBI on quarterly basis  within a month from the end of the \nconcerned quarter.  \n(vii) Lead Bank Return (LBR): Existing procedure of submitting LBR is to be continued. \n10  Financial Literacy:  \nFinancial Literacy is one of the important strategies to spread awareness  on financial  \nbehavior  and keep households  informed  about  various financial products and services. \nDAY- NRLM has trained and deployed a large number of cadre called \u2018Financial Literacy \nCommunity Resource Persons (FL- CRPs)\u2019 to carry out financial literacy camps at village \nlevel. Financial Literacy Centers (FLC) established by various bank s may coordinate with \nrespective SRLMs and utilize the services of FL- CRPs to conduct village camps on \nFinancial  Literacy.  \n \n11  Data  Sharing:  \n \n(i) Banks may furnish data in a mutu ally a greed format/interval to DAY -NRLM or State Rural \nLivelihood Missions (SRLMs) for initiating various strategies including recovery  etc. Such \ndata may be drawn directly from the CBS platform.  \n \n(ii) Banks  should  share data of Pradhan Mantri  Jeevan Jyoti Bima  Yojana (PMJJBY)  and \nPradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) with DAY -NRLM in agreed formats \nto facilitate higher enrollment and claim settlement under the mentioned schemes.  \n(iii) Banks  should share data of all SHG transactions being done at Business  \n \n11  Correspondent points using d ual authentication technology , in a mutually agreed \nformat/interval after obtaining consent of the customer. Banks should ensure security \nand confidentiality of customer information available with BCs.  \n \n12  DAY- NRLM support to Banks:  \n \n(i) SRLM would develop strategic partnerships with major banks at various levels. It \nwould invest in creating enabling conditions for both the banks and the poor for a mutually rewarding relationship.  \n(ii) SRLM would  assist the SHGs through imparting financial l iteracy, extending \ncounselling services on savings, credit, insurance, pension and training on m icro- \ninvestment  planning embedded in capacity  building.  \n(iii) SRLMs  would  extend support  to banks  for improving quality  of banking services to poor \nclients including follow -up for recovery of over dues if any, by positioning customer \nrelationship managers (Bank Mitra/ Sakhi) with every bank branch involved in financing of SHGs. \n \n(iv) Leveraging IT mobile technologies and institutions of the poor, yout h or SHG member s \nas business facilitators and business  correspondents.  \n(v) Community Based Repayment M echanism (CBRM):  One exclusive sub- committee for \nSHG Bank Linkage may be formed at village/cluster/block level which would  provide \nsupport to the banks in ens uring proper utilization of loan amount, recovery etc. The \nbank linkage sub- committee members from each village level federation along with \nproject staff would  meet once in a month under the chairmanship of the Branch \nManager in the branch premises with the agenda items relating to bank  linkage.   \n \n12  Annex I   \n  \n   \nKey Features of DAY -NRLM   \n  \n1. Universal Social Mobilization: To begin with, DAY -NRLM would ensure that at least \none member from each identified rural poor household, preferably a woman, is brought \nunder the SHG  network in a time bound manner. Subsequently, both women and men \nwould be organized for addressing livelihood issues i.e. farmers organizations, milk producers\u2019 cooperatives, weavers associations, etc. All these institutions are inclusive  \nand no poor would be left out of them. DAY -NRLM would ensure adequate coverage of   \nvulnerable sections  of  the  society  such  that  50%  of  the beneficiaries are SC/STs, \n15% are minorities and 3% are persons with disability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of all households under the automatically included criteria and households with at least one deprivation criteri on as per Socio- Economic and Caste \nCensus (SECC).    2. Participatory Identification of poor (PIP):  DAY- NRLM would  undertake a \ncommunity  based process  for covering the target beneficiaries  i.e. participation of the \npoor in the process of identifying the target group. Participatory process based on sound methodology and tools (social mapping and well -being categorization, deprivation \nindicators) and also locally understood and accepted criteri a ensures local consensus \nthat inadvertently reduces the inclusion and exclusion errors and enables formation of the groups on the basis of mutual affinity.   \n The households identified with at least one deprivation criteria as per  Socio -Economic \nand Caste Census  (SECC) along with households identified through the P.I.P process \nwould be accepted as DAY -NRLM target group and would  be eligible for all the benefits \nunder the programme. The list finalized after P .I.P process would  be vetted by the Gram \nSabha and approved by the Gram Panchayat.     Till the P.I. P process is undertaken by the State in a particular district/ block, the rural \nhouseholds with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC list would  be targeted \nunder DAY -NRLM. As already provided in the Framework for implementation of DAY - \n \n13  NRLM, up to 30% of the total membership of the SHGs may be from among the \npopulation marginally above the poverty line, subject to the approval of other members of the group. This 30% also includes the poor households whose name does not figure \nin the SECC list but are as poor as those included in SECC list.    \n3. Promotion of Institutions of the poor: Strong institutions of the poor such as SHGs and their village level and higher -level federations are necessary to provide space, voice \nand resources for the poor and for reducing their dependence on external agencies. They empower them and also act as instruments of knowledge and technology dissemination, and hubs of production, collectivization and commerce. DAY -NRLM, therefore, would \nfocus on setting up these institutions at various levels. In addition, DAY -NRLM would \npromote specialized institutions like Livelihoods collectives, producers\u2019 \ncooperative/companies for l ivelihoods promotion through deriving economies of scale, \nbackward and forward linkages, and access to information, credit, technology, markets etc. The Livelihoods collectives would enable the poor to optimize their limited resource.   \n  \n4. Strengthening all existing SHGs and federations of the poor. There are existing \ninstitutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of NGOs. DAY - \nNRLM would strengthen all existing institutions of the poor in a partnership mode. The self-help promoting institutions both in the Government and in the NGO sector would \npromote social accountability practices to introduce greater transparency. This would be in addition to the mechanisms that would be evolved by SRLMs and state governments.  \nThe learning from one another underpins the key processes of learning in DAY -NRLM.  \n  \n5. Emphasis on Training, Capacity B uilding and S kill Building:  DAY- NRLM would \nensure that the poor are provided with the requisite skills for managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods, enhancing their credit absorption capacity and credit worthiness, etc. A multi -pronged approach is envisaged \nfor continuous capacity building of the targeted families, SHGs, their federations , \ngovernment functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders. Particular focus would be on developing and engaging community professionals and community resource persons for capacity building of SHGs and their federations and other collectives. DAY -  \n \n14  NRLM would make extensive use of Information, Communication & Technology( ICT) to \nmake knowledge dissemination and capacity building more effective.  \n \n6. Revolving Fund and Community I nvestment Support Fund (C.I.F): A Revolving \nFund would be provided to eligible SHGs as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thrift and accumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long- run and \nimmediate consumption needs in the short -run. The C.I.F would be a corpus and used \nfor meeting the members\u2019 credit needs directly and as catalytic capital for leveraging repeat bank finance. The C.I.F would be routed to the SHGs through the Federations. The key to coming  out  of  poverty  is  continuous  and  easy  access  to  finance,  at \nreasonable rates, til l they accumulate their own funds in large measure.   \n  \n 7. Universal Financial Inclusion: DAY- NRLM would work towards achieving universal \nfinancial inclusion, beyond basic banking services to all the poor households, SHGs and their federations. DAY -NRLM would work on both demand and supply side of Financial \nInclusion. On the demand side, it would promote financial literacy among the poor and provides catalytic capital to the SHGs and their federations. On the supply side, it would coordinate with the financial sector and encourage use of ICT based financial \ntechnologies, business correspondents and community facilitators like \u2018Bank Mitras\u2019. It \nwould also work towards universal coverage of rural poor against loss of life, health and \nassets. Further, it would work on remittances, especially in areas where migration is \nendemic.     \n8. Provision of Interest Subvention: The rural poor need credit at low rate of interest and in multiple doses to make their ventures economically viable. In order to ensure affordabl e credit, DAY- NRLM has a provision for subvention on interest rates.  \n  \n9. Funding Pattern: DAY -NRLM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the financing of \nthe programme would be shared between the Centre and the States in the ratio of 60:40 (90:10 in case of North Eastern States including Sikkim; completely from the Centre in case of UTs). The Central allocation earmarked for the states would broadly be distributed in relation to the incidence of poverty in the states.    \n \n15    \n10. Phased Implementation: Social capital of the poor consists of the institutions of the \npoor, their leaders, community professionals and more importantly community resource \npersons (poor women whose lives have been transformed through the support of their institutions). Building u p social capital takes some time in the initial years, but it multiplies \nrapidly after some time. If the social capital of the poor does not play the lead role in DAY- NRLM, then it would not be a people\u2019s programme. Further, it is important to ensure \nthat the quality and effectiveness of the interventions is not diluted. Therefore, a phased \nimplementation approach is adopted in DAY -NRLM.   \n  \n11. Intensive blocks. The blocks that are taken up for implementation of DAY -NRLM, \n\u2018intensive blocks\u2019, would have acc ess to a full complement of trained professional staff \nand cover a whole range of activities of universal and intense social and financial inclusion, livelihoods, partnerships etc. However, in the remaining blocks or non-  \nintensive blocks, the activities m ay be limited in scope and intensity.   \n  \n12. Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs). RSETI concept is built on \nthe model pioneered by Rural Development Self Employment Institute (RUDSETI) \u2013  a \ncollaborative partnership between SDME Trust and Canara Bank. The model envisages transforming unemployed youth into confident self -employed entrepreneurs through a \nshort duration experiential learning programme followed by systematic long duration hand holding support. The need- based training builds entrepreneurship qualities, \nimproves self -confidence, reduces risk of failure and develops the trainees into change \nagents. Banks are fully involved in selection, training and post training follow up stages. The needs of the poor articulated through the institut ions of the poor would guide RSETIs \nin preparing the participants/trainees in their pursuits of self -employment and \nenterprises. DAY -NRLM would encourage public sector banks to set up RSETIs in all \ndistricts of the country.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n16  Annex II   \n  \nInterest Subvention Scheme for Women SHGs  \n \n I. Interest subvention scheme on Credit to Women SHG during the year 2022- 23 \nfor all Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks and Small Finance Banks in all \ndistricts  \n \ni. The scheme is limited to Women Self Help Groups under DAY -NRLM in rural areas \nonly.  \nii. For loans up to \u20b9 3 lakh under the scheme, banks will extend credit at a concessional \ninterest rate of 7% per annum. For outstanding credit balance upto \u20b93 lakh, banks will be subvented at a uniform rate of 4.5% per annum during FY 2022- 23. \niii. For loans above \u20b93 lakh and up to \u20b95 lakh under the scheme, banks will extend credit \nat interest rate equivalent to their 1 year -MCLR or any other external benchmark based \nlending rate or 10% per annum, whichever is lower. For out standing credit balance above \n\u20b93 lakh and upto \u20b95 lakh, banks will be subvented at a uniform rate of 5% per annum during FY 2022- 23. \niv. Interest Subvention will be payable only for the period during which an account \nremains in standard category. Illustrations on calculation of interest subvention are given \nas Annex V\n. \nv. Women SHGs promoted by other agencies and following the DAY -NRLM protocols \nwill also be eligible for benefit of subvented loans subject to prior submission of the \ndetails of such SHGs on the DAY -NRLM SHG database.  \nvi. The interest subvention scheme shall be implemented for b anks through a Nodal Bank \nselected by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD). The Nodal Bank will operationalize the scheme through a web based platform, as advised by MoRD. For the year 2022- 23, Indian Bank has been nominated as the Nodal bank by MoRD.  \nvii. In order to avail the interest subvention on credit extended to the women SHGs, banks \nmay ensure that the accounts of SHGs (both savings and loans) under DAY -NRLM are \nappropriately identified in their CBS with unique codes assigned by DAY -NRLM/SLRMs.   \n \n17  viii. All banks participating in the interest subvention scheme are required to upload  \ninformation on the SHG savings and loan account , etc. on the respective Nodal Bank/ \nNodal Agency portal as per the required technical specifications provided.  \nix. In order to avail the interest subvention on credit upto \u20b9 3 lakh extended to women \nSHGs under DAY- NRLM @7%  as well as  on credit above \u20b93 lakh and upto \u20b95 lakh \nextended to SHGs, all banks  are required to submit claim certificates on quarterly basis \n(i.e. as on June 30, 2022; September 30, 2022; December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023) \nto the N odal Bank. The claims submitted by any bank should be accompanied by claim \ncertificate (in original) certifying the claims for subvention as true and correct. The claims \nof any bank for the quarter ending March 2023 will be settled by MoRD only on receipt \nof the Statutory Audit or\u2019s certificate for the entire financial year i.e.,  FY2022- 23, from the \nbank . \nx. The format of the  claims certificates shall  be as per  Annex VI & VII. All claims pertaining \nto FY 2022 -23 should be submitted by banks latest by September 30, 2023 duly certified \nby Statutory Auditor.  \nxi. Any remaining claims pertaining to the disbursements made during the year 2022- 23 \nand not included during the year, may  be consolidated separately and marked as an \n'Additional Claim' and submitted to the Nodal Bank latest by September 30, 2023, duly \ncertified by Statutory Auditors.  \nxii. Any corrections in claims by banks shall be adjusted from later claims based on the \nStatutory Auditor\u2019s certificate. All banks will be required to carry out necessary correction \non the Nodal Bank\u2019s/Agency\u2019s portal accordingly.   \n \n18 \n Annex  III \n \nBranch Name:  \n Bank Name:  \n            Block Name:  \nProgress report  for  \nthe month of ------,             District:  \n20--             State: \nNo. of loans \u2013  Actual * \u20b9 lakh \n \n \n \n \n \nS.

In the backdrop of introduction of the new series banknotes, these parameters have \nbeen reviewed and a revised set of guidelines are enclosed for implementation . \n3. The guidelines shall be implemented with immediate effect.  \nYours faithfully  \n \n(Sanjeev Prakash)  \nChief General Manager  \nEncl : As above.  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \nGuidelines on Note Authentication and Fitness Sorting Parameters \n1. Introduction  \nA fit note is a note that is genuine, sufficiently clean to allow its denomination to be \nreadily ascertained and thus suitable for recycling. An unfit note is a note that is not \nsuitable for recycling because of its physical condition or belongs to a series that has \nbeen phased out by Reserve Bank of India. All the fitness parameters laid down in this document are to be evaluated individually. A note must pass all the fitness parameters \nto be considered fit for recycling.  \nThese parameters provide the minimum standards for cash handling machines used \nby banks (hereinafter called \u2018the machines\u2019). Notes can only be recycled / reissued if \nthey are evaluated as genuine and fit according to these parameters . Authenticity \ncheck is a prerequisite for fitness sorting. Fitness sorting can be done only in case of \ngenuine notes. The machines shall be able to identify and segregrate suspected \ncounterfeits and not es which are unfit for circulation in terms of these standards in a \nreliable and consistent manner . \nThe Reserve Bank of India phases out certain series of notes from circulation from time to time. These notes, though considered legal tender unless otherwise specified, are unfit for re issue . As and when the Reserve Bank of India decides to phase out a \nspecific series of a specific denomination of notes, the machines shall sort all the \nphased out notes as unfit, irrespective of their physical conditio n. \n2. Applicability  \nThese parameters are applicable to machines operated by banks, either directly by their staff or indirectly by their agents. These machines can be of any of the following:  \ni. machines which check the authenticity and fitness of notes, i.e.  note \nprocessing machines / note sorting machines, and \nii. machines which check only the authenticity of notes, i.e. note authentication machines and classify the individual notes as either genuine or suspect.  \n   \n \n3. Authenticity Check \nThe machines shall perform authenticity check with reference to the features of \ngenuine notes as disclosed by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time  on its \nwebsite . Any note which is not found to be having all the features of a genuine note \nshall be classified by the machine as suspect / reject . \n4. Fitness Sorting \nAs a part of fitness sorting, notes with any visual or physical defects are to be sorted \nas unfit as per  the criteria set out in Table 1.  \nTable 1: Sorting Criteria  \nSl.No. Feature  Criteria  \n1 Soiling  General distribution of dirt across the entire note  \n2 Limpness  Structural deterioration resulting in a marked lack of \nstiffness  \n3 Dog-ears Corner folds  \n4 Tears  Lengthwise and crosswise cuts  \n5 Holes  Holes of a specific diameter  \n6 Stains  Localised concentration of dirt  \n7 Graffiti  Deliberate graphic alteration of the note  \n8 Crumples  Multiple random folds  \n9 Decolouration  Lack of ink on part or whole of the note, e.g. a washed note  \n10 Folds  Folds reducing the length or width of the note  \n11 Repair  Note repaired using adhesive tape/ paper/ glue  \n(i) Soiling  \nSoiling refers to the general distribution of dirt across the entire note or in some \npatterns. It is a measure of the loss of reflectivity from the unprinted areas due to dirt, ageing (yellowing), wear and extraneous markings and includes decolouration due to ageing, excessive folding and other wearing. Soiling increases the optical density and decreases the reflectance of the notes. Notes exceeding the soiling levels set out  in Table 2 shall be sorted as unfit. Both the obverse and the reverse of the note shall \nbe checked for soiling.  \nSl. \nNo. Denomination  Maximum Density \ndifference  Minimum \nReflectance  \n1 \u20b95 0.07 85% \n2 \u20b910 0.07 85% \n3 \u20b920 0.06 87% \n4 \u20b950 0.06 87% \n5 \u20b9100 0.05 90% \n6 \u20b9200 0.05 90% \n7 \u20b9500 0.04 93% \n8 \u20b92000 0.03 95% \n(ii) Limpness \nLimpness relates to structural deterioration or wear resulting in a marked lack of \nstiffness in the note paper.

Notes with holes with area exceeding \n8 mm\u00b2 shall be sorted as unfit.  \n(vi) Stains  \nStains are visible markings which are not part of the feature of a note. Notes shall be \ndetected as unfit if localized -  i.e. with limited extension \u2013  stain can be recognised on \nits surface. In case the total area covered by stains exceeds 500 mm\u00b2, the note shall \nbe sorted as unfit. A note with a single stain covering an area of more than 200 mm \u00b2 \nshall be sorted as unfit. Both the obverse and the reverse of the note shall be checked \nfor stains.  \n(vii) Graffiti \nGraffiti refers to deliberate graphic alteration of the note with for example, figures or \nletters.

General \n1.1 The role  of primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) in providing housing finance has \nbeen reviewed from time to time. These banks, with their vast network, occupy a very strategic \nposition in the financial system and have an important role to play in providing c redit to the \nhousing sector. Further, housing finance to specified categories up to prescribed limits is \ntreated as priority sector lending, and the need for UCBs providing credit to priority sector has \ncome to be increasingly recognised consistent with the social objectives placed before the \nbanking system.  \n1.2 Therefore, with a view to enabling the UCBs to play a more positive role in providing \nfinance for housing schemes, particularly to the weaker sections of the community, these \nbanks are permitted to grant loans for housing schemes up to certain limits from their own \nresources subject to the guidelines detailed hereunder. \n1.3 Bigger banks that have large surplus resources may undertake larger lending for housing, \nas this will provide a remunerative avenue for investment of their surplus funds.  \n1.4 Wherever banks are still required to obtain special permission of the Registrar for financing \nhousing societies, it is suggested that these banks should obtain general permission to finance \nhousing societies s ubject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed for the purpose. \n2. Eligible Category of Borrowers \nUCBs may grant loans to the following categories of borrowers: \n(a) Individuals and co-operative / group housing societies.  \n(b) Housing boards undertaking housing projects or schemes for economically weaker \nsections (EWS), low income groups (LIG) and middle income groups (MIG).  \n(c) Owners of houses / flats for extension and up-gradation, including major repairs.  \n3. Eligibility for  Housing Finance \nThe borrowers in the above categories will be eligible for finance for the following types of \nhousing schemes: \n(a) Construction / purchase of houses / flats by individuals  \n(b) Repairs, alterations and additions to houses / flats by individuals  \n(c) Schemes for housing and hostels for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes  \n(d) Under slum clearance schemes - directly to the slum dwellers on the guarantee of the \nGovernment, or indirectly through Statutory Boards established for this purpose \n(e) Education, health, social, cultural or other institutions / centres which are part of a housing \nproject and considered necessary for the development of settlements or townships  \n(f) Shopping centres, markets and such other centres catering to the day to day  needs of the \nresidents of the housing colonies and forming part of a housing project  \n4. Terms and Conditions for Housing Loans \nFinance provided by the UCBs to the eligible categories of borrowers for eligible housing \nschemes will be subject to the followi ng terms and conditions: \n4.1 Maximum Loan Amount & Margins \n(i) UCBs, based on their commercial judgment and other prudential business considerations, \nwith the approval of their Board of Directors, are free to identify the eligible borrowers, decide \nmargins  and grant housing loans depending upon the repaying capacity of borrowers. (ii) Tier -I UCBs are permitted to extend individual housing loans upto a maximum of \u20b960 lakh \nper individual borrower  and Tier II UCBs (UCBs other than Tier I) can extend individual  \nhousing loans up to a maximum of \u20b9140.00 lakh per individual borrower  subject to extant \nprudential exposure limits. \n(iii)  The prudential exposure limits for UCBs for a single borrower/party and a group of \nconnected borrowers/parties shall be  15 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, of their tier -I \ncapital.  \n* Tier I UCBs are categorised as under: \n- Banks having deposits below \u20b9100 crore operating in a single district  \n- Banks with deposits below \u20b9100 crore operating in more than one district will be treated as \nTier I provided the branches are in contiguous districts and deposits and advances of branches \nin one district separately constitute at least 95% of the total deposits and advances \nrespectively of the bank and \n- Banks with deposits below \u20b9100 crore, whose branches were originally in a single district but \nsubsequently, became multi -district due to reorganization of the district  \nDeposits and advances as referred to in the above definition may be reckoned as on 31st \nMarch of the immediate preceding financial year. \n4.2 A. Interest  \nBanks may, with the approval of their Boards, determine the rate of interest, keeping in view \nthe size of accommodation, degree of risk and other relevant considerations. \nB. Foreclosure Charges / Prepayment Penalty  \nWith effect f rom June 26, 2012 it has been decided that UCBs will not be permitted to charge \nforeclosure charges / prepayment penalties in home loans extended on floating interest rate \nbasis.  \n4.3 Charging of Penal Interest  \nBanks may formulate, with the approval of thei r Boards, transparent policy for charging penal \ninterest rates to be levied for reasons such as default in repayment, non-submission of \nfinancial statements, etc. The policy should be governed by well accepted principles of \ntransparency, fairness, incentiv e to service the debt and due regard to genuine difficulties of \ncustomers.  \n4.4 Security \n(i) UCBs may secure housing loans either  \n(a) by mortgage of property, or  \n(b) by government guarantee where forthcoming, or  \n(c) by both. \n(ii) Where this is not feasible, banks may accept security of adequate value in the form of LIC \npolicies, Government Promissory Notes, shares / debentures, gold ornaments or such other \nsecurity as they deem appropriate.  \n4.5 Period of Loan \n(i) Housing loans may be repayable within a maxim um period of 20 years, including \nmoratorium or repayment holiday. \n(ii) The moratorium or repayment holiday may be granted (a) at the option of the beneficiary, or  \n(b) till completion of constructions, or 18 months from the date of disbursement of first \ninstalment of the loan, whichever is earlier.  \n4.6 Graduated Instalments \n(i) The instalments should be fixed on a realistic basis taking into account the repaying \ncapacity of the borrower. \n(ii) In order to make housing finance affordable, banks may consider fixing the instalments on \na graduated basis, if there is reasonable expectation of growth in the income of the borrower \nin the coming years. Graduated basis means fixing lower repayment instalments in the initial \nyears and gradually increasing the instalment amount in subsequent years coinciding with \nexpected increase in income in subsequent years. \n4.7 Aggregate Limit for Housing Finance \n4.7.1 The exposure of UCBs to housing, real estate and commercial real estate loans would \nbe limited to 10 per cent of their total assets. The above ceiling of 10 per cent of total assets \ncan be exceeded by an additional limit of 5 per cent of total assets for the purpose of grant of \nhousing loans to individuals  as per the eligibility limits  for priority sector classification , as \ncontained in Master Direction FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.5/04.09.01/2020-21 dated September 04, \n2020 , am ended from time to time.  \n4.7.2 The total assets may be reckoned based on the audited balance sheet as on March 31 \nof the preceding financial year. For reckoning total assets, losses, intangible assets, contra \nitems like bills receivables etc. would be excluded. \n4.7.3 The exposure should take into account both fund based and non-fund based facilities.  \n4.7.4 Working capital loans given by UCBs against hypothecation of construction materials \nprovided to the contractors who undertake comparatively small construction on their own \nwithout receiving advance payments as provided for in paragraph 7 of this circular is exempted \nfrom the prescribed limit. \n4.7.5 Finance extended to the eligible category of borrowers mentioned in paragraph 2 above \nwill only be eligible to be treated as housing finance. While the purpose of the loan shall \ndetermine whether the loans granted against the security of immovable property need to be \nclassified as real estate loans, the source of repayment will determine whether the exposure \nis against commercial real estate. For classification of such loans as Real Estate / Commercial \nReal Estate, UCBs may be guided by the instructions contained in Annex 1 . As loans to the \nresidential housing projects under the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Sector exhibit lesser risk and volatility than the CRE Sector taken as a whole, a separate sub-sector called \n\u2018Commercial Real Estate\u2013 Residential Housing\u2019 (CRE -RH)  has been carved out from the CRE \nSector. CRE -RH would consist of loans to builders/developers for residential housing projects \n(except for captive consumption) under CRE segment. Such projects should ordinarily not \ninclude non -residential commercial real estate. However, integrated housing projects \ncomprising some commercial space (e.g. shopping complex, school, etc.) can also be \nclassified under CR E-RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project \ndoes not exceed 10% of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10%, \nthe project loans should be classified as CRE and not CRE -RH. \n4.7.6 UCBs shall not  exceed the limit prescribed for grant of housing, real estate, commercial \nreal estate loans  even for the funds obtained from higher financing agencies and refinance  \nfrom National Housing Bank. \n 5. Additional / Supplementary Finance \n5.1 UCBs may extend additional finance to carry out alterations, additions, repairs to houses \n/ flats already financed by them, subject to, repayment capacity of borrowers. \n5.2 In the case of individuals who might have raised funds for construction / acquisition of \naccommodation from other sources and need supplementary finance, banks may extend \ncredit after obtaining pari passu  or second mortgage charge over the property mor tgaged in \nfavour of other lenders and / or against such other security as they may deem appropriate after due assessment of aggregate repayment capacity of borrowers. \n5.3 UCBs may  extend need-based credit up to a maximum of \u20b910 lakh in metropolitan centres \nand up to \u20b9 6 lakh in other centres  for repairs /additions /alterations, irrespective of whether the \nhouse / flat is owner occupied or tenant occupied, after obtaining such security as the banks may deem appropriate. The bank s shall satisfy themselves regar ding the estimated cost of \nrepairs, additions, etc. having regard to the extent of such repairs or additions, materials to be \nused, cost of labour and other charges and after obtaining certificate/s from qualified engineers \n/ architects in respect thereof, considered necessary. \n5.4 The terms and conditions relating to margin, interest rates, repayment period etc. in \nrespect of additional / supplementary finance may be same as indicated in respect of loans \nfor construction / acquisition. \n6. Lending to Housing Boards  \n6.1 UCBs may extend loans to housing boards within their States. The rate of interest to be \ncharged on the loans to such boards may be fixed at the discretion of the banks.  \n6.2 While extending loans to housing boards, banks may not only keep in vi ew the past \nperformance of the housing boards in the matter of recovery from the beneficiaries but should \nalso stipulate that the boards will ensure prompt and regular recovery of loan instalments from \nthe beneficiaries.  \n7. Advances to Builders / Contractors  \n7.1 Builders / contractors generally require huge funds, take advance payments from the \nprospective buyers or from those on whose behalf construction is undertaken and, therefore, \nmay not normally require bank finance for the purpose. Any financial assistance extended to \nthem by primary (urban) co-operative banks may result in dual financing. Banks should, \ntherefore, normally refrain from sanctioning loans and advances to this category of borrowers. \n7.2 However, where contractors undertake comparativ ely small construction work on their \nown, (i.e. when no advance payments are received by them for the purpose), banks may \nconsider extending financial assistance to them against the hypothecation of construction \nmaterials, provided such loans and advances are in accordance with the bye laws of the bank \nand instructions / directives issued by the Reserve Bank from time to time.  \n7.3 Banks should undertake a proper scrutiny of the relevant loan applications, and satisfy themselves, among other things, about the genuineness of the purpose, the quantum of \nfinancial assistance required, creditworthiness of the borrower, repayment capacity, etc. and \nalso observe the usual safeguards, such as, obtaining periodic stock statements, carrying out \nperiodic inspections, d etermining drawing power strictly on the basis of the stock held, \nmaintaining a margin of not less than 40 to 50 percent, etc. They should also ensure that \nmaterials used up in the construction work are not included in the stock statements for the \npurpose of determining the drawing power. \n7.4 Valuation of land:  It has been observed that while financing builders / contractors, certain \nbanks valued the land for the purpose of security, on the basis of the discounted value of the property after it is developed, less the cost of development. This is not in conformity with \nestablished norms. In this connection, it is clarified that UCBs should not extend fund based / \nnon-fund based facilities to builders / contractors for acquisition of land even as a part of a \nhousing project. Further, wherever land is accepted as collateral, valuation of such land should \nbe at the current market price only. \n7.5 UCBs may also take collateral security, wherever available. As construction work \nprogresses, contractors will get paid and such payments should be applied to reduce the \nbalance in the borrowal accounts. If possible, banks could perhaps enter into a tripartite \nagreement with the borrower and his clients, particularly when no collateral securities are \navailable for such advances.  \n7.6 It has been observed that some banks have introduced certain innovative Housing Loan \nSchemes in association with developers / builders, e.g. upfront disbursal of sanctioned \nindividual housing loans to builders without linking the disbursals to various stages of \nconstruction of housing project, interest / EMI on the housing loan availed of by the individual \nborrower being serviced by the builders during the construction period / specified period, etc. \nIn view of the higher risks associated with such lump-sum disbursal of sanctioned housing \nloans and customer suitability issues, UCBs are advised that disbursal of housing loans \nsanctioned to individuals should be closely linked to the stages of construction of the housing \nproject / houses and upfront disbursal should not be made in cases of incomplete / under -\nconstruction / green field housing projects.  \n8. Housing Loans under Priority Sector  \n8.1 Instructions on loans to Housing sector eligible for priority sector classification shall be as \nper Master Directions \u2013 Priority Sector Lending (PSL) \u2013 Targets and \nClassification  FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.5/04.09.01/2020-21 dated September 4, 2020 , as amended \nfrom time to time. \n9. Precautions \n9.1 A number of cases have come to the notice of Reserve Bank, where unscrupulous persons \nhave defrauded the banks by obtaining multiple bank finance against the same property by \npreparing a number of sets of the original documents and submitting the same to various \nbanks for obtaining housing finance. Similarly,  the salary certificates of employees of certain \npublic sector undertakings were fabricated, so as to match the requirement of banks for availing higher amounts of loan. The estimates given were also on the higher side, so as to \navoid contribution of margin money by the borrowers. \nSuch frauds could take place on account of laxity on the part of the bank officials to follow the \nlaid down procedures for verifying the genuineness of the documents submitted by borrowers \nindependently through their own advocates / solicitors. Banks should, therefore, take due \nprecaution while accepting various documents. \n9.2 Banks shall  satisfy themselves that loans extended by them are not for unauthorized \nconstruction or for misuse of properties / encroachment on public land. For this purpose, they \nshould ensure strict compliance with the procedure laid down in Annex 2\n. \n9.3 In a case which came up before the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay, the \nHon'ble Court observed that the bank granting finance to housing / development projects \nshould insist on disclosure of the charge / or any other liability on the plot, in the brochure, \npamphlets etc., which may be published by developer / owner inviting public at large to \npurchase flats and properties. The Court also added that this obviously would be part of the \nterms and conditions on which the loan may be sanctioned by the bank. Keeping in view the \nabove observations, while granting finance for eligible housing schemes, UCBs are advised \nto stipulate as part of terms and conditions that:  (a) The builder / developer shall disclose in the pamphlets / brochures etc., the name(s) of the \nbank(s) to which the property is mortgaged. \n(b) The builder / developer would append the information relating to mortgage while \nadvertising for a particular scheme in newspapers / magazines etc. (c) The builder / developer would indicate in the pamphlets / brochures that he would provide \nNo Objection Certificate (NOC) / permission of the mortgagee bank for sale of flats / property , \nif required. UCBs are  advised to ensure compliance of the above terms and conditions. Funds \nshould not be released unless the builder / developer fulfils  the above requirements . \n10. National Building Code \nThe Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) formulates  comprehensive building Code namely \nNational Building Code (NBC) of India providing guidelines for regulating the building \nconstruction activities across the country. The Code, updated from time to time contains all \nthe important aspects relevant to safe and orderly building development such as administrative regulations, development control rules and general building requirements; fire safety \nrequirements; stipulations regarding materials, structural design and construction (including \nsafety); and building and plumbing services . Adherence to NBC will be advisable in view of \nthe importance of safety of buildings especially against natural disasters. Banks' boards may consider this aspect for incorporation in their loan policies. Further information regarding the \nNBC can be accessed from the website of Bureau of Indian Standards ( http://www.bis.gov.in/\n). \n \n \n      \n \n     \n \n      \nAnnex \u2013 1 \nDefinition of Commercial Real Estate Exposure (CRE)  \n(vide paragraph 4.7.5)  \nReal Estate is generally defined as an immovable asset - land (earth space) and the \npermanently attached improvements to it. Income-producing real estate (IPRE) is defined in \npara 226 of the B asel II Framework as under:  \n\"Income-producing real estate (IPRE) refers to a method of providing funding to real estate \n(such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or \nwarehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the \nexposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset. The \nborrower may be, but is not required to be, an SPE (Special Purpose Entity), an operating \ncompany focused on real estate construction or holdings, or an operating company with \nsources of revenue other than real estate. The distinguishing characteristic of IPRE versus \nother corporate ex posures that are collateralised by real estate is the strong positive \ncorrelation between the prospects for repayment of the exposure and the prospects for recovery in the event of default, with both depending primarily on the cash flows generated by \na property\". \n2. The Income Producing Real Estate (IPRE) is synonymous with Commercial Real Estate \n(CRE). From the definition of IPRE given above, it may be seen that for an exposure to be \nclassified as IPRE / CRE, the essential feature would be that the funding will result in the \ncreation / acquisition of real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for \nrepayment would depend primarily on the cash fl ows generated by the asset. Additionally, the \nprospect of recovery in the event of default would also depend primarily on the cash flows \ngenerated from such funded asset which is taken as security, as would generally be the case. \nThe primary source of cash flow (i.e. more than 50% of cash flows) for repayment would \ngenerally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the assets as also for recovery in the event of default where such asset is taken as security. \n3. In certain cases where the exposure may not be directly linked to the creation or acquisition \nof CRE but the repayment would come from the cash flows generated by CRE. For example, \nexposures taken against existing commercial real estate whose prospects of repayments \nprimarily depend on rental / sale proceeds of the real estate should be classified as CRE. \nOther such cases may include; extension of guarantees on behalf of companies engaged in \ncommercial real estate activities, corporate loans extended to real estate companies etc.  \n4. It follows from the definition at para 2 and 3 above that if the repayment primarily depends \non other factors such as operating profit from business operations, quality of goods and \nservices, tourist arrivals etc., the exposure would not be counted as Commercial Real Estate.  \n5. UCBs should not extend finance for acquisition of land even if it is part of a project. However, \nfinance can be granted to individuals for purchase of a plot, provided a declaration is obtained \nfrom the borrower that he intends to construct a house on the said plot, within such period as \nmay be laid down by the banks themselves. \nSimultaneous Classification of CRE into other Regulatory Categories \n6. It is possible for an exposure to get classified simultaneously into more than one category, \nreal estate, CRE, infrastructure etc. as different classifications are driven by different \nconsiderations. In such cases, the exposure would be reckoned for regulatory / prudential exposure limit, if any, fixed by RBI or by the bank itself, for all the categories to which the \nexposure is assigned. For the purpose of capital adequacy, the largest of the risk weights \napplicable among all the categories would be applicable for the exposure. The rationale for \nsuch an approach is that, while at times certain classifications / categorizations could be driven \nby socio-economic considerations and may be aimed at encouraging flow of credit towards \ncertain activities, these exposures should be subjected to appropriate risk management / \nprudential / capital adequacy norms so as to address the risk inherent in them. Similarly, if an \nexposure has sensitivity to more than one risk factor it should be subjected to the risk \nmanagement framework applicable to all the relevant risk factors. \n7. In order to assist banks in determining as t o whether a particular exposure should be \nclassified as CRE or not, some examples based on the principles described above are given \nbelow. Based on the above principles and illustrations given, banks should be able to \ndetermine, whether an exposure not inc luded in the illustrative examples is a CRE or not and \nshould record a reasoned note justifying the classification.  \nIllustrative Examples \nA. Exposures which should be classified as CRE  \n1. Loans extended to builders for construction of any property which is  intended to be sold or \ngiven on lease (e.g. loans extended to builders for housing buildings, hotels, restaurants, \ngymnasiums, hospitals, condominiums, shopping malls, office blocks, theatres, amusement \nparks, cold storages, warehouses, educational institutions, industrial parks) In such cases, the \nsource of repayment in normal course would be the cash flows generated by the sale / lease \nrentals of the property. In case of default of the loan, the recovery will also be made from sale of the property if the exposure is secured by these assets as would generally be the case. \n2. Loans for Multiple Houses intended to be rented out \nThe housing loans extended in cases where houses are rented out need to be treated \ndifferently. If the total number of such units is  more than two, the exposure for the third unit \nonwards may be treated as CRE Exposure as the borrower may be renting these housing \nunits and the rental income would be the primary source of repayment.  \n3. Loans for integrated Township Projects  \nWhere the CR E is part of a big project which has small non-CRE component, it will be \nclassified as CRE exposure since the primary source of repayment for such exposures would \nbe the sale proceeds of buildings meant for sale. \n4. Exposures to Real Estate Companies  \nIn some cases exposure to real estate companies is not directly linked to the creation or \nacquisition of CRE, but the repayment would come from the cash flows generated by \nCommercial Real Estate. Such exposures illustratively could be : \n* Corporate Loans extended to these companies  \n* Investments made in the debt instruments of these companies  \n* Extension of guarantees on behalf of these companies  \n5. General Purpose loans where repayment is dependent on real estate prices  \nExposures intended to be repaid out of rentals / sale proceeds generated by the existing CRE \nowned by the borrower, where the finance may have been extended for a general purpose. \n \n B. Exposures which may not be classified as CRE  \n1. Exposures to entrepreneurs for acquiring real estate for the pur pose of their carrying on \nbusiness activities, which would be serviced out of the cash flows generated by those business \nactivities. The exposure could be secured by the real estate where the activity is carried out, \nas would generally be the case, or coul d even be unsecured. \na) Loans extended for construction of a cinema theatre, establishment of an amusement park, \nhotels and hospitals, cold storages, warehouses, educational institutions, running haircutting \nsaloons and beauty parlours, restaurant, gymnasi um etc. to those entrepreneurs who \nthemselves run these ventures would fall in this category. Such loans would generally be \nsecured by these properties.  \nFor instance, in the case of hotels and hospitals, the source of repayment in normal course \nwould be th e cash flows generated by the services rendered by the hotel and hospital. In the \ncase of a hotel, the cash flows would be mainly sensitive to the factors influencing the flow of tourism, not directly to the fluctuations in the real estate prices. In the c ase of a hospital, the \ncash flows in normal course would be sensitive to the quality of doctors and other diagnostic services provided by the hospital. In these cases, the source of repayment might also depend \nto some extent upon the real estate prices to the extent the fluctuation in prices influence the \nroom rents, but it will be a minor factor in determining the overall cash flows. In these cases, \nhowever, the recovery in case of default, if the exposure is secured by the Commercial Real \nEstate, would depend upon the sale price of the hotel / hospital as well as upon the \nmaintenance and quality of equipment and furnishings.  \nThe above principle will also be applicable in the cases where the developers / owners of the \nreal estate assets (hotels, hospitals, warehouses, etc.) lease out the assets on revenue \nsharing or profit sharing arrangement and the repayment of exposure depends upon the cash flows generated by the services rendered, instead of fixed lease rentals. \nb) Loans extended to entrepreneurs, for setting up industrial units will also fall in this category. \nIn such cases, the repayment would be made from the cash flows generated by the industrial \nunit from sale of the material produced which would mainly depend upon demand and supply \nfactors. The recovery in case of default may partly depend upon the sale of land and building \nif secured by these assets.  \nThus, it may be seen that in these cases the real estate prices do not affect repayment though \nrecovery of the loan could partly be from sale of real estate.  \n2. Loans extended to a company for a specific purpose, not linked to a real estate activity, which is engaged in mixed activities including real estate activity.  \nFor instance, a company has two divisions. One division is engaged in real estate activ ity, and \nother division is engaged in power production. An infrastructure loan, for setting up of a power \nplant extended to such a company, to be repaid by the sale of electricity would not be classified \nas CRE. The exposure may or may not be secured by pl ant and machinery.  \n3. Loans extended against the Security of future rent receivables  \nA few banks have formulated schemes where the owners of existing real estate such as \nshopping malls, office premises, etc. have been offered finance to be repaid out of the rentals \ngenerated by these properties. Even though such exposures do not result in funding / \nacquisition of commercial real estate, the repayment might be sensitive to fall in real estate \nrentals and such exposures should be classified as CRE. However, i f there are certain in built \nsafety conditions which have the effect of delinking the repayments from real estate price \nvolatility like, the lease rental agreement between the lessor and lessee has a lock in period \nwhich is not shorter than the tenor of loan and there is no clause which allows a downward revision in the rentals during the period covered by the loan banks can classify such exposures \nas non CRE. Banks may, however, record a reasoned note in all such cases. \n4. Credit facilities provided to construction companies which work as Contractors  \nThe working capital facilities extended to construction companies working as contractors, \nrather than builders, will not be treated as CRE exposures because the repayment would \ndepend upon the contractual payments received in accordance with the progress in \ncompletion of work. \n5. Financing of acquisition / renovation of self-owned office / company premises  \nSuch exposures will not be treated as CRE exposures because the repayment will come from \ncompany revenues. The exposures to industrial units towards setting up of units or projects \nand working capital requirement, etc. would not be treated as CRE Exposures. \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAnnex - 2 \nDirection of t he Hon'ble High Court of Delhi  \nProcedure for ensuring the loan sought is for authorised structure  \n(vide paragraph 9.2)  \nA. Housing Loan for Building Construction \ni) In cases where the applicant owns a plot / land and approaches the banks / FIs for a credit \nfacility to construct a house, a copy of the sanctioned plan by competent authority in the name \nof a person applying for such credit facility must be obtained by the Banks / FIs before \nsanctioning the home loan. \nii) An affidavit-cum -undertaking must be obtained from the person applying for such credit \nfacilit y that he shall not violate the sanctioned plan, construction shall be strictly as per the \nsanctioned plan and it shall be the sole responsibility of the executant to obtain completion \ncertificate within 3 months of completion of construction, failing whic h the bank shall have the \npower and the authority to recall the entire loan with interest, costs and other usual bank \ncharges.  \niii) An Architect appointed by the bank must also certify at various stages of construction of \nbuilding that the construction of the building is strictly as per sanctioned plan and shall also \ncertify at a particular point of time that the completion certificate of the building issued by the \ncompetent authority has been obtained. \nB. Housing Loan for Purchase of Constructed Property / Built up Property  \ni) In cases where the applicant approaches the bank / FIs for a credit facility to purchase a \nbuilt up house / flat, it should be mandatory for him to declare by way of an affidavit-cum -\nundertaking that the built up property has been constructed as per the sanctioned plan and / \nor building bye-laws and as far as possible has a completion certificate also. \nii) An Architect appointed by the bank must also certify before disbursement of the loan that \nthe built up property is strictly as per sanctioned plan and / or building bye-laws.  \nC. No loan should be given in respect of those properties which fall in the category of \nunauthorized colonies unless and until they have been regularized and development and other \ncharges paid. \nD. No loan should be given in respect of properties meant for residential use but which the \napplicant intends to use for commercial purposes and declares so while applying for loan. \nE. The above directions will not be applicable to construction of farmhouses on agricultural  \nland since the agricultural land is outside the limit of Grampanchayats and Municipal Councils \nand as these authorities neither sanction plans nor issue completion certificates for \nfarmhouses constructed by the farmers on the agricultural land. In all suc h cases, local rules \nwill apply.  \n \n  \n \n  \nAppendix \nA.

In terms of circular DOR.(PCB).BPD.Cir.No.11/16.20.000/2019- 20 dated April 20, \n2020,  Primary (Urban) Co -operative Banks ( UCBs ) were advised that t he interbank \nexposures arising from deposits placed by UCBs with a UCB under All -inclusive \nDirections (AID) and their non- performing exposures arising from discounted bills \ndrawn under LCs issued by a UCB under AID shall be fully provided within five years  \nat the rate of 20 per cent annually . Further,  if UCBs choose to convert such deposits \ninto long term perpetual debt instruments (e.g. Innovative Perpetual Debt Instrument - \nIPDI) which may be recognised as capital instrument under a scheme of restructurin g \n/ revival of a UCB under AID, provision on the portion of deposits converted into such \ninstruments shall not be required.  \n3. The Scheme has provided for conver sion of the outstanding uninsured deposits \n(which  includes the interest accrued till March 31, 2021)  to the credit of the institutional \ndepositors into Perpetual Non- Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) and Equity \nWarrants of the Unity Small Finance Bank (USFB) as on appointed date. However, it is \nobserv ed that  the actual receipt of PNCPS and Equity Warrants in the account of \ninstitutional depositors is yet to take place. In this connection, it is clarified that  UCBs  \n \n   \n2 \n shall continue to make provisions on inter-bank exposures arising from outstanding \nuninsured deposits , as per circular dated April 20, 2020 ibid until the actual allotment  \nof PNCPS / Equity Warrants . After the allotment of PNCPS / Equity Warrants, the \nprovisions made on exposures arising from deposits shall be reversed only if such \nprovisions are in excess of loss, if any, due to treatment of PNCPS and Equity Warrants  \n(provided in paragraph 4 and 5  below) . \n4. Equity Warrants shall be valued at a price of \u20b91 per warrant. As and when the equity \nwarrants are converted into equity shares, the valua tion shall be done on market \ndetermined prices.  Thus, at present, no provisions need to be made on investment in \nEquity Warrants.  \n5. UCBs shall fully provide for their investments in PNCPS. UCBs are allowed to spread \nthe provisions for their investments in PNCPS, net of extant provisions made on \nexposures arising from outstanding uninsured deposits , equally over two financial years \nsuch that the entire loss is  fully provided for by March 31, 2024.  \n6. Further, these PNCPS and Equity Warrants shall be classi fied as Non- SLR \ninvestments and shall be exempt from the limits prescribed in p aragraph 12.1.2(a)  and \n12.1.2(b) of the Master Circular on Investments by Primary (Urban) Co- operative Banks  \ndated April 1, 2022.  \nApplicability  \n7.

In case the FSI \nof the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceed the \nceiling of 10 per cent, the entire loan should be cl assified as CRE and not CRE -RH. \nd) Housing loans extended at teaser rates shall mean housing loans having \ncomparatively lower rates of interest in the first few years after which the rates of \ninterest are reset at higher rates.  e) Current credit exposure is defined as the sum of the gross positive mark -to-market \nvalue of all derivative contracts with respect to a single counterparty , without adjusting  \nagainst any negative marked-to-market values of contracts with the same \ncounterparty .  \n6.

In terms of para 3.2.3  (h) of the  said circular , in order to address issues arising \nout of excessive risk taki ng caused by misaligned compensation packages, NBFCs \nare required to put in place a Board approved compensation policy. The policy  shall \nat the minimum include, (a) constitution of a Remuneration Committee, (b) principles \nfor fixed/ variable pay  structures, and (c) malus/ clawback provisions. Further, in terms \nof para 3.2.3 (i) it was also decided that the Board of NBFCs sh ould delineate the role \nof various committees, including Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC). It was envisaged that detailed circulars will be issued in due course by the Reserve Bank. Accordingly, these guidelines have now been framed and furnished in Annex .  \n \n2. The guidelines are intended only for providing broad guidance to NBFCs and their \nNRCs  in formulating  their compensation polic y. While formulating the compensation \npolicy, it has to be ensured that all statutory mandates and the rules and directions \nissued under them are fully complied with.  \n \n     \n2 \n  \n 3. These guidelines will be applicable for fixing the compensation policy of  Key \nManagerial Personnel\n1 and members of senior management2 of all Non-Banking \nFinancial Companies  under SBR framework , except those categorised under \u2018Base \nLayer\u20193 and Government owned NBFCs.  \n \n4.

Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC)  \n  \nThe Boards of all applicable NBFCs shall constitute a Nomination and Remuneration \nCommittee (NRC). The NRC shall have the constitution, powers, functions and duties \nas laid down in section 178 of the Companies Act, 2013. The NRC , inter alia,  shall \nalso have the mandate to oversee the framing, review and implementation of \ncompensation policy of the company which should have the approval of the board.  \nThe NRC may  work in close coordination with Risk Management Committee (RMC) of \nthe company to achieve effective alignment between compensation and risks. Further, \nthe NRC may  ensure that compensation levels are supported by the need to retain \nearnings of the company a nd the need to maintain adequate capital  based on Internal \nCapital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) . NRC may  also ensure \u2018fit and proper\u2019 \nstatus of proposed/existing directors  and that  there is no conflict of interest in \nappointment of d irectors on Board of the company, KMPs and senior management . \n \n2. Principles for compensation \n \n2.1 Components and risk alignment:  The compensation of Key Managerial \nPersonnel (KMPs)  and senior management needs to be reasonable, recognising all \nrelevant factors including adherence to statutory requirements and industry practices.  \nThe compensation packages may comprise of fixed and variable pay components  \naligned effectively with prudent risk taking to ensure that compensation is adjusted for \nall types of risks, t he compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes , \ncompensation pay -outs are sensitive to the time horizon of the risks, and the mix of \ncash, equity and other forms of compensation are consistent with risk alignment .  \n \n2.2 Composition of Fixed Pay: All the fixed items of compensation, including the \nperquisites and contributions towards superannuation/retiral benefits, may be treated \nas part of fixed pay. All perquisites that are reimbursable may  also be included in the \nfixed pay so long as there ar e monetary ceilings on these reimbursements. Monetary  \n4 \n equivalent of benefits of non- monetary nature (such as free furnished house, use of \ncompany car, etc.) may  also be part of fixed pay.  \n  \n2.3 Principles for Variable Pay  \n \n2.3.1 Composition of Variable Pay: The variable pay may  be in the form of share-\nlinked instruments, or a mix of cash and share- linked instruments. It shall be ensured \nthat the share- linked instruments are in conformity with relevant statutory provisions.  \n 2.3.2 Proportion: The proportion of variable pay in total compensation\n4 needs to  be \ncommensurate with the role and prudent risk taking profile of KMPs / senior \nmanagement . At higher levels of responsibility,  the proportion of variable pay needs \nto be higher. There should be proper balance between the cash and share- linked \ninstruments in the variable pay in case the variable pay contains share linked \ninstruments. The variable pay  should be truly and effectively variable and can be \nreduced to zero bas ed on performance at an individual, business -unit and company -\nwide level.  In order to do so, performance measures and their relation to remuneration \npackages should be clearly defined at the beginning of the performance measurement \nperiod to ensure that the employees perceive the incentive mechanism.  \n \n2.3.3 Deferral of variable pay: Not all the variable pay awarded after performance \nassessment may be paid immediately. Certain portion of variable pay, as decided by \nthe Board of the company, may be deferred  to time horizon of the risks. The portion of \ndeferral arrangement may be made applicable for both cash and non- cash \ncomponents of the variable pay. Deferral period for such an arrangement may be \ndecided by the Board of the company.  \n2.3.4 Control and assur ance function personnel:  KMPs and senior management \nengaged in financial control, risk management, compliance and internal audit may  be \ncompensated in a manner that is independent of the business areas they oversee and \ncommensurate with their key role in the company. Accordingly, such personnel may \nhave higher proportion of fixed compensation. However, a reasonable proportion of \ncompens ation may be in the form of variable pay, so that exercising the options of \nmalus and/or clawback, when warranted, is not rendered infructuous.  \n \n                                                            \n4 Total compensation includes fixed and variable pay   \n5 \n  \n3. Guaranteed bonus  \n \nGuaranteed bonus may  not be paid to KMPs and senior  management . However, in \nthe context of new hiring joining/sign- on bonus could be considered. Such bonus will \nneither be considered part of fixed pay nor of variable pay . \n \n4. Malus / Clawback \n \nThe deferred compensation may  be subject to malus5/clawback6 arrangements in the \nevent of subdued or negative financial performance of the company and/or the \nrelevant line of business  or employee misconduct in any year.  A representative set of \nsituations may be identified by the NBFC, which require them to invoke the malus and \nclawback clauses that may be applicable on entire variable pay. While setting criteria \nfor the application of malus and clawback, NBFCs may also specify a period during which malus and/or clawback can be applied, covering at least  the deferral and \nretention periods\n7. \n \n \n***** \n                                                            \n5 A malus arrangement permits the NBFC to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a def erred remuneration. \nMalus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred.   \n6 A clawback is a contractual agreement between the employee and the NBFC in which the employee agrees to \nreturn previously paid or vested remuneration to the N BFC under certain circumstances.   \n7 Retention period : A period of time after the vesting of instruments which have been awarded as variable pay \nduring which they cannot be sold or accessed.

In this regard, it is advised that Government of India has approved the continuation of \nthe Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS)  with modifications for the financial year 2021- 22 \nwith the following stipulations:   \n \n(i) In order to provi de short  term crop loans and short term loans for allied activities \nincluding animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc.  upto an overall limit \nof \u20b93 lakh to farmers through KCC  at concessional interest rate during the year \n2021- 22, it has been decided to provide interest subvention of 2% per annum to \n \n lending institutions viz. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and  Private Sector Banks (in \nrespect of loans given by their rural and semi -urban branches only) , Small \nFinance Banks  (SFBs)  and computerized Primary Agriculture  Cooperative \nSocieties (PACS) which have been ceded with Scheduled Commercial Banks \n(SCBs) , on use of their own resources . This i nterest subvention of 2% per annum \nwill be calculated on the loan amount from the date of disbursement /drawal up to \nthe date of actual repayment of the loan by the farmer or up to the due date of the \nloan fixed by the banks , whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one \nyear.  The applicable lending rate to farmers and the rate of interest subvention \nfor the financial year 2021- 22 will be as follows:  \nFinancial \nYear Lending rate to farmers  Rate for Interest \nSubventio n \n2021 -22 7% 2% \n \n(ii) An additional interest subvention of  3% per annum  will be provided to such of \nthose farmers repaying in time,  i.e., from the date of disbursement of the  loan/ s \nupto the actual date of repayment or upto the due date fixed by the bank s for \nrepayment of such l oan/s, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of \none year from the date of disbursement.

(Illustrations ) \n  \n (iv) In order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store \ntheir produce in warehouses, the benefit of i nterest subvention under KCC will be \navailable to small and marginal farmers for a further period of upto six months \npost the harvest of the crop against negotiable warehouse receipts on the produce stored in warehouse s accredited with Warehousing Development Regulatory \nAuthority (WDRA), at the same rate as applicable to the agri . loan.  \n \n(v) With a view t o providing  relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, the \ninterest subvention of 2% per annum  will be made available to banks as stated in \nthe table given in para 2(i) above, for the first year on the restructured loan \namount.

Further, in \nall such cases, the benefit of p rompt repayment incentive @ 3% per annum shall \nalso be provided to t he affected farmers. The grant of such benefits in cases of \nsevere natural calamities shall, however, be decided by a High Level Committee (HLC) based on the recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Central Team \n(IMCT) and Sub Committee of National Executi ve Committee (SC -NEC).  \n \n(vii) To ensure hassle- free benefits to farmers under the ISS, Aadhar linkage would \ncontinue to be mandatory for availing the above mentioned short term loans in \n2021- 22. \n \n(viii) All the above mentioned short term loans processed in 2021- 22 are required to \nbe brought on the ISS portal / DBT platform.

Interest \nis calculated at a rate of 2% per month. Therefore, if the tot al outstanding is not paid on or \nbefore the due date, it would require payment of interest of \u20b9200 (2% of 10,000) a long with \ntax and  other charges of \u20b950 (indicative figure) totalling to \u20b9250 in addition to the outstanding.  \n2. The M AD for the month A shall be calculated in a way that it does not result in negative \namortization. Accordingly, the M AD shall not be less than \u20b9250 (indicative figure ), so as to \navoid capitalisation of interest or other charges in the subsequent statement.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Master Directions \u2013 Credit Card and Debit Card \u2013 Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022  \n \n29 \n Append ix \nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  \nMaster Direction (MD) - Credit Card and Debit Card \u2013 Issuance and Conduct \nDirections, 2022  \nQuery 1. What should a customer do if a credit card is issued without his/her consent \n(unsolicited card)?  \nResponse: Card issuers  are prohibited from issuing unsolicited credit cards and are required \nto seek prior and explicit consent from the customer before issuing a card. However, if the \ncustomer receives an unsolicited card, he/she should refrain from activating or providing \nconsent for activation of card through OTP or any other means. If no consent is received for \nactivating the card, the card -issuer is required to close the credit card account without any \ncost to the customer within seven working days from the date of seeking confirmation from \nthe customer and shall also intimate the customer that the credit card account has been \nclosed. Subsequent to receiving the intimation from the card -issuer that the card account has \nbeen closed, the customer shall destroy the card. Furthe r, the customer may file a complaint \nwith the card -issuer against the issuance of unsolicited card and escalate it to the RBI \nOmbudsman as per Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (please refer to the response of query \n17 below ). \nQuery 2.  Can a card be issued to ot her loan accounts such as overdraft facility, cash \ncredit facility, working capital loan, etc.?  \nResponse: Yes, paragraphs 7(b) and 7(c) of the MD have enabled issuance of various types \nof credit cards which can be customized to access the limits available in different loan \naccounts, duly aligned to the terms and conditions stipulated for the concerned loan account. \nFor example, a customer availing an overdraft facility from a bank can be issued a type of \ncredit card to access the funds available under the f acility. The terms of usage of this credit \ncard (interest charged, repayment schedule, penalty, cash withdrawal limit etc.,) shall \ncorrespond to the terms and conditions applicable to the overdraft facility.  \nFurther, para 7(c) provides adequate flexibility  to the card -issuers to design Business Credit \nCards as envisaged in their Credit Card policy. However, it may be noted that banks cannot \nissue debit cards to cash credit/loan accounts.  \n \n Master Directions \u2013 Credit Card and Debit Card \u2013 Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022  \n \n30 \n Query 3. What can be considered as activation of credit card?  \nRespon se: Customer -initiated process indicating intent to use a credit card such as PIN \ngeneration, modification of transaction control, Interactive Voice Response, recorded call to \nthe customer care centre and SMS may be considered as activation. However, if th e card is \nnot activated by the cardholder for more than 30 days from the date of issuance, card -issuers \nshall seek One Time Password (OTP) based consent in line with para 6(a)(vi) of the MD.  \nQuery 4. In reference to para 8(b) of the MD, can a credit card b e considered as \u2018used\u2019 \neven if no financial transactions have been undertaken?  \nResponse: In addition to financial transactions, any process initiated by the cardholder such \nas generation of statement, change of PIN, change in transaction controls, etc., sh all be \nconsidered for treating a card as \u2018used\u2019. However, any calls made to the customer care \ncentre, for reasons other than those cited above, shall not be considered towards usage of a \ncard.  \nQuery 5. Whether consent for activation and closure of a busine ss credit card can be \nobtained from the corporate/business entity instead of the cardholder?  \nResponse:  For business credit cards, wherein the cards have been issued based on the \napplication by a corporate or business entity, card -issuers shall seek explici t consent  as \nrequired under paragraph 6(a)(vi)/ send intimation as required under paragraph 8(b) \nrespectively from/ to the principal account holder (viz . corporate or business entity)  unless \nspecified otherwise in the agreement. Similarly, with regard to ret ail credit cards too, it is \nclarified that the requisite consent shall be sought from the principal cardholder and not from \nthe add -on cardholders.  \nHowever, for blocking of such credit cards, either the actual cardholder  or the principal \ncardholder can in itiate the request.  \nQuery 6.  In case a cardholder makes partial payment, can a card -issuer charge \ninterest/levy late payment charges on the total amount due?  \nResponse:  In case a cardholder does not clear the total amount due within the payment due \ndate, i nterest free credit period will be lost, and interest may be levied from the date of \ntransaction on the outstanding amount ( adjusted for payments/refunds/reversed transactions  \nas and when credited ) and not on the total amount due. Further, late payment fee  and other \ncharges relating to delay in payment shall be levied only on the outstanding amount  (adjusted Master Directions \u2013 Credit Card and Debit Card \u2013 Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022  \n \n31 \n for payments/refunds/reversed transactions  as and when credited ) after the payment due \ndate and not on the total amount due.  \nQuery 7.  Whether a credit card -issuer can levy interest on the unpaid \ntaxes/levies/charges?  \nResponse: No, card -issuers shall not capitalize i.e., levy interest or any other charges, on \nthe unpaid taxes/ levies/charges. As the provision contained under para 9(b)(ii) of the MD \nbecame  effective from October 01, 2022, card -issuers shall not capitalize unpaid \ntaxes/levies/charges that have been billed from October 01, 2022.  \nQuery 8. In reference to Para 10(g) and 10(h) of the MD, what are the transactions that \nare eligible (i) to be adjus ted towards the outstanding dues and (ii) credited to the bank \naccount of the cardholder?  \nResponse:  For a typical credit card with billing cycle from October 1, 2023 to October 30, \n2023, let\u2019s assume the  bill is generated on October 30 , 2023 and the due da te of payment is \nNovember 19, 2023. The different scenarios for adjustment of credit are detailed below:  \nScenario 1  \u2013 Credit of refund/failed/ reversed transaction within the same billing \ncycle  \no Purchase transaction date \u2013 \nOctober 15, 2023  \no Refund on Octob er 19, 2023 - \nFor cancellation of purchase \ndated October 15, 2023  As bill is yet to be generated in the given case, \nthe refund amount received on October 19, \n2023, shall be adjusted with other debits, prior \nto calculation of the Total Amount Due.  \nScenario  2 \u2013 Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post generation of bill \nbut before making payment of the dues  \no Purchase transaction date - \nOctober 29, 2023  \no Refund on November 04, 2023 \n- For cancellation of purchase \ndated October 29, 2023  \n The bill is ge nerated on October 30 , 2023, \nhowever, the payment towards the dues has not \nbeen made till the date of refund. Therefore, the \nrefund amount received on November 04, 2023, \nshall be adjusted towards the Total Amount Due \n(TAD) and accordingly the cardholder wi ll be \nrequired to pay only the remaining outstanding \n(Remaining outstanding = TAD \u2013 Refund \namount).  Master Directions \u2013 Credit Card and Debit Card \u2013 Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022  \n \n32 \n Scenario 3  \u2013 Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction for which payment \nhas already been made  \no Purchase transaction date - \nOctober 30, 2023  \no Payment to wards dues \u2013 \nNovember 06, 2023  \no Refund on November 07, 2023 \n- For cancellation of purchase \ndated October 30, 2023  \n As the cardholder has already cleared the dues, \ncard-issuers shall seek explicit consent of the \ncardholder to adjust the refund amount in line  \nwith the provision stipulated at Para 10(h) of the \nMD. \n\uf0d8 Case I - If the cardholder gives explicit \nconsent, then refund amount shall be \nadjusted.  \n\uf0d8 Case II - If the cardholder does not provide \nthe consent or no response is received for \nadjustment of the refun d, then the refund \namount will be credited to the bank \naccount of the cardholder in line with para \n10(h).  \nFurther, if the cardholder makes a request for \ncrediting the refund (transaction for which \npayment has already been made), the same \nshall be credited back to the bank account of \nthe cardholder irrespective of the cut off \ndefined under Para10(h).  \nNote: The card -issuers may put in place a suitable mechanism to prevent evergreening of \nthe credit facility.  \nQuery 9. Can a cardholder modify the billing cycl e of a credit card to any date? If yes, \nwhat options are available to the cardholder to carry out the modification?  \nResponse: The cardholder shall be provided option to choose a ny date as the starting or \nclosing day of the billing cycle at least once.

Can a card -issuer a llow a credit card to be used beyond the sanctioned \ncredit limit and charge overlimit fees?  \nResponse:  Usage of a credit card beyond the sanctioned credit limit (i.e., overlimit) requires \nprior explicit consent of the cardholder, as a fraud minimisation mec hanism. Further, a \ncardholder shall be given an option to enable or disable the option of overlimit through \ntransaction control mechanism available on card -issuer\u2019s platforms such as internet, mobile \nbanking, or any other suitable medium. Unless explicit c onsent has been obtained from the \ncardholder for the overlimit facility, no overlimit can either be provided or overlimit charges \nbe levied.  \nQuery 11.  Whether interest, taxes or any other charges can be considered for \ncomputing a cardholder's credit limit usage for the purpose of levying overlimit \ncharges?   \nResponse:  Interest or any charges/fees on the credit card shall not be factored in for the \npurpose of computing  a cardholder\u2019s credit limit usage and levying overlimit charges.  \nQuery 12.  Whether the liab ility towards credit card dues lies only with the principal \ncardholder?  \nResponse: Yes, the liability for dues shall rest solely with the principal cardholder and not \nwith the add -on cardholders. However, settlement of dues towards international credit card  \nshall also be governed as per FEMA regulations. Further, the responsibility for making \npayments in case of business credit cards shall be governed by the terms and conditions \nagreed upon .  \nQuery 13. Are card -issuers required to provide an insurance cover on debit and credit \ncards?  \nResponse: The Reserve Bank has not prescribed any requirement for insurance cover on \ndebit or credit cards. However, in case a card -issuer or a card payment network provides an \ninsurance cover, complimentary or chargeable (with the consent of the cardholder), the card -\nissuer shall ensure that the relevant nomination details are recorded by the Insurance \nCompany and the availability of insurance is included, along with other information, in every \nstatement. The information shall a lso include the details regarding the insurance cover, \nname/address and telephone number of the Insurance Company which will handle the claims \nrelating to the insurance cover. In case of group insurance policy, the contact details of the \nconcerned official s of the card -issuer shall be provided in the statements.  Master Directions \u2013 Credit Card and Debit Card \u2013 Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022  \n \n34 \n Query 14.  Whether a card -issuer can partner with more than one co -branding partner \nfor a card?  \nResponse: Yes.  \nQuery 15. Whether a co -branding partner acting as a business correspondent (BC), or \na technology service provider can be permitted to have access to the transaction data \nof the cardholder?  \nResponse: A co-branding partner (CBP)  acting as a BC or technology service provider for \nthe card -issuer shall abide by the rules as prescribed in the inst ructions issued by RBI for \nsuch activities. However, a CBP shall not have access to card transaction data irrespective \nof any other service offered by them to the card -issuer. For the purpose of customer \nconvenience, card transaction related data may be dr awn directly from the card -issuer\u2019s \nsystem in an encrypted form and displayed in the CBP\u2019s platform  with robust security . The \ninformation displayed through the CBP\u2019s platform shall be visible only to the cardholder and \nshall neither be accessed nor be stor ed by the CBP.   \nQuery 16. Whether deactivation/blocking of a credit card amounts to closure of the \ncard account?  \nResponse: No. De-activation/Blocking of a credit card temporarily curtails the ability of a \ncardholder to make any transaction in a credit ca rd account while still maintaining the \ncredit/account relationship with the card -issuer.  \nClosure of a credit card on the other hand amounts to termination of the account -based \nrelationship between the cardholder and the card -issuer. The request for closure  has to be \nhonoured within seven working days as stipulated in Para 8 of the MD. However, in case \npayment towards dues is outstanding, the card -issuer shall provide details regarding such \noutstanding dues to the cardholder upon receipt of the closure reque st without waiting for \ncompletion of the billing cycle and  accordingly advise him/her to make payment in order to \ncomplete the closure process. In such cases, the prescribed timeline of seven working days \nshall be calculated after excluding the number of days taken by the cardholder to clear the \noutstanding dues.  The card -issuer shall also report to CICs suitably about the closure of the \ncard account.  \nQuery 17. What is the procedure for filing a complaint against a card issuer?  \nResponse: For redressal of his/her grievance, the customer must first approach the \nconcerned card -issuer. If the card -issuer does not respond within a period of 30 days after Master Directions \u2013 Credit Card and Debit Card \u2013 Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022  \n \n35 \n filing of the complaint or rejects the complaint wholly/partly or if the customer is not satisfied \nwith the response/resolution given by the card -issuer, the customer can lodge his/her \ncomplaint with the Ombudsman, Reserve Bank through any of the following methods:  \ni.

While such positions /titles  may be indicative of certain privileges/rights  for the \nincumbent to access all board materials and participate in board/committee meetings, \nenforcing liability or obligations on such person may be difficult .

These instructions  set out to identify large exposures, \nrefine the criteria for grouping of connected counterparties and put in place \nreporting norms for large exposures.  \n \n2 Definitions  \n2.1 \u201cNBFC- UL\u201d m eans a n NBFC placed in the upper layer as per RBI  circular \nDOR.CRE.REC.No.60/03.10.001/2021- 22 dated October 22, 2021 on \u201cScale \nBased Regulation (SBR): A Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs\u201d . \n \n2.2 \u201cTier I Capital\u201d for the purpose of the guidelines shall have the same meaning as \ndefined in the Master Direction - Non-Banking Financial Company -  Systemically \nImportant Non- Deposit taking Company and Deposit taking Company (Reserve \nBank) Directions, 2016.  Further, profit s accrued during the year  will be reckoned \nas Tier I capital for the purpose of LEF  after making necessary adjustments as \nper the guidelines  applicable to NBFC -UL. The NBFC- UL shall obtain an external \nauditor\u2019s certificate on completion of the augmentation of capital and submit the \nsame to the Reserve Bank of India (Department of Supervision) before reckoning \nthe additions to capital funds.  \n \n2.3  \u201cEligible capital base\u201d means Tier 1 capital as defined at paragraph 2.2 above.  \n 2.4 \u201cControl\n1\u201d means  the right to appoint majority of the directors or to control the \nmanagement or policy decisions exercisable by a person or persons acting \nindividually or in concert, directly or indirectly, including by virtue of their shareholding or management rights or  shareholders \u2019 agreements or voting \nagreements or in any other manner.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Clause ( 27) of Secti on 2 of the Companies Act, 2013   \n 2 \n 2.5 \u201cGroup of connected counterparties\u201d means two or more (natural or legal ) \npersons who satisfy at least one of the following conditions:  \na) Control relationship: one person directly or indirectly, has control over \nthe other(s), or such persons are under the common control of a third party  (irrespective of whether the NBFC has exposure to the third \nparty or not). C ontrol relationship criteri a is automatically satisfied if \none entity owns more than 50 percent of the voting rights of the other entity ;  \nb) Economic interdependence:  In establishing connectedness based on \neconomic interdependence, NBFC -UL must consider, at a minimum, \nthe following criteria:  \n\u2022 Where 50% or more of one counterparty's gross receipts or gross \nexpenditure (on an annual basis) is derived from transactions with the \nother counterparty;  \n\u2022 Where one counterparty has fully or partly guaranteed the exposure of the other counterparty, or is liable by other means, and the exposure is so significant that the guarantor is likely to default if a claim occurs;  \n\u2022 Where a significant part of one counterparty\u2019s production/  output is \nsold to another counterparty, which cannot easily be replaced by other customers;  \n\u2022 When the expected source of funds to repay the loans of both counterparties is the same and neither counterparty has another independent source of income from which the loan may be serviced and fully repaid;  \n\u2022 Where it is likely that the financial problems of one counterparty would cause difficulties for the other counterparties in terms of full and timely repayment of liabilities;  \n\u2022 Where the insolvency or default of one counterparty is likely to be associated with the insolvency or default of the other(s);  \n\u2022 When two or more counterparties rely on the same source for the \nmajority of their funding and, in the event of the common provider\u2019s default, an alternative provider cannot be found -  in this case, the 3 \n funding problems of one counterparty are likely to spread to another \ndue to a one- way or two -way dependence on the same main funding \nsource.   \n\u2022 In order to avoid cases where a thorough investigation of economic interdependencies will not be proportionate to the size of the exposures, NBFC- UL are expected to identify possible connected \ncounterparties on the basis of economic interdependence in all cases where the sum of all exposures to one individual counterparty exceeds 5% of the eligible capital base, and not in other cases.\n \n \n2.6 \u201cLarge Exposure\u201d ( \u201cLE\u201d) means t he sum of all exposure values of a NBFC -UL \nmeasured in terms of  paragraph 6 of these instructions , to a counterparty and/  \nor a group of connected counterparties, if it is equal to or above 10 percent  of \nthe NBFC- UL\u2019s eligible capital base.  \n \n3 Scope of application  \n3.1 The guidelines shall be applicable to  NBFC- UL, both at the solo level and at the \nconsolidated (group) level.  \n3.2 Exposure shall comprise both on and off -balance sheet exposures by  the NBFC-\nUL.       \n4 Scope of counterparties and exemptions \n4.1 NBFC- UL\u2019s exposure to all its counterparties and groups of connected \ncounterparties , excluding the exposures listed below,  will be considered for \nexposure limits .  The exposures that are exempted from the LEF  are listed below:   \na) Exposure to the Government of India and State Governments which are  \neligible for zero percent r isk weight under capital regulations applicable \nto NBFC- UL;  \nb) Exposure where the principal and interest are fully guaranteed by the \nGovernment of India;  \nc) NBFC- UL\u2019s exposure to group entities that is deducted from its Owned \nFunds to arrive at the NOF.  \nd) Investment in the equity capital of the insurance company to the ex tent \nspecifically pe rmitted in writing by the Bank.  4 \n 4.2 Exposures shall be permitted to be offset with credit risk transfer instruments as \nper principle indicated at paragraph 6.1 of the A nnex  and the indicative list  of \nsuch instruments is  provided below:  \na) Cash margin/  caution money/  security deposit against which right to \nset off is available, held as collateral against the advances;  \nb) Central Government guaranteed claims which attract 0% risk weight \nfor capital computation ;  \nc) State Government guaranteed claims which attract 20% r isk weight \nfor capital  computation ; \nd) For corporate bonds held in current category and hedged by Credit Default Swap ( CDS), where there is no mismatch between the CDS \nand the hedged bond, the credit protection has been permitted to be \nrecognised to a maximum  of 80% of the exposure hedged.  The \nremaining 20% of the exposure shall be recognised on the original \ncounterparty . For corporate bonds held in permanent category and \nhedged by CDS where there is no mismatch between the CDS and \nthe hedged bond, the NBFC- UL can recognise full credit protection for \nthe underlying asset.  The exposure of the original counterparty shall \nstand fully substituted by the exposure to the protection seller.  \n \nExcept for 4.2 (a) and (b) above, in all other cases  where exposure to the \noriginal counterparty is reduced on account of an eligible credit risk transfer instrument provided by another counterparty for  that exposure, it needs to be \nrecognized as  an exposure to that extent on the credit risk transfer instrument  \nprovider.  \n \n4.3 Where two (or more) entities falling  outside the scope of the sovereign exemption \nare controlled by or are economically dependent on an entity that falls within the \nscope of the sovereign exemption { paragraph 4.1(a)} , and are otherwise not \nconnected, those entities will not be deemed to constitute a group of connected \ncounterparties.   \n 5 \n 4.4 NBFC- UL\u2019s exposure to an exempted entity whic h is hedged by a credit \nderivative shall be treated as an exposure to the counterparty providing the credit \nprotection notwithstanding the fact that the original exposure is exempted.   \n  \n4.5 NBFC- UL which is held by an NOFHC shall not  \na) have any exposure (credit and investments including investments in the equity/ debt capital instruments) to the Promoters/ Promoter Group entities or individuals associated with the Promoter Group or the NOFHC;  \nb) Make investment in the equity/ debt capital instruments in any of the financial entities under the NOFHC;  \nc) Invest in equity instruments of other NOFHCs.  \nExplanation: For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression, \u201cPromoter\u201d \nand Promoter group\u201d shall have the meaning assigned to those expressions in the \u201cGuidelines  for licensing of New Banks in the Private Sector\u201d issued by the \nBank.  \n \n5 The Large Exposure limits  \n5.1 Single Counterparty:   \na) The sum of all the exposure values of an NBFC- UL to a single \ncounterparty must not be higher than 20 percent of the NBFC- UL\u2019s \navailable eligible capital base at all times.  \nb) Board of the NBFC- UL may allow additional 5 percent exposure beyond \n20 percent  but at no time higher than 25% of the NBFC- UL\u2019s eligible \ncapital base, subject to the following conditions:  \ni) NBFC- UL has a policy approved by its board of directors setting out \nconditions under which exposure beyond 20% may be considered; and \nii) NBFC- UL shall record in writing the exceptional reasons for which \nexposure beyond 20% is being allowed in a specific case.   \n \nProvided that an Infrastructure Finance Company (IFC) may further  exceed the \nexposure limit by 5 percent of Tier I capital for exposure to a single counterparty.  \nProvided further that an NBFC- UL may exceed the exposure limit by 5 percent \nof its Tier I capital for exposure  to a single counterparty, if the additional 6 \n exposure is on account of infrastructure \u2018 loan and/ or investment \u2019. However \nsingle counterparty limit shall not exceed 25% in any case for NBFC -UL (other \nthan IFC)  and 30% for  NBFC- UL(IFC) . \n \n5.2 Groups of Connected Counterparties:   \na) The sum of all exposure values of an NBFC- UL to a group of \nconnected counterparties shall not be higher than 25 percent of the \nNBFC- UL\u2019s available eligible capital base at all times.  \nProvided that an IFC may exceed the exposure limit  by 10 percent of its Tier I \ncapital for exposure to a group of connected counterparties.  \nProvided further that an NBFC -UL may exceed the exposure limit by 10 \npercent of its Tier I capital for exposure to a group of connected counterparties, \nif the additional e xposure is on account of infrastructure \u2018 loan and/ or \ninvestment \u2019. \n \nb) Each NBFC- UL shall frame a policy approved by its board to \ndetermine the existence of a group of connected counterparties. The policy framed, and assessments made under such a policy shall be \nsubject to supervisory scrutiny.  \n \nc) In exceptional cases, if a NBFC- UL demonstrates to the RBI that \ndespite control being established, such control does not necessarily result in the entities concerned constituting a group of connected count erparties  (e.g., existence of control between counterparties due \nto specific circumstances and corporate governance safeguards) , \nthen it is not required to classify the entities as a group of connected counterparties.  \nd)  In exceptional cases, if a NBFC- UL can demonstrate to the RBI that \na counterparty which is economically closely related to another counterparty may overcome financial difficulties, or even the second \ncounterparty\u2019s default, by finding alternative business partners or \nfunding sources within an appropriate time period, then it is not 7 \n required to classify the entities as a group of connected \ncounterparties.  \n               \n5.3   A summary of the LEF li mits for NBFC -UL is given below:   \n(as % of eligible capital base)  \n                                        \n   \n5.4 Relation between interconnectedness through control and \ninterconnectedness through economic dependency:  \n \nThere may be situations where the control relationship and economic interdependence are interlinked. Therefore, one group of connected counterparties could include both types of factors in such a way that all relevant counterparties constitute a single risk  for the NBFC -UL. Risk of \ncontagion is present irrespective of type of connectedness (i.e. control or economic interdependence) between counterparties. NBFC- UL should \nassess counterparties with a view to identifying the chain of contagion leading to possible default of all entities.  \n \n6 Values of exposures  \n6.1 An exposure to a counterparty shall  constitute both on and off -balance sheet \nexposures  which  shall be calculated according to the method prescribed for \ncapital computation in Master Direction - Non-Banking Financial Company -   NBFC -UL (Other than IFC) NBFC -UL (IFC)  \n \nSingle \nCounterparty  \u2022 20% \n\u2022 additional 5% with Board \napproval  \n\u2022 additional 5 % if exposure \ntowards Infrastructure loan/investment  \n(Single counterparty limit shall \nnot exceed 25% in any case)  \u2022 25% \n\u2022 additional 5% with Board approval  \n \nGroup of \nconnected \nCounterparties   \u2022 25% \n\u2022 additional 10% if exposure \ntowards Infrastructure \nloan/investment  \u2022 35% 8 \n Systemically Important Non- Deposit taking Company and Deposit taking \nCompany (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016, as amended from  time to time. The \nexposures shall be permitted to be offset with credit risk transfer instruments  \npermitted in the aforesaid directions.  \n \n6.2 Factoring transactions: In the case of factoring on \u201cwith- recourse\u201d basis, the \nexposure shall be reckoned on the assi gnor. In case of factoring on \u201cwithout -\nrecourse\u201d basis, the exposure shall be reckoned on the debtor, irrespective of \ncredit risk cover/ protection provided, except in cases of international factoring where the entire credit risk has been assumed by the im port factor.  \n \n6.3 Exposures to Central Counterparties:  \n \na) The exposures to Central Counter Parties (CCPs), on account of \nderivatives trading and securities financing transactions outstanding against them shall be assigned zero exposure value. However, these exposures will be subject to the regulatory reporting requirements as \ndefined in paragraph 7 . \nb) Amount of the collaterals with CCPs shall be reckoned for arriving at \nthe exposure limit.  \nc) Other exposures:  Other types of exposures such as equity stake, \nfunding facilities, credit facilities, guarantees etc., shall be measured according to the rules set out in this framework, as for any other type of counterparty. These exposures shall be added together and be subjected to the LE limit.  \n \n6.4 Breach  \n \na) Any breach of Large Exposure limits shall be under exceptional \nconditions beyond the control of NBFC -UL, and i t shall be reported to 9 \n RBI (Department of Supervision, Central Office)  immediately  and \nrapidly rectified.  \nb) NBFC- UL cannot undertake any further exposure (at the entity or \ngroup level, as the case may be) until it is brought down within the \nlimit. \nc) Failure to comply with the exposure limit may lead to imposition of \npenalties on the NBFC -ULs by the supervisor.  \n \n7 Regulatory reporting \nNBFC- UL shall report its Large Exposures to the Reserve Bank (Department of \nSupervision, Central Office) as per the reporting templ ate given in Appendix 1.  The \nLEF reporting shall cover the following:  \na) all exposures, meeting the definition of large exposure ;  \nb) all other exposures, measured as specified in paragraph 6  of this \nframework without offsetting ex posure value with credit risk transfer \ninstruments, where values stand equal to or above 10 percent of the \nNBFC- UL\u2019s eligible capital base;  \nc) all the exempted exposures with values equal to or above 10 percent \nof the NBFC -UL\u2019s eligible capital base;  \nd) 10 largest exposures included in the scope of application, irrespective of the values of these exposures relative to the NBFC -UL\u2019s eligible \ncapital base.  \n \n8 Implementation date and transitional arrangements \nThese instructions  will be applicable from October 1, 2022.  Once NBFC -UL is subject \nto LEF,  credit concentration norms in respect of  single/  group of borrowers contained \nin Master Direction - Non-Banking Financial Company -  Systemically Important Non-\nDeposit taking Company and Deposit taking Company (Reserve Bank)  Directions, \n2016 shall no longer  be applicable to NBFC- UL. 10 \n Appendix 1 \nReturn on Large Exposures  \nName of the NBFC -UL  \nReturn for the Month   \nEligible Capital base (Tier I)  (Rs. crore)  \n \nA.

The extant instructions for RCBs  on issue and regulation of capital funds have been \nreviewed keeping in view , inter alia, the provisions of Section 12 read with Section 56 of the \namended Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act) . \n \nAugmentation of capital funds \n 3. RCBs are permitted to raise share capital, as hitherto, by way of (i) issue of shares to \npersons within their area of operation, in accordance with the provisions of their bye-laws, and \n(ii) issu e of additional shares to the existing members.  \n \n4.

For the purpose of enhancing investor education on the risk characteristics of regulatory \ncapital requirements, R CBs, which issue regulatory capital instruments as specified in para 4 \nabove, shall adhere to the following conditions:  \na) For floating rate instruments, banks should not use their  Fixed Deposit rate as benchmark. \nb) A specific sign-off as quoted below, from the investors , for having understood the features \nand risks of the instruments,  may be incorporated in the common application form of the \nproposed issue: \n\"By making this application, I / we acknowledge that I / we have understood the terms \nand conditions of the issue of [Name of the share/security] being issued by [Name of the bank] as disclosed in the Prospectus and Offer Document\". \nc) RCBs shall ensure that all the publicity material  / offer document, application form and other \ncommunication with the investor should clearly state in bold letters (Arial font, size 14, equivalent size in English / Vernacular version) how a PNCPS / PCPS / RNCPS / RCPS / PDI \n/ LTSB , as the case may be, is different from a fixed deposit, and that these instruments are \nnot covered by deposit insurance.  \nd) The procedure for transfer to legal heirs in the event of death of the subscriber of the \ninstrument should also be specifi ed. \nRefund of share capital \n7. In terms of Section 12 (2) (ii) read with Section 56 of the BR Act, a co-operative bank shall \nnot withdraw or reduce its share capital, except to the extent and subject to such conditions as the Reserve Bank may specify in this behalf.

Introduction \nPrimary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are expected to lay down, with the approval of their boards, \ntransparent policies and guidelines for credit dispensation, in respect of each broad category of economic activity, keeping in view the credit exposure norms and various other guidelines issued by the Reserve \nBank of India from time to time. \n2. Working Capital Requirements \n2.1 The assessment of working capital requirement of borrowers, other than Micro and Small enterprises , \nrequiring fund based working capital limits up to \u20b91.00 crore and Micro and Small enterprises  requiring \nfund based working capital limits up to \u20b95.00 crore from the banking system may be made on the basis \nof their projected annual turnover. \n2.2 In accordance with these guidelines, the working capital requirement is to be assessed at 25% of the \nprojected turnover to be shared between the borrower and the bank, viz. borrower contributing 5% of the \nturnover as  net working capital (NWC) and bank providing finance at a minimum of 20% of the turnover. \nProjected turnover may be interpreted as 'Gross Sales' including excise duty. \n2.3 The banks may, at their discretion, carry out the assessment based on projected turnover basis or the \ntraditional method. If the credit requirement based on traditional production / processing cycle is higher than the one assessed on projected turnover basis, the same may be sanctioned, as borrower must be financed up to the extent of minimum 20 per cent of their projected annual turnover. The projected annual \nturnover would be estimated on the basis of annual statements of accounts or other documents such as \nreturns filed with sales -tax / revenue authorities. Actual drawals may be allowed on the basis of drawing \npower to be determined by UCBs after excluding unpaid stocks.  \n2.4 Drawals against the limits should be allowed against the usual safeguards including drawing power and it is to be ensured that the same are used for the purpose intended. Banks will have to ensure regular and timely submission of monthly statements of stocks, receivables, etc., by the borrowers and also \nperiodical verification of such statements vis -a-vis physical stocks by their officials.  \n2.5 In respect of borrowers other than Micro and Small enterprises, requiring working capital limits above \n\u20b91 crore and for Micro and Small enterprises/ units requiring fund based working capital limits above \u20b95 \ncrore, UCBs may determine the working capital requirements according to their perception of the credit \nneeds of borrowers. UCBs may adopt turnover method or cash budgeting method or any other method \nas considered necessary. However, UCBs may ensure that the book -debt finance does not exceed 75% \nof the limits sanctioned to borrowers for financing inland credit sales. The remaining 25% of the credit \nsales may be financed through bills to ensure greater use of bills for financing sales.  \n3. Loan System for Delivery of Bank Credit  \n3.1 In the case of borrowers enjoying working capital credit limits of \u20b910 crore and above from the banking \nsystem, the loan component should normally be 80% and the remaining Cash Credit component. UCBs have been given freedom to change the composition of working capital by increasing the cash credit \ncomp onent beyond 20 per cent or increase the loan component beyond 80 per cent, as the case may be, \nif they so desire. UCBs are expected to appropriately price each of the two components of working capital \nfinance, taking into account the impact of such decisions on their cash and liquidity management. \n3.2 In the case of borrowers with working capital (fund bas ed) credit limit of less than \u20b910 crore, banks \nmay persuade them to go in for the Loan System by offering an incentive in the form of lower rate of \ninterest on the 'loan component' as compared to the 'cash credit component' The actual percentage of \n'loan component' in these cases may be settled by the bank with its borrower clients.  \n3.3 Ad hoc Credit Limit: The release of ad hoc / additional credit for meeting temporary requirements \nmay be considered by the financing bank only after the borrower has fully utilised / exhausted the existing \nlimit. As certain concerns were observed with regard to practices followed by banks in this regard, it has \nbeen reiterated vide circular DoS.CO.PPG.BC.1/11.01.005/2020-21 dated August 21, 2020 , that banks \nare expected to have a detailed Board approved policy on methodology and periodicity for review/renewal  \nof credit facilities within the overall regulatory guidelines and adhere to the same strictly. Further , timely \nand comprehensive review/renewal of credit facilities should be an integral part of the Board approved \nloan policy and credit risk management framework, and banks should avoid frequent and repeated ad-\nhoc/short review/renewal of credit facilities without justifiable reasons. Banks are also advised to capture \nall the data relating to regular as well as ad-hoc/short review/renewal of credit facilities in their core \nbanking systems/management information systems and make the same available for scrutiny as and \nwhen required by any audit or inspection by Auditors/RBI. Moreover , the processes governing \nreview/renewal of credit facilities should be brought under the scope of concurrent/internal audit/internal \ncontrol mechanism of banks with immediate effect. \n3.4 Sharing of Working Capital Finance: In respect of consortium lending, the level of individual bank's \nshare in Cash Credit and Loan Component shall be governed by the norm for single / group borrowers\u2019 \ncredit exposure. \n3.5 Rate of Interest : UCBs are allowed to fix separate lending rates for 'loan component' and 'cash credit \ncomponent'. 3.6 Period of Loan: The minimum period of the loan for working capital purposes may be fixed by banks \nin consultation with borrowers. Banks may decide to split the loan component according to the need of \nthe borrower with different maturity bases for each segment and allow roll over.  \n3.7 Export Credit: In respect of borrowers enjoying export credit limit, the bifurcation of the working capital \nlimit into loan and cash credit components, would be effected after excluding the export credit limits (pre-\nshipment and post-shipment).  \n3.8 Bills Limit : Bills limit for inland sales may be fully carved out of the 'loan component'. Bills limit also \nincludes limits for purchase of third party (outstation) cheques / bank drafts. Banks must satisfy themselves that the bills limit is not mis -utilised.  \nUCBs ma y lay down policy guidelines for periodic review of the working capital limit and the same may \nbe scrupulously adhered to. \n4. Credit Administration \nRate of Interest  \n4.1 UCBs are permitted to determine their lending rates taking into account their cost of funds, transaction \ncosts etc with the approval of their Board. However, banks are advised to ensure that the interest rates charged by them are transparent and known to all customers. Banks are also required to publish the minimum and maximum interest rates  charged on advances and display the information in every branch. \nThough interest rates have been deregulated, rates of interest beyond a certain level may be seen to be \nusurious and can neither be sustainable nor be conforming to normal banking practice. Boards of banks \nhave to lay down appropriate internal principles and procedures in this regard. In laying down such \nprinciples and procedures in respect of small value loans, particularly, personal loans and such other \nloans of similar nature, banks may take into account, inter -alia, the following broad guidelines:  \n(i) An appropriate prior -approval process should be prescribed for sanctioning such loans, which should \ntake into account, among others, the cash flows of the prospective borrower. \n(ii) Interest rates charged by banks, inter -alia, should incorporate risk premium as considered reasonable \nand justified having regard to the internal rating of the borrower. Further, in considering the question of \nrisk, the presence or absence of security and the value thereof should be taken into account.  \n(iii) The total cost to the borrower, including interest and all other charges levied on a loan, should be \njustifiable having regard to the total cost incurred by the bank in extending the loan, which is sought to be defrayed and the extent of return that could be reasonably expected from the transaction. \n(iv) In the case of loans to borrowers under priority sector, no penal interest should be charged for loans \nup to \u20b925,000. Penal interest may be levied for reasons such as default in repayment, non-submission of  \nfinancial statements, etc. However, the policy on penal interest should be governed by well -accepted \nprinciples of transparency, fairness, incentive to service the debt and due regard to genuine difficulties of  \ncustomers.  \n(v) Banks should ensure that the total interest debited to an account should not exceed the principal \namount in respect of short term advances granted to small and marginal farmers. The small and marginal \nfarmers for the purpose shall include those with land holding of 5 acres and less.  \n(vi) An appropriate ceiling may be fixed on the interest, including processing and other charges that could be levied on such loans, which may be suitably publicised.  \n(vi) Foreclosure Charges / Prepayment Penalty  - With effect from June 26, 2014 it has been decided \nthat UCBs will not be permitted to charge foreclosure charges / prepayment penalties on all floating rate \nterm loans sanctioned to individual borrowers. \nNo Objection Certificate \n4.2 UCBs should not finance a borrower already availing credit facility from another bank without obtaining \na 'No Objection Certificate' from the existing financing bank.  \n4.3 Opening of Current Accounts \n4.3.1 Keeping in view the importance of credit discipline, at the time of opening of current accounts, banks \nshould:  \n(i) insist on a declaration from the account holder to the effect that he is not enjoying any credit facility \nwith any other commercial bank or obtain a declaration giving particulars of credit facilities enjoyed by him \nwith any other commercial bank/s.  \n(ii) ascertain whether he / she is a member of any other co-operative society / bank; if so, the full details \nthereof such as name of the society / bank, number of shares held, details of credit facilities, such as  \nnature, quantum, outstanding, due dates etc should be obtained. \n4.3.2 Further, in case he / she is already enjoying any credit facility from any other commercial / co-\noperative bank, the bank opening a current account should duly inform the lending bank(s ) concerned \nand also specifically insist on obtaining a \"No Objection Certificate\" from them. In case of a prospective customer who is a corporate or large borrower enjoying credit facilities from more than one bank, the \nbanks may inform the consortium lea der, if under consortium, and the banks concerned, if under multiple \nbanking arrangement. In case a facility has been availed from a co-operative bank / society, it is essential \nfor the bank to comply with the requirements of the Co-operative Societies Act / Rules of the state \nconcerned in regard to membership and borrowings. \n4.3.3 Banks may open current accounts of prospective customers in case no response is received from \nthe existing bankers after a minimum waiting period of a fortnight. If a response is received within a \nfortnight, banks should assess the situation with reference to information provided on the prospective customer by the bank concerned and are not required to solicit a formal no objection, consistent with true \nfreedom to the customer of banks as well as needed due diligence on the customer by the bank. \nCertification of Accounts of Non-Corporate Borrowers by Chartered Accountants \n4.4 As per the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing of audited balance sheet and Profit & Loss Account is \nmandatory for  certain types of non-corporate entities. Therefore, the banks must insist on the audited \nfinancial statements from the borrowers enjoying large limits; since such borrowers would, in any case, \nbe submitting audit certificate to the income-tax authorities,  based on audit of their books of accounts by \na Chartered Accountant.  \n \n  \nDefaults in Payment of Statutory Dues by Borrowers \n4.5 UCBs may ensure that borrowers enjoying credit facilities, pay the provident fund payments and \nsimilar other statutory dues promptly. The non-payment of statutory dues by the borrowers is one of the \nsymptoms of incipient sickness of an industrial unit. Therefore, it is in the interest of both the lender and borrower to give high priority to the clearance of these dues. Apart fr om insisting on the borrowers to \nindicate a definite programme for clearance of arrears, banks may consider suitable restrictions on the outflow of funds. UCBs may incorporate an appropriate declaration in their application forms for grant / \nrenewal / enhancement of credit facilities so as to ensure that the position regarding the statutory dues is \ndisclosed therein. In respect of the corporate borrowers and non-corporate borrowers, the amount of \nstatutory dues should normally be reflected in their audited annual accounts. In case audited accounts do \nnot indicate the position clearly, a certificate may be obtained from the Chartered Accountant for this \npurpose.  \n4.6 Sanction of Advances \n4.6.1 Irregularities / Deficiencies in Credit Sanction \nBanks should take suitable precautions to avoid irregular practices such as sanctioning of advances \nbeyond discretionary powers and / or without proper credit appraisal in order to minimise chances of \nfrauds.  \n4.6.2 Delegation of Powers  \n(i) The Board of Directors should delegate specific powers to the Branch Managers and other functionaries \nat the Head Office level as also to the Chairman in the matter of sanction of advances and expenditure. \nA system should also be introduced to ensure that powers are exercised within the li mits prescribed and \nany transgressions are immediately reported to Head Office. \n(ii) The internal inspectors should examine during the course of inspection of branches whether powers \nhave been exercised properly and any unauthorised exercise of powers shou ld immediately be brought \nto the notice of Head Office. Similarly, sanctions beyond discretionary powers by the Chairman, Chief \nExecutive Officer and other executives at the Head Office should also be reported to the Board of \nDirectors.  \nOral Sanction \n4.6.3 The higher authorities at various levels should desist from the unhealthy practice of conveying \nsanction of advances orally or on telephone. \n4.6.4 Proper Record of Deviations \n(i) Only in exigencies, where sanctions are made on telephone / oral instructions of higher functionaries \nor sanctions beyond discretionary powers have to be resorted to, the following steps should be taken:  \n(a) Record of such instructions / sanctions should be maintained by the sanctioning / disbursing authorities \nexplaining the circ umstances under which sanctions were made. \n(b) Written confirmation of the competent sanctioning authority should be obtained by the disbursing \nauthority / official within a week / fortnight.  \n(c) Sanctions within discretionary powers should also be reported to Head Office within a stipulated time \nand Head Office should meticulously follow up receipt of such returns.  \n(d) Head Office should diligently scrutinise the statements / returns and should initiate stringent ac tion \nagainst erring functionary (s) if he is / they are / found to have indulged in unauthorised sanctioning.  \n(ii) Officials should exercise powers delegated to them judiciously and should not exceed their \ndiscretionary powers for granting loans and advances. Violations, if any, in this regard should be viewed \nseriously and the guilty should be punished suitably. \n4.7 Monitoring Operations in Loan Accounts \n4.7.1 Post -Sanction Monitoring \n(i) It is the primary responsibility of banks to be vigilant and ensure proper end use of bank funds / monitor \nthe funds flow. It is, therefore, necessary for banks to evolve such arrangements as may be considered \nnecessary to ensure that drawals from cash credit / overdraft accounts are strictly for the purpose for \nwhich the credit limits are sanctioned by them.  \n(ii) Post sanction follow -up of loans and advances should be effective so as to ensure that the security \nobtained from borrowers by way of hypothecation, pledge, etc. are not tampered with in any manner and are adequate. \n(iii) Accounts showing sign of turning into NPAs:  Banks may put in place more stringent safeguards, \nespecially where accounts show  sign of turning into NPAs. In such cases banks may strengthen their \nmonitoring system by resorting to more frequent inspections of borrowers' godowns, ensuring that sale \nproceeds are routed through the borrower's accounts maintained with the bank and insisting on pledge of \nthe stock in place of hypothecation.  \n(iv) Drawals against clearing cheques should be sanctioned only in respect of first class customers and \neven in such cases the extent of limits and the need therefore should be subjected to thorough scrutiny \nand periodic review. Banks should not issue banker's cheques / pay orders / demand drafts against instruments presented for clearing, (unless the proceeds thereof are collected and credited to the account \nof the party) or to borrowers whose accounts are already overdrawn or likely to be overdrawn with the \nissue of such instruments. \n(v) Drawals against clearing instruments should be normally confined to bank drafts and Government \ncheques and only to a limited extent against third party cheques. \n(vi) Cheques against which drawals are allowed, should represent genuine trade transactions and strict \nvigilance should be observed against assisting kite-flying oper ations.  \n4.7.2 Responsibility  \n(i) The primary responsibility for preventing misuse of funds rests with the management of banks. UCBs \nshould, therefore, take appropriate steps to review and tighten their internal administration and control \nmeasures so as to eliminate the scope for misuse / diversion of funds and malpractices. \n(ii) Banks should take serious view of instances of misuse of power, corruption and other malpractices \nindulged by the members of staff and erring staff members should be given punishments befitting the \nseriousness of the irregularity. Quick disposal of enquiries by the banks and award of deterrent \npunishment would be necessary in all such cases. \nAnnual Review of Advances \n4.8 For an effective monitoring of the advances, it is imperative for the banks to undertake an exercise for \nreview of the advances on a regular basis. Apart from the usual objective of such a review of assessing \nthe quality of operation, safety of funds, etc. the review should specifically attempt to make an assessment \nof the working capital requirements of the borrower based on the latest data available, whether limits \ncontinue to be within the need-based requirements and according to the bank's prescribed lending norms.  \nValuation of properties-empanelment of valuers \n4.9 The issue of correct and realistic valuation of fixed assets owned by banks and that accepted by them \nas collateral for a sizable portion of their advances portfolio assumes significance in view of its implications  \nfor correct measurement of capital adequacy position of banks. UCBs are, therefore, advised to put in \nplace a system / procedure for realistic valuation of fixed assets and also for empanelment of valuers for \nthe purpose as per guidelines given at Annex 1 . \nDiversion of Funds \n4.10 UCBs should have a mechanism for proper monitoring of the end use of funds. Wherever diversion \nis observed, they should take appropriate action including recalling the loans, reduction of sanctioned limits, charging penal interest etc. to protect the bank's interest. UCBs should keep a proper vigil over requests of their clients for cash withdrawals from their accounts for large amounts. Whenever stocks under hypothecation to cash credit and other loan accounts are found to have been sold but the proceeds \nthereof not credited to the loan account, such action should normally be treated as a fraud. In such cases, \nbanks may take immediate steps to secure the remaining stock so as to prevent further erosion in the \nvalue of the available security  as also other action as warranted. \n4.11 Diversion of funds would be construed to include any one of the under -noted occurrences:  \na) utilisation of short-term working capital funds for long-term purposes not in conformity with the terms of sanctions;  \nb) deploying borrowed funds for purposes / activities or creation of assets other than those for which the loan was sanctioned;  \nc) transferring funds to the subsidiaries / group companies or other corporates by whatever modalities;  \nd) routing of funds through any bank other than the lender bank or members of consortium without prior permission of the lender; \ne) investment in other companies by way of acquiring equities / debt instruments without approval of \nlenders;  \nf) shortfall in deployment of funds vis -a-vis the amounts disbursed / drawn, and the difference not being \naccounted for. \n4.12 Siphoning of funds should be construed to have occurred if any funds borrowed are utilised for \npurposes unrelated to the operations of the borrower, to the detriment of the financial health of the entity or of the lender. The decision as to whether a particular instance amounts to siphoning of funds would \nhave to be a judgement of the lenders based on objective facts and circumstances of the case.  \nEnd-use of Funds \n4.13 In cases of project financing, banks should seek to ensure end use of funds by, inter alia, obtaining \ncertification from the Chartered Accountants for the purpose. In case of short-term corporate / clean loans, such an approach ought to be supplemented by 'due diligence' on the part of lenders themselves, and to \nthe extent possible, such loans should be limited to only those borrowers whose integrity and reliability \nwere above board. UCBs, therefore, should not depend entirely on the certificates issued by the Chartered Accountants but strengthen their internal controls and the credit risk management system to enhance the quality of their loan portfolio. Needless to say, ensuring end-use of funds by banks should form a part of \ntheir loan policy document for which appropriate measures should be put in place.  \n4.14 The following are the illustrative measures that could be taken by the lenders for monitoring and ensuring end-use of funds: \n(a) Meaningful scrutiny of quarterly progress reports / operating statements / balance sheets of the \nborrowers; \n(b) Regular inspection of borrowers' assets charged to the lenders as security;  \n(c) Periodic scrutiny of borrowers' books of accounts and the no-lien accounts maintained with other \nbanks;  \n(d) Periodic visits to the assisted unit s; \n(e) System of periodical stock audit, in case of working capital finance;  \n(f) Periodic comprehensive management audit of the 'Credit' function of the lenders, so as to identify the \nsystemic weaknesses in the credit-administration.  \n5. Exchange of Credit Information \n5.1 Membership of Credit Information Companies (CICs)  \n5.1.1 With effect from January 29, 2015, it has been decided to mandate all UCBs to become member/s \nof all CICs and moderate the membership and annual fees suitably. In this regard, UCBs have been \nadvised to comply with the directive DBR.No.CID.BC.59/20.16.056/2014-15 dated January 15, 2015 and \nbecome member of all CICs and submit data (including historical data) to them. \n5.1.2 Data Format for furnishing of credit information to CICs and other Regulatory measures \nIt has been decided to implement with modifications , certain recommendations of the Committee to \nRecommend Data Format for furnishing of Credit Information to CICs (Chairman: Shri. Aditya Puri) as \ngiven in Annex -6.  Further, in view of the Resolution Framework for COVID -19 related stress, Uniform \nCredit Reporting Format for Consumer Bureau and Commercial Bureau, as contained in Appendix -A (of \nAnnex -6) has been modified vide DoR.FIN.REC.46/20.16.056/2020-21 dated March 12, 2021 , as under: \n(i) Consumer Bureau: The label of the field \u2018Written off and Settled status\u2019 is modified as \u2018Credit Facility \nStatus\u2019 and it will also have a new catalogue value, viz., \u2018Restructured due to COVID -19\u2019. \n(ii) Commercial Bureau: The existing field \u2018Major reasons for restructuring\u2019 will have a new catalogue \nvalue, viz., \u2018Restructured due to COVID-19\u2019.  \n5.1.3 Credit information reporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) members \nUCBs shall be guided by instructions contained in the circular DCBR.BPD.Cir.No.1 7/16.74.000/ 2015-16 \ndated May 26, 2016  on the matter. The instructions are also given as Annex \u2013 7 of this circular for ready \nreference.  \n5.2 Exchange of information - Lending under Consortium Arrangement / Multiple Banking \nArrangements \n5.2.1 UCBs need to strengthen their information back -up about the borrowers enjoying credit facilities \nfrom multiple banks.  \n(i) At the time of granting fresh facilities, banks may obtain declaration from the borrowers about the credit \nfacilities already enjoyed by them from other banks. In the case of existing lenders, all the banks may \nseek a declaration from their existing borrowers availing sanctioned limits of \u20b95.00 crore and above or \nwherever, it is in their knowledge that their borrowers are availing credit facilities from other banks, and \nintroduce a system of exchange of information with other banks as indicated above. \n(ii) Subsequently, banks should exchange information about the conduct of the borrowers' accounts with \nother banks at least at quarterly intervals. \n(iii) Obtain regular certification by a professional, preferably a Company Secretary / Cost Accountant / \nChartered Accountant regarding compliance of various statutory prescriptions that are in vogue.  \n(iv) Make greater use of credit reports available from Credit Information Companies [Credit Information \nBureau (India) Limited (CIBIL), M/s Experian Credit Information Company of India Private Ltd., Equifax \nCredit Information Services Pvt. Ltd. and High Mark Credit Information Services Pvt. Ltd.] \n(v) The banks should incorporate suitable clauses in the loan agreements in future (at the time of next \nrenewal in the case of existing facilities) regarding exchange of credit information so as to address \nconfidentiality issues.  \n5.2.2 Setting up of Central Electronic Registry under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of \nFinancial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 \nGovernment of India has set up the Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security \nInterest of India (CERSAI) under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, with the objective of \npreventing frauds in loan s involving multiple lending from different banks on the same immovable property. \nUCBs, accordingly were advised vide circular U BD.BPD.(PCB) Cir No. 27/13.04.002/2012-13 dated \nDecember 14, 2012  to v oluntarily file with CERSAI, in their own interest, , records of equitable mortgages \ncreated by them. Pursuant to this, Government issued a Gazette Notification dated January 22, 2016 for \nfiling of the following types of security interest on the CERSAI portal:  \ni. Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in immovable property by \nmortgage other than mortgage by deposit of title deeds. \nii. Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in hypothecation of plant and \nmachinery, stocks, debts including book debts or receivables, whether existing or future. \niii. Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in intangible assets, being \nknow how, patent, copyright, trademark, licence, franchise or any other business or commercial \nright of similar nature. \niv. Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in any \u2018under construction\u2019 \nresidential or commercial or a part thereof by an agreement or instrument other than mortgage. \n In this regard, instructions on Filing of Security Interest relating to Immovable (other than equitable \nmortgage), Movable and Intangible Assets in CERSAI, issued vide circular \nDBR.Leg.No.BC.15/09.08.020/2018 -19 dated December 27, 2018  have been made applicable to UCBs. \nAccordingly, UCBs were advised to complete filing the charges pertaining to subsisting transactions with \nCERSAI by March 31, 2019. It has also been advised to file the charges relating to all current transactions \nwith CERSAI on an ongoing basis   \n5.3 Disclosure of Information and Monitoring of Defaulting Borrowers \n5.3.1 Scheduled UCBs are required to submit to the Reserve Bank of India as at the end of September \nand March every year, the details of the borrowal accounts which have been classified as doubtful, loss or suit filed with outstanding (both under funded and non-funded limits) aggregating \u20b91 crore and above as per the format given in Annex 3\n. \n5.3.2 The Reserve Bank of India is circulating to the banks and financial institutions the information on the \ndefaulters (i.e., advances classified as doubtful and loss). The banks and financial institutions may make \nuse of the information while considering the merits of the requests for new or additional credit limits by \nexisting and new constituents.  \n5.3.3 All UCBs are required to submit the quarterly list of suit filed accounts of \u20b91 crore and above, \nclassified as doubtful or loss, to CIBIL and / or any other credit information company which has obtained \nCoR from RBI and of which the UCB is a member. \n5.3.4 All UCBs are required to submit the list of suit filed accounts of willful defaulters of \u20b925 lakh and \nabove as at the end of quarter March, June, September and December to CIBIL and / or any other credit \ninformation company which has obtained CoR from RBI and of which the UCB is a member.  \n5.3.5 The data on borrowal accounts against which suits have been filed for recovery of adva nces \n(outstanding aggregating \u20b91.00 crore and above) and suit filed accounts of willful defaulters with  \noutstanding balance of \u20b925 lakh and above, based on information furnished by scheduled commercial \nbanks and financial institutions is available at www.cibil.com . \n5.3.6 UCBs can verify the lists to ensure that the defaulting borrowing units as also their proprietors / \npartners / directors etc. named in the list of suit-filed accounts, either in their own names or  in the names \nof other units with which they are associated, are not extended further credit facilities. \n5.3.7 The banks may make enquiry, if any, about the defaulters from the reporting bank / financial \ninstitution.  \n5.4 Collection and dissemination of information on cases of wilful default of \u20b925.00 lakh and above \n5.4.1 Scheduled UCBs are required to report on a quarterly basis, all cases of wilful defaults, which \noccurred, or are detected after March 31, 1999 in the proforma given in Annex 3 . All non-performing \nborrowal accounts with outstanding (funded facilities and such non-funded facilities which are converted \ninto funded facilities) aggregating to \u20b9 25.00 lakh and above are to be reported. \n5.4.2 A wilful default would be deemed to have occurred if any of the following events is noted: \n(a) The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligations to the lender even when it has \nthe capacity to honour the said obligation.  \n(b) The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligation to the lender and has not utilized \nthe finance from the lender for the specific purposes for which finance was availed of but has diverted the \nfunds for other purposes.  \n(c) The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligations to the lender and has siphoned \noff the fund so that the funds have not been utilized for the specific purpose for which finance was availed of, nor are the funds available with the unit in the form of other assets.  \n(d) The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligation to the lender and has also \ndisposed of or removed the movable fixed assets or immovable property given by it for the purpose of \nsecuring a term loan, without the knowledge of the bank / lender. \nCut-off limits \n5.4.3 While the penal measures would normally be attracted by all the borrowers identified as willful \ndefaulters or the promoters involved in diversion / siphoning of funds, keeping in view the present limit of \n\u20b925 lakh fixed by the Central Vigilance Commission for reporting of cases of willful default by scheduled \nbanks to Reserve Bank of India, any willful defaulter w ith an outstanding balance of \u20b925 lakh or more \nwould attract the penal measures stipulated in the paragraph below. The limit of \u20b925 lakh may  also be \napplied for the purpose of taking cognisance of the instances of 'siphoning' / 'diversion' of funds.  \nPenal measures \n5.4.4 In order to prevent access to the capital markets by the wilful defaulters, a copy of the list of wilful \ndefaulters is forwar ded by Reserve Bank of India to Securities and Exchange Board of India as well. It \nhas also been decided that the following measures should be initiated by scheduled UCBs against the \nwilful defaulters: \n(a) No additional facilities be granted to the listed wilful defaulters. In addition, the entrepreneurs / \npromoters of companies where banks have identified siphoning / diversion of funds, misrepresentation, falsification of accounts and fraudulent transactions should be debarred from institutional finance for floating new ventures for a period of 5 years from the date the name of the wilful defaulter is published in \nthe list of wilful defaulters by the Reserve Bank of India.  \n(b) The legal process, where warranted, against the borrowers / guarantors and foreclosure of loans \nshould be initiated expeditiously. The lenders may also initiate criminal proceedings against wilful defaulters, wherever necessary  \n(c) Wherever possible, the banks should adopt a proactive approach for a change of Management of the \nwilfully  defaulting borrower unit. It would be imperative on the part of the banks to put in place a transparent \nmechanism for the entire process so that the penal provisions are not misused and the scope of such discretionary powers is kept to the barest minimum. It should be ensured that a solitary or isolated instance \nis not made the basis for imposing penal measures. \n5.4.5 Treatment of Group: While dealing with wilful default of a single borrowing company in a group, \nthe banks should consider the track record of the individual company, with reference to its repayment \nperformance to its lenders. However, in cases where a letter of comfort and / or the guarantees furnished \nby the companies within the group on behalf of the wilfully defaulting units are not honoured when invoked \nby scheduled banks, such group companies should also be reckoned as wilful defaulters.  \n5.4.6 Role of Auditors: In case any falsification of accounts on the part of the borrowers is observed by \nbanks, they should lodge a formal complaint against the auditors of the borrowers, with Institute of \nChartered Accountant of India (ICAI) if it is observed that the auditors were negligent or deficient in \nconducting the audit to enable the ICAI to examine and fix accountability of the auditors. \nWith a view to monitoring the end-use of funds, if the lenders desire a specific certification from borrowers' \nauditors regarding diversion / siphoning of funds by the borrower, the lender should award a separate \nmandate to the auditors for the purpose. To facilitate such certification by the auditors scheduled UCBs \nwill also need to ensure that appropriate covenants in the loan agreements are incorporated to enable \naward of such a mandate by the lenders to the borrowers / auditors.  \n5.4.7 Filing of Suits to Recover  Dues from Wilful Defaulters :  Scheduled UCBs should examine al l \ncases of wilful defaults of \u20b91.00 crore and above and file suits in such cases UCBs should also examine \nwhether in such cases of wilful defaults, there are instances of cheating / fraud by the defaulting borrowers and if so, they should also file criminal cases against those borrowers. In other cases involving amounts \nbelow \u20b91.00 crore, banks should take appropriate action, including legal action, against the defaulting \nborrowers. \n6. Prudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances \n6.1. General Principles The basic objective of restructuring is to preserve economic value of units and \nnot evergreening of problem accounts. This can be achieved by banks and the borrowers by careful \nassessment of the viability, quick detection of weaknesses in accounts and a time-bound implementation \nof restructuring packages. The prudential guidelines will be applicable to all categories of debt restructuring other than those restructured on account of natural calamities, which will continue to be governed by the extant guidelines. The principles and prudential norms laid down are applicable to all \nadvances , including borrowers who are eligible for special regulatory treatment for asset classification as \ndetailed in the prudential guideline on restructuring of advances at para 2.2.7 of Master Circular  - Income \nRecognition, Asset Classification, Provisioning and Other Related Matters \u2013 UCBs dated April 1 , 2021, as \namended from time to time. The revised definition of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises has been given \nin Annex 4\n1.  \n6.2. Eligibility Criteria for Restructuring of Advances \n6.2.1. Banks  may restructure the accounts classified under 'standard', 'sub-standard' and 'doubtful' \ncategories.  \n6.2.2 Banks cannot reschedule / restructure / renegotiate borrowal accounts with retrospective effect. \nWhile a restructuring proposal is under consideration, the usual asset classification norms would continue \nto apply. The process of re-classification of an asset should not stop merely because restructuring \nproposal is under consideration. The asset classification status as on the date of approval of the \nrestructured package by the competent authority would be relevant to decide the asset classification \n                                                            \n1 Government of India (GoI), Gazette Notification S.O. 2119 (E) dated June 26, 2020 and RBI circular \nFIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.3/06.02.31/2020-21 dated July 2, 2020  m ay be referred. \n  \nstatus of the account after restructuring / rescheduling / renegotiation. In case there is undue delay in \nsanctioning a restructuring package and in the meantime the asset classification status of the account \nundergoes deterioration, it would be a matter of supervisory concern.  \n6.2.3 Normally, restructuring cannot take place unless alteration / changes in the original loan agreement \nare made with the formal consent / application of the debtor. However, the process of restructuring can \nbe initiated by the bank in deserving cases subject to customer agreeing to the terms and conditions. \n6.2.4 No account will be taken up for restructuring by the banks unless the financial viability is established \nand there is a reasonable certainty of repayment from the borrower, as per the terms of restructuring \npackage. The viability should be determined by the banks based on the acceptable viability benchmarks \ndetermined by them , which may be applied on a case-by -case basis, depending on merits of each case. \nIllustratively, the parameters may include the Return on Capital Employed, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, \nGap between the Internal Rate of Return and Cost of Funds and the amount of provision required in lieu \nof the diminution in the fair value of the restructured advance. The accounts not considered viable should not be restructured and banks should accelerate the recovery measures in respect of such accounts. Any \nrestructuring  done without looking into cash flows of the borrower and assessing the viability of the projects \n/ activity financed by banks would be treated as an attempt at ever greening a weak credit facility and \nwould invite supervisory concerns / action.  \n6.2.5 The borrowers indulging in frauds and malfeasance will continue to remain ineligible for \nrestructuring. \n7. Specific Lending Activities \n7.1 Bridge Loans / Interim Finance \n7.1.1 The grant of bridge loan / interim finance by UCBs to any company (including finance companies) \nis totally prohibited.  \n7.1.2 The ban on sanction of bridge loans / interim finance is also applicable in respect of Euro issues.  \n7.1.3 The banks should not circumvent these instructions by purport and / or intent by sanction of credit \nunder a different nomenclature like unsecured negotiable notes, floating rate interest bonds, etc. as also \nshort-term loans, the repayment of which is proposed / expected to be made out of funds to be or likely \nto be mobilised from external / other sources and not out of the surplus generated by the use of the \nasset(s).  \n7.1.4 If any bank has sanctioned and disbursed any bridge loan / interim finance, it should report the same \nto the Regional Office concerned of the Urban Banks Department with full particulars and certifying that the loans are utilised strictly for the purpose for which the public issue and / or market borrowing was \nintended. Thereafter, the banks concerned should immediately take steps to ensure timely repayment of \nsuch bridge loans / interim finance already sanctioned and disbursed and under no circumstances, should \nthe banks allow extension of time for repayment of existing bridge loans / interim finance. \n7.1.5 These instructions are issued by the Reserve Bank of India in exercise of powers conferre d by the \nSections 21 and 35A read with section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \nAdvances to Real Estate and Commercial Real Estate Sector  \n7.2 UCBs should frame comprehensive prudential norms relating to the ceiling on the total amount of real \nestate loans, single / aggregate exposure limit for such loans, margins, security, repayment schedule and \navailability of supplementary finance taking into account guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India and the policy should be approved by the banks' Board. Exposure to builders and contractors for commercial \nreal estate will include fund based and non-fund based exposures secured by mortgages on commercial \nreal estates (office buildings, retail space, multi -purpose commercial premises, multi -family residential \nbuildings, multi -tenanted commercial premises, industrial or warehouse space, hotels etc). Further, while \nframing the policy, the banks may also consider for inclusion the National Building Code framed by Bureau  \nof Indian Standards (BIS). For detailed information the website of Bureau of Indian Standards \n(www.bis.gov.in ) can be accessed.  \n7.3 Financing of Leasing / Hire Purchase Companies \n7.3.1 Enrolment of Financial Companies as Members  \n(i) UCBs are normally not expected to enroll non- banking financial institutions like investment and financial \ncompanies as their members since it would be in contravention of the State Co-operative Societies Act \nconcerned and will also not be in conformity with the provisions of model bye-law No.9 recommended for \nadoption, by all banks.  \n(ii) Therefore, the UCBs are not permitted to finance non- banking financial companies (NBFCs), other \nthan those engaged in hire purchase / leasing.  \n7.3.2 Norms for financing  \n(i) As in the case of finance and investment companies, admission of NBFCs which are not engaged \nexclusively in leasing / hire purchase business as members may be contrary to the provisions contained in the State Co-operative Societies Act concerned and model bye-law No.9 referred to above. It will, therefore, be necessary for banks to obtain prior approval of the Registrar of Co- operative Societies \nconcerned before admitting them as members.  \n(ii) Even financing the Companies involved in Leasing and hire purchase business  by UCBs on a large \nscale is not favoured by the Reserve Bank of India, since the banks are basically required to cater to the credit needs of the people of small means.  \n(iii) Presently banks with working capital funds aggregating to \u20b925 cr ore and above only are permitted to \ntake up the financing of Companies involved in Leasing and hire purchase business  and that too, only in \nconsortium with other scheduled commercial banks. The banks should observe the following norms, while \nfinancing such companies: \n(a) The level of finance to Companies involved in Leasing and hire purchase business  depends on the \nnet owned funds of the companies, subject to the overall ceiling on their borrowings upto ten times of their owned funds. \n(b) Bank credit to companies engaged in equipment leasing and hire purchases (i.e., at least 75 per cent \nof assets are in equipment leasing / hire purchase and 75 per cent of their gross income is derived from \nthese two types of activities as per their last audited balance sheet) may be extended within the ceiling of \nthree times of the net owned funds within the overall ceiling of their borrowings upto ten times of net owned \nfunds.  \n(c) In the case of other equipment leasing / hire purchases companies (i.e. companies whose assets in \nequipment leasing / hire purchase business are less than 75 per cent and whose gross income derived from these two types of activities as per the last audited balance sheet is less than 75 per cent of its gross income), the credit  limit has to be within two times of their net owned funds from the present level of four \ntimes. \n7.4 Working Capital Finance to Information Technology and Software Industry  \n7.4.1 In order to bring about uniformity in approach, Reserve Bank of India has formulated guidelines for \ninformation of banks, on various aspects of lending to information technology and software industry to \nfacilitate free flow of credit. The same were enclosed to our circular DS.SUB.No.4/13.05.00/98-99 dated \n5 October 1998, addressed to scheduled UCBs. Banks are, however, free to modify the guidelines based on their own experience without reference to Reserve Bank of India to achieve the purpose of the \nguidelines in letter and spirit.   \n7.4.2 These guidelines have been framed based on the recommendations made by the study group \nappointed by Reserve Bank of India to study the modalities of credit extension to software industry as also \ntaking into account the suggestions made by the industry associations. \n7.4.3 UCBs may take adequate steps to develop expertise in this area by training staff in project appraisal \nin the area of activity. It has to be ensured that the staff concerned is well aware of the requirements of the industry and remain in tune with the latest developments so that the higher standards of project appraisal can be maintained before extending the working capital finance to Information Technology and software industries.  \n7.5 Advances against pledge of Gold / Silver Ornaments  \n7.5.1 In order to mitigate the inherent risks attached to sanction of loans and advances against gold / silver ornaments, UCBs are advised to observe the safeguards as detailed in Annex 5\n \n7.5.2 Bullet Repayment: With effect from October 30, 2014 the quantum of loans against gold ornaments \nthat could be granted under the bullet repayment scheme with the approval of their bank\u2019s Board has \nbeen enhanced from \u20b91.00 lakh to \u20b9 2.00 lakh subject to the following guidelines :  \n(i) The amount of loan sanctioned should not exceed \u20b92.00 lakh at any point of time. \n(ii) The period of the loan shall not exceed 12 months from the date of sanction.  \n(iii) Interest will be charged to the account at monthly rests but will become due for payment along with principal only at the end of 12 months from the date of sanction. \n(iv) Banks should maintain a Loan to Value (LTV) ratio of 75% on the outstanding amount of loan including \nthe interest on an ongoing basis, failing which the loan will be treated as Non Performing Asset (NPA).  \n(v) Such loans shall be governed by the extant income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms which shall be applicable once the principal and interest become overdue. \n7.5.3 Crop loans sanctioned against the collateral security of gold ornaments shall continue to be \ngoverned by the extant income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms for such loans.  \n7.5.4 Hallmarking of gold jewellery ensures the quality of gold used in the jewellery as to caratage, \nfineness and purity. Banks would find granting of advances against the security of such hallmarked \njewellery safer and easier. Preferential treatment of hallmarked jewellery is likely to encourage practice of hallmarking which will be in the long-term interest of consumers, lenders and the industry. Therefore, banks while considering granting advances against jewellery may keep in view the advantages of \nhallmarked jewellery and decide on the margin and rates of interest thereon. \n7.5.5 In view of the concerns arising out of the significant rise in import of gold in recent years, UCBs were \nadvised not to grant any advance for purchase of gold in any form, including primary gold, gold bullion, gold jewellery, gold coins, units of gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) and units of gold Mutual Funds. \n7.5.6 As a prudential measure, it has been decided to prescribe a Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio of not \nexceeding 75 per cent for UCBs\u2019 lending against gold jewellery (including bullet repayment loans against \npledge of gold jewellery). Further, in order to standardize the valuation and make it more transparent to \nthe borrower, it has been decided that gold jewellery accepted as security/collateral will have to be valued \nat the average of the closing price of 22 carat gold for the preceding 30 days as quoted by the India Bullion \nand Jewellers Association Ltd. [Formerly known as the Bombay Bullion Association Ltd. (BBA)]. In terms \nof circular DCBR.BPD. (PCB/RCB). Cir. No. 3/13.05.001/2015-16 dated October 15, 2015 , UCBs may \nalso use the historical spot gold price data of the preceding 30 days publicly disseminated by a Commodity \nExchange regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. If the gold is of purity less than 22 \ncarats, the bank should translate the collateral into 22 carat and value the exact grams of the collateral. \nIn other words, jewellery of lower purity of gold shall be valued proportionately.  \nGrant of Loans for Acquisition of / Investing in Small Savings Instruments including Kisan Vikas \nPatras (KVP): \n7.6 Grant of loans for acquiring / investing in KVPs does not promote fresh savings and, rather, channelise  \nthe existing savings in the form of bank deposits to small savings instruments and thereby defeat the very \npurpose of such schemes. Banks may therefore ensure that no loans are sanctioned for acquisition of / \ninvesting in small savings instruments includi ng KVPs.  \n7.7 Lending to Public Sector Undertakings \nUCBs are advised, as a matter of principle, generally not to grant large value loans to Public Sector / \nGovernment Undertakings. \n8. Discounting / Rediscounting of Bills by Banks \nUCBs may adhere to the foll owing guidelines while purchasing / discounting / negotiating / rediscounting \nof genuine commercial / trade bills:  \n8.1 Since banks have already been given freedom to decide their own guidelines for assessing / \nsanctioning working capital limits of borrower s, they may sanction working capital limit as also bills limit to \nborrowers after proper appraisal of their credit needs and in accordance with the loan policy as approved \nby their Board of Directors. \n8.2 Banks should clearly lay down a bill  discounting policy approved by their Board of Directors, which \nshould be consistent with their policy of sanctioning of working capital limits. In this case, the procedure \nfor Board approval should include banks' core operating process from the time the bills are tender ed till \nthese are realised. Banks may review their core operating processes and simplify the procedure in respect \nof bills financing. In order to address the problem of delay in realisation of bills, banks may take advantage of improved computer / communic ation network like Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS), \nwherever available, and adopt the system of 'value dating' of their clients' accounts.  \n8.3 Banks should open letters of credit (LCs) and purchase / discount / negotiate bills under LCs only i n \nrespect of genuine commercial and trade transactions of their borrower constituents who have been \nsanctioned regular credit facilities by the banks. Banks should not, therefore, extend fund based (including \nbills financing) or non-fund based facilities l ike opening of LCs, providing guarantees and acceptances to \nnon-constituent borrower or / and non-constituent member of a consortium / multiple banking \narrangement. \n8.4 With effect from March 30, 2012, in case of bills drawn under LCs restricted to a parti cular UCB, and \nthe beneficiary of the LC is not a borrower who has been granted regular credit facility by that UCB, the \nUCB concerned may, as per their discretion and based on their perception about the credit worthiness of \nthe LC issuing bank, negotiate such LCs, subject to the condition that the proceeds will be remitted to the \nregular banker of the beneficiary of the LC. However, the prohibition regarding negotiation of unrestricted \nLCs for borrowers who have not been sanctioned regular credit facilitie s will continue to be in force. \nUCBs negotiating bills as above, under restricted LCs, would have to adhere to the instructions of the \nReserve Bank / RCS or CRCS regarding share linking to borrowing and provisions of Co-operative \nSocieties Act on membershi p. \n8.5 For the purpose of credit exposure, bills purchased / discounted / negotiated under LC (where the \npayment to the beneficiary is not made 'under reserve') will be treated as an exposure on the LC issuing \nbank and not on the borrower. All clean negoti ations as indicated above will be assigned the risk weight \nas is normally applicable to inter -bank exposures, for capital adequacy purposes. In the case of \nnegotiations 'under reserve' the exposure should be treated as on the borrower and risk weight assigned \naccordingly.  \n8.6 While purchasing / discounting / negotiating bills under LCs or otherwise, banks should establish genuineness of underlying transactions / documents.   \n8.7 Banks should ensure that blank LC forms are kept in safe custody as in case of security items like \nblank cheques, demand drafts etc. and verified / balanced on daily basis. LC forms should be issued to \ncustomers under joint signatures of the bank's authorised officials.  \n8.8 The practice of drawing bills of exchange claused 'without rec ourse' and issuing letters of credit \nbearing the legend 'without recourse' should be discouraged because such notations deprive the \nnegotiating bank of the right of recourse it has against the drawer under the Negotiable Instruments Act. \nBanks should not, therefore, open LCs and purchase / discount / negotiate bills bearing the 'without recourse' clause.  \n8.9 Accommodation bills should not be purchased / discounted / negotiated by banks. The underlying \ntrade transactions should be clearly identified,  and a proper record thereof maintained at the branches \nconducting the bills business.  \n8.10 Banks should be circumspect while discounting bills drawn by front finance companies set up by \nlarge industrial groups on other group companies. \n8.11 Bills rediscounts should be restricted to usance bills held by other banks. Banks should not rediscount \nbills earlier discounted by NBFCs except in respect of bills arising from sale of light commercial vehicles \nand two / three wheelers. \n8.12 Banks may exercise their commercial  judgment in discounting of bills of services sector. However, \nwhile discounting such bills, banks should ensure that actual services are rendered, and accommodation \nbills are not discounted. Services sector bills should not be eligible for rediscounting. Further, providing \nfinance against discounting of services sector bills may be treated as unsecured advance and therefore, \nshould be within the limits prescribed by Urban Banks Department for sanction of unsecured advances.  \n8.13 In order to promote payment discipline which would to a certain extent encourage acceptance of \nbills, all corporate and other constituent borrowers having turnover above threshold level as fixed by the \nbank's Board of Directors should be mandated to disclose 'aging schedule' of thei r overdue payables in \ntheir periodical returns submitted to banks.  \n8.14 Banks should not enter into Repo transactions using bills discounted / rediscounted as collateral. \nAny violation of these instructions will be viewed seriously and invite penal action from Reserve Bank of \nIndia.  \n9. Loans to Self Help Groups (SHGs) / Joint Liability Groups (JLGs)  \nUCBs may lend to SHGs and JLGs as per their Board approved policy framed in this regard, according \nto the guidelines prescribed below: \n9.1 Lending Policy:  Lending to SHGs / JLGs would be considered as normal business activity of the \nbank. UCBs will be required to frame, with the approval of their Board, a comprehensive policy on lending \nto SHGs / JLGs. This policy, including the maximum amount of loan, interest rate chargeable on loans \netc. should form part of overall credit policy of the bank.  \n9.2 Method of Lending:  UCBs may follow the method of lending directly to SHGs / JLGs. Lending \nthrough intermediaries will not be permitted. \n9.3 Enrolment of SHG / JLG  as Member:  SHGs are small groups, formal / informal, of individuals \npromoting savings habit among members. These savings are then lent by the group to the members for \nincome generating purposes. On the other hand, JLG is an informal group of individuals c oming together \nfor the purpose of availing of bank loan either singly or through the group mechanism against mutual \nguarantee in order to engage in similar type of economic activities.  \nThe SHG would normally consist of 10 to 20 members whereas a JLG would normally have between 4 \nand 10 members. Membership matters are governed by the bye laws adopted by the bank and provisions \nof respective State Co-operative Societies Acts or the Multi State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002. UCBs  \nwould, therefore, be requir ed to be guided by the provisions contained in the respective Act and take prior \napproval of the RCS / CRCS, wherever required, while enrolling such members and granting loans to \nSHGs / JLGs. The bye-laws of UCBs also need to provide for such lending. \n9.4 Share Linking Norms:  The extant instructions on share linking to borrowing would apply for lending \nto SHGs / JLGs. \n9.5 Nature of Loan - Secured or Unsecured:  The extant limits (individual and total) on grant of \nunsecured loans and advances will not apply to loans granted to SHGs. However, loans granted by UCBs \nto JLGs, to the extent not backed by tangible security, will be treated as unsecured and will be subject to \nthe extant limits on unsecured loans and advances.  \n9.6 Nature of Exposure - Individual or Gr oup: Loans granted to SHGs / JLGs would be governed by the \nextant guidelines on individual exposure limits.  \n9.7 Amount of Loan:  The maximum amount of loan to SHGs should not exceed four times of the savings \nof the group. The limit may be exceeded in case of well managed SHGs subject to a ceiling of ten times \nof savings of the group. The groups may be rated on the basis of certain objective parameters such as proven track record, savings pattern, recovery rate, housekeeping etc. JLGs are not obliged to keep deposits with the bank and hence the amount of loan granted to JLGs would be based on the credit needs \nof the JLG and the bank's assessment of the credit requirement. \n9.8 Margin and Security for the Loan:  Margin / security requirement will be as per Board approved \npolicy of the UCB concerned. \n9.9 Documentation:  UCBs may prescribe simple documentation for loans to be granted to SHGs / JLGs \nkeeping in view the purpose of the loan and the status of the borrower. \n9.10 Priority Sector:  Loans to SHGs / JLGs for agricultural and allied activities would be considered as \npriority sector advance. Further, other loans to SHGs / JLGs up to \u20b950,000 would be considered as Micro \nCredit and hence treated as priority sector advances. Lending to SHGs, which qualify as loans to priority \nsector, would also be treated as part of lending to weaker sections.  \n9.11 Opening of Savings Bank Account:  The SHGs / JLGs would be eligible to open Savings Bank \naccount with UCBs.  \n9.12 KYC Norms:  KYC verification of all the members of SHG need not be done while opening the \nsavings bank account of the SHG and KYC verification of all the office bearers would suffice. As regards \nKYC verification at the time of credit linking of SHGs, as KYC would have already been verified while \nopening the savings  bank account and the account continues to be in operation and is to be used for \ncredit linkage, no separate KYC verification of the members or office bearers is necessary. \nRevival of the Interest Tax Act 1974 - Collection from  Borrowers  \n10. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its Judgment dated April 16, 2004 has ordered that excess interest \ncollected by the banks from the borrowers through rounding off the applicable interest rate should be \nrecovered from the banks and credited to a Trust to be created for the benefit of disadvantaged people. \nThe Hon'ble Court had also directed that each concerned bank shall contr ibute to the extent of \u20b950 lakh \nto the said Fund. Accordingly, UCBs are advised that excess amount realised, if any, from their borrowers \ntowards interest tax by way of rounding off, may be deposited with the above referred Trust Fund. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has opened SB A/c No.65012067356 with the State Bank of \nPatiala, Shastri Bhavan Branch, New Delhi in the name of the Trust. UCBs, which have realised excess \namount from the borrowers, towards interest tax by way of rounding off to the next higher 0.25% are liable to deposit the said amount to the Trust Fund. As regards contribution of \u20b9 50 lakh to the Trust Fund, it is \nfor the UCBs concerned which have collected excess amount, to decide depending upon the facts and \ncircumstances of the case. \nSupreme Court in its Order dated February 21, 2014 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.301 of 2005 ordered that \ncredit institutions which were in existence between October 1991 and March 1997 but were merged with  \nanother bank / financial institution prior to the date of the Supreme Court Order in April 2004 or merged \nsubsequently, the transferee banks are liable to contribute to the extent of 50 lakh each as also deposit \nthe excess amount collected by way of rounding off the interest tax on the interest income on loans and advances by the transferor banks, to the Trust Fund. In view of this all UCBs were advised to take suitable action in accordance with the Order dated February 21, 2014 of the Supreme Court and report status to the concerned Regional Office of RBI. \n11. Guidelines on Relief Measures to be Extended by Banks in Areas Affected by Natural \nCalamities \n11.1 UCBs are expected to provide relief and rehabilitation assistance, in their area of operation to people \naffected by natural calamities such as droughts, floods, cyclones, etc. The guidelines are given in \nAnnex \n2. \n11.2 In order to avoid delay in taking relief measures on the occurrence of natural calamity, banks should \nevolve a suitable policy framework with the approval of the Board of Directors. An element of flexibility may be provided in the measures so as to synchronise the same with the measures which could be \nappropriate in a given situation.  \n11.3 Banks should get the documentation settled as per revised guidelines in consultation with their legal \ndepartments, taking into account the relevant provisions of the Contract Act and the Limitations Act and may issue appropriate instructions to their offices in respect of documentation in relation to cases covered by these guidelines.  \n \n         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n \n     \n \n     \n \n   \nAnnex \u2013 1 \nGuidelines on Valuation of Properties \u2013  \nEmpanelment of Valuers (Paragraph No. 4.9)  \nBanks may be guided by the following aspects while formulating a policy on valuation of properties and \nappointment of valuers: \na) Policy for Valuation of Properties \ni) Banks should have a Board approved policy in place for valuation of properties including collaterals \naccepted for their exposures. \nii) The valuation should be done by professionally qualified independent i.e. the valuer should not have \na direct or indirect interest. \niii) The banks should obtain minimum two Independent Valuation Reports for properties valued at \u20b9 50 \ncrore or above.  \nThe revaluation policy of fixed assets should, inter alia, cover procedure for identification of assets  for \nrevaluation, maintenance of separate set of records for such assets, the frequency of revaluation, \ndepreciation policy for such assets, policy for sale of such revalued assets, etc. The policy should also \ncover the disclosure required to be made in th e 'Notes on Account' regarding the details of revaluation \nsuch as the original cost of the fixed assets subject to revaluation and accounting treatment for \nappreciation / depreciation etc. As the revaluation should reflect the change in the fair value of t he fixed \nasset, the frequency of revaluation should be determined based on the observed volatility in the prices \nof the assets in the past. Further, any change in the method of depreciation should reflect the change in \nthe expected pattern of consumption o f the future economic benefits of the assets. The banks should \nadhere to these principles meticulously while changing the frequency of revaluation / method of \ndepreciation for a particular class of asset and should make proper disclosures in this regard.  \nb) Policy for Empanelment of Independent Valuers \ni) Banks should have a procedure for empanelment of professional valuers and maintain a register of \n'approved list of valuers'. \nii) Banks may prescribe a minimum qualification for empanelment of valuers . Different qualifications may \nbe prescribed for different classes of assets (e.g. land & building, plant & machinery, agricultural land, \netc). While prescribing the qualification, banks may take into consideration the qualifications prescribed \nunder Secti on 34AB (Rule 8A) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957. \n2. Banks may also be guided by the relevant Accounting Standard issued by the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants of India.  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \nAnnex - 2 \nGuidelines for Relief Measures by Banks in Areas Affected by Natur al Calamities \n[Vide paragraph 11.1] \n1. Periodic but frequent occurrence of droughts, floods, cyclones, tidal waves and other natural calamities \ncause heavy toll of human life and wide spread damage to economic pursuits of human beings in one \narea or the ot her of the country. The devastation caused by such natural calamities call for massive \nrehabilitation efforts by all agencies. The State and local authorities draw programmes for economic \nrehabilitation of the affected people. The developmental role assigned to the commercial banks and co-\noperative banks, warrants their active support in revival of the economic activities.  \n2. Since the area and time of occurrence and intensity of natural calamities cannot be anticipated, it is \nimperative that the banks have a blue- print of action in such eventualities so that the required relief and \nassistance is provided with the utmost speed and without any loss of time. This presupposes that all the \nbranches of urban cooperative banks will have a set of standing instructi ons spelling out the action that \nthe branches will have to initiate in the calamity affected areas immediately after the requisite declaration \nby the district / State authorities. It is necessary that these instructions should also be available with the \nState Government authorities and all the District Collectors so that all concerned are clear as to the action \nthat would be taken by the banks' branches in the affected areas. \n3. The precise details in regard to the provision of credit assistance by the comm ercial banks, will depend \non the requirements of the situation, their own operational capabilities and the actual needs of the \nborrowers. This can be decided by them in consultation with the district authorities.  \n4. Nevertheless, to enable banks to take un iform and concerted action expeditiously, particularly to \nprovide the financial assistance to agriculturist, small scale industrial units, artisan, small business and \ntrading establishments affected by natural calamities, the following guidelines are commended. \n5. To facilitate co- ordination and expeditious action by the financing institutions, the convenors of the \nconcerned District Consultative Committee (DCC) of the affected districts should convene a meeting \nimmediately after the occurrence of natural c alamities. In the event of the calamity covering a larger part \nof the State, the convenors of the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) will also convene a meeting \nimmediately to evolve a co-ordinated programme of action for implementation of the programme in \ncollaboration with the State / district authorities while determining the quantum of assistance required by \na person affected by the natural calamity, the banks may take into consideration the assistance / subsidy \nreceived by him from the State Governm ent and / or other agencies.  \n6. Regional / Zonal heads of UCBs should be vested with certain discretionary powers so that they do \nnot have to seek fresh approvals from their Central Offices to the line of action agreed to by the District / \nState Level Bank ers' Committees. For example, such discretionary power would be necessary in respect \nof adoption of scale of finance, extension of loan periods, sanction of new loans, keeping in view the total \nliability of the borrower (i.e. arising out of the old loan wh ere the assets financed are damaged or lost on \naccount of natural calamity as well as the new loan for creation / repair of such assets, margin, security, \netc.).  \n7. Identification of the Beneficiaries \nThe bank branches should obtain from the concerned Gove rnment authorities list of affected villages \nwithin their area of operation. From among the identified persons, assessment of loss sustained by the \nexisting constituents of the banks would be easier. In the case of fresh borrowers, however, discreet \nenquir ies should be made in this regard and assistance of the Government. authorities should be sought \nwherever available for ascertaining genuineness of their requirements. For providing conversion facilities \nin respect of crop loans, procedure for identificati on of areas where such facilities have to be provided \nhas been indicated under crop loans in paragraph 12 below. \n8. Coverage \nEach branch will provide credit assistance not only to its existing borrowers but also to other eligible \npersons within its command area provided they are not covered by any other financial agency.   \n9. Priorities  \nImmediate assistance including finances would be needed for protecting and rejuvenating standing crops \n/ orchards / plantations etc. Equally important will be repair and prote ction of livestock sheds, grains and \nfodder storage / structures, drainage, pumping, and other measures and operations to repair pump- sets, \nmotors, engines and other necessary implements. Subject to seasonal requirements, next crop financing \nwould be taken up. \n10. Agricultural Loans \ni) The bank assistance in relation to agriculture would be needed in the form of short -term loans for the \npurpose of raising crops and term loans for purchase of milch / draught animals, repairs of existing tube-\nwells and pump-s ets, digging of new tube-wells and installation of new pump- sets, land reclamation, silt \n/ sand removal, protection and rejuvenation of standing crops / orchard / plantations, etc., repairs and \nprotection of livestock sheds, grain and fodder storage struct ures, etc.  \nii) Crop Loans: In the case of natural calamities, such as droughts, floods etc., Government authorities \nwould have declared annewari to indicate the extent to which the crops are damaged. However, where \nsuch declaration has not been made banks should not delay in providing conversion facilities, and the \nDistrict Collector's certificate that crop yield is below 50 percent of the normal yield supported by the \nviews of the DCC in the matter (for which a special meeting may have to be convened) shou ld be \nsufficient for invoking quick relief arrangements. The certificate of the Collector should be issued crop -wise covering all crops, including food-\ngrains. Issuing of such certificates in respect of cash crops, may, \nhowever, be left to the discretion of the Collector. \niii) To be effective, the assistance to farmers will have to be disbursed with utmost speed. For this purpose \nthe lead bank and the district authorities concerned should evolve a procedure whereby identification of \nborrowers, issuance of certificates regarding Government / co -operative / bank dues, title of the applicant \nto land etc. is secured simultaneously.  \niv) Possibilities of organising credit camps, where Block Development and Revenue officials, Co-operative Inspectors, Panchayat Pra\ndhans etc. could help finalise the applications on the spot, could be \nexplored in consultation with the district authorities where such credit camps are being organised. The \nState Government will also arrange with the Collectors to issue an executive order  for the following \nofficers or their authorised representatives to assume respective duties and responsibilities as envisaged \nunder implementation of credit camps programme: \n\u2022 Block Development Officer  \n\u2022 Co-operative Inspector  \n\u2022 Revenue Authority / Village Revenue Assistant  \n\u2022 Bank official operating in the area \n\u2022 PACS / LAMPS / FSS  \n\u2022 Gram Panchayat Pradhan \nIn order to avoid delay, the forms in which the State Government Officers have to give certificates at the \nCredit Camps may be got printed in sufficient numbers by the respective District Magistrates.  \nv) In considering loan applications for the ensuing crop season the current dues of the applicants to the \nState Government may be ignored, provided the State Government declare a moratorium for a sufficiently \nlong period on all amounts due to the government as on the date of occurrence of the natural calamity.  \n11. Consumption Loans \nAs per extant instructions, loans up to \u20b9250/- could be sanctioned to existing borrowers for general \nconsumption purposes and the limit could be enhanced to \u20b91,000/-  in the States where the State \nGovernments have constituted risk funds for such lending. The present limit may be enhanced to \u20b95,000/ - \nwithout any collateral and such loans may be provided even if no risk fund has been constituted.   \n12. Fresh Loans  \n12. Timely fresh financial assistance to resume productive activities may be provided not only to the \nexisting borrowers, but also to other eligible borrowers. Notwithstanding the status of the existing \naccount, fresh loans granted to the borrowers will be treated as current dues. \n13. Restructuring of existing Loans \na. As the repaying capacity of the people affected by natural calamities gets severely impaired due to the \ndamage to the economic pursuits and loss of economic assets, relief in r epayment of loans becomes \nnecessary in areas affected by natural calamity and hence, restructuring of the existing loans will be \nrequired. The principal amount outstanding in the crop loans and agriculture term loans as well as \naccrued interest thereon may  be converted into term loans. \nb. The repayment period of restructured term loans may vary depending on the severity of calamity and \nits recurrence, the extent of loss of economic assets and distress caused. Generally, the restructured \nperiod for repayment may be 3 to 5 years. However, where the damage arising out of the calamity is very \nsevere, banks may, at their discretion, extend the period of repayment ranging up to 7 years and in \nextreme cases of hardship, the repayment period may be prolonged up to a maximum period of 10 years. \nIn all cases of restructuring, moratorium period of at least one year should be considered. Further, the \nbanks should not insist for additional collateral security for such restructured loans. The asset \nclassification status of the restructured term loan and other dues will be as under: \nc. The restructured crop loans may be treated as current dues and need not be classified as NPA. The \nasset classification of the restructured term loans would thereafter be governed by the revise d terms and \nconditions and would be treated as NPA if interest and / or installment of principal remain overdue for \ntwo crop seasons for short duration crops and for one crop season for long duration crops. Depending \nupon the duration of crops raised by an agriculturist, the above norms would also be made applicable to \nthe restructured agricultural term loans. \nd. The above norms will be applicable to all direct agricultural advances as listed at Annex I of Master \nCircular No. UBD.PCB.MC.No.10/09.14.000/2007 -08 dated July 4, 2007  on prudential norms on Income \nRecognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to advances. \ne. Additional finance, if any, may be treated as \u201cstandard asset\u201d and its future asset classification will be \ngoverned by the terms and conditions of its sanction. \nf. The asset classification as on the date of natural calamity will continue, if the restructuring is completed \nwithin a period of three months from the date of natural calamity. The restructured accounts would, \notherwise, be governed by provisions of circular UBD.BPD.No.30/09.09.001/05- 06 dated March 9, 2006. \nFurther, the guidelines applicable to sub- standard accounts, will apply, mutatis mutandis to doubtful \naccounts.  \ng. In retail or consumer loans segment, the banks may restructure the loan s in a manner suitable to the \nborrowers on a case-to- case basis.  \n14. Scale of Finance \nScale of finance in respect of different crops will be uniform in a district. The scales will be fixed taking \ninto account the prevailing conditions and norms presently a dopted by different lending agencies. In fixing \nthe scales, minimum consumption needs of borrowers will be taken into account. The concerned District \nMagistrate and Managers of branches of banks operating in the district would be advised to adopt the \nscale s so laid down. \n15. Development Loans - Investment Costs \ni) The existing term loan instalments will have to be rescheduled / postponed keeping in view the repaying \ncapacity of the borrowers and the nature of natural calamity viz.,  \na) Droughts, floods or cy clones etc. where only crop for that year is damaged and productive assets are \nnot damaged.  \nb) Floods or cyclones where the productive assets are partially or totally damaged and borrowers are in \nneed of a new loan. \nii) In regard to natural calamity under category (a), the banks may postpone the payment of instalment \nduring the year of natural calamity and extend the loan period by one year except (subject to the following \nexceptions) - \na) Those cultivators who had not effected the development or investment for which the loan was obtained \nor had disposed of the equipment or machinery purchased out of the loan.  \nb) Those who are income tax payers. \nc) In the case of drought, those who are having perennial sources of irrigation except where water supply \nwas not released from canals or irrigation facility was not available from other perennial sources.  \nd) Tractor owners, except in genuine case where there is loss of income and consequential impairment \nof their repaying capacity.  \niii) Under this arrangement the ins talments defaulted wilfully in earlier years will not be eligible for \nrescheduling. The banks may have to postpone payment of interest by borrowers. While fixing extension \nof period the commitment towards interest may also be taken into account. \niv) In reg ard to category (i)(b) above, i.e., where the borrower's assets are totally damaged, the \nrescheduling by way of extension of loan period may be determined on the basis of overall repaying \ncapacity of the borrower including his repayment commitment on the o ld term loans and towards the \nconversion loan (medium term loan) on account of postponing of repayment of short- term loans and the \nfresh crop loan. In such cases, the repayment period of total loan (including interest liability) less the \nsubsidies received from the Government agencies, compensation available under the insurance \nschemes, etc. may be fixed having regard to the repaying capacity of the borrower subject to a maximum \nof 15 years, depending upon the type of investment as well as the economic (use ful) life of the new asset \nfinanced, except in cases where loans relate to land shaping, silt removal, soil conservation etc. Thus in \nthe case of loans for agricultural machineries, viz. pump- sets and tractors, it should be ensured that the \ntotal loan peri od does not generally exceed 9 years from the date of advance. \n16. Apart from rescheduling existing term loans, banks will provide to affected farmers diverse type of \nterm loans for developmental purposes, such as:  \ni) Minor Irrigation \nTerm loans for repair s to wells, pump- sets, etc. which are to be quantified after assessing the extent of \ndamage and estimated cost of repairs. \nii) Bullocks \nWhere the drought animals have been washed away, requests for fresh loans for a new pair of bullocks \n/ he-buffaloes may be considered. Where loans are given for purchase of new cattle or where farmers \nhave bought milch cattle, reasonable credit may be given for purchase of fodder or feed. \niii) Milch Cattle \nTerm loan for milch cattle will be considered depending upon breed, milk yield, etc., the loan amount will \ninclude repairs to shelters, purchase of equipment and feed.  \niv) Insurance \nConsidering the proneness of areas to cyclones and other natural calamities, the cattle should be insured \ninstead of Risk -cum -Mortality Fund e stablished for similar purpose in other safe areas. Milch animals / \ndraught cattle should be branded for identification as also to serve as safeguard against their re- sale by \nthe beneficiaries.  \nv) Poultry and Piggery  \nFor poultry, piggery and rearing of goats, loans will be considered as per norms of different banks.  \nvi) Fisheries  \nIn the case of borrowers who have lost their boats, nets and other equipment, re- phasing of payment of \nexisting dues may be allowed on merits. Fresh loans may be granted to them  with loan maturity of 3/4 \nyears. Loans for repairs to boats of the existing borrowers may also be considered. In cases where \nsubsidy is available, the quantum of loan should be reduced to that extent. In States where substantial \nsubsidy towards cost of boats, nets, etc. is likely to be available, proper co- ordination with the State \nGovernment Department concerned in this regard must be ensured. Apart from complying with other \nnorms and conditions for grant of advances, assistance may be sought from the Dep artment of Fisheries, \nwhich may be expected to take measures which would enable banks to proceed with financing for this \npurpose. The boats should be comprehensively insured against all risks including natural calamities as \nfar as possible. \n17. Land Reclam ation \ni) It is likely that financial assistance will be required for reclamation of lands covered by sand casting. \nNormally, sand / silt deposits upto 3 inches will either be ploughed back into the soil or removed by the \nfarmers without any need for financ ial assistance. Loan applications will, however, be considered in \ncases where immediate cultivation is possible and reclamation (removal of sand) is necessary. Wherever \nreclamation finance for saline lands is warranted, the cost of reclamation not exceedin g 25 percent of the \nscale allowed for crop loan may be advanced along with the crop loan.  \nii) For other activates like Sericulture, Horticulture, Floriculture, Betel vine growing etc., banks will \nadvance loans for investment and working capital under their  existing schemes and follow usual \nprocedures laid down by them. The working capital finance may be provided until such period the income \nfrom the plantation is adequate to take care of such expenditure. \niii). However, additional need based crop loans, if necessary, would be given for revitalisation / \nrejuvenation of standing crop / orchards based on individual assessment. \niv) The question relating to procurement and proper arrangement for supply of adequate quantity of seeds \nand various types of fertiliser s will have to be discussed with the State Government and District \nAdministration in each district. Similarly, for the purpose of ensuring adequate irrigation facilities, the \nState Government will undertake repairs to Government owned shallow and deep tube- wells and River \nLift Irrigation System damaged by floods and other natural calamities. As for fisheries, the fisheries \ndepartment of the State Government will make arrangement to obtain fingerlings / and supply them to \nthose who wish to revive tank fishing with bank finance.  \nv) The State Government will have to consider preparation of schemes which would enable commercial \nbanks to obtain refinance at NABARD rates for amounts advanced by banks for the said purpose.  \n18. Artisans and Self -Employed  \ni) For all categories of rural artisans and self employed persons including handloom weavers, loans will \nbe needed for repairs of sheds, replacement of implements and purchase of raw materials and stores. \nIn sanctioning the loan, due allowance will be made for subsid y / assistance available from the State \nGovernment concerned.  \nii) There may be many artisans, traders and self- employed who may not have any banking arrangement \nor facility with any bank, but will now need financial assistance for rehabilitation. Such cate gories will be \neligible for assistance from banks' branches in whose command areas they reside or carry on their \nprofession / business. Where such a person / party falls under the command area of more than one bank, \nthe banks concerned will meet together and sort out his problem. \n19. Small Scale and Tiny Units  \ni) Rehabilitation of units under village and cottage industry sector, small scale industrial units as also \nsmaller of the medium industrial sector damaged, will also need attention. Term loans for rep airs to and \nrenovation of factory buildings / sheds and machinery as also for replacement of damaged parts and \nworking capital for purchase of raw materials and stores will need to be provided urgently.  \nii) Where the raw materials or finished goods have be en washed away or ruined or damaged, banks \nsecurity for working capital will naturally be eroded and the working capital account (Cash Credit or Loan) \nwill be out of order. In such cases, banks will convert drawings in excess of the value of security into a \nterm loan and also provide further working capital to the borrower. \niii) Depending on the damage suffered and time needed for rehabilitation and restarting production and \nsales, term loan instalments will have to be suitably rescheduled keeping in view t he income generating \ncapacity of the unit. Short- fall in margins will have to be condoned or even waived and borrower should \nbe allowed time to build up margin gradually from his future cash generation. Wherever State \nGovernment or any agency has formulate d special scheme for providing grants / subsidy / seed money, \nsuitable margin may be stipulated to the extent of such grants / subsidy / seed money. \niv) The primary consideration before the banks in extending credit to a small / tiny unit for its rehabilit ation \nshould be the viability of the venture after the rehabilitation programme is implemented. \n20. Terms and Conditions \nThe terms and conditions governing relief loans will be flexible as to security, margin, etc. In the case of \nsmall loans covered by gua rantee of Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation, personal \nguarantees will not be insisted upon. In any case, credit should not be denied for want of personal \nguarantees.  \n21. Security \nWhere the bank's existing security has been eroded because o f damage or destruction by floods, \nassistance will not be denied merely for want of additional fresh security. The fresh loan may be granted \neven if the value of security (existing as well as the asset to be acquired from the new loan) is less than \nthe loan amount. For fresh loans sympathetic view will have to be taken : \na) Where the crop loan (which has been converted into term loan) was earlier given against personal \nsecurity / hypothecation of crop which would be the case for crop loans upto \u20b95,000/-  and the borrower \nis not able to offer charge / mortgage of land as security for the converted loan, he should not be denied \nconversion facility merely on the ground of his inability to furnish land as security.  \nb) If the borrower has already taken a term loan against mortgage / charge on land, the bank should be \ncontent with a second charge for the converted term loan. \nc) Banks should not insist on third party guarantees for providing conversion facilities. \nd) In the case of term loans for replacement of equip ment, repairs, etc. and for working capital finance to \nartisans and self- employed persons or for crop loans, usual security may be obtained. Where land is \ntaken as security in the absence of original Title Records, a Certificate issued by the Revenue \nDepar tment Officials may be accepted for financing farmers who have lost proof of their titles i.e. in the \nform of deeds, as also the registration certificates issued to registered share-croppers. \ne) As per the recommendations of the Reserve Bank of India's rep ort on Customer Service, banks will \nfinance the bor rowers who require loans upto \u20b9500/- without insisting either on collateral security or \nguarantee for any type of economic activity. \n22. Margin  \nMargin requirements be waived or the grants / subsidy given by the concerned State Government may \nbe considered as margin. \n23. Interest  \nThe rates of interest will be in accordance with the directives of the Reserve Bank of India. Within the \nareas of their discretion, however, banks are expected to take a sympatheti c view of the difficulties of the \nborrowers and extend a concessional treatment to calamity -affected people. \ni) Those meeting the eligibility criteria under the scheme of Differential Rate of Interest should be provided \ncredit in accordance with the provis ion of the scheme.   \nii) In respect of current dues in default, no penal interest will be charged. The banks should also suitably \ndefer the compounding of interest charges.  \n24. Other Issues \ni) Business Continuity Planning \nIn the backdrop of increased leverag ing of technology in banking system, Business Continuity Planning \n(BCP) has become a key pre- requisite for minimizing business disruption and system failures. As a \nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP) strategy, banks may identify alternate branches for branc hes located \nin areas prone to natural calamities. Banks may therefore formulate full -fledged comprehensive BCP \nalong with Disaster -Recovery (DR) arrangements. The banks may also focus on keeping the DR site \ncurrent, to test them comprehensively and synchro nize the data between the primary and secondary \nsites.  \nii) Access to Customers to their Bank Accounts \na) In areas where the bank branches are affected by natural calamity and are unable to function normally, \nbanks may operate from temporary premises, under  advice to Reserve Bank of India. For continuing the \ntemporary premises beyond 30 days, specific approval may be obtained from the Regional Office (RO) \nconcerned of Reserve Bank of India. Banks may also ensure rendering of banking services to the affected \nareas by setting up satellite offices, extension counters or mobile banking facilities under intimation to \nRO of Reserve Bank of India. \nb) To satisfy customer's immediate cash requirements, banks could consider waiving the penalties \nrelated to accessing ac counts such as fixed deposits  \nc) Restoration of the functioning of ATMs at the earliest or making alternate arrangements for providing \nsuch facilities may be given due importance. Banks may consider putting in place arrangements for \nallowing their customer s to access other ATM networks, Mobile ATMs, etc. \niii) Currency Management  \nBanks / branches affected by natural calamity, if required, may contact other banks maintaining its current \naccounts or the currency chest branch to which it is linked in order to e nsure that supply of currency is \nmaintained to its customers. \niv) KYC Norms  \nTo facilitate opening of new accounts by persons affected by natural calamities especially for availing \nvarious relief's given by Government / other agencies, banks may open accounts with - \na) introduction from another account holder who has undergone full KYC procedure, or  \nb) documents of identity such as Voter's Identity Card or a driving license, identity card issued by an \noffice, company, school, college, etc. along with a docum ent indicating the address such as Electricity \nBill, Ration Card etc. or  \nc) introduction by two neighbors who have the documents as indicated in paragraph (b) above or  \nd) in the absence of the above, any other evidence to the satisfaction of the bank.  \ne) The above instructions will be applicable to cases where the balance in the account does n ot exceed \n\u20b950,000/- or the amount of relief granted (if higher) and the total credit in the account does not exceed \n\u20b91,00,000/- or the amount of relief granted, (if higher) in a year. \nv) Clearing and Settlement Systems \nTo ensure continuity in clearing service, Reserve Bank of India has advised the banks for 'on-city back -\nup centres' in 20 large cities and effective low -cost settlement solution for the remaining cities . The banks \nin a clearing area could meet with a view to providing flexible clearing services where normal clearing \nservices are disrupted. However, notwithstanding these arrangements, banks may also consider \ndiscounting cheques for higher amounts to meet customers' requirement of funds. Banks could also  \nconsider waiver fees for EFT, ECS or mail services so as to facilitate inward transfer of funds to accounts \nof persons affected by a natural calamity  \n25. Applicability of the Guidelines in the case of Trade and Industry  \nInstructions on moratorium, maximum repayment period, additional collateral for restructured loans and \nasset classification in respect of fresh finance will be applicable to all affected restructured borrowal \naccounts, including accounts of i ndustries and trade, besides agriculture  \n26. Applicability of the Guidelines in the case of Riots and Disturbances \nWhenever Reserve Bank of India advises the banks to extend rehabilitation assistance to the riot / \ndisturbance affected persons, the aforesai d guidelines may broadly be followed by banks for the purpose. \nIt should, however, be ensured that only genuine persons, duly identified by the State Government \nagencies as having been affected by the riots, etc., are extended rehabilitation / assistance.  \ni) With a view to ensuring quick relief to the affected persons, the District Collector, on occurrence of the \nriot / disturbances, may ask the Lead Bank Officer to convene a meeting of the DCC, if necessary, and \nsubmit a report to the DCC on the extent of damage caused to the life and property in the area affected \nby riots / disturbances. If the DCC is satisfied that there has been extensive loss to life and property, the \nrelief, as per aforesaid guidelines, may be extended to the people affected by riots / disturbances. In \ncertain centres where there are no DCCs, the District Collector may request the Convener SLBC of the \nState to convene a meeting of the bankers to consider extension of relief to the affected persons. The \nreport submitted by the Collector and the decision thereon of DCC / SLBC may be recorded and should \nform a part of the minutes of the meeting. A copy of the proceedings of the meeting may be forwarded \nto the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank of India. \nii) It should be ensured t hat only genuine persons duly identified by the State Administration, as having \nbeen affected by the riots / disturbances are provided the assistance.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \nAnnex - 3 \nFormat - Details of the borrowal accounts which have been classified as doubt ful, loss or suit \nfiled with outstanding (both under funded and non-funded) aggregating \u20b91.00 Crore and above  \n[Vide paragraph 5.3.1]  \nName of the Bank: \n1.

For details please \nrefer to circular FIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.3/06.02.31/2020-21 dated July 2, 2020 . The new criteria will \ncome into effect from July 1, 2020 and an enterprise shall be classified as a Micro, Small or Medium \nenterprise on the basis of the following criteria, namely:  \ni. a micro enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not exceed \none crore rupees and turnover does not exceed five crore rupees; \nii. a small enterprise , where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not exceed \nten crore rupees and turnover does not exceed fifty crore rupees; and \niii. a medium enterprise , where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not \nexceed fifty crore rupees and turnover does not exceed two hundred and fifty crore rupees . \n \n  \n \n     \n \n      \n \n        \nAnnex - 5 \nSafeguards to be observed Advances against Pledge of Gold / Silver Ornaments \n(vide paragraph 7.5.1)  \ni) Ownership of Ornaments \nIt is advisable that the advances are made to persons properly introduced to the bank. The bank should \nsatisfy itself about the ownership of the go ld ornaments etc. before accepting them for pledge. The bank \nshould obtain a declaration from the borrower that the ornaments are his own property and that he has \nthe fullest right to pledge them to the bank. Taking of ornaments for pledge and release ther eof to the \nparties concerned after repayment of the bank's dues should be done strictly in the authorised official's \nroom to avoid any risk.  \nii) Appraiser  \nThe bank should appoint an approved jeweller or shroff as an appraiser for valuation of the gold \nornaments proposed to be pledged to the bank and obtain adequate security from him in the form of cash \nand indemnity bond. Valuation and appraisal of the ornaments in the bank's premises itself would be \nideal but when these are not possible, the bank should ta ke suitable precautions against their loss while \nin transit. The bank should send the ornaments to the appraiser in a locked box, one key of which should \nbe kept with the appraiser and the other with the bank. The box should be sent through a responsible \nmember of the staff along with the prospective borrower. The placing of ornaments in the box at both the \nends should be done in the presence of the employee carrying the ornaments to the appraiser and the \nborrower. The bank should take a suitable insurance cover for loss of the ornaments while in transit.  \niii) Valuation Report  \na. The valuation certificate of the appraiser should clearly indicate the description of the ornaments, \ntheir fitness, gross weight of the ornaments, net weight of the gold content exclus ive of stones, \nlac, alloy, strings, fastenings and the value of the gold at the prevailing market price. The valuation \nreport should be duly signed by the appraiser and kept along with the loan documents by the \nbank.  \nb. In order to standardize the valuation a nd make it more transparent to the borrower, it has been \ndecided that gold jewellery accepted as security/collateral will have to be valued at the average \nof the closing price of 22 carat gold for the preceding 30 days as quoted by the India Bullion and \nJewellers Association Ltd. [Formerly known as the Bombay Bullion Association Ltd. (BBA)]. If the \ngold is of purity less than 22 carats, the bank should translate the collateral into 22 carat and \nvalue the exact grams of the collateral. In other words, jewell ery of lower purity of gold shall be \nvalued proportionately  \niv) Record of Security  \nThe full name of the borrower, his residential address, date of advance, amount and description of the \nornaments in detail should be recorded in the gold ornaments register which should be checked / initialled \nby the Manager. \nv) Custody of Ornaments \nThe ornaments belonging to each borrower (or articles of each loan) together with a list indicating the \ndescription of ornaments, gold loan account number , name of party, etc. sho uld be kept separately in \nsmall cloth bags. A tag indicating loan account number and name of the party should be tied to the bag \nto facilitate identification. The bags should be arranged in trays according to loan account numbers and \nkept in the strong room or fire proof safes under joint custody. \nvi) Period \nThe period of advance against gold ornaments should be generally restricted to 6 months or 1 year. \n  \nvii) Margin  \nAs a prudential measure, it has been decided to prescribe a Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio of n ot exceeding \n75 per cent for UCBs\u2019 lending against gold jewellery (including bullet repayment loans against pledge of \ngold jewellery).  The bank should collect interest on advances promptly. In no circumstances should it \nallow to water down the margin by d ebiting the interest accrued to the loan account.  \nviii) Return of Ornaments \nOn repayment of the loan together with the interest payable in the account, the ornaments should be \nreturned to the borrower and his receipt obtained in token of having received the ornaments. \nix) Part Release \nWhile allowing part release of the ornaments against part repayment of the loan, care should be taken \nto ensure that the value of the left- over ornaments is sufficient to cover outstanding balance with the \nmargin prescribed in the a/c.  \nx) Delivery to Third Parties \nWhen the ornaments are delivered to third parties, a letter of authority from the borrower and subsequent \nconfirmation of the borrower should be obtained. The letter of authority should contain an undertaking by \nthe borrower, absolving the bank of any responsibility in the event of dispute or loss arising from the \ndelivery of the ornaments to the party named therein. The receipt of the third party should be obtained \non the letter of authority as well as in the gold l oan ledger.  \nxi) Default  \nWhen the borrower fails to repay the loan on the due date, a notice calling upon him to repay the loan \nwithin a specified time should be given and if no response is received, a reminder should be sent by \nregistered post informing th e borrower that the ornaments would be auctioned and after adjusting the \nsale proceeds against the outstanding dues to the bank, the balance, if any, would be paid to the borrower \nagainst his receipt.  \nxii) Re-pledge of Ornaments \nIt is not advisable for UCB s to make advances against re- pledge of ornaments as this facility is likely to \nbe misused for financing moneylenders, which is not a desirable activity. \nxiii) Insurance \nThe jewels pledged to the bank should be insured for the appraised value against the r isk of burglary. If \nbanks store the pledged jewels in fire- proof strong rooms, insuring them against fire may not be \nnecessary. Banks may take blanket insurance policy covering cash, jewels and other valuables and also \ncovering all types of risks. \nxiv) Ver ification \nSurprise verification of the packets containing gold / silver ornaments by an officer other than the joint \ncustodian be undertaken and should be recorded in a separate register with necessary details.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnnex - 6  \n[vide paragraph 5.1.2]  \ni. Credit Information Reports (CIRs) / Credit Bureau Usage in all Lending Decisions and Account \nOpening :  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) should include in their credit appraisal processes / loan \npolicies, suitable provisions for obtaining CIRs from one or m ore Credit Information Companies (CICs) \nso that the credit decisions are based on information available in the system.  \nii. Populating Commercial Data Records in Databases of all CICs :  A roadmap in regard to CICs \npopulating their databases in respect to co rporate borrowers is required to be laid out. For this purpose, \nUCBs are advised to report data in respect of their corporate borrowers to the CICs in a timely manner \nwith immediate effect. After a period of six months, UCBs should start using data availab le with the CICs \nin respect of commercial / corporate borrowers, under a Board approved policy. \niii. Standardisation of Data Format :  With a view to streamlining the process of data submission by \nUCBs to CICs, it has been decided to standardise the formats  for data submission by the UCBs to the \nCICs. The data format as per  Appendix - A should be taken as the base for standardisation of data format \nfor consumer and commercial borrowers. The data format would be a non-proprietary reporting format \nand henceforth would be known as \"Uniform Credit Reporting Format\". The segment viz. consumer and \ncommercial will be denoted appropriately in parentheses, for example, \"Uniform Credit Reporting Format \n(Consumer)\". These should be uniformly  adopted by the UCBs. \niv. Technical Working Group : It has been decided to constitute a Technical Working Group comprising \nof representatives from Scheduled Commercial Banks (a member each from a Public Sector Bank, a \nPrivate Sector Bank and a Foreign Bank ), Urban Cooperative Banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), All \nIndia Notified Financial Institutions, CICs, NBFCs, HFCs, IBA and MFIN to institutionalise a continuing \nmechanism for reviewing and making changes where necessary to the data formats. The data fo rmats \nafter finalisation by the Group will be submitted to RBI for approval. The Working Group should also \nincorporate the additional fields as detailed in Appendix - B. \nv. Rectification of Rejected Data : CICs are required to share with UCBs the logic and validation \nprocesses involved in data acceptance so that instances of data rejection can be minimised. The reasons \nfor rejection need to be parameterised and circulated among the UCBs concerned. Rejection reports \nshould be mad e simple and understandable so that they can be used for fixing reporting and data level \nissues. UCBs should rectify the rejected data and upload the same with the CICs within seven days of \nreceipt of such rejection report. \nvi. Data Quality Index :  A commo n Data Quality Index would assist UCBs in determining the gaps in \ntheir data and also move towards improving their performance over a period of time. In addition, they \nwould also be able to rank their own performance against that of their peers and identif y their relative \nposition. UCBs may adopt this Data Quality Index for assessing the quality of data submissions and \nmake efforts towards improving data quality and minimising data rejections, within a time period of six \nmonths. \nvii. Best Practices for UCBs : Every UCB should take into account the best practices as detailed \nin Appendix - C while formulating or reviewing the policy and procedure under the Credit Information \nCompanies (Regulation) Act, 2005 (CICRA) with the approval of their Board of Directors. \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \nAppendix - A \nUniform Credit Reporting Format for Consumer and Commercial Borrowers  \nA.

To start with, the Working \nGroup may take up on priority basis changes required in the commercial segment and also in the \nfollowing areas :  \ni. Additional Fields in Data Format :  Annex 5 of the Report contains certain additional fiel ds for \ninclusion in data format (field names and their benefits). Accordingly, except for priority sector indicator \nfield, other fields may be incorporated in the consumer data format. For vehicles, only vehicle make and \nregistration number would be compul sory and not the chassis number. The registration number of \nproperty registered with Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of \nIndia (CERSAI) needs to be added by the CICs.[Recommendation 8.10 (b)] \nii. Compromise Sett lements :  Data formats should include cases where compromise settlements have \ntaken place and the reason for such compromise settlements. [Recommendation 8.10 (c)] \niii. Detailed Product Classification :  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) should report detailed product \nclassification to the CICs, e.g., car loans, commercial vehicles and construction equipment vehicles, \nunder auto loans. CICs should also include the same in their reports to the UCBs. [Recommendation \n8.10 (d)] \niv. Information Regarding Relationship / Guarantor :  UCBs should capture certain information \npertaining to relationship / guarantor fields of the Corporates viz. the Business category / type, Mobile / \nTelephone number, State / PIN -code / Country in their Core Banking Solutions / System and re port the \nsame to the commercial bureau of the CICs. [Recommendation 8.10 (e)] \nv. Members of Self Help Groups (SHG) :  Credit information on individual members of SHGs is critical \nto establish their credit history which would in turn foster growth of credit to the sector and promote \nfinancial inclusion. Therefore, UCBs may obtain data on individual members of SHGs and start reporting \nthe same to CICs within six months. [Recommendation 8.10 (f)] \nvi. Cross Reporting :  Guidelines for cross reporting, e.g., where individual is borrower and corporate is \nco-borrower, or vice versa, should be clearly intimated by CICs. The formats have fields to incorporate \nthe data where consumer data will be reported in the consumer bureau and co- borrower will be reported \nin commer cial bureau. [Recommendation 8.10 (h)] \nvii. Reporting Days Past Due :  UCBs are mandated to report Days Past Due (DPD), for the credit \nfacilities extended by them to consumers and corporates, while reporting to the CICs. [Recommendation \n8.10 (i)] \nviii. Treatment of Part Instalment Due :  UCBs are required to submit data as it is while qualitative \ninformation on what filters to apply based on amount and period could be done by the specified users \nand others who make use of the data. [Recommendation 8.10 (j)] \nix. Income Data: Income data of the borrowers under the consumer bureau may continue to be reported \nby the UCBs to the CICs. [Recommendation 8.10 (k)] \nx. Identification Numbers :  In the commercial segment, corporate identification number (CIN) and credit \nhistory of the directors of the company (based on DIN number) should be reported by the UCBs to the \nCICs and included by the CICs in their reports. [Recommendation 8.10 (l)] \nxi. Software for Reporting :  RBI is generally in agreement that there should be only  one format for \nuploading and reverting reject data from the CIC as conversions / reconversions between formats like \nExcel / TUDF / Notepad, etc., during the process of furnishing data create validation issues. However, \nthe Technical Working Group [please see paragraph 2 (iv) of the circular] of banks, CICs, NBFCs, etc. \nmay further deliberate on this issue and make suitable suggestions, if considered necessary to RBI in \nthis regard. [Recommendation 8.10 (m)]   \nxii. Written -off and Settled Status of Accounts :  While reporting their credit data, UCBs should use \n'settled' status for denoting only specific situations where due to financial inability to repay as per original \nterms and conditions, either a principal or an interest waiver or both is provided to the c ustomer. UCBs \nneed to be aware of such a situation prior to extending fresh credit to such a customer. Cases of wrong \ndebits or contested charges should not be reported by UCBs as 'settled' but as 'disputed' as per the new \nfield suggested for inclusion in the data format at Annex 5 of the Report. [Recommendation 8.12 (b)] \nxiii. Major Reasons for Restructuring :  This field in the commercial data format helps in understanding \nwhether the restructuring of loan of the borrower was due to external/extraneous fac tors such as external \nenvironment, general downturn in economy, etc., or company / borrower specific issues such as change \nin management, performance of promoters, etc. [Recommendation 8.13 (c)] \nxiv. Minimum of One Identifier Field in Data :  Data submitted by UCBs should be populated with at \nleast one of the identifier fields, viz., PAN Card No., Passport No., Driving Licence No., Voter ID Card \nNo., Aadhaar No., Telephone number, etc. [Recommendation 8.15] \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n    \n \n  \n \n   \nAppendix  - C \n \nBest Practices for Urban Cooperative Banks \nEvery UCB should take the following best practices into account while formulating or reviewing the policy \nand procedure under the CICRA with the approval of their Board of Directors: \ni. UCBs should ensure that the reco rds submitted to CICs are updated regularly and that no instances of \nrepayment, including that of the last instalment, are left unreported. \nii. Instances of non-updation of repayment information could be avoided by centralising the issue of NOCs \nand providing information to CICs. \niii. All UCBs should have nodal officers for dealing with CICs. \niv. Customer grievance redressal should be given top priority especially in resp ect of complaints relating \nto updation/alteration of credit information.  \nv. Grievance redressal in respect of credit information should be integrated with the existing systems for \ngrievance redressal. Aspects relating to customer grievances pertaining to c redit information may also \nbe an integral part of customer service policy of UCBs.  \nvi. UCBs should abide by the period stipulated under CICRA and the Rules and Regulations framed \nhereunder in respect of updation, alteration of credit information, resolving disputes, etc. Procedure \nprescribed under Rule 20 and 21 of the Credit Information Companies Rules, 2006 in this regard should \nbe adhered to. Deviations from stipulated time limits should be monitored and commented upon in the \nperiodical reports/reviews put up to the Board/Committees of Board on customer service. \nvii. Updation of credit information should take place on a monthly basis or at such shorter intervals as \nmay be mutually agreed upon between the UCB and the CIC. \nviii. All UCBs should give full cu stomer information to the CICs. For instance, identifier information like \nPAN No., Aadhaar No., Voters ID Card No., etc., is not provided by UCBs for all records. \nix. UCBs should mandate the usage of CIRs in their credit appraisal process.  \nx. First time borrowers\u2019 loan applications should not be rejected just because they have no credit history.  \nxi. UCBs and CICs should ensure that the credit records of borrowers are regularly updated by UCBs \nand that issues such as where repayment of the last instalment of a loan does not get reported does not \narise. [Recommendation 8.31] \nxii. With a view to decreasing court cases involving UCBs and CICs, complaints need to be addressed \nby them on an urgent basis. UCBs and CICs should have a structured process of complaint redressal for \nwhich a Consumer Protection Committee under the Board should be constituted. [Recommendation 8.34]  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n  \n \nAnnex \u2013 7 \n[vide paragraph 5.1.3]  \nCredit information reporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) members \nI. Structure of credit information collection and reporting \n1. The structure of the credit information in respect of SHG members to be collected and reported by \nbanks to the CICs is set out below. \n1 Information to be collected by banks from individual SHG \nmembers where the total  amount of loan to be attributed to or to \nbe availed by the SHG member exceeds Rs.30,000/- Table 1  \n2 Information to be collected by banks from individual SHG \nmembers where the total amount of loan to be attributed to or to \nbe availed by the SHG member is upto Rs.30,000/- Table 2  \n3 Information on all individual SHG members to be reported by \nbanks to CICs  Table 3  \n4 Information on individual SHG members to be collected by banks \nat the time of opening of new Savings Bank Accounts of the SHG  Table 4  \n2. The data tables are given in the Appendix  D. As indicated above, banks shall collect information from \nall SHG members in Tables 1 and 2 and report it to the CICs as set out in Table 3. The tables have been \ndesigned based on the following considerations:  \n(i) Some of the information (Item number 17 of Tables 1 and 2) is related to the existing exposures of the \nSHG members including that of the SHG groups with whom they might have been previously associated. \nThis is intended to help ba nks make informed credit decisions with regard to the SHG members. This \ninformation may be collected by banks directly from the CICs based on lead information provided by the \nSHG members. Hence, there would be no need for banks to include this information in the dataset \nreported to the CICs as per Table 3.  \n(ii) The information requirements will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will commence from \n1 July 2016 and last for one year. The depth of the credit-related information to be collected would  \nincrease in Phase II to be implemented from 1 July 2017. Additions/modifications to be effected during \nPhase II are indicated in the last column of Tables 1 and 2.  \n(iii) The collection and reporting of credit information in respect of SHG members will be restricted to the \nmembers of those SHGs that take bank loans exceeding Rs. 1,00,000/- . However, the members of all \nSHGs, regardless of the amount of group loan, shall report the non- credit information to banks through \nthe SHG Group at the time when the SHG  approaches the bank for a loan. \n(iv) Subject to (iii) above, the credit information requirements for SHG members having a share above \nRs. 30,000 or more in the SHG loan is more detailed than that in respect of those upto Rs. 30,000. The \ndifference will be reduced, though not totally eliminated, as some more details are added to the latter in \nPhase II. \n(v) The non- credit information requirements have been designed both from the perspective of \nidentification of the individual borrowers and supplementing the information requirements of banks, \nregulatory and government development agencies for the purpose of evaluating the flow of credit to \nvarious sub- segments of the SHG members and designing suitable credit penetration strategies keeping \nin view the socio-economic profile of the sub- segments. The information shall be reported by banks to \nthe CICs in a manner that allows the CICs to identify all members associated with a particular SHG and \na particular person to be identified with all SHGs with whom he/she is/was associated.   \n3. Banks shall put in place necessary systems and procedures including making necessary changes to \ntheir system software so as to be able to begin collection of the relevant information from the SHG \nmembers and reporting the required informa tion to the CICs from 1 July 2016 (Phase I) and 1 July 2017 \n(Phase II). \n4. Banks have the option to collect and report the SHG member level data either themselves or by \noutsourcing it to other entities. However, banks shall follow all general instructions on outsourcing set out \nin DBR circular No.BP.40/21.04.158/2006-07 dated November 3, 2006  as amended from time to time to \nthe extent applicable and shall continue to be responsible for the correctness of the data submitted by \nthe outsourced agencies to the CICs. Banks must put in place appropriate controls to ensure the \ncorrectness of the data submitted by the entities to which it is outsourced.  \n5. Banks shall immediately  start monitoring the NPA levels in the SHG segment on an ongoing basis, if \nnot being already done, and collect detailed information from SHG members availing of loans exceeding \na lower threshold of Rs. 20,000, if the gross NPA in the SHG segment exceeds 1 0% or is higher than \nthe total gross NPA of the bank by 5 percentage points.  \n6. Non-adherence to the above instructions by Urban Cooperative Banks shall result in exclusion of non-\ncompliant SHG loan accounts from the loan portfolios eligible to be reckoned for the purpose of complying \nwith the Priority Sector Loan (PSL) targets. The determination with regard to loans qualifying for PSL \nbenefit would be made at the end of each phase, based on a review of the compliance with the credit \nand non-credit information requirements as applicable to that phase.  \nII. Other operational instructions \n7. At this stage, it is envisaged to capture details of only the credit facilities availed of by the SHG member \nfrom the banks and MFIs. Therefore, any information relating to inter- loaning among the SHG members \nout of their own savings will not be covered. However, in order to know the overall indebtedness of a \nSHG member it may be necessary to know their exposures to the SHGs with regard to inter -loaning as \nwell. As part of t he continued endeavour to improve the quality of information of a SHG member, the \nneed for capturing the inter -loaning would be reviewed after stabilisation of Phase II.  \n8. Given significant challenges in monitoring and reporting the performance of individ ual loans availed \nby the SHG members out of the amounts lent by banks to the SHGs, it is also not envisaged to extend \nthe credit reporting system to the monitoring of repayment and recovery of these loans. However, this \nwill also be considered after Phase II has taken ground. \n9. With a view to building up the adequate information base of the potential SHG member borrowers, \nand expediting the process of collection and reporting of KYC compliant information relating to the \nmembers of the SHGs when the SHGs are credit- linked, banks are encouraged to offer Small Accounts/ \nBasic Savings Bank Deposit Account to the SHG members when an SHG approaches them for opening \nits Savings Account. In cases where the SHG members agree to open such accounts, the information in  \nTable 4 may be collected and kept on record to be used at the time when the SHG approaches the bank \nfor a loan. However, it must not be made a pre-condition for opening the Savings Account of the SHG.  \n10. None of the data requirements specified in this circular should be made a pre- condition for extending \nloans to the SHGs, though banks must make sincere efforts to comply with these requirements. \n11. Banks may encourage the SHGs to keep written records of loans distributed to their members out of \nthe bank loan including the digitization scheme for SHGs of NABARD, where applicable, and may \nconsider introducing appropriate incentives in this regard. \n12. Banks shall develop appropriate policies to deal with applications for credit facilities from members \nof SH Gs/SHGs on whom default is reported by the CICs. Care needs to be taken that the SHGs/individual \nmembers are not denied loans merely because of such defaults and banks should appropriately evaluate \nthe credit history of the members themselves and take into account the economic viability of their \nactivity/ies and the Groups\u2019 capacity to service the loan proposed to be taken by considering their loan \napplications.   \n13. The credit information relating to individual SHG members shall be collected, reported and \ndisseminated as per the provisions of the Credit Information Companies (Regulations) Act, 2005 and the \nextant RBI directions on credit information reporting by banks and MFIs. \nIII. Specific instructions to the CICs \n14. The CICs shall make the necessary chan ges in their systems and procedures to implement the above \ndirections as per the timelines indicated above. \n15. CICs shall formulate appropriate policies with the approval of their Boards to share the credit \ninformation relating to SHGs or SHG members, on an aggregate basis with the Government agencies, \nNABARD, banks and MFIs for the purpose of credit planning and research. In accordance with their \nboard approved policies, the CICs could also share the aggregate information with other parties for the \npurpos e of undertaking research that could potentially benefit the SHG segment. The aggregate \ninformation shall be shared in a manner that is non- discriminatory and respects the confidentiality of the \nindividual SHG groups and the SHG members as per the relevant laws of the country.  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \nAppendix D2 \nInformation to be collected by banks \nTable 1: Information to be collected from individual SHG members where the total amount of \nloan to be attributed to or to be availed by the SHG member exceeds Rs. 30, 0003 \n \nParticulars required  Particulars provided  Basis  Modifications \nduring Phase II  \nI.

With the approval of their boards, the banks with Gross NPA ratio exceeding \n10% in the SHG loan segment may fix a lower threshold for collecting the information/data indicated in this Table and the next one. This amount will not include any subsidy or margin out of the member\u2019s own savings that goes \ntowards funding the activity or the purpose for which the loan is taken (both either back end or front end).  \n4 The banks may specifically see if any of the SHG members would fall within the purview of DBR circular DBR. \nAML.BC.No.15/14.01.001/2015- 16 dated 1 July 2015  r elating to introduction of simplified measures for proof of \nidentity by RBI and offer Small Deposit Accounts/Basic Saving Bank Deposit Account to them.

Opening of DBUs \u2013 General Permission  \n4.1 S cheduled Commercial Banks (other than RRBs, PBs and LABs ) with past digital \nbanking experience are permitted to open DBUs  in Tier 1 to Tier 6 centres , unless \notherwise specifically restricted, without having the need to take permission from \nReserve Bank of India in each case.  \n4.2 The DBUs of the banks will be treated as Banking Outlets (BOs) as defined in para \n3.1.1 of Annex to RBI circular DBR.No.BAPD.BC.69/22.01.001/2016- 17 dated May 18, \n2017 on \u201c Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy - Revision of Guidelines \u201d. For \nthe purpose of compliance with regulatory requirements on opening of BOs during a \nfinancial year, the DBUs will be treated as opened in a centre from where the significant \nparts  of its new business are proposed to be sourced, regardless of its physical location.  \n5. Infrastructure and Resources \n5.1 Each  DBU shall be housed distinctly , with the separate entry and exit provis ions. \nThey will be separate from an existing Banking Outlet  with formats and designs most \nappropriate for digital banking users .  \n5.2 For front -end or distribution layer of digital banking, each bank would choose \nsuitable smart  equipment, such as Interactive Teller Machines, Interactive Bankers, \nService Terminals, Teller and Cash Recyclers, Interactive Digital Walls, Document \nuploading, self -service card issuance devices, Video KYC Apparatus, secured and \nconnected environment for use of own device for digital banking, Video Call / \nConferencing facilities,  to set up an DBU . These facilities can be insourced or \noutsourced while complying with relevant regulatory guidelines.  \n5.3 The back -end including the Core Banking System and other back office related \ninformation systems for the digital banking products and services can be shared with \nthat of  the incumbent systems  with logical separation. Alternatively , banks can adopt \nmore core- independent  digital -native technologies offering better scalability, flexibility in \ncreating new / reusable digital environments through continuous development / software  \n4 \n \n deployment and interconnectivity specifically for this business segment, based on their \ndigital strategy.   \n5.4 If the digital banking segment of a bank uses an API layer (integration layer) to \nconnect with external third- party application providers, the same should be tested in an \nisolated/ test environment before being integrated to bank\u2019s core systems backed by  \ncomprehensive risk evaluation and adequate documentation.   \n5.5 Banks are free to adopt an in- sourced or out -sourced model for operations of the \ndigital banking segment including DBUs. The outsourced model should specifically \ncomply with the relevant regulatory guidelines on outsourcing.  \n5.6 As the purpose of DBUs is to optimally blend digital infrastructure with \u2018human \ntouch\u2019, remote or in situ assisted mode arrangements  in right proportion should be \nplanned and put in place by the banks.  \n5.7 The establishment of DBUs should be part of the digital banking strategy of the \nbank. The operational governance and administrative structure of the DBUs will be \naligned with that of the Digital Banking Segment of the bank.  However, in order to \naccelerate digital banking initiatives, each DBU will be headed by a sufficiently senior  \nand experienced executive of the bank, preferably Scale III or above for PSBs or \nequivalent grades for other banks who can be designated as the Chief Operating Officer \n(COO) of the DBU.  \n6. Cyber Security  \nIn addition to ensuring physical security of the infrastructure of the DBU, adequate \nsafeguards for cyber security of the DBUs will have to be ensured by the banks.  \n7. Products and Services \n7.1 Each DBU must offer certain minimum digital banking products and services . Such \nproducts should be on both liabilities and assets side of the balance sheet of the digital \nbanking segment.  Digitally value -added services to conventional products would also \nqualify as such.  The DBUs are expected to migrate to more structured and custom made \nproducts, from standard offerings by use of its hybrid and high quality interactive \ncapabilities.   \n5 \n \n 7.2 An illustrative list of minimum bouquet of products / services and self-service \nfulfilment services  that can be offered in the DBU is given in the APPENDIX . However, \nthe banks have the freedom to offer any other digital product or service in addition to  \nthe minimum bouquet to cater to the specific needs of the service area. Any product or \nservice that can be provided digitally through internet banking or mobile banking can be \nprovided in the DBU. Any product or service which a bank is not permitted to offer as \nper the provisions of Banking Regulation Act 1949, as amended from time to time, shall \nnot be offered by the DBU.  \n8. Digital Banking Customer Education:  In addition to onboarding of customers  in a \nfully digital environment , various tools  and methods shall be used by DBUs to  offer \nhands -on customer education on safe digital banking products and practices for \ninducting customers to self -service digital banking services.  This effort has to be clearly \ntranslated to incremental digital penetration of the financial services a DBU is catering \nto and will have to be monitored. The district where the DBU is located will be the \ncatchment area for the purpose.  \n \n9. Digital Business Facilitator / Business Correspondent : The banks will have the \noptions to engage digital business facilitator / business correspondents in conformance \nwith  relevant regulations (Ref. Master Circular DBOD.No.BAPD.BC.7/22.01.001/2014 -\n15 dated July  01, 2014) t o expand the virtual footprint of DBUs.  \n10. Customer Grievances:  There should be adequate digital mechanism to offer real \ntime assistance and redress customer grievances arising from business and services \noffered by the DBUs directly or through Business Facilitators / Correspondents . \n11. Reporting Requirements  \n11.1 Banks shall report the Digital Banking Segment as a sub- segment within the \nexisting \u201cRetail Banking Segment\u201d in the format as specified under paragraph 4 of \nAnnexure II (Part B) of the Reserve Bank of India (Financial Statements \u2013 Presentation \nand Disclosures) Directions, 2021. It is clarified that the digital banking products / \nservices applicable to segments other than \u2018Retail Banking\u2019 need not be reported at this \nstage.    \n6 \n \n 11.2 Performance update with respect to DBU shall be furnished in a pre- defined \nreporting format (being separately issued) to Department of Supervision, Reserve Bank \nof India on monthly basis and in a consolidated form in Annual Report of the bank.  \n11.3 Banks shall furnish information relating to opening, closure, merger or shifting of \nDBUs online through Central Information System for Banking Infrastructure ( CISBI ) \nportal to Department of Statistics and Information Management (DSIM), RBI as advised \nvide RBI circular DBR.No.BAPD.BC.50/22.01.001/2018- 19 dated June 28, 2019  on \n\u2018Revision in Proforma and Reporting of Bank/  Banking Outlet (BO) details under CISBI.  \n12. Role of Board of Directors \n \n12.1 Expansion of digital financial services and financial inclusion being overarching \nobjectives of DBUs and in view of the operational flexibility given to banks in this domain, \nthe board should ensure provisions of regular on- site and off -site monitoring system \ncovering all aspects of the guidelines.  \n12.2 The Board or a Committee of the Board shall review the progress and key \nperformance indicators of digital banking services including that of DBU  separately  at \nsuitable periodicity.

General  \n1.1 In order to reflect a bank's actual financial health in its balance sheet and as per the recommendations \nmade by the Committee on Financial System (Chairman Shri M. Narasimham), the Reserve Bank has \nintroduced, in a phased manner, prudential norms for income recognition, asset classification and \nprovisioning for the advances portfolio of the banks.  \n1.2 Broadly, the policy of income recognition should be objective and based on record of recovery rather \nthan on any subjective considerations. Likewise, the classification of assets of banks has to be done on the \nbasis of objective criteria, which would ensure a uniform and consistent application of the norms. The \nprovisioning should gene rally be made on the basis of the classification of assets into different categories.  \n1.3 The requirements of the State Co- operative Societies Acts and / or rules made thereunder or other \nstatutory enactments may continue to be followed, if they are more stringent than those prescribed hereby.  \n2. Non -performing Assets (NPA)  \n2.1 Classification of Assets as Non -Performing  \n2.1.1 A non-performing asset is a loan or an advance where:  \n(i) Interest and / or installment of principal remain overdue1 for a period of more than 90 days in respect of \na Term Loan.  \n(ii) The account remains  'out of order'2 , in respect of an Overdraft / Cash Credit (OD/CC)  and all other  \nloan products being offered as an overdraft facility, including those not meant for business purposes and/or which entail interest repayments as the only credits.\n  \n(iii) The bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bills purchased and discounted.  \n(iv) In the case of direct agricultural advances as listed in Annex 1, the overdue norm specified at para 2.1. 3 \nwould be applicable. In respect of agricultural loans other than those specified in Annex 1, identification of \nNPAs would be done on the same basis as non -agricultural advances.  \n (v) Any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect of other \naccounts.  \n (vi) In addition, an account may also be classified as NPA in terms of certain specific provisions of this \nMaster Circular, including inter alia paragraphs 2.2.7 and clarifications provided under the frequently asked \nquestions (FAQs) in Annex -4. \n2.1.2 (A) The exact due dates for repayment of a loan, frequency of repayment, breakup between principal \nand interest, examples of SMA/NPA cl assification dates, etc. should be clearly specified in the loan \n                                                            \n1 Any amount due to the bank under any credit facility, if not paid by the  due date fixed by the bank,  becomes \noverdue.  \n2 An account should be treated as 'out of order ' if :  \ni. the outstanding balance in the CC/OD account remains continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit/drawing \npower for 90 days, or  \nii. the outstanding balance in the CC/OD account is less than the sanctioned limit/drawing power but there are no \ncredits continuously for 90 days, or the outstanding balance in the CC/OD account is less than the sanctioned \nlimit/drawing power but credits are not enough to co ver the interest debited during the previous 90 days period.  \nThe aforesaid \u2018previous 90 days period \u2019 is inclusive of the day for which the day- end process is being run.  agreement and the borrower should be apprised of the same at the time of loan sanction and also at the \ntime of subsequent changes, if any, to the sanction terms/loan agreement till full repay ment of the loan.  \n2.1.2 (B) Credit Card Accounts  \n(i) In credit card accounts, the amount spent is billed to the card us ers through a monthly statement with a \ndefinite due date for repayment. Banks give an option to the card users to pay either the full amount  or \na fraction of it, i.e., minimum amount due, on the due date and roll -over the balance amount to the \nsubsequent months\u2019 billing cycle.  \n(ii) A credit card account will be treated as non- performing asset if the minimum amount due, as mentioned \nin the statement, is not paid fully within 90 days from the payment due date mentioned in the statement.  \n(iii)  Banks shall report a credit card account as \u2018past due\u2019 to credit information companies (CICs) or levy \npenal charges, viz. late payment charges, etc., if any,  only when a credit card account remains \u2018past \ndue\u2019 for more than three days. The number of \u2018days past due\u2019 and late payment charges shall, however, \nbe computed from the payment due date mentioned in the credit card statement.  \n2.1.3 Agricultural Advance  \n(i) In respect of all direct agricultural advances , as specified in Annex 1:  \na) A loan granted for short duration crops will be treated as NPA, if the installment of principal or \ninterest thereon remains overdue for two crop seasons.  \nb) A loan granted for long duration crops will be treated as NPA, if the installment of principal or \ninterest thereon remains overdue for one crop season.  \n(ii) For the purpose of these guidelines, \"long duration\" crops would be crops with crop season longer than \none year and crops, which are not \"long duration\" crops would be treated as \"short duration\" crops.  \n(iii) The crop season for each crop, which means the period up to harvesting of the crops raised, would be \nas determined by the State Level Banker s' Committee in each state.  \n(iv) Depending upon the duration of crops raised by an agriculturist, the above NPA norms would also be \nmade applicable to agricultural term loans availed by him.  \n(v) Banks should ensure that while granting loans and advances, realistic repayment schedules are fixed \non the basis of cash flows / fluidity with the borrowers.  \n2.1.4 Identification of Assets as NPAs should be done on an ongoing basis  \n(i) The system should ensure that identification of NPAs is done on an on- going basis and accounts are \nclassified as NPA immediately , as soon as they turn into NPA as per the guidelines contained in this circular, \nwithout waiting till the end of quarter/financ ial year. Banks should also make provisions for NPAs as at the \nend of each calendar quarter i.e.  as at the end of March / June / September / December, so that the income \nand expenditure account for the respective quarters as well as the P&L account and bal ance sheet for the \nyear end reflects the provision made for NPAs.  \n(ii) The borrower accounts shall be flagged as overdue by bank s as part of their day -end processes for the \ndue date, irrespective of the time of running such processes. Similarly, classification of borrower accounts as SMA\n3 as well as NPA shall be done as part of day -end process for the relevant date and the SMA or \nNPA classification date shall be the calendar date for which the day end process is run. In other words, the \n                                                            \n3 Refer paragraph 2.1.6  date of SMA/NPA shall reflect the asset classification status of an account at the day -end of that calendar \ndate.  \nExample: If due date of a loan account is March 31, 2022, and full dues are not received before the \nbank  runs the day -end process for this date, the date of overdue shall be March 31 , 202 2. If it \ncontinues to remain overdue, then this account shall get tagged as SMA -1 upon running day -end \nprocess on April 30, 2022  i.e. upon completion of 30 days of being continuously overdue. \nAccordingly, the date of SMA -1 clas sification for that account shall be April 30, 2022 . \nSimilarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, it shall get tagged as SMA -2 upon running \nday-end process on May 30, 2022  and if continues to remain overdue further, it shall get classified \nas NPA upon running day -end process on June 29, 2022 . \n (iii) UCBs having total assets of \u20b92000 crore or above as on March 31, 2020 were required to implement \nsystem -based asset classification4 with effect from June 30, 2021.  \n(iv) UCBs having total assets of \u20b91000 crore or above but less than \u20b92000 crore as on March 31, 2020 and \nhaving self -assessed themselves as being under Level III or Level IV in terms of the circular \nDoS.CO/CSITE/BC.4083/31.01.052/2019- 20 dated December 31, 2019 on Comprehensive Cyber Security \nFramework for UCBs were required to implement system -based asset classification with effect from \nSeptember 30, 2021.  \n(v) UCBs which meet t he above criteria as at the end of the financial year 2020 -2021 or subsequent financial \nyears shall implement system -based asset classification within a period of six months from the end of the \nfinancial year concerned.  For smooth implementation of the system, such  UCBs may conduct pilot/parallel \nrun and evaluate the results for accuracy/integrity of the asset classification in compliance with the \napplicable RBI instructions so as to ensure that they are ready for implementation of the system -based \nasset classification from the appointed date.  \n(vi) UCBs not meeting the above criteria are also encouraged to voluntarily implement the system -based \nasset classification in their own interest.  \n2.1.5 Charging of Interest  at monthly  rests  \n(i) Banks should charge interest at monthly rests in the context of adoption of 90 days norm for recognition of loan impairment w.e.f. from the year ended March 31, 2004 and consequential need for close monitoring \nof borrowers' accounts.  \n(ii) The  charging / compounding of interest on agricultural advances would be linked to crop seasons and \nthe instructions regarding charging of interest on monthly rests shall not be applicable to agricultural \nadvances.  \n(iii) Banks should take into consideration due date/s fixed on the basis of fluidity with borrowers and \nharvesting / marketing season while charging interest and compound the same if the loan / installment \nbecomes overdue in respect of short duration crops and allied agricultural activities.  \n2.1.6  Classification as Special Mention Account (SMA) and Reporting of Large Exposures to Central \nRepository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) - UCBs   \nSMA is an account which is exhibiting signs of incipient stress resulting in the borrower defaulting in ti mely \nservicing of her debt obligations, though the account has not yet been classified as NPA . As early \n                                                            \n4 \u2018System -based asset classification\u2019 would mean asset classification (downgrading as well as upgrading) carried out \nby the CBS / computerized systems of the bank in an automated manner on an ongoing basis, based on the relevant \nRBI instructions/guidelines.  recognition of such accounts enables  banks to initiate timely remedial actions to prevent their potential \nslippages into NPAs, all UCBs shall classify loans/advances accounts as SMA, as under:  \n \nSMA Sub -\ncategories  Basis for classification  \nPrincipal or interest payment or any other amount \nwholly or partially overdue for  \nSMA -0 Up to 30 days  \nSMA -1 More than 30 days and up  to 60 days  \nSMA -2 More than 60 days and up  to 90 days  \nIn case of revolving credit facilities like cash credit, the SMA sub- categories will be as follows:  \nSMA Sub -\ncategories  Basis for classification  \nOutstanding balance remains continuously in excess \nof the sanctioned limit or drawing po wer, whichever \nis lower, for a period of  \nSMA -1 More than 30 days and up  to 60 days  \nSMA -2 More than 60 days and up  to 90 days  \n(ii) The  above- mentioned instructions on classification of borrower accounts into SMA categori es are \napplicable for all loans , including retail loans, other than agricultural advances governed by crop season -\nbased asset classification norms, irrespective of size of exposure.  \n(iii) Primary (Urban) Co -operative Banks (UCBs) having total assets of \u20b9500 crore and above shall report \ncredit information, including classification of an account as Special Mention Account (SMA), on all \nborrowers having aggregate exposures of \u20b95 crore and above with them to Central Repository of \nInformation on Large Credits (CRILC) maintained by the Reserve Bank. Aggregate exposure shall include \nall fund- based and non- fund based exposure, including investment exposure on the borrower.  \n(iv) UCBs having total assets of \u20b9500 crore and above are required to submit CRILC Report on quarterly \nbasis with effect from  December 31, 2019. Detailed operating instr uctions have been issued vide circular \nDoS.OSMOS.No.4633/33.05.018/2019 -20 dated January 16, 2020 on \u2018Reporting of Large Exposures to \nCentral Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) \u2013 UCBs\u2019 by the Department of Supervision, \nReserve Bank of India.  (v) UCBs should take utmost care about data accuracy and integrity while submitting \nthe information /data on large credit to RBI, failing which penal action as per the provisions of the Banking \nRegulation Act, 1949 may be taken.  \n2.2 Treatment of Accounts as NPAs  \n2.2.1  Record of Recovery  \n(i) The treatment of an asset as NPA should be based on the rec ord of recovery. Banks should not treat an \nadvance as NPA merely due to existence of some deficiencies which are temporary in nature such as non-\navailability of adequate drawing power, balance outstanding exceeding the limit, non- submission of stock \nstatem ents and the non- renewal of the limits on the due date, etc. Where there is a threat of loss, or the \nrecoverability of the advances is in doubt, the asset should be treated as NPA.  \n(ii) A credit facility should be treated as NPA as per norms given in paragraph 2.1 above. However, where entire overdues pertaining to all the credit facilities availed by a borrower from a given bank  have been \nregularised by repayment through genuine sources (not by sanction of additional facilities or transfer of \nfunds between accounts), the accounts  may be upgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 asset category . In such cases, it \nshould, however, be ensured that the accounts remain in order subsequently and a solitary credit entry \nmade in an account on or before the balance sheet date which extinguishes the overdue amount of interest \nor installment of principal is not reckoned as the sole criteria for treatment of the account as a standard \nasset.   2.2.2  Treatment of NPAs - Borrower- wise and not Facility -wise  \n(i) In respect of a borrower having more than one facility with a bank, all the facilities granted by the bank \nwill have to be treated as NPA and not the particular facility or part thereof which has become irregular /NPA.  \n(ii) However, in respect of consortium advances or financing under m ultiple banking arrangements, each \nbank may classify the borrowal accounts according to its own record of recovery and other aspects having a bearing on the recoverability of the advances.  Each bank shall follow the principle at (i) above for NPA \nclassification of a borrower.  \n2.2.3  Agricultural Advances - Default in repayment due to Natural Calamities  \n(i) Where natural calamities impair the repaying capacity of agricultural borrowers, as a relief measure, \nbanks may decide on their own to :  \n(a) convert the short -term production loan into a term loan or re- schedule the repayment period, and  \n(b) sanction fresh short -term loans  \n(ii) In such cases of conversion or re -schedulement, the term loan as well as fresh short -term loan may be \ntreated as current dues and need not be classified as non- performing asset (NPA). The asset classification \nof these loans would, therefore, be governed by the revised terms and conditions and these would be \ntreated as NPA under the extant norms applicable for classifying agricultural  advances as NPAs.  \n2.2.4  Housing Loan to Staff  \nIn the case of housing loan or similar advances granted to staff members where interest is payable after \nrecovery of principal, interest need not be considered as overdue from the first month onwards. Such loans \n/ advances should be classified as NPA only when there is a default in repayment of instalment of principal \nor payment of interest on the respective due dates.  \n2.2.5  Credit facilities Guaranteed by Central / State Government  \n(i) The credit facilities ba cked by guarantee of the Central Government though overdue should not be \ntreated as NPA . \n(ii) This exemption from classification of government guaranteed advances as NPA is not for the purpose of recognition of income.  \n(iii) From the year ended March 31, 2 006, State Government guaranteed advance and investment in State \nGovernment guaranteed securities would attract asset classification and provisioning norms, if interest and \n/ or principal or any other amount due to the bank remains overdue for more than 90 days , irrespective of \nthe fact whether the guarantee have been invoked or not.  \n2.2.6  Project Financing  \n'Project Loan' would mean any term loan which has been extended for the purpose of setting up of an economic venture. Banks must fix a Date of Commencem ent of Commercial Operations (DCCO) for all \nproject loans at the time of sanction of the loan / financial closure (in the case of multiple banking or \nconsortium arrangements).  \nFor the purpose of Income Recognition and Asset Classification norms, all projec t loans may be divided \ninto the following two categories; (i) Project Loans for infrastructure sector (ii) Project Loans for non -\ninfrastructure sector. Detailed guidelines are given in Annex 8. In the case of bank finance given for  industrial projects where moratorium is available for payment of \ninterest, payment of interest becomes due only after the moratorium or gestation period is over . Therefore, \nsuch amounts of interest do not become overdue and hence NPA, with reference to the date of debit of \ninterest. They become overdue after due date for payment of interest, if uncollected  \n2.2.7  Prudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances  \nThe prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances are detailed a under:  \n(a) Asset Classifi cation Norms  \n2.2.7.1 Restructuring of advances could take place in the following stages:  \ni. before commencement of commercial production / operation;  \nii. after commencement of commercial production / operation but before the asset has been classified \nas 'sub -standard';  \niii. after commencement of commercial production / operation and the asset has been classified as \n'sub-standard' or 'doubtful'.  \n2.2.7.2 The accounts classified as 'standard assets' should be immediately re- classified as 'sub -standard \nassets' upon restruc turing.  \n2.2.7.3 The non performing assets, upon restructuring, would slip into further lower asset classification \ncategory as per extant asset classification norms with reference to the pre -restructuring repayment \nschedule.  \n2.2.7.4 All restructured account s which have been classified as non -performing assets upon restructuring, \nwould be eligible for upgradation to the 'standard' category after observation of 'satisfactory performance' \nduring the 'specified period' ( Annex 5).  \n2.2.7.5 In case, however, satisfactory performance during the specified period is not evidenced, the asset \nclassification of the restructured account would be governed as per the applicable prudential norms with \nreference to the pre-restructuring payment s chedule . \n2.2.7.6 Any additional finance may be treated as 'standard asset', up to a period of one year after the first \ninterest / principal payment, whichever is earlier, falls due under the approved restructuring package. However, in the case of accounts where the pre -restructuring facilities were classified as 'sub- standard' and \n'doubtful', interest income on the additional finance should be recognised only on cash basis. If the \nrestructured asset does not qualify for upgradation at the end of the above s pecified one year period, the \nadditional finance shall be placed in the same asset classification category as the restructured debt.  \n2.2.7.7 In respect of loan accounts which enjoy special regulatory treatment as per para 2.2.7.25 , upon \nrestructuring, such non -performing assets would continue to have the same asset classification as prior to \nrestructuring. In case satisfactory performance of the account is not evidenced during the 'specified period', \nit would slip into further lower  asset classification categories as per extant asset classification norms with \nreference to the pre-restructuring repayment schedule . \n2.2.7.8 In case a restructured asset, which is a standard asset on restructuring, is subjected to restructuring \non a subsequent occasion, it should be classified as substandard. If the restructured asset is a sub- standard \nor a doubtful asset and is subjected to restructuring, on a subsequent occasion, its asset classification will \nbe reckoned from the date when it became NPA on the first occasion. However, such advances restructured on second or more occasion may be allowed to be upgraded to standard category after one year from the date of first payment of interest or repayment of principal whichever falls due earlier in term s of the current \nrestructuring package subject to satisfactory performance.  \n(b) Income Recognition Norms  \n2.2.7.9 Subject to provisions of paragraphs 2.2.7.6 and 2.2.7.22 interest  income in respect of restructured \naccounts classified as 'standard assets' wi ll be recognized on accrual basis and that in respect of the \naccount classified as 'non performing assets' will be recognized on cash basis.  \n(c) Provisioning Norms  \n2.2.7.10 Normal Provisions  \nBanks will hold provision against the restructured advances on the basis of classification of assets into \nprescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 below  . \n2.2.7.11 Provision for Diminution in the Fair Value of restructured Advances  \nThe erosion in the fair value of the advance should be computed as the difference between the fair value \nof the loan before and after restructuring. Fair value of the loan before restructuring will be computed as \nthe present value of cash flows representing the interest at the existing rate charged on the advance before \nrestructuring and the principal, discounted at a rate equal to the bank's BPLR as on the date of restructuring \nplus the appropriate term premium and credit risk premium for the borrower category on the date of \nrestructuring\". Fair value of the loan after restructuring wi ll be computed as the present value of cash flows \nrepresenting the interest at the rate charged on the advance on restructuring and the principal, discounted \nat a rate equal to the bank's BPLR as on the date of restructuring plus the appropriate term premi um and \ncredit risk premium for the borrower category on the date of restructuring\".  \n2.2.7.12 It may please be noted that the above formula moderates the swing in the diminution of present \nvalue of loans with the interest rate cycle and will have to be foll owed consistently in future.  \n2.2.7.13 Further, it is reiterated that the provisions required as above arise due to the action of the banks \nresulting in change in contractual terms of the loan upon restructuring which are in the nature of financial concess ions. These provisions are distinct from the provisions which are linked to the asset classification \nof the account classified as NPA and reflect the impairment due to deterioration in the credit quality of the loan. Thus, the two types of the provisions are not substitute for each other.  \n2.2.7.14 It is also re- emphasised that the guidelines on restructuring of advances by RBI are aimed at \nproviding an opportunity to banks and borrowers to preserve the economic value of the units and should \nnot be looked at  as a means to evergreen the advances.  \n2.2.7.15 In their published annual Balance Sheets , banks shall make disclosures as per Annex -6  \n2.2.7.16 In the case of working capital facilities, the diminution in the fair value of the cash credit / overdraft \ncomponent may be computed as indicated in para 2.2.7.11 above, reckoning the higher of the outstanding \namount or the limit sanctioned as the principal amount and taking the tenor of the advance as one year. The term premium in the discount factor would be as applicable for one year. The fair value of the term loan \ncomponents (Working Capital Term Loan and Funded Interest Term Loan) would be computed as per \nactual cash flows and taking the term premium in the discount factor as applicable for the maturity of the \nrespective term loan components.  \n2.2.7.17 In the event any security is taken in lieu of the diminution in the fair value of the advance, it should \nbe valued at Re.1 This will ensure that the effect of charging off the economic sacr ifice to the Profit & Loss \naccount is not negated.  2.2.7.18 The diminution in the fair value may be re- computed on each balance sheet date till satisfactory \ncompletion of all repayment obligations and full repayment of the outstanding in the account, so as  to \ncapture the changes in the fair value on account of changes in BPLR, term  premium and the credit category \nof the borrower. Consequently, banks may provide for the shortfall in provision or reverse the amount of \nexcess provision held in the distinct acc ount.  \n2.2.7.19 If due to lack of expertise / appropriate infrastructure, a bank finds it difficult to ensure computation \nof diminution in the fair value of advances extended by small branches, as an alternative to the methodology \nprescribed above for computing the amount of diminution in the fair value, banks will have the option of \nnotionally computing the amount of diminution in the fair value and providing therefore, at five percent of \nthe total exposure, in respect of all restructured accounts where the total dues to bank(s) are less than \nrupees one crore.   \n2.2.7.20 The total provisions required against an account (normal provisions plus provisions in lieu of \ndiminution in the fair value of the advance) are capped at 100% of the outstanding debt amount.  \n(d) Prudential Norms for Conversion of Unpaid Interest into 'Funded Interest Term Loan' (FITL)  \n2.2.7.21 Asset Classification Norms  \nThe FITL created by conversion of unpaid interest will be classified in the same asset classification category \nin which the restructured advance has been classified. Further movement in the asset classification of FITL \nwould also be determined based on the subsequent asset classification of the restructured advance.  \n2.2.7.22 Income Recognition Norms  \n(i) The income, if any, generated may be recognised on accrual basis, if FITL is classified as 'standard', \nand on cash basis in the cases where the same has been classified as a non- performing asset.  \n(ii) The unrealised income represented by FITL should have a corresponding credit in an account styled as \n\"Sundry Liabilities Account (Interest Capitalization)\".  \n(iii) Only on repayment in case of FITL, the amount received will be recognized in the P&L Account, while simultaneously reducing the balance in the \"Sundry Liabilities Account ( Interest Capitalisation)\".  \n(e) Special Regulatory Treatment for Asset Classification \n2.2.7.23 The special regulatory treatment for asset classification, in modification to the provisions in this \nregard stipulated in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8,  will be available to the borrowers engaged in important business \nactivities, subject to compliance with certain conditions as enumerated in para 2.2.7.28  below . Such \ntreatment is not extended to the following categories of advances:  \n(i) Consumer and personal advances including advances to individuals against the securities of shares / \nbonds / debentures , etc. \n(ii) Advances to traders  \n2.2.7.24 The asset classification of the above two categories of accounts as well as that of other accounts \nwhich do not comply with the conditions enumerated in para 2.2.7.28 , will be governed by the prudential \nnorms in this regard described in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8 above.  \n(f) Elements of Special Regulatory Framework  \n2.2.7.2 5 The special regulatory treatment has the following two compone nts: (i) Incentive for quick implementation of the restructuring package.  \n(ii) Retention of the asset classification of the restructured account in the pre restructuring asset \nclassification category  \n2.2.7.2 6 Incentive for Quick Implementation of the Restr ucturing Package  \nDuring the pendency of the application for restructuring of the advance with the bank, the usual asset \nclassification norms would continue to apply. The process of reclassification of an asset should not stop \nmerely because the application is under consideration. However, as an incentive for quick implementation \nof the package, if the approved package is implemented by the bank within 90 days from the date of receipt \nof application by the bank, the asset classification status may be restore d to the position which existed \nwhen the restructuring application was received by the bank.  \n2.2.7.2 7 Asset Classification Benefits  \nSubject to the compliance with the undernoted conditions in addition to the adherence to the prudential framework laid down in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8:  \n(i) In modification to para 2.2.7.2, an existing 'standard asset' will not be downgraded to the sub- standard \ncategory upon restructuring.  \n(ii) In modification to para 2.2.7.3,  during the specified period, the asset classification of the sub -standard / \ndoubtful accounts will not deteriorate upon restructuring, if satisfactory performance is demonstrated during \nthe specified period.  \n2.2.7.2 8 However, these benefits will be available subject to compliance with the following conditions:  \ni) The dues to the bank are 'fully secured' as defined in Annex 5. T he condition of being fully secured by \ntangible security will not be applicable in the following cases :  \n(a) SSI borrowers, where the outstanding is up to \u20b925 lakh.  \n(b) infrastructure projects, provided the cash flows generated from these projects are adequate for repayment of the advance, the financing bank(s) have in place an appropriate mechanism to \nescrow the cash flows, and also have a clear and legal first claim on these cash flows.  \n(c) WCTL created by conversion of the irregular portion of principal dues over the drawing power, \nsubjec t to the condition that provisions are made against the unsecured portion of the WCTL, as \nunder :  \n\u2022 Standard Assets : 20%  \n\u2022 Substandard Assets : 20% during the first year and to be increased by 20% every year \nthereafter until the specified period (one year aft er the first payment is due under the \nterms of restructuring)  \n\u2022 If the account is not eligible for upgradation after the specified period, the unsecured \nportion will attract provision of 100% . \nii) The unit becomes viable in 10 years, if it is engaged in infrastructure activities, and in 7 years in the case \nof other units.  \niii) The repayment period of the restructured advance including the moratorium, if any, does not exceed 15 years in the case of infrastructure advances and 10 years in the case of other advances. The Board of \nDirectors of the banks should prescribe the maximum period not exceeding 15 years for restructured \nadvances keeping in view the safety and soundness of advances.  iv) Promoters' sacrifice and additional funds brought by them should be a minimum of 15% of banks' \nsacrifice.  \nv) Personal guarantee is offered by the promoter except when the unit is affected by external factors \npertaining to the economy and industry.  \nvi) The restructuring under consideration is not a 'repeated restructuring' as defined in para (iv) of  Annex 5.  \n(g) Disclosures  \n2.2.7. 29 Banks should disclose in their published annual Balance Sheets, under 'Notes on Accounts', \ninformation relating to number and amount of advances restructured and the amount of diminution in the \nfair value of the restructured advances in Annex 6.  \n(h) Illustrations  \n2.2.7.3 0 A few illustrations on the asset classification of restructured accounts are given in Annex 7.  \n2.2.7.31 Resolution of Covid- 19 related stress implemented under the following circulars shall be subject \nto the specific requirements , including the prudential requirements, specified therein:  \n(i) DOR.No.BP.BC/3/21.04.048/2020 -21 dated August 6, 2020 on \u201cResolution Framework for COVID -19-\nrelated Stress\u201d read with DOR.No.BP.BC/13/21.04.048/ 2020- 21 dated September 7, 2020  on \u201cResolution \nFramework for COVID -19-related Stress \u2013 Financial Parameters\u201d;  \n(ii) DOR.No.BP.BC/4/21.04.048/2020- 21 dated August 6, 2020 on \u201cMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises \n(MSME) sector \u2013 Restructuring of Advances\u201d;  \n(iii) DOR.STR.REC.11/21.04.048/2021- 22 dated May 5, 2021 on \u201cResolution Framework \u2013 2.0: Resolution \nof Covid- 19 related stress of Individuals and Small Businesses\u201d read with \nDOR.STR.REC.20/21.04.048/2021- 22 dated June 4, 2021 on \u201cResolution Framework - 2.0: Resolution of \nCovid -19 related stress of Individuals and Small Businesses \u2013  Revision in the threshold for aggregate \nexposure\u201d;  \n(iv) DOR.STR.REC.12/21.04.048/2021 -22 dated May 5, 2021 on \u2018Resolution Framework 2.0 \u2013 Resolution \nof Covid- 19 related stress of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)\u2019 read with \nDOR.STR.REC.21/21.04.048/2021- 22 dated June 4, 2021 on \u2018Resolution Framework - 2.0: Resolution of \nCovid -19 related stress of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) \u2013 Revision in the threshold for \naggregate exposure\u2019  \n2.2.7.32 MSME accounts restructured  under the circulars DBR.No.BP.BC.18/21.04.048/2018- 19 dated \nJanuary 1, 2019 and DOR.No.BP.BC.34/21.04.048/2019 -20 dated February 11, 2020 shall be subject to \nthe prudential requirements specified therein.  \n2.2.8  Other Adva nces  \n(i) Advances against term deposits, NSCs eligible for surrender, KVPs and Life policies need not be treated \nas NPAs although interest thereon may not have been paid for more than 90 days , provided adequate \nmargin is available in the accounts.  \n(ii) Banks should fix monthly / quarterly instalments for repayment of gold loans for non -agricultural \npurposes taking into account the pattern of income generation and repayment capacity of the borrowers \nand such gold loan accounts may be treated as NPAs if instalments of principal and / or interest thereon \nare overdue for more than 90 days.  (iii) As regards gold loans granted for agricultural purposes, interest is required to be charged as per \nSupreme Court judgment at yearly intervals and payment should coincide with the harvesting of crops. \nAccordingly, such advances will be treated as NPA only if instalments of principal and / or interest become \noverdue after due date.  \n2.2.9  Recognition of Income on Investment Treated as NPAs  \nThe investments are also subject to the prudential norms on income recognition. Banks should not book income on accrual basis in respect of any security , irrespective of the category in which it is included, where \nthe interest / principal is in arrears for more than 90 days.  \n2.2.10 NPA Reporting to Reserve Bank  \nBanks should report the figures of NPAs to the Regional Office of the Reserve Bank at t he end of each year \nwithin two months from the close of the year in the prescribed proforma given in the Annex 2.  \n2.2.11 Consumer Education on SMA/NPA  \nWith a view to increasing awareness among the borrowers, banks  should place consumer education \nliterature on their websites, explaining with examples, the concepts of date of overdue, SMA and NPA \nclassification and upgradation, with specific reference to day -end process. Banks  should  also consider \ndisplaying such consumer education literature in their branches by means of posters and/or other \nappropriate media. Further, it shall also be ensured that their front -line officers educate borrowers about all \nthese concepts, with respect to loans availed by them, at the time of sanction/disbursal/renewal of loans.  \n3. Asset Classification  \n3.1 Classification  \n3.1.1 Banks should classify their assets into the following broad groups, viz. - \n(i) Standard Assets  \n(ii) Sub -standard Assets  \n(iii) Doubtful Assets  \n(iv) Loss Assets  \n3.2 Definitions  \n3.2.1  Standard Assets  \nStandard asset is one which does not disclose any problems and which does not carry more than normal \nrisk attached to the business. Such an asset should not be an NPA.  \n3.2.2  Sub-standard Assets  \nWith effect from March 31, 2005 an asset would be classified as sub- standard if it remained NPA for a \nperiod less than or equal to 12 months. In such cases, the current net worth of the borrowers / guarantors \nor the current market value of the security charged is not enough to ensure recovery of the dues to the \nbanks in full. In other words, such assets will have well defined credit weaknesses that jeopardise the \nliquidation of the debt and are characterised by the distinct possibility that the banks will sustain some loss, \nif deficie ncies are not corrected.  3.2.3  Doubtful Assets  \nWith effect from March 31, 2005, an asset is required to be classified as doubtful, if it has remained NPA \nfor more than 12 months. A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent as that classif ied \nas sub -standard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on \nthe basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.  \n3.2.4  Loss Assets  \nA loss asset is one where los s has been identified by the bank or internal or external auditors or by the Co-\noperation Department or by the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s  inspection but the amount has not been written off, \nwholly or partly. In other words, such an asset is considered un -collectible and of such little value that its \ncontinuance as a bankable asset is not warranted although there may be some salvage or recovery value.  \n3.3 Guidelines for Classification of Assets  \n3.3.1  Basic Considerations  \n(i) Broadly speaking, classification of assets into above categories should be done taking into account the \ndegree of well defined credit weaknesses .  \n(ii) In respect of accounts where there are potential threats to recovery on account of erosion in the value \nof security, it will not be prudent for the banks to classify them first as sub -standard and then as doubtful \nafter expiry of 12 months from the date the account has become NPA. Such accounts should be straight \naway classified as doubtful asset or loss asset, as appropriate, irrespective of the period for which they have remained as NPA.  \n3.3.2  Advances Granted under Rehabilitation Packages Approved b y Term Lending Institutions  \n(i) Banks are not permitted to upgrade the classification of any advance in respect of which the terms have \nbeen re -negotiated unless the package of re- negotiated terms has worked satisfactorily for a period of one \nyear. While t he existing credit facilities sanctioned to a unit under rehabilitation packages approved by term \nlending institutions will continue to be classified as sub- standard or doubtful , as the case may be,  in respect \nof additional facilities sanctioned under the rehabilitation packages , the income recognition and asset \nclassification norms will become applicable after a period of one year from the date of disbursement.  \n(ii) A similar relaxation be made in respect of SSI units which are identified as sick by banks themselves \nand where rehabilitation packages / nursing programmes have been drawn by the banks themselves or under consortium arrangements.  \n3.3.3  Internal System for Classification of Assets as NPA  \n(i)\n Banks may adhere to the timelines for implementation of system -based asset classification mentioned \nat paragraph 2.1.4 above.  \n(ii) Banks , which are not required to implement system -based asset classficiation in terms of the instructions \nat paragraph 2.1.4,  should establish appropriate internal systems to eli minate the tendency to delay or \npostpone the identification of NPAs, especially in respect of high value accounts. The banks may fix a \nminimum cut -off point to decide what would constitute a high value account depending upon their respective \nbusiness level s. The cut -off point should be valid for the entire accounting year.  \n(iii) Responsibility and validation levels for ensuring proper asset classification may be fixed by the bank.  (iv) The system should ensure that doubts in asset classification due to any reason are settled through \nspecified internal channels within one month from the date on which the account would have been classified \nas NPA as per extant guidelines.  \n(v) Banks should ensure scrupulous compliance with the instructions for recognition of cr edit impairment \nand view aberrations by dealing officials seriously.  \n(vi) RBI would continue to identify the divergences arising due to non- compliance, for fixing accountability. \nWhere there is wilful non -compliance by the official responsible for classification and is well documented, \nRBI would initiate deterrent action including imposition of monetary penalties.  \n4. Income Recognition  \n4.1 Income Recognition - Policy  \n4.1.1 The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of recovery. Income \nfrom non -performing assets (NPA) is not recognised on accrual basis but is booked as income only when \nit is actually received. Therefore, banks should not take interest on non- performing assets to their income \naccount on accrual basis.  \n4.1.2 However, interest on advances against term deposits, NSCs, KVPs and life insurance policies may \nbe taken to income account on the due date, provided adequate margin is available in the accounts.  \n4.1.3 Fees and commissions earned by the banks as a result of re- negotiations or rescheduling of \noutstanding debts should be recognised on an accrual basis over the period of time covered by the re-negotiated or rescheduled extension of credit.  \n4.1.4 If Government guaranteed advances remain 'overdue' for mo re than 90 days , the interest on such \nadvances should not be taken to income account unless the interest has been realised.  This shall be \napplicable in cases of both Central and State Government guaranteed accounts .  \n4.1.5 In cases of loans where moratorium has been granted for repayment of interest, banks  may recognize \ninterest income on accrual basis for accounts which continue to be classified as \u2018standard\u2019. This shall be \nevaluated against the definition of \u2018restructured accounts\u2019 provided at sl.no. (iii) of Annex -5 to this Master \nCircular  \n4.2 Reversal of Income on Accounts Becoming NPAs  \n4.2.1 If any advance,  including bills purchased and discounted , becomes NPA, interest accrued and \ncredited to income account, should be reversed or provided for , if the same is not realised This will also \napply to Government guaranteed accounts  which remain overdue for more than 90 days . \n4.2.2 However, if loans with moratorium on payment of interest (permitted at the time of sanction of the \nloan) become NPA after the moratorium period is over, the capitalized interest , if any,  corresponding to the \ninterest accrued during such moratorium period need not be reversed.  \n4.2.3 In respect of NPAs, f ees, commission and similar income that have accrued should cease to accrue \nin the current period and should be reversed with respect to past periods, if uncollected.  \n4.2.4 Banks undertaking equipment leasing should follow prudential accounting standards. Lease rentals \ncomprises of two elements - a finance charge (i.e. interest charge) and a charge towards recovery of the \ncost of the asset. The interest component alone should be taken to income account. Such interest component  taken to income account, before the asset became NPA, if unrealised should be reversed or \nprovided for.  4.3 Booking of Income on Investments in Shares & Bonds  \n4.3.1 As a prudent practice and in order to bring about uniform accounting practice among banks f or booking \nof income on units of UTI and equity of All India Financial Institutions, such income should be booked on \ncash basis and not on accrual basis.  \n4.3.2 However, in respect of income from Government securities / bonds of public sector undertakings and \nAll India Financial Institutions, where interest rates on the instruments are predetermined, income may be booked on accrual basis, provided interest is serviced regularly and is not in arrears.  \n4.4 Partial Recovery of NPAs  \nInterest realised on NPAs may  be taken to income account , provided the credits in the accounts towards \ninterest are not out of fresh / additional credit facilities sanctioned to the borrower concerned.  \n4.5 Interest Application  \n4.5.1 In case of NPAs , as a prudential norm, there is no use in debiting the said account by interest accrued \nin subsequent months  and taking this accrued interest amount as income of the bank as the said interest \nis not being received. It is simultaneously desirable to show such accrued interest separately or pa rk in a \nseparate account so that interest receivable on such NPA account is computed and shown as such, though not accounted as income of the bank for the period.  \n4.5.2 The interest accrued in respect of performing assets may be taken to income account as the interest \nis reasonably expected to be received. However, if interest is not actually received for any reason in these \ncases and the account is to be treated as an NPA, then the amount of interest so taken to income should \nbe reversed or should be provi ded for in full.  \n4.5.3 With a view to ensuring uniformity in accounting the accrued interest in respect of both the performing \nand non -performing assets, the following guidelines may be adopted notwithstanding the existing provisions \nin the respective S tate Co- operative Societies Act.  \n(i) Interest accrued in respect of non- performing advances should not be debited to borrowal accounts but \nshown separately under 'Interest Receivable Account' on the 'Property and Assets' side of the balance \nsheet and corresponding amount shown under 'Overdue Interest Reserve Account' on the 'Capital and \nLiabilities' side of the balance sheet.  \n(ii) In respect of borrowal accounts, which are treated as performing assets, accrued interest can alternatively be debited to the borro wal account and credited to Interest account and taken to income \naccount. In case the accrued interest in respect of the borrowal account is not actually realised and the \naccount has become NPA , interest accrued and credited to income account should be reversed or provided \nfor. \n(iii) The illustrative accounting entries to be passed in respect of accrued interest on both the performing \nand non- performing advances are indicated in the Annex 3.  \n4.5.4 In the above context, it may be clarified that overdue interest reserve is not created out of the real or \nearned income received by the bank and as such, the amounts held in the Overdue Interest Reserve \nAccount cannot be regarded as 'reserve' or a part of the owned funds of the banks. It  will also be observed \nthat the Balance Sheet format prescribed under the Third Schedule to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \n(As Applicable to Co- operative Societies) specifically requires the banks to show 'Overdue Interest Reserve' \nas a distinct item on the 'Capital and Liabilities' side vide item 8 thereof.  \n 5. Provisioning Norms  \n5.1 Norms for Provisioning on Loans & Advances  \n5.1.1 In conformity with the prudential norms, provisions should be made on the non- performing assets on \nthe basis of classificati on of assets into prescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 above.  \n5.1.2 Taking into account the time lag between an account becoming doubtful of recovery, its recognition \nas such, the realisation of the security and the erosion over time in the val ue of security charged to the \nbank, the banks should make provision against loss assets, doubtful assets and sub -standard assets as \nbelow:  \n(i) Loss Assets \nThe entire assets should be written off after obtaining necessary approval from the competent authori ty and \nas per the provisions of the Co- operative Societies Act / Rules. If the assets are permitted to remain in the \nbooks for any reason, 100 per cent of the outstanding should be provided for.  \n \n(ii) Doubtful Assets  \n(a) Provision should be 100 per cent of  the extent to which the advance is not covered by the realisable \nvalue of the security to which the bank has a valid recourse. The realisable value should be estimated on \na realistic basis.  \n(b) In regard to the secured portion, provision may be made on the following basis, at the rates ranging \nfrom 20 per cent to 100 per cent of the secured portion depending upon the period for which the asset has \nremained doubtful:  \nTier I5 and Tier II6 Banks  \nPeriod for which the advance has remained in \n'doubtful' category  Provision \nRequirement  \nUp to one year  20 per cent  \nOne to three years  30 per cent  \nAdvances classified as 'doubtful for more than \nthree years' on or after April 1, 2010  100 percent  \n(iii) Sub-standard Assets  \nA general provision of 10 per cent on total outstanding should be made without making any allowance for \nECGC guarantee cover and securities available.  \n \n                                                            \n5 (i) Banks having deposits below \u20b9100 crore, operating in a single district.  \n \nii) Banks with deposits below \u20b9100 crore operating in more than one district, provided the branches are in contiguous \ndistricts and deposits and advances of branches in one district separately constitute at least 95% of the total deposits  \nand advances respectively of the bank.  \n \niii) Banks with deposits below \u20b9100 crore, whose branches were originally in a single district but subsequently, \nbecame multi -district due to reorganization of the district.  \n The deposits and advances as referred to  in the definition may be reckoned as on 31st March of the immediate \npreceding financial year.  \n6 Banks not qualifying as Tier I  (iv) Provision on Standard Assets  \n(a) Tier -I banks should make a general provision of a minimum of 0.25 per cent on standard assets.  \n(b) Tier  II banks shall maintain a general provision of minimum 0.40 per cent  for 'standard advances'. \nHowever, direct advances to agricultural and SME sectors which are standard assets, would attract a \nuniform provisioning requirement of 0.25 per cent of the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis, as hitherto.  \n(c) Both Tier I & Tier II  banks shall maintain a minimum provision of 1.00 percent in respect of advances to \nCommercial Real Estate Sector classified as 'standard assets'.  \n(d) Both Tier I and Tier II banks UCBs shall maintain a minimum provision of 0.75 percent in respect of \nadvances to Commercial Real Estate -Residential Housing (CRE -RH)7 Sector classified as 'standard \nassets'.   \n(e) The standard asset provisioning requirements for all UCBs are summarized as under:  \nCategory of Standard Asset  Rate of Provisioning  \nTier II  Tier I  \nDirect advances to Agriculture \nand SME sectors  0.25%  0.25%  \nCommercial Real Estate (CRE) \nsector  1.00%  1.00%  \nCommercial Real Estate -\nResidential Housing Sector \n(CRE -RH) 0.75%  0.75%  \nAll other loans and advances not \nincluded above  0.40%  0.25%  \n(f) The provisions towards \"standard assets\" need not be netted from gross advances but shown separately \nas \"Contingent Provision against Standard Assets\" under \"Other Funds and Reserves\" {item.2 (viii) of Capital and Liabilities} in the Balance Sheet.  \n(g) In case banks are already maintaining excess provision than what is required / prescribed by Statutory \nAuditor / RBI Inspection for impaired credits under Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve, additional provision \nrequired for Standard Assets may be segregated from Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve and the same may \nbe parked under the head \"Contingent Provisions against Standard Assets\" with the approval of their Board \nof Directors. Shortfall if any,  on this account may be made good in the normal course.  \n(h) The above contingent provision will be eligible for inclusion in Tier II capital.  \n(v) Higher Provisions  \nThere is no objection if the banks create bad and doubtful debts reserve beyond the specified limits on their own or if provided in the respective State Co- operative Societies Acts.  \n                                                            \n7 CRE-RH would consist of loans to builders/developers for residential housing projects (except for captive \nconsumption) under C RE segment. Such projects should ordinarily not include non- residential commercial real \nestate. However, integrated housing projects comprising some commercial space (e.g. shopping complex, school, \netc.) can also be classified under CRE -RH, provided that t he commercial area in the residential housing project does \nnot exceed 10% of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the \npredominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10%, the project l oans should be classified as CRE \nand not CRE -RH. 5.2 Provisioning for Retirement Benefits  \nBanks may have retirement benefit schemes for their staff, viz. Provident Fund, Gratuity and Pension. It is \nnecessary that such liabilities are estimated on actuarial basis and full provision should be made every year \nfor the purpose in their Profit and Loss Account.  \n5.3 Provisioning Pertaining to Fraud Accounts  \nWith effect from May 14, 2015, provisioning norm in respect of all cases of fraud identified in terms of the \nMaster Circular on Frauds - Classification and Reporting, as updated from time to time,  are as under:  \n5.3.1 The entire amount due to the bank  (irrespective of quantum of security held against such assets), or \nfor which the bank is liable (including in case of deposit accounts), is to be provided for over a period not \nexceeding four quarters commencing with the quarter in which the fraud has been detected;  \n5.3.2 However, where there has been delay  beyond the prescribed period, in reporting the fraud to Reserve \nBank, the entire provisioning is required to be made at once. In addition, Reserve Bank of India may also \ninitiate appropriate supervisory action where there has been delay by the bank in reporting a fraud or \nprovisioning there against.   \n5.4 Guidelines for Provisions in Specific Cases  \n(i) State Government guaranteed Advances  \nFrom the year ended March 31, 2006, State Government guaranteed advance and investment in State \nGovernment guaranteed securities would attract extant provisioning norms  on the basis of classification of \nassets into prescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 above.  \n(ii) Advances granted under Rehabilitation Packages approved by Term Lending Institutions  \n(a) The existing credit facilities sanctioned to a unit under rehabilitation package approved by term \nlending institutions, should continue to be class ified as sub -standard or doubtful asset as the case \nmay be.  \n(b) However, the additional facilities sanctioned as per package finalised by term lending \ninstitutions, the income recognition and asset classification norms will become applicable after a \nperiod of one year from the date of disbursement.  \n(c) In respect of additional credit facilities granted to SSI units which are identified as sick and \nwhere rehabilitation packages / nursing programmes have been drawn by the banks themselves \nor under consortium arrangements, no provision need be made for a period of one year.  \n(iii) Advances against fixed / term deposit, NSCs eligible for surrender, KVPs, and life policies are exempted \nfrom provisioning requirements.  \n(iv) Advances against gold ornaments, government securities and all other kinds of securities are not \nexempted from provisioning requirements.  \n(v) Advances covered by ECGC Guarantee  \n(a) In the case of doubtful assets which are guaranteed by ECGC, provision should be made only \nfor the balance in excess of the amount guaranteed by the Corporation. Further, while arriving at \nthe provisioning  required, realisable value of the securities should first be deducted from the \noutstanding balance in respect of the amount guaranteed by the Corporation and then prov ision \nmade as illustrated hereunder:  Example  \nOutstanding Balance  \u20b94 lakhs  \nECGC Cover  50 per cent  \nPeriod for which the advance has \nremained doubtful  More than 3 years  \nValue of security held (excludes \nworth of borrower / guarantor)  \u20b91.50 lakhs  \n \nProvision required to be made  \nOutstanding balance  \u20b94.00 lakhs  \nLess : Value of security held  \u20b91.50 lakhs  \nUnrealised balance  \u20b92.50 lakhs  \nLess : ECGC Cover (50% of \nunrealisable balance)  \u20b91.25 lakhs  \nNet unsecured balance  \u20b91.25 lakhs  \nProvision for unsecured portion \nof advance  \u20b91.25 lakhs (@ 100 per cent of \nunsecured portion)  \nProvision for secured portion of \nadvance (as on March 31 2005)  \u20b90.90 lakhs (@ 60 per cent of \nsecured portion of \u20b91.50 lakh).  \nTotal provision required to be \nmade  \u20b92.15 lakhs (as on March 31, \n2005).  \n(b) Banks have the option of following more stringent method of provisioning in respect of advances \ncovered by the guarantees of ECGC as compared to the method given above.  \n(vi) Advances covered by Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH)  \nIn case the advance covered by CRGFTLIH guarantee becomes non- performing, no provisions need to be \nmade towards the guaranteed portion of the housing loan. The amount outstanding in excess of the \nguaranteed portion should be provided for as per the extant guidelines on provisioning for non -performing \nadvances.  \n(vii) Interbank exposure of Primary (Urban) Co- operative Banks (UCBs) under All Inclusive \nDirections  \na) The interbank exposures arising from deposits placed by UCBs with a UCB under AID and their \nnon-performing exposures arising from discounted bills drawn under LCs issued by a UCB under \nAID shall be fully provided within five years at the rate of 20% annually. Further, the interest receivable on the deposits shall not be recognised as income by the UCBs.  \nb) If the UCBs choose to convert such deposits into long term perpetual debt instruments (e.g. Innovative Perpetual Debt Instrument - IPDI) which may be recognised as capital instrument under \na scheme of restructuring/ reviv al of a UCB under AID, provision on the portion of deposits \nconverted into such instruments shall not be required.  \n6. Transfer of Loan Exposures  \nThe asset classification and provisioning requirements in respect of transactions involving transfer of loans shall be as per the Reserve Bank of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021.  \n7. Clarification on certain frequently asked questions is given at  Annex 4.  \n   \nAnnex 1  \n(vide para 2.1.3)  \nDirect Finance to Agriculture  \n \n1.1 Finance to Individual Farmers for Agriculture and Allied Activities (Dairy, Fishery, Piggery, \nPoultry, Bee -keeping, etc.)  \nLoans to individual farmers [including Self Help Groups (SHGs) or Joint Liability Groups (JLGs), i.e. groups of individual farmers, provided banks maintain disaggregated data on such loans] engaged in Agriculture \nand Allied Activities, viz., dairy, fishery, animal husbandry, poultry, bee- keeping and sericulture (up to \ncocoon stage).  \n1.2 Loans to others [such as corporates, partnership firms and institutions] for Agriculture and \nAllied Activiti es (dairy, fishery, piggery, poultry, bee -keeping, etc.) up to an aggregate limit of 2 \ncrore per borrower for the following purposes:  \n(i) Short -term loans for raising crops, i.e. for crop loans. This will include traditional/non- traditional \nplantations, horticulture and allied activities.  \n(ii) Medium & long -term loans for agriculture and allied activities (e.g. purchase of agricultural implements \nand machinery, loans for irrigation and other developmental activities undertaken in the farm and \ndevelopment loans for allied activities).  \n(iii) Loans for pre- harvest and post -harvest activities viz. spraying, weeding, harvesting, sorting, grading \nand transporting of their own farm produce.  \n(iv) Loans to farmers up to \u20b950 lakh against pledge / hypothecation of agri cultural produce (including \nwarehouse receipts) for a period not exceeding 12 months, irrespective of whether the farmers were given \ncrop loans for raising the produce or not.  \n(v) Loans to small and marginal farmers for purchase of land for agricultural purposes.  \n(vi) Loans to distressed farmers indebted to non- institutional lenders, against appropriate collateral.  \n(vii) Export credit for exporting their own farm produce.  \n \n \n \n    Annex 2  \n(vide para 2.2.10)  \nProforma  \nName of the Bank  \nCategory Tier I / Tier II  \nClassification of Assets and Provisioning made  \nagainst Non -Performing Assets as on March 31, _______  \n(\u20b9 in lakh)  \nClassification of Assets  No. \nof \nA/Cs  Amount \nOutsta - \nnding Percenta\nge of \nCol.3 to \ntotal loan \noutsta - \nnding Provision \nrequired \nto be \nmade % \nAmount  Existing \nprovisio\nn at the \nbegin-  \nning of \nthe year  Provision\n- \ning made \nduring \nthe year \nunder \nreport  Total \nprovis\n- \nions \nas at \nthe \nend of \nthe \nyear Re- \nmarks  \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \nTotal loans and advances                    \nOf which                    \nA.

Accrued Interest on Performing Advances  \ni) It has been clarified in paragraph 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 (ii) of the Master Circular that accrued interest in respect \nof performing advances may be charged to borrowal accounts and taken to income account. Illustratively, if the accrued interest is \u20b910,000/ - in respect of performing advances of a borrower 'X' (cash credit, \noverdraft, loan account, etc.) the following entries can be passed in the Books of Account.  \n(Dr) Borrower's account \n(CC, OD loan)  \u20b910,000.00  \n(Cr) Interest account  \u20b910,000.00  \nii) In case the accrued interest of \u20b910,000/ - in respect of the borrowal account is not actually realised and \nthe account has become NPA, interest accrued and credited to income account should be reversed or provided for if the same is not realised by passing the following entries :  \n(Dr) P&La/c)  \u20b910,000.00  \n(Cr) Overdue Interest \nReserve Account  \u20b910,000.00  \niii) In case accrued interest is realised subsequently, the following entries may be passed:  \n(Dr) Cash / Bank account  \u20b910,000.00  \n(Cr) Borrower's Account (CC, \nOD, Loan)  \u20b910,000.00  \n(Dr) Overdue Interest Reserve \nAccount  \u20b910,000.00  \n(Cr) Interest account  \u20b910,000.00  \nII. Accrued Interest on Non- Performing Advances  \ni) Accrued interest in respect of non -performing advances may be debited to 'Interest Receivable Account' \nand corresponding amount credited to 'Overdue Interest Reserve Account'. For example, if the interest \naccrued in respect of Cash Credit / OD / Loan etc. account of a borrower 'Y' is \u20b920,000/ - the accounting \nentries may be passed as under :  \n(Dr) In terest Receivable \nAccount  \u20b920,000.00  \n(Cr) Overdue Interest \nReserve Account  \u20b920,000.00  \nii) Subsequently, if interest is actually realised, the following accounting entries may be passed :  \n(Dr) Cash / Bank Account  \u20b920,000.00  \n(Cr) Interest account  \u20b920,000.00  \n(Dr) Overdue Interest \nReserve Account  \u20b920,000.00  \n(Cr) Interest Receivable \nAccount  \u20b920,000.00  III. Accounting of Overdue Interest in Loan Ledgers & Balance Sheet  \ni) With a view to facilitating the banks to work out the amount of interest recei vable in respect of each non-\nperforming borrowal account, banks can consider opening a separate column in the individual ledger \naccounts of such borrowers and interest receivable shown therein. This would enable the banks to \ndetermine at a particular point  of time, the amount of interest actually to be recovered from the borrowers. \nTotal of the amounts shown under the separate columns in the loan ledgers would be interest receivable in \nrespect of non- performing advances and it would get reflected as such on the 'assets' side of balance sheet \nwith a corresponding item on the liabilities side of the balance sheet as 'Overdue Interest Reserve'.  \nii) Similarly, a separate column should be provided in the loan ledger in respect of performing advances for \nshowing a ccrued interest taken to income account .If the accrued interest is not realised and the account \nbecomes NPA, the amount has to be reversed or provided for . \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  Annex 4  \n(Clarification on certain frequently asked questions)  \n(vide para 7) \n1.

What should be the period for which the stock statements can be in arrears before the \naccount is treated as an NPA?  \nBanks should ensure that drawings in the working capital accounts are covered by the adequacy of current \nassets, since current assets are first appropriated in times of distress. Considering the practical difficulties \nof large borrowers, stock statements relied upon by the banks for determ ining drawing power should not \nbe older than three months. The outstanding in the account based on drawing power calculated from stock \nstatements older than three months would be deemed as irregular. A working capital borrowal account will \nbecome NPA if such irregular drawings are permitted in the account for a continuous period of 90 days .  \n2. Whether an account will become an NPA if the review / renewal of regular / ad- hoc credit limits \nare not done when due? What should be periodicity of review / renewal  to decide the present status \nof an account?  \nBanks shall adhere to the instructions contained in the Master Circular for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) \non Management of Advances \u2013 UCBs dated July 1, 2015, as updated from time to time, regarding the \nrequirement of policy for periodic review of the working capital limits. Further, banks shall also adhere to \nthe instructions issued vide circular DoS.CO.PPG.BC.1/11.01.005/2020 -21 dated August 21, 2020 on \u2018Ad-\nhoc/Short Review/Renewal of Credit Facilities\u2019, incuding inter alia  the requirement of  a detailed Board \napproved policy on methodology and periodicity for review/renewal of credit facilities within the overall \nregulatory guidelines and strict adherence to the same. An account where the regular / ad- hoc credit limits \nhave not been reviewed or have not been renewed within 90 days from the due date / date of ad- hoc \nsanction will be treated as NPA. In case of constraints such as non- availability of financial statements and \nother data from the borrowers, the branch should furnish evidence to show that renewal / review of credit \nlimits is already on and would be completed soon.  \n3. Regularisation of the account around the date of balance sheet - Whether it will be in order to \ntreat a borrowal account as 'standard', if it has been irregular for a major part of the year, but has been regularised near the balance sheet date?  \nThe asset classification of borrowal accounts where a solitary or a few credits are recorded before the \nbalance sheet date should be handled with care and without scope for subjectivity. Where the account \nindicates inherent weakness on the basis of the data available, the account should be deemed as a NPA. \nIn other genuine cases, the banks must furnish satisfactory evidence to the Statutory Auditors / Inspecting \nOfficers about the manner of regularisation of the account to eliminate doubts on their performing status.  \n4. Classification of NPAs where there is a threat to recovery  \nHow should the instructions on classification of NPAs straightaway as doubtful or a loss asset be \ninterpreted and what c an be termed as a 'significant credit impairment'?  \nAn NPA need not go through the various stages of classification in case of serious credit impairment and \nsuch assets should be straightway classified as a doubtful / loss asset as appropriate. Erosion in t he value \nof security can be reckoned as significant when the realizable value of the security is less than 50 per cent \nof the value assessed by the bank or accepted by RBI at the time of last inspection, as the case may be. \nSuch NPAs may be straightaway cl assified under doubtful category and provisioning should be made as \napplicable to doubtful assets.   \n 5. Classification of credit facilities under consortium  \nIn certain cases of consortium accounts, though the record of recovery in the account with a \nmember  bank may suggest that the account is a NPA, the banks submit that, at times, the borrower \nhas deposited adequate funds with the consortium leader / member of the consortium and the \nbank's share is due for receipt. In such cases, will it be in order for the member bank to classify the account as 'standard' in its books?  \nAsset classification of accounts under consortium should be based on the record of recovery of the \nindividual member banks and other aspects having a bearing on the recoverability of the adv ances. Where \nthe remittances by the borrower under consortium lending arrangements are pooled with one bank and / or \nwhere the bank receiving remittances is not parting with the share of other member banks, the account will \nbe treated as not serviced in the books of the other member banks, and therefore, be treated as NPA. The \nbanks participating in the consortium should, therefore, arrange to get their share of recovery transferred from the lead bank or get an express consent from the lead bank for the transfer of their share of recovery, \nto ensure proper asset classification in their respective books.  \n6. Appropriation of recoveries -  What is the practice to be adopted by banks regarding appropriation \nof recoveries in NPA accounts?  \nIn the absence of a clear  agreement between the bank and the borrower for the purpose of appropriation \nof recoveries in NPAs (i.e. towards Principal or interest due) banks should adopt an accounting principle \nand exercise the right of appropriation of recoveries in a uniform and c onsistent manner.  \n7. Overdues in other credit facilities -  There are instances where banks park the dues from a \nborrower in respect of devolved letters of credit and invoked guarantees in a separate account, irrespective of whether the borrower's credit fa cilities are regular or not. How to determine when \nthe account in which such dues are parked has become an NPA?  \nA number of banks adopt the practice of parking the dues of the borrower in respect of devolved letters of \ncredit and invoked guarantees in a separate account which is not a regular sanctioned facility. As a result \nthese are not reflected in the principal operating account of the borrower. This renders application of the \nprudential norms for identification of NPAs difficult. It is, therefore, advi sed that if the debts arising out of \ndevolvement of letters of credit or invoked guarantees are parked in a separate account, the balance \noutstanding in that account also should be treated as a part of the borrower's principal operating account \nfor the pur pose of application of prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and \nprovisioning.  \n8. Treatment of loss assets - An NPA account will be classified as a loss asset only when there is \nno security in the account or where there is considerable erosion in the realisable value of the security in the account. What can be termed as a 'considerable' erosion for the account to be classified as a loss asset?  \nIf the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank / approved valuer s / RBI is less than 10 per \ncent of the outstanding in the borrowal accounts, the existence of security should be ignored and the asset should be straightaway classified as loss asset. It may be either written off after obtaining necessary permission from the competent authority as per the Co- operative Societies Act / Rules, or fully provided for \nby the bank.  \n9. Valuation of Security -  A major source of divergence in provisioning requirement was the \nrealisable value of the primary and collateral security. C an uniform guidelines be prescribed for \nadoption in this area, at least for large value accounts?  \nWith a view to bringing down divergence arising out of difference in assessment of the value of security it \nhas been decided that in cases of NPAs with balanc e of \u20b910 lakh and above :  a) The current assets and their valuation are looked into at the time of Statutory Audit / Concurrent audit. \nHowever, in order to enhance the reliability on stock valuations, stock audit at annual intervals by external \nagencies co uld be considered in case of larger advances. The cut off limit and the names of the external \nagencies may be finalised by the Board.  \nb) Collaterals such as immovable properties charged in favour of the bank should be got valued once in \nthree years by valuers appointed as per the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.  \n \n            \n \n \n    \n \n   Annex 5  \nPrudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances  \nKey Concepts  \ni) Advances \nThe term 'Advances' will mean all kinds of credit facilities including cash credit, overdrafts, term loans, bills \ndiscounted / purchased, receivables, etc. and investments other than that in the nature of equity.  \nii) Fully Secured  \nWhen the amounts due to a bank (present value of principal and interest receivable as per restructure d \nloan terms) are fully covered by the value of security, duly charged in its favour in respect of those dues, \nthe bank's dues are considered to be fully secured. While assessing the realisable value of security, primary as well as collateral securities would be reckoned, provided such securities are tangible securities and are \nnot in intangible form like guarantee etc., of the promoter / others. However, for this purpose the bank \nguarantees, State Government Guarantees and Central Government Guarantees wil l be treated on par \nwith tangible security.  \niii) Restructured Accounts  \nA restructured account is one where the bank, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's \nfinancial difficulty, grants to the borrower concessions that the bank would not otherwise consider. \nRestructuring would normally involve modification of terms of the advances / securities, which would generally include, among others, alteration of repayment period / repayable amount / the amount of \ninstalments / rate of interest (due t o reasons other than competitive reasons).  \niv) Repeatedly Restructured Accounts \nWhen a bank restructures an account a second (or more) time(s), the account will be considered as a \n'repeatedly restructured account'. However, if the second restructuring takes place after the period up to \nwhich the concessions were extended under the terms of the first restructuring, that account shall not be \nreckoned as a 'repeatedly restructured account'.  \nv) SMEs  \nSmall and Medium Enterprises as defined in terms of the circular FIDD.MSME & \nNFS.BC.No.4/06.02.31/2020 -21 dated August 21, 2020 on \u2018New Definition of Micro, Small and Medium \nEnterprises \u2013 clarifications\u2019, as updated from time to time.  \nvi) Specified Period  \nSpecified Period means a period of one year from the date when the first payment of interest or installment \nof principal falls due under the terms of restructuring package.  \nvii) Satisfactory Performance  \nSatisfactory performance during the specified period means adherence to the following conditions during that period.  \n Non-Agricultural Cash Credit Accounts  \nIn the case of non- agricultural cash credit accounts, the account should not be out of order any time during \nthe specified period.  In addition, there should not be any overdues at the end of the specified period.  \nNon-Agricultural Term Loan Accounts  \nIn the case of non- agricultural term loan accounts, no payment should remain overdue for a period of more \nthan 90 days. In addition there should not be any overdues at the end of the specified period.  \nAll Agricultural Accounts  \nIn the case of agricultural accounts, at the end of the specified period the account should be regular.  \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n     \n  Annex 6  \n(vide para 2.2.7.29)  \nPrudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances  \nParticulars of Accounts Restructured  \n(\u20b9 in lakh)  \n  Housing \nLoans  SME Debt \nRestructuring  Others  \nStandard \nadvances \nrestructured  No. of Borrowers        \nAmount \noutstanding        \nSacrifice \n(diminution in the \nfair value)        \nSub standard \nadvances restructured  No. of Borrowers        \nAmount \noutstanding        \nSacrifice \n(diminution in the \nfair value)        \nDoubtful \nadvances restructured  No. of Borrowers        \nAmount \noutstanding        \nSacrifice \n(diminution in  the \nfair value)        \nTotal  No. of Borrowers        \nAmount \noutstanding        \nSacrifice \n(diminution in the \nfair value)        \nApplication for \nrestructuring which are under \nprocess,  package \nnot approved  No. of borrowers     \nAmount \noutstanding     \n \n     \n \n \n  \n Annex 7  \n(vide para 2.2.7.3 0) \nPrudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances  \nAsset Classification of Restructured Accounts under the Guidelines  \nParticulars  Case 1  Case 2  Case 3  Case 4  \nI.

Project Loans for Infrastructure Sector  \n1.1 A loan for an infrastructure project will be classified as NPA during any time before commencement of commercial operations as per record of recovery (90 days overdue), unless it is restructured and becomes \neligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras.1.3 and 1.4 below.  \n1.2 A loan for an infrastructure project will be classified as NPA if it fails to commence commercial \noperations within two years from the original DCCO, even if it is regular as per record of recovery, unless it \nis restructured and becomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras 1.3 and 1.4 \nbelow . \n1.3 There may be occasions when completion of projects is delayed for legal and other extraneous reasons \nlike delays in Government approvals etc. All these factors, which are beyond the control of the promoters, \nmay lead to delay in project implementation and involve restructuring / rescheduling of loans by banks. If a \nproject loan classified as 'standard asset' is restructured any time during the period up to two years from \nthe original date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO), in accordance with prudential \nguidelines on restructuring of advances  at paragraph 2.2.7 above, it can be retained as a standard asset if \nthe fresh DCCO is fixed within the following limits, and further provided the account continues to be serviced \nas per the restructured terms:  \na) Infrastructure Projects involving Court Cases  \nUp to another 2 years (beyond the existing extended period of 2 years i.e total extension of 4 years), in \ncase the reason for extension of date of commencement of production is arbitration proceedings or a court \ncase.  \nb) Infrastructure Projects delayed for other reasons beyond the Control of Promoters  \nUp to another 1 year (beyond the existing extended period of 2 years i.e. total extension of 3 years), in \nother than court cases.  \n1.4 The dispensation in para 1.3 is subject to the condition that the application for restructuring should be \nreceived before the expiry of period of two years from the original DCCO and when the account is still \nstandard as per record of recovery. The other conditions applicable would be:  \ni. In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest, banks should not book income on accrual \nbasis beyond two years from the original DCCO, considering the high risk involved in such restructured \naccounts.  \n                                                            \n8 For greenfield projects, financial closure is defined as a legally binding commitment of equity holders and debt \nfinanciers to provide or mobilise funding for the project. Such funding must account for a s ignificant part of the \nproject cost which should not be less than 90 per cent of the total project cost securing the construction of the \nfacility.  ii. Banks should maintain provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets \nas under:  \nUntil two years from the original \nDCCO  0.40%  \nDuring the t hird and the fourth \nyears after the original DCCO.  1.00%  \nFor the purpose of these guidelines, mere extension of DCCO will also be treated as restructuring even if all other terms and conditions remain the same.  \n2. Project Loans for Non -Infrastructure Sect or \n2.1 A loan for a non- infrastructure project will be classified as NPA during any time before commencement \nof commercial operations as per record of recovery (90 days overdue), unless it is restructured and \nbecomes eligible for classification as 'standar d asset' in terms of paras 2.3 and 2.4 below.  \n2.2 A loan for a non -infrastructure project will be classified as NPA if it fails to commence commercial \noperations within six months from the original DCCO, even if it is regular as per record of recovery, unless \nit is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras 2.3 and 2.4 \nbelow.  \n2.3 In case of non- infrastructure projects, if the delay in commencement of commercial operations extends \nbeyond the period of six months from the date of completion as determined at  the time of financial closure, \nbanks can prescribe a fresh DCCO, and retain the \"standard\" classification by undertaking restructuring of accounts in accordance with prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances at paragraph 2.2.7 above, \nprovided the fresh DCCO does not extend beyond a period of twelve months from the original DCCO. This  \nwould among others also imply that the restructuring application is received before the expiry of six months \nfrom the original DCCO, and when the account is still \"standard\" as per the record of recovery.  \nThe other conditions applicable would be:  \na) In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest, banks should not book income on accrual \nbasis beyond six months from the original DCCO, considering the high risk  involved in such restructured \naccounts.  \nb) Banks should maintain provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets \nas under:  \nUntil the first six months from the \noriginal DCCO  0.40%  \nDuring the next six months  1.00%  \n2.4 For this purpose, mere extension of DCCO will also be treated as restructuring even if all other terms \nand conditions remain the same.  \n3. These guidelines will however not be applicable to restructuring of commercial real estate and housing \nloans.  \n4. Other Issues  \n4.1 All other aspects of restructuring of project loans before commencement of commercial operations \nwould be governed by the instructions on restructuring of advances as contained in this Master Circular . 4.2 Any change in the repayment schedule of a pr oject loan caused due to an increase in the project outlay \non account of increase in scope and size of the project, would not be treated as restructuring if:  \ni) The increase in scope and size of the project takes place before commencement of commercial \noperations of the existing project.  \nii) The rise in cost excluding any cost -overrun in respect of the original project is 25% or more of the original \noutlay.  \niii) The bank re- assesses the viability of the project before approving the enhancement of scope and fixing \na fresh DCCP.  \niv) On re -rating, (if already rated) the new rating is not below the previous rating by more than one notch.  \nDefinition of 'Infrastructure Lending'  \nAny credit facility in whatever form extended by lenders (i.e. banks, FIs or NBFCs) to an infrastructure \nfacility as specified below falls within the definition of \"infrastructure lending\". In other words, a credit facility \nprovided to a borrower company engaged in developing or operating and maintaining, or developing, operating and maintai ning any infrastructure facility that is a project in any of the following sectors, or any \ninfrastructure facility of a similar nature  \na road, including toll road, a bridge or a rail system; a highway project including other activities being an integral part of the highway project; a port, airport, inland waterway or inland port; a water supply project, \nirrigation project, water treatment system, sanitation and sewerage system or solid waste management \nsystem; telecommunication services whether basic or cel lular, including radio paging, domestic satellite \nservice (i.e., a satellite owned and operated by an Indian company for providing telecommunication \nservice), network of trunking, broadband network and internet services; An industrial park or Special \nEcono mic Zone generation or generation and distribution of power; transmission or distribution of power by \nlaying a network of new transmission or distribution lines; construction relating to projects involving agro -\nprocessing and supply of inputs to agricultur e; construction for preservation and storage of processed agro -\nproducts, perishable goods such as fruits, vegetables and flowers including testing facilities for quality ; \nconstruction of educational institutions and hospitals; laying down and / or maintenance of gas, crude oil \nand petroleum pipelines, any other infrastructure facility of similar nature.  \n \n     \n \n   Annex 9  \nA.

INTRODUCTION  \nBanks, with their vast branch network throughout the length and breadth of the \ncountry, occupy a very strategic position in the financial system and have an important \nrole to play in providing credit to the housing sector.   \n2. VARIOUS REGULATIONS  \nWhile formulating their policies, banks have to take into account the following RBI \nguidelines and ensure that bank credit is used for production, constructions activities \nand not for activities connected with speculation in real est ate. \n(A) ACQUISITION OF LAND  \nBank finance can be granted only for purchase of a plot, provided a declaration is \nobtained from the borrower that he intends to construct a house on the said plot, with \nthe help of bank finance or otherwise, within such period as may be laid down by the \nbanks themselves.  \n(B) CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDING / READY- BUILT HOUSE  \n(i) Banks may grant loans to individuals for purchase/construction of dwelling unit per \nfamily and loans for repairs to the damaged dwelling units of families.  \n(ii) Bank s may extend finance to a person who already owns a house in town/village \nwhere he resides, for buying/ constructing a second house in the same or other town/ \nvillage for the purpose of self -occupation. \n(iii) Bank s may extend finance for purchase of a house by a borrower who proposes \nto let it out on rental basis on account of his posting outside the headquarters or because he has been provided accommodation by his employer.  \n(iv) Bank s may extend finance to a person who proposes to buy an old house where \nhe is presently residing as a tenant.  \n(v) Banks may finance for construction meant for improving the conditions in slum \nareas for which credit may be extended directly to the slum -dwellers on the guarantee \nof the Government, or indirectly to them through the State Governments.  \n(vi) Bank s may provide credit for slum improvement schemes to be implemented by \nSlum Clearance Boards and other public agencies.  5 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  (vii) Banks are advised to also adhere to the following conditions, in the light of the \nobservations of Delhi High Court on unauthorized construction:  \n(a) In cases where the applicant owns a plot/land and approaches the banks/FIs for a \ncredit facility to construct a house, a copy of the sanctioned plan by competent authority in the name of a person appl ying for such credit facility must be obtained by \nthe Banks/FIs before sanctioning the home loan.  \n(b) An affidavit- cum-undertaking must be obtained from the person applying for such \ncredit facility that he shall not violate the sanctioned plan, construction shall be strictly as per the sanctioned plan and it shall be the sole responsibility of the executants to obtain completion certificate within 3 months of completion of construction, failing which the bank shall have the power and the authority to recall  the entire loan with \ninterest, costs and other usual bank charges.  \n(c) An Architect appointed by the bank must also certify at various stages of construction of building that the construction of the building is strictly as per sanctioned plan and shall al so certify at a particular point of time that the completion certificate of \nthe building issued by the competent authority has been obtained.  \n(d) In cases where the applicant approaches the bank/FIs for a credit facility to purchase a built up house/flat, it should be mandatory for him to declare by way of an \naffidavit -cum-undertaking that the built up property has been constructed as per the \nsanctioned plan and/or building bye- laws and as far as possible has a completion \ncertificate also.  \n(e) An Architect appointed by the bank must also certify before disbursement of the loan that the built up property is strictly as per sanctioned plan and/or building bye-\nlaws.  \n(f) No loan should be given in respect of those properties which fall in the category of \nunauthorized colonies unless and until they have been regularized and development \nand other charges paid.  \n(g) No loan should also be given in respect of properties meant for residential use but \nwhich the applicant intends to use for commercial purposes and declares so while applying for loan.  6 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  (viii) Supplementary Finance  \n(a) Banks may consider requests for additional finance within the overall ceiling for \ncarrying out alterations/ additions/repairs to the house/flat already financed by them.  \n(b) In the case of individuals who might have raised funds for construction/ acquisition \nof accommodation from other sources and need supplementary finance, banks may extend such finance after obtaining paripassu or second mortgage charge over the \nproperty mortgaged in favour of other lenders and/or against such other security, as \nthey may deem appropriate.  \n(c) Banks may consider for grant of finance to \u2013 \ni. the bodies constituted for undertaking repairs to houses, and \nii. the owners of building/house/flat, whether occupied by themselves or by \ntenants, to meet the need- based requirements for their repairs/additions, after \nsatisfying themselves regarding the estimated cost (for which requisite certificate should be obtained from an Engineer / Architect, wherever \nnecessary) and obtaining such security as deemed appropriate.  \n(ix) Bank finance should, however, not be granted for the following:  \n(a) Banks should not grant finance for construction of buildings meant purely for \nGovernment/Semi -Government offices, including Municipal and Panchayat offices. \nHowever, banks may grant loans for activities, which will be refinanced by institutions \nlike NABARD.  \n(b) Projects undertaken by public sector entities which are not corporate bodies (i.e. \npublic sector undertakings which are not registered under Companies Act or which are \nnot Corporations established under the relevant statute) may not be financed by banks. Even in respect of projects undertaken by corporate bodies, as defined above, banks should satisfy themselves that the project is run on commercial lines and that bank finance is not in lieu of or to substitute budgetary resources envisaged for the project. The loan could, however, supplement budgetary resources if such supplementing was contemplated in the project design. Thus, in the case of a housing project, where the project is run on commercial lines, and the Government is interested in promoting the project either for the benefit of the weaker sections of the society or 7 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  otherwise, and a part of the project cost is met by the Governm ent through subsidies \nmade available and/or contributions to the capital of the institutions taking up the \nproject, the bank finance should be restricted to an amount arrived at after reducing from the total project cost the amount of subsidy/capital contribution receivable from the Government and any other resources proposed to be made available by the \nGovernment.  \n(c) Banks had, in the past, sanctioned term loans to Corporations set up by \nGovernment like State Police Housing Corporation, for construction of residential quarters for allotment to employees where the loans were envisaged to be repaid out of budgetary allocations. As these projects cannot be considered to be run on \ncommercial lines, it would not be in order for banks to grant loans to such proj ects.  \n(C) LENDING TO HOUSING INTERMEDIARY AGENCIES  \n(i) Financing of Land Acquisition \n(a) In view of the need to increase the availability of land and house sites for increasing \nthe housing stock in the country, banks may extend finance to public agencies and not private builders for acquisition and development of land, provided it is a part of the complete project, including development of infrastructure such as water systems, drainage, roads, provision of electricity, etc. Such credit may be extended by way of term loans. The project should be completed as early as possible and, in any case, within three years, so as to ensure quick re- cycling of bank funds for optimum results. \nIf the project covers construction of houses, credit extended therefor in respect of individual beneficiaries should be on the same terms and conditions as stipulated for \nfinancing the beneficiary directly.  \n(b) Banks should have a Board approved policy in place for valuation of properties \nincluding collaterals accepted for their exposures and that valuation should be done \nby professionally qualified independent valuers.  \n(c) As regards the valuation of land for the purpose of financing of land acquisition as also land secured as collateral, banks may be guided as under:  \n(i) Banks may extend finance to public agencies and not to private builders for \nacquisition and development of land, provided it is a part of the complete project, \nincluding development of infrastructure such as water systems, drainage, roads, 8 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  provision of electricity, etc. In such limited cases where land acquisition can be \nfinanced, the finance is to be limited to the acquisition price (current price) plus development cost. The valuation of such land as prime security should be limited to \nthe current market price.  \n(ii) Wherever land is accepted as collateral, valuation of such land should be at the \ncurrent market price only.  \n(ii) Lending to Housing Finance Institutions \nBanks may grant term loans to housing finance institutions taking into account (long-\nterm) debt -equity ratio, track record, recovery performance and other relevant factors \nincluding the provisions of  Master Circular - Bank Finance to Non- Banking Financial \nCompanies (NBFCs)  dated January 05, 2022. \n(iii) Lending to Housing Boards and Other Agencies  \nBanks may extend term loans to state level housing boards and other public agencies. However, in order to develop a healthy housing finance system, while doing so, the banks must not only keep in view the past performance of these agencies in the matter of recovery from the beneficiaries but they should also stipulate that the Boards will \nensure prompt and regular recovery of loan instalment s from the beneficiaries.  \n(iv) Term Loans to Private Builders \na. In view of the important role played by professional builders as providers of construction services in the housing field, especially where land is acquired and developed by State Housing Boards and other public agencies, commercial banks may extend credit to private builders on commercial terms by way of \nloans linked to each specific project.  \nb. Banks however, are not permitted to extend fund based or non- fund based \nfacilities to private builders for acquisition of land even as part of a housing project.  \nc. The period of credit for loans extended by banks to private builders may be \ndecided by banks themselves based on their commercial judgment subject to usual safeguards and after obtaining such security, as banks may deem \nappropriate.  9 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  d. Such credit may be extended to builders of repute, employing professionally \nquali fied personnel. It should be ensured, through close monitoring, that no part \nof such funds is used for any speculation in land.  \ne. Care should also be taken to see that prices charged from the ultimate beneficiaries do not include any speculative element, that is, prices should be based only on the documented price of land, the actual cost of construction and \na reasonable profit margin.  \n(v) Terms and Conditions for Lending to Housing Intermediary Agencies \na. In order to enhance the flow of resources to housing sector, term loans may be \ngranted by banks to housing intermediary agencies against the direct loans sanctioned/ proposed to be sanctioned by the latter, irrespective of the per \nborrower size of the loan extended by these agencies.  \nb. Banks can grant term loans  to housing intermediary agencies against the direct \nloans sanctioned/proposed to be sanctioned by them to Non- Resident Indians \nalso. However, banks should ensure that housing finance intermediary \nagencies being financed by them are authorised by RBI to grant housing loans to NRIs as all housing finance intermediaries are not authorised by RBI to \nprovide housing finance to NRIs.  \nc. Banks should charge interest in accordance with provisions contained in the \nMaster Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Interest Rate on Advances) \nDirections, 2016, as amended from time to time. \n(vi) Adherence to guidelines on Commercial Real Estate (CRE) exposure \nLending to housing intermediary agencies will be subject to the circular \nDBOD.BP.BC.No.42/08.12.015/2009- 10 dated September 9, 2009 on Gui delines on \nclassification of exposures as commercial real estate (CRE)  exposure and the circular \nDBOD.BP.BC.No.104/08.12.015/2012- 13 dated June 21, 2013 on H ousing Sector: \nNew sub -sector CRE (Residential Housing) within CRE & Rationalisation of \nprovisioning, risk -weight and LTV ratios . \n \n 10 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  3. QUANTUM OF LOAN  \n(a) While deciding the quantum of loan to be granted as housing finance, banks should \nabide by the following Loan to Value ( LTV) and Risk Weights (RWs) : \nCategory of Loan  LTV Ratio (%)  Risk Weight (%)  \n(a) Individual Housing Loans    \nUpto \u20b9 30 lakh < 80 35 \n> 80 and  < 90 50 \nAbove \u20b9 30 lakh & upto \u20b9 75 lakh  < 80 35 \nAbove \u20b9 75 lakh  < 75 50 \n   \n(b) CRE \u2013 RH NA 75 \n \nAs a counter cyclical measure, for Individual Housing Loans sanctioned on or after \nOctober 16, 2020 and up to March 31, 2022, the risk weights shall be as per the \ncircular DOR.No.BP.BC.24/08.12.015/2020- 21 dated October 16, 2020  on Individual \nHousing Loans \u2013 Rationalisation of Risk Weights.  The risk weights are as under - \nLTV Ratio (%)  Risk Weight (%)  \n\u2264 80 35 \n> 80 and \u2264 90  50 \n \n(b) In order to have uniformity in the practices adopted for deciding the value of the house property while sanctioning housing loans, banks should not include stamp duty, registration and other documentation charges in the cost of the housing property they \nfinance so that the effectiveness of LTV norms is not diluted.  \n(c) However, in cases where the cost of the house/dwelling units does not exceed \nRs.10 lakh, bank may add stamp duty, registration and other documentation charges \nto the cost of the house/dwelling unit for the purpose of calculating LTV ratio.  \n \n  11 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  4. INNOVATIVE HOUSING LOAN PRODUCTS \u2013 UPFRONT DISBURSAL OF \nHOUSING LOANS  \n(a) It has been observed that some banks have introduced certain innovative Housing \nLoan Schemes in association with developers / builders, e.g. upfront disbursal of \nsanctioned individual housing loans to the builders without linking the disbursals to various stages of construction of housing project, Interest/EMI on the housing loan availed of by the individual borrower being serviced by the builders during the constr uction period/ specified period, etc. This might include signing of tripartite \nagreement between the bank, the builder and the buyer of the housing unit. These \nloans products are popularly known by various names like 80:20, 75:25 schemes.  \n(b) Such housing loan products are likely to expose the banks as well as their home \nloan borrowers to additional risks e.g. in case of dispute between individual borrowers \nand developers/builders, default/ delayed payment of interest/ EMI by the developer/ builder during the agreed period on behalf of the borrower, non- completion of the \nproject on time etc. Further, any delayed payments by developers/ builders on behalf of individual borrowers to banks may lead to lower credit rating/ scoring of such borrowers by credit information companies (CICs) as information about servicing of loans get passed on to the CICs on a regular basis. In cases, where bank loans are also disbursed upfront on behalf of their individual borrowers in a lump- sum to builders/ \ndevelopers without any linkage to stages of constructions, banks run \ndisproportionately higher exposures with concomitant risks of diversion of funds.  \n(c) Disbursal of housing loans sanctioned to individuals should be closely linked to the \nstages of construction of the housing project / houses and upfront disbursal should not be made in cases of incomplete / under -construction / green field housing projects.  \n(d) However, in cases of projects sponsored by Government/Statutory Authorities, \nbanks may disburse the loans as per the payment stages prescribed by such \nauthorities, even where payments sought from house buyers are not linked to the stages of constructions, provided such authorities have no past history of non-\ncompletion of projects.  \n(e) It is emphasized that banks while introducing any kind of product should take into \naccount the customer suitability and appropriateness issues and also ensure that the 12 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  borrowers/ customers are made fully aware of the risks and liabilities under such \nproducts.  \n5. RATE OF INTEREST  \nBanks should charge interest on housing finance granted by them in accordance with \nthe provisions contained in the Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Interest Rate \non Advances) Directions, 2016, as  amended from time to time. \n6. APPROVALS FROM STATUTORY/ REGULATORY AUTHORITIES  \nWhile appraising loan proposals involving real estate, banks should ensure that the borrowers should have obtained prior permission from government / local governments / other statutory authorities for the project, wherever required. In order that the loan approval process is not hampered on account of this, while the proposals could be sanctioned in normal course, the disbursements should be made only after \nthe borrower has obtained requisite clearances from the government authorities.  \n7. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS  \nIn view of the observations of Hon\u2019ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay, while \ngranting finance to specific housing / development projects, banks are advised to \nstipulate as a part of the terms and conditions that:  \n(a) the builder / developer / company would disclose in the Pamphlets / Brochures etc., the name(s) of the bank(s) to which the property is mortgaged.  \n(b) the builder / developer / company would append the information relating to \nmortgage while publishing advertisement of a particular scheme in newspapers / \nmagazines etc.  \n(c) the builder / developer / company would indicate in their pamphlets / brochures, \nthat they would provide No Objection Certificate (NOC) / permission of the mortgagee \nbank for sale of flats / property, if required.  \n(d) Banks are advised to ensure compliance of the above terms and conditions and \nfunds should not be released unless the builder/developer/company fulfils the above \nrequirements.  13 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  (e) The above- mentioned provisions will be mutatis -mutandis, applicable to \nCommercial Real Estate also.  \n8. EXPOSURE TO REAL ESTATE  \nBanks are well advised to frame comprehensive prudential norms relating to the ceiling \non the total amount of real estate loans, single/group exposure limit for such loans, margins, security, repayment schedule and availability of supplementary finance and \nthe policy should be approved by the bank\u2019s board. While framing the bank\u2019s policy \nthe guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank should be taken into account.  \n9. HOUSING LOANS UNDER PRIORITY SECTOR  \nThe grant of housing loan for the purpose of the priority sector lending targets including \nreporting requirements will be subject to the instructions on \u201cPriority Sector Lending\u201d \nas amended from time to time.  \n10. FINANCING  OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING -ISSUE OF LONG -TERM  BONDS BY \nBANKS  \nBanks can issue long -term bonds with a minimum maturity of seven years to raise \nresources for lending to affordable housing subject to the conditions mentioned \nin circular DBR.BP.BC.No.25/08.12.014/2014- 15 dated July 15, 2014  on \u201c Issue of \nLong term Bonds by Banks - Financing of Infrastructure and Affordable Housing\u201d , and \nrelated circulars on the subject1.  \n11. ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES  \nIt is advised that banks should adhere to the National Building Code (NBC) formulated \nby the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in view of the importance of safety of buildings especially against natural disasters. Banks may consider this aspect for incorporation in their loan policies. Banks should also adopt the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) guidelines and suitably incorporate them as part of  their loan \npolicies, procedures and documentation.  \n  \n                                                            \n1 Circular DBR.BP.BC.No.50/08.12.014/2014-15 dated November 27, 2014, circular \nDBR.BP.BC.No.98/08.12.014/2014- 15 dated June 01, 2015  and circular  DOR.No.BP.BC.41/08.12.014/2019-20 \ndated March 17, 2020 . 14 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  Appendix  \nList of Circulars consolidated by Master Circular on Housing Finance \nSl.

GENERAL   \n \n1.1 In line with the international practices and as per the recommendations made by the \nCommittee on the Financial System (Chairman Shri M. Narasimham), the Reserve Bank of \nIndia has introduced, in a phased manner, prudential norms for income recognition, asset \nclassification and provisioning for the advances portfolio of the banks so as to move towards \ngreater consistency and transparency in the published accounts.  \n 1.2 The policy of income recognition should be objective and based on record of recovery \nrather than on any subjective considerations. Likewise, the classification of assets of banks has \nto be done on the basis of objective criteria which would ensure a uniform and consistent \napplication of the norms. Also, the provisioning should be made on the basis of the classification of assets based on the period for which the asset has remained non-performing and the availability of security and the realisable value thereof. \n \n1.3 Banks are urged to ensure that while granting loans and advances, realistic  repayment \nschedules may be fixed on the basis of cash flows with borrowers. This would go a long way to facilitate prompt repayment by the borrowers and thus improve the record of recovery in advances. \n2. DEFINITIONS  \n \n2.1  Non-performing Assets  \n \n2.1.1 An asset, including a leased asset, becomes non-performing when it ceases to generate \nincome for the bank.  \n 2.1.2 A non-performing asset (NPA) is a loan or an advance where; \ni. interest and/ or instalment of principal remains overdue for a period of more than 90 \ndays in respect of a term loan,  \nii. the account remains \u2018out of order\u2019 as indicated at p aragraph 2.2 below, in respect of \nan Overdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC),  \niii. the bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bills purchased and discounted,   6 iv. the instalment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for two crop seasons \nfor short duration crops,  \nv. the instalment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for one crop season \nfor long duration crops,  \nvi. the amount of liquidity facility remains outstanding for more than 90 days, in respect \nof a securitisation transaction undertaken in terms of the Reserve Bank of India \n(Securitisation of Standard Assets) Directions, 2021 . \nvii. in respect of derivative transactions, the overdue receivables representing positive mark -to-market value of a derivative contract, if these remain unpaid for a period of \n90 days from the specified due date for payment.  \n2.1.3 In addition, an account may also be classified as NPA in terms of certain specific \nprovisions of this Master Circular, including inter alia Paragraphs 4.2.4, 4.2.9 and Part B2. \n2.2 \u2018Out of Order\u2019 status  \n \n2.2.1 A CC/OD account shall be treated as \u2018out of order\u2019 if:  \ni) The outstanding balance in the CC/OD account remains continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit/drawing power for 90 days, or  \nii) The outstanding balance in the CC/OD account is less than the sanctioned  \nlimit/drawing power but there are no credits continuously for 90 days, or the outstanding balance in the CC/OD account is less than the sanctioned limit/drawing power but credits are not enough to cover the interest debited \nduring the previous 90 days per iod\n1. \n \n      2.2.2 The definition of \u201cout of order\u201d as at paragraph 2.2.1 above shall be applicable to all loan \nproducts being offered as an overdraft facility, including those not meant for business purpose \nand/or which entail interest repayments as the only credits.  \n2.3 \u2018Overdue\u2019  status  \n2.3.1 Any amount due to the bank under any credit facility is \u2018overdue\u2019 if it is not paid on the due \ndate fixed by the bank. The borrower accounts shall be flagged as overdue by the bank s as \npart of their day -end processes for the due date, irrespective of the time of running such \nprocesses.  \n    3. INCOME RECOGNITION  \n \n                                                      \n1 \u2018Previous 90 days period\u2019 shall be inclusive of the day for which the day -end process is being run.    7 3.1 Income Recognition Policy  \n3.1.1 The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of recovery. \nTherefore, the banks should not charge and take to income account interest on any NPA. This \nwill apply to Government guaranteed accounts also. \n3.1.2 However, interest on advances against Term Deposits, Nation al Savings Certificates \n(NSCs) , Kisan Vikas Patras (KVPs) and life insurance policies may be taken to income account \non the due date, provided adequate margin is available in the accounts.  \n3.1.3 Fees and commissions earned by the banks as a result of renegotiations or rescheduling \nof outstanding debts should be recognised on an accrual basis over the period of time covered \nby the renegotiated or rescheduled extension of credit.  \n3.1.4 In cases of loans where moratorium has been granted for repayment of interest, income \nmay be recogni sd on accrual basis for accounts which continue to be classified as \u2018standard\u2019. \nThis shall be evaluated against the definition of \u2018restructuring\u2019 provided in paragraph 16 of this Master Circular.  \n3.1.5 Income recognition norms for loans towards projects under implementation involving \ndeferment of DCCO  shall be subject to the instructions contained in paragraph 4.2.15 of this \nMaster Circular and that for loans against gold ornaments and jewellery for non-agricultural \npurposes shall be subject to the instructions contained in \ncircular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.27/21.04.048/2014 -15 dated July 22, 2014  on the s ubject, as updated from \ntime to time. \n3.2 Reversal of income \n3.2.1 If any advance, including bills purchased and discounted, becomes NPA, the entire \ninterest accrued and credited to income account in the past periods, should be reversed if the same is not realised. This will apply to Government guaranteed accounts also. \n \n3.2.2 If loans with moratorium on payment of interest (permitted at the time of sanction of the \nloan) become NPA after the moratorium period is over, the capitalized interest, if any, corresponding to the interest accrued during such moratorium period need not be reversed. \n \n3.2.3 In respect of NPAs, fees, commission and similar income that have accrued should \ncease to accrue in the current period and should be reversed with respect to past periods, if \nuncollected.  \n   8 3.2.4 Leased Assets - The finance charge component of finance income [as defined in \u2018AS 19 \nLeases\u2019)] on the leased asset which has accrued and was credited to income account before \nthe asset became non-performing, and remaining unrealised, should be reversed or provided \nfor in the current accounting period.  \n3.3 Appropriation of recovery in NPAs  \n3.3.1 Interest realised on NPAs may be taken to income account provided the credits in the \naccounts towards interest are not out of fresh/ additional credit facilities sanctioned to the \nborrower concerned.  \n3.3.2 In the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the borrower for the purpose \nof appropriation of recoveries in NPAs (i.e. towards principal or interest due), banks should adopt an accounting principle and exercise the right of appropriation of recoveries in a uniform and consistent manner. \n3.4 Interest Application  \n \nOn an account turning NPA, banks should reverse the interest already charged and not \ncollected by debiting Profit and Loss account and  stop further application of interest. However, \nbanks may continue to record such accrued interest in a Memorandum account in their books. \nFor the purpose of computing Gross Advances, interest recorded in the Memorandum account should not be taken into account.  \n3.5  Computation of NPA levels  \n \nBanks are advised to compute their Gross Advances, Net Advances, Gross NPAs and Net NPAs, as per the format in Annex -1\n. \n4. ASSET CLASSIFICATION  \n \n4.1 Categories of NPAs  \nBanks are required to classify non-performing assets further into the following three categories \nbased on the period for which the asset has remained non-performing and the realisability of \nthe dues:  \n(i) Substandard Assets  \n(ii) Doubtful Assets  \n(iii) Loss Assets \n    9 4.1.1  Substandard Assets  \nWith effect from March 31, 2005, a substandard asset would be one, which has remained \nNPA for a period less than or equal to 12 months. Such an asset will have well defined credit weaknesses that jeopardise the liquidation of the debt and are characterised by the \ndistinct possibility that the banks will sustain some loss, if deficiencies are not corrected. \n4.1.2  Doubtful Assets  \nWith effect from March 31, 2005, an asset would be classified as doubtful if it has remained \nin the substandard category for a period of 12 months. A loan classified as doubtful has all \nthe weaknesses inherent in assets that were classified as substandard, with the added \ncharacteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, \u2013 on the basis of \ncurrently known facts, conditions and values \u2013 highly questionable and improbable. \n4.1.3  Loss Assets  \nA loss asset is one where loss has been identified by the bank or internal or external \nauditors or the RBI inspection, but the amount has not been written off wholly. In other \nwords, such an asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance \nas a bankable asset is not warranted although there may be some salvage or recovery value. \n4.2 Guidelines for classification of assets  \n4.2.1 General  \nBroadly speaking, classification of assets into above categories should be done taking into \naccount the degree of well -defined credit weaknesses . \n4.2.2 Appropriate internal systems for proper and timely identification of NPAs  \n \nBanks should establish appropriate internal systems (including technology enabled processes) for proper and timely identification of NPAs, including putting in place the necessary \ninfrastructure to comply with the requirements of the \ncircular \nDoS.CO.PPG./SEC.03/11.01.005/2020-21 dated September 14, 2020  o n Automation of Income \nRecognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning processes in banks (as updated) .  \n4.2.3 Availability of security / net worth of borrower/ guarantor  \n \nThe availability of security or net worth of borrower/ guarantor should not be taken into account for the purpose of treating an advance as NPA or otherwise, except to the extent provided in \nPara graph 4.2.9.   10  \n4.2.4 Accounts with temporary deficiencies  \n \nThe classification of an asset as NPA should be based on the record of recovery. Bank should \nnot classify an advance account as NPA merely due to the existence of some deficiencies \nwhich are temporary in nature such as non-availability of adequate drawing power based on the \nlatest available stock statement, balance outstanding exceeding the limit temporarily, non-\nsubmission of stock statements and non-renewal of the limits on the due date, etc. In the matter \nof classification of accounts with such deficiencies banks may follow the following guidelines:  \na) Banks should ensure that drawings in the working capital accounts are covered by the \nadequacy of current assets, since current assets are first appropriated in times of \ndistress. Drawing power is required to be arrived at based on the stock statement which \nis current. However, considering the difficulties of large borrowers, stock statements \nrelied upon by the banks for determining drawing power should not be older than three \nmonths. The outstanding in the account based on drawing power calculated from stock \nstatements older than three months, would be deemed as irregular. \nb) A working capital borrowal account will become NPA if such irregular drawings are \npermitted in the acc ount for a continuous period of 90 days even though the unit may be \nworking or the borrower's financial position is satisfactory.  \nc) Regular and ad hoc  credit limits need to be reviewed/ regularised not later than three \nmonths from the due date/date of ad hoc sanction. In case of constraints such as non-\navailability of financial statements and other data from the borrowers, the branch should \nfurnish evidence to show that renewal/ review of credit lim its is already on and would be \ncompleted soon. In any case, delay beyond six months is not considered desirable as a \ngeneral discipline. Hence, an account where the regular/ ad hoc credit limits have not \nbeen reviewed/ renewed within 180 days from the due date/ date of ad hoc sanction will \nbe treated as NPA. \n4.2.5 Upgradation of loan accounts classified as NPAs  \n \nThe loan accounts classified as NPAs may be upgraded as \u2018standard\u2019 asset only if entire \narrears of interest and principal are paid by the borrower . In case of borrowers having more \nthan one credit facility from a bank , loan accounts shall be upgraded from NPA to standard \nasset category only upon repayment of entire arrears of interest and principal pertaining to all the credit facilities. With regard to upgradation of accounts classified as NPA due to \nrestructuring, non-achievement of date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO), \netc., the instructions as specified for such cases shall continue to be applicable.    11 4.2.6 Accounts regulari sed near about the balance sheet date  \n \nThe asset classification of borrowal accounts where a solitary or a few credits are recorded \nbefore the balance sheet date should be handled with care and without scope for subjectivity. \nWhere the account indicates inherent weakness on the basis of the data available, the account \nshould be deemed as a NPA. In other genuine cases, the banks must furnish satisfactory \nevidence to the Statutory Auditors/Inspecting Officers about the manner of regularisation of the \naccount to eliminate doubts on their performing status.  \n4.2.7 Asset Classification to be borrower -wise and not facility -wise  \n \n4.2.7.1 It is difficult to envisage a situation when only one facility to a borrower/one \ninvestment in any of the securities issued by the borrower becomes a problem \ncredit/investment and not others. Therefore, all the facilities granted by a bank to a \nborrower and investment in all the securities issued by the borrower will have to be treated \nas NPA/NPI and not the particular facility/inves tment or part thereof which has become \nirregular.  \n4.2.7.2 If the debits arising out of devolvement of letters of credit or invoked guarantees are parked in a separate account, the balance outstanding in that account also should be \ntreated as a part of the borrower\u2019s principal operating account for the purpose of application \nof prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning.  \n4.2.7.3 The bills discounted under LC favouring a borrower may not be classified as a Non -\nperforming ass ets (NPA), when any other facility granted to the borrower is classified as \nNPA. However, in case documents under LC are not accepted on presentation or the \npayment under the LC is not made on the due date by the LC issuing bank for any reason \nand the borr ower does not immediately make good the amount disbursed as a result of \ndiscounting of concerned bills, the outstanding bills discounted will immediately be \nclassified as NPA with effect from the date when the other facilities had been classified as \nNPA.  \n4.2.7.4 Derivative Contracts  \na) The overdue receivables representing positive mark -to-market value of a derivative \ncontract will be treated as a non-performing asset, if these remain unpaid for 90 days or \nmore. In case the overdues arising from forward contrac ts and plain vanilla swaps and \noptions become NPAs, all other funded facilities granted to the client shall also be classified as nonperforming asset following the principle of borrower -wise classification \nas per the existing asset classification norms. H owever, any amount, representing \npositive mark -to-market value of the foreign exchange derivative contracts (other than   12 forward contract and plain vanilla swaps and options) that were entered into during the \nperiod April 2007 to June 2008, which has already crystallised or might crystallise in \nfuture and is / becomes receivable from the client, should be parked in a separate \naccount maintained in the name of the client / counterparty. This amount, even if \noverdue for a period of 90 days or more, will not make other funded facilities provided \nto the client, NPA on account of the principle of borrower -wise asset classification, \nthough such receivable overdue for 90 days or more shall itself be classified as NPA, \nas per the extant Income Recognition and Asset C lassification (IRAC) norms. The \nclassification of all other assets of such clients will, however, continue to be governed \nby the extant IRAC norms. \nb) If the client concerned is also a borrower of the bank enjoying a Cash Credit or \nOverdraft facility from the bank, the receivables mentioned at sub-paragraph (a) above \nmay be debited to that account on due date and the impact of its non- payment would \nbe reflected in the cash credit / overdraft facility account. The principle of borrower -wise \nasset classification would be applicable here also, as per extant norms. \nc) In cases where the contract provides for settlement of the current mark -to-market value \nof a derivative contract before its maturity, only the current credit exposure (not the potential future exposure) will be classified as a non-performing asset after an overdue \nperiod of 90 days. \nd) As the overdue receivables mentioned above would represent unrealised income \nalready booked by the bank on accrual basis, after 90 days of overdue period, the \namount already taken to 'Profit and Loss a/c' should be reversed and held in a \n\u2018Suspense Account-Crystal lised Receivables\u2019 in the same manner as done in the case \nof overdue advances. \ne) Further, in cases where the derivative contracts provide for more settlements in future, \nthe MTM value will comprise of (a) crystallised receivables and (b) positive or negative \nMTM in respect of future receivables. If the derivative contract is not terminated on the \noverdue receivable remaining unpaid for 90 days, in addition to reversing the \ncrystallised receivable from Profit and Loss Account as stipulated in sub-paragraph (d) \nabove, the positive MTM pertaining to future receivables may also be reversed from \nProfit and Loss Account to another account styled as \u2018Suspense Account \u2013  Positive \nMTM\u2019. The subsequent positive changes in the MTM value may be credited to the \n\u2018Suspense Account \u2013 Positive MTM\u2019, not to P&L Account. The subsequent decline in \nMTM value may be adjusted against the balance in \u2018Suspense Account \u2013  Positive \nMTM\u2019. If the balance in this account is not sufficient, the remaining amount may be   13 debited to the P&L Account. On payment of the overdues in cash, the balance in the \n\u2018Suspense Account-Crystal lised Receivables\u2019 may be transferred to the \u2018Profit and Loss \nAccount\u2019, to the extent payment is received. \nf) If the bank has other derivative exposures on the borrower, it follows that  the MTMs of \nother derivative exposures should also be dealt with / accounted for in the manner as described in sub-para graph (e) above, subsequent to the crysta llised/settlement \namount in respect of a particular derivative transaction being treated as NPA.  \ng) Similarly, in case a fund-based credit facility extended to a borrower is classified as \nNPA, the MTMs of all the derivative exposures should be treated i n the manner \ndiscussed above. \n4.2.8 Advances under consortium arrangements  \nAsset classification of accounts under consortium should be based on the record of recovery of \nthe individual member banks and other aspects having a bearing on the recoverability of the \nadvances. Where the remittances by the borrower under consortium lending arrangements are \npooled with one bank and/or where the bank receiving remittances is not parting with the share of other member banks, the account will be treated as not servic ed in the books of the other \nmember banks and therefore, be treated as NPA. The banks participating in the consortium should, therefore, arrange to get their share of recovery transferred from the lead bank or get an express consent from the lead bank for the transfer of their share of recovery, to ensure \nproper asset classification in their respective books.  \n4.2.9 Accounts where there is erosion in the value of security/frauds committed by  borrowers  \n \n4.2.9.1  In respect of accounts where there are potential threats  for recovery on account of  \nerosion in the value of security or non-availability of security and existence of other factors \nsuch as frauds committed by borrowers it will not be prudent that such accounts should go through various stages of asset classification. In cases of such serious credit impairment, the \nasset should be straightaway classified as doubtful or loss asset as appropriate:  \na) Erosion in the value of security can be reckoned as significant when the realisable value \nof the security is less than 50 per cent of the value assessed by the bank or accepted by \nRBI at the time of last inspection, as the case may be. Such NPAs may be straightaway \nclassified under doubtful category. \nb) If the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank/ approved valuers/ RBI is \nless than 10 per cent of the outstanding in the borrowal accounts, the existence of \nsecurity should be ignored and the asset should be straightaway classified as loss \nasset.  \n   14 4.2.9.2  Provisioning norms in respect of all cases of fraud \na) Banks should normally provide for the entire amount due to the bank or for which the \nbank is liable (including in case of deposit accounts), immediately upon a fraud being \ndetected. While computing the provisioning requirement, banks may adjust financial \ncollateral eligible under Basel III Capital Regulations - Capital Charge for Credit Risk \n(Standardised Approach), if any, available with them with regard to the accounts \ndeclared as fraud account;  \nb) However, to smoothen the effect of such provisioning on quarterly profit and loss, banks \nhave the option to make the provisions over a period, not exceeding four quarters, \ncommencing from the quarter in which the fraud has been detected;  \nc) Where the bank chooses to provide for the fraud over two to four quarters and this \nresults in the full provisioning being made in more than one financial year, banks should \ndebit 'other reserves' [i.e., reserves other than the one created in terms of Section 17(2) \nof the Banking Regulation Act 1949] by the amount remaining un-provided at the end of \nthe financial year by credit to provisions. However, banks should proportionately reverse \nthe debits to \u2018other reserves\u2019 and complete the provisioning by debiting profit and loss \naccount, in the subsequent quarters of the next financial year;  \nd) Banks shall make suitable disclosures with regard to number of frauds reported, amount \ninvolved in such frauds, quantum of provision made during the year and quantum of \nunamortised provision debited from \u2018other reserves\u2019 as at the end of the year. \n4.2.10 Advances to Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS)/Farmers\u2019 Service Societies \n(FSS) ceded to Commercial Banks  \n \nIn respect of agricultural advances as well as advances for other purposes granted by banks to \nPACS/ FSS under the on-lending system, only that particular credit facility granted to PACS/ \nFSS which is in default for a period of two crop seasons in case of short duration crops and one crop season in case of long duration crops, as the case may be, after it has become due will be classifie d as NPA and not all the credit facilities sanctioned to a PACS/ FSS. The other direct \nloans & advances, if any, granted by the bank to the member borrower of a PACS/ FSS outside the on-lending arrangement will become NPA even if one of the credit facilities granted to the same borrower becomes NPA. \n4.2.11 Advances against Term Deposits, NSCs, KVPs, etc. \n  \nAdvances against term deposits, NSCs eligible for surrender, KVPs and life  insurance policies \nneed not be treated as NPAs, provided adequate margin is available in the accounts. Advances   15 against gold ornaments, government securities and all other securities are not covered by this \nexemption.  \n4.2.12 L oans with moratorium for payment of interest  \n \n4.2.12.1 In the case of bank finance given for industrial projects or for agricultural plantations \netc. where moratorium is available for payment of interest, payment of interest becomes 'due' only after the moratorium or gestation period is over. Therefore, such amounts of interest do not become overdue and hence do not become NPA, with reference to the date of debit of interest. They become overdue after  due date for payment of interest, if \nuncollected.  \n4.2.12.2. In the case of housing loan or similar advances granted to staff members where \ninterest is payable after recovery of principal, interest need not be considered as overdue \nfrom the first quarter onwards. Such loans/advances should be classified as NPA only when \nthere is a default in repayment of instalment of principal or payment of interest on the respective due dates.  \n4.2.13 Agricultural advances  \n \n4.2.13.1  A loan granted for short duration crops will be treated as NPA, if the instalment of \nprincipal or interest thereon remains overdue for two crop seasons. A loan granted for long \nduration crops will be treated as NPA, if the instalment of principal or interest thereon \nremains overdue for one crop season. For the purpose of these guidelines, \u201clong duration\u201d crops would be crops with crop season longer than one year and crops, which are not \u201clong duration\u201d crops, would be treated as \u201cshort duration\u201d crops. The crop season for each crop, \nwhich means the period up to harvesting of the crops raised, would be as determined by the \nState Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) in each State. Depending upon the duration of \ncrops raised by an agriculturist, the above NPA norms would also be made applicable to \nagricultural term loans availed of by him.  \n4.2.13.2  The above norms should be made applicable only to Farm Credit extended to \nagricultural activities as listed at Annex - 2\n. In respect of agricultural loans, other than those \nspecified in the Annex - 2, identification of NPAs would be done on the same basis as non-\nagricultural advances, which, at present, is the 90 days delinquency norm . \n \n4.2.13.3  Where natural calamities impair the repaying capacity of agricultural borrowers for \nthe purposes specified in Annex - 2, banks may decide on their own as a relief measure \nconversion of the short-term production loan into a term loan or re-schedulement of the repayment period; and the sanctioning of fresh short-term loan, subject to Master Direction   16 \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural \nCalamities) Directions 2018 \u2013 SCBs dated October 17, 2018 , as updated from time to time.  \n \n4.2.13.4  In such cases of conversion or re -schedulement, the term loan as well as fresh \nshort-term loan may be treated as current dues and need not be classified as NPA. The \nasset classification of these loans would thereafter be governed by the revised terms & \nconditions and would be treated as NPA if interest and/or instalment of principal remains \noverdue for two crop seasons for short duration crops and for one crop season for long \nduration crops.  \n \n4.2.13.5  While fixing the repayment schedule in case of rural housing advances granted to \nagriculturists under Indira Awas Yojana / Pradhan Mantri Gram Awas Yojana and Golden \nJubilee Rural Housing Finance Scheme, banks should ensure that the interest/instalment payable on such advances are linked to crop cycles. \n4.2.14 Government guaranteed advances  \n \n4.2.14.1  The credit facilities backed by guarantee of the Central Government though \noverdue may be treated as NPA only when the Government repudiates its guarantee when \ninvoked. This exemption from classification of Government guaranteed advances as NPA is \nnot for the purpose of recognition of income.  \n4.2.14.2  The requirement of invocation of guarantee has been delinked for deciding \nthe asset classification and provisioning requirements in respect of State Government guaranteed exposures.   \n4.2.14.3 With effect from the year ending March 31, 2006, State Government \nguaranteed advances and investments in State Government guaranteed securities would attract asset classification and provisioning norms if interest and/or principal or any other  \namount due to the bank remains overdue for more than 90 days. \n4.2.15 Projects under implementation  \n4.2.15.1 \u2018Date of Commencement of Commercial Operations\u2019 (DCCO ) \nFor all projects financed by the FIs/ banks, the DCCO of the project should be clearly spelt \nout at the time of financial closure of the project and the same should be formally documented. These should also be documented in the appraisal note by the bank dur ing \nsanction of the loan.    17 4.2.15.2 Deferment of DCCO  \n(i) There are occasions when the completion of projects is delayed for legal and other \nextraneous reasons like delays in Government approvals etc. All these factors, which are \nbeyond the control of the promoters, may lead to delay in project implementation and  \ninvolve restructuring / reschedulement of loans by banks. Accordingly, the following asset classification norms would apply to the project loans before commencement of \ncommercial operations.  \n(ii) For this purpose, all project loans have been divided into the following two \ncategories:  \na) Project Loans for infrastructure sector  \nb) Project Loans for non-infrastructure sector  \n\u2018Project Loan \u2019 would mean any term loan which has been extended for the purpose of \nsetting up of an economic venture. Further, Infrastructure Sector is a sector included in \nthe Harmonised Master List of Infrastructure sub-sectors issued by the Department of \nEconomic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, from time to time.  \n(iii)  Defer ment of DCCO and consequential shift in repayment schedule for equal or \nshorter duration (including the start date and end date of revised repayment schedule) \nwill not be treated as restructuring provided that: \na) The revised DCCO falls within the period of two years and one year from \nthe original DCCO stipulated at the time of financial closure for infrastructure projects and non -infrastructure projects (including commercial real estate projects) \nrespectively; and  \nb) All other terms and conditions of the loan remain unchanged.  \nAs such project loans will be treated as standard assets in all respects, they will attract standard asset provision of 0.40 per cent.  \n(iv)  Banks may restructure project loans, by way of revision of DCCO beyond the time \nlimits quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iii)(a) above and retain the \u2018standard\u2019 asset \nclassification, if the fresh DCCO is fixed within the following limits, and the account \ncontinues to be serviced as per the restructured terms: \na) Infrastructure Projects involving court cases    18 Up to another two years (beyond the two -year period quoted at Paragraph \n4.2.15.2 (iii)(a)  above, i.e., total extension of four years), in case the reason for \nextension of DCCO is arbitration proceedings or a court case. \nb) Infrastructure Projects delayed for other reasons beyond the control of promoters  \nUp to another one year (beyond the two- year period quoted at Paragraph \n4.2.15.2(iii)(a) above, i.e., total extension of three years), in case the reason for \nextension of DCCO is beyond the control of promoters (other than court cases). c) Project Loans for Non-Infrastructure Sector  (Other than Commercial Real Estate \nExposures)  \nUp to another one year (beyond the one- year period quoted at Paragraph \n4.2.15.2 (iii)(a)  above, i.e., total extension of two years). \nd) Project Loans for Commercial Real Estate Exposures  delayed for reasons \nbeyond the control of promoter(s)  \nUp to another one -year (beyond the one- year period quoted at Paragraph \n4.2.15.2 (iii)(a)  above, i.e., total extension of two years), provided that the revised \nrepayment schedule is extended only by a period equal to or shorter than the \nextension in DCCO and all provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and \nDevelopment) Act, 2016 are complied with. \n(v) It is re-iterated that a loan for a project may be classified as NPA during any time \nbefore commencement of commercial operations as per record of recovery (90 days overdue). It is further re-iterated that the dispensation at Paragraph 4.2.15.2 (iv) is \nsubject to the condition that the application for restructuring should be received before the expiry of period mentioned at Paragraph 4.2.15.2 (iii)  (a) above and when the \naccount is still standard as per record of recovery. The other conditions applicable would \nbe: \na) In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest, banks should not \nbook income on accrual basis beyond two years and one year from the original DCCO for infrastructure and non-infrastructure projects (including commercial real \nestate proj ects) respectively, considering the high risk involved in such restructured \naccounts.  \nb) Banks should maintain following provisions on such accounts as long as \nthese are classified as standard assets :   19 (vi) In case of infrastructure projects, where Appointed Date (as defined in the \nconcession agreement) is shifted due to the inability of the Concession Authority to \ncomply with the requisite conditions, change in date of commencement of commercial \noperations (DC CO) need not be treated as \u2018restructuring\u2019, subject to following conditions:  \na) The project is an infrastructure project under public private partnership \nmodel awarded by a public authority;  \nb) The loan disbursement is yet to begin; \nc) The revised date of commencement of commercial operations is \ndocumented by way of a supplementary agreement between the borrower and \nlender and;  \nd) Project viability has been reassessed and sanction from appropriate \nauthority  has been obtained at the time of supplementary agreement. \n4.2.15.3  Projects under Implementation \u2013  Change in Ownership  \n4.2.15.3.1 In order to facilitate revival of the projects stalled primarily due to  \ninadequacies of the current promoters, if a change in ownership takes place any time \nduring the periods quoted in Paragraph 4.2.15.2  above or before the original DCCO, \nbanks may permit extension of the DCCO of the project up to two years in addition to the periods quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2  above, as the case may be, without any \nchange in asset classification of the account subject to the conditions stipulated in the \nfollowing paragraphs. Banks may also consequentially shift/extend repayment \nschedule, if required, by an equal or shorter duration. \n Particulars  \nProvisioning \nRequirement  \nIf the revised DCCO is within two years/one year from the \noriginal DCCO prescribed at the time of financial closure for \ninfrastructure and non- infrastructure projects (including \ncommerical real estate projects) respectively  0.40 per cent  \nIf the DCCO is extended:  \ni) Beyond two years and upto four years or three years from \nthe original DCCO, as the case may be, for infrastructure \nprojects depending upon the reasons for such delay ; \nii) Beyond one years and upto two years from the original \nDCCO, for non-infr astructure projects (including real estate \nprojects)  5.00 per cent \u2013 From the \ndate of such restructuring \ntill the revised DCCO or 2 \nyears from the date of \nrestructuring, whichever is \nlater   20 4.2.15.3.2 In cases where change in ownership and extension of DCCO (as \nindicated in Paragraph 4.2.15.3.1 above) takes place before the original DCCO, and \nif the project fails to commence commercial operations by the extended DCCO, the \nproject will be eligible for further extension of DCCO in terms of guidelines quoted at \nParagraph 4.2.15.2  above. Similarly, where change in ownership and extension of \nDCCO takes place during the period quoted in Paragraph 4.2.15.2 (iii)(a)  above, the \naccount may still be restructured by extension of DCCO in terms of guidelines quoted \nat Paragraph 4.2.15.2 (iv) above, without classifying the account as non-performing \nasset.  \n4.2.15.3.3 The provisions of Paragraphs 4.2.15.3 .1 and 4.2.15.3 .2 above are \nsubject to the following conditions:  \na) Banks should establish that implementation of the project is stalled/affected \nprimarily due to inadequacies of the current promoters/management and with a \nchange in ownership there is a very high probability of commencement of \ncommercial operations by the project within the extended period; \nb) The project in consideration should be taken- over/acquired by a new \npromoter/promoter group with sufficient expertise in the field of operation. If the \nacquisition is being carried out by  a special purpose vehicle (domestic or \noverseas), the bank should be able to clearly demonstrate that the acquiring entity is part of a new promoter group with sufficient expertise in the field of \noperation;  \nc) The new promoters should own at least 51 per cent of the paid up equity \ncapital of stake in the acquired project. If the new promoter is a non-resident, and \nin sectors where the ceiling on foreign investment is less than 51 per cent, the \nnew promoter should own at least 26 per cent of the paid up equity capital or up \nto applicable foreign investment limit, whichever is higher, provided banks are satisfied that with this equity stake the new non-resident promoter controls the \nmanagement of the project; \nd) Viability of the project  should be established to the satisfaction of the banks.  \ne) Intra-group business  restructuring/mergers/acquisitions  and/or  \ntakeover/acquisition of the project by other entities/subsidiaries/associates etc. \n(domestic as well as overseas), belonging to the existing promoter/promoter \ngroup will not qualify for this facility. The banks should clearly establish that the \nacquirer does not belong to the existing promoter group;   21 f) Asset  classification of the account as on the \u2018reference date\u2019 would continue \nduring the extended period. For this pur pose, the \u2018reference date\u2019 would be the \ndate of execution of preliminary binding agreement between the parties to the \ntransaction, provided that the acquisition/takeover of ownership as per the \nprovisions of law/regulations governing such acquisition/takeover is completed \nwithin a period of 90 days from the date of execution of preliminary binding \nagreement. During the intervening period, the usual asset classification norms \nwould continue to apply. If the change in ownership is not completed within 90 \ndays  from the preliminary binding agreement, the \u2018reference date\u2019 would be the \neffective date of acquisition/takeover as per the provisions of law/regulations governing such acquisition/takeover; \ng) The new owners/promoters are expected to demonstrate their commitment \nby bringing in substantial portion of additional monies required to complete the \nproject within the extended time period. As such, treatment of financing of cost \noverruns for the project shall be subject to the guidelines prescribed in Paragraph \n4.2.15.5 of this circular. Financing of cost overrun beyond the ceiling prescribed in \nParagraph 4.2.15.5  of this circular would be treated as an event of restructuring \neven if the extension of DCCO is within the limits prescribed above; \nh) While considering the extension of DCCO (up to an additional period of 2 \nyears) for the benefits envisaged hereinabove, banks shall make sure that the \nrepayment schedule does not extend beyond 85 per cent of the economic \nlife/concession period of the project; and \ni) This facility would be available to a project only once before achievement of \nDCCO  and w ill not be available during subsequent change in ownership, if any. \n4.2.15.3.4 Loans covered under  this guideline would attract provisioning as per the \nextant provisioning norms depending upon their asset classification status. \n4.2.15.4 Deemed DCCO  \n4.2.15.4.1 A project with multiple independent units may be deemed to have \ncommenced commercial operations from the date when the independent units \nrepresenting 50 per cent (or higher) of the originally envisaged capacity have \ncommenced commercial production of the final output as originally envisaged, subject \nto the following conditions:   22 a. The units representing remaining 50 per cent (or lower) of the originally \nenvisaged capacity shall commence commercial operations within a maximum \nperiod of one year from the deemed date of commencement of commercial \noperations;  \nb. Commercial viability of the project is reassessed beyond doubt; and \nc. Capitalisation of interest obligation in respect of project debt component attributable to the units of the plant which have commenced commercial \noperations has to cease and the revenue expenditure is booked under revenue \naccount.  \n4.2.15.4.2 In such cases, banks may, at their discretion, also effect a \nconsequential  shift in  repayment schedule of the debt attributable to units which have \nnot commenced commercial operations for equal or shorter duration (including the \nstart date and end date of revised repayment schedule) i.e., one year, subject to no \nother changes being carried out.  \n 4.2.15.4.3 If the remaining units do not commence commercial operations within \nthe stipulated time of one year at p aragraph 4.2.15.4.1 (a) above, the account shall \nbe treated as non-performing asset and the provisions shall be made accordingly.  \n4.2.15.5 Financing of Cost Overruns for Projects under Implementation \n4.2.15.5.1 Internationally, project finance lenders sanction a \u2018standby credit \nfacility\u2019 to fund cost overruns if needed. Such \u2018standby credit facilities\u2019 are sanctioned \nat the time of initial financial closure; but disbursed only when there is a cost overrun. \nAt the time of credit assessment of borrowers/project, such cost overruns are also \ntaken i nto account while determining the project Debt Equity Ratio, Debt Service \nCoverage Ratio, Fixed Asset Coverage Ratio etc. Such \u2018standby credit facilities\u2019 rank pari passu  with base project loans and their repayment schedule is also the same as \nthat of the base project loans.  \n \n4.2.15.5.2 Accordingly, in cases where banks have specifically sanctioned a \n\u2018standby facility\u2019 at the time of initial financial closure to fund cost overruns, they may \nfund cost overruns as per the agreed terms and conditions.  \n \n4.2.15.5.3 Where the initial financial closure does not envisage such financing of \ncost overruns, banks are allow ed to fund cost overruns, which may arise on account   23 of extension of DCCO up to two years and one year from the original DCCO \nstipulated at the time of financial closure for infrastructure projects and non-\ninfrastructure projects  (including commercial real estate projects)  respectively, \nwithout treating the loans as \u2018restructured asset\u2019 , subject to the following conditions:  \na) Banks may fund additional \u2018Interest During Construction\u2019, which may arise on \naccount of delay in completion of a project;  \nb) Other cost overruns (excluding Interest During Construction) up to a \nmaximum of 10% of the original project cost;  \nc) The Debt Equity Ratio as agreed at the time of initial financial closure should \nremain unchanged subsequent to funding cost overruns or improve in favour of the lenders and the revised Debt Service Coverage Ratio should be acceptable to the \nlenders;  \nd) Disbursement of funds for cost overruns should start only after the \nSponsors/Promoters bring in their share of funding of the cost overruns; and \ne) All other terms and conditions of the loan should remain unchanged or \nenhanced in favour of the lenders.  \n4.2.15.5.4 The ceiling of 10 per cent of the original project cost prescribed in \nParagraph 4.2.15.5.3 (b) above is applicable to financing of all other cost overruns \n(excluding interest during construction), including cost overruns on account of \nfluctuations in the value of Indian Rupee against other currencies, arising out of extension of date of commencement of commercial operations. \n4.2.15.6 Other Issues  \n4.2.15.6.1 All other aspects of restructuring of project loans before \ncommencement of commercial operations would be governed by the provisions of Parts B1 and B 2 of this Master Circular . Restructuring of project loans after \ncommencement of commercial operations will also be governed by these instructions.  \n4.2.15.6.2 Any change in the repayment schedule of a project loan caused due \nto an increase in the project outlay on account of increase in scope and size of th e \nproject, would not be treated as restructuring if:  \na) The increase in scope and size of the project takes place before \ncommencement of commercial operations of the existing project.    24 b) The rise in cost excluding any cost-overrun in respect of the original project is \n25% or more of the original outlay. \nc) The bank re-assesses the viability of the project before approving the \nenhancement of scope and fixing a fresh DCCO. \nd) On re -rating, (if already rated) the new rating is not below the previous rating \nby more than one notch.  \n4.2.15.6.3  Multiple revisions  of the DCCO and consequential shift in repayment \nschedule for equal or shorter duration (including the start date and end date of \nrevised repayment schedule) will be treated as a single event of restructuring  \nprovided that the revised DCCO is fixed within the respective time limits stipulated at Paragraph 4.2.15. 2(iv) above, and all other terms and conditions of the loan \nremained unchanged.  \n 4.2.15.6.4 Banks, if deemed fit, may extend DCCO beyond the respective  time \nlimits stipulated at Paragraph 4.2.15. 2(iv) above; however, in that case, banks will not \nbe able to retain the \u2018standard\u2019 asset classification status of such loan accounts.  \n 4.2.15.6.5 In all the above cases of restructuring where regulatory forbearance \nhas been extended, the Boards  of banks should satisfy themselves about the viability \nof the project and the restructuring plan. \n4.2.15.7 Asset classification and Income recognition for projects under implementation \nrelating to Deferment of DCCO and Cost Overruns  \n4.2.15.7.1 In cases where DCCO is extended within the periods stipulated in \nParagraph 4.2.15.2 and funding of cost overruns complies with the \nthresholds/conditions stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.5 , such loans shall be treated as \n\u2018standard\u2019 in all respects. \n \n4.2.15.7.2 In cases where DCCO is extended within the periods stipulated in \nParagraph 4.2.15.2 , but funding of cost overruns does not comply with the \nthresholds/conditions stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.5 , such loans shall be treated as \n\u2018restructured standard\u2019 and attract a provision of 5 per cent from the date of such restructuring till the commencement of commercial operations or 2 years from the date of restructuring, whichever is later. These loans may be upgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 category once the entire project commences commercial operations.    25  \n4.2.15.7.3 In cases where DCCO is extended beyond the periods stipulated in \nParagraph 4.2.15.2  (iii) but up to periods stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iv ) and \nfunding of cost overruns complies with the thresholds/conditions stipulated in \nParagraph 4.2.15.5 , such loans shall be treated as \u2018restructured standard\u2019 and attract \na provision of 5 per cent from the date of such restructuring till the commencement of commercial operations or 2 years from the date of restructuring, whichever is l ater. \nThese loans may be upgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 category once the entire project commences commercial operations.  \n 4.2.15.7.4 In cases where DCCO is extended beyond the periods stipulated in \nparagraph 4.2.15.2(iii)  but up to periods stipulated in paragraph 4.2.15.2(iv)  and \nfunding of cost overruns does not comply with the thresholds/conditions stipulated in \nparagraph 4.2.15.5 , such loans will be treated as \u2018non-performing asset\u2019. These loans \nmay be upgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 category only after the account performs satisfactorily during the \u2018monitoring period\u2019 post DCCO;  \n \n4.2.15.7.5 Any changes to the major terms and conditions of the original project \nloans (i.e. promoters equity contribution, interest rate, etc.) of a borrower with \nfinancial difficulties, except what is specifica lly allowed such as changes in the \nDCCO, consequential parallel shift in repayment schedule and funding of cost \noverruns, as permitted within the thresholds, shall be treated as an event of \n\u2018restructuring\u2019 requiring the accounts to be classified as \u2018non-performing asset\u2019 and \nprovided for accordingly. These loans may be upgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 category only \nafter the account performs satisfactorily during the \u2018monitoring period\u2019 post DCCO.  \n 4.2.15.7.6 Banks may treat need based working capital sanctioned to projects \nafter commencement of commercial operations as \u2018standard\u2019 irrespective of the asset classification category of the project loans, subject to satisfactory performance of \nsuch working capital accounts. Banks shall ensure that assessment of working capital \nloans  are strictly need based and banks shall desist from over -financing. If the project \nloans classified as \u2018non -performing asset\u2019 do not perform satisfactorily during the \n\u2018monitoring period\u2019 and therefore fail to get upgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 category, then the \nworking capital loans also shall be placed in the same asset classification category as \nthat of project loans on completion of \u2018monitoring period\u2019.    26 4.2.15.8  Income recognition  \n4.2.15.8.1 Banks  may recognise  income on accrual basis in respect of the \nprojects under implementation, which are classified as \u2018standard\u2019. \n \n4.2.15.8.2 Banks should not recognise income on accrual basis in respect of the \nprojects under implementation which are classified as a \u2018substandard\u2019 asset. Banks \nmay recognise income in such accounts only on realisation  i.e. on cash basis.  \n \n4.2.15.8.3 The regulatory treatment of FITL / debt / equity instruments created  by \nconversion of principal / unpaid interest, as the case may be, shall be as per \nparagraph 21 of Part B2 of this Master Circular.  \n4.2.16 Post-shipment Supplier's Credit \n \n4.2.16.1 In respect of post-shipment credit extended by the banks covering export of \ngoods to countries for which the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation\u2019s  (ECGC) cover is \navailable, EXIM Bank has introduced a guarantee- cum-refinance programme whereby, in \nthe event of default, EXIM Bank will pay the guaranteed amount to the bank within a \nperiod of 30 days from the day the bank invokes the guarantee after the exporter has filed \nclaim with ECGC.  \n \n4.2.16.2 Accordingly, to the extent payment has been received from the EXIM Bank, \nthe advance may not be treated  as a non-performing asset for asset classification and \nprovisioning purposes.  \n4.2.17 Export Project Finance  \n \n4.2.17.1 In respect of export project finance, there could be instances where the \nactual importer has paid the dues to the bank abroad but the bank in turn is unable to remit the amount due to political developments such as war, strife, UN  embargo, etc.  \n \n4.2.17.2 In such cases, where the lending bank is able to establish through \ndocumentary evidence that the importer has cleared the dues in full by depositing the \namount in the bank abroad before it turned into NPA in the books of the bank, but the \nimporter's country is not allowing the funds to be remitted due to political or other reasons, \nthe asset classification may be made after a period of one year  from the date the amount \nwas deposited by the importer in the bank abroad. \n4.2.18 Transfer of Loan Exposur es \n   27 The asset classification and provisioning requirements in respect of transactions involving \ntransfer of loans shall be as per the Reserve Bank of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) \nDirections, 2021. \n4.2.19 Credit Card Accounts  \n4.2.19.1 In credit card accounts, the amount spent is billed to the card users through \na monthly statement with a definite due date for repayment. Banks give an option to the \ncard users to pay either the full amount or a fraction of it, i.e., minimum amount due, on the \ndue date and roll -over the balance amount to the subsequent months\u2019 billing cycle.  \n 4.2.19.2 A credit card account will be treated as non-performing asset if the minimum \namount due, as mentioned in the statement, is not paid fully within 90 days from the \npayment due date mentioned in the statement. \n \n4.2.19.3 Banks shall report a credit card account as \u2018past due\u2019 to credit information \ncompanies (CICs) or levy penal charges, viz. late payment charges, etc., if any, only when \na credit card account remains \u2018past due\u2019 for more than three days. The number of \u2018days \npast due\u2019 and late payment charges shall, however, be computed from the payment due \ndate mentioned in the credit card statement. \n5. PROVISIONING NORMS  \n5.1 General  \n \n5.1.1 The primary responsibility for making adequate provisions for any diminution in the value of \nloan assets, investment or other assets is that of the bank managements and the statutory \nauditors. The assessment made by the inspecting officer of the RBI is furnished to the bank to \nassist the bank management and the statutory  auditors in taking a decision in regard to making \nadequate and necessary  provisions in terms of prudential guidelines.  \n5.1.2 In conformity with the prudential norms, provisions should be made on the non-performing \nassets on the basis of classification of assets into prescribed  categories as detailed in paragraph \n4 supra. Taking into account the time lag between an account becoming doubtful of recovery, its \nrecognition as such, the realisation of the security and the erosion over time in the value of \nsecuri ty charged to the bank, the banks should make provision against substandard assets, \ndoubtful assets and loss assets as below . \n5.2 Loss assets  \nLoss assets should be written off. If loss assets are permitted to remain in the books  for any \nreason, 100 percent of the outstanding should be provided for.   28 5.3 Doubtful assets  \n5.3.1 100 percent of the extent to which the advance is not covered by the realisable value \nof the security to which the bank has a valid recourse and the realisable value is estimated on a \nrealistic basis. \n \n5.3.2 In regard to the secured portion, provision may be made on the following basis, at the \nrates ranging from 25 percent to 100 percent of the secured portion depending upon the period \nfor which the asset has remained doubtful:  \nPeriod for which the advance has  \nremained in \u2018doubtful\u2019 category  Provision ing require ment  (%) \n(%) \nUp to one year  25 \nOne to three years  40 \nMore than three years  100 \n \n5.3.3 With a view to bringing down divergence arising out of difference in assessment of \nthe value of security, in cases of NPAs with balance of \u20b9 5 crore and above stock audit at annual \nintervals by external agencies appointed as per the guidelines approved by the Board would be \nmandatory in order to enhance the reliability on stock valuation. Collaterals such as immovable properties charged in favour of the bank should be got valued once in three years by valuers \nappointed as per the guidelines approved by the B oard of Directors.  \n5.4 Substandard assets  \n \n5.4.1 A general provision of 15 percent on total outstanding should be made without making any \nallowance for ECGC guarantee cover and securities available.  \n \n5.4.2 The \u2018unsecured exposures\u2019 which are identified as \u2018substandard\u2019 would attract additional \nprovision of 10 per cent, i.e., a total of 25 per cent on the outstanding balance. However, in view \nof certain safeguards such as escrow accounts available in respect of infrastructure lending, \ninfrastructure loan acc ounts which are classified as sub- standard will attract a provisioning of 20 \nper cent instead of the aforesaid prescription of 25 per cent. To avail of this benefit of lower provisioning, the banks should have in place an appropriate mechanism to escrow the cash flows \nand also have a clear and legal first claim on these cash flows.  \n \n5.4.3 The provisioning requirement for unsecured \u2018doubtful\u2019 assets is 100 per cent. Unsecured \nexposure is defined as an exposure where the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the \nbank/approved valuers/Reserve Bank\u2019s inspecting officers, is not more than 10 percent, ab- initio, \nof the outstanding exposure. \u2018Exposure\u2019 shall include all funded and non- funded exposures   29 (including underwriting and similar commitments). \u2018Security\u2019 will mean tangible security properly \ncharged to the bank and will not include intangible securities like guarantees (including State \ngovernment guarantees), comfort letters etc.  \n \n5.4.4  In order to enhance transparency and ensure correct reflection of the unsecured advances \nin Schedule 9 of the banks' balance sheet, it is advised that the following would be applicable  \nfrom the financial year 2009-10 onwards: \na) For determining the amount of unsecured advances for reflecting in schedule 9 of the published balance sheet, the rights, licenses, authorisations, etc., charged to the \nbanks as collateral in respect of projects (including infrastructure projects) financed by them, should not be reckoned as tangible security. Hence such advances shall \nbe reckoned as unsecured. \nb) However, banks may treat annuities under build-operate-transfer (BOT) model in respect of road / highway projects and toll collection rights, where there are \nprovisions to compens ate the project sponsor if a certain level of traffic is not \nachieved, as tangible securities subject to the condition that banks' right to receive annuities and toll collection rights is legally enforceable and irrevocable. \nc) It is noticed that most of the infrastructure projects, especially road/highway projects \nare user -charge based, for which the Planning Commission has published Model \nConcession Agreements (MCAs). These have been adopted by various Ministries \nand State Governments for their respective public -private partnership (PPP) projects \nand they provide adequate comfort to the lenders regarding security of their debt. In \nview of the above features, in case of PPP projects, the debts due to the lenders may \nbe considered as secured to the extent assur ed by the project authority in terms of \nthe Concession Agreement, subj ect to the following conditions : \ni. User charges / toll / tariff payments are kept in an escrow account where \nsenior lenders have priority over withdrawals by the concessionaire; \nii. There is s ufficient risk mitigation, such as pre-determined increase in user \ncharges or increase in concession period, in case project revenues are lower than anticipated; \niii. The lenders have a right of substitution in case of concessionaire default;  \niv. The lenders have a right to trigger termination in case of default in debt \nservice; and    30 v. Upon termination, the Project Authority has an obligation of (i) compulsory  \nbuy-out and (ii) repayment of debt due in a pre-determined manner. \nvi. In all such cases, banks must satisfy themselves about the legal \nenforceability of the provisions of the tripartite agreement and factor in their past experience with such contracts.  \nd) Banks should also disclose the total amount of advances for which intangible securities such as charge over the rights, licenses, authority, etc. has been taken as \nalso the estimated value  of such intangible collateral. The disclosure may be made \nunder a separate head in \"Notes to Accounts\". This would differentiate such loans \nfrom other entirely unsecured loans.  \n5.5 Standard assets  \n5.5.1 The provisioning requirements for all types of standard assets stands as below. Banks \nshould make general provision for standard assets at the following rates for the funded \noutstanding on global loan portfolio basis: \na) Farm Credit to agricultural activities, individual housing loans  and Small and Micro \nEnterprises (SMEs) sectors at 0.25 per cent;  \nb) advances to Commercial Real Estate (CRE)\n2 Sector at 1.00 per cent;  \nc) advances to Commercial Real Estate \u2013 Residential Housing Sector (CRE - RH)3 \nat 0.75 per cent \nd) housing loans extended at teaser rates as indicated in Para graphs  5.9.9; \ne) restructured advances \u2013 as stipulated in the prudential norms for restructuring of \nadvances. \nf) Advances restructured and classified as standard in terms of the Master Direction \n\u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural \nCalamities) Directions 2018 \u2013 SCBs , as updated from time to time, at 5%. \ng) All other loans and advances not included in (a) \u2013 (f) above at 0.40 per cent. \n5.5.2 The provisions on standard assets should not be reckoned for arriving at net NPAs. \n \n                                                      \n2 CRE as defined in terms of the circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.42/08.12.015/2009- 10 dated September 9, 2009  on \n\u2018Guidelines on Classification of Exposures as Commercial Real Estate ( CRE) Exposures\u2019  \n3 CRE -RH as defined in the circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.104/08.12.015/2012-13 dated June 21, 2013  on \u2018Housing \nSector: New sub-sector CRE (Residential Housing) wit hin CRE & Rationalisation of provisioning, risk -weight and \nLTV ratios\u2019    31 5.5.3 The provisions  towards Standard Assets need not be netted from gross advances  but \nshown separately as 'Contingent Provisions against Standard Assets' under 'Other Liabilities \nand Provisions Others' in Schedule 5 of the balance sheet. \n \n5.5.4 It is clarified that the Medium Enterprises will attract 0.40% standard asset provisioning. \nThe definition of the terms Micro Enterprises, Small Enterprises, and Medium Enterprises shall be in terms of the circular FIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.3/06.02.31/2020-21 dated July 2, 2020\n \non \u2018Credit flow to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Sector\u2019 as updated from time to time.  \n 5.5.5 A high level  of unhedged foreign currency exposures of the entities can increase the \nprobability of default in times of high currency volatility. Hence, banks are required to estimate the riskiness of unhedged position of their borrowers as per the instructions contained in our \ncircular DBOD.No.B P.BC.85/21.06.200/2013-14 dated January 15, 2014 as well as our \ncircular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.116/21.06.200/2013-14 dated June 3, 2014  and make incremental provisions \non their exposures to such entities:  \nLikely Loss / EBID (%)  Incremental Provisioning Requirement on the  \ntotal credit exposures over and above extant  \nstandard asset provisioning \nUp to 15 per cent  0 \nMore than 15 per cent and up  to 30 per cent  20 bps \nMore than 30 per  cent and up  to 50 per cent  40 bps \nMore than 50 per cent and up  to 75 per cent  60 bps \nMore than 75 per cent  80 bps  \nFor this purpose, EBID, as defined for computation of DSCR = Profit After Tax + Depreciation + \nInterest on debt + Lease Rentals, if any.  \n5.6 Prudential norms on creation and utilisation of floating provisions  \n \n5.6.1 Principle for creation of floating provisions by banks  \nThe bank's board of directors should lay down approved policy regarding the level to which the \nfloating provisions can be  created. The bank should hold floating provisions for \u2018advances\u2019 and \n\u2018investments\u2019 separately and the guidelines prescribed will be applicable to floating provisions held \nfor both \u2018advances\u2019 & \u2018investmen t portfolios.    32 5.6.2 Principle for utilisation of floating provisions by banks  \n5.6.2.1 The floating provisions should not be used for making specific provisions as per the \nextant prudential guidelines in respect of non-performing assets or for making regulatory \nprovisions for standard assets. The floating provisions can be used only for contingencies \nunder extraordinary  circumstances for making specific provisions in impaired accounts after \nobtaining board\u2019s approval and with prior permission of RBI. The Boards of the banks should \nlay down an approved policy as to what circumstances would be considered extraordinary.  \n5.6.2.2 To facilitate banks' Boards to evolve suitable policies in this regard, it is clarified that \nthe extra-ordinary circumstances refer to losses which do not arise in the normal cours e of \nbusiness and are exceptional and non-recurring in nature. These extra-ordinary \ncircumstances could broadly fall under three categories viz. General, Market and Credit. \nUnder general category, there can be situations where bank is put unexpectedly to l oss due \nto events such as civil unrest or collapse of currency in a country. Natural calamities and pandemics may also be included in the general category. Market category would include \nevents such as a general melt down in the markets, which affects the e ntire financial system. \nAmong the credit category, only exceptional credit losses would be considered as an extra-\nordinary circumstance. \n5.6.2.3 In order to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID 19 related stress on banks, as a \nmeasure to enable capital conservation, banks are allowed to utilise 100 per cent of floating \nprovisions held by them as on December 31, 2020 for making specific provisions for non-\nperforming assets with prior approval of their Boards. Such utilisation is permitted up to \nMarch 31, 2022. \n5.6.3 Accounting   \nFloating provisions cannot be reversed by credit to the profit and loss account. They can only be \nutilised for making specif ic provisions in extraordinary circumstances as mentioned above. Until \nsuch utilisation, these provisions can be netted off from gross NPAs to arrive at disclosure of net NPAs. Alternatively, they can be treated as part of Tier II capital wit hin the overal l ceiling of \n1.25%  of total risk weighted assets.  \n5.6.4 Disclosures   \nBanks should make comprehensive disclosures on floating provisions in the \u201cnotes on accounts\u201d to the balance sheet on (a) opening balance in the floating provisions account, (b) \nthe quantum of floating provisions made in the accounting year, (c) purpose and amount of \ndraw down made during the accounting year, and (d) closing balance in the floating provisions \naccount.    33 5.7 Additional Provisions at higher than prescribed rates  \n5.7.1 For NPAs  \nThe regulatory norms for provisioning represent the minimum requirement. A  bank may \nvoluntarily make specific provisions for advances at rates which are  higher than the rates \nprescribed under existing regulations, to provide for estimated actual loss  in collectible \namount, provided such higher rates are approved by the Board of Directors and consistently \nadopted from year to year. Such additional provisions are not to be considered as floating \nprovisions. The additional provisions for NPAs, like the m inimum regulatory provision on \nNPAs, may be netted off from gross NPAs to arrive at the net NPAs  \n5.7.2 For standard assets  \nThe provisioning rates prescribed in this Master Circular are the regulatory minimum and \nbanks are encouraged to make provisions at h igher rates in respect of advances to stressed \nsectors of the economy. In this regard, it is advised as under:  \n(i) Banks shall put in place a Board \u2013approved policy for making provisions for \nstandard assets at rates higher than the regulatory minimum, based on evaluation \nof risk and stress in various sectors.  \n(ii) The policy shall require a review, at least on a quarterly basis, of the performance \nof various sectors of the economy to which the bank has an exposure to evaluate \nthe present and emerging risks and stress  therein. The review may include \nquantitative and qualitative aspects like debt-equity ratio, interest coverage ratio, profit margins, ratings upgrade to downgrade ratio, sectoral non -performing \nassets/stressed assets, industry performance and outlook, legal/ regulatory issues \nfaced by the sector, etc. The reviews may also include sector specific parameters.  \n \n5.8 Provisions on Leased Assets  \n \n5.8.1 Substandard assets  \n(i) 15 percent of the sum of the net investment in the lease and the unrealised  portion \nof finance income net of finance charge component. The terms \u2018net investment in the \nlease\u2019, \u2018finance income\u2019 and \u2018finance charge\u2019 are as defined in \u2018AS 19 Leases\u2019 . \n(ii) Unsecured (as defined in Paragraph 5.4 above) lease exposures, which are \nidentified as \u2018substandard\u2019 would attract additional provision of 10 per cent, i.e., a total of 25 per cent.    34 5.8.2 Doubtful assets  \n100 percent of the extent to which the finance is not secured by the realisable value of the \nleased asset, should be provided for. Realisable value is to be estimated on a realistic basis. \nIn addition to the above provision, provision at the following rates should be made on the \nsum of the net investment in the lease and the unrealised portion of finance income net of \nfinance c harge component of the secured portion, depending upon the period for which asset \nhas been doubtful:  \nPeriod for which the advance has  \nremained in \u2018doubtful\u2019 category  Provision ing  \nrequirement \n(%) \nUp to one year  25 \nOne to three years  40 \nMore than three years  100 \n5.8.3 Loss assets  \nThe entire asset should be written off,  if for any reason, an asset is allowed to remain in \nbooks, 100 percent of the sum of the net investment in the lease and the unrealised portion of finance income net of finance charge component should be provided for. \n5.9 Guidelines for Provisions under Special Circumstances  \n \n5.9.1 Advances against deposits/specific instruments  \nAdvances against term deposits, NSCs eligible for surrender, KVPs, gold ornaments, \ngovernment & other securities  and life insurance policies would attract provisioning \nrequirements as applicable to their asset classification status. \n5.9.2 Treatment of interest suspense account  \nAmounts held in Interest Suspense Account should not be reckoned as part of provisions. Amounts lying in the Interest Suspense Account should be deducted from the relative \nadvances and thereafter, provisioning as per the norms, should be made on the balances \nafter such deduction.  \n5.9.3 Advances covered by ECGC guarantee \nIn the case of advances  classified as doubtful and guaranteed by ECGC, provision should \nbe made only for the balance in excess of the amount guaranteed by the Corporation. Further, while arriving at the provision required to be made for doubtful assets, realisable \nvalue of the s ecurities should first be deducted from the outstanding balance in respect of \nthe amount guaranteed by the Corporation and then provision made as illustrated hereunder: \nExample :   35 Outstanding Balance  Rs. 4 lakhs  \nECGC Cover  50 percent  \nPeriod for which the advance has remained \ndoubtful  More than 2 years remained doubtful \n(say as on March 31, 2014)  \nValue of security held  Rs. 1.50 lakhs  \n \nProvision required to be made:  \nOutstanding balance  Rs. 4.00 lakhs  \nLess: Value of security held  Rs. 1.50 lakhs  \nUnrealised  balance  Rs. 2.50 lakhs  \nLess: ECGC Cover  \n(50% of unrealisable balance)  Rs. 1.25 lakhs  \nNet unsecured balance  Rs. 1.25 lakhs  \nProvision for unsecured portion of advance  Rs. 1.25 lakhs (@ 100 percent of \nunsecured portion)  \nProvision for secured portion of advance  \n(as on March 31, 2012)  Rs.0.60 lakhs (@ 40 per cent of the \nsecured portion)  \nTotal provision to be made  Rs.1.85 lakhs (as on March 31, 2014)  \n \n5.9.4 Advance covered by guarantees of Credit Guarantee Fund Trust f or Micro a nd Small \nEnterprises (CGTMSE) or Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing \n(CRGFTLIH)  \nIn case the advance covered by CGTMSE or CRGFTLIH guarantee becomes non-\nperforming, no provision need be made towards the guaranteed portion. The  amount \noutstanding in excess of the guaranteed portion should be provided for as per the extant \nguidelines on provisioning for non- performing assets. An illustrative example is given \nbelow:  \nExample : \nOutstanding Balance   Rs. 10 lakhs  \nCGTMSE/CRGFTLIH Cover  75% of the amount outstanding or 75% of \nthe unsecured amount or Rs.37.50 lakh, \nwhichever is the least  \nPeriod for which the advance has \nremained doubtful  More than 2 years remained doubtful (say \nas on March 31, 2014)  \nValue of sec urity held Rs. 1.50 lakhs  Value of security held Rs. 1.50 lakhs  \n \nProvision required to be made:    36 Balance outstanding  Rs.10.00 lakh  \nLess: Value of security  Rs. 1.50 lakh  \nUnsecured amount  Rs. 8.50 lakh  \nLess: CGTMSE/CRGFTLIH cover (75%)  Rs. 6.38 lakh  \nNet unsecured and uncovered portion:  Rs. 2.12 lakh  \nProvision for Secured portion @ 40% of \nRs.1.50 lakh  Rs.0.60 lakh  \nProvision for Unsecured & uncovered \nportion @ 100% of Rs.2.12 lakh  Rs.2.12 lakh  \nTotal provision required  Rs.2.72 lakh  \n5.9.5 Reserve for Exchange Rate Fluctuations Account (RERFA)  \nWhen exchange rate movements of Indian rupee turn adverse, the outstanding amount of \nforeign currency denominated loans (where actual disbursement was made in Indian Rupee) which becomes overdue, goes  up correspondingly, with its attendant implications of \nprovisioning requirements. Such assets should not normally be revalued. In case such assets \nneed to be revalued as per requirement of accounting practices or for any other requirement, \nthe following procedure may be adopted: \na. The loss on revaluation of assets has to be booked in the bank's Profit & Loss Account.  \nb. In addition to the provisioning requirement as per Asset Classification, the full amount of the Revaluation Gain, if any, on account of foreign exchange fluctuation should be \nused to make provisions against the corresponding assets.\n \n5.9.6 Provisioning for country risk  \n5.9.6.1 Banks shall make provisions, with effect from the year ending March 31, \n2003, on the net funded country exposures on a graded scale ranging from 0.25 to 100 percent according to the risk categories mentioned below. To begin with, banks \nshall make provisions as per the following schedule: \nRisk category  ECGC  \nClassification Provisioning  \nRequirement  \n(per cent)  \nInsignificant  A1 0.25 \nLow A2 0.25 \nModerate  B1 5   37 High B2 20 \nVery high  C1 25 \nRestricted  C2 100 \nOff-credit  D 100 \n \n5.9.6.2 Banks are required to make provision for country risk in respect of a country \nwhere its net funded exposure is one per cent or more of its total assets.  \n \n5.9.6.3 The provision for country risk shall be in addition to the provisions required to \nbe held according to the asset classification status of the asset. However, in the case of \u2018loss assets\u2019 and \u2018doubtful assets\u2019, provision held, including provision held for country risk, may not exceed 100% of the outstanding.  \n \n5.9.6.4 Banks may not make any provision for \u2018home country\u2019 exposures i.e. \nexposure to India. The exposures of foreign branches of Indian banks to the host \ncountry should be included. Foreign banks shall compute the country exposures of their Indian branches and shall hold appropriate provisions in their Indian books. However, their exposures to India will be excluded. \n \n5.9.6.5 Banks may make a lower level of provisioning (say 25% of the requirement) in \nrespect of short-term exposures (i.e. exposures with contractual maturity of less than 180 days). \n5.9.7 Provisioning norms for Liquidity facility provided for Securitisation transactions  \nThe amount of liquidity facility drawn and outstanding for more than 90 days, in respect of securitisation transactions undertaken in terms of \nReserve Bank of India (Securitisation of \nStandard Assets) Directions, 2021 , s hould be fully provided for. \n5.9.8 Provisioning requirements for derivative exposures  \nCredit exposures computed as per the current marked to market value of the contract, arising on account of the interest rate & foreign exchange derivative transactions, credit \ndefault swaps and gold, shall also attract provisioning requirement as applicable to the loan \nassets in the 'standard' category, of the concerned counterparties. All conditions applicable for treatment of the provisions for standard assets would also apply to the aforesaid provisions for derivative and gold exposures.    38 5.9.9 Provisioning for housing loans at teaser rates  \nIt has been observed that some banks are following the practice of sanctioning housing \nloans at teaser rates i.e. at comparatively lower rates of interest in the first few years, after \nwhich rates are reset at higher rates. This practice raises concern as some borrowers may \nfind it difficult to service the loans once the normal interest rate, which is higher than the rate \napplicable in the initial years, becomes effective. It has been also observed that many banks at the time of initial loan appraisal, do not take into account the repaying capacity of the \nborrower at normal lending rates . Therefore, the standard asset provisioning on the \noutstanding amount of such loans has been increased from 0.40 per cent to 2.00 per cent in \nview of the higher risk associated with them. The provisioning on these assets would revert \nto 0.40 per cent after 1 year from the date on which the rates are reset at higher rates if the \naccounts remain \u2018standard\u2019. \n5.9.10 Provisioning requirement in terms of Guidelines on Enhancing Credit Supply for Large \nBorrowers through Market Mechanism  \nIn respect of specified borrowers, as per the provisions of the Guidelines on Enhancing \nCredit Supply for Large Borrowers through Market Mechanism dated August 25, 2016, \nbanks shall make additional provisions of 3 percentage points over and above the appli cable \nprovision on the incremental exposure of the banking system in excess of Normally \nPermitted Lending Limit (NPLL) as defined in the said guidelines. This higher provisioning \nrequirement shall be distributed in proportion to each bank\u2019s funded exposure to the \nspecified borrower. \n5.10 Provisioning Coverage Ratio  \n5.10.1 Provisioning Coverage Ratio (PCR) is essentially the ratio of provisioning to gross \nnon-performing assets and indicates the extent of funds a bank has kept aside to cover loan losses.  \n \n5.10.2 From a macro-prudential perspective, banks should build up provisioning and capital \nbuffers in good times i.e. when the profits are good, which can be used for absorbing losses in a downturn. This will enhance the soundness of individual banks, as also the stability of \nthe financial sector. It was, therefore, decided that banks should augment their provisioning \ncushions consisting of specific provisions against NPAs as well as floating provisions, and ensure that their total provisioning coverage ratio, including floating provisions, is not less \nthan 70 per cent. Accordingly, banks  were advised to achieve this norm not later than end-\nSeptember 2010. \n   39 5.10.3 Majority of the banks had achieved PCR of 70 percent and had represented to RBI \nwhether the prescribed PCR is required to be maintained on an ongoing basis. The matter \nwas examined and, the banks were advised that: \n(i) the PCR of 70 percent may be with reference to the gross NPA position in banks \nas on September 30, 2010; \n(ii) the surplus of the provision under PCR vis -a-vis as required as per prudential \nnorms should be segregated into an account styled as \u201ccountercyclical provisioning buffer\u201d, computation of which may be undertaken as per the format given in Annex - 3\n; and \n(iii) this buffer will be allowed to be used by banks for making specific provisions for \nNPAs during periods of system wide downturn, with the prior approval of RBI . \n5.10.4 The PCR of the bank should be disclosed in the Notes to Accounts to the Balance \nSheet.\n6. Writing -off of NPAs  \n6.1 General  \n6.1.1 In terms of Section 43(D) of the Income Tax Act 1961, income by way of interest in \nrelation to such categories of bad and doubtful debts as may be prescribed having regard to the guidelines issued by the RBI in relation to such debts, shall be chargeable to tax in the previous \nyear in which it is credited to the bank\u2019s profit and loss account or received, whichever is \nearlier.  \n6.1.2 This stipulation is not applicable to provisioning required to be made as indicated above. \nIn other words, amounts set aside for making provision for NPAs as above are not eligible for tax deductions. \n6.1.3 Therefore, the banks should either make full provision as per the guidelines or write-off \nsuch advances and claim such tax benefits as are applicable, by evolving appropriate \nmethodology in consultation with their auditors/tax consultants. Recoveries made in such accounts should be offered for tax  purposes as per the rules.  \n6.2 Write-off at Head Office Level  \n \n6.2.1 Banks may write- off advances at Head Office level, even though the relative advances \nare still outstanding in the branch books. However, it is necessary that provision is made as per the classification accorded to the respective accounts. In other words, if an advance is a loss asset, 100 percent provision will have to be made therefor.   40 6.2.2 Banks are custodians of public deposits and are therefore expected to make all efforts to \nprotect the value of their assets. Banks are required to extinguish all available means of \nrecovery before writing off any account fully or partly. It is observed that some banks are \nresorting to technical write off of accounts, which reduces incentives to recover. Banks \nresorting to partial and technical write-offs should not show the remaining part of the loan as \nstandard asset. With a view to bring in more transparency, henceforth banks should disclose full details of write offs, including separate details about technical write offs, in their annual \nfinancial statements as per the format prescribed in the Annex III \u2013 4(a) of the \nMaster Direction \non Financial Statements - Presentation and Disclosures dated August 30, 2021 , as updated \nfrom time to time.  \n7. NPA Management \u2013 Requirement of Effective Mechanism and Granular Data \n7.1 Asset quality of banks is one of the most important indicators of their financial health. Banks \nshould, therefore put in place a robust MIS mechanism for early detection of signs of distress at individual account level as well as at segment level (asset class, industry, geographic, size, etc.) . \nSuch early warning signals should be used for putting in place an effective preventive asset \nquality management framework, including a transparent restructuring mechanism for viable accounts under distress within the prevailing regulatory framework, for preserving the economic value of those entities in all segments. \n7.2 The banks' IT and MIS system should be robust and able to generate reliable and quality \ninformation with regard to their asset quality for effective decision making. There should be no inconsistencies between information furnished under regulatory / statutory reporting and the \nbanks' own MIS reporting. Banks should also have system generated segment wise information \non non-performing assets and restructured assets which may include data on the opening balances, additions, reductions (upgradations, actual recoveries, write-offs etc.), closing balances, provisions held, technical write-offs, etc. \n \n \n  \n \n \n   41 PART B1 - Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets  \n8. Early identification and reporting of stress  \n8.1 Lenders4 shall recognise incipient stress in loan accounts, immediately on default5, by \nclassifying such assets as special mention accounts (SMA) as per the following categories . \nSMA Sub -\ncategories Basis for classification \u2013 Principal or interest payment or \nany other amount wholly or partly overdue between  \nSMA -0 Up to 30 days  \nSMA -1 More than 30 days and up  to 60 days - \nSMA -2 More than 60 days and up  to 90 days  \n \n8.2 In the case of revolving credit facilities like cash credit/overdraft, the SMA sub- categories will \nbe as follows: \nSMA Sub -\ncategories Basis for classification \u2013 Outstanding balance remains \ncontinuously in excess of the sanctioned limit or \ndrawing power, whichever is lower, for a period of:  \nSMA -1 More than 30 days and up  to 60 days  \nSMA -2 More than 60 days and up  to 90  days  \n \n8.3 The above-mentioned instructions on classification of borrower accounts into SMA \ncategories are applicable for all loans  (including retail loans), other than agricultural advances \ngoverned by crop season-based asset classification norms, irrespective of size of exposure of \nthe bank . \n8.4 Classification of borrower accounts as SMA as well as NPA shall be done as part of day -end \nprocess for the relevant date and the SMA or NPA classification date shall be the calendar date \nfor which the day end process is run. In other words, the date of SMA/NPA shall reflect the asset \nclassification status of an account at the day -end of that calendar date. \n                                                      \n4 For the purpose of instructions in part B1 and B2 of this Master Circular, \u2018lenders\u2019 shall mean:  \na. Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks);  \nb. All India Term Financial Institutions (NABARD, NHB, EXIM Bank, and SIDBI);  \nc. Small Finance Banks; and,  \nd. Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC -ND-SI) \nand Deposit taking Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC -D). \n \n5 \u2018Default\u2019 mea ns non-payment of debt (as defined under the IBC) when whole or any part or instalment of \nthe debt has become due and payable and is not paid by the debtor or the corporate debtor, as the case \nmay be.  \nFor revolving facilities like cash credit, default would also mean, without prejudice to the above, the outstanding balance remaining continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit or drawing power, whichever is \nlower, for more than 30 days.\n   42 Example: If due date of a loan account is March 31, 2022, and full dues are not \nreceived before the bank runs the day -end process for this date, the date of overdue \nshall be March 31, 2022. If it continues to remain overdue, then this account shall get \ntagged as SMA-1 upon running day -end process on April 30, 2022 i.e. upon \ncompletion of 30 days of being continuously overdue. Accordingly, the date of SMA -1 \nclassification for that account shall be April 30, 2022. \nSimilarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, it shall get tagged as SMA -2 \nupon running day -end process on May 30, 2022 and if continues to remain overdue \nfurther, it shall get classified as NPA upon running day -end process on June 29, \n2022. \n8.5 As provided in terms of the circular D BS.Dir.OSMOS.No.3327/33.01.001/2013-14 dated \nSeptember 11, 2013  an d subsequent instructions related thereto, scheduled commercial banks \nshall report credit information, including classification of an account as SMA to Central \nRepository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC), on all borrowers having aggregate \nexposure6 of \u20b95 crore and above with them. The CRILC-Main Report shall be submitted on a \nmonthly basis. In addition, the lenders shall submit a weekly report of instances of default by all \nborrowers (with aggregate exposure of \u20b95 crore  and above) by close of business on every \nFriday, or the preceding working day if Friday happens to be a holiday.  \n9. Implementation of Resolution Plan \n \n9.1 All lenders must put in place Board-approved policies for resolution of stressed \nassets, including the timelines for resolution. Since default with any lender is a lagging indicator \nof financial stress faced by the borrower, it is expected that the lenders initiate the process of \nimplementing a resolution plan (RP) even before a default. In any case, once a borrower is \nreported to be in default by any of the lenders , lenders shall undertake a prima facie review of \nthe borrower account within thirty days from such default (\u201c Review Period\u201d). During this \nReview Period of thirty days, lenders may decide on the resolution strategy, including the \nnature of the RP, the approach for implementation of the RP, etc. The lenders may also choose \nto initiate legal proceedings for insolvency or recovery.  \n \n9.2 In cases where RP is to be implemented, all lenders shall enter into an inter -creditor \nagreement (ICA), during the above-said Review Period, to provide for ground rules for \nfinalisation and implementation of the RP in respect of borrowers with credit facilities from more \n                                                      \n6  Aggregate exposure under the guidelines would include all fund based and non-fund based exposure, including \ninvestment exposure with the lenders.    43 than one lender.7 The ICA shall provide that any decision agreed by lenders representing 75 \nper cent by value of total outstanding credit facilities (fund based as well non-fund based) and \n60 per cent of lenders by number shall be binding upon all the lenders. Additionally, the ICA \nmay, inter alia, provide for rights and duties of majority lenders, duties and protection of rights \nof dissenting lenders, treatment of lenders with priority in cash flows/differential security \ninterest, etc. In particular, the RPs shall provide for payment not less than the liquidation \nvalue8 due to the dissenting lenders. \n \n9.3 In respect of accounts with aggregate exposure above a threshold with the lenders, \nas indicated below, on or after the \u2018reference date\u2019, RP shall be implemented within 180 days \nfrom the end of Review Period. The Review Period shall commence not later than: \na. The reference date, if in default as on the reference date; or  \nb. The date of first default after the reference date.  \n9.4 The reference dates for the above purpose shall be as under: \nAggregate exposure of the borrower to \nlenders mentioned at 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c)  Reference date  \n\u20b92000 crore  and above  June 7, 2019  \n\u20b91500 crore  and above, but less than \n\u20b92000 crore  January 1, 2020  \nLess than \u20b915 00 crore  To be announced in due course  \n \n9.5 The RP may involve any action / plan / reorganization including, but not limited to, \nregularisation of the account by payment of all over dues by the borrower entity, sale of the \nexposures to other entities / investors, change in ownership and restructuring9. The RP shall be \nclearly documented by the lenders concerned (even if there is no change in any terms and \nconditions).  \n10. Implementation Conditions for RP  \n \n10.1 RPs involving restructuring / change in ownership in respect of accounts where the \naggregate exposure of lenders is \u20b91 00 crore and above, shall require independent credit \n                                                      \n7 In cases where asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) have exposure to the borrower concerned, they shall also sign \nthe ICA and adhere to all its provisions.  \n8 Liquidation value would mean the estimated realisable value of the assets of the relevant borrower, if such borrower \nwere to be liquidated as on the date of commencement of the Review Period.  \n9 Restructuring is an act in which a lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, \ngrants concessions to the borrower. Restructuring would normally involve modification of terms of the advances / \nsecurities, which would generally include, among others, alteration of payment period / payable amount / the amount of \ninstalments / rate of interest; roll over of credit facilities; sanction of additional credit facility/ release of additional  funds for \nan account in default to aid curing of default / enhancement of existing credit limits; compromise settlements where time for payment of settlement amount exceeds three months.    44 evaluation (ICE) of the residual debt10 by credit rating agencies (CRAs) specifically authorised \nby the Reserve Bank for this purpose. While accounts with aggregate exposur e of \u20b95 00 crore  \nand above shall require two such ICEs, others shall require one ICE. Only such RPs which \nreceive a credit opinion of RP411 or better for the residual debt from one or two CRAs, as the \ncase may be, shall be considered for implementation. Further, ICEs shall be subject to the \nfollowing:  \na) The CRAs shall be directly engaged by the lenders and the payment of fee for such \nassignments shall be made by the lenders.  \nb) If lenders obtain ICE from more than the required number of CRAs, all such ICE opinions  \nshall be RP4 or better for the RP to be considered for implementation. \n10.2 A RP in respect of borrowers to whom the lenders continue to have credit exposure, shall \nbe deemed to be \u2018implemented\u2019 only if the following conditions are met: \na) A RP which does not involve restructuring/change in ownership shall be deemed to be \nimplemented only if the borrower is not in default with any of the lenders as on 180th day \nfrom the end of the Review Period. Any subsequent default after the 180-day period \nshall be treated as a fresh default, triggering a fresh review. \nb) A RP which involves restructuring/change in ownership shall be deemed to be \nimplemented only if all of the following conditions are met: \ni. all related documentation, including execution of necessary agreements between \nlenders and borrower / creation of security charge / perfection of securities, are \ncompleted by the lenders concerned in consonance with the RP being \nimplemented; \nii. the new capital structure and/or changes in the terms of conditions of the existing \nloans get duly reflected in the books of all the lenders and the borrower; and, \niii. borrower is not in default with any of the lenders.  \n10.3 A RP which involves lenders exiting the exposure by assigning the exposures to third \nparty or a RP involving recovery action shall be deemed to be implemented only if the exposure \nto the borrower is fully extinguished.  \n                                                      \n10 The residual debt of the borrower entity, in this context, means the aggregate debt (fund based as well as non-fund \nbased) envisaged to be held by all the lenders as per the proposed RP.  \n11 Annex \u2013 4 provides list of RP symbols that can be provided by CRAs as ICE and their meanings.    45 11.

Definition of Restructuring  \n16.1 Restructuring is an act in which a lender, for economic or  legal reasons relating to the \nborrower's financial difficulty, grants concessions to the borrower. Restructuring may involve \nmodification of terms of the advances / securities, which would generally include, among others, \nalteration of payment period / payable amount / the amount of instalments / rate of interest; roll \nover of credit facilities; sanction of additional credit facility/ release of additional funds for an \naccount in default to aid curing of default / enhancement of existing credit limits; compromise \nsettlements where time for payment of settlement amount exceeds three months. \n16.2 For this purpose, the board-approved policies of lenders on resolution of stressed assets, \nrequired to be in place in terms of these guidelines, shall also have detailed policies on various \nsigns of financial difficulty, providing quantitative as well as qualitative parameters, for \ndetermining financial difficulty as expected from a prudent bank. In order to enable lenders to \nframe respective policies for determination of financial difficultly, a non-exhaustive indicative list of \nsigns of financial difficulty are provided as under14: \na) A default, as per the definition provided in the framework, shall be treated as an indicator \nfor financial difficulty, irrespective of  reasons for the default.  \nb) A borrower not in default, but it is probable that the borrower will default on any of its \nexposures in the foreseeable future without the concession, for instance, when there has \nbeen a pattern of delinquency in payments on its exposures. \nc) A borrower\u2019s outstanding securities have been delisted, are in the process of being \ndelisted, or are under threat of being delisted from an exchange due to noncompliance \nwith the listing requirements or for financial reasons. \nd) On the basis of actual performance, estimates and projections that encompass the \nborrower\u2019s current level of operations, the borrower\u2019s cash flows are assessed to be \ninsufficient to service all of its loans or debt securities (both interest and principal) in \naccordance with the contractual terms of the existing agreement for the foreseeable \nfuture. \ne) A borrower\u2019s credit facilities are in non-performing status or would be categorised as \nnon-performing without the concessions. \n                                                      \n14 Based on the Basel Committee Guidelines on \u201cPrudential treatment of problem assets \u2013 definitions of non- performing \nexposures and forbearance\u201d.    49 f) A borrower\u2019s existing exposures are categorised as exposures that have already \nevidenced difficulty in the borrower\u2019s ability to repay in accordance with the bank\u2019s \ninternal credit rating system.  \ng) The above list provides examples of possible indicators of financial difficulty, but is not \nintended to constitute an exhaustive enumeration of financial difficulty indicators with \nrespect to restructuring. Lenders shall need to complement the above with key financial \nratios and operational parameters which may include quantitative and qualitative \naspects. In particul ar, financial difficulty can be identified even in the absence of arrears \non an exposure. The robustness of the board approved policy and the outcomes would \nbe examined as part of the supervisory oversight of the Reserve Bank. \n17. Prudential  Norms15 \n \n17.1 Asset Classification  \nIn case of restructuring, the accounts classified as 'standard' shall be immediately downgraded \nas non-performing assets (NPAs), i.e., \u2018sub- standard\u2019 to begin with. The NPAs, upon \nrestructuring, would continue to have the same asset classification as prior  to restructuring. In \nboth cases, the asset classification shall continue to be governed by the ageing criteria as laid \nout in Part A of this Master Circular . \n17.2 Conditions for Upgrade \n17.2.1 For MSME accounts where aggregate exposure of the lenders is less than \u20b9 25 \ncrores: \nAn account may be considered for upgradation to \u2018standard\u2019 only if it demonstrates satisfactory \nperformance during the specified period. \u2018Specified Period\u2019 means a period of one year from the \ncommencement of the first payment of interest or principal, whichever is later, on the credit \nfacility with longest period of moratorium under the terms of restructuring package. \u2018Satisfactory \nPerformance\u2019 means no payment (interest and/or principal) shall remain overdue for a period of \nmore than 30 days. In case of cash credit / overdraft account, satisfactory performance means \nthat the outstanding in the account shall not be more than the sanctioned limit or drawing power, \nwhichever is lower, for a period of more than 30 days.  \n \n17.2.2 For all other accounts not included in s ub-p aragraph 17.2.1 \n17.2.2.1 Standard accounts classified as NPA and NPA accounts retained in the same \ncategory on restructuring by the lenders may be upgraded only when all the outstanding loan \n                                                      \n15 Applicable to all resolution plans, including those undertaken under IBC.    50 / facilities in the account demonstrate \u2018satisfactory performance\u201916 during the period from the \ndate of implementation of RP up to the date by which at least 10 per cent of the sum of \noutstanding principal debt17 as per the RP and interest capitalisation sanctioned as part of \nthe restructuring, if any, is repaid ( \u2018monitoring period\u2019). \nProvided that the account cannot be upgraded before one year from the commencement of \nthe first payment of interest or principal (whichever is later) on the credit facility with longest \nperiod of moratorium under the terms of RP. \n17.2.2.2 Additionally, for accounts where the aggregate exposure of lenders is \u20b9100 crores  \nand above at the time of implementation of RP, to qualify for an upgrade, in addition to \ndemonstration of satisfactory performance, the credit facilities of the borrower shall also be \nrated as investment grade18 (BBB- or better), at the time of upgrade, by CRAs accredited by \nthe Reserve Bank for the purpose of bank loan ratings. While accounts with aggregate \nexposure of \u20b9500 crores  and above shall require two ratings, those below \u20b95 00 crores shall \nrequire one rating. If the ratings are obtained from more than the required number of CRAs, \nall such ratings shall be investment grade for the account to qualify for an upgrade. \n17.2.2.3 If the borrower fails to demonstrate satisfactory performance during the monitoring \nperiod, asset classification upgrade shall be subject to implementation of a fresh \nrestructuring/ change in ownership under Parts B1 and B2 of this Master Circular  or under  \nIBC. Lenders shall make an additional provision of 15% for such accounts at the end of the \nReview Period. This additional provision, along with other additional provisions, may be \nreversed as per the norms laid down at Paragraph 11.5. \n17.2.2.4 Provisions held on restructured assets may be reversed when the accounts are \nupgraded to standard category. \n17.2.2.5 Any default by the borrower in any of the credit facilities with any of the lenders \n(including any lender where the borrower is not in \u201cspecified period\u201d ) subsequent to \nupgrade in asset classification as above but before the end of the specified period, will \nrequire a fresh RP to be implemented within the above timelines as any default would entail. \nHowever, lenders shall make an additional provision of  15% for such accounts at the end of \n                                                      \n16 Satisfactory performance means that the borrower entity is not in default at any point of time during the period \nconcerned.  \n17 Outstanding principal debt shall include all credit facilities, including debt/debt like instruments (viz., non-convertible \ndebentures, optionally convertible debentures, optionally convertible preference shares, non-convertible preference shares \netc.) that exist post implementation of the RP. Only equity and instruments compulsorily convertible into equity (without \nany embedded optionality) shall be exempt from determining outstanding principal debt.  \n18 These ratings shall be the normal ratings provided by the CRAs and not ICEs referred to in paragraph 10.1 of this \nMaster Circular.    51 the Review Period. This additional provision, along with other additional provisions, may be \nreversed as per the norms laid down at Paragraph 11.5 of this Master C ircular. \n\u201cSpecified period\u201d means the period from the date of implementation of RP19 up to the date by \nwhich at least 20 per cent of the sum of outstanding principal debt as per the RP and interest \ncapitalisation sanctioned as part of the restructuring, if any, is repaid.  \n18. Provisioning Norms20 \n18.1 Accounts restructured under the revised framework shall attract provisioning as per the \nasset classification category as laid out in part A of this Master Circular . \n18.2 In respect of accounts of debtors where a final RP, as approved by the Committee of \nCreditors, has been submitted by the Resolution Professional for approval of the Adjudicating \nAuthority (in terms of section 30(6) of the IBC), lenders may keep the provisions held as on the \ndate of such submission of RP frozen for a period of six months from the date of submission of \nthe plan or up to 90 days from the date of approval of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating \nAuthority in terms of section 31 (1) of the IBC, whichever is earlier.  \n18.3 The above facility of freezing the quantum of the provision shall be available only in cases \nwhere the provisioning held by the lenders as on the date of submission of the plan for approval \nof the Adjudicating Authority is more than the expected provisioning required to be held in the \nnormal course upon implementation of the approved resolution plan, taking into account the \ncontours of the resolution plan approved by Committee of Creditors/ Adjudicating Authority, as \nthe case may be, and extant prudential norms. However, lenders shall not reverse the excess \nprovisions held as on the date of submission of the resolution plan for approval of the \nAdjudicating Authority at this stage. In cases where the provisioning held is lower than the \nexpected required provisioning, lenders shall make additional provisioning to the extent of the \nshortfall. Subsequent to the lapse of above mentioned period, provisioning shall be as per the \nnorms laid out in Part A of this Master Circular. The facility of freezing of provisions  shall also \nlapse immediately if the Adjudicating Authority rejects the resolution plan thus submitted. Asset \nclassification in respect of such borrower shall continue be governed by the extant asset \nclassification norms. \n18.4 MSME accounts restructured under the circulars DBR.No.BP.BC.18/21.04.048/2018-19 \ndated January 1, 2019  and DOR.No.B P.BC.34/21.04.048/2019-20 dated February 11, 2020  shall \nattract the provisioning requirements prescribed therein. \n                                                      \n19 For accounts restructured under IBC, the specified period shall be deemed to commence from the date of \nimplementation of the resolution plan as approved by the Adjudicating Authority  \n20 Additional provisions for delayed implementation of RP within timelines shall be as per paragraphs 11.1 \u2013 11.4 of this \nMaster Circular    52 19. Additional Finance  \n19.1 Any additional finance approved under the RP (including any resolution plan approved by \nthe Adjudicating Authority under IBC) may be treated as 'standard asset' during the monitoring \nperiod under the approved RP, provided the account demonstrates satisfactory performance (as \ndefined at footnote 16 ) during the monitoring period. If the restructured asset fails to perform \nsatisfactorily during the monitoring period or does not qualify for upgradation at the end of the \nmonitoring period, the additional finance shall be placed in the same asset classification category \nas the restructured debt.  \n19.2 Similarly, any interim finance [as defined in section 5 (15) of the IBC] extended by the \nlenders to debtors undergoing insolvency proceedings under IBC may be treated  as \u2018standard \nasset\u2019 during the insolvency resolution process period as defined in the IBC. During this period, \nasset classification and provisioning for the interim finance shall be governed by the norms laid \ndown in Part A of this Master Circular. Subsequently, upon approval of the resolution plan by the \nAdjudicating Authority, treatment of such interim finance shall be as per the norms applicable to \nadditional finance, as per Paragraph 19.1 above. \n20. Income recognition norms   \n20.1 Interest income in respect of restructured accounts classified as 'standard assets' may be \nrecognized on accrual basis and that in respect of the restructured accounts classified as 'non-\nperforming assets' shall be recognised on cash basis.  \n20.2 In the case of additional finance in accounts where the pre-restructuring facilities were \nclassified as NPA, the interest income shall be recognised only on cash basis except when the \nrestructuring is accompanied by a change in ownership. \n21. Conversion of Principal  into Debt / Equity and Unpaid Interest into 'Funded Interest Term Loan' \n(FITL), Debt or Equity Instruments  \n21.1 An act of restructuring might create new securities issued by the borrower which would be \nheld by the lenders in lieu of a portion of the pre-restructured exposure. The FITL / debt / equity \ninstruments created by conversion of principal / unpaid interest, as the case may be, shall be \nplaced in the same asset classification category in which the restructured advance has been \nclassified.  \n21.2 The provisioning applicable to such instruments shall be the higher of: \na) The provisioning applicable to the asset classification category in which such \ninstruments are held; or    53 b) The provisioning applicable based on the fair valuation of such instruments as \nprovided in the following paragraphs. \n21.3 Debt/quasi -debt/equity instruments21 acquired by the lenders as part of a RP shall be valued \nas under:  \na) Debentures/bonds shall be valued as per the instructions contained in paragraph 10 \nof the Master D irection - Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and \nOperation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated August 25, 2021  ( as amended \nfrom time to time). \nb) Conversion of debt into Zero Coupon Bonds (ZCBs)/low coupon bonds (LCBs) as \npart of RP shall be subject to the conditions prescribed in paragraph 12 of the \nMaster Directions - Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of \nInvestment Portfolio by Banks dated August 25, 2021  ( as amended from time to \ntime). Such ZCBs/LCBs shall be valued as per the instructions contained in Section \n10 of the above said Master Di rection, subject to the following: \ni. Where the borrower fails to build up the sinking fund as required under the \nabove said Master Circular, ZCBs/LCBs of such borrower shall be \ncollectively valued at Re.1 \nii. Instruments without a pre-specified terminal value would be collectively \nvalued at Re. 1. \nc) Equity instruments, where classified as standard, shall be valued at market value, if \nquoted, or else, should be valued at the lowest value arrived using the following \nvaluation methodologies: \ni. Book value (without considering 'revaluation reserves', if any) which is to be \nascertained from the company's latest audited balance sheet. The date as \non which the latest balance sheet is drawn up should not precede the date of \nvaluation by more than 18 months. In case the latest audited balance sheet \nis not available the shares are to be collectively valued at Re.1 per company. \nii. Discounted cash flow method where the discount factor is the actual interest \nrate charged to the borrower on the residual debt post restructuring plus a \nrisk premium to be determined as per the board approved policy considering \nthe factors affecting the value of the equity. The risk premium will be subject \n                                                      \n21 These instruments shall be subject to all the instructions contained in Master Direction - P rudential Norms for \nClassification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated August 25, 2021  ( as amended from time to \ntime) to the extent they are not inconsistent with the instructions contained in this circular.    54 to a floor of 3 per cent and the overall discount factor will be subject to a floor \nof 14 per cent. Further, cash flows (cash flow available from the current as \nwell as immediately prospective (not more than six months) level of \noperations) occurring within 85 per cent of the useful economic life of the \nproject only shall be reckoned.  \nd) Equity instruments, where classified as NPA , shall be valued at market value, if \nquoted, or else, shall be collectively valued at Re.1. \ne) Preference Shares shall be valued as per the instructions contained in paragraph 10 \nof the Master D irection - Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and \nOperation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated August 25, 2021  ( as amended \nfrom time to time), subject to the following modifications:  \ni. The discount rate shall be subject to a floor of weighted average actual \ninterest rate charged to the borrower on the residual debt after restructuring \nplus a mark -up of 1.5 percent.  \nii. Where preference dividends/coupons are in arrears, no credit should be \ntaken for accrued dividends/coupons and the value determined as above on \nDCF basis should be discounted further by at least 15 per cent if arrears are \nfor one year, 25 per cent if arrears are for two years, so on and so forth ( i.e., \nwith 10 percent increments). \n21.4 The overarching principle should be that valuation of instruments arising out of resolution of \nstressed assets shall be based on conservative assessment of cash flows and appropriate \ndiscount rates to reflect the stressed cash flows of the borrowers. Statutory Auditors should also \nspecifically examine as to whether the valuations of such instruments reflect the risk of loss \nassociated with such instruments. \n21.5 In case lenders have acquired unquoted instruments on conversion of debt as a part of a \nRP, and if the RP is not deemed as implemented, such unquoted instruments shall collectively be \nvalued at Re. 1 at that point, and till the RP is treated as implemented. \n21.6 The unrealised income represented by FITL / Debt or equity instrument should have a \ncorresponding credit in an account styled as \"Sundry Liabilities Account (Interest Capitalization)\". \n21.7 The unrealised income represented by FITL / Debt or equity instrument can only be \nrecognised in the profit and loss account as under: \na) FITL/debt instruments: only on sale or redemption, as the case may be;  \nb) Unquoted equity/ quoted equity (where classified as NPA): only on sale;   55 c) Quoted equity (where classified as standard): market value of the equity as on the \ndate of upgradation, not exceeding the amount of unrealised income converted to \nsuch equity. Subsequent changes to value of the equity will be dealt as per the \nextant prudential norms on investment portfolio of banks.  \n22. Change in Ownership \n22.1 In case of change in ownership of the borrowing entities, credit facilities of the concerned \nborrowing entities may be continued/upgraded as \u2018standard\u2019 after the change in ownership is \nimplemented, either under the IBC or under this framework. If the change in ownership is  \nimplemented under this framework, then the classification as \u2018standard\u2019 shall be subject to the \nfollowing conditions:  \na) Lenders shall conduct necessary due diligence in this regard and clearly establish \nthat the acquirer is not a person disqualified in terms of Section 29A of the IBC. \nAdditionally, the \u2018new promoter\u2019 should not be a person/entity/subsidiary/associate \netc. (domestic as well as overseas), from the existing promoter/promoter group. \nLenders should clearly establish that the acquirer does not belong to the existing \npromoter group (as defined in Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of \nCapital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018).  \nb) The new promoter shall have acquired at least 26 per cent of the paid up equity \ncapital as well as voting rights of the borrower entity and shall be the single largest \nshareholder of the borrower entity. \nc) The new promoter shall be in \u2018control\u2019 of the borrower entity as per the definition of \n\u2018control\u2019 in the Companies Act, 2013 / regulations issued by the Securities and \nExchange Board of India/any other applicable regulations / accounting standards as \nthe case may be. \nd) The conditions for implementation of RP as laid out in Part B1 of this Master Circular \nare complied with. \n22.2 Upon change in ownership, all the outstanding loans/credit facilities of the borrowing entity \nneed to demonstrate satisfactory performance (as defined at footnote 18 ) during the monitoring \nperiod. If the account fails to perform satisfactorily at any point of time during the monitoring \nperiod, it shall trigger a fresh Review Period, in terms of Paragraph 9.1 above. \n22.3 The quantum of provisions held (excluding additional provisions) by the bank against the \nsaid account as on the date of change in ownership of the borrowing entities can be reversed \nonly after the end of monitoring period subject to satisfactory performance during the same.   56 23. Principles on classification of sale and lease back transactions as restructuring  \n23.1 A sale and leaseback transaction of the assets of a borrower or other transactions of similar \nnature will be treated as an event of restructuring for the purpose of asset classification and \nprovisioning in the books of lenders with regard to the residual debt of the seller as well as the \ndebt of the buyer if all the following conditions are met: \na) The seller of the assets is in financial difficulty;  \nb) Significant portion, i.e. more than 50 per cent, of the revenues of the buyer from the \nspecific asset is dependent upon the cash flows from the seller; and \nc) 25 per cent or  more of the loans availed by the buyer for the purchase of the specific \nasset is funded by the lenders who already have a credit exposure to the seller.  \n24.

Wilful Defaulters and Non-Cooperative Borrowers  \n \nInstructions regarding treatment of Wilful Defaulters are contained in our  Master Circular \nDBR.No.CID.BC.57/20.16.003/2014 -15 dated July 1, 2014  ( updated up to January 7, 2015)  on \n\u2018Wilful Defaulters\u2019 as updated from time to time. Banks are required to strictly adhere to these \nguidelines. In addition to these instructions and with a view to ensuring better corporate \ngovernance structure in companies and ensuring accountability of  independent/professional \ndirectors, promoters, auditors, etc. henceforth, the following prudential measures will be applicable: \na) The provisioning in respect of existing loans/exposures of banks to companies having director/s (other than nominee directors of government/financial institutions brought on board at the time of distress), whose name/s appear more than once in the list of wilful \ndefaulters, will be 5% in cases of standard accounts; if such account is classified as NPA, it will attract accelerated provisioning as  under:  \nAsset \nClassification Period as NPA  Regula r provisioning (%)  Accelerated \nprovisioning (%)  \nSub- standard  \n(secured)  Up to 6 months  15 No change  \n6 months to 1 year  15 25 \nSub-standard  \n(unsecured ab-\ninitio)  Up to 6 months  25 (other than \ninfrastructure loans)  25 \n20 (infrastructure loans)  \n6 months to 1 year  25 (other than \ninfrastructure loans)  40 \n20 (infrastructure loans)  \nDoubtful I  2nd year  25 (secured portion)  40 (secured portion)  \n100 (unsecured portion)  100 (unsecured portion)  \nDoubtful II  3rd & 4th year  40 (secured portion)  100 for both secured and \nunsecured portions  100 (unsecured portion)  \nDoubtful III  5th year onwards  100 100 \nb) This is a prudential measure since the expected losses on exposures to such borrowers \nare likely to be higher. It is reiterated that no additional facilities should be granted by any bank/FI to the listed wilful defaulters, in terms of Paragraph 2.5 (a) of \nMaster Circular on \nWilful Defaulters dated July 1, 2015 .   59 c) With a view to discouraging borrowers/defaulters from being unreasonable and non-\ncooperative with lenders in their bonafide resolution/recovery efforts, banks may classify \nsuch borrowers as non-cooperative borrowers23, after giving them due notice if \nsatisfactory clarifications are not furnished. Banks will be required to report classification of such borrowers to CRILC. Detailed instructions in this regard have been issued vide  \ncircular DBR.No.CID.BC.54/20.16.064/2014-15 dated December 22, 2014\n on Non-\nCooperative Borrowers.  \nd) Further, if any particular entity is reported as non-cooperative, any fresh exposure to such \na borrower will , by implication, entail greater risk necessitating higher provisioning. \nBanks/FIs will therefore be required to make higher provisioning as applicable to \nsubstandard assets in respect of new loans sanctioned to such borrowers as also new \nloans sanctioned to any other company that has on its board of directors any of the whole time directors/promoters of a non- cooperative borrowing company or any firm in which \nsuch a non- cooperative borrower is in charge of management of the affairs. However, for \nthe purpose of asset classification and income recognition, the new loans would be \ntreated as standard assets. This is a prudential measure since the expected losses on \nexposures on exposures to such non -cooperative borrowers are likely to be higher.  \n29. Dissemination of Information \n29.1 At present, the list of s uit filed accounts and non-suit filed accounts of Wilful Defaulters \n(\u20b925 lakh and above) is submitted by banks to the Credit Information Companies (CICs) of \nwhich they are member(s), who display the same on their respective websites as and when received. In order to make the current system of banks/FIs reporting names of suit filed accounts and non-suit filed accounts of Wilful Defaulters and its availability to the banks by CICs as current as possible, banks are advised to forward data on wilful defaulters to the CICs at the \nearliest but not later than a month from the reporting date and they must use/ furnish the \ndetailed information as per the format prescribed in our \nMaster Circular \nDBR.No.CID.BC.57/20.16.003/2014 -15 dated July 1, 2015  on \u2018Wilful Defaulters\u2019, as updated \nfrom time to time. \n29.2 In terms of our Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters mentioned above, in case any \nfalsification of accounts on the part of the borrowers is observed by the banks / FIs, and if it is observed that the auditors were negligent or deficient in conducting the audit, banks should \nlodge a formal complaint against the auditors of the borrowers with the Institute of Chartered \n                                                      \n23 A non-cooperative borrower is one who does not engage constructively with his lender by defaulting in timely repayment \nof dues while having ability to pay, thwarting lenders\u2019 efforts for recovery of their dues by not providing necessary \ninformation sought, denying access to assets financed / collateral securities, obstructing sale of securities, etc. In effect , a \nnon-cooperat ive borrower is a defaulter who deliberately stone walls legitimate efforts of the lenders to recover their dues.    60 Accountants of India (ICAI) to enable the ICAI to examine and fix accountability of the auditors. \nRBI reiterates these instructions for strict compliance. Pending disciplinary ac tion by ICAI, the \ncomplaints may also be forwarded to the RBI (Department of Banking Supervision, Central \nOffice) and IBA for records. IBA would circulate the names of the CA firms against whom many \ncomplaints have been received amongst all banks who shoul d consider this aspect before \nassigning any work to them. RBI would also share such information with other financial sector regulators/Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)/Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). \n29.3 Further, banks may seek explanation from advocates who wrongly certify as to clear legal \ntitles in respect of assets or valuers who overstate the security value, by negligence or \nconnivance, and if no reply/satisfactory clarification is received from them within one month, \nthey may report their names to IBA. The IBA may circulate the names of such \nadvocates/valuers among its members for consideration before availing of their services in future. The IBA would create a central registry for this purpos e. \n30. Bank Loans for Financing Promoters\u2019 Contribution  \n30.1 I n terms of extant instructions on Bank Loans for Financing Promoters Contribution as \nconsolidated in our Master Circular DBOD.No.Dir.BC.16/13.03.00/2014-15 dated July 1,  201 5 \non \u2018Loans and Advances \u2013  Statutory and Other Restrictions\u2019, the promoters' contribution towards \nthe equity capital of a company should come from their own resources and banks should not normally grant advances to take up shares of other companies.  \n30.2 It has been decided that banks can extend finance to \u2018specialized\u2019 entities established for \nacquisition of troubled companies subject to the general guidelines applicable to advances \nagainst shares/debentures/bonds as contained in the above-mentioned Master Circular and \nother regulatory and statutory exposure limits. The lenders should, however, assess the risks associated with such financing and ensure that these entities are adequately capitalized, and \ndebt equity ratio for such entity is not more than 3:1.  \n30.3 In this connection, a \u2018specialized\u2019 entity will be a body corporate exclusively set up for the \npurpose of taking over and turning around troubled companies and promoted by individuals \nor/and institutional promoters (including Government) having professional expertise in turning around \u2018troubled companies\u2019 and eligible to make investments in the industry/segment to which \nthe target asset belonged. \n31. Credit Risk Management  \n31.1 Banks are advised that they should strictly follow the credit risk management guidelines \ncontained in our circular DBOD.No.BP.(SC).BC.98/21.04.103/99 dated October 7, 1999 on \u2018Risk   61 Management Systems in Banks\u2019 and DBOD.No.BP.520/21.04.103/2002-03 dated October 12, \n2002  on \u2018 Guidance Notes on Management of Credit Risk and Market Risk\u2019  \n \n31.2 It is reiterated that lenders should carry out their independent and objective credit appraisal \nin all cases and must not depend on credit appraisal reports prepared by outside consultants, \nespecially the in-house consultants of the borrowing entity. \n \n31.3 Banks/lenders should carry out sensitivity tests/scenario analysis, especially for \ninfrastructure projects, which should inter alia include project delays and cost overruns. This will \naid in taking a view on viability of the project at the time of deciding on deferment of DCCO/restructuring.  \n \n31.4 Lenders should ascertain the source and quality of equity capital brought in by the \npromoters /shareholders. Multiple leveraging, especially, in infrastructure projects, is a matter of concern as it effectively camouflages the financial ratios such as Debt/Equity ratio, leading to adverse selection of the borrowers. Therefore, lenders should ensure at the time of credit \nappraisal that debt of the parent company is not infused as equity capital of the subsidiary/SPV. \n \n31.5 Ministry of Corporate Affairs had introduced the concept of a Director Identification Number \n(DIN) with the insertion of Sections 266A to 266G of Companies (Amendment) Act, 2006. \nFurther, in terms of Paragraph 5.4 of our Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters dated July 1, 2015\n, \nin order to ensure that directors are correctly identified and in no case, persons whose names appear to be similar to the names of directors appearing in the list of wilful defaulters, are wrongfully denied credit facilities on such grounds, banks/FIs have been advised to include the Director Identification Number (DIN) as one of the fields in the data submitted by them to \nReserve Bank of India/Credit Information Companies.  \n \n31.6 It is reiterated that while carrying out the credit appraisal, banks should verify as to whether \nthe names of any of the directors of the companies appear in the list of defaulters/ wilful \ndefaulters by way of reference to DIN/PAN etc. Further, in case of any doubt arising on account \nof identical names, banks should use independent sources for confirmation of the identity of \ndirectors rather than seeking declaration from the borrowing company.  \n \n31.7 Paragraph 2.7 of the Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters states that, \u201cwith a view to \nmonitoring the end-use of funds, if the lenders desire a specific certification from the borrowers\u2019 auditors regarding diversion / siphoning of funds by the borrower, the lender should award a separate mandate to the auditors for the purpose. To facilitate such certification by the auditors   62 the banks and FIs will also need to ensure that appropriate covenants in the loan agreements are \nincorporated to enable award of such a mandate by the lenders to the borrowers / auditors\u201d.  \n \n31.8 In addition to the above, banks are advised that with a view to ensuring proper end-use of \nfunds and preventing diversion/siphoning of funds by the borrowers, lenders could consider engaging their own auditors for such specific certification purpose without relying on certification given by borrower\u2019s auditors. However, this cannot substitute bank\u2019s basic minimum own \ndiligence in the matter. \n32. Registration of Transactions with CERSAI  \nIn terms of circular DBOD.Leg.No.BC.86/09.08.011/2010-11 dated April 21, 2011\n on \u2018Setting up of \nCentral Electronic Registry under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and \nEnforcement of Security Interest Act 2002\u2019, as amended from time to time, banks are required to \nregister, on an ongoing basis, the transactions relating to securitization and reconstruction of \nfinancial assets on the CERSAI portal. Banks also need to file, on an ongoing basis, the following \ntypes of security interest on the CERSAI portal  to secure any loans or advances:  \na) particulars of creation, modification, or satisfaction of security interest in mortgage by deposit of title deeds ; \nb) particulars of creation, modification, or satisfaction of security interest in mortgage other \nthan mortgage by deposit of title deeds; \nc) particulars of creation, modification, or satisfaction of security interest in hypothecation of \nplant and machinery, stocks, debts including book debts or receivables, whether existing \nor future. \nd) particulars of creation, modification, or satisfaction of security interest in i ntangible \nassets, being know how, patent, copyright, trademark, licence, franchise or any other business or commercial right of similar nature. \ne) particulars of creation, modification, or satisfaction of security interest in any \u2018under \nconstruction\u2019 residential or commercial or a part thereof by an agreement or instrument \nother than mortgage. \n33. Board Oversight \n33.1 The Board of Directors of banks should take all necessary steps to arrest the deteriorating \nasset quality in their books and should focus on improving the credit risk management system. Early recognition of problems in asset quality and resolution envisaged in these guidelines \nrequires the lenders to be proactive and make use of CRILC.   63 33.2 The boards of banks should put in place a system for proper and timely classification of \nborrowers as wilful defaulters or/and non-cooperative borrowers. Further, Boards of banks should \nperiodically review the accounts classified as such, say on a half yearly basis.  \n34. Specification of due date/repayment date  \n \nThe exact due dates for repayment of a loan, frequency of repayment, breakup between principal and \ninterest, examples of SMA/NPA classification dates, etc. shall be clearly specified in the loan \nagreement and the borrower shall be apprised of the same at the time of loan sanction and also at \nthe time of subsequent changes, if any, to the sanction terms/loan agree ment till full repayment of the \nloan. In cases of loan facilities with moratorium on payment of principal and/or interest, the exact date \nof commencement of repayment shall also be specified in the loan agreements. These instructions \nshall be complied with at the earliest, but not later than December 31, 2021, in respect of fresh loans. \nIn case of existing loans, however, compliance to these instructions shall necessarily be ensured as \nand when such loans become due for renewal/review.  \n35.    Consumer Education  \n \nWith a view to increasing awareness among the borrowers, bank s shall place consumer education \nliterature on their websites, explaining with examples, the concepts of date of overdue, SMA and \nNPA classification and upgradation, with specific reference to day -end process. Bank s may also \nconsider displaying such consum er education literature in their branches by means of posters \nand/or other appropriate media. Further, it shall also be ensured that their front-line officers educate \nborrowers about all these concepts, with respect to loans availed by them, at the time of  \nsanction/disbursal/renewal of loans.  64 PART D - ANNEXES  \nAnnex - 1   \nDetails of Gross Advances, Gross NPAs, Net Advances and Net NPAs  \nPart A   \n(Rs. in Crore up to two decimals)  \nParticulars  Amount  \n1.

'Unsecured loans' means the loans not secured by any tangible asset.  \n \n1.2 Background  \nThe credit related matters of banks have been progressively deregulated by Reserve \nBank of India. Consistent with the policy of bestowing greater operational freedom to banks in the matter of credit dispensation and in the context of mandatory registration of NBFCs with the Reserve Bank, most of the aspects relating to financing of NBFCs by banks have also been deregulated. However, in view of the sensitivities attached to financing of certain types of activities undertaken by NBFCs, restrictions on \nfinancing of such activities continue to be in force.  \n 5 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Bank Finance to NBFCs \u2013  2022\"  2. Bank Finance to NBFCs registered with RBI  \n2.1 The ceiling on bank credit linked to Net Owned Fund (NOF) of NBFCs has been \nwithdrawn in respect of all NBFCs which are statutorily registered with RBI and are \nengaged in principal business of asset financing, loan, factoring and investment \nactivities. Accordingly, banks may extend need based working capital facilities as well as term loans to all NBFCs registered with RBI  and engaged in infrastructure financing, \nequipment leasing, hire- purchase, loan, factoring and investment activities  subject to \nprovisions of para 8 of these guidelines . \n2.2 In the light of the experience gained by NBFCs in financing second hand assets, banks may also extend finance to NBFCs against second hand assets financed by \nthem.  \n2.3 Banks may formulate suitable loan policy with the approval of their Boards of \nDirectors within the prudential guidelines and exposure norms prescribed by the Reserve Bank to extend various kinds of credit facilities to NBFCs subject to the \ncondition that the activities indicated in paragraphs 4 and 6 are not financed by them.  \n \n3. Bank Finance to NBFCs not requiring Registration1 \nIn terms of \u201cMaster Direction -  Exemptions from the provisions of RBI Act, 1934\u201d  dated \nAugust 25, 2016, few categories of non- banking financial companies are exempted \nfrom certain provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (the RBI Act, 1934), \nincluding the need for registration with the Reserve B ank. For such NBFCs not \nneeding registration with the R eserve Bank,  banks may take their credit decisions on \nthe basis of usual factors like the purpose of credit, nature and quality of underlying \nassets, repayment capacity of borrowers as also risk perception, etc.  \n \n4. Activities not e ligible for Bank Credit  \n4.1 The following activities undertaken by NBFCs, are not eligible for bank credit:  \n(i) Bills discounted / rediscounted by NBFCs, except for rediscounting of bills \ndiscounted by NBFCs arising from sale of -  \n                                                            \n1 While financing NBFCs,  which do not require registration with RBI, banks should also refer to the guidelines / \nnotifications issued in this regard from time to time by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India.  6 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Bank Finance to NBFCs \u2013  2022\"  (a) commercial vehicles (including light commerci al vehicles), and \n(b) two wheeler and three wheeler vehicles, subject to the following conditions:  \n\u2022 the bills should have been drawn by the manufacturer on dealers only;  \n\u2022 the bills should represent genuine sale transactions as may be ascertained from \nthe chassis / engine number; and \n\u2022 before rediscounting the bills, banks should satisfy themselves about the bona fides and track record of NBFCs which have discounted the bills.  \n(ii) Investments of NBFCs both of current and long- term nature, in any  company / entit y \nby way of shares, debentures, etc. However, Stock Broking Companies may be \nprovided need- based credit against shares and debentures held by them as stock -in-\ntrade.  \n(iii) Unsecured loans / inter -corporate deposits by NBFCs to / in any company.  \n(iv) All ty pes of loans and advances by NBFCs to their subsidiaries, group companies \n/ entities.  \n(v) Finance to NBFCs for further lending to individuals for subscribing to Initial Public \nOfferings (IPOs) and for purchase of shares from secondary market.  \n4.2 Leased and Sub- Leased Assets \nAs banks can extend financial assistance to equipment leasing companies, they \nshould not enter into lease agreements departmentally with such companies as well \nas other Non- Banking Financial Companies engaged in equipment leasing.  \n \n5. Bank Finance to Factoring Companies  \nNotwithstanding the restrictions mentioned at Paragraph 4 .1 (i) and 4.1 (iii) above, \nbanks can extend financial assistance to support the factoring business of Factoring Companies, which comply with the following criteria:  \n(a) The companies qualify as factoring companies and carry out their business under \nthe provisions of the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 and Notifications issued by the \nReserve Bank in this regard from time to time.  \n(b) They derive at least 50 per cent of their income from factoring activity.  7 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Bank Finance to NBFCs \u2013  2022\"  (c) The receivables purchased / financed, irrespective of whether on 'with recourse' or \n'without recourse' basis, form at least 50 per cent of the assets of the Factoring \nCompany.  \n(d) The assets / income referred to above would not include the assets / income \nrelating to any bill discounting facility extended by the Factoring Company.  \n(e) The financial assistance extended by the Factoring Companies is secured by \nhypothecation or assignment of receivables i n their favour.  \n6. Other Prohibitions on Bank Finance to NBFCs  \n6.1 Bridge loans / interim finance \nBanks should not grant bridge loans of any nature, or interim finance against capital / debenture issues and / or in the form of loans of a bridging nature pending raising of long- term funds from the market by way of capital, deposits, etc. to all categories of \nNon-Banking Financial Companies. Banks should strictly follow these instructions and \nensure that they are not circumvented in any manner whatsoever by purport and / or intent by sanction of credit under a different nomenclature like unsecured negotiable \nnotes, floating rate interest bonds, etc., as also short -term loans, the repayment of \nwhich is proposed / expected to be made out of funds to be or likely  to be mobilised \nfrom external / other sources and not out of the surplus generated by the use of the \nasset(s).  \n6.2 Advances against collateral security of shares to NBFCs  \nShares and debentures cannot be accepted as collateral securities for secured loans granted to NBFC borrowers for any purpose.  \n6.3 Restriction on guarantees for placement of funds with NBFCs  \nBanks should not execute guarantees covering inter -company deposits / loans thereby \nguaranteeing refund of deposits / loans accepted by NBFCs / firms  from other NBFCs \n/ firms. The restriction would cover all types of deposits / loans irrespective of their \nsource, including deposits / loans received by NBFCs from trusts and other institutions. Guarantees should not be issued for the purpose of indirectl y enabling the placement \nof deposits with NBFCs.  However, banks are permitted to provide partial credit \nenhancement (PCE) to bonds issued by NBFC -ND-SIs and Housing Finance 8 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Bank Finance to NBFCs \u2013  2022\"  Companies (HFCs) as per guidelines contained at para 2.4 of the Master Circular on \nGuarantees and co- acceptances dated November 09, 2021,  as updated from time to \ntime.  \n7. Prudential ceilings for exposure of banks to NBFCs  \n7.1 The defini tion and method of computation of exposure would be as prescribed in \nthe circular on Large Exposures Framework dated June 03, 2019 and amendments \nmade from time to time . \n7.2 Banks\u2019 exposures to a single NBFC  (excluding gold loan companies) will be \nrestricted to 20 percent of their eligible capital base (Tier I capital) . However, based \non the risk perception, more stringent  exposure limits in respect of certain categories \nof NBFCs may be considered by banks . Banks\u2019 exposures to a group of connected \nNBFCs or group of connected counterparties having NBFCs in the group will be \nrestricted to 25 percent of their Tier I Capital  as detailed in circular on Large Exposures \nFramework dated June 03, 2019 read with circular on Large Exposures Framework \ndated September 12,  2019.  \n7.3 The exposure of a bank to a single NBFC which is predominantly engaged in \nlending against collateral of gold jewellery (i.e. such loans comprising 50 per cent or more of their financial assets), shall not exceed 7.5 per cent of the bank \u2019s capital funds  \n(Tier I plus  Tier II Capital).  However, this exposure ceiling may go up by 5 per cent, \ni.e., up to 12.5 per cent of banks\u2019 capital funds if the additional exposure is on account of funds on- lent by such NBFCs to the infrastructure sector  as detailed in circular  on \nBank Finance to NBFCs Predominantly Engaged in lending against Gold dated May \n18, 2012.   \n7.4 Banks may also consider fixing internal limits for their  aggregate exposure to all \nNBFCs put together.   \n7.5 Banks should have an internal sub- limit on their aggregate exposures to all \nNBFCs, having gold loans to the extent of 50 per cent or more of their total financial assets, taken together. This sub -limit sh ould be within the internal limit fixed by the \nbanks for their aggregate exposure to all NBFCs put together as prescribed in \nparagraph 7.4 above.   9 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Bank Finance to NBFCs \u2013  2022\"  7.6 Infusion of eligible capital funds after the published balance sheet date may also \nbe taken into account for the purpose of computing exposure ceiling. Banks should \nobtain an external auditor's certificate on completion of the augmentation of capital and submit the same to the Reserve Bank of India (Department of Supervision) before \nreckoning the additions to capital funds  \n7.7. Banks shall adhere to the intra-group limits in accordance with Guidelines on \nManagement of Intra -Group Transactions and Exposures dated February 11, 2014.   \n \n8. Restrictions regarding investments made by banks in securities / instruments \nissued by NBFCs  \n8.1 Banks should not invest in Zero Coupon Bonds (ZCBs ) issued by NBFCs unless \nthe issuer NBFC builds up sinking fund for all accrued interest and keeps  it invested \nin liquid investments / securities (Government bonds).  \n8.2 Banks are permitted to also invest in Non- Convertible Debentures (NCDs) with \noriginal or initial maturity up to one year issued by NBFCs. However, while investing \nin such instruments b anks should be guided by the extant prudential guidelines in \nforce, ensure that the issuer has disclosed the purpose for which the NCDs are being issued in the disclosure document and such purposes are eligible for bank finance in \nterms of instructions giv en in the preceding paragraphs.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n 10 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Bank Finance to NBFCs \u2013  2022\"  Appendix  \nList of Circulars Consolidated in the Master Circular  \nSl \nNo. Circular No Date  Subject  \n1.

Introduction \n \nCapital acts as a buffer in times of crisis or poor performance by a bank. Sufficiency of  \ncapital also instills depositors' confidence. As such, adequacy of capital is one of the pre-\nconditions  for licensing of  a new  bank as  well as its continuance in business.  \n \n2. Statutory  Requirements \n \nIn terms of the provisions contained in Section 11 of Banking Regulation Act (AACS), no  \nco-operative bank shall commence or carry on banking business unless the aggregate  \nvalue of its paid- up capital and reserves is not less than one lakh of rupees. In addition,  \nunder Section 22(3)(d) of the above Act, the Reserve Bank prescribes the minimum  entry \npoint capital (entry point norms) from time to time, for setting- up of a new Primary  (Urban)  \nCooperative Bank.  \n \n3. Capital  Adequacy  Norms  \n \nReserve Bank of India has broadly mandated the Basel -I Framework for  Primary (Urban) \nCo-operative Banks in India. Accordingly, they shall maintain a minimum Capital to Risk \nWeighted Assets Rati o (CRAR) of 9% on an ongoing basis.  \n \n \n          CRAR        =  \n \n \nThe capital funds for capital adequacy purposes shall consist of Tier I and Tier II capital \nas defined below. The total of Tier II capital shall be limited to a maximum of 100 per cent of total Tier I capital for the purpose of compliance with CRAR norms.  \n \nRisk weights for different categories of exposures of banks are outlined in Annex -I. \n3.1 Tier I Capital   \n \nTier I shall comprise the following : \n \n(i) Paid-up share capital1 collected from regular members  having voting  rights.  \n \n(ii) Contributions received from associate / nominal members where the bye-  \nlaws permit allotment of shares to them and provided there are restrictions  \n                                                 \n1 UCBs are permitted to raise share capital, as hitherto,  by way of (i) issue of shares to persons within their \narea of operation, in accordance with the provisions of their bye- laws, and (ii) issue of additional shares to the \nexisting members.  Eligible Total Capital  \nTotal Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs)  4  \n on withdrawal of such shares, as  applicable to regular  members.  \n \n(iii) Contribution / non- refundable admission fees collected from the nominal  \nand associate members which is held separately as 'reserves' under an  \nappropriate head since these are not refundable.  \n \n(iv) Perpetual Non- Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) , which comply with \nthe regulatory requirements as specified in Annex -II.  \n \n(v) Free Reserves as per the audited accounts. Reserves, if any, created out  \nof revaluation of fixed assets or those created to meet outside liabilities  \nshould not be included in the Tier I Capital. Free reserves shall exclude all  \nreserves / provisions which are created to meet anticipated loan losses,  \nlosses on account of fraud etc., depreciation in investments and other  \nassets and other outside liabilities. For example, while the amounts held  \nunder the head \"Building Fund\" will be eligible to be treated as part of free \nreserves,  \"Bad and Doubtful Reserves\"  shall be excluded.  \n \n(vi) Capital Reserve s representing surplus  arising out of sale proceeds  of \nassets.  \n \n(vii) Perpetual Debt Instruments  (PDIs)  which comply with the regulatory \nrequirements as specified in Annex -III. \n \n(viii) Any surplus (net) in Profit and Loss Account i.e.,  balance after appropriation  \ntowards dividend payable, education fund, other funds whose utilisation is  \ndefined,  asset loss, if  any, etc.  \n \n(ix) Outstanding amount in Special Reserve created under  Section 36(1) (viii) \nof the Income Tax Act, 1961.  \n \nNote  : \n(i) Amount of intangible assets, losses in current year and those brought forward  \nfrom previous periods, deficit in NPA provisions, income wrongly recognized on \nnon-performing assets, provision required for liability devolved on bank, etc. will  \nbe deducted  from Tier I Capital. \n(ii) For a Fund to be included in the Tier I Capital, the Fund should satisfy two  \ncriteria viz., the Fund should be created as an appropriation of net profit and should \nbe a free reserve and not a specific reserve. However, if the same has  been \ncreated not by appropriation of profit but by a charge on the profit then this  Fund \nis in effect a provision and hence will be eligible for being reckoned only as  Tier II \ncapital as defined below and subject to a limit of 1.25% of risk weight assets \nprovided it is not attributed to any identified potential loss or diminution in value of \nan asset or a known liability.  \n(iii)  Outstanding Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI) which were issued \nin terms of Annex to circular UCB.PCB.Cir.No.39/09.16.900/08-09 dated January \n23,                              2009 shall also be eligible to be reckoned as Tier -I capital subject to the 5  \n ceilings  prescribed in Annexes to this Master Circular. It may be noted that the \nAnnex to circular dated January 23, 2009 has since been repealed vide circular \nNo. DOR.CAP.REC.92/09.18.201/2021-22 dated March 08, 2022, and with effect \nfrom March 08, 2022,  amount issued through PDI by conversion of existing \ndeposits as part of revival plan/ financial reconstruction of the UCBs (in terms of \ncircular dated January 23, 2009) shall comply with the Annex -III of this Master \nCircular.  \n \n3.2 Tier II Capital  \n \nTier II capital  shall comprise the following:  \n \n3.2.1  Revaluation Reserves \n \nThese reserves often serve as a cushion against unexpected losses, but they  \nare less permanent in nature and cannot be considered as 'Core Capital'.  \nRevaluation reserves arise from revaluation of assets that are undervalued in  \nthe bank's books. The typical example in this regard is bank premises and \nmarketable securities. The extent to which the revaluation reserves can be  \nrelied upon as a cushion for unexpected losses depends mainly upon the level                         of certainty that can be placed on estimates of the market value of the \nrelevant   assets, the subsequent deterioration in values under difficult market \nconditions   or in a forced sale,  potential  for actual  liquidation  of those values,  \ntax consequences  of revaluation,  etc. Therefore,  it would be prudent  to \nconsider  revaluation reserves at a discount of 55% when determining their \nvalue for inclusion in Tier II Capital i.e. only 45% of revaluation reserve should \nbe taken for inclusion in Tier II Capital. Such reserves will have to be reflected \non the face of the balance sheet as revaluation reserves.  \n \n3.2.2  General  Provisions and Loss Reserves  \n \nThese would include such provisions of general nature appearing in the books  \nof the bank  which  are not attributed to any identified  potential  loss or a \ndiminution in value of an asset or a known liability. Adequate care must be taken to ensure that sufficient provisions have been made to meet all known  \nlosses and foreseeable potential losses before considering any amount of  \ngeneral provision as part of Tier II capital as indicated above. To illustrate:  \nGeneral provision for Standard Assets, excess pr ovision on sale of NPAs etc.  \ncould be considered for inclusion under this category. Such provisions which are considered for inclusion in Tier II capital will be admitted up to 1.25% of  \ntotal weighted risk assets.  \n \nAs per the extant instructions, provisions made for NPAs as per prudential  \nnorms are deducted from the amount of Gross NPAs to arrive at the amount \nof                       Net NPAs. The prudential treatment of different type of provisions and its  \ntreatment  for capital adequacy purposes is given below:  \n \n 6  \n (a) Additional  General  Provisions  (Floating Provisions)  \n \nAdditional general provisions (floating provisions) for bad debts i.e., \nprovisions  not earmarked for any specific  loan impairments  (NPAs)  may \nbe used either for netting off of gross  NPAs  or for inclusion  in Tier II \ncapital  but cannot  be  used on both counts . \n \n(b) Additional  Provisions  for NPAs at higher  than prescribed rates  \n \nIn cases where banks make specific provision for NPAs in excess of what \nis prescribed under the prudential norms, the total specific provision may \nbe deducted from the amount of Gross NPAs while reporting the amount \nof Net  NPAs. The additional specific provision made by the bank will not \nbe reckoned  as Tier II capital.  \n \n(c) Excess  Provisions  on transfer of stressed loans to Asset Reconstruction \nCompanies  (ARC)  \n \nIn terms of instructions issued vide Reserve Bank of India (Transfer of Loan \nExposures) Directions, 2021 dated September 24, 2021, when the \nstressed loan is transferred to ARC at a price higher than the Net Book \nValue (NBV) at the time of transfer, UCBs shall reverse the excess provision on transfer to the profit and loss account in the year the amounts are received and only when the sum of cash received by way of initial consideration and / or redemption or transfer of Security Receipts (SR) / \nPass Through Certificates (PTCs)/ other securities issued by ARCs  is \nhigher than the NBV of the loan at the time of transfer. Further, such \nreversal shall be limited to the extent to which cash received exceeds the \nNBV of the loan at the time of transfer.   \nUntil reversal , such excess provisions shall continue to be shown under \n'provisions' and would be considered as Tier II capital subject to t he overall \nceiling of 1.25% of risk weighed assets.  \n \n(d) Provisions  for Diminution  in Fair Value  \n \nProvisions for  diminution in the fair value of restructured  accounts , both in \nrespect  of standard assets and NPAs, are permitted to be netted from the \nrelative loan asset  and will not be reckoned as Tier II capital.  \n3.2.3    Investment  Fluctuation Reserve \nBalances in the Investment Fluctuation Reserve created out of appropriation \nof net profit from the realised gains from the sale of investments held in AFS \n& HFT can be reckoned as Tier II capital.  \n3.2.4    Tier -II capital instruments \n  UCBs may issue  the following instruments to augment their Tier -II capital:  \na) Upper Tier -II instruments -  Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares   7  \n (PCPS), Redeemable Non- Cumulative Preference Shares (RNCPS) and \nRedeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (RCPS) which comply with the  \nregulatory requirements as specified in Annex -II. \nb) Lower Tier -II instruments -  Long Term Subordinated Bonds (LTSB) which \ncomply with the regulatory requirements as specified in Annex -III. \nNote: Outstanding Long Term (Subordinated) Deposits (LTD) which were issued \nin terms of Annex -II to the circular UBD.PCB.Cir.No.4/09.18.201/08-09 dated July \n15, 2008, and subsequent amendments thereto, shall also be eligible to be \nreckoned as Tier -II capital subject to the ceilings prescribed in Annex -III to this \nMaster Circular. It may be noted that the circular dated July 15, 2008 has since \nbeen repealed vide circular No.DOR.CAP.REC.92/09.18.201/2021-22 dated \nMarch 08, 2022.  \n \n4. Capital  for Market  Risk  \n \n4.1 Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on- balance sheet and off - balance \nsheet  positions arising from movements in market prices. The market risk  positions,  \nwhich  are subject to capital  charge are as  under:  \n \n\u2022 The risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments and equities in the  \ntrading book; and \n\u2022 Foreign exchange risk (includi ng open position in precious metals) throughout  \nthe bank (both banking and trading books).  \n4.2 As an initial step towards prescribing capital requirement for market risks,  \nUCBs  were  advised  to assign an additional  risk weight  of 2.5 per cent on \ninvestments.  These additional  risk weights  are clubbed with the risk weights  \nprescribed for credit risk in respect of investment portfolio of UCBs  as per Annex -I, \nand banks are not required to provide for the same separately. Further, UCBs are \nadvised to  assign a risk weight of 100% on the open position limits on foreign \nexchange and gold,  and to build up investment fluctuation reserve as per extant \ninstructions.   \n4.3 UCBs having AD Category I licence are required to provide capital for market  \nrisk in terms of circular UBD.BPD(PCB)Cir.No.42/09.11.600/2009- 10 dated  \nFebruary  8, 2010.  \n \n5.  Share linking to Borrowings \n \nBorrowings from UCBs shall be linked to shareholdings of the borrowing members \nas below : \n \n(i) 5 per cent  of the borrowings, if  the borrowings  are on unsecured basis.  \n \n(ii) 2.5 per cent  of the borrowings, in case of secured borrowings.  \n \n(iii) In case of secured borrowings  by Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs), 2.5 per \ncent of the borrowings, of which 1  per cent is to       be collected initially and the \nbalance of 1.5 per cent is to be collected in the course of next 2 years.  8  \n  \nThe above share linking norm s may be applicable for member's shareholdings up to \nthe limit of 5  per cent  of the total paid up share capital of the bank. Where a member \nis already  holding 5 per cent of  the total paid up share capital of a UCB, it would not \nbe necessary for  him / her to  subscribe to any additional share capital on account of \nthe application of  extant  share linking  norms.  In other  words,  a borrowing member  \nmay be required to        hold shares for an amount that may be computed as per the \nextant share linking norms  or for  an amount that is 5 per cent  of the total paid up share \ncapital of the bank, whichever is  lower.   \n \nShare- linking to borrowing norms shall be discretionary for UCBs which meet the \nminimum regulatory CRAR criteria of 9 per cent and a Tier 1 CRAR of 5.5 per cent as per the latest audited financial statements and the last CRAR as assessed by RBI during statutory inspection. Such UCBs shall have a Board- approved policy on \nshare-linking to borrowing norms which shall be implemented in a transparent, \nconsistent and non- discriminatory manner. The policy may be reviewed by the Board \nat the beginning of the accounting year. UCBs , which do not maintain the minimum \nCRAR of 9 percent and Tier 1 CRAR of 5.5 per cent, shall continue to be guided by the norms on share- linking to borrowing as specified above.  \n Perpetual Non- Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) held by members / \nsubscribers, may be treated as shares for the purpose of compliance with the extant share linking to borrowing norms.  \n \n6. Refund of share capital  \n \nIn terms of Section 12 (2) (ii) read with Section 56 of the BR Act, a co- operative bank \nshall not withdraw or reduce its share capital, except to the extent and subject to such conditions as the Reserve Bank may specify in this behalf. Accordingly, it has bee n \ndecided to permit UCBs to refund the share capital to their members, or nominees / heirs of deceased members, on demand\n2, subject to the following conditions:  \n \na) The bank\u2019s CRAR is 9 per cent or above, both as per the latest audited financial \nstatements  and the last CRAR as assessed by RBI during statutory inspection.  \n \nb) Such refund does not result in the CRAR of the bank falling below regulatory \nminimum of 9 per cent.  \n \nFor the purpose of computing CRAR as above, accretion to capital funds after the \nbalance sheet date3, other than by way of profits, may be taken into account. Any \nreduction in capital funds, including by way of losses, during the aforesaid period shall also be considered.  \n  \n                                                 \n2 Subject to the member fulfilling all the eligibility conditions for refund . \n3 Capital funds shall be as per audited data  9  \n 7.    Measures for protection of i nvestor s in regulatory capit al instruments specified \nin Annex- II and Annex- III \nFor the purpose of enhancing investor education on the risk characteristics of \nregulatory capital instruments , UCBs, which issue regulatory capital instruments  \nspecified in Annex -II and Annex -III shall adhere to the following conditions : \na) For floating rate instruments, banks should not use its Fixed Deposit rate as benchmark.  \nb) A specific sign -off, as quoted below, f rom the investors, for having understood the \nfeatures and risks of the instruments, may be incorporated in the common application \nform of the proposed issue:  \n\"By making this application, I / we acknowledge that I / we have understood the \nterms and conditio ns of the issue of [Name of the share/security] being issued by \n[Name of the bank] as disclosed in the Prospectus and Offer Document\".  \nc) UCBs shall ensure that all the publicity material / offer document, application form and other communication with the investor should clearly state in bold letters (Arial \nfont, size 14, equivalent size in English / Vernacular version) how a PNCPS / PCPS / RNCPS / RCPS / PDI / LTSB, as the case may be, is different from a fixed deposit, and that these instruments are not c overed by deposit insurance.  \nd) The procedure for transfer to legal heirs in the event of death of the subscriber of \nthe instrument should also be specified.  \n8.   Returns \nBanks should furnish to the respective Regional Offices annual return indicating (i)    \ncapital  funds,  (ii) conversion of off-balance sheet  / non-funded exposures,  (iii) \ncalculation of risk weighted assets, and (iv) calculation of capital funds and risk assets  \nratio. The format of the return is given in the Annex -IV. The returns should be signed \nby two officials who are authorized to sign the statutory returns submitted to Reserve \nBank.  \n \n 10  \n Annex- I \n \nPrudential  Norms - Risk  Weights for Computation of CRAR  \nI.

Off-Balance Sheet  Items  \nThe credit risk exposure attached to off -Balance Sheet items has to be first  \ncalculated by multiplying the face amount of each of the off -Balance Sheet  \nitems by 'credit conversion factors' as indicated in the table below. This will  \nthen have to be again multiplied by the weights attributable to the relevant  \ncounter -party  as specified above.  13  \n Sl. \nNo. Instruments  Credit  \nConversion \nFactor  (%) \n1 Financial Guarantees/ Direct credit substitutes e.g.  \ngeneral guarantees of indebtedness (including stand  \nL/Cs serving as financial guarantees for loans and  \nsecurities)  and acceptances  (including  \nendorsements  with character of  acceptance)  100 \n2 Performance Guarantees/ Related contingent items  \n(e.g. warranties  and standby  L/Cs related to \nparticular  transactions)  50 \n3 Short -term self-liquidating  trade -related  \ncontingencies  (such  as documentary  credits  \ncollateralised  by the underlying shipments)  20 \n4 Sale and repurchase  agreement  and asset  sales   \nwith recourse, where the credit risk remains with the  \nbank.  100 \n5 Forward asset purchase, forward deposit and partly  \npaid shams  and securities,  which  represent  \ncommitments  with certain draw down  100 \n6 Note  issuance  facilities  and revolving  underwriting  \nfacilities  50 \n7 Other commitments (e.g., formal standby facilities  \nand credit lines) with an original maturity of over one  \nyear.  50 \n8 Similar commitments with an original maturity upto  \none year, or which can be unconditionally cancelled  \nat any time.  0 \n9 (i) Guarantees  issued  by banks  against  the \ncounter guarantees of other banks  20 \n(ii) Rediscounting of documentary bills accepted by  \nbanks. Bills discounted by banks which have  \nbeen accepted by another bank will be treated  \nas a funded claim on a bank.  20 \nNote  : In these  cases,  banks  should  be fully satisfied  that the risk                             exposure \nis, in fact, on the other bank. Bills purchased / discounted / negotiated \nunder LC (where the payment to the beneficiary is not made 'under \nreserve') will be treated as an exposure on the LC issuing bank  and not on \nthe borrower. All clean negotiations as indicated above, will be assigned \nthe risk weight which  is normally  applicable to inter-bank  exposures, for \ncapital  adequacy  purposes. In the case  of negotiations  'under reserve' \nthe ex posure should be treated as on the borrower and risk weight  \nassigned accordingly.  \n10 Aggregate  outstanding  foreign  exchange  contracts  of original  \nmaturity  - \nLess  than 14 calendar  days  0 14  \n  more  than 14 days but less  than one year 2 \nfor each  additional year or  part thereof  3 \nNotes  : \nWhile calculating the aggregate of funded and non -funded exposure of a  \nborrower for the purpose of assignment of risk weight, bank may 'net-off'  \nagainst the total outstanding exposure of the borrower credit balances in  \ncurrent or other  accounts  which  are not earmarked for specific  purposes  \nand free from any lien. \nAfter applying the conversion factor as indicated above, the adjusted off - \nBalance Sheet value shall again be  multiplied by the weight attr ibutable to \nthe relevant counter -party as specified.  \n \nNote : At present, Primary Urban Cooperative Banks may not be undertaking most of the \noff balance sheet transactions. However, keeping in view their potential for expansion, risk-\nweights are indicated against various off balance sheet items, which, perhaps Primary  Urban \nCooperative Banks  may undertake in future. \n \nII. Additional  Risk Weights (applicable to Authorised Dealers only)  \n \n1. Foreign Exchange and Interest Rate related Contracts \n \n1.1 Foreign exchange contracts  include the following:  \n(a) Cross  currency swaps  \n(b) Forward foreign exchange  contracts  \n(c) Currency  futures  \n(d) Currency  options  purchased  \n(e) Other  contracts of  a similar nature \n \n1.2 Interest rate contracts include the following:  \n(a) Single currency interest rate swaps  \n(b) Basis swaps  \n(c) Forward rate agreements  \n(d) Interest rate futures  (e) Interest rate options purchased  (f) Other contracts of a similar nature  \n \n1.3 As in the case of other  off-Balance Sheet  items, a two-stage calculation \nprescribed below shall be applied:  \n \n(a) Step 1 -  The notional principal amount of each instrument is  \nmultiplied  by th e conversion factor given below : \n \n  \n \n 15  \n  \n \nWhen effective bilateral netting contracts as specified in paragraph II.3 of this \nAnnex are in place, the conversion factors, as mentioned in the below table, shall be applicable\n4: \n \nOriginal maturity  Conversion factor  \nInterest \nrate \ncontracts  Foreign \nExchange \nContracts  \nLess than one year  0.35%  1.5%  \nOne year and less \nthan two years  0.75%  3.75% (i.e. \n1.5% + \n2.25%)  \nFor each additional \nyear 0.75%  2.25%  \n \n(b) Step 2 - The adjusted value thus obtained shall be multiplied  by the                  risk weight \nallotted to the relevant counter -party  as given in I -A above.  \n \nNote: At present, most of the Primary  (Urban) Cooperative Banks are not carrying out \nforex transactions. However, those who have been given A.D's licence may undertake \ntransactions mentioned above. In the event of any uncertainly in assigning risk weight \nagainst a specific transaction, RBI clarification may be sought for. \n \n2. Repo in Corporate Bonds  \n \nUCBs which are lenders of funds in the repo transaction are required to provide  \ncounter -party credit risk corresponding to the risk weight for such exposure as  \napplicable to the loan / investment exposure.  \n \n \n                                                 \n4 For purposes of calculating the credit exposure to a netting counterparty for forward foreign exchange contracts and other \nsimilar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows,  the original credit conversion factors (i.e., without \nconsidering the impact of bilateral netting) should be applied to the notional principal, which is defined as the net receipt s \nfalling due on each value date in each currency. In no case should the reduced factors above be applied to net notional \namounts.  \n Original maturity  Conversion factor  \nInterest rate \ncontracts  Foreign Exchange \nContracts  \nLess than one year  0.5%  2% \nOne year and less \nthan two years  1.0%  5% (i.e. 2% + 3%)  \nFor each additional \nyear 1.0%  3% 16  \n 3. Requirement for recognition of Bilateral Netting Contract:  \n(a) UCBs may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligation \nbetween a UCB and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value date, legally substituting one single amount for the previous gross obligations.  \n(b)  UCBs may also net transactions subject to any legally valid form of bilateral netting \nnot covered in (a), including other forms of novation.  (c)  In both cases (a) and (b), a UCB will need to satisfy that it has:  \n(i) A netting contract or agreement with the counterparty which creates a single \nlegal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that the UCB would have \neither a claim to receive or obligation to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark -to-market values of included individual transactions in the event a \ncounterparty fails to perform due to any of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar circumstances.   \n(ii) Written and reasoned legal opinions that, in the event of a legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find the UCB's exposure to be such a net amount under:  \n\u2022 The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if the foreign branch of a counterparty is involved,  then also under the law of the \njurisdiction in which the branch is located.   \n\u2022 The law that governs the individual transactions; and  \n\u2022 The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the netting.  \n(iii) Procedures in place to ensure that t he legal characteristics of netting \narrangements are kept under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law.  \n(d) Contracts containing walkaway clauses will not be eligible for netting for the purpose of calculating capital requirements under t hese guidelines. A walkaway \nclause is a provision which permits a non- defaulting counterparty to make only limited \npayments or no payment at all, to the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter is a net creditor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  17  \n Annex- II \nGuidelines on Issuance of Preference Shares \nA. Perpetual Non- Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) eligible for inclusion in Tier -\nI capital  \nUCBs are permitted to issue Perpetual Non- Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) at face \nvalue to their members or any other person r esiding within their area of operation, with the \nprior approval of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) . The UCBs shall submit the application seeking \npermission, together with the Prospectus / Offer Document / Information Memorandum, to \nthe concerned Regional Office  (RO) of the RBI. A  certificate from a Chartered Accountant to \nthe effect that the terms of the offer document are in compliance with these instructions shall \nalso be submitted along with the application.  The amounts raised through PNCPS shall \ncomply  with the following terms and conditions to qualify for inclusion as Tier -I capital.  \n2. Terms of Issue \n2.1 Limits \nThe outstanding amount of PNCPS and Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) along with \noutstanding Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI) shal l not exceed 35 per cent of \ntotal Tier -I capital at any point of time. The above limit will be based on the amount of Tier -I \ncapital after deduction of goodwill and other intangible assets , but before deduction of equity \ninvestment in subsidiaries, if any . PNCPS issued in excess of the overall ceiling of 35 per \ncent, shall be eligible for inclusion under Upper Tier -II capital, subject to limits prescribed for \nTier-II capital. However, investors' rights and obligations would remain unchanged.  \n2.2 Amount  \nThe amount of PNCPS to be raised shall be decided by the Board of Directors of banks.  \n2.3 Maturity \nThe PNCPS shall be perpetual.  \n2.4 Options \na. PNCPS shall not be issued with a 'put option' or 'step up option'.  \nb.  PNCPS may be issued with a call option, subject to following conditions:  \ni.

Introduction  \n1.1 Basel III reforms are the response of Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to \nimprove the banking sector\u2019s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, \nwhatever the sourc e, thus reducing the risk of spill over from the financial sector to the real \neconomy. During Pittsburgh summit in September 2009, the G20 leaders committed to strengthen \nthe regulatory system for banks and other financial firms and also act together to ra ise capital \nstandards, to implement strong international compensation standards aimed at ending practices \nthat lead to excessive risk -taking, to improve the over -the-counter derivatives market and to \ncreate more powerful tools to hold large global firms to  account for the risks they take. For all \nthese reforms, the leaders set for themselves strict and precise timetables. Consequently, the \nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) released comprehensive reform package \nentitled \u201cBasel III: A global regul atory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems\u201d \n(known as Basel III capital regulations) in December 2010.  \n1.2 Basel III reforms strengthen the bank -level i.e. , micro prudential regulation, with the intention \nto raise the resilience of indivi dual banking institutions in periods of stress. Besides, the reforms \nhave a macro prudential focus also, addressing system wide risks, which can build up across the \nbanking sector, as well as the procyclical amplification of these risks over time. These ne w global \nregulatory and supervisory standards mainly seek to raise the quality and level of capital to ensure \nbanks are better able to absorb losses on both a going concern and a gone concern basis, \nincrease the risk coverage of the capital framework, intr oduce leverage ratio to serve as a \nbackstop to the risk -based capital measure, raise the standards for the supervisory review \nprocess (Pillar 2) and public disclosures (Pillar 3) etc. The macro prudential aspects of Basel III \nare largely enshrined in the c apital buffers. Both the buffers i.e. , the capital conservation buffer \nand the countercyclical buffer are intended to protect the banking sector from periods of excess \ncredit growth.  \n2. Approach to Implementation and Effective Date  \n2.1 The Basel III capita l regulations continue to be based on three -mutually reinforcing Pillars, \nviz. minimum capital requirements, supervisory review of capital adequacy, and market discipline \nof the Base l II capital adequacy framework1. Under Pillar 1, the Basel III framework will continue \nto offer the three distinct options for computing capital requirement for credit risk and three other \noptions for computing capital requirement for operational risk, albeit with certain modifications / \nenhancements. These options for credit a nd operational risks are based on increasing risk \n                                                            \n1 For reference, please refer to the Master Circular on Prudential Guidelines on Capital Adequacy and Market  \nDiscipline - New Capital Adequacy Framework (NCAF) issued vide circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.4/21.06.001/2015 -16 \ndated July 1, 2015 . 8 \n sensitivity and allow banks to select an approach that is most appropriate to the stage of \ndevelopment of bank's operations. The options available for computing capital for credit risk are \nStandardised Appr oach, Foundation Internal Rating Based Approach and Advanced Internal \nRating Based Approach. The options available for computing capital for operational risk are Basic \nIndicator Approach (BIA), The Standardised Approach (TSA) and Advanced Measurement \nAppro ach (AMA).  \n2.2 Keeping in view the Reserve Bank\u2019s goal to have consistency and harmony with international \nstandards, it was decided in 2007 that all commercial banks in India (excluding Local Area Banks \nand Regional Rural Banks) should adopt Standardised A pproach for credit risk, Basic Indicator \nApproach for operational risk by March 2009 and banks should continue to apply the Standardised \nDuration Approach (SDA) for computing capital requirement for market risks.  \n2.3  Banks were advised to undertake an int ernal assessment of their preparedness for migration \nto advanced approaches and take a decision with the approval of their Boards, whether they \nwould like to migrate to any of the advanced approaches. Based on bank's internal assessment \nand its preparation , a bank may choose a suitable date to apply for implementation of advanced \napproach. Besides, banks, at their discretion, would have the option of adopting the advanced \napproaches for one or more of the risk categories, as per their preparedness, while co ntinuing \nwith the simpler approaches for other risk categories, and it would not be necessary to adopt the \nadvanced approaches for all the risk categories simultaneously. However, banks should invariably \nobtain prior approval of the RBI for adopting any of  the advanced approaches.  \n2.4 Effective Date : The Basel III capital regulations were  implemented in India with effect from \nApril 1, 2013  and have been fully implemented as on October 1, 2021 . Banks have to comply with \nthe regulatory limits and minima as pr escribed under Basel III capital regulations, on an ongoing \nbasis.  \n3. Scope of Application of Capital Adequacy Framework  \n3.1 A bank shall comply with the capital adequacy ratio requirements at two levels:  \n(a) the consolidated (\u201cGroup\u201d) level2 capital adeq uacy ratio requirements, which measure the \ncapital adequacy of a bank based on its capital strength and risk profile after consolidating the \nassets and liabilities of its subsidiaries / joint ventures / associates etc. except those engaged \nin insurance and  any non -financial activities; and  \n                                                            \n2 In terms of guidelines on preparation of co nsolidated prudential reports issued vide circular DBOD. \nNo.BP.BC.72/21.04.018/ 2001 -02 dated February 25, 2003 , a consolidated bank may exclude group companies which \nare enga ged in insurance business and businesses not pertaining to financial services. A consolidated bank should \nmaintain a minimum Capital to Risk -weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) as applicable to a bank on an ongoing basis. Please \nalso refer to circular DBOD.No.FSD.BC.46/24.01.028/2006 -07 dated December 12, 2006 . 9 \n (b) the standalone (\u201cSolo\u201d) level capital adequacy ratio requirements, which measure the \ncapital adequacy of a bank based on its standalone capital strength and risk profile.  \nAccordingly, overseas operations of a bank thr ough its branches will be covered in both the above \nscenarios.  \n3.2 For the purpose of these directions, the subsidiary is an enterprise that is controlled by \nanother enterprise (known as the parent). Banks will follow the definition of \u2018control\u2019 as given i n \nthe applicable accounting standards.  \n3.3 The components, elements and eligibility criteria of the regulatory capital instruments for \nforeign banks operating in India under the Wholly Owned Subsidiary (WOS) model would be as \napplicable to the other domest ic banks as stipulated in this Master Circular. The WOS shall meet \nthe Basel III requirements on a continuous basis from the time of its entry / conversion . WOS \nshall, however, maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio, on a continuous basis for an initial  \nperiod of three years from the commencement of its operations, at 10 per cent.  In addition, the \nWOS shall maintain the Capital Conservation Buffer and other buffers as applicable3. \n3.4 Capital Adequacy at Group / Consolidated Level  \n3.4.1 All banking and o ther financial subsidiaries except subsidiaries engaged in insurance and \nany non -financial activities (both re gulated and unregulated) should be fully consolidated for the \npurpose of capital adequacy. This would ensure assessment of capital adequacy at the  group \nlevel, taking into account the risk profile of assets and liabilities of the consolidated subsidiaries.  \n3.4.2 The insurance and non -financial subsidiaries / joint ventures / a ssociates etc. of a bank \nshould  not be consolidated for the purpose of cap ital adequacy. The equity and other regulatory \ncapital investments in the insurance and non -financial subsidiaries will be deducted from \nconsolidated regulatory capital of the group. Equity and other regulatory capital investments in \nthe unconsolidated ins urance and non -financial entities of banks (which also include joint ventures \n/ associates of the parent bank) will be treated in terms of paragraphs 4.4.9 and 5.13.6 \nrespectively.  \n3.4.3 All regulatory adjustments indicated in paragraph 4.4 are required to  be made to the \nconsolidated capital of the banking group as indicated therein.  \n3.4.4 Minority interest (i.e. , non-controlling interest) and other capital issued out of consolidated \nsubsidiaries as per paragraph 3. 4.1 that is held by third parties will be recognized in the \nconsolidated regulatory capital of the group subject to certain conditions as stipulated in \nparagraph 4.3.  \n                                                            \n3 Please refer to the Framework for  setting up of Wholly Owned Subsidiaries by Foreign Banks in India dated \nNovember 6, 2013 . 10 \n 3.4.5 Banks should ensure that majority owned financial entities that are not consolidated for \ncapital purposes and for which the i nvestment in equity and other instruments eligible for \nregulatory capital status is deducted, meet their respective regulatory capital requirements. In \ncase of any shortfall in the regulatory capital requirements in the unconsolidated entity, the \nshortfall  shall be fully deducted from the Common Equity Tier 1 capital.  \n3.4.6 It is clarified that group/ consolidated level capital adequacy would also mean application \nof consolidated capital adequacy norm s to the  Non-Operative Financial Holding Company \n(NOFHC)  after consolidating the relevant entities held by it in terms of paragraph 3 .1(a) above , in \nconjunction with the Guidelines for consolidated accounting and other quantitative methods to \nfacilitate consolidated supervision issued vide circular dated DBOD.No.BP.BC.72 \n/21.04.018/2001 -02 dated February 25, 20034. \n3.4.7  Banks may refer to Annex 21  for guidelines on general permission for infusion o f capital \nin overseas branches and banking subsidiaries and retention/ repatriation/ transfer of profits in \nthese centres.  \n3.5 Capital Adequacy at Solo Level  \n3.5.1 While assessing the capital adequacy of a bank at solo level, all regulatory adjustments \nindicated in paragraph 4.4 are required to be made. In addition, investments in the capital \ninstruments of the subsidiaries, which are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements \nof the group, shall be  deducted from the corresponding capital instru ments issued by the bank.  \n3.5.2 In case of any shortfall in the regulatory capital requirements in the unconsolidated entity \n(e.g., insurance subsidiary), the shortfall shall be fully deducted from the Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital.  \n4. Composition of Regula tory Capital  \n4.1 General  \nBanks shall maintain a minimum Pillar 1 Capital to Risk -weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9% on \nan on -going basis (other than capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer etc.). \nThe Reserve Bank will take into accou nt the relevant risk factors and the internal capital adequacy \nassessments of each bank to ensure that the capital held by a bank is commensurate with the \nbank\u2019s overall risk profile. This would include, among others, the effectiveness of the bank\u2019s risk \nmanagement systems in identifying, assessing / measuring, monitoring and managing various \nrisks including interest rate risk in the banking book, liquidity risk, concentration risk and residual \nrisk. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank will consider prescribing a  higher level of minimum capital \nratio for each bank under the Pillar 2 framework on the basis of their respective risk profiles and \n                                                            \n4 Please refer circular no.

Further, in terms of the Pillar 2 requirements, banks are expected \nto operate at a level wel l above the minimum requirement. A bank should compute Basel III capital \nratios in the following manner:  \n \nCommon Equity Tier 1 \ncapital ratio  = Common Equity Tier 1 capital  \nCredit Risk RWA* + Market Risk RWA + Operational Risk RWA  \nTier 1 capital ratio  = Eligible Tier 1 capital  \nCredit Risk RWA + Market Risk RWA + Operational Risk RWA  \nTotal Capital (CRAR#) = Eligible Total Capital  \nCredit Risk RWA + Market Risk RWA + Operational Risk RWA  \n*Risk Weight Assets  \n#Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio  \n4.2 Elements of Regulatory Capital and the Criteria for their Inclusion in the Definition \nof Regulatory Capital  \n4.2.1  Components of Capital  \nTotal regulatory capital will consist of the sum of the following categories:  \n(i) Tier 1 Capital (going -concern capital )5 \n(a) Common Equity Tier 1  \n(b) Additional Tier 1  \n(ii) Tier 2 Capital (gone -concern capital)  \n4.2.2  Limits and Minima  \n(i) As a matter of prudence, it has been decided that scheduled commercial banks operating \nin India shall maintain a minimum total capital (MTC) of 9% of total risk weighted assets (RWAs) \ni.e., capital to risk weighted assets (CRAR). This will be further divided into different components \nas described under paragraphs 4.2.2(ii) to 4.2.2(viii).  \n(ii) Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital must be a t least 5.5% of risk -weighted assets \n(RWAs) i.e. , for credit risk + market risk + operational risk on an ongoing basis.  \n(iii) Tier 1 capital must be at least 7% of RWAs on an ongoing basis. Thus, within the minimum \nTier 1 capital, Additional Tier 1 capital  can be admitted maximum at 1.5% of RWAs.  \n                                                            \n5 From regulatory capital perspective, going -concern capital is the capital which can absorb losses without triggering \nbankruptcy of the bank. Gone -concern capital is the capital which will absorb losses only in a situation of liquidation \nof the bank.  12 \n (iv) Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 Capital) must be at least 9% of RWAs on an \nongoing basis. Thus, within the minimum CRAR of 9%, Tier 2 capital can be admitted maximum \nup to 2%.  \n(v) If a bank has compl ied with the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital ratios, \nthen the excess Additional Tier 1 capital can be admitted for compliance with the minimum CRAR \nof 9% of RWAs.  \n(vi) In addition to the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital of 5.5% of RWAs,  banks are \nalso required to maintain a capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 2.5% of RWAs6 in the form of \nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital. Details of operational aspects of CCB have been furnished in \nparagraph 15. The capital requirements are summarised as fol lows:  \n \nS.No.  Regulatory Capital  As % to RWAs  \n(i) Minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio  5.5 \n(ii) Capital Conservation Buffer (comprised of Common Equity)  2.5 \n(iii) Minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio plus Capital \nConservation Buffer [(i)+(ii)]  8.0 \n(iv) Additional Tier 1 Capital  1.5 \n(v) Minimum Tier 1 Capital Ratio [(i) +(iv)]  7.0 \n(vi) Tier 2 Capital  2.0 \n(vii) Minimum Total Capital Ratio (MTC) [(v)+(vi)]  9.0 \n(viii) Minimum Total Capital Ratio plus Capital Conservation \nBuffer [(vii)+(ii)]  11.5 \n \n4.2.3  Comm on Equity Tier 1 Capital  \n4.2.3.1  Common Equity \u2013 Indian Banks  \nA. Elements of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital  \nElements of Common Equity component of Tier 1 capital will comprise the following:  \n(i) Common shares (paid -up equity capital) issued by the bank which  meet the criteria for \nclassification as common shares for regulatory purposes as given in Annex 1 ; \n(ii) Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of common shares;  \n(iii) Statutory reserves;  \n                                                            \n6 The CCB of 2.5% of RWAs has been fully phased in from October 1, 2021.  13 \n (iv) Capital reserves r epresenting surplus arising out of sale proceeds of assets;  \n(v) Revaluation reserves arising out of change in the carrying amount of a bank\u2019s property \nconsequent upon its revaluation may, at the discretion of banks, be reckoned as CET1 capital at \na discoun t of 55%, instead of as Tier 2 capital as mentioned in paragraph 4.2.5.1.A (vi), subject \nto meeting the following conditions:  \n\uf0b7 bank is able to sell the property readily at its own will and there is no legal impediment in \nselling the property;  \n\uf0b7 the revaluatio n reserves are shown under Schedule 2: Reserves & Surplus in the Balance \nSheet of the bank;  \n\uf0b7 revaluations are realistic, in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards.  \n\uf0b7 valuations are obtained, from two independent valuers, at least once in every 3 years; \nwhere the value of the property has been substantially impaired by any event, these are \nto be immediately revalued and appropriately factored into capital adequacy \ncomputations;  \n\uf0b7 the external auditors of the bank have not expressed a qualified opinion on the  revaluation \nof the property;  \n\uf0b7 the instructions on valuation of properties and other specific requirements as mentioned \nin the circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.50/21.04.018/2006 -07 Ja nuary 4, 2007  on \u2018Valuation of \nProperties - Empanelment of Valuers\u2019 are strictly adhered to.  \n(vi) Banks may, at their discretion, reckon foreign currency translation reserve arising due to \ntranslation of financial statements of their foreign operations in  terms of Accounting Standard (AS) \n11 as CET1 capital at a discount of 25% subject to meeting the following conditions:  \n\uf0b7 the FCTR are shown under Schedule 2: Reserves & Surplus in the Balance Sheet of the \nbank;  \n\uf0b7 the external auditors of the bank have not exp ressed a qualified opinion on the FCTR.  \n(vii) Other disclosed free reserves, if any;  \n(viii) Balance in Profit & Loss Account at the end of the previous financial year;  \n(ix) Banks may reckon the profits in current financial year for CRAR calculation on a qu arterly \nbasis provided the incremental provisions made for non -performing assets at the end of any of \nthe four quarters of the previous financial year have not deviated more than 25% from the average \nof the four quarters. The amount which can be reckoned w ould be arrived at by using the following \nformula:  \n 14 \n EPt= {NP t \u2013 0.25*D*t}  \nwhere;  \nEPt = Eligible profit up to the quarter \u2018t\u2019 of the current financial year; t varies from 1 to 4  \nNPt = Net profit up to the quarter \u2018t\u2019  \nD= average annual dividend paid during l ast three years  \nIt is clarified that  the cumulative net loss up to the quarter end must be deducted while calculating \nCET1 capital for the relevant quarter.  \n(x) While calculating capital adequacy at the consolidated level, common shares issued by \nconsolid ated subsidiaries of the bank and held by  third parties (i.e. , minority interest) which meet \nthe criteria for inclusion in Common Equity Tier 1 capital (refer to paragraph 4.3.2); and  \n(xi) Less: Regulatory adjustments / deductions applied in the calculatio n of Common Equity \nTier 1 capital [i.e. , to be deducted from the sum of items (i) to ( x)]. \nB. Criteria for Classification as Common Shares for Regulatory Purposes  \nCommon Equity is recognised as the highest quality component of capital and is the primary fo rm \nof funding which ensures that a bank remains solvent. Therefore, under Basel III, common shares \nto be included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital must meet the criteria as furnished in Annex 1 . \n4.2.3.2  Common Equity Tier 1 Capi tal \u2013 Foreign Banks\u2019 Branches  \nA. Elements of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital  \nElements of Common Equity Tier 1 capital will remain the same and consist of the following:  \n(i) Interest -free funds from Head Office kept in a separate account in Indian books specif ically \nfor the purpose of meeting the capital adequacy norms *; \n(ii) Statutory reserves kept in Indian books;  \n(iii) Remittable surplus retained in Indian books which is not repatriable so long as the bank \nfunctions in India *; \n(iv) Interest -free funds remitt ed from abroad for the purpose of acquisition of property and held \nin a separate account in Indian books provided they are non -repatriable and have the ability to \nabsorb losses regardless of their source;  \n(v) Capital reserve representing surplus arising ou t of sale of assets in India held in a separate \naccount and which is not eligible for repatriation so long as the bank functions in India;  15 \n (vi) Revaluation reserves arising out of change in the carrying amount of a bank\u2019s property \nconsequent upon its reva luation may, at the discretion of banks, be reckoned as CET1 capital at \na discount of 55%, instead of as Tier 2 capital as mentioned in paragraph 4.2.5. 2.A (iii) , subject \nto meeting the same set of conditions mentioned for Indian banks in paragraph 4.2.3.1 .A (v) \nabove;  \n(vii) Banks may, at their discretion, reckon foreign currency translation reserve arising due to \ntranslation of financial statements of their foreign operations in terms of Accounting Standard (AS) \n11 as CET1 capital at a discount of 25% subj ect to meeting the same set of conditions mentioned \nfor Indian banks in paragraph 4.2.3.1.A (vi) above ; and \n(viii) Less: Regulatory adjustments / deductions applied in the calculation of Common Equity \nTier 1 capital [i.e. , to be deducted from the sum of it ems (i) to (v ii)]. \nNote : *Banks are advised to refer to circular DOR.CRE.REC.47/21.01.003/2021 -22 dated \nSeptember 09, 2021  on \u2018Large Exposures Framework \u2013 Credit Risk Mit igation (CRM) for offsetting \n\u2013 non-centrally cleared derivative transactions of foreign bank branches in India with their Head \nOffice \u2019 which inter alia, states that there shall not be any double counting of the funds placed \nunder section 11( 2) of the Banki ng Regulation Act, 1949 as both capital and CRM .  \nB.

Elements of Tier 2 Capital  \n(i) General Provisions and Loss Reserves  \na. Provisions or loan -loss reserves held against future, presently unidentified losses, which \nare freely available to meet losses which subsequently materialize, will qualify for inclusion \nwithin Tier 2 capital. Accordingly, General Provisions on Stand ard Assets, Floating 18 \n Provisions8, incremental provisions in respect of unhe dged foreign currency exposures9, \nProvisions held for Country Exposures, Investment Reserve Account, excess provisions \nwhich arise on account of sale of NPAs and \u2018count ercyclical provisioning buffer \u201910 will qualify \nfor inclusion in Tier 2 capital. Howev er, these items together will be admitted as Tier 2 capital \nup to a maximum of 1.25% of the total credit risk -weighted assets under the standardized \napproach. Under Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach, where the total expected loss \namount is less than to tal eligible provisions, banks may recognise the difference as Tier 2 \ncapital up to a maximum of 0.6% of credit -risk weighted assets calculated under the IRB \napproach.  \nb. Investment Fluctuation Reserve shall also qualify for inclusion in Tier 2 capital, wi thout any \nceiling11.  \nc.

Criteria for Classification as Tier 2 Capital for Regulatory Purposes  \nCriteria for inclusion of Head Office (HO) borrowings in foreign currency received as part of Tier \n2 debt Capital for foreign banks are furnished in Annex 5  and Annex 16 . \n                                                            \n12 Revaluation reserves arise from revaluation of assets that are undervalued on the bank\u2019s books, typically bank \npremises. The extent t o which the revaluation reserves can be relied upon as a cushion for unexpected losses \ndepends mainly upon the level of certainty that can be placed on estimates of the market values of the relevant \nassets, the subsequent deterioration in values under diff icult market conditions or in a forced sale, potential for \nactual liquidation at those values, tax consequences of revaluation, etc. Therefore, it would be prudent to consider \nrevaluation reserves at a discount of 55% while determining their value for incl usion in Tier 2 capital. Such reserves \nwill have to be reflected on the face of the Balance Sheet as revaluation reserves.  20 \n 4.3 Recognition of Minority Interest (i.e. , Non-Controlling Interest) and Other Capital \nIssued out of Consolidated Subsidiaries that is Held by Third Parties  \n4.3.1  Under Basel II I, the minority interest is recognised only in cases where there is \nconsiderable explicit or implicit assurance that the minority interest which is supporting the risks \nof the subsidiary would be available to absorb the losses at the consolidated level. Ac cordingly, \nthe portion of minority interest which supports risks in a subsidiary that is a bank will be included \nin group\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1. Consequently, minority interest in the subsidiaries which are \nnot banks will not be included in the regulatory  capital of the group. In other words, the proportion \nof surplus capital which is attributable to the minority shareholders would be excluded from the \ngroup\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Further, under Basel III, the minority interest in relation to \nother components of regulatory capital will also be recognised .  \n4.3.2  Treatment of Minority Interest Corresponding to Common Shares Issued by \nConsolidated Subsidiaries  \nMinority interest arising from the issue of common shares by a fully consolidated subsidiar y of the \nbank may receive recognition in Common Equity Tier 1 capital only if: (a) the instrument giving \nrise to the minority interest would, if issued by the bank, meet all of the criteria for classification \nas common shares for regulatory capital purpose s as stipulated in Annex 1 ; and (b) the subsidiary \nthat issued t he instrument is itself a bank13. The amount of minority interest meeting the criteria \nabove that will be recognised in consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 capital wi ll be calculated as \nfollows:  \n(i) Total minority interest meeting the two criteria above minus the amount of the \nsurplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary attributable to the minority \nshareholders.  \n(ii) Surplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital of t he subsidiary is calculated as the \nCommon Equity Tier 1 of the subsidiary minus the lower of: (a) the minimum Common \nEquity Tier 1 capital requirement of the subsidiary plus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. \n8.0% of risk weighted assets) and (b) the po rtion of the consolidated minimum Common \nEquity Tier 1 capital requirement plus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. 8.0% of \nconsolidated risk weighted assets) that relates to the subsidiary . \n(iii) The amount of the surplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital th at is attributable to the \nminority shareholders is calculated by multiplying the surplus Common Equity Tier 1 by the \npercentage of Common Equity Tier 1 that is held by minority shareholders.  \n                                                            \n13For the purposes of this paragraph, All India Financial Institutions, Non -banking Financial Companies regulated by \nRBI and Primary D ealers will be considered to be a bank  21 \n 4.3.3  Treatment of Minority Interest Corresponding to Tier 1 Qual ifying  Capital Issued by \nConsolidated Subsidiaries  \nTier 1 capital instruments issued by a fully consolidated subsidiary of the bank to third party \ninvestors (including amounts under paragraph 4.3.2) may receive recognition in Tier 1 capital only \nif the ins truments would, if issued by the bank, meet all of the criteria for classification as Tier 1 \ncapital. The amount of this capital that will be recognised in Tier 1 capital will be calculated as \nfollows:  \n(i) Total Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary issued to t hird parties minus the amount of the surplus \nTier 1 capital of the subsidiary attributable to the third party investors.  \n(ii) Surplus Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary is calculated as the Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary \nminus the lower of: (a) the minimum  Tier 1 capital requirement of the subsidiary plus the capital \nconservation buffer (i.e. , 9.5% of risk weighted assets) and (b) the portion of the consolidated \nminimum Tier 1 capital requirement plus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. 9.5% of consolidat ed \nrisk weighted assets) that relates to the subsidiary.  \n(iii) The amount of the surplus Tier 1 capital that is attributable to the third party investors is \ncalculated by multiplying the surplus Tier 1 capital by the percentage of Tier 1 capital that is he ld \nby third party investors.  \nThe amount of this Tier 1 capital that will be recognised in Additional Tier 1 capital will exclude \namounts recognised in Common Equity Tier 1 capital under paragraph 4.3.2.  \n4.3.4  Treatment of Minority Interest Corresponding to  Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital \nQualifying Capital Issued by Consolidated Subsidiaries  \nTotal capital instruments (i.e. , Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) issued by a fully consolidated \nsubsidiary of the bank to third party investors (including amou nts under paragraphs 4.3.2 and \n4.3.3) may receive recognition in Total Capital only if the instruments would, if issued by the bank, \nmeet all of the criteria for classification as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital. The amount of this capital that \nwill be recognised  in consolidated Total Capital will be calculated as follows:  \n(i) Total capital instruments of the subsidiary issued to third parties minus the amount of the \nsurplus Total Capital of the subsidiary attributable to the third party investors.  \n(ii) Surplus To tal Capital of the subsidiary is calculated as the Total Capital of the subsidiary \nminus the lower of: (a) the minimum Total Capital requirement of the subsidiary plus the capital \nconservation buffer (i.e. , 11.5% of risk weighted assets) and (b) the portio n of the consolidated \nminimum Total Capital requirement plus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. , 11.5% of \nconsolidated risk weighted assets) that relates to the subsidiary.  22 \n (iii) The amount of the surplus Total Capital that is attributable to the third party investors is \ncalculated by multiplying the surplus Total Capital by the percentage of Total Capital that is \nheld by third party investors.  \nThe amount of this Total Capital that will be recognised in Tier 2 capital will exclude amounts \nrecognised in C ommon Equity Tier 1 capital under paragraph 4.3.2 and amounts recognised in \nAdditional Tier 1 under paragraph 4.3.3.  \n4.3.5 An illustration of calculation of minority interest and other capital issued out of consolidated \nsubsidiaries that is held by third p arties is furnished in Annex 17 . \n4.4 Regulatory Adjustments / Deductions  \nThe following paragraphs deal with the regulatory adjustments / deductions which will be applied \nto regulatory capital both  at solo and consolidated leve l. \n4.4.1  Goodwill and all Other Intangible Assets  \n(i) Goodwill and all other intangible assets should be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital including any goodwill included in the valuation of significant investments in the capital of \nbanking, finan cial and insurance entities which are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation. \nIn terms of AS 23 \u2013 Accounting for investments in associates, goodwill/capital reserve arising on \nthe acquisition of an associate by an investor should be included in the carrying amount of \ninvestment in the associate but should be disclosed separately. Therefore, if the acquisition of \nequity interest in any associate involves payment which can be attributable to goodwill, this should \nbe deducted from the Common Equity Tier  1 of the bank . \n(ii) The full amount of the intangible assets is to be deducted net of any associated deferred \ntax liabilities which would be extinguished if the intangible assets become impaired or \nderecognized under the relevant accounting standards. For  this purpose, the definition of \nintangible assets would be in accordance with the Indian accounting standards. Losses in the \ncurrent period and those brought forward from previous periods should also be deducted from \nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital, if not a lready deducted . \n(iii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of any goodwill and \nother intangible assets from the consolidated Common Equity which is attributed to the Balance \nSheets of subsidiaries, in addition to deduction  of goodwill and other intangible assets which \npertain to the solo bank . \n \n 23 \n 4.4.2  Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs)14 \n(i) Deferred tax assets (DTAs) associated with accumulated losses and other such assets \nshall be deducted in full, from CET1 capital.  \n(ii) DTAs whi ch relate to timing differences (other than those related to accumulated losses) \nmay, instead of full deduction from CET1 capital, be recognised in the CET1 capital up to 10% of \na bank's CET1 capital, at the discretion of banks [after the application of al l regulatory adjustments \nmentioned from paragraphs 4.4.1 to 4.4.9 .2(C)(ii)].  \n(iii) Further, the limited recognition of DTAs as at (ii) above along with limited recognition of \nsignificant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial (i.e. ba nking, financial \nand insurance) entities in terms of paragraph 4.4.9.2(C) (iii) taken together must not exceed 15% \nof the CET1 capital, calculated after all regulatory adjustments set out from paragraphs 4.4.1 to \n4.4.9. Please refer to Annex 22 clarifying this applicable limited recognition. However, banks shall \nensure that the CET1 capital arrived at after application of 15% limit should in no case result in \nrecognising any item more than the 10% limit applicable individually.  \n(iv) The amount of DTAs which are to be deducted from CET1 capital may be netted with \nassociated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) provided that:  \n(a) both the DTAs and DTLs relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and \noffsetting is permitted by  the relevant taxation authority;  \n(b) the DTLs permitted to be netted against DTAs must exclude amounts that have been \nnetted against the deduction of goodwill, intangibles and defined benefit pension assets; and  \n(c) the DTLs must be allocated on a pro rat a basis between DTAs subject to deduction from \nCET1 capital as at (i) and (ii) above.  \n(v) The amount of DTAs which is not deducted from CET1 capital (in terms of para (ii) above) \nwill be risk weighted at 250% as in the case of significant investments in co mmon shares not \ndeducted from bank's CET1 capital as indicated in paragraph 4.4.9 (C)(iii).  \n4.4.3  Cash Flow Hedge Reserve  \n(i) The amount of the cash flow hedge reserve which relates to the hedging of items that are \nnot fair valued on the balance sheet (inc luding projected cash flows) should be derecognised in \nthe calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. This means that positive amounts should be deducted \nand negative amounts should be added back. This treatment specifically identifies the element of \nthe cash fl ow hedge reserve that is to be derecognised for prudential purposes. It removes the \nelement that gives rise to artificial volatility in Common Equity, as in this case the reserve only \n                                                            \n14 Please refer to paragraph 2.3 of circular no. DBR.No.BP.BC.83/21.06.201/2015 -16 dated March 1, 2016  on Master \nCircular \u2013 Basel II I Capital Regulations \u2013 Revision.  24 \n reflects one half of the picture (the fair value of the derivative, but not the changes in fair value of \nthe hedged future cash flow).  \n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean derecognition of cash flow \nhedge reserve from the consolidated Common Equity which is attributed to the subsidiaries, in \nadditio n to derecognition of cash flow hedge reserve pertaining to the solo bank.  \n4.4.4  Shortfall of the Stock of Provisions to Expected Losses  \nThe deduction from capital in respect of a shortfall of the stock of provisions to expected losses \nunder the Internal R atings Based (IRB) approach should be made in the calculation of Common \nEquity Tier 1. The full amount is to be deducted and should not be reduced by any tax effects that \ncould be expected to occur if provisions were to rise to the level of expected losses . \n4.4.5  Gain -on-Sale Related to Securitisation Transactions  \n(i) Banks shall be guided by the Master Direction no. DOR.STR.REC.53/21.04.177/2021 -22 \ndated September 24, 2021 titled Reserve Bank of India (Securitisation of Standard Assets) \nDirections, 2021 in  this regard.  \n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of gain -on-sale from \nthe consolidated Common Equity which is recognized by the subsidiaries in their P&L and / or \nequity, in addition to deduction of any gain -on-sale recognised by the bank at the solo level.  \n4.4.6  Cumulative Gains and Losses due to Changes in Own Credit Risk on Fair Valued \nFinancial Liabilities  \n(i) Banks are required to derecognise in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, all \nunrealised gain s and losses which have resulted from changes in the fair value of liabilities that \nare due to changes in the bank\u2019s own credit risk. In addition, with regard to derivative liabilities, \nderecognise all accounting valuation adjustments arising from the bank 's own credit risk. The \noffsetting between valuation adjustments arising from the bank's own credit risk and those arising \nfrom its counterparties' credit risk is not allowed. If a bank values its derivatives and securities \nfinancing transactions (SFTs) li abilities taking into account its own creditworthiness in the form of \ndebit valuation adjustments (DVAs), then the bank is required to deduct all DVAs from its Common \nEquity Tier 1 capital, irrespective of whether the DVAs arises due to changes in its own credit risk \nor other market factors. Thus, such deduction also includes the deduction of initial DVA at \ninception of a new trade. In other words, though a bank will have to recognize a loss reflecting \nthe credit risk of the counterparty (i.e. , credit valua tion adjustments -CVA), the bank will not be \nallowed to recognize the corresponding gain due to its own credit risk . \n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean derecognition of unrealised \ngains and losses which have resulted from chang es in the fair value of liabilities that are due to \nchanges in the subsidiaries\u2019 credit risk, in the calculation of consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 25 \n capital, in addition to derecognition of any such unrealised gains and losses attributed to the bank \nat the solo level . \n4.4.7  Defined Benefit Pension Fund15 Assets and Liabilities  \n(i) Defined benefit pension fund liabilities, as included on the balance sheet, must be fully \nrecognised in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital (i.e. , Common Equity Tier 1  capital \ncannot be increased through derecognising these liabilities). For each defined benefit pension \nfund that is an asset on the balance sheet, the asset should be deducted in the calculation of \nCommon Equity Tier 1 net of any associated deferred tax l iability which would be extinguished if \nthe asset should become impaired or derecognised under the relevant accounting standards.  \n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of defined benefit \npension fund assets and recognit ion of defined benefit pension fund liabilities pertaining to \nsubsidiaries in the consolidated Common Equity Tier 1, in addition to those pertaining to the solo \nbank.  \n4.4.8  Investments in Own Shares (Treasury Stock)  \n(i) Investment in a bank\u2019s own shares is  tantamount to repayment of capital and therefore, it \nis necessary to knock -off such investment from the bank\u2019s capital with a view to improving the \nbank\u2019s quality of capital. This deduction would remove the double counting of equity capital which \narises f rom direct holdings, indirect holdings via index funds and potential future holdings as a \nresult of contractual obligations to purchase own shares.  \n(ii) Banks should not repay their equity capital without specific approval of Reserve Bank of \nIndia. Repayme nt of equity capital can take place by way of share buy -back, investments in own \nshares (treasury stock) or payment of dividends out of reserves, none of which are permissible. \nHowever, banks may end up having indirect investments in their own stock if the y invest in / take \nexposure to mutual funds or index funds / securities which have long position in bank\u2019s share. In \nsuch cases, banks should look through holdings of index securities to deduct exposures to own \nshares from their Common Equity Tier 1 capita l. Following the same approach outlined above, \nbanks must deduct investments in their own Additional Tier 1 capital in the calculation of their \nAdditional Tier 1 capital and investments in their own Tier 2 capital in the calculation of their Tier \n2 capital . In this regard, the following rules may be observed : \n(a) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds / index funds / venture capital \nfunds / private equity funds / investment companies in the capital instruments of the investing \nbank is known; the indirect investment would be equal to bank\u2019s investments in such entities \nmultiplied by the percent of investments of these entities in the investing bank\u2019s respective \ncapital instruments . \n                                                            \n15It includes other defined employees\u2019 funds also.  26 \n (b) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds / ind ex funds / venture capital \nfunds / private equity funds / investment companies in the capital instruments of the investing \nbank is not known but, as per the investment policies / mandate of these entities such \ninvestments are permissible; the indirect inve stment would be equal to bank\u2019s investments in \nthese entities multiplied by 10%16 of investments of such entities in the investing bank\u2019s capital \ninstruments. Banks must note that this method does not follow corresponding deduction \napproach i.e. , all deduct ions will be made from the Common Equity Tier 1 capital even though, \nthe investments of such entities are in the Additional Tier 1 / Tier 2 capital of the investing \nbanks . \n(iii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of subsi diaries\u2019 \ninvestments in their own shares (direct or indirect) in addition to bank\u2019s direct or indirect \ninvestments in its own shares while computing consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 . \n4.4.9  Investments in the Capital of Banking, Fi nancial and Insurance Ent ities17 \n4.4.9.1 Limits on a Bank\u2019s Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and  Insurance \nEntities  \n(i) A bank\u2019s investment in the capital instruments issued by banking, financial and insurance \nentities is subject to the following limits:  \n(a) A bank\u2019 s investments in the capital instruments  issued by banking, financia l and \ninsurance entities should  not exceed 10% of its capital funds , but after all deductions \nmentioned in paragraph 4 (upto paragraph 4.4.8).  \n(b) Banks should not acquire any fresh stake in a bank's equity shares, if by such acquisition, \nthe investing bank's holding exceeds 10% of the investee bank's equity capital.  \n(c) Under the provisions of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, a banking \ncompany cannot hold shares in any co mpany whether as pledge or mortgagee or absolute \nowner of an amount exceeding 30% of the paid -up share capital of that company or 30% of \nits own paid -up share capital and reserves, whichever is less.  \n(d) Equity investment by a bank in a subsidiary company,  financial services company, \nfinancial institution, stock and other exchanges should not exceed 10% of the bank's paid -up \nshare capital and reserves.  \n                                                            \n16 In terms of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations 1996, no mutual fund under all its \nschemes should own more than ten per cent of any company' s paid up capital carrying voting rights.  \n17 These rules will be applicable to a bank\u2019s equity investments in other banks and financial entities, even if such \ninvestments are exempted from \u2018capital market exposure\u2019 limit.  27 \n (e) Equity investment by a bank in companies engaged in non -financial services activities \nwould be subject  to a limit of 10% of the investee company\u2019s paid up share capital or 10% of \nthe bank\u2019s paid up share capital and reserves, whichever is less . \n(f) Equity investments in any non -financial services company held by (a) a bank; (b) entities \nwhich are bank\u2019s su bsidiaries, associates or joint ventures or entities directly or indirectly \ncontrolled by the bank; and (c) mutual funds managed by AMCs  controlled by the bank sh ould \nin the aggregate not exceed 20% of the investee company\u2019s paid up share capital.  \n(g) A bank\u2019s equity investments in subsidiaries and other entities that are engaged in financial \nservices activities together with equity investments in entities engaged in non -financial \nservices activities sh ould not exceed 20% of the bank\u2019s paid -up share capital  and reserves. \nThe cap of 20% would not apply for investments classified under \u2018Held for Trading\u2019 category \nand which are not held beyond 90 days.  \n(ii) An indicative list of institutions which may be deemed to be financial institutions other than \nbanks and insurance companies for capital adequacy purposes is as under:  \n\uf0b7 Asset Management Companies of Mutual Funds / Venture Capital Funds / Private Equity \nFunds etc;  \n\uf0b7 Non-Banking Finance Companies;  \n\uf0b7 Housing Finance Companies;  \n\uf0b7 Primary Dealers;  \n\uf0b7 Merchant Banking Compan ies; \n\uf0b7 Entities engaged in activities which are ancillary to the business of banking under the B.R. \nAct, 1949; and  \n\uf0b7 Central Counterparties (CCPs).  \n(iii) Investments made by a banking subsidiary/ associate in the equity or non - equity \nregulatory capital instru ments issued by its parent bank should be deducted from such \nsubsidiary's regulatory capital following corresponding deduction approach, in its capital \nadequacy assessment on a solo basis. The regulatory treatment of investment by the non -banking \nfinancial  subsidiaries / associates in the parent bank's regulatory capital would, however, be \ngoverned by the applicable regulatory capital norms of the respective regulators of such \nsubsidiaries / associates . \n4.4.9.2 Treatment of a Bank\u2019s Investments in the Capit al Instruments Issued by Banking, \nFinancial and Insurance Entities within Limits  \nThe investment of banks in the regulatory capital instruments of other financial entities contributes \nto the inter -connectedness amongst the financial institutions. In additio n, these investments also \namount to double counting of capital in the financial system. Therefore, these investments have \nbeen subjected to stringent treatment in terms of deduction from respective tiers of regulatory 28 \n capital. A schematic representation of  treatment of banks\u2019 investments in capital instruments of \nfinancial entities is shown in Figure 1  below. Accordingly, all investments18 in the capital \ninstruments issued by banking, financial and insurance entities within the limits mentioned in \nparagraph 4.4.9.1 will be subject to the following rules:  \n \n(A) Reciprocal Cross - Holdings in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance \nEntities  \nReciprocal cross holdings of capital might result in artificially inflating the capital position of \nbanks. Such ho ldings of capital will be fully deducted. Banks must apply a \u201ccorresponding \n                                                            \n18 For this purpose, investments hel d in AFS / HFT category may be reckoned at their market values, whereas, those \nheld in HTM category may be reckoned at values appearing in the Balance sheet of the Bank.  \n29 \n deduction approach\u201d to such investments in the capital of other banks, other financial \ninstitutions and insurance entities. This means the deduction should be applied to the same \ncomponent of capital (Common Equity, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) for which the \ncapital would qualify if it was issued by the bank itself. For this purpose, a holding will be \ntreated as reciprocal cross holding if the investee entity has also inves ted in any class of \nbank\u2019s capital instruments which need not necessarily be the same as the bank\u2019s holdings.  \n(B) Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities which are \noutside the Scope of Regulatory Consolidation and where the Bank does not Own more \nthan 10% of the Issued Common Share Capital of the Entity  \n(i) The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the capital \nof banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regula tory \nconsolidation and where the bank does not own more than 10% of the issued common \nshare capital of the entity. In addition : \n(a) Investments include direct, indirect19 and synthetic holdings of capital instruments. \nFor example, banks should look through holdings of index securities to determine \ntheir underlying holdings of capital.  \n(b) Holdings in both the banking book and trading book are to be included. Capital \nincludes common stock (paid -up equity capital) and all other types of cash and \nsynthetic capi tal instruments (e.g. , subordinated debt).  \n(c) Underwriting positions held for five working days or less can be excluded. \nUnderwriting positions held for longer than five working days must be included.  \n(d) If the capital instrument of the entity in which t he bank has invested does not meet \nthe criteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2 capital of the bank, \nthe capital is to be considered common shares for the purposes of this regulatory \nadjustment20. \n(e) With the prior approval of RBI, a bank can temporarily exclude certain investments \nwhere these have been made in the context of resolving or providing financial \nassistance to reorganise a distressed institution.  \n(ii) If the total of all holdings listed in paragraph (i) above, in aggregate  exceed 10% of the \nbank\u2019s Common Equity (after applying all other regulatory adjustments in full listed prior \nto this one), then the amount above 10% is required to be deducted, applying a \ncorresponding deduction approach. This means the deduction should b e applied to the \n                                                            \n19 Indirect holdings are exposures or part of exposures that, if a direct holding loses  its value, will result in a loss to \nthe bank substantially equivalent to the loss in the value of direct holding.  \n20 If the investment is issued out of a regulated financial entity and not included in regulatory capital in the relevant \nsector of the financ ial entity, it is not required to be deducted.  30 \n same component of capital for which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the \nbank itself. Accordingly, the amount to be deducted from common equity should be \ncalculated as the total of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10% of  the bank\u2019s \ncommon equity (as per above) multiplied by the common equity holdings as a \npercentage of the total capital holdings. This would result in a Common Equity deduction \nwhich corresponds to the proportion of total capital holdings held in Common Equ ity. \nSimilarly, the amount to be deducted from Additional Tier 1 capital should be calculated \nas the total of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10% of the bank\u2019s Common Equity \n(as per above) multiplied by the Additional Tier 1 capital holdings as a pe rcentage of the \ntotal capital holdings. The amount to be deducted from Tier 2 capital should be \ncalculated as the total of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10% of the bank\u2019s \nCommon  Equity (as per above) multiplied by the Tier 2 capital holdings as a percentage \nof the total capital holdings. (Please refer to illustration given in Annex 11 ). \n(iii) If, under the corresponding deduction approach, a bank is required to make a deduction \nfrom a particular tier of capital and it does not have enough of that tier of capital to satisfy \nthat deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from the next higher tier of capital (e.g. , if a \nbank does not have enough Additional Tier 1 capital to satisfy the deduction, the shortfall \nwill be dedu cted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital).  \n(iv) Investments below the threshold of 10% of bank\u2019s Common Equity, which are not \ndeducted, will be risk weighted. Thus, instruments in the trading book will be treated as \nper the market risk rules and instruments in the banking book should be treated as per \nthe standardised approach or internal ratings -based approach (as applicable). For the \napplication of risk weighting the amount of the holdings which are required to be risk \nweighted would be allocated on a pro r ata basis between the Banking and Trading Book. \nHowever, in certain cases, such investments in both scheduled and non -scheduled \ncommercial banks will be fully deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital of investing \nbank as indicated in paragraphs 5.6, 8.3. 5 and 8.4.4.  \n(v) For the purpose of risk weighting of investments in as indicated in para (iv) above, \ninvestments in securities having comparatively higher risk weights will be considered for \nrisk weighting to the extent required to be risk weighted, both in banking and trading \nbooks. In other words, investments with comparatively poor ratings (i.e. , higher risk \nweights) should be considered for the purpose of application of risk weighting first and \nthe residual investments should be considered for deductio n. 31 \n (C) Significant Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities \nwhich are outside the Scope of Regulatory  Consolidation21 \n(i) The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the capital \nof banking, fi nancial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory \nconsolidation where the bank owns more than 10% of the issued common share capital \nof the issuing entity or wh ere the entity is an affiliate22 of the bank. In addition:  \n\uf0b7 Investments incl ude direct, indirect23 and synthetic holdings of capital instruments. \nFor example, banks should look through holdings of index securities to determine \ntheir underlying holdings of capital.  \n\uf0b7 Holdings in both the banking book and trading book are to be include d. Capital \nincludes common stock and all other types of cash and synthetic capital instruments \n(e.g., subordinated debt).  \n\uf0b7 Underwriting positions held for five working days or less can be excluded. \nUnderwriting positions held for longer than five working da ys must be included.  \n\uf0b7 If the capital instrument of the entity in which the bank has invested does not meet \nthe criteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2 capital of the bank, \nthe capital is to be considered common shares for the purpose s of this regulatory \nadjustment24. \n\uf0b7 With the prior approval of RBI , a bank can temporarily exclude certain investments \nwhere these have been made in the context of resolving or providing financial \nassistance to reorganise a distressed institution.  \n(ii) Inves tments other than Common Shares  \nAll investments included in para (i) above which are not common shares must be fully \ndeducted following a corresponding deduction approach. This means the deduction \nshould be applied to the same tier of capital for which the  capital would qualify if it was \nissued by the bank itself. If the bank is required to make a deduction from a particular \ntier of capital and it does not have enough of that tier of capital to satisfy that deduction, \nthe shortfall will be deducted from the  next higher tier of capital (e.g. , if a bank does not \n                                                            \n21 Investments in entities that are outside of the scope of regulatory consolidation refers to investments in entities \nthat have not been consolidated at all or have not been consolidated in such a way as to re sult in their assets being \nincluded in the calculation of consolidated risk -weighted assets of the group.  \n22 An affiliate of a bank is defined as a company that controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, \nthe bank. Control of a company i s defined as (1) ownership, control, or holding with power to vote 20% or more of \na class of voting securities of the company; or (2) consolidation of the company for financial reporting purposes.  \n23 Indirect holdings are exposures or part of exposures that , if a direct holding loses its value, will result in a loss to \nthe bank substantially equivalent to the loss in the value of direct holding.  \n24 If the investment is issued out of a regulated financial entity and not included in regulatory capital in the re levant \nsector of the financial entity, it is not required to be deducted.  32 \n have enough Additional Tier 1 capital to satisfy the deduction, the shortfall will be \ndeducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital).  \n(iii) Investments which are Common Shares  \nAll investments included in para (i) above which are common shares and which exceed \n10% of the bank\u2019s Common Equity (after the application of a ll regulatory adjustments) \nshall be deducted while calculating Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The amount that is \nnot deducted (upto 10% if ban k\u2019s common equity invested in the equity capital of such \nentities) in the calculati on of Common Equity Tier 1 shall be risk weighted at 250% (refer \nto illustration in Annex 11 ). However, in certain cases, such investments in b oth \nscheduled and non -scheduled commercial ba nks shall be fully deducted from Common \nEquity Tier 1 capital of investing bank as indicated in paragraphs 5.6, 8.3.5 and 8.4.4.  \n4.4.9.3 With regard to computation of indirect holdings through mutual funds or in dex funds, of \ncapital of banking, financial and insurance entities which are outside the scope of regulatory \nconsolidation as mentioned in paragraphs 4.4.9.2(B) and 4.4.9.2(C) above, the following rules \nmay be observed:  \n(i) If the amount of investments mad e by the mutual funds / index funds / venture capital \nfunds / private equity funds / investment companies in the capital instruments of the \nfinancial entities is known; the indirect investment of the bank in such entities would be \nequal to bank\u2019s investmen ts in these entities multiplied by the percent of investments of \nsuch entities in the financial entities\u2019 capital instruments.  \n(ii) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds / index funds / venture capital \nfunds / private equity funds / investm ent companies in the capital instruments of the \ninvesting bank is not known but, as per the investment policies / mandate of these \nentities such investments are permissible; the indirect investment would be equal to \nbank\u2019s investments in these entities mul tiplied by maximum permissible limit which these \nentities are authorized to invest in the financial entities\u2019 capital instruments.  \n(iii) If neither the amount of investments made by the mutual funds / index funds / venture \ncapital funds / private equity fu nds in the capital instruments of financial entities nor the \nmaximum amount which these entities can invest in financial entities are known but, as \nper the investment policies / mandate of these entities such investments are permissible; \nthe entire investm ent of the bank in these entities would be treated as indirect investment \nin financial entities. Banks must note that this method does not follow corresponding \ndeduction approach i.e. all deductions shall be made from the Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital even though, the investments of such entities are in the Additional Tier 1 / Tier 2 \ncapital of the investing banks.  \n 33 \n 4.4.9.4 Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean:  \n(i) Identifying the relevant entities below and above threshold of 10% of c ommon share \ncapital of investee entities, based on aggregate investments of the consolidated group \n(parent plus consolidated subsidiaries) in common share capital of individual investee \nentities.  \n(ii) Applying the rules as stipulated in paragraphs 4.4.9.2( A), 4.4.9.2(B) and 4.4.9.2(C) and \nsegregating in vestments into those which shall be deducted from the consolidated  \ncapital and those which shall be risk weighted. For this purpose,  \n\uf0b7 investments of the entire consolidated entity in capital instruments of inv estee entities \nshall be aggregated into different classes of instruments.  \n\uf0b7 the consolidated Common Equity of the group shall be taken into account.  \n4.4.9.5  It has come to our notice that certain investors such as Employee Pension Funds have \nsubscribed to re gulatory capital issues of commercial banks concerned. These funds enjoy the \ncounter guarantee by the bank concerned in respect of  returns. When returns of the investors of \nthe capital issues are counter guaranteed by the bank, such investments shall not b e considered \nas regulatory capital for the purpose of capital adequacy.  \n4.4.10 As indicated in paragraphs 3. 4.2 and 3. 5.1, equity investments in no n-financial \nsubsidiaries should be fully deducted from the consolidated and solo CET1 capital of the bank \nrespectively, after making all the regulatory adjustments as indicated in above paragraphs.  \n4.4.11  Intra Group Transactions and Exposures  \nAttention is invited to circular DBOD .No.BP.BC.96/21.06.102/ 2013 -14 dated February 11, 2014  \non \u201cGuidelines on Management of Intra -Group Transactions and Exposures\u201d in terms of which \nintra-group exposures beyond permissible limits subsequent to March 31, 2016, if any, would be \ndeducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital of the bank.  \n4.5 Transitional Arrangements  \n4.5.1 Capital instruments which no longer qualify as non -common equity Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 \ncapital (e.g. , IPDI and Tier 2 debt instruments with step -ups) will be phased out beginn ing January \n1, 2013. Fixing the base at the nominal amount of such instruments outstanding on January 1, \n2013, their recognition will be capped at 90% from January 1, 2013, with the cap reducing by 10 \npercentage points in each subsequent year25. This cap wi ll be applied to Additional Tier 1 and \n                                                            \n25 The base should only include instruments that will be grandfathered. If an instrument is derecognized on January \n1, 2013, it does not count towards the base fixed on January 1, 201 3. Also, the base for the transitional arrangements \nshould reflect the outstanding amount which is eligible to be included in the relevant tier of capital under the existing \nframework applied as on December 31, 2012. Further, for Tier 2 instruments which h ave begun to amortise before \nJanuary 1, 2013, the base for grandfathering should take into account the amortised amount, and not the full 34 \n Tier 2 capital instruments separately and refers to the total amount of instruments outstanding \nwhich no longer meet the relevant entry criteria. To the extent an instrument is redeemed, or its \nrecognition in capital is amortised, after January 1, 2013, the nominal amount serving as the base \nis not reduced. In addition, instruments, specifically those with an incentive to be redeemed will \nbe treated as follows:  \n4.5.1.1 If the non -common equity regulatory capital instru ment has been issued prior to \nSeptember 12, 2010, then the treatment indicated in paragraphs from 4.5. 1.1(A) to 4.5. 1.1(D) will \napply:  \n(A) If the instrument does not have a call and a step -up and other incentive to redeem - (i) if \nit meets all the other cr iteria, including the non -viability criteria, then such instrument will continue \nto be fully recognised from January 1, 2013; (ii) if the instrument does not meet the other criteria, \nincluding the non -viability criteria, then it will be phased out from Jan uary 1, 2013.  \n(B) If the instrument has a call and a step -up and the effective maturity date was prior to \nSeptember 12, 2010 and the call option was not exercised - (i) if the instrument meets all other \ncriteria, including the non -viability criteria, then such instrument will continue to be fully recognised \nfrom January 1, 2013; (ii) if the instrument does not meet the other criteria, including the non -\nviability criteria, then it will be phased out from January 1, 2013.  \n(C) If the instrument has a call and a step -up and the effective maturity date is between \nSeptember 12, 2010 and December 31, 2012 and the call option is not exercised \u2013 (i) if the \ninstrument meets all other criteria, including the non -viability criteria, then such instrument will \ncontinue to  be fully recognised from January 1, 2013; (ii) if the instrument does not meet the other \ncriteria, including the non -viability criteria, then it will be fully derecognised from January 1, 2013. \nHowever, if such instrument meets all other criteria except t he non -viability criteria then it will be \nphased out from January 1, 2013.  \n(D) If the instrument has a call and a step -up and the effective maturity date is after January \n1, 2013 - (i) the instrument will be phased out from January 1, 2013 till the call op tion is exercised; \n(ii) if the call option is not exercised and it meets all other criteria, including the non -viability criteria, \nthen the instrument will be phased out from January 1, 2013 till the call date and fully recognised \nafter the call date. Howe ver, if it does not meet all the criteria including the non -viability criteria, \n                                                            \nnominal amount. Thus, individual instruments will continue to be amortised at a rate of 20% per year while the \naggrega te cap will be reduced at a rate of 10% per year.  \nTo calculate the base in cases of instruments denominated in foreign currency, which no longer qualify for inclusion \nin the relevant tier of capital (but will be grandfathered) should be included using thei r value in the reporting \ncurrency of the bank as on January 1, 2013. The base will therefore be fixed in the reporting currency of the bank \nthroughout the transitional period. During the transitional period instruments denominated in a foreign currency \nshould be valued as they are reported on the balance sheet of the bank at the relevant reporting date (adjusting for \nany amortisation in the case of Tier 2 instruments) and, along with all other instruments which no longer meet the \ncriteria for inclusion in t he relevant tier of capital, will be subject to the cap.  35 \n then the instrument will be phased out from January 1, 2013 till the call date and fully \nderecognised after the call date.  \n4.5.1.2 If the non -common equity regulatory capital i nstrument has been issued between \nSeptember 12, 2010 and December 31, 201226, then the treatment indicated in paragraphs from \n4.5.1.2(A) to 4.5. 1.2(C) will apply:  \n(A) If such instrument meets all the criteria including non -viability criteria, then it will c ontinue to \nbe fully recognised from January 1, 2013.  \n(B) If such instrument does not meet all the criteria including non -viability criteria, then it will be \nfully derecognised from January 1, 2013.  \n(C) If such instrument meets all the criteria except the n on-viability criteria, then it will be phased \nout from January 1, 2013.  \n4.5.1.3 Non -common equity regulatory capital instrument issued on or after January 1, 2013 must \ncomply with all the eligibility criteria including the non -viability criteria in order t o be an eligible \nregulatory capital instrument (Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital). Otherwise, such instrument will \nbe fully derecognised as eligible capital instrument.  \n4.5.1.4 A schematic representation of above mentioned phase -out arrangements has bee n shown \nin the Annex 19 . \n4.5.2 Capital instruments which do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Common Equity Tier 1 will \nbe excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 as on April 1, 2013.  \n4.5.3 An illustration of transitional arra ngements - Capital instruments which no longer qualify as \nnon-common equity Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital is furnished in the Annex 12 . \n \n5. Capital Charge for Credit Risk  \n5.1 General  \nUnder the Standardised Approach, the rat ing assigned by the eligible external credit rating \nagencies will largely support the measure of credit risk. The Reserve Bank has identified the \nexternal credit rating agencies that meet the eligibility criteria specified under the revised \nFramework. Bank s shall rely upon the ratings assigned by the external credit rating agencies \nchosen by the Reserve Bank for assigning risk weights for capital adequacy purposes as per the \nmapping furnished in these guidelines.  \n                                                            \n26 Please refer circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.75/21.06.001/2010\u201011 dated January 20, 2011  on \u2018Regulatory Capital \nInstruments \u2013 Step up Option\u2019. Banks may also refer to the BCBS Press Release dated September 12, 2010 indicating \nannouncements made by the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision on higher global minimum capital \nstandards  36 \n 5.2 Claims on Domestic Sovereigns  \n5.2.1  Both fund based and non -fund based claims on the central government will attract a zero \nrisk weight. Central Government guaranteed claims will attract a zero risk weight.  \n5.2.2  The Direct loan / credit / overdraft exposure, if any, of banks to the State Govern ments \nand the investment in State Government securities will attract zero risk weight. State Government \nguaranteed claims will attract 20 per cent risk weight.  \n5.2.3  The risk weight applicable to claims on central government exposures will also apply to \nthe claims on the Reserve Bank of India, DICGC, Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and \nSmall Enterprises (CGTMSE) and Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing \n(CRGFTLIH)27 and individual schemes under National Credit Guarantee Trustee Compan y Ltd. \n(NCGTC) which are backed by explicit Central Government Guarantee . Similarly , credit facilities \nextended under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme of NCGTC which are backed by \nan unconditional and irrevocable guarantee provided by Government of India shall also be \nassigned zero percent risk weight to the extent of guarantee coverage28. The claims on ECGC \nwill attract a risk weight of 20 per cent.  \n5.2.4  The above risk weights for both direct claims and guarantee claims will be applicable as \nlong as they are classified as \u2018standard\u2019 / performing assets. Where these sovereign exposures \nare classified as non -performing, they would attract risk weights as applicable to NPAs, which are \ndetailed in paragraph 5.12.  \n5.2.5 The above risk weights will be a pplied if such exposures are denominated in Indian \nRupees and also funded in Indian Rupees.  \n5.3 Claims on Foreign Sovereigns and Foreign Central Banks29 \n5.3.1  Subject to paragraph 5.3.2 below, claims on foreign sovereigns and their central banks \nwill attrac t risk weights as per the rating assigned30 to those sovereigns and central banks/ \nsovereign and central bank claims, by international rating agencies as follows : \nTable 1: Claims on Foreign Sovereigns / Central Banks \u2013 Risk Weights  \nS&P*/Fitch \nratings  AAA to  AA A BBB  BB to B  Below B  Unrated  \nMoody\u2019s ratings  Aaa to Aa  A Baa Ba to B  Below B  Unrated  \nRisk weight (%)  0 20 50 100 150 100 \n* Standard & Poor\u2019s  \n                                                            \n27 Please refer to the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC -90/21.04.048/2012 -13 dated April 16, 2013  on Advances Guaranteed \nby \u2018Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH) - Risk Weights and Provisioning\u2019.  \n28 Please refer to the circular DoR.BP.BC.No.76/21.06.201/2019 -20 dated June 21, 2020  on Assignment of Risk \nWeights on Credit Facilities (Guaranteed Emergency Credit Line) under  the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee \nScheme.  \n29 Please refer to the circular DBR.BP.BC.No.43/21.06.001/2015 -16 dated October 8, 2015  on Risk Weights for Claims \non Foreign Cent ral Banks  \n30 For example: The risk weight assigned to an investment in US Treasury Bills by SBI branch in Paris, irrespective of \nthe currency of funding, will be determined by the rating assigned to the Treasury Bills, as indicated in Table 2.  37 \n 5.3.2  Claims on the foreign sovereign or foreign central bank in their jurisdiction, denominated \nin the dom estic currency of that jurisdiction, met out of resources of the same currency31 will \nattract a risk weight of zero percent. However, in case a Host Supervisor requires a more \nconservative treatment to such claims in the books of the foreign branches of the  Indian Banks, \nthey should adopt the requirements prescribed by the Host Country supervisors for computing \ncapital adequacy . \n5.4 Claims on Public Sector Entities (PSEs)  \n5.4.1 Claims on domestic public sector entities will be risk weighted in a manner simil ar to claims \non Corporates.  \n5.4.2 Claims on foreign PSEs will be risk weighted as per the rating assigned by the international \nrating agencies as under:  \nTable 2: Claims on Foreign PSEs \u2013 Risk Weights  \nS&P / Fitch \nratings  AAA to AA  A BBB to BB  Below BB  Unrat ed \nMoody\u2019s ratings  Aaa to Aa  A Baa to Ba  Below Ba  Unrated  \nRisk weight (%)  20 50 100 150 100 \n5.5 Claims on MDBs, BIS and IMF  \nClaims on the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nand the following eligible Multilat eral Development Banks (MDBs) evaluated by the BCBS will be \ntreated similar to claims on scheduled banks meeting the minimum capital adequacy \nrequirements and assigned a uniform twenty per cent risk weight:  \n(a) World Bank Group: IBRD and IFC,  \n(b) Asian Dev elopment Bank,  \n(c) African Development Bank,  \n(d) European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,  \n(e) Inter-American Development Bank,  \n(f) European Investment Bank,  \n(g) European Investment Fund,  \n(h) Nordic Investment Bank,  \n(i) Caribbean Development Bank,  \n(j) Islamic Development Bank and  \n(k) Council of Europe Development Bank  \n(l) International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm)  \n                                                            \n31 For example : The risk weight assigned to an investment in US Treasury Bills by SBI branch in New York will attract \na zero per cent risk weight, irrespective of the rating of the claim, if the investment is funded from out of the USD \ndenominated resources of SBI, New York. In case the SBI, New York, did not have any USD denominated resources, \nthe risk weight will be determined by the rating assigned to the Treasury Bills, as indicated in Table 1 above.  38 \n (m) Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)  \n5.6 Claims on Banks (Exposure to capital instruments)  \n5.6.1 In case of a ban ks\u2019 investment in capital instruments of other banks, the following such \ninvestments  would not be deducted, but would attract appropriate risk weights (refer to the \nparagraph 4.4.9 above):  \n(i) Investments in capital instruments of banks where the investing  bank holds not more \nthan 10% of the issued common shares of the investee banks, subject to the following \nconditions:  \n\uf0b7 Aggregate of these investments, together with investments in the capital instruments \nin insurance and other financial entities, do not ex ceed 10% of Common Equity of the \ninvesting bank; and  \n\uf0b7 The equity investment in the investee entities is outside the scope of regulatory \nconsolidation.  \n (ii) Equity investments  in other banks where the investing bank holds more than 10% of the \nissued common shares of the investee banks, subject to the following conditions:  \n\uf0b7 Aggregate of these investments, together with such investments in insurance and \nother financial entities, do not exceed 10% of Common Equity of the investing bank.  \n\uf0b7 The equity investment in the investee entities is outside the scope of regulatory \nconsolidation.  \nAccordingly, the claims on banks incorporated in India and the branches of foreign banks in India, \nother than those deducted in terms of paragraph 4.4.9 above, will be risk weighted as  under:  \nTable 3: Claims on Banks32 Incorporated in India and Foreign Bank Branches in India  \n \n Risk Weights (%)  \nAll Scheduled Banks  \n(Commercial, Regional Rural \nBanks, Local Area Banks and Co -\nOperative Banks)  All Non -Scheduled Banks  \n(Commercial, Regional Ru ral \nBanks, Local Area Banks and Co -\nOperative Banks)  \nLevel of  \nCommon Equity Tier \n1 capital (CET1) \nincluding applicable \ncapital conservation \nbuffer (CCB) (%) of \nthe investee bank  \n(where applicable)  Investments \nreferred to in \nparagraph \n5.6.1 (i)  Investmen\nts referred \nto in \nparagraph \n5.6.1 (ii)  All \nother \nclaims  Investments \nreferred to in \nparagraph \n5.6.1 (i)  Investmen\nts referred \nto in \nparagraph \n5.6.1 (ii)  All \nother \nclaims  \n                                                            \n32 For claims held in AFS and HFT portfolios, please see the paragra phs 8.3.5 and 8.4.4 under \u2018capital charge for \nmarket risk\u2019  39 \n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \nApplicable Minimum \nCET1 + Applicable \nCCB and above  125 % or the \nrisk we ight as \nper the rating \nof the \ninstrument or \ncounterparty, \nwhichever is \nhigher  250 20 125% or the \nrisk weight as \nper the rating \nof the \ninstrument or \ncounterparty, \nwhichever is \nhigher  300 100 \nApplicable Minimum \nCET1 + CCB = 75% \nand <100% of \napplicable CCB33 150 300 50 250 350 150 \nApplicable Minimum \nCET1 + CCB = 50% \nand <75% of \napplicable CCB  250 350 100 350 450 250 \nApplicable Minimum \nCET1 + CCB = 0% \nand <50% of \napplicable CCB  350 450 150 625 Full \ndeduction*  350 \nMinimum CET1 less \nthan applicable \nminimum  625 Full \ndeduction*  625 Full \ndeduction*  Full \ndeduction*  625 \n* The deduction should be made from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.  \nNotes:  \n(i) In the case of banks where no capital adequacy norms have been prescribed by the \nRBI, the lending / investing bank may ca lculate the CRAR of the cooperative bank \nconcerned, notionally, by obtaining necessary information from the investee bank, \nusing the capital adequacy norms as applicable to the commercial banks. In case, it is \nnot found feasible to compute CRAR on such not ional basis, the risk weight of 350 or \n625 per cent, as per the risk perception of the investing bank, should be applied \nuniformly to the investing bank\u2019s entire exposure.  \n(ii) In case of banks where capital adequacy norms are not applicable at present, the \nmatter of investments in their capital -eligible instruments would not arise for now. \nHowever, this Table above will become applicable to them, if in future they issue any \ncapital instruments where other banks are eligible to invest.  \n(iii) Till such time the investe e banks have not disclosed their Basel III capital ratios \npublicly, the risk weights / capital charges shall be arrived at based on the applicable \ntables / paragraph as contained in the Master Circular \n                                                            \n33 For example, as on March 31, 2022, minimum Common Equity Tier 1 of 5.5% and CCB between equal to 75% of \n2.50% and less than 2.50%.  40 \n DBOD.No.BP.BC.4/21.06.001/2015 -16 dated July 1, 2015  on Prudential Guidelines \non Capital Adequacy and Market Discipline - New Capital Adequacy Framework.  \n5.6.2  The claims on foreign banks will be risk weighted as under as p er the ratings assigned by \ninternational rating agencies.  \nTable 4: Claims on Foreign Banks \u2013 Risk Weights  \nS&P / Fitch ratings  AAA to AA  A BBB  BB to B  Below B  Unrated  \nMoody\u2019s ratings  Aaa to Aa  A Baa Ba to B  Below B  Unrated  \nRisk weight (%)  20 50 50 100 150 50 \nThe exposures of the Indian branches of foreign banks, guaranteed / counter -guaranteed by the \noverseas Head Offices or the bank\u2019s branch in another country shall amount to a claim on the \nparent foreign bank if exposure is reckoned as per prudential no rms on the foreign bank\u2019s branch \n/ Head office and shall also attract the risk weights as per Table 4  above .

Claims included in this portfolio shall be assigned a risk -\nweight of 75 per cent, except as provided in paragraph 5.12 below for non -performing assets.  \n5.9.2  The following claims, both fund based and non -fund based, shall be excluded from the \nregulatory  retail portfolio:  \n(a) Exposures by way of investments in securities (such as bonds and equities), whether listed \nor not;  \n(b) Mortgage Loans to the extent that they qualify for treatment as claims secured by \nresidential property39 or claims secured by comme rcial real estate40; \n(c) Loans and Advances to bank\u2019s own staff which are fully covered by superannuation \nbenefits and / or mortgage of flat/ house;  \n(d) Consumer Credit, including Personal Loans and credit card receivables;  \n(e) Capital Market Exposures;  \n(f) Venture Capital Funds.  \n5.9.3  Qualifying Criteria  \n(i) Orientation Criterion  - The exposure (both fund -based and non fund -based) is to an \nindividual person or persons or to a small business; Person under this clause would mean any \nlegal person capable of enteri ng into contracts and would include but not be restricted to \nindividual and HUF; small business would include partnership firm, trust, private limited \n                                                            \n39 Mortgage loans qualifying for treatment as \u2018claims s ecured by residential property\u2019 are defined in paragraph 5.10.  \n40 As defined in paragraph 5.11.1.  43 \n companies, public limited companies, co -operative societies etc. Small business is one where \nthe total av erage annual turnover is less than \u20b950 crore. The turnover criterion will be linked to \nthe average of the last three years in the case of existing entities; projected turnover in the \ncase of new entities; and both actual and projected turnover for entities  which are yet to \ncomplete three years.  \n \n(ii) Product Criterion  - The exposure (both fund -based and non -fund-based) takes the form of \nany of the following: revolving credits and lines of credit (including overdrafts), term loans and \nleases (e.g. , instalment loa ns and leases, student and educational loans) and small business \nfacilities and commitments.  \n \n(iii) Granularity Criterion  - Banks must ensure that the regulatory retail portfolio is sufficiently \ndiversified to a degree that reduces the risks in the portfolio, wa rranting the 75 per cent risk \nweight. One way of achieving this is that no aggregate exposure to one counterpart should \nexceed 0.2 per cent of the overall regulatory retail portfolio. \u2018 Aggregate exposure \u2019 means \ngross amount (i.e. , not taking any benefit fo r credit risk mitigation into account) of all forms of \ndebt exposures (e.g. , loans or commitments) that individually satisfy the three other criteria. In \naddition, \u2018one counterpart\u2019 means one or several entities that may be considered as a single \nbeneficia ry (e.g. , in the case of a small business that is affiliated to another small business, the \nlimit would apply to the bank's aggregated exposure on both businesses). While banks may \nappropriately use the group exposure concept for computing aggregate exposu res, they \nshould evolve adequate systems to ensure strict adherence with this criterion. NPAs under \nretail loans are to be excluded from the overall regulatory retail portfolio when assessing the \ngranularity criterion for risk -weighting purposes.  \n \n(iv) Low valu e of individual exposures  - The maximum aggregated retail exposure to one \ncounterpart should not exceed the absolute threshold limit of \u20b97.5 crore.  \n \nNote : The threshold limit referred above was raised from \u20b95 crore to \u20b97.5 crore vide circular \nno.

In terms of the aforesaid circular, the risk weight of \n75 per cent will apply to all fresh exposures and also to existing exposures where incremental \nexposure may be taken by the banks upto the revised limit of \u20b97.5 crore. Illustrations are given \nin Annex 2 3. \n5.9.4  For the purpose of ascertaining compliance with the absolute threshold, exposure would \nmean sanctioned limit or the actual outstanding, whichever is higher, for all fund b ased and non -\nfund based facilities, including all forms of off -balance sheet exposures. In the case of term loans \nand EMI based facilities, where there is no scope for redrawing any portion of the sanctioned \namounts, exposure shall mean the actual outstand ing. 44 \n 5.9.5  The RBI would evaluate at periodic intervals the risk weight assigned to the retail portfolio \nwith reference to the default experience for these exposures. As part of the supervisory review \nprocess, the RBI would also consider whether the credit  quality of regulatory retail claims held by \nindividual banks should warrant a standard risk weight higher than 75 per cent.  \n5.10 Claims secured by Residential Property  \n5.10.1  Lending to individuals meant for acquiring residential property which are fully secured by \nmortgages on the residential property that is or will be occupied by the borrower, or that is rented, \nshall be risk weighted as indicated as per Table 7 below, based on Board approved valuation \npolicy. LTV ratio should be computed as a percentag e with total outstanding in the account (viz. \n\u201cprincipal + accrued interest + other charges pertaining to the loan\u201d without any netting) in the \nnumerator and the realisable value of the residential property mortgaged to the bank in the \ndenominator.  \nTable 7 : Claims Secured by Residential Property \u2013 Risk Weights41 \nCategory of Loan  LTV Ratio42 (%)  Risk Weight (%)  \n(a) Individual Housing Loans    \n(i) Up to Rs. 30 lakh  \u226480 35 \n>80 and \u226490  50 \n(ii) Above Rs. 30 lakh and up to Rs. 75 lakh  \u226480 35 \n(iii) Above Rs.75 lakh  \u226475 50 \n(b) Commercial Real Estate \u2013 Residential Housing \n(CRE -RH)  N A 75 \n(c) Commercial Real Estate (CRE)  N A 100 \n \nHowever, the following LTV ratios and Risk Weights shall apply to individual housing loans \nsanctioned on or after October 16, 2020 and upto March 31, 2022, irrespective of the loan \namount43. \n \nLTV Ratio (%)  Risk Weight (%)  \n\u2264 80 35 \n> 80 and \u2264 90  50 \n \n \n                                                            \n41 Please refer to the circular no.

Hence, other forms of \ncollateral  like land, buildings, plant, machinery, current assets, etc. will not be reckoned while \ncomputing the secured portion of NPAs for capital adequacy purposes.  \n5.12.4  In addition to the above, where a NPA is fully secured by the following forms of collateral  \nthat are not recognised for credit risk mitigation purposes, either independently or along with other \neligible collateral a 100 per cent risk weight may apply, net of specific provisions, when provisions \nreach 15 per cent of the outstanding amount:  \n(i) Land a nd building which are valued by an expert valuer and where the valuation is not \nmore than three years old, and  \n(ii) Plant and machinery in good working condition at a value not higher than the depreciated \nvalue as reflected in the audited balance sheet of the borrower, which is not older than \neighteen months.  \n5.12.5  The above collaterals (mentioned in paragraph 5.12.4) will be recognized only where the \nbank is having clear title to realize the sale proceeds thereof and can appropriate the same \ntowards the amoun ts due to the bank. The bank\u2019s title to the collateral should be well documented. \nThese forms of collaterals are not recognised anywhere else under the standardised approach.  \n5.12.6  Claims secured by residential property, as defined in paragraph 5.10.1, wh ich are NPA \nwill be risk weighted at 100 per cent net of specific provisions. If the specific provisions in such \nloans are at least 20 per cent but less than 50 per cent of the outstanding amount, the risk weight \napplicable to the loan net of specific prov isions will be 75 per cent. If the specific provisions are \n50 per cent or more the applicable risk weight will be 50 per cent.  \n5.13 Specified Categories  \n5.13.1  Fund based and non -fund based claims on Venture Capital Funds, which are considered \nas high risk  exposures, will attract a higher risk weight of 150 per cent.  47 \n 5.13.2  Reserve Bank may, in due course, decide to apply a 150 per cent or higher risk weight \nreflecting the higher risks associated with any other claim that may be identified as a high risk \nexposure.  \n5.13.3  Consumer credit, including personal loans but excluding credit card receivables, will \nattract a risk weight of 100%. C redit card receivables will attract a higher risk weight of 125 per \ncent or higher, if warranted by the external rating (or , the lack of it) of the counterparty. As gold \nand gold jewellery are eligible financial collateral, the counterparty exposure in respect of personal \nloans secured by gold and gold jewellery will be worked out under the comprehensive approach \nas per paragr aph 7.3.4. The \u2018exposure value after risk mitigation\u2019 shall attract the risk weight of \n125 per cent.  \n5.13.4  Advances classified as \u2018Capital market exposures\u2019 will attract a 125 per cent risk weight \nor risk weight warranted by external rating (or lack of it ) of the counterparty, whichever is higher. \nThese risk weights will also be applicable to all banking book exposures, which are exempted \nfrom capital market exposure ceilings for direct investments / total capital market exposures46. \n5.13.5  The exposure to capital instruments  issued by NBFCs which are not deducted and are \nrequired to be risk weighted in terms of paragraph 4.4.9.2(B) would be risk weighted at 125% or \nas per the external ratings, whichever is higher. The exposure to equity instruments  issued b y \nNBFCs which are not deducted and are required to be risk weighted in terms of paragraph \n4.4.9.2(C) would be risk weighted at 250%. The claims (other than in the form of capital \ninstruments of investee companies) on all NBFCs excluding Core Investment Com panies (CIC) \nshall be risk weighted as per the ratings assigned by the rating agencies registered with SEBI and \naccredited by the Reserve Bank of India, in a manner similar to that of corporates. The claims on \nCICs , rated and unrated,  shall be risk -weighte d at 100%.  \n5.13.6  All investments in the paid -up equity of non -financial entities (other than subsidiaries) \nwhich exceed 10% of the issued common share capital of the issuing entity or where the entity is \nan unconsolidated affiliate as defined in paragraph  4.4.9.2(C)(i) will receive a risk weight of \n1250%47.

For this purpose, any funds raised by way of equity shall be \ndeemed to be part of incremental funds raised by the specified borrower ( from outside the banking system) in the \ngiven year; Provided that where a specified borrower has already raised funds by way of market instruments and \nthe amount outstanding in respect of such instruments as on the reference date is 15 per cent or more of ASCL on \nthat date, the NPLL will mean 60 percent of the incremental funds raised by the specified borrower over and above \nits ASCL as on the reference date, in the financial years (FYs) succeeding the FY in which the reference date falls.  \nAggregate Sanctio ned Credit Limit (ASCL)  means the aggregate of the fund based credit limits sanctioned or \noutstanding, whichever is higher, to a borrower by the banking system.

Since flat / house is \nnot an eligible collateral and since banks normally recover the dues by adjusting the \nsuperannuation benefits only at the time of cessation from service, the co ncessional risk weight \nshall be applied without any adjustment of the outstanding amount. In case a bank is holding \neligible collateral in respect of amounts due from a staff member, the outstanding amount in \nrespect of that staff member shall be adjusted to the extent permissible, as indicated in paragraph \n7 below.  \n5.14.2  Other loans and advances to bank\u2019s own staff will be eligible for inclusion under regulatory \nretail portfolio and will therefore attract a 75 per cent risk weight.  \n5.14.3  All other assets  will attract a uniform risk weight of 100 per cent.  \n5.15 Off-Balance Sheet Items  \n5.15.1  General  \n(i) The total risk weighted off -balance sheet credit exposure is calculated as the sum of the \nrisk-weighted amount of the market related and non -market related  off-balance sheet items. \nThe risk -weighted amount of an off -balance sheet item that gives rise to credit exposure is \ngenerally calculated by means of a two -step process:  \n(a) the notional amount of the transaction is converted into a credit equivalent amou nt, \nby multiplying the amount by the specified credit conversion factor or by applying the \ncurrent exposure method; and  \n(b) the resulting credit equivalent amount is multiplied by the risk weight applicable to the \ncounterparty or to the purpose for which t he bank has extended finance or the type of \nasset, whichever is higher.  \n(ii) Where the off -balance sheet item is secured by eligible collateral or guarantee, the credit \nrisk mitigation guidelines detailed in paragraph 7 shall be applied.  \n5.15.2  Non-market -related Off Balance Sheet Items52 \n(i) The credit equivalent amount in relation to a non -market related off -balance sheet item like, \ndirect credit substitutes, trade and performance related contingent items and commitments \nwith certain drawdown, other commitment s, etc. will be determined by multiplying the \n                                                            \n52 The aggregate  capital required to be maintained by the banks providing Partial Credit Enhancement will be \ncomputed as provided in circular DBR.BP.BC.No.40/21.04.142/2015 -16 dated Septe mber 24, 2015 , as amended from \ntime to time.  50 \n contracted amount of that particular  transaction by the relevant credit conversion factor \n(CCF).  \n(ii) Where the non -market related off -balance sheet item is an undrawn or partially undrawn \nfund-based facility53, the amount of undrawn commitment to be included in calculating the \noff-balance sheet non -market related credit exposures is the maximum unused portion of \nthe commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity. Any drawn \nportion of a commitm ent forms a part of bank's on -balance sheet credit exposure.  \n(iii) In the case of irrevocable commitments to provide off -balance sheet facilities, the original \nmaturity will be measured from the commencement of the commitment until the time the \nassociated facili ty expires. For example , an irrevocable commitment with an original \nmaturity of 12 months, to issue a 6 month documentary letter of credit, is deemed to have \nan original maturity of 18 months. Irrevocable commitments to provide off -balance sheet \nfacilities  should be assigned the lower of the two applicable credit conversion factors. For \nexample, an irrevocable commitment with an original maturity of 15 months (50 per cent - \nCCF) to issue a six month documentary letter of credit (20 per cent - CCF) would att ract the \nlower of the CCF i.e., the CCF applicable to the documentary letter of credit viz. 20 per cent.  \n(iv) The credit conversion factors for non -market related off -balance sheet transactions are as \nunder:  \nTable 8: Credit Conversion Factors \u2013 Non-market relat ed Off -Balance Sheet Items  \nSr. \nNo.  Instruments  Credit Conversion Factor \n(%) \n1.  Direct credit substitutes e.g. , general guarantees of \nindebtedness (including standby L/Cs serving as \nfinancial guarantees for loans and securities, credit \nenhancements, liqu idity facilities for securitisation \ntransactions), and acceptances (including \nendorsements with the character of acceptance).  \n(i.e., the risk of loss depends on the credit worthiness \nof the counterparty or the party against whom a \npotential claim is acqui red)  100 \n2.  Certain transaction -related contingent items (e.g. , \nperformance bonds, bid bonds, warranties, 50 \n                                                            \n53 For example: (a) In the case of a cash credit facility for Rs.100 lakh (which is not unconditionally cancellable) where \nthe drawn portion is Rs. 60 lakh, the undrawn portion of Rs. 40 lakh will attract a CCF of 20 per cent (since the CC \nfacility is subject to review / renewal normally once a year). The credit equivalent amount of Rs. 8 lakh (20% of Rs.40 \nlakh) will be assigned the appropriate risk weight as applicable to the counterparty / rating to arrive at the risk \nweighted asset for the undrawn portion. The drawn portion (Rs. 60 lakh) will attract a risk weight as applicable to \nthe counterparty / rating.  \n(b) A TL of Rs. 700 cr is sanctioned for a large project which can be drawn down in stages over a three year period. \nThe terms of sanction allow draw down in three stages \u2013 Rs. 150 cr in Stage I, Rs. 200 cr in Stage II and Rs. 350 cr in \nStage III, where the borrower needs the bank\u2019s explicit approval for draw down under Stages II and III after \ncompletion of certain formalities. If the borrower has drawn already Rs. 50 cr under Stage I, then the undrawn \nportion would be computed with reference to Stage I alone i.e., it will be Rs.100 cr. If Stage I is scheduled to be \ncompleted within one year, the CCF will be 20% and if it is more than one year then the applicable CCF will be 50 per \ncent.  51 \n indemnities and standby letters of credit related to \nparticular transaction).  \n3.  Short -term self -liquidating trade letters of credit arising \nfrom the movement of goods (e.g. , documentary \ncredits collateralised by the underlying shipment) for \nboth issuing bank and confirming bank.  20 \n4.  Sale and repurchase agreement and asset sales with \nrecourse, where the credit risk remains with the bank.  \n(These items are to be risk weighted according to the \ntype of asset and not according to the type of \ncounterparty with whom the transaction has been \nentered into.)  100 \n5.  Forward asset purchases, forward deposits and partly \npaid shares and securities, w hich represent \ncommitments with certain drawdown.  \n(These items are to be risk weighted according to the \ntype of asset and not according to the type of \ncounterparty with whom the transaction has been \nentered into.)  100 \n6  Lending of banks\u2019 securities or posting of securities as \ncollateral by banks, including instances where these \narise out of repo style transactions (i.e., repurchase / \nreverse repurchase and securities lending / securities \nborrowing transactions)  100 \n7.  Note issuance facilities and rev olving / non -revolving \nunderwriting facilities.  50 \n8  Commitments with certain drawdown  100 \n9.  Other commitments (e.g., formal standby facilities and \ncredit lines) with an original maturity of  \n        a)  up to one year  \n        b)  over one year  \nSimilar commitments that are unconditionally \ncancellable at any time by the bank without prior notice \nor that effectively provide for automatic cancellation \ndue to deterioration in a borrower\u2019s credit \nworthiness54.*   \n \n20 \n50 \n \n \n \n0 \n10. Take -out Finance in the books of taking -over \ninstitution   \n(i) Unconditional take -out finance  100 \n(ii) Conditional take -out finance  50 \n* Note : In respect of borrowers having aggregate fund based working capital limit of \u20b9150 \ncrore and above from the banking system, the und rawn portion of cash credit / overdraft \n                                                            \n54 However, this will be subject to banks demonstrating that they are actually able to cancel any undrawn \ncommitments in case of deterioration in a borrower\u2019s credit worthiness  failing which the credit conversion factor \napplicable to such facilities which are not cancellable will apply. Banks\u2019 compliance to these guidelines will be \nassessed under Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process under Pillar 2 of RBI.  52 \n limits sanctioned, irrespective of whether unconditionally cancellable or not, shall attract a \ncredit conversion factor of 20 percent.55 \n \n(v) In regard to non -market related off -balance sheet items, the following transact ions with non -\nbank counterparties will be treated as claims on banks:  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees issued by banks against the counter guarantees of other banks.  \n\uf0b7 Rediscounting of documentary bills discounted by other banks and bills discounted \nby banks which have been accep ted by another bank will be treated as a funded \nclaim on a bank.  \nIn all the above cases banks should be fully satisfied that the risk exposure is in fact on the \nother bank. If they are satisfied that the exposure is on the other bank they shall assign \nthese exposures the risk weight applicable to banks as detailed in paragraph 5.6 . \n \n(vi) Issue of Irrevocable Payment Commitment by banks to various Stock Exchanges on behalf \nof Mutual Funds and FIIs is a financial guarantee with a Credit Conversion Factor (CCF) of \n100. However, capital will have to be maintained only on exposure which is reckoned as \nCME, i.e. 50% of the amount, because the rest of the exposure is deemed to have been \ncovered by cash/securities which are admissible risk mitigants as per capital adequa cy \nframework. Thus, capital is to be maintained on the amount taken for CME and the risk \nweight would be 125% thereon.  \n \n(vii) For classification of banks guarantees56 viz. direct credit substitutes and transaction -related \ncontingent items etc. (Sr. No. 1 and 2 of  Table 8 above), the following principles should be \nkept in view for the application of CCFs:  \n(a) Financial guarantees are direct credit substitutes wherein a bank irrevocably undertakes \nto guarantee the repayment of a contractual financial obligation. Fin ancial guarantees \nessentially carry the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit i.e., the risk of loss is \ndirectly linked to the creditworthiness of the counterparty against whom a potential claim is \nacquired. An indicative list of financial guara ntees, attracting a CCF of 100 per cent is as \nunder:  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees for credit facilities;  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees in lieu of repayment of financial securities;  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees in lieu of margin requirements of exchanges;  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees for mobilisation advance, advance money b efore the commencement of \na project and for money to be received in various stages of project implementation;  \n                                                            \n55 Please refer to the circular DBR.BP.BC.No.12/21.04.048/2018 -19 dated December 5, 2018  on \u2018Guidelines on Loan \nSystem for Delivery of Bank Credit\u2019.  \n56 Please refer to the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.89 /21.04.009 /2012 -13 dated April 02, 2013  on \u2018New Capital Adequacy \nFramework - Non-market related Off Balance Sheet Items - Bank Guarantees\u2019.  53 \n \uf0b7 Guarantees towards revenue dues, taxes, duties, levies etc. in favour of Tax/ Customs \n/ Port / Excise Authorities and for disputed liabilities fo r litigation pending at courts;  \n\uf0b7 Credit Enhancements;  \n\uf0b7 Liquidity facilities for securitisation transactions;  \n\uf0b7 Acceptances (including endorsements with the character of acceptance);  \n\uf0b7 Deferred payment guarantees.  \n \n(b) Performance guarantees are essentially transaction -related contingencies that involve \nan irrevocable undertaking to pay a third party in the event the counterparty fails to fulfil or \nperform a contractual non -financial obligation. In such transactions, the risk of loss depends \non the event whic h need not necessarily be related to the creditworthiness of the \ncounterparty involved. An indicative list of performance guarantees, attracting a CCF of 50 \nper cent is as under:  \n\uf0b7 Bid bonds;  \n\uf0b7 Performance bonds and export performance guarantees;  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees in lieu of security deposits / earnest money deposits (EMD) for \nparticipating in tenders;  \n\uf0b7 Retention money guarantees;  \n\uf0b7 Warranties, indemnities and standby letters of credit related to particular transaction.  \n \n5.15.3  Treatment of Total Counterparty Credit Risk  \n5.15.3.1 The total capital charge for counterparty credit risk will cover the default risk as well as \ncredit migration risk of the counterparty reflected in mark -to-market losses on the expected \ncounterparty risk (such losses being known as credit val ue adjustments, CVA). Counterparty risk \nmay arise in the context of OTC derivatives and Securities Financing Transactions. Such \ninstruments generally exhibit the following abstract characteristics:  \n\uf0b7 The transactions generate a current exposure or market val ue. \n\uf0b7 The transactions have an associated random future market value based on market \nvariables.  \n\uf0b7 The transactions generate an exchange of payments or an exchange of a financial \ninstrument against payment.  \n\uf0b7 Collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and i s inherent in the nature of some \ntransactions.  \n\uf0b7 Short -term financing may be a primary objective in that the transactions mostly consist of \nan exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a relatively short period of \ntime, usually for the busin ess purpose of financing. The two sides of the transactions are \nnot the result of separate decisions but form an indivisible whole to accomplish a defined \nobjective.  \n\uf0b7 Netting may be used to mitigate the risk.  54 \n \uf0b7 Positions are frequently valued (most commonly o n a daily basis), according to market \nvariables.  \n\uf0b7 Remargining may be employed.  \nThe \u2018 capital charge for default risk \u2019 will be calculated using Current Exposure Method  as \nexplained in paragraph 5.15.3.5 . The \u2018 capital charge for CVA risk \u2019 will be calculated as  \nexplained in paragraph 5.15.3.6 . The Current Exposure method is applicable only to OTC \nderivatives. The counterparty risk on account of Securities Financing Transactions is covered in \nparagraph 7.3.8  of the Master Circular.  \n5.15.3.2 Exemption from capital  requirements for counterparty risk is permitted for foreign \nexchange (except gold) contracts which have an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less.  \n5.15.3.3  Definitions and general terminology  \nCounterparty Credit Risk (CCR) is the risk that the coun terparty to a transaction could default \nbefore the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss would occur if the \ntransactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive economic value at \nthe time of default. U nlike a firm\u2019s exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure to \ncredit risk is unilateral and only the lending bank faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral \nrisk of loss: the market value of the transaction can be positive or negative t o either counterparty \nto the transaction. The market value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of \nunderlying market factors.  \nSecurities Financing Transactions (SFTs)  are transactions such as repurchase agreements, \nreverse repurchase agree ments, security lending and borrowing, collateralised borrowing and \nlending (CBLO) and margin lending transactions, where the value of the transactions depends on \nmarket valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements.  \nNetting Set  is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a legally \nenforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is recognised for regulatory capital \npurposes. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable b ilateral netting \narrangement that is recognised for regulatory capital purposes should be interpreted as its own \nnetting set for the purpose of these rules.  \nHedging Set  is a group of risk positions from the transactions within a single netting set for whic h \nonly their balance is relevant for determining the exposure amount or EAD under the CCR \nstandardised method.  \nCurrent Exposure  is the larger of zero, or the market value of a transaction or portfolio of \ntransactions within a netting set with a counterpart y that would be lost upon the default of the \ncounterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in bankruptcy. Current \nexposure is often also called Replacement Cost.  55 \n Credit Valuation Adjustment  is an adjustment to the mid -market valuati on of the portfolio of \ntrades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the credit risk due to any \nfailure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. This adjustment may reflect the \nmarket value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the market value of the credit risk of both the \nbank and the counterparty.  \nOne-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment  is a credit valuation adjustment that reflects the market \nvalue of the credit risk of the counterparty to the bank , but doe s not reflect the market value of the \ncredit risk of the bank to the counterparty.  \nOutstanding EAD  for a given OTC derivative counterparty is defined as the greater of zero and \nthe difference between the sum of EADs across all netting sets with the counter party and the \ncredit valuation adjustment (CVA) for that counterparty which has already been recognised by the \nbank as an incurred write -down (i .e., a CVA loss).  \nCross -Product Netting  refers to the inclusion of transactions of different product categories  \nwithin the same netting set .  \nA central counterparty57 (CCP)  is a clearing house that interposes itself between \ncounterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every \nseller and the seller to every buyer and thereby  ensuring the future performance of open contracts. \nA CCP becomes counterparty to trades with market participants through novation, an open offer \nsystem, or another legally binding arrangement. For the purposes of the capital framework, a CCP \nis a financia l institution.  \nA qualifying central counterparty (QCCP)  is an entity that is licensed to operate as a CCP \n(including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted by the \nappropriate regulator / overseer to operate as such with resp ect to the products offered. This is \nsubject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised in a jurisdiction where \nthe relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly indicated that it applies to the CCP \non an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the CPSS -IOSCO \nPrinciples for Financial Market Infrastructures.  \nA clearing member  is a member of, or a direct participant in, a CCP that is entitled to enter into \na transaction with the CCP, regardles s of whether it enters into trades with a CCP for its own \nhedging, investment or speculative purposes or whether it also enters into trades as a financial \nintermediary between the CCP and other market participants58. \n                                                            \n57 Please refer to circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.28/21.06.201/2013 -14 dated July 2, 2013 . \n58 For the purpose of these guidelines, where a CCP has a link to a second CCP, that second CCP is to be treated as a \nclearing member of the first CCP. Whether the second CCP\u2019s collateral contribution to the first CCP is treated as \ninitial margin or a default fund contribution will depend upon the legal arrangement between the CCPs. In such \ncases, if any, RBI should be co nsulted for determining the treatment of this initial margin and default fund \ncontributions.  56 \n A client is a party to a transaction wit h a CCP through either a clearing member acting as a \nfinancial intermediary, or a clearing member guaranteeing the performance of the client to the \nCCP.  \nInitial margin  means a clearing member\u2019s or client\u2019s funded collateral posted to the CCP to \nmitigate th e potential future exposure of the CCP to the clearing member arising from the possible \nfuture change in the value of their transactions. For the purposes of these guidelines, initial margin \ndoes not include contributions to a CCP for mutualised loss shari ng arrangements (i.e. in case a \nCCP uses initial margin to mutualise losses among the clearing members, it will be treated as a \ndefault fund exposure).  \nVariation margin  means a clearing member\u2019s or client\u2019s funded collateral posted on a daily or \nintraday b asis to a CCP based upon price movements of their transactions.  \nTrade exposures  include the current59 and potential future exposure of a clearing member or a \nclient to a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange traded derivatives transactions or SFTs, \nas well as initial margin.  \nDefault funds , also known as clearing deposits or guarantee fund contributions (or any other \nnames), are clearing members\u2019 funded or unfunded contributions towards, or underwriting of, a \nCCP\u2019s mutualised loss sharing arrangements. T he description given by a CCP to its mutualised \nloss sharing arrangements is not determinative of their status as a default fund; rather, the \nsubstance of such arrangements will govern their status.  \nOffsetting transaction  means the transaction leg between the clearing member and the CCP \nwhen the clearing member acts on behalf of a client (e.g. when a clearing member clears or \nnovates a client\u2019s trade).  \n5.15.3.4  When entering into bilateral OTC derivative transactions, banks are required to hold \ncapital to p rotect against the risk that the counterparty defaults and for credit valuation adjustment \n(CVA) risk. The CVA charge is introduced as part of the Basel III framework as explained in \nparagraphs 5.15.3.5  and 5.15.3.6  below.  \n5.15.3.5  Default Risk Capital Cha rge for CCR  \nThe exposure amount for the purpose of computing for default risk capital charge for counterparty \ncredit risk will be calculated using the Current Exposure Method (CEM)  described as under:  \n(i) The credit equivalent amount of a market related off -balance sheet transaction calculated \nusing the current exposure method is the sum of current credit exposure and potential future \ncredit exposure of these contracts. For this purpose, credit equivalent amount will be \nadjusted for legally valid eligible finan cial collaterals in accordance with paragraph 7.3  \u2013 \n                                                            \n59 For the purpose of this definition, the current exposure of a clearing member includes the variation margin due to \nthe clearing member but not yet received.  57 \n Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques \u2013 Collateralised Transactions and the provisions held by \nthe bank for CVA losses.  \n(ii) The CVA loss will be calculated as a prudent valuation adjustment as per prudent valuati on \nguidance contained in paragraph 8.8.1 , without taking into account any offsetting debit \nvaluation adjustments (DVA) which have been deducted from capital (please see paragraph \n4.4.6). The CVA loss deducted from exposures to determine outstanding EAD is the CVA \nloss gross of all DVA which have been separately deducted from capital. To the extent DVA \nhas not been separately deducted from a bank\u2019s capital, the CVA loss used to determine \noutstanding EAD will be net of such DVA. Risk Weighted Assets for a giv en OTC derivative \ncounterparty may be calculated as the applicable risk weight under the Standardised or IRB \napproach multiplied by the outstanding EAD of the counterparty. This reduction of EAD by \nCVA losses does not apply to the determination of the CVA risk capital charge as per \nformula given in paragraph 5.15.3.6 (ii) . \n(iii) While computing the credit exposure banks may exclude \u2018sold options\u2019, provided the entire \npremium / fee or any other form of income is received / realised.  \n(iv) Current credit exposure is defi ned as the sum of the positive mark -to-market value of these \ncontracts. The Current Exposure Method requires periodical calculation of the current credit \nexposure by marking these contracts to market, thus capturing the current credit exposure.  \n(v) Potential f uture credit exposure is determined by multiplying the notional principal amount \nof each of these contracts irrespective of whether the contract has a zero, positive or \nnegative mark -to-market value by the relevant add -on factor indicated below according t o \nthe nature and residual maturity of the instrument.  \nTable 9: Credit Conversion Factors for Market -Related Off -Balance Sheet Items60 \n Credit Conversion Factors (%)  \nInterest Rate Contracts  Exchange Rate \nContracts and Gold  \nOne year or less  0.50 2.00 \nOver one year to five years  1.00 10.00  \nOver five years  3.00 15.00  \nNotes:  \n(a) For contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the add -on factors are to be multiplied \nby the number of remaining payments in the contract.   \n                                                            \n60 Please refer to paragraph 8.6.3 for credit default swaps  58 \n (b) For contracts that are structured to  settle outstanding exposure following specified \npayment dates and where the terms are reset such that the market value of the contract \nis zero on these specified dates, the residual maturity would be set equal to the time \nuntil the next reset date. Howeve r, in the case of interest rate contracts which have \nresidual maturities of more than one year and meet the above criteria, the CCF or add -\non factor is subject to a floor of 1.0%.  \n(c) No potential future credit exposure would be calculated for single currency floating / \nfloating interest rate swaps; the credit exposure on these contracts would be evaluated \nsolely on the basis of their mark -to-market value.  \n(d) Potential future exposures should be based on \u2018effective\u2019 rather than \u2019apparent notional \namounts\u2019. In the event that the \u2018stated notional amount\u2019 is leveraged or enhanced by the \nstructure of the transaction, banks must use the \u2018effective notional amount\u2019 when \ndetermining potential future exposure. For example, a stated notional amount of USD 1 \nmillion with pay ments based on an internal rate of two times the BPLR / Base Rate \nwould have an effective notional amount of USD 2 million.   \n(vi) When effective bilateral netting contracts as specified in Annex 20 (part B) are in place, RC \nwill be the net replacement cost and the add -on will be A Net as calculated below:  \n \n(a) Credit exposure on bilaterally netted forward transactions will be calculated as the sum of \nthe net  mark -to-market replacement cost, if positive, plus an add -on based on the notional \nunderlying principal. The a dd-on for netted transactions (A Net) will equal the weighted \naverage of the gross add -on (A Gross) and the gross add -on adjusted by the ratio of net \ncurrent replacement cost to gross current replacement cost (NGR). This is expressed \nthrough the following fo rmula:  \nANet = 0.4 \u00b7 A Gross + 0.6 \u00b7 NGR \u00b7 A Gross \nwhere:  \nNGR = level of net replacement cost  / level of gross replacement cost for \ntransactions subject to legally enforceable netting agreements61. \nAGross = sum of individual add -on amounts (calculated by multi plying the notional \nprincipal amount by the appropriate add -on factors set out in Table 9 of paragraph \n5.15.3.5 and Tables 2 0 & 21 of paragraph 8.6.3) of all transactions subject to \nlegally enforceable netting agreements with one counterparty.  \n(b) For the purp oses of calculating potential future credit exposure to a netting counterparty \nfor forward foreign exchange contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional \n                                                            \n61 Banks must calculate NGR on a counterparty by counterparty basis for all transactions that are subject to legally \nenforceable netting agreements.  59 \n \nprincipal amount is equivalent to cash flows, the notional principal is defined as the n et \nreceipts falling due on each value date in each currency. The reason for this is that \noffsetting contracts in the same currency maturing on the same date will have lower \npotential future exposure as well as lower current exposure.  \nNote : Clarifications o n certain issues raised by banks regarding Bilateral netting are furnished \nin Annex 2 5. \n5.15.3.6  Capitalisation of mark -to-market counterparty risk losses (CVA capital charge)  \n(i) In addition to the default risk capital requireme nt for counterparty credit risk, banks are \nalso required to compute an additional capital charge to cover the risk of mark -to-market \nlosses on the expected counterparty risk (such losses being known as credit value \nadjustments, CVA) to OTC derivatives. The  CVA capital charge will be calculated in the \nmanner indicated below in para (ii). Banks are not required to include in this capital charge \n(a) transactions with a central counterparty (CCP); and (b) securities financing \ntransactions (SFTs).   \n(ii) Banks should use the following formula to calculate a portfolio capital charge for CVA risk \nfor their counterparties:  \n \n \nWhere;  \n\uf0b7 h is the one -year risk horizon (in units of a year), h = 1.  \n\uf0b7 wi is the weight applicable to counterparty \u2018i\u2019. Counterparty \u2018i\u2019 should be map ped to \none of the seven weights wi based on its external rating, as shown in the Table below \nin the last bullet point.  \n\uf0b7 EAD itotal is the exposure at default of counterparty \u2018i\u2019 (summed across its netting sets) \nincluding the effect of collateral as per the existing Current Exposure Method (CEM) \nas applicable to the calculation of counterparty risk capital charges for such \ncounterparty by the bank. The exposure should be discounted by applying the factor \n(1-exp(-0.05*M i))/(0.05*M i).  \n\uf0b7 Bi is the notional of pur chased single name CDS hedges (summed if more than one \nposition) referencing counterparty \u2018i\u2019,  and used to hedge CVA risk. This notional \namount should be discounted by applying the factor (1 -exp(-0.05*M ihedge))/(0.05* \nMihedge).  60 \n \uf0b7 Bind is the full notional o f one or more index CDS of purchased protection, used to \nhedge CVA risk. This notional amount should be discounted by applying the factor (1 -\nexp(-0.05*M ind))/(0.05* M ind).  \n\uf0b7 wind is the weight applicable to index hedges. The bank must map indices to one of \nthe seven weights w i based on the average spread of index \u2018ind\u2019.  \n\uf0b7 Mi is the effective maturity of the transactions with counterparty \u2018i\u2019. Mi is the notional \nweighted average maturity of all the contracts with counterparty \u2018i\u2019.  \n\uf0b7 Mihedge is the maturity of t he hedge instrument with notional B i (the quantities M ihedge. \nBi are to be summed if these are several positions).  \n\uf0b7 Mind is the maturity of the index hedge \u2018ind\u2019. In case of more than one index hedge \nposition, it is the notional weighted average maturity.  \n\uf0b7 For any counterparty that is also a constituent of an index on which a CDS is used for \nhedging counterparty credit risk, the notional amount attributable to that single name \n(as per its reference entity weight) may be subtracted from the index CDS notiona l \namount and treated as a single name hedge (Bi) of the individual counterparty with \nmaturity based on the maturity of the index.  \n\uf0b7 The weights are given in the Table below, which are based on the external rating of \nthe counterparty:  \nWeights (w i) \nRating  Wi \nAAA 0.7%  \nAA 0.7%  \nA 0.8%  \nBBB 1.0%  \nBB 2.0%  \nB and unrated  3.0%  \nCCC  10.0%62 \n \n\uf0b7 In cases where the unrated counterparty is a scheduled commercial bank, banks shall \nuse the following Table to arrive at the implied ratings of the counterparty -bank and \nconse quently, the Wi . \n                                                            \n62 Please refer to the revised version of Basel III ca pital rules (bcbs189.doc) issued by the BCBS vide press release on \nJune 1, 2011.  61 \n Applicable Risk weight of \nthe Counterparty -bank \naccording to Table 3 of \nparagraph 5.6  Implied \nratings  Wi \n20 AAA/AA  0.7%  \n50 A 0.8%  \n100 BBB 1% \n150 BB 2% \n625 CCC  10% \n\uf0b7 Banks will have to continuously monitor the capital adequacy position of their \ncounterparty banks so that the effect of any change in the implied ratings is \nadequately reflected in CVA capital charge calculations.   \nAn illustration of CVA risk capital charge has been furnished in Annex 13 . \n5.15.3 .7 Calculation of the Aggregate CCR and CVA Risk Capital Charges  \nThe total CCR capital charge for the bank is determined as the sum of the following two \ncomponents:   \ni. The sum over all counterparties of the CEM based capital charge determined as per \npara graph 5.15.3.5 ; and  \nii. The standardised CVA risk capital charge determined as per paragraph 5.15.3.663  \n5.15.3.8  Capital requirement for exposures to Central Counterparties (CCPs)  \nScope of Application  \ni. Exposures to central counterparties arising from OTC d erivatives transactions, exchange \ntraded derivatives transactions and securities financing transactions (SFTs) will be subject \nto the counterparty credit risk treatment as indicated in this paragraph below.  \nii. Exposures arising from the settlement of cash tra nsactions (equities, fixed income, spot \nFX, commodity etc.) are not subject to this treatment. The settlement of cash transactions \nremains subject to the treatment described in paragraph 5.15.4 of this Master Circular.  \niii. When the clearing member -to-client le g of an exchange traded derivatives transaction is \nconducted under a bilateral agreement, both the client bank and the clearing member are \nto capitalise that transaction as an OTC derivative.  \n                                                            \n63 Please refer to the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.88/21.06.201/2012 -13 dated March 28, 2013  on \u2018Imp lementation of \nBasel III Capital Regulations in India \u2013 Clarifications\u2019, read with circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.81/21.06.201/2013 -14 dated \nDecember 31, 2013  in terms of which th e requirements for CVA risk capital charges would become effective as on \nApril 1, 2014.  62 \n iv. For the purpose of capital adequacy framework, CCPs will be cons idered as financial \ninstitution. Accordingly, a bank\u2019s investments in the capital of CCPs will be guided in terms \nof paragraph 4.4.9 of this Master Circular.  \nv. Capital requirements will be dependent on the nature of CCPs viz. Qualifying CCPs \n(QCCPs) and non -Qualifying CCPs. A Qualifying CCP has been defined under paragraph \n5.15.3.3 of this Master Circular.  \na. Regardless of whether a CCP is classified as a QCCP or not, a bank retains the \nresponsibility to ensure that it maintains adequate capital for its exposure s. Under \nPillar 2, a bank should consider whether it might need to hold capital in excess of the \nminimum capital requirements if, for example, (i) its dealings with a CCP give rise to \nmore risky exposures or (ii) where, given the context of that bank\u2019s dea lings, it is \nunclear that the CCP meets the definition of a QCCP.  \nb. Banks may be required to hold additional capital against their exposures to QCCPs \nvia Pillar 2, if in the opinion of RBI, it is necessary to do so. This might be considered \nappropriate where , for example, an external assessment such as an Financial Sector \nAssessment Program (FSAP) of International Monetary Fund / World Bank has found \nmaterial shortcomings in the CCP or the regulation of CCPs, and the CCP and / or \nthe CCP regulator have not si nce publicly addressed the issues identified.  \nc. Where the bank is acting as a clearing member, the bank should assess through \nappropriate scenario analysis and stress testing whether the level of capital held \nagainst exposures to a CCP adequately addresses t he inherent risks of those \ntransactions. This assessment will include potential future or contingent exposures \nresulting from future drawings on default fund commitments, and/or from secondary \ncommitments to take over or replace offsetting transactions fro m clients of another \nclearing member in case of this clearing member defaulting or becoming insolvent.  \nd. A bank must monitor and report to senior management and the appropriate committee \nof the Board (e.g. , Risk Management Committee) on a regular basis (quar terly or at \nmore frequent intervals) all of its exposures to CCPs, including exposures arising from \ntrading through a CCP and exposures arising from CCP membership obligations such \nas default fund contributions.  \ne. Unless Reserve Bank ( DOR ) requires otherwise , the trades with a former QCCP may \ncontinue to be capitalised as though they are with a QCCP for a period not exceeding \nthree months from the date it ceases to qualify as a QCCP. After that time, the bank\u2019s \nexposures with such a central counterparty must be capitalised according to rules \napplicable for non -QCCP.  \n 63 \n 5.15.3.9  Exposures to Qualifying CCPs (QCCPs)  \n(i) Trade exposures  \nClearing member exposures to QCCPs  \n(a) Where a bank acts as a clearing member of a QCCP for its own purposes, a risk weight \nof 2% must be applied to the bank\u2019s trade exposure to the QCCP in respect of OTC \nderivatives transactions, exchange traded derivatives transactions and SFTs .  \n(b) The exposure amount for such trade exposure will be calculated in accordance with the \nCurrent Exp osure Method (CEM) for derivatives and rules as applicable for capital \nadequacy for Repo / Reverse Repo -style transactions64.  \n(c) Where settlement is legally enforceable on a net basis in an event of default and \nregardless of whether the counterparty is in solvent or bankrupt, the total replacement cost \nof all contracts relevant to the trade exposure determination can be calculated as a net \nreplacement cost if the applicable close -out netting sets meet the requirements set out in \nAnnex 20  of these guidelines .  \n(d) Banks will have to demonstrate that the conditions mentioned in Annex 20  are fulfilled on \na regular basis by obtaining independent and reasoned legal opinion as regards legal \ncertainty of n etting of exposures to QCCPs. Banks may also obtain from the QCCPs, the \nlegal opinion taken by the respective QCCPs on the legal certainty of their major activities \nsuch as settlement finality, netting, collateral arrangements (including margin \narrangement s); default procedures etc .  \nClearing member exposures to clients  \nThe clearing member will always capitalise its exposure (including potential CVA65 risk exposure) \nto clients as bilateral trades, irrespective of whether the clearing member guarantees the t rade or \nacts as an intermediary between the client and the QCCP. However, to recognize the shorter \nclose -out period for cleared transactions, clearing members can capitalize the exposure to their \nclients by multiplying the EAD by a scalar which is not less  than 0.71.   \nClient bank exposures to clearing member  \nI. Where a bank is a client of the clearing member, and enters into a transaction with the \nclearing member acting as a financial intermediary (i.e. , the clearing member completes \nan offsetting transacti on with a QCCP), the client\u2019s exposures to the clearing member will \n                                                            \n64 Please refer to paragraph 7.3.8 of this Master Circular.  \n65 Please refer to Guidelines on Implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India - Clarifications ( Circular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.88/21.06.201/2012 -13 dated March 28, 2013  read with circular \nDBOD. No.BP.BC.81/21.06.201/2013 -14 dated December 31, 2013 ) in terms of which CVA risk capital charges would \nbecome effective as on April 1, 2014.  64 \n receive the treatment applicable to the paragraph \u201cclearing member exposure to QCCPs\u201d \nof this section (mentioned above), if following conditions are met:   \n(a) The offsetting transactions a re identified by the QCCP as client transactions and collateral \nto support them is held by the QCCP and / or the clearing member, as applicable, under \narrangements that prevent any losses to the client due to:  \n(i) the default or insolvency of the clearing  member;  \n(ii) the default or insolvency of the clearing member\u2019s other clients; and  \n(iii) the joint default or insolvency of the clearing member and any of its other clients.  \nThe client bank must  obtain an independent, written and reasoned legal opinion  that concludes \nthat, in the event of legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find \nthat the client would bear no losses on account of the insolvency of an intermediary under the \nrelevant law, including:  \n\uf0b7 the law(s) applica ble to client bank, clearing member and QCCP;  \n\uf0b7 the law of the jurisdiction(s) of the foreign countries in which the client bank, clearing \nmember or QCCP are located  \n\uf0b7 the law that governs the individual transactions and collateral; and  \n\uf0b7 the law that governs  any contract or agreement necessary to meet this condition (a).  \n(b) Relevant laws, regulations, rules, contractual, or administrative arrangements provide that \nthe offsetting transactions with the defaulted or insolvent clearing member are highly likely \nto continue to be indirectly transacted through the QCCP, or by the QCCP, should the \nclearing member default or become insolvent. In such circumstances, the client positions \nand collateral with the QCCP will be transferred at the market value unless the cl ient \nrequests to close out the position at the market value. In this context, it may be clarified \nthat if relevant laws, regulations, rules, contractual or administrative agreements provide \nthat trades are highly likely to be ported, this condition can be considered to be met. If \nthere is a clear precedent for transactions being ported at a QCCP and intention of the \nparticipants is to continue this practice, then these factors should be considered while \nassessing if trades are highly likely to be ported. Th e fact that QCCP documentation does \nnot prohibit client trades from being ported is not sufficient to conclude that they are highly \nlikely to be ported. Other evidence such as the criteria mentioned in this paragraph is \nnecessary to make this claim .  \nII. Where a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearing member and \nanother client of the clearing member jointly default or become jointly insolvent, but all 65 \n other conditions mentioned above are met and the concerned CCP is a QCCP, a risk \nweight of 4% will apply to the client\u2019s exposure to the clearing member .  \nIII. Where the client bank does not meet the requirements in the above paragraphs, the bank \nwill be required to capitalize its exposure (including potential CVA risk exposure) to the  \nclearing member as a bilateral trade .  \nIV. Under situations in which a client enters into a transaction with the QCCP with a clearing \nmember guaranteeing its performance, the capital requirements will be based on \nparagraph 5 of this Master Circular . \nTreat ment of posted collateral  \n(a) In all cases, any assets or collateral posted must, from the perspective of the bank posting \nsuch collateral, receive the risk weights that otherwise applies to such assets or collateral \nunder the capital adequacy framework, rega rdless of the fact that such assets have been \nposted as collateral. Thus collateral posted from Banking Book will receive Banking Book \ntreatment and collateral posted from Trading Book will receive Trading Book treatment. \nWhere assets or collateral of a cl earing member or client are posted with a QCCP or a \nclearing member and are not held in a bankruptcy remote manner, the bank posting such \nassets or collateral must also recognise credit risk based upon the assets or collateral \nbeing exposed to risk of loss  based on the creditworthiness of the entity66 holding such \nassets or collateral.   \n(b) Collateral posted by the clearing member (including cash, securities, other pledged \nassets, and excess initial or variation margin, also called over -collateralisation ), that is \nheld by a custodian67, and is bankruptcy remote from the QCCP, is not subject to a capital \nrequirement for counterparty credit risk exposure to such bankruptcy remote custodian .  \n(c) Collateral posted by a client, that is held by a custodian, and is bankrupt cy remote from \nthe QCCP, the clearing member and other clients, is not subject to a capital requirement \nfor counterparty credit risk. If the collateral is held at the QCCP on a client\u2019s behalf and is \nnot held on a bankruptcy remote basis, a 2% risk weight will be applied to the collateral if \nthe conditions established in paragraph on \u201cclient bank exposures to clearing members\u201d \nof this section are met (mentioned above). A risk weight of 4% will be made applicable if \na client is not protected from losses in t he case that the clearing member and another \n                                                            \n66 Where the entity holding such assets or collateral is the QCCP, a risk -weight of 2% applies to collateral inclu ded in \nthe definition of trade exposures. The relevant risk -weight of the QCCP will apply to assets or collateral posted for \nother purposes  \n67 In this paragraph, the word \u201ccustodian\u201d may include a trustee, agent, pledgee, secured creditor or any other \nperso n that holds property in a way that does not give such person a beneficial interest in such property and will not \nresult in such property being subject to legally -enforceable claims by such persons, creditors, or to a court -ordered \nstay of the return of su ch property, should such person become insolvent or bankrupt.  66 \n client of the clearing member jointly default or become jointly insolvent, but all other \nconditions mentioned in paragraph on \u201cclient bank exposures to clearing members\u201d of this \nsection are met .  \n(d) If a clearing m ember collects collateral from a client for client cleared trades and this \ncollateral is passed on to the QCCP, the clearing member may recognize this collateral \nfor both the QCCP - clearing member leg and the clearing member - client leg of the client \ncleared trade. Therefore, initial margins (IMs) as posted by clients to clearing members \nmitigate the exposure the clearing member has against these clients .  \n(ii)  Default Fund Exposures to QCCPs  \n(a) Where a default fund is shared between products or types of b usiness with settlement risk \nonly (e.g. , equities and bonds) and products or types of business which give rise to \ncounterparty credit risk i.e., OTC derivatives, exchange traded derivatives or SFTs, all of \nthe default fund contributions will receive the ri sk weight determined according to the \nformulae and methodology set forth below, without apportioning to different classes or \ntypes of business or products .  \n(b) However, where the default fund contributions from clearing members are segregated by \nproduct types  and only accessible for specific product types, the capital requirements for \nthose default fund exposures determined according to the formulae and methodology set \nforth below must be calculated for each specific product giving rise to counterparty credit \nrisk. In case the QCCP\u2019s prefunded own resources are shared among product types, the \nQCCP will have to allocate those funds to each of the calculations, in proportion to the \nrespective product specific exposure i.e. , EAD.  \n(c) Clearing member banks are required  to capitalise their exposures arising from default fund \ncontributions to a qualifying CCP by applying the following formula :  \n\uf0b7 Clearing member banks may apply a risk -weight of 1250% to their default fund \nexposures to the qualifying CCP, subject to an overa ll cap on the risk -weighted assets \nfrom all its exposures to the QCCP (i.e. , including trade exposures) equal to 20% of the \ntrade exposures to the QCCP. More specifically, the Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) for \nboth bank i\u2019s trade and default fund exp osures to  each QCCP are equal to68:  \nMin {(2% * TE i + 1250% * DF i); (20% * TE i)}  \nWhere;  \nTEi is bank i\u2019s trade exposure to the QCCP; and  \nDF i is bank i's pre -funded contribution to the QCCP's default fund.  \n                                                            \n68 The 2% risk weight on trade exposures does not apply additionally, as it is included in the equation.  67 \n 5.15.3.10 Exposures to Non -qualifying CCPs  \n(a) Banks must  apply the Standardised Approach for credit risk according to the category of \nthe counterparty, to their trade exposure to a non -qualifying CCP69.  \n(b) Banks must apply a risk weight of 1250% to their default fund contributions to a non -\nqualifying CCP .  \n(c) For the purposes of this paragraph, the default fund contributions of such banks will \ninclude both the funded and the unfunded contributions which are liable to be paid should \nthe CCP so require. Where there is a liability for unfunded contributions (i.e.  unlimited \nbinding commitments) the Reserve Bank will determine in its Pillar 2 assessments the \namount of unfunded commitments to which 1250% risk weight should apply . \n5.15.4  Failed Transactions   \n(i) With regard to unsettled securities and foreign exchange  transactions, banks are exposed \nto counterparty credit risk from trade date, irrespective of the booking or the accounting of \nthe transaction. Banks are encouraged to develop, implement and improve systems for \ntracking and monitoring the credit risk expos ure arising from unsettled transactions as \nappropriate for producing management information that facilitates action on a timely basis .  \n(ii) Banks must closely monitor securities and foreign exchange transactions that have failed, \nstarting from the day the y fail for producing management information that facilitates action \non a timely basis. Failed transactions give rise to risk of delayed settlement or delivery .  \n(iii) Failure of transactions settled through a delivery -versus -payment system (DvP), providing  \nsimultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose banks to a risk of loss on the \ndifference between the transaction valued at the agreed settlement price and the \ntransaction valued at current market price (i.e. , positive current exposure). Failed \ntransactions where cash is paid without receipt of the corresponding receivable (securities, \nforeign currencies, or gold,) or, conversely, deliverables were delivered without receipt of \nthe corresponding cash payment (non -DvP, or free delivery) expose banks to  a risk of loss \non the full amount of cash paid or deliverables delivered. Therefore, a capital charge is \nrequired for failed transactions and must be calculated as under. The following capital \ntreatment is applicable to all failed transactions, including transactions through recognised \nclearing houses and Central Counterparties. Repurchase and reverse -repurchase \nagreements as well as securities lending and borrowing that have failed to settle are \nexcluded from this capital treatment .  \n                                                            \n69 In cases where a CCP is to be considered as non -QCCP and the exposure is to be reckoned on CCP, the applicable \nrisk weight will be according to the ratings assigned to the CCPs.  68 \n (iii) For DvP Transactions \u2013 If the payments have not yet taken place five business days \nafter the settlement date, banks are required to calculate a capital charge by multiplying \nthe positive current exposure of the transaction by the appropriate factor as under. In order \nto captur e the information, banks will need to  upgrade their information systems in order \nto track the number of days after the agreed settlement date and calculate the \ncorresponding capital charge.  \nNumber of working days \nafter the agreed settlement \ndate Correspond ing risk \nmultiplier  \n(in per cent)  \nFrom 5 to 15  9 \nFrom 16 to 30  50 \nFrom 31 to 45  75 \n46 or more  100 \n(v) For non -DvP transactions (free deliveries) after the first contractual payment / delivery leg, \nthe bank that has made the payment will treat its expo sure as a loan if the second leg has not \nbeen received by the end of the business day. If the dates when two payment legs are made are \nthe same according to the time zones where each payment is made, it is deemed that they are \nsettled on the same day. For example, if a bank in Tokyo transfers Yen on day X (Japan Standard \nTime) and receives corresponding US Dollar via CHIPS on day X (US Eastern Standard Time), \nthe settlement is deemed to take place on the same value date. Banks shall compute the capital \nrequirement using the counterparty risk weights prescribed in these guidelines. However, if five \nbusiness days after the second contractual payment / delivery date the second leg has not yet \neffectively taken place, the bank that has made the first payment leg  will receive a risk weight of \n1250% on the full amount of the value transferred plus replacement cost, if any. This treatment \nwill apply until the second payment / delivery leg is effectively made.  \n5.16 Securitisation Exposures The treatment of securitisa tion exposures for capital adequacy \nhas been specified in the Master Direction \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Securitisation of Standard \nAssets) Directions, 202170. \n5.17 Capital Adequacy Requirement for Credit Default Swap (CDS) Positions in the \nBanking Book  \n5.17.1 Recognition of External / Third -party CDS Hedges  \n5.17.1.1  In case of Banking Book positions hedged by bought CDS positions, no exposure \nwill be reckoned against the reference entity / underlying asset in respect of the hedged exposure, \n                                                            \n70 Master Direction no. DOR.STR.REC.53/21.04.177/2021 -22 dated September 24, 2021 . 69 \n and exposure wil l be deemed to have been substituted by the protection seller, if the following \nconditions are satisfied:  \n(a) Operational requirements mentioned in paragraph 4 of circular  \nDBOD.BP.BC.No.61/21.06.203/2011 -12 dated November 30, 2011  on Prudential \nGuidelines on Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are met (refer to Annex 7  of these \nguidelines );  \n(b) The risk weight applicable to the protection seller under the Standardised Approach for \ncredit risk is lower than that of the underlying asset; and  \n(c) There is no maturity mismatch between the underlying asset and the reference / \ndeliverable obligation. If this condition is not satisfied, then the amount of cre dit protection \nto be recognised should be computed as indicated in paragraph 5.17.1.3 (ii) below.  \n5.17.1.2  If the conditions 5.17.1.1 (a) and (b) above are not satisfied or the bank breaches \nany of these conditions subsequently, the bank shall reckon the exposure on the underlying asset; \nand the CDS position will be transferred to Trading Book where it will be subject to specific risk, \ncounterparty credit risk and general market risk (wherever applicable) capital requirements as \napplicable to Trading Book.   \n5.17.1.3  The unprotected portion of the underlying exposure should be risk -weighted as \napplicable under the Standardised Approach for credit risk. The amount of credit protection shall \nbe adjusted if there are any mismatches between the underlying asset/  obligation and the \nreference / deliverable asset / obligation with regard to asset or maturity. These are dealt with in \ndetail in the following paragraphs.  \n(i) Asset Mismatches: Asset mismatch will arise if the underlying asset is different from the \nreference asset or deliverable obligation. Protection will be reckoned as available by the \nprotection buyer only if the mismatched assets meet the requirements that (1) the reference \nobligation or deliverable obligation ranks pari passu with or is junior to th e underlying obligation, \nand (2) the underlying obligation and reference obligation or deliverable obligation share the same \nobligor (i.e. , the same legal entity) and legally enforceable cross -default or cross -acceleration \nclauses are in place.  \n(ii) Matur ity Mismatches: The protection buyer would be eligible to reckon the amount of \nprotection if the maturity of the credit derivative contract were to be equal or more than the maturity \nof the underlying asset. If, however, the maturity of the CDS contract is  less than the maturity of \nthe underlying asset, then it would be construed as a maturity mismatch. In case of maturity \nmismatch the amount of protection will be determined in the following manner:  \na. If the residual maturity of the credit derivative prod uct is less than three months no \nprotection will be recognized.  70 \n b. If the residual maturity of the credit derivative contract is three months or more \nprotection proportional to the period for which it is available will be recognised.  \nWhen there is a matu rity mismatch the following adjustment will be applied.  \nPa = P x (t - 0.25) \u00f7 (T - 0.25)  \nWhere:  \nPa = value of the credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch  \nP = credit protection  \nt = min (T, residual maturity of the credit protection arrangement ) expressed in years  \nT = min (5, residual maturity of the underlying exposure) expressed in years  \nExample: Suppose the underlying asset is a corporate bond of Face Value of Rs.100 \nwhere the residual maturity is of 5 years and the residual maturity of the  CDS is 4 \nyears. The amount of credit protection is computed as under:  \n100 * {(4 - 0.25) \u00f7 (5 - 0.25)} = 100*(3.75\u00f7 4.75) = 78.95  \nc. Once the residual maturity of the CDS contract reaches three months , protection \nceases to be recognised.  \n5.17.2  Internal Hedges  \nBanks can use CDS contracts to hedge against the credit risk in their existing corporate bonds \nportfolios. A bank can hedge a Banking Book credit risk exposure either by an internal hedge (the \nprotection purchased from the trading desk of the bank and held in the Trading Book) or an \nexternal hedge (protection purchased from an eligible third party protection provider). When a \nbank hedges a Banking Book credit risk exposure (corporate bonds) using a CDS booked in its \nTrading Book (i.e. , using an inte rnal hedge), the Banking Book exposure is not deemed to be \nhedged for capital purposes unless the bank transfers the credit risk from the Trading Book to an \neligible third party protection provider through a CDS meeting the requirements of paragraph \n5.17 vis-\u00e0-vis the Banking Book exposure. Where such third party protection is purchased and is \nrecognised as a hedge of a Banking Book exposure for regulatory capital purposes, no capital is \nrequired to be maintained on internal and external CDS hedge. In such cases, the external CDS \nwill act as indirect hedge for the Banking Book exposure and the capital adequacy in terms of \nparagraph 5.17 , as applicable for external/ third party hedges, will be applicable .  \n \n \n 71 \n 6. External Credit Assessments  \n6.1 Eligible Credi t Rating Agencies  \n6.1.1  Reserve Bank has undertaken the detailed process of identifying the eligible credit rating \nagencies, whose ratings may be used by banks for assigning risk weights for credit risk. In line \nwith the provisions of the Revised Framewor k71, where the facility provided by the bank possesses \nrating assigned by an eligible credit rating agency, the risk weight of the claim will be based on \nthis rating.  \n6.1.2  In accordance with the principles laid down in the Revised Framework, the Reserve B ank \nof India has decided that banks may use the ratings of the following domestic credit rating \nagencies (arranged in alphabetical order) for the purposes of risk weighting their claims for capital \nadequacy purposes:  \n(a) Acuite Ratings & Research Limited (Acuite)72 \n(b) Brickwork Ratings India Pvt. Limited (Brickwork);  \n(c) Credit Analysis and Research Limited  (CARE) ;  \n(d) CRISIL Ratings Limited73;  \n(e) ICRA Limited;  \n(f) India Ratings and Research Private Limited (India Ratings); and \n(g) INFOMERICS Valuation  and Rating Pvt Ltd. (INFOMERICS)74 \n  \n6.1.3   The Reserve Bank of India has decided that banks may use the ratings of  the following \ninternational credit rating agencies (arranged in alphabetical order) for the purposes of risk \nweighting their claims for ca pital adequacy purposes where specified:  \na. Fitch;  \nb. Moody's; and  \nc. Standard & Poor\u2019s  \n6.2 Scope of Application of External Ratings  \n6.2.1  Banks should use the chosen credit rating agencies and their ratings consistently for each \ntype of claim, for bo th risk weighting and risk management purposes. Banks will not be allowed \nto \u201ccherry pick\u201d the assessments provided by different credit rating agencies and to arbitrarily \nchange the use of credit rating agencies. If a bank has decided to use the ratings of  some of the \nchosen credit rating agencies for a given type of claim, it can use only the ratings of those credit \n                                                            \n71 Please refer to the Document \u2018International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards\u2019 (June \n2006) released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  \n72 Please refer to circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.59/21.06.007/2013 -14 dated October 17, 2013 . \n73 Please refer to circular DOR.No.CRE.BC.33/21.06.007/2020 -21 dated January 27, 2021 . \n74 Please refer to circular DBR.No.BP.BC.74/21.06.009/2016 -17 dated June 13, 2017 . The rating -risk weight mapping \nfor the long term and short term ratings assigned by IN FOMERICS will be the same as in case of other rating agencies.  72 \n rating agencies, despite the fact that some of these claims may be rated by other chosen credit \nrating agencies whose ratings the bank has dec ided not to use. Banks shall not use one agency\u2019s \nrating for one corporate bond, while using another agency\u2019s rating for another exposure to the \nsame counterparty, unless the respective exposures are rated by only one of the chosen credit \nrating agencies, whose ratings the bank has decided to use. External assessments for one entity \nwithin a corporate group cannot be used to risk weight other entities within the same group .  \n6.2.2  Banks must disclose the names of the credit rating agencies that they use for  the risk \nweighting of their assets, the risk weights associated with the particular rating grades as \ndetermined by Reserve Bank through the mapping process for each eligible credit rating agency \nas well as the aggregated risk weighted assets as required v ide Table DF -4 of Annex 18 .  \n6.2.3  To be eligible for risk -weighting purposes, the external credit assessment must take into \naccount and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure the bank has with regard to all \npayments owed to it. For example, if a bank is owed both principal and interest, the assessment \nmust fully take into account and reflect the credit risk associated with timely repayment of both \nprincipal and interest.  \n6.2.4  To be eligible for risk weighting purposes, the rating should be in force and confirmed from \nthe monthly bulletin of the concerned rating agency. The rating agency should have reviewed the \nrating at least once during the previous 15 months.  \n6.2.5  An eligible credit assessment must be publicly available. In other words, a  rating must be \npublished in an accessible form and included in the external credit rating agency\u2019s transition \nmatrix. Consequently, ratings that are made available only to the parties to a transaction do not \nsatisfy this requirement.  \n6.2.6  For assets in the bank\u2019s portfolio that have contractual maturity less than or equal to one \nyear, short term ratings accorded by the chosen credit rating agencies would be relevant. For \nother assets which have a contractual maturity of more than one year, long term rati ngs accorded \nby the chosen credit rating agencies would be relevant.  \n6.2.7  Cash credit exposures tend to be generally rolled over and also tend to be drawn on an \naverage for a major portion of the sanctioned limits. Hence, even though a cash credit exposu re \nmay be sanctioned for period of one year or less, these exposures should be reckoned as long \nterm exposures and accordingly the long term ratings accorded by the chosen credit rating \nagencies will be relevant. Similarly, banks may use long -term ratings of a counterparty as a proxy \nfor an unrated short - term exposure on the same counterparty subject to strict compliance with \nthe requirements for use of multiple rating assessments and applicability of issue rating to issuer \n/ other claims as indicated in paragraphs 6.4, 6.5, 6.7 and 6.8 below.  \n \n 73 \n 6.3 Mapping Process  \nThe Revised Framework recommends development of a mapping process to assign the ratings \nissued by eligible credit rating agencies to the risk weights available under the Standardised risk \nweigh ting framework. The mapping process is required to result in a risk weight assignment \nconsistent with that of the level of credit risk. A mapping of the credit ratings awarded by the \nchosen domestic credit rating agencies has been furnished below in paragr aphs 6.4.1 and 6.5.4 , \nwhich should be used by banks in assigning risk weights to the various exposures.  \n6.4 Long Term Ratings  \n6.4.1  On the basis of the above factors as well as the data made available by the rating \nagencies, the ratings issued by the cho sen domestic credit rating agencies have been mapped to \nthe appropriate risk weights applicable as per the Standardised approach under the Revised \nFramework. The rating -risk weight mapping furnished in the Table 1 0 below shall be adopted by \nall banks in In dia: \nTable 1 0: Risk Weight Mapping of Long Term Ratings of the chosen Domestic Rating \nAgencies  \nCARE  CRISIL  Ratings \nLimited  India Ratings  ICRA  Brickwork  Acuit e  Infomerics  Standardised \napproach risk \nweights  \n(in per cent)  \nCARE AAA  CRISIL AAA  IND AAA  ICRA A AA Brickwork AAA  Acuit\u00e9 AAA  IVR AAA  20 \nCARE AA  CRISIL AA  IND AA  ICRA AA  Brickwork AA  Acuit\u00e9 AA  IVR AA  30 \nCARE A  CRISIL A  IND A  ICRA A  Brickwork A  Acuit\u00e9 A  IVR A  50 \nCARE BBB  CRISIL BBB  IND BBB  ICRA BBB  Brickwork BBB  Acuit\u00e9 BBB  IVR BBB  100 \nCARE BB, \nCARE B, \nCARE C &  \nCARE D  CRISIL BB, \nCRISIL B, \nCRISIL C &  \nCRISIL D  IND BB, IND B, \nIND C & IND D  ICRA BB, \nICRA B, ICRA \nC & \nICRA D  Brickwork BB, \nBrickwork B, \nBrickwork C &  \nBrickwork D  Acuit\u00e9 BB, Acuit\u00e9 \nB, Acuit\u00e9  C & \nAcuit\u00e9 D  IVR BB, IVR B, \nIVR C & IVR D  150 \nUnrate d Unrated  Unrated  Unrated  Unrated  Unrated  Unrated  100 $  \n $ The risk weight is 150% in the following two cases:  \n\uf0b7 if the aggregate exposure from banking system is more than INR 200 crore  \n\uf0b7 if the aggregate exposure from banking system is more than INR 100 cro re for exposures which were rated \nearlier and subsequently have become unrated.  \n \n6.4.2 Where \u201c+\u201d or \u201c -\u201d notation is attached to the rating, the corresponding main rating category \nrisk weight should be used. For example, A+ or A - would be considered to be in the A rating \ncategory and assigned 50 per cent risk weight.  \n6.4.3 If an issuer has a long -term exposure with an external long term rating that warrants a risk \nweight of 150 per cent, all unrated claims on the same counter -party, whether short -term or l ong-74 \n term, should also receive a 150 per cent risk weight, unless the bank uses recognised credit risk \nmitigation techniques for such claims.  \n6.5 Short Term Ratings  \n6.5.1 For risk -weighting purposes, short -term ratings are deemed to be issue -specific. The y can \nonly be used to derive risk weights for claims arising from the rated facility. They cannot be \ngeneralised to other short -term claims. In no event can a short -term rating be used to support a \nrisk weight for an unrated long -term claim. Short -term ass essments may only be used for short -\nterm claims against banks and corporates.  \n6.5.2 Notwithstanding the above restriction on using an issue specific short term rating for other \nshort term exposures, the following broad principles will apply. The unrated s hort term claim on \ncounterparty will attract a risk weight of at least one level higher than the risk weight applicable to \nthe rated short term claim on that counter -party. If a short -term rated facility to counterparty \nattracts a 20 per cent or a 50 per c ent risk -weight, unrated short -term claims to the same counter -\nparty cannot attract a risk weight lower than 30 per cent or 100 per cent respectively.  \n6.5.3 Similarly, if an issuer has a short -term exposure with an external short term rating that \nwarrants  a risk weight of 150 per cent, all unrated claims on the same counter -party, whether \nlong-term or short -term, should also receive a 150 per cent risk weight, unless the bank uses \nrecognised credit risk mitigation techniques for such claims.  \n6.5.4 In resp ect of the issue specific short term ratings the following risk weight mapping shall be \nadopted by banks:  \nTable 1 1: Risk Weight Mapping of Short Term Ratings of Domestic Rating Agencies  \nCARE  CRISIL  Ratings \nLimited  India \nRatings  ICRA  Brickwork  Acuit e Infome rics Standardised approach \nrisk weights  \n(in per cent)  \nCARE \nA1+ CRISIL A1+  IND A1+  ICRA \nA1+ Brickwork \nA1+ Acuit\u00e9  \nA1+ IVR A1+  20 \nCARE A1  CRISIL A1  IND A1  ICRA A1  Brickwork A1  Acuit\u00e9 A1  IVR A1  30 \nCARE A2  CRISIL A2  IND A2  ICRA A2  Brickwork A2  Acuit\u00e9  A2 IVR A2 50 \nCARE A3  CRISIL A3  IND A3  ICRA A3  Brickwork A3  Acuit\u00e9 A3  IVR A3  100 \nCARE A4  \n& D CRISIL A4  \n& D IND A4 & \nD ICRA A4  \n& D Brickwork A4  \n& D Acuit\u00e9  A4 \n& D IVR A4 and \nD 150 \nUnrated  Unrated  Unrated  Unrated  Unrated  Unrated  Unrated  100 $  \n $ The risk weight i s 150% in the following two cases:  \n\uf0b7 if the aggregate exposure from banking system is more than INR 200 crore  \n\uf0b7 if the aggregate exposure from banking system is more than INR 100 crore for exposures which \nwere rated earlier and subsequently have become unrate d. \n 75 \n 6.5.5 Where \u201c+\u201d or \u201c -\u201d notation is attached to the rating, the corresponding main rating category \nrisk weight should be used for A2 and below, unless specified otherwise. For example, A2+ or \nA2- would be considered to be in the A2 rating category and assigned 50 per cent risk weight.  \n6.5.6 The above risk weight mapping of both long term and short term ratings of the chosen \ndomestic rating agencies would be reviewed annually by the Reserve Bank.  \n6.6 Use of Unsolicited Ratings  \nA rating would be treate d as solicited only if the issuer of the instrument has requested the credit \nrating agency for the rating and has accepted the rating assigned by the agency. As a general \nrule, banks should use only solicited rating from the chosen credit rating agencies. No ratings \nissued by the credit rating agencies on an unsolicited basis should be considered for risk weight \ncalculation as per the Standardised Approach.  \n6.7 Use of Multiple Rating Assessments  \nBanks shall be guided by the following in respect of exposur es / obligors having multiple ratings \nfrom the chosen credit rating agencies chosen by the bank for the purpose of risk weight \ncalculation:  \n(i) If there is only one rating by a chosen credit rating agency for a particular claim, that \nrating would be used to d etermine the risk weight of the claim.  \n(ii) If there are two ratings accorded by chosen credit rating agencies that map into \ndifferent risk weights, the higher risk weight should be applied.  \n(iii) If there are three or more ratings accorded by chosen credit r ating agencies with \ndifferent risk weights, the ratings corresponding to the two lowest risk weights should \nbe referred to and the higher of those two risk weights should be applied. i.e., the \nsecond lowest risk weight.  \n6.8 Applicability of \u2018Issue Rating\u2019  to issuer/ other claims  \n6.8.1  Where a bank invests in a particular issue that has an issue specific rating by a chosen \ncredit rating agency the risk weight of the claim will be based on this assessment. Where the \nbank\u2019s claim is not an investment in a sp ecific assessed issue, the following general principles \nwill apply:  \n(i) In circumstances where the borrower has a specific assessment for an issued debt - \nbut the bank\u2019s claim is not an investment in this particular debt - the rating applicable \nto the spe cific debt (where the rating maps into a risk weight lower than that which \napplies to an unrated claim) may be applied to the bank\u2019s unassessed claim only if \nthis claim ranks pari passu or senior to the specific rated debt in all respects and the 76 \n maturity of the unassessed claim is not later than the maturity of the rated claim75, \nexcept where the rated claim is a short term obligation as specified in paragraph 6.5.2. \nIf not, the rating applicable to the specific debt cannot be used and the unassessed \nclaim will receive the risk weight for unrated claims.  \n(ii) In circumstances where the borrower has an issuer assessment, this assessment \ntypically applies to senior unsecured claims on that issuer. Consequently, only senior \nclaims on that issuer will benefit f rom a high quality issuer assessment. Other \nunassessed claims of a highly assessed issuer will be treated as unrated. If either the \nissuer or a single issue has a low quality assessment (mapping into a risk weight \nequal to or higher than that which applies  to unrated claims), an unassessed claim on \nthe same counterparty that ranks pari -passu or is subordinated to either the senior \nunsecured issuer assessment or the exposure assessment will be assigned the same \nrisk weight as is applicable to the low quality  assessment.  \n(iii) Where a bank intends to extend an issuer or an issue specific rating assigned by a \nchosen credit rating agency to any other exposure which the bank has on the same \ncounterparty and which meets the above criterion, it should be extended to the entire \namount of credit risk exposure the bank has with regard to that exposure i.e., both \nprincipal and interest.  \n(iv) With a view to avoiding any double counting of credit enhancement factors, no \nrecognition of credit risk mitigation techniques s hould be taken into account if the \ncredit enhancement is already reflected in the issue specific rating accorded by a \nchosen credit rating agency relied upon by the bank.  \n(v) Where unrated exposures are risk weighted based on the rating of an equivalent \nexposure to that borrower, the general rule is that foreign currency ratings would be \nused only for exposures in foreign currency.  \n6.8.2  If the conditions indicated in paragraph 6.8.1 above are not satisfied, the rating applicable \nto the specific debt cann ot be used and the claims on NABARD/SIDBI/NHB76 on account of \ndeposits placed in lieu of shortfall in achievement of priority sector lending targets/sub -targets \nshall be risk weighted as applicable for unrated claims, i.e. , 100%.  \n                                                            \n75In a case where a short term claim on a counterparty is rated as A1+ and a long term claim on the same \ncounterparty is rated as AAA, then a bank may assign a 30 per cent risk weight to an unra ted short term claim and \n20 per cent risk weight to an unrated long term claim on that counterparty where the seniority of the claim ranks \npari-passu with the rated claims and the maturity of the unrated claim is not later than the rated claim. In a simila r \ncase where a short term claim is rated A1+ and a long term claim is rated A, the bank may assign 50 per cent risk \nweight to an unrated short term or long term claim  \n76 Please refer to the circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.103/21.06.001/2012 -13 dated June 20, 2013  on \u2018Risk Weights on \nDeposits Placed with NABARD / SIDBI / NHB in lieu of Shortfall in Achievement of Priority Sector Lending Targets / \nSub-targets\u2019.  77 \n 7. Credit Risk Mitigation  \n7.1 General Principles  \n7.1.1  Banks use a number of techniques to mitigate the credit risks to which they are exposed. \nFor example, exposures may be collateralised in whole or in part by cash or securities, deposits \nfrom the same counterparty, guarantee of  a third party, etc. Credit risk mitigation approach as \ndetailed in this section is applicable to the banking book exposures. This will also be applicable \nfor calculation of the counterparty risk charges for OTC derivatives and repo -style transactions \nbook ed in the trading book.  \n7.1.2  The general principles applicable to use of credit risk mitigation techniques are as under:  \n(i) No transaction in which Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) techniques are used should receive \na higher capital requirement than an oth erwise identical transaction where such \ntechniques are not used.  \n(ii) The effects of CRM will not be double counted. Therefore, no additional supervisory \nrecognition of CRM for regulatory capital purposes will be granted on claims for which \nan issue -speci fic rating is used that already reflects that CRM.  \n(iii) Principal -only ratings will not be allowed within the CRM framework.  \n(iv)  While the use of CRM techniques reduces or transfers credit risk, it simultaneously may \nincrease other risks (residual ris ks). Residual risks include legal, operational, liquidity \nand market risks. Therefore, it is imperative that banks employ robust procedures and \nprocesses to control these risks, including strategy; consideration of the underlying \ncredit; valuation; policie s and procedures; systems; control of roll -off risks; and \nmanagement of concentration risk arising from the bank\u2019s use of CRM techniques and \nits interaction with the bank\u2019s overall credit risk profile. Where these risks are not \nadequately controlled, Reser ve Bank may impose additional capital charges or take \nother supervisory actions. The disclosure requirements prescribed in Table DF -5 of \nAnnex 18  must also be observed for banks to obtain capital relief in respect of any CRM \ntechniques.  \n7.2  Legal Certain ty  \nIn order for banks to obtain capital relief for any use of CRM techniques, the following minimum \nstandards for legal documentation must be met. All documentation used in collateralised \ntransactions and guarantees must be binding on all parties and lega lly enforceable in all relevant \njurisdictions. Banks must have conducted sufficient legal review, which should be well \ndocumented, to verify this requirement. Such verification should have a well -founded legal basis \nfor reaching the conclusion about the bi nding nature and enforceability of the documents. Banks \nshould also undertake such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability.  78 \n 7.3 Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques - Collateralised Transactions  \n7.3.1  A Collateralised Transaction is one in which:  \n(i) banks have a credit exposure and that credit exposure is hedged in whole or in part by \ncollateral posted by a counterparty or by a third party on behalf of the counterparty. Here, \n\u201ccounterparty\u201d is used to denote a party to whom a bank h as an on - or off -balance sheet \ncredit exposure.  \n(ii) banks have a specific lien on the collateral and the requirements of legal certainty are \nmet.  \n7.3.2  Overall framework and minimum conditions  \nThe framework allows banks to adopt either the simple appro ach, which, similar to the 1988 \nAccord, substitutes the risk weighting of the collateral for the risk weighting of the counterparty for \nthe collateralised portion of the exposure (generally subject to a 20 per cent floor), or the \ncomprehensive approach, wh ich allows fuller offset of collateral against exposures, by effectively \nreducing the exposure amount by the value ascribed to the collateral. Banks in India shall adopt \nthe Comprehensive Approach, which allows fuller offset of collateral against exposures , by \neffectively reducing the exposure amount by the value ascribed to the collateral. Under this \napproach, banks, which take eligible financial collateral (e.g., cash or securities, more specifically \ndefined below), are allowed to reduce their credit expo sure to a counterparty when calculating \ntheir capital requirements to take account of the risk mitigating effect of the collateral. Credit risk \nmitigation is allowed only on an account -by-account basis, even within regulatory retail portfolio. \nHowever, bef ore capital relief will be granted the standards set out below must be met:  \n(i) In addition to the general requirements for legal certainty, the legal mechanism by which \ncollateral is pledged or transferred must ensure that the bank has the right to liqui date or \ntake legal possession of it, in a timely manner, in the event of the default, insolvency or \nbankruptcy (or one or more otherwise -defined credit events set out in the transaction \ndocumentation) of the counterparty (and, where applicable, of the cust odian holding the \ncollateral). Furthermore , banks must take all steps necessary to fulfill those requirements \nunder the law applicable to the bank\u2019s interest in the collateral for obtaining and \nmaintaining an enforceable security interest, e.g. , by registe ring it with a registrar.  \n(ii) In order for collateral to provide protection, the credit quality of the counterparty and the \nvalue of the collateral must not have a material positive correlation. For example, \nsecurities issued by the counterparty - or by any related group entity - would provide little \nprotection and so would be ineligible.  \n(iii) Banks must have clear and robust procedures for the timely liquidation of collateral to \nensure that any legal conditions required for declaring the default of the  counterparty and \nliquidating the collateral are observed, and that collateral can be liquidated promptly.  79 \n (iv) Where the collateral is held by a custodian, banks must take reasonable steps to ensure \nthat the custodian segregates the collateral from its o wn assets.  \n(v) Banks must ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to the orderly operation of \nmargin agreements with OTC derivative and securities -financing counterparties banks, \nas measured by the timeliness and accuracy of its outgoing calls and re sponse time to \nincoming calls. Banks must have collateral management policies in place to control, \nmonitor and report the following to the Board or one of its Committees:  \n\uf0b7 the risk to which margin agreements exposes them (such as the volatility and \nliquidi ty of the securities exchanged as collateral),  \n\uf0b7 the concentration risk to particular types of collateral,  \n\uf0b7 the reuse of collateral (both cash and non -cash) including the potential liquidity \nshortfalls resulting from the reuse of collateral received from co unterparties, and  \n\uf0b7 the surrender of rights on collateral posted to counterparties.  \n7.3.3  A capital requirement will be applied to a bank on either side of the collateralised \ntransaction: for example, both repos and reverse repos will be subject to capital  requirements. \nLikewise, both sides of securities lending and borrowing transactions will be subject to explicit \ncapital charges, as will the posting of securities in connection with a derivative exposure or other \nborrowing.  \n7.3.4  The Comprehensive Approa ch  \n(i)  In the comprehensive approach, when taking collateral, banks will need to calculate their \nadjusted exposure to a counterparty for capital adequacy purposes in order to take \naccount of the effects of that collateral. Banks are required to adjust bo th the amount of \nthe exposure to the counterparty and the value of any collateral received in support of \nthat counterparty to take account of possible future fluctuations in the value of either, \noccasioned by market movements. These adjustments are referre d to as \u2018haircuts\u2019. The \napplication of haircuts will produce volatility adjusted amounts for both exposure and \ncollateral. The volatility adjusted amount for the exposure will be higher than the \nexposure and the volatility adjusted amount for the collatera l will be lower than the \ncollateral, unless either side of the transaction is cash. In other words, the \u2018haircut\u2019 for \nthe exposure will be a premium factor and the \u2018haircut\u2019 for the collateral will be a discount \nfactor. It may be noted that the purpose und erlying the application of haircut is to capture \nthe market -related volatility inherent in the value of exposures as well as of the eligible \nfinancial collaterals. Since the value of credit exposures acquired by banks in the course \nof their banking operati ons, would not be subject to market volatility, (since the loan \ndisbursal / investment would be a \u201ccash\u201d transaction) though the value of eligible financial \ncollateral would be, the haircut stipulated in Table -12 (paragraph 7.3.7) would apply in 80 \n respect of  credit transactions only to the eligible collateral but not to the credit exposure \nof the bank. On the other hand, exposures of banks, arising out of repo -style transactions \nwould require upward adjustment for volatility, as the value of security sold/len t/pledged \nin the repo transaction, would be subject to market volatility. Hence, such exposures \nshall attract haircut.  \n(ii) Additionally , where the exposure and collateral are held in different currencies an \nadditional downwards adjustment must be made to  the volatility adjusted collateral \namount to take account of possible future fluctuations in exchange rates.  \n(iii) Where the volatility -adjusted exposure amount is greater than the volatility -adjusted \ncollateral amount (including any further adjustment f or foreign exchange risk), banks \nshall calculate their risk -weighted assets as the difference between the two multiplied by \nthe risk weight of the counterparty. The framework for performing calculations of capital \nrequirement is indicated in paragraph 7.3. 6.  \n7.3.5  Eligible Financial Collateral  \nThe following collateral instruments are eligible for recognition in the comprehensive approach:  \n(i) Cash  (as well as certificates of deposit or comparable instruments, including fixed \ndeposit receipts, issued by t he lending bank) on deposit with the bank which is incurring \nthe counterparty exposure.  \n(ii) Gold : Gold would include both bullion and jewellery. However, the value of the \ncollateralised jewellery should be arrived at after notionally converting these to 99.99 \npurity.  \n(iii) Securities  issued by Central and State Governments  \n(iv) Kisan Vikas Patra  and National Savings Certificates provided no lock -in period is \noperational and if they can be encashed within the holding period.  \n(v) Life insurance  policies with a declared surrender value of an insurance company which \nis regulated by an insurance sector regulator.  \n(vi) Debt securities  rated by a chosen Credit Rating Agency in respect of which banks should \nbe sufficiently confident about the market liquidity77 where these are either:  \n                                                            \n77 A debenture would meet the  test of liquidity if it is traded on a recognised stock exchange(s) on at least 90 per \ncent of the trading days during the preceding 365 days. Further, liquidity can be evidenced in the trading during the \nprevious one month in the recognised stock exchang e if there are a minimum of 25 trades of marketable lots in \nsecurities of each issuer.  81 \n (a) Attracting 100 per cent or lesser risk weight i.e., rated at least BBB( -) when \nissued by public sector entities and other entities (including banks and Primary \nDealers); or  \n(b) Attracting 100 per cent or lesser risk weight i. e., rated at least CARE A3/ CRISIL \nA3/ India Ratings and Research Private Limited (India Ratings) A3/ICRA \nA3/Brickwork A3/ Acuite A3/ IVR A3  for short -term debt instruments.  \n(vii) Debt Securities not rated by a chosen Credit Rating Agency in respect of wh ich banks \nshould be sufficiently confident about the market liquidity where these are:  \n(a) issued by a bank; and  \n(b) listed on a recognised exchange; and  \n(c) classified as senior debt; and  \n(d) all rated issues of the same seniority by the issui ng bank are rated at least BBB \n(-) or CARE A3/ CRISIL A3/ India Ratings and Research Private Limited (India \nRatings) A3/ICRA A3/Brickwork A3/ Acuite A3/ IVR A3  by a chosen Credit Rating \nAgency; and  \n(e) the bank holding the securities as collateral has no informati on to suggest that \nthe issue justifies a rating below BBB( -) or CARE A3/ CRISIL A3/ India Ratings \nand Research Private Limited (India Ratings) A3/ICRA A3/Brickwork A3/ Acuite \nA3/ IVR A3  (as applicable) and;  \n(f) Banks should be sufficiently confident about the market liquidity of the security.  \n(viii) Units of Mutual Funds regulated by the securities regulator of the jurisdiction of the bank\u2019s \noperation mutual funds where:  \n(a) a price for the units is publicly quoted daily i.e., where the daily NAV is avail able \nin public domain; and  \n(b) Mutual fund is limited to investing in the instruments listed in this paragraph.  \n(ix) Re-securitisations, irrespective of any credit ratings, are not eligible financial collateral.  \n(x) For foreign bank branches, cash/unencu mbered approved securities, the source of \nwhich is interest -free funds from Head Office or remittable surplus retained in Indian \nbooks, held with RBI under section 11(2)(b)(i) of the Banking Regulation Act,1949 may \nbe reckoned as CRM, for offsetting the gr oss exposure of the foreign bank branches in \nIndia to the Head Office (including overseas branches), subject to the conditions \nprescribed in the circular no. DOR.CRE.REC.4 7/21.01.003/2021 -22 dated September \n09, 2021  on \u2018Large Exposures Framework \u2013 Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) for offsetting 82 \n \u2013 non-centrally cleared derivative transactions of foreign bank branches in India with their \nHead Office\u201978. \n7.3.6  Calculation of capit al requirement  \nFor a collateralised transaction, the exposure amount after risk mitigation is calculated as follows:  \nE* = max {0, [E x (1 + H e) - C x (1 - Hc - Hfx)]} \nwhere:  \nE* = the exposure value after risk mitigation  \nE = current value of the exposure for which the collateral qualifies as a risk mitigant  \nHe = haircut appropriate to the exposure  \nC = the current value of the collateral received  \nHc = haircut appropriate to the collateral  \nHfx = haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the colla teral and exposure  \nThe exposure amount after risk mitigation (i.e., E*) will be multiplied by the risk weight of the \ncounterparty to obtain the risk -weighted asset amount for the collateralised transaction. Illustrative \nexamples calculating the effect of C redit Risk Mitigation is furnished in Annex 8 .  \n7.3.7  Haircuts  \n(i) In principle, banks have two ways of calculating the haircuts: (i) standard supervisory \nhaircuts, using parameters set by the Basel Committee, and (ii) own -estimate haircuts, \nusing banks\u2019 own internal estimates of market price volatility. Banks in India shall use only \nthe standard supervisory haircuts for both the exposure as well as the collateral.  \n(ii) The Standard Supervisory Haircuts (assuming daily mark -to-market, daily re -margining \nand a 10 business -day holding period)79, expressed as percentages, would be as \nfurnished in Table 1 2.  \n(iii) The ratings indicated in Table 1 2 represent the ratings assigned by the domestic rating \nagencies. In the case of exposures toward debt securities iss ued by foreign Central \nGovernments and foreign corporates, the haircut may be based on ratings of the \ninternational rating agencies, as indicated in Table 1 3.  \n                                                            \n78 As mentioned in the referenced circular, the amount so held shall not be included in regulatory capital. (i.e., no \ndouble counting of the fund placed under Section 11( 2) as both capital and CRM). Accordingly, while assessing the \ncapital adequacy of a bank, the amount will form part of regulatory adjustments made to Common Equity Tier 1 \nCapital.  \n79 Holding period will be the time normally required by the bank to realise t he value of the collateral.  83 \n (iv) Sovereign will include Reserve Bank of India  and DICGC  which are eligible for zero per \ncent risk weight. Guarantees issued by CGTMSE, CRGFTLIH and individual schemes \nunder National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd. (NCGTC) which are backed by \nexplicit Central Government Guarantee shall also be  included under Sovereign .  \n(v) Banks may apply a  zero haircut for eligible collateral where it is a National Savings \nCertificate, Kisan Vikas Patras, surrender value of insurance policies and banks\u2019 own \ndeposits.  \n(vi) The standard supervisory haircut for currency risk where exposure and collateral are \ndenominated in different currencies is eight per cent (also based on a 10 -business day \nholding period and daily mark -to-market).  \nTable 1 2: Standard Supervisory Haircuts for Sovereign and other securities which \nconstitute Exposure and Collateral  \nSl.

(Since, at present, the repos are allowed only in the \ncase of Government securities, banks are not likely to have any exposure which will attract \nthe provisions of this clause. However, this would be relevant, if in future, repos/security \nlending transactions are permitted in the case of unrated corporate securities).  \n(viii) Where the collateral is a basket of assets, the haircut on the basket will be,  \n \nwhere a i is the weight of the asset (as measured by the amount /value of the asset in units \nof currency) in the basket and Hi , the haircut applicable to that asset.  \n(ix) Adjustment for different holding periods:  \nFor some transactions, depending on the nature and frequency of the revaluation and \nremargining provision s, different holding periods (other than 10 business -days) are \nappropriate. The framework for collateral haircuts distinguishes between repo -style \ntransactions (i.e. , repo/reverse repos and securities lending/borrowing), \u201cother capital -\nmarket -driven transa ctions\u201d (i.e. , OTC derivatives transactions and margin lending) and \nsecured lending. In capital -market -driven transactions and repo -style transactions, the \n85 \n documentation contains remargining clauses; in secured lending transactions, it generally \ndoes not. In view of different holding periods, in the case of these transactions, the \nminimum holding period shall be taken as indicated below:  \n \nTransaction type  Minimum holding Period  Condition  \nRepo -style transaction  five business days  daily remargining  \nOther ca pital market \ntransactions  ten business days  daily remargining  \nSecured lending  twenty business days  daily revaluation  \n \nThe haircut for the transactions with other than 10 business -days minimum holding period, \nas indicated above, will have to be adjusted b y scaling up/down the haircut for 10 \nbusiness \u2013days indicated in the Table 1 2, as per the formula given in paragraph 7.3.7 (xi) \nbelow.  \n(x) Adjustment for non -daily mark -to-market or remargining:  \nIn case a transaction has margining frequency different from  daily margining assumed, the \napplicable haircut for the transaction will also need to be adjusted by using the formula \ngiven in paragraph 7.3.7 (xi) below.  \n(xi) Formula for adjustment for different holding periods and / or non -daily mark -to-market or \nremargining:  \nAdjustment for the variation in holding period and margining / mark -to-market, as indicated \nin paragraph (ix) and (x) above will be done as per the following formula:  \n \nWhere;  \nH = haircut  \nH10 = 10-business -day standard supervisory haircut for instrument  \nNR = actual number of business days between remargining for capital market \ntransactions or revaluation for secured transactions.  \nTM = minimum holding period for the type of transaction  \n7.3.8  Capital Adequacy Framework for Repo -/Reverse Repo -style transactions.  \n7.3.8.1  The repo -style transactions also attract capital charge for Counterparty credit risk (CCR), \nin addition to the credit risk and market risk. The CCR is defined as the risk of default by the \n86 \n counterparty in a repo -style transaction , resulting in non -delivery of the security lent/pledged/sold \nor non -repayment of the cash.  \nA. Treatment in the books of the borrower of funds:  \n(i) Where a bank has borrowed funds by selling / lending or posting, as collateral, of \nsecurities, the \u2018Exposu re\u2019 will be an off -balance sheet exposure equal to the 'market \nvalue' of the securities sold/lent as scaled up after applying appropriate haircut. For \nthe purpose, the haircut as per Table 1 2 would be used as the basis which should \nbe applied by using the formula in paragraph 7.3.7 (xi), to reflect minimum \n(prescribed) holding period of five business -days for repo -style transactions and \nthe variations, if any, in the frequency of re -margining, from the daily margining \nassumed for the standard supervisory ha ircut. The 'off -balance sheet exposure' will \nbe converted into 'on -balance sheet' equivalent by applying a credit conversion \nfactor of 100 per cent, as per item 5 in Table 8 (paragraph 5.15).  \n(ii) The amount of money received will be treated as collateral  for the securities \nlent/sold/pledged. Since the collateral is cash, the haircut for it would be zero.  \n(iii) The credit equivalent amount arrived at (i) above, net of amount of cash collateral, \nwill attract a risk weight as applicable to the counterparty.   \n(iv) As the securities will come back to the books of the borrowing bank after the repo \nperiod, it will continue to maintain the capital for the credit risk in the securities in \nthe cases where the securities involved in repo are held under HTM category,  and \ncapital for market risk in cases where the securities are held under AFS/HFT \ncategories. The capital charge for credit risk / specific risk would be determined \naccording to the credit rating of the issuer of the security. In the case of \nGovernment sec urities, the capital charge for credit / specific risk will be 'zero'.  \nB. Treatment in the books of the lender of funds:  \n(i) The amount lent will be treated as on -balance sheet/funded exposure on the \ncounter party, collateralised by the securities accept ed under the repo.  \n(ii) The exposure, being cash, will receive a zero haircut.  \n(iii) The collateral will be adjusted downwards/marked down as per applicable haircut.  \n(iv) The amount of exposure reduced by the adjusted amount of collateral, will receive \na risk weight as applicable to the counterparty, as it is an on - balance sheet \nexposure.  87 \n (v) The lending bank will not maintain any capital charge for the security received by \nit as collateral during the repo period, since such collateral does not enter i ts \nbalance sheet but is only held as a bailee.  \n7.3.8.2  The formula in paragraph 7.3.6 will be adapted as follows to calculate the capital \nrequirements for transactions with bilateral netting agreements. The bilateral netting agreements \nmust meet the requi rements set out in Annex 20 (part A) of these guidelines.  \nE* = max {0, [(\u03a3(E) \u2013 \u03a3(C)) + \u03a3 (Es x Hs) +\u03a3(Efx x Hfx)]}  \nwhere:  \nE* = the exposure value after risk mitigation  \nE = current value of the exposure  \nC = the value of the collateral received  \nEs = absolute value of the net position in a given security  \nHs = hairc ut appropriate to Es  \nEfx = absolute value of the net position in a currency different from the settlement  \ncurrency  \nHfx = haircut appropriate for currency  mismatch   \nThe intention here is to obtain a net exposure amount after netting of the exposures and col lateral \nand have an add -on amount reflecting possible price changes for the securities involved in the \ntransactions and for foreign exchange risk if any. The net long or short position of each security \nincluded in the netting agreement will be multiplied b y the appropriate haircut. All other rules \nregarding the calculation of haircuts stated in paragraphs 7.3.6 -7.3.7 equivalently apply for banks  \nusing bilateral netting agreements for repo -style transactions.  \n \n7.3.9  Collateralised OTC derivatives transaction s \nThe calculation of the counterparty credit risk charge for an individual contract will be as follows:  \ncounterparty charge = [(RC + add -on) \u2013 CA] x r x 9%  \nwhere:  \nRC = the replacement cost,  \nadd-on = the amount for potential future exposure calculated accor ding to paragraph \n5.15.3.5,  \nCA = the volatility adjusted collateral amount under the comprehensive approach prescribed \nin paragraphs 7.3.6 - 7.3.7 or zero if no eligible collateral is applied to the transaction, and  \nr = the risk weight of the counterparty.  \nWhen effective bilateral netting contracts are in place, RC will be the net replacement cost and \nthe add -on will be A Net as calculated according to Annex 20 (part B) and paragraph 5.15.3.5. The \nhaircut for currency risk (H fx) should be applied when there i s a mismatch between the collateral 88 \n currency and the settlement currency. Even in the case where there are more than two currencies \ninvolved in the exposure, collateral and settlement currency, a single haircut assuming a 10 - \nbusiness day holding period sc aled up as necessary depending on the frequency of mark -to-\nmarket will be applied.  \n \n7.4 Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques \u2013 On-Balance Sheet Netting  \nOn-balance sheet netting is confined to loans/advances and deposits, where banks have legally \nenforceable n etting arrangements, involving specific lien with proof of documentation. They may \ncalculate capital requirements on the basis of net credit exposures subject to the following \nconditions:  \nWhere a bank,  \n(a) has a well -founded legal basis for concluding th at the netting or offsetting agreement \nis enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction regardless of whether the counterparty is \ninsolvent or bankrupt;  \n(b) is able at any time to determine the loans/advances and deposits withthe same \ncounterparty that are su bject to the netting agreement;  \n(c) monitors and controls the relevant exposures on a net basis; and  \n(d) monitors and controls its roll -off risks.  \nit may use the net exposure of loans/advances and deposits as the basis for its capital adequacy \ncalculati on in accordance with the formula in paragraph 7.3.6 . Loans/advances are treated as \nexposure and deposits as collateral. The haircuts will be zero except when a currency mismatch \nexists. All the requirements contained in paragraph 7.3.6 and 7.6 will also a pply.  \n7.5  Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques - Guarantees  \n7.5.1  Where guarantees are direct, explicit, irrev ocable and unconditional banks may  take \naccount of such credit protection in calculating capital requirements.  \n7.5.2  A range of guarantors are re cognised  and a substitution approach will be applied. Thus , \nonly guarantees issued by entities with a lower risk weight than the counterparty will lead to \nreduced capital charges since the protected portion of the counterparty exposure is assigned the \nrisk weight of the guarantor, whereas the uncovered portion retains the risk weight of the \nunderlying counterparty.  \n7.5.3  Detailed operational requirements for guarantees eligible for being treated as a CRM are \nas under:  \n 89 \n 7.5.4  Operational requirements for g uarantees  \n(i) A guarantee (counter -guarantee) must represent a direct claim on the protection provider \nand must be explicitly referenced to specific exposures or a pool of exposures, so that the \nextent of the cover is clearly defined and incontrovertible.  The guarantee must be \nirrevocable; there must be no clause in the contract that would allow the protection \nprovider unilaterally to cancel the cover or that would increase the effective cost of cover \nas a result of deteriorating credit quality in the guar anteed exposure. The guarantee must \nalso be unconditional; there should be no clause in the guarantee outside the direct control \nof the bank that could prevent the protection provider from being obliged to pay out in a \ntimely manner in the event that the o riginal counterparty fails to make the payment(s) due.  \n(ii) All exposures will be risk weighted after taking into account risk mitigation available in the \nform of guarantees. When a guaranteed exposure is classified as non -performing, the \nguarantee will c ease to be a credit risk mitigant and no adjustment would be permissible \non account of credit risk mitigation in the form of guarantees. The entire outstanding, net \nof specific provision and net of realisable value of eligible collaterals / credit risk mit igants, \nwill attract the appropriate risk weight.  \n7.5.5  Additional operational requirements for guarantees  \nIn addition to the legal certainty requirements in paragraph 7.2 above, in order for a guarantee \nto be recognised, the following conditions must be satisfied:  \n(i)  On the qualifying default/non -payment of the counterparty, the bank is able in a timely \nmanner to pursue the guarantor for any monies outstanding under the documentation \ngoverning the transaction. The guarantor shall make one lump sum paym ent of all monies \nunder such documentation to the bank, or the guarantor shall assume the future payment \nobligations of the counterparty covered by the guarantee. The bank must have the right to \nreceive any such payments from the guarantor without first ha ving to take legal actions in \norder to pursue the counterparty for payment.  \n(ii) The guarantee is an explicitly documented obligation assumed by the guarantor.  \n(iii) Except as noted in the following sentence, the guarantee covers all types of payments th e \nunderlying obligor is expected to make under the documentation governing the \ntransaction, for example notional amount, margin payments etc. Where a guarantee \ncovers payment of principal only, interests and other uncovered payments should be \ntreated as an  unsecured amount in accordance with paragraph 7.5.8.  \n \n \n 90 \n 7.5.6  Range of Eligible Guarantors (Counter -Guarantors)  \nCredit protection given by the following entities will be recognised:  \n(i) Sovereigns, sovereign entities (including BIS, IMF, European Centra l Bank and European \nCommunity as well as those MDBs referred to in paragraph 5.5 , ECGC and CGTSI, \nCRGFTLIH, individual schemes under NCGTC which are backed by explicit Central \nGovernment Guarantee), banks and primary dealers with a lower risk weight than t he \ncounterparty.  \n(ii) Other entities that are externally rated except when credit protection is provided to a \nsecuritisation exposure. This would include credit protection provided by parent, \nsubsidiary and affiliate companies when they have a lower risk weight than the obligor.  \n(iii) When credit protection is provided to a securitisation exposure, other entities that currently \nare externally rated BBB - or better and that were externally rated A - or better at the time \nthe credit protection was provided. T his would include credit protection provided by parent, \nsubsidiary and affiliate companies when they have a lower risk weight than the obligor.  \n(iv) In case of securitisation transactions, SPEs cannot be recognised as eligible guarantors.  \n7.5.7  Risk Weigh ts  \n7.5.7.1  The protected portion is assigned the risk weight of the protection provider. Exposures \ncovered by State Government guarantees will attract a risk weight of 20 per cent. The uncovered \nportion of the exposure is assigned the risk weight of the u nderlying counterparty  subject to \nconditions stipulated in paragraph 7.5.7.2 .  \n7.5.7.2  As per para 7.13 of Circular No.DBR.No.BP.BC.43/21.01.003/2018 -19 dated June 03, \n2019 on Large Exposures Framework, any CRM instrument from which CRM benefits like shifting \nof exposure/ risk weights etc. are not derived may not be counted as an exposure on the CRM \nprovider. In case of non -fund based credit facilities provided to a person  resident outside India \nwhere CRM benefits are not derived and the exposure is shifted to the non -resident person, such \nexposures to the non -resident person shall attract a minimum risk weight of 150%.  \n7.5.8  Proportional Cover  \nWhere the amount guaranteed,  or against which credit protection is held, is less than the amount \nof the exposure, and the secured and unsecured portions are of equal seniority, i.e. the bank and \nthe guarantor share losses on a pro -rata basis capital relief will be afforded on a propo rtional \nbasis: i.e. the protected portion of the exposure will receive the treatment applicable to eligible \nguarantees, with the remainder treated as unsecured.  \n \n 91 \n 7.5.9  Currency Mismatches  \nWhere the credit protection is denominated in a currency different  from that in which the exposure \nis denominated \u2013 i.e., there is a currency mismatch \u2013 the amount of the exposure deemed to be \nprotected will be reduced by the application of a haircut H FX, i.e.,  \nGA = G x (1 - HFX)  \nWhere;  \nG = nominal amount of the credit  protection  \nHFX = haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the credit protection and \nunderlying obligation.  \nBanks using the supervisory haircuts will apply a haircut of eight per cent for currency mismatch.  \n7.5.10 Sovereign Guarantees and Count er-Guarantees  \nA claim may be covered by a guarantee that is indirectly counter -guaranteed by a sovereign. Such \na claim shall be treated as covered by a sovereign guarantee provided that:  \n(i) the sovereign counter -guarantee covers all credit risk elements  of the claim;  \n(ii) both the original guarantee and the counter -guarantee meet all operational \nrequirements for guarantees, except that the counter -guarantee need not be direct \nand explicit to the original claim; and  \n(iii) the cover should be robust and no historical evidence suggests that the coverage of \nthe counter -guarantee is less than effectively equivalent to that of a direct sovereign \nguarantee.  \n7.5.11  ECGC Guaranteed Exposures :  \nUnder the Export Credit insurance81 for banks on Whole Turnover Basis,  the guarantee/insurance \ncover given by ECGC for export credit exposures of the banks ranges between 50% and 75% for \npre-shipment credit and 50% to 85% in case of post -shipment credit. However, the ECGC\u2019s total \nliability on account of default by the export ers is capped by an amount specified as Maximum \nLiability (ML). In this context, it is clarified that risk weight (as given in para 5.2.3 of this Master \nCircular ) applicable to the claims on ECGC should be capped to the ML amount specified in the \nwhole tur nover policy of the ECGC. The banks are required to proportionately distribute the ECGC \nmaximum liability amount to all individual export credits that are covered by the ECGC Policy. For \nthe covered portion of individual export credits, the banks shall app ly the risk weight applicable to \nclaims on ECGC. For the remaining portion of individual export credit, the banks shall apply the \n                                                            \n81 DBOD Mailbox Clarification dated October 18, 2013.  92 \n risk weight as per the rating of the counter -party.

Where there is a \nmaturity mismatch and the CRM has an original maturity of less than one year, the CRM is not \nrecognised for capital purposes. In other cases where there is a maturity mismatch, partial \nrecognition is given to the CRM for regulatory capital purposes as detailed below in paragraphs \n7.6.2 to 7.6.4. In case of loans collateralised by the bank\u2019s own deposits, even if the tenor of such \ndeposits is less than three months or deposits have maturity mismatch vis -\u00e0-vis the tenor of the \nloan, the provisions of paragraph 7.6.1 regarding derecognition of collateral would not be attracted \nprovided an explicit consent of the depositor has been obtained from the depositor (i.e. borrower) \nfor adjusting the ma turity proceeds of such deposits against the outstanding loan or for renewal \nof such deposits till the full repayment of the underlying loan.  \n1.1.1.  \n7.6.2  Definition of Maturity  \nThe maturity of the underlying exposure and the maturity of the collateral should both be defined \nconservatively. The effective maturity of the underlying should be gauged as the longest possible \nremaining time before the counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its obligation, taking into account any \napplicable grace period. For the collateral, embedded options which may reduce the term of the \ncollateral should be taken into account so that the shortest possible effective maturity is used. \nThe maturity relevant here is the residual maturity.  \n \n93 \n 7.6.3  Risk Weights for Maturity Mismatche s  \nAs outlined in paragraph 7.6.1, collateral with maturity mismatches are only recognised when their \noriginal maturities are greater than or equal to one year. As a result, the maturity of collateral for \nexposures with original maturities of less than one  year must be matched to be recognised. In all \ncases, collateral with maturity mismatches will no longer be recognised when they have a residual \nmaturity of three months or less.  \n7.6.4  When there is a maturity mismatch with recognised credit risk mitigant s (collateral, on -\nbalance sheet netting and guarantees) the following adjustment will be applied:  \nPa = P x ( t - 0.25 ) \u00f7 ( T - 0.25)  \nwhere:  \nPa = value of the credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch  \nP = credit protection (e.g. collateral amount, guarantee amount) adjusted for any \nhaircuts  \nt = min (T, residual maturity of the credit protection arrangement) expressed in years  \nT = min (5, residual maturity of the exposure) expressed in years  \n7.7 Treatment of pools of CRM Techniques  \nIn the case wh ere a bank has multiple CRM techniques covering a single exposure (e.g. , a bank \nhas both collateral and guarantee partially covering an exposure), the bank will be required to \nsubdivide the exposure into portions covered by each type of CRM technique (e.g. , portion \ncovered by collateral, portion covered by guarantee) and the risk -weighted assets of each portion \nmust be calculated separately. When credit protection provided by a single protection provider \nhas differing maturities, they must be subdivided int o separate protection as well.  \n \n8. Capital Charge for Market Risk  \n8.1 Introduction  \nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses in on -balance sheet and off -balance sheet positions \narising from movements in market prices. The market risk positions subject t o capital charge \nrequirement are:  \n(i) The risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments and equities in the trading book; \nand \n(ii) Foreign exchange risk (including open position in precious metals) throughout the bank \n(both banking and trading book s). 94 \n 8.2 Scope and Coverage of Capital Charge for Market Risks  \n8.2.1  These guideline s seek to address the issues involved in computing capital charges for \ninterest rate related instruments in the trading book, equities in the trading book and foreign \nexchan ge risk (including gold and other precious metals) in both trading and banking books. \nTrading book for the purpose of capital adequacy will include:  \n(i) Securities included under the Held for Trading category  \n(ii) Securities included under the Available for Sale ca tegory  \n(iii) Open gold position limits  \n(iv) Open foreign exchange position limits  \n(v) Trading positions in derivatives, and  \n(vi) Derivatives entered into for hedging trading book exposures.  \n8.2.2 Banks are required to manage the market risks in their books on an ongoing basis  and \nensure that the capital requirements for market risks are being maintained on a continuous basis, \ni.e., at the close of each business day. Banks are also required to maintain strict risk management \nsystems to monitor and control intra -day exposures to  market risks.  \n8.2.3  Capital for market risk would not be relevant for securities, which have already matured \nand remai n unpaid. These securities will attract capital only for credit risk. On completion of 90 \ndays delinquency, these will be treated on par with NPAs for deciding the appropriate risk weights \nfor credit risk.  \n8.3 Measurement of Capital Charge for Interest Rate Risk  \n8.3.1  This section describes the framework for measuring the risk of holding or taking positions \nin debt securities and other inte rest rate related instruments in the trading book . \n8.3.2  The capital charge for interest rate related instruments would apply to current market value \nof these items in bank's trading book. Since banks are required to maintain capital for market risks \non an  ongoing basis, they are required to mark to market their trading positions on a daily basis. \nThe current market value will be determined as per extant RBI guidelines on valuation of \ninvestments . \n8.3.3 The minimum capital requirement is expressed in terms of two separately calculated \ncharges, (i) \" specific risk \" charge for each security, which is designed to protect against an \nadverse movement in the price of an individual security owing to factors related to the individual \nissuer, both for short (short pos ition is not allowed in India except in derivatives and Central \nGovernment Securities) and long positions, and (ii) \" general market risk \" charge towards interest \nrate risk in the portfolio, where long and short positions (which is not allowed in India exce pt in \nderivatives and Central Government Securities) in different securities or instruments can be offset.  95 \n 8.3.4 For the debt securities held under AFS category, in view of the possible longer holding \nperiod and attendant higher specific risk, the banks sh all hold total capital charge for market risk \nequal to greater of (a) or (b) below:  \n(a) Specific risk capital charge, computed notionally for the AFS securities treating them as \nheld under HFT category (as computed according to Table  14: Part A / C / E(i) / F / G, \nas applicable) plus the General Market Risk Capital Charge.  \n(b) Alternative total capital charge for the AFS category computed notionally treating them \nas held in the banking book (as computed in accordance with Table 1 4: Part B / D / E(ii) \n/ F / H, as applicable)  \nA. Specific Risk  \n8.3.5  The capital charge for specific risk is designed to protect against an adverse movement in \nthe price of an individual security owing to factors related to the individual issuer.

General M arket Risk  \n8.3.7  The capital requirements for general market risk are designed to capture the risk of loss \narising from changes in market interest rates. The capital charge is the sum of four components:  \n(i) the net short (short position is not allowed in India except in derivatives and Central \nGovernment Securities) or long position in the whole trading book;  \n(ii) a small proportion of the matched positions in each time -band (the \u201cvertical \ndisallowance\u201d);  \n(iii) a larger proportion of the matched positions across different time -bands (the \u201chorizontal \ndisallowance\u201d), and  103 \n (iv) a net charge for positions in options, where appropriate.  \n8.3.8  Separate maturity ladders should be used for each currency and capital charges should \nbe calculated for each currency sepa rately and then summed with no offsetting between positions \nof opposite sign. In the case of those currencies in which business is insignificant (where the \nturnover in the respective currency is less than 5 per cent of overall foreign exchange turnover), \nseparate calculations for each currency are not required. The bank may, instead, slot within each \nappropriate time -band, the net long or short position for each currency. However, these individual \nnet positions are to be summed within each time -band, irresp ective of whether they are long or \nshort positions, to produce a gross position figure. The gross positions in each time -band will be \nsubject to the assumed change in yield set out in Table -16 with no further offsets.  \n8.3.9  The Basel Committee has suggeste d two broad methodologies for computation of capital \ncharge for market risks. One is the standardised method and the other is the banks\u2019 internal risk \nmanagement models method. As banks in India are still in a nascent stage of developing internal \nrisk mana gement models, it has been decided that, to start with, banks may adopt the \nstandardised method. Under the standardised method there are two principal methods of \nmeasuring market risk, a \u201cmaturity\u201d method and a \u201cduration\u201d method. As \u201cduration\u201d method is a \nmore accurate method of measuring interest rate risk, it has been decided to adopt standardised \nduration method to arrive at the capital charge. Accordingly, banks are required to measure the \ngeneral market risk charge by calculating the price sensitivity (modified duration) of each position \nseparately. Under this method, the mechanics are as follows:  \ni. first calculate the price sensitivity (modified duration) of each instrument;  \nii. next apply the assumed change in yield to the modified duration of each instrume nt \nbetween 0.6 and 1.0 percentage points depending on the maturity of the instrument (see \nTable 1 5); \niii. slot the resulting capital charge measures into a maturity ladder with the fifteen time \nbands as set out in Table 1 5; \niv. subject long and short positions (sho rt position is not allowed in India except in \nderivatives and Central Government Securities) in each time band to a 5 per cent vertical \ndisallowance designed to capture basis risk; and  \nv. carry forward the net positions in each time -band for horizontal offset ting subject to the \ndisallowances set out in Table 1 6. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 104 \n Table 1 5 - Duration Method \u2013 Time Bands and Assumed changes in Yield  \nTime Bands  Assumed Change  \nin Yield  \n Time Bands  Assumed Change  \nin Yield  \nZone 1   Zone 3   \n1 month or less  1.00  3.6 to 4.3 ye ars 0.75  \n1 to 3 months  1.00  4.3 to 5.7 years  0.70  \n3 to 6 months  1.00  5.7 to 7.3 years  0.65  \n6 to 12 months  1.00  7.3 to 9.3 years  0.60  \nZone 2   9.3 to 10.6 years  0.60  \n1.0 to 1.9 years  0.90  10.6 to 12 years  0.60  \n1.9 to 2.8 years  0.80  12 to 20 years  0.60  \n2.8 to 3.6 years  0.75  over 20 years  0.60  \n \nTable 1 6 - Horizontal Disallowances  \nZones  Time band  Within the  \nzones  Between  \nadjacent zones  Between zones  \n1 and 3  \nZone 1  1 month or less  \n40% \n40% \n \n \n40% \n \n \n \n 100%  1 to 3 months  \n3 to 6 months  \n6 to 12 months  \nZone 2  1.0 to 1.9 years  \n30% 1.9 to 2.8 years  \n2.8 to 3.6 years  \nZone 3  3.6 to 4.3 years  \n30% 4.3 to 5.7 years  \n5.7 to 7.3 years  \n7.3 to 9.3 years  \n9.3 to 10.6 years  \n10.6 to 12 years  \n12 to 20 years  \nover 20 years  \n \n8.3.10  The measurement system should  include all interest rate derivatives and off balance -sheet \ninstruments in the trading book which react to changes in interest rates, (e.g. forward rate \nagreements (FRAs), other forward contracts, bond f utures, interest rate and cross -currency \nswaps and forward foreign exchange positions). Options can be treated in a variety of ways as \ndescribed in Annex 9 . \n8.4  Measurement of Capital Charge for Equity Risk  \n8.4.1 The capital charge for equities would appl y on their current market value in bank\u2019s trading \nbook. Minimum capital requirement to cover the risk of holding or taking positions in equities in \nthe trading book is set out below. This is applied to all instruments that exhibit market behaviour \nsimilar to equities but not to non -convertible preference shares (which are covered by the interest \nrate risk requirements described earlier). The instruments covered include equity shares, whether 105 \n voting or non -voting, convertible securities that behave like equi ties, for example: units of mutual \nfunds  (other than debt mutual funds/ETFs mentioned in para 8.3.5) , and commitments to buy or \nsell equity . \nSpecific and General Market Risk  \n8.4.2 Capital charge for specific risk (akin to credit risk) will be 11.25 per cen t or capital charge in \naccordance with the risk warranted by external rating (or lack of it) of the counterparty, whichever \nis higher and specific risk is computed on banks' gross equity positions (i.e. , the sum of all long \nequity positions and of all shor t equity positions - short equity position is, however, not allowed \nfor banks in India). In addition, the general market risk charge will also be 9 per cent on the gross \nequity positions. These capital charges will also be applicable to all trading book ex posures, which \nare exempted from capital market exposure ceilings for direct investments . \n8.4.3 Specific Risk Capital Charge for banks\u2019 investment in Security Receipts will be 13.5 per cent \n(equivalent to 150 per cent risk weight). Since the Security Recei pts are by and large illiquid and \nnot traded in the secondary market, there will be no General Market Risk Capital Charge on them \n(vide mailbox clarification dated January 18, 2010) . \n8.4.4 The specific risk charge for bank\u2019s investments in the equity of ot her banks / other financial \nentities / non -financial entities will be as under:  \nTable 1 7 \u2013 Part A: Specific risk charge for bank\u2019s investments in the equity of other \nbanks held in HFT and AFS portfolios  \nLevel  of Common Equity Tier 1  \ncapital (CET1) includin g applicable  \ncapital conservation  buffer (CCB)  \n(%) of the investee bank (where  \napplicable)  All Scheduled Banks  \n(Commercial,  Regional  Rural \nBanks, Local Area  Banks and \nCo-Operative  Banks)  All Non -scheduled Banks  \n(Commercial,  Local Area  \nBanks and Co -Operativ e \nBanks) (in %)  \n Equity investments in other \nbanks referred to in:  Equity investments in other  \nbanks referred to in:  \npara 5.6.1(i)  Para 5.6.1(ii)  para 5.6.1(i)  para 5.6.1(ii)  \nApplicable   Minimum   CET1   +  \nApplicable CCB and above  11.25  22.5  11.25  27 \nApplicable Minimum CET1 + CCB =  \n75% and <100% of applicable CCB  13.5  27 22.5  31.5  \nApplicable Minimum CET1 + CCB =  \n50% and <75% of applicable CCB  22.5  31.5  31.5  40.5  \nApplicable Minimum CET1 + CCB =  \n0% and <50% of applicable CCB  31.5  40.5  56.25  Full \ndeduc tion*  \nMinimum CET1 less than applicable  \nminimum  50 Full \ndeduction*  Full \ndeduction*  Full \ndeduction*  \n* Full deduction should be made from Common Equity Tier 1 capital  \n \n 106 \n Note:  \nTill such time the investee banks have not disclosed their Basel III capital rati os publicly, the \nrisk weights / capital charges may be arrived at based on the tables/paragraph as contained \nin the Master Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.4/21.06.001/2015 -16 date d July 1, 2015  on \nPrudential Guidelines on Capital Adequacy and Market Discipline - New Capital Adequacy \nFramework . \n \nTable 1 7 \u2013 Part B: Specific risk charge for bank\u2019s investments in the equity of \nfinancial entities other than banks  \n Equity investments in  financial entities other than banks  \nreferred to in:  \n para 5.6.1(i)  para 5.6.1(ii)  \nSpecific risk charge (%)  11.25  22.5  \n \nTable 1 7 \u2013 Part C: Specific risk charge for bank\u2019s investments in the equity of  \nnon-financial (commercial) entities  \n Equity investmen ts in non -financial entities  \n where a bank does not \nown more than 10% of the \nequity capital of investee  \ncompanies  which are more than 10% of the equity \ncapital of investee companies or which \nare affiliates of the bank (these \nexposures need not attract gen eral \nmarket risk charge)  \nSpecific risk charge (%)  11.25  100 \n \n8.5  Measurement of Capital Charge for Foreign Exchange Risk  \nThe bank\u2019s net open position in each cur rency should  be calculated by summing:  \n\u2022 The net spot position (i.e. , all asset items less all  liability items, including accrued \ninterest, denominated in the currency in question);  \n\u2022 The net forward position (i.e. , all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid \nunder forward foreign exchange transactions, including currency futures and the \nprincipal on currency swaps not included in the spot position);  \n\u2022 Guarantees (and similar instruments) that are certain to be called and are likely to be \nirrecoverable;  \n\u2022 Net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged (at the discretion \nof the reporting bank);  \n\u2022 Depending on  accounting conventions in different countries, any other item \nrepresenting a profit or loss in foreign currencies;  \n\u2022 The net delta -based equivalent of the total book of foreign currency options  \nForeign exchange open position s and gold open positions are at present risk -weighted at 100 per \ncent. Thus, capital charge for market risks in foreign exchange and gold open position is 9 per \ncent. These open positions, limits or actual whichever is higher , would continue to attract 107 \n capital charge at 9 per cent. This capital charge is in addition to the capital charge for credit risk \non the on -balance sheet and off -balance sheet items pertaining to foreign exchange and gold \ntransactions.  \n8.6 Measurement of Capital Charge for Credit Defa ult Swap (CDS) in the Trading Book  \n8.6.1  General Market Risk  \nA credit default swap does not normally create a position for general market risk for either the \nprotection buyer or protection seller. However, the present value of premium payable / receivable \nis sensitive to changes in the interest rates. In order to measure the interest rate risk in premium \nreceivable / payable, the present value of the premium can be treated as a notional position in \nGovernment securities of relevant maturity. These positions  will attract appropriate capital charge \nfor general market risk. The protection buyer / seller will treat the present value of the premium \npayable / receivable equivalent to a short / long notional position in Government securities of \nrelevant maturity . \n8.6.2 Specific Risk for Exposure to Reference Entity  \nA CDS creates a notional long / short position for specific risk in the reference asset / obligation \nfor protection seller / protection buyer. For calculating specific risk capital charge, the notional \namount of the CDS and its maturity should be used. The specific risk capital charge for CDS \npositions will be as per Tables below . \n \nTable 18: Specific Risk Capital Charges for bought and sold CD S positions  \nin the Trading Book :  \nExposures to entities  other t han Commercial Real Estate Companies  \nUpto 90 days  After 90 days  \nRatings by  \nthe ECAI* Residual Maturity of the  \ninstrument  Capital  \ncharge  Ratings by  \nthe ECAI* Capital  \ncharge  \nAAA to BBB  6 months or less  0.28 %  AAA  1.8 %  \nGreater than 6 months and  \nup  to  and  including  24  \nmonths  1.14%  AA 2.7%  \nExceeding 24 months  1.80%  A 4.5%  \nBBB  9.0%  \nBB and  \nbelow  All maturities  13.5%  BB and  \nbelow  13.5%  \nUnrated  \n(if permitted)  All maturities  9.0%  Unrated  \n(if permitted)  9.0%  \n* These ratings indicate the ratings assi gned by Indian rating agencies / ECAIs or foreign rating \nagencies.

The modifiers \"+\" or \" -\" have been subsumed within the main category.  \n8.6.2.1 Specific Risk Capital Charges for Positions Hedged by CDS86 \n(i) Banks may fully offset the specific risk capital charges w hen the values of two legs (i.e. , \nlong and short in CDS positions) always move in the opposite direction and broadly to the same \nextent. This would be the case when the two legs consist of completely identical CDS . In these \ncases, no specific risk capital requirement applies to both sides of the CDS positions.  \n(ii) Banks may offset 80 per cent of the specific risk capital charges when the value of two \nlegs (i.e. , long and short) always moves in the opposite direction but not broadly to the same \nextent. This  would be the case when a long cash position is hedged by a credit default swap and \nthere is an exact match in terms of the reference / deliverable obligation, and the maturity of both \nthe reference / deliverable obligation and the CDS. In addition, key fe atures of the CDS (e.g. , \ncredit event definitions, settlement mechanisms) should not cause the price movement of the \nCDS to materially deviate from the price movements of the cash position. To the extent that the \ntransaction transfers risk, an 80% specific  risk offset will be applied to the side of the transaction \nwith the higher capital charge, while the specific risk requirement on the other side will be zero . \n(iii) Banks may offset partially the specific risk capital charges when the value of the two leg s \n(i.e., long and short) usually moves in the opposite direction. This would be the case in the \nfollowing situations : \n(a) The position is captured in paragraph 8.6.2.1(ii) but there is an asset mismatch between \nthe cash position and the CDS. However, the u nderlying asset is included in the (reference / \ndeliverable) obligations in the CDS documentation and meets the requirements in paragraph \n5.17.1.3(i) above . \n                                                            \n86 Please refer to paragraph 6.2 of Annex 7 of this Master C ircular for details.  109 \n (b) The position is captured in paragraph 8.6.2.1(ii) but there is maturity mismatch between \ncredit  protection and the underlying asset. However, the underlying asset is included in the \n(reference/ deliverable) obligations in the CDS documentation.  \n(c) In each of the cases in paragraph (a) and (b) above, rather than applying specific risk \ncapital requir ements on each side of the transaction (i.e. , the credit protection and the underlying \nasset), only higher of the two capital requirements will apply.  \n8.6.2.2  Specific Risk Charge in CDS Positions which are not meant for Hedging  \nIn cases not captured in pa ragraph 8.6.2.1, a specific risk capital charge will be assessed against \nboth sides of the positions . \n8.6.3  Capital Charge for Counterparty Credit Risk  \nThe credit exposure for the purpose of counterparty credit risk on account of CDS transactions in \nthe Tr ading Book will be calculated according to the Current Exposure Method87. \n8.6.3.1 Protection Seller  \nA protection seller will have exposure to the protection buyer only if the fee/premia is outstanding. \nIn such cases, the counterparty credit risk charge for all single name long CDS positions in the \nTrading Book will be calculated as the sum of the current marked -to-market value, if positive (zero, \nif marked -to-market value is negative) and the potential future exposure add -on factors based on \ntable given belo w. However, the add -on will be capped to the amount of unpaid premia . \nTable 2 0: Add -on Factors for Protection Sellers    \n(As % of Notional Principal of CDS)  \nType of Reference Obligation  Add-on Factor  \nObligations rated BBB - and above  10%  \nBelow BBB - and unrated  20%  \n8.6.3.2  Protection Buyer  \nA CDS contract creates a counterparty exposure on the protection seller on account of the credit \nevent payment. The counterparty credit risk charge for all short CDS positions in the Trading Book \n                                                            \n87 A CDS contract, which is required to be marked -to-market, creates bilateral exposure for the parties to the \ncontract. The mark -to-market value of a CDS contract is the difference between the default -adjusted present value \nof protecti on payment (called \u201cprotection leg\u201d / \u201ccredit leg\u201d) and the present value of premium payable called \n(\u201cpremium leg\u201d). If the value of credit leg is less than the value of the premium leg, then the marked -to-market value \nfor the protection seller in positive . Therefore, the protection seller will have exposure to the counterparty \n(protection buyer) if the value of premium leg is more than the value of credit leg. In case, no premium is outstanding, \nthe value of premium leg will be zero and the mark -to-market value of the CDS contract will always be negative for \nthe protection seller and therefore, protection seller will not have any exposure to the protection buyer. In no case, \nthe protection seller\u2019s exposure on protection buyer can exceed the amount of the p remium unpaid. For the purpose \nof capital adequacy as well as exposure norms, the measure of counterparty exposures in case of CDS transaction \nheld in Trading Book is the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) which is measured and recognised as per Current \nExpos ure Method.  110 \n will be calculated as  the sum of the current marked -to-market value, if positive (zero, if marked -\nto-market value is negative) and the potential future exposure add -on factors based on table given \nbelow : \nTable 2 1: Add -on Factors for Protection Buyers    \n (As % of Notional P rincipal of CDS)  \nType of Reference Obligation  Add-on Factor  \nObligations rated BBB - and above  10%  \nBelow BBB - and unrated  20%  \n \n8.6.3.3 Capital Charge for Counterparty Risk for Collateralised Transactions in CDS  \nAs mentioned in paragraph 3.3 of the circular IDMD.PCD.No.5053/14.03.04/2010 -11 dated May \n23, 2011 , collaterals and margins would be maintained by the individual market participants. The \ncounterparty exposure for C DS traded in the OTC market will be calculated as per the Current \nExposure Method. Under this method, the calculation of the counterparty credit risk charge for an \nindividual contract, taking into account the collateral, will be as follows : \nCounterparty ri sk capital charge = [(RC + add -on) \u2013 CA] x r x 9%  \nWhere;  \nRC = the replacement cost,  \nadd-on = the amount for potential future exposure calcul ated according to paragraph \n5.15.3.5 above.  \nCA = the volatility adjusted amount of eligible collateral under the co mprehensive approach \nprescribed in paragraph 7.3 on \"Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques - Collateralised \nTransactions\" of these directions, or zero if no eligible collateral is applied to the transaction, \nand \nr = the risk weight of the counterparty.  \n8.6.4  Treatment of Exposures below Materiality Thresholds of CDS  \nMateriality thresholds on payments below which no payment is made in the event of loss are \nequivalent to retained first loss positions and should be assigned risk weight of 1250 per cent for \ncapital  adequacy purpose by the protection buyer . \n8.7 Aggregation of the capital charge for Market Risks  \nAs explained earlier capital charges for specific risk and general market risk are to be computed \nseparately before aggregation. For computing the total capit al charge and Risk Weighted Assets \nfor market risks, the calculations may be plotted in the following table : \n 111 \n Proforma  \n(\u20b9 in crore)  \nRisk Category  Capital charge  Risk Weighted  \nAssets (RWA)  \nI.

Total capital charge and RWA for  \nmarket risks (I+II+III)    \n \n8.8 Treatment for Illiquid Positions  \n8.8.1 Prudent Valuation Guidance  \n(i) This section provides banks with guidance on prudent valu ation for positions that are \naccounted for at fair value. This guidance would be applicable to all positions \nenumerated in paragraph 8.2.1  above. It is especially important for positions without \nactual market prices or observable inputs to valuation, as we ll as less liquid positions \nwhich raise supervisory concerns about prudent valuation. The valuation guidance set \nforth below is not intended to require banks to change valuation procedures for financial \nreporting purposes . \n(ii) A framework for prudent valu ation practices should at a minimum include the following:  \n8.8.1.1  Systems and Controls:  \nBanks must establish and maintain adequate systems and controls sufficient to give management \nand supervisors the confidence that their valuation estimates are prudent  and reliable. These \nsystems must be integrated with other risk management systems within the organisation (such \nas credit analysis). Such systems must include:  \n(i) Documented policies and procedures for the process of valuation. This includes clearly \ndefined responsibilities of the various areas involved in the determination of the \nvaluation, sources of market information and review of their appropriateness, guidelines \nfor the use of unobservable inputs reflecting the bank\u2019s assumptions of what market 112 \n participants would use in pricing the position, frequency of independent valuation, timing \nof closing prices, procedures for adjusting valuations, end of the month and ad -hoc \nverification procedures; and  \n(ii) Clear and independent (i.e. , independent of front o ffice) reporting lines for the \ndepartment accountable for the valuation process . \n8.8.1.2  Valuation Methodologies : \nMarking to Market  \n(i) Marking -to-market is at least the daily valuation of positions at readily available close out \nprices in orderly transact ions that are sourced independently. Examples of readily available close \nout prices include exchange prices, screen prices, or quotes from several independent reputable \nbrokers . \n(ii) Banks must mark -to-market as much as possible. The more prudent side of b id/offer \nshould be used unless the institution is a significant market maker in a particular position type and \nit can close out at mid -market. Banks should maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and \nminimise the use of unobservable inputs when esti mating fair value using a valuation technique. \nHowever, observable inputs or transactions may not be relevant, such as in a forced liquidation \nor distressed sale, or transactions may not be observable, such as when markets are inactive. In \nsuch cases, the observable data should be considered, but may not be determinative . \nMarking to Model  \n(iii) Marking -to model is defined as any valuation which has to be benchmarked, extrapolated \nor otherwise calculated from a market input. Where marking -to-market is not po ssible, banks \nshould follow the guidelines on valuation of investments contained in Master Direction - \nClassification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks (Directions), \ndated August 25, 2021 . For investment and derivative po sitions other than those covered in the \nMaster Circular, the valuation model used by banks must be demonstrated to be prudent. When \nmarking to valuation model other than that prescribed in RBI / FIMMDA guidelines, an extra \ndegree of conservatism is appropr iate. RBI will consider the following in assessing whether a \nmark -to-model valuation is prudent : \n\uf0b7 Senior management should be aware of the elements of the trading book or of other fair -\nvalued positions which are subject to mark to model and should understan d the materiality \nof the uncertainty this creates in the reporting of the risk/performance of the business.  \n\uf0b7 Market inputs should be sourced, to the extent possible, in line with market prices (as \ndiscussed above). The appropriateness of the market inputs f or the particular position \nbeing valued should be reviewed regularly.  \n\uf0b7 Where available, generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular products \nshould be used as far as possible.  113 \n \uf0b7 Where the model is developed by the institution itself, it should b e based on appropriate \nassumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably qualified parties \nindependent of the development process. The model should be developed or approved \nindependently of the front office. It should be independently tested . This includes validating \nthe mathematics, the assumptions and the software implementation.  \n\uf0b7 There should be formal change control procedures in place and a secure copy of the \nmodel should be held and periodically used to check valuations.  \n\uf0b7 Risk management should be aware of the weaknesses of the models used and how best \nto reflect those in the valuation output.  \n\uf0b7 The model should be subject to periodic review to determine the accuracy of its \nperformance (e.g. , assessing continued appropriateness of the assump tions, analysis of \nP&L versus risk factors, comparison of actual close out values to model outputs).  \n\uf0b7 Valuation adjustments should be made as appropriate, for example, to cover the \nuncertainty of the model valuation (see also valuation adjustments in paragr aphs 8.8.1.2 \n(vi), (vii) and 8.8.2.1 to 8.8.2.4).  \nIndependent Price Verification  \n(iv) Independent price verification is distinct from daily mark -to-market. It is the process by \nwhich market prices or model inputs are regularly verified for accuracy. While daily marking -to-\nmarket may be performed by dealers, verification of market prices or model inputs should be \nperformed by a unit independent of the dealing room, at least monthly (or, depending on the \nnature of the market/trading activity, more frequently) . It need not be performed as frequently as \ndaily mark -to-market, since the objective, i.e. , independent, marking of positions should reveal \nany error or bias in pricing, which should result in the elimination of inaccurate daily marks.  \n(v) Independent pri ce verification entails a higher standard of accuracy in that the market \nprices or model inputs are used to determine profit and loss figures, whereas daily marks are \nused primarily for management reporting in between reporting dates. For independent price  \nverification, where pricing sources are more subjective, e.g. , only one available broker quote, \nprudent measures such as valuation adjustments may be appropriate . \nValuation Adjustments  \n(vi) As part of their procedures for marking to market, banks must est ablish and maintain \nprocedures for considering valuation adjustments. RBI would particularly expect banks using \nthird-party valuations to consider whether valuation adjustments are necessary. Such \nconsiderations are also necessary when marking to model . \n(vii) At a minimum, banks should consider the following valuation adjustments while valuing \ntheir derivatives portfolios : 114 \n \u2022 incurred CVA losses88, \n\u2022 closeout costs,  \n\u2022 operational risks,  \n\u2022 early termination, investing and funding costs, and  \n\u2022 future administrative costs  and, \n\u2022 where appropriate, model risk.  \nBanks may follow any recognised method/model to compute the above adjustments except \nprovisions against incurred CVA losses. However, banks may use the following formula to \ncalculate incurred CVA loss on derivatives tra nsactions : \n \nIn cases where market based credit spreads are not available, risk premium applicable to \nthe counterparty according to its credit grade as per the internal credit rating system of the \nbank used for pricing/loan approval purposes at time \u2018t\u2019 ma y be used . \nRP 0 = Credit spread of the counterparty as reflected in the CDS or bond prices.  \nIn cases where market based credit spreads are not available, risk premium applicable to \nthe counterparty according to its credit grade as per the internal credit ra ting system of the \nbank used for pricing / loan approval purposes at time \u20180\u2019 i.e. the date of the transaction . \nNote : Some of other terms used above are explained below:  \nClose -out costs  \nClose -out costs adjustment factors in the cost of eliminating the mark et risk of the portfolio.  \n \n                                                            \n88 Provisions against incurred CVA losses are akin to specific provisions required on impaired assets and depreciation \nin case of investments held in the trading book. These provisions will be in addition to the general provisions @ 0.4% \nrequire d on the positive MTM values. The provisions against incurred CVA losses may be netted off from the \nexposure value while calculating capital charge for default risk under the Current Exposure Method as required in \nterms of paragraph 5.15.3.5 (ii).  \nICVAL t = Max [0,{(EE t *RPt) - (EE0 *RP0)}] \n \nWhere;  \n \nICVAL t = Cumulative Incurred CVA loss at time \u2018t\u2019.  \n \nEEt = Value of counterparty exposure projected after one year from \u2018t\u2019 and \ndiscounted back to \u2018t\u2019 using CEM and a risk free discount rate for one year  \n \nEE 0  \n \n= Counterparty exposure estimated at time \u20180\u2019 using CEM  \n  \nRP t  \n= Credit spread of the counterparty as reflected in the CDS or bond   115 \n Investing and Funding costs  \nThe \"investing and funding costs adjustment\" relating to the cost of funding and investing cash \nflow mismatches at rates different from the rate which models typically assume.  \nAdministrative costs adju stment  \nAdministrative costs adjustment relates to the costs that will be incur red to administer the portfolio.  \n8.8.2  Adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital \npurposes:  \n8.8.2.1 Banks must establish and maintain pro cedures for judging the necessity of and calculating \nan adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital purposes. This \nadjustment may be in addition to any changes to the value of the position required for financial \nreporting purposes and should be designed to reflect the illiquidity of the position. An adjustment \nto a position\u2019s valuation to reflect current illiquidity should be considered whether the position is \nmarked to market using market prices or observable inputs,  third-party valuations or marked to \nmodel.  \n8.8.2.2 Bearing in mind that the assumptions made about liquidity in the market risk capital charge \nmay not be consistent with the bank\u2019s ability to sell or hedge out less liquid positions where \nappropriate, bank s must take an adjustment to the current valuation of these positions, and review \ntheir continued appropriateness on an on -going basis. Reduced liquidity may have arisen from \nmarket events. Additionally, close -out prices for concentrated positions and/or s tale positions \nshould be considered in establishing the adjustment. RBI has not prescribed any particularly \nmethodology for calculating the amount of valuation adjustment on account of illiquid positions. \nBanks must consider all relevant factors when deter mining the appropriateness of the adjustment \nfor less liquid positions. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the amount of time it \nwould take to hedge out the position/risks within the position, the average volatility of bid/offer \nspreads, th e availability of independent market quotes (number and identity of market makers), \nthe average and volatility of trading volumes (including trading volumes during periods of market \nstress), market concentrations, the aging of positions, the extent to whic h valuation relies on \nmarking -to-model, and the impact of other model risks not included in paragraph 8.8.2.2. The \nvaluation adjustment on account of illiquidity should be considered irrespective of whether the \nguidelines issued by FIMMDA have taken into a ccount the illiquidity premium or not, while fixing \nYTM/spreads for the purpose of valuation . \n8.8.2.3 For complex products including, but not limited to, securitisation exposures, banks must \nexplicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments to reflect t wo forms of model risk : \n(i) the model risk associated with using a possibly incorrect valuation methodology; and  116 \n (ii) the risk associated with using unobservable (and possibly incorrect) calibration \nparameters in the valuation model.  \n8.8.2.4 The adjustment  to the current valuation of less liquid positions made under paragraph \n8.8.2.2 will not be debited to P&L Account, but will be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital \nwhile computing CRAR of the bank. The adjustment may exceed those valuation adjustmen ts \nmade under financial reporting/accounting standards and paragraphs 8.8.1.2 (vi) and (vii).  \n8.8.2.5 In calculating the eligible capital for market risk, it will be necessary first to calculate the \nbanks\u2019 minimum capital requirement for credit and operati onal risk and only afterwards its market \nrisk requirement to establish how much components of capital are available to support market \nrisk. \n9. Capital Charge for Operational Risk  \n9.1 Definition of Operational Risk  \nOperational risk is defined as the risk of  loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal \nprocesses, people and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk, but \nexcludes strategic and reputational risk. Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to fines, \npena lties, or punitive damages resulting from supervisory actions, as well as private settlements . \n9.2 The Measurement Methodologies  \n9.2.1 The New Capital Adequacy Framework outlines three methods for calculating operational \nrisk capital charges in a continuum  of increasing sophistication and risk sensitivity: (i) the Basic \nIndicator Approach (BIA); (ii) the Standardised Approach (TSA); and (iii) Advanced Measurement \nApproaches (AMA).  \n9.2.2 Banks are encouraged to move along the spectrum of available approaches  as they develop \nmore sophisticated operational risk measurement systems and practices.  \n9.2.3 The New Capital Adequacy Framework provides that internationally active banks and banks \nwith significant operational risk exposures are expected to use an approac h that is more \nsophisticated than the Basic Indicator Approach and that is appropriate for the risk profile of the \ninstitution. However, to begin with, banks in India shall compute the capital requirements for \noperational risk under the Basic Indicator App roach. Reserve Bank will review the capital \nrequirement produced by the Basic Indicator Approach for general credibility, especially in relation \nto a bank\u2019s peers and in the event that credibility is lacking, appropriate supervisory action under \nPillar 2 w ill be considered.   \n9.3 The Basic Indicator Approach  \n9.3.1  Under the Basic Indicator Approach, banks must hold capital for operational risk equal to \nthe average over the previous three years of a fixed percentage (denoted as alpha) of positive \nannual gross  income. Figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative or zero 117 \n should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the average. If \nnegative gross income distorts a bank\u2019s Pillar 1 capital charge, Reserve Bank will co nsider \nappropriate supervisory action under Pillar 2. The charge may be expressed as follows : \n KBIA = [ \u2211 (GI 1\u2026n x \u03b1)]/n  \nWhere:   \nKBIA =  the capital charge under the Basic Indicator Approach   \nGI    =  annual gross income, where positive, over the previous th ree years   \nn      =  number of the previous three years for which gross income is positive  \n\u03b1     = 15 per cent, which is set by the BCBS, relating the industry wide level of required \ncapital to the industry wide level of the indicator.  \n9.3.2. Gross income is defined as \u201cNet interest income\u201d plus \u201cnet non -interest income\u201d. It is \nintended that this measure should:  \n(i) be gross of any provisions (e.g. , for unpaid interest) and write -offs made during the year;  \n(ii) be gross of operating expenses, including fees  paid to outsourcing service providers, in \naddition to fees paid for services that are outsourced, fees received by banks that \nprovide outsourcing services shall be included in the definition of gross income;  \n(iii) exclude reversal during the year in respe ct of provisions and write -offs made during the \nprevious year(s);  \n(iv) exclude income recognised from the disposal of items of movable and immovable \nproperty;  \n(v) exclude realised profits/losses from the sale of securities in the \u201cheld to maturity\u201d  \ncategor y; \n(vi) exclude income from legal settlements in favour of the bank;  \n(vii) exclude other extraordinary or irregular items of income and expenditure; and  \n(viii) exclude income derived from insurance activities (i.e. , income derived by writing \ninsurance poli cies) and insurance claims in favour of the bank.  \n9.3.3  Banks are advised to compute capital charge for operational risk under the  Basic Indicator \nApproach as follows:  \n(a) Average of [Gross Income * alpha (\u03b1)] for each of the last three financial years, exc luding \nyears of negative or zero gross income  as mentioned in paragraph 9.3.1 . \n(b) Gross income = Net profit (+) Provisions & contingencies (+) operating expenses \n(Schedule 16) ( \u2013) items (iii) to (viii) of paragraph 9.3.2 . 118 \n (c) Alpha (\u03b1) = 15 per cent  \n9.3.4  As a point of entry for capital calculation, no specific criteria for use of the Basic Indicator \nApproach are set out in these directions. Nevertheless, banks using this approach are \nencouraged to comply with the Basel Committee\u2019s guidance \u2018Principles for  the Sound \nManagement of Operational Risk\u2019 , June 2011, and the \u2018Guidance Note on Management of \nOperational Risk\u2019 , issued by the R eserve Bank of India in October  2005.  \n9.3.5  Once the bank has calculated the capital charge for operational risk under BIA, it has to \nmultiply this with 12.5 and arrive at the notional risk weighted asset (RWA) for operational risk . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 119 \n  \n \nPart B: Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)  \n10. Introduction to the SREP under Pillar 2  \n10.1 The New Capi tal Adequacy Framework (NCAF), based on the Basel II Framework evolved \nby the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, was adapted for India vide Circular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.90/2 0.06.001/ 2006 -07 dated April 27, 2007 . In terms of paragraph 2.4 (iii)(c) \nof the Annex to the aforesaid circular banks were required to have a Board -approved policy on \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and to assess the capital require ment \nas per ICAAP. It is presumed that banks would have formulated the policy and also undertaken \nthe capital adequacy assessment accordingly.  \n10.2 The Capital Adequacy Framework rests on three components or three Pillars. Pillar 1 is \nthe Minimum Capital R atio while Pillar 2 and Pillar 3 are the Supervisory Review Process (SRP) \nand Market Discipline, respectively. The guidelines in regard to the SRP and the ICAAP are \nfurnished in this Section. An illustrative outline of the format of the ICAAP document, to be \nsubmitted to the RBI, by banks, is furnished at Annex 15 . \n10.3 The objective of the SRP is to ensure that banks have adequate capital to support all the \nrisks in their business as also to encourage them to develop and use better risk management \ntechniqu es for monitoring and managing their risks. This in turn would require a well -defined \ninternal assessment process within banks through which they assure the RBI that adequate \ncapital is indeed held towards the various risks to which they are exposed. The p rocess of \nassurance could also involve an active dialogue between the bank and the RBI so that, when \nwarranted, appropriate intervention could be made to either reduce the risk exposure of the bank \nor augment / restore its capital. Thus, ICAAP is an import ant component of the SRP.  \n10.4 The main aspects to be addressed under the SRP, and therefore, under the ICAAP, would \ninclude:  \n(a) the risks that are not fully captured by the minimum capital ratio prescribed under Pillar 1;  \n(b) the risks that are not at al l taken into account by the Pillar 1; and  \n(c) the factors external to the bank.  \nSince the capital adequacy ratio prescribed by the RBI under the Pillar 1 of the Framework is only \nthe regulatory minimum  level, addressing only the three specified risks (viz. , credit, market and \noperational risks), holding additional capital might be necessary for banks, on account of both \u2013 \nthe possibility of some under -estimation of risks under the Pillar 1 and the actual risk exposure of \na bank vis -\u00e0-vis the quality of its risk management architecture. Illustratively , some of the risks \nthat the banks are generally exposed to but which are not captured or not fully captured in the \nregulatory CRAR would include:  120 \n (a) Interest rate risk in the banking book;  \n(b) Credit concentrat ion risk;  \n(c) Liquidity risk;  \n(d) Settlement risk;  \n(e) Reputational risk;  \n(f) Strategic risk;  \n(g) Risk of under -estimation of credit risk under the Standardised approach;  \n(h) Model risk i.e., the risk of under -estimation of credit risk under the IRB approa ches;  \n(i) Risk of weakness in the credit -risk mitigants;  \n(j) Residual risk of securitisation ; \n(k) Cyber security/IT infrastructure risk;  \n(l) Human capital risk;  \n(m) Group risk;  \n(n) Outsourcing / vendor management risk;  \n(o) Collateral risk  \n \nThe quantificati on of currency induced credit risk will form a part of banks\u2019 Internal Capital \nAdequacy Assessment Programme (ICAAP) and banks are expected to address this risk in a \ncomprehensive manner. The ICAAP should measure the extent of currency induced credit risk89 \nthe bank is exposed to and also concentration of such exposures. Banks may also like to perform \nstress tests under various extreme but plausible exchange rate scenarios under ICAAP. Outcome \nof ICAAP may lead a bank to take appropriate risk management acti ons like risk reduction, \nmaintenance of more capital or provision, etc.  \nIt is, therefore, only appropriate that the banks make their own assessment of their various risk \nexposures, through a well -defined internal process, and maintain an adequate capital c ushion for \nsuch risks.  \n10.5 It is recognised that there is no one single approach for conducting the ICAAP and the \nmarket consensus in regard to the best practice for undertaking ICAAP is yet to emerge. The \nmethodologies and techniques are still evolving p articularly in regard to measurement of non -\nquantifiable risks, such as reputational and strategic risks. These guidelines, therefore, seek to \nprovide only broad principles to be followed by banks in developing their ICAAP . \n10.6 Banks were advised to devel op and put in place, with the approval of their Boards, an \nICAAP commensurate with their size, level of complexity, risk profile and scope of operations. \nThe ICAAP would be in addition to a bank\u2019s calculation of regulatory capital requirements under \nPillar  1. \n                                                            \n89 Please  refer to circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.85/21.06.200/2013 -14 and DBOD.No.BP.BC.116/21.06.200/2013 -14 dated \nJanuary 15, 2014 and June 3, 2014, respectively.  121 \n 10.7 The ICAAP document should, inter alia , include the capital adequacy assessment and \nprojections of capital requirement for the ensuing year, along with the plans and strategies for \nmeeting the capital requirement. An illustrative outline of a forma t of the ICAAP document is \nfurnished at Annex 15 , for guidance of the banks though the ICAAP documents of the banks \ncould vary in length and format, in tune with their size, level of complexity, risk profile and scope \nof operations.  \n11. Need for Improved R isk Management90 \n11.1 While financial institutions have faced difficulties over the years for a multitude of reasons, \nthe major causes of serious banking problems continue to be lax credit standards for borrowers \nand counterparties, poor portfolio risk mana gement, and a lack of attention to changes in \neconomic or other circumstances that can lead to a deterioration in the credit standing of a bank's \ncounterparties. This experience is common in both advanced and developing countries.  \n11.2 The financial market  crisis of 2007 -08 has underscored the critical importance of effective \ncredit risk management to the long -term success of any banking organisation and as a key \ncomponent to financial stability. It has provided a stark reminder of the need for banks to \neffectively identify, measure, monitor and control credit risk, as well as to understand how credit \nrisk interacts with other types of risk (including market, liquidity and reputational risk). The \nessential elements of a comprehensive credit risk management p rogramme include (i) \nestablishing an appropriate credit risk environment; (ii) operating under a sound credit granting \nprocess; (iii) maintaining an appropriate credit administration, measurement and monitoring \nprocess; and (iv) ensuring adequate controls over credit risk as elaborated in our Guidance note \non Credit Risk issued on October 12, 200291. \n11.3 The financial crisis has emphasised the importance of effective capital planning and long -\nterm capital maintenance. A bank\u2019s ability to withstand uncertain  market conditions is bolstered \nby maintaining a strong capital position that accounts for potential changes in the bank\u2019s strategy \nand volatility in market conditions over time. Banks should focus on effective and efficient capital \nplanning, as well as lo ng-term capital maintenance. An effective capital planning process requires \na bank to assess both the risks to which it is exposed and the risk management processes in \nplace to manage and mitigate those risks; evaluate its capital adequacy relative to its risks; and \nconsider the potential impact on earnings and capital from economic downturns. A bank\u2019s capital \nplanning process should incorporate rigorous, forward looking stress testing, as discussed below \nin paragraph 12. 10. \n11.4 Rapid growth in any busines s activity can present banks with significant risk management \nchallenges. This was the case with the expanded use of the \u201coriginate -to-distribute\u201d business \n                                                            \n90 Master Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.73/21.06.001/2009 -10 dated Feb 8, 2010 . \n91 Guidance Notes on Management of Credit Risk and Market Risk issued vide circular \nDBOD.No.BP.520/21.04.103/2002 -03 dated October 12, 2002 . 122 \n model, off -balance sheet vehicles, liquidity facilities and credit derivatives. The originate -to-\ndistribute model and securitisation can enhance credit intermediation and bank profitability, as \nwell as more widely diversify risk. Managing the associated risks, however, poses significant \nchallenges. Indeed, these activities create exposures within busines s lines, across the firm and \nacross risk factors that can be difficult to identify, measure, manage, mitigate and control. This is \nespecially true in an environment of declining market liquidity, asset prices and risk appetite. The \ninability to properly id entify and measure such risks may lead to unintended risk exposures and \nconcentrations, which in turn can lead to concurrent losses arising in several businesses and risk \ndimensions due to a common set of factors. Strong demand for structured products crea ted \nincentives for banks using the originate -to-distribute model to originate loans, such as subprime \nmortgages, using unsound and unsafe underwriting standards. At the same time, many investors \nrelied solely on the ratings of the credit rating agencies (C RAs) when determining whether to \ninvest in structured credit products. Many investors conducted little or no independent due \ndiligence on the structured products they purchased. Furthermore, many banks had insufficient \nrisk management processes in place to  address the risks associated with exposures held on their \nbalance sheet, as well as those associated with off -balance sheet entities, such as asset backed \ncommercial paper (ABCP) conduits and structured investment vehicles (SIVs).  \n11.5 Innovation has incr eased the complexity and potential illiquidity of structured credit \nproducts. This, in turn, can make such products more difficult to value and hedge, and may lead \nto inadvertent increases in overall risk. Further, the increased growth of complex investor -specific \nproducts may result in thin markets that are illiquid, which can expose a bank to large losses in \ntimes of stress if the associated risks are not well understood and managed in a timely and \neffective manner.  \n12. Guidelines for the SREP of the RBI and the ICAAP of Banks  \n12.1 Background  \n12.1.1 The Basel capital adequacy framework rests on the following three mutually -reinforcing \npillars:  \nPillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements - which prescribes a risk -sensitive calculation of \ncapital requirements tha t, for the first time, explicitly includes operational risk in addition \nto market and credit risk.  \nPillar 2: Supervisory Review Process (SRP) - which envisages the establishment of \nsuitable risk management systems in banks and their review by the superviso ry authority.  \nPillar 3: Market Discipline - which seeks to achieve increased transparency through \nexpanded disclosure requirements for banks.  \n12.1.2  The Basel Committee also lays down the following four key principles in regard to the SRP \nenvisaged under P illar 2:  123 \n Principle 1:  Banks should have a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in \nrelation to their risk profile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels.  \nPrinciple 2:  Supervisors should review and evaluate banks\u2019 internal capita l adequacy \nassessments and strategies, as well as their ability to monitor and ensure their compliance \nwith the regulatory capital ratios. Supervisors should  take appropriate supervisory action if \nthey are not satisfied with the result of this process.  \nPrinciple 3:  Supervisors should expect banks to operate above the minimum regulatory \ncapital ratios and should have the ability to require banks to hold capital in excess of the \nminimum.  \nPrinciple 4:  Supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to p revent capital from \nfalling below the minimum levels required to support the risk characteristics of a particular \nbank and should require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or restored.  \n12.1.3  It would be seen that the principles 1 and 3 re late to the supervisory expectations from \nbanks while the principles 2 and 4 deal with the role of the supervisors under Pillar 2. Pillar 2 \n(Supervisory Review Process - SRP) requires banks to implement an internal process, called the \nInternal Capital Adeq uacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), for assessing their capital adequacy in \nrelation to their risk profiles as well as a strategy for maintaining their capital levels. Pillar 2 also \nrequires the supervisory authorities to subject all banks to an evaluation pr ocess, hereafter called \nSupervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), and to initiate such supervisory measures \non that basis, as might be considered necessary. An analysis of the foregoing principles indicates \nthat the following broad responsibilities  have been cast on banks and the supervisors:  \nBanks\u2019 responsibilities  \n(a) Banks should have in place a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in \nrelation to their risk profile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels (Principle 1)  \n(b) Banks should operate above the minimum regulatory capital ratios (Principle 3)  \nSupervisors\u2019 responsibilities  \n(a) Supervisors should review and evaluate a bank\u2019s ICAAP. (Principle 2)  \n(b) Supervisors should take appropriate action if they are not satisfi ed with the results of \nthis process. (Principle 2)  \n(c) Supervisors should review and evaluate a bank\u2019s compliance with the regulatory capital \nratios. (Principle 2)  \n(d) Supervisors should have the ability to require banks to hold capital in excess of the \nminimum. (Principle 3)  124 \n (e) Supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from falling \nbelow the minimum levels. (Principle 4)  \n(f) Supervisors should require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or restored. \n(Principl e 4) \n12.1.4  Thus, the ICAAP and SREP are the two i mportant components of Pillar 2 and could be \nbroadly defined as follows:  \nThe ICAAP comprises a bank\u2019s procedures and measures designed to ensure the following:  \n(a) An appropriate identification and measurem ent of risks;  \n(b) An appropriate level of internal capital in relation to the bank\u2019s risk profile; and  \n(c) Application and further development of suitable risk management systems in the bank.  \nThe SREP consists of a review and evaluation process adopted by the supervisor, which covers \nall the processes and measures defined in the principles listed above. Essentially, these include \nthe review and evaluation of the bank\u2019s ICAAP, conducting an independent assessment of the \nbank\u2019s risk profile, and if necessary,  taking appropriate prudential measures and other supervisory \nactions.  \n12.1.5 These guidelines seek to provide broad guidance to banks by outlining the manner in which \nthe SREP would be carried out by the RBI, the expected scope and design of their ICAAP, and \nthe expectations of the RBI from banks in regard to implementation of the ICAAP.  \n12.2 Conduct of the SREP by the RBI  \n12.2.1 Capital helps protect individual banks from insolvency, thereby promoting safety and \nsoundness in the overall banking system. Mi nimum regulatory capital requirements under Pillar 1 \nestablish a threshold below which a sound bank\u2019s regulatory capital must not fall. Regulatory \ncapital ratios permit some comparative analysis of capital adequacy across regulated banking \nentities because  they are based on certain common methodology / assumptions. However, \nsupervisors need to perform a more comprehensive assessment of capital adequacy that \nconsiders risks specific to a bank, conducting analyses that go beyond minimum regulatory capital \nrequirements.  \n12.2.2 The RBI generally expects banks to hold capital above their minimum regulatory capital \nlevels, commensurate with their individual risk profiles, to account for all material risks. Under the \nSREP, the RBI will assess the overall capital ad equacy of a bank through a comprehensive \nevaluation that takes into account all relevant available information. In determining the extent to \nwhich banks should hold capital in excess of the regulatory minimum, the RBI would take into \naccount the combined i mplications of a bank\u2019s compliance with regulatory minimum capital \nrequirements, the quality and results of a bank\u2019s ICAAP, and supervisory assessment of the 125 \n bank\u2019s risk management processes, control systems and other relevant information relating to the \nbank\u2019s risk profile and capital position.  \n12.2.3 The SREP of banks would, thus, be conducted as part of the RBI\u2019s Risk Based Supervision \n(RBS)  of banks and in the light of the data in the off -site returns received from banks in the RBI, \nin conjunction with the ICAAP document, which is required to be submitted every year by banks \nto the RBI (refer to paragraph 12.3.3. 6 below). Through the SREP, the RBI would evaluate the \nadequacy and efficacy of the ICAAP of banks and the capital requirements derived by them \ntherefrom. While in the course of evaluation, there would be no attempt to reconcile the difference \nbetween the regulatory minimum CRAR and the outcome of the ICAAP of a bank (as the risks \ncovered under the two processes are different), banks would be expe cted to demonstrate to the \nRBI that the ICAAP adopted by them is fully responsive to their size, level of complexity, scope \nand scale of operations and the resultant risk profile / exposures, and adequately captures their \ncapital requirements. Such an eval uation of the effectiveness of the ICAAP would help the RBI in \nunderstanding the capital management processes and strategies adopted by banks. If considered \nnecessary, the SREP could also involve a dialogue between the bank\u2019s top management and the \nRBI fro m time to time. In addition to the periodic reviews, independent external experts may also \nbe commissioned by the RBI, if deemed necessary, to perform ad hoc reviews and comment on \nspecific aspects of the ICAAP process of a bank; the nature and extent of s uch a review shall be \ndetermined by the RBI . \n12.2.4  Pillar 1 capital requirements will include a buffer for uncertainties surrounding the Pillar 1 \nregime that affect the banking population as a whole. Bank -specific uncertainties will be treated \nunder Pilla r 292. It is anticipated that such buffers under Pillar 1 will be set to provide reasonable \nassurance that a bank with good internal systems and controls, a well -diversified risk profile and \na business profile well covered by the Pillar 1 regime, and which operates with capital equal to \nPillar 1 requirements, will meet the minimum goals for soundness embodied in Pillar 1. However, \nRBI may require particular banks to operate with a buffer, over and above the Pillar 1 standard. \nBanks should maintain this buffe r for a combination of the following : \n(a) Pillar 1 minimums are anticipated to be set to achieve a level of bank creditworthiness \nin markets that is below the level of creditworthiness sought by many banks for their own \nreasons. For example, most internati onal banks appear to prefer to be highly rated by \ninternationally recognised rating agencies. Thus, banks are likely to choose to operate \nabove Pillar 1 minimums for competitive reasons.  \n(b) In the normal course of business, the type and volume of activiti es will change, as will \nthe different risk exposures, causing fluctuations in the overall capital ratio.  \n                                                            \n92 Annex 3 of the Guidelines on Implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India issued vide circular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -2012 dated May 2, 2012 . 126 \n (c) It may be costly for banks to raise additional capital, especially if this needs to be done \nquickly or at a time when market conditions are unfavou rable.  \n(d) For banks to fall below minimum regulatory capital requirements is a serious matter. It \nmay place banks in breach of the provisions of the Banking  Regulation Act and / or \nattract prompt corrective action on the part of RBI.  \n(e) There may be risk s, either specific to individual banks, or more generally to an economy \nat large, that are not taken into account in Pillar 193. \nAs a part of Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) under Pillar 2, RBI may review \nthe risk management measures taken by the bank and its adequacy to manag e currency induced \ncredit risk94, especially if exposure to such risks is assessed to be on higher side.  \nUnder the SREP, the RBI would make an assessment as to whether the bank maintains adequate \ncapital cushion to take care of the above situations. Such a cushion should be in addition to the \ncapital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, if any, required to be maintained by \nthe bank according to the applicable guidelines. Such cushion would generally be reflected in \nmore than minimum capital adequacy ratio maintained by the bank after taking into account \ncapital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer.  \nUnder the SREP, RBI would also seek to determine whether a bank\u2019s overall capital remains  \nadequate as the underlying conditions change. Generally, material increases in risk that are not \notherwise mitigated should be accompanied by commensurate increases in capital. Conversely, \nreductions in overall capital (to a level still above regulatory m inima) may be appropriate if the \nRBI\u2019s supervisory assessment leads it to a conclusion that risk has materially declined or that it \nhas been appropriately mitigated. Based on such assessment, the RBI could consider initiating \nappropriate supervisory measur es to address its supervisory concerns. The measures could \ninclude requiring a modification or enhancement of the risk management and internal control \nprocesses of a bank, a reduction in risk exposures, or any other action as deemed necessary to \naddress th e identified supervisory concerns. These measures could also include the stipulation \nof a bank -specific additional capital requirement over and above what has been determined under \nPillar 1.  \n12.2.5  As and when the advanced approaches envisaged in the Basel  capital adequacy \nframework are permitted to be adopted in India, the SREP would also assess the ongoing \ncompliance by banks with the eligibility criteria for adopting the advanced approaches.  \n                                                            \n93 If a bank has identified some capital add -on to take care of an identified Pillar 2 risk o r inadequately capitalised \nPillar 1 risk, that add -on can be translated into risk weighted assets as indicated in this paragraph below, which \nshould be added to the total risk weighted assets of the bank. No additional Pillar 2 buffer need be maintained fo r \nsuch identified risks.  \n94 Please refer to circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.85/21.06.200/2013 -14 and DBOD .No.BP.BC.116/21.06.200/2013 -14 dated \nJanuary 15, 2014 and June 3, 2014, respectively.  127 \n 12.3 The Structural Aspects of the ICAAP  \n12.3.1 This section ou tlines the broad parameters of the ICAAP that banks shall comply with in \ndesigning and implementing their ICAAP.  \n12.3.2  Every bank shall have an ICAAP  \nThe ICAAP shall be prepared, on a solo basis, at every tier for each banking entity within the \nbanking gr oup, as also at the level of the consolidated bank . This requirement shall  also apply to \nthe foreign banks which have a branch presence in India and their ICAAP should cover their \nIndian operations only.  \n12.3.3  ICAAP to encompass firm -wide risk profile95 \n12.3.3.1  General firm -wide risk management principles:  \nSenior management should understand the importance of taking an integrated, firm -wide \nperspective of a bank\u2019s risk exposure, in order to support its ability to identify and react to \nemerging and growing risks in a timely and effective manner. The purpose of this guidance is the \nneed to enhance firm -wide oversight, risk management and controls around banks\u2019 capital \nmarkets activities, including securitisation, off -balance sheet exposures, structured credit  and \ncomplex trading activities.  \nA sound risk management system should have the following key features:  \n\uf0b7 Active board and senior management oversight;  \n\uf0b7 Appropriate policies, procedures and limits;  \n\uf0b7 Comprehensive and timely identification, measurement, mitigat ion, controlling, monitoring \nand reporting of risks;  \n\uf0b7 Appropriate management information systems (MIS) at the business and firm -wide level; \nand \n\uf0b7 Comprehensive internal controls.  \n12.3.3.2  Board and Senior Management Oversight:  \nThe ultimate responsibility for designing and implementation of the ICAAP lies with the board of \ndirectors of the bank  (in case of banks incorporated in India including foreign banks operating \nunder the WOS model)  and with the Chief Executive Officer (in the case of the foreign banks wit h \nbranch presence in India ). It is the responsibility of the board of directors and senior management \nto define the institution\u2019s risk appetite and to ensure that the bank\u2019s risk management framework \nincludes detailed policies that set specific firm -wide p rudential limits on the bank\u2019s activities, which \nare consistent with its risk taking appetite and capacity. In order to determine the overall risk \nappetite, the board and senior management must first have an understanding of risk exposures \n                                                            \n95 Master Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.73/21.06.001/2009 -10 dated Feb 8, 2010 . 128 \n on a firm -wide b asis. To achieve this understanding, the appropriate members of senior \nmanagement must bring together the perspectives of the key business and control functions. In \norder to develop an integrated firm -wide perspective on risk, senior management must overco me \norganisational silos between business lines and share information on market developments, risks \nand risk mitigation techniques. As the banking industry is exhibiting the tendency to move \nincreasingly towards market -based intermediation, there is a great er probability that many areas \nof a bank may be exposed to a common set of products, risk factors or counterparties. Senior \nmanagement should establish a risk management process that is not limited to credit, market, \nliquidity and operational risks, but in corporates all material risks. This includes reputational and \nstrategic risks, as well as risks that do not appear to be significant in isolation, but when combined \nwith other risks could lead to material losses . \nThe Board of Directors and senior managemen t should possess sufficient knowledge of all major \nbusiness lines to ensure that appropriate policies, controls and risk monitoring systems are \neffective. They should have the necessary expertise to understand the capital markets activities \nin which the ba nk is involved \u2013 such as securitisation and off -balance sheet activities \u2013 and the \nassociated risks. The board and senior management should remain informed on an on -going \nbasis about these risks as financial markets, risk management practices and the bank\u2019 s activities \nevolve. In addition, the board and senior management should ensure that accountability and lines \nof authority are clearly delineated. With respect to new or complex products and activities, senior \nmanagement should understand the underlying as sumptions regarding business models, \nvaluation and risk management practices. In addition, senior management should evaluate the \npotential risk exposure if those assumptions fail. Before embarking on new activities or introducing \nproducts new to the instit ution, the board and senior management should identify and review the \nchanges in firm -wide risks arising from these potential new products or activities and ensure that \nthe infrastructure and internal controls necessary to manage the related risks are in p lace. In this \nreview, a bank should also consider the possible difficulty in valuing the new products and how \nthey might perform in a stressed economic environment. The Board should ensure that the senior \nmanagement of the bank : \n(i) establishes a risk fram ework in order to assess and appropriately manage the various \nrisk exposures of the bank;  \n(ii) develops a system to monitor the bank's risk exposures and to relate them to the bank's \ncapital and reserve funds;  \n(iii) establishes a method to monitor the bank 's compliance with internal policies, particularly \nin regard to risk management; and  \n(iv) effectively communicates all r elevant policies and procedures throughout the bank.  \nA bank\u2019s risk function and its chief risk officer (CRO) or equivalent position shou ld be independent \nof the individual business lines and report directly to the chief executive officer (CEO) / Managing 129 \n Director and the institution\u2019s board of directors. In addition, the risk function should highlight to \nsenior management and the board ris k management concerns, such as risk concentrations and \nviolations of risk appetite limits.  Banks may refer to circular no. \nDBR.BP.BC.No.65/21.04.103/2016 -17 dated April 27 , 2017  on Risk Management Systems \u2013 \nRole of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) , as amended from time to time,  for, inter alia , the guidelines \non the Role of CRO.  \n12.3.3. 3 Policies, procedures, limits and controls:  \nThe structure, design and contents of a bank's ICAAP should be approved by the Board of \nDirectors to ensure that the ICAAP forms an integral part of the management process and \ndecision making culture of the bank. Firm -wide risk management programmes should include \ndetailed policies that set specific fi rm-wide prudential limits on the principal risks relevant to a \nbank\u2019s activities. A bank\u2019s policies and procedures should provide specific guidance for the \nimplementation of broad business strategies and should establish, where appropriate, internal \nlimits  for the various types of risk s to which the bank may be exposed. These limits should \nconsider the bank\u2019s role in the financial system and be defined in relation to the bank\u2019s capital, \ntotal assets, earnings or, where adequate measures exist, its overall r isk level . \nA bank\u2019s policies, procedures and limits sh all: \n\uf0b7 Provide for adequate and timely identification, measurement, monitoring, control and \nmitigation of the risks posed by its lending, investing, trading, securitisation, off -balance \nsheet, fiduciary a nd other significant activities at the business line and firm -wide levels;  \n\uf0b7 Ensure that the economic substance of a bank\u2019s risk exposures, including reputational risk \nand valuation uncertainty, are fully recognised and incorporated into the bank\u2019s risk \nmana gement processes;  \n\uf0b7 Be consistent with the bank\u2019s stated goals and objectives, as well as its overall financial \nstrength;  \n\uf0b7 Clearly delineate accountability and lines of authority across the bank\u2019s various business \nactivities, and ensure there is a clear separ ation between business lines and the risk \nfunction;  \n\uf0b7 Escalate and address breaches of internal position limits;  \n\uf0b7 Provide for the review of new businesses and products by bringing together all relevant \nrisk management, control and business lines to ensure tha t the bank is able to manage \nand control the activity prior to it being initiated; and  \n\uf0b7 Include a schedule and process for reviewing the policies, procedures and limits and for \nupdating them as appropriate.  \n \n 130 \n 12.3.3. 4 Identifying, measuring, monitoring and reporting of risk:  \n(i) A bank\u2019s MIS should provide the board and senior management in a clear and concise \nmanner with timely and relevant information concerning their institutions\u2019 risk profile. This \ninformation should include all risk exposures, including  those that are off -balance sheet. \nManagement should understand the assumptions behind and limitations inherent in specific risk \nmeasures.  \n(ii) The key elements necessary for the aggregation of risks are an appropriate infrastructure \nand MIS that (i) allow  for the aggregation of exposures and risk measures across business lines \nand (ii) support customised identification of concentrations and emerging risks. MIS developed to \nachieve this objective should support the ability to evaluate the impact of various types of \neconomic and financial shocks that affect the whole of the financial institution. Further, a bank\u2019s \nsystems should be flexible enough to incorporate hedging and other risk mitigation actions to be \ncarried out on a firm -wide basis while taking into  account the various related basis risks . \n(iii) To enable proactive management of risk, the board and senior management need to \nensure that MIS is capable of providing regular, accurate and timely information on the bank\u2019s \naggregate risk profile, as well a s the main assumptions used for risk aggregation. MIS should be \nadaptable and responsive to changes in the bank\u2019s underlying risk assumptions and should \nincorporate multiple perspectives of risk exposure to account for uncertainties in risk \nmeasurement. In  addition, it should be sufficiently flexible so that the institution can generate \nforward -looking bank -wide scenario analyses that capture management\u2019s interpretation of \nevolving market conditions and stressed conditions. Third -party inputs or other tools  used within \nMIS (e.g. , credit ratings, risk measures, models) should be subject to initial and ongoing \nvalidation . \n(iv) A bank\u2019s MIS should be capable of capturing limit breaches and there should be \nprocedures in place to promptly report such breaches to senior management, as well as to ensure \nthat appropriate follow -up actions are taken. For instance, similar exposures should be \naggregated across business platforms (including the banking and trading books) to determine \nwhether there is a concentration or a breach of an internal position limit . \n12.3.3. 5 Internal controls:  \nRisk management processes should be frequently monitored and tested by independent control \nareas and internal, as well as external, auditors. The aim is to ensure that the information on \nwhich decisions are based is accurate so that processes fully reflect management policies and \nthat regular reporting, including the reporting of limit breaches and other exception -based \nreporting, is undertaken effectively. The risk management function of b anks must be independent \nof the business lines in order to ensure an adequate separation of duties and to avoid conflicts of \ninterest.  131 \n Since a sound risk management process provides the basis for ensuring that a bank maintains \nadequate capital, the board o f directors of a bank shall set the tolerance level for risk.  \n12.3.3. 6 Submission of the outcome of the ICAAP to the Board and the RBI  \nAs the ICAAP is an ongoing process, a written record on the outcome of the ICAAP should be \nperiodically submitted by bank s to their board of directors. Such written record of the internal \nassessment of its capital adequacy should include, inter alia, the risks identified, the manner in \nwhich those risks are monitored and managed, the impact of the bank\u2019s changing risk profil e on \nthe bank\u2019s capital position, details of stress tests/scenario analysis conducted and the resultant \ncapital requirements. The reports shall be sufficiently detailed to allow the Board of Directors to \nevaluate the level and trend of material risk exposu res, whether the bank maintains adequate \ncapital against the risk exposures and in case of additional capital being needed, the plan for \naugmenting capital. The board of directors would be expected make timely adjustments to the \nstrategic plan, as necessar y. \nBased on the outcome of the ICAAP as submitted to and approved by the Board, the ICAAP \nDocument, in the format furnished at Annex 15 , should be furnished to the RBI (i.e., to the CGM -\nin-Charge, Department of Supervision, Central Office, Reserve Bank of India, World Trade \nCentre, Centre I, Colaba, Cuffe Parade, Mumbai \u2013 400 005 , with a copy addressed  to Senior \nSupervisory Manager of the bank ). The document should reach the RBI latest by end of the first \nquarter (i.e. , April-June) of the relevant financial  year.  \n12.4 Review of the ICAAP Outcomes  \nThe board of directors shall, at least once a year, assess and document whether the processes \nrelating to the ICAAP implemented by the bank successfully achieve the objectives envisaged by \nthe board. The senior mana gement should also receive and review the reports regularly to \nevaluate the sensitivity of the key assumptions and to assess the validity of the bank\u2019s estimated \nfuture capital requirements. In the light of such an assessment, appropriate changes in the IC AAP \nshould be instituted to ensure that the underlying objectives are effectively achieved . \n12.5 ICAAP to be an Integral part of the Management and Decision -making Culture  \nThe ICAAP should from an integral part of the management and decision -making culture  of a \nbank. This integration could range from using the ICAAP to internally allocate capital to various \nbusiness units, to having it play a role in the individual credit decision process and pricing of \nproducts or more general business decisions such as ex pansion plans and budgets. The \nintegration would also mean that ICAAP should enable the bank management to assess, on an \nongoing basis, the risks that are inherent in their activities and material to the institution . \n \n 132 \n 12.6 The Principle of Proportionality  \nThe implementation of ICAAP should be guided by the principle of proportionality. Though banks \nare encouraged to migrate to and adopt progressively sophisticated approaches in designing their \nICAAP, the RBI would expect the degree of sophistication adopte d in the ICAAP in regard to risk \nmeasurement and management to be commensurate with the nature, scope, scale and the \ndegree of complexity in the bank\u2019s business operations. The following paragraphs illustratively  \nenumerate the broad approach which could be  considered by banks with varying levels of \ncomplexity in their operations, in formulating their ICAAP . \n(A) In relation to a bank that defines its activities and risk management practices as simple , \nin carrying out its ICAAP, that bank could:  \n(a) identify and consider that bank\u2019s largest losses over the last 3 to 5 years and whether \nthose losses are likely to recur;  \n(b) prepare a short list of the most significant risks to which that bank is exposed;  \n(c) consider how that bank would act, and the amount of c apital that would be absorbed in \nthe event that each of the risks identified were to materialise;  \n(d) consider how that bank\u2019s capital requirement might alter under the scenarios in (c) and \nhow its capital requirement might alter in line with its business plans for the next 3 to 5 \nyears; and  \n(e) document the ranges of capital required in the scenarios identified above and form an \noverall view on the amount and quality of capital which that bank should hold, ensuring \nthat its senior management is involved in  arriving at that view.  \n(B) In relation to a bank that define its activities and risk management practices as moderately \ncomplex , in carrying out its ICAAP, that bank could:  \n(a) having consulted the operational management in each major business line, prepa re a \ncomprehensive list of the major risks to which the business is exposed;  \n(b) estimate, with the aid of historical data, where available, the range and distribution of \npossible losses which might arise from each of those risks and consider using shock \nstress tests to provide risk estimates;  \n(c) consider the extent to which that bank\u2019s capital requirement adequately captures the \nrisks identified in (a) and (b) above;  \n(d) for areas in which the capital requirement is either inadequate or does not address a  \nrisk, estimate the additional capital needed to protect that bank and its customers, in \naddition to any other risk mitigation action that bank plans to take;  133 \n (e) consider the risk that the bank\u2019s own analyses of capital adequacy may be inaccurate \nand that  it may suffer from management weaknesses which affect the effectiveness of \nits risk management and mitigation;  \n(f) project that bank\u2019s business activities forward in detail for one year and in less detail for \nthe next 3 to 5 years, and estimate how that b ank\u2019s capital and capital requirement would \nalter, assuming that business develops as expected;  \n(g) assume that business does not develop as expected and consider how that bank\u2019s \ncapital and capital requirement would alter and what that bank\u2019s reaction to a range of \nadverse economic scenarios might be;  \n(h) document the results obtained from the analyses in (b), (d), (f), and (g) above in a \ndetailed report for that bank\u2019s top management / board of directors; and  \n(i) ensure that systems and processes are in p lace to review the accuracy of the estimates \nmade in (b), (d), (f) and (g) (i.e., systems for back testing) vis -\u00e0-vis the performance / \nactuals.  \n(C) In relation to a bank that define its activities and risk management practices as complex , \nin carrying out its ICAAP, that bank could follow a proportional approach to that bank\u2019s ICAAP \nwhich should cover the issues identified at (a ) to (d) in paragraph (B) above  but is likely also to \ninvolve the use of models, most of which will be integrated into its day -to-day management and \noperations.  \nModels of the kind referred to above may be linked so as to generate an overall estimate of the \namount of capital that a bank considers appropriate to hold for its business needs. A bank may \nalso link such models to generate i nformation on the economic capital considered desirable for \nthat bank. A model which a bank uses to generate its target amount of economic capital is known \nas an economic capital model (ECM). Economic capital is the target amount of capital which \noptimises  the return for a bank\u2019s stakeholders for a desired level of risk. For example, a bank is \nlikely to use value -at-risk (VaR) models for market risk and advanced modelling approaches for \ncredit risk. A bank might also use economic scenario generators to mode l stochastically its \nbusiness forecasts and risks. However, banks shall take prior approval of the RBI for migrating to \nthe advanced approaches . \nSuch a bank is also likely to be part of a group and to be operating internationally. There is likely \nto be cen tralised control over the models used throughout the group, the assumptions made and \ntheir overall calibration.  \n12.7 Regular Independent Review and Validation  \nThe ICAAP should be subject to regular and independent review through an internal or external \naudit process, separately from the SREP conducted by the RBI, to ensure that the ICAAP is 134 \n comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scope, scale and level of complexity of the bank\u2019s \nactivities so that it accurately reflects the major sources of risk tha t the bank is exposed to. A bank \nshall ensure appropriate and effective internal control structures, particularly in regard to the risk \nmanagement processes, in order to monitor the bank\u2019s continued compliance with internal policies \nand procedures. As a mi nimum, a bank shall conduct periodic reviews of its risk management \nprocesses, which should ensure:  \n(a) the integrity, accuracy, and reasonableness of the processes;  \n(b) the appropriateness of the bank\u2019s capital assessment process based on the nature, \nscop e, scale and complexity of the bank\u2019s activities;  \n(c) the timely identification of any concentration risk;  \n(d) the accuracy and completeness of any data inputs into the bank\u2019s capital assessment \nprocess;  \n(e) the reasonableness and validity of any assumptio ns and scenarios used in the capital \nassessment process; and  \n(f) that the bank conducts appropriate stress testing;  \n12.8 ICAAP to be a Forward -looking Process  \nThe ICAAP should be forward looking in nature, and thus, should take into account the expected \n/ estimated future developments such as strategic plans, macro -economic factors, etc., including \nthe likely future constraints in the availability and use of capital. As a minimum, the management \nof a bank shall develop and maintain an appropriate strategy t hat would ensure that the bank \nmaintains adequate capital commensurate with the nature, scope, scale, complexity and risks \ninherent in the bank\u2019s on -balance -sheet and off -balance -sheet activities, and should demonstrate \nas to how the strategy dovetails wit h the macro -economic factors.  \nThus, banks shall have an explicit, Board -approved capital plan which should spell out the \ninstitution's objectives in regard to level of capital, the time horizon for achieving those objectives, \nand in broad terms, the capita l planning process and the allocate d responsibilities for that process.  \n12.9 ICAAP to be a Risk -based Process  \nThe adequacy of a bank\u2019s capital is a function of its risk profile. Banks shall, therefore, set their \ncapital targets which are consistent with t heir risk profile and operating environment. As a \nminimum, a bank shall have in place a sound ICAAP, which shall include all material  risk \nexposures incurred by the bank. There are some types of risks (such as reputation risk and \nstrategic risk) which are less readily quantifiable; for such risks, the focus of the ICAAP should be \nmore on qualitative assessment, risk management and mitigation than on quantification of such \nrisks. Banks\u2019 ICAAP document shall clearly indicate for which risks a quantitative mea sure is 135 \n considered warranted, and for which risks a qualitative measure is considered to be the correct \napproach . \n12.10  ICAAP to Include Stress Tests and Scenario Analyses  \nAs part of the ICAAP, the management of a bank shall, as a minimum, conduct relevant  stress \ntests periodically, particularly in respect of the bank\u2019s material risk exposures, in order to evaluate \nthe potential vulnerability of the bank to some unlikely but plausible events or movements in the \nmarket conditions that could have an adverse i mpact on the bank. The use of stress testing \nframework can provide a bank\u2019s management a better understanding of the bank\u2019s likely exposure \nin extreme circumstances. In this context, the attention is also invited to the RBI circular s \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.101/21.04.103/2006 -07 and DBOD.BP.BC.No.75/21.04.103/2013 -14 dated \nJune 26, 2007 and December 2, 2013, respectively on stress testing. The banks are urged to take \nnecessary measures for implementing an appropriate formal stress testing framework by the date \nspecified which would also meet the stress testing requirements under the ICAAP of the banks . \n12.11  Use of Capital Models for ICAAP  \nWhile the RBI does not expect the banks to use complex and sophisticated econometric models \nfor internal assessment of their capital requirements, and there is no RBI -mandated requirement \nfor adopting such models, th e banks, with international presence, were required96 to develop \nsuitable methodologies, by March 31, 2001, for estimating and maintaining economic capital. \nHowever, some of the banks, which have relatively complex operations and are adequately \nequipped in this regard, may like to place reliance on such models as part of their ICAAP. While \nthere is no single prescribed approach as to how a bank should develop its capital model, a bank \nadopting a model -based approach to its ICAAP shall be able to, inter alia , demonstrate : \n(a) Well documented model specifications, including the methodology / mechanics and the \nassumptions underpinning the working of the model;  \n(b) The extent of reliance on the historical data in the model and the system of back testing \nto be car ried out to assess the validity of the outputs of the model vis -\u00e0-vis the actual \noutcomes;  \n(c) A robust system for independent validation of the model inputs and outputs;  \n(d) A system of stress testing the model to establish that the model remains valid ev en \nunder extreme conditions / assumptions;  \n(e) The level of confidence assigned to the model outputs and its linkage to the bank\u2019s \nbusiness strategy;  \n                                                            \n96 In terms of  paragraph 17 of our Circular DBOD.No.BP(SC).BC. 98 / 21.04.103 / 99 dated October 7, 1999  136 \n (f) The adequacy of the requisite skills and resources within the banks to operate, maintain \nand develop t he model.  \n13. Select Operational Aspects of the ICAAP  \nThis Section outlines in somewhat greater detail the scope of the risk universe expected to be \nnormally captured by the banks in their ICAAP.  \n13.1 Identifying and Measuring Material Risks in ICAAP  \n(i) The first objective of an ICAAP is to identify all material risks. Risks that can be reliably \nmeasured and quantified should be treated as rigorously as data and methods allow. The \nappropriate means and methods to measure and quantify those material risks a re likely to \nvary across banks . \n(ii) Some of the risks to which banks are exposed include credit risk, market risk, operational \nrisk, interest rate risk in the banking book, credit concentration risk and liquidity risk (as \nbriefly outlined below). The RBI has issued guidelines to the banks on asset liability \nmanagement, management of country risk, credit risk, operational risk, etc., from time to \ntime. A bank\u2019s risk management processes, including its ICAAP, should, therefore, be \nconsistent with this existi ng body of guidance. However, certain other risks, such as \nreputational risk and business or strategic risk, may be equally important for a bank and, in \nsuch cases, should be given same consideration as the more formally defined risk types. \nFor example, a bank may be engaged in businesses for which periodic fluctuations in activity \nlevels, combined with relatively high fixed costs, have the potential to create unanticipated \nlosses that must be supported by adequate capital. Additionally, a bank might be inv olved \nin strategic activities (such as expanding business lines or engaging in acquisitions) that \nintroduce significant elements of risk and for which additional capital would be appropriate . \n(iii) Additionally, if banks employ risk mitigation techniques, they should understand the risk to \nbe mitigated and the potential effects of that mitigation, reckoning its enforceability and \neffectiveness, on the risk profile of the bank . \n13.2 Credit Risk97 \n13.2.1  Banks should have methodologies that enable them to asse ss the credit risk involved in \nexposures to individual borrowers or counterparties as well as at the portfolio level. Banks should \nbe particularly attentive to identifying credit risk concentrations and ensuring that their effects are \nadequately assessed. This should include consideration of various types of dependence among \nexposures, incorporating the credit risk effects of extreme outcomes, stress events, and shocks \nto the assumptions made about the portfolio and exposure behaviour. Banks should also car efully \nassess concentrations in counterparty credit exposures, including counterparty credit risk \n                                                            \n97 Annex 3 of the Guidelines on Implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India issued vide circular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -2012 dated May 2, 2012 . 137 \n exposures emanating from trading in less liquid markets, and determine the effect that these might \nhave on the bank\u2019s capital adequacy.  \n13.2.2  Banks sh ould assess exposures, regardless of wh ether they are rated or unrated98, and \ndetermine whether the risk weights applied to such exposures, under the Standardised Approach, \nare appropriate for their inherent risk. In those instances where a bank determines that th e \ninherent risk of such an exposure, particularly if it is unrated, is significantly higher than that \nimplied by the risk weight to which it is assigned, the bank should consider the higher degree of \ncredit risk in the evaluation of its overall capital ade quacy. For more sophisticated banks, the \ncredit review assessment of capital adequacy, at a minimum, should cover four areas: risk rating \nsystems, portfolio analysis/aggregation, securitisation/complex credit derivatives, and large \nexposures and risk conce ntrations . \n13.2.3  Counterparty credit risk (CCR)  \n(i) The bank must have counterparty credit risk management policies, processes and systems \nthat are conceptually sound and implemented with integrity relative to the sophistication and \ncomplexity of a bank\u2019s  holdings of exposures that give rise to counterparty credit risk (CCR). \nA sound counterparty credit risk management framework shall include the identification, \nmeasurement, management, approval and internal reporting of CCR . \n(ii) The bank\u2019s risk managemen t policies must take account of the market, liquidity and \noperational risks that can be associated with CCR and, to the extent practicable, \ninterrelationships among those risks. The bank must not undertake business with a \ncounterparty without assessing its  creditworthiness and must take due account of both \nsettlement and pre -settlement credit risk. These risks must be managed as comprehensively \nas practicable at the counterparty level (aggregating counterparty exposures with other \ncredit exposures) and at t he enterprise -wide level . \n(iii) The Board of directors and senior management must be actively involved in the CCR control \nprocess and must regard this as an essential aspect of the business to which significant \nresources need to be devoted. The daily repor ts prepared on a firm\u2019s exposures to CCR \nmust be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce \nboth reductions of positions taken by individual credit managers or traders and reductions \nin the bank\u2019s overall CCR expos ure. \n(iv) The bank\u2019s CCR management system must be used in conjunction with internal credit and \ntrading limits.  \n(v) The measurement of CCR must include monitoring daily and intra -day usage of credit lines. \nThe bank must measure current exposure gross and n et of collateral held where such \n                                                            \n98 In such cases it would be in order for banks to derive notional external ratings of the unrated exposure by mapping \ntheir internal credit risk ratings / grades of the ex posure used for pricing purposes with the external ratings scale.  138 \n measures are appropriate and meaningful (e.g. OTC derivatives, margin lending, etc.). \nMeasuring and monitoring peak exposure or potential future exposure (PFE), both the \nportfolio and counterparty levels is one element of a  robust limit monitoring system. Banks \nmust take account of large or concentrated positions, including concentrations by groups of \nrelated counterparties, by industry, by market, customer investment strategies, etc . \n(vi) The bank must have an appropriate s tress testing methodology in place to assess the \nimpact on the counterparty credit risk of abnormal volatilities in market variables driving the \ncounterparty exposures and changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparty. The results \nof this stress test ing must be reviewed periodically by senior management and must be \nreflected in the CCR policies and limits set by management and the board of directors. \nWhere stress tests reveal particular vulnerability to a given set of circumstances, \nmanagement should explicitly consider appropriate risk management strategies (e.g. by \nhedging against that outcome, or reducing the size of the firm\u2019s exposures).  \n(vii) The bank must have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a documented set of \ninternal policies,  controls and procedures concerning the operation of the CCR management \nsystem. The firm\u2019s CCR management system must be well documented, for example, \nthrough a risk management manual that describes the basic principles of the risk \nmanagement system and th at provides an explanation of the empirical techniques used to \nmeasure CCR . \n(viii) The bank must conduct an independent review of the CCR management system regularly \nthrough its own internal auditing process. This review must include both the activities of  the \nbusiness credit and trading units and of the independent CCR control unit. A review of the \noverall CCR management process must take place at regular intervals (ideally not less than \nonce a year) and must specifically address, at a minimum : \n\uf0b7 the adequac y of the documentation of the CCR management system and process;  \n\uf0b7 the organisation of the collateral management unit;  \n\uf0b7 the organisation of the CCR control unit;  \n\uf0b7 the integration of CCR measures into daily risk management;  \n\uf0b7 the approval process for risk pricing  models and valuation systems used by front and back - \noffice personnel;  \n\uf0b7 the validation of any significant change in the CCR measurement process;  \n\uf0b7 the scope of counterparty credit risks captured by the risk measurement model;  \n\uf0b7 the integrity of the management information system;  \n\uf0b7 the accuracy and completeness of CCR data;  \n\uf0b7 the accurate reflection of legal terms in collateral and netting agreements into exposure \nmeasurements; the verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data \nsources used to r un internal models, including the independence of such data sources;  139 \n \uf0b7 the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions;  \n\uf0b7 the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations; and  \n\uf0b7 the verification of the model\u2019s accuracy th rough frequent back -testing.  \n(ix) Banks should make an assessment as part of their ICAAP as to whether the bank\u2019s \nevaluation of the risks contained in the transactions that give rise to CCR and the bank\u2019s \nassessment of whether the Current Exposure Method ( CEM) captures those risks \nappropriately and satisfactorily. In cases where, under SREP, it is determined that CEM \ndoes not capture the risk inherent in the bank\u2019s relevant transactions (as could be the case \nwith structured, more complex OTC derivatives), R BI may require the bank to apply the CEM \non a transaction -by-transaction basis (i.e. , no netting will be recognized even if it is \npermissible legally).  \n13.3 Market Risk : A bank should be able to identify risks in trading activities resulting from a \nmovemen t in market prices. This determination should consider factors such as illiquidity of \ninstruments, concentrated positions, one -way markets, non -linear/deep out -of-the money \npositions, and the potential for significant shifts in correlations. Exercises that  incorporate extreme \nevents and shocks should also be tailored to capture key portfolio vulnerabilities to the relevant \nmarket developments . \n13.4 Operational Risk : A bank should be able to assess the potential risks resulting from \ninadequate or failed inte rnal processes, people, and systems, as well as from events external to \nthe bank. This assessment should include the effects of extreme events and shocks relating to \noperational risk. Events could include a sudden increase in failed processes across busine ss units \nor a significant incidence of failed internal controls . \n13.5 Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB):  A bank should identify the risks \nassociated with the changing interest rates on its on -balance sheet and off -balance sheet \nexposures in th e banking book from both, a short -term and long -term perspective. This might \ninclude the impact of changes due to parallel shocks, yield curve twists, yield curve inversions, \nchanges in the relationships of rates (basis risk), and other relevant scenarios.  The bank should \nbe able to support its assumptions about the behavioural characteristics of its non -maturity \ndeposits and other assets and liabilities, especially those exposures characterised by embedded \noptionality. Given the uncertainty in such assumpt ions, stress testing and scenario analysis \nshould be used in the analysis of interest rate risks. While there could be several approaches to \nmeasurement of IRRBB, an illustrative approach for measurement of IRRBB is furnished at \nAnnex 10 . The banks would, however, be free to adopt any other variant of these approaches or \nentirely different methodology for computing / quantifying the IRRBB provided the technique is \nbased on objective, verifiable and transparent methodology and criteria.  \n13.6 Credit Concentra tion Risk : A risk concentration is any single exposure or a group of \nexposures with the potential to produce losses large enough (relative to a bank\u2019s capital, total 140 \n assets, or overall risk level) to threaten a bank\u2019s health or ability to maintain its core  operations. \nRisk concentrations have arguably been the single most important cause of major problems in \nbanks. Concentration risk resulting from concentrated portfolios could be significant for most of \nthe banks . \nThe following qualitative criteria  could b e adopted by banks to demonstrate that the credit \nconcentration risk is being adequately addressed:  \n(a) While assessing the exposure to concentration risk, a bank should keep in view that the \ncalculations of Basel capital adequacy framework are based on th e assumption that a bank is \nwell diversified.  \n(b) While the banks\u2019 single borrower exposures, the group borrower exposures99 and capital \nmarket exposures are regulated by the exposure norms prescribed by the RBI, there could be \nconcentrations in these portf olios as well. In assessing the degree of credit concentration, \ntherefore, a bank shall consider not only the foregoing exposures but also consider the degree of \ncredit concentration in a particular economic sector or geographical area. Banks with operatio nal \nconcentration in a few geographical regions, by virtue of the pattern of their branch network, shall \nalso consider the impact of adverse economic developments in that region, and their impact on \nthe asset quality . \n(c) The performance of specialised por tfolios may, in some instances, also depend on key \nindividuals / employees of the bank. Such a situation could exacerbate the concentration risk \nbecause the skills of those individuals, in part, limit the risk arising from a concentrated portfolio. \nThe imp act of such key employees / individuals on the concentration risk is likely to be \ncorrespondingly greater in smaller banks. In developing its stress tests and scenario analyses, a \nbank shall, therefore, also consider the impact of losing key personnel on i ts ability to operate \nnormally, as well as the direct impact on its revenues . \nAs regards the quantitative criteria  to be used to ensure that credit concentration risk is being \nadequately addressed, the credit concentration risk calculations shall be perfor med at the \ncounterparty level (i.e., large exposures), at the portfolio level (i.e., sectoral and geographical \nconcentrations) and at the asset class level (i.e., liability and assets concentrations). In this \nregard, a reference is invited to paragraph 3.2 .2 (c) of the Annex to our Circular \nDBOD.No.BP.(SC).BC.98/21.04.103/ 99 dated October 7, 1999 regarding Risk Management \nSystem in Banks in terms of which certain prudential limits have been stipulated in regard to \n\u2018substantial exposures\u2019 of banks. As a pru dent practice, banks may like to ensure that their \naggregate exposure (including non -funded exposures) to all \u2018large borrowers\u2019 does not exceed at \nany time, 800 per cent of their \u2018capital funds\u2019 (as defined for the purpose of extant exposure norms \n                                                            \n99 Banks may refer to circular no. DBR.No.BP.BC.43/21.01.003/2016 -17 dated December 1, 2016  on Large Expo sures \nFramework, as amended from time to time, for guidelines on, inter alia , large exposure limits on single counterparty \nand group of connected counterparties.  141 \n of the R BI). The \u2018large borrower\u2019 for this purpose could be taken to mean as one to whom the \nbank\u2019s aggregate exposure (funded as well as non -funded) exceeds 10 per cent of the bank\u2019s \ncapital funds. The banks would also be well advised to pay special attention to their industry -wise \nexposures where their exposure to a particular industry exceeds 10 per cent of their aggregate \ncredit exposure (including investment exposure) to the industrial sector as a whole.  \nThere could be several approaches to the measurement of credit concentration the banks\u2019 \nportfolio. One of the approaches commonly used for the purpose involves computation of \nHerfindahl -Hirshman Index (HHI). It may please be noted that the HHI as a measure of \nconcentration risk is only one of the possible metho ds and the banks would be free to adopt any \nother appropriate method for the purpose, which has objective and transparent criteria for such \nmeasurement.  \nRisk concentrations should be analysed on both solo and consolidated basis100. Risk \nconcentrations should  be viewed in the context of a single or a set of closely related risk -drivers \nthat may have different impacts on a bank. These concentrations should be integrated when \nassessing a bank\u2019s overall risk exposure. A bank should consider concentrations that ar e based \non common or correlated risk factors that reflect more subtle or more situation -specific factors \nthan traditional concentrations, such as correlations between market, credit risks and liquidity risk.  \nThe growth of market -based intermediation has in creased the possibility that different areas of a \nbank are exposed to a common set of products, risk factors or counterparties. This has created \nnew challenges for risk aggregation and concentration management. Through its risk \nmanagement processes and MIS , a bank should be able to identify and aggregate similar risk \nexposures across the firm, including across legal entities, asset types (e.g. , loans, derivatives and \nstructured products), risk areas (e.g. , the trading book) and geographic regions. In additi on to the \nsituations described in para 13.6 (b) above, risk concentrations can arise include:  \n\uf0b7 exposures to a single counterparty, or gr oup of connected counterparties ; \n\uf0b7 exposures to both regulated and non -regulated financial institutions such as hedge funds  \nand private equity firms;  \n\uf0b7 trading exposures/market risk;  \no exposures to counterparties (e.g. , hedge funds and hedge counterparties) through \nthe execution or processing of transactions (either product or service);  \no funding sources;  \no assets that are held in the  banking book or trading book, such as loans, derivatives \nand structured products; and  \no off-balance sheet exposures, including guarantees, liquidity lines and other \ncommitments.  \n                                                            \n100 Master Cir cular DBOD.No.BP.BC.73/21.06.001/2009 -10 dated Feb 8, 2010 . 142 \n Risk concentrations can also arise through a combination of exposures across th ese broad \ncategories. A bank should have an understanding of its firm -wide risk concentrations resulting \nfrom similar exposures across its different business lines. Examples of such business lines \ninclude subprime exposure in lending books; counterparty ex posures; conduit exposures and \nSIVs; contractual and non -contractual exposures; trading activities; and underwriting pipelines. \nWhile risk concentrations often arise due to direct exposures to borrowers and obligors, a bank \nmay also incur a concentration t o a particular asset type indirectly through investments backed \nby such assets (e.g. , collateralised debt obligations \u2013 CDOs), as well as exposure to protection \nproviders guaranteeing the performance of the specific asset type (e.g. , monoline insurers). In  \nthis context, it may be noted that while banks in India are presently not allowed to pursue most of \nsuch business lines/assume most of such exposures without RBI\u2019s permission, their foreign \nbranches may have such exposures booked before issuance of circular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.89/21.04.141/2008 -09 dated December 1, 2008 . A bank should have in place \nadequate, systematic procedures for identifying high correlation between the cred itworthiness of \na protection provider and the obligors of the underlying exposures due to their performance being \ndependent on common factors beyond systematic risk (i.e. , \u201cwrong way risk\u201d) . \nProcedures should be in place to communicate risk concentrations to the board of directors and \nsenior management in a manner that clearly indicates where in the organisation each segment of \na risk concentration resides. A bank should have credible risk mitigation strategies in place that \nhave senior management approval.  This may include altering business strategies, reducing limits \nor increasing capital buffers in line with the desired risk profile. While it implements risk mitigation \nstrategies, the bank should be aware of possible concentrations that might arise as a r esult of \nemploying risk mitigation techniques.  \nBanks should employ a number of techniques, as appropriate, to measure risk concentrations. \nThese techniques include shocks to various risk factors; use of business level and firm -wide \nscenarios; and the use o f integrated stress testing and economic capital models. Identified \nconcentrations should be measured in a number of ways, including for example consideration of \ngross versus net exposures, use of notional amounts, and analysis of exposures with and withou t \ncounterparty hedges. A bank should establish internal position limits for concentrations to which \nit may be exposed. When conducting periodic stress tests a bank should incorporate all major \nrisk concentrations and identify and respond to potential chang es in market conditions that could \nadversely impact their performance and capital adequacy . \nThe assessment of such risks under a bank\u2019s ICAAP and the supervisory review process should \nnot be a mechanical process, but one in which each bank determines, depe nding on its business \nmodel, its own specific vulnerabilities. An appropriate level of capital for risk concentrations should \nbe incorporated in a bank\u2019s ICAAP, as well as in Pillar 2 assessments. Each bank should discuss \nsuch issues with its supervisor.  143 \n A bank should have in place effective internal policies, systems and controls to identify, measure, \nmonitor, manage, control and mitigate its risk concentrations in a timely manner. Not only should \nnormal market conditions be considered, but also the potent ial build -up of concentrations under \nstressed market conditions, economic downturns and periods of general market illiquidity. In \naddition, the bank should assess scenarios that consider possible concentrations arising from \ncontractual and non -contractual contingent claims. The scenarios should also combine the \npotential build -up of pipeline exposures together with the loss of market liquidity and a significant \ndecline in asset values . \n13.7 Liquidity Risk : A bank should understand the risks resulting from i ts inability to meet its \nobligations as they come due, because of difficulty in liquidating assets (market liquidity risk) or \nin obtaining adequate funding (funding liquidity risk). This assessment should include analysis of \nsources and uses of funds, an u nderstanding of the funding markets in which the bank operates, \nand an assessment of the efficacy of a contingency funding plan for events that could arise.  \nThe financial market crisis underscores the importance of assessing the potential impact of \nliquidi ty risk on capital adequacy in a bank\u2019s ICAAP101. Senior management should consider the \nrelationship between liquidity and capital since liquidity risk can impact capital adequacy which, \nin turn, can aggravate a bank\u2019s liquidity profile . \nIn September 2008, t he Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published Principles for Sound \nLiquidity Risk Management and Supervision, which stresses that banks need to have strong \nliquidity cushions in order to weather prolonged periods of financial market stress and illiqu idity. \nThe standards address many of the shortcomings experienced by the banking sector during the \nmarket turmoil that began in mid -2007, including those related to stress testing practices \ncontingency funding plans, management of on - and off -balance sheet  activity and contingent \ncommitments.  \nThis liquidity guidance outlines requirements for sound practices for the liquidity risk management \nof banks. The fundamental principle is that a bank should both assiduously manage its liquidity \nrisk and also maintain  sufficient liquidity to withstand a range of stress events. Liquidity is a critical \nelement of a bank\u2019s resilience to stress, and as such, a bank should maintain a liquidity cushion, \nmade up of unencumbered, high quality liquid assets, to protect against liquidity stress events, \nincluding potential losses of unsecured and typically available secured funding sources.  \nA key element in the management of liquidity risk is the need for strong governance of liquidity \nrisk, including the setting of a liquidity ri sk tolerance by the board. The risk tolerance should be \ncommunicated throughout the bank and reflected in the strategy and policies that senior \nmanagement set to manage liquidity risk. Another facet of liquidity risk management is that a bank \nshould approp riately price the costs, benefits and risks of liquidity into the internal pricing, \n                                                            \n101 Master Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.73/21.06.001/2009 -10 dated Feb 8, 2010 . 144 \n performance measurement, and new product approval process of all significant business \nactivities.  \nA bank is expected to be able to thoroughly identify, measure and control liquidity risks, especially \nwith regard to complex products and contingent commitments (both contractual and non -\ncontractual). This process should involve the ability to project cash flows arising from assets, \nliabilities and off -balance sheet items over v arious time horizons, and should ensure \ndiversification in both the tenor and source of funding. A bank should utilise early warning \nindicators to identify the emergence of increased risk or vulnerabilities in its liquidity position or \nfunding needs. It sh ould have the ability to control liquidity risk exposure and funding needs, \nregardless of its organisation structure, within and across legal entities, business lines, and \ncurrencies, taking into account any legal, regulatory and operational limitations to  the \ntransferability of liquidity.  \nA bank\u2019s failure to effectively manage intraday liquidity could leave it unable to meet its payment \nobligations at the time expected, which could lead to liquidity dislocations that cascade quickly \nacross many systems and  institutions. As such, the bank\u2019s management of intraday liquidity risks \nshould be considered as a crucial part of liquidity risk management. It should also actively manage \nits collateral positions and have the ability to calculate all of its collateral p ositions . \nWhile banks typically manage liquidity under \u201cnormal\u201d circumstances, they should also be \nprepared to manage liquidity under \u201cstressed\u201d conditions. A bank should perform stress tests or \nscenario analyses on a regular basis in order to identify and  quantify their exposures to possible \nfuture liquidity stresses, analysing possible impacts on the institutions\u2019 cash flows, liquidity \npositions, profitability, and solvency. The results of these stress tests should be discussed \nthoroughly by management, a nd based on this discussion, should form the basis for taking \nremedial or mitigating actions to limit the bank\u2019s exposures, build up a liquidity cushion, and adjust \nits liquidity profile to fit its risk tolerance. The results of stress tests should also pl ay a key role in \nshaping the bank\u2019s contingency funding planning, which should outline policies for managing a \nrange of stress events and clearly sets out strategies for addressing liquidity shortfalls in \nemergency situations.  \nAs public disclosure increase s certainty in the market, improves transparency, facilitates \nvaluation, and strengthens market discipline, it is important that banks publicly disclose \ninformation on a regular basis that enables market participants to make informed decisions about \nthe so undness of their liquidity risk management framework and liquidity position . \n13.8 Off-Balance Sheet Exposures and Securitisation Risk  \nBanks\u2019 use of securitisation has grown dramatically over the last several years. It has been used \nas an alternative source  of funding and as a mechanism to transfer risk to investors. While the \nrisks associated with securitisation are not new to banks, the recent financial turmoil highlighted \nunexpected aspects of credit risk, concentration risk, market risk, liquidity risk, legal risk and 145 \n reputational risk, which banks failed to adequately address. For instance, a number of banks that \nwere not contractually obligated to support sponsored securitisation structures were unwilling to \nallow those structures to fail due to concern s about reputational risk and future access to capital \nmarkets. The support of these structures exposed the banks to additional and unexpected credit, \nmarket and liquidity risk as they brought assets onto their balance sheets, which put significant \npressur e on their financial profile and capital ratios.  \nWeaknesses in banks\u2019 risk management of securitisation and off -balance sheet exposures \nresulted in large unexpected losses during the financial crisis. To help mitigate these risks, a \nbank\u2019s on - and off -balance sheet securitisation activities should be included in its risk \nmanagement disciplines, such as product approval, risk concentration limits, and estimates of \nmarket, credit and operational risk.  \nIn light of the wide range of risks arising from securitis ation activities, which can be compounded \nby rapid innovation in securitisation techniques and instruments, minimum capital requirements \ncalculated under Pillar 1 are often insufficient. All risks arising from securitisation, particularly \nthose that are no t fully captured under Pillar 1, should be addressed in a bank\u2019s ICAAP. These \nrisks include:  \n\uf0b7 Credit, market, liquidity and reputational risk of each exposure;  \n\uf0b7 Potential delinquencies and losses on the underlying securitised exposures;  \n\uf0b7 Exposures from credit  lines or liquidity facilities to special purpose entities;  \n\uf0b7 Exposures from guarantees provided by monolines and other third parties.  \nSecuritisation exposures should be included in the bank\u2019s MIS to help ensure that senior \nmanagement understands the implica tions of such exposures for liquidity, earnings, risk \nconcentration and capital. More specifically, a bank should have the necessary processes in place \nto capture in a timely manner, updated information on securitisation transactions including market \ndata,  if available, and updated performance data from the securitisation trustee or servicer . \n13.9 Reputati onal Risk and Implicit Support102 \n13.9.1 Provision of Implicit Support for Securitization Transactions  \n(i) Provision of implicit support to a transaction, w hether contractual (i.e. , credit \nenhancements provided at the inception of a securitised transaction) or non -contractual (implicit \nsupport) can take numerous forms. For instance, contractual support can include over \ncollateralisation, credit derivatives, s pread accounts, contractual recourse obligations, \nsubordinated notes, credit risk mitigants provided to a specific tranche, the subordination of fee \nor interest income or the deferral of margin income, and clean -up calls that exceed 10 percent of \nthe initi al issuance. Examples of implicit support include the purchase of deteriorating credit risk \n                                                            \n102 Annex 3 of the Guidelines on Implement ation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India issued vide circular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -2012 dated May 2, 2012 . 146 \n exposures from the underlying pool, the sale of discounted credit risk exposures into the pool of \nsecuritised credit risk exposures, the purchase of underlying expo sures at above market price or \nan increase in the first loss position according to the deterioration of the underlying exposures . \n(ii) The provision of implicit (or non -contractual) support, as opposed to contractual credit \nsupport (i.e. , credit enhancemen ts), raises significant supervisory concerns. For traditional \nsecuritisation structures the provision of implicit support undermines the clean break criteria, \nwhich when satisfied would allow banks to exclude the securitised assets from regulatory capital \ncalculations. For synthetic securitisation structures, it negates the significance of risk \ntransference. By providing implicit support, banks signal to the market that the risk is still with the \nbank and has not in effect been transferred. The institution\u2019 s capital calculation therefore \nunderstates the true risk. Accordingly, national supervisors are expected to take appropriate \naction when a banking organisation provides implicit support . \n(iii) When a bank has been found to provide implicit support to a se curitisation, it will be \nrequired to hold capital against all of the underlying exposures associated with the structure as if \nthey had not been securitised. It will also be required to disclose publicly that it was found to have \nprovided non -contractual su pport, as well as the resulting increase in the capital charge (as noted \nabove). The aim is to require banks to hold capital against exposures for which they assume the \ncredit risk, and to discourage them from providing non -contractual support . \n(iv) If a b ank is found to have provided implicit support on more than one occasion, the bank \nis required to disclose its transgression publicly and the Reserve Bank will take appropriate action \nthat may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following:  \n\uf0b7 The bank may be prevented from gaining favourable capital treatment on securitised \nassets for a period of time to be determined by the Reserve Bank;  \n\uf0b7 The bank may be required to hold capital against all securitised assets as though the bank \nhad created a com mitment to them, by applying a conversion factor to the risk weight of \nthe underlying assets;  \n\uf0b7 For purposes of capital calculations, the bank may be required to treat all securitised \nassets as if they remained on the balance sheet; and  \n\uf0b7 The bank may be requi red by the Reserve Bank to hold regulatory capital in excess of the \nminimum risk -based capital ratios.  \n(v) During the SREP, Reserve Bank will determine implicit support and may take appropriate \nsupervisory action to mitigate the effects. Pending any invest igation, the bank may be prohibited \nfrom any capital relief for planned securitisation transactions (moratorium). The action of Reserve \nBank will be aimed at changing the bank\u2019s behaviour with regard to the provision of implicit \nsupport, and to correct mar ket perception as to the willingness of the bank to provide future \nrecourse beyond contractual obligations.  \n 147 \n 13.9.2  Reputational Risk on Account of Implicit Support  \n(i) Reputational risk can be defined as the risk arising from negative perception on the pa rt \nof customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors, debt -holders, market analysts, other \nrelevant parties or regulators that can adversely affect a bank's ability to maintain existing, or \nestablish new, business relationships and continued access to sources of funding (e.g. through \nthe interbank or securitisation markets). Reputational risk is multidimensional and reflects the \nperception of other market participants. Furthermore, it exists throughout the organisation and \nexposure to reputational risk is essentially a function of the adequacy of the bank's internal risk \nmanagement processes, as well as the manner and efficiency with which management responds \nto external influences on bank -related transactions.  \n(ii) Reputational risk can lead to the prov ision of implicit support, which may give rise to credit, \nliquidity, market and legal risk - all of which can have a negative impact on a bank's earnings, \nliquidity and capital position. A bank should identify potential sources of reputational risk to whic h \nit is exposed. These include the bank's business lines, liabilities, affiliated operations, off -balance \nsheet vehicles and the markets in which it operates. The risks that arise should be incorporated \ninto the bank's risk management processes and appropr iately addressed in its ICAAP and liquidity \ncontingency plans.  \n(iii) Prior to the 2007 upheaval, many banks failed to recognise the reputational risk associated \nwith their off -balance sheet vehicles. In stressed conditions some firms went beyond their \ncontractual obligations to support their sponsored securitisations and off balance sheet vehicles. \nA bank should incorporate the exposures that could give rise to reputational risk into its \nassessments of whether the requirements under the securitisation frame work have been met and \nthe potential adverse impact of providing implicit support . \n(iv) Reputational risk may arise, for example, from a bank's sponsorship of securitisation \nstructures such as ABCP conduits and SIVs, as well as from the sale of credit expo sures to \nsecuritisation trusts. It may also arise from a bank's involvement in asset or funds management, \nparticularly when financial instruments are issued by owned or sponsored entities and are \ndistributed to the customers of the sponsoring bank. In the event that the instruments were not \ncorrectly priced or the main risk drivers not adequately disclosed, a sponsor may feel some \nresponsibility to its customers, or be economically compelled, to cover any losses. Reputational \nrisk also arises when a bank sp onsors activities such as money market mutual funds, in -house \nhedge funds and real estate investment trusts. In these cases, a bank may decide to support the \nvalue of shares / units held by investors even though is not contractually required to provide the  \nsupport.  \n(v) The financial market crisis has provided several examples of banks providing financial \nsupport that exceeded their contractual obligations. In order to preserve their reputation, some \nbanks felt compelled to provide liquidity support to their  SIVs, which was beyond their contractual 148 \n obligations. In other cases, banks purchased ABCP issued by vehicles they sponsored in order \nto maintain market liquidity. As a result, these banks assumed additional liquidity and credit risks, \nand also put pressu re on capital ratios . \n(vi) Reputational risk also may affect a bank's liabilities, since market confidence and a bank's \nability to fund its business are closely related to its reputation. For instance, to avoid damaging its \nreputation, a bank may call its liabilities even though this might negatively affect its liquidity profile. \nThis is particularly true for liabilities that are components of regulatory capital, such as hybrid / \nsubordinated debt. In such cases, a bank's capital position is likely to suffe r. \n(vii) Bank management should have appropriate policies in place to identify sources of \nreputational risk when entering new markets, products or lines of activities. In addition, a bank's \nstress testing procedures should take account of reputational risk  so management has a firm \nunderstanding of the consequences and second round effects of reputational risk . \n(viii) Once a bank identifies potential exposures arising from reputational concerns, it should \nmeasure the amount of support it might have to provid e (including implicit support of \nsecuritisations) or losses it might experience under adverse market conditions. In particular, in \norder to avoid reputational damages and to maintain market confidence, a bank should develop \nmethodologies to measure as prec isely as possible the effect of reputational risk in terms of other \nrisk types (e .g., credit, liquidity, market or operational risk) to which it may be exposed. This could \nbe accomplished by including reputational risk scenarios in regular stress tests. Fo r instance, \nnon-contractual off -balance sheet exposures could be included in the stress tests to determine \nthe effect on a bank's credit, market and liquidity risk profiles. Methodologies also could include \ncomparing the actual amount of exposure carried o n the balance sheet versus the maximum \nexposure amount held off -balance sheet, that is, the potential amount to which the bank could be \nexposed . \n(ix) A bank should pay particular attention to the effects of reputational risk on its overall \nliquidity positi on, taking into account both possible increases in the asset side of the balance sheet \nand possible restrictions on funding, should the loss of reputation result in various counterparties' \nloss of confidence . \n(x) In contrast to contractual credit exposures , such as guarantees, implicit support is a more \nsubtle form of exposure. Implicit support arises when a bank provides post -sale support to a \nsecuritisation transaction in excess of any contractual obligation. Implicit support may include any \nletter of com fort provided by the originator in respect of the present or future liabilities of the SPV. \nSuch non -contractual support exposes a bank to the risk of loss, such as loss arising from \ndeterioration in the credit quality of the securitisation's underlying as sets.  \n(xi) By providing implicit support, a bank signals to the market that all of the risks inherent in \nthe securitised assets are still held by the organisation and, in effect, had not been transferred. \nSince the risk arising from the potential provision  of implicit support is not captured ex ante under 149 \n Pillar 1, it must be considered as part of the Pillar 2 process. In addition, the processes for \napproving new products or strategic initiatives should consider the potential provision of implicit \nsupport a nd should be incorporated in a bank's ICAAP . \n13.10  Risk Evaluation and Management  \nA bank should conduct analyses of the underlying risks when investing in the structured products \n(permitted by RBI) and must not solely rely on the external credit ratings as signed to securitisation \nexposures by the credit rating agencies. A bank should be aware that external ratings are a useful \nstarting point for credit analysis, but are no substitute for full and proper understanding of the \nunderlying risk, especially where  ratings for certain asset classes have a short history or have \nbeen shown to be volatile. Moreover, a bank also should conduct credit analysis of the \nsecuritisation exposure at acquisition and on an ongoing basis. It should also have in place the \nnecessar y quantitative tools, valuation models and stress tests of sufficient sophistication to \nreliably assess all relevant risks.  \nWhen assessing securitisation exposures, a bank should ensure that it fully understands the credit \nquality and risk characteristics of the underlying exposures in structured credit transactions, \nincluding any risk concentrations. In addition, a bank should review the maturity of the exposures \nunderlying structured credit transactions relative to the issued liabilities in order to asses s \npotential maturity mismatches .  \nA bank should track credit risk in securitisation exposures at the transaction level and across \nsecuritisations exposures within each business line and across business lines. It should produce \nreliable measures of aggregat e risk. A bank also should track all meaningful concentrations in \nsecuritisation exposures, such as name, product or sector concentrations, and feed this \ninformation to firm -wide risk aggregation systems that track, for example, credit exposure to a \npartic ular obligor.  \nA bank\u2019s own assessment of risk needs to be based on a comprehensive understanding of the \nstructure of the securitisation transaction. It should identify the various types of triggers, credit \nevents and other legal provisions that may affect the performance of its on - and off -balance sheet \nexposures and integrate these triggers and provisions into its funding/liquidity, credit and balance \nsheet management. The impact of the events or triggers on a bank\u2019s liquidity and capital position \nshould a lso be considered.  \nBanks globally, either underestimated or did not anticipate that a market -wide disruption could \nprevent them from securitising warehoused or pipeline exposures and did not anticipate the effect \nthis could have on liquidity, earnings and capital adequacy. As part of its risk management \nprocesses, a bank should consider and, where appropriate, mark -to-market warehoused \npositions, as well as those in the pipeline, regardless of the probability of securitising the \nexposures. It should conside r scenarios which may prevent it from securitising its assets as part 150 \n of its stress testing and identify the potential effect of such exposures on its liquidity, earnings and \ncapital adequacy . \nA bank should develop prudent contingency plans specifying how it would respond to funding, \ncapital and other pressures that arise when access to securitisation markets is reduced. The \ncontingency plans should also address how the bank would address valuation challenges for \npotentially illiquid positions held for sale  or for trading. The risk measures, stress testing results \nand contingency plans should be incorporated into the bank\u2019s risk management processes and \nits ICAAP, and should result in an appropriate level of capital under Pillar 2 in excess of the \nminimum re quirements.  \nA bank that employs risk mitigation techniques should fully understand the risks to be mitigated, \nthe potential effects of that mitigation and whether or not the mitigation is fully effective. This is to \nhelp ensure that the bank does not under state the true risk in its assessment of capital. In \nparticular, it should consider whether it would provide support to the securitisation structures in \nstressed scenarios due to the reliance on securitisation as a funding tool . \n13.11  Valuation Practices  \nThe characteristics of complex structured products, including securitisation transactions, make \ntheir valuation inherently difficult due, in part, to the absence of active and liquid markets, the \ncomplexity and uniqueness of the cash waterfalls, and the lin ks between valuations and \nunderlying risk factors. As mentioned earlier, banks in India are presently not allowed to assume \nsuch exposures without RBI\u2019s permission. However, their foreign branches may have such \nexposures booked before issuance of circular DBOD.No. BP.BC.89/21.04.141/2008 -09 dated \nDecember 1, 2008 . The absence of a transparent price from a liquid market means that the \nvaluation must rely on models or proxy -pricing methodologies, as well as on expert judgment. The \noutputs of such models and processes are highly sensitive to the inputs and parameter \nassumptions adopted, which may themselves be subject to estimation error and uncertainty. \nMoreover, calibration o f the valuation methodologies is often complicated by the lack of readily \navailable benchmarks. Therefore, a bank is expected to have adequate governance structures \nand control processes for fair valuing exposures for risk management and financial reportin g \npurposes. The valuation governance structures and related processes should be embedded in \nthe overall governance structure of the bank, and consistent for both risk management and \nreporting purposes. The governance structures and processes are expected t o explicitly cover \nthe role of the board and senior management. In addition, the board should receive reports from \nsenior management on the valuation oversight and valuation model performance issues that are \nbrought to senior management for resolution, as well as all significant changes to valuation \npolicies.  \nA bank should also have clear and robust governance structures for the production, assignment \nand verification of financial instrument valuations. Policies should ensure that the approvals of all 151 \n valua tion methodologies are well documented. In addition, policies and procedures should set \nforth the range of acceptable practices for the initial pricing, marking -to-market/model, valuation \nadjustments and periodic independent revaluation. New product approv al processes should \ninclude all internal stakeholders relevant to risk measurement, risk control, and the assignment \nand verification of valuations of financial instruments . \nA bank\u2019s control processes for measuring and reporting valuations should be consis tently applied \nacross the firm and integrated with risk measurement and management processes. In particular, \nvaluation controls should be applied consistently across similar instruments (risks) and consistent \nacross business lines (books). These controls s hould be subject to internal audit. Regardless of \nthe booking location of a new product, reviews and approval of valuation methodologies must be \nguided by a minimum set of considerations. Furthermore, the valuation/new product approval \nprocess should be su pported by a transparent, well -documented inventory of acceptable valuation \nmethodologies that are specific to products and businesses.  \nIn order to establish and verify valuations for instruments and transactions in which it engages, a \nbank must have adequ ate capacity, including during periods of stress. This capacity should be \ncommensurate with the importance, riskiness and size of these exposures in the context of the \nbusiness profile of the institution. In addition, for those exposures that represent mat erial risk, a \nbank is expected to have the capacity to produce valuations using alternative methods in the \nevent that primary inputs and approaches become unreliable, unavailable or not relevant due to \nmarket discontinuities or illiquidity. A bank must tes t and review the performance of its models \nunder stress conditions so that it understands the limitations of the models under stress \nconditions.  \nThe relevance and reliability of valuations is directly related to the quality and reliability of the \ninputs. A  bank is expected to apply the accounting guidance provided to determine the relevant \nmarket information and other factors likely to have a material effect on an instrument's fair value \nwhen selecting the appropriate inputs to use in the valuation process.  Where values are \ndetermined to be in an active market, a bank should maximise the use of relevant observable \ninputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs when estimating fair value using a valuation \ntechnique. However, where a market is deemed inact ive, observable inputs or transactions may \nnot be relevant, such as in a forced liquidation or distress sale, or transactions may not be \nobservable, such as when markets are inactive. In such cases, accounting fair value guidance \nprovides assistance on wha t should be considered, but may not be determinative. In assessing \nwhether a source is reliable and relevant, a bank should consider, among other things : \n\uf0b7 the frequency and availability of the prices/quotes;  \n\uf0b7 whether those prices represent actual regularly o ccurring transactions on an arm's length \nbasis;  \n\uf0b7 the breadth of the distribution of the data and whether it is generally available to the \nrelevant participants in the market;  152 \n \uf0b7 the timeliness of the information relative to the frequency of valuations;  \n\uf0b7 the num ber of independent sources that produce the quotes/prices;  \n\uf0b7 whether the quotes/prices are supported by actual transactions;  \n\uf0b7 the maturity of the market; and  \n\uf0b7 the similarity between the financial instrument sold in a transaction and the instrument \nheld by the institution.  \nA bank\u2019s external reporting should provide timely, relevant, reliable and decision useful \ninformation that promotes transparency. Senior management should consider whether \ndisclosures around valuation uncertainty can be made more meaningful. F or instance, the bank \nmay describe the modelling techniques and the instruments to which they are applied; the \nsensitivity of fair values to modelling inputs and assumptions; and the impact of stress scenarios \non valuations. A bank should regularly review its disclosure policies to ensure that the information \ndisclosed continues to be relevant to its business model and products and to current market \nconditions . \n13.12  Sound Stress Testing Practices  \nStress testing is an important tool that is used by banks as  part of their internal risk management \nthat alerts bank management to adverse unexpected outcomes related to a broad variety of risks, \nand provides an indication to banks of how much capital might be needed to absorb losses should \nlarge shocks occur. More over, stress testing supplements other risk management approaches \nand measures. It plays a particularly important role in:  \n\uf0b7 providing forward looking assessments of risk,  \n\uf0b7 overcoming limitations of models and historical data,  \n\uf0b7 supporting internal and external  communication,  \n\uf0b7 feeding into capital and liquidity planning procedures,  \n\uf0b7 informing the setting of a banks\u2019 risk tolerance,  \n\uf0b7 addressing existing or potential, firm -wide risk concentrations, and  \n\uf0b7 facilitating the development of risk mitigation or contingency pl ans across a range of \nstressed conditions.  \nStress testing is especially important after long periods of benign risk, when the fading memory \nof negative economic conditions can lead to complacency and the underpricing of risk, and when \ninnovation leads to t he rapid growth of new products for which there is limited or no loss data.  \nIt should be recognised that improvements in stress testing alone cannot address all risk \nmanagement weaknesses, but as part of a comprehensive approach, stress testing has a leadi ng \nrole to play in strengthening bank corporate governance and the resilience of individual banks \nand the financial system.  153 \n Stress testing should form an integral part of the overall governance and risk management culture \nof the bank. Board and senior mana gement involvement in setting stress testing objectives, \ndefining scenarios, discussing the results of stress tests, assessing potential actions and decision \nmaking is critical in ensuring the appropriate use of stress testing in banks\u2019 risk governance and  \ncapital planning. Senior management should take an active interest in the development in, and \noperation of, stress testing. The results of stress tests should contribute to strategic decision \nmaking and foster internal debate regarding assumptions, such a s the cost, risk and speed with \nwhich new capital could be raised or that positions could be hedged or sold. Board and senior \nmanagement involvement in the stress testing program is essential for its effective operation.  \nA bank\u2019s capital planning process s hould incorporate rigorous; forward looking stress testing that \nidentifies possible events or changes in market conditions that could adversely impact the bank. \nBanks, under their ICAAPs should examine future capital resources and capital requirements \nunde r adverse scenarios. In particular, the results of forward -looking stress testing should be \nconsidered when evaluating the adequacy of a bank\u2019s capital buffer. Capital adequacy should be \nassessed under stressed conditions against a variety of capital ratio s, including regulatory ratios, \nas well as ratios based on the bank\u2019s internal definition of capital resources. In addition, the \npossibility that a crisis impairs the ability of even very healthy banks to raise funds at reasonable \ncost should be considered . \nA bank should develop methodologies to measure the effect of reputational risk in terms of other \nrisk types, namely credit, liquidity, market and other risks that they may be exposed to in order to \navoid reputational damages and in order to maintain mark et confidence. This could be done by \nincluding reputational risk scenarios in regular stress tests. For instance, including non -\ncontractual off -balance sheet exposures in the stress tests to determine the effect on a bank\u2019s \ncredit, market and liquidity ris k profiles.  \nA bank should carefully assess the risks with respect to commitments to off -balance sheet \nvehicles and third -party firms related to structured credit securities and the possibility that assets \nwill need to be taken on balance sheet for reputati onal reasons. Therefore, in its stress testing \nprogramme, a bank should include scenarios assessing the size and soundness of such vehicles \nand firms relative to its own financial, liquidity and regulatory capital positions. This analysis \nshould include st ructural, solvency, liquidity and other risk issues, including the effects of \ncovenants and triggers . \n13.13  Sound Compensation Practices  \nRisk management must be embedded in the culture of a bank. It should be a critical focus of the \nCEO/Managing Director, Chief Risk Officer (CRO), senior management, trading desk and other \nbusiness line heads and employees in making strategic and day -to-day decisions. For a broad \nand deep risk management culture to develop and be maintained over time, compensation \npolicies m ust not be unduly linked to short -term accounting profit generation. Compensation 154 \n policies should be linked to longer -term capital preservation and the financial strength of the firm, \nand should consider risk -adjusted performance measures. In addition, a b ank should provide \nadequate disclosure regarding its compensation policies to stakeholders. Each bank\u2019s board of \ndirectors and senior management have the responsibility to mitigate the risks arising from \nremuneration policies in order to ensure effective f irm-wide risk management.  \nCompensation practices at large financial institutions are one factor among many that contributed \nto the financial crisis that began in 2007. High short -term profits led to generous bonus payments \nto employees without adequate reg ard to the longer -term risks they imposed on their firms. These \nincentives amplified the excessive risk -taking that has threatened the global financial system and \nleft firms with fewer resources to absorb losses as risks materialised. The lack of attention  to risk \nalso contributed to the large, in some cases extreme absolute level of compensation in the \nindustry. As a result, to improve compensation practices and strengthen supervision in this area, \nparticularly for systemically important firms, the Financi al Stability Board (formerly the Financial \nStability Forum) published its Principles for Sound Compensation Practices in April 2009 . \nA bank\u2019s board of directors must actively oversee the compensation system\u2019s design and \noperation, which should not be contr olled primarily by the chief executive officer and management \nteam. Relevant board members and employees must have independence and expertise in risk \nmanagement and compensation. In addition, the board of directors must monitor and review the \ncompensation system to ensure the system includes adequate controls and operates as intended. \nThe practical operation of the system should be regularly reviewed to ensure compliance with \npolicies and procedures. Compensation outcomes, risk measurements, and risk outcom es should \nbe regularly reviewed for consistency with intentions.  \nStaff that are engaged in the financial and risk control areas must be independent, have \nappropriate authority, and be compensated in a manner that is independent of the business areas \nthey o versee and commensurate with their key role in the firm. Effective independence and \nappropriate authority of such staff is necessary to preserve the integrity of financial and risk \nmanagement\u2019s influence on incentive compensation.  \nCompensation must be adju sted for all types of risk so that remuneration is balanced between \nthe profit earned and the degree of risk assumed in generating the profit. In general, both \nquantitative measures and human judgment should play a role in determining the appropriate risk \nadjustments, including those that are difficult to measure such as liquidity risk and reputation risk.  \nCompensation outcomes must be symmetric with risk outcomes and compensation systems \nshould link the size of the bonus pool to the overall performance of the firm. Employees\u2019 incentive \npayments should be linked to the contribution of the individual and business to the firm\u2019s overall \nperformance.  \nCompensation payout schedules must be sensitive to the time horizon of risks. Profits and losses \nof different act ivities of a financial firm are realised over different periods of time. Variable 155 \n compensation payments should be deferred accordingly. Payments should not be finalised over \nshort periods where risks are realised over long periods. Management should questi on payouts \nfor income that cannot be realised or whose likelihood of realisation remains uncertain at the time \nof payout . \nThe mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation must be consistent with risk alignment. \nThe mix will vary depending on the emp loyee\u2019s position and role. The firm should be able to \nexplain the rationale for its mix.  \nRBI will review compensation practices in a rigorous and sustained manner and deficiencies, if \nany, will be addressed promptly with the appropriate supervisory action.  \n13.14  The risk factors discussed above should not be considered an exhaustive list  of those \naffecting any given bank. All relevant factors that present a material source of risk to capital should \nbe incorporated in a well -developed ICAAP. Furthermore, ban ks should be mindful of the capital \nadequacy effects of concentrations that may arise within each risk type . \n13.15  Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches in ICAAP  \n(a) All measurements of risk incorporate both quantitative and qualitative elements, but to the \nextent possible, a quantitative approach should form the foundation of a bank\u2019s measurement \nframework. In some cases, quantitative tools can include the use of large historical databases; \nwhen data are more scarce, a bank may choose to rely more heavil y on the use of stress testing \nand scenario analyses. Banks should understand when measuring risks that measurement error \nalways exists, and in many cases the error is itself difficult to quantify. In general, an increase in \nuncertainty related to modeling  and business complexity should result in a larger capital cushion . \n(b) Quantitative approaches that focus on most likely outcomes for budgeting, forecasting, or \nperformance measurement purposes may not be fully applicable for capital adequacy because \nthe ICAAP should also take less likely events into account. Stress testing and scenario analysis \ncan be effective in gauging the consequences of outcomes that are unlikely but would have a \nconsiderable impact on safety and soundness . \n(c) To the extent that ris ks cannot be reliably measured with quantitative tools \u2013 for example, \nwhere measurements of risk are based on scarce data or unproven quantitative methods \u2013 \nqualitative tools, including experience and judgment, may be more heavily utilised. Banks should \nbe cognisant that qualitative approaches have their own inherent biases and assumptions that \naffect risk assessment; accordingly, banks should recognise the biases and assumptions \nembedded in, and the limitations of, the qualitative approaches used . \n13.16  Risk Aggregation and Diversification Effects  \n(a) An effective ICAAP should assess the risks across the entire bank. A bank choosing to \nconduct risk aggregation among various risk types or business lines should understand the 156 \n challenges in such aggregation. I n addition, when aggregating risks, banks should ensure that \nany potential concentrations across more than one risk dimension are addressed, recognising \nthat losses could arise in several risk dimensions at the same time, stemming from the same \nevent or a common set of factors. For example, a localised natural disaster could generate losses \nfrom credit, market, and operational risks at the same time . \n(b) In considering the possible effects of diversification, management should be systematic \nand rigorous in documenting decisions, and in identifying assumptions used in each level of risk \naggregation. Assumptions about diversification should be supported by analysis and evidence. \nThe bank should have systems capable of aggregating risks based on the bank\u2019s sele cted \nframework. For example, a bank calculating correlations within or among risk types should \nconsider data quality and consistency, and the volatility of correlations over time and under \nstressed market conditions . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 157 \n  \nPart C: Market Disci pline  \n14. Guidelines for Market Discipline  \n14.1 General  \n14.1.1  The purpose of Market discipline is to complement the minimum capital requirements \n(detailed under Pillar 1) and the supervisory review process (detailed under Pillar 2). The aim is \nto encour age market discipline by developing a set of disclosure requirements which will allow \nmarket participants to assess key pieces of information on the scope of application, capital, risk \nexposures, risk assessment processes and hence, the capital adequacy of  the institution .  \n14.1.2  In principle, banks\u2019 disclosures should be consistent with how senior management and the \nBoard of Directors assess and manage the risks of the bank. Under Pillar 1, banks use specified \napproaches / methodologies for measuring the various risks they face and the resulting capital \nrequirements. It is believed that providing disclosures that are based on a common framework is \nan effective means of informing the market about a bank\u2019s exposure to those risks and provides \na consistent an d comprehensive disclosure framework that enhances comparability .  \n14.2 Achieving Appropriate Disclosure  \n14.2.1 Market discipline can contribute to a safe and sound banking environment. Hence, non -\ncompliance with the prescribed disclosure requirements wou ld attract a penalty, including \nfinancial penalty. However, it is not intended that direct additional capital requirements would be \na response to non -disclosure, except as indicated below.  \n14.2.2 In addition to the general intervention measures, the Basel Capital Adequacy Framework \nalso anticipates a role for specific measures. Where disclosure is a qualifying criterion under Pillar \n1 to obtain lower risk weightings and/or to apply specific methodologies, there would be a direct \nsanction (not being allowed to apply the lower risk weighting or the specific methodology).   \n14.3 Interaction with Accounting Disclosures  \nIt is recognised that the Pillar 3 disclosure framework does not conflict with requirements under \naccounting standards, which are broader in scop e. The BCBS has taken considerable efforts to \nsee that the narrower focus of Pillar 3, which is aimed at disclosure of bank capital adequacy, \ndoes not conflict with the broader accounting requirements. The Reserve Bank will consider future \nmodifications to  the Market Discipline disclosures as necessary in light of its ongoing monitoring \nof this area and industry developments.   \n14.4 Validation  \nThe disclosures in this manner should be subjected to adequate validation. For example, since \ninformation in the an nual financial statements would generally be audited, the additional material 158 \n published with such statements must be consistent with the audited statements. In addition, \nsupplementary material (such as Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis) that is publishe d \nshould also be subjected to sufficient scrutiny (e.g. , internal control assessments, etc.) to satisfy \nthe validation issue. If material is not published under a validation regime, for instance in a stand -\nalone report or as a section on a website, then ma nagement should ensure that appropriate \nverification of the information takes place, in accordance with the general disclosure principle set \nout below. In the light of the above, Pillar 3 disclosures will not be required to be audited by an \nexternal audito r, unless specified .  \n14.5 Materiality  \nA bank should decide which disclosures are relevant for it based on the materiality concept. \nInformation would be regarded as material if its omission or misstatement could change or \ninfluence the assessment or decis ion of a user relying on that information for the purpose of \nmaking economic decisions. This definition is consistent with International Accounting Standards \nand with the national accounting framework. The Reserve Bank recognises the need for a \nqualitative  judgment of whether, in light of the particular circumstances, a user of financial \ninformation would consider the item to be material (user test). The Reserve Bank does not \nconsider it necessary to set specific thresholds for disclosure as the user test i s a useful \nbenchmark for achieving sufficient disclosure. However, with a view to facilitate smooth transition \nto greater disclosures as well as to promote greater comparability among the banks\u2019 Pillar 3 \ndisclosures, the materiality thresholds have been pr escribed for certain limited disclosures. \nNotwithstanding the above, banks are encouraged to apply the user test to these specific \ndisclosures and where considered necessary make disclosures below the specified thresholds \nalso.  \n14.6 Proprietary and Confid ential Information  \nProprietary information encompasses information (for example on products or systems), that if \nshared with competitors would render a bank\u2019s investment in these products/systems less \nvaluable, and hence would undermine its competitive po sition. Information about customers is \noften confidential, in that it is provided under the terms of a legal agreement or counterparty \nrelationship. This has an impact on what banks should reveal in terms of information about their \ncustomer base, as well a s details on their internal arrangements, for instance methodologies \nused, parameter estimates, data etc. The Reserve Bank believes that the requirements set out \nbelow strike an appropriate balance between the need for meaningful disclosure and the \nprotect ion of proprietary and confidential information .  \n14.7 General Disclosure Principle  \nBanks should have a formal disclosure policy approved by the Board of directors that addresses \nthe bank\u2019s approach for determining what disclosures it will make and the in ternal controls over 159 \n the disclosure process. In addition, banks should implement a process for assessing the \nappropriateness of their disclosures, including validation and frequency . \n14.8 Implementation Date  \nIn terms of Guidelines on Composition of Capita l Disclosure Requirements issued vide circular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2012 -13 dated May 28, 2013 , Pillar 3 disclosures as introduced \nunder Basel III have become effect ive from July 1, 2013. The first set of disclosures as required \nby these guidelines was to be made by banks as on September 30, 2013.  \n14.9 Scope and Frequency of Disclosures  \n14.9.1 Pillar 3 applies at the top consolidated level of the banking group to whi ch the Capital \nAdequacy Framework applies. Disclosures related to individual banks within the groups would not \ngenerally be required to be made by the parent bank. An exception to this arises in the disclosure \nof capital ratios by the top consolidated enti ty where an analysis of significant bank subsidiaries \nwithin the group is appropriate, in order to recognise the need for these subsidiaries to comply \nwith the Framework and other applicable limitations on the transfer of funds or capital within the \ngroup.  Pillar 3 disclosures will be required to be made by the individual banks on a stand -alone \nbasis when they are not the top consolidated entity in the banking group.  \n14.9.2 Banks are required to make Pillar 3 disclosures103 at least on a half yearly basis, \nirrespective of whether financial statements are audited, with the exception of following \ndisclosures :  \n(i) Table DF -2: Capital Adequacy;  \n(ii) Table DF -3: Credit Risk: General Disclosures for All Banks; and  \n(iii) Table DF -4: Credit Risk: Disclosures for Po rtfolios Subject to the Standardised \nApproach.  \nThe disclosures as indicated at (i), (ii) and (iii) above will be made at least on a quarterly basis by \nbanks.  \n14.9.3 All disclosures must either be included in a bank\u2019s published financial results / statemen ts \nor, at a minimum, must be disclosed on bank\u2019s website. If a bank finds it operationally inconvenient \nto make these disclosures along with published financial results / statements, the bank must \nprovide in these financial results / statements, a direct l ink to where the Pillar 3 disclosures can \n                                                            \n103 Please refer to Annex 18 for detailed Pillar  3 disclosure templates.  160 \n be found on the bank\u2019s website. The Pillar 3 disclosures should be made concurrent with \npublication of financial results / statements104. \n14.9.4  However, banks may note that in the case of main features template (as indicated in \nparagraph 14.1 3.7) and provision of the full terms and conditions of capital instruments (as \nindicated in paragraph 14.1 3.8), banks are required to update these disclosures concurrently \nwhenever a new capital instrument is issued and included in capital or whenever there is a \nredemption, conversion / write -down or other material change in the nature of an existing capital \ninstrument.  \n14.10  Regulatory Disclosure Section  \n14.10.1  Banks are required to make disclosures in the format as specified in Annex 18  of this \nMaster Circular. Banks have to maintain a \u2018Regulatory Disclosures Section\u2019 on their websites, \nwhere all the information relating to disclosures will be made available to the market participants. \nThe direct link to this page should be pr ominently provided on the home page of a bank\u2019s website \nand it should be easily accessible. This requirement is essentially to ensure that the relevance / \nbenefit of Pillar 3 disclosures is not diminished by the challenge of finding the disclosure in the \nfirst place.  \n14.10.2 An archive for at least three years of all templates relating to prior reporting periods should \nbe made available by banks on their websites.   \n14.11  Pillar 3 under Basel III Framework105 \n14.11.1  The Pillar 3 disclosure requirements as int roduced under Basel III along with previous \ndisclosure requirements with suitable modifications / enhancements are detailed in the \nsubsequent paragraphs .  \n14.11.2  In order to ensure comparability of the capital adequacy of banks across jurisdictions, it \nis important to disclose details of items of regulatory capital and various regulatory adjustments \nto it. Further, to improve consistency and ease of use of disclosures relating to the composition \nof capital and to mitigate the risk of inconsistent reporting  format undermining the objective of \nenhanced disclosures, banks across Basel member jurisdictions are required to publish their \ncapital positions according to common templates. The disclosure requirements are set out in the \nform of following templates:  \n \n                                                            \n104 It may be noted that Pillar 3 disclosures are required to be made by all banks including those which are not listed \non stock exchanges and / or not required to publish financial results / statement. Therefore, such banks are also  \nrequired to make Pillar 3 disclosures at least on their websites within reasonable period.  \n105Pillar 3 requirements as introduced vide circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/20 12-13 dated May 28, 2013  on \nGuidelines on Composition of Capital Disclosure Requirements. These guidelines became effective from July 1, 2013. \nThe new disclosure requirements are in addition to the Pillar 3 guidance contained in NCAF.  161 \n (i) Disclosure Template  \nA common template which will be used by banks to report the details of their regulatory capital. It \nis designed to meet the Basel III requirement to disclose all regulatory adjustments. The template \nenhances consistency and comparabi lity in the disclosure of the elements of capital between \nbanks and across jurisdictions.  \n(ii) Reconciliation Requirements  \nIn order to meet the reconciliation requirements as envisaged under Basel III, a three -step \napproach has been devised. This step -by-step approach to reconciliation ensures that the Basel \nIII requirement to provide a full reconciliation of all regulatory capital elements back to the \npublished financial statements is met in a consistent manner.   \n(iii) Main Features Template  \nA common tem plate has been designed to capture the main features of all regulatory capital \ninstruments issued by a bank at one place. This disclosure requirement is intended to meet the \nBasel III requirement to provide a description of the main features of capital ins truments.  \n(iv) Other Disclosure Requirements  \nThis disclosure enables banks in meeting the Basel III requirement to provide the full terms and \nconditions of capital instruments on their websites.  \n(v) Pillar 3 disclosure requirements also include certain aspects that are not specifically \nrequired to compute capital requirements under Pillar 1106. It may be noted that beyond disclosure \nrequirements as set forth in these guidelines, banks are responsible for conveying their actual \nrisk profile to market partic ipants. The information banks disclose must be adequate to fulfill this \nobjective. In addition to the specific disclosure requirements as set out in the guidelines, banks \noperating in India should also make additional disclosures in the following areas:  \n(i) Securitisation exposures in the trading book;  \n(ii) Sponsorship of off -balance sheet vehicles;  \n(iii) Valuation with regard to securitisation exposures; and  \n(iv) Pipeline and warehousing risks with regard to securitisation exposures.  \n14.12  Disclosure Template  \n14.12.1 The common template which banks should use is set out in Table DF -11 of Annex 18 , \nalong with explanations.  \n                                                            \n106 Master Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.73/21.06.001/2009 -10 dated Feb 8, 2010 . 162 \n 14.12.2 It may be noted that banks should not add or delete any rows / columns from the common \nreporting template. This is essenti al to ensure that there is no divergence in reporting templates \nacross banks and across jurisdictions which could undermine the objectives of consistency and \ncomparability of a bank\u2019s regulatory capital. The template will retain the same row numbering \nused  in its first column such that market participants can easily map the Indian version of \ntemplates to the common version designed by the Basel Committee.  \n14.12.3 The Basel Committee has suggested that in cases where the national implementation of \nBasel III rules107 applies a more conservative definition of an element (e.g. , components and \ncriteria of regulatory capital, regulatory adjustments etc.), national authorities may choose \nbetween one of two approaches listed below for the purpose of disclosure :  \nAppro ach 1: In the national version of the template, banks are required to maintain the same \ndefinitions108 of all rows. Further, banks will have to report the impact of the more conservative \nnational definition in the rows exclusively designated for national spe cific adjustments.   \nApproach 2: In the national version of the template, banks are required to use the definitions of \nelements as implemented in that jurisdiction109, clearly labelling them as being different from the \nBasel III minimum definition110, and banks  are required to separately disclose the impact of each \nof these different definitions in the notes to the template.  \n14.12.4  The aim of both the approaches is to provide all the information necessary to \nenable market participants to calculate the capital of banks on a common basis. In the Indian \ncontext, Approach 2 appears to be more practical and less burdensome for banks than the \nApproach 1. Under the Approach 2, banks have to furnish data based on the definition of capital \n/ regulatory adjustments as im plemented in India. The difference with the Basel III minimum can \nbe separately disclosed and explained in notes to the templates. This way of disclosure will be \nmore relevant and comprehensible to a larger number of users of disclosures more specifically,  \nthe domestic users. At the same time, information provided in the notes to the templates to \nindicate differences from Basel III minimum will help facilitate cross -jurisdictional comparison of \nbanks\u2019 capital, should users desire. Accordingly, the disclosur e templates have been customised, \nkeeping in view the consistency and comparability of disclosures .  \n \n                                                            \n107 As defined in the DBOD.No.BP.BC.98 /21.06.201/2011 -12 dated May 2, 2012  on Guidelines on Implementation of \nBasel III Capital Regulations in India.  \n108 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems, December 2010 (rev June \n2011).  \n109 As defined in the DBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -12 dated May 2, 2012  on Guidelines on Implementation of \nBasel III Capital Regulations in India.  \n110 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for  more resilient banks and banking systems, December 2010 (rev June \n2011).  163 \n 14.13 Reconciliation Requirements  \n14.13.1 Banks will be required to disclose a full reconciliation of all regulatory capital elements \nback to the balance  sheet in the audited (or unaudited) financial statements. This requirement \naims to address disconnect, if any, present in a bank\u2019s disclosure between the numbers used for \nthe calculation of regulatory capital and the numbers used in the balance sheet.  \n14.13.2 Banks will have to follow a three step approach to show the link between their balance \nsheet and the numbers which are used in the composition of capital disclosure template set out \nin Annex 18  (Table DF -11 whichever applicable). The three steps are e xplained below and also \nillustrated in Table DF -12 of Annex 18 : \nStep 1: banks are required to disclose the reported balance sheet under the regulatory scope of \nconsolidation111 (Table DF -12 of Annex 18 ); \nStep 2: banks will have to expand the lines of the bal ance sheet under regulatory scope of \nconsolidation ( Table DF -12 of Annex 18 ) to display all components which are used in the \ncomposition of capital disclosure template ( Table DF -11 of Annex 18 ); and  \nStep 3: finally, banks will have to map each of the compo nents that are disclosed in Step 2 to the \ncomposition of capital disclosure template set out in Table DF -11 of Annex 18  whichever, \napplicable.   \n14.13.3 Step 1: Disclose the reported balance sheet under the regulatory scope of \nconsolidation  \n(i) The scope o f consolidation for accounting purposes is often different from that applied for the \nregulatory purposes. Usually, there will be difference between the financial statements of a bank \nspecifically, the bank\u2019s balance sheet in published financial statements and the balance sheet \nconsidered for the calculation of regulatory capital. Therefore, the reconciliation process involves \ndisclosing how the balance sheet changes when the regulatory scope of consolidation is applied \nfor the purpose of calculation of regu latory capital on a consolidated basis.  \n(ii) Accordingly, banks are required to disclose the list of the legal entities which have been \nincluded within accounting scope of consolidation but excluded from the regulatory scope of \nconsolidation. This is inten ded to enable market participants and supervisors to investigate the \nrisks posed by unconsolidated entities (e.g. , unconsolidated subsidiaries). Similarly, banks are \nrequired to list the legal entities which have been included in the regulatory consolidati on but not \nin the accounting scope of consolidation. Finally, it is possible that some entities are included in \nboth the regulatory scope of consolidation and accounting scope of consolidation, but the method \n                                                            \n111 Regulatory scope of consolidation is explained in paragraph 3 of this Master Circular.  164 \n of consolidation differs between these two scop es. In such cases, banks are required to list these \nlegal entities and explain the differences in the consolidation methods.   \n(iii) If the scope of regulatory consolidation and accounting consolidation is identical for a \nparticular banking group, it would not be required to undertake Step 1. The banking group would \nstate that there is no difference between the regulatory consolidation and the accounting \nconsolidation and move to Step 2.  \n(iv) In addition to the above requirements, banks must disclose for eac h legal entity, its total \nbalance sheet assets, total balance sheet equity (as stated on the accounting balance sheet of \nthe legal entity), method of consolidation and a description of the principle activities of the entity. \nThese disclosures are required to be made as indicated in the revised templates namely Table \nDF-1: Scope of Application of Annex 18 . \n14.13.4 Step 2: Expand the lines of the regulatory balance sheet to display all of the \ncomponents used in the definition of capital disclosure template ( Table DF -11 of Annex 18 )  \n(i) Many of the elements used in the calculation of regulatory capital may not be readily identified \nfrom the face of the balance sheet. This requires that banks should expand the rows of the \nbalance sheet under regulatory scope of  consolidation such that all the components used in the \ndefinition of capital disclosure template ( Table DF -11 of Annex 18 ) are displayed separately.  \n(ii) For example, paid -up share capital may be reported as one line on the balance sheet. \nHowever, some el ements of this may meet the requirements for inclusion in Common Equity Tier \n1 (CET1) capital and other elements may only meet the requirements for Additional Tier 1 (AT1) \nor Tier 2 (T2) capital, or may not meet the requirements for inclusion in regulatory  capital at all. \nTherefore, if a bank has some amount of paid -up capital which goes into the calculation of CET1 \nand some amount which goes into the calculation of AT1, it should expand the \u2018paid -up share \ncapital\u2019 line of the balance sheet in the following  way: \nPaid-up share capital   Ref  \n      of which amount eligible for CET1   e \n      of which amount eligible for AT1   f \n(iii) In addition, as illustrated above, each element of the expanded balance sheet must be given \na reference number / letter for use  in Step 3.  \n(iv) Another example is regulatory adjustments of the deduction of intangible assets. Firstly , there \ncould be a possibility that the intangible assets may not be readily identifiable in the balance sheet. \nThere is a possibility that the amount on the balance sheet may combine goodwill and other \nintangibles. Secondly , the amount to be deducted is net of any related deferred tax liability. This \ndeferred tax liability is likely to be reported in combination with other deferred tax liabilities which  \nhave no relation to goodwill or intangibles. Therefore, the bank should expand the balance sheet \nin the following way:  165 \n Goodwill and intangible assets   Ref  \n      of which goodwill   a \n      of which other intangibles   b \n \nCurrent and deferred tax liabil ities (DTLs)   Ref  \n      of which DTLs related to goodwill   c \n      of which DTLs related to other intangible assets   d \n \n(v) Banks will need to expand elements of the balance sheet only to the extent required to \nreach the components which are used in t he definition of capital disclosure template. For example, \nif entire paid -up capital of the bank met the requirements to be included in CET1, the bank would \nnot need to expand this line.  \n14.13.5 Step 3: Map each of the components that are disclosed in Ste p 2 to the \ncomposition of capital disclosure templates  \n(i) When reporting the disclosure template (i.e. , Table DF -11 of Annex 18 ), a bank is \nrequired to use the reference numbers / letters from Step 2 to show the source of every input.   \n(ii) For example, if the composition of capital disclosure template includes the line \u2018goodwill \nnet of related deferred tax liability\u2019, then next to this item the bank should put \u2018a - c\u2019. This is required \nto illustrate that how these components of the balance sheet under th e regulatory scope of \nconsolidation have been used to calculate this item in the disclosure template.   \n14.13.6 The three step approach is flexible and offers the following benefits:  \n(i) the level of disclosure is proportionate, varying with the complexity  of the balance \nsheet of the reporting bank (i.e. , banks are not subject to a fixed template. A bank \nmay skip a step if there is no further information added by that step);  \n(ii) supervisors and market participants can trace the origin of the elements of t he \nregulatory capital back to their exact location on the balance sheet under the \nregulatory scope of consolidation; and  \n(iii) the approach is flexible enough to be used under any accounting standards. Banks \nare required to map all the components of the r egulatory capital disclosure templates \nback to the balance sheet under the regulatory scope of consolidation, regardless of \nwhere the accounting standards require the source to be reported on the balance \nsheet.  \n14.13.7 Main Features Template  \n14.13.7.1 Banks are required to complete a \u2018main features template\u2019 to ensure consistency and \ncomparability of disclosures of the main features of capital instruments. Banks are required to \ndisclose a description of the main features of capital instruments issued by t hem. Besides, banks \nwill also be required to make available the full terms and conditions of their capital instruments \n(paragraph 14.1 3.8 below). The requirement of separately disclosing main features of capital 166 \n instruments is intended to provide an overvi ew of the capital structure of a bank. Many times, it \nmay not be possible for the users to extract key features of capital instruments with ease from the \nfull disclosure of terms and conditions of capital instruments made by banks .  \n14.13.7.2 This template  represents the minimum level of summary disclosure which banks are \nrequired to report in respect of each  regulatory capital instrument issued. The main feature \ndisclosure template is set out in Table DF -13 of Annex 18  along with a description of each of t he \nitems to be reported. Some of the key aspects of the \u2018Main Features Template\u2019 are as under :  \n(i) it is designed to be completed by banks from when the Basel III capital regulations \ncome into effect i.e. , as on April 1, 2013. Therefore, it includes discl osure relating to \ninstruments which are subject to the transitional arrangements.  \n(ii) banks are required to report each capital instrument (including common shares) in a \nseparate column of the template, such that the completed template would provide a \n\u2018main features report\u2019 that summarises all of the regulatory capital instruments of the \nbanking group.  \n14.13.7.3 Banks are required to keep the completed main features report up -to-date. Banks \nshould ensure that the report is updated and made publicly avail able, whenever a bank issues or \nrepays a capital instrument and whenever there is redemption, conversion / write -down or other \nmaterial change in the nature of an existing capital instrument.  \n14.13.8 Other Disclosure Requirements  \nIn addition to the discl osure requirements set out in above paragraphs, banks are required to \nmake the following disclosure in respect of the composition of capital:  \n(i) Full Terms and Conditions: banks are required to make available on their websites112 \nthe full terms and conditi ons of all instruments included in regulatory capital. The \nrequirement for banks to make available the full terms and conditions of instruments \non their websites will allow supervisors and market participants to investigate the \nspecific features of individ ual capital instruments.  \n(ii) Banks are required to keep the terms and conditions of all capital instruments up -to-\ndate (Table DF -14 of Annex 18 ). Whenever there is a change in the terms and \nconditions of a capital instrument, banks should update them pro mptly and make \npublicly avai lable such updated disclosure.  \n14.14 Format of  Disclosure Template  \nAll Pillar 3 disclosure templates as set out in these guidelines are furnished in tabular form in \nAnnex 18 . Additional relevant definitions and explanations ar e also provided for the Pillar 3 \ndisclosures.  \n                                                            \n112 Please refer to paragraph 14.10 of this Master Circular.  167 \n Part D: Capital Conservation Buffer Framework113 \n15. Capital Conservation Buffer  \n15.1 Objective  \n15.1.1 The capital conservation buffer (CCB) is designed to ensure that banks build up capital \nbuffers during normal  times (i.e. , outside periods of stress) which can be drawn down as losses \nare incurred during a stressed period. The requirement is based on simple capital conservation \nrules designed to avoid breaches of minimum capital requirements.  \n15.1.2 Outside the p eriod of stress, banks should hold buffers of capital above the regulatory \nminimum. When buffers have been drawn down, one way banks should look to rebuild them is \nthrough reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include reducing divide nd \npayments, share buybacks and staff bonus payments. Banks may also choose to raise new \ncapital from the market as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. However, if a \nbank decides to make payments in excess of the constraints imposed as explained above, the \nbank, with the prior approval of RBI, would have to use the option of raising capital from the market \nequal to the amount above the constraint which it wishes to distribute.  \n15.1.3 In the absence of raising capital from the market, the share of earnings retained by banks \nfor the purpose of rebuilding their capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital \nlevels are to the minimum capital requirement. It will not be appropriate for banks which have \ndepleted their capita l buffers to use future predictions of recovery as justification for maintaining \ngenerous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. It is also not \nacceptable for banks which have depleted their capital buffers to try and use the  distribution of \ncapital as a way to signal their financial strength. Not only is this irresponsible from the perspective \nof an individual bank, putting shareholders\u2019 interests above depositors, it may also encourage \nother banks to follow suit. As a conseq uence, banks in aggregate can end up increasing \ndistributions at the exact point in time when they should be conserving earnings.  \n15.1.4 The capital conservation buffer can be drawn down only when a bank faces a systemic or \nidiosyncratic stress. A bank sho uld not choose in normal times to operate in the buffer range \nsimply to compete with other banks and win market share. This aspect would be specifically \nlooked into by Reserve Bank of India during the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process. If, \nat any t ime, a bank is found to have allowed its capital conservation buffer to fall in normal times, \nparticularly by increasing its risk weighted assets without a commensurate increase in the \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio (although adhering to the restrictions on di stributions), this would be \nviewed seriously. In addition, such a bank will be required to bring the buffer to the desired level \nwithin a time limit prescribed by Reserve Bank of India. The banks which draw down their capital \n                                                            \n113 Annex 4 of Guidelines on Impleme ntation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India issued vide circular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -12 dated May 2, 2012 . 168 \n conservation buffer during a s tressed period should also have a definite plan to replenish the \nbuffer as part of its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process and strive to bring the buffer \nto the desired level within a time limit agreed to with Reserve Bank of India during the Supe rvisory \nReview and Evaluation Process . \n15.1.5 The framework of capital conservation buffer will strengthen the ability of banks to \nwithstand adverse economic environment conditions, will help increase banking sector resilience \nboth going into a downturn, a nd provide the mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early \nstages of economic recovery. Thus, by retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a \ndownturn, banks will be able to help ensure that capital remains available to support the ongoing \nbusiness operations / lending activities during the period of stress. Therefore, this framework is \nexpected to help reduce pro -cyclicality.  \n15.2 The Framework  \n15.2.1 Banks are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, comprised of \nCommon Equ ity Tier 1 capital, above the regulator y minimum capital requirement114 of 9%. \nCapital distribution constraints will be imposed on a bank when capital level falls within this range. \nHowever, they will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall into the \nconservation range as they experience losses. Therefore, the constraints imposed are related to \nthe distributions only and are not related to the operations of banks. The distribution constraints \nimposed on banks when their capital lev els fall into the range increase as the banks\u2019 capital levels \napproach the minimum requirements. The Table 2 2 below shows the minimum capital \nconservation ratios a bank must meet at various levels of the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratios.  \nTable 2 2: Minim um capital conservation standards for individual bank  \nCommon Equity Tier 1  \nRatio after including the  \ncurrent periods retained  \nearnings  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios  \n(expressed as a percentage of earnings)  \n5.5% - 6.125%  100%  \n>6.125% - 6.75%  80%  \n>6.75% - 7.375%  60%  \n>7.375% - 8.0%  40%  \n>8.0%  0% \n \nFor example, a bank with a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio in the range of 6.125% to 6.75% \nis required to conserve 80% of its earnings in the subsequent financial year (i.e. , payout no more \nthan 20% in te rms of dividends, share buybacks and discretionary bonus payments is allowed).  \n                                                            \n114 Common Equity Tier 1 must first be used to m eet the minimum capital requirements (including the 7% Tier 1 and \n9% Total capital requirements, if necessary), before the remainder can contribute to the capital conservation buffer \nrequirement.  169 \n 15.2. 2 The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the minimum Common \nEquity Tier 1 capital requirement of 5.5%, but excludes any additional Common Equity Tier 1 \nneeded to meet the 7% Tier 1 and 9% Total Capital requirements. For example, a bank maintains \nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital of 9% and has no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital. Therefore, the \nbank would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would ha ve a zero conservation buffer \nand therefore, the bank would be subjected to 100% constraint on distributions of capital by way \nof dividends, share -buybacks and discretionary bonuses . \n15.2. 3 The following represents other key aspects of the capital conserva tion buffer \nrequirements:  \n(i) Elements subject to the restriction on distributions : Dividends and share buybacks, \ndiscretionary payments on other Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments to \nstaff would constitute items considered to be d istributions. Payments which do not result in \ndepletion of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, (for example certain scrip dividends115) are not \nconsidered distributions.  \n(ii) Definition of earnings: Earnings are defined as distributable profits before the deductio n \nof elements subject to the restriction on distributions mentioned at (i) above. Earnings are \ncalculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been \npaid. As such, any tax impact of making such distributions are r eversed out. If a bank does not \nhave positive earnings and has a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio less than 8%, it should not make \npositive net distributions.  \n(iii) Solo or consolidated application : Capital conservation buffer is applicable both at the \nsolo leve l (global position) as well as at the consolidated level, i.e. , restrictions would be imposed \non distributions at the level of both the solo bank and the consolidated group. In all cases where \nthe bank is the parent of the group, it would mean that distrib utions by the bank can be made only \nin accordance with the lower  of its Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio at sol o level or consolidated \nlevel116. For example, if a bank\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at solo level is 6.8% and that at \nconsolidated level is 7.4%. It wi ll be subject to a capital conservation requirement of 60% \nconsistent with the Common Equity Tier 1 range of >6.75% - 7.375% as per Table 22 in paragraph \n15.2.1 above. Suppose  a bank\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at solo level is 6.6% and that at \nconsolidat ed level is 6%. It will be subject to a capital conservation requirement of 100% \nconsistent with the Common Equity Tier 1 range of >5.5% - 6.125% as per Table 22 on minimum \ncapital conservation standards for individual bank.  \n                                                            \n115 A scrip dividend is a scrip issue made in lieu of a cash d ividend. The term \u2018scrip dividends\u2019 also includes bonus \nshares.  \n116 If a subsidiary is a bank, it will naturally be subject to the provisions of capita conservation buffer. If it is not a \nbank, even then the parent bank should not allow the subsidiary to dis tribute dividend which are inconsistent with \nthe position of CCB at the consolidated level.  170 \n \nPart E: Leverage Ratio Framewor k117 \n16. Leverage Ratio  \n16.1 Rationale and Objective  \nAn underlying cause of the global financial crisis was the build -up of excessive on - and off -balance \nsheet leverage in the banking system. In many cases, banks built up excessive leverage while \napparently maintaining strong risk -based capital ratios. During the most severe part of the crisis, \nthe banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its leverage in a manner that amplified \ndownward pressure on asset prices. This deleveraging process exacerbated the feedback loop \nbetween losses, falling bank capital and contraction in credit availability. Therefore, under Basel \nIII, a simple, transparent, non -risk based leverage ratio has been introduced. The leverage ratio \nis calibrated to act as a credible suppl ementary measure to the risk based capital requirements \nand is intended to achieve the following objectives:  \n(a) constrain the build -up of leverage in the banking sector to avoid destabilising deleveraging \nprocesses which can damage the broader financial s ystem and the economy; and  \n(b) reinforce the risk -based requirements with a simple, non -risk based \u201cbackstop\u201d measure.  \n16.2 Definition, Minimum Requirement and Scope of Application of the Leverage Ratio  \nDefinition and minimum requirement  \n16.2.1  The Basel I II leverage ratio is defined as the capital measure (the numerator) divided by \nthe exposure measure (the denominator), with this ratio expressed as a percentage . \n \n \n16.2. 2 The minimum Leverage Ratio shall be 4% for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D -\nSIBs) and 3.5% for other banks118. Both the capital measure and the exposure measure along \nwith Leverage Ratio are to be disclosed on a quarter -end basis. However, banks must meet the \nminimum Leverage Ratio requirement at all times.  \n \n \n \n                                                            \n117 Please refer to Annex 5 of Guidelines on Implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India issued vide \ncircular DBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -12 dated May 2, 2012 . \n118 Please refer to circular no. DBR.BP.BC.No.49/21.06.201/2018 -19 dated June  28, 2019  on Basel III Capital \nRegulations - Implementation of Leverage Ratio.  171 \n Scope of consolidation  \n16.2.3 The Basel III leverage ratio framework follows the same scope of regulatory consolidation \nas is used for the risk -based capital framework119. \n16.2.4  Treatment of investments in the capital of banking, financial, insurance and commercial \nentities that  are outside the regulatory scope of consolidation : in cases where a banking, financial, \ninsurance or commercial entity is outside the scope of regulatory consolidation, only the \ninvestment in the capital of such entities (i.e. only the carrying value of t he investment, as opposed \nto the underlying assets and other exposures of the investee) is to be included in the leverage \nratio exposure measure. However, investments in the capital of such entities that are deducted \nfrom Tier 1 capital (i.e. , either deduc tion from Common Equity Tier 1 capital or deduction from \nAdditional Tier 1 capital following corresponding deduction approach) as set out in paragraph 4.4 \n- Regulatory Adjustments / Deductions120 of this Master Circular may be excluded from the \nleverage rati o exposure measure . \n16.3 Capital Measure  \nThe capital measure for the leverage ratio is the Tier 1 capital of the  risk-based capital \nframework121, taking into account various regulatory adjustments / deductions and the transitional \narrangements. In other word s, the capital measure used for the leverage ratio at any particular \npoint in time is the Tier 1 capital measure applying at that time under the risk -based framework.  \n16.4 Exposure Measure  \n16.4.1 General Measurement Principles  \n(i) The exposure measure for the leverage ratio should generally follow the accounting value, \nsubject to the following : \n\uf0b7 on-balance sheet, non -derivative exposures are included in the exposure measure net of \nspecific provisions or accounting valuation adjustments (e.g. accounting credi t valuation \nadjustments, e.g. prudent valuation adjustments for AFS and HFT positions);  \n\uf0b7 netting of loans and deposits is not allowed.  \n(ii) Unless specified differently below, banks must not take account of physical or financial \ncollateral, guarantees or ot her credit risk mitigation techniques to reduce the exposure measure.  \n(iii) A bank\u2019s total exposure measure is the sum of the following exposures:  \n                                                            \n119 Please refer to paragraph 3: Scope of Application of Capital Adequacy Framework. Please also refer to circulars \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.72/21.04.018/2001 -02 dated February 25, 2003  and DBOD.No.FSD.BC.46/24.01.028/2006 -07 dated \nDecember 12, 2006 . \n120 Regulatory adjustments / deductions as indicated in paragraph 4.4.  \n121 Tier 1 capital as defined in paragraph 4: Composition of regulatory capital.  172 \n (a) on-balance sheet exposures;  \n(b) derivative exposures;  \n(c) securities financing transaction (SFT) exposure s; and  \n(d) off- balance sheet (OBS) items.  \nThe specific treatments for these four main exposure types are defined in paragraphs 16.4.2 to \n16.4.5 below.  \n16.4.2  On-balance sheet exposures  \n16.4.2.1 Banks must include all balance sheet assets in their exposure  measure, including on -\nbalance sheet derivatives collateral and collateral for SFTs, with the exception of on -balance \nsheet derivative and SFT assets that are covered in paragraph 16.4.3 and 16.4.4 below122. \n16.4.2.2 However, to ensure consistency, balance s heet assets deducted from Tier 1 capital as \nset out in paragraph 4.4 - Regulatory Adjustments / Deductions may be deducted from the \nexposure measure. Following are the two examples:  \n\u2022 Where a banking, financial or insurance entity is not included in the regu latory scope \nof consolidation (as set out in paragraph 16.2.3), the amount of any investment in the \ncapital of that entity that is totally or partially deducted from CET1 capital or from \nAdditional Tier 1 capital of the bank (in terms of paragraphs 3. 4.2 and 4.4.9.2(C)) may \nalso be deducted from the exposure measure . \n\u2022 For banks using the internal ratings -based (IRB) approach to determining capital \nrequirements for credit risk, paragraph 4.4.4 requires any shortfall in the stock of \neligible provisions relativ e to expected losses to be deducted from CET1 capital. The \nsame amount may be deducted from the exposure measure.  \n16.4.2.3 Liability items must not be deducted from the exposure measure. For example, \ngains/losses on fair valued liabilities or accounting va lue adjustments on derivative liabilities due \nto changes in the bank\u2019s own credit risk as described in paragraph 4.4.6 must not be deducted \nfrom the exposure measure.  \n16.4.3  Derivative exposures  \n16.4.3.1  Treatment of derivatives : Derivatives create two typ es of exposure:  \n(a) an exposure arising from the underlying of the derivative contract; and  \n                                                            \n122 Where a bank according to its operative accounting framework recognises fiduciary assets on the balance sheet, \nthese assets can be excluded from the leverage ratio exposure measure provided that the assets meet the IAS 39 \ncriteria for derecognition and, where applicable, IFRS 10 for deconsolidation. When disclosing the leverage ratio, \nbanks must also disclose the extent of such de -recognised fiduciary items as set out in paragraph 16.7.4.  173 \n (b) a counterparty credit risk (CCR) exposure.  \nThe leverage ratio framework uses the method set out below to capture both of these exposure \ntypes.  \n16.4.3.2 Banks mu st calculate their derivative exposures123, including where a bank sells \nprotection using a credit derivative, as the replacement cost (RC)124 for the current exposure plus \nan add -on for potential future exposure (PFE), as described in paragraph 16.4.3.3 below . If the \nderivative exposure is covered by an eligible bilateral netting contract as specified in the Annex \n20 (part B), an alternative treatment as indicated in paragraph 16.4.3.4  below may be applied125. \nWritten credit derivatives are subject to an additio nal treatment, as set out in paragraphs 16.4.3.11 \nto 16.4.3.14 below.  \n16.4.3.3 For a single derivative contract, not covered by an eligible bilateral netting contract as \nspecified in Annex 20 (part B), the amount to be included in the exposure measure is d etermined \nas follows:  \nexposure measure = replacement cost (RC) + add -on  \nwhere;  \nRC = the replacement cost of the contract (obtained by marking to market),  where the \ncontract has a positive value.  \nadd-on = an amount for PFE over the remaining life of the co ntract calculated by applying \nan add -on factor to the notional principal amount of the derivative. The add -on factors are \ngiven in Table 9 of paragraph 5.15.3.5 and Tables 2 0 & 21 of paragraph 8.6.3.  \n16.4.3.4 Bilateral netting : when an eligible bilateral n etting contract is in place as specified in \nAnnex 20 (part B), the RC for the set of derivative exposures covered by the contract will be the \nsum of net replacement cost and the add -on factors as described in paragraph 16.4.3.3 above  \nwill be A Net as calcul ated below:  \n                                                            \n123 This approach makes reference to the Current Exposure Method (CEM) to calculate CCR exposure amounts \nassociated with derivative exposures. The Basel Committee will consider whether the recently rele ased Standardised \nApproach for measuring exposure at default (EAD) for CCR known as SA -CCR is appropriate in the context of the \nneed to capture both types of exposures created by derivatives as described in paragraph 16.4.3.1. Banks operating \nin India may continue to use CEM until advised otherwise by the Reserve Bank  \n124 If, under the relevant accounting standards, there is no accounting measure of exposure for certain derivative \ninstruments because they are held (completely) off -balance sheet, the bank must  use the sum of positive fair values \nof these derivatives as the replacement cost.  \n125 These netting rules are with the exception of cross -product netting i.e. cross -product netting is not permitted in \ndetermining the leverage ratio exposure measure. However , where a bank has a cross -product netting agreement \nin place that meets the eligibility criteria of Annex 20 (part B) it may choose to perform netting separately in each \nproduct category provided that all other conditions for netting in this product categ ory that are applicable to the \nBasel III leverage ratio are met.  174 \n (a) Credit exposure on bilaterally netted forward transactions will be calculated as the sum of the \nnet mark -to-market replacement cost, if positive, plus an add -on based on the notional underlying \nprincipal. The add -on for netted transactions (ANet) will equal the weighted average of the gross \nadd-on (A Gross) and the gross add -on adjusted by the ratio of net current replacement cost to gross \ncurrent replacement cost (NGR). This is expressed through the following formula:  \n ANet = 0.4 \u00b7 A Gross + 0.6 \u00b7 NGR \u00b7 A Gross \nwhere:  \nNGR = level of net replacement cost  / level of gross replacement cost for transactions \nsubject to legally enforceable netting agreements126 \nAGross = sum of individual add -on amounts (calculated by multiplying the notional principal \namount by the appropriate add -on factors set out in Table 9 of paragraph 5.15.3.5 and \nTables 2 0 & 21 of paragraph 8.6.3) of all transactions subject to legally enforceable netting \nagreements with one counterparty.  \n(b) For the purposes of calculating potent ial future credit exposure to a netting counterparty for \nforward foreign exchange contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional principal \namount is equivalent to cash flows, the notional principal is defined as the net receipts falling due \non each value date in each currency. The reason for this is that offsetting contracts in the same \ncurrency maturing on the same date will have lower potential future exposure as well as lower \ncurrent exposure.  \n16.4.3.5 Treatment of related collateral : collat eral received in connection with derivative \ncontracts has two countervailing effects on leverage:  \n\u2022 it reduces counterparty exposure; but  \n\u2022 it can also increase the economic resources at the disposal of the bank, as the bank \ncan use the collateral to leverage itself.  \n16.4.3.6 Collateral received in connection with derivative contracts does not necessarily reduce \nthe leverage inherent in a bank\u2019s derivatives position, which is generally the case if the settlement \nexposure arising from the underlying derivative c ontract is not reduced. As a general rule, \ncollateral received may not be netted against derivative exposures whether or not netting is \npermitted under the bank\u2019s operative accounting or risk -based framework. Therefore, it is advised \nthat when calculating the exposure amount by applying paragraphs 16.4.3.2 to 16.4.3.4 above, a \nbank must not reduce the exposure amount by any collateral received from the counterparty.  \n                                                            \n126 Banks must calculate NGR on a counterparty by counterparty basis for all transactions that are subject to legally \nenforceable netting agreements.  175 \n 16.4.3.7 Similarly, with regard to collateral provided, banks must gross up their exposure m easure \nby the amount of any derivatives collateral provided where the effect of providing collateral has \nreduced the value of their balance sheet assets under their operative accounting framework . \n16.4.3.8 Treatment of cash variation margin : in the treatme nt of derivative exposures for the \npurpose of the leverage ratio, the cash portion of variation margin exchanged between \ncounterparties may be viewed as a form of pre -settlement payment, if the following conditions are \nmet: \n(i) For trades not cleared throu gh a qualifying central counterparty (QCCP)127, the cash \nreceived by the recipient counterparty is not segregated128. \n(ii) Variation margin is calculated and exchanged on a daily basis based on mark -to-market \nvaluation of derivatives positions129. \n(iii) The cash  variation margin is received in the same currency as the currency of settlement \nof the derivative contract130. \n(iv) Variation margin exchanged is the full amount that would be necessary to fully extinguish \nthe mark -to-market exposure of the derivative subje ct to the threshold and minimum transfer \namounts applicable to the counterparty131. \n(v) Derivatives transactions and variation margins are covered by a single master netting \nagreement (MNA)132,133 between the legal entities that are the counterparties in the der ivatives \ntransaction. The MNA must explicitly stipulate that the counterparties agree to settle net any \npayment obligations covered by such a netting agreement, taking into account any variation \nmargin received or provided if a credit event occurs involvin g either counterparty. The MNA must \n                                                            \n127 A QCCP is as defined in the paragraph 5.1 5.3.3.  \n128 Cash variation margin would satisfy the non -segregation criterion if the recipient counterparty has no restrictions \non the ability to use the cash received (i.e., the cash variation margin received is used as its own cash). Further, this \ncriterion  would be met if the cash received by the recipient counterparty is not required to be segregated by law, \nregulation, or any agreement with the counterparty.  \n129 To meet this criterion, derivative positions must be valued daily and cash variation margin must  be transferred \ndaily to the counterparty or to the counterparty\u2019s account, as appropriate.  \n130 For this paragraph, currency of settlement means any currency of settlement specified in the derivative contract, \ngoverning qualifying master netting agreement (M NA), or the credit support annex (CSA) to the qualifying MNA. The \nBasel Committee will review the issue further for an appropriate treatment in this regard.  \n131 Cash variation margin exchanged on the morning of the subsequent trading day based on the previou s, end -of-\nday market values would meet this criterion, provided that the variation margin exchanged is the full amount that \nwould be necessary to fully extinguish the mark -to-market exposure of the derivative subject to applicable threshold \nand minimum tra nsfer amounts.  \n132 A Master MNA may be deemed to be a single MNA for this purpose.  \n133 To the extent that the criteria in this paragraph include the term \u201cmaster netting agreement\u201d, this term should \nbe read as including any \u201cnetting agreement\u201d that provides le gally enforceable rights of offsets. This is to take \naccount of the fact that no standardisation has currently emerged for netting agreements employed by CCPs  176 \n be legally enforceable and effective134 in all relevant jurisdictions, including in the event of default \nand bankruptcy or insolvency.  \n16.4.3.9 If the conditions in paragraph 16.4.3.8 are met, the cash portion of variation  margin \nreceived may be used to reduce the replacement cost portion of the leverage ratio exposure \nmeasure, and the receivables assets from cash variation margin provided may be deducted from \nthe leverage ratio exposure measure as follows : \n\uf0b7 In the case of c ash variation margin received, the receiving bank may reduce the \nreplacement cost (but not the add -on portion) of the exposure amount of the derivative \nasset by the amount of cash received if the positive mark -to-market value of the derivative \ncontract(s) has not already been reduced by the same amount of cash variation margin \nreceived under the bank\u2019s operative accounting standard.  \n\uf0b7 In the case of cash variation margin provided to a counterparty, the posting bank may \ndeduct the resulting receivable from its  leverage ratio exposure measure, where the cash \nvariation margin has been recognised as an asset under the bank\u2019s operative accounting \nframework.  \nCash variation margin may not be used to reduce the PFE amount  (including the calculation of \nthe net -to-gross  ratio (NGR) as defined in para 16.4.3.4).  \n16.4.3.10 Treatment of clearing services : where a bank acting as clearing member (CM)135 \noffers clearing services to clients, the clearing member\u2019s trade exposures136 to the central \ncounterparty (CCP) that arise when the clearing member is obligated to reimburse the client for \nany losses suffered due to changes in the value of its transactions in the event that the CCP \ndefaults, must be captured by applying the same treatment that applies to any other type of \nderivativ es transactions. However, if the clearing member, based on the contractual \narrangements with the client, is not obligated to reimburse the client for any losses suffered due \nto changes in the value of its transactions in the event that a QCCP defaults, the  clearing member \nneed not recognise the resulting trade exposures to the QCCP in the leverage ratio exposure \nmeasure137. \n                                                            \n134 A master netting agreement (MNA) is deemed to meet this criterion if it satisfies the condition s as specified in \nAnnex 20 (part B).  \n135 A Clearing Member (CM) is as defined in the paragraph 5.15.3.3.  \n136 For the purposes of paragraphs 16.4.3.9 and 16.4.3.10, \u201ctrade exposures\u201d includes initial margin irrespective of \nwhether or not it is posted in a manne r that makes it remote from the insolvency of the CCP.  \n137 An affiliated entity to the bank acting as a clearing member (CM) may be considered a client for the purpose of \nthis paragraph of the Basel III leverage ratio framework if it is outside the relevant scope of regulatory consolidation \nat the level at which the Basel III leverage ratio is applied. In contrast, if an affiliate entity falls within the regulator y \nscope of consolidation, the trade between the affiliate entity and the CM is eliminated in the course of consolidation, \nbut the CM still has a trade exposure to the qualifying central counterparty (QCCP), which will be considered \nproprietary and the exemption in this paragraph no longer applies.  177 \n 16.4.3.11 Where a client enters directly into a derivatives transaction with the CCP and the CM \nguarantees the performance of its clients \u2019 derivative trade exposures to the CCP, the bank acting \nas the clearing member for the client to the CCP must calculate its related leverage ratio exposure \nresulting from the guarantee as a derivative exposure as set out in paragraphs 16.4.3.2 to \n16.4.3.9 , as if it had entered directly into the transaction with the client, including with regard to \nthe receipt or provision of cash variation margin.  \n16.4.3.12 Additional treatment for written credit derivatives : in addition to the CCR exposure \narising from th e fair value of the contracts, written credit derivatives create a notional credit \nexposure arising from the creditworthiness of the reference entity. It is therefore appropriate to \ntreat written credit derivatives consistently with cash instruments (e.g. , loans, bonds) for the \npurposes of the exposure measure.  \n16.4.3.13 In order to capture the credit exposure to the underlying reference entity, in addition to \nthe above CCR treatment for derivatives and related collateral, the effective notional amount138 \nreferenced by a written credit derivative is to be  included in the exposure measure. The effective \nnotional amount of a written credit derivative may be reduced by any negative change in fair value \namount that has been incorporated into the calculation of Tie r 1 capital with respect to the written \ncredit derivative139. The resulting amount may be further reduced by the effective notional amount \nof a purchased credit derivative on the same reference name provided140141: \n\uf0b7 the credit protection purchased is on a referen ce obligation which ranks pari passu with \nor is junior to the underlying reference obligation of the written credit derivative in the case \nof single name credit derivatives142; and  \n                                                            \n138 The effective notional amount is obtained by adjusti ng the notional amount to reflect the true exposure of \ncontracts that are leveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the transaction.  \n139 A negative change in fair value is meant to refer to a negative fair value of a credit derivative that is recog nised \nin Tier 1 capital. This treatment is consistent with the rationale that the effective notional amounts included in the \nexposure measure may be capped at the level of the maximum potential loss, which means the maximum potential \nloss at the reporting date is the notional amount of the credit derivative minus any negative fair value that has \nalready reduced Tier 1 capital. For example, if a written credit derivative had a positive fair value of 20 on one date \nand has a negative fair value of 10 on a sub sequent reporting date, the effective notional amount of the credit \nderivative may be reduced by 10. The effective notional amount cannot be reduced by 30. However, if at the \nsubsequent reporting date the credit derivative has a positive fair value of 5, t he effective notional amount cannot \nbe reduced at all.  \n140 Two reference names are considered identical only if they refer to the same legal entity. For single -name credit \nderivatives, protection purchased that references a subordinated position may offset p rotection sold on a more \nsenior position of the same reference entity as long as a credit event on the senior reference asset would result in a \ncredit event on the subordinated reference asset.  \n141 The effective notional amount of a written credit derivative  may be reduced by any negative change in fair value \nreflected in the bank\u2019s Tier 1 capital provided the effective notional amount of the offsetting purchased credit \nprotection is also reduced by any resulting positive change in fair value reflected in Tie r 1 capital.  \n142 For tranched products if applicable, the purchased protection must be on a reference obligation with the same \nlevel of seniority.  178 \n \uf0b7 the remaining maturity of the credit protection purchased is equal to or grea ter than the \nremaining maturity of the written credit derivative.  \n16.4.3.14 Since written credit derivatives are included in the exposure measure at their effective \nnotional amounts, and are also subject to add -on amounts for PFE, the exposure measure for \nwritten credit derivatives may be overstated. Banks may therefore choose to deduct the individual \nPFE add -on amount relating to a written credit derivative (which is not offset according to \nparagraph 16.4.3.13 and whose effective notional amount is include d in the exposure measure) \nfrom their gross add -on in paragraphs 16.4.3.2 to 16.4.3.4143. \n16.4.4 Securities financing transaction exposures  \n16.4.4.1 SFTs144  are included in the exposure measure according to the treatment described in \nthe following paragraphs.  The treatment recognises that secured lending and borrowing in the \nform of SFTs is an important source of leverage and ensures consistent international \nimplementation by providing a common measure for dealing with the main differences in the \noperative acc ounting frameworks.  \n16.4.4.2 General treatment (bank acting as principal) : the sum of the amounts in sub -\nparagraphs (A) and (B) below are to be included in the leverage ratio exposure measure:  \n(A) Gross SFT assets145 recognised for accounting purposes (i.e. , with no recogn ition of \naccounting netting)146, adjusted as follows:  \n(i) excluding from the exposure measure the value of any securities received under an \nSFT, where the bank has recognised the securities as a n asset on its balance sheet147; \nand \n                                                            \n143 In these cases, where effective bilateral netting contracts are in place, and when calculating A Net = 0.4\u00b7A Gross+ \n0.6\u00b7NGR\u00b7A Gross as per paragraphs 16.4.3.2 to 16.4.3.4, A Gross may be reduced by the individual add -on amounts (i.e., \nnotionals multiplied by the appropriate add -on factors) which relate to written credit derivatives whose notional \namounts are included  in the leverage ratio exposure measure. However, no adjustments must be made to NGR. \nWhere effective bilateral netting contracts are not in place, the PFE add -on may be set to zero in order to avoid the \ndouble -counting described in this paragraph.  \n144 SFTs are transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and \nborrowing, and margin lending transactions, where the value of the transactions depends on market valuations and \nthe transactions are often subject to margi n agreements.  \n145 For SFT assets subject to novation and cleared through QCCPs, \u201cgross SFT assets recognised for accounting \npurposes\u201d are replaced by the final contractual exposure, given that pre -existing contracts have been replaced by \nnew legal obligation s through the novation process.  \n146 Gross SFT assets recognised for accounting purposes must not recognise any accounting netting of cash payables \nagainst cash receivables (e.g., as currently permitted under the IFRS and US GAAP accounting frameworks). This \nregulatory treatment has the benefit of avoiding inconsistencies from netting which may arise across different \naccounting regimes.  \n147 This may apply, for example, under US GAAP where securities received under an SFT may be recognised as assets \nif the recipi ent has the right to rehypothecate but has not done so.  179 \n (ii) cash paya bles and cash receivables in SFTs with the same counterparty may be \nmeasured net if all the following criteria are met:  \n(a) Transactions have the same explicit final settlement date;  \n(b) The right to set off the amount owed to the counterparty with the amo unt owed by \nthe counterparty is legally enforceable both currently in the normal course of business \nand in the event of: (i) default; (ii) insolvency; and (iii) bankruptcy; and  \n(c) The counterparties intend to settle net, settle simultaneously, or the tran sactions \nare subject to a settlement mechanism that results in the functional equivalent of net \nsettlement, that is, the cash flows of the transactions are equivalent, in effect, to a single \nnet amount on the settlement date. To achieve such equivalence, b oth transactions are \nsettled through the same settlement system and the settlement arrangements are \nsupported by cash and/or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that settlement of \nboth transactions will occur by the end of the business day and th e linkages to collateral \nflows do not  result in the unwinding of net cash settlement148,149. \n(B) A measure of CCR calculated as the current exposure without an add -on for PFE, \ncalculated as follows:  \n(i) Where a qualifying MNA150 is in place, the current exposure  (E*) is the greater of zero \nand the total fair value of securities and cash lent to a counterparty for all transactions \nincluded in the qualifying MNA (\u2211Ei), less the total fair value of cash and securities \nreceived from the counterparty for those transac tions (\u2211Ci). This is illustrated in the \nfollowing formula:  \nE* = max {0, [\u2211E i \u2013 \u2211C i]} \n                                                            \n148 This latter condition ensures that any issues arising from the securities leg of the SFTs do not interfere with the \ncompletion of the net settlement of the cash receivables and payables.  \n149 To achiev e functional equivalence, all transactions must be settled through the same settlement mechanism. The \nfailure of any single securities transaction in the settlement mechanism should delay settlement of only the matching \ncash leg or create an obligation to the settlement mechanism, supported by an associated credit facility. Further, if \nthere is a failure of the securities leg of a transaction in such a mechanism at the end of the window for settlement \nin the settlement mechanism, then this transaction and i ts matching cash leg must be split out from the netting set \nand treated gross for the purposes of the Basel III leverage ratio exposure measure. Specifically, the criteria in this \nparagraph are not intended to preclude a Delivery -versus -Payment (DVP) settl ement mechanism or other type of \nsettlement mechanism, provided that the settlement mechanism meets the functional requirements set out in this \nparagraph. For example, a settlement mechanism may meet these functional requirements if any failed transaction \n(that is, the securities that failed to transfer and the related cash receivable or payable) can be re -entered in the \nsettlement mechanism until they are settled.  \n150 A \u201cqualifying\u201d MNA is one that meets the requirements under Annex 20 - Part A.  180 \n (ii) Where no qualifying MNA is in place, the current exposure for transactions with a \ncounterparty must be calculated on a transaction by transaction basis: that is, each  \ntransaction is treated as its own netting set, as shown in the following formula:  \nEi* = max {0, [E i \u2013 Ci]} \n16.4.4.3 Sale accounting transactions : leverage may remain with the lender of the security in \nan SFT whether or not sale accounting is achieved unde r the operative accounting framework. \nAs such, where sale accounting is achieved for an SFT under the bank\u2019s operative accounting \nframework, the bank must reverse all sales -related accounting entries, and then calculate its \nexposure as if the SFT had been treated as a financing transaction under the operative accounting \nframework (i.e. , the bank must include the sum of amounts in sub -paragraphs (A) and (B) of \nparagraph 16.4.4.2 for such an SFT) for the purposes of determining its exposure measure.  \n16.4.4.4  Bank acting as agent : a bank acting as agent in an SFT generally provides an indemnity \nor guarantee to only one of the two parties involved, and only for the difference between the value \nof the security or cash its customer has lent and the value of collat eral the borrower has provided. \nIn this situation, the bank is exposed to the counterparty of its customer for the difference in values \nrather than to the full exposure to the underlying security or cash of the transaction (as is the case \nwhere the bank is  one of the principals in the transaction). Where the bank does not own/control \nthe underlying cash or security resource, that resource cannot be leveraged by the bank.  \n16.4.4.5 Where a bank acting as agent in an SFT provides an indemnity or guarantee to a  \ncustomer or counterparty for any difference between the value of the security or cash the \ncustomer has lent and the value of collateral the borrower has provided, t hen the bank will be \nrequired to  calculate its exposure measure by applying only subparagra ph (B) of paragraph \n16.4.4.2151. \n16.4.4.6 A bank acting as agent in an SFT and providing an indemnity or guarantee to a customer \nor counterparty will be considered eligible for the exceptional treatment set out in paragraph \n16.4.4.5 only if the bank\u2019s exposu re to the transaction is limited to the guaranteed difference \nbetween the value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the value of the collateral the \nborrower has provided. In situations where the bank is further economically exposed (i.e. , beyond \nthe guarantee for the difference) to the underlying security or cash in the transaction152, a further \nexposure equal to the full amount of the security or cash must be included in the exposure \nmeasure.  \n                                                            \n151 Where, in addition to the conditions in paragraphs 16.4.4.4 to 16.4.4.6, a bank acting as an agent in an SFT does \nnot provide an indemnity or guarantee to any of the involved parties, the bank is not exposed to the SFT and \ntherefore need not recognise those SFTs in its exposure measure.  \n152 For example, due to the bank managing collateral received in the bank\u2019s name or on its own account rather than \non the customer\u2019s or borrower\u2019s account (e.g., by on -lending or managing unsegregated collateral, cash or \nsecurities).  181 \n 16.4.4.7 An illustrative example of exposure measure  for SFT transactions are furnished in Annex \n14. \n16.4.5 Off -balance sheet items  \n16.4.5.1 This paragraph explains the treatment of off -balance sheet (OBS) items into the leverage \nratio exposure measure. OBS items include commitments (including liquidity fac ilities), whether \nor not unconditionally cancellable, direct credit substitutes, acceptances, standby letters of credit, \ntrade letters of credit, etc.  \n16.4.5.2 In the risk -based capital framework, OBS items are converted under the standardised \napproach int o credit exposure equivalents through the use of credit conversion factors (CCFs)153. \nFor the purpose of determining the exposure amount of OBS items for the leverage ratio, the \nCCFs set out in the following paragraphs must be applied to the notional amount154. \n(i) Commitments other than securitisation liquidity facilities with an original maturity up to one \nyear and commitments with an origi nal maturity over one year shall receive a CCF of 20% and \n50%, respectively. However, any commitments that are unconditio nally cancellable at any time \nby the bank without prior notice, or that effectively provide for automatic cancellation due to \ndeterioration in a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness, will receive a 10% CCF.  \n(ii) Direct credit substitutes, e.g. , general guarantees o f indebtedness (including standby \nletters of credit serving as financial guarantees for loans and securities) and acceptances \n(including endorsements with the character of acceptances) will receive a CCF of 100%.  \n(iii) Forward asset purchases, forward forw ard deposits and partly paid shares and securities, \nwhich represent commitments with certain drawdown, will receive a CCF of 100%.  \n(iv) Certain transaction -related contingent items (e.g. , performance bonds, bid bonds, \nwarranties and standby letters of cred it related to particular transactions) will receive a CCF of \n50%.  \n(v) Note issuance facilities (NIFs) and revolving underwriting facilities (RUFs) will receive a \nCCF of 50%.  \n(vi) For short -term self -liquidating trade letters of credit arising from the move ment of goods \n(e.g. documentary credits collateralised by the underlying shipment), a 20% CCF will be applied \nto both issuing and confirming banks.  \n                                                            \n153 Please refer to paragraph 5.15.1.  \n154 These correspond to the CCFs of the standardised approach for credit risk under paragraph 5.15.2 (including Table \n8), subject to a floor of 10%. The floor of 10% will affect commitments that are unconditionally cancellab le at any \ntime by the bank without prior notice, or that effectively provide for automatic cancellation due to deterioration in \na borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. These may receive a 0% CCF under the risk -based capital framework. For any OBS \nitem not specifica lly mentioned under paragraph 16.4.5.2, the applicable CCF for that item will be as indicated in the \nparagraph 5.15.2 above.  182 \n (vii) Where there is an undertaking to provide a commitment on an OBS item, banks sh ould \napply the lower of the two applicable CCFs.  \n(viii) All off -balance sheet securitisation exposures will receive a CCF of 100% conversion \nfactor.  \n16.5 Disclosure and Reporting  requirements  \n16.5.1 Banks are required to publicly disclose their Basel III leverage ratio on a cons olidated \nbasis.  \n16.5.2 To enable market participants to reconcile leverage ratio disclosures with banks\u2019 published \nfinancial statements from period to period, and to compare the capital adequacy of banks, it is \nimportant that banks adopt a consistent and c ommon disclosure of the main components of the \nleverage ratio, while also reconciling these disclosures with their published financial statements.  \n16.5.3 To facilitate consistency and ease of use of disclosures relating to the composition of the \nleverage r atio, and to mitigate the risk of inconsistent formats undermining the objective of \nenhanced disclosure, banks shall  publish their leverage ratio according to a common set of \ntemplates.  \n16.5.4 The public disclosure requirements include:  \n\uf0b7 a summary compariso n table  that provides a comparison of banks\u2019 total accounting \nassets amounts and leverage ratio exposures;  \n\uf0b7 a common disclosure template  that provides a breakdown of the  \n\uf0b7 main leverage ratio regulatory elements;  \n\uf0b7 a reconciliation requirement  that details the source(s) of material differences between \nbanks\u2019 total balance sheet assets in their financial statements and on -balance sheet \nexposures in the common disclosure template; and  \n\uf0b7 other disclosures  as set out below.  \n16.5.5  Banks should also report their levera ge ratio to the RBI (Department of Banking \nSupervision) along with detailed calculations of capital and exposure measures on a quarterly \nbasis . \n16.5.6 Implementation date, frequency and location of disclosure  \n16.5.6.1 Banks operating in India are required to make disclosure of the leverage ratio and its \ncomponents from the date of publication of their first set of financial statements / results on or \nafter April 1, 2015. Accordingly, the first such disclosure was to be made for the quarter ending \nJune 30, 2 015. \n16.5.6.2 With the exception of the mandatory quarterly frequency requirement in paragraph \n16.5.6.3 below, detailed disclosures required according to paragraphs 16. 6 must be made by 183 \n banks, irrespective of whether financial statements are audited, at le ast on a half yearly basis (i.e. \nas on September 30 and March 31 of a financial year), along with other Pillar 3 disclosures as \nrequired in terms of paragraph 14.9.  \n16.5.6.3 As the leverage ratio is an important supplementary measure to the risk -based capi tal \nrequirements, the same Pillar 3 disclosure requirement also applies to the leverage ratio. \nTherefore, banks, at a minimum, must disclose the following three items on a quarterly basis, \nirrespective of whether financial statements are audited:  \n(i) Tier 1 capital (as per paragraph 16.3);  \n(ii) Exposure measure (as per paragraph 16.4); and  \n(iii) Leverage ratio (as per paragraph 16.2).  \nAt a minimum, these disclosures should be made on a quarter -end basis (i.e. , as on June 30, \nSeptember 30, December 31 and Ma rch 31 of a financial year), along with the figures of the prior \nthree quarter -ends.  \n16.5.6.4 The location of leverage ratio disclosures should be as stipulated for Pillar 3 disclosures \nin terms of paragraphs 14.9.3 and 14.10. However, specific to leverage  ratio disclosures, banks \nhave to make available on their websites, an ongoing archive of all reconciliation templates, \ndisclosure templates and explanatory tables relating to prior reporting periods, instead of an \narchive for at least three years as requi red in case of Pillar 3 disclosures.  \n16.6 Disclosure templates  \n16.6.1 The summary comparison table (Table: DF -17), common disclosure template (Table: DF -\n18) and explanatory table, qualitative reconciliation and other  requirements are set out in the \nAnnex 1 8: Pillar 3 disclosure requirements. Together, these ensure transparency between the \nvalues used for the calculation of the Basel III leverage ratio and the values used in banks\u2019 \npublished financial statements.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 184 \n Part F: Countercyclical Capital Buffe r Framework  \n17. Countercyclical Capital Buffer  \n17.1 Objective  \nThe aim of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCCB) regime is twofold. Firstly, it requires banks \nto build up a buffer of capital in good times which may be used to maintain flow of credit to t he \nreal sector in difficult times. Secondly, it achieves the broader macro -prudential goal of restricting \nthe banking sector from indiscriminate lending in the periods of excess credit growth that have \noften been associated with the building up of system -wide risk . \n17.2 The Framework  \n17.2.1  The CCCB may be maintained in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital only, \nand the amount of the CCCB may vary from 0 to 2.5% of total risk weighted assets (RWA) of the \nbanks. If, as per the Reserve Bank of Ind ia directives, banks are required to hold CCCB at a given \npoint in time, the same may be disclosed at table DF -11 of Annex 18  as indicated in Basel III \nMaster Circular . \n17.2.2  The CCCB decision would normally be pre -announced with a lead time of 4 quarters . \nHowever, depending on the CCCB indicators, the banks may be advised to build up requisite \nbuffer in a shorter span of time.  \n17.2.3  The credit -to-GDP gap155 shall be the main indicator in the CCCB framework in India. \nHowever, it shall not be the only refere nce point and shall be used in conjunction with GNPA \ngrowth. The Reserve Bank of India shall also look at other supplementary indicators for CCCB \ndecision such as incremental C -D ratio for a moving period of three years (along with its \ncorrelation with cre dit-to-GDP gap and GNPA growth), Industry Outlook (IO) assessment index \n(along with its correlation with GNPA growth) and interest coverage ratio (along with its correlation \nwith credit -to-GDP gap). While taking the final decision on CCCB, the Reserve Bank  of India may \nuse its discretion to use all or some of the indicators along with the credit -to-GDP gap.  \n17.2.4 The CCCB framework shall have two thresholds, viz., lower threshold and upper threshold, \nwith respect to credit -to-GDP gap.  \na. The lower threshol d (L) of the credit -to-GDP gap where the CCCB is activated shall be set \nat 3 percentage points, provided its relationship with GNPA remains significant. The buffer \nactivation decision will also depend upon other supplementary indicators as detailed in \nparagraph 4.  \nb. The upper threshold (H) where the CCCB reaches its maximum shall be kept at 15 \npercentage points of the credit -to-GDP gap. Once the upper threshold of the credit -to-\n                                                            \n155 Credit -to-GDP gap is the difference between credit -to-GDP ratio and the long term trend value of credit -to-GDP \nratio at any point  in time.  185 \n GDP gap is reached, the CCCB shall remain at its maximum value of 2.5 per cent of RWA, \ntill the time a withdrawal is signalled by the Reserve Bank of India.  \nc. In between 3 and 15 percentage points of credit -to-GDP gap, the CCCB shall increase \ngradually from 0 to 2.5 per cent of the RWA of the bank but the rate of increase would be \ndifferent based on the level/position156 of credit -to-GDP gap between 3 and 15 percentage \npoints. If the credit -to-GDP gap is below 3 percentage points then there will not be any \nCCCB requirement.  \n17.2.5  The same set of indicators that are used for activating  CCCB (as mentioned in paragraph \n4) may be used to arrive at the decision for the release phase of the CCCB. However, discretion \nshall be with the Reserve Bank of India for operating the release phase of CCCB. Further, the \nentire CCCB accumulated may be re leased at a single point in time but the use of the same by \nbanks will not be unfettered and will need to be decided only after discussion with the Reserve \nBank of India.  \n17.2.6  For all banks operating in India, CCCB shall be maintained on a solo basis as well as on \nconsolidated basis.  \n17.2.7 All banks operating in India (both foreign and dome stic banks) should  maintain capital for \nIndian operations under CCCB framework based on their exposures in India.  \n17.2.8 Banks incorporated in India having internation al presence shall maintain adequate capital \nunder CCCB as prescribed by the host supervisors in respective jurisdictions. The banks, based \non the geographic location of their private sector credit exposures (including non -bank financial \nsector exposures), shall calculate their bank specific CCCB requirement as a weighted157 average \nof the requirements that are being applied in respective jurisdictions. The Reserve Bank of India \nmay also ask Indian banks to keep excess capital under CCCB framework for exposure s in any \nof the host countries they are operating if it feels the CCCB requirement in host country is not \nadequate.  \n17.2.9  Banks will be subject to restrictions on discretionary distributions (may include dividend \npayments, share buybacks and staff bonus p ayments) if they do not meet the requirement on \ncountercyclical capital buffer which is an extension of the requirement for capital conservation \nbuffer (CCB). Assuming a concurrent requirement of CCB of 2.5% and CCCB of 2.5% of total \n                                                            \n156 The CCCB requirement shall increase linearly from 0 to 20 basis points when credit -to-GDP gap moves from 3 to \n7 percentage points. Similarly, for above 7 and up to 11 percentage points range of credit -to-GDP gap, CCCB \nrequirement shall increase  linearly from above 20 to 90 basis points. Finally, for above 11 and up to 15 percentage \npoints range of credit -to-GDP gap, the CCCB requirement shall increase linearly from above 90 to 250 basis points. \nHowever, if the credit -to-GDP gap exceeds 15 percen tage points, the buffer shall remain at 2.5 per cent of the RWA.  \n157 Weight = (bank\u2019s total credit risk charge that relates to private sector credit exposures in that jurisdiction/ bank\u2019s \ntotal credit risk charge that relates to private sector credit exposur es across all jurisdictions), where credit includes \nall private sector credit exposures that attract a credit risk capital charge, or the risk weighted equivalent trading \nbook capital charges for specific risk, IRC and securitisation.  186 \n RWAs, the required con servation ratio (restriction on discretionary distribution) of a bank, at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital held is illustrated in Table -23. \nTable 2 3: Individual bank minimum capital conservation ratios, assuming a  \nrequirement of 2.5% each of capital conserv ation buffer and CCCB  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio bands  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios \n(expressed as % of earnings)  \n>5.5% -6.75%  100%  \n>6.75% -8.0%  80% \n>8.0% -9.25%  60% \n>9.25% -10.50%  40% \n>10.50%  0% \n \nThe CET 1 ratio bands are structured in increments of 25% of the required CCB and CCCB \nprescribed by the Reserve Bank of India at that point in time158. A separate illustrative table is \ngiven below with an assumption of CCCB requirement at 1%.  \nTable 2 4: Individual bank minimum capital conservation standards,  when a bank is \nsubject to a 2.5% CCB and 1% CCCB   \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio bands  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios \n(expressed as % of earnings)  \n> 5.5% - 6.375%*  100%  \n> 6.375% - 7.25%  80%  \n> 7.25% - 8.125%  60%  \n> 8.125% - 9.00%  40%  \n> 9.00%  0% \n*(6.3 75=5.50+0.625+0.250)  \nAs the total requirement of CCB and CCCB is 2.5% and 1% respectively, at each band, 0.625% \nand 0.250% of RWA are being added for CCB and CCCB respectively.  \n17.2.10 Banks must ensure that their CCCB requirements are calculated and publi cly disclosed \nwith at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements as applicable in various \njurisdictions. The buffer should be based on the latest relevant jurisdictional CCCB requirements \nthat are applicable on the date that they calcul ate their minimum capital requirement. In addition, \n                                                            \n158 First CET 1 ratio b and = Minimum CET 1 ratio + 25% of CCB + 25% of applicable CCCB. For subsequent bands, \nstarting point will be the upper limit of previous band. However, it may be mentioned that CET 1 ratio band may \nchange depending on various capital/buffer requirements ( e.g., D -SIB buffer) as prescribed by the Reserve Bank of \nIndia from time to time. Accordingly, lower and upper values of the bands as given in Table -23 will undergo changes.  187 \n when disclosing their buffer requirement, banks must also disclose the geographic breakdown of \ntheir private sector credit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer requirement . \n17.3 The CCCB decisi ons may form a part of the first bi -monthly monetary policy statement of the \nReserve Bank of India for the year. However, more frequent communications in this regard may \nbe made by the Reserve Bank of India, if warranted by changes in economic conditions . \n17.4 The indicators and thresholds for CCCB decisions mentioned above shall be subject to \ncontinuous review and empirical testing for their usefulness and other indicators may also be used \nby the Reserve Bank of India to support CCCB decisions . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 188 \n Annex 1  \n(cf. para 4.2.3.1 ) \n \nCriteria for Classification as Common Shares (Paid -up Equity Capital) for Regulatory \nPurposes \u2013 Indian Banks  \n1. All common shares should ideally be the voting shares. However, in rare cases, where \nbanks need t o issue non -voting common shares as part of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, they \nmust be identical to voting common shares of the issuing bank in all respects except the absence \nof voting rights. Limit on voting rights will be applicable based on the provisi ons of respective \nstatutes governing individual banks {i.e. , Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of \nUndertakings) Act, 1970 / 1980 in case of nationalized banks; SBI Act, 1955 in case of State Bank \nof India; State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) A ct, 1959 in case of associate banks of State \nBank of India; Banking Regulation Act, 1949 in case of Private Sector Banks, etc.}  \n2. Represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the bank.  \n3. Entitled to a claim on the residual assets which is pro portional to its share of paid up \ncapital, after all senior claims have been repaid in liquidation (i.e. has an unlimited and variable \nclaim, not a fixed or capped claim).  \n4. Principal is perpetual and never repaid outside of liquidation (except discretion ary \nrepurchases / buy backs or other means of effectively reducing capital in a discretionary manner \nthat is allowable under relevant law as well as guidelines, if any, issued by RBI in the matter).  \n5. The bank does nothing to create an expectation at issu ance that the instrument will be \nbought back, redeemed or cancelled nor do the statutory or contractual terms provide any feature \nwhich might give rise to such an expectation.  \n6. Distributions are paid out of distributable items. The level of distributions  is not in any way \ntied or linked to the amount paid up at issuance and is not subject to a contractual cap (except to \nthe extent that a bank is unable to pay distributions that exceed the level of distributable items). \nAs regards \u2018distributable items\u2019, it  is clarified that the dividend on common shares will be paid out \nof current year\u2019s profit only.  \n7. There are no circumstances under which the distributions are obligatory. Non -payment is \ntherefore not an event of default.  \n8. Distributions are paid only af ter all legal and contractual obligations have been met and \npayments on more senior capital instruments have been made. This means that there are no \npreferential distributions, including in respect of other elements classified as the highest quality \nissued  capital.  189 \n 9. It is the paid -up capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any losses \nas they occur159. Within the highest quality capital, each instrument absorbs losses on a going \nconcern basis proportionately and pari passu  with all  the others.  \n10. The paid up amount is classified as equity capital (i.e. not recognised as a liability) for \ndetermining balance sheet insolvency.  \n11. The paid up amount is classified as equity under the relevant accounting standards.  \n12. It is directly is sued and paid up and the bank cannot directly or indirectly have funded the \npurchase of the instrument160. Banks should also not extend loans against their own shares.  \n13. The paid up amount is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer or rela ted \nentity161 nor subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority \nof the claim.  \n14. Paid up capital is only issued with the approval of the owners of the issuing bank, either \ngiven directly by the owners or, if permitted by applicable law, given by the Board of Directors or \nby other persons duly authorised by the owners.  \n15. Paid up capital is clearly and separately disclosed in the bank\u2019s balance sheet.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n159 In cases where capital instruments have a permanent write -down feature, this cri terion is still deemed to be met \nby common shares.  \n160 Banks should not grant advances against its own shares as this would be construed as indirect funding of its own \ncapital.  \n161 A related entity can include a parent company, a sister company, a subsidiary o r any other affiliate. A holding \ncompany is a related entity irrespective of whether it forms part of the consolidated banking group.  190 \n Annex 2  \n(cf. para 4.2.3.2 ) \nCriteria for Classification  as Common Equity for Regulatory Purposes \u2013 Foreign Banks  \n1. Represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the Indian operations of the bank.  \n2. Entitled to a claim on the residual assets which is proportional to its share of paid up \ncapital, af ter all senior claims have been repaid in liquidation (i.e. has an unlimited and variable \nclaim, not a fixed or capped claim).  \n3. Principal is perpetual and never repaid outside of liquidation (except with the approval of \nRBI).  \n4. Distributions to the Head  Office of the bank are paid out of distributable items. The level \nof distributions is not in any way tied or linked to the amount paid up at issuance and is not subject \nto a contractual cap (except to the extent that a bank is unable to pay distributions that exceed \nthe level of distributable items). As regards \u2018distributable items\u2019, it is clarified that: the dividend on \ncommon shares/ equity will be paid out of current year\u2019s profit only.  \n5. Distributions to the Head Office of the bank are paid only after  all legal and contractual \nobligations have been met and payments on more senior capital instruments have been made. \nThis means that there are no preferential distributions, including in respect of other elements \nclassified as the highest quality issued ca pital.  \n6. This capital takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any losses as they \noccur162. \n7. It is clearly and separately disclosed in the bank\u2019s balance sheet.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n162 In cases where capital instruments have a permanent write -down feature, this criterion is still deemed to be met \nby comm on shares  191 \n Annex 3  \n(cf. para 4.2.4.1 ) \nCriteria for Inclusion of Perpetual Non -cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) in \nAdditional Tier 1 Capital  \nThe PNCPS will be issued by Indian banks, subject to extant legal provisions, only in Indian \nrupees and sh ould meet the following terms and conditions to qualify for inclusion in Additional \nTier 1 Capital for capital adequacy purposes:  \n1. Terms of Issue of Instruments  \n1.1 Paid up Status  \nThe instruments should be issued by the bank (i.e. , not by any \u2018SPV\u2019 etc. set up by the bank for \nthis purpose) and fully paid up.  \n1.2 Amount  \nThe amount of PNCPS  to be raised may be decided by the Board of Directors of banks.  \n1.3 Limits  \nWhile complying with minimum Tier 1 of 7% of risk weighted assets, a bank cannot admit, \nPerpetual Non -Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) together with Perpetual Debt \nInstruments (PDI) in Additional Tier 1 Capital, more than 1.5% of risk weighted assets. However, \nonce this minimum total Tier 1 capital has been complied with, any additional PNCPS and PDI \nissued by the bank can be included in Total Tier 1 capital reported. Excess PNC PS and PDI can \nbe reckoned to comply with Tier 2 capital if the latter is less than 2% of RWAs i.e. , while complying \nwith minimum Total Capital of 9% of risk weighted assets.  \n1.4 Maturity Period  \nThe PNCPS shall be perpetual i.e. , there is no maturity date and there are no step -ups or other \nincentives to redeem.  \n1.5 Rate of Dividend  \nThe rate of dividend payable to the investors may be either a fixed rate or a floating rate \nreferenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate.  \n1.6 Optionality  \nPNCPS  shall not be issued with a 'put option'. However, banks may issue the instruments with a \ncall option at a particular date subject to following conditions:  \n(a) The call option on the instrument is permissible after the instrument has run for at least \nfive years;  192 \n (b) To exercise a call option a bank shall receive prior approval of RBI  (Depart ment of \nRegulation);  \n(c) A bank must  not do anything which creates an expectation th at the call will be exercised163. \nFor example, to preclude such expectation of the ins trument being called, the dividend / \ncoupon reset date need not be co -terminus with the call date. Banks may, at their \ndiscretion, consider having an appropriate gap between dividend / coupon reset date and \ncall date; and  \n(d) Banks must  not exercise a call  unless:  \n(i) They replace the called instrument with capital of the same or better quality and \nthe replacement of this capital is done at conditions which are sustainable for th e income \ncapacity of the bank164; or \n(ii) The bank demonstrates that its capital position is well above the minimum capital \nrequirements after the call option is exercised165. \nThe use of tax event and regulatory event calls may be permitted. However, exercise of the calls \non account of these events is subject to the requirements set out in points  (b) to (d) of criterion \n1.6. RBI will permit the bank to exercise the call only if the RBI is convinced that the bank was not \nin a position to anticipate these events at the time of issuance of PNCPS.  \nTo illustrate, if there is a change in tax tr eatment which makes the capital instrument with tax \ndeductible coupons into an instrument with non -tax deductible coupons, then the bank would have \nthe option (not obligation) to repurchase the instrument. In such a situation, a bank may be \nallowed to repl ace the capital instrument with another capital instrument that perhaps does have \ntax deductible coupons. Similarly, if there is a downgrade of the instrument in regulatory \nclassification (e.g. , if it is decided by the RBI to exclude an instrument from reg ulatory capital) the \nbank has the option to call the instrument and replace it with an instrument with a better regulatory \nclassification, or a lower coupon with the same regulatory classification with prior approval of RBI. \nHowever, banks may not create a n expectation / signal an early redemption / maturity of the \nregulatory capital instrument.  \n1.7 Repurchase / Buy -back / Redemption  \n(i) Principal of the instruments may be repaid (e.g. , through repurchase or redemption) only \nwith prior approval of RBI and b anks should not assume or create market expectations that \n                                                            \n163 If a bank were to call a capital instrument and replace it with an instrument that is more costly (e.g. has a higher \ncredit spread) this might create an expectation that the bank will exercise calls on its other capital instruments. \nTherefore, bank may not be permitted to call an instrument if the bank intends to replace it with an instrument \nissued at a higher credit spread. This is applicable in cases of all Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments.  \n164 Replacement issues can be concurrent with but not after the instrument is called.  \n165 Here, minimum refers to Common Equity Tier 1 of 8% of RWAs (including capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of \nRWAs) and Total Capital of 11.5% of RWAs including any additional capital requirement identified under Pi llar 2.  193 \n supervisory approval will be given (this repurchase / buy -back /redemption of the principal is in a \nsituation other than in the event of exercise of call option by the bank. One of the major differe nces \nis that in the case of the former, the option to offer the instrument for repayment on announcement \nof the decision to repurchase / buy -back /redeem the instrument, would lie with the investors \nwhereas, in case of the latter, it lies with the bank).  \n(ii) Banks may repurchase / buy -back / redeem the instruments only if:  \n(a) They replace such instrument with capital of the same or better quality and the \nreplacement of this capital is done at conditions which are sustainable for the income \ncapacity of the  bank; or  \n(b) The bank demonstrates that its capital position is well above the minimum capital \nrequirements after the repurchase / buy -back / redemption.  \n1.8 Dividend Discretion  \n(i) The bank must have full discretion at all times to c ancel distributions/p ayments166; \n(ii) Cancellation of discretionary payments must  not be an event of default;  \n(iii) Banks must  have full access to cancelled payments to meet obligations as they fall due;  \n(iv) Cancellation of distributions/payments must  not impose restrictions on  the bank except in \nrelation to distributions to common stakeholders; and  \n(v) Dividends must  be paid out of distributable items  only. As regards \u2018distributable items\u2019, it \nis clarified that the dividend on perpetual non -cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) will be paid \nout of current year\u2019s profit only.  \n(vi) The dividend shall not be cumulative. i.e., dividend missed in a year will not be paid in \nfuture years, even if adequate profit is available and the level of CRAR conforms to the regulatory \nminimum. When  dividend is paid at a rate lesser than the prescribed rate, the unpaid amount will \nnot be paid in future years, even if adequate profit is available and the level of CRAR conforms to \nthe regulatory minimum.  \n(vii) The instrument cannot  not have a credit se nsitive coupon feature, i.e. , a dividend that is \nreset periodically based in whole or in part on the banks\u2019 credit standing. For this purpose, any \nreference rate including a broad index which is sensitive to changes to the bank\u2019s own \ncreditworthiness and /  or to changes in the credit worthiness of the wider banking sector will be \n                                                            \n166 Consequence of full discretion at all times to cancel distributions / payments is that \u201cdividend pushers\u201d are \nprohibited. An instrument with a dividend pusher obliges the issuing bank to make a dividend/coupon payment on \nthe instrument if it has made a payment on another (typically more junior) capital instrument or share. This \nobligation is inconsistent with the requirement for full discretion at all times. Furthermore, the term \u201ccancel \ndistributions/payments\u201d means extinguish these payments. It does not permit features that require the bank to \nmake distributions/payments in kind.  194 \n treated as a credit sensitive reference rate. Banks desirous of offering floating reference rate may \ntake prior approval of the RBI (D OR) as regard permissibility of such reference  rates.  \n(viii) In general, it may be in order for banks to have dividend stopper arrangement that stop \ndividend payments on common shares in the event the holders of AT1 instruments are not paid \ndividend/coupon. However, dividend stoppers must not impede t he full discretion that bank must \nhave at all times to cancel distributions/payments on the Additional Tier 1 instrument, nor must \nthey act in a way that could hinder the re -capitalisation of the bank. For example, it would not be \npermitted for a stopper o n an Additional Tier 1 instrument to:  \n\uf0b7 attempt to stop payment on another instrument where the payments on this other \ninstrument were not also fully discretionary;  \n\uf0b7 prevent distributions to shareholders for a period that extends beyond the point in time \nthat dividends/coupons on the Additional Tier 1 instrument are resumed;  \n\uf0b7 impede the normal operation of the bank or any restructuring activity (including \nacquisitions/disposals).  \nA stopper may act to prohibit actions that are equivalent to the payment of a divi dend, such as \nthe bank undertaking discretionary share buybacks, if otherwise permitted . \n1.9 Treatment in Insolvency  \nThe instrument cannot contribute to liabilities exceeding assets if such a balance sheet test forms \npart of a requirement to prove insolven cy under any law or otherwise.  \n1.10 Loss Absorption Features  \nPNCPS should have principal loss absorption through either (i) conversion to common shares at \nan objective pre -specified trigger point or (ii) a write -down mechanism which allocates losses to \nthe instrument at a pre -specified trigger point. The write -down will have the following effects:  \na) Reduce the claim of the instrument in liquidation;  \nb) Reduce the amount re -paid when a call is exercised; and  \nc) Partially or fully reduce dividend payments on the inst rument.  \nVarious criteria for loss absorption through conversion / write -down / write -off on breach of pre -\nspecified trigger and at the point of non -viability are furnished in Annex 16 . \n1.11 Prohibition on Purchase / Funding of PNCPS  \nNeither the bank nor a related party over which the bank exercises control or significant influence \n(as defined under relevant Accounting Standards) should purchase PNCPS, nor can the bank \ndirectly or indirectly should fund the purchase of the instrument. Banks should also not g rant \nadvances against the security of PNCPS issued by them.  \n 195 \n 1.12 Re-capitalisation  \nThe instrument cannot have any features that hinder re -capitalisation, such as provisions which \nrequire the issuer to compensate investors if a new instrument is issued at a lower price during a \nspecified time frame.  \n1.13 Reporting of Non -payment of Dividends  \nAll instances of non -payment of dividends sh all be notified by the issuing banks to the Chief \nGeneral Managers -in-Charge of Department of Regulation and Department of S upervision of the \nReserve Bank of India, Mumbai.  \n1.14 Seniority of Claim  \nThe claims of the investors in instruments shall be  \n(i) Superior to the claims of investors in equity shares;  \n(ii) Subordinated to the claims of PDIs, all Tier 2 regulatory capital in struments, \ndepositors and general creditors of the bank; and  \n(iii) is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer nor related entity or \nother arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the claim vis -\u00e0-vis \nbank creditors . \n1.15 Investment in Instruments Raised in Indian Rupees by Foreign Entities/NRIs  \n(i) Investment by FIIs and NRIs shall be within an overall limit of 49% and 24% of the issue \nrespectively, subject to the investment by each FII not exceeding 10% of the issu e, and \ninvestment by each NRI not exceeding 5% of the issue. Investment by FIIs in these instruments \nshall be outside the ECB limit for rupee -denominated corporate debt, as fixed by Government of \nIndia from time to time. The overall non -resident holding of  Preference Shares and equity shares \nin public sector banks will be subject to the statutory / regulatory limit.  \n(ii) Banks should comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by SEBI / other \nregulatory authorities in regard to issue of the ins truments.  \n1.16 Compliance with Reserve Requirements  \n(i) The funds collected by various branches of the bank or other banks for the issue and held \npending finalisation of allotment of the Additional Tier 1 Preference Shares will have to be taken \ninto accoun t for the purpose of calculating reserve requirements . \n(ii) However, the total amount raised by the bank by issue of PNCPS shall not be reckoned \nas liability for calculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements \nand, as  such, will not attract CRR / SLR requirements . 196 \n 1.17 Reporting of Issuances  \n(i) Banks issuing PNCPS shall submit a report to the Chief General Manager -in-charge, \nDepartment of Regulation, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai giving details of the instrument as pe r \nthe format prescribed in Annex 2 4 duly certified by the compliance officer of the bank , soon after \nthe issue is completed.  \n(ii) The issue -wise details of amount raised as PNCPS qualifying for Additional Tier 1 capital \nby the bank from FIIs / NRIs are req uired to be reported within 30 days of the issue to the Chief \nGeneral Manager, Reserve Bank of India, Foreign Exchange Department, Foreign Investment \nDivision, Central Office, Mumbai 400 001 in the proforma  given at the end of this Annex . The \ndetails of th e secondary market sales / purchases by FIIs and the NRIs in these instruments on \nthe floor of the stock exchange shall be reported by the custodians and designated banks, \nrespectively, to the Reserve Bank of India through the soft copy of the LEC Returns,  on a daily \nbasis, as prescribed in Schedule 2 and 3 of the FEMA Notification No.20 dated 3rd May 2000 , as \namended from time to time.  \n1.18 Investment in Additional Tier 1 Capital Instruments (PNCPS) Issued by Other Banks/ \nFIs \n(i) A bank's investment in PNCPS issued by other banks and financial institutions will be \nreckoned along with the investment in other instruments eligible for capital status while computing \ncompliance with the  overall ceiling of 10% of investing banks' capital funds as prescribed vide \ncircular DBOD.BP.BC.No.3/21.01.002/2004 -05 dated July 6, 2004 . \n(ii) Bank's investments in PNCP S issued by other banks / financial institutions will attract risk \nweight as provided in paragraphs 5.6 and 8.3.5 of this Master Circular, whichever applicable for \ncapital adequacy purposes.  \n(iii) A bank's investments in the PNCPS of other banks will be tr eated as exposure to capital \nmarket and be reckoned for the purpose of compliance with the prudential ceiling for capital \nmarket exposure as fixed by RBI.  \n1.19 Classification in the Balance Sheet  \nPNCPS will be classified as capital and shown under 'Schedul e I - Capital' of the Balance sheet.  \n1.20 PNCPS to Retail Investors167 \nWith a view to enhancing investor education relating to risk characteristics of regulatory capital \nrequirements, banks issuing PNCPS to retail investors, subject to approval of their Boar d, sh ould \nadhere to the following conditions:  \n                                                            \n167 Please refer to circular DBOD.BP.BC.38/21.06.201/2014 -15 dated September 1, 2014  on Implementation of Basel \nIII Capital Regulations in India \u2013 Amendments.  197 \n (a) The requirement for specific sign -off as quoted below, from the investors for having \nunderstood the features and risks of the instrument may be incorporated in the common \napplication form of the proposed is sue. \n\"By making this application, I / We acknowledge that I / We have understood the terms \nand conditions of the Issue of [insert the name of the instruments being issued] of \n[Name of The Bank] as disclosed in the Draft Shelf Prospectus, Shelf Prospectus a nd \nTranche Document\".  \n(b) All the publicity material, application form and other communication with the investor shall \nclearly state in bold letters ( with font size 14 ) how PNCPS is different from common shares. In \naddition, the loss absorbency features of  the instrument should  be clearly explained and the \ninvestor\u2019s sign -off for having understood these features and other terms and conditions of the \ninstrument should  be obtained.  \nReporting Format  \nDetails of Investments by FIIs and NRIs in Perpetual Non -Cumu lative Preference Shares \nqualifying as Additional Tier 1 capital  \n(a) Name of the bank:  \n(b) Total issue size / amount raised (in Rupees):  \n(c) Date of issue:  \n FIIs  NRIs  \nNo Amount raised  No. Amount raised  \nof in Rupees  as a percentage  of in Rupees  as a perc entage  \nFIIs  of the total issue  NRIs   of the total issue  \n  size   size  \n      \n      \n \nIt is certified that  \n(i) the aggregate investment by all FIIs does not exceed 49 % of the issue size and \ninvestment by no individual FII exceeds 10 % of the issue size . \n(ii) It is certified that the aggregate investment by all NRIs does not exceed 24 % of the issue \nsize and investment by no individual NRI exceeds 5 % of the issue size.  \n \nAuthorised Signatory  \nDate  \nSeal of the bank  198 \n Annex 4  \n(cf. para 4.2.4)  \nCriteria for Inc lusion of Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI)  \nin Additional Tier 1 Capital  \nThe Perpetual Debt Instruments that may be issued as bonds or debentures by Indian banks \nshould meet the following terms and conditions to qualify for inclusion in Additional Tier 1 Ca pital \nfor capital adequacy purposes:  \n1. Terms of Issue of Instruments Denominated in Indian Rupees  \n1.1 Paid -in Status  \nThe instruments should be issued by the bank (i.e. , not by any \u2018SPV\u2019 etc. set up by the bank for \nthis purpose) and fully paid -in.  \n1.2 Amount  \nThe amount of PDI to be raised may be decided by the Board of Directors of banks.  \n1.3 Limits  \nWhile complying with minimum Tier 1 of 7% of risk weighted assets, a bank cannot admit, \nPerpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) together with Perpetual Non -Cumulativ e Preference Shares \n(PNCPS) in Additional Tier 1 Capital, more than 1.5% of risk weighted assets. However, once this \nminimum total Tier 1 capital has been complied with, any additional PNCPS and PDI issued by \nthe bank can be included in Total Tier 1 capita l reported. Excess PNCPS and PDI can be \nreckoned to comply with Tier 2 capital if the latter is less than 2% of RWAs i.e. , while complying \nwith minimum Total Capital of 9% of risk weighted assets.  \n1.4 Maturity Period  \nThe PDIs shall be perpetual i.e. , there  is no maturity date and there are no step -ups or other \nincentives to redeem . \n1.5 Rate of Interest  \nThe interest payable to the investors may be either at a fixed rate or at a floating rate referenced \nto a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate.  \n1.6 Optionality  \nPDIs shall not have any \u2018put option\u2019. However, banks may issue the instruments with a call option \nat a particular date subject to following conditions : \na. The call option on the instrument is permissible after the instrument has run for at le ast \nfive years ; 199 \n b. To exercise a call option a bank must receive prior approval of RBI (Department of \nRegulation) ; \nc. A bank must not do anything which creates an expectation that the call will be exercised. \nFor example, to preclude such expectation of the  instrument being called, the dividend / \ncoupon reset date need not be co -terminus with the call date. Banks may, at their \ndiscretion, consider having an appropriate gap between dividend / coupon reset date and \ncall date ; and  \nd. Banks must  not exercise a c all unless:  \n(i) They replace the called instrument with capital of the same or better quality and \nthe replacement of this capital is done at conditions which are sustainable for the income \ncapacity of the bank168; or \n(ii) The bank demonstrates that its capit al position is well above the minimum capital \nrequirements after the call option is exercised169. \nThe use of tax event and regulatory event calls may be permitted. However, exercise of the calls \non account of these events is subject to the requirements set o ut in points (b) to (d) of criterion \n1.6. RBI will permit the bank to exercise the call only if the RBI is convinced that the bank was not \nin a position to anticipate these events at the time of issuance of PDIs.  \nTo illustrate, if there is a change in tax treatment which makes the capital instrument with tax \ndeductible coupons into an instrument with non -tax deductible coupons, then the bank would have \nthe option (not obligation) to repurchase the instrument. In such a situation, a bank may be \nallowed to re place the capital instrument with another capital instrument that perhaps does have \ntax deductible coupons. Similarly, if there is a downgrade of the instrument in regulatory \nclassification (e.g. , if it is decided by the RBI to exclude an instrument from r egulatory capital) the \nbank has the option to call the instrument and replace it with an instrument with a better regulatory \nclassification, or a lower coupon with the same regulatory classification with prior approval of RBI. \nHowever, banks may not create  an expectation / signal an early redemption / maturity of the \nregulatory capital instrument.  \n1.7 Repurchase / Buy -back / Redemption  \n(i) Principal of the instruments may be repaid (e.g. , through repurchase or redemption) only \nwith prior approval of RBI and  banks should not assume or create market expectations that \nsupervisory approval will be given (this repurchase / buy -back /redemption of the principal is in a \nsituation other than in the event of exercise of call option by the bank. One of the major diffe rences \n                                                            \n168 Replacement issues can be concurrent with but not after the instrument is called.  \n169 Minimum refers to Common Equity Tier 1 of 8% of RWAs (including capital conservation buffer of 2. 5% of RWAs) \nand Total capital of 11.5% of RWAs including additional capital requirements identified under Pillar 2.  200 \n is that in the case of the former, the option to offer the instrument for repayment on announcement \nof the decision to repurchase / buy -back /redeem the instrument, would lie with the investors \nwhereas, in case of the latter, it lies with the bank).  \n(ii) Banks may repurchase / buy -back / redemption only if:  \n(a) They replace such instrument with capital of the same or better quality and the \nreplacement of this capital is done at conditions which are sustainable for the income \ncapacity of the bank; or  \n(b) The bank demonstrates that its capital position is well above the minimum capital \nrequirements after the repurchase / buy -back / redemption.  \n1.8 Coupon Discretion  \n(a) The bank must have full discretion at all times to cancel distributions/payments170 \n(b) Cancellation of discretionary payments must not be an event of default  \n(c) Banks must have full access to cancelled payments to meet obligations as they fall due  \n(d) Cancellation of distributions/payments must not impose restrictions on the bank except \nin relation to distributions to common stakeholders.  \n(e) Coupons must be paid out of \u2018distributable items\u2019171. In this context, coupon may be paid \nout of current year profits. However, if current year profits are not sufficient, coupon may \nbe paid subject to a vailability of:  \n(i) Profits brought forward from previous years, and/or  \n(ii) Reserves representing appropriation of net profits, including statutory reserves, \nand excluding share premium, revaluation reserve, foreign currency translation \nreserve, investmen t reserve and reserves created on amalgamation.  \nThe accumulated losses and deferred revenue expenditure, if any, shall be netted off \nfrom (i) and (ii) to arrive at the available balances for payment of coupon.  \nIf the aggregate of: (a) profits in the curren t year; (b) profits brought forward from the \nprevious years and (c) permissible reserves as at (ii) above, excluding statutory reserves, \n                                                            \n170 Consequence of full discretion at all times to cancel distributions/payments is that \u201cdividend pushers\u201d are \nprohibited. An instrument with  a dividend pusher obliges the issuing bank to make a dividend/coupon payment on \nthe instrument if it has made a payment on another (typically more junior) capital instrument or share. This \nobligation is inconsistent with the requirement for full discretio n at all times. Furthermore, the term \u201ccancel \ndistributions/payments\u201d means extinguish these payments. It does not permit features that require the bank to \nmake distributions/payments in kind.  \n171 Please refer circular no. DBR.BP.BC.No.50/21.06.201/2016 -17 dated February 02, 2017  on 'Basel III Capital \nRegulations - Additional Tier 1 Capital'.  201 \n net of accumulated losses and deferred revenue expenditure are less than the amount \nof coupon, only then the bank shall  make appropriation from the statutory reserves. In \nsuch cases, banks are required to report to the Reserve Bank within twenty -one days \nfrom the date of such appropriation in compliance with Section 17(2) of the Banking \nRegulation Act 1949.  \nIt may be noted  that prior approval of the Reserve Bank for appropriation of reserves as \nabove, in terms of the circular, DBOD.BP.BC No.31/21.04.018/2006 -07 dated \nSeptember 20, 2006  on \u2018Sect ion 17 (2) of Banking Regulation Act, 1949 - Appropriation \nfrom Reserve Fund\u2019 is not required in this regard.  \nHowever, payment of coupons on PDIs from the reserves is subject to the issuing bank \nmeeting minimum regulatory requirements for CET1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios \nincluding the additional capital requirements for Domestic Systemically Important Banks \nat all times and subject to the restrictions under the capital buffer frameworks (i.e. capital \nconservation buffer and counter cyclical capital buf fer in terms of paras 15 and 17 of this \nMaster Circular ). \nIn order to meet the eligibility criteria for perpetual debt instruments, banks must ensure \nand indicate in their offer documents that they have full discretion at all times to cancel \ndistributions / payments.  \n(f) the interest shall not be cumulative.  \n(g) The instrument cannot have a credit sensitive coupon feature, i.e. , a dividend that is reset \nperiodically based in whole or in part on the banks\u2019 credit standing. For this purpose, any \nreference rat e including a broad index which is sensitive to changes to the bank\u2019s own \ncreditworthiness and / or to changes in the credit worthiness of the wider banking sector \nwill be treated as a credit sensitive reference rate. Banks desirous of offering floating \nreference rate may take prior approval of the RBI (DOR) as regard permissibility of such \nreference rates.  \n(h) In general, it may be in order for banks to have dividend stopper arrangement that stop \ndividend payments on common shares in the event the holders of AT1 instruments are \nnot paid dividend/coupon. However, dividend stoppers must not impede the full discretion \nthat bank must have at all times to cancel distributions/payments on the Additional Tier 1 \ninstrument, nor must they act in a way that could hin der the re -capitalisation of the bank. \nFor example, it would not be permitted for a stopper on an Additional Tier 1 instrument \nto: \n\u2022 attempt to stop payment on another instrument where the payments on this other \ninstrument were not also fully discretionary ; 202 \n \u2022 prevent distributions to shareholders for a period that extends beyond the point in time \nthat dividends/coupons on the Additional Tier 1 instrument are resumed;  \n\u2022 impede the normal operation of the bank or any restructuring activity (including \nacquisit ions/disposals).  \nA stopper may act to prohibit actions that are equivalent to the payment of a dividend, such as \nthe bank undertaking discretionary share buybacks, if otherwise permitted . \n1.9 Treatment in Insolvency  \nThe instrument cannot contribute to liab ilities exceeding assets if such a balance sheet test forms \npart of a requirement to prove insolvency under any law or otherwise.  \n1.10 Loss Absorption Features  \nPDIs may be classified as liabilities for accounting purposes (not for the purpose of insolvency  as \nindicated in paragraph 1.9 above). In such cases, these instruments must have principal loss \nabsorption through either (i) conversion to common shares at an objective pre -specified trigger \npoint or (ii) a write -down mechanism which allocates losses to the instrument at a pre -specified \ntrigger point. The write -down will have the following effects : \na) Reduce the claim of the instrument in liquidation;  \nb) Reduce the amount re -paid when a call is exercised; and  \nc) Partially or fully reduce coupon payments on the ins trument.  \nVarious criteria for loss absorption through conversion / write -down / write -off on breach of pre -\nspecified trigger and at the point of non -viability are furnished in Annex 16 . \n1.11 Prohibition on Purchase / Funding of Instruments  \nNeither the bank  nor a related party over which the bank exercises control or significant influence \n(as defined under relevant Accounting Standards) should purchase the instrument, nor can the \nbank directly or indirectly fund the purchase of the instrument. Banks should a lso not grant \nadvances against the security of the debt instruments issued by them . \n1.12 Re-capitalisation  \nThe instrument cannot have any features that hinder re -capitalisation, such as provisions which \nrequire the issuer to compensate investors if a new i nstrument is issued at a lower price during a \nspecified time frame . \n1.13 Reporting of Non -payment of Coupons  \nAll instances of non -payment of coupon should be notified by the issuing banks to the Chief \nGeneral Managers -in-Charge of Department of Regulation and Department of Supervision of the \nReserve Bank of India, Mumbai . 203 \n 1.14 Seniority of Claim  \nThe claims of the investors in instruments shall be  \n(i) superior to the claims of investors in equity shares and perpetual non -cumulative \npreference shares;  \n(ii) subordinated to the claims of depositors, general creditors and subordinated debt \nof the bank; \n(iii) is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer nor related entity or \nother arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of th e claim vis -\u00e0-vis \nbank creditors.  \n1.15 Investment in Instruments Raised in Indian Rupees by Foreign Entities/NRIs  \n(i) Investment by FIIs in instruments raised in Indian Rupees shall be outside the ECB limit \nfor rupee denominated corporate debt, as fixed by  the Govt. of India from time to time, for \ninvestment by FIIs in corporate debt instruments. Investment in these instruments by FIIs and \nNRIs shall be within an overall limit of 49% and 24% of the issue, respectively, subject to the \ninvestment by each FII not exceeding 10% of the issue and investment by each NRI not exceeding \n5% of the issue.  \n(ii) Banks should comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by SEBI / other \nregulatory authorities in regard to issue of the instruments . \n1.16 Terms of Issue of Instruments Denominated in Foreign Currency / Rupee \nDenominated Bonds Overseas  \nBanks may augment their capital funds through the issue of PDIs in foreign currency / rupee \ndenominated bonds overseas  without seeking the prior approval of the Reserve B ank of India, \nsubject to compliance with the  FEMA guidelines as applicable and the  requirements mentioned \nbelow:  \n(i) These i nstruments shall comply with all terms and conditions as applicable to the \ninstruments issued in Indian Rupees.  \n(ii) Not more than 4 9% of the eligible amount can be issued in foreign currency172 and/or in \nrupee denominated bonds overseas173. \n                                                            \n172 Not applicable to foreign banks\u2019 branches.

Introduction  \nWith a view to providing market participants a tool to transfer and manage credit risk associated \nwith corporate bonds, Reserve Bank of India has introduced single name CDS on corporate \nbonds. Banks can undertake transactions in such CDS, both as market -makers as well as users. \nAs users, banks can buy CDS to hedge a Banking Book or Trad ing Book exposure. The prudential \nguidelines dealing with CDS are dealt with in the following paragraphs .  \n2. Definitions  \nThe following definitions are used in these guidelines:  \n(i)  Credit event payment - the amount which is payable by the credit protec tion provider \nto the credit protection buyer under the terms of the credit derivative contract following \nthe occurrence of a credit event. The payment can be in the form of physical \nsettlement  (payment of par in exchange for physical delivery of a delivera ble \nobligation of the reference entity) or cash settlement  (either a payment determined \non a par -less-recovery basis, i.e. , determined using the par value of the reference \nobligation less that obligation\u2019s recovery value, or a fixed amount, or a fixed \npercentage of the par amount).   \n(ii)  Deliverable asset / obligation - any obligation187 of the reference entity which can \nbe delivered, under the terms of the contract, if a credit event occurs. [A deliverable \nobligation is relevant for credit derivatives that are to be physically settled.]  \n(iii)  Reference obligation - the obligation188 used to calculate the amount payable when \na credit event occurs under the terms of a credit derivative contract. [A reference \nobligation is relevant for obligations that are to be  cash settled (on a par -less-recovery \nbasis).]  \n(iv)  Underlying asset / obligation - The asset189 which a protection buyer is seeking to \nhedge.  \n \n                                                            \n187 For the present, only the deliverable obligations specified in the guidelines on CDS vide circular IDMD.PCD.No. \n5053 /14.03.04/2010 -11 dated May 23, 2011  will be permitted.  \n188 Please refer to paragraph 2.4 of the circular ID MD.PCD.No. 5053 /14.03.04/2010 -11 dated May 23, 2011 . \n189 Please refer to paragraph 2.4 of the circular IDMD.PCD.No. 5053 /14.03.04/2010 -11 dated May 23, 2011 . 220 \n 3. Classification of CDS into Trading Book and Banking Book Positions  \nFor the purpose of capital adequacy for CDS transactions, Trading Book would comprise Held for \nTrading positions and Banking Book would comprise Held to Maturity and Available for Sale \npositions. A CDS being a financial derivative will be classified in the Trading Book except when it \nis contract ed and designated as a hedge for a Banking Book exposure. Thus, the CDS positions \nheld in the Trading Book would include positions which:  \na) arise from market -making;  \nb) are meant for hedging the exposures in the Trading Book;  \nc) are held for short -term resale; and  \nd) are taken by the bank with the intention of benefiting in the short -term from the actual and \n/ or expected differences between their buying and selling prices  \nCDS positions meant for hedging Banking Book exposures will be classified in the Banking Bo ok. \nHowever, all CDS positions, either in Banking Book or Trading Book, should be marked -to-market. \nAll CDS positions should meet the operational requirements indicated in paragraph 4 below.  \n4. Operational requirements for CDS to be recognised as eligible  External / Third -party \nhedges for Trading Book and Banking Book  \n(a) A CDS contract should represent a direct claim on the protection provider and should be \nexplicitly referenced to specific exposure, so that the extent of the cover is clearly defined \nand incontrovertible.  \n(b) Other than non -payment by a protection purchaser of premium in respect of the credit \nprotection contract it should be irrevocable.  \n(c) There should be no clause in the contract that would allow the protection provider \nunilaterally to cancel the credit cover or that would increase the effective cost of cover \nas a result of deteriorating credit quality in the hedged exposure.  \n(d) The CDS contract should be unconditional; there should be no clause in the protection \ncontract outside th e direct control of the bank (protection buyer) that could prevent the \nprotection provider from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the \noriginal counterparty fails to make the payment(s) due.  \n(e) The credit events specified by th e contracting parties should at a minimum cover:  \n(i) failure to pay the amounts due under terms of the underlying obligation that are in \neffect at the time of such failure (with a grace period that is closely in line with the \ngrace period in the underlyin g obligation);  221 \n (ii) bankruptcy, insolvency or inability of the obligor to pay its debts, or its failure or \nadmission in writing of its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due, \nand analogous events; and  \n(iii) restructuring of the underlyin g obligation (as contemplated in the IDMD guidelines \non CDS dated May 23, 2011) involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, \ninterest or fees that results in a credit loss event (i.e. charge -off, specific provision \nor other similar debit to the prof it and loss account);  \n(iv) when the restructuring of the underlying obligation is not covered by the CDS, but \nthe other requirements in paragraph 4 are met, partial recognition of the CDS will \nbe allowed. If the amount of the CDS is less than or equal to the amount of the \nunderlying obligation, 60% of the amount of the hedge can be recognised as \ncovered. If the amount of the CDS is larger than that of the underlying obligation, \nthen the amount of eligible hedge is capped at 60% of the amount of the underly ing \nobligation.  \n(f) If the CDS specifies deliverable obligations that are different from the underlying \nobligation, the resultant asset mismatch will be governed under paragraph (k) below.  \n(g) The CDS shall not terminate prior to expiration of any grace period required for a default \non the underlying obligation to occur as a result of a failure to pay190.  \n(h) The CDS allowing for cash settlement are recognised for capital purposes insofar as a \nrobust valuation process is in place in order to estimate loss reliably. There should be a \nclearly specified period for obtaining post -credit event valuations of the underlying \nobligation. If the reference obligation specified in the CDS for purposes of cash \nsettlement is different than the underlying obligation, the resultant asset mismatch will \nbe governed under paragraph (k) below.  \n(i) If the protection purchaser\u2019s right/ability to transfer the underlying obligation to the \nprotection provider is required for settlement, the terms of the underlying obligation \nshould  provide that any required consent to such transfer may not be unreasonably \nwithheld.  \n(j) The identity of the parties responsible for determining whether a credit event has \noccurred should be clearly defined. This determination should not be the sole \nresponsibility of the protection seller. The protection buyer should have the right/ability \nto inform the protection provider of the occurrence of a credit event.  \n                                                            \n190 The maturi ty of the underlying exposure and the maturity of the hedge should be defined conservatively. The \neffective maturity of the underlying should be gauged as the longest possible remaining time before the \ncounterparty is scheduled to fulfill its obligation, t aking into account any applicable grace period.  222 \n (k) A mismatch between the underlying obligation and the reference obligation or deliverable \nobligation under the CDS (i.e. the obligation used for purposes of determining cash \nsettlement value or the deliverable obligation) is permissible if (1) the reference obligation \nor deliverable obligation ranks pari passu with or is junior to the underlying o bligation, \nand (2) the underlying obligation and reference obligation or deliverable obligation share \nthe same obligor (i.e. the same legal entity) and legally enforceable cross -default or \ncross -acceleration clauses are in place.  \n(l) A mismatch between the  underlying obligation and the obligation used for purposes of \ndetermining whether a credit event has occurred is permissible if (1) the latter obligation \nranks pari passu with or is junior to the underlying obligation, and (2) the underlying \nobligation an d reference obligation share the same obligor (i.e. the same legal entity) \nand legally enforceable cross -default or cross acceleration clauses are in place.  \n5. Capital Adequacy Requirement for CDS Positions in the Banking Book  \n5.1  Recognition of Externa l/Third -party CDS Hedges  \n5.1.1  In case of Banking Book positions hedged by bought CDS positions, no exposure will be \nreckoned against the reference entity / underlying asset in respect of the hedged exposure, and \nexposure will be deemed to have been subst ituted by the protection seller, if the following \nconditions are satisfied:  \n(a) Operational requirements mentioned in paragraph 4 are met;  \n(b) The risk weight applicable to the protection seller under the Basel II191 Standardised \nApproach for credit risk i s lower than that of the underlying asset; and  \n(c) There is no maturity mismatch between the underlying asset and the reference / \ndeliverable obligation. If this condition is not satisfied, then the amount of credit protection \nto be recognised should be c omputed as indicated in paragraph 5.1.3 (ii) below.  \n5.1.2  If the conditions (a) and (b) above are not satisfied or the bank breaches any of these \nconditions subsequently, the bank shall reckon the exposure on the underlying asset; and the \nCDS position wil l be transferred to Trading Book where it will be subject to specific risk, \ncounterparty credit risk and general market risk (wherever applicable) capital requirements as \napplicable to Trading Book.  \n5.1.3  The unprotected portion of the underlying exposure  should be risk -weighted as applicable \nunder Basel II framework. The amount of credit protection shall be adjusted if there are any \nmismatches between the underlying asset/ obligation and the reference / deliverable asset / \n                                                            \n191 Basel II Framework has been modified and enhanced by Basel III capital regulations. Therefore, a reference to \nBasel II Framework in this Annex should now be construed as reference to Basel III guidelines as  contained in this \nMaster Circular  223 \n obligation with regard to asset or maturity . These are dealt with in detail in the following \nparagraphs.  \n(i) Asset mismatches  \nAsset mismatch will arise if the underlying asset is different from the reference asset or deliverable \nobligation. Protection will be reckoned as available by t he protection buyer only if the mismatched \nassets meet the requirements specified in paragraph 4 (k) above.  \n(ii) Maturity mismatches  \nThe protection buyer would be eligible to reckon the amount of protection if the maturity of the \ncredit derivative contra ct were to be equal or more than the maturity of the underlying asset. If, \nhowever, the maturity of the CDS contract is less than the maturity of the underlying asset, then \nit would be construed as a maturity mismatch. In case of maturity mismatch the amou nt of \nprotection will be determined in the following manner:  \na. If the residual maturity of the credit derivative product is less than three months no \nprotection will be recognized.  \nb. If the residual maturity of the credit derivative contract is three m onths or more \nprotection proportional to the period for which it is available will be recognised. When \nthere is a maturity mismatch the following adjustment will be applied.  \nPa = P x (t - .25) \u00f7 (T - .25) \nWhere:  \nPa = value of the credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch  \nP = credit protection  \nt = min (T, residual maturity of the credit protection arrangement) expressed in years  \nT = min (5, residual maturity of the underlying exposure) expressed in years  \nExample: Suppose the underlying asset is a c orporate bond of Face Value of Rs. 100 \nwhere the residual maturity is of 5 years and the residual maturity of the CDS is 4 years. \nThe amount of credit protection is computed as under:  \n100 * {(4 -.25) \u00f7 (5 -.25)} = 100*(3.75\u00f7 4.75) = 78.95  \nc. Once the residu al maturity of the CDS contract reaches three months , protection \nceases to be recognised.  \n \n 224 \n 5.2 Internal Hedges  \nBanks can use CDS contracts to hedge against the credit risk in their existing corporate bonds \nportfolios. A bank can hedge a Banking Book cre dit risk exposure either by an internal hedge (the \nprotection purchased from the trading desk of the bank and held in the Trading Book) or an \nexternal hedge (protection purchased from an eligible third party protection provider). When a \nbank hedges a Banki ng Book credit risk exposure (corporate bonds) using a CDS booked in its \nTrading Book (i.e. using an internal hedge), the Banking Book exposure is not deemed to be \nhedged for capital purposes unless the bank transfers the credit risk from the Trading Book to an \neligible third party protection provider through a CDS meeting the requirements of paragraph 5.1 \nvis-\u00e0-vis the Banking Book exposure. Where such third party protection is purchased and is \nrecognised as a hedge of a Banking Book exposure for regulator y capital purposes, no capital is \nrequired to be maintained on internal and external CDS hedge. In such cases, the external CDS \nwill act as indirect hedge for the Banking Book exposure and the capital adequacy in terms of \nparagraph 5.1, as applicable for e xternal / third party hedges, will be applicable.  \n6. Capital Adequacy for CDS in the Trading Book  \n6.1 General Market Risk  \nA credit default swap does not normally create a position for general market risk for either the \nprotection buyer or protection sell er. However, the present value of premium payable / receivable \nis sensitive to changes in the interest rates. In order to measure the interest rate risk in premium \nreceivable/payable, the present value of the premium can be treated as a notional position i n \nGovernment securities of relevant maturity. These positions will attract appropriate capital charge \nfor general market risk. The protection buyer / seller will treat the present value of the premium \npayable / receivable equivalent to a short / long notio nal position in Government securities of \nrelevant maturity.  \n6.2 Specific Risk for Exposure to Reference Entity  \nA CDS creates a notional long / short position for specific risk in the reference asset / obligation \nfor protection seller / protection buyer. For calculating specific risk capital charge, the notional \namount of the CDS and its maturity should be used. The specific risk capital charge for CDS \npositions will be as per Table -1 and Table -2 below.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 225 \n Table -1: Specific risk capital charges for bo ught and sold CDS positions in the \nTrading Book: Exposures to entities other than   \nCommercial Real Estate Companies/ NBFC -ND-SI \nUpto 90 days  After 90 days192 \nRatings by the \nECAI* Residual \nMaturity of the \ninstrument  Capital charge  Ratings by the \nECAI * Capita l charge  \nAAA to BBB  6 months or \nless 0.28 %  AAA 1.8 %  \nGreater than 6 \nmonths and up \nto and including \n24 months  1.14%  AA 2.7%  \nExceeding 24 \nmonths  1.80%  A 4.5%  \nBBB 9.0%  \nBB and below  All maturities  13.5%  BB and below  13.5%  \nUnrated (if \npermitted)  All maturities  9.0%  Unrated (if \npermitted)  9.0%  \n* These ratings indicate the ratings assigned by Indian rating agencies / ECAIs or foreign rating \nagencies.

Capital charge for exposures to \nCommercial Real Estate Companies / NBFC -ND-SI beyond 90 days shall be taken at 9.0%, \nregardless of rating of the reference /deliverable obligation.  \n                                                            \n192 Under Basel II, the specific risk capital charge for risk exposures to corporate bonds, CDS contracts, etc., held in \nTrading Book have been calibrated, keeping in view the generally short time horizon of the Trading Boo k. In case \nsuch positions remain in the Trading Book for longer time horizons, these are exposed to higher credit risk. In such \ncases, the normal specific risk capital charge will be inadequate. Hence, the specific risk capital charges on exposures \nremaini ng in Trading Book beyond 90 days have been suitably increased.  226 \n * These ratings indicate the rati ngs assigned by Indian rating agencies / ECAIs or foreign rating \nagencies. In the case of foreign ECAIs, the rating symbols used here correspond to Standard and \nPoor. The modifiers \u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201d have been subsumed within the main category.  \n6.2.1  Specific Ris k Capital Charges for Positions Hedged by CDS193 \n(i) Banks may fully offset the specific risk capital charges when the values of two legs (i.e. \nlong and short in CDS positions) always move in the opposite direction and broadly to the same \nextent. This would be the case when the two legs consist of completely identical CDS . In these \ncases, no specific risk capital requirement applies to both sides of the CDS positions.  \n(ii) Banks may offset 80 per cent of the specific risk capital charges when the value of tw o \nlegs (i.e. , long and short) always moves in the opposite direction but not broadly to the same \nextent194. This would be the case when a long cash position is hedged by a credit default swap \nand there is an exact match in terms of the reference / deliverabl e obligation, and the maturity of \nboth the reference / deliverable obligation and the CDS. In addition, key features of the CDS (e.g. , \ncredit event definitions, settlement mechanisms) should not cause the price movement of the \nCDS to materially deviate fro m the price movements of the cash position. To the extent that the \ntransaction transfers risk, an 80% specific risk offset will be applied to the side of the transaction \nwith the higher capital charge, while the specific risk requirement on the other side will be zero195.  \n(iii) Banks may offset partially the specific risk capital charges when the value of the two legs \n(i.e., long and short) usually moves in the opposite direction. This would be the case in the \nfollowing situations:  \n(a) The position is captu red in paragraph 6.2.1 (ii) but there is an asset mismatch between \nthe cash position and the CDS. However, the underlying asset is included in the \n(reference / deliverable) obligations in the CDS documentation and meets the \nrequirements of paragraph 4 (k).   \n(b) The position is captured in paragraph 6.2.1 (ii) but there is maturity mismatch between \ncredit protection and the underlying asset. However, the underlying asset is included \nin the (reference / deliverable) obligations in the CDS documentation.  \n                                                            \n193 This paragraph will be applicable only in those cases where a CDS position is explicitly meant for hedging a Trading \nBook exposure. In other words, a bank cannot treat a CDS position as a he dge against any other Trading Book \nexposure if it was not intended to be as such ab initio . \n194 A cash position in corporate bond in Trading Book hedged by a CDS position, even where the reference obligation \nand the underlying bonds are the same, will not qu alify for 100% offset because a CDS cannot guarantee a 100% \nmatch between the market value of CDS and the appreciation / depreciation in the underlying bond at all times. This \nparagraph will apply only when two legs consist of completely identical CDS inst ruments.  \n195 For example, if specific risk charge on long position (corporate bond) comes to Rs.1000 and that on the short \nposition (credit protection bought through CDS) comes to Rs.700, there will be no capital change on the short \nposition and the long pos ition will attract specific risk capital charge of Rs.200 (1000 -80% of 1000). Banks will not be \nallowed to offset specific risk charges between two opposite CDS positions which are not completely identical.  227 \n (c) In each of the cases in paragraph (a) and (b) above, rather than applying specific risk \ncapital requirements on each side of the transaction (i.e. , the credit protection and the \nunderlying asset), only higher of the two capital requirements will apply.  \n6.2.2 Specific Risk Charge in CDS Positions which are not meant for Hedging  \nIn cases not captured in paragraph 6.2.1, a specific risk capital charge will be assessed against \nboth sides of the positions.  \n7 Capital Charge for Counterparty Credit Risk  \nThe cr edit exposure for the purpose of counterparty credit risk on account of CDS transactions in \nthe Trading Book will be calculated according to the Current Exposure Method196 under Basel II \nframework.  \n7.1 Protection Seller  \nA protection seller will have exposur e to the protection buyer only if the fee / premia are \noutstanding. In such cases, the counterparty credit risk charge for all single name long CDS \npositions in the Trading Book will be calculated as the sum of the current marked -to-market value, \nif positi ve (zero, if marked -to-market value is negative) and the potential future exposure add -on \nfactors based on Table 3 given below. However, the add -on will be capped to the amount of \nunpaid premia.  \nTable 3: Add -on factors for Protection sellers  \n(As % of Notio nal Principal of CDS)  \nType of Reference Obligation197 Add-on factor  \nObligations rated BBB - and above  10% \nBelow BBB - and unrated  20% \n7.2 Protection Buyer  \nA CDS contract creates a counterparty exposure on the protection seller on account of the credit \neven t payment. The counterparty credit risk charge for all short CDS positions in the Trading Book \n                                                            \n196 A CDS contract, which is required to be marked -to-market, creates bilateral exposure for the parties to the \ncontract. The mark -to-market value of a CDS contract is the difference between the default -adjusted present value \nof protection payment (called \u201cprotection leg\u201d / \u201ccredit leg\u201d) and the present va lue of premium payable called \n(\u201cpremium leg\u201d). If the value of credit leg is less than the value of the premium leg, then the marked -to-market value \nfor the protection seller in positive. Therefore, the protection seller will have exposure to the counterpa rty \n(protection buyer) if the value of premium leg is more than the value of credit leg. In case, no premium is outstanding, \nthe value of premium leg will be zero and the mark -to-market value of the CDS contract will always be negative for \nthe protection s eller and therefore, protection seller will not have any exposure to the protection buyer. In no case, \nthe protection seller\u2019s exposure on protection buyer can exceed the amount of the premium unpaid. For the purpose \nof capital adequacy as well as exposure  norms, the measure of counterparty exposures in case of CDS transaction \nheld in Trading Book is the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) which is measured and recognised as per Current \nExposure Method.  \n197 The add -on factors will be the same regardless of maturi ty of the reference obligations or CDS contract.  228 \n will be calculated as the sum of the current marked -to-market value, if positive (zero, if marked -\nto-market value is negative) and the potential future exposure add-on factors based on Table 4 \ngiven below:  \nTable 4: Add -on factors for Protection Buyers  \n(As % of Notional Principal of CDS)  \nType of Reference Obligation198 Add-on factor  \nObligations rated BBB - and above  10% \nBelow BBB - and unrated  20% \n7.3 Capital Charge  for Counterparty risk for Collateralised Transactions in CDS  \nAs mentioned in paragraph 3.3 of the circular IDMD.PCD.No. 5053/14.03.04/2010 -11 dated May \n23, 2011 , collate rals and margins would be maintained by the individual market participants. The \ncounterparty exposure for CDS traded in the OTC market will be calculated as per the Current \nExposure Method. Under this method, the calculation of the counterparty credit risk  charge for an \nindividual contract, taking into account the collateral, will be as follows:  \nCounterparty risk capital charge = [(RC + add -on) \u2013 CA] x r x 9%  \nwhere:  \nRC = the replacement cost,  \nadd-on = the amount for potential future exposure calculated a ccording to paragraph 7 \nabove.  \nCA = the volatility adjusted amount of eligible collateral under the comprehensive approach \nprescribed in paragraphs 7.3 \u201cCredit Risk Mitigation Techniques - Collateralised \nTransactions\u201d of these guidelines, or zero if no eli gible collateral is applied to the transaction, \nand  \nr = the risk weight of the counterparty.  \n8. Treatment of Exposures Below Materiality Thresholds  \nMateriality thresholds on payments below which no payment is made in the event of loss are \nequivalent to retained first loss positions and should be assigned risk weight of 1250% for capital \nadequacy purpose by the protection buyer.  \n9. General Provisions Requirements  \nAt present, general provisions (standard asset provisions) are required only for Loans and \nAdvances and the positive marked -to-market values of derivatives contracts. For all CDS \n                                                            \n198 The add -on factors will be the same regardless of maturity of the reference obligations or CDS contract.  229 \n positions including the hedged positions, both in the Banking Book and Trading Book, banks \nshould hold general provisions for gross positive marked -to-market values of the CDS contracts.  \n10. Prudential Treatment Post -Credit Event  \n10.1 Protection Buyer  \nIn case the credit event payment is not received within the period as stipulated in the CDS \ncontract, the protection buyer shall ignore the credit protection of the CDS and reckon the credit \nexposure on the underlying asset and maintain appropriate level of capital and provisions as \nwarranted for the exposure. On receipt of the credit event payment, (a) the underlying asset shall \nbe removed from the books if it has been d elivered to the protection seller or (b) the book value \nof the underlying asset shall be reduced to the extent of credit event payment received if the credit \nevent payment does not fully cover the book value of the underlying asset and appropriate \nprovisio ns shall be maintained for the reduced value.  \n10.2 Protection Seller  \n10.2.1  From the date of credit event and until the credit event payment in accordance with the \nCDS contract, the protection seller shall debit the Profit and Loss account and recognise a liability \nto pay to the protection buyer, for an amount equal to fair value of the contract (notional of credit \nprotection less expected recovery value). In case, the fair value of the deliverable obligation (in \ncase of physical settlement) / reference o bligation (in case of cash settlement) is not available \nafter the date of the credit event, then until the time that value is available, the protection seller \nshould debit the Profit and Loss account for the full amount of the protection sold and recognise  \na liability to pay to the protection buyer equal to that amount.  \n10.2.2  In case of physical settlement, after the credit event payment, the protection seller shall \nrecognise the assets received, if any, from the protection buyer at the fair value. These \ninvestments will be classified as non -performing investments and valued in terms of paragraph \n3.19 of the Master Direction \u2013 Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of \nCommercial Banks (Directions), 2021. Thereafter, the protection seller shall subject these assets \nto the appropriate prudential treatment as applicable to corporate bonds.  \n11. Exposure Norms  \n11.1 For the present, the CDS is primarily intended to provide an avenue to investors for \nhedging credit risk in the corporate bonds, after they have invested in the bonds. It should, \ntherefore, not be used as a substitute for a bank guarantee. Accordingly, a bank should not sell \ncredit protection by writing a CDS on a corporate bond on the date of its issuance in the primary 230 \n mark et or undertake, before or at the time of issuance of the bonds, to write such protection in \nfuture199.  \n11.2 Exposure on account of all CDS contracts will be aggregated and combined with other on -\nbalance sheet and off -balance sheet exposures against the ref erence entity for the purpose of \ncomplying with the exposure norms.  \n11.3 Protection Seller  \n(i) A protection seller will recognise an exposure to the reference entity of the CDS \ncontract equal to the amount of credit protection sold, subject to paragraph (ii) below.  \n(ii) If a market maker has two completely identical opposite positions in CDS forming a \nhedged position which qualifies for capital adequacy treatment in terms of paragraph \n6.2.1(i), no exposure would be reckoned against the reference entity.  \n(iii) Protection seller will also recognise an exposure to the counterparty equal to the total \ncredit exposure calculated under Current Exposure Method as prescribed in Basel II \nframework in the case of all CDS positions held in the Trading Book.  \n11.4 Protection Buyer  \n(i) In respect of obligations hedged in the Banking Book as indicated in paragraph 5.1 \nand Trading Book as indicated in paragraph 6.2.1 (ii), the protection buyer will not \nreckon any exposure on the reference entity. The exposure will be de emed to have \nbeen transferred on the protection seller to the extent of protection available.  \n(ii) In all other cases where the obligations in Banking Book or Trading Book are hedged \nby CDS positions, the protection buyer will continue to reckon the expos ure on the \nreference entity equal to the outstanding position of the underlying asset.  \n(iii) For all bought CDS positions (hedged and un -hedged) held in Trading Book, the \nprotection buyer will also reckon exposure on the counterparties to the CDS contract s \nas measured by the Current Exposure Method.  \n(iv) The protection buyer needs to adhere to all the criteria required for transferring the \nexposures fully to the protection seller in terms of paragraph (i) above on an on -going \nbasis so as to qualify for ex posure relief on the underlying asset. In case any of these \ncriteria are not met subsequently, the bank will have to reckon the exposure on the \nunderlying asset. Therefore, banks should restrict the total exposure to an obligor \nincluding that covered by wa y of various unfunded credit protections (guarantees, \n                                                            \n199 As per extant instructions issued by RBI, banks are not permitted to guarantee the repayment of pr incipal and/or \ninterest due on corporate bonds. Considering this restriction, writing credit protection through CDS on a corporate \nbond on the date of its issuance or undertaking, before or at the time of issuance, to write such protection in future, \nwill be deemed to be a violation of the said instructions.  231 \n LCs, standby LCs, CDS, etc.) within an internal exposure ceiling considered \nappropriate by the Board of the bank in such a way that it does not breach the single \n/ group borrower exposure limit prescrib ed by RBI. In case of the event of any breach \nin the single / group borrower exposure limit, the entire exposure in excess of the limit \nwill be risk weighted at 1250%. In order to ensure that consequent upon such a \ntreatment, the bank does not breach the m inimum capital requirement prescribed by \nRBI, it should keep sufficient cushion in capital in case it assumes exposures in \nexcess of normal exposure limit.  \n(v) In respect of bought CDS positions held in Trading Book which are not meant for \nhedging, the pr otection buyer will not reckon any exposure against the reference \nentity200.  \n12. Reporting Requirements  \nBanks should report \u201ctotal exposure\u201d in all cases where they have assumed exposures against \nborrowers in excess of the normal single / group exposure li mits due to the credit protections \nobtained by them through CDS, guarantees or any other instruments of credit risk transfer, to the \nDepartment of Supervision (D OS) on a quarterly basis.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n200 In a CDS transaction, the protection buyer does not suffer a loss when reference entity defaults; it rather gains in \nsuch a situation.  232 \n Annex 8  \n(Cf. para 7.3.6)  \nPart \u2013 A \nIllustrations on Cr edit Risk Mitigation (Loan - Exposures)  \nCalculation of Exposure amount for collateralised transactions  \n \nE * = Max { 0, [ E x (1 + H e ) \u2013 C x ( 1 \u2013 Hc \u2013 HFX ) ] } \nWhere,  \nE* = Exposure value after risk mitigation  \nE = Current value of the exposure  \nHe = Hairc ut appropriate to the exposure  \nC = Current value of the collateral received  \nHc = Haircut appropriate to the collateral  \nHFX = Haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the collateral and exposure  \nSl.

Interest Rate Derivativ es  \nThe measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and off -balance -sheet \ninstruments in the trading book, which react to changes in interest rates, (e.g. , forward rate \nagreements (FRAs), other forward contracts, bond futures, interest rate and cross -currency \nswaps and forward foreign exchange positions). Options can be treated in a variety of ways as \ndescribed in para B.1 below. A summary of the rules for dealing with interest rate derivatives is \nset out in the Table at the end of this section.   \n1. Calculation of positions  \nThe derivatives should be converted into positions in the relevant underlying and be subjected to \nspecific and general market risk charges as described in the guidelines. In order to calculate the \ncapital charge, the amo unts reported should be the market value of the principal amount of the \nunderlying or of the notional underlying. For instruments where the apparent notional amount \ndiffers from the effective notional amount, banks must use the effective notional amount .  \n(a) Futures and Forward Contracts, including Forward Rate Agreements  \nThese instruments are treated as a combination of a long and a short position in a notional \ngovernment security. The maturity of a future or a FRA will be the period until delivery or exerci se \nof the contract, plus - where applicable - the life of the underlying instrument. For example, a long \nposition in a June three -month interest rate future (taken in April) is to be reported as a long \nposition in a government security with a maturity of f ive months and a short position in a \ngovernment security with a maturity of two months . Where a range of deliverable instruments may \nbe delivered to fulfill the contract, the bank has flexibility to elect which deliverable security goes \ninto the duration l adder but should take account of any conversion factor defined by the exchange .  \n(b) Swaps  \nSwaps will be treated as two notional positions in government securities with relevant maturities. \nFor example, an interest rate swap under which a bank is receiving fl oating rate interest and \npaying fixed will be treated as a long position in a floating rate instrument of maturity equivalent \nto the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a fixed -rate instrument of maturity \nequivalent to the residua l life of the swap . For swaps that pay or receive a fixed or floating interest \nrate against some other reference price, e.g. , a stock index, the interest rate component should \nbe slotted into the appropriate repricing maturity category, with the equity com ponent being \nincluded in the equity framework.  238 \n Separate legs of cross -currency swaps are to be reported in the relevant maturity ladders for the \ncurrencies concerned.   \n2. Calculation of capital charges for derivatives under the Standardised Methodology  \n(a) Allowable offsetting of Matched Positions  \nBanks may exclude the following from the interest rate maturity framework altogether (for both \nspecific and general market risk);   \n\uf0b7 Long and short positions (both actual and notional) in identical instruments wit h exactly \nthe same issuer, coupon, currency and maturity.  \n\uf0b7 A matched position in a future or forward and its corresponding underlying may also be \nfully offset, (the leg representing the time to expiry of the future should however be \nreported) and thus excl uded from the calculation.  \nWhen the future or the forward comprises a range of deliverable instruments, offsetting of \npositions in the future or forward contract and its underlying is only permissible in cases where \nthere is a readily identifiable underly ing security which is most profitable for the trader with a short \nposition to deliver. The price of this security, sometimes called the \"cheapest -to-deliver\", and the \nprice of the future or forward contract should in such cases move in close alignment.  \nNo offsetting will be allowed between positions in different currencies; the separate legs of cross -\ncurrency swaps or forward foreign exchange deals are to be treated as notional positions in the \nrelevant instruments and included in the appropriate calculatio n for each currency.  \nIn addition, opposite positions in the same category of instruments can in certain circumstances \nbe regarded as matched and allowed to offset fully. To qualify for this treatment the positions must \nrelate to the same underlying instrum ents, be of the same nominal value and be denominated in \nthe same currency. In addition:   \n\uf0b7 for Futures : offsetting positions in the notional or underlying instruments to which the \nfutures contract relates must be for identical products and mature within sev en days of \neach other;  \n\uf0b7 for Swaps and FRAs : the reference rate (for floating rate positions) must be identical and \nthe coupon closely matched (i.e. within 15 basis points); and  \n\uf0b7 for Swaps, FRAs and Forwards : the next interest fixing date or, for fixed coup on positions \nor forwards, the residual maturity must correspond within the following limits:  \no less than one month hence: same day;  \no between one month and one year hence: within seven days;  \no over one year hence: within thirty days.  \nBanks with large swap bo oks may use alternative formulae for these swaps to calculate the \npositions to be included in the duration ladder. The method would be to calculate the sensitivity \nof the net present value implied by the change in yield used in the duration method and allo cate 239 \n these sensitivities into the time -bands set out in Table 15 in paragraph 8.3.9 of this Master \nCircular .  \n(b) Specific Risk  \nInterest rate and currency swaps, FRAs, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate \nfutures will not be subject to a speci fic risk charge. This exemption also applies to futures on an \ninterest rate index (e.g. , LIBOR). However, in the case of futures contracts where the underlying \nis a debt security, or an index representing a basket of debt securities, a specific risk charge  will \napply according to the credit risk of the issuer as set out in paragraphs above .  \n(c) General Market Risk  \nGeneral market risk applies to positions in all derivative products in the same manner as for cash \npositions, subject only to an exemption for full y or very closely matched positions in identical \ninstruments as defined in paragraphs above. The various categories of instruments should be \nslotted into the maturity ladder and treated according to the rules identified earlier . \nTable A - Summary of Treatm ent of Interest Rate Derivatives  \nInstrument  Specific risk \ncharge  General Market risk charge  \nExchange -traded Future  \n- Government debt security  \n- Corporate debt security  \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. , MIBOR)   \nNo \nYes \nNo  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as tw o positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nOTC Forward  \n- Government debt security  \n- Corporate debt security  \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. , MIBOR)   \nNo \nYes \nNo  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nFRAs, Swaps  No Yes, as two positio ns \nForward Foreign Exchange  No Yes, as one position in each \ncurrency  \nOptions  \n- Government debt security  \n- Corporate debt security  \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. , MIBOR)  \n- FRAs, Swaps   \nNo \nYes \nNo \nNo  \n \nB. Treatment of Options  \n1. In recognition of the wide diversity of banks\u2019 activities in options and the difficulties of \nmeasuring price risk for options, alternative approaches are permissible as under:  240 \n \u2022 those banks which solely use purchased options201 shall be free to use the simplified \napproach described  in Section I below;  \n\u2022 those banks which also write options shall be expected to use one of the intermediate \napproaches as set out in Section II below.  \n2. In the simplified approach , the positions for the options and the associated underlying, \ncash or forwar d, are not subject to the standardised methodology but rather are \"carved -out\" and \nsubject to separately calculated capital charges that incorporate both general market risk and \nspecific risk. The risk numbers thus generated are then added to the capital c harges for the \nrelevant category, i.e. , interest rate related instruments, equities, and foreign exchange as \ndescribed in paragraph 8.3 to 8.5 of this Master Circular . The delta -plus method uses the \nsensitivity parameters or \"Greek letters\" associated with  options to measure their market risk and \ncapital requirements. Under this method, the delta -equivalent position of each option becomes \npart of the standardised methodology set out in paragraph 8.3 to 8.5 of this Master Circular with \nthe delta -equivalent a mount subject to the applicable general market risk charges. Separate \ncapital charges are then applied to the gamma and Vega risks of the option positions. The \nscenario approach  uses simulation techniques to calculate changes in the value of an options \nportfolio for changes in the level and volatility of its associated underlyings. Under this approach, \nthe general market risk charge is determined by the scenario \"grid\" (i.e. , the specified combination \nof underlying and volatility changes) that produces the largest loss. For the delta -plus method and \nthe scenario approach the specific risk capital charges are determined separately by multiplying \nthe delta -equivalent of each option by the specific risk weights set out in paragraph 8.3 to 8.4 of \nthis Master Cir cular .  \nI. Simplified Approach  \n3. Banks which handle a limited range of purchased options only will be free to use the \nsimplified approach set out in Table B below, for particular trades. As an example of how the \ncalculation would work, if a holder of 100  shares currently valued at Rs.10 each holds an \nequivalent put option with a strike price of Rs.11, the capital charge would be: Rs.1,000 x 18 per \ncent (i.e. , 9 per cent specific plus 9 per cent general market risk) = Rs.180, less the amount the \noption is in the money (Rs.11 \u2013 Rs.10) x 100 = Rs.100, i.e. , the capital charge would be Rs.80. A \nsimilar methodology applies for options whose underlying is a foreign currency or an interest rate \nrelated instrument.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n201 Unless all their written option positions are hedged by perfect ly matched long positions in exactly the same \noptions, in which case no capital charge for market risk is required.  241 \n Table B - Simplified approach : capital charg es \nCapital charges  Position  Treatment  \nLong cash and Long put  \nOr \nShort cash and Long call  The capital charge will be the market value of the \nunderlying security202 multiplied by the sum of \nspecific and general market risk charges203 for the \nunderlying less the  amount the option is in the \nmoney (if any) bounded at zero  204. \n \nLong call  \nOr \nLong put  The capital charge will be the lesser of:  \n(i) the market value of the underlying security \nmultiplied by the sum of specific and general market \nrisk charges 204 for the u nderlying  \n(ii) the market value of the option205 \nII. Intermediate Approaches  \n(a) Delta -plus Method  \n4. Banks which write options will be allowed to include delta -weighted options positions \nwithin the standardised methodology set out in paragraph 8.3 to 8. 5 of this Master Circular. Such \noptions should be reported as a position equal to the market value of the underlying multiplied by \nthe delta.  \nHowever, since delta does not sufficiently cover the risks associated with options positions, banks \nwill also be r equired to measure gamma (which measures the rate of change of delta) and Vega \n(which measures the sensitivity of the value of an option with respect to a change in volatility) \nsensitivities in order to calculate the total capital charge. These sensitiviti es will be calculated \naccording to an approved exchange model or to the bank\u2019s proprietary options pricing model \nsubject to oversight by the Reserve Bank of India 206.  \n5. Delta -weighted positions with debt securities or interest rates as the underlying  will be \nslotted into the interest rate time -bands, as set out in Table 15 of paragraph 8.3 of this Master \n                                                            \n202 In some cases, such as foreign exchange, it may be unclear which side is the \"underlying security\"; this should be \ntaken to be the asset w hich would be received if the option were exercised. In addition, the nominal value should \nbe used for items where the market value of the underlying instrument could be zero, e.g., caps and floors, swaptions \netc. \n203 Some options (e.g., where the underlying  is an interest rate or a currency) bear no specific risk, but specific risk \nshall be present in the case of options on certain interest rate -related instruments (e.g., options on a corporate debt \nsecurity or corporate bond index; see Section B for the rel evant capital charges) and for options on equities and \nstock indices (see Section C). The charge under this measure for currency options will be 9 per cent.  \n204 For options with a residual maturity of more than six months, the strike price should be compared  with the \nforward, not current, price. A bank unable to do this must take the \"in -the-money\" amount to be zero.  \n205 Where the position does not fall within the trading book (i.e., options on certain foreign exchange or commodities \npositions not belonging to the trading book), it may be acceptable to use the book value instead.  \n206 Reserve Bank of India may wish to require banks doing business in certain classes of exotic options (e.g., barriers, \ndigitals) or in options \"at -the-money\" that are close to expiry to  use either the scenario approach or the internal \nmodels\u2019 alternative, both of which can accommodate more detailed revaluation approaches.  242 \n Circular , under the following procedure. A two -legged approach should be used as for other \nderivatives, requiring one entry at the time the underlying con tract takes effect and a second at \nthe time the underlying contract matures. For instance, a bought call option on a June three -month \ninterest -rate future will in April be considered, on the basis of its delta -equivalent value, to be a \nlong position with a  maturity of five months and a short position with a maturity of two months  207. \nThe written option will be similarly slotted as a long position with a maturity of two months and a \nshort position with a maturity of five months. Floating rate instruments with  caps or floors will be \ntreated as a combination of floating rate securities and a series of European -style options. For \nexample, the holder of a three -year floating rate bond indexed to six month LIBOR with a cap of \n15 per cent will treat it as:   \n(i) a debt security that reprices in six months; and  \n(ii) a series of five written call options on a FRA with a reference rate of 15 per cent, each \nwith a negative sign at the time the underlying FRA takes effect and a positive sign at \nthe time the underlying FRA  matures208.  \n6. The capital charge for options with equities as the underlying  will also be based on the \ndelta -weighted positions which will be incorporated in the measure of market risk described in \nparagraph 8.4 of this Master Circular . For purposes of th is calculation each national market is to \nbe treated as a separate underlying. The capital charge for options on foreign exchange and gold \npositions will be based on the method set out in paragraph 8.5 of this Master Circular . For delta \nrisk, the net delta -based equivalent of the foreign currency and gold options will be incorporated \ninto the measurement of the exposure for the respective currency (or gold) position .  \n7. In addition to the above capital charges arising from delta risk, there will be further  capital \ncharges for gamma and for Vega risk. Banks using the delta -plus method will be required to \ncalculate the gamma and Vega for each option position (including hedge positions) separately. \nThe capital charges should be calculated in the following way:   \n(i) for each individual option a \"gamma impact\" sh ould be calculated according to a Taylor \nseries expansion as:  \nGamma impact = \u00bd x Gamma x VU\u00b2  \nwhere VU = Variation of the underlying of the option.  \n \n \n                                                            \n207 Two -months call option on a bond future, where delivery of the bond takes place in September, would be \nconsidered i n April as being long the bond and short a five -month deposit, both positions being delta -weighted.  \n208 The rules applying to closely -matched positions set out in paragraph 2 (a) of this Annex shall also apply in this \nrespect.  243 \n (ii) VU will be calculated as follows :  \n\uf0b7 for interest  rate options if the underlying is a bond, the price sensitivity should be worked \nout as explained. An equivalent calculation should be carried out where the underlying \nis an interest rate .  \n\uf0b7 for options on equities and equity indices; which are not permitt ed at present, the \nmarket value of the underlying should be multiplied by 9 per cent209;  \n\uf0b7 for foreign exchange and gold options: the market value of the underlying should be \nmultiplied by 9 per cent ;  \n(iii) For the purpose of this calculation the following p ositions sh ould be treated as the same \nunderlyin g:  \n\uf0b7 for interest rates210, each time -band as set out in Table 15 of this Master Circular211;  \n\uf0b7 for equities and stock indices, each national market;  \n\uf0b7 for foreign currencies and gold, each currency pair and gold;  \n(iv) Each option on the same underlying will have a gamma impact that is either positive or \nnegative. These individual gamma impacts will be summed, resulting in a net gamma impact \nfor each underlying that is either positive or negative. Only those net gam ma impacts that \nare negative will be included in the capital calculation .  \n(v) The total gamma capital charge will be the sum of the absolute value of the net negative \ngamma impacts as calculated above .  \n(vi) For volatility risk , banks will be required to calculate the capital charges by multiplying the \nsum of the Vegas for all options on the same underlying, as defined above, by a proportional \nshift in volatility of \u00b1 25 per cent.  \n(vii) The total capital charge  for Vega risk will be the sum of the absolute  value of the individual \ncapital charges that have been calculated for Vega risk.   \n(b) Scenario Approach  \n8. More sophisticated banks will also have the right to base the market risk capital charge \nfor options portfolios and associated hedging positions on scenario matrix analysis . This will be \naccomplished by specifying a fixed range of changes in the option portfolio\u2019s risk factors and \ncalculating changes in the value of the option portfolio at various points along this \"grid\". For the \npurpose of calculati ng the capital charge, the bank will revalue the option portfolio using matrices \nfor simultaneous changes in the option\u2019s underlying rate or price and in the volatility of that rate \n                                                            \n209 The basic rules set out here for interest rate and equity options do not attempt to capture specific risk when \ncalculating gamma capital charges. However, Reserve Bank may require specific banks to do so.  \n210 Positions have to be slotted into separate maturity ladders by currency.  \n211 Banks using the duration method should use the time -bands as set out in Table 16 of this Master Circular.  244 \n or price. A different matrix will be set up for each individual underlying  as defined in paragraph 7 \nabove. As an alternative, at the discretion of each national authority, banks which are significant \ntraders in options for interest rate options will be permitted to base the calculation on a minimum \nof six sets of time -bands. Wh en using this method, not more than three of the time -bands as \ndefined in paragraph 8.3 of this Master Circular should be combined into any one set .  \n9. The options and related hedging positions will be evaluated over a specified range above \nand below the current value of the underlying. The range for interest rates is consistent with the \nassumed changes in yield in Table -15 of paragraph 8.3 of this Master Circular. Those banks using \nthe alternative method for interest rate options set out in paragraph 8 ab ove should use, for each \nset of time -bands, the highest of the assumed changes in yield applicable to the group to which \nthe time -bands belong  212. The other ranges are \u00b19 per cent for equities and \u00b19 per cent for foreign \nexchange and gold. For all risk cate gories, at least seven observations (including the current \nobservation) should be used to divide the range into equally spaced intervals.   \n10. The second dimension of the matrix entails a change in the volatility of the underlying rate \nor price. A single c hange in the volatility of the underlying rate or price equal to a shift in volatility \nof + 25 per cent and - 25 per cent is expected to be sufficient in most cases. As circumstances \nwarrant, however, the Reserve Bank may choose to require that a different  change in volatility be \nused and / or that intermediate points on the grid be calculated .  \n11. After calculating the matrix, each cell contains the net profit or loss of the option and the \nunderlying hedge instrument. The capital charge for each underlyin g will then be calculated as \nthe largest loss contained in the matrix.  \n12. In drawing up these intermediate approaches it has been sought to cover the major risks \nassociated with options. In doing so, it is conscious that so far as specific risk is concern ed, only \nthe delta -related elements are captured; to capture other risks would necessitate a much more \ncomplex regime. On the other hand, in other areas the simplifying assumptions used have \nresulted in a relatively conservative treatment of certain option s positions.  \n13. Besides the options risks mentioned above, the RBI is conscious of the other risks also \nassociated with options, e.g. , rho (rate of change of the value of the option with respect to the \ninterest rate) and theta (rate of change of the value  of the option with respect to time). While not \nproposing a measurement system for those risks at present, it expects banks undertaking \nsignificant options business at the very least to monitor such risks closely. Additionally, banks will \nbe permitted to i ncorporate rho into their capital calculations for interest rate risk, if they wish to \ndo so.  \n \n                                                            \n212 If, for example, the time -bands 3 to 4 years, 4 to 5 years and 5 to 7 years are combined, the highest assumed \nchange in yield of these three bands woul d be 0.75.  245 \n Annex 10  \n(cf. para 13.5)  \nAn Illustrative Approach for Measurement of  \nInterest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) under Pillar 2  \n \nThe Basel -II Framework213 (Para graphs 739 and 762 to 764) require the banks to measure the \ninterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) and hold capital commensurate with it. If supervisors \ndetermine that banks are not holding capital commensurate with the level of interest rate risk,  they \nmust require the bank to reduce its risk, to hold a specific additional amount of capital or some \ncombination of the two. To comply with the requirements of Pillar 2 relating to IRRBB, the \nguidelines on Pillar 2 issued by many regulators contain defi nite provisions indicating the \napproach adopted by the supervisors to assess the level of interest rate risk in the banking book \nand the action to be taken in case the level of interest rate risk found is significant.  \nIn terms of para 764 of the Basel II framework, the banks can follow the indicative methodology \nprescribed in the supporting document \"Principles for the Management and Supervision of \nInterest Rate Risk\" issued by BCBS for assessment of sufficiency of capital for IRRBB.  \n2.  The approach presc ribed in the BCBS Paper on \u201c Principles for the Management and \nSupervision of Interest Rate Risk \"  \nThe main components of the approach prescribed in the above mentioned supporting document \nare as under:  \na) The assessment should take into account both the e arnings perspective and economic \nvalue perspective of interest rate risk.  \nb) The impact on income or the economic value of equity should be calculated by applying a \nnotional interest rate shock of 200 basis points.  \nc)  The usual methods followed in measu ring the interest rate risk are:  \na) Earnings perspective  \nGap Analysis, simulation techniques and Internal Models based on VaR  \nb) Economic perspective  \nGap analysis combined with duration gap analysis, simulation techniques and \nInternal Models based on Va R  \n \n \n                                                            \n213 International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (June 2006) released by the Basel \nCommittee on Banking Supervision.  246 \n 3. Methods for measurement of the IRRBB   \n3.1 Impact on Earnings   \nThe major methods used for computing the impact on earnings are the gap Analysis, Simulations \nand VaR based Techniques. Banks in India have been using the Gap Reports to assess the \nimpac t of adverse movements in the interest rate on income through gap method. The banks may \ncontinue with the same. However, the banks may use the simulations also. The banks may \ncalculate the impact on the earnings by gap analysis or any other method with the  assumed \nchange in yield on 200 bps over one year. However, no capital needs to be allocated for the \nimpact on the earnings.  \n3.2 Impact of IRRBB on the Market Value of Equity (MVE)  \nThe banks may use the Method indicated in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) \nPaper \"Principles for the Management and Supervision of Interest rate Risk\" (July 2004) for \ncomputing the impact of the interest rate shock on the MVE.  \n3.2.1  Method indicated in the BCBS Paper on \"Principles for the Management and Super vision \nof Interest Rate Risk\"  \nThe following steps are involved in this approach:  \na) The variables such as maturity/re -pricing date, coupon rate, frequency, principal \namount for each item of asset/liability (for each category of asset / liability) are \ngenerated.  \nb) The longs and shorts in each time band are offset.  \nc) The resulting short and long positions are weighted by a factor that is designed to \nreflect the sensitivity of the positions in the different time bands to an assumed change \nin interest rat es. These factors are based on an assumed parallel shift of 200 basis \npoints throughout the time spectrum, and on a proxy of modified duration of positions \nsituated at the middle of each time band and yielding 5 per cent.  \nd) The resulting weighted positio ns are summed up, offsetting longs and shorts, leading \nto the net short - or long -weighted position.  \ne) The weighted position is seen in relation to capital.  \nFor details banks may refer to the Annex 3  and 4 of captioned paper issued by the BCBS214.  \n \n \n                                                            \n214 Principles for the Management and Supervision of Interest Rate Risk (July 2004).  247 \n 3.2.2  Other techniques for Interest rate risk measurement   \nThe banks can also follow different versions / variations of the above techniques or entirely \ndifferent techniques to measure the IRRBB if they find them conceptually sound. In this context, \nAnnex 1  and 2 of the BCBS paper referred to above provide broad details of interest rate risk \nmeasurement techniques and overview of some of the factors which the supervisory authorities \nmight consider in obtaining and analysing the information on individual bank\u2019s e xposures to \ninterest rate risk.  \n4. Suggested approach for measuring the impact of IRRBB on capital  \n4.1 As per Basel II Framework, if the supervisor feels that the bank is not holding capital \ncommensurate with the level of IRRBB, it may either require the bank to reduce the risk or allocate \nadditional capital or a combination of the two.  \n4.2 The banks can decide, with the approval of the Board, on the appropriate level of interest \nrate risk in the banking book which they would like to carry keeping in view  their capital level, \ninterest rate management skills and the ability to re -balance the banking book portfolios quickly \nin case of adverse movement in the interest rates. In any case, a level of interest rate risk which \ngenerates a drop in the MVE of more than 20 per cent with an interest rate shock of 200 basis \npoints, will be treated as excessive and such banks would normally be required by the RBI to hold \nadditional capital against IRRBB as determined during the SREP. The banks which have IRRBB \nexposure equivalent to less than 20 per cent drop in the MVE may also be required to hold \nadditional capital if the level of interest rate risk is considered, by the RBI, to be high in relation to \ntheir capital level or the quality of interest rate risk management framework obtaining in the bank. \nWhile the banks may on their own decide to hold additional capital towards IRRBB keeping in \nview the potential drop in their MVE, the IRR management skills and the ability to re -balance the \nportfolios quickly in case of adv erse movement in the interest rates, the amount of exact capital \nadd-on, if considered necessary, will be decided by the RBI as part of the SREP, in consultation \nwith the bank.  \n5. Limit setting   \nThe banks would be well advised to consider setting the inte rnal limits for controlling their IRRBB. \nThe following are some of the indicative ways for setting the limits:  \na) Internal limits could be fixed in terms of the maximum decline in earnings (as a \npercentage of the base -scenario income) or decline in capita l (as a percentage of the \nbase -scenario capital position) as a result of 200 or 300 basis point interest -rate \nshock.  \nb) The limits could also be placed in terms of PV01 value (present value of a basis point) \nof the net position of the bank as a percentage  of net worth/capital of the bank.  248 \n  \nAnnex 11  \n(cf para 4.4.9.2)  \nInvestments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities which are \nOutside the Scope of Regulatory Consolidation  \n \nPART A: Details of Regulatory Capital Structure of a Bank  \n(Rs. crore)  \nPaid-up equity capital  300 \nEligible Reserve and Surplus  100 \nTotal common equity  400 \nEligible Additional Tier 1 capital  15 \nTotal Tier 1 capital  415 \nEligible Tier 2 capital  135 \nTotal Eligible capital  550 \n \nPART B: Details of Capital Structure an d Bank's Investments in Unconsolidated Entities  \nEntity  Total Capital of the Investee entities  Investments of bank in these entities  \n Common  \nequity  Additional  \nTier 1  Tier \n2 Total  \ncapital  Common  \nEquity  Additional  \nTier 1  Tier \n2 Total  \ninvestment  \nInvestments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities which are outside the \nscope of regulatory consolidation and where the bank does not own more than 10% of the \nissued common share capital of the entity  \nA 250 0 80 330 12 0 15 27 \nB 300 10 0 310 14 10 0 24 \nTotal  550 10 80 640 26 10 15 51 \nSignificant investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities which are \noutside the scope of regulatory consolidation  \nC 150 20 10 180 20 10 0 30 \nD 200 10 5 215 25 5 5 35 \nTotal  350 30 15 395 45 15 5 65  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 249 \n  \nPART C: Regulatory Adjustments on Account of Investments  \nin Entities where Bank Does not own more than 10%  \nof the Issued Common Share Capital of the Entity  \n \nC-1: Bifurcation of Investments of bank into Trading and Banking Book  \n \n Common  \nEquity  Additional  \nTier 1  Tier \n2 Total  \ninvestments  \nTotal investments in A & B held in Banking Book  11 6 10 27 \nTotal investments in A & B held in Trading Book  15 4 5 24 \nTotal of Banking and Trading Book Investments in A & B  26 10 15 51 \nC-2: Regulato ry adjustments  \nBank's aggregate investment in Common Equity of A & B  26 \nBank's aggregate investment in Additional Tier 1 capital of A & B  10 \nBank's aggregate investment in Tier 2 capital of A & B  15 \nTotal of bank's investment in A and B  51 \nBank common  equity  400 \n10% of bank's common equity  40 \nBank's total holdings in capital instruments of A & B in excess of 10%  \nof banks common equity (51 -40) 11 \nNote: Investments in both A and B will qualify for this treatment as individually, both of them are less than \n10% of share capital of respective entity.

What is an ICAAP document?  \nThe ICAAP Document would be a comprehensive Paper furnishing detailed information on the \nongoing assessment of the bank\u2019s entire spectrum of risks, how the bank intend s to mitigate those \nrisks and how much current and future capital is necessary for the bank, reckoning other mitigating \nfactors. The purpose of the ICAAP document is to apprise the Board of the bank on these aspects \nas also to explain to the RBI the bank\u2019s  internal capital adequacy assessment process and the \nbanks\u2019 approach to capital management. The ICAAP could also be based on the existing internal \ndocumentation of the bank.  \nThe ICAAP document submitted to the RBI should be formally approved by the bank\u2019s  Board. It \nis expected that the document would be prepared in a format that would be easily understood at \nthe senior levels of management and would contain all the relevant information necessary for the \nbank and the RBI to make an informed judgment as to t he appropriate capital level of the bank \nand its risk management approach. Where appropriate, technical information on risk \nmeasurement methodologies, capital models, if any, used and all other work carried out to \nvalidate the approach (e.g. , board papers and minutes, internal or external reviews) could be \nfurnished to the RBI as appendices to the ICAAP Document.   \n2. Contents  \nThe ICAAP Document should contain the following sections:  \nI. Executive Summary  \nII. Background  \nIII. Summary of current and projected financial  and capital positions  \nIV. Capital Adequacy  \nV. Key sensitivities and future scenarios  \nVI. Aggregation and diversification  \nVII. Testing and adoption of the ICAAP  \nVIII. Use of the ICAAP within the bank  \nI. Executive Summary  \nThe purpose of the Executive Summary is to present  an overview of the ICAAP methodology and \nresults. This overview would typically include:  \na) the purpose of the report and the regulated entities within a banking group that are \ncovered by the ICAAP;  \nb) the main findings of the ICAAP analysis:  256 \n i how muc h and what composition of internal capital the bank considers it should hold \nas compared with the minimum CRAR requirement (CRAR) under \u2018Pillar 1\u2019 calculation, \nand  \nii the adequacy of the bank\u2019s risk management processes;  \nc) a summary of the financial pos ition of the bank, including the strategic position of the \nbank, its balance sheet strength, and future profitability;  \nd) brief descriptions of the capital raising and dividend plan including how the bank intends \nto manage its capital in the days ahead and  for what purposes;  \ne) commentary on the most material risks to which the bank is exposed, why the level of \nrisk is considered acceptable or, if it is not, what mitigating actions are planned;  \nf) commentary on major issues where further analysis and deci sions are required; and  \ng) who has carried out the assessment, how it has been challenged / validated / stress \ntested, and who has approved it.  \nII. Background  \nThis section would cover the relevant organisational and historical financial data for the ban k. \ne.g., group structure (legal and operational), operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, \ndividends, shareholders\u2019 funds, capital funds held vis -\u00e0-vis the regulatory requirements, customer \ndeposits, deposits by banks, total assets, and any c onclusions that can be drawn from trends in \nthe data which may have implications for the bank\u2019s future.  \nIII. Summary of current and projected financial and capital positions  \nThis section would explain the present financial position of the bank and expect ed changes to the \ncurrent business profile, the environment in which it expects to operate, its projected business \nplans (by appropriate lines of business), projected financial position, and future planned sources \nof capital.  \nThe starting balance sheet us ed as reference and date as of which the assessment is carried out \nshould be indicated.  \nThe projected financial position could reckon both the projected capital available and projected \ncapital requirements based on envisaged business plans. These might th en provide a basis \nagainst which adverse scenarios might be compared.  \nIV. Capital Adequacy   \nThis section might start with a description of the bank\u2019s risk appetite, in quantitative terms, as \napproved by the bank\u2019s Board and used in the ICAAP. It would be necessary to clearly spell out \nin the document whether what is being presented represents the bank\u2019s view of the amount of 257 \n capital required to meet minimum regulatory needs or  whether represents the amount of capital \nthat a bank believes it would need to meet its business plans . For instance, it should be clearly \nbrought out whether the capital required is based on a particular credit rating desired by the bank \nor includes buffers for strategic purposes or seeks to minimise the chance of breaching regulator y \nrequirements. Where economic capital models are used for internal capital assessment, the \nconfidence level, time horizon, and description of the event to which the confidence level relates, \nshould also be enumerated. Where scenario analyses or other mean s are used for capital \nassessment, then the basis / rationale for selecting the chosen severity of scenarios used, should \nalso be included.  \nThe section would then include a detailed review of the capital adequacy of the bank.  \nThe information provided woul d include the following elements:  \nTiming  \n\uf0b7 the effective date of the ICAAP calculations together with details of any events between \nthis date and the date of submission to the Board / RBI which would materially impact the \nICAAP calculations together with t heir effects; and  \n\uf0b7 details of, and rationale for, the time period selected for which capital requirement has \nbeen assessed.  \nRisks Analysed  \n\uf0b7 an identification of the major risks faced by the bank in each of the following categories:  \na) credit risk  \nb) market ri sk  \nc) operational risk  \nd) liquidity risk  \ne) concentration risk  \nf) interest rate risk in the banking book  \ng) residual risk of securitisation  \nh) strategic risk  \ni) business risk  \nj) reputation risk  \nk) group risk   \nl) pension obligation risk  \nm) other residual risk; and  \nn) any other risks  that might have been identified  \n\uf0b7 for each of these risks, an explanation of how the risk has been assessed and to the extent \npossible, the quantitative results  of that assessment;  258 \n \uf0b7 where some of these risks have been highlighted in the report of the RBI\u2019s  on-site \ninspection of the bank, an explanation of how the bank has mitigated these;  \n\uf0b7 where relevant, a comparison of the RBI -assessed CRAR during on -site inspection with \nthe results of the CRAR calculations of the bank under the ICAAP;  \n\uf0b7 a clear articulati on of the bank\u2019s risk appetite, in quantitative terms, by risk category and \nthe extent of its consistency (its \u2018fit\u2019) with the overall assessment of bank\u2019s various risks; \nand  \n\uf0b7 where relevant, an explanation of any other methods, apart from capital, used by  the bank \nto mitigate the risks.  \nMethodology and Assumptions  \nA description of how assessments for each of the major risks have been approached and the \nmain assumptions made.  \nFor instance, banks may choose to base their ICAAP on the results of the CRAR c alculation with \nthe capital for additional risks (e.g. , concentration risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, etc.) \nassessed separately and added to the Pillar 1 computations. Alternatively, banks could choose \nto base their ICAAP on internal models f or all risks, including those covered under the CRAR (i.e. , \nCredit, Market and Operational Risks).  \nThe description here would make clear which risks are covered by which modelling or calculation \napproach. This would include details of the methodology and process used to calculate risks in \neach of the categories identified and reason for choosing the method used in each case.  \nWhere the bank uses an internal model for the quantification of its risks, this section should explain \nfor each of those models:  \n\uf0b7 the key assumptions and parameters within the capital modelling work and background \ninformation on the derivation of any key assumptions;  \n\uf0b7 how parameters have been chosen, including the historical period used and the calibration \nprocess;  \n\uf0b7 the limitations of the model;  \n\uf0b7 the sensitivity of the model to changes in those key assumptions or parameters chosen; \nand  \n\uf0b7 the validation work undertaken to ensure the continuing adequacy of the model.  \nWhere stress tests or scenario analyses have been used to validate, supp lement, or probe the \nresults of other modelling approaches, then this section should provide:  \n\uf0b7 details of simulations to capture risks not well estimated by the bank\u2019s internal capital \nmodel (e.g. , non-linear products, concentrations, illiquidity and shift s in correlations in a \ncrisis period);  259 \n \uf0b7 details of the quantitative results of stress tests and scenario analyses the bank carried \nout and the confidence levels and key assumptions behind those analyses, including, the \ndistribution of outcomes obtained for  the main individual risk factors;  \n\uf0b7 details of the range of combined adverse scenarios which have been applied, how these \nwere derived and the resulting capital requirements; and  \n\uf0b7 where applicable, details of any additional business -unit-specific or busine ss-plan-specific \nstress tests selected.  \nCapital Transferability  \nIn case of banks with conglomerate structure, details of any restrictions on the management\u2019s \nability to transfer capital into or out of the banking business(es) arising from, for example, b y \ncontractual, commercial, regulatory or statutory constraints that apply, should be furnished. Any \nrestrictions applicable and flexibilities available for distribution of dividend by the entities in the \nGroup could also be enumerated. In case of overseas banking subsidiaries of the banks, the \nregulatory restrictions would include the minimum regulatory capital level acceptable to the host -\ncountry regulator of the subsidiary, after declaration of dividend.  \nV. Firm -wide risk oversight and specific aspects of  risk management215  \nV.1 Risk Management System in the bank   \nThis section would describe the risk management infrastructure within the bank along the \nfollowing lines:  \n\uf0b7 The oversight of board and senior management  \n\uf0b7 Policies, Procedures and Limits  \n\uf0b7 identificat ion, measurement, mitigation, controlling and reporting of risks  \n\uf0b7 MIS at the firm wide level  \n\uf0b7 Internal controls  \nV.2 Off-balance Sheet Exposures with a focus on Securitisation  \nThis section would comprehensively discuss and analyse underlying risks inheren t in the off -\nbalance sheet exposures particularly its investment in structured products. When assessing \nsecuritisation exposures, bank should thoroughly analyse the credit quality and risk \ncharacteristics of the underlying exposures. This section should al so comprehensively explain the \nmaturity of the exposures underlying securitisation transactions relative to issued liabilities in \norder to assess potential maturity mismatches.  \n \n                                                            \n215 Master Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.73/21.06.001/2009 -10 dated Feb 8, 2010 . 260 \n V.3 Assessment of Reputational Risk and Implicit Support   \nThis section should  discuss the possibilities of reputational risk leading to provision of implicit \nsupport, which might give rise to credit, market and legal risks. This section should thoroughly \ndiscuss potential sources of reputational risk to the bank.  \nV. 4 Assessment o f valuation and Liquidity Risk   \nThis section would describe the governance structures and control processes for valuing \nexposures for risk management and financial reporting purposes, with a special focus on valuation \nof illiquid positions. This section wi ll have relevant details leading to establishment and verification \nof valuations for instruments and transactions in which it engages.  \nV. 5 Stress Testing practices   \nThis section would explain the role of board and senior management in setting stress test ing \nobjectives, defining scenarios, discussing the results of stress tests, assessing potential actions \nand decision making on the basis of results of stress tests. This section would also describe the \nrigorou s and forward -looking stress testing that ident ifies possib le events or changes in market \nconditions that could adversely the bank. RBI would assess the effectiveness of banks\u2019 stress \ntesting programme in identifying relevant vulnerabilities.  \nV. 6 Sound compensation practices  \nThis section should desc ribe the compensation practices followed by the bank and how far the \ncompensation practices are linked to long -term capital preservation and the financial strength of \nthe firm. The calculation of risk -adjusted performance measure for the employees and its link, if \nany, with the compensation should clearly be disclosed in this section .  \nVI. Key sensitivities and future scenarios   \nThis section would explain how a bank would be affected by an economic recession or \ndownswings in the business cycle or markets re levant to its activities. The RBI would like to be \napprised as to how a bank would manage its business and capital so as to survive a recession \nwhile meeting the minimum regulatory standards. The analysis would include future financial \nprojections for, say , three to five years based on business plans and solvency calculations.  \nFor the purpose of this analysis, the severity of the recession reckoned should typically be one \nthat occurs only once in a 25 year period. The time horizon would be from the day of the ICAAP \ncalculation to at least the deepest part of the recession envisaged.  \nTypical scenarios would include:  \n\uf0b7 how an economic downturn would affect:  \n\uf0a7 the bank\u2019s capital funds and future earnings; and  \n\uf0a7 the bank\u2019s CRAR taking into account future changes in its projected balance sheet.  261 \n \uf0b7 In both cases, it would be helpful if these projections show separately the effects of \nmanagement actions to change the bank\u2019s business strategy and the implementation of \ncontingency plans.  \n\uf0b7 projections of the future CRAR w ould include the effect of changes in the credit quality of \nthe bank\u2019s credit risk counterparties (including migration in their ratings during a recession) \nand the bank\u2019s capital and its credit risk capital requirement;  \n\uf0b7 an assessment by the bank of any ot her capital planning actions to enable it to continue \nto meet its regulatory capital requirements throughout a recession such as new capital \ninjections from related companies or new share issues;  \n\uf0b7 This section would also explain which key macroeconomic fac tors are being stressed, and \nhow those have been identified as drivers of the bank\u2019s earnings. The bank would also \nexplain how the macroeconomic factors affect the key parameters of the internal model \nby demonstrating, for instance, how the relationship be tween the two has been \nestablished.  \nManagement Actions  \nThis section would elaborate on the management actions assumed in deriving the ICAAP, in \nparticular:  \n\uf0b7 the quantitative impact of management actions \u2013 sensitivity testing of key management \nactions and revised ICAAP figures with management actions excluded.  \n\uf0b7 evidence of management actions implemented in the past during similar periods of \neconomic stress.  \nVII. Aggregation and Diversification  \nThis section would describe how the results of the various sep arate risk assessments are brought \ntogether and an overall view taken on capital adequacy. At a technical level, this would, therefore, \nrequire some method to be used to combine the various risks using some appropriate quantitative \ntechniques. At the broad er level, the overall reasonableness of the detailed quantification \napproaches might be compared with the results of an analysis of capital planning and a view \ntaken by senior management as to the overall level of capital that is considered appropriate.  \n\uf0b7 In enumerating the process of technical aggregation, the following aspects could be \ncovered:  \ni. any allowance made for diversification, including any assumed correlations within risks \nand between risks and how such correlations have been assessed, including i n \nstressed conditions;  \nii. the justification for any credit taken for diversification benefits between legal entities, \nand the justification for the free movement of capital, if any assumed, between them \nin times of financial stress;  262 \n iii. the impact of diversific ation benefits with management actions excluded. It might be \nhelpful to work out revised ICAAP figures with all correlations set to \u20181\u2019 i.e., no \ndiversification; and similar figures with all correlations set to \u20180\u2019 i.e. , assuming all risks \nare independent i.e., full diversification.  \n \n\uf0b7 As regards the overall assessment, this should describe how the bank has arrived at its \noverall assessment of the capital it needs taking into account such matters as:  \ni) the inherent uncertainty in any modelling approach;  \nii) weaknesses in the bank\u2019s risk management procedures, systems or controls;  \niii) the differences between regulatory capital and internal capital; and  \niv) the differing purposes that capital serves: shareholder returns, rating objectives for \nthe bank as a whole or for certain debt instruments the bank has issued, avoidance of \nregulatory intervention, protection against uncertain events, depositor protection, \nworking capital, capital held for strategic acquisitions, etc.  \nVIII. Testing and Adoption of the ICAAP  \nThis section would describe the extent of challenging and testing that the ICAAP has been \nsubjected to. It would thus include the testing and control processes applied to the ICAAP models \nand calculations. It should also describe the process of revi ew of the test results by the senior \nmanagement or the Board and the approval of the results by them. A copy of any relevant report \nplaced before the senior management or the Board of the bank in this regard, along with their \nresponse, could be attached to  the ICAAP Document sent to the RBI.  \nDetails of the reliance placed on any external service providers or consultants in the testing \nprocess, for instance, for generating economic scenarios, could also be detailed here.  \nIn addition, a copy of any report o btained from an external reviewer or internal audit should also \nbe sent to the RBI.  \nIX. Use of the ICAAP within the bank  \nThis section would contain information to demonstrate the extent to which the concept of capital \nmanagement is embedded within the ba nk, including the extent and use of capital modelling or \nscenario analyses and stress testing within the bank\u2019s capital management policy. For instance, \nuse of ICAAP in setting pricing and charges and the level and nature of future business, could be \nan in dicator in this regard.  \nThis section could also include a statement of the bank\u2019s actual operating philosophy on capital \nmanagement and how this fits in to the ICAAP Document submitted. For instance, differences in 263 \n risk appetite used in preparing the ICAA P Document vis -\u00e0-vis that used for business decisions \nmight be discussed.  \nLastly, the banks may also furnish the details of any anticipated future refinements envisaged in \nthe ICAAP (highlighting those aspects which are work -in-progress) apart from any ot her \ninformation that the bank believes would be helpful to the RBI in reviewing the ICAAP Document.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 264 \n Annex 16  \n(cf para 4.2)  \nMinimum Requirements to Ensure Loss Absorbency of Additional Tier 1 Instruments  \nat Pre -specified Trigger and o f All Non -equity Regulatory Capital Instruments  \nat the Point of Non -viability216 \n1. INTRODUCTION  \n1.1 As indicated in paragraph 4.2.4 of this Master Circular , under Basel III non -common equity \nelements to be included in Tier 1 capital should absorb losses wh ile the bank remains a going \nconcern. Towards this end, one of the important criteria for Additional Tier 1 instruments is that \nthese instruments should have principal loss absorption through either (i) conversion into common \nshares or (ii) a write -down me chanism, which allocates losses to the instrument at an objective \npre-specified trigger point . \n1.2 During the financial crisis a number of distressed banks were rescued by the public sector \ninjecting funds in the form of common equity and other forms of Ti er 1 capital. While this had the \neffect of supporting depositors it also meant that Tier 2 capital instruments (mainly subordinated \ndebt), and in some cases Tier 1 instruments, did not absorb losses incurred by certain large \ninternationally -active banks th at would have failed had the public sector not provided support. \nTherefore, Basel III requires that the terms and conditions of all non -common Tier 1 and Tier 2 \ncapital instruments issued by a bank must have a provision that requires such instruments, at t he \noption of the relevant authority, to either be written off or converted into common equity upon the \noccurrence of the trigger event.  \n1.3 Therefore, in order for an instrument issued by a bank to be included in Additional (i.e. \nnon-common) Tier 1 or in T ier 2 capital, in addition to criteria for individual types of non -equity \nregulatory capital instruments mentioned in Annex 3 , 4, 5 and 6, it must also meet or exceed \nminimum requirements set out in the following paragraphs.  \n2. LOSS ABSORPTION OF ADDITIONA L TIER 1 (AT1) INSTRUMENTS AT THE PRE -\nSPECIFIED TRIGGER  \nI. Loss Absorption Features  \n2.1 One of the criteria for AT1 capital instruments217 requires that these instruments sh ould \nhave principal loss absorption at an objective pre -specified trigger point throu gh either:  \n(i) conversion to common shares, or  \n                                                            \n216 Please refer to paragraph 2 of the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.38/21.06.201/2014 -15 dated September 1, 2014  on \nImplementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India -Amendments.  \n217 Please refer to the Appendices 4 & 5 of the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.98 /21.06.201/2011 -12 dated May 2, 2012  \non \u2018Guidelines on Implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India\u2019.  265 \n (ii) a write -down mechanism which allocates losses to the instrument.  \nThe write -down shall have the following effects:  \n(a) reduce the claim of the instrument in liquidation;  \n(b) reduce the amount re -paid when  a call is exercised; and  \n(c) partially or fully reduce coupon/dividend payments on the instrument.  \n2.2 Accordingly, banks may issue AT1 instruments with either conversion218 or write -down \n(temporary or permanent)219 mechanism.  \nII. Level of Pre -specified Trigg er and Amount of Equity to be Created by Conversion / \nWrite -down  \n2.3 The pre -specified trigger for loss absorption through conversion / write -down of Additional \nTier 1 instruments (PNCPS and PDI) must  be at least Common Equity Tier 1 capital of 6.125% of \nRWAs. The Write -down of any Common Equity Tier 1 capital shall not be required before a write -\ndown of any Additional Tier 1 capital instrument.  \n2.4 The conversion / write -down mechanism (temporary or permanent) which allocates losses \nto the Additional Tier 1 instruments (AT1) instruments must generate Common Equity Tier 1 \n(CET1) under applicable Indian Accounting Standards. The instrument will receive recognition in \nAT1 capital only upto the extent of minimum level of CET1 generated (i.e. , net of contingent \nliability recognised under the Indian Accounting Standards, potential tax liabilities, etc., if any) by \na full write -down / conversion of the instrument . \n2.5 Banks must obtain and keep on their records a certificate from the statutory auditors \nclearly stat ing that the conversion / write -down mechanism chosen by the bank for a particular \nAT1 issuance is able to generate CET1 under the prevailing accounting standards220. Further, \nbanks must  also obtain and keep on their records an external legal opinion confirm ing that the \nconversion or write -down of Additional Tier 1 capital instrument at the pre -specified trigger by the \nissuing bank is legally enforceable.  \n                                                            \n218 Conversion means conversion to common shares.  \n219 When a paid -up instrument is full y and permanently written -down, it ceases to exist resulting in extinguishment \nof a liability of a bank (a non -common equity instrument) and creates CET1. A temporary write -down is different \nfrom a conversion and a permanent write -down i.e., the original i nstrument may not be fully extinguished. Generally, \nthe par value of the instrument is written -down (decrease) on the occurrence of the trigger event and which may be \nwritten -up (increase) back to its original value in future depending upon the conditions prescribed in the terms and \nconditions of the instrument. The amount shown on the balance sheet subsequent to temporary write -down may \ndepend on the precise features of the instrument and the prevailing accounting standards.  \n220 Auditors certificate would be  required not only at the time of issuance of the instruments, but also whenever \nthere is a change in accounting norms / standards which may affect the ability of the loss absorbency mechanism of \nthe instrument to create CET1  266 \n 2.6 The aggregate amount to be written -down / converted for all AT1 instruments on breaching \nthe trigge r level must be at least the amount needed to immediately return the bank\u2019s CET1 ratio \nto the trigger level or, if this is not possible, the full principal value of the instruments. Further, the \nissuer should have full discretion to determine the amount of  AT1 instruments to be converted / \nwritten -down subject to the amount of conversion/write -down not exceeding the amount which \nwould be required to bring the CET1 ratio to 8% of RWAs (minimum CET1 of 5.5% + capital \nconservation buffer of 2.5%).  \n2.7 When a b ank breaches the pre -specified trigger of loss absorbency of AT1 and the equity \nis replenished either through conversion or write -down, such replenished amount of equity will be \nexcluded from the total equity of the bank for the purpose of determining the proportion of earnings \nto be paid out as dividend in terms of rules laid down for maintaining capital conservation buffer. \nHowever, once the bank has attained total Common Equity ratio of 8% without counting the \nreplenished equity capital, that point onwar ds, the bank may include the replenished equity capital \nfor all purposes221. \n2.8 The conversion / write -down may be allowed more than once in case a bank hits the pre -\nspecified trigger level subsequent to the first conversion / write -down which was partial.  \n2.9 The conversion / write -down of AT1 instruments are primarily intended to replenish the \nequity in the event it is depleted by losses. Therefore, banks should not use conversion / write -\ndown of AT1 instruments to support expansion of balance sheet by inc urring further obligations / \nbooking assets. Accordingly, a bank whose Common Equity ratio slips below 8% due to losses \nand is still above 6.125% i.e. , trigger point, should seek to expand its balance sheet further only \nby raising fresh equity from its exi sting shareholders or market and the internal accruals. However, \nfresh exposures can be taken to the extent of amortization of the existing ones. If any expansion \nin exposures, such as due to draw down of sanctioned borrowing limits, is inevitable, this sh ould \nbe compensated within the shortest possible time by reducing other exposures222. The bank \nshould maintain proper records to facilitate verification of these transactions by its internal \nauditors, statutory auditors and Inspecting Officers of RBI . \nIII. Treatment of AT1 Instruments in the event of Winding -Up, Amalgamation, \nAcquisition, Re -Constitution etc. of the Bank  \n2.10 If a bank goes into liquidation before the AT1 instruments have been written -down/ \nconverted, these instruments will absorb losses in a ccordance with the order of seniority indicated \nin the offer document and as per usual legal provisions governing priority of charges.  \n                                                            \n221 If the total CET1 ratio of t he bank falls again below the 8%, it would include the replenished capital for the purpose \nof applying the capital conservation buffer framework.  \n222 For the purpose of determination of breach of trigger, the fresh equity, if any, raised after slippage of C ET1 below \n8% will not be subtracted. In other words, if CET1 of the bank now is above the trigger level though it would have \nbeen below the trigger had it not raised the fresh equity which it did, the trigger will not be treated as breached.  267 \n 2.11 If a bank goes into liquidation after the AT1 instruments have been written -down, the \nholders of these instruments w ill have no claim on the proceeds of liquidation.  \n(a) Amalgamation of a banking company: (Section 44 A of BR Act, 1949)  \n2.12 If a bank is amalgamated with any other bank before the AT1 instruments have been \nwritten -down/converted, these instruments will be come part of the corresponding categories of \nregulatory capital of the new bank emerging after the merger.  \n2.13 If a bank is amalgamated with any other bank after the AT1 instruments have been written -\ndown temporarily, the amalgamated entity can write -up these instruments as per its discretion . \n2.14 If a bank is amalgamated with any other bank after the non -equity regulatory capital \ninstruments have been written -down permanently, these cannot be written -up by the \namalgamated entity . \n(b) Scheme of reconstitu tion or amalgamation of a banking company: (Section 45 of BR Act, \n1949)  \n2.15 If the relevant authorities decide to reconstitute a bank or amalgamate a bank with any \nother bank under the Section 45 of BR Act, 1949, such a bank will be deemed as non -viable o r \napproaching non -viability and both the pre -specified trigger and the trigger at the point of non -\nviability223 for conversion / write -down of AT1 instruments will be activated. Accordingly, the AT1 \ninstruments will be fully converted / written -down permanen tly before amalgamation / \nreconstitution in accordance with these rules.  \nIV. Fixation of Conversion Price, Capping of Number of Shares / Voting Rights  \n2.16 Banks may issue AT1 instruments with conversion features either based on price fixed at \nthe time of issuance or based on the market price prevailing at the time of conversion224. \n2.17 There will be possibility of the debt holders receiving a large number of shares in the event \nthe share price is very low at the time of conversion. Thus, debt holders will e nd up holding the \nnumber of shares and attached voting rights exceeding the legally permissible limits. Banks \nshould therefore, always keep sufficient headroom to accommodate the additional equity due to \nconversion without breaching any of the statutory / regulatory ceilings especially that for maximum \nprivate shareholdings and maximum voting rights per investors / group of related investors. In \norder to achieve this, banks should cap the number of shares and / or voting rights in accordance \nwith relevant l aws and regulations on Ownership and Governance of banks. Banks should \nadequately incorporate these features in the terms and conditions of the instruments in the offer \ndocument. In exceptional circumstances, if the breach is inevitable, the bank should im mediately \n                                                            \n223 As described  in subsequent paragraph 3 of this Annex.  \n224 Market price here does not mean the price prevailing on the date of conversion; banks can use any pricing formula \nsuch as weighted average price of shares during a particular period before conversion.  268 \n inform the Reserve Bank of India (Department of Regulation) about it. The investors will be \nrequired to bring the shareholdings below the statutory / regulatory ceilings within the specific time \nframe as determined by the Reserve Bank of India . \n2.18 In the case of unlisted banks, the conversion price should be determined based on the fair \nvalue of the bank\u2019s common shares to be estimated according to a mutually acceptable \nmethodology which should be in conformity with the standard market practice for valuation of \nshares of unlisted companies . \n2.19 In order to ensure the criteria that the issuing bank must maintain at all times all prior \nauthorisation necessary to immediately issue the relevant number of shares specified in the \ninstrument's terms an d conditions should the trigger event occur, the capital clause of each bank \nwill have to be suitably modified to take care of conversion aspects . \nV. Order of Conversion / Write -down of Various Types of AT1 Instruments  \n2.20 Banks should clearly indicate in  the offer document, the order of conversion / write -down \nof the instrument in question vis -\u00e0-vis other capital instruments which the bank has already issued \nor may issue in future, based on the advice of its legal counsels.  \n3. Minimum Requirements to Ensu re Loss Absorbency of Non -equity Regulatory \nCapital Instruments at the Point of Non -Viability  \nI. Mode of Loss Absorption and Trigger Event  \n3.1 The terms and conditions of all non -common equity Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments \nissued by banks in India must have a provision that requires such instruments, at the option of \nthe Reserve Bank of India, to either be written off or converted into common equity upon the \noccurrence of the trigger event, called the \u2018Point of Non -Viability (PONV) Trigger\u2019 stipulat ed below : \n(i) The PONV Trigger event is the earlier of:  \na. a decision that a conversion225 or write -off226, without which the firm would become \nnon-viable, is necessary, as determined by the Reserve Bank of India; and  \nb. the decision to make a public sector in jection of capital, or equivalent support, \nwithout which the firm would have become non -viable, as determined by the relevant \nauthority.  \nThe Write -off of any Common Equity Tier 1 capital shall not be required before the write -off of any \nNon-equity (Additio nal Tier 1 and Tier 2) regulatory capital instrument.  \n                                                            \n225 Conversio n means full conversion to common shares.  \n226 Write -off means fully and permanently write -off. 269 \n (ii) Such a decision would invariably imply that the write -off or issuance of any new shares as \na result of conversion consequent upon the trigger event must occur prior to any public sector \ninjection o f capital so that the capital provided by the public sector is not diluted. As such, the \ncontractual terms and conditions of an instrument must not provide for any residual claims on the \nissuer which are senior to ordinary shares of the bank (or banking gr oup entity where applicable), \nfollowing a trigger event and when conversion or write -off is undertaken . \n(iii) Any compensation paid to the instrument holders as a result of the write -off227 must  be \npaid immediately in the form of common shares.  \n(iv) The issu ing bank must maintain at all times all prior authorisation necessary to \nimmediately issue the relevant number of shares specified in the instrument\u2019s terms and \nconditions should the trigger event occur . \n(v) In order to ensure that these requirements are m et, banks should obtain and keep on their \nrecords  an external legal opinion confirming that the conversion or write -off feature of non -equity \ncapital instruments (Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2) by the RBI at the point of non -viability is legally \nenforceable . Further, the legal opinion should also confirm that there are no legal impediments to \nthe conversion of the instrument into ordinary shares of the bank (or a banking group entity, where \napplicable) or write -off upon a trigger event. The RBI may also requi re the bank to submit \nadditional information in order to ensure that such instruments are eligible for inclusion into \nregulatory capital.  \nII. A Non -viable Bank  \n3.2 For the purpose of these directions, a non -viable bank will be: \nA bank which, owing to its f inancial and other difficulties, may no longer remain a going concern \non its own in the opinion of the Reserve Bank unless appropriate measures are taken to revive \nits operations and thus, enable it to continue as a going concern. The difficulties faced by  a bank \nshould be such that these are likely to result in financial losses and raising the Common Equity \nTier 1 capital of the bank should be considered as the most appropriate way to prevent the bank \nfrom turning non -viable. Such measures would include wr ite-off / conversion of non -equity \nregulatory capital into common shares in combination with or without other measures as \nconsidered appropriate by the Reserve Bank228. \n                                                            \n227 Compensation in the form of common shares may be viewed as the simultaneous occurrence of (a) permanent \nwrite -off of the original instrument; and (b) creation of  new common shares issued in lieu of non -equity capital \ninstrument which is written -off, as compensation for its extinguishment. The precise mechanism may vary under the \naccounting standards. No compensation (i.e., zero common shares) is paid in case of fu ll and permanent write -off. \n228 In rare situations, a bank may also become non -viable due to non -financial problems, such as conduct of affairs \nof the bank in a manner which is detrimental to the interest of depositors, serious corporate governance issues, e tc. \nIn such situations raising capital is not considered a part of the solution and therefore, may not attract provisions of \nthis framework.  270 \n III. Restoring Viability  \n3.3 A bank facing financial difficulties and approaching a PONV will be deemed to achieve \nviability if within a reasonable time in the opinion of Reserve Bank, it will be able to come out of \nthe present difficulties if appropriate measures are taken to revive it. The measures including \naugmentation of equity capital th rough write -off/conversion/public sector injection of funds are \nlikely to : \na. Restore depositors\u2019/investors\u2019 confidence;  \nb. Improve rating /creditworthiness of the bank and thereby improve its borrowing capacity \nand liquidity and reduce cost of funds; and  \nc. Augment the resource base to fund balance sheet growth in the case of fresh injection of \nfunds.  \nIV. Other Requirements to be met by the Non -common Equity Capital Instruments so \nas to Absorb Losses at the PONV  \n3.4 Instruments may be issued with either of  the following feature:  \na. conversion; or  \nb. permanent write -off \n3.5 The amount of non -equity capital to be converted / written -off will be determined by RBI.  \n3.6 When a bank breaches the PONV trigger and the equity is replenished either through \nconversion  or write -off, such replenished amount of equity will be excluded from the total equity \nof the bank for the purpose of determining the proportion of earnings to be paid out as dividend \nin terms of rules laid down for maintaining capital conservation buffer . However, once the bank \nhas attained total Common Equity ratio of 8% without counting the replenished equity capital, that \npoint onwards, the bank may include the replenished equity capital for all purposes229. \n3.7 The provisions regarding treatment of AT1 instruments in the event of winding -up, \namalgamation, acquisition, re -constitution etc. of the bank as given in paragraphs 2.10 to 2.15 \nwill also be applicable to all non -common equity capital instruments (AT1 and Tier 2 capital \ninstruments) when these eve nts take place after conversion/write -off at the PONV.  \n3.8 The provisions regarding fixation of conversion price, capping of number of shares/voting \nrights applicable to AT1 instruments in terms of paragraphs 2.16 to 2.19 above will also be \napplicable for conversion of all non -common equity capital instruments (AT1 and Tier 2 capital \ninstruments) at the PONV . \n                                                            \n229 If the total CET1 ratio of the bank falls again below the total Common Equity ratio of 8%, it would include the \nreplenished capital for the purpose of applying the capital conservation buffer framework.  271 \n 3.9 The provisions regarding order of conversion/write -down of AT1 instruments as given in \nparagraph 2.20 above will also be applicable for conversion / write -off of all non -common equity \ncapital instruments (AT1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) at the PONV . \nV. Criteria to Determine the PONV  \n3.10 The above framework will be invoked when a bank is adjudged by Reserve Bank of India \nto be approaching the poi nt of non -viability, or has already reached the point of non -viability, but \nin the views of RBI : \na) there is a possibility that a timely intervention in form of capital support, with or without \nother supporting interventions, is likely to rescue the bank; and \nb) if left unattended, the weaknesses would inflict financial losses on the bank and, thus, \ncause decline in its common equity level.  \n3.11 The purpose of write -off and / or conversion of non -equity regulatory capital elements will \nbe to shore up the ca pital level of the bank. RBI would follow a two - stage approach to determine \nthe non -viability of a bank. The Stage 1  assessment would consist of purely objective and \nquantifiable criteria to indicate that there is a prima facie case of a bank approaching non-viability \nand, therefore, a closer examination of the bank\u2019s financial situation is warranted. The Stage 2  \nassessment would consist of supplementary subjective criteria which, in conjunction with the \nStage 1 information, would help in determining wheth er the bank is about to become non -viable. \nThese criteria would be evaluated together and not in isolation . \n3.12 Once the PONV is confirmed, the next step would be to decide whether rescue of the bank \nwould be through write -off/conversion alone or write -off/conversion in conjunction with a public \nsector injection of funds . \n3.13 The trigger at PONV will be evaluated both at consolidated and solo level and breach at \neither level will trigger conversion / write -off. \n3.14 As the capital adequacy is applicable b oth at solo and consolidated levels, the minority \ninterests  in respect of capital instruments issued by subsidiaries of banks including overseas \nsubsidiaries can be included in the consolidated capital of the banking group only if these \ninstruments have pr e-specified triggers (in case of AT1 capital instruments) / loss absorbency at \nthe PONV230 (for all non -common equity capital instruments). In addition, where a bank wishes \nthe instrument issued by its subsidiary to be included in the consolidated group\u2019s ca pital in addition \n                                                            \n230 The cost to the parent of its investment in each subsidiary and the parent\u2019s portion of equity of each subsidiary, \nat the date on which investment in each subsidiar y is made, is eliminated as per AS -21. So, in case of wholly -owned \nsubsidiaries, it would not matter whether or not it has same characteristics as the bank\u2019s capital. However, in the \ncase of less than wholly owned subsidiaries (or in the case of non -equity  regulatory capital of the wholly owned \nsubsidiaries, if issued to the third parties), minority interests constitute additional capital for the banking group over \nand above what is counted at solo level; therefore, it should be admitted only when it (and c onsequently the entire \ncapital in that category) has the same characteristics as the bank\u2019s capital.  272 \n to its solo capital, the terms and conditions of that instrument must specify an additional trigger \nevent . \nThis additional trigger event is the earlier of:  \n(1) a decision that a conversion or write -off, without which the bank or the subsi diary would \nbecome non -viable, is necessary, as determined by the Reserve Bank of India; and  \n(2) the decision to make a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, without \nwhich the bank or the subsidiary would have become non -viable, as det ermined by the \nReserve Bank of India. Such a decision would invariably imply that the write -off or \nissuance of any new shares as a result of conversion consequent upon the trigger event \nshall occur prior to any public sector injection of capital so that th e capital provided by \nthe public sector is not diluted.  \n3.15 In such cases, the subsidiary sh ould obtain its regulator\u2019s approval/no -objection for \nallowing the capital instrument to be converted/written -off at the additional trigger point referred \nto in pa ragraph 3.14 above.  \n3.16 Any common shares paid as compensation to the holders of the instrument must  be \ncommon shares of either the issuing subsidiary or the parent bank (including any successor in \nresolution).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 273 \n Annex 17  \n(cf para 4.3.5)  \nCalcul ation of Minority Interest - Illustrative Example  \nThis Annex illustrates the treatment of minority interest and other capital issued out of subsidiaries \nto third parties, which is set out in paragraph 4.3 of this Master Circular . \nA banking group for this p urpose consists of two legal entities that are both banks. Bank P is the \nparent and Bank S is the subsidiary and their unconsolidated balance sheets are set out below:  \nBank P Balance Sheet   Bank S Balance Sheet   \nAssets   Assets   \nLoans to customers  100 Loans to customers  150 \nInvestment in CET1 of Bank S  7   \nInvestment in the AT1 of Bank S  4   \nInvestment in the T2 of Bank S  2   \nTotal  113 Total  150 \nLiabilities and equity   Liabilities and equity   \nDepositors  70 Depositors  127 \nTier 2  10 Tier 2  8 \nAddition al Tier 1  7 Additional Tier 1  5 \nCommon equity  26 Common equity  10 \nTotal  113 Total  150 \n \nThe balance sheet of Bank P shows that in addition to its loans to customers, it owns 70% of the \ncommon shares of Bank S, 80% of the Additional Tier 1 of Bank S and 2 5% of the Tier 2 capital \nof Bank S.  \nThe ownership of the capital of Bank S is therefore as follows:  \nCapital issued by Bank S  \n Amount issued to  \nparent  \n(Bank P)  Amount  \nissued to  \nthird parties  Total  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1)  7 3 10 \nAdditional Tier 1 (AT1 ) 4 1 5 \nTier 1 (T1)  11 4 15 \nTier 2 (T2)  2 6 8 \nTotal capital (TC)  13 10 23 \n \n \n \n \n 274 \n Consolidated Balance Sheet  \nAssets   Remarks  \nLoans to customers  250 Investments of P in S aggregating  \nRs.13 will  be  cancelled  during  \naccounting consolidation.  \nLiabilitie s and equity    \nDepositors  197  \nTier 2 issued by subsidiary to third  \nParties  6 (8-2) \nTier 2 issued by parent  10  \nAdditional Tier 1 issued by subsidiary  \nto third parties  1 (5-4) \nAdditional Tier 1 issued by parent  7  \nCommon equity issued by subsidiary  \nto third parties (i.e. minority interest)  3 (10-7) \nCommon equity issued by parent  26  \nTotal  250  \n \nFor illustrative purposes Bank S is assumed to have risk weighted assets of 100 against the actual \nvalue of assets of 150. In this example, the minimum capi tal requirements of Bank S and the \nsubsidiary\u2019s contribution to the consolidated requirements are the same. This means that it is \nsubject to the following minimum plus capital conservation buffer requirements and has the \nfollowing surplus capital:  \nMinimum and surplus capital of Bank S  \n Minimum plus capital  \nconservation buffer  \nrequired231 Actual  \ncapital  \navailable  Surplus  \n(3-2) \n1 2 3 4 \nCommon Equity \nTier 1 capital  7.0 \n(= 7.0% of 100)  10 3.0 \nTier 1 capital  8.5 \n(= 8.5% of 100)  15 \n(10+5)  6.5 \nTotal capital  10.5 \n(= 10.5% of 100)  23 \n(10+5+8)  12.5  \n \nThe following table illustrates how to calculate the amount of capital issued by Bank S to include \nin consolidated capital, following the calculation procedure set out in paragraph 4.3.4 of this \nMaster Circular : \n \n \n                                                            \n231 Illustration is based on Basel III minima as indicated in the BCBS document \u2018Basel III: A global regulatory \nframework for more resilient banks and bankin g systems issued in December 2010 (rev June 2011)\u2019 The Common \nEquity Tier 1 in the example should be read to include issued common shares plus retained earnings and reserves in \nBank S.  275 \n Bank  S: Amount of capital issued to third parties included in consolidated capital  \n Total  \namount  \nissued  \n(a) Amount  \nissued  \nto third  \nparties  \n(b) Surplus  \n(c) Surplus attributable to \nthird parties  (i.e., \namount excluded from \nconsolidated capital)  \n(d) = (c) * (b)/ (a) Amount  \nincluded in  \nconsolidated  \ncapital  \n(e) = (b) \u2013 (d) \nCommon  \nEquity  \nTier 1  \ncapital  10 3 3.0 0.90  2.10  \nTier 1 \ncapital  15 4 6.5 1.73  2.27  \nTotal \ncapital  23 10 12.5  5.43  4.57  \n \nThe following table summarises the components of capital for the consolida ted group based on \nthe amounts calculated in the table above.

Risk exposure and assessment  \nThe risks to which banks are exposed and the techniques that banks use to identify, meas ure, \nmonitor and control those risks are important factors market participants consider in their \nassessment of an institution. In this section, several key banking risks are considered: credit risk, \nmarket risk, and interest rate risk in the banking book a nd operational risk. Also included in this \nsection are disclosures relating to credit risk mitigation and asset securitisation, both of which \nalter the risk profile of the institution. Where applicable, separate disclosures are set out for banks \nusing diff erent approaches to the assessment of regulatory capital.  \n2.1 General qualitative disclosure requirement  \nFor each separate risk area (e.g. , credit, market, operational, banking book interest rate risk) \nbanks must describe their risk management objectives  and policies, including:  \n(i) strategies and processes;  \n(ii) the structure and organisation of the relevant risk management function;  \n(iii) the scope and nature of risk reporting and/or measurement systems;  \n(iv) policies for hedging and/or mitigating risk and strategies a nd processes for monitoring \nthe continuing effectiveness of hedges/mitigants.  \n 279 \n Credit risk  \nGeneral disclosures of credit risk provide market participants with a range of information about \noverall credit exposure and need not necessarily be based on infor mation prepared for regulatory \npurposes. Disclosures on the capital assessment techniques give information on the specific \nnature of the exposures, the means of capital assessment and data to assess the reliability of the \ninformation disclosed.  \nTable DF -3: Credit Risk: General Disclosures for All Banks  \nQualitative Disclosures  \n(a) The general qualitative disclosure requirement with respect to credit risk, including:  \n\uf0b7 Definitions of past due and impaired (for accounting purposes);  \n\uf0b7 Discussion of the bank\u2019s c redit risk management policy;  \nQuantitative Disclosures  \n(b) Total gross credit risk exposures235, Fund based and Non -fund based separately.  \n(c) Geographic distribution of exposures236, Fund based and Non -fund based separately  \n\uf0b7 Overseas  \n\uf0b7 Domestic  \n(d) Indust ry237 type distribution of exposures, fund based and non -fund based separately  \n(e) Residual contractual maturity breakdown of assets,238 \n(f) Amount of NPAs (Gross)  \n\uf0b7 Substandard  \n\uf0b7 Doubtful 1  \n\uf0b7 Doubtful 2  \n\uf0b7 Doubtful 3  \n\uf0b7 Loss  \n(g) Net NPAs  \n(h) NPA Ratios  \n\uf0b7 Gross NPA s to gross advances  \n\uf0b7 Net NPAs to net advances  \n(i) Movement of NPAs (Gross)  \no Opening balance  \no Additions  \no Reductions  \no Closing balance  \n(j) Movement of provisions (Separate disclosure shall be made for specific provisions and \ngeneral provisions held by the b ank with a description of each type of provisions held )  \n\uf0b7 Opening balance  \n\uf0b7 Provisions made during the period  \n\uf0b7 Write -off  \n\uf0b7 Write -back of excess provisions  \n                                                            \n235 That is after accounting offsets in accordance with the applicable accounting regime and without taking into \naccount the effects of credit risk mitigation techniques, e.g., collateral and  netting.  \n236 That is, on the same basis as adopted for Segment Reporting adopted for compliance with AS 17.  \n237 The industries break -up may be provided on the same lines as prescribed for DSB returns. If the exposure to any \nparticular industry is more than 5 per cent of the gross credit exposure as computed under (b) above it should be \ndisclosed separately.  \n238 Banks shall use the same maturity bands as used for reporting positions in the ALM returns.  280 \n \uf0b7 Any other adjustments, including transfers between provisions  \n\uf0b7 Closing balance  \n \nIn addition, write -offs and recoveries that have been booked directly to the income \nstatement should be disclosed separately.  \n  \n(k) Amount of Non -Performing Investments  \n(l) Amount of provisions held for non -performing investments  \n(m) Movement of provisions for depreciation on  investments  \n\uf0b7 Opening balance  \n\uf0b7 Provisions made during the period  \n\uf0b7 Write -off  \n\uf0b7 Write -back of excess provisions  \n\uf0b7 Closing balance  \n \n(n) By major industry or counterparty type:  \n\uf0b7 Amount of NPAs and if available, past due loans, provided separately;  \n\uf0b7 Specific and general provisions; and  \n\uf0b7 Specific provisions and write -offs during the current period.  \n \nIn addition, banks are encouraged also to provide an analysis of the ageing of past -due \nloans.  \n  \n(o) Amount of NPAs and, if available, past due loans provided separate ly broken down by \nsignificant geographic areas including, if practical, the amounts of specific and general \nprovisions related to each geographical area.

For repo -style transactions  \nThe effects of bilateral netting agreements covering repo -style transactions will be recognised on \na counterparty -by-counterparty basis if the agreements are legally enforceable in each relevant \njurisdiction upon the occurrence of an event of default and regardless of whether the counterparty \nis insolvent or bankrupt. In addition, netting agreements must:  \na) provide the non -defaulting party the right to terminate and close -out in a timely manner \nall transactions under the agreement upon an event of default, including in the event \nof insolvency or bankruptcy of the counterparty;  \nb) provide for the netting of gains and losses on transactions (including the value of any \ncollateral) terminated and closed out under it so that a single net amount is owed by \none party to the other;  \nc) allow for the prompt liquidation or setoff of collateral upon the event of default; and  \nd) be, together with the rights arising from the provisions required in (a) to (c) above, \nlegally enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction upon the occurrence of an ev ent of \ndefault and regardless of the counterparty's insolvency or bankruptcy.  \ne) Netting across positions in the banking and trading book will only be recognised when \nthe netted transactions fulfil the following conditions:  \n(i) All transactions are marked  to market daily258; and  \n(ii) The collateral instruments used in the transactions are recognised as eligible \nfinancial collateral in the banking book.  \nB. For Derivatives transactions  \n(a) Banks may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligat ion between a \nbank and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically \namalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value date, legally substituting \none single amount for the previous gross obligation s.  \n(b) Banks may also net transactions subject to any legally valid form of bilateral netting not \ncovered in (a), including other forms of novation.  \n                                                            \n258 The holding period for the haircuts will depend as in other repo -style transactions on the freque ncy of margining.  311 \n (c) In both cases (a) and (b), a bank will need to satisfy that it has:  \n(i) A netting contract or agreeme nt with the counterparty which creates a single legal \nobligation, covering all included transactions, such that the bank would have either a \nclaim to receive or obligation to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative \nmark -to-market values of includ ed individual transactions in the event a counterparty \nfails to perform due to any of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar \ncircumstances;  \n(ii) Written and reasoned legal opinions that, in the event of a legal challenge, the relevant \ncourts and administrative authorities would find the bank's exposure to be such a net \namount under:  \n\uf0b7 The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if the \nforeign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the  \njurisdiction in which the branch is located;  \n\uf0b7 The law that governs the individual transactions; and  \n\uf0b7 The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the netting.  \n(iii) Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of net ting arrangements \nare kept under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law.  \n(d) Contracts containing walkaway clauses will not be eligible for netting for the purpose of \ncalculating capital requirements under these guidelines. A walkaway cla use is a provision which \npermits a non -defaulting counterparty to make only limited payments or no payment at all, to the \nestate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter is a net creditor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 312 \n Annex 21  \n(cf para 3.4.7)  \nGuidelines on General permission f or infusion of capital in overseas branches and \nbanking subsidiaries and retention/ repatriation/ transfer of profits in these centres by \nbanks incorporated in India  \nBanks which meet the regulatory capital requirements (including capital buffers259) may, wit h the \napproval of their boards:  \na) infuse  capital in their overseas branches and banking subsidiaries ; and  \nb) retain profits in, and transfer or repatriate profits from these overseas centres . \n2.

The guidelines in this Annex are not applicable to foreign banks, Small Finance Banks, \nPayments Banks and Regional Rural Banks.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n259 Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB), including Domestic \u2013 Systemically Important Bank (D -SIB) capital requirements \nwhere applicable, and Counter -Cyclical Capital Buffer as may be mandated.  \n260 In case of retention of profits in overseas bra nch/ subsidiary, the reporting shall be done within 30 days of the \nfinalisation of the annual financial statements of the overseas branch/ subsidiary.  313 \n Annex 2 2 \n(refer para 4.4.2(iii) ) \nCalculation of 15% of common equity limit on item s subject to limited recognition (i.e. , \nDTAs associated with timing differences and significant investments in common shares \nof unconsolidated financial entities)  \n \n1. Banks must follow the 15% limit on significant investments in the common shares of \nuncons olidated financial institutions (banks, insurance and other financial entities) and deferred \ntax assets arising from timing differences (collectively referred to as specified items) as stipulated \nin paragraph 3 of this circular.  \n2. The recognition of these  specified items will be limited to 15% of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) \ncapital, after the application of all deductions. To determine the maximum amount of the specified \nitems that can be recognised*, banks should multiply the amount of CET1** (after all d eductions, \nincluding after the deduction of the specified items in full i.e. , specified items should be fully \ndeducted from CET1 along with other deductions first for arriving at CET1**) by 17.65%. This \nnumber i.e. , 17.65% is derived from the proportion of  15% to 85% (15%/85% = 17.65%).  \n3. As an example, take a bank with Rs.85 of common equity (calculated net of all deductions, \nincluding after the deduction of the specified items in full).  \n4. The maximum amount of specified items that can be recognised by t his bank in its calculation \nof CET1 capital is Rs.85 x 17.65% = Rs.15. Any excess above Rs.15 must be deducted from \nCET1. If the bank has specified items (excluding amounts deducted after applying the individual \n10% limits) that in aggregate sum up to the 15% limit, CET1 after inclusion of the specified items, \nwill amount to Rs.85 + Rs.15 = Rs.100. The percentage of specified items to total CET1 would \nequal 15%.  \n \n \n \n \n \n* The actual amount that will be recognised may be lower than this maximum, either because the sum of the three \nspecified items are below the 15% limit set out in this annex, or due to the application of the 10% limit applied to each \nitem.  \n** At this point, this is a \"hypothetical\" amount of CET1 in that it is used only for the purposes of deter mining the \ndeduction of the specified items.  \n 314 \n Annex 2 3 \n(refer para 5.9.3 ) \nIllustrations of revised instructions on Regulatory Retail  \nScenario 1  : As on October 12, 2020, a bank has an exposure of \u20b94 crore to borrower A which \nqualifies for classification as  \u2018regulatory retail\u2019 in terms of Paragraph 5.9 of the Master Circular. \nAccordingly, it attracts 75% risk weight.  \nIf the bank takes an additional exposure to borrower A upto \u20b97.5 crore and which continues to \nsatisfy all other eligibility criteria of para 5. 9 of the above -mentioned circular, the entire revised \nexposure shall qualify for classification as \u2018regulatory retail\u2019 and attract 75% risk weight.  \nScenario 2  : As on October 12, 2020, a bank has an exposure of \u20b96 crore to borrower B.

While the definition of \u2018Netting Set \u2019 \nprovided in para 5.15.3.3 requires \nNetting Set to be formed basis legally \nenforceable bilateral netting \narrangement, The Bilatera l Netting of \nQualified Financial Contracts Act, \n2020 stipulates that bilateral netting \nact applies to a Qualified Financial \nContract entered into on a bilateral \nbasis between qualified financial \nmarket participants, either under a \nnetting agreement or othe rwise.  \nClarification Required on the \nfollowing  \na) Whether the Bank can legally \nenforce bilateral netting \narrangements without executing \nseparate mutual bilateral agreements \nwith each counterparty?  \nb) If response for part \u201ca\u201d is \u201cYes\u201d \nthen, do the Banks st ill need to satisfy \nthe terms & conditions as articulated \nin Annexure 20 \u2013 part b of Basel III \ncapital regulations?  To avail the benefit of bilateral netting for \ncomputation of regulatory capital requirement for \nderivative transactions, the bank shall have  an \neffective bilateral netting contract or agreement \nwith each counterparty, as specified in Annex 20 \n(Part B ). \n \n2.  Paragraph 5.15.3.5(vi) provides the \nformula for computation of credit \nexposure for \u2018bilaterally netted \nforward transactions\u2019. Please clarify   \na) whether the term \u2018bilaterally netted \nforward transactions\u2019 means \u2018all \nbilaterally netted contracts maturing \non a future date\u2019; and  \nb) whether A Net formula be applied \nconsidering all types of deals in the \nnetting set or only those where the (a) Bilateral Netting as per para 5.15.3.5(vi), shall \nbe applicable for all over -the-counter (OTC) \nderivative exposures to a counterparty, arising \nfrom the netting set covered by a qualifying \nbilateral netting agreement, subject to meeting \nthe criterion prescribed for effective bilateral \nnetting contracts as specified in Annex 20 (Part \nB).  \n(b) For such exposures as at (a) above, as \nspecified in para 5.15.3.5 (vi) , Replacement Cost \nwill be Net Replacement Cost and Potential \nFuture Exposure will be A Net. A Net is calculated \nusing gross add -on (A Gross) and NGR. Gross add -317 \n  Banks\u2019 Query  Our Response  \nnotional pr incipal amount is \nequivalent to cash flows.  \n \n on (A Gross), in turn, is calculated as sum of \nindividual add -on amounts (add -on factor \nmultiplied by notional principal amount).  \n(c) However, whi le calculating add -on amounts in \ncase of forward foreign exchange contracts or \nother similar contracts where notional principal \namount is equivalent to cash flows, the notional \nprincipal amount can be taken as the net receipts \nfalling due on each value dat e in each currency.  \n3.  The definition of cross -product \nnetting, as per paragraph 5.15.3.3, \nprovides that \u201cCross -Product Netting \nrefers to the inclusion of transactions \nof different product categories within \nthe same netting set\u201d. Also, footnote \n120 provides  that cross -product \nnetting is not permitted in determining \nthe leverage ratio exposure measure.  \nIn this regard, please clarify  \na) meaning of product categories in \ndefinition of cross -product netting  \nb) whether cross -product netting is \nallowed for capital adequacy \nframework.  The term \u2018product categories\u2019 in the definition of \ncross -product netting refers to (a) OTC derivative \ntransactions and (b) repo / reverse repo.  \nCross -Product Netting is not permitted for capital \nadequacy as well as leverage ratio measu re. \nThus, all eligible OTC derivative transactions with \na counterparty will form part of one netting set and \nall eligible OTC repo / reverse repo transactions \nwith that counterparty will form part of a separate \nnetting set.  \n \n4.  The definition of \u2018Outstandin g EAD\u2019, \nas per paragraph 5.15.3.3, provides \nthat \u201cOutstanding EAD for a given \nOTC derivative counterparty is \ndefined as the greater of zero and the \ndifference between the sum of EADs \nacross all netting sets with the \ncounterparty and the credit valuation \nadjustment (CVA) for that \ncounterparty which has already been \nrecognised by the bank as an \nincurred write -down (i .e., a CVA \nloss)\u201d.  \nIn this regard, please clarify whether \n\u201cCVA loss\u201d mentioned above refers to \n\u201cIncurred CVA loss\u201d as per paragraph The total capital charge for counterparty credit \nrisk in OTC derivatives is sum of capital charge to \ncover the default risk and capital charge for credit \nvaluation adjustment (CVA) risk. CVA risk is credit \nmigration risk of the counterparty reflected in \nmark -to-market losses on the expected \ncounterparty risk.  \nThe \u2018capital charge for default risk\u2019 will be \ncalculated using Current Exposure Method \n(CEM) as explained in paragraph 5.15.3.5. Under \nCEM, the exposure a mount for default risk is the \ncredit equivalent amount of a market related off -\nbalance sheet transaction calculated as the sum \nof current credit exposure and potential future \ncredit exposure of OTC derivative contracts. The \ncredit equivalent amount will be  adjusted for \nlegally valid eligible financial collaterals and the 318 \n  Banks\u2019 Query  Our Response  \n8.8.1.2 or \u201cC VA Capital charge as per \nparagraph 5.15.3.6.  \n provisions held by the bank for CVA losses. The \nCVA loss will be calculated as per instructions \ncontained in paragraph 8.8.1.2.  \n \nIn addition to the default risk capital requirement \nfor cou nterparty credit risk as discussed above, \nbanks are also required to compute an additional \ncapital charge to cover the risk of mark -to-market \nlosses on the expected counterparty risk (such \nlosses being known as credit value adjustments, \nCVA) to OTC derivat ives. The CVA capital charge \nwill be calculated as per instructions given in para \n5.15.3.6.  \n \nIn the definition of \u2018Outstanding EAD\u2019, the \nreference has been made to \u2018CVA loss\u2019 which \nshould be calculated as per paragraph 8.8.1.2 . \n5.  With the revised guideline s, trades \nacross maturities within a netting set \nwill be netted. In this connection, \nplease clarify whether the Long -term, \nor Short -term ratings shall be \nconsidered for claims on corporates.  The risk -weight corresponding to the worst \napplicable long -term r ating of the counterparty \nshould be applied.  \n \n6.  Paragraph 7.3.9 provides that \ncollateral can be used to net off \nexposure (RC as well as PFE) under \ncapital adequacy framework. \nHowever, for leverage ratio, \nparagraph 16.4.3.9 provides Cash \nvariation margin ca nnot be used to \nreduce the PFE amount. Please \nclarify whether collateral (cash \nvariation margin) can be used for PFE \nas well.  \n The collateral can be netted against both \nreplacement cost and PFE for capital adequacy \npurposes.  \nWhile computing for leverage ratio exposure \nmeasure, as provided in paragraph 16.4.3.5 to \n16.4.3.9, collateral cannot be netted against \nderivative exposure (RC and PFE). However, \ncash variation margin can be used to reduce \nreplacement cost portion of the leverage ratio \nexposure measur e, but not the PFE subject to \nconditions provided in paragraph 16.4.3.8 and \n16.4.3.9.  \n \n \n \n 319 \n Annex 2 6 \nGLOSSARY  \nAsset  An asset is anything of value that is owned by a person or business  \nAvailable for Sale  The securities available for sale are those securi ties where the intention of \nthe bank is neither to trade nor to hold till maturity. These securities are \nvalued at the fair value which is determined by reference to the best available \nsource of current market quotations or other data relative to current v alue.  \nBalance Sheet  A balance sheet is a financial statement of the assets and liabilities of a \ntrading concern, recorded at a particular point in time.  \nBanking Book  The banking book comprises assets and liabilities, which are contracted \nbasically on  account of relationship or for steady income and statutory \nobligations and are generally held till maturity.  \nBasel Committee \non Banking \nSupervision  The Basel Committee is a committee of bank supervisors consisting of \nmembers from each of the G10 countr ies. The Committee is a forum for \ndiscussion on the handling of specific supervisory problems. It coordinates \nthe sharing of supervisory responsibilities among national authorities in \nrespect of banks' foreign establishments with the aim of ensuring effect ive \nsupervision of banks' activities worldwide. Update with latest  \nBasic Indicator \nApproach  An operational risk measurement technique permitted under Basel II. The \napproach sets a charge for operational risk as a fixed percentage (\"alpha \nfactor\") of a s ingle indicator. The indicator serves as a proxy for the bank's \nrisk exposure.  \nBasis Risk  The risk that the interest rate of different assets, liabilities and off -balance \nsheet items may change in different magnitude is termed as basis risk.  \nCapital  Capital refers to the funds (e.g., money, loans, equity, etc.) which are \navailable to carry on a business, make an investment, and generate future \nrevenue. Capital also refers to physical assets which can be used to generate \nfuture returns.  \nCapital adequ acy  A measure of the adequacy of an entity's capital resources in relation to its \ncurrent liabilities and also in relation to the risks associated with its assets.  \nAn appropriate level of capital adequacy ensures that the entity has sufficient \ncapital to  support its activities and that its net worth is sufficient to absorb \nadverse changes in the value of its assets without becoming insolvent. For \nexample, under BIS (Bank for International Settlements) rules, banks are \nrequired to maintain a certain level of capital against their risk -adjusted \nassets.  \nCapital reserves  That portion of a company's profits not paid out as dividends to shareholders. \nThey are also known as undistributable reserves.  \nConvertible Bond  A bond giving the investor the option to convert the bond into equity at a fixed \nconversion price or as per a pre -determined pricing formula.  \nCredit risk  Risk that a party to a contractual agreement or transaction will be unable to \nmeet their obligations or will default on commitments. Credit risk can be \nassociated with almost any transaction or instrument such as swaps, repos, \nCDs, foreign exchange transactions, etc.  \nSpecific types of credit risk include sovereign risk, country risk, legal or force \nmajeure risk, marginal risk and settlement r isk. \nDebentures  Bonds issued by a company bearing a fixed rate of interest usually payable \nhalf yearly on specific dates and principal amount repayable on a particular \ndate on redemption of the debentures.  \n \n 320 \n Deferred Tax \nAssets  Unabsorbed depreciation  and carry forward of losses which can be set -off \nagainst future taxable income which is considered as timing differences \nresult in deferred tax assets. The deferred Tax Assets are accounted as per \nthe Accounting Standard 22.  \nDeferred Tax Assets have an e ffect of decreasing future income tax \npayments, which indicates that they are prepaid income taxes and meet \ndefinition of assets. Whereas deferred tax liabilities have an effect of \nincreasing future year's income tax payments, which indicates that they are  \naccrued income taxes and meet definition of liabilities  \nDelta (\u0394)  The delta of an option / a portfolio of options is the rate of change in the value \nof the option / portfolio with respect to change in the price of the asset(s) \nunderlying the option(s).  \nDerivative  A derivative instrument derives much of its value from an underlying product. \nExamples of derivatives include futures, options, forwards and swaps. For \nexample, a forward contract can be derived from the spot currency market \nand the spot markets for borrowing and lending. In the past, derivative \ninstruments tended to be restricted only to those products which could be \nderived from spot markets. However, today the term seems to be used for \nany product that can be derived from any other.  \nDuration  Duration (Macaulay duration) measures the price volat ility of fixed income \nsecurities. It is often used in the comparison of the interest rate risk between \nsecurities with different coupons and different maturities. It is the weighted \naverage of the present value of all the cash flows associated with a fixed  \nincome security. It is expressed in years. The duration of a fixed income \nsecurity is always shorter than its term to maturity, except in the case of zero \ncoupon securities where they are the same.  \nForeign \nInstitutional \nInvestor  An institution establis hed or incorporated outside India which proposes to \nmake investment in India insecurities; provided that a domestic asset \nmanagement company or domestic portfolio manager who manages funds \nraised or collected or brought from outside India for investment in  India on \nbehalf of a sub -account, shall be deemed to be a Foreign Institutional \nInvestor.  \nForward Contract  A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an \nagreed amount of a commodity or financial instrument at an agreed price,  for \ndelivery on an agreed future date. In contrast to a futures contract, a forward \ncontract is not transferable or exchange tradable, its terms are not \nstandardized and no margin is exchanged. The buyer of the forward contract \nis said to be long the cont ract and the seller is said to be short the contract.  \nGamma(\u0413)  The gamma of an option / portfolio of options is the rate of change of the \noption\u2019s / portfolio\u2019s delta with respect to the change in the price of the \nasset(s) underlying the option (s).  \nGeneral \nprovisions & loss \nreserves  Such reserves, if the y are not attributable to the actual diminution in value or \nidentifiable potential loss in any specific asset and are available to meet \nunexpected losses, can be included in Tier II capital.  \nGeneral market \nrisk  Risk that relates to overall market condit ions while specific risk is risk that \nrelates to the issuer of a particular security  \nHedging  Taking action to eliminate or reduce exposure to risk  \nHeld for Trading  Securities where the intention is to trade by taking advantage of short -term \nprice / in terest rate movements.  \nHorizontal \nDisallowance  A disallowance of offsets to required capital used the BIS Method for \nassessing market risk for regulatory capital. In order to calculate the capital \nrequired for interest rate risk of a trading portfolio, the BIS Method allows \noffsets of long and short positions. Yet interest rate risk of instruments at \ndifferent horizontal points of the yield curve are not perfectly correlated. \nHence, the BIS Method requires that a portion of these offsets be disallowed.  321 \n Interest rate risk  Risk that the financial value of assets or liabilities (or inflows/outflows) will be \naltered because of fluctuations in interest rates. For example, the risk that \nfuture investment may have to be made at lower rates and future borrowin gs \nat higher rates.  \nLong Position  A long position refers to a position where gains arise from a rise in the value \nof the underlying.  \nMarket risk  Risk of loss arising from movements in market prices or rates away from the \nrates or prices set out in a transaction or agreement.  \nModified Duration  The modified duration or volatility of an interest bearing security is its \nMacaulay duration divided by one plus the coupon rate of the security. It \nrepresents the percentage change in a securities' price for a 100 basis points \nchange in yield. It is generally accurate for only small changes in the yield.  \n \n \nwhere: MD = Modified duration  \nP = Gross price (i.e. clean price plus accrued interest).  \ndP = Corresponding small change in price.  \ndY = Small change in yield compounded with the frequency of the coupon \npayment.  \nMortgage -backed \nsecurity  As defined in the  Master Direction  DOR.STR.REC.53/21.04.177/2021 -22 \ndated September 24, 2021 \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Securitisation of \nStandard Assets) Directions, 2021 .  \nMutual Fund  Mutual Fund is a mechanism for pooling the resources by issuing units to the \ninvestors and investing funds in securities in accordance with objectives as \ndisclosed in offer document. A fund established in the form of a trust to raise \nmonie s through the sale of units to the public or a section of the public under \none or more schemes for investing in securities, including money market \ninstruments.  \nNet Interest \nMargin  Net interest margin is the net interest income divided by average interes t \nearning assets  \nNet NPA  Net NPA = Gross NPA \u2013 (Balance in Interest Suspense account + \nDICGC/ECGC claims received and held pending adjustment + Part payment \nreceived and kept in suspense account + Total provisions held)\u2018  \nNostro accounts  Foreign curre ncy settlement accounts that a bank maintains with its overseas \ncorrespondent banks. These accounts are assets of the domestic bank.  \nOff-Balance Sheet \nexposures  Off-Balance Sheet exposures refer to the business activities of a bank that \ngenerally do not  involve booking assets (loans) and taking deposits. Off -\nbalance sheet activities normally generate fees, but produce liabilities or \nassets that are deferred or contingent and thus, do not appear on the \ninstitution's balance sheet until or unless they beco me actual assets or \nliabilities.  \nOpen position  It is the net difference between the amounts payable and amounts receivable \nin a particular instrument or commodity. It results from the existence of a net \nlong or net short position in the particular instru ment or commodity.  \nOption  An option is a contract which grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, \nto buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset, commodity, currency or \nfinancial instrument at an agreed rate (exercise price) on or before a n agreed \ndate (expiry or settlement date). The buyer pays the seller an amount called \nthe premium in exchange for this right. This premium is the price of the \noption.  \nRho(\u03c1)  Rho of an option / a portfolio of options is the rate of change in the value of  \nan option / portfolio with respect to change in the level of interest rates.  \n \n322 \n Risk  The possibility of an outcome not occurring as expected. It can be measured \nand is not the same as uncertainty, which is not measurable. In financial \nterms, risk refers to the possibility of financial loss. It can be classified as \ncredit risk, market risk and operational risk.  \nRisk Asset Ratio  A bank's risk asset ratio is the ratio of a bank's risk assets to its capital funds. \nRisk assets include assets other than high ly rated government and \ngovernment agency obligations and cash, for example, corporate bonds and \nloans. The capital funds include capital and undistributed reserves. The lower \nthe risk asset ratio the better the bank's 'capital cushion'  \nRisk Weights  Basel II sets out a risk -weighting schedule for measuring the credit risk of \nobligors. The risk weights are linked to ratings given to sovereigns, financial \ninstitutions and corporations by external credit rating agencies.  \nSecuritisation  As defined in the  Master Direction  DOR.STR.REC.53/21.04.177/2021 -22 \ndated September 24, 2021 \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Securitisation of \nStandard Assets) Directions, 2021.   \nShort position  A short position refers to a position where gains arise from a decline in the \nvalue o f the underlying. It also refers to the sale of a security in which the \nseller does not have a long position.  \nSpecific risk  Within the framework of the BIS proposals on market risk, specific risk refers \nto the risk associated with a specific security, i ssuer or company, as opposed \nto the risk associated with a market or market sector (general risk).  \nSubordinated \ndebt  Refers to the status of the debt. In the event of the bankruptcy or liquidation \nof the debtor, subordinated debt only has a secondary cl aim on repayments, \nafter other debt has been repaid.  \nTheta(\u03b8)  The theta of an option / a portfolio of options is the rate of change in the value \nof the option / portfolio with respect to passage of time, with all else remaining \nthe same. It is also called the \u201ctime decay\u201d of the option.  \nTrading Book  A trading book or portfolio refers to the book of financial instruments held for \nthe purpose of short -term trading, as opposed to securities that would be held \nas a long -term investment. The trading book refers to the assets that are held \nprimarily for generat ing profit on short -term differences in prices/yields. The \nprice risk is the prime concern of banks in trading book.  \nUnderwrite  Generally, to underwrite means to assume a risk for a fee. Its two most \ncommon contexts are: a) Securities: a dealer or inves tment bank agrees to \npurchase a new issue of securities from the issuer and distribute these \nsecurities to investors. The underwriter may be one person or part of an \nunderwriting syndicate.

R. Gadgil (Gadgil Study Group) on the Organizational  Framework \nfor the Implementation of the S ocial Objectives, which submitted its report in Octob er \n1969. The Study Group drew attention to the fact that commercial banks did not have \nadequate presence in rural areas and also lacked the required rural orientation. The \nStudy Group, therefore, recommended the adoption of an 'Area Approach' to evolve \nplans and programmes for the development of an adequate banking and credit \nstructure in the rural areas.  \n(ii)  A Committee of Bankers on Branch Expansion Programme of Public Sector Banks \nappointed by the Reserve Bank of India under the Chairmanship of Shri F . K. F. \nNariman (Nariman Committee) endorsed the idea of an \u2018A rea Approach \u2019 in its report \n(November 1969) , recommend ing that in order to enable the Public Sector Banks to \ndischarge their social responsibilities, each bank should concentrate on certain \ndistricts where it should act as a 'Lead Bank'.       \n(iii)  Pursuant to the above recommendations, the Lead Bank Scheme was introduced \nby the Reserve Bank of India in December 1969. The Scheme aims at coordinating the \nactivities of banks and other developmenta l agencies through various fora in order to \nachieve the objective of enhancing the flow of bank finance to  the priority sector and \nother sectors and to promote banks ' role in the overall development of the rural sector. \nFor coordinating the activities in t he district, a particular bank is assigned \u2018Lead Bank\u2019 \nresponsibility of the district. The Lead Bank is expected to assume a leadership role \nfor coordinating the efforts of the credit institutions and the Government.    \n(iv)  In view of the several changes  that had taken place  in the financial sector, the \nLead Bank Scheme was last reviewed by the High Level Committee  headed by Smt . \nUsha Thorat,  former  Deputy Governor  of the Reserve Bank of India in 2009 .  \n(v)  The High Level Committee  held wide ranging disc ussions with various \nstakeholders viz. State Governments, banks, development institutions, academicians, \nNGOs, MFIs etc. and noted that the Scheme has been useful in achieving its original \nobjectives of improvement in branch expansion, deposit mobilisation  and lending to \nthe priority sector, especially in rural/semi urban areas. There was overwhelming 5 \n \nconsensus that the Scheme needs to continue. Based  on the recommendations of the \nCommittee, the guidelines were issued to SLBC Convenor  banks  and Lead B anks f or \nimplementation.  \n \n(vi) Envisaging greater role for private sector banks, Lead Banks were advised to \nensure that private sector banks are more closely and actively involved in the \nimplementation of the L ead Bank Scheme , by leveraging on Information Techno logy \nand bringing in their expertise in strategic planning. They were also advised to involve \nthemselves  in the preparation as well as implementation of the District Credit \nPlan(DCP) .  \n(vii)  Further,  Reserve Bank of India constituted a \u201cCommittee of Execu tive Directors\u201d \nof the Bank to study the efficacy of the Scheme and suggest measures for its \nimprovement. Based on the Committee\u2019s recommendations and feedback received \nfrom various stakeholders, certain \u2018action points\u2019 were issued to SLBC \nConvenors/Lead B anks and NABARD on April 6, 2018.  \n \n2.  Fora under Lead Bank Scheme  \n2.1 Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC)  \nBlock Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) is a forum for achieving coordination between \ncredit institutions and field level development agencies at the  block level . The forum \nprepares and reviews  the implementation of the Block Credit Plan and also resolves \noperational problems in the implementation of the credit programmes of banks. The \nLead District Manager (LDM) of the district is the Chairman of the Block Level Bankers\u2019 \nCommittee. All the banks operat ing in the block including the Small Finance Banks , \nWholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks , RRBs, the D istrict Central Co-\noperative Banks , Block Development Officer, technical officers in the bl ock, such as \nextension officers for agriculture, industries and co -operatives are members of the \nCommittee. BLBC meetings are held at quarterly intervals. To  strengthen the BLBC \nforum which operates at the base level of the Lead Bank Scheme, it is necessar y that \nall branch managers attend BLBC meetings and enrich the discussions with their \nvaluable inputs. Controlling Heads of banks may also attend a few of the BLBC \nmeetings selectively. Participation by the District Development Manager (DDM) of \nNABARD in B LBCs would ensure better and more meaningful discussions for the \ndevelopment of the Block. Therefore, NABARD has been advised that  DDMs should  6 \n \nattend all Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee meetings in their district s and actively \nparticipate in the credit plan ning exercise and review meetings at the block level.  The \nLead District Officer ( LDO) of the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI) selectively attend s the \nBLBC meetings. The representatives of Panchayat Samitis are also invited to attend \nthe meetings at half yearly  intervals so as to share their knowledge and experience on \nrural development in the credit planning exercise. Payments Banks should also be \ninvited to attend the meetings.  \n \n2.2 District Consultative Committee (DCC)  \n  \n2.2.1 Constitution of DCC  \nThe District  Consultative Committees  were constituted in the early seventies  as a \ncommon forum at the district level for bankers as well as Government \nagencies/departments to facilitate  coordination in implementing various \ndevelopmental activities under the Lead Bank Scheme. The  District Collector is the \nChairman of the DCC meetings. Reserve Bank of India, NABARD, all the commercial \nbanks including Small Finance Banks , Wholly  Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign \nBanks, RRBs, Payments Banks,  Co-operative banks including the District Central \nCooperative Bank (DCCB),  various State Government departments and allied \nagencies are the members of the DCC.  The Lead District Officer (LDO) represents the \nReserve Bank as a member of the DCC.  The Lead District Manager (LDM) convenes \nthe DCC meetings. The Director of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises \nDevelopment Institute (MSME -DI) in the district is an invitee in districts where MSME \nclusters are located to discuss issues concerning MSMEs.  \n2.2.2 Conduct of DCC Meetings  \n \ni) DCC meetin gs should be convened by the Lead Banks at quarterly intervals.  \nii) At the DCC level, sub -committees as appropriate , may be set up to work intensively \non specific issues and submit reports to the DCC for its consideration.  \niii) DCC should give adequate feedback to the SLBC on various issues that need to \nbe discussed on a wider platform, so that these receive adequate attention at the \nState Level.  \n \n \n 7 \n \n \n2.2.3 Agenda for DCC Meetings  \n \nWhile Lead Banks are expected to address the problems particular to the concerned \ndistricts, some of the important areas which are common to all districts which the lead \nbanks should invariably discuss in the fora are as under:  \ni) Review of progress under Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP).  \nii) The specific issues inhibiting and enabling IT enabled  financial inclusion  \niii) Issues  to facilitate 'enablers' and remove/ minimise  'impeders' for banking \ndevelopment for inclusive growth  \niv) Monitoring initiatives for providing 'Credit Plus' activities by banks and State \nGovernments such as setting up of Financial Literacy Centres  (FLCs) and \nRSETI# type Training Institutes for providing skills and capacity building to \nmanage businesses.  \nv) Scaling up financial literacy efforts to achieve financial inclusion.  \nvi) Review of performance of banks under District Credit Plan ( DCP)  \nvii) Flow  of credit to priority sector and weaker sections of the society  \nviii) Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022  \nix) Assistance under Government sponsored schemes  \nx) Grant of educational loans  \nxi) Progress under SHG - bank linkage  \nxii) SME financing & bottlenecks thereo f, if any  \nxiii) Timely submission of data by banks  \nxiv) Review of relief measures (in case of natural calamities wherever applicable)  \nThe above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. The Lead Banks may include any \nother agenda item considered necessary.  \n \n# Rura l Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) should be more actively involved \nand monitored at various fora of LBS particularly at the DCC level. Focus should be \non development of skills to enhance the credit absorption capacity in the area and \nrenewing the training programmes towards sustainable micro enterprises. RSETIs \nshould design specific programmes for each district/ block, keeping in view the skill \nmapping and the potential of the region for necessary  skill training  and skill up \ngradation  of the rural youth  in the district.  \n 8 \n \n \n \n2.2.4 Role of LDMs  \n \nAs the effectiveness of the Lead Bank Scheme depends on the dynamism of the \nDistrict Collectors and the Lead District Managers (LDMs), with the support of the \nRegional/Zonal Office, the office of LDM shou ld be sufficiently strengthened with \nappropriate infrastructural support. Apart from the provision of a separate office space, \ntechnical infrastructure like computers, printer, data connectivity, etc. which are basic \nnecessities for LDMs to discharge their  core responsibilities may be provided to LDMs\u2019 \nOffice without exception.  Officers of appropriate level , attitude and possessing \nrequisite leadership skills should be posted as LDMs. Additionally, it is suggested that \na dedicated vehicle may be provided t o LDMs\u2019 to facilitate closer liaison with the bank \nofficials, district administration officials as also to organise/ attend various financial \nliteracy initiatives and meetings. The absence of a specialist officer/assistant for data \nentry/analysis is a comm on and major  issue faced by LDMs. Liberty to hire the services \nof skilled computer operator may be given to the LDMs to overcome the shortage of \nstaff/ in case appropriate staff is not posted at LDM office.   Further, for successful \nfunctioning of the Lead Bank Scheme, we expect Lead Banks to go the extra mile to \nprovide facilities over and above the bare minimum to these critical field functionaries. \nApart from the usual role of LDMs like convening meetings of the DCC/DLRC and \nperiodical meetings of DDM/  LDO/ Government officials for resolving outstanding \nissues etc., the new functions envisaged for LDMs include the following:  \ni) Monitoring the implementation of the D istrict Credit Plan  \nii) Associate with the setting up of Financial Lit eracy Centres (FLCs), RSETI s by \nbanks  \niii) Associate with organizing financial literacy camps by FLCs and rural branches \nof banks.  \niv) Holding annual sensitisation workshops for banks and Government officials \nwith participation by NGOs/Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) . \nv) Arranging for quart erly awareness and feedback public meetings, grievance \nredressal etc.  \n \n \n 9 \n \n2.2.5 Quarterly Public Meeting and Grievance Redressal  \nThe Lead District Manager should convene a quarterly public meeting at various \nlocations in the district in coordination with the LDO of Reserve Bank, banks having \npresence in the area and other stakeholders to generate awareness of the various \nbanking policies and regulations relating to the common person, obtain feedback from \nthe public and provide grievance redressal to the ex tent possible at such meetings or \nfacilitate approaching the appropriate machinery for such redressal.  \n \n2.2.6 District Level Review Committee (DLRC) Meetings  \nDLRC meetings are chaired by the District Collector and attended by members of the \nDistrict Consu ltative Committee (DCC).  Public R epresentatives i.e. Local  MPs/MLAs/ \nZilla Parishad Chiefs are also invited to these meetings.  The DLRC meetings should \nbe convened by the Lead Banks at  least once in a quarter.  The DLRC is a forum to \nreview the pace and qua lity of the implementation of various programmes under the \nLead Bank Scheme in the district . Hence , association of non -officials is considered \nuseful. Public representatives (MPs/ ML As / Zilla Panchayat Chiefs) shall invariably \nbe invited to DL RC meetings . Therefore, L ead B anks should fix the date of DLRC \nmeetings with due regard to the convenience of the representatives of the public i.e. \nMPs/MLAs etc. , to invite and involve them in all functions conducted by the banks in \ntheir districts, such as opening o f new banking outlets , distribution of Kisan Credit \nCards, SHG credit linkage programmes , etc. Responses to queries from public \nrepresentatives need to be accorded highest priority and attended to promptly. The \nforum may also have representatives of State Minority Commission, SC/ST  \nCorporation and representative s of the group of beneficiaries of rural lending. The \nforum may also consider inviting people with the expertise in the fields, such as \nprogressive farmers and local industrialists as special invitee s. The follow up of the \nDLRC\u2019s decisions is required to be discussed in the DCC meetings.   \nA compendium of instructions outlining the salient features of DLRC forum is given at  \nAnnex  V. \n2.2.7 DCC/DLRC meetings - Annual Calendar of  Meetings  \ni) DCC and DLRC are the important fora facilitating coordination among commercial \nbanks, Government agencies and others at the district level to review and find \nsolutions to the problems hindering developmental activities. Therefore, it is necess ary \nthat all the members participate and deliberate in the se meetings. On a review of the 10 \n \nDCC/DLRC meetings, it was observed that late receipt/non -receipt of intimation of the \ndate of meetings, clash of dates with other events, commonality of dates etc. , hinder \nparticipation of members in these meetings, thus undermining the prime objective of \nconducting the above meetings.  \nii)   Lead Banks have, therefore, been advised to prepare  an Annual S chedule of DCC \nand DLRC meetings on Calendar year basis for all d istricts in consultation with the \nChairperson of the meetings, Lead District Officer of the RBI and Public \nRepresentatives in case of DLRC.  This yearly Calendar should be prepared in the \nbeginning of each year and circulated to all members as advance inti mation for \nblocking future dates to attend the DCC and DLRC meetings and the meetings should \nbe conducted as per the calendar.  While preparing the calendar , it should be ensured  \nthat DCC and DLRC meetings are not held simultaneously.  Lead Banks must fix d ates \nof DLRC meetings taking into account the convenience of the MPs and circulate the \nagenda papers to MPs well in advance.  \n \n2.3 State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)  \n  \n2.3.1 Constitution of SLBC  \n i) The State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) was constitut ed in April 1977, as an \napex inter -institutional forum to create adequate coordination machinery in all States, \non a uniform basis for development of the State. SLBC is chaired by the Chairman/ \nManaging Director / Executive Director of the C onvenor Bank. It comprises \nrepresentatives of commercial banks  including Small Finance Banks , Wholly Owned \nSubsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks, RRBs,  Payments Banks,  State Cooperative \nBanks, RBI, NABARD, heads of Government departments including representatives \nfrom Natio nal Commission for Scheduled Castes/Tribes, National Horticulture Board, \nKhadi & Village Industries Commission etc. and representatives of financial institutions \noperating in a State, who come together and sort out coordination problems at the \npolicy imple mentation level.  Representatives of various organizations from different \nsectors of the economy like industry bodies, retail traders, exporters , farmers\u2019 union s, \netc. are special invitees in the SLBC meetings for discussing their specific problems, \nif any . SLBC meetings are held on quarterly basis. The responsibility for convening \nthe SLBC meetings would be of the SLBC Convenor Bank of the State.  \n 11 \n \nii) Recognising that SLBCs, primarily as a committee of bankers at the State level , play \nan important role in  the development of the State, illustrative guidelines on the conduct \nof State Level Bankers \u2019 Committee meetings have been issued.  \n2.3.2 Conduct of SLBC Meetings  \ni)  SLBC meetings are required to be held regularly at quarterly intervals.  The \nmeetings are  chaired  by the Cha irman / Managing Director / Executive Director of the \nConvenor Bank and  co-chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary or Development \nCommissioner of the State concerned.  In cases  where  the Managing  Director/Chief  \nExecutive  Officer/Executiv e Director  of the SLBC  Convenor  Bank  is unable  to attend  \nSLBC  Meetings,  the Regional  Director  of the RBI shall co-chair  the meetings  along  \nwith the Additional  Chief  Secretary/Development  Commissioner  of the State  \nconcerned.  A High Level of participation in  SLBC/UTLBC meetings ensure s an \neffective and desired outcome with meaningful discussion on issues of public policy of \nboth the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India.  \nii)  The Chief Minister/Finance Minister and senior level officers of the St ate/RBI (of \nthe rank of Deputy Governor / Executive Director) may be invited to attend the SLBC \nmeetings.  Further, the State Chief Ministers are encouraged to attend at least one \nSLBC meeting in a year.  \n \niii)  State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee  meetings shoul d primarily focus on policy issues \nwith participation of only the senior functionaries of the banks/ Government \nDepartments.  All routine issues may be delegated to sub -committee(s) of the SLBC.  \nA Steering Sub -committee may be constituted in the SLBC to de liberate on agenda \nproposals from different stakeholders and finalise a compact agenda for the SLBC \nmeetings. Typically, the Sub -Committee could consist of SLBC Convenor, RBI & \nNABARD representatives & senior State Government representative from the \nconcer ned department, e.g. Finance/ Institutional Finance and two to three banks \nhaving major presence.  \n \niv) Other issue -specific sub -committees may be constituted as required.  The sub \ncommittees may examine the specific issues  relating to agriculture, micro, \nsmall/medium industries/enterprises, handloom finance, export promotion and \nfinancial inclusion, etc.  in-depth and devise solutions/recommendations for adoption \nby the full committee. They are  expected to meet more frequently than the SLBC. The 12 \n \ncomposition  of the sub -committee s and subjects/ specific issues impeding/enabling \nfinancial inclusion to be deliberated upon, may vary from State to State depending on \nthe specific problems/issues faced by the States.  \n \nv)   The secretariat/offices of the SLBC should  be sufficiently strengthened to enable \nthe SLBC Convenor Bank to effectively discharge its functions.  \n \nvi)  The various fora at lower levels may give adequate feedback to the SLBC on issues \nthat need to be discussed on a wider platform.  \n \nvii)   Several institutions and academicians are engaged in research , studies etc. that \nhave implications for sustainable development in agriculture and MSME sector. \nEngaging with such research institutions and academicians would be useful in bringing \nin new ideas for fu rthering the objectives of the Lead Bank Scheme. The SLBCs may, \ntherefore, identify such academicians and researchers and invite them as 'special \ninvitees' to attend SLBC meetings occasionally both for adding value to the \ndiscussion s and also associate the m with studies appropriate to the State. Other \n'special invitees' may be invited to attend SLBC meetings depending on the agenda \nitems/issues to be discussed in the meetings.  \n \nviii)  The activities of NGOs in facilitating and channelling  credit to the low  income \nhouseholds are expected to increase in the coming years. Several corporate houses \nare also engaged in corporate social responsibility activities for sustainable \ndevelopment. A linkage with such NGOs/Corporate houses operating in the area to \nensure that the NGOs/corporates provide the necessary 'credit plus' services can help \nleverage bank credit for inclusive growth. Success stories could be presented in SLBC \nmeetings to serve as models that could be replicated.  \n  \n2.3.3 Revised  Agenda for SLBC Meet ings \n \n1.

Any other item, w ith the permis sion of the Chair . \n \nThe above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. SLBC C onvenor Banks may include \nany other agenda item considered necessary.  \n \n2.3.4   SLBC - Yearly Calendar of Meetings  \n \ni)  To improve the effectiveness and streamlin e the functioning  of SLBC/UTLBC \nmeetings, SLBC Convenor  Banks have been advised to prepare a yearly calendar of \nprogramme s (calendar year basis) in the beginning of the year itself, for conducting \nthe meetings. The calendar of programme s should clearly specify the cut off dates for \ndata submission to SLBC and acceptance thereof by the SLBC Convenor. This yearly \ncalendar should be circulated to all the concerned as an advance intimation for \nblocking of future dates of senior functionaries of various agencies like Central \nGovernment , State Governments, banks, RBI, etc. The SLBC/UTLBC meetings \nshould be conducted as per the calendar under all circumstances. The agenda should \nalso be circulated in advance without waiting for the data from defaulting banks. The \nmatter should, how ever, be taken up with the defaulting banks in the SLBC meeting. \nIn addition, the SLBC Convenor  Bank should write a letter in this regard to the \ncontrolling office of the defaulting banks under advice to  the Regional Office of RBI. \nThe SLBC Convenor Bank w ill, however, continue to follow -up with banks for timely \ndata submission. Further, in case the Chief Minister, Finance Minister or other very \nsenior functionaries are not able to attend the SLBC on some very rare occasion, then \nif so desired by them, a sp ecial SLBC meeting can be held.  Following broad guidelines \nshould be used for preparation of the calendar of programmes:   \nActivity  To be completed by (Date)  \nPreparation of calendar of SLBC/UTLBC meetings \nand intimation to all the concerned of the cut -off \ndates for submission of data and dates of \nmeetings as per the dateline given below.  15th January  every year  \nReminder regarding the exact date of meeting and \nsubmission of data by banks to SLBC  15 days before end of the quarter  \nDead line for receipt of information/data by SLBC \nConvenor Bank 15 days from the end of the quarter  \nDistribution of agenda cum background papers  20 days from the end of the quarter  16 \n \nHolding of the meeting  \n Within 45 days from the end of the \nquarter  \nForwarding the minutes of the meeting to all \nstakeholders  Within 10 days from holding the \nmeeting  \nFollow -up of the action points emerged from the \nmeeting  To be completed within 30 days of \nforwarding the minutes (for review in \nthe next meeting)  \n      \nii)   The objective of preparing the calendar of meetings in the beginning of the year is \nto ensure adequate notice of these meetings and timely compilation and dispatch of \nagenda papers to all stakeholders. It also ensures clear cut guidelines for the \nsubmission of data to SLBC C onvenors by participating banks & Government \nDepartments. It is expected to save precious time of SLBC Convenors otherwise spent \nin taking dates from various senior functionaries attending these SLBC meetings.  \niii)  SLBC Convenor Banks  need to appreciate the advan tages of ensuring adherence \nto the yearly calendars.  SLBC Convenor Banks have therefore been advised to give \nwide publicity to the annual calendar at the beginning of the year and ensure that dates \nof senior functionaries expected to attend the meetings a re blocked for all meetings \nby their offices.  In case, despite blocking dates, if for some reason, the senior \nfunctionary is not able to attend the meeting, the meeting should be held as planned \nin the calendar.  More importantly, the data for review in t hese meetings should be \nreceived as per deadlines set in the calendar and those who do not submit the data in \ntime should be asked to explain the reasons for delay in sending the data that may be \nrecorded in the minutes of the meeting. Under no circumstanc e, should the preparation \nof the agenda  be delayed beyond the dates stipulated as per the calendar.  \n \n2.3.5 SLBC Website \u2013 Standardisation of information /data  \n \nSLBC Convenor  Banks are required to maintain the SLBC websites where all \ninstructions pertaining  to LBS and Government Sponsored Schemes are made \navailable and are accessible to the common man desiring any information relating to \nthe conduct of meetings or State -wise data/ bank-wise performance. In order to \nstandardize the information and data that is  to be made available on the SLBC website, \nan indicative list of the information & data is given in the Annex II .  SLBCs should \narrange to place the prescribed minimum information on the websites of SLBCs of \ntheir bank and keep i t updated regularly, at least on quarterly basis. Banks may note 17 \n \nthat the list is only indicative and SLBCs are free to put any additional information \nconsidered relevant for the State.  \n \n2.3.6 Liaison with State Government  \n \nSLBC Convenor  Banks are expect ed to co -ordinate the activities of all banks in the \nState, discuss with State Government officials , the operational problems in lending, \nextending necessary support for  banking development and to achieve the objective of \nfinancial inclusion.  \n2.3.7 Capacit y Building/Training/Sensitization Programmes  \n \ni) There is a need for sensitising the District Collectors and CEOs of Zilla Parishads \non banks and banking in general as also on the specific scope and role of the Lead \nBank Scheme. In each State, a full day \u2018Sensitisation W orkshop \u2019 may be convened by \nthe SLBC Convenor  Bank every year , preferably in April/May . Such sensitisation \nshould form part of the probationary training of such officers. Further, as soon as they \nare posted in a district, the SLBC may arran ge for exposure visits for the District \nCollectors to the SLBC Convenor\u2019s office for sensitisation and understanding of the \nLead Bank Scheme.  \n \nii) Staff at the operational level of banks and government agencies associated with \nimplementation of the Lead B ank Scheme need to be aware of the latest \ndevelopments and emerging opportunities. There is need for staff sensitisation/ \ntraining/seminars, etc. at periodic intervals on an ongoing basis . \n \n3. Implementation of Lead Bank Scheme  \n3.1 Preparation of credit p lans \nPlanning plays an important role in the implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme and \na bottom -up approach is adopted to map the existing potential for development.  Under \nLBS, planning starts with identifying block -wise/  activity -wise potential estimate d for \nvarious sectors.  \n \n 18 \n \n3.2 Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs)  \ni) Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) are a step towards decentralized credit \nplanning with the basic objective of mapping the existing potential for development \nthrough bank credit. PLPs ta ke into account the long term physical potential, \navailability of infrastructure support, marketing facilities, and policies/programmes of \nGovernment etc.  NABARD to take measures  to ensure that PLPs should be  more \nfocussed and implementable so that banks can utilize them  more gainfully while \npreparing the Branch Credit Plan. PLPs should emphasise on promotion of \nsustainable agricultural practices suitable to local conditions. While preparing the \nPLPs, the focus must be on identifying processes and projects  that:  \na. reduce the carbon foot -print,  \nb. prevent the overuse of fertilizers,  \nc. ensure efficient utilisation of water and  \nd. address agricultural pollution issues.  \n \nThe plans must also focus on promoting innovative farming systems such as organic \nfarming, bio dyna mic farming, permaculture and sustainable small -scale  farming, as \nalso promoting Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs)  and Farmers\u2019 Markets. Such \ninitiatives must be supported by appropriate investments and project finance \nframeworks.  \n \nii) A pre -PLP meeting  is convened by LDM during June every year to be attended by \nbanks, Government agencies, etc., to reflect their views and concerns regarding credit \npotential (sector/activity -wise) and deliberate on major financial and socio -economic \ndevelopments in the di strict in the last one year and priorities to be set out for inclusion \nin the PLP.  The DDM of NABARD make s a presentation in this meeting outlining the \nmajor requirements of information for preparing the PLP for the following year. The \npreparation of PLP f or the next year is to be completed by August every year to enable \nthe State Government to factor in the PLP projections.   \niii) The procedure for preparing the District Credit Plan is as follows:  \na) Controlling Offices of commercial banks  including Small Fin ance Banks , Wholly \nOwned Subsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks  and Head Office of RRB and \nDCCB/LDB circulate the accepted block -wise/activity -wise potential to all their 19 \n \nbranches for preparing the Branch Credit Plans (BCP) by their respective \nbranch managers .  Banks should ensure that the exercise of preparation of \nbranch/block plans is completed in time by all branches so that the Credit Plans \nbecome operational on time.  \nb) A special Block Level Bankers' Committee (BLBC) meeting is convened for \neach block where  the Branch Credit Plans are discussed and aggregated to \nform the Block Credit Plan.  The DDM and the LDM guide the BLBC in finalizing \nthe plan , ensuring that the Block Credit Plan is in tune with the potentials \nidentified activity -wise including in respec t of Government Sponsored \nSchemes .   \nc) All the Block Credit Plans of the district are aggregated by the LDM to form the \nDistrict Credit Plan  (DCP) . This plan indicates an analytical assessment of the \ncredit need s of the district to be deployed by all the fin ancial institutions \noperating in the district and the total quantum of funds to be earmarked as credit \nby all the financial institutions for a new financial year.  The Zonal/Controlling \nOffices of banks, while finalizing their business plans for the year, s hould take \ninto account the commitments made in the DCP which should be ready well in \ntime before the performance budgets are finalized.   \nd) The District Credit Plan is then  placed before the DCC by the Lead District \nManager for final acceptance/approval.  A ll the District Credit Plans are \neventually aggregated into a State Level Credit Plan to be prepared by SLBC \nConvenor B ank and launched by the 1st of April every year.   \ne) The corporate business targets for branches, blocks, districts and states may \nbe align ed with the Annual Credit Plans (ACP) to ensure better implementation. \nThe Controlling Offices of the banks in each state should synchronize their \ninternal business plans with the ACP.  \n3.3   Monitoring the Performance of C redit Plans \nThe performance of the  credit plans is reviewed in the v arious fora created under the \nLead Bank Scheme as shown below:  \nAt Block Level  Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC)  \nAt District Level  District Consultative Committee (DCC) & District \nLevel Review Committee (DLRC)  \nAt Stat e Level  State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)  20 \n \n                                                        \nMonitoring of LBS by RBI - Monitoring Information System (MIS)  \ni)  Data on Annual Credit Plan (ACP)  is an important element to review the flow of \ncredit  in the State.  ACP formats are aligned with  the extant reporting guidelines on \npriority sector lending. Accordingly, the ACP is to be prepared considering the \ncategories of priority sector that would include Agriculture, Micro, Small and Medium \nEnterprise s, Export Credit, Education,  Housing, Social Infrastructure, Renewable \nEnergy and Others.  Further, it has been decided that bank loans to Micro/Small and \nMedium Enterprises (Services), engaged in providing or rendering of services as \ndefined in terms of i nvestment in equipment under MSMED Act, 2006, shall qualify \nunder priority sector without any credit cap.  With a view to simplify the MIS Statements, \nit had been decided that t he quarterly statement on progress under ACP may be \nprepared in an all -inclusive  single format - MIS ( Annex IV ) containing data on ( a) ACP targets \n(b) ACP achievements/ disbursements and ( c) ACP sector/ sub -sector wise loan amount \noutstanding, for all categories of LBS fora member banks viz. Public Sector Ba nks, Private \nSector Banks, Regional Rural Banks, Small Finance Banks and Rural Cooperative Banks \n(StCBs and DCCBs ). The bank group wise statement s as per the prescribed format \nshould be prepared and the same to be place d for meaningful review in all DCC an d \nSLBC meetings.  \nii)  In order to maintain consistency and integrity of data with the All-India data of \nscheduled commercial banks and facilitate a meaningful review/analysis of data, the \nACP data needs to be grouped separately for scheduled commercial ba nks and other \nbanks like State Cooperative B anks , DCCBs , etc. while presenting in the DCC/SLBC \nmeetings and submitting to our Regional Offices.  The data pertaining to  scheduled \ncommercial banks needs to be further grouped into public sector banks, private  sector \nbanks , Regional Rural Banks , Small Finance Banks  and Whol ly Owned Subsidiaries \n(WOS) of F oreign Banks  to know the bank group wise position.   \n3.4   Revised mechanism of Data Flow for LBS fora meetings  \n \nAt present, discussions at the q uarterly meetings of the various LBS fora viz. State \nLevel Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC), District level Consultative Committee (DCC) and \nBlock  Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) primarily focus on the performance of banks \nin the disbursement of loans vis -a-vis the allocated t arget under the Annual Credit \nPlan. The integrity & timeliness of the data submitted by banks for the purpose has 21 \n \nbeen an issue as a significant portion of this data is manually compiled and entered \ninto the Data Management Systems of the SLBC Convenor  Banks. The extent to which \nthis data corresponds with the data present in the Core Banking Solution ( CBS) of the \nrespective banks also varies significantly. Therefore, there is need of a standardized \nsystem to be developed on the website maintained by each SL BC to enable uploading \nand downloading of the data pertaining to the Block, District as well as the State. The \nrelevant data must also be directly downloadable from the CBS and/ or MIS of the \nbanks with a view to keeping manual intervention to a minimal le vel in the process. \nThe procedure relating to the envisaged intervention in this area is given below : \nManagement of Data Flow at LBS Fora \u2013 Procedure  \ni. Each bank\u2019s CBS should have a provision to generate a report pertaining to all LBS \nrelated data/ tables to  Excel. This data should have information pertaining to all the \nbranches operating in the state including fields/ columns for District & Block name. \nAccess to Download & Export this data from the bank \u2019s CBS should be given to \nthe Controlling Offices of the  banks who would be solely responsible for the \nprocess of \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 for all districts/ blocks within their jurisdiction.  \n  \nii. The \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 process is the process of uploading this Excel file (downloaded \nin step (i) above) on the SLBC websites. SLBC  websites should have a provision \nto \u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 all the data present in the Excel Sheet on the database of the \nSLBC website. This would obviate any manual \u2018data entry\u2019 at the SLBC/ Controlling \nOffice level.  \n  \niii. To facilitate the above functionality, ea ch SLBC Convenor Bank would have to add \nthis \u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 functionality to their SLBC website along with the requisite \ncapabilities at the back -end. \n \niv. The SLBC website would, thus, effectively work as a data aggregation platform. \nFurther, data analysis capabilities could also be added to the SLBC websites \ndepending on the available resources.  \n \nv. The SLBC websites should provide access to LDMs to download district and block \nspecific data directly from this website thus ensuring integrity and timely availab ility \nof data.  \n 22 \n \nvi. There could still be some data pertaining to State Government Schemes/ other \ndata that is not available on the CBS or MIS of the banks. This would have to be \ncollated at the Controlling Office level as is done now. At the SLBC website, \nfunctionalities could be provided to enter this data too. This could then be \ndownloaded by the LDMs for district/ block level reports. Banks may also add Open \nFormat fields like \u2018text boxes\u2019 for data or information that is special or is entered/ \nused once in a  while.   \n \nvii. Such a system ensures that LDMs & SLBC Convenor Banks have to do zero or \nminimal data entry/ feeding and all data is entered by a single \u2018custodian of data\u2019 \nwhich is the Controlling Office of each bank. Any information to be provided by \nGovernme nt extension agencies could also be similarly uploaded.  \nNecessary modifications may be made on the SLBC websites and to the CBS & MIS \nsystems of all banks to implement the envisaged data flow mechanism . \n \nA Working Group of select SLBC Convenor banks and NA BARD was constituted by \nRBI to work out a standardised system for collection, storage, presentation and \nmanagement of data on the SLBC/ UTLBC website. A Standard Operating Procedure \n(SOP), which may be followed by SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks, member banks a nd \nLDMs , as suggested by the Working Group for management of the data flow  is given \nat Annex III . \n \n4.   Assignment of Lead Bank Responsibility  \n \ni) Lead Bank Scheme is administered by the Reserve Bank of India since 1969. The \nassignment of Lead Bank responsibility to designated banks in every district is done \nby the Reserve Bank of India following a detailed procedure formulated for this \npurpose. As on March 31, 202 2, 12 public sector banks and one private sector bank \nhave been ass igned Lead Bank responsibility in 7 34 districts of the country.  \nii) State Level Bankers \u2019 Committee  (SLBC )/Union Territory Level Bankers' Committee \n(UTLBC) , as an apex level for um at the State /Union Territory (UT)  level, coordinates \nthe activities of the fi nancial institutions  and Government departments in the \nState/Union Territory under  the Lead Bank Scheme . SLBC /UTLBC  Convenorship is \nassigned to banks for this purpose . As on March 31, 202 2, the SLBC/ UTLBC \nconvenorship of 2 8 States and 8 Union Territories has been assigned to 11 public 23 \n \nsector banks and one private sector bank. A List of State /UT wise SLBC /UTLBC  \nConvenor  Banks  and district  wise Lead Banks is given  in Annex  I. \niii) The Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) has been  extended to the districts in the metropolitan  \nareas , thus bringing the entire country under the fold of the Lead Bank Scheme.  \n \n5.   Banking Penetration  \ni)  Over the years, the focus of the Lead Bank Scheme has shifted to inclusive growth \nand financial inclusion. The use  of Information Technology (IT) and intermediaries has \nenabled banks to increase the outreach, scale and depth of banking services at \naffordable cost.   \nii)   SLBC Convenor B anks / Lead Banks are advised to focus attention on the need \nfor achieving 100% fi nancial inclusion through penetration of banking services in the \nrural areas. Upon issuance of D oR revised guidelines on \u2018Rationalisation of Branch \nAuthorisation Policy\u2019 on May 18, 2017 clarifying on  \u2018Banking Outlet \u2019, banks were \nadvised to consider opening  of a CBS -enabled banking outlet or a part time banking \noutlet , as the case may be , in unbanked rural centres.  \niii)  SLBC Convenor Banks should take up with the State Governments / other \nGovernment  departments  concerned , impeders such as issues of road/dig ital \nconnectivity, conducive law and order situation, uninterrupted power supply, adequate  \nsecurity , etc. for ensuring banking expansion at all centres where penetration by the \nformal banking system is required. However, these impeders should not inhibit t he \nscaling up of financial inclusion initiatives.  \n \n5.1   Roadmap for providing banking services in unbanked villages  \nIn November 2009, a roadmap to provide  banking services in villages with population \nmore than 2000 was rolled out .  All the identified vil lages have been provided with \nbanking services through branches, business correspondents or through other modes \nsuch as ATMs and mobile vans. Later, in June 2012, a  roadmap to provide banking \nservices in unbanked villages with less than 2,000 population  was rolled out . SLBC \nConvenor Banks and Lead Banks were advised to complete the process of providing \nbanking services in unbanked villages with population below 2000 by August 14, 2015.  \n 24 \n \n \n \n5.2 Roadmap for opening brick and mortar branches in villages with po pulation \nmore than 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial bank  \nAs brick and mortar branches are an integral component  of financial inclusion, it was \ndecided to focus on villages with population above 5000 without a bank branch  of a \nscheduled commercial bank. This was to  enable banks to provide quality financial \nservices and timely support to BC outlets that would help in sustaining and \nstrengthening the services provided through BCs and also ensur ing close supervision \nof BC operations. Accordi ngly, SLBC Convenor Banks were advised to identify villages \nwith population above 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial bank in \ntheir State  and allot these villages among scheduled commercial banks (including \nRegional Rural Banks) for openin g of branches.   \n \n5.3   Aligning roadmap for unbanked villages having population more than 5000 \nwith revised Guidelines on Branch Authorisation Policy  \n \nIn terms of circular DBR.  No. BAPD. BC. 69/22.01.001/2016 -17 dated May 18, 2017 \nissued by D oR on \u2018Ratio nalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy - Revision of \nGuidelines \u2019, final  guidelines on \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 have been issued with a view to \nfacilitate financial  inclusion as also to provide flexibility to  banks on  the choice of \ndelivery channel.  Accordingl y, SLBC Convenor Banks have been  advised to identify \nall unbanked rural centres (URCs) in the State , compile and maintain an updated list \nof all such centres.  The updated list should be displayed on the website of each SLBC \nto facilitate banks to choose/in dicate the place/centre where they wish to open a \n\u2018banking outlet\u2019.  \n \nii)   Further, SLBC Convenor Banks have been advised that in order to comply with \nthe criteria of opening at least 25 percent of the total banking outlets in unbanked rural \ncentres in Tie r 5 & 6  centres , as  prescribed  vide D oR  circular dated May 18, 2017,  \nbanks should give priority to villages without a banking outlet having population \nmore than 5000 (i.e. Tier 5 centres) and ensure that all such villages under their \njurisdiction are covered with a CBS-enabled Banking Outlet on priority basis.  \n 25 \n \niii)  The updated list of unbanked rural centres should be tabled in all SLBC meetings \nduring discussions on the progress of providing banking services in unbanked rural \ncentres.  \n  \n5.4 National  Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI): 2019 -2024 \u2013 Universal \nAccess to Financial Services  \n \nProviding banking access to  every village  within a 5 KM radius / hamlet of 500 \nhouseholds in hilly areas has been  one of the key objective s of the National Strate gy \nfor Financial Inclusion (NSFI): 2019 -2024 . Accordingly, SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor \nbanks have been  advised to review the presence of banking outlets of Scheduled \nCommercial Banks (SCBs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Small Finance Banks \n(SFBs) and Payments Ban ks (PBs) in every village within a 5 KM radius / hamlet of \n500 households in hilly areas under their jurisdiction(s) and ensure that universal \naccess to financial services  are provided to all such villages.  \n \n6. Credit Deposit Ratio ( CD Ratio)  \n \n6.1   CD R atio of Banks in Rural and Semi -Urban Areas  \n \nBanks have been advised to achieve a CD Ratio of 60  percent  in respect of their rural \nand semi -urban branches separately on  an A ll-India basis. While it is not necessary \nthat this ratio should be achieved separate ly, branch -wise, district -wise or region -wise, \nthe banks should , nevertheless, ensure that wide disparity in the ratios between \ndifferent States / Regions is avoided in order to minimise regional imbalance in credit \ndeployment. The credit dispensation in c ertain districts is very low, as a result of \nvarious factors such as lack of necessary infrastructure, varying ability of different \nregions to absorb credit, etc. Banks may review the performance of their bank \nbranches in such areas and take necessary step s to augment the credit flow. The Lead \nBanks may discuss the problem in all its aspects with the other financial institutions in \nthe district and also in the DCC forum.  \n \n6.2    Implementation of the Recommendations of the Expert Group on CD \nRatio  \n \ni)   An Expert Group was constituted by the Government of India to go into the nature \nand magnitude of the problem of low CD Ratio across States / Regions and to suggest \nsteps to overcome the problem. The Expert Group examined the problems and causes 26 \n \nof low CD  Ratio and made recommendations . As per the recommendations, the CD \nRatio of banks should be monitored at different levels based on  the following \nparameters \u2013 \nInstitution / Level  Indicator  \nIndividual Banks at Head Office  Cu + RIDF  \nState Level (SLBC)  Cu + RI DF \nDistrict Level  Cs# \n \nWhere:  \n \nCu = Credit as per place of Utilization  \nCs# = Credit as per place of Sanction  \nRIDF = Total Resource support provided to States under RIDF  \n \n# In case of credit proposals, received at district level but not sanctionable ther eat due \nto limitations of the sanctioning power, sanctioned at bank\u2019s Head office/ controlling \noffices and the loan utilised / disbursed in districts through branches, are treated as \nthe loan sanctioned and utilised at district level. Hence , it may be cons idered at district \nlevel for computing CD ratio.  \n \nAs regards calculation of CD ratio on the basis of limit sanctioned/ amount outstanding, \nit is clarified that the CD ratio may be calculated on the basis of amount outstanding.  \n \nFurther, banks are advised t hat:  \n \nIn the districts having CD Ratio less than 40  percent , Special Sub -Committees (SSCs) \nof the DCC shall be set up to monitor the CD Ratio. \n\uf0b7 Districts having CD  Ratio between 40 and 60  percent , shall be monitored under \nthe existing system by the DCC, an d \n\uf0b7 The district with CD Ratio of less than 20  percent  need to be treated on a special \nfooting.  \n \nii) Special Sub -Committee s (SSCs) of the DCC should be set up in the districts having \nCD Ratio less than 40  percent , in order to monitor the CD  Ratio and to draw  up \nMonitorable Action Plans (MAPs) to increase the CD Ratio. The Lead District Manager \n(LDM) is designated as the Convenor of the SSC which , in addition to the District Co-\nordinators of banks functioning in the area, should  comprise of the LDO of RBI, the \nDDM of NABARD, the District Planning Officer or a representative of the Collector duly \nempowered to take decisions on behalf of the district administration.  \n 27 \n \nThe functions of the Special Sub -Committee are as under:  \n\uf0b7 The SSCs should draw  up Monitorable Acti on Plans (MAPs) for improving the \nCD Ratio in their districts on a self -set graduated basis.  \n\uf0b7 For this purpose , the SSC should  hold a special meeting immediately after its \nconstitution and on the basis of the various ground level parameters, set for \nitself, a target for increasing the CD Ratio initially for the current year. It will \nalso, at the same meeting, set a definite time frame to achieve a CD Ratio  more \nthan 60 percent  in annual increments.  \n\uf0b7 Consequent to the completion of this process, the target and  time frame self-\nset by the SSC should  be placed before the DCC for approval.  \n\uf0b7 The plans for implementation must then be taken up by the SSC and monitor ed \nassiduously once  in two months.  \n\uf0b7 The SSC should report  the progress on the implementation of the plan to the \nDCC on a quarterly basis and through them to the  Convenor of the SLBC.  \n\uf0b7 On the basis of the feedback received from the DCC regarding the progress in \nthe implementation of the Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs), a consolidated \nreport should be  prepared by the SSC and tabled at all SLBC meetings for \ndiscussion / information.  \niii)  As regards the districts with a CD Ratio less than 20  percent , these are generally \nlocated in hilly, desert  or inaccessible  terrains and / or those dependent solely on the \nprimary  sector and/ or characterized by a breakdown of the law and order machinery. \nIn such areas, conventional methods are not likely to work unless the banking system \nand the State Government come together in a specially meaningful way.  \n \niv) While the framework  for implementation for raising the CD Ratio in these districts \nwill be the same as in the case of districts with CD Ratio below 40 percent (i.e. setting \nup of SSC etc.), the focus of attention and the level of efforts sh ould be of a much \nhigher scale.  \nFor this,  \n\uf0b7 All such districts should first be placed in a special category.  \n\uf0b7 Thereafter, the responsibility for increasing their CD Ratio should be taken by \nbanks and State Governments and the districts should be \"adopted\" by the \nDistrict Administration and th e Lead Bank jointly.  28 \n \n\uf0b7 While banks would be responsible for credit disbursement, the State \nGovernment would be required to give an upfront commitment regarding its  \nresponsibilities for creation of identified rural infrastructure together with support \nin crea ting an enabling environment for banks to lend and to recover their dues.  \n\uf0b7 Progress in the special category districts should  be monitored at the district \nlevel and reported to the corporate offices of the concerned banks.  \n\uf0b7 The Chairmen/ Managing Directors  of banks should  give special attention to \nthe CD Ratio in such districts.  \n \n7.   Direct Benefit Transfer  \n \nDirect Benefit Transfer  (DBT) was rolled out by  the Government of India in  selected \ndistricts in January 2013. It was expanded to other districts subseq uently.  SLBC \nConvenor  Banks were advised  to co -ordinate with the Government authorities to \nimplement DBT.  Banks were advised to include the status of the roll -out of DBT as a \nregular agenda item for discussion in SLBC meetings as part of Financial \nInclusi on/Direct  Benefit Transfer ( DBT) implementation. As a prerequisite to the \nimplementation of the DBT, every eligible individual should have a bank account. \nFurther, to make disbursements at the doorstep through the ICT -based BC model, \nbanking outlets either  through brick & mortar branches or the branchless mode is \nneeded in all villages across the country.  Hence, banks have been advised to :  \n\uf0b7 take steps to complete  the opening of bank accounts  and seeding of Aadhaar \nnumber s in all bank accounts .  \n\uf0b7 closely mon itor the progress in seeding of Aadhaar number with the bank  \naccounts of beneficiaries.  \n\uf0b7 put in place a system to  provide the  beneficiary of the seeding request an \nacknowledgement and  also send a confirmation of the seeding of Aadhaar \nnumber.  \n\uf0b7 form a DBT Imp lementation Co -ordination Committee, along with the State \nGovernment department  concerned, at district level and review the seeding of \nAadhaar number s in bank accounts.  \n\uf0b7 ensure that district and village wise names and other details of  business \ncorresponden ts (BCs) engaged/other arrangements made by the bank are \ndisplayed on  the SLBC website.  29 \n \n\uf0b7 set up a Complaint Grievance Redressal mechanism in each bank and \nnominate a Complaint Redressal Officer in each district, to redress the \ngrievances related to \u2018seeding  of Aadhaar number in bank accounts'.  \nBanks we re further advised to ensure that opening of bank accounts and seeding of \nAadhaar numbers with existing or new accounts of eligible beneficiaries opened for \nthe purpose of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) under so cial welfare schemes, was in \nconformity with the provisions listed under Section 16 of the Master Direction - Know \nYour Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016  (updated as on May 29, 2019) and extant \nprovisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering (PML) Rules .  \n8. Service Area Approach (SAA)  \n \ni) The Service Area Approach (SAA) , introduced in April 1989 for planned and orderly \ndevelopment of rural and semi -urban areas was applicable to all scheduled \ncommercial banks including Regional Rural Banks.  Under SAA, each b ank branch in \na rural or semi -urban area was designated to serve an area of 15 to 25 villages and \nthe branch was responsible for meeting the needs of bank credit of its service area.  \nThe primary objective of SAA was to increase productive lending and forg e effective \nlinkages between bank credit, production, productivity and increase in income levels.  \n   \nii) The Service Area Approach scheme was reviewed in December 2004 and it was \ndecided to dispense with the restrictive provisions of the scheme while retai ning the \npositive features of the SAA such as credit planning and monitoring of the credit \npurveyance. Accordingly, under SAA , the allocation of villages among the rural and \nsemi -urban branches of banks were made not applicable for lending except under \nGovernment Sponsored Schemes. Thus , while  the commercial banks and RRBs are \nfree to lend i n any rural and semi -urban area, the borrowers have the choice of \napproaching any branch for their credit requirements.  \n \n8.1 Dispensing with \u2018No Due Certificate \u2019 \n \nIn order to ensure hassle free credit to all borrowers, especially in rural and semi -urban \nareas and keeping in view the technological developments and the different ways \navailable with banks to avoid multiple financing, banks have been advised to dispense \nwith obtaining a \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 from the individual borrowers (including SHGs & \nJLGs) in rural and semi -urban areas for all types of loans including loans under 30 \n \nGovernment Sponsored Schemes, irrespective of the amount involved unless the \nGovernment Spons ored Scheme itself provides for obtention of a \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019.  \nFurther, it has been clarified that the policy of dispensing with a \u2018No Due Certificate \u2019 \nfor lending by banks is also applicable to urban areas including metropolitan cities.  \n \nii)   Banks  are encouraged to use an alternative framework of due diligence as part of \nthe credit appraisal exercise other than the \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 which could, among \nothers, consist of one or more of the following:  \n\uf0b7 Credit history check through Credit Informatio n Companies  (CICs)  \n\uf0b7 Self-declaration or an affidavit from the borrower  \n\uf0b7 CERSAI registration  \n\uf0b7 Peer monitoring  \n\uf0b7 Information sharing among lenders  \n\uf0b7 Information search (writing to other lenders with an auto deadline)  \n \niii) Banks are also advised to submit information/da ta to all Credit Information \nCompanies (CICs), as required in terms of extant instructions issued by RBI.  \n \n9.   Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022  \ni)  The Government of India , in the Union Budget 2016 -17, had announced its resolve \nto double the income of  farmers by 2022. Several steps have been taken towards \nattaining this objective including setting up of an inter -ministerial committee for \npreparation of a blue print for the same. This agenda has also been reiterated by the \ngovernment in several fora and has acquired primacy from the point of view of rural \nand agricultural development.  \nii) The strategy to achieve this goal, inter -alia, include s,  \n \n\uf0b7 Focus on irrigation with large budgets, with the aim of \"per drop, more crop\"  \n\uf0b7 Provision of quality seeds and nutrients based on soil health of each field  \n\uf0b7 Investments in warehousing and cold chains to prevent post -harvest crop \nlosses  \n\uf0b7 Promotion of value addition through food processing  31 \n \n\uf0b7 Creation of a national farm market, removing distortions and develop ment of  \ninfrastructure such as e -platform across 585 stations  \n\uf0b7 Strengthening of the crop insurance scheme to mitigate risks at affordable \ncost \n\uf0b7 Promotion of ancillary activities like poultry, bee -keeping and fisheries  \niii. Needless to emphasize that acceleration in inc ome generation is significantly \ndependent on better capital formation in agriculture. Towards this, banks should revisit \ntheir documentation for crop loans, simplify them where required and ensure speedy \nsanctioning and disbursal of loans within specified time limits.  \niv. The Lead Bank Scheme, which ensures inter -departmental/governmental \ncoordination in the financial sector, should , therefore , be leveraged to further the \nobjective of doubling farmers \u2019 income by 2022. Lead Banks are accordingly advised \nto ensure the following:  \na. Work closely with NABARD in the preparation of Potential Linked Credit Plans \n(PLPs) & Annual Credit Plans (ACPs) keeping the above strategy in \nconsideration  \nb. Include \u2018Doubling of Farmers \u2019 Income by 2022\u2019 as a regular agenda under the \nLead Bank Scheme in various fora such as SLBC, DCC, DLRC and BLBC  \nc. For the purpose of monitoring and reviewing the progress, Lead Banks may \nuse the benchmarks as may be provided by NABARD  \nd. Map the overall strategy as given in para 9 (ii) above to the agricu lture/agro -\nancillary lending plan of the bank . \n \n10. Expanding and Deepening of Digital Payments  Ecosystem    \n \nWith a view to expanding and deepening the digital payments ecosystem, the \nSLBCs/UTLBCs were advised to identify one district in their respective S tates/UTs on \na pilot basis in consultat ion with banks and stakeholders  and allocate it to a bank with \nsignificant footprint which will endeavour to make the district 100% digitally enabled  \nwithin one year , in order to enable every individual in the distric t to make/ receive \npayments digitally in a safe, secure, quick, affordable and convenient manner. SLBC/ \nUTLBC Convenor Banks were also advised to devise a time bound roadmap to all \nbranches of member banks (Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks, Region al 32 \n \nRural Banks, Small Finance Banks and Payments Banks) located in the identified \ndistrict(s) for on -boarding merchants/ traders/ businesses/ utility service providers to \nfacilitate fully digital transactions .  Further, SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks were \nadvised to constitute a Sub -Committee on Digital Payments at SLBC/ UTLBC level.  \nSubsequently, SLBCs/ UTLBCs were also advised to scale up the captioned \nprogramme in one or two other districts under their jurisdiction in consultation with  \nState Governments/ UT Administrations and other  stakeholders.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 33 \n \n \n \nAnnex I  \n \nList of State / UT-wise SLBC / UTLBC  Convenor Banks and district -wise Lead Banks  \nSr. \nNo. State / Union \nTerritory  SLBC /UTLBC  \nConvenor  \nbank  District  District lead bank  \n1 Andhra \nPradesh  Union Bank of \nIndia  1.

Application \nTo all Scheduled Commercial Banks, excluding Paym ents Banks and Regional Rural Banks.  \n \n    \n  \n2 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n 1 INTRODUCTION   \n An important criterion for judging the soundness of a banking institution is the size \nand character, not only of its assets portfolio but also, of its contingent liability \ncommitments such as guarantees, letters of credit, etc. As a part of business, banks  \nissue guarantees on behalf of their customers for various purposes. The guarantees \nexecuted by banks comprise both performance guarantees and financial guarantees. \nThe guarantees are structured according to the terms of agreement, viz., security, \nmaturity  and purpose. Banks should comply with the following guidelines in the \nconduct of their guarantee business.  \n2 GUIDELINES  \n2.1 General Guidelines \n2.1.1 As regards the purpose of the guarantee, as a general rule, the banks should confine themselves to the pr ovision of financial guarantees and exercise due caution with \nregard to performance guarantee business.  \n2.1.2 As regards maturity, as a rule, banks should guarantee shorter maturities and leave \nlonger maturities to be guaranteed by other institutions.  \n2.1.3 No bank guarantee should normally have a maturity of more than 10 years. However, \nwhere banks extend long term loans for periods longer than 10 years for various \nprojects, it has been decided to allow banks to also issue guarantees for periods \nbeyond 10 years . While issuing such guarantees, banks are advised to take into \naccount the impact of very long duration guarantees on their Asset Liability \nManagement. Further, banks may evolve a policy on issuance of guarantees beyond \n10 years as considered appropriate with the approval of their Board of Directors.  \n \n2.1.4 Banks should, in general, refrain from issuing non-fund based facilities  to/on behalf of \nconstituents who do not enjoy credit facilities with them. However, banks are permitted \nto grant non-fund based facilit ies, including partial credit enhancement1, to those \ncustomers, who do not avail any fund based facility from any bank in India. Provision \nof such facilities shall be in terms of a comprehensive Board approved policy for grant \nof non-fund based facility to such borrowers. The banks shall ensure that the borrower \nhas not availed any fund based facility from any bank operating in India. However, at \nthe time of granting non-fund based facilities, banks shall obtain declaration from the \ncustomer about the non- fund based credit facilities already enjoyed by them from \nother banks. Banks shall undertake the same level of credit appraisal as has been laid \ndown for fund based facilities. The instructions related to KYC / AML / CFT, \nsubmission of credit information to Credit Information Companies and other prudential \nnorms applicable to banks , including exposure norms, issued by RBI from time to time, \nshall be adhered to in respect of all such facility. However, banks are prohibited from \nnegotiating unrestricted LCs of non- constituents. In cases where negotiation of bills \ndrawn under LC is restricted to a particular bank and the beneficiary of the LC is not a constituent of that bank, the bank shall have the option to negotiate such LCs, \n                                                 \n1 As stipulated in paragraph 2.4.3.1.(vi)  below   \n  \n3 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n subject to the condition that the proceeds are remitted to the regular banker of the \nbeneficiary.  \n \n2.1.5 Further, BG /LC may be issued by scheduled commercial banks to clients of co-\noperative banks  against counter guarantee of the co-operative bank  as permitted \nhitherto. In such cases, banks shall be guided by the provisions of paragraph 2.3.8 .2 \nof the Master Circular on Loans and Advances -Statutory and Other Restrictions  dated \nJuly 1, 2015  as amended from time to time . Further, in such cases banks must satisfy \nthemselves that the concerned co-operative banks have sound credit appraisal and \nmonitoring systems as well as robust Know Your Customer (KYC) regime. Before \nissuing BG/LCs to specifi c constituents of co-operative banks, they must satisfy \nthemselves that KYC  check  has been done properly in these cases.   \n2.1.6 The guarantee of parent companies may be obtained in the case of subsidiaries whose \nown financial condition is not considered satisfactory.  \n2.2 Guidelines relating to conduct of guarantee business \n2.2.1 Norms for unsecured advances & guarantees \n2.2.1.1 Until June 17, 2004, banks were required to limit their commitments by way of \nunsecured guarantees in such a manner that 20 percent of a bank\u2019s outstanding unsecured guarantees plus the total of its outstanding unsecured advances should \nnot exceed 15 percent of its total outstanding advances. In order to provide further \nflexibility to banks on their loan policies, the above limit on unsecured exposure of \nbanks was withdrawn and banks\u2019 Boards have been given the freedom to fix their own \npolicies on their unsecured exposures. \"Unsecured exposure\" is defined as an \nexposure where the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank/ \napproved valuers  / Reserve Bank\u2019s inspecting officers, is not more than 10 per cent, \nab-initio, of the outstanding exposure. Exposure shall include all funded and non-funded exposures (including underwriting and similar commitments). \u2018Security\u2019 will \nmean tangible security properly charged to the bank and will not include intangible \nsecurities like guarantees  (including State government guarantees) , letter  of comfort, \netc.  \n2.2.1.2  For determining the amount of unsecured advances for reflecting in schedule 9 of the \npublished balance sheet, the rights, licenses, authorisations, etc., charged to the \nbanks as collateral in respect of projects (including infrastructure projects) financed \nby them, should not be reckoned as tangible security. Banks, may however, treat \nannuities under build-operate \u2013transfer (BOT) model in respect of road/highway \nprojects and toll collection rights where there are provisions to compensate the project \nsponsor if a certain level of traffic is not achieved, as tangible securities, subject to the \ncondition that banks\u2019 right to receive annuities and toll collection rights is legally \nenforceable and irrevocable. \n2.2.1.3  All exemptions allowed for computation of unsecured advances stand withdrawn. \n \n  \n  \n4 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n 2.2.2 Precautions for issuing guarantees \nBanks should adopt the following precautions while issuing guarantees on behalf of \ntheir customers. \n(i)    As a rule, banks should avoid giving unsecured guarantees in large amounts and \nfor medium and long-term periods. They should avoid undue concentration of such \nunsecured guarantee commitments to particular groups of customers and/or trades.  \n(ii)   Unsec ured guarantees on account of any individual constituent should be limited \nto a reasonable proportion of the bank\u2019s total unsecured guarantees. Guarantees on \nbehalf of an individual should also bear a reasonable proportion to the constituent\u2019s \nequity. \n(iii)    In exceptional cases, banks may give deferred payment guarantees on an \nunsecured basis for modest amounts to first class customers who have entered into \ndeferred payment arrangements in consonance with Government policy.  \n(iv) Guarantees executed on behalf of any individual constituent, or a group of \nconstituents, should be subject to the prescribed exposure norms. \n(v)     It is essential to realise that guarantees contain inherent risks and that it would \nnot be in the bank\u2019s interest or in the public interest, generally, to encourage parties \nto over -extend their commitments and embark upon enterprises solely relying on the \neasy availability of guarantee facilities.  \n2.2.3 Precautions for averting frauds \nWhile issuing guarantees on behalf of customers, the following safeguards should be \nobserved by banks:  \n \n(i) At the time of issuing financial guarantees, banks should be sati sfied that the \ncustomer would be in a position to reimburse the bank in case the bank is required \nto make payment under the guarantee. \n \n(ii) In the case of performance guarantee, banks should exercise due caution and \nhave sufficient experience with the cus tomer to satisfy themselves that the \ncustomer has the necessary experience, capacity and means to perform the \nobligations under the contract, and is not likely to commit any default.  \n \n2.2.4 Ghosh Committee Recommendations \nBanks should implement the follow ing recommendations made by the High Level \nCommittee constituted in October 1991 (Chaired by Shri A. Ghosh, the then Dy. \nGovernor of RBI):  \n(i) In order to prevent unaccounted issue of guarantees, as well as fake guarantees, \nas suggested by IBA, bank guarantees should be issued in serially numbered \nsecurity forms.  \n  \n5 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n         \n(ii) Banks should, while forwarding guarantees, caution the beneficiaries that they \nshould, in their own interest, verify the genuineness of the guarantee with the issuing \nbank.  \n2.2.5 Internal control systems \nBank guarantees issued for Rs.50,000/- and above should be signed by two officials \njointly. A lower cut-off point, depending upon the size and category of branches, may \nbe prescribed by banks, where considered necessary. Such a sys tem will reduce the \nscope for malpractices/ losses arising from the wrong perception/ judgement or lack \nof honesty/ integrity on the part of a single signatory. Banks should evolve suitable \nsystems and procedures, keeping in view the spirit of these instru ctions and allow \ndeviation from the two signatures discipline only in exceptional circumstances. The \nresponsibility for ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems and \nprocedures for preventing perpetration of frauds and malpractices by their officials \nwould, in such cases, rest on the top managements of the banks. In case, exceptions are made for affixing of only one signature on the instruments, banks should devise a \nsystem for subjecting such instruments to special scrutiny by the auditors or \ninspectors at the time of internal inspection of branches.  \n2.2.6 Guarantees on behalf of Banks' Directors  \n2.2.6.1  Section 20 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 prohibits banks from granting loans \nor advances to any of their directors or any firm or company in which any of their \ndirectors is a partner or guarantor. However, certain facilities which, inter alia, include \nissue of guarantees, are not regarded as 'loan and advances' within the meaning of \nSection 20 of the Act, ibid. In this regard, it is pertinent to note with particular reference \nto banks giving guarantees on behalf of their directors, that in the event of the principal \ndebtor committing default in discharging his liability and the bank being called upon to \nhonour its obligation under the guarantee, the relationship between the bank and the \ndirector could become one of creditor and debtor. Further, directors would also be \nable to evade the provisions of Section 20 by borrowing from a third party against the guarantee given by the bank. These types of transactions are likely to defeat the very \npurpose of Section 20 of the Act, if banks do not take appropriate steps to ensure that \nthe liabilities there under do not devolve on them.  \n2.2.6.2  In view of the above, banks should, while extending non-fund based facilities such as \nguarantees, etc. on behalf of their directors and the companies/firms in which the \ndirector is interested, ensure that:  \n(i) adequate and effective arrangements have been made to the satisfaction of the \nbank that the commitments would be met out of their own resources by the party on \nwhose behalf guarantee was issued and  \n(ii) the bank will not be called upon to grant any loan or advance to meet the liability, \nconsequent upon the invocation of the guarantee.   \n  \n6 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n  In case, such contingencies arise as at (ii) above, the bank will be deemed to be a \nparty to the violation of the provisions of Section 20 of the Banking Regulation Act, \n1949. \n2.2.7 Bank Guarantee Scheme of Government of India2 \n2.2.7.1 The Bank Guarantee Scheme formulated by the Government of India for the issuance \nof bank guarantees in favour of Central Government Departments, in lieu of security deposits, etc. by contractors, has been modified from time to time. Under  the scheme, \nit is open to Government Departments to accept freely guarantees, etc. from all \nscheduled commercial banks.  \n2.2.7.2 Banks should adopt the Model Form of Bank Guarantee Bond given in Annex 1.  The \nGovernment of India have advised all the Government departments/ Public Sector \nUndertakings, etc. to accept bank guarantees in the Model Bond and to ensure that alterations/additions to the clauses whenever considered necessary are not one-sided \nand are made in agreement with the guaranteeing bank. Banks should mention in the \nguarantee bonds and their correspondence with the various State Governments, the \nnames of the beneficiary departments and the purposes for which the guarantees are \nexecuted. This is necessary to facilitate prompt identification of the guarantees with \nthe concerned departments. In regard to the guarantees furnished by the banks in \nfavour of Government Departments in the name of the President of India, any \ncorrespondence thereon should be exchanged with the c oncerned ministries/ \ndepartments and not with the President of India.  \n2.2.8 Guarantees on behalf of Share and Stock Brokers/ Commodity Brokers \nBanks may issue guarantees on behalf of share and stock brokers in favour of stock exchanges in lieu of security  deposit to the extent it is acceptable in the form of bank \nguarantee as laid down by stock exchanges. Banks may also issue guarantees in lieu \nof margin requirements as per stock exchange regulations. Banks have been advised \nthat they should obtain a minim um margin of 50 percent while issuing such \nguarantees. A minimum cash margin of 25 per cent (within the above margin of 50 per cent) should be maintained in respect of such guarantees issued by banks. The \nabove minimum margin of 50 percent and minimum cash margin requirement of 25 \npercent (within the margin of 50 percent) will also apply to guarantees issued by banks \non behalf of commodity brokers in favour of the commodity exchanges, registered with \nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) , in lieu of margin requirements as per \nthe commodity exchange regulations. Banks should assess the requirement of each \napplicant and observe usual and necessary safeguards including the exposure \nceilings.   \n2.2.8.1  Irrevocable Payment Commitments \u2013  Financial Guarantees \nBanks issuing Irrevocable Payment Commitment (IPCs) to various Stock Exchanges  \non behalf of Mutual Funds and FPI s are advised to adopt the following risk mitigation \nmeasures: \n                                                 \n2 The previous stipulations under paragraph 2.2.7.2 related to bank guarantees issued in favour of Directorate General of \nSupplies and Disposal (DGS&D) have been repealed as DGS&D has been wound up and ceased operations   \n  \n7 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n (i) Only those custodian banks would be permitted to issue IPCs who have a \nclause in the Agreement with their clients which gives them an inalienable right \nover the securities to be received as payout in any settlement. However, in \ncases where transactions are pre -funded i.e. there are clear INR funds in the \ncustomer\u2019s account and, in case of FX deals, the bank\u2019s nostro account has been credited before the issuance of the IPC by custodian banks, the \nrequirement of the clause of inalienable right over the securit y to be received \nas payout in the agreement with the clients will not be insisted upon.  \n(ii) As regards calculation of Capital Market Exposure ( CME ), the relevant \ninstruction s are contained in para 2.3.5 of our Master Circular on \u2018Exposure \nNorms \u2019 dated July 1, 2015 as amended from time to time.   \n \n2.2.9 Guidelines relating to obtaining of personal guarantees of promoters, directors,  \nother managerial personnel, and shareholders of borrowing concerns \nBanks should take personal guarantees of promoters, directors , other managerial \npersonnel or major shareholders for the credit facilities granted to corporates, public \nor private, only when absolutely warranted after a careful examination of the circumstances of the case and not  as a matter of course. In order to identify the \ncircumstances under which the guarantee may or may not be considered necessary, \nbanks should be guided by the following broad considerations:  \nA.       Where guarantees need not be considered necessary  \n(i) Ordinarily, in the case of public limited companies, when the lending institutions are \nsatisfied about the management, its stake in the concern, economic viability of the \nproposal and the financial position and capacity for cash generation, no personal guarantee need be insisted upon. In fact, in the case of widely owned public limited \ncompanies, which may be rated as first class and satisfying the above conditions, \nguarantees may not be necessary even if the advances are unsecured. Also, in the \ncase of companies, whether private or public, which are under professional \nmanagement, guarantees may not be insisted upon from persons who are connected \nwith the management s olely by virtue of their professional/technical qualifications and \nnot consequent upon any significant shareholding in the company concerned. \n(ii) Where the lending institutions are not so convinced about the aspects of loan \nproposals mentioned above, they  should seek to stipulate conditions to make the \nproposals acceptable without such guarantees. In some cases, more stringent forms \nof financial discipline like restrictions on distribution of dividends, further expansion, \naggregate borrowings, creation of further charge on assets and stipulation of \nmaintenance of minimum net working capital may be necessary. Also, the parity \nbetween owned funds and capital investment and the overall debt-equity ratio may \nhave to be taken into account.  \nB.       Where guarant ees may be considered helpful \n(i) Personal guarantees may be helpful in respect of companies, whether private or \npublic, where shares are held closely by a person or connected persons or a group  \n  \n8 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n (not being professionals or Government), irrespective of other factors, such as \nfinancial condition, security available, etc. The exception being in respect of \ncompanies where, by court or statutory order, the management of the company is \nvested in a person or persons, whether called directors or by any other name, who \nare not required to be elected by the shareholders. Where personal guarantee is considered necessary, the guarantee should preferably be that of the principal \nmembers of the group holding shares in the borrowing company rather than that of \nthe director /managerial personnel functioning as director or in any managerial \ncapacity.  \n(ii) Even if a company is not closely held, there may be justification for a personal \nguarantee of directors to ensure continuity of management. Thus, a lending institution \ncould make a loan to a company whose management is considered good. \nSubsequently, a different group could acquire control of the company, which could lead the lending institution to have well -founded fears that the management has \nchanged for the worse and that the funds lent to the company are in jeopardy. One way by which lending institutions could protect themselves in such circumstances is \nto obtain guarantees of the directors and thus ensure either the continuity of the \nmanagement or that the changes in management take place with their knowledge. \nEven where personal guarantees are waived, it may be necessary to obtain an undertaking from the borrowing company that no change in the management would \nbe made without the consent of the lending institution. Similar ly, during the formative \nstages of a company, it may be in the interest of the company, as well as the lending \ninstitution, to obtain guarantees to ensure continuity of management. \n(iii) Personal guarantees may be helpful with regard to public limited comp anies other \nthan those which may be rated as first class, where the advance is on an unsecured basis.  \n(iv) There may be public limited companies, whose financial position and/or capacity \nfor cash generation is not satisfactory even though the relevant advances are secured. In such cases, personal guarantees are useful.  \n(v) Cases where there is likely to be considerable delay in the creation of a charge on \nassets, guarantee may be taken, where deemed necessary, to cover the interim period between the disburs ement of loan and the creation of the charge on assets.  \n(vi) Personal guarantees are relevant where the balance sheet or financial statement \nof a company discloses interlocking of funds between the company and other \nconcerns owned or managed by a group. \nC.        Worth of the guarantors, payment of guarantee commission, etc \nWhere personal guarantees of directors are warranted, they should bear reasonable \nproportion to the estimated worth of the person. The system of obtaining guarantees \nshould not be used by the directors and other managerial personnel as a source of \nincome from the company. Banks should obtain an undertaking from the borrowing \ncompany as well as the guarantors that no consideration whether by way of \ncommission, brokerage fees or any other  form, would be paid by the former or \nreceived by the latter, directly or indirectly. This requirement should be incorporated  \n  \n9 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n in the bank's terms and conditions for sanctioning of credit limits. During the periodic \ninspections, the bank's inspectors should verify that this stipulation has been complied \nwith. There may, however, be exceptional cases where payment of remuneration may \nbe permitted e.g. where assisted concerns are not doing well and the existing \nguarantors are no longer connected with the management but continuance of their guarantees is considered essential because the new management's guarantee is \neither not available or is found inadequate. \nD.        Personal guarantees in the case of stressed units \nAs the personal guarantees of promoters/ directors generally instill greater \naccountability and responsibility on their part and prompt the managements to conduct \nthe running of the assisted units on sound and healthy lines and to ensure financial \ndiscipline, banks, may in their discretion, at the time of renewal obtain guarantees \nfrom directors (excluding the nominee directors) and other managerial personnel in \ntheir individual capacities  if the exposure exhibits signs of stress as per the \nassessment of the bank . In case, for any reasons, a guarantee is not considered \nexpedient by the bank at the time of sanctioning the advance, an undertaking should be obtained from the individual directors and a covenant should invariably be incorporated in the loan agreement that in case the borrowing unit show s cash losses \nor adverse current ratio or diversion of fund, the directors would be under an obligation \nto execute guarantees in their individual capacities, if required by the bank. Banks \nmay also obtain guarantees at their discretion from the parent/holdi ng company when \ncredit facilities are extended to borrowing units in the same Group. \n2.2.10 Guarantees of State Government  \nThe guidelines laid down in paragraph 2.2.9 above, for taking personal guarantees of directors and other managerial personnel, should also be followed in respect of \nproposal of State Government undertakings/projects and guarantees may not be \ninsisted upon unless absolutely warranted. In other words, banks could obtain \nguarantees of State Governments on merits and only in circumstances absolutely \nnecessary after thorough examination of the circumstances of each case, and not as \nmatter of course.  \n2.3 Other stipulations \u2013 Issuing bid bond s and performance guarantees for export   \nWith a view to boost exports, banks should adopt a flexible approach in the matter of \nobtaining cover and earmarking of assets/ credit limits, drawing power, while issuing \nbid bonds and performance guarantees for export purposes. Banks may, however, \nsafeguard their interests by obtaining coverage from Export Credit G uarantee \nCorporation of India Ltd. ( ECGC), wherever considered necessary. Banks may \nconsider sanctioning separate limits for issue of bid bonds. Within the limits so \nsanctioned, bid bonds against individual contracts may be issued, subject to usual \nconsiderations. \n \n2.3.1  Unconditional Guarantees in favour of Overseas Employers/Importers on behalf \nof Indian Exporters   \n  \n10 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n      2.3.1.1 While agreeing to give unconditional guarantee in favour of overseas \nemployers/importers on behalf of Indian Exporters, banks should obtain an \nundertaking from the exporter to the effect that when the guarantee is invoked, the \nbank would be entitled to make payment, notwithstanding any dispute between the \nexporter and the importer. Although, such an undertaking may not prev ent the \nexporter from approaching the Court for an injunction order, it might weigh with the \nCourt in taking a view whether injunction order should be issued. \n2.3.1.2 Banks s hould, while issuing guarantees , keep the above points in view and \nincorporate sui table clauses in the agreement, in consultation with their legal advisers. \nThis is considered desirable as non-honouring of guarantees on invocation might \nprompt overseas banks not to accept guarantees of Indian banks, thus hampering the \ncountry's export promotion effort. \n2.3.2  Certain precautions in case of Project Exports  \n2.3.2.1 As per the provisions of the revised Memorandum of Instructions on Project & Service \nExports issued vide circular on Export of Goods and Services \u2013 Project Exports dated \nJuly 22, 2014, AD banks/Exim Bank have been authorized to consider according post-\naward approvals for high value overseas project exports. However, the responsibility \nof project appraisal and that of monitoring the project lies solely on the lending bank s. \n2.3.2.2 Banks  should examine the project proposals thoroughly with regard to the capacity of \nthe contractor/ sub-contractors, protective clauses in the contracts, adequacy of \nsecurity, credit ratings of the overseas sub-contractors, if any, etc.  \n2.3.2.3 Therefore, the need for a careful assessment of financial and technical demands \ninvolved in the proposals vis -\u00e0-vis the capability of the contractors (including sub-\ncontractors) as well as the overseas employers can hardly be under -rated to the \nfinancing of any domestic projects. In fact, the export projects should be given more \nattention, in view of their high values and the possibilities of foreign exchange losses \nin case of failure, apart from damage to the image of Indian entrepreneurs. \n2.3.2.4 While bid bonds and performance guarantees cannot be avoided, it is to be \nconsidered whether guarantees should be given by the banks in all cases of overseas \nborrowings for financing overseas projects. Such guarantees should not be executed \nas a matter of course, merely because of the participation of Exim Bank and \navailability of counter -guarantee of ECGC. Appropriate ar rangements should also be \nmade for post-award follow -up and monitoring of the contracts. \n2.3.3   Guarantees for Export Advance \n \n2.3.3.1 Guarantees are permitted in respect of debt or other liability incurred by an exporter \non account of exports from India.  It is therefore intended to facilitate execution of export contracts by an exporter and not for other purposes. In terms of extant \ninstructions banks have also been advised that guarantees contain inherent risks, and \nthat it would not be in the banks' interest or in the public interest generally to \nencourage parties to over -extend their commitments and embark upon enterprises \nsolely rely ing on the easy availability of guarantee facilities.    Banks should, therefore, \nbe careful while extending guarantees against export advances so as to ensure that  \n  \n11 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n no violation of FEMA regulations takes place and banks  are not exposed to various \nrisks the export advances received by the exporters are in compliance with the \nregulations/ directions issued under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.  It \nwill be important for the banks to carry out due diligence and verify the track record of \nsuch exporters to assess their ability to execute such export orders.  \n \n2.3.3.2 Further, banks should also ensure that the export advances received by the exporters \nare in compliance with the regulations/ directions issued under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.  \n \n2.3.3.3 It is reiterated that export performance guarantees, where permitted to be issued, \nshall strictly be in the nature of performance guarantee and shall not contain any \nclauses which may in effect allow such performance guarantees to be utilized as \nfinancial guarantees/Standby Letters of Credits  \n2.3.4  Review of banks\u2019 procedures  \nBanks may periodically review the position regarding delegation of powers and their \nprocedures, and take such action as may be necessary with a view to expediting \ndecision on export proposals. They may also consider designating a specified branch, \nequipped with adequately qualified and trained staff, in each important centre to deal \nexpeditiously with all export credit proposals at the centre.  \n2.3.5  Overseas Investm ent \u2013 Guarantee on behalf of Wholly Owned Subsidiaries \n(WOSs )/Joint Ventures (JVs) abroad \n \nAn Indian party may have financial commitment to its overseas JV / WOS to the limit, as \nprescribed by the Reserve bank from time to time, of the net worth of the Indian party as \non the date of the last audited balance sheet. The financial commitment may be in the \nform of  \n(i)  capital contribution and loan to the JV / WOS; \n(ii)  corporate guarantee (only 50 percent value in case of performance guarantee) and /   \n       or bank guarantee (which is backed by a counter guarantee / collateral by the   \n       Indian party) on behalf of the JV / WOS and  \n(iii)  charge on immovable / movable property and other financial assets  of the   \n       Indian party (including group company) on behalf of JV / WOS.  \n \nThe above measures were intended to assist Indian companies in their overseas \nbusiness. However, it has been observed that banks are extending non-fund based credit \nfacilities like guarantees / stand-by letter of credits / letter of comforts etc. on behalf of \nJoint Ventures  (JV)/ Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WoS)  / Wholly Owned Step Down \nSubsidiaries (WoSDS ) for purposes which are not connected with their business, rather, \nin certain cases, these facilities are  used to avail foreign currency loans for repayment of \nRupee loans.  \n  \n12 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n                      It is therefore clarified that banks, including overseas branches / subsidiaries of Indian \nbanks, shall not issue standby letters of credit / guarantees / letter of comforts etc. on \nbehalf of overseas JV / WOS / WoSDS  of Indian companies for the purpose of raising \nloans / advances of any  kind from other entities except in connection with the ordinary \ncourse of overseas business. Further while extending fund / non-fund based credit \nfacilities to overseas JV / WOS / WoSDS of Indian companies in connection with their \nbusiness, either through branches in India or through branches / subsidiaries abroad, \nbanks should ensure effective monitoring of the end use of such facilities and its conformity with the business needs of such entities. Banks  may also ensure compliance \nwith A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 20 dated March 13, 2018 regarding \u2018Discontinuance \nof Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) and Letters of Comfort (LoCs) for Trade Credits\u2019.  \n \n2.4 Restrictions on guarantees for placement of funds with NBFCs or other non-bank \nentities  \n2.4.1   Banks should not execute guarantees  for enabling placement of funds with NBFCs or \nother non-banking entities directly or indirectly , including inter -company deposits/ \nloans . This stipulation will apply to all sources of funds raised by such entities , e.g. \ndeposits/ loans received from trusts and other institutions.  \n2.4.2    Transactions of the following types  are in the nature of guarantees executed by banks \nin respect of funds made available by one non-banking entity to another non-banking \nentity and banks should therefore, desist from such practices:  \n(i) A seller drew bills, normally of 120 to 180 days usance, on the buyer which were \naccepted by the buyer and co-accepted by his banker. The bills were discounted by \nthe seller with the accommodating company, which retained the bills till the due date. \nThe bank which gave co -acceptance invariably earmarked funds for the liability under \nthe bills against the drawing power in respect of stocks held in the cash credit account \nof its client, the buyer, or  \n \n(ii) The accommodating company kept deposits for a specific period with the bank's \nborrowers under a guarantee executed by the bank. In such a case also, the bank \nearmarked the amount against drawing power available in the cash credit account.  \n2.4.3 .1 Banks may issue guarantees favouring other banks/ FIs/ other lending agencies for \nthe loans extended by the latter, subject to strict compliance with the following \nconditions.  \n(i)  The Board of Directors should reckon the integrity/ robustness of the bank\u2019s risk \nmanagement systems and, accordingly, put in place a well -laid out policy in this \nregard.  \nThe Board approved policy should, among others, address the following issues:   \n  \n13 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n \u2022 Prudential limits, linked to bank\u2019s Tier I capital, up to which guarantees favouring \nother banks/FIs/other lending agencies may be issued  \n\u2022 Nature and extent of security and margins  \n\u2022 Delegation of powers  \n\u2022 Reporting system  \n\u2022 Periodical reviews  \n(ii) The guarantee s hall be extended only in respect of borrower constituents and to \nenable them to avail of additional credit facility from other banks/FIs/lending \nagencies.  \n(iii)  The guaranteeing bank should assume a funded exposure of at least 10% of the \nexposure guaranteed. \n(iv)  Banks should not extend guarantees or letters of comfort in favour of overseas lenders including those assignable to overseas lenders. However, AD banks may \nalso be guided by the provisions contained in Notification No. FEMA 8/2000-RB \ndated May 3, 2000 and subsequent amendments thereof.  \n(v)  The guarantee issued by the bank will be an exposure on the borrowing entity on whose behalf the guarantee has been issued and w ill attract appropriate risk \nweight, as per the extant guidelines.  \n(vi) Of late, certain banks have been issuing guarantees on behalf of corporate entities \nin respect of non-convertible debentures issued by such entities. It is clarified that \nthe extant instructions apply only to loans and not to bonds or debt instruments. \nGuarantees by the banking system for a corporate bond or any debt instrument \nnot only have significant systemic implications but also impede the development \nof a genuine corporate debt market. Banks are advised to strictly comply with the \nextant regulations and in particular, not to provide guarantees for issuance of \nbonds or debt instruments of any kind. However, banks are permitted to provide \npartial credit enhancement (PCE) to bonds iss ued by corporates /special purpose \nvehicles (SPVs), NBFC -ND-SIs and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) subject \nto conditions stipulated in circular DBR.BP.BC.No.40/21.04.142/2015-16 dated \nSeptember 24, 2015 on Partial Credit Enhancement to Corporate Bonds and \nother associated circulars issued subsequently on the subject. The PCE shall be provided only in the form of a non-funded irrevocable contingent line of credit. \n2.4.3 .2  Lending banks \nBanks extending credit facilities against the guarantees issued by other banks/FIs \nshould ensure strict compliance with the following conditions:  \n(i)  The exposure assumed by the bank against the guarantee of another  bank/FI will \nbe deemed as an exposure on the guaranteeing bank/FI and will attract \nappropriate risk weight as per the extant guidelines. \n(ii)  Exposures assumed by way of credit facilities extended against the guarantees \nissued by other banks /FI should be reckoned within the inter bank exposure limits  \n  \n14 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n prescribed by the Board of Directors. Since the exposure assumed by the bank \nagainst the guarantee of another bank/FI will be for a fairly longer term than those \nassumed on account of inter -bank dealings in the money market, foreign \nexchange market and securities market, the Board of Directors should fix an appropriate sub-limit for the longer term exposures, since these exposures attract \ngreater risk.  \n(iii)  Banks should monitor the exposure assumed on the guaranteeing bank/ FI, on a \ncontinuous basis and ensure strict compliance with the prudential limits/ sub limits \nprescribed by their Boards  and the prudential single borrower limits prescribed by \nRBI for banks/FIs. \n \n2.4.4 Exceptions \n2.4.4.1 In regard to resolution of stressed  units, in exceptional cases, where banks are unable \nto participate in rehabilitation packages on account of temporary liquidity constraints, the concerned banks could provide guarantees in favour of the banks which take up \ntheir additional share. Such guarantees will remain extant until such time that the \nbanks providing additional finance against guarantees are re-compensated. \n2.4.4.2 In cases of Sellers Line of Credit Scheme (since r enamed as Direct  Discounting \nScheme) operated by IDBI Bank Ltd.\n3 and all India financial institutions like SIDBI, \nPFC, etc for sale of machinery, the primary credit is provided by the seller\u2019s bank to \nthe seller through bills drawn on the buyer and the seller\u2019s bank has no access to the \nsecurity covered by the transaction which remains with the buyer. As such, buyer\u2019s \nbanks are permitted to extend guarantee/ co-acceptance facility for the bills drawn \nunder seller\u2019s line of credit. \n2.4.4.3 Similarly, guarantees can be issued in favour of HUDCO/ State Housing Boards and \nsimilar bodies/ organisations for the loans granted by them to private borrowers who \nare unable to offer clear and marketable title to property, provided banks are otherwise satisfied with the capacity of the borrowers to adequately service such loans. \n2.4.4.4 Banks may i ssue guarantees in favour of various Development Agencies/Boards, like \nIndian Renewable Energy Development Agency, National Horticulture Board, etc. for \nobtaining soft loans and/or other forms of development assistance from such \nAgencies/Boards with the objective of improving efficiency, productivity, etc., subject \nto the following conditions: \n(i) Banks should satisfy themselves, on the basis of credit appraisal, regarding the \ntechnical feasibility, financial viability and bankability of individual projects and/or \nloan proposals i.e. the standard of such appraisal should be the same, as is done in the case of a loan proposal seeking sanction of term finance/loan. \n(ii) Banks should conform to the prudential exposure norms prescribed from time to time for an individual borrower/group of borrowers. \n(iii) Banks should suitably secure themselves before extending such guarantees. \n \n                                                 \n3 The scheme which was being operated by the erstwhile IDBI is being continued by IDBI Bank Ltd.   \n  \n15 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n 2.4.5 Infrastructure projects \nKeeping in view the special features of lending to infrastructure projects viz., the high \ndegree of apprai sal skills on the part of lenders and availability of resources of a \nmaturity matching with the project period, banks have been given discretion in the matter of issuance of guarantees favouring other lending agencies, in respect of \ninfrastructure projects  alone, subject to the following conditions: \n(i) The bank issuing the guarantee takes a funded share in the project at least to the \nextent of 5 percent of the project cost and undertakes normal credit appraisal, \nmonitoring and follow -up of the project. \n(ii) The guarantor bank has a satisfactory record in compliance with the prudential \nregulations, such as, capital adequacy, credit exposure, norms relating to income \nrecognition, asset classification and provisioning, etc.  \n2.5. Payment of invoked guarantees \n2.5.1  Where guarantees are invoked, payment should be made to the beneficiaries without \ndelay and demur. An appropriate procedure for ensuring such immediate honouring \nof guarantees should be laid down so that there is no delay on the pretext that legal \nadvice or approval of higher authorities is being obtained.  \n2.5.2  Delays on the part of banks in honouring the guarantees when invoked tend to erode \nthe value of the bank guarantees, the sanctity of the scheme of guarantees and image \nof banks. It also provides an opportunity to the parties to take recourse to courts and \nobtain injunction orders. In the case of guarantees in favour of Government \ndepartments, this not only delays the revenue collection efforts but also gives an \nerroneous impression that bank s are actively in collusion with the parties, which \ntarnishes  the image of the banking system.  \n2.5.3 There should be an effective system to ensure that the persons on whose behalf the guarantees are issued will be in a position to perform their obligations  in the case of \nperformance guarantees and honour their commitments out of their own resources, \nas and when needed, in the case of financial guarantees.  \n2.5.4  The top management of the banks should bestow their personal attention to the need \nto put in place a proper mechanism for making payments in respect of invoked \nguarantees promptly, so that no room is given for such complaints. When complaints \nare made, particularly by the Government departments for not honouring the guarantees issued, the top management of the bank, including its Chief Executive \nOfficer, should personally look into such complaints.  \n2.5.5 In this regard, the Delhi High Court has made adverse remarks against certain banks \nin not promptly honouring the commitment of guarantees when invoked. It has been \nobserved that a bank guarantee is a contract between the beneficiary and the bank. \nWhen the beneficiary invokes the bank guarantee and a letter invoking the same is \nsent in terms of the bank guarantee, it is obligatory on the bank to mak e payment to \nthe beneficiary.   \n  \n16 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n 2.5.6  The Supreme Court had observed [U.P. Co-operative Federation Private Ltd. versus \nSingh Consultants and Engineers Private Ltd. (1988 IC SSC 174)] that the \ncommitments of the banks must be honoured, free from interference by the courts. \nThe relevant extract from the judgement of the Supreme Court in a case is as under:  \n'We are, therefore, of the opinion that the correct position of law is that commitment \nof banks must be honoured free from interference by the courts and i t is only in \nexceptional cases, that is, to say, in case of fraud or any case where irretrievable \ninjustice would be done if bank guarantee is allowed to be encashed, the court should \ninterfere'.  \n2.5.7  In order to avoid such situations, it is absolutely essential for banks to appraise the \nproposals for guarantees with the same diligence, as in the case of fund based limits, and obtain adequate cover by way of margin so as to prevent the constituents to \ndevelop a tendency of defaulting in payments when invoked guarantees are honoured \nby the banks. \n2.5.8  (i) Banks are required to ensure that the guarantees issued by them are honoured \nwithout delay and hes itation when they are invoked in accordance with the terms and \nconditions of the guarantee deed, unless there is a Court order restraining the banks.  \n (ii) Any decision not to honour the obligation under the guarantee invoked may be \ntaken after careful consideration, at a fairly senior level, and only in the circumstances \nwhere the bank is satisfied that any such payment to the beneficiary would not be deemed a rightful payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the \nguarantee under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. \n (iii) The Chief Executive Officers of banks should assume personal responsibility for \nsuch complaints received from Government departments. Sufficient powers should be \ndelegated to the line functionaries so that delay on account of reference to higher \nauthorities for payment under the guarantee does not occur. \n (iv) For any non-payment of guarantee in time, staff accountability should be fixed and \nstern disciplinary action including award of major penalty such as dismissal, should be taken against the delinquent offi cials at all levels.  \n (v) Where banks have executed bank guarantees in favour of Customs and Central \nExcise authorities to cover differential duty amounts in connection with interim orders \nissued by High Courts, the guarantee amount should be released immediately when \nthey are invoked on vacation of the stay orders by Courts. Banks should not hold back \nthe amount on the pretext that it would affect their liquidity position.  \n2.5.9  There have also been complaints by Ministry of Finance that some of the depar tments \nsuch as Department of Revenue, Government of India are finding it difficult to execute \njudgements delivered by various Courts in their favour as banks do not honour their \nguarantees, unless certified copies of the Court judgements are made available to \nthem. In this regard, the banks may follow the following procedure: \n(i) Where the bank is a party to the proceedings initiated by Government for \nenforcement of the bank guarantee and the case is decided in favour of the  \n  \n17 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n Government by the Court, banks should not insist on production of certified copy of \nthe judgement, as the judgement/ order  is pronounced in open Court in presence of \nthe parties/ their counsels and the judgement is known to the bank  and a copy of the \njudgement is available on websites o f the Courts . \n(ii) In case the bank is not a party to the proceedings, a signed copy of the minutes of \nthe order certified by the Registrar/ Deputy or Assistant Registrar of the High Court or \nthe ordinary copy of the judgement/ order of the High Court, dul y attested to be true \ncopy by Government Counsel, should be sufficient for honouring the obligation under guarantee, unless the guarantor bank decides to file any appeal against the order of \nthe High Court. \n(iii) Banks should honour the guarantees issued by them as and when they are \ninvoked in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee deeds. In case \nof any disputes, such honouring can be done under protest, if necessary, and the \nmatters of dispute pursued separately.  \n(iv) The Government, on their part, have advised the various Government \ndepartments, etc. that the invocation of guarantees should be done after careful \nconsideration at a senior -level that a default has occurred in accordance with the \nterms and conditions of the guarantees and as provided in the guarantee deed.  \n(v) Non-compliance of the instructions in regard to honouring commitments under \ninvoked guarantees will be viewed by Reserve Bank very seriously and Reserve Bank \nwill be constrained to take deterrent action against the banks. \n2.6 Co-acceptance of bills \n2.6.1 General  \nReserve Bank has observed that some banks co-accept bills of their customers and \nalso discount bills co-accepted by other banks in a casual manner. These bills \nsubsequently turn out to be accommodation bills drawn by groups of sister concerns \non each other  where no genuine trade transaction takes place. Banks, while \ndiscounting such bills, appear to ignore this important aspect presumably because of the co-acceptance given by other banks. The bills, on maturity, are not honoured by \nthe drawees and the banks  which co- accept the bills have to make payment of these \nbills, and they find it difficult to recover the amount from the drawers/ drawees of bills. Banks also discount bills for sizeable amounts, which are co-accepted by certain \nUrban Co-operative Banks. On maturity, the bills are not honoured and the co-\noperative banks, which co-accept the bills, also find it difficult to make the payment. \nThe financial position and capacity of the co-accepting bank to honour the bills, in the event of need, is not being looked into. Cases have also been observed where the \nparticulars regarding co- acceptance of bills are not recorded in the bank's books, with \nthe result that the same cannot be verified during inspections, and the Head Office \nbecomes aware of the co-accepta nce only when a claim is received from the \ndiscounting bank.  \n  \n  \n18 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n 2.6.2 Safeguards \nIn the light of the above, banks should keep in view the following safeguards: \n          (i) While sanctioning co-acceptance limits to their customers, the need therefor e \nshould be ascertained, and such limits should be extended only to those customers \nwho enjoy other limits with the bank.  \n \n            (ii) Only genuine trade bills should be co- accepted and the banks should ensure that \nthe goods covered by bills co-accepted are actually received in the stock accounts of \nthe borrowers. \n             (iii) The valuation of the goods as mentioned in the accompanying invoice should be \nverified to see that there is no over -valuation of stocks.  \n \n            (iv)  The banks should not extend their co -acceptance to house bills/ accommodation \nbills drawn by group concerns on one another. \n \n            (v)  The banks discounting such bills, co-accepted by other banks, should also ensure \nthat the bills are not accommodation bills and that the co -accepting bank has the \ncapacity to redeem the obligation in case of need.  \n             (vi)  Bank -wise limits should be fixed, taking into consideration the size of each bank \nfor discounting bills co-accepted by other banks, and the relative powers of the officials of the other banks should be got registered with the discounting banks.  \n \n            (vii)  Care should be taken to see that the co-acceptance liability of any bank is not \ndisproportionate to its known resources position.  \n \n            (viii)  A system of obtaining periodical confirmation of the liability of co-accepting banks \nin regard to the outstanding bills should be introduced.  \n \n            (ix)  Proper records of the bills co-accepted for each customer should be maintained, \nso that the com mitments for each customer and the total commitments at a branch \ncan be readily ascertained, and these should be scrutinised by Internal Inspectors and \ncommented upon in their reports.  \n \n            (x)  It is also desirable for the discounting bank to advis e the Head Office/ Controlling \nOffice of the bank, which has co-accepted the bills, whenever such transactions appear to be disproportionate or large. \n \n(xi) Proper periodical returns may be prescribed so that the Branch Managers report \nsuch co -acceptance commitments entered into by them to the Controlling Offices.  \n \n(xii) Such returns should also reveal the position of bills that have become overdue, \nand which the bank had to meet under the co-acceptance obligation. This will enable \nthe Controlling Offices to monitor such co-acceptances furnished by the branches and \ntake suitable action in time, in difficult cases.  \n  \n  \n19 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n (xiii) Co-acceptances in respect of bills for  Rs.10,000/- and above should be signed \nby two officials jointly, deviation being allowed only in exceptional cases, e.g. non-\navailability of two officials at a branch. \n \n(xiv) Before discounting/ purchasing bills co-accepted by other banks for Rs. 2 lakh \nand above from a single party, the bank should obtain written confirmation of the \nconcerned Controlling (Regional/ Divisional/ Zonal) Office of the accepting bank and a record of the same should be kept. \n \n(xv) When the value of the total bills discounted/ purchased (which have been co-\naccepted by other banks) exceeds Rs. 20 lakh for a single borrower/ group of \nborrowers, prior approval of the Head Office of the co-accepting bank must be obtained by the discounting bank in writing.  \n2.6.2.1 In addition to the above safeguards to be observed by banks in co-accepting the bills, \nit must be noted that the banks are precluded from co-accepting bills drawn under Buyers Line of Credit Schemes introduced by IDBI Bank Ltd. and all India financial \ninstitutions like SIDB I, Power Finance Corporation Ltd. (PFC), etc. Similarly, banks \nshould not co-accept bills drawn by NBFCs. In addition, banks are advised not to \nextend co-acceptance on behalf of their buyers/constituents under the SIDBI Scheme.  \n2.6.2.2 However, banks may co-accept bills drawn under the Sellers Line of Credit Schemes \n(since renamed as Direct Discounting Scheme) operated by IDBI Bank Ltd.\n4 and all \nIndia financial institutions for Bill Discounting operated by IDBI Bank Ltd.5 and all India \nfinancial institutions like SIDBI, PFC, etc. without any limit, subject to the buyer\u2019s  \ncapability to pay, and compliance with the exposure norms prescribed by the bank for \nindividual/ group borrowers. \n2.6.2.3 There have been instances where branches of banks open L/Cs on behalf of their \nconstituents and also co- accept the bills drawn under such L/Cs. Legally, if a bank co-\naccepts a bill drawn under its own L/C, the bill so co-accepted becomes an \nindependent document. The special rules applicable to commercial credits do not \napply to such a bill and the bill is exclusively governed by the law relating to Bills of \nExchange, i.e. the Negotiable Instruments Act. The negotiating bank of such a bill is \nnot under any obligation to check the particulars of the bill with reference to the terms \nof the L/C. This practice is, therefore, superfluous and defeats the purpose of issuing \nthe L/C. The discounting banks should first ascertain from the co-accepting banks, the \nreason for such co-acceptance of bills drawn under their own L/C and only  after \nsatisfying themselves of genuineness of such transactions, they may consider \ndiscounting such bills.  \n2.6.2.4 It should be ensured that the branch officials strictly adhere to the above referred \ninstructions at the time of co-acceptance of bills. It would be advisable to determine \nclear accountability in this respect and officials found to be not complying with the \ninstructions must be dealt with sternly.  \n                                                 \n4 The scheme which was being operated by the erstwhile IDBI is being continued by IDBI Bank Ltd.  \n5 The Scheme which was being operated by the erstwhile IDBI is being continued by IDBI Bank Ltd.   \n  \n20 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n 2.7  Precautions to be taken in the case of Letter of Credit  \n2.7.1 In the case of LCs for import of goods, banks should be very vigilant while making \npayment to the overseas suppliers on the basis of shipping documents. They should \nexercise precaution and care in comparing the clients. The payments should be \nreleased to the foreign parties only after  ensuing that the documents are strictly in \nconformity with the terms of the LCs. There have been many irregularities in the conduct of LC business, such as the LC transactions not being recorded in the books \nof the branch by officials issuing them, the am ount of LCs being much in excess of \nthe powers vested in the officials, fraudulent issue of LCs involving a conspiracy/collusion between the beneficiary and the constituent. In such cases, the \nbanks should take action against the concerned officials as wel l as the constituent on \nwhose behalf the LCs were opened and the beneficiary of LCs, if a criminal conspiracy \nis involved. \n2.7.2 Settlement of claims under Letter of Credits  \nIn case the bills drawn under LCs are not honoured, it would adversely affect the \ncharacter of LCs and the relative bills as an accepted means of payment. This could \nalso affect the credibility of the entire payment mechanism through banks and affect the image of the banks. Banks should, therefore, honour their commitments under \nLCs and make payments promptly.  \n2.8     Compliance to the regulations of Foreign Exchange Management Act, 2000 \nBanks should note to comply with the directions, regulations issued under  Foreign \nExchange Management (Guarantee) Regulations , 2000 as amended from time to \ntime. \n2.9    Compliance to the Prudential Norms  \nBanks shall comply with all the related prudential norms issued by RBI as amended \nfrom time to time.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n  \n21 \nDOR\u2013  MC on Guarantees & Co-acceptances 2021  \n \n \n  \n Annex 1 \n \nModel Form of Bank Guarantee Bond \n[paragraph 2.2.7.2]  \nGUARANTEE BOND  \n1.

We have now revised and updated the Master \nCircular which consolidates important instru ctions on the subject issued by the Reserve \nBank of India till March 31, 2022.   \n \n2. A copy of the revised Master Circular  is enclosed for your information. This circular \nmay also be downloaded from our website htt ps://mastercirculars.rbi.org.in . \n \nYours faithfully  \n \n \n(R. Kamalakannan) \nChief General Manager  \n \n \nEncl.: As above  \n \n [2]  Master Circular \u2013Disbursement of Government Pension by Agency Banks  \nIntroduction \nPayment of pension to retired  government employees, including payment of basic \npension,  increased Dearness  Relief  (DR),  and other  benefits  as and when  announced \nby the governments, is governed by the relevant schemes prepared by concerned \nMinistries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments. This Master Circular consolidates important instructions on the subject issued by the Reserve Bank of India till March 31, 2022  (listed in Appendix ). It does not replace or supersede any \nexisting government instructions on the matter. The instructions issued by Pension Sanctioning  Authority  of the Central and State  Governments  and circulated  by RBI in \nthe past  will continue  to remain in operation subject  to changes  being made by the \ncompetent authority. In case of any doubt or apparent contradiction, agency banks may \nbe guided by the relevant government instructions. Contents of various circulars issued in this connection by the Reserve Bank of India are summarized here under.  \n \n General Instructions \n \nGovernment orders on DR, etc. on websites \n \n2.   In order to obviate the time lag between issue of DR orders and payment of DR to \nthe beneficiary and to render expeditious service to senior citizens, it has been decided \nto discontinue the procedure of forwarding gov ernment orders in respect of dearness \nrelief etc. to pension paying agency banks. Agency Banks may, therefore, act on the copies of government orders supplied by government to them through post, fax, e- mails \nor by accessing from the website and authorize t heir pension paying branches to make \npayments to the pensioners immediately.  \n \nPrompt implementation of Government\u2019s instructions by agency banks  \n \n3.   All agency banks are advised to scrupulously follow all the guidelines/ instructions \ncontained in various notifications of Government (Central as well as States) and take necessary action immediately without waiting for any further instructions from RBI.  [3]   \nTiming of pension disbursement by agency banks.  \n4.   The pension paying banks will credit the pension amount in the accounts of the \npensioners based on the instructions given by respective Pension Paying Authorities.  \n    Refund of excess pension payment to Government  \n \n5. Whenever  any excess/overpayment  is detected the entire  amount  thereof  should \nbe credited to the Go vernment account in lump sum immediately when the \nexcess/overpayment is due to an error on the part of the agency bank. This action is \nindependent of recovery from the pensioner.  Agency banks are requested to seek \nguidance from respective Pension Sanctioni ng Authorities regarding the process to be \nfollowed for recovery of excess pension paid to the pensioners, if any.  \n \n6. If the excess/wrong payment to the pensioner is due to errors committed by the \ngovernment, banks may take up the matter with the full partic ulars of the cases with \nrespective Government Department for a quick resolution of the matter. However, this must be a time bound exercise and the government authority\u2019s acknowledgement to this \neffect must be kept on the bank\u2019s record. The banks may take up such cases with \ngovernment departments without reference to the Reserve Bank of  India.  \n \n    Withdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners \n \n7.   In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners \nin withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorise \nsuch pensioners asunder:  \n \n(a) Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the \nbank.  \n(b) Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present  in the bank but also not \neven able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form due to certain physical defect /incapacity.  \n8.   With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their \naccounts, banks may follow the procedure as  under:  [4]   \n(a) Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should \nbe identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom \nshould be a responsible bank  official.  \n \n(b) Where the pensioner cannot even put his /her thumb/ toe impression and also \nwould not be able to be physically present  in the bank,  a mark  can be obtained  \non the cheque/withdrawal form, which should be identified by two independent \nwitnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank  official.  \n \n9. The pensioner may also be asked to indicate to the bank as to who would \nwithdraw the pension amount from the bank on the basis of cheque/ withdrawal form as obtained above and that person should be identified by two independent witnesses. The person who would be actually drawing the money from the bank should be asked to furnish his signature to the bank . \n 10. Accordingly, the agency banks are requested to instruct their branches to display \nthe instructions issued in this regard on their notice board so that sic k and disabled \npensioners could make full use of these facilities. Agency Banks are also advised to \nstrictly implement the instructions issued by RBI regarding the facilities to be provided to the sick and disabled persons and sensitise staff members in the matter and to refer to \nthe FAQs  on pension disbursement hosted on our website www.rbi.org.in in case of any  \ndoubt.  \n \n    Reimbursement of pension payments \n \n11.   Link branches of agency banks may submit reimbursement claims to Reserve \nBank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur / Government Banking Division at Regional Office for Central/State Government pension payments.  \n \n    Continuation of either  or survivor pension account after death of pensioner  \n \n12.   All agency banks disbursing Central Government pension have been advised that \nin case the spouse (Family pensioner) opts for existing joint account for credit of family pension, banks should not insi st on opening a new account when the spouse is the [5]  survivor and having a joint account with the pensioner and in whose favour an \nauthorisation for payment of family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order(PPO).  \n   Life Certificate - Issuance of Acknowledgement  \n \n13. There have been complaints  that life certificates  submitted over the counter  of \npension paying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instruc ted to \nmandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also advised to consider \nentering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as real time updation of  records.  \n \n   Single Window System for reimbursement of Pension Payments \n \n14. Single Window System was introduced to facilitate prompt settlement of \nreimbursement claims and reconciliation. The underlying objective is to make each \npension paying bank responsible in its own right to effect settlement without the intervention of RBI Offices or SBI (at District Headquarters) in the process eliminating cause of delay in reimbursement  claims.  \n \n    Customer Service \n \n15. All agency banks may issue inst ructions to their dealing branches to adhere to the \nrecommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee relating to pension payments. A checklist may be provided to the inspecting officers/auditors, which may at a minimum \ninclude the items given in Annex 1. Agency banks may also instruct their internal \nauditors/inspectors to comment on the quality of customer service in their reports which may be made available to Reserve Bank\u2019s inspecting officers, as and when they visit the \nbranches.  \n \n16. Grievances of pensioners are not being addressed properly at the branch level \nespecially after the setting up of Centralised Pension Processing Centres (CPPCs). To provide hassle free service to the pensioners, there should be a forum for regular \ninteracti on and settlement of grievances. Accordingly, agency banks should appoint [6]  one/two nodal  officers  at each Region/Zone  for monitoring the resolution of grievances  \nof pensioners on regular basis and the GM/CGM concerned should review the position at \nmonthly i ntervals . \n \n17. At locations  outside the CPPCs,  there should be designated  nodal  officers  for \npension related complaints who should be easily accessible to pensioners and who \nshould hold regular meetings at different locations in their jurisdiction on the lines  of \nPension Adalat. Each bank should establish toll free dedicated pension line manned by trained persons with access to the database to answer queries, note down and redress  \ncomplaints.  \n \n18. Following several complaints from pensioners alleging inordinate del ay in disbursing \nrevised pension and arrears, agency banks are advised asunder:  \n \n(a) Pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in crediting pension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for the delayafterthedued ateofpaymentandthecompensationshallbecreditedtothe \npensioner's account automatically without any claim from the pensioner on the same day when the bank affords credit for revised pension/ pension arrears, in \nrespect of all delayed pension payments made since October 1,  2008.  \n(b) Pension paying banks have been advised to put in place a mechanism to obtain \nimmediately the copies of pension orders from the pension paying authorities \ndirectly and make payments without waiting for receipt of instructions from the \nReserve Bank of India so that pensioners should get benefits announced by the \nGovernments in the succeeding month's pension payment  itself.  \n(c) When the agency bank is calculating pension, the branch should continue to be a \npoint of referral for the pensioner lest he/she feel  disenfranchised.  \n(d) All branches having pension accounts should guide and assist the pensioners in \nall their dealings with the bank.  \n(e) Suitable arrangements should be made to place the arithmetic and other details \nabout pension calculations on the web, to be made available to the pensioners \nthrough the net or at the branches at periodic interval as may be necessary and \nsufficient advertisement is made about such arrangements.  \n [7]  (f) All claims for agency commission by banks in respect of pension payment s must \nbe accompanied by a certificate from ED/CGM in charge of government business \nthat there are no pension arrears to be credited/ delays in crediting regular \npension/arrears  thereof.  \n(g) All agency banks disbursing pension are advised to provide considerat e and \nsympathetic customer service to the pensioners, especially to those pensioners \nwho are of old age. [8]  Annex 1  \n \nChecklist  relating  to Government  Business  (pension related)  for \ninternal/concurrent  audit  \n \nInternal  inspections  should assess branch performa nce in servicing  pensioner  \ncustomers. In this regard, the following may be ensured:  \n \n1. A specific  questionnaire covering all aspects  of pension payment  may be devised for \nuse during inspection of pension paying branches.  \n2. Inspecting officers may also, during inspections, call up pensioners at random and \nenquire about their satisfaction with pension -related services.  \n3. A detailed check -list relating to pension payments/government  business  may be given  \nby banks to internal auditors/inspectors in order to adhere to  the recommendations of \nthe Prabhakar Rao Committee, constituted by the Government of India, relating to \npension payments/government  business.  \n \nThese include the following:  \n \n(a) Whether there is delay in payment of pension, revision of pension, revision in \ndearness relief  etc. \n(b) Whether the branch manager has structured interaction with a cross section of \npensioners serviced at the branch on quarterly basis, where the number of pensioners  of all governments  and departments  exceeds  affixed number,  say, \n100 or  200. \n(c) Whether nominations have been obtained for all pension accounts.  \n(d) Whether pension accounts have been converted into joint accounts wherever \napplicable.  \n(e) Whether  the bank  branch has an effective  complaint  redressal  mechanism  and \nthe complaints of pensioners are attended promptly and their grievances \nredressed expeditiously.  [9]  (f) Whether  the pension is credited to pensioner\u2019s  account  during the last four \nworking days  of the month except  for the month of March  for which  pension  is to \nbe credited on or after first w orking day of  April.  \n(g) Whether the pension paying branch obtains Life Certificate/ Non- employment \ncertificate/Employment  Certificate  from the pensioners  in the month  of November \nevery  year.  \n(h) Whether pension paying branches deduct income tax at source from pension \npayments wherever  applicable.  \n(i) Whether paper tokens in acknowledgement of cheques presented are invariably \ngiven by the tax collecting branches.  \n(j) Whether the challans are stamped giving bank\u2019s BSR code and Challan \nIdentification Number (CIN)  clearly.  \n(k) Whether the stamped challans are kept in the custody of bank\u2019s staff and handed \nover to the concerned tax payer only on production of the paper  token.

The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the \nCentral and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the \nagency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual agreement. \nRBI pays agency co mmission to the a gency banks for the g overnment business \nhandled by them. This Master Circular consolidates the instructions contained in the \ncirculars listed in Annex  1. \nGovernment transactions eligible for agency commission \n2. Transactions relat ing to the following government business undertaken by \nagency banks are eligible for agency commission paid by RBI : \n(a) Revenue receipts and payments on behalf of the Central/State Government s \n(b) Pension payments in respect of Central / State Governments  and \n(c) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank as eligible for \nagency commission  \n \n3. The Agency banks also undertake the work related to Small Savings Schemes  \n(SSS)  the commission for which is borne by Government of India.   Though the \nsettlement of commission on such SSS is processed by RBI  and settled at Central \nAccounts Section (CAS), Nagpur , the rates of agency commission related to SSS \ntransactions  are decided by Government of India.  Agency commission claims on \nSpecial Deposit Scheme ( SDS) related transactions (where mirror accounts are \nmaintained in RBI) are also settled at CAS, Nagpur.  \n4. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from \nfinancial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commissi on as these \ntransactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business.  Reserve Bank pays the agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for \nacting as agents for management of public debt.  \n5. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical mode or e -mode \n(challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the agency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive \nremuneration from the State Government for doing this work.  \n6. If the agency bank is engaged by the State Government as Franking Vendor \nand it collects stamp duty from the public for franking the documents, it will not be \neligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to it \nas Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects  the stamp duty paid by \nthe Franking Vendor for credit to the Treasury through challan in physical or e- mode \nfor purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since it is a \nregular paym ent of Stamp Duty as stated above.  \n 3 \n  Government transactions not eligible for agency commission \n7. Agency banks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or \nthrough authorised branches of any other agency bank including State Bank of India \nor offices of Reserve Bank of India wherever they do not have their own authorised \ndirect tax collection branch should indicate the same separately in the scroll. Such \ntransactions will not be eligible for payment of agency commission. Banks should \nfurnish a certificate to the effect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) \npaid by them have been excluded while claiming agency commission.  \n8. The following activities , inter alia,  do not come under the purview of agency \nbank business and are therefore not eligible for payment of agency commission.  \n(a) Furnishing of bank guarantees/security deposits, etc . through agency  banks by \ngovernment contractors/suppliers, which constitute banking transactions undertaken by banks for their customers.  \n(b) The banking business of autonomous/statutory bodies /Municipalities / \ncompanies/  Corporations/Local Bodies.    \n(c) Payments which have been classified as capital in nature by government to \ncover losses incurred by autonomous/statutory bodies/ Municipalities/ \nCorporations/Local Bodies  etc. \n(d) Prefunded schemes which may be implemented by a Central Government \nMinistry/Department (in consultation with CGA) or  a State Government \nDepartment through any bank .  \n(e) Transactions related to Gold Monetisation Scheme,  2015  \n \n(f) Transactions arising out of Letters of Credit / Bank Guarantee opened by banks on behalf of Ministries/Departments etc. do not qualify for agency commission as RBI only reimburses the paid amount to the banks based on the mandate \nreceived from the governments.  \n \n(g) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank or Central or State \nGovernment as ineligible for agency commission.  \n9. Agency Banks are advised to meticulously follow ins tructions issued by RBI \nfrom time to time regarding transactions which are not eligible for agency commission \nand submit their claims for agency commission accordingly. All agency banks while \nclaiming agency commission should certify that no claim of agenc y commission is \nmade on ineligible transactions.  \n \n \n 4 \n 10. Reporting of transactions by agency banks to RBI : After the \noperationalisation of NEFT 24X7 and RTGS 24X 7, agency banks authorised to collect \nGoods and Service Tax ( GST) shall upload their luggage files in RBI\u2019s QPX/E- Kuber \non all days except the Global holidays, which are January 26, August 15, October 2, \nall non- working Saturdays, all Sundays and any other day declared holiday by RBI for \nGovernment Transactions due to exigencies .  \n11. State government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) of \nprevious month reported after 8th of the succeeding month and those pertaining to earlier months should be reported to RBI through a separate statement for accounting, \nafter being confirmed by the competent authorities of concerned S tate government.  \n12. For Central Government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) \nor any adjustments thereof , if reported after a gap of 90 days from the date of \ntransaction, agency banks have to obtain prior approval from concerned ministry/department and submit the same to RBI separately at the time of reporting \nsuch transactions for settlement.   \nRates for agency commission \n13. As per a gency bank agreement, RBI pays agency commiss ion at rates \ndetermined by it. The rates applicable with effect from July 1, 2019 are as under:  \nSr. No. Type of Transaction  Unit Revised Rate  \na.  (i) Receipts - Physical mode  Per transaction   \u20b940/- \n     (ii) Receipts - e-mode Per transaction  \u20b99/- \nb. Pension Payments  Per transaction  \u20b975/- \nc. Payments other than \nPension  Per \u20b9100 turnover  6.5 paise per \u20b9100 \n \n14. In this context, the \u2018Receipts -e-mode transactions\u2019 indicated against Sr. No. \na.(ii) in  the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from \nthe remitter\u2019s bank account through I nternet banking as well as such transactions  \nwhich do not involve physical  receipt of cash /instruments  at all . For example,  challan \ngenerated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with cash / instrument \nshould be treated as transaction under physical mode.   \n \n15. With reference to the implementation of GST regime, it is advised that a single \nCommon Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number (CIN), under GST payment process, may \nbe treated as a single transaction, even if multiple major head/sub major head/minor \nhead of accounts are credited. This means that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. \npaid through a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such \nrecords clubbed under a single challan i.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commissi on effective J uly 1, 2017.  \n 5 \n 16. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that \na single challan (electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only \nand not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains multiple major head/sub \nmajor  head/minor head of accounts that will get credited.  Therefore, records clubbed \nunder a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission.   \n17. Agency banks would be eligible to claim agency commission for pension \ntransactions at the rate of \u20b975 per transaction only when the entire work relating to \ndisbursement of pension including pension calculation is attended to by the m. If the \nwork relating to pension calculations etc. is attended to by the concerned Government \nDepartment / Treasury and the bank s are required only to credit the amount of pension \nto the pensioners' accounts maintained with them by a single debit to Government Account, such transaction is to be categorised under \u2018other than pension payment\u2019 and \nwould be eligible for payment of agency commission @ 6.5 paise per \u20b9  100/- turnover \nw.e.f. July 1, 2019 . \n18. The number of transactions eligible for payment of agency commission should \nnot exceed 14 per pensioner per year.  This includes one monthly credit for payment of net pension and a maximum of two per year for payment of arrears on account of \nincrease in dearness relief, if applicable. Cases involving payment of arrears on \naccount of late start/restart of pension qualifies as a single transaction for claiming of \nagency commission. In other words, any payment of arrears on account of late \nstart/restart of pension should be treated as a single credit transaction and not as \nseparate monthly credits.  \n19. Agency commission is payable to an agency bank at the full rate provided the \ntransactions are handled by the bank at all stages.  Where, however, the work is shared \nbetween two banks, the agency commission is shared between the banks in the \nproportion of 75:25.  Thus, broadly, the agency commission is payable to the agency  \nbanks as detailed below:  \n(a) At the full rate, in cases where the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages, i.e. , up to the stage of dispatch of scrolls and challans / cheques to the \nPay a nd Accounts Offices,  and treasuries/sub- treasuries .  \n(b) At 75% of the applicable rate, where the dealing branch is required to account \nfor the transaction by passing on the scrolls and documents to the local/nearest branch of Reserve Bank of India or by any agency bank conducting government \nbusiness.  \n(c) At 25% of the applicable rate, in the case of agency branch which received the \nscrolls and documents from dealing branches of other banks and is responsible \nfor the account ing of these transactions and dispatching of the scrolls and \ndocuments to the Pay and Accounts Offices, Treasuries, etc.  \n20. All agency banks should settle their agency transactions for both funds and \nagency commission directly with the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank 6 \n instead of routing them through any other agency bank that acts as aggregator in \ncertain cases.  So also for payments made by all agency banks on behalf of S tate \ngovernment/s get directly settled with the concerned Regional Office of RBI. Agency Transaction details/scrolls may be sent directly by individual agency bank to the \nconcerned State Government/Treasury.\n This new arrangement for settlement of S tate \ngovernment funds on day to day basis (receipts and payments) directly with Reserve \nBank is with effect from January 1, 2018.  \n \nClaiming agency commission  \n21. Agency banks are required to submit their claims for agency commission in the \nprescribed format to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions and \nthe respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for  State government \ntransactions.  However, agency commission claims with respect to GST receipt \ntransactions will be settled at Mumbai Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India only \nand accordingly all agency banks, authorized to collect GST, are advised to submit \ntheir agency commission claims pertaining to GST receipt transactions at Mumbai \nRegional Office only. The formats for claiming agency commission for all agency banks \nand separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the branch officials and \nChartered Accountants or Cost Accountants are given in Annex 2, Annex 2A  and \nAnnex 2B  respectively . These certificates would be in addition to the usual Certificate \nfrom ED / CGM (in charge of government business) to the effect that there are no \npension arrears to be credited / delays in crediting regular pension / arrears thereof . \n22. Where the External Auditor is also the Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor, \nclaims can be certified by  such Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor. In addition to \nthis, agency banks are required to ensure that the agency bank\u2019s internal inspectors / auditors verify the agency commission claims submitted by their branches and confirm \ntheir accuracy during t he course of their inspection / audit.   \n23. Reference is also drawn to the instructions contained in our letter dated \nNovember 4, 2016 advising the process of claiming reimbursement of service tax (ST) on agency commission received for Central and State Gover nment transactions, \ncentrally from Reserve Bank of India at Central Accounts Section, Nagpur. The same process continued even after Service Tax got subsumed into the Goods and Service \nTax (GST) framework. This process of centralised claims submission has been \nreplaced with a system whereby applicable GST (18% at present) shall be paid along \nwith agency commission by the respective Regional Offices of RBI / CAS, Nagpur as \nthe case may be.  \n24. For eligible government transactions done with effect from July 01, 2019, \nagency banks shall submit the agency commission claims, including applicable GST \namount, as per revised agency commission rates indicated above, to RBI at respective \nROs / CAS, Nagpur as per the extant instructions issued by RBI in this regard. TDS on \nGST shall be deducted as applicable by RBI at the time of making agency commission payment in accordance with Government instructions in the matter.  7 \n 25. However, for eligible government transactions done by agency banks upto June \n30, 2019, agency banks shall c ontinue to submit agency commission claims as well as \nthe centralized claims for ST/GST reimbursement as hitherto.  \n26. Agency banks are required to ensure that agency commission claims submitted \nto the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India / Central Accounts Section, Nagpur \nas applicable in the prescribed format are accurate.  Agency banks may also alert their \nbranches concerned to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to our \nRegional Offices are accurate.  Such erroneous claims, if certified by the Internal / \nConcurrent Auditors, will defeat the very purpose of making such requirement an \nessential condition for making quarterly claims.  \n27. Agency banks are advised to furnish their claim on agency commission to \nReserve Bank within 60 calendar days from the end of the quarter in which the \ntransactions have been conducted.  If the banks fail to lodge the claims within the stipulated period mentioned above they may forward the same to RBI only after giving \nreasons for delay.   \n  \nPenal interest for  wrong claims \n \n28.  As per the agreement that agency banks have with RBI, violation or non-\ncompliance of inst ructions issued by Government or  Reserve Bank shall attract \nimposition of penalty.  Agency banks will be liable to pay penal interest at Bank Rate \nas notified by Reserve Bank of India plus 2% for any wrong claims of agency \ncommission settled.  \n \n  \n \n 8 \n Annex 1 \nList of circulars consolidated in the Master Circular  \n \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

Guarantees \n \n1.1 Issue of Guarantees  \n \n1.1.1  Broad Guidelines \n \nIn view of the risks involved in the business of issuance of guarantees,  \nthe Primary  (Urban)  Co-operative Banks  (UCBs)  should extend  \nguarantees within restricted limits so that their financial position is not  \nimpaired.  The banks  should follow certain broad guidelines in respect   of \ntheir guarantee business  as indicated in the following  paragraphs.  \n \n1.1.2  Purpose  \n \n(i) As a general rule, banks may provide only financial guarantees  and \nnot performance guarantees.  \n \n(ii) However, scheduled banks may issue performance guarantees on \nbehalf of their constituents subject to exercising due caution in the  \nmatter.  \n \n1.1.3  Maturity  \n \nIt would be desirable for U CBs to confine their guarantees to relatively  \nshort -term maturities. Guarantees  should  not be issued for periods  \nexceeding ten years in any  case.  \n \n1.1.4  Volume \n \nThe total volume of guarantee obligations outstanding at any time may  \nnot exceed 10 per cent of the total owned resources  of the bank  \ncomprising paid up capital, reserves and deposits. Within the overall  \nceiling, proportion of unsecured guarantees outstanding at any time may \nbe limited to an amount equivalent to 25%  of the owned funds  (paid up \ncapital + reserves) of the bank or 25% of the total amount of  guarantees, \nwhichever  is less.  \n \n1.1.5  Secured Guarantees  \n \nBanks  should preferably  issue  secured guarantees.  A secured  \nguarantee means  a guarantee made on the security  of assets (including \ncash margin), the market value of which will not at any time be less than \nthe amount  of the contingent  liability  on the guarantee,  or  a guarantee  \nfully covered by counter  guarantee/s  of the Central  Government,  State  \nGovernments,  public  sector  financial  institutions  and / or insurance \ncompanies.  4   \n1.1.6  Unsecured Guarantees  \n \nBanks  should avoid undue concentration of unsecured guarantee  \ncommitments to particular groups of customers and / or trades. The  \nbanks' Board of Directors should fix suitable proportions for issuance of  \nunsecured guarantees on behalf of any individual constituent so that  \nthese guarantees do not exceed  a - \n \n(a) reasonable proportion of the total obligations in respect of  \nunsecured guarantees  provided by the bank  to all such  constituents  \nat any time, and \n \n(b) reasonable  multiple  of the shareholdings  in the bank.  \n \n1.1.7  Deferred Payment Guarantees  \n \n(i) Banks  should generally provide deferred payment  guarantees  \nbacked by adequate tangible securities  or by counter guarantees of the \nCentral or  the State Government or public  sector  financial  institutions  or \nof insurance companies  and other  banks.  \n \n(ii) Banks, which intend to issue deferred payment guarantees on  \nbehalf of their borrowers for acquisition of capital assets should ensure \nthat the total c redit facilities including the proposed deferred payment  \nguarantees  do not exceed the prescribed exposure ceilings . \n \n(iii) The proposals  for deferred payment  guarantees  should be \nexamined having regard to the profitability / cash flows of the project to ensure that sufficient surpluses are generated by the borrowing unit to  \nmeet the commitments as a bank has to meet the liability at regular  \nintervals  in respect  of the instalments  due. The criteria  generally  followed \nfor appraising a term loan proposal for acquis ition of capital  assets  \nshould also be applied  while  issuing  deferred payment                                     guarantees.  \n \n1.2  Guarantees in respect  of Commodities covered under  Selective \nCredit Controls  \n \nUCBs should not issue, either to a Court or to Government, or any other  \nperson,  a guarantee on behalf  of or on account  of any importers  guaranteeing \npayment of customs duty and / or import duty, or other levies,  payable in \nrespect of import of essential commodities without taking, as  security for \nissue  of such guarantees, a cash margin equivalent to at least  one half of the \namount payable under the guarantee. The term \"essential  commodities\" shall \nmean such commodities as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of  India \nfrom time to time.  5  1.3 Safeguards in Issuance of Guarantees  \n \nWhile  issuing  financial  guarantees,  banks  should observe the following  \nsafeguards:  \n \n(i) UCBs shall appraise the proposals for guarantees with the same diligence \nas in the case of fund based limits and such assessments shall inter alia  \nfactor in the presence of security, adequate margin, etc., or otherwise.  \n \n(ii) Bank guarantees should be issued in security forms serially numbered to \nprevent  issuance of fake guarantees.  \n \n(iii) Guarantees above a particular cut off point, as may be decided by  each \nbank, should be issued under two signatures in triplicate, one copy  each for \nthe branch, beneficiary and Controlling Office / Head Office. It  should be \nbinding on the part of the beneficiary to seek confirmation of the Cont rolling \nOffice / Head Office as well for which a specific stipulation be incorporated in \nthe guarantee itself.  \n \n(iv) The guarantees should not normally be allowed to the customers who \ndo not enjoy  credit  facilities  with the banks  but only maintain current  \naccounts. If any requests are received from such customers, the banks  \nshould subject the proposals to thorough scrutiny and satisfy themselves  \nabout  the genuine need of the customers.  Banks  should be satisfied  that \nthe customers  would  be in a position to meet  the claims  under  the \nguarantees, when received, and not approach the bank for credit facility in  \nthis regard. For this purpose the banks should enquire into the financial  \nposition of the customers,  the source of funds  from which  they would be in \na position to meet the liability and prescribe a suitable margin and obtain  \nother security, as necessary. The banks  may also call for the detailed  \nfinancial statements and Wealth- tax / Income -tax returns of the customer to  \nsatisfy themselves of their financial status. The observations of the banks in \nrespect of  all these points  should be recorded in banks' books.  \n \n(v) Where the customers  enjoy  credit  facilities  with other  banks,  the \nreasons for their approaching the bank for extending the guarantees should  \nbe ascertained and invariably, a reference should be made to their existing  \nbankers  with whom  they are enjoying credit facilities.  \n \n(vi) Banks, when approached to issue guarantees in favour of other banks  \nfor grant of credit facilities by another bank, should examine thoroughly the  \nreasons  for approaching another  bank  for grant  of credit  facilities  and satisfy \nthemselves of the need for doing so. This should be recorded in bank's  \nbooks.  \n \nWhen it is considered necessary  to issue  such  guarantees,  the banks  \nconcerned should ensure that the relative guarantee document, beyond a  \nstipulated amount,  should not be signed singly  but by two authorised officials \njointly after obtaining proper sanction and authority and proper  record of such \nguarantee issued being maintained. The credit proposals  should be 6  subjected to usual scrutiny by the lending bank ensuring that the  proposals  \nconform  to the prescribed norms  and guidelines  and credit  facilities are \nallowed only if the bank is satisfied about the merits of the proposal  and the \navailability  of another  bank's  guarantee should not result  in a dilution of \nthe standards  of evaluation of the proposal  and financial                    discipline  in \nlending.  \n \n1.4 Payment  under  Bank  Guarantees - Immediate  Settlement  of Cases  \n \n(i) Government of India and Reserve Bank of India have been receiving a  \nnumber  of complaints  on non-payment  or delay  in payment  of bank  \nguarantees upon invocation.  \n \n \n(ii)   The bank guarantee is a commitment made by the issuing bank to  make   \npayment  to the beneficiary  (albeit  at the behest  of the bank's  constituent). \nFailure on the part of the bank to honour the claim legitimately  made on it \nprojects  a distorted picture of its functioning.  \n \n(iii) In fact some strictures were passed by Courts in the past against  banks  \nfor not honouring the guarantee commitments  promptly. In this connection, \nan extract of a judgment pronounced by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in a \ncase on the issue of injunctions obtained by parties from courts  restraining  \npayment of  invoked guarantees is  appended :  \n \n\"We are therefore, of the opinion that the correct position of law is that  \ncommitment of banks must be honoured free from interference by the \ncourts and it is only in exceptional cases, that is to say, in case of fraud  \nor in case  where irretrievable  injustice  would be done,  if bank  guarantee  \nis allowed  to be encashed, the court should interfere.\"  \n \n(iv) The UCBs should, therefore, honour  bank guarantees issued by them \npromptly on their invocation as reluctance on their part to honour \ncommitments in respect of invoked guarantees tend to bring the banking  \nsystem  into disrepute.  \n \n1.5 Delay  in Obtaining Certified  Copies of Judgments \n \n(i) The Ministry of Finance has advised that some of the Departments  such \nas Department of Revenue, Govt. of India, are finding it difficult to execute \njudgments delivered by various courts in their favour as banks do not honour \ntheir guarantees unless certified copies of the court judgments  are made \navailable to them.  \n \n(ii) Keeping in view these difficulties,  banks  may follow the following  \nprocedure:  \n \n(a) Where the bank is a party to the proceeding initiated by \nGovernment for enforcement of bank guarantee and the case is decided \nin favour of the  Government  by the Court,  bank  should not insist  on 7  production of certified   copy  of the judgment  as the judgment  order  is \npronounced in open                                            court in the presence of the parties / their counsels \nand the judgment is  known to the bank  and a copy of the judgement is \navailable on websites of the Courts . \n \n(b) In case the bank is not a party to the proceeding, a signed copy of  \nthe minutes of the order certified by the Registrar / Deputy or Assistant  \nRegistrar of the High Court duly attested to be true copy by Govt.  \nCounsel should be sufficient for honouring the obligation under the  \nguarantees  unless  the guarantor  bank  decides  to file any appeal  against \nthe order  of the High Court.  \n \n1.6 Correspondence with Government  Departments  \n \n(i) The Constitution of India states that all executive action relating to Union  \nof India shall be, and shall be stated  to be, in the name of President                                            of India. \nHowever, the business of the Government of India is transacted through \nseveral ministries / departments and even though documents such as \nguarantees  reflect  the President  of India  as one of the parties,  \ncorrespondence is not to be exchanged with the President of India but with \nconcerned Government  Ministry  / Departments.  \n \n(ii) The banks should, therefore, ensure that any correspondence relating  \nto guarantees furnished by the banks in the name of the President of India  \nfavouring the Government Departments should not be addressed to the President  of India causing avoidable inconvenience to the President's  \nSecretariat.  \n \n2. Co-acceptance of Bills  \n \n2.1 Irregularities in Co-acceptance  of Bills  \n \n(i) Banks  have been co-accepting  bills of their customers.  On many  \noccasions these bills turn out to be accommodation bills drawn by groups of  \nsister concerns on each other where no genuine trade transaction takes  \nplace. Such bills on maturity are not honoured by the drawees and the banks  \nwhich  have co-accepted the bills have to make payment  of these bills \nand thereafter, they find it difficult to recover the amount from the drawers / drawees of bills. This happens because the financial  position and capacity of \nthe parties to honour the bills, in the event of need, is not gone into by the banks co- accepting the bills.  \n \n(ii) There have also been cases  where the particulars  regarding co- \nacceptance of bills are not recorded in the bank's books with the result that  \nthe extent of co- acceptance cannot be verified during inspections and the  \nHead Office becomes aware of the co- acceptance only when a claim is  \nreceived from the discounting bank.  \n  \n 8  2.2 Safeguards \n \nIn view of the above,  banks  should keep in view the following  safeguards:  \n \n(i) While sanctioning co- acceptance limits to their customers, the need  \ntherefor e should be ascertained and such limits should be extended only to  \ntheir customers  enjoying other limits with the bank.  \n \n(ii) Only genuine trade bills should be co- accepted and the banks should  \nensure that the goods covered by bills co- accepted are actually received in  \nthe stock accounts of  the borrowers.  \n \n(iii) The valuation of the goods as mentioned in the accompanying invoice  \nshould also be  verified  to see that there is no over valuation of stocks.  \n \n(iv) The banks should not extend their co- acceptance to house bills /  \naccommodation bills drawn  by group concerns  on one another.  \n \n(v) The powers to co- accept bills, beyond a stipulated limit, must be  \nexercised by two  authorised officials jointly.  \n \n(vi) Proper records of the bills co- accepted for each customer should be \nmaintained  so that the commitments  for each customer  and the total \ncommitments at a branch can be readily ascertained and these should be  \nscrutinised by internal inspectors  and commented upon  in their reports.  \n \n(vii) Proper  periodical  returns  may be prescribed so that the Branch  \nManagers report such co- acceptance commitments entered into by them to  \nthe controlling offices. Such returns should also reveal the position of bills  \nthat have become overdue and which the bank had to meet under the co-  \nacceptance  obligation.  This will enable the controlling  offices  to monitor  \nsuch co -acceptances furnished by the branches and take suitable action in  \ntime, in difficult cases.  \n \n3. Letters of Credit  (LCs)  \n \n3.1 Guidelines  for Grant  of LCs Facility  \n \nUCBs should not normally  grant  LC facilities  in respect of parties who \nmaintain only nominal current accounts. In case of     borrowers maintaining \nonly current accounts, who approach for opening of  LCs, banks should \ninvariably ascertain from the existing bankers of the borrowers the reasons \nas to why they are not extending LC facilities to the  concerned borrowers. \nBanks should open LCs in respect of such parties  only after making proper \nenquiries in regard to the antecedents of the borrowers from the bankers with \nwhom the parties are enjoying main limits,  their financial position and their \nability to retire the bills. They should also prescribe a suitable  margin and \nobtain other  security, as  necessary.  \n \n 9  3.2 LCs for Commodities  covered under  Selective Credit  Controls \n \nThere is no restriction for the banks in opening LCs for import of essential  \nitems. However, banks are not permitted to open inland LCs, providing a  \nclause therein which w ould enable other banks to discount usance bills  under \nthe LCs.  \n \n3.3 Safeguards in Opening of LCs \n \nBefore opening LCs, banks  should ensure that : \n \n(i) LCs are issued in security  forms  only;  \n \n(ii) Large LCs are issued under two authorised signatures where one of  the \nsignatures for LCs should be from the Head Office / Controlling Office.  As the \nneed for large LCs may not arise overnight, with the availability of  courier \nservice, speed post service etc., this procedure may not result in delay. In \nthe LCs itself a column may be provided to indicate the authority  who had \nsanctioned it together with the particulars  thereof;  \n \n(iii) LCs are not issued for amounts out of proportion to the borrowers'  \ngenuine requirements and these are opened only after ensuring that the  \nborrowers have made adequate arrangements for retiring the bills received  \nunder  LCs out of their own resources  or from the existing  borrowing  \narrangements;  \n \n(iv) where LCs are for purchase of raw materials, borrowers  do not \nmaintain unduly high inventory of raw materials  in relation to the norms /  past \ntrends. Where such LCs are to be opened on D/A basis, credit on the relative \npurchase is duly taken into account for the purpose of working out  drawing  \npower  in cash credit  accounts;  \n \n(v) in the case  of borrowers  having banking arrangements  on a \nconsortium basis, the LCs are opened within the sanctioned limit on the basis \nof the agreed share of each of the banks. Member -banks should not,  \nhowever, open LCs outside the sanctioned limits without the knowledge of  \nthe lead bank /  other  banks;  \n \n(vi) if there is no formal  consortium  arrangement  for financing the \nborrower, LCs should not be opened by the existing bank or a new bank,  \nwithout the knowledge of  the other  banks;  \n \n(vii) LCs for acquisition of capital goods should be opened only after  banks \nhave satisfied themselves about tying up of funds for meeting the relative \nliability by way of providing for long term funds or term loans from  financial  \ninstitutions /  banks;  \n \n(viii) In no case, working capital limits should be allowed to be utilised for  \nretiring bills pertaining to acquisition of capital assets.  \n \n(ix) Banks should not extend any non- fund based facilities or additional /  10  ad-hoc credit facilities to parties who are not their  (the bank's) regular  \nconstituents  for their production finance requirements;  nor should they \ndiscount bills drawn under LCs or otherwise for beneficiaries who are not  \ntheir regular clients. In case it becomes unavoidably necessary to provide  \nsuch a facility to a party not being a regular client, banks should invariabl y \nseek the prior concurrence of the existing banker of the borrowers and also  \nmake proper enquiries in regard to the antecedents of the borrowers, their  \nfinancial  position  and ability to  retire  the bills  etc. in  time.  \n \n(x) With effect from March 30, 2012 in case of bills drawn under LCs  \nrestricted  to a particular  UCB,  and the beneficiary  of the LC is not a  borrower \nwho has been granted regular credit facility by that UCB, the UCB                                    concerned \nmay, as per their discretion and based on their perception about   the credit \nworthiness of the LC issuing bank, negotiate such LCs, subject to the \ncondition that the proceeds will be remitted to the regular banker of the \nbeneficiary of the LC. However, the prohibition regarding negotiation of  \nunrestricted LCs for borrowers who have not been sanctioned regular credit  \nfacilities  will continue to be in force.  \n \n(xi) UCBs negotiating bills as above, under restricted LCs, would have to  \nadhere to the instructions of the Reserve Bank / RCS or CRCS regarding  \nshare linking to borrowing and provisions of Co- operative Societies Act on  \nmembership \n \n3.4 Payment  under  LCs - Immediate Settlement  of Claims  \n \n(i) There have been a few instances where LCs were opened by officials  \nof banks in an unauthorised manner. In certain cases, the LCs transactions  \nwere not recorded in the books of the branch by officials issuing them, while  \nin some other  cases  the amounts  of LCs were  much in excess  of the \npowers  vested in them  for the purpose.  Subsequently  when the banks  \ncome to know  about  the fraudulent  issue  of LCs, they disclaim  liability  on \nthe ground that these are transactions involving a conspiracy / collusion between the beneficiary  and the constituent.  \n \n(ii) It may be appreciated that if the bills drawn under  LCs are not \nhonoured, it will adversely affect the character of LCs and the relative bills  as \nan accepted means of payment. This could also affect the credibility of  the \nentire payment mechanism through banks and affect the image of the  banks. \nIt is, therefore, necess ary that all the banks should honour their  commitments  \nunder  LCs and make  payments  promptly  leaving no opportunity for any \ncomplaints in this regard. Needless to say that banks  should take suitable \naction against the concerned officials as well as the cons tituents on whose \nbehalf the LCs are opened and the beneficiaries of  LCs, if  a criminal  \nconspiracy is involved.  \n \n    11  4. Other  Common  Guidelines \n \n4.1 Credit Exposure Norms and Statutory / Other Restrictions on Non-  \nfund Based Limits \n \n(i) UCBs are required to strictly observe exposure norms and statutory / \nother restrictions prescribed for non- fund based limits (e.g. LCs, Guarantees, \nCo-acceptances, etc.) as detailed in the  Master  Circular  on 'Exposure Norms  \nand Statutory  / Other  Restrictions  and other norms issued by RBI from time \nto time . \n \n(ii) The exposure ceilings  and other  restrictions  particularly  prescribed for \n \n \na) total credit  exposure including  non-fund based limits,  \n \nb) unsecured guarantees,  \n \nc) advances  to bank's  Directors,  \n \nd) loans  and advances  to relatives  of Directors, \n \ne) advances to nominal members,  \nmust be strictly observed.  \n4.2 Banks should ensure that the systems evolved for recording the details of  \noff-balance sheet transactions are properly followed by all branches. These \nrecords  should be periodically  balanced and internal  inspectors  should verify  \nthe same and offer  critical comments.  \n \n4.3 Banks  should ensure that unauthorised LCs are not issued.  \n \n4.4 Banks must lay down clear instructions for their branch staff in respect of  \nloan accounts where such non- funded facilities become funded on account of  \ndevolvement  of bills covered under  the bank's  LCs or due to invocation  of \nguarantees issued by the bank. The banks must evolve proper guidelines to  \nensure that, accounts where non- funded limits become \"funded\" are closely  \nmonitored and goods  covered under  devolved bills remain under  bank's  control  \n/ hypothecation, particularly where malafides are suspected. In cases of goods  \ncovered under import LCs, banks must also ensure immediate submission of  \ncustom's copy of the Bill of Entry and take measures as prescribed in the  \nguidelines  issued by  Foreign Exchange Department.  \n \n4.5 A number of banks adopt the practice of parking the dues of the borrower  \nin respect of devolved LCs and invoked guarantees in a separate account which  \nis not  a regular sanctioned facility. As a result, these are not reflected in the  \nprincipal operating account of the borrower. This renders application of the  \nprudential  norms  for identification of NPAs  difficult.  It is, therefore,  advised that \nif the debts arising out of devolvement of LCs or invoked guarantees are parked  12  in a separate account, the balance outstanding in that account also should be  \ntreated as a part of the borrower's principal operating account for the purpose of  \napplication of prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and  \nprovisioning.  \n \n4.6 Banks are encouraged to strengthen their information back up about the  \nborrowers enjoying credit facilities from multiple banks by obtaining declaration  \nfrom the borrowers about the credit facilities already enjoyed by them from other  \nbanks.  In the case of  existing  lenders,  all the banks  may seek  a declaration from \ntheir existing borrowers availing sanctioned limits of Rs. 5.00 crore and above  or \nwherever, it is in their knowledge that their  borrowers are availing credit  facilities \nfrom other banks and introduce a system of exchange of information with other \nbanks. Subsequently banks should exchange information about the conduct  of \nthe borrowers' accounts  with other  banks  at least  at quarterl y intervals. Banks \nshould also make use of CRILC or credit reports available from Credit  Information \nCompanies. The banks should incorporate suitable clauses in the loan \nagreements regarding exchange of credit information so as to address  \nconfidentiality  issues.  Banks  should also obtain regular  certification  by a \nprofessional, preferably a Company Secretary, Chartered Accountant or Cost  \nAccountant regarding compliance of various statutory prescriptions that are in  \nvogue. The formats for collecting informat ion from the borrowers, exchange of  \ninformation among banks and certification by a professional are furnished in our  \ncircular UBD.PCB.No.36/13.05.000/2008- 09 dated January 21, 2009 read with  \ncircular  UBD.PCB.No.59/13.05.000/2008- 09 dated April 9, 2009.  \n \n4.7 Banks are exposed to various risks in every financial transaction including  \ncommitme nts in the form of Guarantees,  Co-acceptances,  LCs etc. The \nmanagements of UCBs have to base their business decisions on sound risk  \nmanagement systems with the ultimate objective of protecting the interest of  \ndepositors  and stakeholders.  It is, therefore,  important  that UCBs  adopt  effective  \nAsset -Liability  Management  (ALM)  systems to address  the issues     related to \nliquidity, interest rate and currency risks. Banks should invariably  follow the ALM \nguidelines  issued by  Reserve Bank  in this regard.  \n \n 13  Annex  \n \nA.

RESTRICTIONS ON HOLDING SHARES IN OTHER CO -OPERATIVE  \nSOCIETIES \n \n1.1 Section 19 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co -operative \nSocieties) (BR Act, 1949 (AACS)) stipulates that no co -operative bank shall hold \nshares in any other co- operative society except to such extent and subject to such \nconditions as the Reserve Bank of India (Reserve Bank) may specify in that behalf. \nHowever, nothing contained in the section applies to - \n \n1.1.1  shares acquired through funds provided by the State Government for \nthat purpose;  \n1.1.2  in the case of a central co- operative bank, the holding of shares in the \nstate co- operative bank to which it is affiliated;  and \n1.1.3  in the case of a primary (urban) co- operative bank (UCB), holding of \nshares in the central co- operative bank to which it is affiliated or in the \nstate co- operative bank of the st ate in which it is  registered.  \n \n1.2 In pursuance of the powers conferred by S ection 19 read with S ection 56 of \nthe said Act, the Reserve Bank has specified that the extent and conditions subject to \nwhich co -operative banks may hold shares in any other co- operative society shall be \nas follows:  \n \n1.2.1 The total investments of a co- operative bank in the shares of co - \noperative institutions, other than those falling under any of the categories \nstated at paragraphs 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 above, shall not exceed 2 per cent of its owned funds (paid- up share capital and reserves).  \n1.2.2 The investment of a bank in the shares of any one co- operative \ninstitution coming under paragraph 1.2.1 above shall not exceed 5 per cent of the subscribed capital of that  institution.  \nNote: When more than one co- operative bank contributes to the shares in a co -\noperative society falling under paragraph 1.2.1, the limit of 5 per cent of the subscribed capital indicated above shall apply not in respect of the investment of each of the \nbanks but in respect of the investment of all the banks taken together. In other words, the total investment of all the co- operative banks should be limited to 5 per cent of the \nsubscribed capital of the enterprise concerned.  4  A co -operative bank should offer to make its contribution to the shares of a co -\noperative society coming under paragraph 1.2.1 above only if the bye- laws of the \nrecipient society provide for the retirement of share capital contributed by it.  \n \n1.2.3 The retirement of the share capital contributed by a bank to the shares \nof any society coming under paragraph 1.2.1 above should be completed in 10 equal annual installments commencing from the co -\noperative year immediately following the year in which the concern \ncommences business or  production.  \n1.2.4 A co -operative bank should not, except with the permission of the \nReserve Bank, contribute to the share capital of a society coming under \ncategory referred to in paragraph 1.2.1 above, if it is situated outside its area of  operation.  \n1.2.5 The above restrictions will not apply to holdings by co- operative banks \nof shares in non- profit making co- operative societies such as those \nformed for the protection of mutual interests, (e.g. , co-operative banks' \nassociation) or for the promotion of co- operative education etc. , (e.g., \nstate co- operative union), or housing co- operatives for the purpose of \nacquiring premises on ownership basis,  etc. \n \n2 STATUTORY (SLR)  INVESTMENTS  \n \n2.1 Maintenance of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) for  UCBs  \nBanks shall refer to the Master Direction -Reserve Bank of India [Cash Reserve Ratio  \n(CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)] Directions, 2021 on t he maintenance of \nSLR.  \n \n3 INVESTMENT  POLICY \n3.1 Keeping in view the various regulatory/statutory  guidelines  and the bank's own \ninternal requirements, UCBs should lay down, with the approval of their Board of \nDirectors, the broad Investment Policy and objectives to be achieved while undertaking investment transactions. The Investment Policy  should be reviewed each \nyear. The Board/Committee/Top Management should actively oversee investment transactions. Banks should not undertake any transactions on behalf of Portfolio Management Scheme (PMS) clients in their fiduciary capacity, and on behalf of other 5  clients, either as custodians of their investments or purely as their  agents.  \n3.2 The bank\u2019s I nvestment Policy should clearly indicate the authority to put through \ninvestment deals , the procedure to be followed for obtaining sanction of the \nappropriate authority  for putting through deals, fixing various prudential exposure \nlimits, and reporting system.  \n3.3 The Investment Policy of the bank should include guidelines on the quantity \n(ceiling) and quality of each type of security to be held on its own investment account.  \nIt should be prepared strictly observing the instructions issued by the Registrar of Co-\noperative Societies (Central Registrar of Co- operative Societies, where applicable) \nand the Reserve Bank from time to time and clearly spell out the internal control \nmechanism, accounting standards, audit, review and reporting system to be evolved.  \n3.4 All the transactions should be clearly recorded indicating full details. The Top \nManagement should undertake a periodic review of investment transactions in a critical manner and put up details of large transactions to the Board, for  information.  \n3.5 A copy of the internal I nvestment Policy guidelines framed by the bank with the \napproval of its Board should be forwarded to the concerned Regional Office of \nDepartment of Supervision, Reserve Bank, certifying that the policy is in accordance with the prescribed guidelines and the same has been put in place. Subsequent \nchanges, if any, in the Investment Policy should also be advised to the Regional Office \nof the Reserve Bank.  \n3.6 For investment in non- SLR instruments , banks should review their Investment \nPolicy  and ensure that it provides for the nature and extent of investments intended to \nbe made,  the risk parameters,  and cut -loss limits for holding / divesting the \ninvestments. The banks should put in place proper risk management systems for capturing and analyzing the risk in respect of n on-SLR investments and taking \nremedial measures in time.  Banks should also be guided by instructions given in \nparagraph 12 of this Master Circular.  \n4 GENERAL  GUIDELINES  \n4.1 UCBs should not undertake any purchase/sale transactions with broking firms \nor other intermediaries on principal -to-principal  basis.  6  4.2 Banks should not hold an oversold position in any security  except for those \nbanks which are eligible to undertake short sale position in Government securities as \nprescribed in paragraph 10 of this Master Circular.  However, scheduled UCBs may \nsell a Government Security  already contracted for purchase, provided:  \n4.2.1  the purchase contract  is confirmed prior to the sale,  \n4.2.2  the purchase contract is guaranteed by Clearing Corporation of India \nLtd. ( CCIL ) or the security is contracted for purchase from the Reserve \nBank  and, \n4.2.3  the sale transaction will settle either in the same settlement cycle as the \npreceding purchase contract, or in a subsequent settlement cycle so that the delivery obligation under the sale contract is met by the securities acquired under the purchase contract ( e.g. when a security is purchased \non T+0 basis, it can be sold on either T+0 or T+1 basis on the day of the purchase; if however it is purchased on T+1 basis, it can be sold on T+1 basis on the day of purchase or on T+0 or T+1 basis  on the next day).  \nSale of Government  Securities  allotted to successful bidders in primary \nissues on the day of allotment, with and between CSGL constituent account holders is permitted.  \n4.3 For purchase of securities from the Reserve Bank through Open Market \nOperations (OMO), no sal e transactions should be contracted prior to receiving the \nconfirmation of the deal/advice of allotment from the Reserve Bank.  \n4.4 Banks should exercise abundant caution to ensure adherence to these \nguidelines. The concurrent auditors should specifically verif y the compliance with \nthese instructions. The concurrent audit reports should contain specific observations \non the compliance with the above instructions and should be incorporated in the monthly report to the Chairman/ Managing Director/Chief Executive Off icer of the bank \nand the half yearly review to be placed before the Board of Directors. CCIL will make available to all market participants as part of its daily reports, the time stamp of all transactions as received from NDS -OM. The mid office/back office and the auditors \nmay use this information to supplement their checks/scrutiny of transactions for compliance with the instructions. Any violation noticed in this regard should \nimmediately be reported to the concerned Regional Office of Department of \nSuper vision , Reserve Bank of India. Any violation noticed in this regard would attract \npenalties as currently applicable to the bouncing of SGL even if the deal has been 7  settled because of the netting benefit under DVP III, besides attracting further \nregulatory  action as deemed necessary.  \n4.5  Banks successful in the auction of primary issue of Government Securities, \nmay enter into contracts for sale of the allotted securities in accordance with the terms and conditions as indicated below:  \n4.5.1  The contract for sale can be entered into only once by the allottee bank, on the basis of an authenticated allotment advice issued by Reserve Bank. The selling bank should make suitable noting/stamping on the allotment advice indicating the sale contract number etc., the details of  \nwhich should be intimated to the buying entity. Any sale of securities \nshould be only on a T+0 or T+1 settlement  basis.  \n4.5.2  The contract for sale of allotted securities can be entered into by banks \nonly with entities maintaining SGL Account with Reserve Bank for delivery and settlement on the next working day through the DVP  \nsystem.  \n4.5.3  The face value of securities sold should not exceed the face value of securities indicated in the allotment  advice.  \n4.5.4  The sale deal should be entered into directly without the involv ement of  \nbroker/s.  \n4.5.5  Separate record of such sale deals should be maintained containing details such as number and date of allotment advice, description and the face value of securities allotted, the purchase consideration, the number, date of delivery and f ace value of securities sold, sale consideration, the \ndate and details of actual delivery etc. This record should be made available to Reserve Bank for verification. Banks should immediately report any cases of failure to maintain such records.  \n4.5.6  Such type of sale transactions of Government Securities allotted in the auctions for primary issues on the same day and based on authenticated allotment advice should be subjected to concurrent audit and the relative audit report should be placed before the Board of Directors of the bank once every month. A copy thereof should also be sent to the concerned Regional Office of Department of Supervision, RBI . 8  4.5.7  Banks will be solely responsible for any failure of the contracts due to \nthe securities not being credited to their SGL account on account of non-payment  etc. \n4.6 While undertaking OTC transactions in Government securities, banks should \nseek a scheduled commercial bank, a Primary Dealer ( PD), a financial institution, \nanother UCB, insurance company, mutual fund or provident fund, as a counterparty \nfor their transactions. Preference should be given to  direct deals with such counter \nparties. It will be desirable to check prices from other banks or PDs with whom the UCB may be maintaining Gilt  account.

Under this \nscheme, banks may bid upto \u20b9 2 crore (face value) in any auction of Government of \nIndia dated securities, either directly, through a bank or through a PD. For availing this facility, no bidding skill is required, as allotment upto \u20b9 2 crore (face value) is made \nat the weighted average cut -off rate which emerges in the auction. UCBs may also \nparticipate directly or through a bank or a PD in the competitive and non- competitive \nauctions of S tate Development Loans  (SDLs)  conducted by the  Reserve Bank. 9  Participation in non- competitive auction of S DLs will be as per guidelines prescribed \nin the Scheme of Non- Competitive Bidding in the Auction of S DLs issued vide circular \nIDMD.No.954/08.03.001/2009- 10 dated August 24,  2009, as amended from time to \ntime.

In \nthe next financial year, upon being satisfied that the UCB in question \nhas made improvements in its internal control systems, RBI may grant \nspecific  approval for undertaking short sales by using the SGL A/c \nfacility.  \niii. The monetary penalty may be paid by the UCB concerned by way of a \ncheque or through electronic mode for the amount favouring the \nReserve Bank of India, within five working days of receipt of intimation \nof order imposing penalty from RBI.  \n5.1.5  For the purpose of instructions  given in paragraph 5.1.3, \u2018SGL bouncing\u2019 \nshall mean failure of settlement of a Government securities transaction \non account of insufficiency of funds in the current account of the buyer \nor insufficiency of securities in the SGL / CSGL account of the seller, \nmaintained with the Reserve Bank of India.  \n5.1.6 The defaulting UCB shall make appropriate disclosure, on the number of \ninstances of default as well as the quantum of penalty paid to the \nReserve Bank during the financial year, under the \u201cNotes to Account\u201d in \nits balance sheet.  \n5.1.7 Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraphs  5.1.3 to 5.1.5, the \nReserve Bank reserves the right to take any action including temporary \nor permanent debarment of the SGL account holder, in accordance with \nthe powers conferred under the G overnment Securities  Act, 2006 as it \nmay deem fit, for violation of the terms and conditions of the opening and \nmaintenance of SGL/ CSGL accounts or breach of the operational \nguidelines issued from time to time.  13  5.1.8 In addition to the above, as NDS Members, UCBs should strictly abide  \nby all other provisions of the NDS (Membership) Regulations, 2002 as \namended from time to time.  \n5.1.9   Value  Free Transfer (VFT) of the government securities, i.e. transfer of \nsecurities from one SGL / CSGL to another SGL / CSGL account, without \ncorresponding payment leg in the books of RBI, shall be in terms of \ninstructions issued by Internal Debt Management Department  vide \ncircular IDMD.CDD.No.S930/11.22.003/202 1-22 dated October 5, 2021 .  \n5.2 SGL Forms \n5.2.1  The SGL transfer forms should be in the standard format prescribed by \nthe Reserve Bank and printed on semi -security paper of uniform size. \nThese should be serially numbered and there should be a control system in place to account for each SGL form.  \n5.2.2  SGL transfer forms should be signed by two authorised officials of the bank whose signatures should be recorded with the respective PDO of Reserve Bank and other  banks.  \n5.2.3  The SGL transfer form received by the purchasing bank should be deposited in its SGL account immediately. No sale should be affected  \nby way of return of SGL transfer form held by the bank.  \n5.2.4  Any bouncing of SGL transfer forms issued by selling bank in favour of the buying bank should immediately be brought to the notice of the Reserve Bank by the buying bank.  \n5.3 Control, Violation and Penalty  Provisions  \n5.3.1  Record of SGL transfer forms issued/received should be maintained. Balances as per the bank\u2019s books in respect of SGL accounts should be reconciled with the balances in the books of PDOs. The PDO concerned will forward a monthly statement of balances of SGL/CSGL account to all account holders. UCBs having SGL/CSGL accounts with PDOs may use these statements for the purpose of monthly reconciliation of their SGL/CSGL balances as per their books and the position in this regard should be placed before the Audit Committee of the Board. This reconciliation should also be periodically checked by the internal audit department. A system for verification of the authenticity of the SGL transfer forms received from other banks and confirmation of authorised 14  signatories  should be put in place.  \n5.3.2  Banks should also forward a quarterly certificate to the PDO concerned, \nindicating that the balances held in the SGL accounts with the PDO have been reconciled and that it has been placed before the Audit Committee of the Board. A copy thereof should be sent to the concerned Regional \nOffice concerned of the Department of Supervision, RBI . \n5.3.3  Banks should put in place a system to report to the Top Management on a monthly basis the details of transactions in securities, details of SGL bouncing and review of investment transactions undertaken during the  \nperiod.  \n5.3.4  All promissory notes, debentures, shares, bonds, etc. , held in physical \nform,  should be properly recorded and held under joint custody. A \nseparate register may  be maintained to record the particulars of \nsecurities taken out/re -lodged. These should be subjected to periodical \nverification, say once in a quarter or half -year, by persons unconnected \nwith their  custody.  \n5.3.5   Certificates should be obtained at quarterly/half -yearly intervals i n \nrespect of securities lodged with other institutions. Similarly, it is necessary to reconcile the SGL Account balance with the PDO at monthly  intervals.  \n5.3.6   The internal inspectors and concurrent auditors should peruse the transactions to ensure that the de als have been undertaken in the best \ninterest of the bank. The Vigilance Cell should also make surprise sample checks of large transactions.  \n5.3.7  The concurrent auditors should certify that investments held by the bank, as on the last reporting Friday of each quarter and as reported to Reserve Bank, are actually owned/held by it. Such a certificate should be submitted to the concerned Regional Office of Department of \nSupervision  RBI, within 30 days from the end of the relative quarter.  \n6 ENGAGEMENT OF  BROKERS  \n6.1 Dealing through Brokers  \n6.1.1   The inter -bank securities transactions should be undertaken directly \nbetween banks and no bank should engage the services of any broker in such transactions. Banks may, however, undertake securities transactions among themselves or  with non- bank clients through \nmembers of  National Stock Exchange (NSE)  / BSE wherein the 15  transactions are transparent. In case any transactions in securities are \nnot undertaken on NSE /BSE, the same should be undertaken by the \nbanks directly without the us e of brokers.  \n6.1.2  Purchase of permissible shares and PSU bonds in the secondary market (other than inter -bank transactions) should be only through recognised \nstock exchanges and registered stock - brokers.  \n6.1.3  The SBI DFHI has been permitted to operate as a broker in the inter - \nbank participation market. This would enable the banks to seek intermediation of SBI DFHI for borrowing/lending, if required. However, the banks shall be free to settle transaction in the inter -bank \nparticipations market directly, if so  desir ed. \n6.1.4  If a deal is put through with the help of a broker, the role of the broker should be restricted to that of bringing the two parties to the deal together. Under no circumstances banks should give power of attorney or any other authorisation to the brokers/ intermediaries to deal on their behalf in the money and securities  markets.  \n6.1.5  Disclosure of counter party should be insisted upon on conclusion of the deal put through brokers.  \n6.1.6  Contract confirmation from the counter party should be insisted upon.  \n6.1.7  The brokers should not be involved in the settlement process at all i.e. , \nboth the fund settlement and delivery of security should be done with the counterparty  directly.  \n6.2 Empanelment of  Brokers  \n6.2.1  The bank should prepare a panel of brokers with the approval of their Board of  Directors.  \n6.2.2  Brokers should be empaneled after verifying their credentials e.g.:  \n(a) SEBI  registration \n(b) Membership of BSE/NSE for debt  market.  \n(c) Market turnover in the preceding year as certified by the \nExchange/s.  \n(d) Market reputation etc. \n6.2.3  The bank should check websites of SEBI/respective exchanges, to ensure that the broker has not been put in the banned list. 16  6.3 Broker  Limits  \n6.3.1  A disproportionate part of the business should not be transacted through \nonly one or a few brokers. Banks should fix aggregate contract limits for each of the approved brokers and ensure that these limits are not exceeded. A record of broker -wise details of deals put through and \nbrokerage paid should be maintained.  \n6.3.2  A limit of 5  per cent  of total transactions (both purchases and sales) \nentered into by the banks during a year should be treated as the aggregate upper contract limit for each of the approved brokers.  \n6.3.3  This limit should cover both the business initiated by the bank and the business offered/brought to the bank by a broker.  \n6.3.4  It should be ensured that the transactions entered through individual brokers during a year normally do not exceed the prescribed limit. However, if it becomes necessary to exceed the aggregate limit for any broker, the specific reasons, therefore, should be recorded in writing by \nthe authority empowered to put through the deals. In such cases, post - \nfacto approval of the Board may be obtained after explaining the circumstances under which the limit was  exceeded.  \nNote: Clarifications on certain issues  raised by the banks in this regard are furnished \nin Annex I\n. \n7 SETTLEMENT OF GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS \u2013 \nTHROUGH CLEARING CORPORATION OF INDIA LTD. (CCIL)  \n7.1 All Government Securities transactions (both Outright and Repo) are being \nsettled through CCIL only.  \n7.2 UCBs, which are not a member of NDS -CCIL system, should undertake their \ntransactions in Government Securities through gilt account/demat account maintained with a NDS  member.  \n7.3 All outright secondary market transactions in Government Securities will be \nsettled on T+1 basis. However, in case of repo transactions in Government Securities, the market participants will have the choice of settling the first leg on either T+0 basis or T+1 basis as per their  requirement.  \n8 TRADING OF GOVERNMENT SECURITIES ON STOCK EXCHANGES  \n8.1 The facility of trading of Government Securities on the stock exchanges, in the 17  dematerialized mode only, is  available to banks in addition to the present NDS -OM of \nthe Reserve Bank, w hich will continue to remain in place.  \n8.2 The UCBs have the option to undertake transactions in dated Government of \nIndia securities in dematerialised form on automated order driven system of NSE  and \nBSE in addition to the existing mode of dealing through SGL/CSGL  accounts with \nReserve Bank or  gilt accounts with the designated entities such as Scheduled \nCommercial Bank/PD/State Co -operative Bank  etc. \n8.3 As the trading facility on the above stock exchanges will operate parallel to the \npresent system of trading in Gover nment Securities, the trades concluded on the \nexchanges will be cleared by their respective clearing corporations/Clearing Houses. \nHowever, trading members of the stock exchanges shall not be involved in the settlement process for any regulated entity of R eserve Bank. All stock exchange \ntrades of banks have to be settled either directly with CCIL/Clearing House (in case they are clearing members) or else through a clearing member  custodian.\n \n8.4 With a view to facilitating participation on the stock exchanges wi thin the \nregulations prescribed by Reserve Bank, SEBI and the exchanges, banks are being extended the following facilities:  \n8.4.1  Opening demat accounts with a bank depository participant (DP) of NSDL/CDSL or with SHCIL in addition to their SGL/CSGL accounts wit h \nReserve Bank/authorised entities.  \n8.4.2  Value free transfer of securities between SGL/CSGL and demat accounts is being enabled at PDO, Mumbai, subject to operational guidelines issued separately by Internal Debt Management Department  \nto all SGL  / CSGL  account  holders.  \n8.5 The balances in Government Securities maintained by the banks in the \ndepositories will be included for SLR purpose. Any shortfall in maintenance of CRR/SLR resulting from settlement failure (on either the NDS -CCIL market or the \nstock exchanges) wi ll attract the usual penalties.  \n8.6 The Boards of UCBs may take a conscious decision in regard to using the stock \nexchange platform for making investments in Government Securities in addition to the existing NDS- CCIL market and the direct bidding facility. As regulations of SEBI wil l \nalso apply insofar as trading of Government Securities is concerned, the Board should \nframe and implement a suitable policy to ensure that operations are conducted in accordance with the norms laid down by Reserve Bank/SEBI and the respective stock \nexchange. Prior to commencing operations, the dealing officials should also familiarize themselves with the basic operating procedures of the stock  exchanges.  18  8.7 Operational  Guidelines \n8.7.1  Banks should put in place appropriate internal control s ystems catering \nto stock exchange trading and settlement before commencing \noperations on the exchanges. The back -office arrangement should be \nsuch that trading on the NDS- OM/OTC market and on the stock \nexchanges can be tracked easily for settlement, reconc iliation and \nmanagement reporting. Banks should, therefore, install enabling IT infrastructure and adequate risk management systems.  \n8.7.2   Only SEBI registered brokers who are authorized by the permitted \nexchanges (NSE /BSE) to undertake transactions in Government \nSecurities can be used for placing buy/sell orders. A valid contract note indicating the time of execution must be obtained from the broker at end of day. \n8.7.3  The dealing officials should independently check prices in the market or on the stock exchange scr eens before placing their orders with the \nbrokers. The decision- making processes cannot be delegated to brokers \nby the banks.  \n8.7.4  The transactions done through any broker will be subjected to the current guidelines on transactions done through brokers.  \n8.7.5  Brokers/trading members shall not be involved in the settlement process; \nall trades have to be settled through clearing member custodians. \nHence, it will be necessary for UCBs to enter into a bilateral clearing agreement with such service providers beforehand.  \n8.7.6  All transactions must be monitored with a view to ensuring timely receipt of funds and securities. Any delay or failure should be promptly taken up with the exchange/authorities  concerned.  \n8.7.7  At the time of trade, securities must be available with the banks either in their SGL or in the demat account with depositories.  \n8.7.8  Any settlement failure on account of non- delivery of securities/non-  \navailability of clear funds will be treated as SGL bouncing and the current penalties in respect of SGL bouncing will be applicable. The stock \nexchanges will report such failures to the respective PDOs.  \n8.7.9  For the limited purpose of dealing through the screen- based trading \nsystem of the stock exchanges the condition that a UCB should seek a scheduled commercial bank, a PD, a f inancial institution, another UCB, \ninsurance company, mutual fund or provident fund as a counterparty, 19  while undertaking transactions in Government Securities, will not  apply.  \n8.7.10   Banks should report on weekly basis to their Audit Committee of the \nBoard, giving the details of trades on aggregate basis done on the stock \nexchanges and details of any \u2018closed -out\u2019 transactions on the \nexchanges.  \n8.7.11  The banks should take all necessary precautions and strictly adhere to \nall instructions/guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank relating to transactions in Government Securities as  hitherto.  \n9 REPO/REVERSE REPO TRANSACTIONS \n9.1 UCBs may execute repo transactions subject to adherence to instructions given \nin Repurchase Transactions (Repo) (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2018 issued vide \ncircular FMRD.DIRD.01/14.03.038/2018- 19 dated July 24, 2018 . \n9.2 However, only Scheduled UCBs  with strong financials and sound risk \nmanagement practices are eligible to undertake repo transactions in corporate \ndebt securities. Accordingly, scheduled UCBs , fulfilling the following conditions \nonly would be permitted to undertake such transactions.  \n(a) CRAR of 10  per cent  or more and gross NPA of less than 5 per cent  and \ncontinuous record of profits during the previous three years.  \n(b) Sound risk management practices and mandatory concurrent audit of the \nInvestment  portfolio.  \n9.3 Further, the Repo transactions in corporate bonds shall be undertaken only with \nscheduled commercial banks / PDs and not with other market participants. UCBs which are lenders of funds in a repo transaction may provide for Counter -party \ncredit risk corresp onding to the risk weight for such exposure as applicable to the \nloan / investment exposure. UCBs  may also ensure that securities acquired \nunder repo along with other n on-SLR investment already in the Balance Sheet \nshould be within the stipulated ceiling of non-SLR investment (i.e. , 10 per cent  of \na bank's total deposits as on March 31 of the previous year). The funds borrowed under repo should be within the limit prescribed for call money borrowing (i.e., 2  \nper cent  of the previous year's  deposits).  \n9.4 UCBs can undertake repo transactions  only in Government securities held in \nexcess of the prescribed SLR requirements.  20  9.5 Repos shall be accounted as per guidelines contained in Annex I II of this Master \nCircular.  \n10. SHORT SELLING IN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES  \n10.1 Well managed UCBs , who are members of NDS -OM and have regular \nconcurrent audit of their treasury operations, are permitted to undertake intra- day short \nselling of Government Securities.

In case the price of the \u2018WI\u2019 security is not available, the value of \nthe underlying security be used instead. Depreciation, if any, should be provided for and appreciation, if any, should be ignored.  \n(c) The off -balance sheet (net) position in \u2018WI\u2019 securities, scrip- wise, would \nattract a risk weight of  2.5 per cent . 21  (d) On delivery, the underlying security may be classified in any of the three \ncategories, viz; \u2018Held to Mat urity\u2019, \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 or \u2018Held for Trading\u2019, \ndepending upon the intent of holding, at the contracted price.  \n11.3 It is clarified that the securities bought in the \u2018WI\u2019 market would be eligible for \nSLR purposes, only on delivery.  \n12. NON - SLR INVESTMENTS  \n12.1 In order to contain risks arising out of the non- SLR investment portfolio of banks, \nthe banks should adhere to the following guidelines:  \n12.1.1 Instruments \nUCBs may invest in the following instruments:  \n(a) \"A\" or equivalent and higher rated Commercial Papers (CPs), debentures \nand bonds.  \n(b) Units of Debt Mutual Funds and Money Market Mutual  Funds.  \n(c) Equity Share s of Market Infrastructure Companies  (MICs). \n(d) Equity  Share s of the Umbrella Organization (UO) for the UCB Sector  \n \n12.1.2 Prudential  Limit s \n(a) The Non- SLR investments shall  be limited to 10 per cent  of a bank\u2019s total \ndeposits as on March 31 of the previous year.  \n(b) Investment in unlisted securities shall be subject to a minimum rating \nprescribed at 12 .1.1 (a) above and shall not exceed 10 per  cent of the total \nnon-SLR investments at any time.  \nNote:  \n1.   UCBs investing in equity shares of Market Infrastructure Companies \n(MICs), if it becomes necessary to do so for acquiring membership of \nMICs are allowed to exceed the limit for Investments in Non-  SLR / \nunlisted securities  prescribed in paragraph 12.1. 2 (a)  and 12.1. 2 (b) \nabove.  The MICs eligible for investments by UCBs are Clearing \nCorporation of India Ltd., National Payments Corporation of India,  and \nSociety for World Wide Inter -Bank Financial Tele- Communication \n(SWIFT).

Since there is a time lag between issuance an d listing of \nsecurities, which are proposed to be listed but not listed at the time of \nsubscription, banks may not be able to participate in primary issues of n on-\nSLR securities. In view of this, investments in n on-SLR debt securities \n(both primary and secondary market) by banks where the security is \nproposed to be listed in the Exchange(s) may be considered as investment in listed security at the time of making investment. However, if such security is not listed within the period specified, the same will be reckoned for the \n10 per  cent limit specified for unlisted n on-SLR securities. In case such \ninvestments included under unlisted n on-SLR securities lead to a breach \nof 10 per  cent limit, the bank would not be allowed to make further \ninvestments in n on-SLR securities (both primary and secondary market) till \nsuch time its investment in unlisted securities comes within the limit of 10  \nper cent.  \n(c) Investment in deep discount / zero coupon bonds should be subject to the \nminimum rating as stated above and comparable market yields for the residual duration. However, banks are not permitted to invest in Zero Coupon Bonds from February 18, 2011 as advised vide \ncircular \nNo.UCB(PCB)BPD.Ci r.No.36/16.20.000/2010- 11 dated February 18, 2011  \nunless the issuer builds up a sinking fund for all accrued interest and keeps it invested in liquid investments / securities (Government  bonds).  \n(d) Investment in units of Mutual Funds, other than units of Debt  Mutual Funds 23  and Money Market Mutual Funds, are not permitted. The existing holding \nin units of Mutual Funds other than Debt Mutual Funds and Money Market \nMutual Funds, including those in UTI should be disinvested. Till such time that they are held in the books of the bank, they will be reckoned as Non-\nSLR investments for the purpose of the limit at 13.1.1 above. The banks should, however, review their existing risk management policy  to ensure \nthat they do not have disproportionate exposure in any one scheme of a Mutual Fund.  \n(e) Non-SLR investment, other than in units of Debt Mutual Funds and Money \nMarket Mutual Funds , and CPs, shall be in instruments with an original \nmaturity of over one year.  \n(f) Investments in shares of All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) are not \npermitted. In terms of UBD.(PCB).BPD.Cir.No.14/16.20.000/2007- 08 \ndated September 18, 2007 , the existing shareholding in these institutions \nmay be phased out and till such time they are held in the books of the bank, they will be reckoned as n on-SLR investments for the purpose of the limit \nat 12 .1.2 (a) above.  \n(g) All fresh investments under n on-SLR category should be classified under \nHeld for Trading (HFT) / Available for Sale (AFS) categories only and marked to market as applicable to these categories of investments. However, investments in the long- term bonds issued by companies \nengaged in executing infrastructure projects and having a minimum residual maturity of seven years may be classified under Held to Maturity (HTM) category  \n(h) All non-SLR investments will be subject to the prescribed prudential \nsingle/group counter party exposure limits.  \n(i) All transactions for acquisition / sale of n on-SLR investments in secondary \nmarket may be undertaken with mutual funds, pension / provident funds \nand insurance companies, in addition to undertaking transactions with \ncommercial banks and primary dealers, subject to adherence to the \ninstructions contained in Para 7 of RBI  Ma ster Direction \nFMRD.DIRD.2/14.01.002/2017- 18 dated August 10, 2017. 24  Note : For the definitions of certain items such as rated security, investment grade \nrating, etc., please see Annex II . \n12.1.4 Review  of non- SLR investment  \nThe Board should review the following aspects of  non-SLR investment at least \nat half -yearly intervals:  \n(a) Total business  (investment and divestment) during the reporting period.  \n(b) Compliance with prudential limits prescribed for n on-SLR investment.  \n(c) Compliance with the prudential guidelines issued by Reserve Bank on Non-\nSLR securities.  \n(d) Rating migration of the issuers/issues held in the bank's books and consequent diminution in the portfolio quality.  \n(e) Extent of  non-performing investments in  the n on-SLR category and \nsufficient provision thereof.  \n12.1.5 Disclosure  \nThe banks shall disclose the details of the issuer -wise composition of n on-SLR \ninvestments and the non- performing investments, as indicated in Annexure III - \nC.3(d)  of Master Direction on Financial Statements - Presentation and \nDisclosures dated August 30, 2021. \n12.2 Security Receipts (SR) / Pass Through Certificates (PTCs)  / other securities \nreceived through Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARC)  \n(i) Investment by UCBs in SRs / PTCs / other securities issued by ARCs as \nconsideration towards transfer of stressed loans  to the ARC s will be classified \nas non- SLR investment in the books of UCBs. Accordingly, the valuation, \nclassification and other norms applicable to investment in non- SLR instruments \nprescribed by RBI from time to time shall be applicable to UCBs \u2019 investment in \nSRs /  PTCs / other securities issued by ARC s.  \n(ii) UCBs are allowed to hold these investments, over and above the limit of 10 per \ncent of its deposits as on 31 March of the previous year, for n on-SLR securities. \nUCBs are not permitted to make any direct investment in the SRs / PTCs / other \nsecur ities issued by ARCs.  \n \n 25  12.3 Placement of deposits with other banks by  UCBs  \n12.3.1 Prudential inter -bank (gross) exposure limit \nThe total amount of deposits placed by an UCB with other banks (inter -\nbank) for all purposes including call money/ notice money, and deposits, \nif any, placed for availing clearing facility, CSGL facility, currency chest facility, remittance facility and non- fund based facilities like Bank \nGuarantee, Letter of Credit, etc. shall not exceed 20 per cent of its total deposit liabilities as on March 31 of the previous year. The balances held in deposit accounts with commercial banks  (inclu ding scheduled Small \nFinance Banks) , scheduled UCBs , State Cooperative Banks, District \nCentral Cooperative Banks  and investments in Certificate of Deposits \nissued by commercial banks, being interbank  exposures, will be \nincluded in this 20 per cent  limit. \nIn cases where the smaller non- scheduled UCBs are keeping current \naccount/minimum required balance for clearing purpose with relatively larger non- scheduled bank for sub- member clearing arrangements, it is \npossible that the financial position of the non - scheduled UCB with whom \nsuch deposits are kept, could take a hit due to unexpected downturn in \nits business and which could have an effect on the financial position for \nthe depositing bank and its busi ness. Non- scheduled UCBs, which have \nexposures to other non- scheduled UCBs on account of clearing \narrangements may, therefore, review their exposures to such banks periodically based on their published balance sheet and Profit and Loss Account statements.  \n12.3.2 Prudential inter -bank counter party  limit \nWithin the prudential inter -bank (gross) exposure limit, deposits with any \nsingle bank should not exceed 5 per cent of the depositing bank's total deposit liabilities as on March 31 of the previous year.  \n12.3.3 Scheduled UCBs may accept deposits from other scheduled UCBs, if i t \nis part of an arrangement for providing specific services to the latter bank such as acting as the sponsor bank for clearing purposes, DD arrangement, CSGL facility, currency chest facility, foreign exchange 26  transactions, remittance facility and non- fund based facilities like bank \nguarantee (BG), letter of credit (LC), etc. However, the acceptance of \ndeposits by scheduled UCBs from other scheduled UCBs in the nature \nof placement of deposits for investment purposes is not permitted.   \n12.3.4 Only Scheduled UCBs fu lfilling the criteria provided in circular \nDCBR.BPD.(PCB).Cir.No.8/16.20.000/2015 -16 dated November 19, \n2015 ar e permitted to accept deposits from scheduled/ non- scheduled \nUCBs. Those scheduled UCBs which fail to meet the criteria shall phase \nout the deposits as provided in circular  ibid. The total inter -UCB deposits \naccepted by a scheduled UCB satisfying the criteria should not exceed \n10 per cent  of its total deposit liabilities as on 31st March of the previous \nfinancial  year.  \n12.3.5 The interbank exposures arising from deposits placed by UCBs with a UCB under All- inclusive Directions (AID) shall be fully provided within \nfive years at the rate of 20 per cent  annually in terms of \ncircular \nDOR.(PCB).BPD.Cir.No.11/16.20.000/2019 -20 dated April 20, 2020. \nFurther, wherever UCBs are facing difficulty in withdrawal of deposits from a weak State Cooperative Bank /District Central Cooperative Bank , \nthey shall make provision to the extent of 10 per cent  per annum on their \nexposure to such State Cooperative Bank s/District Central Cooperative \nBank s.  The interest receivable on such deposit s shall not be recognised \nas income by the UCBs.  \n12.3.6 Keeping in view the prescribed prudential limits, UCBs may formulate a policy taking into account their funds position, liquidity and other needs for placement of deposits with other banks, the cost of funds, expected rate of return and interest margin on such deposits, the counter party risk, etc ., and place it before their Board of Directors. The Board should \nreview the position at least at half yearly  intervals.  \n13. INTERNAL CONTROL AND INVESTMENT  ACCOUNTING  \n13.1 Internal  Control  \n13.1.1 For every transaction entered into, a deal slip should be prepared which \nshould contain details relating to name of the counterparty , whether it is 27  direct deal or through a broker, and if through a broker, details of security, \namount, price, contract date and time. For each deal, there must be a \nsystem of issue of confirmation to the counterparty.  \n13.1.2 The Deal Slips should be serially numbered and controlled separately to ensure that each deal slip has been properly accounted for. \n13.1.3 On the basis of vouchers passed after verification of actual contract notes received from the broker/ counterparty  and confirmation of the deal \nby the counterparty the Accounts Section should independently write the books of  accounts.  \n13.1.4 A record of broker -wise details  of deals put through and brokerage paid \nshould be maintained.  \n13.1.5 The Internal Audit Department should audit the transactions in securities on an ongoing basis and monitor compliance with the laid down management policies and prescribed procedures and report the deficiencies directly to the management of the bank.  \n13.2 Investment  Accounting \n13.2.1 Accounting Standards \nIn order to bring about uniform accounting practice among banks in \nbooking of income on units of mutual funds (debt mutual funds and money market mutual fund) and equity of AIFIs, as a prudent practice, \nsuch income should be booked on cash basis and not on accrual basis. \nHowever, in respect of income from Government Securities/bonds of public sector undertakings and AIFIs, where interest rates on the instrume nts are predetermined, income may be booked on accrual basis, \nprovided interest is serviced regularly and is not in arrears.  \n13.2.2 Broken Period Interest -  Government and Other Approved \nSecurities \n13.2.2.1 With a view to bringing about uniformity in the accounting treatm ent \nof broken period interest on Government Securities paid at the time of \nacquisition, the banks should not capitalise the broken period interest paid to \nseller as part of cost but treat it as an item of expenditure under Profit & Loss Account.  \n13.2.2.2 It is to b e noted that the above accounting treatment does not take 28  into account taxation implications and hence the bank should comply with the \nrequirements of income tax authorities in the manner prescribed by  them.  \n13.2.2.3 Accounting Procedure for investments in Government \nSecurities \u2013 Settlement Date  Accounting \nWith a view to bringing in uniformity in the practice adopted by banks while accounting for investments in Government Securities, it has been decided that banks should follow \"Settlement Date\" accounting f or recording both outright \nand repos/reverse repo transactions in Government Securities.  \n14. RECOMMENDATIONS OF GHOSH COMMITTEE  \nThe following recommendations made by the Ghosh Committee should be implemented by the banks to prevent frauds and malpractices:  \n14.1 Concurrent Audit  \n14.1.1 \n In view of the possibility of abuse, treasury functions viz. investments, \nfunds management including inter -bank borrowings, bills rediscounting, \netc. should be subjected to concurrent audit and the results of audit should be placed before the Chairman and Managing Director of the bank at prescribed intervals.  \n14.1.2 It is the primary responsibility of the banks to ensure that there are \nadequate audit procedures for ensuring proper compliance of the \ninstructions in regard to the conduct of investment  portfolio.  \n14.1.3 The concurrent audit should cover the following aspects:  \n(i) Ensure that in respect of purchase and sale of securities the \nconcerned department has acted within its delegated powers.  \n(ii) Ensure that the securities other than those in SGL and in demat form, as shown in the books, are physically  held.  \n(iii) Ensure that the Accounting Unit is complying with the guidelines regarding SGL forms, delivery of scrips, documentation and  \naccounting.  \n(iv) Ensure that the sale or purchase transactions are done at rates beneficial to the bank.  \n(v) Scrutinise conformity with broker limits and include excesses 29  observed in their periodical  reports.  \n14.1.4 Banks should formulate internal control guidelines for acquisition of \npermissible shares, debentures and PSU bonds in the secondary market duly approved by their  Boards.  \n14.2 Internal  Audit  \nPurchase and sale of Government Securities etc. should be separately subjected to \naudit by internal auditors . In the absence of internal auditors , audit may be conducted \nby Chartered Accountants . The results of their audit should be placed before the Board \nof Directors once in every quarter.  \n14.3 Review  \nBanks should undertake a half -yearly review (as of March 31 and September 30) of \ntheir investment portfolio, which should, apart from other operational aspects of \ninvestment portfolio, clearly indicate and certify adherence to the laid down internal Investment Policy  and procedures and Reserve Bank\u2019s guidelines and put up the \nsame before the Board within a month. Such review reports should be forwarded to Regional Office of Department of Supervision (erstwhile Urban Banks Department ) by \nMay 15/November 15 respectively.  \n14.4 Penalties for  Violation  \nBanks should scrupulously follow the above instructions. Any violation of these instructions will invite penal action against defaulting banks which could include raising of reserve requirements, withdrawal of refinance from the Reserve Bank, denial of \naccess to money markets, denial of new branches/extension counters and advising \nthe President of Clearing House to take ap propriate action including suspension of \nmembership of the Clearing House.  \n15. CATEGORISATION OF  INVESTMENTS  \n15.1 UCBs are required to classify their entire investment portfolio (including SLR and \nNon-SLR securities) under three categories , viz.: \n(i) Held to Maturity  (HTM)  \n(ii) Available for Sale (AFS)  \n(iii) Held for Trading (HFT)  \nBanks should decide the category of the investment at the time of acquisition and the 30  decision should be recorded on the investment proposals. I nvestments in non-SLR \nsecurities , since September 18, 2007,  should be classified under HFT / AFS \ncategories only and marked to market as applicable to these categories of \ninvestments. However, investments in the long- term bonds  issued by companies \nengaged in executing infrastructure projects and having a minimum residual maturity \nof seven years may be classified under HTM category.  \n15.2 Held to Maturity  \n15.2.1 Securities acquired by the banks with the intention to hold them up to maturity will be classified under HTM  category.  \n15.2.2 The investments included under HTM category should not exceed 25 per cent of the bank's total investments. However, banks are permitted to exceed the limit of 25 per cent of their total investments under HTM category  provided,  \n(a) the excess comprises only of SLR securities  \n(b) the total SLR securit ies held in the HTM category is not more than \n25 per cent of their NDTL as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight.  \n15.2.3 UCBs are not expected to resort to sale of securities held in HTM \ncategory. However, if due to liquidity stress, UCBs are requi red to sell \nsecurities from HTM portfolio, they may do so with the permission of their \nBoard of Directors and rationale for such sale may be clearly recorded. Profit on sale of investments from HTM category shall first be taken to the Profit and Loss account and, thereafter, the amount of such profit shall be appropriated to \u2018Capital Reserve\u2019 from the net profit for the year after statutory appropriations. Loss on sale shall be recognized in the Profit and Loss account in the year of sale.  \n15.3 Held for Trading \n15.3.1 Securities acquired by the banks with the intention to trade by taking advantage of the short -term price/interest rate movements will be \nclassified under HFT category.  \n15.3.2 If banks are not able to sell the security within 90 days due to exceptional 31  circumstanc es such as tight liquidity conditions, or extreme volatility, or \nmarket becoming unidirectional, the security should be shifted to the AFS \ncategory, subject to conditions stipulated in paragraphs 15 .5.3 and \n15.5.4 below.  \n15.4 Available for Sale \n15.4.1 Securities which  do not fall within the above two categories will be \nclassified under AFS  category.  \n15.4.2 Banks have the freedom to decide on the extent of holdings under AFS category. This may be decided by them considering various aspects such as basis of intent, trading strategies, risk management capabilities, tax planning, manpower skills, capital position,  etc. \n(Profit or loss on sale of investments in HFT and AFS categories should be taken to \nthe Profit and Loss  Account).  \n15.5 Shifting of  investments \n15.5.1 Banks may shift investment s to/from HTM category with the approval of \nthe Board of Directors once in a year.  Such shifting  will normally be \nallowed at the beginning of the accounting year. No further shifting to/from this category will be allowed during the remaining part of that \naccounting year.  \n15.5.2 Banks may shift investments from AFS category to HFT category with \nthe approval of their Board of Directors. In case of exigencies, such shifting may be done with the approval of the Chief Executive of the Bank, but should be ratified by t he Board of  Directors.  \n15.5.3 Shifting of investments from HFT category to AFS category is generally \nnot allowed. However, it will be permitted only under exceptional circumstances such as mentioned in paragraph 15 .3.2 above, subject to \ndepreciation, if any, appl icable on the date of transfer, with the approval \nof the Board of Directors/Investment Committee.  \n15.5.4 Transfer of scrips from one category to another, under all circumstances, should be done at the acquisition cost/book value/market value on the date of transfer, whichever is the least, and the depreciation, if any, on 32  such transfer should be fully provided  for. \n15.6 Classification of Investments in the Balance Sheet  \nFor the purpose of Balance Sheet, the investments should continue to be classif ied in \nthe following categories : \n(i) Government  securities  \n(ii) Other approved securities  \n(iii) Shares  \n(iv) Bonds of  PSU \n(v) Others  \n16. VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS  \n16.1 Valuation Standards  \n16.1.1 Investments classified under HTM category need not be marked to \nmarket and will be carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the face value, in which case the premium should be amortised over the period remaining to maturity.  \n16.1.2 The individual scrip in the AFS category will be marked to market at the year-end or at more frequent intervals. The book value of the individual \nsecurities would not undergo any change after the revaluation.  \n16.1.3 The individual scrip in the HFT c ategory will be marked to market at \nmonthly or at more frequent intervals. The book value of  individual  \nsecurities in this category would not undergo any change after marking to market.  \nNote : Securities under AFS and HFT categories shall be valued scrip -wise and \ndepreciation/appreciation shall be aggregated for each classification as indicated at paragraph 15 .6 above separately for AFS and HFT. Net depreciation, if any, shall be \nprovided for. Net appreciation, if any, should be ignored. Net depreciation required to be provided for in any one classification should not be reduced on account of net appreciation in any other classification. Similarly , net depreciation for any \nclassification in one category should not be reduced from appreciation in simil ar \nclassification in another  category.  33  16.1.4 (i) Investment Depreciation Reserve (IDR) required to be created on \naccount of depreciation in the value of investments held under 'AFS' or \n'HFT' categories in any year should be debited to the Profit & Loss Account and an equivalent amount (net of tax benefit, if any, and net of consequent reduc tion in the transfer to Statutory Reserve) or the \nbalance available in the Investment Fluctuation Reserve ( IFR) \nAccount, whichever is less, shall be transferred from the IFR Account to Profit & Loss Account.  \n(ii) In the event that IDR created on account of  depreciation in \ninvestments is found to be in excess of the required amount in any \nyear, the excess should be credited to the Profit & Loss Account and an equivalent amount (net of taxes, if any, and net of transfer to Statutory Reserves as applicable to such excess provision) should be appropriated to the IFR Account to be utilised to meet future depreciation requirement for  investments.  \n(iii) The amounts debited to the Profit & Loss Account for depreciation \nprovision and the amount credited to the Profit  & Loss Account for \nreversal of excess provision should be debited and credited \nrespectively under the head \"Expenditure -  Provisions & \nContingencies\".  \n(iv) The amounts appropriated from the Profit & Loss Account/ to IFR \nand the amount transferred from the IFR to the Profit & Loss Account \nshould be shown as 'below the line' items after determining the profit \nfor the  year.  \n16.1.5 In respect of securities included in any of the three categories where interest/principal is in arrears, the banks should not reckon income on the securities and should also make appropriate provisions for the depreciation in the value of the investment. The banks should not set -\noff the depreciation requirement in respect of these non- performing \nsecurities against the appreciation in respec t of other performing \nsecurities.  \n 34  16.2 Market  Value \n16.2.1 Quoted Securities  \nThe 'market value' for the purpose of periodical valuation of investments \nincluded in the AFS and the HFT categories would be the market price of the scrip as available from the trades/quotes on the stock exchanges, SGL account transactions, and prices dec lared by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Limited \n(FBIL)/FIMMDA . \n16.2.2 Unquoted SLR  Securities  \nIn respect of unquoted securities, the procedure as detailed below should be adopted.  \n(i) Central Government  Securities  \n(a) The Reserve Bank will not announce the YTM rates for  unquoted \nGovernment securities, for the purpose of valuation of investments by banks. The banks shall value the unquoted Central Government \nsecurities on the basis of the prices/YTM rates put out by the Financial Benchmark India Pvt. Ltd. (FBIL)  at periodical intervals.  \n(b) It is clarified that the reckoning of number of years for the purpose of deciding upon appropriate \u2018Yield To Maturity\u2019 (YTM) Rate be done \nby rounding off the fractional period of a year to the nearest \ncompleted year.  \n(c) As regards valuation of  other unquoted securities including PSU \nbonds, banks should uniformly follow YTM method for arriving at valuation of unquoted securities.  \n(ii) Treasury Bills should be valued at carrying cost.  \n(iii) State Government  Securities  \nState Government securities shall  be valued on the basis of the prices / \nYTM rates put out by FBIL periodically.  \n(iv) Other Approved Securities  \nOther approved securities will be valued applying the YTM method by marking it up by 25 basis points above the yields of the Central 35  Government Securities of equivalent maturity put out by FBIL  periodically.  \n16.2.3 Unquoted Non- SLR securities \n(i) Debentures/Bonds  \nAll debentures/bonds other than debentures/ bonds which are in the \nnature of advance should be valued on the YTM basis. Such debentures/bonds may be of different ratings. These will be valued with appropriate mark -up over the YTM rates for Central Government \nsecurities as put out by FBIL /FIMMDA  periodically. The mark -up will be \ngraded according to the ratings assigned to the debentures/bonds by the rating agencies subject to the following:  \n(a) The rate used for the YTM for rated debentures/bonds should be at least 50 basis points above the rate applicable to a Government of \nIndia security  of equivalent maturity,  \n(b) The rate used for the YTM for un- rated debentures/ bonds should \nnot be less than the rate applicable to rated debentures/bonds of equivalent maturity. The mark -up for the un- rated debentures/bonds \nshould appropriately reflect the credit risk borne by the bank.  \n(c) Where interest/principal on the debenture/bonds is in arrears, the \nprovision should be made for the debentures as in the case of \ndebentures/bonds treated as advances. The depreciation/provision requirement towards debentures where the interest is in arrears or principal is not paid as per due date, shall not be allowed to be set -\noff against appreciation against other debentures/bonds.  \n(ii) Where the debentures/bond is quoted and there have been transactions within 15 days prior to the valuation date, the value adopted should not be higher than the rate at which the transaction is recorded on the stock  \nexchange.  \n(iii) Shares of Co- operative Institutions  \nIf UCBs have regularly received dividends from co- operative institutions, \nthen their shares should be valued at face value. In a number of cases, the co- operative institutions in whose shares the UCBs have made 36  investments have either gone into liquidation or have not declared \ndividend at all. In such cases, the banks should make full provision in respect of their investments in shares of such co- operative institutions. In \ncases where the financial position of co- operative institutions in whose \nshares banks have made investments is not available, the shares have to be taken at Re. 1/ - per co- operative institution.  \n(iv) Valuation of Non- SLR securities issued by the Government of India  \n(a) Over the years, the Government of India has, from time to time, issued several special securities which do not qualify for the purpose of complying with the SLR requirements of UCBs. Such Government securities are governed by a separate set of terms and conditions and entail a higher degree of illiquidity spread.  \n(b) For the limited purpose of valuation, a ll special securities issued by \nthe Government of India, directly to the beneficiary entities, which do not carry SLR status, may be valued at a spread of 25 bps above \nthe corresponding yield on Government of India securities.  \n(c) It may be noted, that at present, such special securities comprise: Oil Bonds, Fertiliser Bonds, bonds issued to the State Bank of India \n(during the rights issue), Unit Trust of India, Industrial Finance \nCorporation of India Ltd., Food Corporation of India, the erstwhile Industrial Investment Bank of India Ltd., the erstwhile Industrial Development Bank of India and the erstwhile Shipping Development Finance Corporation.  \n(v) Investment in securities issued by Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC)  \nUCBs are advise d to refer to Paragraph 76 -79 of the Reserve Bank of India \n(Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021 dated September 24, 2021, in  \nthis regard. \n16.2.4 Units of Mutual  funds \nInvestments in quoted debt/money market Mutual Fund Units should be valued as per stock exchange quotations. Investments in un- quoted Mutual Funds \nUnits are to be valued on the basis of the latest re- purchase price declared by 37  the Mutual Funds in respect of each particular Scheme. In case of funds with a \nlock-in period, or where repurchase price/market quote is not available, uni ts \ncould be valued at Net Asset Value (NAV). If NAV is not available, then these could be valued at cost, till the end of the lock -in period.  \n16.2.5 Commercial Paper  \nCommercial paper shall be valued at the carrying cost  \n17. INVESTMENT FLUCTUATION RESERVE (IFR)  \nWith a  view to build up adequate reserves to guard against market risks:  \n17.1 All UCBs sh all build IFR out of realised gains on sale of investments, and \nsubject to available net profit, of a minimum of 5 per cent of the investment portfolio. This minimum  requirement  should be computed with reference to investments in two \ncategories, viz. HFT and AFS. However, banks are free to build up a higher percentage of IFR up to 10 per cent of the portfolio depending on the size and composition of their portfolio, with the approval of their Board of Directors.  \n17.2 Banks should transfer maximum amount of the gains realised on sale of \ninvestment in securities to the IFR. Transfer to IFR shall be as an appropriation of net profit after appropriation to Statutory Reserve.  \n17.3 The IFR consist ing of realised gains from the sale of investments held in AFS \n& HFT  would be eligible for inclusion in Tier II  capital.  \n17.4 Transfer from IFR to the Profit and Loss Account to meet depreciation \nrequirement on investments would be a \u2018below the line\u2019 extraordinary  item.  \n17.5 Banks should ensure that the unrealised gains on valuation of the investment \nportfolio are not taken to the Income Account or to the IFR.  \n17.6 Banks may utilise the amount held in IFR to meet, in future, the depreciation \nrequirement on inves tment in  securities.  \n17.7 A bank may, at its discretion, draw down the balance available in IFR in excess \nof 5 per  cent of its investment in AFS & HFT  for credit to the balance of profit / loss \nas disclosed in the profit and loss account at the end of any accounting year. In the event the balance in the IFR is less than 5 per  cent of its investment in AFS & HFT, \na draw down will be permitted subject to the following conditions : 38  (a) The drawn down amount is used only for meeting the minimum Tier I \ncapital requirements by way of appropriation to free reserves or reducing the balance of loss, and \nb) The amount drawn down is not more than the extent to which the MTM provisions made during the aforesaid year exceed the net profit on sale of investments during that year.  \n17.8 Distinction between IFR and Investment Depreciation Reserve (IDR)  \nIt may be noted that IFR is created out of appropriation of net profit from the realised \ngains from the sale of investments held in AFS & HFT,  and forms part of the reserves \nof the bank qualifying under Tier II capital.  \nIDR is a provision created by charging diminution in investment value to Profit and \nLoss Account. While the amount held in IFR should be shown in the balance sheet \nas such, the amount held in IDR should be reported as Contingent provisions against depreciation in investment . 39  Annex I  \n \nCertain clarifications on brokers\u2019 limits \n[Paragraph 6.3] \n \nSr. \nNo. Issue raised  Response  \n1. The year should be calendar \nyear or financial year?  Since banks close their accounts at \nthe end of March, it may be more \nconvenient to follow t he financial year. \nHowever, the banks may follow \ncalendar year or any other period of 12 months provided, if it is  consist ently  \nfollowed in future.  \n2. Whether to arrive at the total \ntransactions of the year, \ntransactions entered into directly with counterparties , i.e. where \nno brokers are involved would also be taken into account? Not necessary. However, if there are \nany direct deals with the brokers as \npurchasers or sellers the same would have to be included in the total transactions to arrive at the limit of transactions to be done through an individual broker.  \n3. Whether in case of ready \nforward deals both the legs of the deals i.e. , purchase as well \nas sale will be included to arrive \nat the volume of total \ntransactions?  Yes \n4. Whether central loan/state \nloan/treasury bills etc. \npurchased though direct \nsubscriptions/auctions will be included in the volume of total \ntransactions?  No, as brokers are not involved as \nintermediaries.  \n5. It is possible that even though \nbank considers that a particular \nbroker has touched the \nprescribed limit of 5 per cent , he \nmay come with an offer during the remaining period of the year which the bank may find to its advantage as compared to offers received from the other brokers who have not yet done  \nbusiness   upto   the prescribed  \nlimit. If the offer received is more \nadvantageous the limit for the broker may be exceeded and the reasons  \ntherefore recorded,  and approval of \nthe competent authority/Board \nobtained post facto.  40  Sr. \nNo. Issue raised  Response  \n 6. For a bank which rarely deals \nthrough brokers  and \nconsequently the volume of \nbusiness is small maintaining the broker -wise limit of 5 per \ncent may mean splitting the orders in small values amongst different brokers and there may also arise price differential.  There may be no need to split an \norder. If any deal causes, the particular broker's share to exceed 5 \nper cent limit, our circular provides the necessary flex ibility inasmuch as \nBoard's post facto approval can be  \nobtained.  \n7. During the course of the year, it \nmay not be possible to \nreasonably predict what will be \nthe total quantum of transactions \nthrough brokers as a result of \nwhich there could be deviation in  \ncomplying with  the norm of 5 per \ncent.  The bank may get post facto approval \nfrom the Board after explaining to it, the circumstances in which the limit was exceeded.  \n8. Some of the small private sector \nbanks have mentioned that where the volume of business particularly, the transactions done through brokers is small the observance of 5 per cent \nlimit may be difficult. A \nsuggestion has, therefore, been made that the limit may be required to be observed if the business  done  \nthrough a broker, exceeds a cut-\noff point of say \u20b910 crore.  As already observed the limit of 5 per \ncent can be exceeded subject to reporting the transactions to the \ncompetent authority post facto. \nHence, no change in instructions is considered necessary.  \n9. Whether the limit is to be \nobserved with reference to total transactions of the previous year as the total transactions of the \ncurrent year would be known \nonly at the end of the year? The limit has to be observed with \nreference to the year under review. While operating the limit,  the bank \nshould consider the expected turnover \nof the current year which may be \nbased on turnover of the previous year and anticipated rise or fall in the volume of business in the current  \nyear.  \n   \n \n  41  Annex II  \n \nDefinitions of certain terms  \n[Paragraph 12 .1.3] \n \n1. With a view to imparting clarity and to ensure that there is no divergence in the \nimplementation of the guidelines, some of the terms used in the guidelines are defined \nbelow.  \n2. A security will be treated as rated if it is subjected to a detailed rating exercise by an \nexternal rating agency in India which is registered with SEBI and is carrying a current or \nvalid rating. The rating relied upon will be deemed to be current or valid if: \n \n(i) the credit rating letter relied upon is not more than one month  old on the date \nof opening of the issue,  and \n(ii) the rating rationale from the rating agency is not more than one year old on the \ndate of opening of the issue,  and \n(iii) the rating letter and the rating rationale is a part of the offer document.  \n(iv) In the case of secondary market acquisition, the credit rating of the issue should be in force and confirmed from the monthly bulletin published by the respective rating agency.  \n(v) Securities which do not have a current or valid rating by an external rating agency would be deem ed as unrated securities.  \n \n3. A \u2018listed\u2019 debt security is a security which is listed in a stock exchange. If not so, it is \nan \u2018unlisted\u2019 debt  security.  \n4. A Non Performing Investment (NPI), similar to a Non Performing Advance (NPA), is \none where:  \n \n(a) Interest/ instalment (including maturity proceeds) is due and remains unpaid for \nmore than 90 days.   \n(b) if any credit facility availed by the issuer is NPA in the books of the bank, investment in any of the securities issued by the same issuer would also be \ntreated as  NPI. \n \n \n      \n  42  Annex I II \n \nGuidelines for accounting of Repo/Reverse Repo transactions \n[Paragraph 9. 5] \n \n1. The Reserve Bank of India (Amendment) Act, 2006 (Act No. 26 of 2006) provides a \nlegal definition of 'repo' and 'reverse repo' (vide sub- sections (c) and (d) of section 45 U of \nChapter III D of the Act) as an instrument for borrowing (lending) funds by selling \n(purchasing) securities with an agreement to repurchase (resell) the securities on a mutually \nagreed future date at an agreed price which includes interest for the funds borrowed (lent).  \nAccordingly, to bring such transactions onto the balance sheet in their true economic  \nsense and enhance transparency, the accounting guidelines have been reviewed and the revised guidelines are given b elow:  \n2. Applicability of the accounting guidelines: The revised accounting guidelines will \napply to market repo transactions in Government Securities and corporate debt securities  \nincluding the tri -party repo in such securities . These accounting norms will, however, not apply \nto repo / reverse repo transactions conducted under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) \nwith Reserve  Bank.  \n3. Market participants may undertake repos from any of the three categories of \ninvestments, viz., Held for Trading , Available for  Sale and Held to  Maturity . \n4. The economic essence of a repo transaction, viz., borrowing (lending)  of funds by \nselling (purchasing) securities shall be reflected in the books of the repo participants, by accounting the same as collateralised lending and borrowing transaction, with an agreement to repurchase, on the agreed terms. Accordingly, the repo seller, i.e., borrower of funds in the first leg, shall not exclude the securities sold under repo but continue to carry the same in his investment account (illustration given in the Annex I II (a) & III (b)\n) \nreflecting his continued economic interest in the securities during the repo period. On the other hand, the repo buyer, i.e., lender of funds in the first leg, shall not include the securities purchased under repo in his investment account but show it in a separate sub -\nhead (\nAnnex (I II) (a) & (III) (b) ). The securities would, however, be transferred from th e \nrepo seller to repo buyer as in the case of normal outright sale/purchase transactions and such movement of securities shall be reflected using the Repo/Reverse Repo Accounts and contra entries. In the case of repo seller, the Repo Account is credited in the first leg \nfor the securities sold (funds received), while the same is reversed when the securities are repurchased in the second leg.  Similarly, in the case of repo buyer, the Reverse Repo Account is debited for the amount of securities purchased (funds lent) and the same is reversed in the second leg when the securities are sold back.  \n5. The first leg of the repo transaction should be contracted at the prevailing market 43  rates. The reversal (second leg) of the transaction shall be such that the differenc e \nbetween the consideration amounts of first and second legs should reflect the repo \ninterest.  \n6. The accounting principles to be followed while accounting for repo / reverse repo \ntransactions are as  under:  \n(i) Coupon /Discount  \n(a) The repo seller shall continue to accrue the coupon/discount on the securities sold under repo even during the repo period while the repo buyer shall not accrue the same.  \n(b) In case the interest payment date of the security offered under repo fal ls \nwithin the repo period, the coupons received by the buyer of the security \nshould be passed on to the seller of the security on the date of receipt as the cash consideration payable by the seller in the second leg does not \ninclude any intervening cash flows.  \n(ii) Repo Interest Income /  Expenditure  \nAfter the second leg of the repo / reverse repo transaction is over,  \n(a) the difference between consideration amounts of the first leg and second leg of the repo shall be reckoned as Repo Interest Income / Expenditure in the books of the repo buyer / seller respecti vely; and \n(b) the balance outstanding in the Repo Interest Income / Expenditure \naccount should be transferred to the Profit and Loss account as an income \nor an expenditure. As regards repo / reverse repo transactions outstanding on the balance sheet date, only  the accrued income / \nexpenditure till the balance sheet date should be taken to the Profit and \nLoss account. Any repo income / expenditure for the remaining period should be reckoned for the next  accounting period.  \n(iii) Marking to Market  \nThe repo seller shall continue to mark to market the securities sold under repo transactions as per the investment classification of the security. To illustrate, in case \nthe securities sold by banks under repo transactions are out of the Available for \nSale category, then the mark to market valuation for such securities should be done \nat least once a quarter. For entities which do not follow any investment classification norms, the valuation for securities sold under repo transactions may be in \naccordance wit h the valuation norms followed by them in respect of securities of \nsimilar  nature.  44  7. Accounting Methodology \nThe accounting methodology to be followed along with the illustrations is given in Annexes \nIII (a) and III (b). Participants using more stringent accounting principles may continue using \nthe same principles.  \n8. Classification of Accounts \nBanks shall classify the balances in Repo Account under Schedule 4 under item I (ii) or I \n(iii) as appropriate. Simila rly, the balances in Reverse Repo Account shall be classified \nunder Schedule 7 under item I (ii) a or I (ii) b as appropriate. The balances in Repo interest expenditure Account and Reverse Repo interest income Account shall be classified under Schedule 15 (under item II or III as appropriate) and under Schedule 13 (under item III or IV as appropriate) respectively. The balance sheet classification for other participants shall be governed by the guidelines issued by the respective regulators.  \n9. Disclosure  \nThe disclosures should be made by banks in the \u201cNotes on Accounts\u2019 to the Balance \nSheet , as provided in Annexure III - C.3(e) of Master Direction on Financial Statements - \nPresentati on and Disclosures dated August 30, 2021. \n  \n  45  Annex I II (a) \nRecommended Accounting Methodology for accounting of  \nRepo / Reverse Repo transactions  \n[Paragraph 7 of Annex I II] \n(i) The following accounts may be maintained, viz. i) Repo Account, ii) Reverse Repo \nAccount, iii) Reverse Repo Interest Income Account, iv) Repo Interest Expenditure \nAccount v) Reverse Repo Interest Receivable Account and vi) Repo Interest Payable Account.  \n(ii) In additi on to the above, the following 'contra' accounts may also be maintained, \nviz. i) Securities  Sold under Repo Account, (ii) Securities Purchased under Reverse Repo \nAccount, (iii) Securities Receivable under Repo Account and (iv) Securities Deliverable under Reverse Repo Account.  \nRepo  \n(iii) In a repo transaction, the securities should be sold in the first leg at market \nrelated prices and re -purchased in the second leg at the same prices. The \nconsideration amount in the second leg would, however, include the repo interest. The sale and repurchase should be reflected in the Repo  Account.\n \n(iv) Though the securities are not excluded from the repo seller's  investment account \nand not included in the repo buyer's investment account, the transfer of securities shall \nbe reflected by using the necessary contra  entries.  \nReverse Repo  \n(v) In a reverse repo tran saction, the securities should be purchased in the first leg at \nprevailing market prices and sold in the second leg at the same prices. The consideration \namount in the second leg would, however, include the repo interest. The purchase and sale should be reflected in the Reverse Repo  Account.  \n(vi) The balances in the Reverse Repo Account shall not be a part  of the Investment  \nAccount  for balance sheet  purposes  but can be reckoned for SLR purposes if the \nsecurities acquired under reverse repo transactions are approved securities.  \nOther aspects relating to Repo/Reverse Repo  \n(vii) In case the interest payment date of the securities sold under repo falls within the \nrepo period, the coupons received by the buyer of the security should be passed on to the seller on the date of receipt as the cash consideration payable  by the seller  in the 46  second leg does  not include any intervening cash flows.  \n(viii) To reflect the accrual of  interest in respect  of the  outstanding repo transactions at \nthe end of the accounting period, appropriate entries should be passed in the Profit and \nLoss account to reflect Repo Interest Income / Expenditure in the books of the buyer / \nseller respectively and the same should be debited / credited as an expenditure \npayable/inc ome receivable. Such entries passed should be reversed on the first working \nday of the next accounting period.  \n(ix) Repo seller continues to accrue coupon/discount as the case may be, even during \nthe repo period while the repo buyer shall not accrue the same.  \n(x) Illustrative examples are given in Annex I II (b) \n \n \n  47  Annex I II (b) \n \nIllustrative examples for accounting of Repo / Reverse repo transactions  \n[Paragraph 7 of Annex I II] \nWhile in the body of the circular, the term \"repo\" is used generically to include both repo \nand reverse repo (which is simply a mirror image of a repo transaction), in this Annex the \naccounting guidelines have been set out separately for repo and reverse repo for clarity.  \nA.

With a view to sustain these efforts \nand to ensure discipline among the banks for timely and accurate reporting of currency chest transactions, instructions on the subject have been issued from time to time.  \n2. The Master Direction  enclosed incorporates updated guidelines / circulars on the \nsubject. The Direction will be updated as and when fresh instructions are issued.  \nYours faithfully,  \n \n(Sanjeev Prakash)  \nChief General Manager  \nEncl : As above  \n \n  \n Annex \nMaster Direction on Penal Provisions in reporting of transactions/ balances at \nCurrency Chests  \n1. Reporting Procedure \n1.1 Reporting of Currency Chest Transactions \nThe minimum amount of deposit into / withdrawal from currency chest will be \u20b91,00,000 \nand thereafter, in multiples of \u20b950,000.  \n1.2 Time limit for Reporting 1.2.1 The currency chests should invariably report all transactions through CyM \u2013  CC \nportal on the same day by  7 pm . \n1.2.2 Relaxation on account of strike in banks  \nRelaxation in the reporting period on account of strike situation will be considered on \ncase -to-case basis.  \n2. Delayed Reporting / Wrong Reporting / Non -Reporting of Currency Chest \nTransactions \n2.1 Levy of penal interest  \n2.1.1 Delay in Reporting  \nIn the event of delay in reporting currency chest transactions, penal interest at t he rate \nindicated in paragraph 4 of this circular shall be levied on the amount due from the chest \nholding bank for the period of delay. Penal interest shall be calculated on T+0 basis i.e. \npenal interest shall be levied in respect of transactions not reported by currency chests \nto the Issue Office on the same business day within the time limit prescribed above.  \n2.1.2 Wrong reporting \nPenal interest shall be levied in respect of cases of wrong reporting in the same manner \ntill the date of receipt of corrected advice by Reserve Bank. As debits/credits to banks' current accounts are raised on the basis of the transactions report ed by the currency \nchests, penal interest shall invariably be levied in all cases of wrong reporting by the currency chests. It is expected that currency chests would ensure the correctness of figures reported on the CyM -  CC portal. Particular care shall be taken to ensure that \nremittances of fresh notes/re- issuable notes sent to the currency chests from RBI/press \nare not reported as 'deposit' transactions . 2.1.3 Inclusion of ineligible amounts in the currency chest balances  \n(i) Penal interest shall be lev ied in all cases where the bank has enjoyed 'ineligible' credit \nin its current account with Reserve Bank on account of wrong reporting / delayed reporting \n/ non- reporting of transactions.  \n(ii) Only cash held in the custody of joint custodians and 'freely available' to them is eligible \nfor inclusion in the chest balances. Thus, cash kept for safe custody in sealed covers for whatever reasons/cash in trunks/bins under the lock and key of any official/s other than the Joint Custodians or bearing a third lock put by any official in addition to the two locks of the Joint Custodians is not eligible for being included in the chest balances. If such \namounts are included in the chest balances, these shall be treated as instances of wrong \nreporting and shall attract penal interest at the rate specified in paragraph 4.  \n(iii) In all the above cases (excepting shortages in chest balances / remittances, shortages \ndue to pilferage / frauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest balances / remittances), penal interest shall be levied from the date of inclusion of 'ineligible' amounts in chest \nbalances till the exclusion of such amounts from chest balances.  \n2.1.4 Penal measures for other deficiencies \nPenal measures for shortages in chest balances / remittances, shortages due to pilferage \n/ frauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest balances / remittances shall be taken on \nthe basis of prevailing \u201cScheme of Penalties\u201d.  \n3. Levy of penalty  \n3.1 Reporting of soiled note remittances to RBI  \nSoiled note remittances to RBI shall not be shown as withdrawal by chest(s). In case such \nremittances to RBI are wrongly reported as 'withdrawal ', a penalty of \u20b950,000 shall be \nlevied irrespective of the value of remittance and period of such wrong reporting.  \n3.2 Reporting of diversions in CyM \u2013 CC portal  \nAll currency chest diversions (both between chests of the same bank and between chests of different banks) have to be reported through \u2018Diversion Module\u2019 of CyM -CC Portal. The \nCC sending the diversion should initiate the diversion entry. The receiving CC should acknowledge the same. Diversions should not be reported as deposit/withdrawal. A \npenalty of \u20b950,000 shall be levied for any such wrong reporting.  \n3.3 Delayed reporting where currency chests had \u201cNet Deposit\u201d  \nPenal interest at the prevailing rate for delayed reporting of the instances where the \ncurrency chest had reported \u201cnet deposit\u201d shall not be charged. However, in order to ensure proper discipline in reporting currency chest transactions, a flat penalty of \u20b950,000 shall be levied on the currency chests for delayed reporting, irrespective of the value of \nnet deposit.  \n4. Rate of penal interest  \nPenal interest shall be levied at the rate of 2% over the prevailing Bank Rate for the period \nof delayed reporting/wrong reporting/non- reporti ng /inclusion of ineligible amounts in \nchest balances.  \n5. Operational Guidelines on levy of penalties/penal interest  \n5.1 Competent Authority  \nThe Competent Authority to  decide the nature of irregularity  shall be the Officer -in-\nCharge of the Issue Department of the Regional Office under whose jurisdiction the \ndefaulting currency chest  is located.  \n5.2 Appellate Authority  \n5.2.1 As the sole criterion for levy of penal interest / penalty  for delayed reporting is the \nnumber of days of delay, there should ordinarily be no occasion for banks to request for reconsideration of the Reserve Bank's decision . However, representations, if any, on \naccount of genuine difficulties faced by currency chests especially in hilly/remote areas and those affected by natural calamities, etc., may be made to the Regional Director/Chief \nGeneral Manager/Officer -in-Charge of the Regional Office concerned through the Head / \nControlling office of the bank within a month from the date of debit.  \n5.2.2 In the case of  wrong reporting representations for waiver shall not be considered. \n{cf. para 2.1.2 above}.  \n5.2.3 As the intention behind the levy of penal interest / penalty  is to inculcate discipline \namong banks so as to ensure prompt/correct reporting, requests  by banks for waiver of \npenal interest on grounds that delayed/wrong/non- reporting did not result in utilization of \nthe Reserve Bank's funds or shortfall in the maintenance of CRR/SLR or that they were the result of clerical mistakes, unintentional or arithmetical errors, first time  error, \ninexperience of staff etc., shall not  be considered as valid grounds for waiver of penal \ninterest.  \n-------------------------  ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/91MDPPDR01042022EADFF060516C47E49C34DB2C9AA96CE1.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 01, 2022", "info": " \n\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092c\u0902\u0927  \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , 4\u0925\u093e \u0924\u0932, \u0905\u092e\u0930  \u092d\u0935\u0928 , \u092a\u0940 .\u092e\u093e\u0917\ufffd \u090f\u092e\u0964 , \u092b\u094b\u091f\ufffd , \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908  400001  \nDepartment of Currency Management, 4th Floor, Amar Building, P.M.

The words and expressions \nused in these notes shall have the same meaning as in the Act. \n(1) Acquisition of Financial Assets \ni) Every A RC is required to evolve Asset Acquisition Policy within 90 days of getting \nthe certificate of registration which shall, inter alia, provide that the transactions will \ntake place in a transparent manner and at a fair price in a well -inform ed market, and \nthe transactions are executed on arm's length basis by exercise of due diligence.  \nii) The share of financial assets to be acquired from the bank / FI should be appropriately and objectively worked out keeping in view the provision in the Act  \nrequiring consent of secured creditors holding not less than 60% of the amount \noutstanding to a borrower for the purpose of enforcement of security interest;  \niii) For easy and faster realisability, all the financial assets due from a single debtor to \nvarious banks/ FIs may be considered for acquisition. Similarly, financial assets \nhaving linkages to the same collateral may be considered for acquisition to ensure relatively faster and easy realisation.  \niv) Both fund and non-fund based financial assets may be included in the list of assets \nfor acquisition. Assets classified as \n56Special Mentioned Account (SMA) in the books \nof the originator may also be acquired. \nv) Acquisition of funded assets should not include takeover of outstanding \ncommitments, if any, of any bank/ FI to lend further. Terms of acquisition of security \ninterest in non-fund transactions, should provide for the relative commitments to continue with bank/ FI, till demand for funding arises.  \nvi) Loans not backed by proper documentation should be avoided.  \nvii) As far as possible, the valuation process should be uniform for assets of same profile and should ensure that the valuation of the financial assets is done in scientific \nand objective manner. Valuation may be done internally or by engaging an  \nindependent agency, depending upon the value of the assets.

However, there is no restriction on acquisition of assets from banks/ FIs directly in the books of \ntrusts set up by ARC.  \n(2) Issuance of SRs  \ni) Every ARC shall issue the SRs  through the trust set up exclusively for the purpose. \nThe trusteeship of such trust shall vest with the ARC.  \nii) The trust shall issue SRs  only to QBs and such SRs shall be transferable/ \nassignable only in favour of other QBs. \niii) Every ARC intending to issue SRs shall make disclosures in the offer document as \nprescribed by the Bank from time to time. \n57[(iv) Commonality and conflict of interest, if any, between the ARC and Rating \nAgency should be disclosed. \n(v) Special features of SRs  \n(a) SRs cannot be strictly characterized as debt instruments since they combine \nthe features of both equity and debt. However, these are recognized as securities \nunder Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. \n(b) The cash flows from the underlying assets cannot be predicted in terms of \nvalue and intervals. \n(c) These instruments when rated would generally be below investment grade. \nThese instruments are privately placed.  \n \n \n \n                                            \n57 Inserted vide Guidelines DNBS (PD) CC.No.6/SCRC/10.30.049/2006-2007 dated May 28, 2007  40 \n (vi) Rating/ Grading of SRs  \n58(a) Every ARC shall mandatorily obtain initial rating/ grading of SRs from a \n59[SEBI registered] CRA within a period of six months from the date of acquisition \nof assets and declare forthwith, the NAV of the SRs issued by it. Thereafter, \nARCs will get the rating/ grading of SRs reviewed from a registered CRA as on June 30, and December 31 every year and declare the NAV of SRs forthwith, to enable the QBs to value their investment in SRs. \n60ARCs shall retain a CRA for \nat least 6 rating cycles (of half year each). If a CRA is changed mid-way through these 6 rating cycles, the ARC shall disclose the reason for such change. For arriving at NAV, ARC shall get the SRs rated on \u2018recovery rating scale\u2019 and require the rating agencies to disclose the assumptions and rationale for rating.  \n61ARCs shall mandatorily obtain the recovery rating from the CRAs and disclose \nthe assumptions and rationale behind the rating to SR holders. \n(b) The rating/ grading should be based on \u2018recovery risk\u2019 as against \u2018 default\u2019 \nwhich is the basis for rating assignments in normal assets, i.e. how much more \ncan be recovered instead of timely payment.  Rating should reflect present value \nof the anticipated recoverability of future cash flows. \n(c) The ratings will be assigned on a specifically developed rating scale called \n\u201cRecovery Rating (RR) scale\u201d. Each rating category in the recovery scale will \nhave an associate range of recovery, expressed in percentage terms, which can \nbe used for arriving at NAV of SRs. Symbols should be assigned by rating \nagencies to the associated range of recovery, which would inter -se not deviate \nby a specified percentage points, say (+/ -) 10%. The rating would be indicative. \n(d) The Recovery Rating should be assessed after factoring in any other relevant \nobligation and not on the original debt obligation. \n(e) The other key factors that should be factored in while assigning Recovery \nRating are extent of debt acquired, composition of lenders, collaterals available, \nsecurity and seniority of debt, individual lender vis -\u00e0-vis institutional lender, \n                                            \n58 Inserted vide Notification No. DNBS(PD -SC/RC) No.11 / PCGM (KKV)/-2014 dated August 05, 2014  \n59 Inserted vide Guidelines DNBS (PD) CC.

The \nNAV should be restricted within the recovery range associated with the rating assigned \nto the SRs. The ARC based on its recovery experience should choose a particular \npercentage within the recovery range indicated by the Rating Agency. The Recovery \nRating percentage so picked by the ARC multiplied by the face value of the SR will \ngive the NAV. The ARC should provide the rationale for selection of the particular \npercentage of Recovery Rating. For example, if range is between 81% - 90%, ARC \nmay pick up 87% based on its judgement. The face value of say Rs 10 multiplied by \nthe recovery percentage i.e. 87% would give the NAV as Rs 8.70]. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  42 \n Appendix I \nDeclaration and Undertaking by Director/ MD/ CEO as on --------------------- \nName :  \n1.

Studies conducted by NABARD in a few states to assess the \nimpact of the linkage project have brought out encouraging and positive features like increase \nin loan volume of the SHGs, definite shift in the loaning pattern of the members from non-\nincome generating activities to production activities, nearly 100 per cent recovery \nperformance, significant reduction in the transaction costs for both the banks and t he \nborrowers etc., besides leading to a gradual increase in the income level of the SHG \nmembers. Another significant feature observed in the linkage project is that about 85 per cent \nof the groups linked with banks were formed exclusively by women.  \n2. Reco gnizing the importance of SHG Bank linkage, banks have been advised to meet the \nentire credit requirements of SHG members, as envisaged in Paragraph 93 of the Union \nBudget announcement for the year 2008-09, made by the Honorable Finance Minister, wherein i t was stated as under: \"Banks will be encouraged to embrace the concept of Total \nFinancial Inclusion. Government will request all scheduled commercial banks to follow the example set by some public sector banks and meet the entire credit requirements of SH G \nmembers, namely, (a) income generation activities, (b) social needs like housing, education, \nmarriage, etc. and (c) debt swapping\".  Linking of SHGs with banks has  thus been emphasized \nin the Monetary Policy Statements of Reserve Bank of India and Union B udget \nannouncements from time to time and various guidelines have been issued to banks in this \nregard.  \n3. Banks should provide adequate incentives to their branches in financing the Self Help \nGroups (SHGs) and establish linkages with them, making the procedures simple and easy. \nThe group dynamics of working of the SHGs need neither be regulated nor formal structures \nimposed or insisted upon. The approach to financing of SHGs should be totally hassle-free \nand may also include consumption expenditures.  Accord ingly, the following guidelines  should \nbe adhered to enable effective linkage of SHGs with the banking sector.  \n4. Opening of Savings Bank A/C  \nThe SHGs, registered or unregistered, which are engaged in promoting savings habit among \ntheir members are eligible to open savings bank accounts with banks. These SHGs need not \nnecessarily have already availed of credit facilities from banks before openin g savings bank 3 \n accounts. The instructions on simplified Customer Due Diligence (CDD) applicable to SHGs \nas prescribed in Part VI of the  Master Direction - Know Your Customer (KY C) Direction, 2016  \n(as updated from time to time) shall be adhered to.   \n5. Lending to SHGs  \na) Bank lending to SHGs should be included in branch credit plan, block credit plan, district \ncredit plan and state credit plan of each bank. Utmost priority should be accorded to the \nsector in preparation of these plans. It should also form an integral part of the bank\u2019s \ncorporate credit plan.  \nb) As per operational guidelines issued by NABARD, SHGs may be sanctioned savings linked loans by banks (varying from a saving to loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4). However, in case \nof matured SHGs, loans may be given beyond the limit of four times the savings as per the discretion of the bank.  \nc) A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation is a precondition for \naugmenting f low of credit to SHGs. Banks should strive to remove all operational irritants \nand make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and disburse credit by delegating \nadequate sanctioning powers to branch managers. The loan application forms, \nprocedures and documents should be made simple. It would help in providing prompt and \nhassle-free credit.  \n6. Interest rates  \nThe banks would have the discretion to decide on the interest rates applicable to loans given \nto Self Help Groups/member beneficiaries , subject to regulatory guidelines on interest rate \non advances contained in Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Interest Rate on \nAdvances) Directions, 2016 issued vide DBR.Dir.No.85/13.03.00/2015- 16 dated March 3,  \n2016, as amended from time to time\u201d.   \n7. Service/ Processing charges  \nNo loan related and ad hoc service charges/inspection charges should be levied on priority \nsector loans up to \u20b925,000. In the case of eligible priority sector loans to SHGs/ JLGs, this limit will be applicable per member and not to the group as a whole.   4 \n 8. Separate Segment under priority sector  \nLoans to SHGs are allowed to be classified under Priority Sector Lending (PSL) under  the \nrespective categories viz Agriculture, MSME, Social  Infrastructure and others, subject to \nextant guidelines of Master Directions \u2013 Priority Sector Lending (PSL) \u2013  Targets and \nClassification  issued vide Master Directions  FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.5/04.09.01/2020- 21 dated \nSeptember 4, 2020, as amended from time to time.  \n9. Presence of defaulters in SHGs \nDefaults by a few members of SHGs and/or their family members to the financing bank should \nnot ordinarily come in the way of financing SHGs per se by banks, provided the SHG is not \nin default. However, the bank loan may not be utilized by the SHG for financing a defaulter \nmember to the bank.  \n10. Capacity Building and Training  \na) Banks may initiate suitable steps to internalize the SHGs linkage project and organize \nexclusive short duration programmes for the field level functionaries. In addition, suitable \nawareness/sensitization programmes may be conducted for their middle level controlling \nofficers as well as senior officers.  \nb) Banks shall refer to instructions on Financial Literacy by FLCs and rural branches \u2013 Policy \nreview  vide Circular FIDD.FLC.BC.No.22/12.01.018/2016-17 dated March 02, 2017  \nconducting tailored programs targeting SHGs . \n11. Monitoring and Review of SHG Lending  \nConsidering the potential of SHGs, banks shall closely monitor the progress regularly at various levels. In order to give a boost to the ongoing SHG bank linkage programme for credit flow to the unorganized sector, monitoring of SHG bank linkage programme shall  be a regular \nitem on the agenda for discussion at the SLBC and DCC meetings. It should be reviewed at the highest corporate level on a quarterly basis. Further, progress of the programme ma y be \nreviewed by banks at regular intervals . The progress under SHG -BLP, as prescribed vide RBI \nletter FIDD.CO.FID.No.3387/12.01.033/2017-18 dated April 26, 2018 shall be reported to NABARD (Micro Credit Innovations Department), Mumbai, on a quarterly basi s, and the \nreturns in the \nprescribed format  shall be submitted within 15 days from due date.  5 \n 12. Reporting to CICs  \nRecognizing the importance of credit information reporting in respect of the SHG members \nfor financial inclusion, banks are advised to adhere to the guidelines on Credit information \nreporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) member s dated June 16, 2016 and Credit \ninformation reporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) members  dated January 14, \n2016.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6 \n Appendix  \nList of Circulars consolidated in the Master Circular  \nSr. \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

A revised \nversion of Master Circular on the subject is annexed for your information and necessary \naction.  \nYours faithfully  \n(Sanjeev Prakash)  \nChief General Manager  \nEncl: As above \n  \n \n     \nMaster Circular \u2013 Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated April 01, 2022 \n1. Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins at Bank Branches \n(a) All branches of banks in all parts of the country are mandated to provide following \ncustomer services, more actively and vigorously to the members of public so that there is \nno need for them to approach RBI Regional Offices for this purpose:  \n(i) Issuing f resh / good quality notes and coins of all denominations,  \n(ii) Exchanging soiled / mutilated / defective notes,1 \nand \n(iii) Accepting coins and notes either for transactions or exchange.  \nConsidering that accepting coins packed in sachets of 100 pieces each would be more \nconvenient for the cashiers as well as the customers , such sachets shall be kept at the \ncounters and made available to the customers.  Coins, in the denominations of \u20b91 and \u20b92 \nshall be accepted by weighment.  \n(b) All branches shall provide the above facilities to members of public without any \ndiscrimination on all working days. The scheme of providing exchange facility by a few select currency chest branches on one of the Sundays in a month will remain unchanged. \nThe names and addresses of such bank branches shall  be available with the respective \nbanks.  \n(c) The availability of the above-mentioned facilities at the bank branches shall be given \nwide publicity for information of the public at large.  \n(d) None of the bank branches shall refuse to accept small denomination notes and / or \ncoins tendered at their counters. All coins in the denomination of 50 paise, \u20b91, \u20b92, \u20b95, \u20b910 \nand \u20b920 of various sizes, theme and design issued from time to time by the Government \nof India continue to be legal tender.  \n                                                            \n1 Small Finan ce Banks and Payment Banks may exchange mutilated and defective notes at their \noption.  \n 2. Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 [as Amended by Reserve Bank \nof India (Note Refund) Amendment Rules, 2018] - Delegation of Powers  \n(a) In terms of Section 28 read with Section 58 (2) of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, no \nperson is entitle d as a right to recover from the Government of India or RBI the value of \nany lost, stolen, mutilated or imperfect currency note of the GOI or banknote. However, \nwith a view to mitigating hardship to the public in genuine cases, it has been provided that \nthe RBI may , with prior  sanction of the Central Government, prescribe the circumstances \nin, and the conditions and limitations subject to which, the value of such currency notes or \nbanknotes may be refunded as a matter of grace.  \n(b) With a view to extending the facility for the benefit and convenience of public, all \nbranches of banks have been delegated powers under Rule 2(j) of Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 [as a mended by Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) \nAmendment Rules, 2018] (hereinaft er referred to as NRR, 2009) for exchange of mutilated \n/ defective notes free of cost.  \n(c) The NRR, 2009 were amended to enable the public to exchange mutilated notes in \nMahatma Gandhi (New) series, which are smaller in size compared to the earlier series.  \nThe minimum area of the single largest undivided piece of the note required for payment of full value for notes of rupees fifty and above denominations were also revised. The \nReserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Amendment Rules, 2018 were  notified in the G azette \nof India on September 6, 2018.  \n3. Liberalized Definition of a Soiled Note  \nIn order to facilitate quicker exchange facilities, the definition of soiled note has been \nexpanded. A \u2018soiled note\u2019 means a note which has become dirty due to normal wear and  \ntear and also includes a two piece note pasted together wherein both the pieces presented \nbelong to the same note and form the entire note with no essential feature missing. These \nnotes shall be accepted over bank counters in payment of Government dues and for credit \nto accounts of the public maintained with banks. However, in no case, these notes shall  \nbe issued to the public as re-issuable notes , and such  notes shall  be deposited in currency \nchests for onward transmission to RBI offices as soiled note re mittances for further \nprocessing.  \n 4. Mutilated Notes \u2013 Presentation and Passing \nA mutilated note is a note of which a portion is missing or which is composed of more than \ntwo pieces. Mutilated notes shall be presented at any of the bank branches. The notes so \npresented shall be accepted, exchanged and adjudicated in accordance with NRR, 2009 . \nThe branches shall take steps to see that the exchange facilities are not cornered by \nprivate money changers or professional dealers of defective notes.  \n5. Extremely Brittle, Burnt, Charred, Stuck -Up Notes  \nNotes which have turned extremely brittle or are badly burnt, charred or inseparably stuck up together and, therefore, cannot withstand normal handling, shall not be accepted by \nthe bank branches for exchange. Instead, the holders shall  be advised to tender these \nnotes to the Issue Office of Reserve Bank of India concerned where they will be \nadjudicated under a Special Procedure.  \n6. Procedure for Exchange of Soiled/ Mutilated/ Imperfect Notes  \n6.1 Exchange of Soiled Notes  \n6.1.1  Notes presented in small numbe r: Where the number of notes presented by a \nperson is up to 20 pieces with a maximum value of \u20b95,000 per day, banks shall exchange \nthem over the counter, free of charge.  \n6.1.2  Notes presented in bulk: Where the number of notes presented by a person \nexceeds 20 pieces or \u20b95,000 in value per day, banks shall accept them against receipt, \nfor value to be credited later. Banks shall  levy service charges as permitted in Master \nCircular on Customer Service in Banks (\nDBR.No.Leg.BC.21/09.07.006/2015-16 dated \nJuly 1, 2015 ). In case tendered value is above \u20b950,000, banks are expected to take the \nusual precautions.  \n6.2 Exchange of Mutilated and Imperfect Notes  \n6.2.1  While designated branches shall  continue to follow the procedure as laid down in \nPart III of NRR, 2009 ( www.rbi.org.in \u2192Publications\u2192Occassional) for exchanging \nmutilated and imperfect notes and issue receipt for the notes presented for adjudication, \nnon-chest branches are required to follow the procedure mentioned in the following paragraphs 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 of this circular  for notes presented in small numbers and in \nbulk respectively.  \n6.2.2 Notes presented in small number:  Where the number of notes presented by a \nperson is up to 5 pieces, non-chest branches shall normally adjudicate the notes as per \nthe procedure laid down in Part III of NRR, 2009 and pay the exchange value over the \ncounter. If the non- chest branches are not able to adjudicate the mutilated notes, the notes \nshall be received against a receipt and sent to the linked currency chest branch for \nadjudication. The probable date of payment shall be informed to the tenderers on the \nreceipt itself and the same shall  not exceed 30 days. Bank account details shall be \nobtained from the tenderers for crediting the exchange value by electronic means.  \n6.2.3 Notes presented in bulk:  Where the number of notes presented by a person is \nmore  than 5 pieces but not exceeding \u20b95,000 in value, the tenderer shall be advised to \nsend such notes to nearby currency chest branch by insured post giving his / her bank \naccount details (a/c no, branch name, IFSC, etc.) or get them exchanged thereat in \nperson. All other persons tendering mutilated notes whose value exceeds \u20b95,000 shall be \nadvised to approach nearby currency chest branch. Currency chest branches receiving \nmutilated notes through insured post shall  credit the exchange value to the account of \nsender by electronic means within 30 days of receipt of notes.  \n6.3 Grievance Redressal: Tenderers aggrieved with the service provided by the banks \nand a related grievance not resolved to the satisfaction of the customers , or not replied to \nwithin a period of 30 days by the bank may approach the RBI Ombudsman under \u2018The \nReserve Bank - Integrated Ombudsman Scheme, 2021\u2019. Complaints can be filed online \non https://cms.rbi.org.in  and also throu gh the dedicated e-mail  or sent in physical mode to \nthe \u2018Centralised Receipt and Processing Centre\u2019 set up at Reserve Bank of India, 4th \nFloor, Sector 17, Chandigarh - 160017 with the bank/ postal receipts as proof for \nnecessary action.  \n7. Notes Bearing \"PAY\" / \"PAID\" / \"REJECT\" Stamps  \n(a) Every Officer-in -charge of the branch i.e. the Branch Manager and every Officer -in-\ncharge of the Accounts or Cash Wing of the Branch shall act as 'Prescribed Officer' in \neach branch to adjudicate the notes received at the branch for exchange in accordance  \nwith NRR, 2009. After adjudicating mutilated notes, the Prescribed Officer is required to record his order by subscribing his initials to the dated 'PAY'/ 'PAID'/ 'REJECT' stamp. The \n'PAY' /'PAID' & 'REJECT' stamps shall  also carry the name of the bank and branch \nconcerned and such stamps held under the custody of the 'Prescribed Officer' to avoid \nmisuse. \n(b) Mutilated / defective notes bearing 'PAY'/'PAID' (or 'REJECT') stamp of any RBI Issue \nOffice or any bank branch, if presented for payment again at any of the bank branches \nshall be rejected under Rule 6(2) of NRR, 2009 and the tenderer shall be advised that the \nvalue of such note/s cannot be paid since the same has already been paid as is evident \nfrom the PAY/ PAID stamps affixed on it/ them. All bank branches have instructions not to \nissue notes bearing PAY/ PAID stamps to the public even through oversight. The branches shall caution their customers not to accept such notes from any bank or anybody else. \n8. Notes with Slogans/ Scribbling/ Stain etc. \n(a) Notes with slogans, political or religious messages, scribbling, stain (including colour \nstain) etc. are unfit for usage and circulation and go against Clean Note Policy of RBI.  \n(b) Such notes received from members of public shall  not be reissued for circulation and \nbe remitted to currency chest for onward remittance to RBI offices.  \n(c) Any note with slogans and message of a political or religious nature written across it \nceases to be a legal tender and the claim on such a note will be rejected under Rule 6(3) \n(iii) of NRR, 2009. Similarly, notes which are disfigured may also be rejected under Rule \n6(3) (ii) of NRR, 2009\n. \n(d) All Bank notes with scribbling / stain (including colour stain) on them continue to be \nlegal tender. Such notes can be deposited or exchanged in any bank branch.  \n9. Deliberately Cut Notes  \nThe notes which are found to be deliberately cut, torn, altered or tampered with, if \npresented for payment of exchange value shall  be rejected under Rule 6(3) (ii) of the NRR, \n2009. Although it is not possible to precisely define deliberately cut notes, a close look at \nsuch notes will clearly reveal any deliberate fraudulent intention, as the manner in which \nsuch notes are mutilated will follow a broad uniformity in the shape/ location of missing \nportions of the notes, especially when the notes are tendered in large numbers. The details of such instances together with the name of the tenderer, the number of notes tendered \nand their denominations , shall be reported to the DGM/ GM, Issue Department, Reserve \nBank of India under whose jurisdiction the branch falls. The matter shall also be reported \nto local police in case a lar ge number of such notes are tendered.  \n10. Training \nRBI Issue Offices conduct training programmes for 'Prescribed Officers' of bank branches \non a periodic  basis. As the training programmes are intended to provide knowledge and \ninstil confidence in the Presc ribed Officers in the process of adjudication of defective \nnotes, it is imperative that the Prescribed Officers of the branches are deputed for such \nprogrammes.  \n11. Display of Notice Board  \nAll bank branches are required to display at their branch premises,  at a prominent place, \na board indicating the availability of note and coin exchange facility with the legend, \n\"SOILED/ MUTILATED NOTES AND COINS ARE ACCEPTED AND EXCHANGED \nHERE\" for information of general public. Banks shall  ensure that all their branches  provide \nfacility for exchange of notes and coins not only to their customers but also others.  \n12. Disposal of Notes Adjudicated at Bank Branches  \nThe reports of  notes adjudicated by bank branches  and the full value paid notes have to \nbe remitted by all branches to the chest branches with which they have been linked and \ntherefrom to the RBI Issue Offices concerned together with the next soiled note remittance \nin the manner already laid down. The half v alue paid notes and rejected notes, which are \nheld by the chest branches in their cash balance, shall  be packed separately with separate \ninvoice and sent along with the full value paid notes  as part of soiled remittance  or sent \nby registered and insured post as and when required. The full value paid notes will be \ntreated as chest remittance by the RBI Issue Office while the half value paid notes and \nrejected notes will be treated as notes tendered for adjudication and processed accordingly. All chest branch es are required to submit to our RBI Issue Offices a monthly \nstatement showing the number of notes adjudicated during the month.  \n 13. Uncurrent Coins  \nThe coins of 25 paise and below, issued from time to time have ceased to be legal tender  \nwith effect from June 30, 2011 in terms of Gazette Notification No. 2529 dated December \n20, 2010 issued by the Government of India.  \n14. Monitoring and Control  \n(a) The Regional Managers / Zonal Managers of the banks shall  pay surprise visits to the \nbranches and report the position of compliance in this regard to the Head Office which will review such reports and take prompt remedial action, wherever necessary.  \n(b) Any non -compliance in this regard shall be viewed as violation of instructions issued \nby the Reserve Bank of India.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n Master Circular \u2013 Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated April 01, 2022 \nList of circulars / notifications consolidated by the Master Circular  \nSr.No  Circular / Notification No.    Date  Subject  \n1.

Accordingly, a framework for capturing geo-tagging information of payment \nsystem touch points  deployed by bank s / non-bank PSOs  is laid out in the Annex . The date from \nwhich the information shall be reported to Reserve Bank shall, however, be advised in due course.  \n \n2. This framework is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and \nSettlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).  \n Yours faithfully, \n \n(P Vasudevan)  \nChief General Manager  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Annex  to RBI circular CO.DPSS.OVRST.No.S1738/ 06-08-018/ 2021-2022  \ndated March 25, 2022)  \nFramework for Geo-tagging of Payment System Touch Points \n \nA. Background \nIn recent years, the payments ecosystem in India has witnessed rapid developments  with a \nbouquet of payment systems, platforms, products and services available for consumers. Reserve \nBank of India (Reserve Bank, Bank) is focused on deepening of digital payments and providing \ninclusive access to all citizens of the country, irrespective of their location or digital literacy . To \nensure this, it is imperative that a robust payment acceptance infrastructure with multiple types of \ntouch points exists across the length and breadth of the country  and is available and accessible \nat all times. C aptur ing the accurate location of existing payment system touch points  / acceptance \ninfrastructure ( hereinafter referred to as payment touch points) , is essential to upscaling and \nchalking out intervention strategies. This requirement can be effectively facilitated by geo-tagging \nof payment touch points . \n \nB. Geo-tagging \nGeo-tagging refers to capturing the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of payment \ntouch points deployed by merchants to receive payments from their customers. G eo-tagging has \nvarious benefits, such as,  provide insights on regional  penetration of digital payments ; monitor \ninfrastructure density across different locations ; identify scope for deploying additional payment \ntouch points; facilitate focused digital literacy programmes. Policy interventions  for realising the \nabove benefits will be facilitated by the information thus collected.  \n \nC. Infrastructure \nDigital payment transactions carried out by customers using payment touch points  use two broad \ncategories  of physical infrastructure:  \n\u2022 Banking infrastructure comprising bank branches , offices, extension counters, \nAutomated Teller Machines (A TMs) / Cash Deposit Machines (CDMs), Cash Recycler \nMachines (CRMs), micro -ATMs  used by Business Correspondents (BCs), etc .   \n\u2022 Payment acceptance infrastructure comprising Points  of Sale (PoS) t erminals , Quick \nResponse (QR) c odes deployed by banks / non-bank  Payment System Operators (P SOs), \netc. \n  \nD. Capturing payment touch point details \nUse of geo-tagging to c apture the locational data of acceptance infrastructure would be subject \nto the following guidelines :   \na. Banks / Non-bank  PSOs shall capture and maintain geographical coordinates for all \npayment touch points.  \nb. Geo-tagging information in respect of the following shall be submitted to the Reserve \nBank : \n\u2022 PoS terminals (Mobile PoS, Soft PoS, Tablet PoS, Desktop PoS, Self-service Kiosk \nPoS, Android-based PoS t erminals, Non-Android-based PoS terminals with GPRS \nSIM Card -embedded, Non-Android-based PoS t erminals with PSTN Line \nConnectivity , etc.); and  \n\u2022 Paper -based / Soft QR Codes (Bharat QR , UPI QR , etc.).  \n \nE. Reporting guidelines \nInformation that shall be reported by banks / non-bank  PSOs and procedure therefor is detailed \nbelow : \n1. Information to be submitted to Reserve Bank \ni. All banks / Non-bank PSOs shall  maintain a registry with accurate location of all \npayment touch points across the country, including the following information:  \n \na. Merchant -related information \u2013 General merchant details (name, merchant ID, \nmerchant type, merchant c ategory, merchant c ontact details , merchant / payment \naggregator information, if any , etc.);  Merchant location details (m erchant address, \nstate, district, revenue centre, population of revenue centre , post office, pin code, \npopulation group, tier, etc. ); and \nb. Payment  acceptance infrastructure details \u2013 General payment touch point \ndetails (terminal  type, sub-type, terminal  ID, date of commencing operations, \noperating status, etc.) and Payment touch point  location details (t erminal  \naddress, state, district, revenue centre, population of revenue centre, post office, pin \ncode, geo-co -ordinates ( latitude, longitude),  population group, tier, etc.).  \n \n \n \n 2. Reporting requirements and methodology  \ni. All banks / N on-bank PSOs shall report information on payment touch points to the \nReserve Bank through the Centralised Information Management System  (CIMS) of \nRBI.  \nii. Reporting of information shall be in .txt / CSV  file format. \niii. Banks / N on-bank  PSOs shall report two files:  \na. File 1 containing details on the merchants acquired / on-boarded by the banks / \nnon-bank  PSOs ; and \nb. File 2 containing details on the payment touch points  deployed by the acquired / \non-boarded merchants . \niv. Bank s / Non-bank PSOs deploying payment touch points shall report to RBI:  \na. Details of all existing payment touch points deployed (as per timeline indicated by \nRBI); \nb. Details of additional touch points as and when deployed,  within seven calendar \ndays from operationalisation / activ ation of the terminal ; \nc. Updates  and changes  pertaining to the existing payment touch points  shall be \nreported within seven calendar days  from date of updation / modification.  \n3. Access to information reported  \nBanks / No n-bank PSOs shall be provided with a facility to access / download the data \nrelating to information reported by them . \n4.

The extant instructions for UCBs on issue and regulation of capital funds have been \nreviewed keeping in view , inter alia, the provisions of Section 12 read with Section 56 of the \namended Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act) . \n \nAugmentation of capital funds \n \n3. UCBs are permitted to raise share capital , as hitherto, by way of (i) issue of shares to \npersons within their area of operation, in accordance with the provisions of their bye-laws, and \n(ii) issu e of additional shares to the existing members.  \n \n4. UCBs are also permitted to issue the following instruments to augment their capital : \n \nI. Preference Shares  \n \na. Perpetual Non-Cumulative Prefere nce Shares (PNCPS)  eligible for inclusion in \nTier I capital  \nb. Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares (PCPS) eligible for inclusion in Tier II \ncapital  \nc. Redeemable Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (RNCPS)  eligible for \ninclusion in Tier II capital  \nd. Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (RCPS) eligible for inclusion in \nTier II capital  \n \nII. Debt instruments  \n \na. Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI ) eligible for inclusion in Tier I capital  \nb. Long Term Sub ordinated Bonds  (LTSB ) eligible for inclusion in Tier II capital   \n \n \n2 \n \n \n5. The guidelines  governing the instruments specified in para 4 (I) &(II) above, indicating the \nregulatory requirements , are enclosed in Annex es I & II respectively .  \n \n6. For the purpose of enhancing investor education on the risk characteristics of regulatory \ncapital requirements, UCBs , which issue regulatory capital instruments as specified in para 4 \nabove,  shall adhere to the following conditions:  \na) For floating rate instruments, banks should not use its Fixed Deposit rate as benchmark. \nb) A specific sign-off as quoted below, from the investors , for having understood the features \nand risks of the instruments,  may be incorporated in the common application form of the \nproposed issue:  \n\"By making this application, I / we acknowledge that I / we have understood the terms \nand conditions of the issue of [Name of the share/security] being issued by [Name of \nthe bank] as disclosed in the Prospectus and Offer D ocument\". \nc) UCBs shall ensure that all the publicity material  / offer document, application form and other \ncommunication with the investor should clearly state in bold letters (Arial font, size 14, equivalent size in English / Vernacular version) how a PNCPS / PCPS / RNCPS / RCPS / PDI \n/ LTSB , as the case may be, is different from a fixed deposit,  and that these instruments are \nnot covered by deposit insurance.  \nd) The procedure for transfer to legal heirs in the event of death of the subscriber of the \ninstrument should also be specifi ed. \nRefund of share capital \n7. In terms of Section 12 (2) (ii) read with Section 56 of the BR Act, a co-operative bank shall \nnot withdraw or reduce its share capital, except to the extent and subject to such conditions \nas the Reserve Bank may specify in this behalf. Accordingly, i t has been decided to permit \nUCBs to refund the share capital to their m embers , or nominees / heirs of deceased members , \non demand, subject to the following conditions:  \n \na) The bank\u2019s capital to risk -weighted assets ratio (CRAR) is 9  percent or above, both as per  \nthe latest audited financial  statements and the last CRAR as assessed by RBI during statutory  \ninspection .   \n \n \n3 \n \nb) Such refund does  not result in the CRAR of the bank falling below  regulatory minimum of 9  \nper cent.  \n8. It is clarified that for the purpose of computing CRAR  as above, accretion to capital funds \nafter the balance sheet date1, other than by way of profits, may be taken into account.  Any \nreduction in capital funds , including by way of losses,  during the aforesaid period shall also be \nconsidered.  \nShare linking to borrowing norms \n \n9. Borrowings from UCBs are linked to shareholdings of the borrowing members as below:  \ni. 5 per cent of the borrowings, if the borrowings are on unsecured basis.  \nii. 2.5 per cent of the borrowings, in case of secured borrowings. \niii. In case of secured borrowings by Mic ro and Small Enterprises (MSE) , 2.5 per cent  of \nthe borrowings ; of which 1 per cent is to be collected initially and the balance of 1.5 \nper cent is to be collected in the course of next 2 years. \n10. The above share linking norm may be applicable for member's shareholdings up to the \nlimit of 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of the bank. Where a member is already \nholding 5  per cent of  the total paid up share capital of a UCB, it would not be necessary for \nhim / her to subscribe to any additional share capital on account of the application of extant \nshare linking norms. In other words, a borrowing member may be required to hold shares for \nan amount that may be computed as per the extant share linking norms or for an amount that \nis 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of the bank, whichever is lower.  \n11. In terms of the extant norms2, UCBs which maintain CRAR of 12 per cent on a continuous \nbasis, are exempted from the mandatory share linking norm s outlined in para 9 above.  On a \nreview, i t has been decided that the share-linking to borrowing norms shall be discretionary  \nfor UCBs which meet the minimum regulatory CRAR criteria of 9  per cent and a Tier 1 CRAR \nof 5.5 per cent as per the latest audited financial statements and the la st CRAR as assessed \nby RBI during statutory inspection. Such  UCBs shall have a Board-approved policy on share-\nlinking to borrowing norms , which  shall be implemented in a transparent, consistent and non-\ndiscriminatory manner . The policy may be reviewed by the Board at the beginning of the \naccounting year. UCBs which do not maintain the minimum CRAR of 9 percent and Tier 1 \n                                            \n1 Capital funds shall be as per audited data  \n2 Please refer circular UBD.BPD.(PCB).Cir.No.22/09.18.201/2010- 11 dated November 15, 2010  on Share Linking to Borrowing \nNorm in Urban Co- operative Banks   \n \n \n4 \n \nCRAR of 5.5 per cent, shall continue to be guided by the norms on share-linking to borrowing \nas specified in paragraph 9 above.  \n12. Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) held by members  / subscribers, \nmay be treated as shares for the purpose of compliance with the extant share linking to \nborrowing norms. \nRepeal \n13.

The Government of India has decided that the date of closure of residual transactions for \nthe month of March 2022 be fixed as April 11, 2022. In view of the ensuing closing of government accounts for the financial year 2021- 22, receiving branches including those not \nsituated locally, should adopt special arrangements such as courier service etc., for passing on challans/scrolls etc., to the Nodal/Focal Point branches so that all payments and collections made on behalf of government towards the end of March are accounted for in the same financial year.

As regards reporting of March 2022 transactions by Nodal/Focal Point branches in April 2022, the branches may be advised to follow the procedure as outlined in the Annex\n. To sum \nup, the nodal/Focal Point branches will be required to prepare separate set of scrolls, one pertaining to March 2022 residual transactions and another for April transactions during the first 11 days of April 2022. The Nodal/Focal Point branches should also ensur e that the \naccounts for all transactions (revenues/tax collections/payments) are effected at the receiving branches up to March 31, 2022 in the accounts for the current financial year itself and are not mixed up with the transactions of April 2022.

The main scrolls for March 2022 transactions prepared from April 1 to April 11, 2022 are to be distinctly marked as March Residual \u2013  1, March Residual \u2013  2 and so on upto \nApril 11, 2022. In other words, serial number should be allotted in consecutive order for each main scroll of March 2022 transactions sent from April 1 to April 11, 2022. These scrolls along with the copies of daily summary of Receipts and Payments prepared separately for March 2022 transactions will be forwarded to the Departmental Officials concerned (i.e. Zonal Accounts Offi cers/Pay and Accounts Officers and Designated \nOfficers) in the usual way. The Nodal/Focal Point branches will also be required to report the above transactions to the Link Cell through separate Daily Memos. These advices must be sent to enable the Link Cel l of each bank at Nagpur, to make daily settlement with \nReserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section (CAS) Nagpur. On receipt of advices from the Nodal/Focal Point branches, the Link Cell should segregate the advices for the March Residual transactions and forward them separately to Reserve Bank of India, CAS, Nagpur. This procedure should continue upto and inclusive of April 11, 2022 only. All transactions reported thereafter by the receiving branches will be reported and accounted for in the usual mann er in the accounts of the month of report irrespective of the date of \ntransaction. Following the special arrangements for March 2022 transactions, it is \nnecessary for the Nodal/Focal Point branches to prepare two sets of DMS to be submitted to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers for March 2022 transactions \u2013  one \nfor transactions upto March 31, 2022 and another for March Residual transactions adjusted by Nodal/Focal Point branches with Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur, during April 1 to April 11, 2022.  4 \n 3. Since the Nodal/Focal Point branch will also be reporting the April 2022 transactions \npertaining to year 2022- 23 in addition to March 2022 Residual transactions, monthly \nstatement for April  2022 transactions should be compiled and furnished to Zonal Accounts \nOfficers/Pay and Accounts Officers in the usual way. In order to distinguish the April 2022 \n(year 2022- 23) and March Residual Transactions, the statement pertaining to March \nResidual Transact ions should be clearly marked as \"March Residual Account\". The \nstatement of March (Residual) Transactions should be sent by all Focal Point Branches to \nZonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts O fficers latest by April 18, 2022.  \nNote: As advised in our cir cular GA.NB.No.376/42.01.001/1995- 96 dated May 22, 1996 all \nthe cheques/amounts real ized on or before March 31, 2022  should be treated as \ntransactions relating to the current financial year as \"March 2022 or March Residual \nTransactions\", the reporting of w hich may take place during the month of April (upto April \n11, 2022). But if any cheque is tendered on or before March 31, 2022 and realised on or \nafter April 1, 2022, it will be treated as transaction for the next financial year as \"April \nTransactions\".

INTRODUCTION  \nBanks, with their vast branch network throughout the length and breadth of the \ncountry, occupy a very strategic position in the financial system and have an important \nrole to play in providing credit to the housing sector.   \n2. VARIOUS REGULATIONS  \nWhile formulating their policies, banks have to take into account the following RBI \nguidelines and ensure that bank credit is used for production, constructions activities \nand not for activities connected with speculation in real estate.  \n(A) ACQUISITION OF LAND  \nBank finance can be granted only for purchase of a plot, provided a declaration is \nobtained from the borrower that he intends to construct a house on the said plot, with \nthe help of bank finance or otherwise, within such period as  may be laid down by the \nbanks themselves.  \n(B) CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDING / READY- BUILT HOUSE  \n(i) Banks may grant loans to individuals for purchase/construction of dwelling unit per \nfamily and loans for repairs to the damaged dwelling units of families.  \n(ii) Bank s may extend finance to a person who already owns a house in town/village \nwhere he resides, for buying/ constructing a second house in the same or other town/ \nvillage for the purpose of self -occupation.  \n(iii) Bank s may extend finance for purchase of a house by a borrower who proposes \nto let it out on rental basis on account of his posting outside the headquarters or because he has been provided accommodation by his employer.  \n(iv) Bank s may extend finance to a person who proposes to buy an old house where \nhe is presently residing as a tenant.  \n(v) Banks may finance for construction meant for improving the conditions in slum \nareas for which credit may be extended directly to the slum -dwellers on the guarantee \nof the Government, or indirectly to them through the State Governments.  \n(vi) Bank s may provide credit for slum improvement schemes to be implemented by \nSlum Clearance Boards and other public agencies.  5 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  (vii) Banks are advised to also adhere to the following conditions, in the light of the \nobservations of Delhi High Court on unauthorized construction:  \n(a) In cases where the applicant owns a plot/land and approaches the banks/FIs for a \ncredit facility to constr uct a house, a copy of the sanctioned plan by competent \nauthority in the name of a person applying for such credit facility must be obtained by \nthe Banks/FIs before sanctioning the home loan.  \n(b) An affidavit- cum-undertaking must be obtained from the person applying for such \ncredit facility that he shall not violate the sanctioned plan, construction shall be strictly \nas per the sanctioned plan and it shall be the sole responsibility of the executants to obtain completion certificate within 3 months of compl etion of construction, failing \nwhich the bank shall have the power and the authority to recall the entire loan with \ninterest, costs and other usual bank charges.  \n(c) An Architect appointed by the bank must also certify at various stages of \nconstruction of building that the construction of the building is strictly as per sanctioned plan and shall also certify at a particular point of time that the completion certificate of \nthe building issued by the competent authority has been obtained.  \n(d) In cases where t he applicant approaches the bank/FIs for a credit facility to \npurchase a built up house/flat, it should be mandatory for him to declare by way of an \naffidavit -cum-undertaking that the built up property has been constructed as per the \nsanctioned plan and/or  building bye- laws and as far as possible has a completion \ncertificate also.  \n(e) An Architect appointed by the bank must also certify before disbursement of the \nloan that the built up property is strictly as per sanctioned plan and/or building bye-\nlaws.  \n(f) No loan should be given in respect of those properties which fall in the category of \nunauthorized colonies unless and until they have been regularized and development \nand other charges paid.  \n(g) No loan should also be given in respect of properties meant  for residential use but \nwhich the applicant intends to use for commercial purposes and declares so while \napplying for loan.  6 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  (viii) Supplementary Finance  \n(a) Banks may consider requests for additional finance within the overall ceiling for \ncarrying out alt erations/ additions/repairs to the house/flat already financed by them.  \n(b) In the case of individuals who might have raised funds for construction/ acquisition \nof accommodation from other sources and need supplementary finance, banks may \nextend such finance after obtaining paripassu or second mortgage charge over the \nproperty mortgaged in favour of other lenders and/or against such other security, as \nthey may deem appropriate.  \n(c) Banks may consider for grant of finance to \u2013  \ni. the bodies constituted for undertaking repairs to houses, and \nii. the owners of building/house/flat, whether occupied by themselves or by \ntenants, to meet the need- based requirements for their repairs/additions, after \nsatisfying themselves regarding the estimated cost (for which requisite certificate should be obtained from an Engineer / Architect, wherever \nnecessary) and obtaining such security as deemed appropriate.  \n(ix) Bank finance should, however, not be granted for the following:  \n(a) Banks should not grant finance for construction of buildings meant purely for \nGovernment/Semi -Government offices, including Municipal and Panchayat offices. \nHowever, banks may grant loans for activities, which will be refinanced by institutions \nlike NABARD.  \n(b) Projects undertaken by public sector entities which are not corporate bodies (i.e. \npublic sector undertakings which are not registered under Companies Act or which are not Corporations established under the relevant statute) may not be financed by banks. Even in respect of projects undertaken by corporate bodies, as defined above, banks should satisfy themselves that the project is run on commercial lines and that bank finance is not in lieu of or to substitute budgetary resources envisaged for the project. The loan could, however, supplement budgetary  resources if such \nsupplementing was contemplated in the project design. Thus, in the case of a housing project, where the project is run on commercial lines, and the Government is interested in promoting the project either for the benefit of the weaker sections of the society or 7 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  otherwise, and a part of the project cost is met by the Government through subsidies \nmade available and/or contributions to the capital of the institutions taking up the project, the bank finance should be restricted to an amount arrived at after reducing from the total project cost the amount of subsidy/capital contribution receivable from the Government and any other resources proposed to be made available by the \nGovernment.  \n(c) Banks had, in the past, sanctioned term loans to Cor porations set up by \nGovernment like State Police Housing Corporation, for construction of residential \nquarters for allotment to employees where the loans were envisaged to be repaid out of budgetary allocations. As these projects cannot be considered to be run on \ncommercial lines, it would not be in order for banks to grant loans to such projects.   \n(C) LENDING TO HOUSING INTERMEDIARY AGENCIES  \n(i) Financing of Land Acquisition \n(a) In view of the need to increase the availability of land and house sites for increasing the housing stock in the country, banks may extend finance to public agencies and not private builders for acquisition and development of land, provided it is a part of the complete project, including development of infrastructure such as water systems, drainage, roads, provision of electricity, etc. Such credit may be extended by way of term loans. The project should be completed as early as possible and, in any case, within three years, so as to ensure quick re- cycling of bank funds for optimum  results. \nIf the project covers construction of houses, credit extended therefor in respect of individual beneficiaries should be on the same terms and conditions as stipulated for \nfinancing the beneficiary directly.  \n(b) Banks should have a Board approved policy in place for valuation of properties \nincluding collaterals accepted for their exposures and that valuation should be done \nby professionally qualified independent valuers.  \n(c) As regards the valuation of land for the purpose of financing of land acqu isition as \nalso land secured as collateral, banks may be guided as under:  \n(i) Banks may extend finance to public agencies and not to private builders for \nacquisition and development of land, provided it is a part of the complete project, \nincluding developm ent of infrastructure such as water systems, drainage, roads, 8 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  provision of electricity, etc. In such limited cases where land acquisition can be \nfinanced, the finance is to be limited to the acquisition price (current price) plus development cost. The valuation of such land as prime security should be limited to \nthe current market price.  \n(ii) Wherever land is accepted as collateral, valuation of such land should be at the current market price only.  \n(ii) Lending to Housing Finance Institutions \nBanks may grant term loans to housing finance institutions taking into account (long-\nterm) debt -equity ratio, track record, recovery performance and other relevant factors \nincluding the provisions of  Master Circular -  Bank Finance to Non- Banking Financial \nCompanies (NBFCs) dated January 05, 2022 . \n(iii) Lending to Housing Boards and Other Agencies  \nBanks may extend term loans to state level housing boards and other public agencies. Howev er, in order to develop a healthy housing finance system, while doing so, the \nbanks must not only keep in view the past performance of these agencies in the matter of recovery from the beneficiaries but they should also stipulate that the Boards will \nensur e prompt and regular recovery of loan instalment s from the beneficiaries.  \n(iv) Term Loans to Private Builders \na. In view of the important role played by professional builders as providers of \nconstruction services in the housing field, especially where land is  acquired and \ndeveloped by State Housing Boards and other public agencies, commercial banks may extend credit to private builders on commercial terms by way of \nloans linked to each specific project.  \nb. Banks however, are not permitted to extend fund based or non- fund based \nfacilities to private builders for acquisition of land even as part of a housing project.  \nc. The period of credit for loans extended by banks to private builders may be \ndecided by banks themselves based on their commercial judgment subject to usual safeguards and after obtaining such security, as banks may deem \nappropriate.  9 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  d. Such credit may be extended to builders of repute, employing professionally \nqualified personnel. It should be ensured, through close monitoring, that no part \nof such funds is  used for any speculation in land.  \ne. Care should also be taken to see that prices charged from the ultimate \nbeneficiaries do not include any speculative element, that is, prices should be based only on the documented price of land, the actual cost of construction and \na reasonable profit margin.  \n(v) Terms and Conditions for Lending to Housing Intermediary Agencies \na. In order to enhance the flow of resources to housing sector, term loans may be \ngranted by banks to housing intermediary agencies against the direct loans sanctioned/ proposed to be sanctioned by the latter, irrespective of the per \nborrower size of the loan extended by these agencies.  \nb. Banks can grant term loans to housing intermediary agencies against the direct \nloans sanctioned/proposed to be sanctioned by them to Non- Resident Indians \nalso. However, banks should ensure that housing finance intermediary agencies being financed by them are authorised by RBI to grant housing loans to NRIs as all housing finance intermediaries are not authorised by RBI to \nprovide housing finance to NRIs.  \nc. Banks should charge interest in accordance with provisions contained in the \nMaster Direction -  Reserve Bank of India (Interest Rate on Advances) \nDirections, 2016 , as amended from time to time.  \n(vi) Adherence to guidelines on Commercial Real Estate (CRE) exposure \nLending to housing intermediary agencies will be subject to the circular \nDBOD.BP.BC.No.42/08.12.015/ 2009- 10 dated September 9, 2009  on Guidelines on \nclassification of exposures as commercial real estate (CRE)  exposure and the circular \nDBOD.BP.BC.No. 104/08.12.015/2012- 13 dated June 21, 2013  on Housing Sector: \nNew sub -sector CRE (Residential Housing) within CRE & Rationalisation of \nprovisioning, ris k-weight and LTV ratios . \n \n 10 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  3. QUANTUM OF LOAN  \n(a) While deciding the quantum of loan to be granted as housing finance, banks should \nabide by the following Loan to Value ( LTV) and Risk Weights (RWs) : \nCategory of Loan  LTV Ratio (%)  Risk Weight (%)  \n(a) Individual Housing Loans    \nUpto \u20b9 30 lakh < 80 35 \n> 80 and  < 90 50 \nAbove \u20b9 30 lakh & upto \u20b9 75 lakh  < 80 35 \nAbove \u20b9 75 lakh  < 75 50 \n   \n(b) CRE \u2013 RH NA 75 \n \nAs a counter cyclical measure, for Individual Housing Loans sanctioned on or after \nOctober 16, 2020 and up to March 31, 2022, the risk weights shall be as per the \ncircular DOR.No.BP.BC.24/08.12.015/2020- 21 dated October 16, 2020  on Individua l \nHousing Loans \u2013  Rationalisation of Risk Weights.  The risk weights are as under -  \nLTV Ratio (%)  Risk Weight (%)  \n\u2264 80 35 \n> 80 and \u2264 90  50 \n \n(b) In order to have uniformity in the practices adopted for deciding the value of the \nhouse property while sanctioning housing loans, banks should not include stamp duty, registration and other documentation charges in the cost of the housing property they \nfinance so that the effectiveness of LTV norms is not diluted.  \n(c) However, in cases where the cost of the house/dwelling units does not exceed \nRs.10 lakh, bank may add stamp duty, registration and other documentation charges to the cost of the house/dwelling unit for the purpose of calculating LTV ratio.  \n 11 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  4. INNOVATIVE HOUSING LOAN PRODUCTS \u2013  UPFRONT DISBURSAL OF \nHOUSING LOANS  \n(a) It has been observed that some banks have introduced certain innovative Housing \nLoan Schemes in association with developers / builders, e.g. upfront disbursal of \nsanctioned individual housing loans to the builders without linking the disbursals to \nvarious stages of construction of housing project, Interest/EMI on the housing loan availed of by the individual borrower being serviced by the builders during the construction period/ specified period, etc. This might include signing of tri partite \nagreement between the bank, the builder and the buyer of the housing unit. These \nloans products are popularly known by various names like 80:20, 75:25 schemes.  \n(b) Such housing loan products are likely to expose the banks as well as their home \nloan borrowers to additional risks e.g. in case of dispute between individual borrowers \nand developers/builders, default/ delayed payment of interest/ EMI by the developer/ \nbuilder during the agreed period on behalf of the borrower, non- completion of the \nproject on time etc. Further, any delayed payments by developers/ builders on behalf of individual borrowers to banks may lead to lower credit rating/ scoring of such borrowers by credit information companies (CICs) as information about servicing of loans get passed on to the CICs on a regular basis. In cases, where bank loans are also disbursed upfront on behalf of their individual borrowers in a lump- sum to builders/ \ndevelopers without any linkage to stages of constructions, banks run \ndisproportionately higher  exposures with concomitant risks of diversion of funds.  \n(c) Disbursal of housing loans sanctioned to individuals should be closely linked to the \nstages of construction of the housing project / houses and upfront disbursal should not be made in cases of incomplete / under -construction / green field housing projects.  \n(d) However, in cases of projects sponsored by Government/Statutory Authorities, \nbanks may disburse the loans as per the payment stages prescribed by such \nauthorities, even where payments sought  from house buyers are not linked to the \nstages of constructions, provided such authorities have no past history of non-\ncompletion of projects.  \n(e) It is emphasized that banks while introducing any kind of product should take into \naccount the customer suitability and appropriateness issues and also ensure that the 12 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  borrowers/ customers are made fully aware of the risks and liabilities under such \nproducts.  \n5. RATE OF INTEREST  \nBanks should charge interest on housing finance granted by them in accordance with \nthe provisions contained in the Master Direction -  Reserve Bank of India (Interest Rate \non Advances) Directions, 2016 , as amended from time to time.  \n6. APPROVALS FROM STATUTORY/ REGULATORY AUTHORITIES  \nWhile appraising loan proposals involving real estate, banks should ensure that the borrowers should have obtained prior permission from government / local governments / other statutory authorities for the project, wherever required. In order that the loan approval process is not hampered on account of this, while the proposals could be s anctioned in normal course, the disbursements should be made only after \nthe borrower has obtained requisite clearances from the government authorities.  \n7. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS  \nIn view of the observations of Hon\u2019ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay, while granting finance to specific housing / development projects, banks are advised to \nstipulate as a part of the terms and conditions that:  \n(a) the builder / developer / company would disclose in the Pamphlets / Brochures etc., the name(s) of the bank(s) t o which the property is mortgaged.  \n(b) the builder / developer / company would append the information relating to \nmortgage while publishing advertisement of a particular scheme in newspapers / \nmagazines etc.  \n(c) the builder / developer / company would indi cate in their pamphlets / brochures, \nthat they would provide No Objection Certificate (NOC) / permission of the mortgagee bank for sale of flats / property, if required.  \n(d) Banks are advised to ensure compliance of the above terms and conditions and \nfunds  should not be released unless the builder/developer/company fulfils the above \nrequirements.  13 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  (e) The above- mentioned provisions will be mutatis -mutandis, applicable to \nCommercial Real Estate also.  \n8. EXPOSURE TO REAL ESTATE  \nBanks are well advised to frame comprehensive prudential norms relating to the ceiling \non the total amount of real estate loans, single/group exposure limit for such loans, margins, security, repayment schedule and availability of supplementary finance and \nthe policy should be approved b y the bank\u2019s board. While framing the bank\u2019s policy \nthe guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank should be taken into account.  \n9. HOUSING LOANS UNDER PRIORITY SECTOR  \nThe grant of housing loan for the purpose of the priority sector lending targets including \nreporting requirements will be subject to the instructions on \u201cPriority Sector Lending\u201d \nas amended from time to time.  \n10. FINANCING  OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING -ISSUE OF LONG -TERM  BONDS BY \nBANKS  \nBanks can issue long -term bonds with a minimum maturity of seven years  to raise \nresources for lending to affordable housing subject to the conditions mentioned in circular DBR.BP.BC.No.25/08.12.014/2014- 15 dated July 15, 2014\n on \u201cIssue of \nLong term Bonds by Banks - Financing of Infrastructure and Affordable Housing\u201d , and \nrelated circulars on the subject1.  \n11. ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES  \nIt is advised that banks should adhere to the National Building Code (NBC) formulated by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in view of the importance of safety of buildings especially against natural disasters. Banks may consider this aspect for incorporation in their loan policies. Banks should also adopt the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) guidel ines and suitably incorporate them as part of their loan \npolicies, procedures and documentation.  \n  \n                                                            \n1 Circular DBR.BP.BC.No.50/08.12.014/2014-15 dated November 27, 2014, circular  \nDBR.BP.BC.No.98/08.12.014/2014- 15 dated June 01, 2015  and circular  DOR.No.BP.BC.41/08.12.014/2019-20 \ndated March 17, 2020 . 14 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Housing Finance \u2013 2022\"  Appendix  \nList of Circulars consolidated by Master Circular on Housing Finance \nSl.

The words and \nexpressions used in these notes shall have the same meaning as in the Act. \n(1) Acquisition of Financial Assets \ni) Every ARC is required to evolve Asset Acquisition Policy within 90 days of getting \nthe certificate of registration which shall, inter alia, provide that the transactions will \ntake place in a transparent manner and at a fair price in a wellinformed market, and \nthe transactions are executed on arm's length basis by exercise of due diligence.  \nii) The share of financial assets to be acquired from the bank / FI should be \nappropriately and objectively worked out keeping in view the provision in the Act requiring consent of secured creditors holding not less than 60% of the amount \noutstanding to a borrower for the purpose of enforcement of security interest;  \niii) For easy and faster realisability, all the financial assets due from a single debtor \nto various banks/ FIs may be considered for acquisition. Similarly, financial assets \nhaving linkages to the same collateral may be considered for acquisition to ensure \nrelatively faster and easy realisation.  \niv) Both fund and non-fund based financial assets may be included in the list of \nassets for acquisition. Assets classified as SMA -2 in the books of the originator may \nalso be acquired. \nv) Acquisition of funded assets should not include takeover of outstanding \ncommitments, if any, of any bank/ FI to lend further. Terms of acquisition of security \ninterest in non-fund transactions, should provide for the relative commitments to \ncontinue with bank/ FI, till demand for funding arises.  \nvi) Loans not backed by proper documentation should be avoided.  \nvii) As far as possible, the valuation process should be uniform for assets of same profile and should ensure that the valuation of the financial assets is done in \nscientific and objective manner. Valuation may be done internally or by engaging an \nindependent agency, depending upon the value of the assets. Ideally, valuation may \nbe entrusted to the committee authorised to approve acquisition of assets, which 35 \n may carry out the task in line with an Asset Acquisition Policy laid down by the board \nof directors in this regard. \nviii) The assets acquired by ARC should be transferred to the trusts set up by the \nARC at the price at which these were acquired from the originator of the asset. \nHowever, there is no restriction on acquisition of assets from banks/ FIs directly in \nthe books of trusts set up by ARC.  \n(2) Issuance of SRs  \ni) Every A RC shall issue the SRs  through the trust set up exclusively for the \npurpose. The trusteeship of such trust shall vest with the ARC.  \nii) The trust shall issue SRs  only to QBs and such SRs shall be transferable/ \nassignable only in favour of other Q Bs. \niii) Every A RC intending to issue SRs  shall make disclosures in the offer document \nas prescribed by the Bank from time to time. \n46[(iv) Commonality and conflict of interest,  if any, between the ARC and Rating \nAgency should be disclosed. \n(v) Special features of SRs  \n(a) SRs cannot be strictly characterized as debt instruments since they combine \nthe features of both equity and debt. However, these are recognized as \nsecurities under Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. \n(b) The cash flows from the underlying assets cannot be predicted in terms of \nvalue and intervals. \n(c) These instruments when rated would generally be below investment grade. \nThese instruments are privately placed.  \n(vi) Rating/ Grading of SRs  \n47(a) Every ARC shall obtain initial rating/ grading of SRs from a 48[SEBI \nregistered] CRA within  a period of six months from the date of acquisition of \n                                            \n46 Inserted vide Guidelines DNBS (PD) CC.No.6/SCRC/10.30.049/2006- 2007 dated May 28, 2007  36 \n assets and declare forthwith, the NAV of the SRs issued by it. Thereafter, ARCs \nwill get the rating/ grading of SRs reviewed from a registered CRA as on June \n30, and December 31 every year and declare the NAV of SRs forthwith, to \nenable the QBs to value their investment in SRs. For arriving at NAV, ARC shall \nget the SRs rated on \u2018recovery rating scale\u2019 and require the rating agencies to \ndisclose the rationale for rating. \n(b) The rating/ grading should be based on \u2018recovery risk\u2019 as against \u2018 default\u2019 \nwhich is the basis for rating assignments in normal assets, i.e. how much more \ncan be recovered instead of timely payment.   Rating should reflect present \nvalue of the anticipated recoverability of future cash flows.  \n(c) The ratings will be assigned on a specifically developed rating scale called \n\u201cRecovery Rating (RR) scale\u201d. Each rating category in the recovery scale will \nhave an associate range of recovery, expressed in percentage terms, which \ncan be used for arriving at NAV of SRs. Symbols should be assigned by rating \nagencies to the associated range of recovery, which would inter -se not deviate \nby a specified percentage points, say (+/ -) 10%. The rating would be indicative. \n(d) The Recovery Rating should be assessed after factoring in any other \nrelevant obligation and not on the original debt obligation.  \n(e) The other key factors that should be factored in while ass igning Recovery \nRating are extent of debt acquired, composition of lenders, collaterals available, \nsecurity and seniority of debt, individual lender vis -\u00e0-vis institutional lender, \nestimated cash flows, uncertainty in realising expected cash flows in initi al \nperiod, management, business risk, financial risk, etc.  \n(f) The Recovery Rating should reflect changes like change in resolution \nstrategy of the ARC that take place from time to time. \n(g) The Recovery Rating will factor in likely cash flows from the underlying \nimpaired assets till the maturity of the SRs. \n(h) The Recovery Rating should comprise of rating of not only the SRs of the \nscheme as a whole but wherever feasible a desegregation of each component \n                                                                                                                                           \n47 Inserted vide Notification No.DNBS(PD- SC/RC) No.11/PCGM (KKV)/ -2014 dated August 05, 2014  \n48 Inserted vide Guidelines DNBS (PD) CC.No.6/SCRC/10.30.049/2006- 2007 dated May 28, 2007  37 \n in the scheme, which means the underlying assets of  each entity in the scheme \nforming the basket should also be rated. \n(i) The Rating Agency should disclose the rationale for rating on request.  \n  (vii) Methodology for valuation of SRs for declaration of NAV  \nEach rating category in the recovery scale will have an associate range of recovery, \nexpressed in percentage terms, which can be used for computing NAV of SRs. The \nNAV should be restricted within the recovery range associated with the rating \nassigned to the SRs. The ARC based on its recovery experience should choose a \nparticular percentage within the recovery range indicated by the Rating Agency. The \nRecovery Rating percentage so picked by the ARC multiplied by the face value of the \nSR will give the NAV. The ARC should provide the rationale for selection of the \nparticular percentage of Recovery Rating. For example, if range is between 81% - \n90%, ARC may pick up 87% based on its judgement. The face value of say Rs 10 \nmultiplied by the recovery percentage i.e. 87% would give the NAV as Rs 8.70].  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 38 \n  \nList of Notifications Issued \n \n1.

Introduction  \nReserve Bank of India has been regulating the financial activities of the Non- Banking \nFinancial Companies under  the provisions of  Chapter III B  of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia Act, 1934. With the amendment of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 in \nJanuary 1997, in terms of  Section 45 IA  of the said Act, and amendment of the \nNational Housing Bank Act, 1987 in August 2019, in terms of Section 29 A of the \nNational Housing Bank Act, 1987, all Non -Banking Financial Companies including  \nHousing Finance Companies  have to be mandatorily registered with the Reserve Bank \nof India.  \n1.1 Terminology  \na. 'NBFCs' means the Non- Banking Financial Companies  registered with the  \nReserve Bank of India, which shall also include Housing Finance Company \n(HFC) registered under Section 29 A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987.  \nb. 'Current investments' means the investments classified in the balanc e sheet of \nthe borrower as 'current assets' and are intended to be held for less than one \nyear.  \nc. 'Long term investments' means all types of investments other than that classified as 'current assets'.  \nd. 'Unsecured loans' means the loans not secured by any tangible asset.  \n \n1.2 Background  \nThe credit related matters of banks have been progressively deregulated by Reserve \nBank of India. Consistent with the policy of bestowing greater operational freedom to \nbanks in the matter of credit dispensation and in the context of mandatory registration of NBFCs with the Reserve Bank, most of the aspects relating to financing of NBFCs by banks have also been deregulated. However, in view of the sensitivities attached to financing of certain types of activities undertaken by NBFCs, restrictions on \nfinancing of such activities continue to be in force.  \n 5 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Bank Finance to NBFCs \u2013  2022\"  2. Bank Finance to NBFCs registered with RBI  \n2.1 The ceiling on bank credit linked to Net Owned Fund (NOF) of NBFCs has been \nwithdrawn in respect of all NBFCs which are statut orily registered with RBI and are \nengaged in principal business of asset financing, loan, factoring and investment \nactivities. Accordingly, banks may extend need based working capital facilities as well as term loans to all NBFCs registered with RBI and engaged in infrastructure financing, \nequipment leasing, hire- purchase, loan, factoring and investment activities  subject to \nprovisions of para 8 of these guidelines . \n2.2 In the light of the experience gained by NBFCs in financing second hand assets, \nbanks may also extend finance to NBFCs against second hand assets financed by \nthem.  \n2.3 Banks may formulate suitable loan policy with the approval of their Boards of \nDirectors within the prudential guidelines and exposure norms prescribed by the Reserve Bank to ex tend various kinds of credit facilities to NBFCs subject to the \ncondition that the activities indicated in paragraphs 4 and 6 are not financed by them.  \n \n3. Bank Finance to NBFCs not requiring Registration1 \nIn terms of \u201c Master Direction -  Exemptions from the provisions of RBI Act, 1934\u201d  dated \nAugust 25, 2016 , few categories of non- banking financial companies are exempted \nfrom certain provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (the RBI Act, 1934), including the need for registration with the Reserve B ank. For such NBFCs not \nneeding registration with the R eserve Bank,\n banks may take their credit decisions on \nthe basis of usual factors like the purpose of credit, nature and quality of underlying \nassets, repayment capacity of borrowers as also risk perception, etc.  \n \n4. Activities not e ligible for Bank Credit  \n4.1 The following activities undertaken by NBFCs, are not eligible for bank credit:  \n(i) Bills discounted / rediscounted by NBFCs, except for rediscounting of bills \ndiscounted by NBFCs arising from sale of -  \n                                                            \n1 While financing NBFCs, which do not require registration with RBI, banks should also refer to the guidelines / \nnotifications issued in this regard from time to time by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India.  6 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Bank Finance to NBFCs \u2013  2022\"  (a) commercial vehicles (including light commerci al vehicles), and \n(b) two wheeler and three wheeler vehicles, subject to the following conditions :  \n\u2022 the bills should have been drawn by the manufacturer on dealers only;  \n\u2022 the bills should represent genuine sale transactions as may be ascertained from \nthe chassis / engine number; and \n\u2022 before rediscounting the bills, banks should satisfy themselves about the bona fides and track record of NBFCs which have discounted the bills.  \n(ii) Investments of NBFCs both of current and long- term nature, in any  company / enti ty \nby way of shares, debentures, etc. However, Stock Broking Companies may be \nprovided need- based credit against shares and debentures held by them as stock -in-\ntrade.  \n(iii) Unsecured loans / inter -corporate deposits by NBFCs to / in any company.  \n(iv) All t ypes of loans and advances by NBFCs to their subsidiaries, group companies \n/ entities.  \n(v) Finance to NBFCs for further lending to individuals for subscribing to Initial Public \nOfferings (IPOs) and for purchase of shares from secondary market.  \n4.2 Leased and Sub- Leased Assets \nAs banks can extend financial assistance to equipment leasing companies, they \nshould not enter into lease agreements departmentally with such companies as well \nas other Non- Banking Financial Companies engaged in equipment leasing.  \n \n5. Bank Finance to Factoring Companies  \nNotwithstanding the restrictions mentioned at Paragraph 4 .1 (i) and 4.1 (iv) above, \nbanks can extend financial assistance to support the factoring business of Factoring Companies, which comply with the following criteria:  \n(a) The companies qualify as factoring companies and carry out their business under \nthe provisions of the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 and Notifications issued by the \nReserve Bank in this regard from time to time.  \n(b) They derive at least 50 per cent of their income from factoring activity.  7 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Bank Finance to NBFCs \u2013  2022\"  (c) The receivables purchased / financed, irrespective of whether on 'with recourse' or \n'without recourse' basis, form at least 50 per cent of the assets of the Factoring \nCompany.  \n(d) The assets / income referred to above would not include the assets / income \nrelating to any bill discounting facility extended by the Factoring Company.  \n(e) The financial assistance extended by the Factoring Companies is secured by hypothecation or assignment of receivables in their favour.  \n \n6. Other Prohibitions on Bank Finance to NBFCs  \n6.1 Bridge loans / interim finance \nBanks should not grant bridge loans of any nature, or interim finance against capital / debenture issues and / or in the form of loans of a bridging nature pending r aising of \nlong- term funds from the market by way of capital, deposits, etc. to all categories of \nNon-Banking Financial Companies. Banks should strictly follow these instructions and \nensure that they are not circumvented in any manner whatsoever by purport and / or intent by sanction of credit under a different nomenclature like unsecured negotiable notes, floating rate interest bonds, etc., as also short -term loans, the repayment of \nwhich is proposed / expected to be made out of funds to be or likely to be mobilised from external / other sources and not out of the surplus generated by the use of the \nasset(s).  \n6.2 Advances against collateral security of shares to NBFCs  \nShares and debentures cannot be accepted as collateral securities for secured loans granted to NBFC borrowers for any purpose.  \n6.3 Restriction on guarantees for placement of funds with NBFCs  \nBanks should not execute guarantees covering inter -company deposits / loans thereby \nguaranteeing refund of deposits / loans accepted by NBFCs / firms from o ther NBFCs \n/ firms.

However, based \non the risk perception, more stringent  exposure limits in respect of certain categories \nof NBFCs may be considered by banks . Banks\u2019 exposures to a group of connected \nNBFCs or group of connected counterparties having NBFCs in the group will be \nrestricted to 25 percent of their Tier I Capital  as detailed in circular on Large Exposures \nFramework dated June 03, 2019  read with circular on Large Exposures Framework \ndated September 12,  2019 . \n7.3 The exposure of a bank to a single NBFC which is predominantly engaged in \nlending against collateral of gold jewellery (i.e. such loans comprising 50 per cent or more of their financial assets), shall not exceed 7.5 per cent of the bank \u2019s capital funds  \n(Tier I plus  Tier II Capital).  However, this exposure ceiling may go up by 5 per cent, \ni.e., up to 12.5 per cent of banks\u2019 capital funds if the additional exposure is on account of funds on -lent by such NBFCs to the infrastructure sector  as detailed in \ncircular   on \nBank Finance to NBFCs Predominantly Engaged in lending against Gold dated May \n18, 2012 .  \n7.4 Banks may also consider fixing internal limits for their aggregate exposure to all \nNBFCs put together.   \n7.5 Banks should have an internal sub- limit on their aggregate exposures to all \nNBFCs, having gold loans to the extent of 50 per cent or more of their total financial assets, taken together. This sub -limit should be within the internal limit fixed by the \nbanks for their aggregate exposure to all NBFCs put together as prescribed in \nparagraph 7.4 above.   9 \n\"DOR \u2013 MC \u2013 Bank Finance to NBFCs \u2013  2022\"  7.6 Infusion of eligible capital funds after the published balance sheet date may also \nbe tak en into account for the purpose of computing exposure ceiling. Banks should \nobtain an external auditor's certificate on completion of the augmentation of capital \nand submit the same to the Reserve Bank of India (Department of Supervision) before \nreckoning the additions to capital funds  \n7.7. Banks shall adhere to the intra-group limits in accordance with Guidelines on \nManagement of Intra -Group Transactions and Exposures dated February 11, 2014 .  \n \n8.
