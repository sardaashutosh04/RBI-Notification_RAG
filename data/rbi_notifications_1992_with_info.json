At present, \nfixed rates of interest are prescribed for term deposits for three maturity periods in the range of \n11.0 per cent per annum to 13.0 per cent per annum. As a step towards further rationalisation of \ndeposit rates, the number of rates prescribed is being reduced. It has been decided that effective \nApril 22, 1992, the deposit rates for maturity of 46 days to 3 years and above would be a single prescription of 'not exceeding 13.0 per cent per annum'. The revised structur e of deposit rates are \nset out in the annexure to the dire ctive enclosed. The revised struct ure of deposit rates will apply \nonly to fresh deposits and on renewals of maturing deposits.\n \n2. Banks are advised to use utmost discretion in o ffering deposit rates on va rious maturities within \nthe gap of 13.0 per cent. The deposit rates offered for various maturities need to be based on cost \nof funds, return on funds and the inter-bank borrowi ng/lending status of individual banks. At any \npoint of time, individual banks have to adopt un iform rates at all their branches and for all \ncustomers. While banks are free to determine the maturities and deposit rates, they would be \nrequired to prescribe a minimum of three maturities of their choice and the rates for each maturity \nshould have an interest rate differential between any two successive maturity slabs of at least 0.25 percentage point. The banks should carefully set t heir own deposit rates taking into account their \nperception of the future course of inflation and real rates of interest.\n \n3. An amending directive RPCD.No.RF.DIR.BC.113/D. 1-91/92 dated 21 April 1992 in this regard is \nenclosed.  \n4.
