LEI has been introduced by the Reserve Bank in a phased manner for \nparticipants in the over the counter (OTC) derivative, non- derivative markets, large \ncorporate borrowers and large value transactions in centralised payment systems.  \n2. In order to further harness the benefits of LEI, it has been decided that AD Category I  \nbanks, with effect from October 1, 2022, shall obtain the LEI number from the resident \nentities (non- individuals) undertaking capital or current account transactions of \u20b950 crore \nand above (per transaction) under FEMA, 1999. As regards non- resident counterparts/ \noverseas entities, in case of non- availability of LEI information, AD Category I banks may \nprocess the transactions to avoid disruptions.  Further, AD Category I banks may \nencourage concerned entities to voluntarily furnish LEI while undertaking transactions \neven before October 1, 2022. Once an entity has obtained an LEI number, it must be \nreported in all transactions of that entity, irrespective of transaction size.  \n3. AD Category -I banks shall have the required systems in place to capture the LEI \ninformation and ensure that any LEI captured is validated against the global LEI database \navailable on the website of the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).  \n4. AD banks may bring the contents of this circular to the notice of their constituents \nconcerned and advise entities who undertake large value transactions (\u20b950 crore and \nabove) under FEMA, 1999 to obtain LEI in time, if they do not already have one issued.  5. Entities can obtain LEI from any of the Local Operating Units (LOUs) accredited by the \nGLEIF, the body tasked to support the implementation and use of LEI. In India, LEI can \nbe obtained from Legal Entity Identifier India Ltd. (LEIL) ( https://www.ccilindia -lei.co.in ), \nwhich is also reco gnised as an issuer of LEI by the Reserve Bank under the Payment and \nSettlement Systems Act, 2007.

Change in all -in-cost ceiling for new ECBs/ TCs: To take into account \ndifferences in credit risk and term premia between LIBOR and the ARRs , the all -\nin-cost ceiling for new FCY ECBs and TCs has been increased by 50 bps to 500 \nbps and 300 bps , respectively , over the benchmark rates.  \niii. One Time Adjustment in  all-in-cost ceiling for existing ECBs/ TCs: To enable \nsmooth transition of  existing ECBs/ TCs linked to LIBOR whose benchmarks are \nchanged  to ARRs , the all -in cost ceiling for such ECBs/ TCs h as been revised \nupwards  by 100 basis points to 550 bps and 350 bps , respectively , over the ARR . \nAD Category -I banks must ensure that any such revision  in ceiling  is only on \naccount of transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmarks.  \n3.

With a view to ensur ing uniformity in the implementation of IRACP norms  across \nall lending institut ions, certain aspects of the extant  regulatory  guidelines are being \nclarified and/or harmonized, which will be applicable mutatis mutandis  to all lending \ninstitutions. Wherever references to circulars /instructions  applicable to banks have been \nmade, other lending institutions may refer to  instructions as applicable to them.  All the \ninstructions in this circular, except those at paragraphs 2, 8-9 and 13, shall be effective \nimmediately from the date of this circular.  \nA. Specification of due date/repayment date \n2. The extant instructions on IRACP norms specify that an amount is to be treated as \noverdue if it is not paid on the due date fixed by the bank. It has been observed that due \ndates for repayments are sometimes not specifically mentioned in the loan agreements , \nand instead a description of due dates is mentioned, leaving scope for different \ninterpretations . Henceforth, the exact due dates for repaym ent of a loan, frequency of \nrepayment, breakup between principal and interest, examples of SMA/NPA classification \ndates , etc. shall be clearly specified in the loan agreement and the borrower shall be \napprised of the same at the time of loan sanction and also at the time of subsequent \nchanges, if any, to the sanction terms/loan agreement till full repayment of the loan. In \ncases of loan  facilities with moratorium on payment of principal and/or interest, the exact \ndate of commencement of repayment shall also be specified in the loan agreements.  \nThese instructions shall be complied with at the earliest, but not later than December 31, 2021, in respect of fresh loans . In case of existing loans,  however,  compliance to these \ninstructions shall necessarily be ensured as and when such loans become due for renewal/review.  \nB. Classification as Special Mention Account (SMA) and Non- Performing Asset \n(NPA)\n1 \n3. The circular DBR.No.BP.BC.45/21.04.048/2018- 19 dated June 7, 2019  on \u2018Prudential \nFramework for Resolution of Stressed Assets\u2019 requires the lenders to recognize incipient stress in borrower  accounts, immediately on default, by classifying them as special \nmention account s (SMA). In order to remove any ambiguity, it is clarified that the intervals \nare intended to be continuous and accordingly, the basis for classification of SMA categories shall be as follows:  \nLoans  other than revolving facilities  Loans  in the nature of revolving facilities like \ncash credit /overdraft  \nSMA Sub -\ncategories  Basis for classification \u2013 \nPrincipal or interest \npayment or any other \namount wholly or partly \noverdue  SMA Sub -\ncategories  Basis for classification \u2013 \nOutstanding balance remains \ncontinuousl y in excess of the \nsanctioned limit or drawing power, \nwhichever is lower , for a period of:  \nSMA -0 Upto 30 days      \nSMA -1 More than 30 days and \nupto 60 days  SMA -1 More than 30 days and upto 60 \ndays  \nSMA -2 More than 60 days and \nupto 90 days  SMA -2 More than 60 days and upto 90 \ndays  \n                                                            \n1 In case of NBFCs , the references to 90 days for SMA -2/NPA classification may be read as per the applicable norms \nand also subject to the provisions of the circular DOR.CRE.REC.No.60/03.10.001/2021- 22 dated October 22, 2021  on \n\u2018Scale Based Regulation (SBR): A Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs \u2019.  \n \n4. In the above context, it is further clarified that borrower accounts shall be flagged as \noverdue by the lending institutions as part of their day -end processes for the due date, \nirrespective of the time of running such processes. Similarly, classification of borrower \naccounts as SMA as well as NPA shall be done as part of day -end process for the relevant \ndate and the SMA or NPA classification date shall be the calendar date for which the day end process is run. In other words, the date of SMA/NPA shall reflect the asset classification status of an account at the day -end of that calendar date.   \nExample: If due date of a loan account  is March 31, 2021, and full dues are not \nreceived before the lending institution runs the day -end process for this date, the \ndate of overdue shall be March 31, 2021. If it continues to remain overdue, then \nthis account shall get tagged as SMA -1 upon running day -end process on April 30, \n2021 i.e. upon completion of 30 days  of being continuously overdue.  Accordingly , \nthe date of SMA -1 classification for that account shall be April 30, 2021.  \nSimilar ly, if the account continues  to remain overdue, it shall get tagged as SMA -\n2 upon running day -end process  on May 30, 2021 and if continues to remain \noverdue further , it shall get classified as NPA upon running day -end process on  \nJune 29, 2021.   \n 5. It is further clarified that the instructions on SMA classification of borrower accounts \nare applicable to all loan s\n2, including retail loans, irrespective of size of exposure of the \nlending institution.  \n \nC. Clarification regarding definition of \u2018out of order\u2019  \n6. Cash c redit/ Overdraft ( CC/OD ) account  is classified as NPA if it is \u2018out of order\u2019.  In \ncases where the outstanding balance in the principal operating account is less than the \nsanctioned limit/drawing power, t he extant instructions, inter alia , stipulate that the \naccount should be treated as \u2018out of order\u2019 if there are no credits continuously for 90 days \nas on the date of Balance Sheet or credits are not enough to cover the interest debited during the same period. In order to avoid any ambiguit y regarding determination of \u2018out \n                                                            \n2 Agricultural advances governed by crop season- based asset classification norms shall be exempt from this \ninstruction.  of order\u2019 status of CC/OD accounts on a continuous basis, it is clarified that an account \nshall be treated as \u2018out of order\u2019 if:  \ni. the outstanding balance in the CC/OD account  remains continuously in excess of \nthe sanctioned limit/drawing power for 90 days, or  \nii. the outstanding balance in the CC/OD account is less than the sanctioned \nlimit/drawing power but there are no credits continuously for 90 days, or  the \noutstanding balance in the CC/OD account is less than the sanctioned  \nlimit/drawing power but credits are not enough to cover the interest debited during the previous 90 day s period.  \n 7. Accordingly, treatment of CC/OD accounts as \u2018out of order\u2019 on or after the date of this \ncircular shall be based on the above instructions.  \n \nD. NPA classification in case of interest payments \n8. In terms of paragraph 2.1.3 of the Master Circular on IRACP norms  dated October 1, \n2021 , in case of interest payments, an account is classified as NPA only if the interest \ndue and charged during any quarter is not serviced fully within 90 days from the end of the quarter. In order to fully align with the 90 days delinquency norm as well as t he \nrequirement to apply interest at monthly rests, the above instructions are modified as under:  \nIn case of interest payments  in respect of term loans , an account will be classified \nas NPA if the interest applied at specified rests remains overdue for more than 90 \ndays.  \n \n9. These instructions shall be effective from March 31, 2022. Accordingly, in respect of \nany borrower account which becomes overdue on or after March 31, 2022, its \nclassification as NPA shall be based on the account being overdue for more than 90 days.  \n E. Upgradation of accounts classified as NPAs  \n10. It has been observed that some lending institutions upgrade accounts classified as \nNPAs to \u2018standard\u2019 asset category upon payment of only interest overdues, partial overdues, etc. In order to avoid any ambiguity in this regard, it is clarified that loan \naccounts  classified as NPAs  may be upgraded as \u2018standard\u2019 asset only if entire arrears \nof interest and principal are paid by t he borrower . With regard to upgradation of accounts \nclassified as NPA due to restructuring, non- achievement of date of commencement of \ncommercial operations (DCCO) , etc., the instructions as specified for such cases shall \ncontinue to be applicable.   \n \nF. Income recognition policy for loans with moratorium on payment of interest  \n11. In cases of loans where mor atorium has been granted for repayment of interest, \nlending institutions may recognize interest income on accrual basis for account s which \ncontinue to be classified as \u2018standard\u2019. This shall be evaluated against the definition of \n\u2018restructuring\u2019 provided in paragraph 1 of the Annex -1 to the above- mentioned \u2018Prudential \nFramework for Resolution of Stressed Assets\u2019 dated June 7, 2019 . However, income \nrecognition norms for loans towards projects under implementation involving deferment \nof DCCO3 and gold loans for non- agricultural purposes4 shall continue to be governed as \nper the existing instructions.  \n \n12. The extant instructions  (compiled at paragraph 3.2 of the Master Circular on IRACP \nnorms dated October 1, 2021 ) require that once an account is classified as NPA, t he \nentire interest accrued and credited to income account in the past periods , must be \nreversed to the extent it remains unrealised. It is clarified that if loans with moratorium on \npayment of interest (permitted at the time of sanction of the loan) become NPA  after the \nmorat orium period is over , the capitalized interest corresponding to the interest accrued \nduring such moratorium period need not be reversed.  \n \n \n \n                                                            \n3 The income recognition norms for projects under implementation involving deferment of DCCO shall be subject to \nthe instructions at paragraph 4.2.15 of the Master Circular on IRACP norms  dated October 1, 20 21, as updated from \ntime to time.  \n4 The income recognition norms for Loans against Gold Ornaments and Jewellery for Non -Agricultural End- uses shall \nbe subject to the instructions issued vide circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.27/21.04.048/2014- 15 dated July 22, 2014  on the \nsubject, as updated from time to time.   \n G. Consumer Education  \n13. With a view to increas ing awareness among the borrowers, lending institutions shall  \nplace consumer education literature on their websites , explaining with examples, the \nconcepts of date of overdue, SMA and NPA classification and upgradation, with specific \nreference to day -end proc ess. Lending institutions may also consider displaying such \nconsumer education literature in their branches by means of posters and/or  other \nappropriate media. Further, it shall also be ensured that their front- line officers educate \nborrowers about all the se concepts, with respect to loans availed by them , at the time of \nsanction/disbursal /renewal  of loans.  These instructions shall be complied with at the \nearliest, but not later than March 31, 2022.    \n \nYours faithfully,  \n \n \n(Manoranjan Mishra)  \nChief General Manager\n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/125IRAC5D423E89A957430AAEEE46913F90155E.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 12, 2021", "info": "\u0906\u0902\u0924\ufffd\u0930\u0915  \u090b\u0923 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092c\u0902\u0927 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , \u0915\ufffd \u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0940 \u092f  \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\ufffd\u0932\u092f , \u0915\ufffd \u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0940 \u092f  \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\ufffd\u0932\u092f  \u092d\u0935\u0928, 23 \u0935\u0940\u0902 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u095b\u0932 , \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926  \u092d\u0917\u0924 \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\ufffd, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 - 400 001, \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \n\u092b\u094b\u0928: (022)- 2266602 -04; \u092b\u0948 \ufffd  : (022 )-22644158, 22705125 ; \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932: cgmidmd@rbi.org.in  \n\u093f\u0939\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928  \u0939\u0948, \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e  \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u094b\u0917  \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0907\u090f  \nRBI/2021-2022/124 \nCO.IDMD.GBD(P).No.S1242/08.01.001/2021-22        November 12, 2021 \nAl\nl Scheduled Commercial Banks  \nAll State Co-operative Banks / All Scheduled Primary  \n(Urban) Co-operative Banks / All Financial Institutions /  \nAll Primary Dealers/All stock exchanges/  \nClearing Corporation of India Ltd  \nMadam\n/ Dear Sir, \nAuction of G overnment S ecurities: N on-C ompetitive Bidding Facility t o retail investors \nAs part of continuing efforts to increase retail participation in government securities, the \u2018 RBI Retail \nDirect \u2019 Scheme to facilitate investment in Government Securities by individual investors was \nintroduced today.

Previous instructions  \nThis Master Circular consolidates and updates the previous instructions on the above subject \nas contained in the circulars listed in Annex 2 . \nD. Application  \nTo all Scheduled Commercial Banks, excluding Payments Banks and Regional Rural Banks.  \n \n    \n  \n2 \n \n \n 1 INTRODUCTION  \n An important criterion for judging the soundness of a banking institution is the size \nand character, not only of its assets portfolio but also, of its contingent liability \ncommitments such as guarantees, letters of credit, etc. As a part of business, banks \nissue guarantees on behalf of their customers for various purposes. The guarantees \nexecuted by banks comprise both performance guarantees and financial guarantees. \nThe guarantees are structured according to the terms of agreement, viz., security, \nmaturity and purpose. Banks should comply with the following guidelines in the \nconduct of their guarantee business.  \n2 GUIDELINES  \n2.1 General Guidelines  \n2.1.1  As regards the purpose of the guarantee, as a general rule, the banks should confine \nthemselves to the provision of financial guarantees and exercise due caution with \nregard to performance guarantee business.  \n2.1.2  As regards maturity, as a rule, banks should guarantee shorter maturities and leave \nlonger maturities to be guaranteed by other institutions.  \n2.1.3  No bank guarantee should normally have a maturity of more than 10 years. However, \nwhere banks extend long term loans for periods longer than 10 years for various \nprojects, it has been decided to allow banks to also issue guarantees for periods \nbeyond 10 years. While issuing such guarantees, banks are advised to take into \naccount the impact of very long duration guarantees on their Asset Liabi lity \nManagement. Further, banks may evolve a policy on issuance of guarantees beyond \n10 years as considered appropriate with the approval of their Board of Directors.  \n \n2.1.4  Banks should, in general,  refrain from issuing non-fund based facilities  to/on behalf of  \nconstituents who do not enjoy credit facilities with them. However, banks are permitted \nto grant non- fund based facilities , including partial credit enhancement1, to those \ncustomers, who do not avail any fund based facility from any bank in India. Provisi on \nof such facilities shall be in terms of a comprehensive Board approved policy for grant \nof non- fund based facility to such borrowers. The banks shall ensure that the borrower \nhas not availed any fund based facility from any bank operating in India. Howe ver, at \nthe time of granting non -fund based facilities, banks shall obtain declaration from the \ncustomer about the non - fund based credit facilities already enjoyed by them from \nother banks. Banks shall undertake the same level of credit appraisal as has been laid \ndown for fund based facilities. The instructions related to KYC / AML / CFT, \nsubmission of credit information to Credit Information Companies and othe r prudential \nnorms applicable to banks , including exposure norms, issued by RBI from time to time , \nshall be adhered to in respect of all such facility.  However, banks are prohibited from \nnegotiating unrestricted LCs of non- constituents. In cases where negotiation of bills \ndrawn under LC is restricted to a particular bank and the beneficiary of the LC is not \na constituent of that bank, the bank shall have the option to negotiate such LCs, \n                                                 \n1 As stipulated in paragraph 2.4.3. 1.(vi) below   \n  \n3 \n \n \n subject to the condition that the proceeds are remitted to the regular banker of the \nbeneficiary.  \n \n2.1.5 Further, BG /LC may be issued by scheduled commercial banks to  clients of co -\noperative banks  against counter guarantee of the co- operative bank  as permitted \nhitherto . In such cases, banks shall be guided by the provisions of paragraph 2.3. 8.2 \nof the Master Circular on Loans and Advances -Statutory and Other Restrictions  dated \nJuly 1, 2015  as amended from t ime to time.  Further,  in such cases banks must satisfy \nthemselves that the concerned co -operative banks have sound credit appraisal  and \nmonitoring systems as well as robust Know Your Customer (KYC) regime. Before \nissuing BG/LCs to specific constituents of co -operative banks, they must satisfy \nthemselves that KYC  check has been done properly in these cases.   \n2.1.6 The guarantee of parent companies may be obtained in the case of subsidiaries whose \nown financial condition is not considered satisfactory.  \n2.2 Guidelines relating to conduct of guarantee business  \n2.2.1  Norms for unsecured advances & guarantees  \n2.2.1.1 Until June 17, 2004, ban ks were required to limit their commitments by way of \nunsecured guarantees in such a manner that 20 percent of a bank\u2019s outstanding \nunsecured guarantees plus the total of its outstanding unsecured advances should \nnot exceed 15 percent of its total outstanding advances. In order to provide further \nflexibility to banks on their loan policies, the above limit on unsecured exposure of \nbanks was withdrawn and banks\u2019 Boards have been given the freedom to fix their own \npolicies on their unsecured exposures. \"Unsec ured exposure\" is defined as an \nexposure where the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank/ approved valuers  / Reserve Bank\u2019s inspecting officers, is not more than 10 per cent, \nab-initio, of the outstanding exposure. Exposure shall include all funded and non-\nfunded exposures (including underwriting and similar commitments). \u2018Security\u2019 will \nmean tangible security properly charged to the bank and will not include intangible \nsecurities like guarantees  (including State government guarantees) , letter  of comfort , \netc.  \n2.2.1.2   For determining the amount of unsecured advances for reflecting in schedule 9 of the \npublished balance sheet, the rights, licenses, authorisations, etc., charged to the \nbanks as collateral in respect of projects (including  infrastructure projects) financed \nby them, should not be reckoned as tangible security. Banks, may however, treat annuities under build- operate \u2013transfer (BOT) model in respect of road/highway \nprojects and toll collection rights where there are provisions  to compensate the project \nsponsor if a certain level of traffic is not achieved, as tangible securities, subject to the condition that banks\u2019 right to receive annuities and toll collection rights is legally \nenforceable and irrevocable.  \n2.2.1.3   All exempt ions allowed for computation of unsecured advances stand withdrawn.  \n \n  \n  \n4 \n \n \n 2.2.2  Precautions for issuing guarantees  \nBanks should adopt the following precautions while issuing guarantees on behalf of \ntheir customers.  \n(i) As a rule, banks should avoid giving unsecured guarantees in large amounts and \nfor medium and long- term periods. They should avoid undue concentration of such \nunsecured guarantee commitments to particular groups of customers and/or trades.  \n(ii) Unsecured guarantees on account of any individual constituent should be limited \nto a reasonable proportion of the bank\u2019s total unsecured guarantees. Guarantees on \nbehalf of an individual should also bear a reasonable proportion to the constituent\u2019s \nequity.  \n(iii) In exceptional cases, banks may give deferred  payment guarantees on an \nunsecured basis for modest amounts to first class customers who have entered into deferred payment arrangements in consonance with Government policy.  \n(iv) Guarantees executed on behalf of any individual constituent, or a group of  \nconstituents, should be subject to the prescribed exposure norms.  \n(v) It is essential to realise that guarantees contain inherent risks and that it would not \nbe in the bank\u2019s interest or in the public interest, generally, to encourage parties to \nover-extend their commitments and embark upon enterprises solely relying on the \neasy availability of guarantee facilities.  \n2.2.3  Precautions for averting frauds  \nWhile issuing guarantees on behalf of customers, the following safeguards should be \nobserved by banks:  \n \n(i) At the time of issuing financial guarantees, banks should be satisfied that the \ncustomer would be in a position to reimburse the bank in case the bank is required \nto make payment under the guarantee.  \n \n(ii) In the case of performance guarantee, banks should exercise due caution and \nhave sufficient experience with the customer to satisfy themselves that the customer has the necessary experience, capacity and means to perform the \nobligations under the contract, and is not likely to commit any default.   \n \n2.2.4  Ghosh Committee Recommendations  \nBanks should implement the following recommendations made by the High Level Committee constituted in October 1991 (Chaired by Shri A. Ghosh, the then Dy. \nGovernor of RBI):  \n(i) In order to prevent unaccounted issue of g uarantees, as well as fake guarantees, \nas suggested by IBA, bank guarantees should be issued in serially numbered security forms.  \n         \n  \n5 \n \n \n (ii) Banks should, while forwarding guarantees, caution the beneficiaries that they \nshould, in their own interest, ver ify the genuineness of the guarantee with the issuing \nbank.  \n2.2.5  Internal control systems \nBank guarantees issued for Rs.50,000/ - and above should be signed by two officials \njointly. A lower cut -off point, depending upon the size and category of branches, may \nbe prescribed by banks, where considered necessary. Such a system will reduce the \nscope for malpractices/ losses arising from the wrong perception/ judgement or lack \nof honesty/ integrity on the part of a single signatory. Banks should evolve suitable \nsystems and procedures, keeping in view the spirit of these instructions and allow \ndeviation from the two signatures discipline only in exceptional circumstances. The \nresponsibility for ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems and \nprocedures for preventing perpetration of frauds and malpractices by their officials \nwould, in such cases, rest on the top managements of the banks. In case, exceptions are made for affixing of only one signature on the instruments, banks should devise a \nsystem for s ubjecting such instruments to special scrutiny by the auditors or \ninspectors at the time of internal inspection of branches.  \n2.2.6  Guarantees on behalf of Banks' Directors  \n2.2.6. 1 Section 20 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 prohibits banks from granting  loans \nor advances to any of their directors or any firm or company in which any of their \ndirectors is a partner or guarantor. However, certain facilities which, inter alia, include \nissue of guarantees, are not regarded as 'loan and advances' within the meaning of \nSection 20 of the Act, ibid. In this regard, it is pertinent to note with particular reference \nto banks giving guarantees on behalf of their directors, that in the event of the principal debtor committing default in discharging his liability and t he bank being called upon to \nhonour its obligation under the guarantee, the relationship between the bank and the director could become one of creditor and debtor. Further, directors would also be \nable to evade the provisions of Section 20 by borrowing from a third party against the \nguarantee given by the bank. These types of transactions are likely to defeat the very \npurpose of Section 20  of the Act,  if banks do not take appropriate steps to ensure that \nthe liabilities there under do not devolve on them.  \n2.2.6.2  In view of the above, banks should, while extending non -fund based facilities such as \nguarantees, etc. on behalf of their directors and the companies/firms in which the \ndirector is interested, ensure that : \n(i) adequate and effective arrangements hav e been made to the satisfaction of the \nbank that the commitments would be met out of their own resources by the party on \nwhose behalf guarantee was issued and  \n(ii) the bank will not be called upon to grant any loan or advance to meet the liability, \nconseq uent upon the invocation of the guarantee.  \n In case, such contingencies arise as at (ii) above, the bank will be deemed to be a party to the violation of the provisions of Section 20 of the Banking Regulation Act, \n1949.   \n  \n6 \n \n \n 2.2.7  Bank Guarantee Scheme of Government of India2 \n2.2.7.1  The Bank Guarantee Scheme formulated by the Government of India for the issuance \nof bank guarantees in favour of Central Government Departments, in lieu of security \ndeposits, etc. by contractors, has been modified from time to time . Under the scheme, \nit is open to Government Departments to accept freely guarantees, etc. from all scheduled commercial banks.  \n2.2.7.2  Banks should adopt the Model Form of Bank Guarantee Bond given in Annex 1\n. The \nGovernment of India have advised all the Government departments/ Public Sector \nUndertakings, etc. to accept bank guarantees in the Model Bond and to ensure that \nalterations/additions to the clauses whenever considered necessary are not one- sided \nand are made in agreement with the guaranteeing bank. Banks should mention in the \nguarantee bonds and their correspondence with the various State Governments, the \nnames of the beneficiary departments and the purposes for which the guarantees are \nexecuted. This is necessary to facil itate prompt identification of the guarantees with \nthe concerned departments. In regard to the guarantees furnished by the banks in \nfavour of Government Departments in the name of the President of India, any \ncorrespondence thereon should be exchanged with the concerned ministries/ \ndepartments and not with the President of India.  \n2.2.8  Guarantees on behalf of Share and Stock Brokers/ Commodity Brokers \nBanks may issue guarantees on behalf of share and stock brokers in favour of stock \nexchanges in lieu of security deposit to the extent it is acceptable in the form of bank \nguarantee as laid down by stock exchanges. Banks may also issue guarantees in lieu \nof margin requirements as per stock exchange regulations. Banks have been advised \nthat they should obtain a m inimum margin of 50 percent while issuing such \nguarantees. A minimum cash margin of 25 per cent (within the above margin of 50 \nper cent) should be maintained in respect of such guarantees issued by banks. The \nabove minimum margin of 50 percent and minimum cash margin requirement of 25 \npercent (within the margin of 50 percent) will also apply to guarantees issued by banks \non behalf of commodity brokers in favour of the commodity exchanges, registered with \nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) , in lieu of margin requirements as per \nthe commodity exchange regulations. Banks should assess the requirement of each \napplicant and observe usual and necessary safeguards including the exposure \nceilings.   \n2.2.8.1 Irrevocable Payment Commitments \u2013  Financial Guarantees  \nBanks issuing Irrevocable Payment Commitment (IPCs) to various Stock Exchanges  \non behalf of Mutual Funds and FPIs are advised to adopt the following risk mitigation \nmeasures:  \n(i) Only those custodian banks would be permitted to issue IPCs who have a \nclause in the Agreement with their clients which gives them an inalienable right \nover the securities to be received as payout in any settlement. However, in \ncases where transactions are pre -funded i.e. there are clear INR funds in the \n                                                 \n2 The previous stipulations under paragraph 2.2.7.2 related to bank guarantees issued in favour of Directorate General of \nSupplies and Disposal (DGS&D) have been repealed as DGS&D has been wound up and ceased operations   \n  \n7 \n \n \n customer\u2019s account and, i n case of FX deals, the bank\u2019s nostro account has \nbeen credited before the issuance of the IPC by custodian banks, the \nrequirement of the clause of inalienable right over the security to be received \nas payout in the agreement with the clients will not be i nsisted upon.  \n \n(ii) As regards calculation of Capital Market Exposure ( CME ), the relevant \ninstructions are contained in para 2.3.5  of our Master Circular on \u2018Exposure \nNorms \u2019 dated July 1, 2015  as amended from time to time.   \n \n \n2.2.9  Guidelines relating to obtaining of personal guarantees of promoters, directors,  \nother managerial personnel , and shareholders of borrowing concerns  \nBanks should take personal guarantees of promoters , directors , other managerial \npersonnel or major shareholders for the credit facilities granted to corporates, public \nor private, only when absolutely warranted after a careful examination of the \ncircumstances of the case and not  as a matter of  course. In order to identify the \ncircumstances under which the guarantee may or may not be considered necessary, \nbanks should be guided by the following broad considerations:  \nA.       Where guarantees need not be considered necessary  \n(i) Ordinarily, in the case of public limited companies, when the lending institutions are \nsatisfied about the management, its stake in the concern, economic viability of the \nproposal and the financial position and capacity for cash generation, no personal \nguarantee need be insisted upon. In fact, in the case of widely owned public limited \ncompanies, which may be rated as first class and satisfying the above conditions, \nguarantees may not be necessary even if the advances are unsecured. Also, in the \ncase of companies, whether private or public, which are under professional \nmanagement, guarantees may not be insisted upon from persons who are connected \nwith the management solely by virtue of their professional/technical qualifications and \nnot consequent upon any significant shareholding in t he company concerned.  \n(ii) Where the lending institutions are not so convinced about the aspects of loan \nproposals mentioned above, they should seek to stipulate conditions to make the \nproposals acceptable without such guarantees. In some cases, more strin gent forms \nof financial discipline like restrictions on distribution of dividends, further expansion, aggregate borrowings, creation of further charge on assets and stipulation of \nmaintenance of minimum net working capital may be necessary. Also, the parit y \nbetween owned funds and capital investment and the overall debt -equity ratio may \nhave to be taken into account.  \nB.       Where guarantees may be considered helpful  \n(i) Personal guarantees may be helpful in respect of companies, whether private or \npublic,  where shares are held closely by a person or connected persons or a group \n(not being professionals or Government), irrespective of other factors, such as \nfinancial condition, security available, etc. The exception being in respect of \ncompanies where, by c ourt or statutory order, the management of the company is  \n  \n8 \n \n \n vested in a person or persons, whether called directors or by any other name, who \nare not required to be elected by the shareholders. Where personal guarantee is \nconsidered necessary, the guarantee should preferably be that of the principal \nmembers of the group holding shares in the borrowing company rather than that of \nthe director/managerial personnel functioning as director or in any managerial \ncapacity.  \n(ii) Even if a company is not closely held,  there may be justification for a personal \nguarantee of directors to ensure continuity of management. Thus, a lending institution could make a loan to a company whose management is considered good. \nSubsequently, a different group could acquire control of t he company, which could \nlead the lending institution to have well -founded fears that the management has \nchanged for the worse and that the funds lent to the company are in jeopardy. One \nway by which lending institutions could protect themselves in such cir cumstances is \nto obtain guarantees of the directors and thus ensure either the continuity of the \nmanagement or that the changes in management take place with their knowledge. \nEven where personal guarantees are waived, it may be necessary to obtain an \nunder taking from the borrowing company that no change in the management would \nbe made without the consent of the lending institution. Similarly, during the formative \nstages of a company, it may be in the interest of the company, as well as the lending \ninstituti on, to obtain guarantees to ensure continuity of management.  \n(iii) Personal guarantees may be helpful with regard to public limited companies other \nthan those which may be rated as first class, where the advance is on an unsecured \nbasis.  \n(iv) There may be public limited companies, whose financial position and/or capacity \nfor cash generation is not satisfactory even though the relevant advances are secured. In such cases, personal guarantees are useful.  \n(v) Cases where there is likely to be considerable delay in the creation of a charge on \nassets, guarantee may be taken, where deemed necessary, to cover the interim \nperiod between the disbursement of loan and the creation of the charge on assets.  \n(vi) Personal guarantees are relevant where the balance sheet or  financial statement \nof a company discloses interlocking of funds between the company and other concerns owned or managed by a group.  \n \nC.        Worth of the guarantors, payment of guarantee commission, etc  \nWhere personal guarantees of directors are warranted, they should bear reasonable \nproportion to the estimated worth of the person. The system of obtaining guarantees \nshould not be used by the directors and other managerial personnel as a source of \nincome from the company. Banks should obtain an undertaki ng from the borrowing \ncompany as well as the guarantors that no consideration whether by way of \ncommission, brokerage fees or any other form, would be paid by the former or \nreceived by the latter, directly or indirectly. This requirement should be incorpor ated \nin the bank's terms and conditions for sanctioning of credit limits. During the periodic \ninspections, the bank's inspectors should verify that this stipulation has been complied  \n  \n9 \n \n \n with. There may, however, be exceptional cases where payment of remunerat ion may \nbe permitted e.g. where assisted concerns are not doing well and the existing \nguarantors are no longer connected with the management but continuance of their \nguarantees is considered essential because the new management's guarantee is \neither not av ailable or is found inadequate.  \n \nD.        Personal guarantees in the case of stressed units  \nAs the personal guarantees of promoters/ directors generally instill greater \naccountability and responsibility on their part and prompt the managements to conduct \nthe running of the assisted units on sound and healthy lines and to ensure financial \ndiscipline, banks, may in their discretion, at the time of renewal obtain guarantees \nfrom directors (excluding the nominee directors) and other managerial personnel in \ntheir individual capacities  if the exposure exhibits signs of stress as per the \nassessment of the bank . In case, for any reasons, a guarantee is not considered \nexpedient by the bank at the time of sanctioning the advance, an undertaking should \nbe obtained fro m the individual directors and a covenant should invariably be \nincorporated in the loan agreement that in case the borrowing unit show s cash losses \nor adverse current ratio or diversion of fund, the directors would be under an obligation to execute guarant ees in their individual capacities, if required by the bank. Banks \nmay also obtain guarantees at their discretion from the parent/holding company when credit facilities are extended to borrowing units in the same Group.  \n \n2.2.10  Guarantees of State Government  \nThe guidelines laid down in paragraph 2.2.9 above, for taking personal guarantees of \ndirectors and other managerial personnel, should also be followed in respect of \nproposal of State Government undertakings/projects and guarantees may not be \ninsisted upon unless absolutely warranted. In other words, banks could obtain \nguarantees of State Governments on merits and only in circumstances absolutely \nnecessary after thorough examination of the circumstances of each case, and not as \nmatter of course.  \n \n2.3 Othe r stipulations \u2013 Issuing bid bond s and performance guarantees for export   \nWith a view to boost exports, banks should adopt a flexible approach in the matter of \nobtaining cover and earmarking of assets/ credit limits, drawing power, while issuing \nbid bonds  and performance guarantees for export purposes. Banks may, however, \nsafeguard their interests by obtaining coverage from Export Credit Guarantee \nCorporation of India Ltd. ( ECGC) , wherever considered necessary.  Banks may \nconsider sanctioning separate limit s for issue of bid bonds. Within the limits so \nsanctioned, bid bonds against individual contracts may be issued, subject to usual considerations.  \n  \n  \n10 \n \n \n 2.3.1 Unconditional Guarantees i n favour of Overseas Employers/ Importers on behalf \nof Indian Exporters  \n     2.3.1.1 While agreeing to give unconditional guarantee in favour of overseas \nemployers/importers on behalf of Indian Exporters, banks should obtain an \nundertaking from the exporter to the effect that when the guarantee is invoked, the \nbank would be entitled to make payment, notwithstanding any dispute between the \nexporter and the importer. Although, such an undertaking may not prevent the \nexporter from approaching the Court for an injunction order, it might weigh with the \nCourt in taking a view whether injunction order should be issued.  \n2.3.1.2 Banks s hould, while issuing guarantees , keep the above points in view and \nincorporate suitable clauses in the agreement, in consultation with their legal advisers. \nThis is considered desirable as non- honouring of guar antees on invocation might \nprompt overseas banks not to accept guarantees of Indian banks, thus hampering the \ncountry's export promotion effort.  \n2.3.2 Certain precautions in case of Project Exports  \n2.3.2.1 As per the provisions of the revised Memorandum o f Instructions on Project & Service \nExports issued vide circular on Export of Goods and Services \u2013  Project Exports dated \nJuly 22, 2014 , AD banks/Exim Bank have been authori zed to consider according post-\naward approvals for high value overseas project exports. However, the responsibility \nof project appraisal and that of monitoring the project lies solely on the lending bank s. \n2.3.2.2 Banks  should examine the project proposals  thoroughly with regard to the capacity of \nthe contractor/ sub- contractors, protective clauses in the contracts, adequacy of \nsecurity, credit ratings of the overseas sub- contractors, if any, etc.  \n2.3.2.3 Therefore, the need for a careful assessment of financial and technical demands \ninvolved in the proposals vis -\u00e0-vis the capability of the contractors (including sub-\ncontractors) as well as the overseas employers can hardly be under -rated to the \nfinancing of any domestic projects. In fact, the export project s should be given more \nattention, in view of their high values and the possibilities of foreign exchange losses \nin case of failure, apart from damage to the image of Indian entrepreneurs.  \n2.3.2.4 While bid bonds and performance guarantees cannot be avoided, it is to be \nconsidered whether guarantees should be given by the banks in all cases of overseas borrowings for financing overseas projects. Such guarantees should not be executed \nas a matter of course, merely because of the participation of Exim Bank and  \navailability of counter -guarantee of ECGC. Appropriate arrangements should also be \nmade for post -award follow -up and monitoring of the contracts.  \n2.3.3  Guarantees for Export Advance  \n \n2.3.3.1 Guarantees are permitted in respect of debt or other liability incurred by an exporter \non account of exports from India.  It is therefore intended to facilitate execution of \nexport contracts by an exporter and not for other purposes. In terms of extant \ninstructions banks have also been advised that guarantees contain inherent risks, and \nthat it would not be in the banks' interest or in the public interest generally to \nencourage parties to over -extend their commitments and embark upon enterprises  \n  \n11 \n \n \n solely relying on the easy availability of guarantee facilities. Banks should, therefore, \nbe careful while extending guarantees against export advances so as to ensure that \nno violation of FEMA regulations takes place and banks  are not exposed to various \nrisks the export advances received by the exporters are in compliance with the \nregulations/ directions issued under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 .  It \nwill be important for the banks to carry out due diligence and verify the track record of \nsuch exporters to assess their ability to execute such export orders.  \n 2.3.3. 2 Further, banks should also ensure that the export advances received by the exporters \nare in compliance with the regulations/ directions issued under the Foreign Exchange \nManagement Act, 1999.  \n \n2.3.3.3 It is reiterated that export performance guarantees, where permitted to be issued, \nshall strictly be in the nature of performance guarantee and shall not contain any clauses which may in effect allow such performance guarantees to be utilized as \nfinancial guarantees/Standby Letters of Credits  \n2.3.4 Review of  banks\u2019 procedures  \nBanks may periodically review the position regarding delegation of powers and their \nprocedures, and take such action as may be necessary with a view to expediting \ndecision on export proposals. They may also consider designating a specif ied branch, \nequipped with adequately qualified and trained staff, in each important centre to deal \nexpeditiously with all export credit proposals at the centre.  \n2.3.5 Overseas Investment \u2013 Guarantee on behalf of Wholly Owned Subsidiaries \n(WOSs )/Joint Ventu res (JVs) abroad  \n \nAn Indian party may have financial commitment to its overseas JV / WOS to the limit, as \nprescribed by the Reserve bank from time to time, of the net worth of the Indian party as \non the date of the last audited balance sheet. The financial  commitment may be in the \nform of  \n(i)  capital contribution and loan to the JV / WOS;  \n(ii)  corporate guarantee (only 50 percent value in case of performance guarantee) and /   \n       or bank guarantee (which is backed by a counter guarantee / collateral by the   \n       Indian party) on behalf of the JV / WOS and  \n(iii)  charge on immovable / movable property and other financial assets  of the   \n       Indian party (including group company) on behalf of JV / WOS.  \n \nThe above measures were intended to assist I ndian companies in their overseas \nbusiness. However, it has been observed that banks are extending non- fund based credit \nfacilities like guarantees / stand- by letter of credits / letter of comforts etc. on behalf of \nJoint Ventures  (JV)/ Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WoS)  / Wholly Owned Step Down \nSubsidiaries (WoSDS ) for purposes which are not connected with their business, rather, \nin certain cases,  these facilities are  used to avail foreign currency loans for repayment of \nRupee loans.   \n  \n12 \n \n \n                      It i s therefore clarified that banks, including overseas branches / subsidiaries of Indian \nbanks, shall not issue standby letters of credit / guarantees / letter of comforts etc. on \nbehalf of overseas JV / WOS / WoSDS  of Indian companies for the purpose of rai sing \nloans / advances of any kind from other entities except in connection with the ordinary course of overseas business. Further while extending fund / non- fund based credit \nfacilities to overseas JV / WOS / WoSDS of Indian companies in connection with their \nbusiness, either through branches in India or through branches / subsidiaries abroad, \nbanks should ensure effective monitoring of the end use of such facilities and its \nconformity with the business needs of such entities.  Banks  may also ensure compliance \nwith A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 20 dated March 13, 2018\n regarding \u2018Discontinuance \nof Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) and Letters of Comfort (LoCs) for Trade Credits\u2019.  \n \n \n2.4 Restrictions on guarantees for placement of funds with NBFCs or other non -bank \nentities  \n2.4.1    Banks should not execute guarantees  for enabling placement of funds with NBFCs or \nother non-banking entities directly or indirectly , including inter -company deposits/ \nloans . This stipulation will apply to all sources of funds raised by such entities , e.g. \ndeposits/ loans received from trusts and other institutions.  \n2.4.2   Transactions of the following types are in the nature of guarantees executed by ban ks \nin respect of funds made available by one non- banking entity to another non- banking \nentity and banks should therefore, desist from such practices:  \n(i) A seller drew bills, normally of 120 to 180 days usance, on the buyer which were \naccepted by the buyer and co- accepted by his banker. The bills were discounted by \nthe seller with the accommodating company, which retained the bills till the due date. \nThe bank which gave co- acceptance invariably earmarked funds for the liability under \nthe bills against the draw ing power in respect of stocks held in the cash credit account \nof its client, the buyer, or  \n \n(ii) The accommodating company kept deposits for a specific period with the bank's \nborrowers under a guarantee executed by the bank. In such a case also, the bank \nearma rked the amount against drawing power available in the cash credit account.  \n2.4.3.1 Banks may issue guarantees favouring other banks/ FIs/ other lending agencies for \nthe loans extended by the latter, subject to strict compliance with the following conditions.  \n(i)  The Board of Directors should reckon the integrity/ robustness of the bank\u2019s risk \nmanagement systems and, accordingly, put in place a well -laid out policy in this \nregard.  \n \n  \n  \n13 \n \n \n The Board approved policy should, among others, address the following iss ues: \n\u2022 Prudential limits, linked to bank\u2019s Tier I capital, up to which guarantees \nfavouring other banks/FIs/other lending agencies may be issued  \n\u2022 Nature and extent of security and margins  \n\u2022 Delegation of powers  \n\u2022 Reporting system  \n\u2022 Periodical reviews  \n(ii) The guar antee shall be extended only in respect of borrower constituents and to \nenable them to avail of additional credit facility from other banks/FIs/lending \nagencies.  \n(iii)  The guaranteeing bank should assume a funded exposure of at least 10% of the \nexposure g uaranteed.  \n(iv)  Banks should not extend guarantees or letters of comfort in favour of overseas \nlenders including those assignable to overseas lenders. However, AD banks may \nalso be guided by the provisions contained in Notification No. FEMA 8/2000- RB \ndated May 3, 2000  and subsequent amendments thereof .  \n(v)  The guarantee issued by the bank will be an exposure on the borrowing entity on whose behalf the guarantee has been issued and will attract appropriate risk \nweight, as per the extant guidelines.  \n(vi) Of late, certain banks have been issuing guarantees on behalf of corporate entities \nin respect of non -convertible debentures issued by such entities. It is clarified that \nthe ex tant instructions apply only to loans and not to bonds or debt instruments. \nGuarantees by the banking system for a corporate bond or any debt instrument not only have significant systemic implications but also impede the development \nof a genuine corporate debt market. Banks are advised to strictly comply with the \nextant regulations and in particular, not to provide guarantees for issuance of \nbonds or debt instruments of any kind.  However, banks are permitted to provide \npartial credit enhancement (PCE) to bonds issued by corporates /special purpose vehicles (SPVs), NBFC -ND-SIs and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) subject \nto conditions stipulated in \ncircular DBR.BP.BC.No.40/21. 04.142/2015- 16 dated \nSeptember 24, 2015  on Partial Credit Enhancement to Corporate Bonds and \nother associated circulars issued subsequently on the subject. The PCE shall be \nprovided only in the form of a non -funded irrevocable contingent line of credit.  \n2.4.3.2  Lending banks  \nBanks extending credit facilities against the guarantees issued by other banks/FIs \nshould ensure strict compliance with the following conditions:  \n(i)  The exposure assumed by the bank against the guarantee of another bank/FI will \nbe deemed as an exposure on the guaranteeing bank/FI and will attract \nappropriate risk weight as per the extant guidelines.   \n  \n14 \n \n \n (ii)  Exposures assumed by way of credit facilities extended against the guarantees \nissued by other banks /FI should be reckoned within t he inter bank exposure limits \nprescribed by the Board of Directors. Since the exposure assumed by the bank against the guarantee of another bank/FI will be for a fairly longer term than those \nassumed on account of inter -bank dealings in the money market, f oreign \nexchange market and securities market, the Board of Directors should fix an \nappropriate sub- limit for the longer term exposures, since these exposures attract \ngreater risk.  \n(iii)  Banks should monitor the exposure assumed on the guaranteeing bank/ F I, on a \ncontinuous basis and ensure strict compliance with the prudential limits/ sub limits \nprescribed by their Board s and the prudential single borrower limits prescribed by \nRBI for banks/ FIs. \n 2.4.4  Exceptions  \n2.4.4.1 In regard to resolution of stressed  units, in exceptional cases, where banks are unable \nto participate in rehabilitation packages on account of temporary liquidity constraints, \nthe concerned banks could provide guarantees in favour of the banks which take up \ntheir additional share. Such guarantees will remain extant until such time that the \nbanks providing additional finance against guarantees are re- compensated.  \n2.4.4.2 In cases of Sellers Line of Credit Scheme (since renamed as Direct  Discounting \nScheme) operated by IDBI Bank Ltd.3 and al l India financial institutions like SIDBI, \nPFC, etc for sale of machinery, the primary credit is provided by the seller\u2019s bank to \nthe seller through bills drawn on the buyer and the seller\u2019s bank has no access to the \nsecurity covered by the transaction whi ch remains with the buyer. As such, buyer\u2019s \nbanks are permitted to extend guarantee/ co- acceptance facility for the bills drawn \nunder seller\u2019s line of credit.  \n2.4.4.3 Similarly, guarantees can be issued in favour of HUDCO/ State Housing Boards and \nsimilar bodies/ organisations for the loans granted by them to private borrowers who \nare unable to offer clear and marketable title to property, provided banks are otherwise \nsatisfied with the capacity of the borrowers to  adequately service such loans.  \n2.4.4.4 Banks may i ssue guarantees in favour of various Development Agencies/Boards, like \nIndian Renewable Energy Development Agency, National Horticulture Board, etc. for obtaining soft loans and/or other forms of development assistance from such \nAgencies/Boards wit h the objective of improving efficiency, productivity, etc., subject \nto the following conditions:  \n(i) Banks should satisfy themselves, on the basis of credit appraisal, regarding the \ntechnical feasibility, financial viability and bankability of individual proj ects and/or \nloan proposals i.e. the standard of such appraisal should be the same, as is \ndone in the case of a loan proposal seeking sanction of term finance/loan.  \n(ii) Banks should conform to the prudential exposure norms prescribed from time to time for an individual borrower/group of borrowers.  \n(iii) Banks should suitably secure themselves before extending such guarantees.  \n                                                 \n3 The scheme which was being operated by the erstwhile IDBI is being continued by IDBI Bank Ltd.   \n  \n15 \n \n \n  \n2.4.5  Infrastructure projects  \nKeeping in view the special features of lending to infrastructure projects viz., the high \ndegree of appraisal ski lls on the part of lenders and availability of resources of a \nmaturity matching with the project period, banks have been given discretion in the matter of issuance of guarantees favouring other lending agencies, in respect of \ninfrastructure projects alone,  subject to the following conditions:  \n(i) The bank issuing the guarantee takes a funded share in the project at least to the \nextent of 5 percent of the project cost and undertakes normal credit appraisal, \nmonitoring and follow -up of the project.  \n(ii) The g uarantor bank has a satisfactory record in compliance with the prudential \nregulations, such as, capital adequacy, credit exposure, norms relating to income recognition, asset classification and provisioning, etc.  \n2.5. Payment of invoked guarantees  \n2.5.1   Where guarantees are invoked, payment should be made to the beneficiaries without \ndelay and demur. An appropriate procedure for ensuring such immediate honouring \nof guarantees should be laid down so that there is no delay on the pretext that legal \nadvice or  approval of higher authorities is being obtained.  \n2.5.2   Delays on the part of banks in honouring the guarantees when invoked tend to erode \nthe value of the bank guarantees, the sanctity of the scheme of guarantees and image \nof banks. It also provides an opportunity to the parties to take recourse to courts and \nobtain injunction orders. In the case of guarantees in favour of Government \ndepartments, this not only delays the revenue collection efforts but also gives an \nerroneous impression that banks are ac tively in collusion with the parties, which \ntarnishes  the image of the banking system.  \n2.5.3  There should be an effective system to ensure that the persons on whose behalf the \nguarantees are issued will be in a position to perform their obligations in the case of performance guarantees and honour their commitments out of their own resources, \nas and when needed, in the case of financial guarantees.  \n2.5.4   The top management of the banks should bestow their personal attention to the need \nto put in place a proper mechanism for making payments in respect of invoked \nguarantees promptly, so that no room is given for such complaints. When complaints \nare made, particularly by the Government departments for not honouring the \nguarantees issued, the top management of t he bank, including its Chief Executive \nOfficer, should personally look into such complaints.  \n2.5.5  In this regard, the Delhi High Court has made adverse remarks against certain banks \nin not promptly honouring the commitment of guarantees when invoked. It has been \nobserved that a  bank guarantee is a contract between the beneficiary and the bank. \nWhen the beneficiary invokes the bank guarantee and a letter invoking the same is \nsent in terms of the bank guarantee, it is obligatory on the bank to make payment t o \nthe beneficiary.   \n  \n16 \n \n \n 2.5.6   The Supreme Court had observed [U.P. Co- operative Federation Private Ltd. versus \nSingh Consultants and Engineers Private Ltd. (1988 IC SSC 174)] that the \ncommitments of the banks must be honoured, free from interference by the cou rts. \nThe relevant extract from the judgement of the Supreme Court in a case is as under:  \n'We are, therefore, of the opinion that the correct position of law is that commitment \nof banks must be honoured free from interference by the courts and it is only i n \nexceptional cases, that is, to say, in case of fraud or any case where irretrievable \ninjustice would be done if bank guarantee is allowed to be encashed, the court should \ninterfere'.  \n2.5.7   In order to avoid such situations, it is absolutely essential for banks to appraise the \nproposals for guarantees with the same diligence, as in the case of fund based limits, and obtain adequate cover by way of margin so as to prevent the constituents to \ndevelop a tendency of defaulting in payments when invoked guarant ees are honoured \nby the banks.  \n2.5.8   (i) Banks are required to ensure that the guarantees issued by them are honoured \nwithout delay and hes itation when they are invoked in accordance with the terms and \nconditions of the guarantee deed, unless there is a C ourt order restraining the banks.  \n (ii) Any decision not to honour the obligation under the guarantee invoked may be \ntaken after careful consideration, at a fairly senior level, and only in the circumstances \nwhere the bank is satisfied that any such payment to the beneficiary would not be \ndeemed a rightful payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the \nguarantee under the Indian Contract Act , 1872.  \n (iii) The Chief Executive Officers of banks should assume personal responsibility for \nsuch complaints received from Government departments. Sufficient powers should be \ndelegated to the line functionaries so that delay on account of reference to higher \nauthorities for payment under the guarantee does not occur.  \n (iv) For any non -payment of guarantee in time, staff accountability should be fixed and \nstern disciplinary action including award of major penalty such as dismissal, should \nbe taken against the delinquent officials at all levels.  \n (v) Where banks have executed bank guarantees in favour of Custom s and Central \nExcise authorities to cover differential duty amounts in connection with interim orders \nissued by High Courts, the guarantee amount should be released immediately when \nthey are invoked on vacation of the stay orders by Courts. Banks should not hold back \nthe amount on the pretext that it would affect their liquidity position.  \n2.5.9   There have also been complaints by Ministry of Finance that some of the departments \nsuch as Department of Revenue, Government of India are finding it difficult to execute \njudgements delivered by various Courts in their favour as banks do not honour their \nguarantees, unless certified copies of the Court judgements are made available to \nthem. In this regard, the banks may follow the following procedure:  \n(i) Where the b ank is a party to the proceedings initiated by Government for \nenforcement of the bank guarantee and the case is decided in favour of the \nGovernment by the Court, banks should not insist on production of certified copy of  \n  \n17 \n \n \n the judgement, as the judgement/ or der is pronounced in open Court in presence of \nthe parties/ their counsels and the judgement is known to the bank  and a copy of the \njudgement is available on websites of the Courts . \n(ii) In case the bank is not a party to the proceedings, a signed copy of the minutes of \nthe order certified by the Registrar/ Deputy or Assistant Registrar of the High Court or \nthe ordinary copy of the judgement/ order of the High Court, duly attested to be true \ncopy by Government Counsel, should be sufficient for honouring the obligation under \nguarantee, unless the guarantor bank decides to file any appeal against the order of the High Court.  \n(iii) Banks should honour the guarantees issued by them as and when they are \ninvoked in accordance with the terms and conditions of the g uarantee deeds. In case \nof any disputes, such honouring can be done under protest, if necessary, and the matters of dispute pursued separately.  \n(iv) The Government, on their part, have advised the various Government \ndepartments, etc. that the invocation o f guarantees should be done after careful \nconsideration at a senior -level that a default has occurred in accordance with the \nterms and conditions of the guarantees and as provided in the guarantee deed.  \n(v) Non-compliance of the instructions in regard to honouring commitments under \ninvoked guarantees will be viewed by Reserve Bank very seriously and Reserve Bank \nwill be constrained to take dete rrent action against the banks.  \n2.6 Co-acceptance of bills  \n2.6.1  General  \nReserve Bank has observed that some banks  co-accept bills of their customers and \nalso discount bills co- accepted by other banks in a casual manner. These bills \nsubsequently turn out to be accommodation bills drawn by groups of sister concerns \non each other where no genuine trade transaction takes  place. Banks, while \ndiscounting such bills, appear to ignore this important aspect presumably because of the co- acceptance given by other banks. The bills, on maturity, are not honoured by \nthe drawees and the banks which co -accept the bills have to make payment of these \nbills, and they find it difficult to recover the amount from the drawers/ drawees of bills. Banks also discount bills for sizeable amounts, which are co -accepted by certain \nUrban Co- operative Banks. On maturity, the bills are not honoured a nd the co-\noperative banks, which co- accept the bills, also find it difficult to make the payment. \nThe financial position and capacity of the co -accepting bank to honour the bills, in the \nevent of need, is not being looked into. Cases have also been observed where the \nparticulars regarding co- acceptance of bills are not recorded in the bank's books, with \nthe result that the same cannot be verified during inspections, and the Head Office \nbecomes aware of the co- acceptance only when a claim is received from the \ndiscounting bank.  \n \n  \n  \n18 \n \n \n  \n2.6.2  Safeguards  \nIn the light of the above, banks should keep in view the following safeguards:  \n          (i) While sanctioning co -acceptance limits to their customers, the need therefor e \nshould be ascertained, and such limits should be  extended only to those customers \nwho enjoy other limits with the bank.  \n \n            (ii) Only genuine trade bills should be co- accepted and the banks should ensure that \nthe goods covered by bills co- accepted are actually received in the stock accounts of \nthe borrowers.  \n \n            (iii) The valuation of the goods as mentioned in the accompanying invoice should be \nverified to see that there is no over -valuation of stocks.  \n \n            (iv) The banks should not extend their co -acceptance to house bills/ accommodation \nbills drawn by group concerns on one another.  \n \n            (v) The banks discounting such bills, co- accepted by other banks, should also ensure \nthat the bills are not accommodation bills and that the co -accepting bank has the \ncapacity to redeem the obligation in case of need.  \n \n            (vi) Bank -wise limits should be fixed, taking into consideration the size of each bank \nfor discounting bills co -accepted by other banks, and the relative powers of the officials \nof the other banks should be got registered with the discounting banks.  \n \n            (vii) Care should be taken to see that the co- acceptance liability of any bank is not \ndisproportionate to its known resources position.  \n \n            (viii) A system of obtaining periodical confirmation of  the liability of co -accepting banks \nin regard to the outstanding bills should be introduced.  \n \n            (ix) Proper records of the bills co- accepted for each customer should be maintained, \nso that the commitments for each customer and the total commitments at a branch \ncan be readily ascertained, and these should be scrutinised by Internal Inspectors and \ncommented upon in their reports.  \n             (x) It is also desirable for the discounting bank to advise the Head Office/ Controlling \nOffice of the bank , which has co -accepted the bills, whenever such transactions \nappear to be disproportionate or large.  \n \n(xi) Proper periodical returns may be prescribed so that the Branch Managers report \nsuch co -acceptance commitments entered into by them to the Controlling Offices.  \n \n(xii) Such returns should also reveal the position of bills that have become overdue, \nand which the bank had to meet under the co -acceptance obligation. This will enable \nthe Controlling Offices to monitor such co- acceptances furnished by the branches and \ntake suitable action in time, in difficult cases.  \n  \n  \n19 \n \n \n (xiii) Co-acceptances in respect of bills for Rs.10,000/ - and above should be signed \nby two officials jointly, deviation being allowed only in exceptional cases, e.g. non-\navailability of two of ficials at a branch.  \n \n(xiv) Before discounting/ purchasing bills co- accepted by other banks for Rs. 2 lakh \nand above from a single party, the bank should obtain written confirmation of the \nconcerned Controlling (Regional/ Divisional/ Zonal) Office of the accepting bank and \na record of the same should be kept.  \n \n(xv) When the value of the total bills discounted/ purchased (which have been co-\naccepted by other banks) exceeds Rs. 20 lakh for a single borrower/ group of \nborrowers, prior approval of the Head Offi ce of the co- accepting bank must be \nobtained by the discounting bank in writing.  \n2.6.2.1 In addition to the above safeguards to be observed by banks in co -accepting the bills, \nit must be noted that the banks are precluded from co- accepting bills drawn under \nBuyers Line of Credit Schemes introduced by IDBI Bank Ltd. and all India financial institutions like SIDBI, Power Finance Corporation Ltd. (PFC), etc. Similarly, banks \nshould not co- accept bills drawn by NBFCs. In addition, banks are advised not to \nextend co- acceptance on behalf of their buyers/constituents under the SIDBI Scheme.  \n2.6.2.2  However, banks may co- accept bills drawn under the Sellers Line of Credit Schemes \n(since renamed as Direct Discounting Scheme) operated by IDBI Bank Ltd.\n4 and all \nIndia financial institutions for Bill Discounting operated by IDBI Bank Ltd.5 and all India \nfinancial institutions like SIDBI, PFC, etc. without any limit, subject to the buyer\u2019s  \ncapability to pay, and compliance with the exposure norms prescribed by the bank for \nindividual/ group borrowers.  \n2.6.2.3  There have been instances where branches of banks open L/Cs on behalf of their \nconstituents and also co- accept the bills drawn under such L/Cs. Legally, if a bank co -\naccepts a bill drawn under its own L/C, the bill so co -accepted becomes an \nindependent document. The special rules applicable to commercial credits do not \napply to such a bill and the bill is exclusively governed by the law relating to Bills of \nExchange, i.e. the Negotiable Instruments Act. The negotiati ng bank of such a bill is \nnot under any obligation to check the particulars of the bill with reference to the terms of the L/C. This practice is, therefore, superfluous and defeats the purpose of issuing the L/C. The discounting banks should first ascertai n from the co- accepting banks, the \nreason for such co- acceptance of bills drawn under their own L/C and only after \nsatisfying themselves of genuineness of such transactions, they may consider \ndiscounting such bills.  \n2.6.2.4  It should be ensured that the br anch officials strictly adhere to the above referred \ninstructions at the time of co -acceptance of bills. It would be advisable to determine \nclear accountability in this respect and officials found to be not complying with the \ninstructions must be dealt wit h sternly.  \n \n                                                 \n4 The scheme which was being operated by the erstwhile IDBI is being continued by IDBI Bank Ltd.  \n5 The Scheme which was being operated by the erstwhile IDBI is being continued by IDBI Bank Ltd.   \n  \n20 \n \n \n  \n2.7  Precautions to be taken in the case of Letter of Credit  \n2.7.1  In the case of LCs for import of goods, banks should be very vigilant while making \npayment to the overseas suppliers on the basis of shipping documents. They should \nexercise precaution and care in comparing the clients. The payments should be \nreleased to the foreign parties only after ensuing that the documents are strictly in \nconformity with the terms of the LCs. There have been many irregularities in the \nconduct of LC business,  such as the LC transactions not being recorded in the books \nof the branch by officials issuing them, the amount of LCs being much in excess of \nthe powers vested in the officials, fraudulent issue of LCs involving a \nconspiracy/collusion between the benefic iary and the constituent. In such cases, the \nbanks should take action against the concerned officials as well as the constituent on whose behalf the LCs were opened and the beneficiary of LCs, if a criminal conspiracy \nis involved.  \n2.7.2  Settlement of claim s under Letter of Credits  \nIn case the bills drawn under LCs are not honoured, it would adversely affect the \ncharacter of LCs and the relative bills as an accepted means of payment. This could \nalso affect the credibility of the entire payment mechanism through banks and affect \nthe image of the banks. Banks should, therefore, honour their commitments under \nLCs and make payments promptly.  \n2.8     Compliance to the regulations of Foreign Exchange Management Act, 2000 \nBanks should note to comply with the direct ions, regulations issued under  Foreign \nExchange Management (Guarantee) Regulations, 2000 as amended from time to \ntime.  \n2.9    Compliance to the Prudential Norms  \nBanks shall comply with all the related prudential norms issued by RBI as amended \nfrom time to time. \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n21 \n \n \n ANNEX 1  \n \nModel Form of Bank Guarantee Bond  \n[paragraph 2.2.7.2]  \nGUARANTEE BOND  \n1.

Guarantees \n \n1.1 Issue of Guarantees  \n \n1.1.1  Broad Guidelines \n \nIn view of the risks involved in the business of issuance of guarantees,  \nthe Primary  (Urban)  Co-operative Banks  (UCBs)  should extend  \nguarantees within restricted limits so that their financial position is not  \nimpaired.  The banks  should follow certain broad guidelines in respect   of \ntheir guarantee business  as indicated in the following  paragraphs.  \n \n1.1.2  Purpose  \n \n(i) As a general rule, banks may  provide only financial guarantees  and \nnot performance guarantees.  \n \n(ii) However, scheduled banks may issue performance guarantees on \nbehalf of their constituents subject to exercising due caution in the  \nmatter.  \n \n1.1.3  Maturity  \n \nIt would be desirable for U CBs to conf ine their guarantees to relatively  \nshort -term maturities. Guarantees  should  not be issued for periods  \nexceeding ten years in any  case.  \n \n1.1.4  Volume \n \nThe total volume of guarantee obligations outstanding at any time may  \nnot exceed 10 per cent of the total owned resources  of the bank  \ncomprising paid up capital, reserves and deposits. Within the overall  \nceiling, proportion of unsecured guarantees outstanding at any time may \nbe limited to an amount equivalent to 25% of the owned funds  (paid up \ncapital + reserves) of  the bank or 25% of the total amount of  guarantees, \nwhichever  is less.  \n \n1.1.5  Secured Guarantees  \n \nBanks  should preferably  issue  secured guarantees.  A secured  \nguarantee means  a guarantee made on the security  of assets  (including \ncash margin), the market value of which will not at any time  be less than \nthe amount  of the contingent  liability  on the guarantee,  or  a guarantee  \nfully covered by counter  guarantee/s  of the Central  Government,  State  \nGovernments,  public  sector  financial  institutions  and / or insurance \ncompanies.  4   \n1.1.6  Unsecured Guarantees  \n \nBanks  should avoid undue concentration of unsecured guarantee  \ncommitments to particular groups of customers and / or trades. The  \nbanks' Board of Directors should fix suitable proportions for issuance of  \nunsecured guarantees on behalf of any individual constituent so that  \nthese guarantees do not exceed  a - \n \n(a) reasonable proportion of the total obligations in respect of  \nunsecured guarantees  provided by the bank  to all such  constituents  \nat any time, and \n \n(b) reasonable  multiple  of the shareholdings  in the bank.  \n \n1.1.7  Deferred Payment Guarantees  \n \n(i) Banks  should generally provide deferred payment  guarantees  \nbacked by adequate tangible securities  or by counter guarantees of the \nCentral or the State Government or public  sector  financial  institutions  or \nof insurance companies  and other  banks.  \n \n(ii) Banks, which intend to issue deferred payment guarantees on  \nbehalf of their borrowers for acquisition of capital assets should ensure \nthat the total credit facilities including the proposed deferred payment  \nguarantees  do not exceed the prescribed exposure ceilings . \n \n(iii) The proposals  for deferred payment  guarantees  should be \nexamined having regard to the profitability / cash flows of the project to ensure that sufficient surpluses are generated by the borrowing unit to  \nmeet the commitments as a bank has to meet the liability at regular  \nintervals  in respect  of the instalments  due. The criteria  generally  followed \nfor appraising a term loan proposal for acquisition of capital  assets  \nshould also be applied  while  issuing  deferred payment                                     guarantees.  \n \n1.2  Guarantees in respect  of Commodities covered under  Selective \nCredit Controls  \n \nUCBs should not issue, either to a Court or to Government, or any other  \nperson,  a guarantee on behalf  of or on account  of any importers  guaranteeing \npayment of customs duty and / or import duty, or other levies,  payable in \nrespect of import of essential commodities without taking, as  security for \nissue of such guarantees, a cash margin equivalent to at least  one half of the \namount payable under the guarantee. The term \"essential  commodities\" shall \nmean such commodities as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of  India \nfrom time to time.  5  1.3 Safeguards in Issuance of Guarantees  \n \nWhile  issuing  financial  guarantees,  banks  should observe the following  \nsafeguards:  \n \n(i) UCBs shall appraise the proposals for guarantees with the same diligence \nas in the case of fund based limits and such assessments shall inter alia  \nfactor in the presence of security, adequate margin, etc., or otherwise.  \n \n(ii) Bank guarantees should be issued in security forms serially numbered to \nprevent  issuance of fake guarantees.  \n \n(iii) Guarantees above a particular cut off point, as may be decided by  each \nbank, should be issued under two signatures in triplicate, one copy  each for \nthe branch, beneficiary and Controlling Office / Head Office. It  should be \nbinding on the part of the beneficiary to seek confirmation of the Controlling \nOffice / Head Office as w ell for which a specific stipulation be incorporated in \nthe guarantee itself.  \n \n(iv) The guarantees should not normally be allowed to the customers who \ndo not enjoy  credit  facilities  with the banks  but only maintain current  \naccounts. If any requests are received from such customers, the banks  \nshould subject the proposals to thorough scrutiny and satisfy themselves  \nabout  the genuine need of the customers.  Banks  should be satisfied  that \nthe customers  would  be in a position to meet  the claims  under  the \nguarantees, when received, and not approach the bank for credit facility in  \nthis regard. For this purpose the banks should enquire into the financial  \nposition of the customers,  the source of funds  from which  they would be in \na position to meet the liability and prescribe a suitable margin and obtain  \nother security, as necessary. The banks  may also call for the detailed  \nfinancial statements and Wealth- tax / Income -tax returns of the customer to  \nsatisfy themselves of their financial status. The observations of the banks in \nrespect of  all these points  should be recorded in banks' books.  \n \n(v) Where the customers  enjoy  credit  facilities  with other  banks,  the \nreasons for their approaching the bank for extending the guarantees should  \nbe ascertained and invariably, a reference should be made to their existing  \nbankers  with whom  they are enjoying credit facilities.  \n \n(vi) Banks, when approached to issue guarantees in favour of other banks  \nfor grant of credit facilities by another bank, should examine thoroughly the  \nreasons  for approaching another  bank  for grant  of credit  facilities  and satisfy \nthemselves of the need for doing so. This should be recorded in bank's  \nbooks.  \n \nWhen it is considered necessary  to issue  such  guarantees,  the banks  \nconcerned should ensure that the relative guarantee document, beyond a  \nstipulated amount,  should not be signed singly  but by two authorised officials \njointly after obtaining proper sanction and authority and proper  record of such \nguarantee issued being maintained. The credit proposals  should be 6  subjected to usual scrutiny by the lending bank ensuring that the  proposals  \nconform  to the prescribed norms  and guidelines  and credit  facilities are \nallowed only if the bank is satisfied about the merits of the proposal  and the \navailability  of another  bank's  guarantee should not result  in a dilution of \nthe standards  of evaluation of the proposal  and financial                    discipline  in \nlending.  \n \n1.4 Payment  under  Bank  Guarantees - Immediate  Settlement  of Cases  \n \n(i) Government of India and Reserve Bank of India have been receiving a  \nnumber  of complaints  on non-payment  or delay  in payment  of bank  \nguarantees upon invocation.  \n \n \n(ii)   The bank guarantee is a commitment made by the issuing bank to  make   \npayment  to the beneficiary  (albeit  at the behest  of the bank's  constituent). \nFailure on the part of the bank to honour the claim legitimately  made on it \nprojects  a distorted picture of its functioning.  \n \n(iii) In fact some strictures were passed by Courts in the past against  banks  \nfor not honouring the guarantee commitments  promptly. In this connection, \nan extract of a judgment pronounced by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in a \ncase on the issue of injunctions obtained by parties from courts  restraining  \npayment of  invoked guarantees is  appended :  \n \n\"We are therefore, of  the opinion that the correct position of law is that  \ncommitment of banks must be honoured free from interference by the \ncourts and it is only in exceptional cases, that is to say, in case of fraud  \nor in case  where irretrievable  injustice  would  be done,  if bank  guarantee  \nis allowed  to be encashed, the court should interfere.\"  \n \n(iv) The UCBs should, therefore, honour  bank guarantees issued by them \npromptly on their invocation as reluctance on their part to honour \ncommitments in respect of invoked guarantees tend to bring the banking  \nsystem  into disrepute.  \n \n1.5 Delay  in Obtaining Certified  Copies of Judgments \n \n(i) The Ministry of Finance has advised that some of the Departments  such \nas Department of Revenue, Govt. of India, are finding it difficult to execute \njudgments delivered by various courts in their favour as banks do not honour \ntheir guarantees unless certified copies of the court judgments  are made \navailable to them.  \n \n(ii) Keeping in view these difficulties,  banks  may follow the following  \nprocedure:  \n \n(a) Where the bank is a party to the proceeding initiated by \nGovernment for enforcement of bank guarantee and the case is decided \nin favour of the  Government  by the Court,  bank  should not insist  on 7  production of certified   copy  of the judgment  as the judgment  order  is \npronounced in open                                            court in the presence of the parties / their counsels \nand the judgment is  known to the bank  and a copy of the judgement is \navailable on websites of the Courts . \n \n(b) In case the bank is not a party to the proceeding, a signed copy of  \nthe minutes of the order certified by the Registrar / Deputy or Assistant  \nRegistrar of the High Court duly attested to be true copy by Govt.  \nCounsel should be sufficient for honouring the obligation under the  \nguarantees  unless  the guarantor  bank  decides  to file any appeal  against \nthe order  of the High Court.  \n \n1.6 Correspondence with Government  Departments  \n \n(i) The Constitution of India states that all executive action relating to Union  \nof India shall be, and shall be stated  to be, in the name of President                                            of India. \nHowever, the business of the Government of India is transacted through \nseveral ministries / departments and even though documents such as \nguarantees  reflect  the President  of India  as one of the parties,  \ncorrespondence is not to be exchanged with the President of India but with \nconcerned Government  Ministry  / Departments.  \n \n(ii) The banks should, therefore, ensure that any correspondence relating  \nto guarantees furnished by the banks in the name of the President of India  \nfavouring the Government Departments should not be addressed to the President  of India causing avoidable inconvenience to the President's  \nSecretariat.  \n \n2. Co-acceptance of Bills  \n \n2.1 Irregularities in Co-acceptance  of Bills  \n \n(i) Banks  have been co-accepting  bills of their customers.  On many  \noccasions these bills turn out to be accommodation bills drawn by groups of  \nsister concerns on each other where no genuine trade transaction takes  \nplace. Such bills on maturity are not honoured by the drawees and the banks  \nwhich  have co-accepted the bills have to make payment  of these bills \nand thereafter, they find it difficult to recover the amount from the drawers / drawees of bills. This happens because the financial position and capacity of the parties to honour the bills, in the event of need, is not gone into by the banks co- accepting the bills.  \n \n(ii) There have also been cases  where the particulars  regarding co- \nacceptance of bills are not recorded in the bank's books with the result that  \nthe extent of co- acceptance cannot be verified during inspections and the  \nHead Office becomes aware of the co- acceptance only when a claim is  \nreceived from the discounting bank.  \n  \n 8  2.2 Safeguards \n \nIn view of the above,  banks  should keep in view the following  safeguards:  \n \n(i) While sanctioning co- acceptance limits to their customers, the need \ntherefor e should be ascertained and such limits should be extended only \nto their customers  enjoying other limits with the bank.  \n \n(ii) Only genuine trade bills should be co- accepted and the banks should  \nensure that the goods covered by bills co- accepted are actually received \nin the stock accounts of  the borrowers.  \n \n(iii) The valuation of the goods as mentioned in the accompanying invoice \nshould also be verified  to see that there is no over valuation of stocks.  \n \n(iv) The banks should not extend their co- acceptance to house bills /  \naccommodation bills drawn  by group concerns  on one another.  \n \n(v) The powers to co- accept bills, beyond a stipulated limit, must be exercised  \nby two  authorised officials jointly.  \n \n(vi) Proper records of the bills co- accepted for each customer should be \nmaintained  so that the commitments  for each customer  and the total \ncommitments at a branch can be readily ascertained and these should be  \nscrutinised by internal  inspectors  and commented upon  in their reports.  \n \n(vii) Proper  periodical  returns  may be prescribed so that the Branch Managers \nreport such co- acceptance commitments entered into by them to the \ncontrolling offices. Such returns should also reveal the position of bills  that \nhave become overdue and which the bank had to meet under the co-  \nacceptance  obligation.  This will enable the controlling  offices  to monitor  \nsuch co -acceptances furnished by the branches and take suitable action in \ntime, in  difficult  cases.  \n \n3. Letters of Credit  (LCs)  \n \n3.1 Guidelines  for Grant  of LCs Facility  \n \nUCBs should not normally  grant  LC facilities  in respect of parties who \nmaintain only nominal current accounts. In case of    borrowers maintaining \nonly current accounts, who approach for opening of  LCs, banks should \ninvariably ascertain from the existing bankers of the borrowers the reasons \nas to why they are not extending LC facilities to the  concerned borrowers. \nBanks should open LCs in respect of such parties  only after making proper \nenquiries in regard to the antecedents of the borrowers from the bankers with \nwhom the parties are enjoying main limits,  their financial position and their \nability to retire the bills. They should also prescribe a suitable  margin and \nobtain other security, as  necessary.  \n \n 9  3.2 LCs for Commodities  covered under  Selective Credit  Controls \n \nThere is no restriction for the banks in opening LCs for import of essential  \nitems. However, banks are not permitted to open inland LCs, providing a  \nclause therein which would enable other banks to discount usance bills  under \nthe LCs.  \n \n3.3 Safeguards in Opening of LCs \n \nBefore opening LCs, banks  should ensure that : \n \n(i) LCs are issued in security  forms  only;  \n \n(ii) Large LCs are issued under two authorised signatures where one of  the \nsignatures for LCs should be from the Head Office / Controlling Office.  \nAs the need for large LCs may not arise overnight, with the availability \nof courier service, speed post service etc., this procedure may not result \nin delay. In the LCs itself a column may  be provided to indicate the \nauthority  who had sanctioned it together with the particulars  thereof;  \n \n(iii) LCs are not issued for amounts out of proportion to the borrowers'  \ngenuine requirements and these are opened only after ensuring that the  \nborrowers  have made adequate arrangements for retiring the bills \nreceived under  LCs out of their own resources  or from the existing  \nborrowing arrangements;  \n \n(iv) where LCs are for purchase of raw materials,  borrowers  do not maintain \nunduly high inventory of raw material s in relation to the norms /  past \ntrends. Where such LCs are to be opened on D/A basis, credit on the relative purchase is duly taken into account for the purpose of working out drawing  power  in cash credit  accounts;  \n \n(v) in the case  of borrowers  having banking arrangements  on a consortium \nbasis, the LCs are opened within the sanctioned limit on the basis of the \nagreed share of each of the banks. Member -banks should not,  however, \nopen LCs outside the sanctioned limits without the knowledge of  the lead \nbank /  other  banks;  \n \n(vi) if there is no formal  consortium  arrangement  for financing the borrower, \nLCs should not be opened by the existing bank or a new bank,  without \nthe knowledge of  the other  banks;  \n \n(vii) LCs for acquisition of capital goods should be opened only after  banks \nhave satisfied themselves about tying up of funds for meeting the relative \nliability by way of providing for long term funds or term loans from  \nfinancial  institutions /  banks;  \n \n(viii) In no case, working capital limits should be allowed to be utilised  for \nretiring  bills pertaining to acquisition of capital assets.  \n \n 10  (ix) Banks should not extend any non- fund based facilities or additional /  \nad-hoc credit facilities to parties who are not their  (the bank's) regular  \nconstituents  for their production finance requirements;  nor should they \ndiscount bills drawn under LCs or otherwise for beneficiaries who are not  \ntheir regular clients. In case it becomes unavoidably necessary to provide  \nsuch a facility to a party not being a regular client, banks should invariabl y \nseek the prior concurrence of the existing banker of the borrowers and also  \nmake proper enquiries in regard to the antecedents of the borrowers, their  \nfinancial  position  and ability to  retire  the bills  etc. in  time.  \n \n(x) With effect from March 30, 2012 in case of bills drawn under LCs  \nrestricted  to a particular  UCB,  and the beneficiary  of the LC is not a  borrower \nwho has been granted regular credit facility by that UCB, the UCB                                    concerned \nmay, as per their discretion and based on their perception about   the credit \nworthiness of the LC issuing bank, negotiate such LCs, subject to the \ncondition that the proceeds will be remitted to the regular banker of the \nbeneficiary of the LC. However, the prohibition regarding negotiation of  \nunrestricted LCs for borrowers who have not been sanctioned regular credit  \nfacilities  will continue to be in force.  \n \n(xi) UCBs negotiating bills as above, under restricted LCs, would have to  \nadhere to the instructions of the Reserve Bank / RCS or CRCS regarding  \nshare linking to borrowing and provisions of Co- operative Societies Act on  \nmembership \n \n3.4 Payment  under  LCs - Immediate Settlement  of Claims  \n \n(i) There have been a few instances where LCs were opened by officials  \nof banks in an unauthorised manner. In certain cases, the LCs transactions  \nwere not recorded in the books of the branch by officials issuing them, while  \nin some other  cases  the amounts  of LCs were  much in excess  of the \npowers  vested in them  for the purpose.  Subsequently  when the banks  \ncome to know  about  the fraudulent  issue  of LCs, they disclaim  liability  on \nthe ground that these are transactions involving a conspiracy / collusion between the beneficiary  and the constituent.  \n \n(ii) It may be appreciated that if the bills drawn under  LCs are not \nhonoured, it will adversely affect the character of LCs and the relative bills  as \nan accepted means of payment. This could also affect the credibility of  the \nentire payment mechanism through banks and affect the image of the  banks. \nIt is, therefore , necessary that all the banks should honour their  commitments  \nunder  LCs and make  payments  promptly  leaving no opportunity for any \ncomplaints in this regard. Needless to say that banks  should take suitable \naction against the concerned officials as well as the constituents on whose \nbehalf the LCs are opened and the beneficiaries of  LCs, if  a criminal  \nconspiracy is involved.  \n \n \n  11   \n4. Other  Common  Guidelines \n \n4.1 Credit Exposure Norms and Statutory / Other Restrictions on Non-  \nfund Based Limits \n \n(i) UCBs are required to strictly observe  exposure norms and statutory / \nother restrictions prescribed for non- fund based limits (e.g. LCs, Guarantees, \nCo-acceptances, etc.) as detailed in the  Master  Circular  on 'Exposure Norms  \nand Statutory  / Other  Restrictions  and other norms i ssued by RBI from time \nto time . \n \n(ii) The exposure ceilings  and other  restrictions  particularly  prescribed for \n \n \na) total credit  exposure including  non-fund based limits,  \n \nb) unsecured guarantees,  \n \nc) advances  to bank's  Directors,  \n \nd) loans  and advances  to relatives  of Directors, \n \ne) advances to nominal members,  \nmust be strictly observed.  \n4.2 Banks should ensure that the systems evolved for recording the details of  \noff-balance sheet transactions are properly followed by all branches. These \nrecords  should be periodically  balanced and internal  inspectors  should verify  \nthe same and offer  critical comments.  \n \n4.3 Banks  should ensure that unauthorised LCs are not issued.  \n \n4.4 Banks must lay down clear instructions for their branch staff in respect of  \nloan accounts where such non- funded facilities become funded on account of  \ndevolvement  of bills covered under  the bank's  LCs or due to invocation  of \nguarantees issued by the bank. The banks must evolve proper guidelines to  \nensure that, accounts where non- funded limits become \"funded\" are cl osely  \nmonitored and goods  covered under  devolved bills remain under  bank's  control  \n/ hypothecation, particularly where malafides are suspected. In cases of goods  \ncovered under import LCs, banks must also ensure immediate submission of  \ncustom's copy of the Bill of Entry and take measures as prescribed in the  \nguidelines  issued by  Foreign Exchange Department.  \n \n4.5 A number of banks adopt the practice of parking the dues of the borrower  \nin respect of devolved LCs and invoked guarantees in a separate account which  \nis not a regular sanctioned facility. As a result, these are not reflected in the  \nprincipal operating account of the borrower. This renders application of the  \nprudential  norms  for identification of NPAs  difficult.  It is, therefore,  advised that 12  if the debts  arising out of devolvement of LCs or invoked guarantees are parked  \nin a separate account, the balance outstanding in that account also should be  \ntreated as a part of the borrower's principal operating account for the purpose of  \napplication of prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and  \nprovisioning.  \n \n4.6 Banks are encouraged to strengthen their information back up about the  \nborrowers enjoying credit facilities from multiple banks by obtaining declaration  \nfrom the borrowers about the credit  facilities already enjoyed by them from other  \nbanks.  In the case of  existing  lenders,  all the banks  may seek  a declaration from \ntheir existing borrowers availing sanctioned limits of Rs. 5.00 crore and above  or \nwherever, it is in their knowledge that thei r borrowers are availing credit  facilities \nfrom other banks and introduce a system of exchange of information with other \nbanks. Subsequently banks should exchange information about the conduct  of \nthe borrowers' accounts  with other  banks  at least  at quarterly  intervals. Banks \nshould also make use of CRILC or credit reports available from Credit  Information \nCompanies. The banks should incorporate suitable clauses in the loan \nagreements regarding exchange of credit information so as to address  \nconfident iality issues.  Banks  should also obtain regular  certification  by a \nprofessional, preferably a Company Secretary, Chartered Accountant or Cost  \nAccountant regarding compliance of various statutory prescriptions that are in  \nvogue. The formats for collecting i nformation from the borrowers, exchange of  \ninformation among banks and certification by a professional are furnished in our  \ncircular UBD.PCB.No.36/13.05.000/2008- 09 dated J anuary 21, 2009  read with  \ncircular  UBD.PCB.No.59/13.05.000/2008- 09 dated April 9, 2009 . \n \n4.7 Banks are exposed to various risks in every financial transaction including  \ncommitments  in the form of Guarantees,  Co-acceptances,  LCs etc. The \nmanagements of UCBs have to base their business decisions on sound risk  \nmanagement systems with the ultimate objective of protecting the interest of  \ndepositors  and stakeholders.  It is, therefore,  important  that UCBs  adopt  effective  \nAsset -Liability  Management  (ALM)  systems to address  the issues     related to \nliquidity, interest rate and currency risks. Banks should invariably  follow the ALM \nguidelines  issued by  Reserve Bank  in this regard.  \n \n 13   \nAnnex  \n \nA.

General  \n1.1 In order to reflect a bank's actual financial health in its balance sheet and as per the recommendations \nmade by the Committee on Financial System (Chairman Shri M. Narasimham), the Reserve Bank has \nintroduced, in a phased manner, prudential norms for income recognition, asset classification and \nprovisioning for the advances portfol io of the banks.  \n1.2 Broadly, the policy of income recognition should be objective and based on record of recovery rather than on any subjective considerations. Likewise, the classification of assets of banks has to be done on the \nbasis of objective criter ia, which would ensure a uniform and consistent application of the norms. The \nprovisioning should gene rally be made on the basis of the classification of assets into different categories.  \n1.3 The requirements of the State Co- operative Societies Acts and / or rules made thereunder or other \nstatutory enactments may continue to be followed, if they are more stringent than those prescribed hereby.  \n1.4 With the introduction of prudential norms, the Health Code based system for classification of advances \nhas ceas ed to be a subject of supervisory interest. As such, all related reporting requirements, etc. also \nceased to be a supervisory requirement, but could be continued in the banks entirely at their discretion and \nthe management policy, if felt necessary.  \n2. Non -performing Assets (NPA)  \n2.1 Classification of Assets as Non -Performing  \n2.1.1 An asset becomes non- performing when it ceases to generate income for the bank.  \n2.1.2 With a view to moving towards international best practices and to ensure greater transparency, '90 \ndays' overdue\n1 norms for identification of NPAs have been made applicable from the year ended March \n31, 2004. As such, with effect from March 31, 2004, a non- performing asset is a loan or an advance where:  \n(i) Interest and / or installment of princ ipal remain overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect of \na Term Loan.  \n(ii) The account remains  'Out of order'2, in respect of an Overdraft / Cash Credit (OD/CC).  \n(iii) The bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bil ls purchased and discounted.  \n(iv) In the case of direct agricultural advances as listed in Annex 1 , the overdue norm specified at para 2.1. 3 \nwould be applicable. In respect of agricultural loans, other than those specified in Annex 1 , identification of \nNPAs would be done on the same basis as non -agricultural advances.  \n(v) Any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect of other \naccounts.  \n(vi) In addition, an account  may also be classified as NPA in terms of certain specific provisions of this \nMaster Circular, including inter alia paragraphs 2.2.7 and clarifications provided under the frequently asked \nquestions (FAQs) in Annex -4. \n                                                            \n1 Any amount d ue to the bank under any credit facility, if not paid by the due date fixed by the bank becomes overdue.  \n2 An account should be treated as 'out of order' if the outstanding balance remains continuously in excess of the sanctioned li mit \n/ drawing power for 90 days. In cases where the outstanding balance in the principal operating account is less than the sanctioned \nlimit / drawing power, but there are no credits continuously for 90 days as on the date of balance sheet or credits are not e nough \nto cover the interest debited during the same period, these accounts should be treated as 'out of order'.  \n2.1.3 Agricultural Advance  \n(i) With effect from September 30, 2004,  the following norms are applicable to all direct agricultural \nadvances ( Annex 1 ): \na) A loan granted for short duration crops will be treated as NPA, if the installment of principal or interest \nthereon remains overdue for two crop seasons.  \nb) A loan granted for long duration crops will be treated as NPA, if the installment of principal or interest \nthereon remains overdue for one crop season.  \n(ii) For the purpose of these gui delines, \"long duration\" crops would be crops with crop season longer than \none year and crops, which are not \"long duration\" crops would be treated as \"short duration\" crops.  \n(iii) The crop season for each crop, which means the period up to harvesting of t he crops raised, would be \nas determined by the State Level Bankers' Committee in each state.  \n(iv) Depending upon the duration of crops raised by an agriculturist, the above NPA norms would also be \nmade applicable to agricultural term loans availed of by hi m. In respect of agricultural loans, other than \nthose specified in the Annex 1  identification of NPAs would be done on the same basis as non -agricultural \nadvances, which, at present, is the 90 days delinquency norm.  \n(v) Banks sho uld ensure that while granting loans and advances, realistic repayment schedules are fixed \non the basis of cash flows / fluidity with the borrowers.  \n2.1.4 Identification of Assets as NPAs should be done on an ongoing basis  \n(i) The system should ensure that  identification of NPAs is done on an on- going basis and accounts are \nclassified as NPA immediately , as soon as they turn into NPA as per the guidelines contained in this circular, \nwithout waiting till the end of quarter/financial year. Banks should also m ake provisions for NPAs as at the \nend of each calendar quarter i.e.  as at the end of March / June / September / December, so that the income \nand expenditure account for the respective quarters as well as the P&L account and balance sheet for the year end r eflects the provision made for NPAs.  \n(ii) UCBs having t otal assets of \u20b92000 crore or above as on March 31, 2020 were required to implement \nsystem -based asset classification\n3 with effect from June 30, 2021.  \n(iii) UCBs having total assets of \u20b91000 crore or above but less than \u20b92000 crore as on March 31, 2020 and  \nhaving self -assessed themselves as being under Level III or Level IV in terms of the circular \nDoS.CO/CSITE/BC.4083/31.01.052/2019- 20 dated December 31, 2019  on Comprehens ive Cyber Security \nFramework for UCBs were required to implement system -based asset classification with effect from \nSeptember 30, 2021.  \n(iv) UCBs which meet the above criteria as at the end of the financial year 2020- 2021 or subsequent \nfinancial years shal l implement system- based asset classification within a period of six months from the \nend of the financial year concerned.  For smooth implementation of the system, such  UCBs may conduct \npilot/parallel run and evaluate the results for accuracy/integrity of t he asset classification in compliance with \nthe applicable RBI instructions so as to ensure that they are ready for implementation of the system -based \nasset classification from the appointed date.  \n                                                            \n3 \u2018System- based asset classification\u2019 would mean asset classification (downgrading as well as upgrading) carried out by the CBS / \ncomputerized systems of the bank i n an automated manner on an ongoing basis, based on the relevant RBI \ninstructions/guidelines.   \n(v) UCBs not meeting the above criteria are also encouraged to voluntarily implement the system -based \nasset classification in their own interest.  \n2.1.5 Charging of Interest  at monthly  rests  \n(i) Banks should charge interest at monthly rests in the context of adoption of 90 days norm for recognition \nof loan impairment w.e.f. from the year ended March 31, 2004 and consequential need for close monitoring \nof borrowers' accounts.  \n(ii) The charging / compounding of interest on agricultural advances would be linked to crop seasons and \nthe instructions regarding charging of interest on monthly rests shall not be applicable to agricultural \nadvances.  \n(iii) Banks should take into consideration due date/s fixed on the basis of fluidity with borrowers and \nharvesting / marketing season while charging interest and compound the sam e if the loan / installment \nbecomes overdue in respect of short duration crops and allied agricultural activities.  \n2.1.6  Reporting of Large Exposures to Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) \n- UCBs   \n(i) Primary (Urban) Co -operative Banks (UCBs) having total assets of \u20b9500 crore and shall report credit \ninformation, including classification of an account as Special Mention Account (SMA), on all borrowers \nhaving aggregate exposures of \u20b95 crore and above with them to Central Repository of I nformation on Large \nCredits (CRILC) maintained by the Reserve Bank. Aggregate exposure shall include all fund- based and \nnon-fund based exposure, including investment exposure on the borrower.  \n(ii) Special Mention Account (SMA)  \nSpecial Mention Account (SMA)  is an account which is exhibiting signs of incipient stress resulting in the \nborrower defaulting in timely servicing of her debt obligations, though the account has not yet been \nclassified as NPA . As early recognition of such accounts enable s banks to ini tiate timely remedial actions \nto prevent their potential slippages into NPAs, UCBs having total assets of \u20b9500 crore and above shall classify loans/advances accounts as SMA, as under:  \n \nSMA Sub -\ncategories  Basis for classification  \nPrincipal or interest payme nt or any other amount \nwholly or partially overdue for  \nSMA -0 1-30 days  \nSMA -1 31-60 days  \nSMA -2 61-90 days  \nIn case of revolving credit facilities like cash credit, the SMA sub- categories will be as follows:  \nSMA Sub -\ncategories  \n Basis for classification  \nOutstanding balance remains continuously in excess \nof the sanctioned limit or drawing power, whichever \nis lower, for a period of  \nSMA -1 31-60 days  \nSMA -2 61-90 days  \n(iii) UCBs having total assets of \u20b9500 crore and above are required to submit CRILC Report on quarterly \nbasis with effect from December 31, 2019. Detailed operating instr uctions have been issued vide circular \nDoS.OSMOS.No.4633/33.05.018/2019 -20 dated January 16, 2020  on \u2018Reporting of Large Exposures to \nCentral Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) \u2013 UCBs\u2019 by the Department of Supervision, \nReserve Bank of India.   \n (iv) UCB s should take utmost care about data accuracy and integrity while submitting the information /data \non large credit to RBI, failing which penal action as per the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \nmay be taken.  \n2.2 Treatment of Accounts as NPAs  \n2.2.1  Record of Recovery  \n(i) The treatment of an asset as NPA should be based on the record of recovery. Banks should not treat an \nadvance as NPA merely due to existence of some deficiencies which are temporary in nature such as non-availability of adequat e drawing power, balance outstanding exceeding the limit, non- submission of stock \nstatements and the non- renewal of the limits on the due date, etc. Where there is a threat of loss, or the \nrecoverability of the advances is in doubt, the asset should be treated as NPA.  \n(ii) A credit facility should be treated as NPA as per norms given in paragraph 2.1 above. However, where \nthe accounts of the borrowers have been regularised by repayment of entire overdue amounts through \ngenuine sources (not by sanction of additional facilities or transfer of funds between accounts), the accounts \nneed not be treated as NPAs. In such cases, it should, however, be ensured that the accounts remain in \norder subsequently and a solitary credit entry made in an account on or before t he balance sheet date \nwhich extinguishes the overdue amount of interest or installment of principal is not reckoned as the sole \ncriteria for treatment of the account as a standard asset.   \n2.2.2  Treatment of NPAs - Borrower -wise and not Facility -wise  \n(i) In respect of a borrower having more than one facility with a bank, all the facilities granted by the bank \nwill have to be treated as NPA and not the particular facility or part thereof which has become irregular /NPA.  \n(ii) However, in respect of consortium a dvances or financing under multiple banking arrangements, each \nbank may classify the borrowal accounts according to its own record of recovery and other aspects having \na bearing on the recoverability of the advances.  Each bank shall follow the principle at  (i) above for NPA \nclassification of a borrower.  \n2.2.3  Agricultural Advances - Default in repayment due to Natural Calamities  \n(i) Where natural calamities impair the repaying capacity of agricultural borrowers, as a relief measure, banks may decide on thei r own to :  \n(a) convert the short -term production loan into a term loan or re- schedule the repayment period, and  \n(b) sanction fresh short -term loans  \n(ii) In such cases of conversion or re -schedulement, the term loan as well as fresh short -term loan may be \ntreated as current dues and need not be classified as non- performing asset (NPA). The asset classification \nof these loans would, therefore, be governed by the revised terms and conditions and these would be treated as NPA under the extant norms applicable f or classifying agricultural advances as NPAs.  \n2.2.4  Housing Loan to Staff  \nIn the case of housing loan or similar advances granted to staff members where interest is payable after \nrecovery of principal, interest need not be considered as overdue from the fi rst month onwards. Such loans \n/ advances should be classified as NPA only when there is a default in repayment of instalment of principal \nor payment of interest on the respective due dates.   \n2.2.5  Credit facilities Guaranteed by Central / State Government  \n(i) The credit facilities backed by guarantee of the Central Government though overdue should not be \ntreated as NPA . \n(ii) This exemption from classification of government guaranteed advances as NPA is not for the purpose \nof recognition of income.  \n(iii) Fro m the year ended March 31, 2006, State Government guaranteed advance and investment in State \nGovernment guaranteed securities would attract asset classification and provisioning norms, if interest and \n/ or principal or any other amount due to the bank remains overdue for more than 90 days , irrespective of \nthe fact whether the guarantee have been invoked or not.  \n2.2.6  Project Financing  \n'Project Loan' would mean any term loan which has been extended for the purpose of setting up of an \neconomic venture. Banks must fix a Date of Commencement of Commercial Operations (DCCO) for all \nproject loans at the time of sanction of the loan / financial closure (in the case of multiple banking or \nconsortium arrangements).  \nFor the purpose of Income Recognition and Asset Clas sification norms, all project loans may be divided \ninto the following two categories; (i) Project Loans for infrastructure sector (ii) Project Loans for non -\ninfrastructure sector. Detailed guidelines are given in Annex 8. \nIn the case of bank finance given for industrial projects where moratorium is available for payment of \ninterest, payment of interest becomes due only after the moratorium or gestation period is over. Therefore, such amounts of interest do not become overdue and hence NPA, with reference to the date of debit of \ninterest. They become overdue after due date for payment of interest, if uncollected.  \n2.2.7  Prudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances  \nThe prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances are detai led as under:  \n(a) Asset Classification Norms  \n2.2.7.1 Restructuring of advances could take place in the following stages:  \ni. before commencement of commercial production / operation;  \nii. after commencement of commercial production / operation but before the asset has been classified \nas 'sub -standard';  \niii. after commencement of commercial production / operation and the asset has been classified as \n'sub-standard' or 'doubtful'.  \n2.2.7.2 The accounts classified as 'standard assets' should be immediately re- classified as 'sub -standard \nassets' upon restructuring.  \n2.2.7.3 The non performing assets, upon restructuring, would slip into further lower asset classification \ncategory as per extant asset classification norms with reference to the pre -restructuring repayment \nschedule.  \n  \n2.2.7.4 All restructured accounts which have been classified as non -performing assets upon restructuring, \nwould be eligible for upgradation to the 'standard' category after observation of 'satisfactory performance' \nduring the 'specified period' ( Annex 5 ). \n2.2.7.5 In case, however, satisfactory performance during the specified period is not evidenced, the asset \nclassification of the restructured account would be governed as per the applicable prudential norms with \nreference to the  pre-restructuring payment schedule . \n2.2.7.6 Any additional finance may be treated as 'standard asset', up to a period of one year after the first \ninterest / principal payment, whichever is earlier, falls due under the approved restructuring package. \nHowe ver, in the case of accounts where the pre -restructuring facilities were classified as 'sub- standard' and \n'doubtful', interest income on the additional finance should be recognised only on cash basis. If the \nrestructured asset does not qualify for upgradat ion at the end of the above specified one year period, the \nadditional finance shall be placed in the same asset classification category as the restructured debt.  \n2.2.7.7 In respect of loan accounts which enjoy special regulatory treatment as per para 2.2.7.2 5, upon \nrestructuring, such non -performing assets would continue to have the same asset classification as prior to \nrestructuring. In case satisfactory performance of the account is not evidenced during the 'specified period', \nit would slip into further l ower asset classification categories as per extant asset classification norms with \nreference to the pre-restructuring repayment schedule . \n2.2.7.8 In case a restructured asset, which is a standard asset on restructuring, is subjected to restructuring on a s ubsequent occasion, it should be classified as substandard. If the restructured asset is a sub- standard \nor a doubtful asset and is subjected to restructuring, on a subsequent occasion, its asset classification will \nbe reckoned from the date when it became NPA on the first occasion. However, such advances restructured \non second or more occasion may be allowed to be upgraded to standard category after one year from the \ndate of first payment of interest or repayment of principal whichever falls due earlier in terms of the current \nrestructuring package subject to satisfactory performance.  \n(b) Income Recognition Norms  \n2.2.7.9 Subject to provisions of paragraphs 2.2.7.6 and 2.2.7.22 interest  income in respect of restructured \naccounts classified as 'standard assets ' will be recognized on accrual basis and that in respect of the \naccount classified as 'non performing assets' will be recognized on cash basis.  \n(c) Provisioning Norms  \n2.2.7.10 Normal Provisions  \nBanks will hold provision against the restructured advances on the basis of classification of assets into \nprescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 below . \n2.2.7.11 Provision for Diminution in the Fair Value of restructured Advances  \nThe erosion in the fair value of the advance should be computed as the difference between the fair value \nof the loan before and after restructuring. Fair value of the loan before restructuring will be computed as \nthe present value of cash flows representing the interest at the existing rate charged on the advance before \nrestructurin g and the principal, discounted at a rate equal to the bank's BPLR as on the date of restructuring \nplus the appropriate term premium and credit risk premium for the borrower category on the date of \nrestructuring\". Fair value of the loan after restructuring will be computed as the present value of cash flows \nrepresenting the interest at the rate charged on the advance on restructuring and the principal, discounted \nat a rate equal to the bank's BPLR as on the date of restructuring plus the appropriate term pr emium and \ncredit risk premium for the borrower category on the date of restructuring\".  \n  \n2.2.7.12 It may please be noted that the above formula moderates the swing in the diminution of present \nvalue of loans with the interest rate cycle and will have to be followed consistently in future.  \n2.2.7.13 Further, it is reiterated that the provisions required as above arise due to the action of the banks \nresulting in change in contractual terms of the loan upon restructuring which are in the nature of financial \nconcessions. These provisions are distinct from the provisions which are linked to the asset classification \nof the account classified as NPA and reflect the impairment due to deterioration in the credit quality of the \nloan. Thus, the two types of the provisi ons are not substitute for each other.  \n2.2.7.14 It is also re- emphasised that the guidelines on restructuring of advances by RBI are aimed at \nproviding an opportunity to banks and borrowers to preserve the economic value of the units and should \nnot be look ed at as a means to evergreen the advances.  \n2.2.7.15 In their published annual Balance Sheets , banks shall make disclosures as per Annex -6  \n2.2.7.16 In the case of working capital facilities, the diminution in the fair value of t he cash credit / overdraft \ncomponent may be computed as indicated in para 2.2.7.11 above, reckoning the higher of the outstanding \namount or the limit sanctioned as the principal amount and taking the tenor of the advance as one year. \nThe term premium in th e discount factor would be as applicable for one year. The fair value of the term loan \ncomponents (Working Capital Term Loan and Funded Interest Term Loan) would be computed as per \nactual cash flows and taking the term premium in the discount factor as applicable for the maturity of the \nrespective term loan components.  \n2.2.7.17 In the event any security is taken in lieu of the diminution in the fair value of the advance, it should \nbe valued at Re.1 This will ensure that the effect of charging off the econom ic sacrifice to the Profit & Loss \naccount is not negated.  \n2.2.7.18 The diminution in the fair value may be re- computed on each balance sheet date till satisfactory \ncompletion of all repayment obligations and full repayment of the outstanding in the account , so as to \ncapture the changes in the fair value on account of changes in BPLR, term  premium and the credit category \nof the borrower. Consequently, banks may provide for the shortfall in provision or reverse the amount of \nexcess provision held in the disti nct account.  \n2.2.7.19 If due to lack of expertise / appropriate infrastructure, a bank finds it difficult to ensure computation \nof diminution in the fair value of advances extended by small branches, as an alternative to the methodology prescribed above for computing the amount of diminution in the fair value, banks will have the option of \nnotionally computing the amount of diminution in the fair value and providing therefore, at five percent of \nthe total exposure, in respect of all restructured accounts wh ere the total dues to bank(s) are less than \nrupees one crore.   \n2.2.7.20 The total provisions required against an account (normal provisions plus provisions in lieu of diminution in the fair value of the advance) are capped at 100% of the outstanding debt amount.  \n(d) Prudential Norms for Conversion of Unpaid Interest into 'Funded Interest Term Loan' (FITL)  \n2.2.7.21 Asset Classification Norms  \nThe FITL created by conversion of unpaid interest will be classified in the same asset classification category in whi ch the restructured advance has been classified. Further movement in the asset classification of FITL \nwould also be determined based on the subsequent asset classification of the restructured advance.  \n2.2.7.22 Income Recognition Norms  \n(i) The income, if any, generated may be recognised on accrual basis, if FITL is classified as 'standard', and on cash basis in the cases where the same has been classified as a non- performing asset.   \n(ii) The unrealised income represented by FITL should have a corresponding c redit in an account styled as \n\"Sundry Liabilities Account (Interest Capitalization)\".  \n(iii) Only on repayment in case of FITL, the amount received will be recognized in the P&L Account, while \nsimultaneously reducing the balance in the \"Sundry Liabilities A ccount (Interest Capitalisation)\".  \n(e) Special Regulatory Treatment for Asset Classification \n2.2.7.23 The special regulatory treatment for asset classification, in modification to the provisions in this \nregard stipulated in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8,  will be  available to the borrowers engaged in important business \nactivities, subject to compliance with certain conditions as enumerated in para 2.2.7.28  below . Such \ntreatment is not extended to the following categories of advances:  \n(i) Consumer and personal advances including advances to individuals against the securities of shares / \nbonds / debentures , etc. \n(ii) Advances to traders  \n2.2.7.24 The asset classification of the above two categories of accounts as well as that of other accounts \nwhich do not comply with the conditions enumerated in para 2.2.7.28 , will be governed by the prudential \nnorms in this regard described in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8 above.  \n(f) Elements of Special Regulatory Framework  \n2.2.7.2 5 The special regulatory treatment has the following two co mponents:  \n(i) Incentive for quick implementation of the restructuring package.  \n(ii) Retention of the asset classification of the restructured account in the pre restructuring asset \nclassification category  \n2.2.7.2 6 Incentive for Quick Implementation of the Restructuring Package  \nDuring the pendency of the application for restructuring of the advance with the bank, the usual asset \nclassification norms would continue to apply. The process of reclassification of an asset should not stop \nmerely because the applic ation is under consideration. However, as an incentive for quick implementation \nof the package, if the approved package is implemented by the bank within 90 days from the date of receipt \nof application by the bank, the asset classification status may be restored to the position which existed when the restructuring application was received by the bank.  \n2.2.7.2 7 Asset Classification Benefits  \nSubject to the compliance with the undernoted conditions in addition to the adherence to the prudential framework laid down in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8:  \n(i) In modification to para 2.2.7.2, an existing 'standard asset' will not be downgraded to the sub- standard \ncategory upon restructuring.  \n(ii) In modification to para 2.2.7.3,  during the specified period, the asset classifi cation of the sub -standard / \ndoubtful accounts will not deteriorate upon restructuring, if satisfactory performance is demonstrated during \nthe specified period.  \n  \n2.2.7.2 8 However, these benefits will be available subject to compliance with the following c onditions:  \ni) The dues to the bank are 'fully secured' as defined in Annex 5 . The condition of being fully secured by \ntangible security will not be applicable in the following cases :  \n(a) SSI borrowers, where the outstanding is up to \u20b925 lakh.  \n(b) infrastructure projects, provided the cash flows generated from these projects are adequate for \nrepayment of the advance, the financing bank(s) have in place an appropriate mechanism to \nescrow the cash flows, and also have a clear and legal first claim on these cash flows.  \n(c) WCTL created by conversion of the irregular portion of principal dues over the drawing power, \nsubject to the condition that provisions are made against the unsecured portion of the WCTL, as \nunder :  \n\u2022 Standard Assets :  20% \n\u2022 Substandard Assets : 20% during the first year and to be increased by 20% every year thereafter until the specified period (one year after the first payment is due under the \nterms of restructuring)  \n\u2022 If the account is not eligible for upgradation after the specified period, the unsecured \nportion will attract provision of 100% . \nii) The unit becomes viable in 10 years, if it is engaged in infrastructure activities, and in 7 years in the case \nof other units.  \niii) The repayment period of the restructured adv ance including the moratorium, if any, does not exceed 15 \nyears in the case of infrastructure advances and 10 years in the case of other advances. The Board of \nDirectors of the banks should prescribe the maximum period not exceeding 15 years for restructur ed \nadvances keeping in view the safety and soundness of advances.  \niv) Promoters' sacrifice and additional funds brought by them should be a minimum of 15% of banks' \nsacrifice.  \nv) Personal guarantee is offered by the promoter except when the unit is affected by external factors \npertaining to the economy and industry.  \nvi) The restructuring under consideration is not a 'repeated restructuring' as defined in para (iv) of  Annex 5\n. \n(g) Disclosures  \n2.2.7. 29 Banks should disclose in their  published annual Balance Sheets, under 'Notes on Accounts', \ninformation relating to number and amount of advances restructured and the amount of diminution in the \nfair value of the restructured advances in Annex 6 . \n(h) Illustrat ions \n2.2.7.3 0 A few illustrations on the asset classification of restructured accounts are given in Annex 7 . \n2.2.7.31 Resolution of Covid- 19 related stress implemented under the following circulars shall be subject \nto the specifi c requirements , including the prudential requirements, specified therein:  \n(i) DOR.No.BP.BC/3/21.04.048/2020 -21 dated August 6, 2020  on \u201cResolution Framework for COVID -19-\nrelated Stress\u201d read with DOR.No.BP.BC/13/21.04.048/2020- 21 dated September 7, 2020  on \u201cResolution \nFramework for COVID -19-related Stress \u2013 Financial Parameters\u201d;   \n(ii) DOR.No.BP.BC/4/21.04.048/2020- 21 dated August 6, 2020  on \u201cMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises \n(MSME) sector \u2013 Restructuring of Advances\u201d;  \n(iii) DOR.STR.REC.11/21.04.048/2021- 22 dated May 5, 2021  on \u201cResolution Framework \u2013 2.0: Resolution \nof Covid- 19 related stress of Individuals and Small Businesses\u201d read with \nDOR.STR.REC.20/21.04.048/2021- 22 dated June 4, 2021  on \u201cResolution Framework - 2.0: Resolution of \nCovid -19 related stress of Individuals and Small Businesses \u2013  Revision in the threshold for aggregate \nexpos ure\u201d; \n(iv) DOR.STR.REC.12/21.04.048/2021 -22 dated May 5, 2021  on \u2018Resolution Framework 2.0 \u2013 Resolution \nof Covid- 19 related stress of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSMEs)\u2019 read with \nDOR.STR.REC.21/21.04.048/2021- 22 dated June 4, 2021  on \u2018Resolution Framework - 2.0: Resolution of \nCovid -19 related stress of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) \u2013 Revision in the threshold for \naggregate exposure\u2019  \n2.2.7.32 MSME accounts restructured under the circulars DBR.No.BP.BC.18/21.04.048/2018- 19 dated \nJanuary 1, 2019  and DOR.No.BP.BC.34/21.04.048/2019 -20 dated February 11, 2020  shall be subject to \nthe prudential requirements specified therein.  \n2.2.8  Other Adva nces  \n(i) Advances  against term deposits, NSCs eligible for surrender, KVPs and Life policies need not be treated \nas NPAs although interest thereon may not have been paid for more than 90 days , provided adequate \nmargin is available in the accounts.  \n(ii) Banks should fix mon thly / quarterly instalments for repayment of gold loans for non -agricultural \npurposes taking into account the pattern of income generation and repayment capacity of the borrowers \nand such gold loan accounts may be treated as NPAs if instalments of princip al and / or interest thereon \nare overdue for more than 90 days.  \n(iii) As regards gold loans granted for agricultural purposes, interest is required to be charged as per Supreme Court judgment at yearly intervals and payment should coincide with the harvest ing of crops. \nAccordingly, such advances will be treated as NPA only if instalments of principal and / or interest become \noverdue after due date.  \n2.2.9  Recognition of Income on Investment Treated as NPAs  \nThe investments are also subject to the prudential norms on income recognition. Banks should not book \nincome on accrual basis in respect of any security , irrespective of the category in which it is included, where \nthe interest / principal is in arrears for more than 90 days.  \n2.2.10 NPA Reporting to Reserve Bank \nBanks should report the figures of NPAs to the Regional Office of the Reserve Bank at the end of each year \nwithin two months from the close of the year in the prescribed proforma given in the Annex 2\n. \n3. Asset Classification  \n3.1 Classification  \n3.1.1 Banks should classify their assets into the following broad groups, viz. - \n(i) Standard Assets  \n(ii) Sub -standard Assets   \n(iii) Doubtful Assets  \n(iv) Loss Assets  \n3.2 Definitions  \n3.2.1  Standard Assets  \nStandard asset is one which does  not disclose any problems and which does not carry more than normal \nrisk attached to the business. Such an asset should not be an NPA.  \n3.2.2  Sub-standard Assets  \nWith effect from March 31, 2005 an asset would be classified as sub- standard if it remained NP A for a \nperiod less than or equal to 12 months. In such cases, the current net worth of the borrowers / guarantors \nor the current market value of the security charged is not enough to ensure recovery of the dues to the \nbanks in full. In other words, such a ssets will have well defined credit weaknesses that jeopardise the \nliquidation of the debt and are characterised by the distinct possibility that the banks will sustain some loss, \nif deficiencies are not corrected.  \n3.2.3  Doubtful Assets  \nWith effect from Ma rch 31, 2005, an asset is required to be classified as doubtful, if it has remained NPA \nfor more than 12 months. A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent as that classified \nas sub -standard, with the added characteristic that the weakne sses make collection or liquidation in full, on \nthe basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.  \n3.2.4  Loss Assets  \nA loss asset is one where loss has been identified by the bank or internal or external auditors  or by the Co-\noperation Department or by the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s  inspection but the amount has not been written off, \nwholly or partly. In other words, such an asset is considered un -collectible and of such little value that its \ncontinuance as a bankabl e asset is not warranted although there may be some salvage or recovery value.  \n3.3 Guidelines for Classification of Assets  \n3.3.1  Basic Considerations  \n(i) Broadly speaking, classification of assets into above categories should be done taking into account the \ndegree of well defined credit weaknesses .  \n(ii) In respect of accounts where there are potential threats to recovery on account of erosion in the value \nof security, it will not be prudent for the banks to classify them first as sub -standard and then as d oubtful \nafter expiry of 12 months from the date the account has become NPA. Such accounts should be straight \naway classified as doubtful asset or loss asset, as appropriate, irrespective of the period for which they \nhave remained as NPA.  \n3.3.2  Advances Granted under Rehabilitation Packages Approved by Term Lending Institutions  \n(i) Banks are not permitted to upgrade the classification of any advance in respect of which the terms have \nbeen re -negotiated unless the package of re- negotiated terms has worked sat isfactorily for a period of one \nyear. While the existing credit facilities sanctioned to a unit under rehabilitation packages approved by term \nlending institutions will continue to be classified as sub- standard or doubtful , as the case may be,  in respect \nof additional facilities sanctioned under the rehabilitation packages , the income recognition and asset \nclassification norms will become applicable after a period of one year from the date of disbursement.   \n(ii) A similar relaxation be made in respect of SS I units which are identified as sick by banks themselves \nand where rehabilitation packages / nursing programmes have been drawn by the banks themselves or \nunder consortium arrangements.  \n3.3.3  Internal System for Classification of Assets as NPA  \n(i) Banks ma y adhere to the timelines for implementation of system -based asset classification mentioned \nat paragraph 2.1.4 above.  \n(ii) Banks , which are not required to implement system -based asset classification  in terms of the instructions \nat paragraph 2.1.4,  should establish appropriate internal systems to eliminate the tendency to delay or \npostpone the identification of NPAs, especially in respect of high value accounts. The banks may fix a \nminimum cut -off point to decide what would constitute a high value account depending upon their respective \nbusiness levels. The cut -off point should be valid for the entire accounting year.  \n(iii) Responsibility and validation levels for ensuring proper asset classification may be fixed by the bank.  \n(iv) The system should ensure that doubts in asset classification due to any reason are settled through \nspecified internal channels within one month from the date on which the account would have been classified as NPA as per extant guidelines.  \n(v) Banks should ensure scrupulous complianc e with the instructions for recognition of credit impairment \nand view aberrations by dealing officials seriously.  \n(vi) RBI would continue to identify the divergences arising due to non- compliance, for fixing accountability. \nWhere there is wilful non -compli ance by the official responsible for classification and is well documented, \nRBI would initiate deterrent action including imposition of monetary penalties.  \n4. Income Recognition  \n4.1 Income Recognition - Policy  \n4.1.1 The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of recovery. Income \nfrom non -performing assets (NPA) is not recognised on accrual basis but is booked as income only when \nit is actually received. Therefore, banks should not take interest on non- performing assets to their income \naccount on accrual basis.  \n4.1.2 However, interest on advances against term deposits, NSCs, KVPs and Life policies may be taken to \nincome account on the due date, provided adequate margin is available in the accounts.  \n4.1.3 Fees and commissions e arned by the banks as a result of re- negotiations or rescheduling of \noutstanding debts should be recognised on an accrual basis over the period of time covered by the re-\nnegotiated or rescheduled extension of credit.  \n4.1.4 If Government guaranteed advances  remain 'overdue' for more than 90 days , the interest on such \nadvances should not be taken to income account unless the interest has been realised.  This shall be \napplicable in cases of both Central and State Government guaranteed accounts . \n4.2 Reversal of Income on Accounts Becoming NPAs  \n4.2.1 If any advance,  including bills purchased and discounted , becomes NPA, interest accrued and \ncredited to income account, should be reversed or provided for , if the same is not realised This will also \napply to Government guaranteed accounts  which remain overdue for more than 90 days . \n  \n4.2.2 In respect of NPAs, fees, commission and similar income that have accrued should cease to accrue \nin the current period and should be reversed with respect to past periods, if uncollected.  \n4.2.3 Banks undertaking equipment leasing should follow prudential accounting standards. Lease rentals \ncomprises of two elements - a finance charge (i.e. interest charge) and a charge towards recovery of the \ncost of the asset. The interest component alone should be taken to income account. Such interest \ncomponent  taken to income account, before the asset became NPA, if unrealised should be reversed or \nprovided for.  \n4.3 Booking of Income on Investments in Shares & Bonds  \n4.3.1 As a prudent practice and in order to bring about uniform accounting practice among banks for booking \nof income on units of UTI and equity of All India Financial Institutions, such income should be booked on \ncash basis and not on accrual basis.  \n4.3.2 However, in respect of income f rom Government securities / bonds of public sector undertakings and \nAll India Financial Institutions, where interest rates on the instruments are predetermined, income may be \nbooked on accrual basis, provided interest is serviced regularly and is not in ar rears.  \n4.4 Partial Recovery of NPAs  \nInterest realised on NPAs may be taken to income account , provided the credits in the accounts towards \ninterest are not out of fresh / additional credit facilities sanctioned to the borrower concerned.  \n4.5 Interest Appli cation  \n4.5.1 In case of NPAs , as a prudential norm, there is no use in debiting the said account by interest accrued \nin subsequent months  and taking this accrued interest amount as income of the bank as the said interest \nis not being received. It is simult aneously desirable to show such accrued interest separately or park in a \nseparate account so that interest receivable on such NPA account is computed and shown as such, though not accounted as income of the bank for the period.  \n4.5.2 The interest accrued i n respect of performing assets may be taken to income account as the interest \nis reasonably expected to be received. However, if interest is not actually received for any reason in these \ncases and the account is to be treated as an NPA, then the amount of interest so taken to income should \nbe reversed or should be provided for in full.  \n4.5.3 With a view to ensuring uniformity in accounting the accrued interest in respect of both the performing \nand non -performing assets, the following guidelines may be adopt ed notwithstanding the existing provisions \nin the respective S tate Co -operative Societies Act.  \n(i) Interest accrued in respect of non- performing advances should not be debited to borrowal accounts but \nshown separately under 'Interest Receivable Account' on the 'Property and Assets' side of the balance \nsheet and corresponding amount shown under 'Overdue Interest Reserve Account' on the 'Capital and Liabilities' side of the balance sheet.  \n(ii) In respect of borrowal accounts, which are treated as performing a ssets, accrued interest can \nalternatively be debited to the borrowal account and credited to Interest account and taken to income \naccount. In case the accrued interest in respect of the borrowal account is not actually realised and the \naccount has become N PA, interest accrued and credited to income account should be reversed or provided \nfor. \n(iii) The illustrative accounting entries to be passed in respect of accrued interest on both the performing \nand non- performing advances are indicated in the Annex 3\n.  \n4.5.4 In the above context, it may be clarified that overdue interest reserve is not created out of the real or \nearned income received by the bank and as such, the amounts held in the Overdue Interest Reserve \nAccount cannot be regarded as 'reserve' or a part of the owned funds of the banks. It will also be observed \nthat the Balance Sheet format prescribed under the Third Schedule to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \n(As Applicable to Co- operative Societies) specifically requires the banks to show 'Overdue Interest Reserve' \nas a distinct item on the 'Capital and Liabilities' side vide item 8 thereof.  \n5. Provisioning Norms  \n5.1 Norms for Provisioning on Loans & Advances  \n5.1.1 In conformity with the prudential norms, provisions should be made on the non- performing assets on \nthe basis of classification of assets into prescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 above.  \n5.1.2 Taking into account the time lag between an account becoming doubtful of recovery, its recognition \nas such, the realisation of the security and the erosion over time in the value of security charged to the \nbank, the banks should make provision against loss assets, doubtful assets and sub -standard assets as \nbelow:  \n(i) Loss Assets \nThe entire assets should be written off after obtaining necessary approval from the competent authority and \nas per the provisions of the Co- operative Societies Act / Rules. If the assets are permitted to remain in the \nbooks for any reason, 100 per cent of the outstanding should be provided for.  \n (ii) Doubtful Assets  \n(a) Provision should be 100 per cent of the extent to which the advance is not covered by the realisable \nvalue of the security to which the bank has a valid recourse. The realisable value should be estimated on \na realistic basis.  \n(b) In regard to the secured portion, provision may be made on the following basis, at the rates ranging \nfrom 20 per cent to 100 per cent of the secured portion depending upon the period for which the asset has remained doubtful:  \nTier I4 and Tier II5 Banks  \nPeriod for which the advance has remained in \n'doubtful' category  Provision \nRequirement  \nUp to one year  20 per cent  \nOne to three years  30 per cent  \nAdvances classified as 'doubtful for more than \nthree years' on or after April 1, 2010  100 percent  \n \n                                                            \n4 (i) Banks having deposits below \u20b9 100 crore, operating in a single district.  \nii) Banks with deposits below \u20b9 100 crore operating in more than one district, pro vided the branches are in contiguous districts \nand deposits and advances of branches in one district separately constitute at least 95% of the total deposits and advances \nrespectively of the bank.  \niii) Banks with deposits below \u20b9 100 crore, whose branches  were originally in a single district but subsequently, became multi -\ndistrict due to reorganization of the district.  \nThe deposits and advances as referred to in the definition may be reckoned as on 31st March of the immediate preceding financ ial \nyear. \n5 Banks not qualifying as Tier I   \n(iii) Sub-standard Assets  \nA general provision of 10 per cent on total outstanding should be made without making any allowance for \nECGC guarantee cover and securities available.  \n(iv) Provision on Standard Assets  \n(a) Tier -I banks should make a general provision of a minimum of 0.25 per cent on standard assets.  \n(b) Tier II banks shall maintain a general provision of minimum 0.40 per cent  for 'standard advances'. \nHowever, direct advances to agricultural and SME sectors which are standard assets, would attract a uniform provisioning requirement of 0.25 per cent of the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis, as hitherto.  \n(c) Both Tier I & Tier II  banks shall maintain a minimum provision of 1.00 percent in respect of advances to \nCommercial Real Estate Sector classified as 'standard assets'.  \n(d) Both Tier I and Tier II banks UCBs shall maintain a minimum provision of 0.75 percent in respect of \nadvances to Commercial Real Estate -Residential Housing (CRE -RH)\n6 Sector classified as 'standard \nassets'.   \n(e) The standard asset provisioning requirements for all UCBs are summarized as under:  \nCategory of Standard Asset  Rate of Provisioning  \nTier II  Tier I  \nDirect advances to Agriculture \nand SME sectors  0.25% 0.25%  \nCommercial Real Estate (CRE) \nsector  1.00% 1.00% \nCommercial Real E state -\nResidential Housing Sector \n(CRE -RH) 0.75%  0.75%  \nAll other loans and advances not \nincluded above  0.40%  0.25%  \n(f) The provisions towards \"standard assets\" need not be netted from gross advances but shown separately \nas \"Contingent Provision against St andard Assets\" under \"Other Funds and Reserves\" {item.2 (viii) of \nCapital and Liabilities} in the Balance Sheet.  \n(g) In case banks are already maintaining excess provision than what is required / prescribed by Statutory \nAuditor / RBI Inspection for impaired credits under Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve, additional provision \nrequired for Standard Assets may be segregated from Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve and the same may \nbe parked under the head \"Contingent Provisions against Standard Assets\" with the approval of their Board \nof Directors. Shortfall if any, on this account may be made good in the normal course.  \n(h) The above contingent provision will be eligible for inclusion in Tier II capital.  \n                                                            \n6 CRE-RH would consist of loans to builders/developers for residential housing projects (except for captive \nconsumption) under CRE segment. Such projects should ordinarily not include non- residential commercial real \nestate. However, integrated housing projects comprising some commercial space (e.g. shopping complex, school, \netc.) can also be classified under CRE -RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project does \nnot exceed 10% of the total Floor Space  Index (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the \npredominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10%, the project loans should be classified as CRE \nand not CRE -RH.  \n(v) Higher Provisions  \nThere is no objection if the banks create bad and doubtful debts reserve beyond the specified limits on their \nown or if provided in the respective State Co- operative Societies Acts.  \n5.2 Provisioning for Retirement Benefits  \nBanks may have retirement benefit schemes for their staff, viz. Provident Fund, Gratuity and Pension. It is \nnecessary that such liabilities are estimated on actuarial basis and full provision should be made every year \nfor the purpose in their Profit and Loss Account.  \n5.3 Provisioning Pertaining to Fraud Accounts  \nWith effect from M ay 14, 2015, provisioning norm in respect of all cases of fraud identified in terms of the \nMaster Circular on Frauds - Classification and Reporting, as updated from time to time,  are as under:  \n5.3.1 The entire amount due to the bank  (irrespective of quantu m of security held against such assets), or \nfor which the bank is liable (including in case of deposit accounts), is to be provided for over a period not exceeding four quarters commencing with the quarter in which the fraud has been detected;  \n5.3.2 Howeve r, where there has been delay  beyond the prescribed period, in reporting the fraud to Reserve \nBank, the entire provisioning is required to be made at once. In addition, Reserve Bank of India may also \ninitiate appropriate supervisory action where there has been delay by the bank in reporting a fraud or \nprovisioning there against.   \n5.4 Guidelines for Provisions in Specific Cases  \n(i) State Government guaranteed Advances  \nFrom the year ended March 31, 2006, State Government guaranteed advance and investment in S tate \nGovernment guaranteed securities would attract extant provisioning norms  on the basis of classification of \nassets into prescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 above.  \n(ii) Advances granted under Rehabilitation Packages approved by Term Lending Institutions  \n(a) The existing credit facilities sanctioned to a unit under rehabilitation package approved by term lending institutions, should continue to be classified as sub- standard or doubtful asset as the case \nmay be.  \n(b) However, the additional fac ilities sanctioned as per package finalised by term lending \ninstitutions, the income recognition and asset classification norms will become applicable after a period of one year from the date of disbursement.  \n(c) In respect of additional credit facilities granted to SSI units which are identified as sick and \nwhere rehabilitation packages / nursing programmes have been drawn by the banks themselves \nor under consortium arrangements, no provision need be made for a period of one year.  \n(iii) Advances against fi xed / term deposit, NSCs eligible for surrender, KVPs, and life policies are exempted \nfrom provisioning requirements.  \n(iv) Advances against gold ornaments, government securities and all other kinds of securities are not \nexempted from provisioning requirements.  \n  \n(v) Advances covered by ECGC Guarantee  \n(a) In the case of doubtful assets which are guaranteed by ECGC, provision should be made only \nfor the balance in excess of the amount guaranteed by the Corporation. Further, while arriving at \nthe provisioning  required, realisable value of the securities should first be deducted from the \noutstanding balance in respect of the amount guaranteed by the Corporation and then provision \nmade as illustrated hereunder:  \nExample  \nOutstanding Balance  \u20b94 lakhs  \nECGC Cover  50 per cent  \nPeriod for which the advance \nhas remained doubtful  More than 3 years  \nValue of security held (excludes \nworth of borrower / guarantor)  \u20b91.50 lakhs  \n \nProvision required to be made  \nOutstanding balance  \u20b94.00 lakhs  \nLess : Value of security held  \u20b91.50 lakhs  \nUnrealised balance  \u20b92.50 lakhs  \nLess : ECGC Cover (50% of \nunrealisable balance)  \u20b91.25 lakhs  \nNet unsecured balance  \u20b91.25 lakhs  \nProvision for unsecured portion \nof advance  \u20b91.25 lakhs (@ 100 per cent of \nunsecured portion)  \nProvision for secured po rtion of \nadvance (as on March 31 2005)  \u20b90.90 lakhs (@ 60 per cent of \nsecured portion of \u20b91.50 lakh).  \nTotal provision required to be \nmade  \u20b92.15 lakhs (as on March 31, \n2005).  \n(b) Banks have the option of following more stringent method of provisioning in r espect of advances \ncovered by the guarantees of ECGC as compared to the method given above.  \n(vi) Advances covered by Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH)  \nIn case the advance covered by CRGFTLIH guarantee becomes non- performing , no provisions need to be \nmade towards the guaranteed portion of the housing loan. The amount outstanding in excess of the \nguaranteed portion should be provided for as per the extant guidelines on provisioning for non -performing \nadvances.  \n(vii) Interbank exposure of Primary (Urban) Co- operative Banks (UCBs) under All Inclusive \nDirections  \na) The interbank exposures arising from deposits placed by UCBs with a UCB under AID and their \nnon-performing exposures arising from discounted bills drawn under LCs issued by a UCB under \nAID shall be fully provided within five years at the rate of 20% annually. Further, the interest receivable on the deposits shall not be recognised as income by the UCBs.  \nb) If the UCBs choose to convert such deposits into long term perpetual debt instruments (e.g. \nInnovative Perpetual Debt Instrument - IPDI) which may be recognised as capital instrument under \na scheme of restructuring/ revival of a UCB under AID, provision on the portion of deposits \nconverted into such instruments shall not be r equired.  \n  \n 6. Transfer of Loan Exposures  \nThe asset classification and provisioning requirements in respect of transactions involving transfer of loans \nshall be as per the Reserve Bank of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021\n. \n7.

Accrued Interest on Performing Advances  \ni) It has been clarified in paragraph 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 (ii) of the Master Circular that accrued interest in res pect \nof performing advances may be charged to borrowal accounts and taken to income account. Illustratively, \nif the accrued interest is \u20b910,000/ - in respect of performing advances of a borrower 'X' (cash credit, \noverdraft, loan account, etc.) the following entries can be passed in the Books of Account.  \n(Dr) Borrower's account (CC, OD loan)  \u20b910,000.00  \n(Cr) Interest account  \u20b910,000.00  \nii) In case the accrued interest of \u20b910,000/ - in respect of the borrowal account is not actually realised and \nthe account has become NPA, interest accrued and credited to income account should be reversed or \nprovided for if the same is not realised by passing the following entries :  \n(Dr) P&La/c)  \u20b910,000.00  \n(Cr) Overdue Interest Reserve Account  \u20b910,000.00  \niii) In case accrued interest is realised subsequently, the following entries may be passed:  \n(Dr) Cash / Bank account  \u20b910,000.00  \n(Cr) Borrower's Account (CC, OD, Loan)  \u20b910,000.00  \n(Dr) Overdue Interest Reserve Account  \u20b910,000.00  \n(Cr) Interest account  \u20b910,000.00  \nII. Accrued Interest on Non- Performing Advances  \ni) Accrued interest in respect of non -performing advances may be debited to 'Interest Receivable Account' \nand corresponding amount credited to 'Overdue Interest Reserve Account'. For example, if the interest \naccrued in r espect of Cash Credit / OD / Loan etc . account of a borrower 'Y' is \u20b920,000/ - the accounting \nentries may be passed as under :  \n(Dr) Interest Receivable Account  \u20b920,000.00  \n(Cr) Overdue Interest Reserve Account  \u20b920,000.00  \nii) Subsequently, if interest is actually realised, the following accounting entries may be passed :  \n(Dr) Cash / Bank Account  \u20b920,000.00  \n(Cr) Interest account  \u20b920,000.00  \n(Dr) Overdue Interest Reserve Account  \u20b920,000.00  \n(Cr) Interest Receivable Account  \u20b920,000.00  \n \n \n   \n III. Accounting of Overdue Interest in Loan Ledgers & Balanc e Sheet  \ni) With a view to facilitating the banks to work out the amount of interest receivable in respect of each non-\nperforming borrowal account, banks can consider opening a separate column in the individual ledger \naccounts of such borrowers and interest  receivable shown therein. This would enable the banks to \ndetermine at a particular point of time, the amount of interest actually to be recovered from the borrowers. \nTotal of the amounts shown under the separate columns in the loan ledgers would be intere st receivable in \nrespect of non- performing advances and it would get reflected as such on the 'assets' side of balance sheet \nwith a corresponding item on the liabilities side of the balance sheet as 'Overdue Interest Reserve'.  \nii) Similarly, a separate col umn should be provided in the loan ledger in respect of performing advances for \nshowing accrued interest taken to income account . If the accrued interest is not realised and the account \nbecomes NPA, the amount has to be reversed or provided for . \n \n             \n      \n \nAnnex 4  \n(Clarification on certain frequently asked questions)  \n(vide para 7) \n1. Whether a working capital account will become an NPA if the stock statements are not submitted \nregularly? What should be the period for which the stock statements ca n be in arrears before the \naccount is treated as an NPA?  \nBanks should ensure that drawings in the working capital accounts are covered by the adequacy of current assets, since current assets are first appropriated in times of distress. Considering the prac tical difficulties \nof large borrowers, stock statements relied upon by the banks for determining drawing power should not be older than three months. The outstanding in the account based on drawing power calculated from stock statements older than three months would be deemed as irregular. A working capital borrowal account will \nbecome NPA if such irregular drawings are permitted in the account for a continuous period of 90 days .  \n2. Whether an account will become an NPA if the review / renewal of regular /  ad-hoc credit limits \nare not done when due? What should be periodicity of review / renewal to decide the present status of an account?  \nBanks shall adhere to the instructions contained in the \nMaster Circular for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) \non Management of Advances \u2013  UCBs dated July 1, 2015 , as updated from time to time, regarding the \nrequirement of policy for periodic review of the working capital limits. Further, banks shall also adhere to the instructions issued vide \ncircular DoS.CO.PPG.BC.1/11.01.005/2020 -21 dated August 21, 2020  on \u2018Ad-\nhoc/Short Review/Renewal of Credit Facilities\u2019, inc uding inter alia  the requirement of  a detailed Board \napproved policy on methodology and periodicity for review/renewal of credit facilities within the overall regulatory guidelines and strict adherence to the same. An account where the regular / ad- hoc cr edit limits \nhave not been reviewed or have not been renewed within 90 days from the due date / date of ad- hoc \nsanction will be treated as NPA. In case of constraints such as non- availability of financial statements and \nother data from the borrowers, the br anch should furnish evidence to show that renewal / review of credit \nlimits is already on and would be completed soon.  \n3. Regularisation of the account around the date of balance sheet - Whether it will be in order to \ntreat a borrowal account as 'standard ', if it has been irregular for a major part of the year, but has \nbeen regularised near the balance sheet date?  \nThe asset classification of borrowal accounts where a solitary or a few credits are recorded before the \nbalance sheet date should be handled wit h care and without scope for subjectivity. Where the account \nindicates inherent weakness on the basis of the data available, the account should be deemed as a NPA. \nIn other genuine cases, the banks must furnish satisfactory evidence to the Statutory Auditors / Inspecting \nOfficers about the manner of regularisation of the account to eliminate doubts on their performing status.  \n4. Classification of NPAs where there is a threat to recovery  \nHow should the instructions on classification of NPAs straightaway as doubtful or a loss asset be interpreted and what can be termed as a 'significant credit impairment'?  \nAn NPA need not go through the various stages of classification in case of serious credit impairment and \nsuch assets should be straightway classified as a d oubtful / loss asset as appropriate. Erosion in the value \nof security can be reckoned as significant when the realizable value of the security is less than 50 per cent \nof the value assessed by the bank or accepted by RBI at the time of last inspection, as the case may be. \nSuch NPAs may be straightaway classified under doubtful category and provisioning should be made as \napplicable to doubtful assets.    \n \n5. Classification of credit facilities under consortium  \nIn certain cases of consortium accounts, though t he record of recovery in the account with a \nmember bank may suggest that the account is a NPA, the banks submit that, at times, the borrower \nhas deposited adequate funds with the consortium leader / member of the consortium and the \nbank's share is due for receipt. In such cases, will it be in order for the member bank to classify the \naccount as 'standard' in its books?  \nAsset classification of accounts under consortium should be based on the record of recovery of the \nindividual member banks and other aspects  having a bearing on the recoverability of the advances. Where \nthe remittances by the borrower under consortium lending arrangements are pooled with one bank and / or where the bank receiving remittances is not parting with the share of other member banks,  the account will \nbe treated as not serviced in the books of the other member banks, and therefore, be treated as NPA. The \nbanks participating in the consortium should, therefore, arrange to get their share of recovery transferred \nfrom the lead bank or get  an express consent from the lead bank for the transfer of their share of recovery, \nto ensure proper asset classification in their respective books.  \n6. Appropriation of recoveries -  What is the practice to be adopted by banks regarding appropriation \nof rec overies in NPA accounts?  \nIn the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the borrower for the purpose of appropriation \nof recoveries in NPAs (i.e. towards Principal or interest due) banks should adopt an accounting principle \nand exercise the right  of appropriation of recoveries in a uniform and consistent manner.  \n7. Overdues in other credit facilities -  There are instances where banks park the dues from a \nborrower in respect of devolved letters of credit and invoked guarantees in a separate account , \nirrespective of whether the borrower's credit facilities are regular or not. How to determine when the account in which such dues are parked has become an NPA?  \nA number of banks adopt the practice of parking the dues of the borrower in respect of devolved letters of \ncredit and invoked guarantees in a separate account which is not a regular sanctioned facility. As a result \nthese are not reflected in the principal operating account of the borrower. This renders application of the \nprudential norms for identi fication of NPAs difficult. It is, therefore, advised that if the debts arising out of \ndevolvement of letters of credit or invoked guarantees are parked in a separate account, the balance \noutstanding in that account also should be treated as a part of the borrower's principal operating account \nfor the purpose of application of prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning.  \n8. Treatment of loss assets - An NPA account will be classified as a loss asset only when there is \nno se curity in the account or where there is considerable erosion in the realisable value of the \nsecurity in the account. What can be termed as a 'considerable' erosion for the account to be classified as a loss asset?  \nIf the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank / approved valuers / RBI is less than 10 per \ncent of the outstanding in the borrowal accounts, the existence of security should be ignored and the asset should be straightaway classified as loss asset. It may be either written off af ter obtaining necessary \npermission from the competent authority as per the Co- operative Societies Act / Rules, or fully provided for \nby the bank.  \n \n  \n 9. Valuation of Security -  A major source of divergence in provisioning requirement was the \nrealisable val ue of the primary and collateral security. Can uniform guidelines be prescribed for \nadoption in this area, at least for large value accounts?  \nWith a view to bringing down divergence arising out of difference in assessment of the value of security it \nhas been decided that in cases of NPAs with balance of \u20b910 lakh and above :  \na) The current assets and their valuation are looked into at the time of Statutory Audit / Concurrent audit. However, in order to enhance the reliability on stock valuations, stock audit  at annual intervals by external \nagencies could be considered in case of larger advances. The cut off limit and the names of the external agencies may be finalised by the Board.  \nb) Collaterals such as immovable properties charged in favour of the bank shou ld be got valued once in \nthree years by valuers appointed as per the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.  \n \n             \n     \n \n \nAnnex 5  \nPrudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances  \nKey Concepts  \ni) Advances The term 'Advances' will mean all k inds of credit facilities including cash credit, overdrafts, term loans, bills \ndiscounted / purchased, receivables, etc. and investments other than that in the nature of equity.  \nii) Fully Secured  \nWhen the amounts due to a bank (present value of principal a nd interest receivable as per restructured \nloan terms) are fully covered by the value of security, duly charged in its favour in respect of those dues, \nthe bank's dues are considered to be fully secured. While assessing the realisable value of security, pr imary \nas well as collateral securities would be reckoned, provided such securities are tangible securities and are \nnot in intangible form like guarantee etc., of the promoter / others. However, for this purpose the bank \nguarantees, State Government Guarant ees and Central Government Guarantees will be treated on par \nwith tangible security.  \niii) Restructured Accounts  \nA restructured account is one where the bank, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's \nfinancial difficulty, grants to the borrower concessions that the bank would not otherwise consider. \nRestructuring would normally involve modification of terms of the advances / securities, which would \ngenerally include, among others, alteration of repayment period / repayable amount / the amount  of \ninstalments / rate of interest (due to reasons other than competitive reasons).  \niv) Repeatedly Restructured Accounts \nWhen a bank restructures an account a second (or more) time(s), the account will be considered as a \n'repeatedly restructured account'. However, if the second restructuring takes place after the period up to \nwhich the concessions were extended under the terms of the first restructuring, that account shall not be \nreckoned as a 'repeatedly restructured account'.  \nv) SMEs  \nSmall and Medium Enterprises as defined in terms of the \ncircular FIDD.MSME & \nNFS.BC.No.4/06.02.31/2020 -21 dated August 21, 2020  on \u2018New Definition of Micro, Small and Medium \nEnterprises \u2013 clarifications\u2019, as updated from time to time.  \nvi) Specified Period  \nSpecified Period means a period of one year from the date when the first payment of interest or installment \nof principal falls due under the terms of restructuring package.  \n \n  \n vii) Satisfacto ry Performance  \nSatisfactory performance during the specified period means adherence to the following conditions during \nthat period.  \nNon-Agricultural Cash Credit Accounts  \nIn the case of non- agricultural cash credit accounts, the account should not be out of  order any time during \nthe specified period. In addition, there should not be any overdues at the end of the specified period.  \nNon-Agricultural Term Loan Accounts  \nIn the case of non- agricultural term loan accounts, no payment should remain overdue for a period of more \nthan 90 days. In addition there should not be any overdues at the end of the specified period.  \nAll Agricultural Accounts  \nIn the case of agricultural accounts, at the end of the specified period the account should be regular.  \n \n \n \n          \n    \n \nAnnex 6  \n(vide para 2.2.7.29)  \nPrudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances  \nParticulars of Accounts Restructured  \n(\u20b9 in lakh)  \n  Housing \nLoans  SME Debt \nRestructuring  Others  \nStandard \nadvances \nrestructured  No. of Borrowers        \nAmount \noutstanding        \nSacrifice \n(diminution in the \nfair value)        \nSub standard \nadvances restructured  No. of Borrowers        \nAmount \noutstanding        \nSacrifice \n(diminution in the \nfair value)        \nDoubtful \nadvances restructured  No. of Borrowers        \nAmount \noutstanding        \nSacrifice \n(diminution in the \nfair value)        \nTotal  No. of Borrowers        \nAmount \noutstanding        \nSacrifice \n(diminution in the \nfair value)        \nApplication for \nrestructuring \nwhich are under \nprocess,  package \nnot approved  No. of bor rowers     \nAmount \noutstanding     \n \n     \n \n  \nAnnex 7  \n(vide para 2.2.7.3 0) \nPrudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances  \nAsset Classification of Restructured Accounts under the Guidelines  \nParticulars  Case 1  Case 2  Case 3  Case 4  \nI.

Project Loans for Infrastructure Sector  \n1.1 A loan for an infrastructure project will be classified as NPA during any time before commencement  of \ncommercial operations as per record of recovery (90 days overdue), unless it is restructured and becomes \neligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras.1.3 and 1.4 below.  \n1.2 A loan for an infrastructure project will be classified as  NPA if it fails to commence commercial \noperations within two years from the original DCCO, even if it is regular as per record of recovery, unless it \nis restructured and becomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras 1.3 and 1.4  \nbelow . \n1.3 There may be occasions when completion of projects is delayed for legal and other extraneous reasons \nlike delays in Government approvals etc. All these factors, which are beyond the control of the promoters, may lead to delay in project implementation and involve restructuring / rescheduling of loans by banks. If a \nproject loan classified as 'standard asset' is restructured any time during the period up to two years from \nthe original date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO), in accor dance with prudential \nguidelines on restructuring of advances  at paragraph 2.2.7 above, it can be retained as a standard asset if \nthe fresh DCCO is fixed within the following limits, and further provided the account continues to be serviced as per the rest ructured terms:  \na) Infrastructure Projects involving Court Cases  \nUp to another 2 years (beyond the existing extended period of 2 years i.e total extension of 4 years), in case the reason for extension of date of commencement of production is arbitration pr oceedings or a court \ncase.  \nb) Infrastructure Projects delayed for other reasons beyond the Control of Promoters  \nUp to another 1 year (beyond the existing extended period of 2 years i.e. total extension of 3 years), in other than court cases.  \n1.4 The dispensation in para 1.3 is subject to the condition that the application for restructuring should be \nreceived before the expiry of period of two years from the original DCCO and when the account is still standard as per record of recovery. The other conditions applicable would be:  \ni. In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest, banks should not book income on accrual \nbasis beyond two years from the original DCCO, considering the high risk involved in such restructured \naccounts.  \n                                                            \n7 For greenfield projects, financial closure is defined as a legally binding commitment of equity holders and debt financiers t o \nprovide or mobilise funding for the project. Such funding must account for a significant part of the project cost which shoul d \nnot be less than 90 per cent of the total project cost securing the construction of the facility.   \n ii. Banks should maintain provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets \nas under:  \nUntil two years from the original DCCO  0.40%  \nDuring the third and the fourth years after the original DCCO.  1.00%  \nFor the purpose of these guidelines, mere extension of DCCO will also be treated as restructuring even if \nall other terms and conditions remain the same.  \n2. Project Loans for Non -Infrastructure Sector  \n2.1 A loan for a non- infrastructure project will be classified as NPA during any time before comm encement \nof commercial operations as per record of recovery (90 days overdue), unless it is restructured and \nbecomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras 2.3 and 2.4 below.  \n2.2 A loan for a non -infrastructure project will be cl assified as NPA if it fails to commence commercial \noperations within six months from the original DCCO, even if it is regular as per record of recovery, unless it is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras  2.3 and 2.4 \nbelow.  \n2.3 In case of non- infrastructure projects, if the delay in commencement of commercial operations extends \nbeyond the period of six months from the date of completion as determined at the time of financial closure, banks can prescribe a fresh DCCO, and retain the \"standard\" classification by undertaking restructuring of \naccounts in accordance with prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances at paragraph 2.2.7 above, \nprovided the fresh DCCO does not extend beyond a period of twelve m onths from the original DCCO. This  \nwould among others also imply that the restructuring application is received before the expiry of six months \nfrom the original DCCO, and when the account is still \"standard\" as per the record of recovery.  \nThe other condit ions applicable would be:  \na) In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest, banks should not book income on accrual basis beyond six months from the original DCCO, considering the high risk involved in such restructured \naccounts.  \nb) Banks should maintain provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets \nas under:  \nUntil the first six months from the original DCCO  0.40%  \nDuring the next six months  1.00%  \n2.4 For this purpose, mere extension of DCCO will also be treate d as restructuring even if all other terms \nand conditions remain the same.  \n3. These guidelines will however not be applicable to restructuring of commercial real estate and housing loans.  \n \n   \n 4. Other Issues  \n4.1 All other aspects of restructuring of project  loans before commencement of commercial operations \nwould be governed by the instructions on restructuring of advances as contained in this Master Circular . \n4.2 Any change in the repayment schedule of a project loan caused due to an increase in the project  outlay \non account of increase in scope and size of the project, would not be treated as restructuring if:  \ni) The increase in scope and size of the project takes place before commencement of commercial \noperations of the existing project.  \nii) The rise in co st excluding any cost -overrun in respect of the original project is 25% or more of the original \noutlay.  \niii) The bank re- assesses the viability of the project before approving the enhancement of scope and fixing \na fresh DCCP.  \niv) On re -rating, (if already rated) the new rating is not below the previous rating by more than one notch.  \nDefinition of 'Infrastructure Lending'  \nAny credit facility in whatever form extended by lenders (i.e. banks, FIs or NBFCs) to an infrastructure facility as specified below falls  within the definition of \"infrastructure lending\". In other words, a credit facility \nprovided to a borrower company engaged in developing or operating and maintaining, or developing, operating and maintaining any infrastructure facility that is a project in any of the following sectors, or any \ninfrastructure facility of a similar nature  \na road, including toll road, a bridge or a rail system; a highway project including other activities being an \nintegral part of the highway project; a port, airport, inland waterway or inland port; a water supply project, \nirrigation project, water treatment system, sanitation and sewerage system or solid waste management \nsystem; telecommunication services whether basic or cellular, including radio paging, domestic satellite \nservice (i.e., a satellite owned and operated by an Indian company for providing telecommunication \nservice), network of trunking, broadband network and internet services; An industrial park or Special \nEconomic Zone generation or generation and distribution of power; transmission or distribution of power by \nlaying a network of new transmission or distribution lines; construction relating to projects involving agro -\nprocessing and supply of inputs to agriculture; construction for preservation and storage of processed agro -\nproducts, perishable goods such as fruits, vegetables and flowers including testing facilities for quality ; \nconstruction of educational institutions and hospitals; laying down and / or maintenance of gas, crude oil \nand petroleum pipelines, any  other infrastructure facility of similar nature.  \n \n      \n \nAnnex 9  \nA.

This Direction has been issued by RBI in exercise of its powers conferred under \nSection 35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 and in exercise of all the powers \nenabling it in this behalf.  \nYours faithfully,  \n \n(Usha Janakiraman)  \nChief  General Manager  \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n  \nRBI/DOR/2021 -22/              October 26, 2021  \nDOR.CAP.REC.No. 61 /21.01.002/2021 -22 \n \nReserve Bank of India - Prudentia l Norms on Capital Adequacy for  \nLocal Area Banks, Directions, 2021  \nIn exercise of the powers conferred by Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, \n1949, the Reserve Bank of India , being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in \nthe public interest so to do , hereby, issues the Directions hereinafter specified.  \nCHAPTER \u2013 I \nPRELIMINARY  \n1. Short Title and Commencement.  \n(a) These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Norms \non Capital Adequacy for Local Area Banks) Directions, 2021.  \n(b) These directions shall come into effect from October 26, 2021.  \n2. Applicability  \nThe provisions of these Directions shall apply to all Local Area Banks, licensed to \noperate in India by the Reserve Bank of India.  \n3. Purpose  \nThis Master Direction covers instructions regarding the components of capital and the \ncapital required to be prov ided for by banks for credit and market risks.  These \nDirections serve to specify the prudential norms from the point of view of capital \nadequacy.  Permission for LABs to undertake transactions in specific \ninstruments/products shall be guided by the regulations, instructions and guidelines \non the same issued by Reserve Bank from time to time.  \n \n 4. Definitions  \n(a) In these Directions, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms herein shall \nbear the meanings assigned to them below \u2014  \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n i.  \u201cBasis Risk\u201d is the risk that the interest rate of different assets, liabilities and \noff-balance sheet items may change in different magnitude.  \nii. \u201cCredit risk\u201d is defined as the potential that a bank's borrower or counterparty \nmay fail to meet its obligatio ns in accordance with agreed terms. It is also the \npossibility of losses associated with diminution in the credit quality of borrowers \nor counterparties . \niii. \u201cDeferred Tax Assets\u201d shall have the same meaning as assigned under the \nextant Accounting Standards.  \niv. \u201cDerivative\u201d shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in section 45U(a) of \nthe RBI Act, 1934.  \nv. \u201cDuration\u201d (Macaulay duration) measures the price volatility of fixed income \nsecurities. It is often used in the comparison of the interest rate risk between  \nsecurities with different coupons and different maturities. It is the weighted \naverage of the present value of all the cash flows associated with a fixed income \nsecurity. It is expressed in years. The duration of a fixed income security is \nalways shorter than its term to maturity, except in the case of zero coupon \nsecurities where they are the same.  \nvi. \u201cHedging\u201d is taking action to eliminate or reduce exposure to risk  \nvii. \u201cHorizontal Disallowance\u201d is a disallowance of offsets to required capital used \nin the BIS (Bank of International Settlements) Method1 for assessing market \nrisk for regulatory capital in order to calculate the capital required for interest \nrate risk of a trading portfolio. The BIS Method allows offsets of long and short \npositions. However, inter est rate risks of instruments at different horizontal \npoints of the yield curve are not perfectly correlated. Hence, the BIS Method \nrequires that a portion of these offsets be disallowed.  \n                                                            \n1 Amendment to the Capital Accord to incorporate market risks: BCBS January 1996  3 \n \n \n \n viii.  \u201cInterest rate risk\u201d is the risk that the financial value of asset s or liabilities (or \ninflows/outflows) will be altered because of fluctuations in interest rates.  \nix. \u201cLong Position\u201d refers to a position where gains arise from a rise in the value of \nthe underlying.  \nx. \u201cMarket risk\u201d is the risk of losses in on -and off -balfance sheet positions arising \nfrom movements in market prices.   \nxi. \u201cModified Duration\u201d or volatility of an interest -bearing security is its Macaulay \nDuration divided by one plus the coupon rate of the security. It represents the \npercentage change in the s ecurities' price for a 100 basis points change in yield. \nIt is generally accurate for only small changes in the yield.  \nMD = - dP /dY x 1/P  \nWhere, MD= Modified Duration  \nP= Gross price (i.e. clean price plus accrued interest)  \ndP= Corresponding small change  in price  \ndY = Small change in yield compounded with the frequency of the coupon \npayment.  \n \nxii. \u201cMortgage -backed security\u201d is a bond -type security in which the collateral is \nprovided by a pool of mortgages. Income from the underlying mortgages is used \nto meet i nterest and principal repayments.  \nxiii. \u201cOpen position\u201d is the net difference between the amounts payable and \namounts receivable in a particular instrument or commodity. It results from the \nexistence of a net long or net short position in the particular instrume nt or \ncommodity.  \nxiv. \u201cShort position\u201d refers to a position where gains arise from a decline in the value \nof the underlying. It also refers to the sale of a security in which the seller does \nnot have a long position.  4 \n \n \n \n xv.  \u201cVertical Disallowance\u201d in the method for determining regulatory capital \nnecessary to cushion market risk is a reversal of the offsets of a general risk \ncharge of a long position by a short position in two or more securities in the \nsame time band in the yield curve where the securities have differ ing credit \nrisks.  \nCHAPTER \u2013 II \nCOMPOSITION OF REGULATORY CAPITAL  \n \n5.

Debt capital Instruments qualifying for Upper Tier II status  ; and  \nf. Any other instrument approved  as in the nature of capital.  \n(iii) Banks / FIs shall not acquire any fresh stake in a bank's equity shares, if by such \nacquisition, the investing bank's / FI's holding exceeds 10 per cent of the investee \nbank's equity capital.  \n(iv) Investments in the instruments iss ued by banks / FIs which are listed at \nparagraph 14(ii) above, which are not deducted  from capital of the investing \nbank/ FI, shall attract 100 per cent risk weight for credit risk for capital adequacy \npurposes.  \n(v) An indicative list of institutions which may  be deemed to be financial institutions \nfor capital adequacy purposes is as under:  \n\uf0a7 Banks,  \n\uf0a7 Mutual funds,  \n\uf0a7 Insurance companies,  \n\uf0a7 Non-banking financial companies,  \n\uf0a7 Housing finance companies,  \n\uf0a7 Merchant banking companies,  \n\uf0a7 Primary dealers  \n \n(vi) The following investments shall be excluded from the purview of the ceiling \nof 10 per cent prudential norm prescribed in paragraph 14(i) above:  \na) Investments in equity shares of other banks /FIs in India held under the \nprovisions of a statute.  \n 8 \n \n \n \n b) Strategic investments in equity shares of other banks/FIs incorporated \noutside India as promoters/significant shareholders (i.e., Foreign \nSubsidiaries / Joint Ventures / Associates).  \nc) Equity holdings outside India in other banks / FIs incorporated outside \nIndia.  \n \n15. Capital Charge for Subsidiaries  \nA consolidated bank defined as a group of entities which include a licensed bank shall \nmaintain a minimum Capital to Risk -weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR)  as applicable to \nthe parent bank on an ongoing basis. The parent bank shall consider the following \npoints while computing capital funds:  \ni. Banks shall maintain a minimum capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 9%. \nNon-bank subsidiaries shall maintain the capital adequacy ratio prescribed \nby their respective re gulators. In case of any shortfall in the capital adequacy \nratio of any of the subsidiaries, the parent shall maintain capital in addition to \nits own regulatory requirements to cover the shortfall.  \nii. Risks inherent in deconsolidated entities in the group shall be assessed and \nany shortfall in the regulatory capital in the deconsolidated entities shall be \ndeducted (in equal proportion from Tier I and Tier II capital) from the \nconsolidated bank's capital in the proportion of its equity stake in the entity.  \n \nCHAPTER \u2013 III \nCapital Charge for Credit Risk  \n \n16. Banks shall manage the credit risks in their books on an ongoing basis and ensure \nthat the capital requirements for credit risks are maintained  on a continuous basis, at \nthe close of each business day. The applicable risk weights for calculation of CRAR for \ncredit risk are specified in Annex 6 . \n \n \n \n 9 \n \n \n \n CHAPTER \u2013 IV \nCapital Charge for Market Risk  \n \n17. Scope and Coverage of Capital  Charge for Market Risks  \nThe capital charge for market risk shall cover the capital charges for interest rate \nrelated instruments in the trading book, equities in the trading book and foreign \nexchange risk (including gold and other precious metals) in both  trading and \nbanking books. Trading book for the purpose of capital adequacy shall include2: \n(i) Securities included under the Held for Trading category  \n(ii) Securities included under the Available for Sale category  \n(iii) Open gold position  \n(iv) Open foreign exchange position  \n(v) Trading positions in derivatives, and  \n(vi) Derivatives entered into for hedging trading book exposures.  \n \n18. Banks shall manage the market risks in their books on an ongoing basis and \nensure that the capital require ments for market risks are maintained on a \ncontinuous basis, at the close of each business day. Banks shall also maintain \nstrict risk management systems to monitor and control intra -day exposures to \nmarket risks.  \n19. Measurement of Capital Charge for Inter est Rate Risk in Trading Book other \nthan Derivatives  \nThe capital charge for interest rate related instruments shall apply to the current market \nvalue of these items in bank\u2019s trading book. The current market value shall be \ndetermined as per the extant RBI guidelines on valuation of investments. The minimum \ncapital requirement is expressed in terms of two separate capital charges: - \n(i) Specific risk charge  for each security both for short and long positions  \n(ii) G eneral market risk charge  towards interest rate risk in the portfolio where \nlong and short positions in different securities or instruments can be offset.  \n \n                                                            \n2 At present, LABs are not permitted to carry out activities mentioned in points (iii) to (vi) . However, as and \nwhen these activities are allowed, the relevant instructions wou ld become applicable to them.  10 \n \n \n \n In India short position is not allowed except in case of derivatives and Central \nGovernment Securities. Banks  shall follow th e framework specified hereunder for \ncapital charge for both specific risk and general market risk for interest rate risk in \nthe trading book other than derivatives . \n \n20. Specific Risk  \nThe capital charge for specific risk is designed to protect against an adverse \nmovement in the price of an individual security owing to factors related to the individual \nissuer. The specific risk charge is graduated for various exposures under three heads:  \n(a) claims on Government, (b) claims on banks, (c) claims on others as specified in \nAnnex 7 . \n \n21. General Market Risk  \n(a) The capital charge for general market risk is designed to capture the risk of loss \narising from changes in market interest rates. The capital charge shall be the sum of \nthree components:  \n\uf0b7 the net short ( short position is not allowed in India except in derivatives and Central \nGovernment Securities) or long position in the whole trading book;  \n\uf0b7 a small proportion of the matched positions in each time -band (the \u201cvertical \ndisallowance\u201d); and  \n\uf0b7 a larger proportion of the matched positions across different time -bands (the \n\u201chorizontal disallowance\u201d).   \n(b) Banks shall adopt the standardized duration method for computation of capital \ncharge for market risk.  Banks shall be requi red to measure the gen eral market \nrisk charge by calculating the price sensitivity (modified duration)  of each position \nseparately. The mechanics shall be as follows:  \n\uf0b7 first calculate the price sensitivity (modified duration) of each instrument;  \n\uf0b7 next apply the assumed change in yield to the modified duration of each \ninstrument between 0.6 and 1.0 percentage points depending on the maturity \nof the instrument as specified in Annex 8 ; \n\uf0b7 slot the resulting capital charge measu res into a maturity ladder with  the fifteen \ntime bands as specified in Annex 8 ; 11 \n \n \n \n \uf0b7 subject long and short positions in each time band to a 5 per cent vertical \ndisallowance designed to capture basis risk; and  \n\uf0b7 carry forward the net positions in each time -band for horizontal offsetting subject \nto the disallowances specified in Annex 9 . \n \n22. Capital Charge for Interest Rate Derivatives  \nThe measurement of capital charge for market risk shall include all interest rate \nderivatives and off -balance sheet instruments in the trading book, which react to \nchanges in interest rates (eg. Forward rate agreements, other forward contracts, \netc.) and d erivatives entered into for hedging trading book exposures . The details of \nmeasurement of capital charge for interest rate derivatives are specified in Annex 10 .   \n \n23. Measurement of Capital Charge for equities in the trading book  \n(a) Capital charge for equities in the trading book shall be applied to all instruments \nthat exhibit market behavior similar to equities but not to non -convertible preference \nshares (which are covered by the interest rate risk requirements). The instr uments \ncovered include equity shares, whether voting or non -voting, convertible securities \nthat behave like equities, such as units of mutual funds, and commitments to buy or \nsell equity. The capital charge for equities shall apply to the current market va lue of \nthese items in the bank\u2019s trading book.  \nCapital charge for specific risk (akin to credit risk) shall be 11.25%. Specific risk \nshall be computed on the banks\u2019 gross equity positions (the sum of all long equity \npositions and of all short equity positions -short equity position is, however, not \nallowed for banks in India ). The general market risk charge shall be 9% on the gross \nequity positions.  \n(b) Investments in shares and units of Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) shall be \nassigned 150% risk weight f or measuring the credit risk during first three years \nwhen these are held under HTM category. When these are held under or \ntransferred to AFS, the capital charge for specific risk component of the market risk  \nshall be fixed at 13.5% to reflect the risk weight of 150%. The charge for general market \nrisk component shall be at 9% as in the case of other equities.  \n 12 \n \n \n \n  \n24. Measurement of Capital Charge for Foreign Exchange and Gold Open \nPositions  \nForeign exchange open positions and gold open positions shall be risk weighted at \n100%. Capital charge for foreign exchange and gold open positions (limits or actual \nwhichever is higher) shall attract capital charge at 9%.  \n \n25. Aggregation of Capital Char ge for Market Risks  \nThe capital charges for specific risk and general market risk shall be computed \nseparately before aggregation. For computing the total capital charge for market \nrisks, the calculations shall be plotted in the proforma  as per Table 1 below.  \nTable -1: Total Capital Charge for Market Risk  \n(\u20b9 crore)  \nRisk Category  Capital charge  \nI. Interest Rate (a+b)   \na. General market risk   \n\uf0b7 Net position (parallel shift)  \n\uf0b7 Horizontal disallowance (curvature)  \n\uf0b7 Vertical disallowance (basis)   \nb. Specific risk   \nII. Equity (a+b)   \n     a. General Market Risk   \n     b. Specific Risk   \nIII. Foreign Exchange & Gold   \nIV. Total capital charge for market risks  (I+II+III)   \n \n26. Computation of Capital available for Market Risk:  \nCapital required for supporting credit risk shall be deducted from total capital funds to \narrive at capital available for supporting market risk. (Refer Annex 11  for illustration) . \n \nCHAPTER \u2013 V \nCalculation of Total Risk -Weighted  Assets and Capital Ratio  \n \n27. The f ollowing steps shall be followed for calculation of total risk weighted \nassets and capital ratio:  \ni) Compute the risk weighted assets for credit risk in the banking book and for \ncounterparty credit risk on all OTC derivatives.  13 \n \n \n \n ii) Convert the capital charge for market risk to notional risk weighted assets by \nmultiplying the capital charge arrived at in T able 1 above, by 100 \u00f7 9 [the present \nrequirement of CRAR is 9% and hence notional risk weighted assets are arrived at by \nmultiplying the capital charge by (100 \u00f7 9)]  \niii) Add the risk -weighted assets for credit risk as at (i) above and notional risk -\nweigh ted assets of trading book as at (ii) above to arrive at total risk weighted assets \nfor the bank.  \niv) Compute capital ratio on the basis of regulatory capital maintained and risk -\nweighted assets.  \n28. Worked out Examples : Two examples for computing capital charge for market \nrisk and credit risk are given in Annex 12 . \n \n \nCHAPTER \u2013 VI \nREPEAL AND OTHER PROVISIONS  \n \n29.

In the case of \nthose currencies in which business is insignificant (where the turnover in the \nrespective currency is less than 5 per cent of overall foreign exchange turnover), \nseparate calculations for each currency are not required. The bank can, instead, \nslot within each appropriate time -band, the net long or short position for each \ncurrency. However, these individual net positions shall be summed within each \ntime-band, irrespective of whether they are long or short positions, to produce a \ngross position f igure. In the case of residual currencies, the gross positions in \neach time -band shall be subject to the assumed change in yield set out in table \nwith no further offsets.  \n \n 56 \n \n \n \n Annex 10  \n \nMeasurement system in respect of Interest Rate Derivatives  \n1. Interest Rate Derivatives  \nThe measurement system shall include all interest rate derivatives and off -balance  \nsheet instruments in the trading book, which react to changes in interest rates, (e.g. \nforward rate agreements (FRAs), other forward contracts, bond future s, interest rate and \ncross -currency swaps and forward foreign exchange positions).  \n2. Calculation of positions  \nThe derivatives shall be converted into positions in the relevant underlying and be \nsubjected to specific and general market risk charges. In computation of the capital \ncharge, the amounts reported shall be the market value of the principal amount of \nthe underlying or of the notional underlying. For instruments where the apparent \nnotional amount differs from the effective notional amount, banks shall use the \neffective notional amount.  \ni. Futures and forward contracts, including Forward Rate Agreements (FRA):  These \ninstruments shall be treated as a combination of a long and a short position in a \nnotional government security. The maturity of a future or a FRA shall be the period \nuntil delivery or exercise of the contract, plus - where applicable - the life of the \nunderlying instrument. For example, a long position in a June three -month interest \nrate future (taken in April) shall be reported as a long position in a government \nsecurity with a maturity of five months and a short position in a government security \nwith a maturity of two months. Where a range of deliverable instruments may be \ndelivered to  fulfill the contract, the bank has flexibility to elect which deliverable \nsecurity goes into the duration ladder but shall take account of any conversion \nfactor defined by the exchange.  \nii. Swaps : Swaps shall be treated as two notional positions in government securities \nwith relevant maturities. For example, an interest rate swap under which a bank \nis receiving floating rate interest and paying fixed will be treated as a long \nposition in a floating  rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the period until the \nnext interest fixing and a short position in a fixed -rate instrument of maturity \nequivalent to the residual life of the swap. For swaps that pay or receive a fixed \nor floating interest rate ag ainst some other reference price, e.g. a stock index, the 57 \n \n \n \n interest rate component shall be slotted into the appropriate re -pricing maturity \ncategory, with the equity component being included in the equity framework. \nSeparate legs of cross -currency swaps sh all be reported in the relevant maturity \nladders for the currencies concerned.  \n3. Calculation of Capital Charges for Derivatives under the Standardised \nMethodology:  \ni. Allowable offsetting of matched positions  \nBanks shall exclude the following from the interest rate maturity framework \naltogether (for both specific and general market risk);  \n\uf0b7 Long and short positions (both actual and notional) in identical instruments \nwith exactly the same issuer, coupon, currency and maturity.  \n\uf0b7 A matched position in a future or forward and its corresponding underlying \nshall also be fully offset (the leg representing the time to expiry of the future \nshall however be reported) and thus excluded from the calculation.  \nWhen the future or  the forward comprises a range of deliverable instruments, \noffsetting of positions in the future or forward contract and its underlying is only \npermissible in cases where there is a readily identifiable underlying security which \nis most profitable for the trader with a short position to deliver. The price of this \nsecurity, sometimes called the \"cheapest -to-deliver\", and the price of the future or \nforward contract shall in such cases move in close alignment.  \nNo offsetting shall be allowed between positions i n different currencies; the \nseparate legs of cross -currency swaps or forward foreign exchange deals shall be \ntreated as notional positions in the relevant instruments and included in the \nappropriate calculation for each currency.  \nIn addition, opposite positions in the same category of instruments can in \ncertain circumstances be regarded as matched and allowed to offset fully. To \nqualify for this treatment the positions shall relate to the same underlying \ninstruments, be of the same  nominal value and be denominated in the same \ncurrency. In addition:  \n\uf0b7 for futures: offsetting positions in the notional or underlying instruments to \nwhich the futures contract relates shall be for identical products and mature \nwithin seven days of each othe r; 58 \n \n \n \n \uf0b7 for swaps and FRAs: the reference rate (for floating rate positions) shall be \nidentical and the coupon closely matched (i.e. within 15 basis points); and  \n\uf0b7 for swaps , FRAs and forwards: the next interest fixing date or, for fixed coupon \npositions or forw ards, the residual maturity shall correspond within the following \nlimits:  \no less than one month hence: same day;  \no between one month and one year hence: within seven days;  \no over one year hence: within thirty days.  \nBanks with large swap books can use alternative formulae for these swaps to calculate \nthe positions to be included in the duration ladder. The method shall be to calculate the \nsensitivity of the net present value implied by the change in yield used in the duration \nmethod and allocate these sensitivities into the time -bands specified in Annex 8 . \n \nii. Specific Risk  \nInterest rate and currency swaps, FRAs, forward foreign exchange contracts and \ninterest rate futures shall not be subject to a specific risk charge. This exemption also \napplies to futures on an interest rate index. However, in the case of futures contracts \nwhere the underlying is a debt security, or an index representing a basket of debt \nsecurities, a specific risk charge shall apply according to the credit risk of the issuer.  \n \niii. General Market Risk  \nGeneral market risk applies to positions in all derivative products in the same manner \nas for cash positions, subject only to an exemption for f ully or very closely matched \npositions in identical instruments as defined in paragraphs above. The various \ncategories of instruments shall be slotted into the maturity ladder and treated \naccording to the rules identified earlier.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 59 \n \n \n \n  \nTable - Summary of treatment of interest rate derivatives  \nInstrument  Specific  \nrisk charge  General Market risk  \ncharge  \nExchange -traded future  \n- Government debt security  \n- Corporate debt security  \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. MIBOR)   \nNo \nYes \nNo  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nOTC forward  \n- Government debt security  \n- Corporate debt security  \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. MIBOR)   \nNo \nYes \nNo  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nFRAs, Swaps  No Yes, as two positions  \nForward Foreign Exchange  No Yes, as one position in \neach currency  \n \n \n \n \n 60 \n \n \n \n Annex 11  \n \nComputation of Capital for Market Risk  \n \nCapital required for supporting credit risk shall be deducted from total capital funds to \narrive at capital available for supporting market risk as illustrated below:   \n                             (\u20b9 in crore)  \n1 Capital funds  \n\uf0b7 Tier I capital  -------------------------------   \n\uf0b7 Tier II capital  ------------------------------    \n55 \n50 105 \n2 Total risk weighted assets   1140  \n \uf0b7 RWA for credit risk  -----------------------   1000   \n \uf0b7 RWA for market risk  ---------------------   140  \n3 Total CRAR   9.21 \n4 Minimum capital required to support credit risk (1000*9%)   90 \n \uf0b7 Tier I - 45 (@ 4.5% of 1000)  ----------   45  \n \uf0b7 Tier II - 45 (@ 4.5% of 1000)  ---------   45  \n5 Capital available to support market risk (105 - 90)  15 \n \uf0b7 Tier I - (55 - 45) --------------------------   10  \n \uf0b7 Tier II - (50 - 45) -------------------------   5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 61 \n \n \n \n Annex 12  \nWorked out examples for computing Capital Charge  \nfor Credit and Market Risks  \nExample I  - Case where the trading book does not contain equities and interest rate \nrelated derivative instruments  \n1.

Long and \nshort positions within a time band have been subjected to vertical disallowance of 5%. \nIn the instant case, ve rtical disallowance is applicable under 3 -6 month time band and \n7.3- 9.3 year time band. Then, net positions in each time band have been computed \nfor horizontal offsetting subject to the disallowances mentioned in the table. In the \ninstant case, horizontal  disallowance is applicable only in respect of Zone 3. Horizontal \ndisallowances in respect of adjacent zones are not applicable in the instant case.  \n3.1 Calculation of Vertical Disallowance  \nWhile calculating capital charge for general market risk on interest rate related \ninstruments, banks should recognize the basis risk (different types of instruments \nwhose price responds differently for movement in general rates) and gap risk (different \nmaturities within timebands). This is addressed by a small capital charge (5%) on \nmatched (off -setting) positions in each time band (\u201cVertical Disallowance\u201d)  71 \n \n \n \n An off -setting position, for vertical disallowance, will be either the sum of long positions \nand or t he short positions within a time band, whichever is lower. In the table at the \nend of the annex, except for the time band 3 -6 months in Zone 1 and the time band of \n7.3-9.3 years, where there are off -setting positions of ( -) 0.22 and 2.79, there is no \noffse tting position in any other time band. The sum of long positions in the 3 -6 months \ntime band is + 0.47 and the sum of short positions in this time band is ( -) 0.22. This \noffsetting position of 0.22 is subjected to a capital charge of 5% i.e. 0.01. The sum of \nlong positions in the 7.3 -9.3 years time band is + 2.79 and the sum of short positions \nin this time band is ( -) 3.08. This off -setting position of 2.79 is subjected to a capital \ncharge of 5% i.e. 0.1395. It may be mentioned here that if a bank does not have both \nlong and short positions in the same time band, there is no need for any vertical \ndisallowance. Banks in India are not allowed to take any short position in their books, \nexcept in derivatives. Therefore, banks in India will generally not be subje ct to vertical \ndisallowance unless they have a short position in derivatives.  \n3.2. Calculation of Horizontal Disallowance  \nWhile calculating capital charge for general market risk on interest rate related \ninstruments, banks must subject their positions to a  second round of off -setting across \ntime bands with a view to give recognition to the fact that interest rate movements are \nnot perfectly correlated across maturity bands (yield curve risk and spread risk) i.e \nmatched long and short positions in different time bands may not perfectly off -set. This \nis achieved by a \u201cHorizontal Disallowance\u201d.  \nAn off -setting position, for horizontal disallowance, will be either the sum of long \npositions and or the short positions within a Zone, whichever is lower. In the above  \nexample, except in Zone 3 (7.3 to 9.3 years) where there is an off -setting (matched) \nposition of ( -) 0.29, there is no off -setting position in any other Zone. The sum of long \npositions in this Zone is 9.74 and the sum of short positions in this Zone is ( -) 0.29. \nThis off -setting position of 0.29 is subject to horizontal disallowance as under:  \nWithin the same Zone (Zone 3) 30% of 0.29   = 0.09  \nBetween adjacent Zones (Zone 2 & 3)  = Nil \nBetween Zones 1 and Zone 3  = Nil \nIt may be mentioned here that if a bank does not have both long and short positions \nin different time zones, there is no need for any horizontal disallowance. Banks in India 72 \n \n \n \n are not allowed to take any short position in their books except in derivatives. \nTherefore, banks in India will generally not be subject to horizontal disallowance \nunless they have short positions in derivatives.  \nTotal capital charge for interest rate related instruments is shown below:  \nFor overall net position  16.06  \nFor vertical disallowance  0.15 \nFor horizontal disallowance in Zone 3  0.09 \nFor horizontal disallowance in adjacent zones  nil \nFor horizontal disallowance between Zone 1 & 3  Nil \nTotal capital charge for interest rate related instruments  16.30  \n \n(4) The total capital charge in this example for general market risk for interest rate \nrelated instruments is computed as under:  \nSl. \nNo. Capital charge  Amount  \n(\u20b9) \n1 For the vertical disallowance (under 3 -6 month time band)  1,12,500  \n2 For the vertical disallowance (under 7.3 -9.3 year time band)  13,95,000  \n3 For the horizontal disallowance (under Zone 3)  9,00,000  \n4 For the horizontal disallowances between adjacent zones  0 \n5 For the overall net open position (17.82 \u2013 2.61 + 0.84)  16,06,00,000  \n6 Total capital charge for general market risk on interest \nrate related instruments (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)  16,30,07,500  \n \n(5) Equities: Capital charge for General Market Risk for equities is 9%.

O ver the \nyears, the sector has  undergone considerable evolution in terms of s ize, complexity, and \ninterconnectedness  within the financial sector. Many  entities have grown and become \nsystemically significant  and hence there is a need to align the regulatory framework for NBFCs \nkeeping in view  their changing risk profile.  \n \n2. Pursuant to the announcement made in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory \nPolicies dated December 04, 2020 , a discussion paper titled \u2018 Revised Regulatory Framework \nfor NBFCs - A Scale -based Approach \u2019 was issued for public comments on January 22, 2021.  \nBased on the inputs received,  it has now been decided to put in place a revised r egulatory \nframework for NBFCs  (Annex ).  \n \n3. As the SBR framework encompasses  different facets of regulation  of NBFCs covering  \ncapital requirements, governance standards, prudential regulation,  etc., it has been decided \nto first issue an integrated regulatory framework for NBFCs under SBR  providing a holistic \nview of the SBR structure, set of fresh regulations being introduced and respective timelines. \nDetailed guidelines  as delineated in the Annex , will be issued subsequently.  \n \n \n4. These guidelines shall be effective from October 01, 2022.

This internal assessment shall be on similar  lines as ICAAP prescribed \nfor commercial banks under Pillar 2 (Master Circular \u2013  Basel III Capital Regulations dated \nJuly 01, 2015 ). While Pillar 2 capital will not be insisted upon, NBFCs are required to make \na realistic assessment of risks. Internal capital assessment shall factor in credit risk, market \nrisk, operational risk and all other residual risks  as per methodology to be determined \ninternally . The methodology for internal assessment of capital shall be proportionate to the \nscale and complexity of operations as per their Board approved policy. The objective of \nICAAP is to ensure availability of adequate capital to support all risks in business a s also \nto encourage NBFC s to develop and use better internal risk management techniques for \nmonitoring and managing their risks. This will facilitate an active dialogue between the \nsupervisors  and NBFCs on the assessment of risks and monitoring as well as mitigation \nof the same.  \nAdditional regulatory changes under SBR applicable to NBFC-UL  \n \nb) Common Equity Tier 1  \u2013 In order to enhance the quality of regulatory capital, NBFC -UL \nshall maintain Common Equity Tier 1 c apital of at least 9 per cent of Risk Weighted Assets.  \n \n \nc) Leverage - In addition to the CRAR, NBFC -UL will also be subjected to leverage \nrequirement to ensure that their growth is supported by adequate capital , among other \nfactors . A suitable ceiling for leverage will be prescribed subsequently for these entities as \nand when necessary . \n \n \nd) Differential standard asset provisioning- NBFC-UL shall be required to hold differential \nprovisioning towards different classes of standard assets.  \n \n \nA detailed circular will be issued by the Bank for guidelines at paras  b, c, and d above. \n \n3.2.2 Prudential Guidelines \u2013  \n \n \nRegulatory changes under SBR applicable to NBFC-ML and NBFC -UL \n \n \n \na) Concentration of credit/ investment  - The extant credit concentration limits prescribed \nfor NBFCs separately for lending and investments  shall be merged into a single exposure \nlimit of 25% for single borrower/ party  and 40% for s ingle group of borrowers/ parties . \nFurther, the concentration limits  shall be determined with reference to the NBFC\u2019s Tier 1 \ncapital  instead of their Owned Fund.  The revised norms are indicated in the table below :  \n \n  \n6 \n Existing  limit \n(as a percentage of Owned Fund)  Revised  limit \n(as a percentage of Tier  I Capital ) \n Lending  Investment  Total   Exposure  \nSingle borrower/ \nparty  15 15 25 Single borrower/ \nparty  25 \nSingle g roup of \nborrowers/ parties  25 25 40 Single group of \nborrowers/ parties  40 \n \nNBFC-UL shall follow these norms till Large Exposure Framework is put in place for them. \nExtant instructions on concentration norms for different categories of NBFC , other than the \nchanges  indicated above,  will continue to remain applicable.  \nb) Sensitive Sector Exposure (SSE)  - Exposure to capital market (direct and indirect) and \ncommercial real estate6 shall be reckoned as sensitive exposure for NBFCs. NBFCs shall \nfix Board-approved internal limits for  SSE separately for capital market and commercial \nreal estate exposures. D ynamic vulnerability assessments  of various sectors and their \nlikely impact on business, as evaluated periodically, should help NBFCs determine such \ninternal exposure limits . While the Board is free to determine various sub-limits within the \noverall SSE internal limits, the following are specifically prescr ibed:   \ni) A sub-limit within the commercial real estate exposure ceiling shall  be fixed \ninternally for financing land acquisition.  \nii) Ceiling on IPO Funding as mentioned at Para 3.1.  \n \nHousing Finance Companies shall continue to follow  specific regulation on sensitive sector \nexposure, as are currently applicable in terms of paragraph 227 & 238 of Master Direction \n\u2013 Non-Banking Financial Company \u2013  Housing Finance Company (Reserve Bank) \nDirections, 2021 . \n \n \nc) Regulatory restrictions on loans \u2013 NBFCs shall be subject to r egulatory restrictions  in \nrespect of the following:  \n \ni) Granting loans and advances to directors, their relatives and to entities where \ndirectors or their relatives have major shareholding.   \nii) Granting loans and advances to Senior Officers  of the NB FC. \niii) While appraising loan proposals involving real estate, NBFCs shall ensure that the borrowers have obtained prior permission from government / local governments / \n                                                           \n6 Sensitive Sector Exposure as enumerated in para 3.6, Annex  XIV of Master Direction on Non -Banking Financial Company -  \nSystemically Important Non -Deposit taking Company and Deposit taking Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016 dated  \nSeptember 01, 2016  \n7 No housing finance company  shall invest in land or buildings, except for its own use, an amount exceeding twenty per cent \nof its capital fund. \n8 The aggregate exposure of a housing finance company to the capital market in all forms (b oth fund based, and non -fund \nbased) should not exceed 40 per cent of its net worth as on March 31 of the previous year.   \n7 \n other statutory authorities for the project, wherever required. To ensure that the \nloan approv al process is not hampered on account of this, while the proposals \ncould be sanctioned in normal course, the disbursements shall be made only after \nthe borrower has obtained requisite clearances from the government authorities.  \nA detailed circular on the areas  mentioned at para c  above will be issued by the Reserve Bank \nin due course. In the meantime, extant norms shall p revail.  \nAdditional r egulatory changes under SBR applicable to NBFC-UL  \n \nd) Large Exposure Framework \u2013 It has been decided to introduce Large Exposure \nFramework (LEF) for NBFCs placed in the Upper Layer. Accordingly, large exposure of an \nNBFC to all counterparties and groups of connected counterparties will be considered for \nexposure ceilings.  Simplified and separate guidelines will be issued incorporating the \ndefinition of large exposure, regulatory reporting and large exposure limits . \ne) Internal Exposure Limits - In addition to the internal limits on SSE in respect of capital \nmarket and commercial real estate as indicated in para b) above, Board of NBFC- UL shall \nalso determine internal exposure limits on other important sectors to which credit is \nextended.

A timeline of two years is provided with effect from October  01, 2022 to ensure \ncompliance with these norms. It is clarified that they can assume directorship in NBFC-\nBLs. \n \ne) Independent Director  \u2013 Within the permissible limits in terms of Companies Act, 2013, \nan independent director shall not be on the B oard of more than three NBFCs (NBFC- ML \nor NBFC-UL) at the same time. Further, the Board of the NBFC shall ensure that there is \nno conflict arising out of their independent directors being on the Board of another  NBFC \nat the same time. A timeline of two years is provided with effect from October  01, 2022 to \nensure compliance with these norms. There shall be no restriction to directorship on the \nBoards of NBFC -BLs, subject to applicable provisions of Companies Act, 2013.  \n \n \nf) Disclosures - NBFCs  shall, in addition to the existing regulatory disclosures , disclose the \nfollowing in their Annual Financial Statements, with effect from March 31, 2023 : \ni) Corporate Governance report containing composition and category of directors, \nshareholding of non-executive directors, etc.  \nii) Disclosure on modified opinion, if any, expressed by auditors, its impact on various \nfinancial items and views of management on audit qualifications. \niii) Items of income and ex penditure of exceptional nature.  \niv) Breach es in terms of covenants  in respect of loans availed by the NBFC or debt \nsecurities issued by the NBFC  including incidence /s of default.  \nv) Divergence in asset classification and provisioning above a certain threshold to be \ndecided by the Reserve Bank . \n \ng) Chief Compliance Officer  \u2013 In order to ensure an effective compliance culture, it is \nnecessary to have an independent compliance function and a strong compliance risk \nmanagement framework in NBFCs. NBFCs are, therefore, required to appoint a Chief \nCompliance Officer  (CCO) , who should be sufficiently senior in the organization hierarc hy. \nNBFCs shall put in place a Board approved policy laying down the role and responsibilities \nof the CCO with the objective of promoting better compliance culture in the organization.  \n \nh) Compensation guidelines - In order to address issues arising out of excessive risk taking \ncaused by misaligned compensation packages, it has been decided that NBFC s shall put \nin place a  Board approved compensation policy. The guidelines shall at the minimum \ninclude, a) constitution of a Remuneration Committee, b) principles for fixed/ variabl e pay \n                                                           \n9 As defined in Section 2 (51) of Companies Act, 2013, as amended from time to time.   \n9 \n structures, and c) malus/ claw back provisions .

Such higher \nrequirements shall be specifically communicated to the NBFC at the time of its classification \nin the Top Layer. There will be enhanced and intensive supervisory engagement with these \nNBFCs.  \n  \n10 \n Section III \n4. TRANSITION PATH  \n \n4.1 Transition Plan - Once a NBFC is identified for inclusion as NBFC- UL, the NBFC shall \nbe advised about its classification by the Department of Regulation, Reserve Bank and it will \nbe placed under  regulation applicable to the Upper Layer. For this purpose, the following \ntimelines shall be adhered to: \n \na) Within 3 months  of being advised by the RBI regarding its inclusion in the NBFC -UL, the \nNBFC shall put in pla ce a Board approved policy for adoption of the enhanced regulatory \nframework and chart out an implementation plan for adhering to the new set of regulations.  \n \nb) The Board shall ensure that the stipulations  prescribed for the NBFC -UL are adhered to \nwithin a maximum time-period of 24 months  from the date of advice regarding classification \nas a NBFC -UL from the Reserve Bank . During the period of transition, calibrated increment \nto business may be allowed through supervisory engagement. The period of 3 months  \nprovided for charting out the plan for implementation shall be subsumed within the 24-\nmonths\u2019 time-period referred to above.  \n \nc) The roadmap as approved by the Board towards implementation of the enhanced \nregulatory requirement shall  be submitted to the Reserve Bank and shall be subject to \nsupervisory review.  \n \n \n4.2 Transition of NBFCs to the Upper Layer  \na) Once an NBFC is categorised as NBFC -UL, it shall be subject to enhanced regulatory \nrequirement, at least for a period of five years from its classification in the layer, even in \ncase  it does not meet the parametric criteria in the subsequent year/s. In other words, it \nwill be eligible to move out of the enhanced regulatory framework only if it does not meet \nthe criteria for classification for five c onsecutive years. \n \n \nb) NBFC-UL may however move out of the enhanced regulatory framework before the period \nof fiv e years if the movement is on account of voluntary strategic move to readjust \noperations as per a Board approved policy. This stipulation shall not apply if the scaling \ndown of operations  is on account of adverse situations specific to the NBFC and its \ndeteriorating financial conditions.  \n \nc) NBFCs which are close to meeting the parameters and benchmarks that would render \nthem  eligible for classification as NBFC -UL shall be intimated about the same  to enable \nthem to readjust their operations , in case they intend to continue to function as NBFC -ML \non a long-term basis and do not want to graduate to NBFC -UL. \n  \n11 \n 4.3 Review of Assessment Methodology  - The methodology for assessing the NBFC -UL \nshall be reviewed periodically .  \n \n4.4 Classification of Government owned NBFCs - As per the Reserve Bank\u2019s circular on \n\u2018Withdrawal of Exemptions Granted to Government Owned NBFCs\u2019 dated May 31, 2018 , the \nGovernment owned NBFCs are still i n the transition period to attain the minimum CRAR. It \nhas, therefore, been decided not to subject these NBFCs  to the Upper Layer regulatory \nframework  at this juncture. A decision on including eligible Government NBFCs meeting the \nspecified criteria into  the Upper Layer will be taken at a later stage and till that time the \nguidelines as applicable for the NBFC -ML shall apply. \n \n4.5 Regulation of NBFCs not availing public funds and not having customer interface - \nNBFCs not availing public funds and not havi ng customer interface bear a different risk profile \nand hence deserve a differential regulatory treatment. It has been decided that Reserve Bank \nwill come out with separate regulations for such NBFCs in due course. Till such time, the \nextant regulations wi ll continue to apply. \n \n***  \n12 \n Appendix \nScoring Methodology for Identification of NBFC as NBFC-UL  \nUpper  Layer shall be populated with NBFCs, identified by way of a parametric scoring \nmethodology, comprising of quantitative and qualitative parameters/ supervisory judgment. \nThe quantitative and qualitative parameters shall have weightage of 70% and 30% \nrespectively . Scoring methodology for i dentification of an NBFC as NBFC-UL shall be based \non the set of NBFCs fulfilling the following criteria: \n \na. Top 50 NBFCs  (excluding top ten NBFCs  based on asset size,  which automatically fall \nin the Upper Layer)  based on their  total exposure including credit equivalent of off-\nbalance sheet exposure.  \nb. NBFCs designated as NBFC -UL in the previous year.  \nc.

The additional liability on account of revision  in family pension consequent to the \naforementioned settlement should be fully recognised and charged to the Profit and \nLoss Account in  the current financial year .

We have examined the issues from a regulatory perspective,  and as an exceptional \ncase, it has been decided that banks  covered by the aforementioned settlement  may \ntake the following course of action in the matter:  \na. The liability for enhancement of family pension shall be fully recognised as per \napplicable accounting standards.  \nb. The expenditure, as indicated in paragraph 2 above, may, if not fully charged to \nthe Profit and Loss Account during the financial year 2021- 22, be amortised over  \na period not exceeding five years beginning with the financial year ending  \n2 \n \nMarch  31, 2022, subject to a minimum of 1/5th of the total amount involved being \nexpensed every year.  \nc.

Narasimham), the Reserve Bank of India\nhas introduced, in a phased manner, prudential norms for income recognition, asset classificationand provisioning for the advances portfolio of the banks so as to move towards greaterconsistency and transparency in the published accounts.\n1.2 The pol\nicy of income recognition should be objective and based on record of recovery rather \nthan on any subjective considerations. Likewise, the classification of assets  of banks has to be \ndone on the basis of objective criteria which would ensure a uniform and consistent application of the norms. Also, the provisioning should be made on the basis of the classification of assets \nbased on the period for which the asset has  remained non-performing and the availability of \nsecurity and the realisable value thereof. \n1.3 B\nanks are urged to ensure that while granting loans and advances, realistic  repayment \nschedules may be fixed on the basis of cash flows with borrowers. This would go a long way to \nfacilitate prompt repayment by the borrowers and thus improve the record of recovery in advances. \n2. DEFINITIONS\n2.1 Non -performing Assets  \n2.1.1 A\nn asset, including a leased asset, becomes non performing when it ceases to generate \nincome for the bank.  \n2.1.2 A\n non performing asset (NPA) is a loan or an advance where; \ni.interest and/ or instalment of principal remains overdue for a period of more than 90\ndays in respect of a term loan,\nii.the account remains \u2018out of order\u2019 as indicated at p aragraph 2.2 below, in respect of\nan Overdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC),\niii.the bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of billspurchased and discounted,  6 iv. the instalment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for two crop seasons  \nfor short duration crops,  \nv. the instalment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for one crop season for \nlong duration crops,  \nvi. the amount of liquidity facility remains outstanding for more than 90 days, in respect \nof a securitisation transaction undertaken in terms of the Reserve Bank of India \n(Securitisation of Standard Assets) Directions, 2021 . \nvii. in respect of derivative transactions, the overdue receivables represent ing positive \nmark -to-market value of a derivative contract, if these remain unpaid for a period of \n90 days from the specified due date for payment.  \n2.1.3 In case of interest payments, banks should, classify an account as NPA only if the interest \ndue and ch arged during any quarter is not serviced fully within 90 days from the end of the \nquarter.  \n2.1.4 In addition, an account may also be classified as NPA in terms of certain specific provisions \nof this Master Circular, including inter alia Paragraphs 4.2.4, 4.2.9 and Part B2. \n2.2 \u2018Out of Order\u2019 status  \nAn account should be treated as 'out of order' if the outstanding balance remains continuously \nin excess of the sanctioned limit/drawing power for 90 days. In cases where the outstanding balance in the principal  operating account is less than the sanctioned limit/drawing power, but \nthere are no credits continuously for 90 days as on the date of Balance Sheet or credits are not \nenough to cover the interest debited during the same period, these accounts should be treated \nas 'out of order' . \n2.3 \u2018Overdue\u2019 \nAny amount due to the bank under any credit facility is \u2018overdue\u2019 if it is not paid on the due date fixed by the bank.  \n3. INCOME RECOGNITION  \n \n3.1 Income Recognition Policy  \n3.1.1 The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of recovery. \nTherefore, the banks should not charge and take to income account interest on any NPA. This \nwill apply to Government guaranteed accounts also.   7 3.1.2 However, interest on advances against Term Deposits, National  Savings Certificates \n(NSCs), Indira Vikas Patras (IVPs), Kisan Vikas Patras (KVPs) and Life policies may be taken to \nincome account on the due date, provided adequate margin is available in the accounts.  \n3.1.3 Fees and commissions earned by the banks as a result of renegotiations or rescheduling \nof outstanding debts should be recognised on an accrual basis over the period of time covered \nby the renegotiated or rescheduled extension of credit.  \n3.2 Reversal of income  \n3.2.1 If any advance, including bills purchas ed and discounted, becomes NPA, the entire interest \naccrued and credited to income account in the past periods, should be reversed if the same is \nnot realised. This will apply to Government guaranteed accounts also.  \n \n3.2.2 In respect of NPAs, fees, commiss ion and similar income that have accrued should cease \nto accrue in the current period and should be reversed with respect to past periods, if uncollected.  \n3.2.3 Leased Assets - The finance charge component of finance income [as defined in \u2018AS 19 \nLeases\u2019)] on the leased asset which has accrued and was credited to income account before the \nasset became non performing, and remaining unrealised, should be reversed or provided for in \nthe current accounting period. \n3.3 Appropriation of recovery in NPAs  \n3.3.1 Interes t realised on NPAs may be taken to income account provided the credits in the \naccounts towards interest are not out of fresh/ additional credit facilities sanctioned to the \nborrower concerned.  \n3.3.2 In the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the borrower for the purpose \nof appropriation of recoveries in NPAs (i.e. towards principal or interest due), banks should adopt \nan accounting principle and exercise the right of appropriation of recoveries in a uniform and \nconsistent manner.  \n3.4 Interest Appl ication  \n \nOn an account turning NPA, banks should reverse the interest already charged and not collected by debiting Profit and Loss account and  stop further application of interest. However, \nbanks may continue to record such accrued interest in a Memorandum account in their books. \nFor the purpose of computing Gross Advances, interest recorded in the Memorandum account \nshould not be taken into account.    8 3.5 Computation of NPA levels  \n \nBanks are advised to compute their Gross Advances, Net Advances, Gross NPAs and Net NPAs, \nas per the format in Annex -1. \n4. ASSET CLASSIFICATION  \n \n4.1 Categories of NPAs  \nBanks are required to classify non performing assets further into the following three categories \nbased on the period for which the asset has remained non performing and the realisability of the \ndues:  \n(i) Substandard Assets  \n(ii) Doubtful Assets  \n(iii) Loss Assets \n \n4.1.1  Substandard Assets  \nWith effect from March 31, 2005, a substandard asset would be one, which has remained \nNPA for a period less than or equal to 12 months. Such an asset will have w ell defined \ncredit weaknesses that jeopardise the liquidation of the debt and are characterised by the \ndistinct possibility that the banks will sustain some loss, if deficiencies are not corrected. \n4.1.2  Doubtful Assets  \nWith effect from March 31, 2005, an asset would be classified as doubtful if it has remained \nin the substandard category for a period of 12 months. A loan classified as doubtful has all \nthe weaknesses inherent in assets that were classified as substandard, with the added \ncharacteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, \u2013 on the basis of \ncurrently known facts, conditions and values \u2013  highly questionable and improbable. \n4.1.3  Loss Assets  \nA loss asset is one where loss has been identified by the bank or internal or external auditors or the RBI inspection but the amount has not been written off wholly. In other \nwords, such an asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted although there may be some salvage or recovery \nvalue.   9 4.2 Guidelines for classification of assets  \n4.2.1 General  \nBroadly speaking, classification of assets into above categories should be done taking into \naccount the degree of well -defined credit weaknesses . \n4.2.2 Appropriate internal systems for pr oper and timely identification of NPAs  \n \nBanks should establish appropriate internal systems (including technology enabled processes) \nfor proper and timely identification of NPAs , including putting in the necessary infrastructure to \ncomply with the requirem ents of the circular DoS.CO.PPG./SEC.03/11.01.005/2020-21 dated \nSeptember 14, 2020  on Automation of Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning \nprocesses in banks (as updated) .  \n4.2.3 Availability of security / net worth of borrower/ guarantor  \n \nThe availability of security or net worth of borrower/ guarantor should not be taken into account \nfor the purpose of treating an advance as NPA or otherwise, except to the extent provided in Para graph 4.2.9. \n4.2.4 Accounts with temporary deficiencies  \n \nThe classification of an asset as NPA should be based on the record of recovery. Bank should not classify an advance account as NPA merely due to the existence of some deficiencies which \nare temporary in nature such as non -availability of adequate drawing power based on the latest \navailable stock statement, balance outstanding exceeding the limit temporarily, non -submission \nof stock statements and non-renewal of the limits on the due date, etc. In the matter of \nclassification of accounts with such deficiencies banks may follow the following guidelines:  \na) Banks should ensure that drawings in the working capital accounts are covered by the \nadequacy of current assets, since current assets are first appropriated in times of distress. \nDrawing power is required to be arrived at based on the stock statement which is current. \nHowever, considering the difficulties of large borrowers, stock statements relied upon by the banks for determi ning drawing power should not be older than three months. The \noutstanding in the account based on drawing power calculated from stock statements \nolder than three months, would be deemed as irregular. \nb) A working capital borrowal account will become NPA if such irregular drawings are \npermitted in the account for a continuous period of 90 days even though the unit may be \nworking or the borrower's financial position is satisfactory.    10 c) Regular and ad hoc  credit limits need to be reviewed/ regularised not later than three \nmonths from the due date/date of ad hoc sanction. In case of constraints such as non-\navailability of financial statements and other data from the borrowers, the branch should \nfurnish evidence to show that renewal/ review of credit limits is already on and would be \ncompleted soon. In any case, delay beyond six months is not considered desirable as a \ngeneral discipline. Hence, an account where the regular/ ad hoc credit limits have not been reviewed/ renewed within 180 days from the due date/ date of ad hoc sanction will \nbe treated as NPA. \n4.2.5 Upgradation of loan accounts classified as NPAs  \n \nIf arrears of interest and principal are paid by the borrower in the case of loan accounts classified \nas NPAs, the account should no longer be treated as nonper forming and may be classified as \n\u2018standard\u2019 accounts. With regard to upgradation of accounts classified as NPA due to \nrestructuring, non-achievement of DCCO, etc., the instructions as specified for suc h cases shall \nbe applicable. \n4.2.6 Accounts regularised  near about the balance sheet date  \n \nThe asset classification of borrowal accounts where a solitary or a few credits are recorded before \nthe balance sheet date should be handled with care and without scope for subjectivity. Where \nthe account indicates inherent weakness on the basis of the data available, the account should \nbe deemed as a NPA. In other genuine cases, the banks must furnish satisfactory evidence to \nthe Statutory Auditors/Inspecting Officers about the manner of regularisation of the account to  \neliminate doubts on their performing status.  \n4.2.7 Asset Classification to be borrower -wise and not facility -wise  \n \n4.2.7.1 It is difficult to envisage a situation when only one facility to a borrower/one \ninvestment in any of the securities issued by the borrower becomes a problem \ncredit/investment and not others. Therefore, all the facilities granted by a bank to a borrower \nand investment in all the securities issued by the borrower will have to be treated as NPA/NPI \nand not the particular facility/invest ment or part thereof which has become irregular. \n4.2.7.2 If the debits arising out of devolvement of letters of credit or invoked guarantees are parked in a separate account, the balance outstanding in that account also should be treated \nas a part of the borrower\u2019s principal operating account for the purpose of application of \nprudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning. \n4.2.7.3 The bills discounted under LC favouring a borrower may not be classified as a Non -\nperforming assets (NPA), when any other facility granted to the borrower is classified as   11 NPA. However, in case documents under LC are not accepted on presentation or the \npayment under the LC is not made on the due date by the LC issuing bank for any reason \nand the borrower does not immediately make good the amount disbursed as a result of \ndiscounting of concerned bills, the outstanding bills discounted will immediately be classified \nas NPA with effect from the date when the other facilities had been classified as NPA. \n4.2.7.4 Derivative Contracts  \na) The overdue receivables representing positive mark -to-market value of a derivative \ncontract will be treated as a non-performing asset, if these remain unpaid for 90 days or \nmore. In case the overdues arising from forward contract s and plain vanilla swaps and \noptions become NPAs, all other funded facilities granted to the client shall also be classified as nonperforming asset following the principle of borrower -wise classification \nas per the existing asset classification norms. However, any amount, representing positive mark -to-market value of the foreign exchange derivative contracts (other than \nforward contract and plain vanilla swaps and options) that were entered into during the period April 2007 to June 2008, which has already  crystallised or might crystallise in \nfuture and is / becomes receivable from the client, should be parked in a separate account maintained in the name of the client / counterparty. This amount, even if overdue for a \nperiod of 90 days or more, will not mak e other funded facilities provided to the client, NPA \non account of the principle of borrower -wise asset classification, though such receivable \noverdue for 90 days or more shall itself be classified as NPA, as per the extant Income \nRecognition and Asset Cl assification (IRAC) norms. The classification of all other assets \nof such clients will, however, continue to be governed by the extant IRAC norms. \nb) If the client concerned is also a borrower of the bank enjoying a Cash Credit or Overdraft \nfacility from the bank, the receivables mentioned at sub-paragraph (a) above may be \ndebited to that account on due date and the impact of its non- payment would be reflected \nin the cash credit / overdraft facility account. The principle of borrower -wise asset \nclassification would be applicable here also, as per extant norms. \nc) In cases where the contract provides for settlement of the current mark -to-market value \nof a derivative contract before its maturity, only the current credit exposure (not the potential future exposure) w ill be classified as a non-performing asset after an overdue \nperiod of 90 days. \nd) As the overdue receivables mentioned above would represent unrealised income already booked by the bank on accrual basis, after 90 days of overdue period, the amount already   12 taken to 'Profit and Loss a/c' should be reversed and held in a \u2018Suspense Account-\nCrystalised Receivables\u2019 in the same manner as done in the case of overdue advances. \ne) Further, in cases where the derivative contracts provides for more settlements in future, \nthe MTM value will comprise of (a) crystallised receivables and (b) positive or negative \nMTM in respect of future receivables. If the derivative contract is not terminated on the overdue receivable remaining unpaid for 90 days, in addition to reversing the crystallised \nreceivable from Profit and Loss Account as stipulated in sub -paragraph (d) above, the \npositive MTM pertaining to future receivables may also be reversed from Profit and Loss \nAccount to another account styled as \u2018Suspense Account \u2013  Positive MTM \u2019. The \nsubsequent positive changes in the MTM value may be credited to the \u2018Suspense \nAccount \u2013 Positive MTM\u2019, not to P&L Account. The subsequent decline in MTM value \nmay be adjusted against the balance in \u2018Suspense Account \u2013  Positive MTM\u2019. If the \nbalance i n this account is not sufficient, the remaining amount may be debited to the P&L \nAccount. On payment of the overdues in cash, the balance in the \u2018Suspense Account-\nCrystalised Receivables\u2019 may be transferred to the \u2018Profit and Loss Account\u2019, to the extent \npayment is received. \nf) If the bank has other derivative exposures on the borrower, it follows that  the MTMs of \nother derivative exposures should also be dealt with / accounted for in the manner as described in sub-paragraph (e) above, subsequent to the crystalised/settlement amount \nin respect of a particular derivative transaction being treated as NPA. \ng) Similarly, in case a fund- based credit facility extended to a borrower is classified as NPA, \nthe MTMs of all the derivative exposures should be treated in the m anner discussed \nabove. \n4.2.8 Advances under consortium arrangements  \n \nAsset classification of accounts under consortium should be based on the record of recovery of the individual member banks and other  aspects having a bearing on the recoverability of the  \nadvances. Where the remittances by the borrower under consortium lending arrangements are \npooled with one bank and/or where the bank receiving remittances is not parting with the share of other member banks, the account will be treated as not serviced in the books of the other \nmember banks and therefore, be treated as NPA. The banks participating in the consortium should, therefore, arrange to get their share of recovery transferred from the lead bank or get an express consent from the lead bank for the tr ansfer of their share of recovery, to ensure proper \nasset classification in their respective books.    13 4.2.9 Accounts where there is erosion in the value of security/frauds committed by  borrowers  \n \n4.2.9.1  In respect of accounts where there are potential threats for r ecovery on account of  \nerosion in the value of security or non-availability of security and existence of other factors \nsuch as frauds committed by borrowers it will not be prudent that such accounts should go \nthrough various stages of asset classification. In cases of such serious credit impairment, the \nasset should be straightaway classified as doubtful or loss asset as appropriate:  \na) Erosion in the value of security can be reckoned as significant when the realisable value of the security is less than 50 per cent of the value assessed by the bank or accepted by \nRBI at the time of last inspection, as the case may be. Such NPAs may be straightaway \nclassified under doubtful category. \nb) If the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank/ approved valuers/ RBI is \nless than 10 per cent of the outstanding in the borrowal accounts, the existence of security \nshould be ignored and the asset should be straightaway classified as loss asset.  \n \n4.2.9.2  Provisioning norms in respect of all cases of fraud:  \na) Banks should norm ally provide for the entire amount due to the bank or for which the \nbank is liable (including in case of deposit accounts), immediately upon a fraud being detected. \nWhile computing the provisioning requirement, banks may adjust financial collateral eligibl e \nunder Basel III Capital Regulations - Capital Charge for Credit Risk (Standardised Approach), \nif any, available with them with regard to the accounts declared as fraud account;  \nb) However, to smoothen the effect of such provisioning on quarterly profit and loss, \nbanks have the option to make the provisions over a period, not exceeding four quarters, \ncommencing from the quarter in which the fraud has been detected;  \nc) Where the bank chooses to provide for the fraud over two to four quarters and this \nresults in the full provisioning being made in more than one financial year, banks should debit \n'other reserves' [i.e., reserves other than the one created in terms of Section 17(2) of the \nBanking Regulation Act 1949] by the amount remaining un-provided at the end of the financial \nyear by credit to provisions. However, banks should proportionately reverse the debits to \u2018other \nreserves\u2019 and complete the provisioning by debiting profit and loss account, in the subsequent \nquarters of the next financial year; \nd) Banks shall m ake suitable disclosures with regard to number of frauds reported, \namount involved in such frauds, quantum of provision made during the year and quantum of \nunamortised provision debited from \u2018other reserves\u2019 as at the end of the year.   14 4.2.10 Advances to Pr imary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS)/Farmers\u2019 Service Societies (FSS) \nceded to Commercial Banks  \n \nIn respect of agricultural advances as well as advances for other purposes granted by banks to \nPACS/ FSS under the on-lending system, only that particul ar credit facility granted to PACS/ FSS \nwhich is in default for a period of two crop seasons in case of short duration crops and one crop \nseason in case of long duration crops, as the case may be, after it has become due will be \nclassified as NPA and not all the credit facilities sanctioned to a PACS/ FSS. The other direct \nloans & advances, if any, granted by the bank to the member borrower of a PACS/ FSS outside \nthe on-lending arrangement will become NPA even if one of the credit facilities granted to the \nsame borrower becomes NPA. \n4.2.11 Advances against Term Deposits, NSCs, KVPs/IVPs, etc.  \n  \nAdvances against term deposits, NSCs eligible for surrender, IVPs, KVPs and life  policies need \nnot be treated as NPAs, provided adequate margin is available in the ac counts. Advances against \ngold ornaments, government securities and all other securities are not covered by this exemption. \n4.2.12  Loans with moratorium for payment of interest  \n \n4.2.12.1 In the case of bank finance given for industrial projects or for agricultural plantations \netc. where moratorium is available for payment of interest, payment of interest becomes 'due' \nonly after the moratorium or gestation period is over. Therefore, such amounts of interest do \nnot become overdue and hence do not become NPA, with r eference to the date of debit of \ninterest. They become overdue after  due date for payment of interest, if uncollected.  \n4.2.12.2. In the case of housing loan or similar advances granted to staff members where \ninterest is payable after recovery of principal, interest need not be considered as overdue from \nthe first quarter onwards. Such loans/advances should be classified as NPA only when there \nis a default in repayment of instalment of principal or payment of interest on the respective \ndue dates.  \n4.2.13  Agricultura l advances  \n \n4.2.13.1  A loan granted for short duration crops will be treated as NPA, if the instalment of \nprincipal or interest thereon remains overdue for two crop seasons. A loan granted for long \nduration crops will be treated as NPA, if the instalment of princ ipal or interest thereon remains \noverdue for one crop season. For the purpose of these guidelines, \u201clong duration\u201d crops would \nbe crops with crop season longer than one year and crops, which are not \u201clong duration\u201d \ncrops, would be treated as \u201cshort duration\u201d crops. The crop season for each crop, which means the period up to harvesting of the crops raised, would be as determined by the State   15 Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) in each State. Depending upon the duration of crops \nraised by an agriculturist, the above NPA norms would also be made applicable to agricultural \nterm loans availed of by him. \n \n4.2.13.2  The above norms should be made applicable only to Farm Credit extended to \nagricultural activities as listed at Annex - 2. In respect of agricultural loans, other than those \nspecified in the Annex - 2, identification of NPAs would be done on the same basis as non-\nagricultural advances, which, at present, is the 90 days delinquency norm.  \n \n4.2.13.3  Where natural calamities impair the repaying capacity of agricultural borrowers for \nthe purposes specified in Annex - 2, banks may decide on their own as a relief measure \nconversion of the short-term production loan into a term loan or re-schedulement of the \nrepayment period; and the sanctioning of fresh short-term loan, subject to Ma ster Direction \u2013  \nReserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural Calamities) \nDirections 2018 \u2013  SCBs dated October 17, 2018, as updated from time to time.  \n \n4.2.13.4  In such cases of conversion or re-schedulement, the term loan as well as fresh short-\nterm loan may be treated as current dues and need not be classified as NPA. The asset \nclassification of these loans would thereafter be governed by the revised terms & conditions \nand would be treated as NPA if interest and/or instalment of principal remains overdue for two crop seasons for short duration crops and for one crop season for long duration crops.  \n \n4.2.13.5  While fixing the repayment schedule in case of rural housing advances granted to \nagriculturists under Indira Awas Yojana and Golden J ubilee Rural Housing Finance Scheme, \nbanks should ensure that the interest/instalment payable on such advances are linked to crop \ncycles.  \n4.2.14  Government guaranteed advances  \n \n4.2.14.1  The credit facilities backed by guarantee of the Central Government though \noverdue ma y be treated as NPA only when the Government repudiates its guarantee when \ninvoked. This exemption from classification of Government guaranteed advances as NPA is \nnot for the purpose of recognition of income.  \n4.2.14.2  The requirement of invocation of guarantee has  been delinked for deciding the \nasset classification and provisioning requirements in respect of State Government guaranteed \nexposures.     16 4.2.14.3 With effect from the year ending March 31, 2006 State Government guaranteed \nadvances and investments in State Governmen t guaranteed securities would attract asset \nclassification and provisioning norms if interest and/or principal or any other  amount due to \nthe bank remains overdue for more than 90 days. \n4.2.15  Projects under implementation  \n4.2.15.1 \u2018Date of Commencement of Commercial Operations\u2019 (DCCO ) \nFor all projects financed by the FIs/ banks, the DCCO  of the project should be clearly spelt \nout at the time of financial closure of the project and the same should be formally documented. \nThese should also be documented in the appraisal note by the bank during sanction of the loan. \n4.2.15.2 Deferment of DCCO  \n(i) There are occasions when the completion of projects is delayed for legal and other \nextraneous reasons like delays in Government approvals etc. All these factors, which are \nbeyond the control  of the promoters, may lead to delay in project implementation and \ninvolve restructuring / reschedulement of loans by banks. Accordingly, the following asset classification norms would apply to the project loans before commencement of commercial operations . \n(ii) For this purpose, all project loans have been divided into the following two \ncategories:  \na) Project Loans for infrastructure sector  \nb) Project Loans for non-infrastructure sector  \n\u2018Project Loan \u2019 would mean any term loan which has been extended for the purpose of \nsetting up of an economic venture. Further, Infrastructure Sector is a sector included in the \nHarmonised Master List of Infrastructure sub- sectors issued by the Department of \nEconomic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, from time to time.  \n(iii)  Deferment of DCCO and consequential shift in repayment schedule for equal or \nshorter duration (including the start date and end date of revised repayment schedule) will \nnot be treated as restructuring provided that: \na) The revised DCCO falls withi n the period of two years and one year from the \noriginal DCCO stipulated at the time of financial closure for infrastructure projects \nand non -infrastructure projects (including commercial real estate projects) \nrespectively; and    17 b) All other terms and conditio ns of the loan remain unchanged.  \nAs such project loans will be treated as standard assets in all respects, they will attract \nstandard asset provision of 0.40 per cent.  \n(iv)  Banks may restructure project loans, by way of revision of DCCO beyond the time \nlimits quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2 (iii)(a) above and retain the \u2018standard\u2019 asset \nclassification, if the fresh DCCO is fixed within the following limits, and the account continues to be serviced as per the restructured terms: \na) Infrastructure Projects involving court cases  \nUp to another two years (beyond the two year period quoted at Paragraph \n4.2.15.2 (iii)(a)  above, i.e., total extension of four years), in case the reason for \nextension of DCCO is arbitration proceedings or a court case. \nb) Infrastructure Projects  delayed for other reasons beyond the control of promoters  \nUp to another one year (beyond the two year period quoted at Paragraph \n4.2.15.2 (iii)(a) above, i.e., total extension of three years), in case the reason for \nextension of DCCO is beyond the control of promoters (other than court cases). \nc) Project Loans for Non-Infrastructure Sector  (Other than Commercial Real Estate \nExposures)  \nUp to another one year (beyond the one year period quoted at Paragraph \n4.2.15.2 (iii)(a)  above, i.e., total extension of two yea rs). \nd) Project  Loans for Commercial Real Estate Exposures  delayed for reasons \nbeyond the control of promoter(s)  \nUp to another one year (beyond the one year period quoted at Paragraph \n4.2.15.2 (iii)(a)  above, i.e., total extension of two years), provided that the revised \nrepayment schedule is extended only by a period equal to or shorter than the extension \nin DCCO and all provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 \nare complied with. \n(v) It is re-iterated that a loan for a project may be classified as NPA during any time before \ncommencement of commercial operations as per record of recovery (90 days overdue). It \nis further re -iterated that the dispensation at Paragraph 4.2.15.2  (iv) is subject to the \ncondition that the application for restructuring should be received before the expiry of \nperiod mentioned at Paragraph 4.2.15.2  (iii) (a) above and when the account is still \nstandard as per record of recovery. The other conditions applicable would be:   18 a) In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest, banks should not \nbook income on accrual basis beyond two years and one year from the original DCCO \nfor infrastructure and non-infrastructure projects (including commercial real estate \nprojects) respectively, considering the high risk inv olved in such restructured \naccounts.  \nb) Banks should maintain following provisions on such accounts as long as these \nare classified as standard assets : \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n(vi) In case of infrastructure projects, where Appointed Date (as defined in the concession  \nagreement) is shifted due to the i nability of the Concession Authority to comply with the \nrequisite conditions, change  in date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO) \nneed not be treated as \u2018restructuring\u2019, subject to following conditions:  \na) The project is an infrastructure project under public private partnership model \nawarded by a public authority; \nb) The loan disbursement is yet to begin; \nc) The revised date of commencement of commercial operations is documented \nby way of a supplementary agreement between the borrower and lender and; \nd) Project viability has been reassessed and sanction from appropriate authority \nhas been obtained at the time of supplementary agreement. Particulars  Provisioning \nRequirement  \nIf the revised DCCO is within two years/one year from the \noriginal DC CO prescribed at the time of financial closure for \ninfrastructure and non-infrastructure projects (including \ncommerical real estate projects) respectively  0.40 per cent  \nIf the DCCO is extended:  \ni) Beyond two years and upto four years or three years \nfrom t he original DCCO, as the case may be, for \ninfrastructure projects depending upon the reasons for \nsuch delay ; \nii) Beyond one years and upto two years from the original \nDCCO, for non-infrastructure projects (including real \nestate projects)  5.00 per cent \u2013 From the \ndate of such restructuring till the revised DCCO or 2 \nyears from the date of \nrestructuring, whichever is \nlater   19 4.2.15.3  Projects under Implementation \u2013  Change in Ownership  \n4.2.15.3.1 In order to facilitate revival of the projects stalled primarily due to  \ninadequacies of the current promoters, if a change in ownership takes place any time \nduring the periods quoted in Paragraph 4.2.15.2  above or before the original DCCO, \nbanks may permit extension of the DCCO of the project up to two years in addition to the periods quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2  above, as the case may be, without any \nchange in asset classification of the account subject to the conditions stipulated in the \nfollowing paragraphs. Banks may also consequentially shift/extend repayment schedule, i f required, by an equal or shorter duration. \n \n4.2.15.3.2 In cases where change in ownership and extension of DCCO (as \nindicated in Paragraph 4.2.15.3.1 above) takes place before the original DCCO, and if \nthe project fails to commence commercial operations by the extended DCCO, the \nproject will be eligible for further extension of DCCO in terms of guidelines quoted at \nParagraph 4.2.15.2  above. Similarly, where change in ownership and extension of \nDCCO takes place during the period quoted in Paragraph 4.2.15.2 (iii)(a)  above, the \naccount may still be restructured by extension of DCCO in terms of guidelines quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2 (iv) above, without classifying the account as non-performing \nasset.  \n4.2.15.3.3 The provisions of Paragraphs 4.2.15.3 .1 and 4.2.15.3 .2 above are \nsubjec t to the following conditions:  \na) Banks should establish that implementation of the project is stalled/affected \nprimarily due to inadequacies of the current promoters/management and with a \nchange in ownership there is a very high probability of commencement of \ncommercial operations by the project within the extended period; \nb) The project in consideration should be taken- over/acquired by a new \npromoter/promoter group with sufficient expertise in the field of operation. If the \nacquisition is being carried out by a special purpose vehicle (domestic or \noverseas), the bank should be able to clearly demonstrate that the acquiring entity \nis part of a new promoter group with sufficient expertise in the field of operation;  \nc) The new promoters should own at least 51 per cent of the paid up equity \ncapital of stake in the acquired project. If the new promoter is a non-resident, and \nin sectors where the ceiling on foreign investment is less than 51 per cent, the new \npromoter should own atleast 26 per cent of the paid up equity c apital or up to \napplicable foreign investment limit, whichever is higher, provided banks are   20 satisfied that with this equity stake the new non-resident promoter controls the \nmanagement of the project; \nd) Viability of the project  should be established to the s atisfaction of the banks.  \ne) Intra-group business  restructuring/mergers/acquisitions  and/or  \ntakeover/acquisition of the project by other entities/subsidiaries/associates etc. \n(domestic as well as overseas), belonging to the existing promoter/promoter group \nwill not qualify for this facility. The banks should clearly establish that the acquirer \ndoes not belong to the existing promoter group; \nf) Asset  classification of the account as on the \u2018reference date\u2019 would continue \nduring the extended period. For this purpos e, the \u2018reference date\u2019 would be the \ndate of execution of preliminary binding agreement between the parties to the \ntransaction, provided that the acquisition/takeover of ownership as per the \nprovisions of law/regulations governing such acquisition/takeover  is completed \nwithin a period of 90 days from the date of execution of preliminary binding \nagreement. During the intervening period, the usual asset classification norms \nwould continue to apply. If the change in ownership is not completed within 90 \ndays fr om the preliminary binding agreement, the \u2018reference date\u2019 would be the \neffective date of acquisition/takeover as per the provisions of law/regulations \ngoverning such acquisition/takeover; \ng) The new owners/promoters are expected to demonstrate their commitme nt by \nbringing in substantial portion of additional monies required to complete the project \nwithin the extended time period. As such, treatment of financing of cost overruns \nfor the project shall be subject to the guidelines prescribed in Paragraph 4.2.15. 5 \nof this circular. Financing of cost overrun beyond the ceiling prescribed in \nParagraph 4.2.15.5  of this circular would be treated as an event of restructuring \neven if the extension of DCCO is within the limits prescribed above; \nh) While considering the extension of DCCO (up to an additional period of 2 \nyears) for the benefits envisaged hereinabove, banks shall make sure that the \nrepayment schedule does not extend beyond 85 per cent of the economic \nlife/concession period of the project; and \ni) This facility woul d be available to a project only once before achievement of \nDCCO  and w ill not be available during subsequent change in ownership, if any. \n4.2.15.3.4 Loans covered under  this guideline would attract provisioning as per the \nextant provisioning norms depending upon their asset classification status.   21 4.2.15.4 Deemed DCCO  \n4.2.15.4.1 A project with multiple independent units may be deemed to have \ncommenced commercial operations from the date when the independent units \nrepresenting 50 per cent (or higher) of the originally envisaged capacity have \ncommenced commercial production of the final output as originally envisaged, subject \nto the following conditions: \na. The units representing remaining 50 per cent (or lower) of the originally \nenvisaged capacity shall commence commercial operations within a \nmaximum period of one year from the deemed date of commencement \nof commercial operations; \nb. Commercial viability of the project is reassessed beyond doubt; and \nc. Capitalisation of interest obligation in respect of project debt \ncomponent attributable to the units of the plant which have \ncommenced commercial operations has to cease and the revenue expenditure is booked under revenue account.  \n4.2.15.4.2 In such cases, banks may, at their discretion, also effect a \nconsequential  shift in  repayment schedule of the debt attributable to units which have \nnot commenced commercial operations for equal or shorter duration (including the start \ndate and end date of revised repayment schedule) i.e., one year, subject to no other \nchanges being carried out.  \n 4.2.15.4.3 If the remaining units do not commence commercial operations within \nthe stipulated time of one year at p aragraph 4.2.15.4.1 (a) above, the account shall be \ntreated as non-performing asset and the provisions shall be made accordingly.  \n4.2.15.5 Financing of Cost Overruns for Projects  under Implementation \n4.2.15.5.1 Internationally, project finance lenders sanction a \u2018standby credit facility\u2019 \nto fund cost overruns if needed. Such \u2018standby credit facilities\u2019 are sanctioned at the \ntime of initial financial closure; but disbursed only when there is a cost overrun. At the \ntime of credit assessment of borrowers/project, such cost overruns are also taken into \naccount while determining the project Debt Equity Ratio, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, \nFixed Asset Coverage Ratio etc. Such \u2018standby credit facilities\u2019 rank pari passu with \nbase project loans and their repayment schedule is also the same as that of the base \nproject loans.   22  \n4.2.15.5.2 Accordingly, in cases where banks have specifically sanctioned a \n\u2018standby facility\u2019 at the time of initial financial closure to fund cost overruns, they may \nfund cost overruns as per the agreed terms and conditions.  \n \n4.2.15.5.3 Where the initial financial closure does not envisage such financing of \ncost overruns, banks are allow ed to fund cost overruns, which may arise on account of \nextension of DCCO upto two years and one year from the original DCCO stipulated at \nthe time of financial closure for infrastructure projects and non-infrastructure projects  \n(including commercial real estate projects)  respectively, without treating the loans as \n\u2018restructured asset\u2019 , subject to the following conditions:  \na) Banks may fund additional \u2018Interest During Construction\u2019, which may arise on \naccount of delay in completion of a project;  \nb) Other cost overruns (excluding Interest During Construction) up to a maximum \nof 10% of the original project cost;  \nc) The Debt Equity Ratio as agreed at the time of initial financial closure should \nremain unchanged subsequent to funding cost overruns or improve in favour of the \nlenders and the revised Debt Service Coverage Ratio should be acceptable to the \nlenders;  \nd) Disbursement of funds for cost overruns should start only after the \nSponsors/Promoters bring in their share of funding of the cost overruns; and \ne) All other terms and conditions of the loan should remain unchanged or \nenhanced in favour of the lenders.  \n4.2.15.5.4 The ceiling of 10 per cent of the original project cost prescribed in \nParagraph 4.2.15.5.3 (b) above is applicable to financing of all other cost overruns \n(excluding interest during construction), including cost overruns on account of \nfluctuations in the value of Indian Rupee against other currencies, arising out of \nextension of date of commencement of commercial operations. \n4.2.15.6 Other Issues  \n4.2.15.6.1 All other aspects of restructuring of project loans before \ncommencement of commercial operations w ould be governed by the provisions of \nParts B-1 and B -2 of this Master Circular . Restructuring of project loans after \ncommencement of commercial operations will also be governed by these instructions.   23  \n4.2.15.6.2 Any change in the repayment schedule of a project loan  caused due to \nan increase in the project outlay on account of increase in scope and size of the project, \nwould not be treated as restructuring if: \na) The increase in scope and size of the project takes place before \ncommencement of commercial operations of the existing project.  \nb) The rise in cost excluding any cost-overrun in respect of the original project is \n25% or more of the original outlay. \nc) The bank re-assesses the viability of the project before approving the \nenhancement of scope and fixing a fresh DCCO. \nd) On re-rating, (if already rated) the new rating is not below the previous rating \nby more than one notch.  \n4.2.15.6.3  Multiple revisions  of the DCCO and consequential shift in repayment \nschedule for equal or shorter duration (including the start date and end date of rev ised \nrepayment schedule) will be treated as a single event of restructuring  provided that \nthe revised DCCO is fixed within the respective time limits stipulated at Paragraph \n4.2.15.2(iv) above, and all other terms and conditions of the loan remained \nunchanged.  \n \n4.2.15.6.4 Banks, if deemed fit, may extend DCCO beyond the respective  time \nlimits stipulated at Paragraph 4.2.15. 2(iv) above; however, in that case, banks will not \nbe able to retain the \u2018standard\u2019 asset classification status of such loan accounts.  \n \n4.2.15.6.5 In all the above cases of restructuring where regulatory forbearance has \nbeen extended, the Boards of banks should satisfy themselves about the viability of \nthe project and the restructuring plan. \n4.2.15.7 Asset classification and Income recognition for projects under implementation \nrelating to Deferment of DCCO and Cost Overruns  \n4.2.15.7.1 In cases where DCCO is extended within the periods stipulated in \nParagraph 4.2.15.2  and funding of cost overruns complies with the \nthresholds/conditions stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.5 , such loans shall be treated as \n\u2018standard\u2019 in all respects. \n   24 4.2.15.7.2 In cases where DCCO is extended within the periods stipulated in \nParagraph 4.2.15.2 , but funding of cost overruns does not comply with the \nthresholds/conditions stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.5 , such loans shall be treated as \n\u2018restructured standard\u2019 and attract a provision of 5 per cent from the date of such \nrestructuring till the commencement of commercial operations or 2 years from the date \nof restructuring, whichever is later. These loans may be upgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 \ncategory once the entire project commences commercial operations.  \n 4.2.15.7.3 In cases where DCCO is extended beyond the periods stipulated in \nParagraph 4.2.15.2  (iii) but upto periods stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iv ) and \nfunding of cost overruns compl ies with the thresholds/conditions stipulated in \nParagraph 4.2.15.5 , such loans shall be treated as \u2018restructured standard\u2019 and attract \na provision of 5 per cent from the date of such restructuring till the commencement of \ncommercial operations or 2 years from the date of restructuring, whichever is later. \nThese loans may be upgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 category once the entire project \ncommences commercial operations.  \n \n4.2.15.7.4 In cases where DCCO is extended beyond the periods stipulated in \nparagraph 4.2.15.2(iii)  but upto periods stipulated in p aragraph 4.2.15.2(iv)  and funding \nof cost overruns does not comply with the thresholds/conditions stipulated in paragraph \n4.2.15.5 , such loans will be treated as \u2018non-performing asset\u2019. These loans may be \nupgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 category only after the account performs satisfactorily during the \u2018monitoring period\u2019 post DCCO;  \n 4.2.15.7.5 Any changes to the major terms and conditions of the original project \nloans (i.e. promoters equity contribution, interest rate, etc.) of a borrower with financ ial \ndifficulties, except what is specifically allowed such as changes in the DCCO, \nconsequential parallel shift in repayment schedule and funding of cost overruns, as \npermitted within the thresholds, shall be treated as an event of \u2018restructuring\u2019 requirin g \nthe accounts to be classified as \u2018non-performing asset\u2019 and provided for accordingly. \nThese loans may be upgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 category only after the account performs \nsatisfactorily during the \u2018monitoring period\u2019 post DCCO.  \n 4.2.15.7.6 Banks may treat need based working capital sanctioned to projects after \ncommencement of commercial operations as \u2018standard\u2019 irrespective of the asset \nclassification category of the project loans, subject to satisfactory performance of such \nworking capital accounts. Banks shall ensur e that assessment of working capital loans   25 are strictly need based and banks shall desist from over -financing. If the project loans \nclassified as \u2018non-performing asset\u2019 do not perform satisfactorily during the \u2018monitoring \nperiod\u2019 and therefore fail to get upgraded to \u2018standard\u2019 category, then the working \ncapital loans also shall be placed in the same asset classification category as that of \nproject loans on completion of \u2018monitoring period\u2019. \n4.2.15.8  Income recognition  \n4.2.15.8.1 Banks  may recognise income on accrual basis i n respect of the projects \nunder implementation, which are classified as \u2018standard\u2019.  \n \n4.2.15.8.2 Banks should not recognise income on accrual basis in respect of the \nprojects under implementation which are classified as a \u2018substandard\u2019 asset. Banks \nmay recognise incom e in such accounts only on realisation  i.e. on cash basis.  \n \n4.2.15.8.3 The regulatory treatment of FITL / debt / equity instruments created  by \nconversion of principal / unpaid interest, as the case may be, shall be as per paragraph \n21 of Part B2 of this Master Circ ular.  \n4.2.16  Post -shipment Supplier's Credit \n \n4.2.16.1 In respect of post-shipment credit extended by the banks covering export of \ngoods to countries for which the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation\u2019s  (ECGC) cover is \navailable, EXIM Bank has introduced a guarantee- cum-refinance programme whereby, in \nthe event of default, EXIM Bank will pay the guaranteed amount to the bank within a period \nof 30 days from the day the bank invokes the guarantee after the exporter has filed claim \nwith ECGC.  \n 4.2.16.2 Accordingly, to the extent paym ent has been received from the EXIM Bank, \nthe advance may not be treated as a non performing asset for asset classification and \nprovisioning purposes.  \n4.2.17  Export Project Finance  \n \n4.2.17.1 In respect of export project finance, there could be instances where the actual \nimporter has paid the dues to the bank abroad but the bank in turn is unable to remit the \namount due to political developments such as war, strife, UN  embargo, etc.  \n4.2.17.2 In such cases, where the lending bank is able to establish through \ndocumentary evidence that the importer has cleared the dues in full by depositing the amount \nin the bank abroad before it turned into NPA in the books of the bank, but the importer's   26 country is not allowing the funds to be remitted due to political or other reasons, the asset \nclassification may be made after a period of one year  from the date the amount was \ndeposited by the importer in the bank abroad.  \n4.2.18  Transfer of Loan Exposures  \n \nThe asset classification and provisioning requirements in respect of transactions involving transfer of loans shall be as per the Reserve Bank of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) \nDirections, 2021. \n4.2.19  Credit Card Accounts  \n4.2.19.1 In credit card accounts, the amount spent is billed to the card users through \na monthly statement with a definite due date for repayment. Banks give an option to the card \nusers to pay either the full amount or a fraction of it, i.e., minimum amount due, on the due date and roll -over the balance amount to the subsequent months\u2019 billing cycle.  \n 4.2.19.2 A credit card account will be treated as non-perf orming asset if the minimum \namount due, as mentioned in the statement, is not paid fully within 90 days from the payment \ndue date mentioned in the statement. \n \n4.2.19.3 Banks shall report a credit card account as \u2018past due\u2019 to credit information \ncompanies (CICs) or levy penal charges, viz. late payment charges, etc., if any, only when a \ncredit card account remains \u2018past due\u2019 for more than three days. The number of \u2018days past due\u2019 and late payment charges shall, however, be computed from the payment due date \nmentioned in the credit card statement. \n5. PROVISIONING NORMS \n5.1 General  \n \n5.1.1 The primary responsibility for making adequate provisions for any diminution in the value of \nloan assets, investment or other assets is that of the bank managements and the statutory auditors . \nThe assessment made by the inspecting officer of the RBI is furnished to the bank to assist the bank management and the statutory auditors in taking a decision in regard to making adequate \nand necessary  provisions in terms of prudential guidelines.  \n5.1.2 In conformity with the prudential norms, provisions should be made on the non performing \nassets on the basis of classification of assets into prescribed  categories as detailed in paragraph \n4 supra. Taking into account the time lag between an account becomi ng doubtful of recovery, its \nrecognition as such, the realisation of the security and the erosion over time in the value of security   27 charged to the bank, the banks should make provision against substandard assets, doubtful assets \nand loss assets as below . \n5.2 Loss assets  \nLoss assets should be written off. If loss assets are permitted to remain in the books  for any reason, \n100 percent of the outstanding should be provided for. \n5.3 Doubtful assets  \n5.3.1 100 percent of the extent to which the advance is not covered by the r ealisable value \nof the security to which the bank has a valid recourse and the realisable value is estimated on a \nrealistic basis. \n \n5.3.2 In regard to the secured portion, provision may be made on the following basis, at the \nrates ranging from 25 percent to 100 percent of the secured portion depending upon the period for \nwhich the asset has remained doubtful: \nPeriod for which the advance has  \nremained in \u2018doubtful\u2019 category  Provision ing require ment  \n(%) \n Up to one year  25 \nOne to three years  40 \nMore than thre e years  100 \n \n5.3.3 With a view to bringing down divergence arising out of difference in assessment of the \nvalue of security, in cases of NPAs with balance of \u20b95 crore and above stock audit at annual \nintervals by external agencies appointed as per the guidelines approved by the Board would be \nmandatory in order to enhance the reliability on stock valuation. Collaterals such as immovable \nproperties charged in fav our of the bank should be got valued once in three years by valuers \nappointed as per the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.  \n5.4 Substandard assets  \n \n5.4.1 A general provision of 15 percent on total outstanding should be made without making any \nallowance for ECGC guarantee cover and securities available.  \n \n5.4.2 The \u2018unsecured exposures\u2019 which are identified as \u2018substandard\u2019 would attract additional \nprovision of 10 per cent, i.e., a total of 25 per cent on the outstanding balance. However, in view \nof certain safeguards such as escrow accounts available in respect of infrastructure lending, \ninfrastructure loan accounts which are classified as sub- standard will attract a provisioning of 20 per \ncent instead of the aforesaid prescription of 25 per cent.  To avail of this benefit of lower provisioning,   28 the banks should have in place an appropriate mechanism to escrow the cash flows and also have \na clear and legal first claim on these cash flows.  \n \n5.4.2 The provisioning requirement for unsecured \u2018doubtful\u2019  assets is 100 per cent. Unsecured \nexposure is defined as an exposure where the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the \nbank/approved valuers/Reserve Bank\u2019s inspecting officers, is not more than 10 percent, ab-initio, of \nthe outstanding exposu re. \u2018Exposure\u2019 shall include all funded and non- funded exposures (including \nunderwriting and similar commitments). \u2018Security\u2019 will mean tangible security properly charged to \nthe bank and will not include intangible securities like guarantees (including State government \nguarantees), comfort letters etc.  \n \n5.4.3 In order to enhance transparency and ensure correct reflection of the unsecured advances  \nin Schedule 9 of the banks' balance sheet, it is advised that the following would be applicable from \nthe financial year 2009-10 onwards: \na) For determining the amount of unsecured advances for reflecting in schedule 9 of the published balance sheet, the rights, licenses, authorisations, etc., charged to the \nbanks as collateral in respect of projects (including infr astructure projects) financed \nby them, should not be reckoned as tangible security. Hence such advances shall be \nreckoned as unsecured.  \nb) However, banks may treat annuities under build-operate-transfer (BOT) model in \nrespect of road / highway projects and toll collection rights, where there are provisions \nto compensate the project sponsor if a certain level of traffic is not achieved, as \ntangible securities subject to the condition that banks' right to receive annuities and \ntoll collection rights is legally enforceable and irrevocable. \nc) It is noticed that most of the infrastructure projects, especially road/highway projects \nare user -charge based, for which the Planning Commission has published Model \nConcession Agreements (MCAs). These have been adopted by various Ministries and \nState Governments for their respective public -private partnership (PPP) projects and \nthey provide adequate comfort to the lenders regarding security of their debt. In view \nof the above features, in case of PPP projects, the debts due to t he lenders may be \nconsidered as secured to the extent assured by the project authority in terms of the \nConcession Agreement, subj ect to the following conditions : \ni. User charges / toll / tariff payments are kept in an escrow account where senior \nlenders have priority over withdrawals by the concessionaire;   29 ii. There is sufficient risk mitigation, such as pre-determined increase in user \ncharges or increase in concession period, in case project revenues are lower \nthan anticipated; \niii. The lenders have a right of substitution in case of concessionaire default;  \niv. The lenders have a right to trigger termination in case of default in debt service; \nand \nv. Upon termination, the Project Authority has an obligation of (i) compulsory  \nbuy-out and (ii) repayment of debt due in a pre-det ermined manner. \nvi. In all such cases, banks must satisfy themselves about the legal enforceability of the provisions of the tripartite agreement and factor in their past experience \nwith such contracts.  \nd) Banks should also disclose the total amount of advances for which intangible \nsecurities such as charge over the rights, licenses, authority, etc. has been taken as \nalso the estimated value  of such intangible collateral. The disclosure may be made \nunder a separate head in \"Notes to Accounts\". This would differentiate such loans \nfrom other entirely unsecured loans.  \n5.5 Standard assets  \n5.5.1 The provisioning requirements for all types of standard assets stands as below. Banks \nshould make general provision for standard assets at the following rates for the funded \noutstanding on global loan portfolio basis:  \na) Farm Credit to agricultural activities , individual housing loans  and Small and Micro \nEnterprises (SMEs) sectors at 0.25 per cent;  \nb) advances to Commercial Real Estate (CRE)1 Sector at 1.00 per cent;  \nc) advances to Commercial Real Estate \u2013  Residential Housing Sector (CRE - RH)2 \nat 0.75 per cent \nd) housing loans extended at teaser rates as indicated in Para graphs  5.9.9 ; \ne) restructured advances \u2013 as stipulated in the prudential norms for restructuring of \nadvances. \n                                                      \n1 CRE as defined in terms of the circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.42/08.12.015/2009-10 dated September 9, 2009  on \u2018Guidelines \non Classification of Exposures as Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Exposures\u2019  \n2 CRE -RH as defined in the circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.104/08.12.015/2012-13 dated June 21, 2013  on \u2018Housing Sector: New \nsub-sector CRE (Residential Housing) within CRE & Rationalisation of provisioning, risk -weight and LTV ratios\u2019    30 f) Advances restructured and classified as s tandard in terms of the Master Direction \u2013 \nReserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural \nCalamities) Directions 2018 \u2013  SCBs, as updated from time to time, at 5%. \ng) All other loans and advances not included in (a) \u2013 (f) above at 0.40 per cent. \n5.5.2 The provisions on standard assets should not be reckoned for arriving at net NPAs. \n \n5.5.3 The provisions  towards Standard Assets need not be netted from gross advances  but \nshown separately as 'Contingent Provisions against Standard As sets' under 'Other Liabilities \nand Provisions Others' in Schedule 5 of the balance sheet. \n \n5.5.4 It is clarified that the Medium Enterprises will attract 0.40% standard asset provisioning. \nThe definition of the terms Micro Enterprises, Small Enterprises, and Medium Enterprises shall \nbe in terms of the circular FIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.3/06.02.31/2020-21 dated July 2, 2020  on \n\u2018Credit flow to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Sector\u2019 as updated from time to time.  \n 5.5.5 A high level  of unhedged foreign currency exposures of the entities can increase the \nprobability of default in times of high currency volatility. Hence, banks are required to estimate the riskiness of unhedged position of their borrowers as per the instructions contained in our \ncircular DBOD.No.BP.BC.85/21.06.200/2013-14 dated January 15, 2014 as well as our \ncircular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.116/21.06.200/2013-14 dated June 3, 2014  and make incremental provisions \non their exposures to such entities:  \n \nLikely Loss / EBID (%)  Incremental Provisioning Requirement  on the  total credit \nexposures over and above extant  \nstandard asset provisioning \nUpto 15 per cent  0 \nMore than 15 per cent and \nupto 30 per cent 20bps  \nMore than 30 per cent and \nupto 50 per cent 40bps  \nMore than 50 per cent and \nupto 75 per cent 60bps  \nMore than 75 per cent  80 bps  \nFor this purpose, EBID, as defined for computation of DSCR = Profit After Tax + Depreciation + \nInterest on debt + Lease Rentals, if any.    31 5.6 Prudential norms on creation  and utilisation of floating provisions  \n \n5.6.1 Principle  for creation of floating provisions by banks  \nThe bank's board of directors should lay down approved policy regarding the level to which the \nfloating provisions can be created. The bank should hold floating provisions for \u2018advances\u2019 and \u2018investments\u2019 separately and the guidelines prescribed will be applicable to floating provisions held \nfor both \u2018advances\u2019 & \u2018investmen t portfolios.  \n5.6.2 Principle for utilisation of floating provisions by banks  \n5.6.2.1 The floating provisions should not be used for making specific provisions as per the \nextant prudential guidelines in respect of non performing assets or for making regulatory provisions for standard assets. The floating provisions can be used only for contingencies \nunder extraordinary  circumstances for making specific provisions in impaired accounts after \nobtaining board\u2019s approval and with prior permission of RBI. The Boards of the banks should lay down an approved policy as to what circumstances would be considered extraordinary.  \n5.6.2.2 To facilitate banks' Boards to evolve suitable policies in this regard, it is clarified that \nthe extra-ordinary circumstances refer to losses which do not arise in the normal course of \nbusiness and are exceptional and non-recurring in nature. These extra-ordinary circumstances \ncould broadly fall under three categories viz. General, Market and Credit. Under general \ncategory, there can be situations where bank is put unexpectedly to loss due to events such \nas civil unrest or collapse of currency in a country. Natural calamities and pandemics may also \nbe included in the general category. Market category would include events such as a general \nmelt down in the markets, which affects the entire financial system. Among the credit category, \nonly exceptional credit losses would be consider ed as an extra-ordinary circumstance. \n5.6.2.3 In order to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID 19 related stress on banks, as a \nmeasure to enable capital conservation, banks are allowed to utilise 100 per cent of floating provisions held by them as on December 31, 2020 for making specific provisions for non-\nperforming assets with prior approval of their Boards. Such utilisation is permitted upto March \n31, 2022. \n5.6.3 Accounting   \nFloating provisions cannot be reversed by credit to the profit and loss account. They can only be \nutilised for making specific provisions in extraordinary circumstances as mentioned above. Until \nsuch utilisation, these provisions can be netted off from gross NPAs to arrive at disclosure of net \nNPAs. Alternatively, they can be treated as part of Tier II capital wit hin the overall ceiling of 1.25%  \nof total risk weighted assets.    32 5.6.4 Disclosures   \nBanks should make comprehensive disclosures on floating provisions in the \u201cnotes on accounts\u201d \nto the balance sheet on (a) opening balance in the floating provisions account, (b) the quantum \nof floating provisions made in the accounting year, (c) purpose and amount of draw down made during the accounting year, and (d) closing balance in the floating provisions account. \n5.7 Additional Provisions  at higher than prescribed rates  \n5.7.1 For NPAs : \nThe regulatory norms for provisioning represent the minimum requirement. A  bank may \nvoluntarily make specific provisions for advances at rates which are  higher than the rates \nprescribed under existing regulations, to provide for estimated actual loss in collectible amount, provided such higher rates are approved by the Board of Directors and consistently adopted \nfrom year to year. Such additional provisions are not to be considered as floating provisions. \nThe additional provisions for NPAs, like the minimum regulatory provision on NPAs, may be \nnetted off from gross NPAs to arrive at the net NPAs  \n5.7.2 For standard assets: \nThe provisioning rates prescribed in this Master Circular are the regulatory minimum and banks \nare encouraged to make provisions at higher rates in respect of advances to stressed sectors \nof the economy. In this regard, it is advised as under: \n(i) Banks shall put in place a Board\u2013 approved policy for making provisions for standard \nassets at rates higher than the regulatory minimum, based on evaluation of risk and stress in various sectors. \n(ii) The policy shall require a review, at least on a quarterly basis, of the performance of various sectors of the economy to which the bank has an exposure to evaluate the present and emerging risks and stress therein. The review may include quantitative \nand qualitative aspects like debt-equity ratio, interest coverage ratio, profit margins, \nratings upgrade to downgrade ratio, sectoral non -performing assets/stressed assets, \nindustry performance and outlook, legal/ regulatory issues faced by the sector, etc. \nThe reviews may also include sector specific parameters.  \n5.8 Provisions on Leased Assets  \n \n5.8.1 Substandard assets  \n(i) 15 percent of the sum of the net investment in the lease and the unrealised portion \nof finance income net of finance charge component. The terms \u2018net investment in the \nlease\u2019, \u2018finance income\u2019 and \u2018finance charge\u2019 are as defined in \u2018AS 19 Leases\u2019 .   33 (ii) Unsecured (as defined in Paragraph 5.4 above)  lease exposures,, which are \nidentified as \u2018substandard\u2019 would attract additional provision of 10 per cent, i.e., a total \nof 25 per cent. \n5.8.2 Doubtful assets  \n100 percent of the extent to which the finance is not secured by the realisable value of the leased asset, should be provided for. Realisable value is to be estimated on a realistic basis. \nIn addition to the above provision, provision at the following rates should be made on the sum \nof the net investment in the lease and the unrealised portion of fi nance income net of finance \ncharge component of the secured portion, depending upon the period for which asset has been \ndoubtful:  \nPeriod for which the advance has  \nremained in \u2018doubtful\u2019 category  Provision ing  \nrequirement (%)  \nUp to one year  25 \nOne to thre e years  40 \nMore than three years  100 \n \n5.8.3 Loss assets  \nThe entire asset should be written off,  if for any reason, an asset is allowed to remain in books, \n100 percent of the sum of the net investment in the lease and the unrealised portion of finance \nincome net of finance charge component should be provided for. \n5.9 Guidelines for Provisions under Special Circumstances  \n \n5.9.1 Advances against deposits/specific instruments  \nAdvances against term deposits, NSCs eligible for surrender, IVPs, KVPs, gold ornam ents, \ngovernment & other securities and life insurance policies would attract provisioning \nrequirements as applicable to their asset classification status. \n5.9.2 Treatment of interest suspense account  \nAmounts held in Interest Suspense Account should not be reckoned as part of provisions. \nAmounts lying in the Interest Suspense Account should be deducted from the relative \nadvances and thereafter, provisioning as per the norms, should be made on the balances after such deduction.  \n5.9.3 Advances covered by ECG C guarantee \nIn the case of advances classified as doubtful and guaranteed by ECGC, provision should be made only for the balance in excess of the amount guaranteed by the Corporation. Further, \nwhile arriving at the provision required to be made for doubtful assets, realisable value of the   34 securities should first be deducted from the outstanding balance in respect of the amount \nguaranteed by the Corporation and then provision made as illustrated hereunder: \nExample  \nOutstanding Balance  Rs.4 lakhs  \nECGC Cover  50 percent  \nPeriod for which the advance has \nremained doubtful  More than 2 years remained \ndoubtful (say as on March 31, 2014)  \nValue of security held  Rs.1.50 lakhs  \n \nProvision required to be made  \nOutstanding balance  Rs.4.00 lakhs  \nLess: Value of security he ld Rs.1.50 lakhs  \nUnrealised balance  Rs.2.50 lakhs  \nLess: ECGC Cover  \n(50% of unrealisable balance)  Rs.1.25 lakhs  \nNet unsecured balance  Rs.1.25 lakhs  \nProvision for unsecured portion of \nadvance Rs.1.25 lakhs (@ 100 percent of \nunsecured portion)  \nProvision for secured portion of advance \n(as on March 31, 2012)  Rs.0.60 lakhs (@ 40 per cent of the \nsecured portion)  \nTotal provision to be made  Rs.1.85 lakhs (as on March 31, 2014)  \n \n5.9.4 Advance covered by guarantees of Credit Guarantee Fund Trust f or Micro a nd Small \nEnterprises (CGTMSE) or Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing \n(CRGFTLIH)  \nIn case the advance covered by CGTMSE or CRGFTLIH guarantee becomes non-\nperforming, no provision need be made towards the guaranteed portion. The amount outsta nding in excess of the guaranteed portion should be provided for as per the extant \nguidelines on provisioning for non- performing assets. An illustrative example is given \nbelow:  \n \n \n \n \n   35 Example : \nOutstanding Balance Rs.10 \nlakhs  Outstanding Balance Rs.10 lakhs  \nCGT MSE/CRGFTLIH Cover  75% of the amount outstanding or 75% of \nthe unsecured amount or Rs.37.50 lakh, \nwhichever is the least  \nPeriod f or which the advance \nhas remained doubtful  More than 2 years remained doubtful (say \nas on March 31, 2014)  \nValue of security held Rs.1.50 \nlakhs  Value of security held Rs.1.50 lakhs  \n \nProvision required to be made  \nBalance outstanding  Rs.10.00 lakh  \nLess: Value of security  Rs.1.50 lakh  \nUnsecured amount  Rs.8.50 lakh  \nLess: CGTMSE/CRGFTLIH cover \n(75%)  Rs.6.38 lakh  \nNet unsecured and uncovered p ortion:  Rs.2.12 lakh  \nProvision for Secured portion @ 40% \nof Rs.1.50 lakh Rs.0.60 lakh  \nProvision for Unsecured & uncovered \nportion @ 100% of Rs.2.12 lakh  Rs.2.12 lakh  \nTotal provision required  Rs.2.72 lakh  \n \n5.9.5 Reserve for Exchange Rate Fluctuations Ac count (RERFA)  \nWhen exchange rate movements of Indian rupee turn adverse, the outstanding amount of \nforeign currency denominated loans (where actual disbursement was made in Indian Rupee) \nwhich becomes overdue, goes up correspondingly, with its attendant i mplications of \nprovisioning requirements. Such assets should not normally be revalued. In case such assets \nneed to be revalued as per requirement of accounting practices or for any other requirement, \nthe following procedure may be adopted: \na. The loss on revaluation of assets has to be booked in the bank's Profit & Loss Account.  \nb. In addition to the provisioning requirement as per Asset Classification, the full amount \nof the Revaluation Gain, if any, on account of foreign exchange fluctuation should be used to m ake provisions against the corresponding assets.\n   36 5.9.6 Provisioning for country risk  \n5.9.6.1 Banks shall make provisions, with effect from the year ending March 31, 2003, \non the net funded country exposures on a graded scale ranging from 0.25 to 100 \npercent according to the risk categories mentioned below. To begin with, banks shall \nmake provisions as per the following schedule:  \nRisk \ncategory  ECGC  \nClassification Provisioning  \nRequirement  \n(per cent)  \nInsignificant  A1 0.25 \nLow A2 0.25 \nModerate  B1 5 \nHigh B2 20 \nVery high  C1 25 \nRestricted  C2 100 \nOff-credit  D 100 \n \n5.9.6.2 Banks are required to make provision for country risk in respect of a country \nwhere its net funded exposure is one per cent or more of its total assets.  \n \n5.9.6.3 The provision for countr y risk shall be in addition to the provisions required to \nbe held according to the asset classification status of the asset. However, in the case \nof \u2018loss assets\u2019 and \u2018doubtful assets\u2019, provision held, including provision held for country \nrisk, may not exc eed 100% of the outstanding.  \n \n5.9.6.4 Banks may not make any provision for \u2018home country\u2019 exposures i.e. exposure \nto India. The exposures of foreign branches of Indian banks to the host country should \nbe included. Foreign banks shall compute the country ex posures of their Indian \nbranches and shall hold appropriate provisions in their Indian books. However, their \nexposures to India will be excluded. \n5.9.6.5 Banks may make a lower level of provisioning (say 25% of the requirement) in \nrespect of short-term exposures (i.e. exposures with contractual maturity of less than \n180 days).   37 5.9.7 Provisioning norms for Liquidity facility provided for Securitisation transactions  \nThe amount of liquidity facility drawn and outstanding for more than 90 days, in respect of \nsecuritisation transactions undertaken in terms of Reserve Bank of India (Securitisation of \nStandard Assets) Directions, 2021 , should be fully provided for. \n5.9.8 Provision ing requirements for derivative exposures  \nCredit exposures computed as per the current marked to market value of the contract, arising \non account of the interest rate & foreign exchange derivative transactions, credit default swaps \nand gold, shall also attract provisioning requirement as applicable to the loan assets in the \n'standard' category, of the concerned counterparties. All conditions applicable for treatment of \nthe provisions for standard assets would also apply to the aforesaid provisions for deri vative \nand gold exposures.  \n5.9.9 Provisioning for housing loans at teaser rates  \nIt has been observed that some banks are following the practice of sanctioning housing loans at teaser rates i.e. at comparatively lower rates of interest in the first few years, after which \nrates are reset at higher rates. This practice raises concern as some borrowers may find it \ndifficult to service the loans once the normal interest rate, which is higher than the rate \napplicable in the initial years, becomes effective. It has been also observed that many banks \nat the time of initial loan appraisal, do not take into account the repaying capacity of the \nborrower at normal lending rates. Therefore, the standard asset provisioning on the \noutstanding amount of such loans has been  increased from 0.40 per cent to 2.00 per cent in \nview of the higher risk associated with them. The provisioning on these assets would revert to \n0.40 per cent after 1 year from the date on which the rates are reset at higher rates if the \naccounts remain \u2018s tandard\u2019. \n5.9.10 Provisioning requirement in terms of Guidelines on Enhancing Credit Supply for Large \nBorrowers through Market Mechanism  \nIn respect of specified borrowers, as per the provisions of the Guidelines on Enhancing Credit \nSupply for Large Borrowers through Market Mechanism dated August 25, 2016, banks shall make additional provisions of 3 percentage points over and above the applicable provision on \nthe incremental exposure of the banking system in excess of Normally Permitted Lending Limit (NPLL) as defined in the said guidelines.  This higher provisioning requirement shall be \ndistributed in proportion to each bank\u2019s funded exposure to the specified borrower. \n5.10 Provisioning Coverage Ratio  \n5.10.1 Provisioning Coverage Ratio (PCR) is essentially the ratio of provisioning to gross non-\nperforming assets and indicates the extent of funds a bank has kept aside to cover loan \nlosses.    38 5.10.2 From a macro-prudential perspective, banks should build up provisioning and capital \nbuffers in good times i.e. when the profits are good, which can be used for absorbing losses \nin a downturn. This will enhance the soundness of individual banks, as also the stability of \nthe financial sector. It was, therefore, decided that banks should augment their provisioning \ncushions consisting of specific provisions against NPAs as well as floating provisions, and \nensure that their total provisioning coverage ratio, including floating provisions, is not less \nthan 70 per cent. Accordingly, banks  were advised to achieve this norm not later than end-\nSeptember 2010. 5.10.3 Majority of the banks had achieved PCR of 70 percent and had represented to RBI \nwhether the prescribed PCR is required to be maintained on an ongoing basis. The matter was examined and,  the banks were advised that: \n(i) the PCR of 70 percent may be with reference to the gross NPA position in banks as \non September 30, 2010;  \n(ii) the surplus of the provision under PCR vis -a-vis as required as per prudential norms \nshould be segregated into an account styled as \u201ccountercyclical provi sioning \nbuffer\u201d, computation of which may be undertaken as per the format given in Annex \n- 3; and \n(iii) this buffer will be allowed to be used by banks for making specific provisions for \nNPAs during periods of system wide downturn, with the prior approval of RBI . \n5.10.4 The PCR of the bank should be disclosed in the Notes to Accounts to the Balance Sheet.\n6. Writing off of NPAs  \n6.1 General  \n6.1.1 In terms of Section 43(D) of the Income Tax Act 1961, income by way of \ninterest in relation to such categories of bad and doubtful  debts as may be \nprescribed having regard to the guidelines issued by the RBI in relation to such \ndebts, shall be chargeable to tax in the previous year in which it is credited to the \nbank\u2019s profit and loss account or received, whichever is earlier. \n6.1.2 This s tipulation is not applicable to provisioning required to be made as \nindicated above. In other words, amounts set aside for making provision for NPAs as \nabove are not eligible for tax deductions. \n6.1.3 Therefore, the banks should either make full provision as per  the guidelines \nor write -off such advances and claim such tax benefits as are applicable, by evolving \nappropriate methodology in consultation with their auditors/tax consultants. \nRecoveries made in such accounts should be offered for tax  purposes as per the \nrules.    39 6.2 Write- off at Head Office Level  \n \n6.2.1 Banks may write-off advances at Head Office level, even though the relative \nadvances are still outstanding in the branch books. However, it is necessary that \nprovision is made as per the classification accorded to the respective accounts. In other words, if an advance is a loss asset, 100 percent provision will have to be made \ntherefor. \n \n6.2.2 Banks are custodians of public deposits and are therefore expected to make \nall efforts to protect the value of their  assets. Banks are required to extinguish all \navailable means of recovery before writing off any account fully or partly. It is \nobserved that some banks are resorting to technical write off of accounts, which \nreduces incentives to recover. Banks resorting to partial and technical write-offs \nshould not show the remaining part of the loan as standard asset. With a view to bring \nin more transparency, henceforth banks should disclose full details of write offs, \nincluding separate details about technical write offs, in their annual financial \nstatements as per the format prescribed in the Annex -4 to this Master Circular.  \n7. NPA Management \u2013 Requirement of Effective Mechanism and Granular Data \n7.1 Asset quality of banks is one of the most important indicators of their financial \nhealth. Banks should, therefore put in place a robust MIS mechanism for early detection \nof signs of distress at individual account level as well as at segment level (asset class, \nindustry, geographic, size, etc.) . Such early warning signals should be used for putting \nin place an effective preventive asset quality management framework, including a \ntransparent restructuring mechanism for viable accounts under distress within the \nprevailing regulatory framework, for preserving the economic value of  those entities in \nall segments. \n7.2 The banks' IT and MIS system should be robust and able to generate reliable \nand quality information with regard to their asset quality for effective decision making. \nThere should be no inconsistencies between information furnished under regulatory / \nstatutory reporting and the banks' own MIS reporting. Banks should also have system \ngenerated segment wise information on non-performing assets and restructured assets \nwhich may include data on the opening balances, additions, reductions (upgradatio ns, \nactual recoveries, write- offs etc.), closing balances, provisions held, technical write- offs, \netc. \n \n   40 PART B 1 - Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets  \n8. Early identification and reporting of stress  \n8.1 Lenders3 shall recognise incipient stress in loan accounts, immediately \non default4, by classifying such assets as special mention accounts (SMA) as per \nthe following categories:  \nSMA Sub -categories  Basis for classification \u2013 Principal or \ninterest payment or any other amount \nwholly or partly overdue between  \nSMA -0 1-30 days  \nSMA -1 31-60 days  \nSMA -2 61-90 days  \n \n8.2 In the case of revolving credit facilities like cash credit, the SMA sub-\ncategories will be as follows: \nSMA Sub -categories  Basis for classification \u2013 \nOutstanding balance remains \ncontinuously in excess of the \nsanctioned limit or drawing power, \nwhichever is lower, for a period of:  \nSMA -1 31-60 days  \nSMA -2 61-90 days  \n \n8.3 As provided in terms of the circular5 DBS.OSMOS.No.147 03/33. \n01.001/2013 -14 dated May 22, 2014  and subsequent amendments thereto, lenders \nshall report credit information, including classification of an account as SMA to \nCentral Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC), on all borrowers having \n                                                      \n3 For the purpose of instructions in part B -1 and B -2 of this Master Circular, \u2018lenders\u2019 shall mean:  \na. Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks);  \nb. All India Term Financial Institutions (NABARD, NHB, EXIM Bank, and SIDBI);  \nc. Small Finance Banks; and,  \nd. Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC -ND-SI) \nand Deposit taking Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC -D). \n4 \u2018Default\u2019 means non-payment of debt ( as defined under the IBC) when whole or any part or instalment of \nthe debt has become due and payable and is not paid by the debtor or the corporate debtor, as the case \nmay be.  \nFor revolving facilities like cash credit, default would also mean, without prejudice to the above, the outstanding \nbalance remaining continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit or drawing power, whichever is lower, for more \nthan 30 days.  \n5 In parts B1 and B 2 of this Master Circular, wherever a reference is made to the circulars addressed to banks, other lenders \nindicated at paragraph 3 should refer to corresponding circulars applicable to them, if any.    41 aggregate exposure6 of \u20b95 crore  and above with them. The CRILC -Main Report shall \nbe submitted on a monthly basis. In addition, the lenders shall submit a weekly report \nof instances of default by all borrowers (with aggregate exposure of \u20b95 crore  and \nabove) by close of busines s on every Friday, or the preceding working day if Friday \nhappens to be a holiday. \n9. Implementation of Resolution Plan \n \n9.1 All lenders must put in place Board-approved policies for resolution of \nstressed assets, including the timelines for resolution. Since default with any lender \nis a lagging indicator of financial stress faced by the borrower, it is expected that the \nlenders initiate the process of implementing a resolution plan (RP) even before a \ndefault. In any case, once a borrower is reported to be in default by any of the \nlenders , lenders shall undertake a prima facie review of the borrower account within \nthirty days from such default (\u201c Review Period\u201d). During this Review Period of thirty \ndays, lenders may decide on the resolution strategy, including the nature of the RP, \nthe approach for implementation of the RP, etc. The lenders may also choose to \ninitiate legal proceedings for insolvency or recovery.  \n \n9.2 In cases where RP is to be implemented, all lenders shall enter into an \ninter-creditor agreement (ICA), during the above-said Review Period, to provide for \nground rules for finalisation and implementation of the RP in respect of borrowers \nwith credit facilities from more than one lender.7 The ICA shall provide that any \ndecision agreed by lenders representing 75 per cent by value of total outstanding \ncredit facilities (fund based as well non-fund based) and 60 per cent of lenders by \nnumber shall be binding upon all the lenders. Additionally, the ICA may, inter alia, \nprovide for rights and duties of majority lenders, duties and protection of rights of \ndissenting lenders, treatment of lenders with priority in cash flows/differential \nsecurity interest, etc. In particular, the RPs shall provide for payment not less than \nthe liquidation value8 due to the dissenting lenders. \n \n                                                      \n6 Aggregate exposure under the guidelines would include all fund based and non-fund based exposure, including investment \nexposure with the lenders.  \n7 In cases where asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) have exposure to the borrower concerned, they shall also sign \nthe ICA and adhere to all its provisions.  \n8 Liquidation value would mean the estimated realisable value of the assets of the relevant borrower, if such borrower were \nto be liquidated as on the date of commencement of the Review Period.    42 9.3 In respect of accounts with aggregate exposure above a threshold with the lenders, as \nindicated below, on or after the \u2018reference date\u2019, RP shall be implemented within 180 days from \nthe end of Review Period. The Review Period shall commence not l ater than: \na. The reference date, if in default as on the reference date; or  \nb. The date of first default after the reference date.  \n9.4 The reference dates for the above purpose shall be as under: \nAggregate exposure of the borrower \nto lenders mentioned at 3(a), 3(b)  and \n3(c) Reference date  \n\u20b920 billion and above  Date of these Directions  \n\u20b915 billion and above, but less than \u20b920 \nbillion  January 1, 2020  \nLess than \u20b915 billion  To be announced in due course  \n \n9.5 The RP may involve any action / plan / reorganization including, but not limited to, \nregularisation of the account by payment of all over dues by the borrower entity, sale of the \nexposures to other entities / investors, change in ownership and restructuring9. The RP shall be \nclearly documented by the lenders concerned (even if there is no cha nge in any terms and \nconditions).  \n10. Implementation Conditions for RP  \n \n10.1 RPs involving restructuring / change in ownership in respect of accounts where the \naggregate exposure of lenders is \u20b91 00 crore and above, shall require independent credit \nevaluation (ICE) of the residual debt10 by credit rating agencies (CRAs) specifically authorised by \nthe Reserve Bank for this purpose. While accounts with aggregate exposur e of \u20b95 billion and \nabove shall require two such ICEs, others shall require one ICE. Only such RPs which receive a \ncredit opinion of RP411 or better for the residual debt from one or two CRAs, as the case may be, \nshall be considered for implementation. Further, ICEs shall be subject to the following: \na) The CRAs shall be directly engaged by the lenders and the payment of fee for such \nassignments shall be made by the lenders.  \n                                                      \n9 Restructuring is an act in which a lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, gra nts \nconcessions to the borrower. Restructuring would normally involve modification of terms of the advances / securities, which \nwould generally include, among others, alteration of payment period / payable amount / the amount of instalments / rate of \ninterest; roll over  of credit facilities; sanction of additional credit facility/ release of additional funds for an account in default \nto aid curing of default / enhancement of existing credit limits; compromise settlements where time for payment of settlement  \namount exceeds three months.  \n10 The residual debt of the borrower entity, in this context, means the aggregate debt (fund based as well as non-fund based) \nenvisaged to be held by all the lenders as per the proposed RP.  \n11 Annex \u2013 5 provides list of RP symbols that can be provided by CRAs as ICE and their meanings.    43 b) If lenders obtain ICE from more than the required number of CRAs, all such ICE opinions  \nshall be RP4 or better for the RP to be considered for implementation. \n10.2 A RP in respect of borrowers to whom the lenders continue to have credit exposure, shall be \ndeemed to be \u2018implemented\u2019 only if the following conditions are met: \na) A RP which does not involve restructuring/change in ownership shall be deemed to be \nimplemented only if the borrower is not in default with any of the lenders as on 180th day \nfrom the end of the Review Period. Any subsequent default after the 180 day period shall \nbe treated as a fresh default, triggering a fresh review.  \nb) A RP which involves restructuring/change in ownership shall be deemed to be \nimplemented only if all of the following conditions are met: \ni. all related documentation, including execution of necessary agreements between \nlenders and borrower / creation of security charge / perfection of securities, are \ncompleted by the lenders concerned in consonance with the RP being \nimplemented; \nii. the new capital structure and/or changes in the terms of conditions of the existing \nloans get duly reflected in the books of all the lenders and the borrower; and, \niii. borrower is not in default with any of the lenders.  \n10.3 A RP which involves lenders exiting the exposure by assigning the exposures to third \nparty or a RP involving recovery action shall be deemed to be implemented only if the exposure \nto the borrower is fully extinguished.  \n11. Delayed Implementation of Resolution Plan  \n \n11.1 Where a viable RP in respect of a borrower is not implemented within the timelines \ngiven below, all lenders shall make additional provisions as under: \nTimeline for implementation \nof viable RP  Additional provisions to be made as a % of \ntotal outstanding (funded+non-funded) , if RP \nnot implemented within the timeline \n180 days from the end of Review \nPeriod  20% \n365 days from the \ncommencement of Review \nPeriod  15% (i.e. total additional provisioning of 35%)  \n \n   44 11.2 The additional provisions shall be made over and above the higher of the following, \nsubject to the total provisions held being capped at 100% of total outstanding: \na) The prov isions already held; or,  \nb) The provisions required to be made as per the asset classification status of the borrower \naccount.  \n11.3 The additional provisions shall be made by all the lenders with exposure to such \nborrower. \n11.4 The additional provisions shall also be r equired to be made in cases where the lenders \nhave initiated recovery proceedings, unless the recovery proceedings are fully completed. \n11.5 The above additional provisions may be reversed as under:  \na) Where the RP involves only payment of overdues by the borrower  \u2013 the additional \nprovisions may be reversed only if the borrower is not in default for a period of 6 months \nfrom the date of clearing of the overdues with all the lenders;  \nb) Where RP involves restructuring/change in ownership outside IBC \u2013  the additional \nprovisions may be reversed upon implementation of the RP; \nc) Where resolution is pursued under IBC \u2013  half of the additional provisions made may be \nreversed on filing of insolvency application and the remaining additional provisions may \nbe reversed upon admission of the borrower into the insolvency resolution process under \nIBC; or, \nd) Where assignment of debt/recovery proceedings are initiated \u2013  the additional provisions \nmay be reversed upon completion of the assignment of debt/recovery.  \n12. Prudential Norms  \nThe prudential norms applicable to any restructuring/change in ownership, whether under the \nIBC framework or outside the IBC, are contained in Part B212 of this Master Circular . \n13. Supervisory Review  \nAny action by lenders with an intent to conceal the actual status of ac counts or evergreen the \nstressed accounts, will be subjected to stringent supervisory / enforcement actions as deemed \nappropriate by the Reserve Bank, including, but not limited to, higher provisioning on such \naccounts and monetary penalties13. \n                                                      \n12 During the period when the RP is being finalised and implemented, the usual asset classification norms would continue \nto apply subject to additional provisioning requirements of this circular. The process of re-classification of an asset should \nnot stop merely because RP is under consideration.  \n13 This may be in  addition to direction to bank/s to file insolvency application under the IBC.    45 14. Disclosures  \nLenders shall make appropriate disclosures in their financial statements, under \u2018Notes on \nAccounts\u2019, relating to RPs implemented. \n15.

Definition of Rest ructuring  \n16.1 Restructuring is an act in which a lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the \nborrower's financial difficulty, grants concessions to the borrower. Restructuring may involve \nmodification of terms of the advances / securities, which would generally include, among others, \nalteration of payment period / payable amount / the amount of instalments / rate of interest; roll \nover of credit facilities; sanction of additional credit facility/ release of additional funds for an \naccount in default to aid curing of default / enhancement of existing credit limits; compromise \nsettlements where time for payment of settlement amount exceeds three months. \n \n16.2 For this purpose, the board-approved policies of lenders on resolution of stressed \nassets, required to be in place in terms of these guidelines , shall also have detailed policies on \nvarious signs of financial difficulty, providing quantitative as well as qualitative parameters, for \ndetermining financial difficulty as expected from a prudent bank. In order to enable lenders to \nframe respective policies for determination of financial difficultly, a non-exhaustive indicative list \nof signs of financial difficulty are provided as under14: \na) A default, as per the definition provided in the framework, shall be treated as an indicator \nfor financial difficulty, irrespective of reasons for the default.  \nb) A borrower not in default, but it is probable that the borrower will default on any of its \nexposures in the foreseeable future without the concession, for instance, when there has \nbeen a pattern of delinquency in payments on its exposures. \nc) A borrower\u2019s outstanding securities have been delisted, are in the process of being \ndelisted, or are under threat of being delisted from an exchange due to noncompliance \nwith the listing requirements or for financial reasons. \nd) On the basis of actual performance, estimates and projections that encompass the \nborrower\u2019s current level of operations, the borrower\u2019s cash flows are assessed to be \ninsufficient to service all of its loans or debt securities (both interest and principal) in \naccordance with the contractual terms of the existing agreement for the foreseeable future. \ne) A borrower\u2019s credit facilities are in non-performing status or would be categorised as \nnonperforming without the concess ions. \n                                                      \n14 Based on the Basel Committee Guidelines on \u201cPrudential treatment of problem assets \u2013 definitions of non- performing \nexposures and forbearance\u201d.    47 f) A borrower\u2019s existing exposures are categorised as exposures that have already \nevidenced difficulty in the borrower\u2019s ability to repay in accordance with the bank\u2019s internal \ncredit rating system.  \ng) The above list provides examples of possible indicator s of financial difficulty, but is not \nintended to constitute an exhaustive enumeration of financial difficulty indicators with \nrespect to restructuring. Lenders shall need to complement the above with key financial \nratios and operational parameters which m ay include quantitative and qualitative aspects. \nIn particular, financial difficulty can be identified even in the absence of arrears on an \nexposure. The robustness of the board approved policy and the outcomes would be \nexamined as part of the supervisory oversight of the Reserve Bank. \n17. Prudential  Norms15 \n \n17.1 Asset Classification  \nIn case of restructuring, the accounts classified as 'standard' shall be immediately downgraded \nas non-performing assets (NPAs), i.e., \u2018sub- standard\u2019 to begin with. The NPAs, upon \nrestructuring, would continue to have the same asset classification as prior to restructuring. In \nboth cases, the asset classification shall continue to be governed by the ageing criteria as laid out \nin Part A of this Master Circular . \n17.2 Conditions for Upgrade \n17.2.1 For MSME accounts where aggregate exposure of the lenders is less than \u20b9 25 \ncrores:  \nAn account may be considered for upgradation to \u2018standard\u2019 only if it demonstrates satisfactory \nperformance during the specified period. \u2018Specified Period\u2019 means a period of one year from the \ncommencement of the firs t payment of interest or principal, whichever is later, on the credit facility \nwith longest period of moratorium under the terms of restructuring package. \u2018Satisfactory \nPerformance\u2019 means no payment (interest and/or principal) shall remain overdue for a period of \nmore than 30 days. In case of cash credit / overdraft account, satisfactory performance means \nthat the outstanding in the account shall not be more than the sanctioned limit or drawing power, \nwhichever is lower, for a period of more than 30 days.  \n \n17.2.2 For all other accounts not included in sub-p aragraph 17.2.1 \n17.2.2.1 Standard accounts classified as NPA and NPA accounts retained in the same \ncategory on restructuring by the lenders may be upgraded only when all the outstanding loan \n                                                      \n15 Applicable to all resolution plans, including those undertaken under IBC.    48 / facilities in the account demonstrate \u2018satisfactory performance\u201916 during the period from the \ndate of implementation of RP up to the date by which at least 10 per cent of the sum of \noutstanding principal debt17 as per the RP and interest capitalisation sanctioned as part of the \nrestructuring, if any, is repaid ( \u2018monitoring period\u2019).  \nProvided that the account cannot be upgraded before one year from the commencement of the \nfirst payment of interest or principal (whichever is later) on the credit facility with longest period \nof moratorium under the terms of RP. \n17.2.2.2 Additionally, for accounts where the aggregate exposure of lenders is \u20b9100 crores  and \nabove at the time of implementation of RP, to qualify for an upgrade, in addition to \ndemonstration of satisfactory performance, the credit facilities of the borrower shall also be \nrated as investment grade18 (BBB- or better), at the time of upgrade, by CRAs accredited by \nthe Reserve Bank for the purpose of bank loan ratings. While accounts with aggregate \nexposure of \u20b9500 crores  and above shall require two ratings, those below \u20b95 00 crores shall \nrequire one rating. If the ratings are obtained from more than the required number of CRAs, all \nsuch ratings shall be investment grade for the account to qualify for an upgrade. \n17.2.2.3 If the borrower fails to demonstrate satisfactory performance during the monitoring \nperiod, asset classification upgrade shall be subject to implementation of a fresh restructuring/ \nchange in ownership under Part s B-1 and B -2 of this Master Circular  or under IBC. Lenders \nshall make an additional provision of 15% for such accounts at the end of the Review Period. \nThis additional provision, along with other additional provisions, may be reversed as per the \nnorms laid down at Paragraph 11.5.  \n17.2.2.4 Provisions held on restructured assets may be reversed when the accounts are \nupgraded to standard category. \n17.2.2.5 Any default by the borrower in any of the credit facilities with any of the lenders \n(including any lender where the borrower is not in \u201cspecified period\u201d ) subsequent to upgrade \nin asset classification as above but before the end of the specified period, will require a fresh \nRP to be implemented within the above timelines as any default would entail. However, lenders \nshall make an additional provision of 15% for such accounts at the end of the Review Period. \n                                                      \n16 Satisfactory performance means that the borrower entity is not in default at any point of time during the period concerned.  \n17 Outstanding principal debt shall include all credit facilities, including debt/debt like instruments (viz., non-convertible \ndebentures, optionally convertible debentures, optionally convertible preference shares, non-convertible preference shares \netc.) that exist post implementation of the RP. Only equity and instruments compulsorily conv ertible into equity (without any \nembedded optionality) shall be exempt from determining outstanding principal debt.  \n18 These ratings shall be the normal ratings provided by the CRAs and not ICEs referred to in paragraph 10.1 of this \nMaster Circular.    49 This additional provision, along with other additional provisions, may be reversed as per the \nnorms laid down at Paragraph 11.5 of this Master C ircular.  \n\u201cSpecified period\u201d means the period from the date of implementation of RP19 up to the date by \nwhich at least 20 per cent of the sum of outstanding principal debt as per the RP and interest \ncapitalisation sanctioned as part of the restructuring, if any, is repaid.  \n18. Provisioning  Norms20 \n18.1 Accounts restructured under the revised framework shall attract provisioning as per the \nasset classificati on category as laid out in part A of this Master Circular . \n \n18.2 In respect of accounts of debtors where a final RP, as approved by the Committee of \nCreditors, has been submitted by the Resolution Professional for approval of the Adjudicating \nAuthority (in term s of section 30(6) of the IBC), lenders may keep the provisions held as on the \ndate of such submission of RP frozen for a period of six months from the date of submission of \nthe plan or up to 90 days from the date of approval of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating \nAuthority in terms of section 31 (1) of the IBC, whichever is earlier.  \n \n18.3 The above facility of freezing the quantum of the provision shall be available only in \ncases where the provisioning held by the lenders as on the date of submission of the plan for \napproval of the Adjudicating Authority is more than the expected provisioning required to be held \nin the normal course upon implementation of the approved resolution plan, taking into account \nthe contours of the resolution plan approved by Committee of Creditors/ Adjudicating Authority, \nas the case may be, and extant prudential norms. However, lenders shall not reverse the excess \nprovisions held as on the date of submission of the resolution plan for approval of the Adjudicating \nAuthority at this stage. In cases where the provisioning held is lower than the expected required \nprovisioning, lenders shall make additional provisioning to the extent of the shortfall. Subsequent \nto the lapse of above mentioned period, provisioning shall be as per the nor ms laid out in Part A \nof this Master Circular . The facility of freezing of provisions shall also lapse immediately if the \nAdjudicating Authority rejects the resolution plan thus submitted. Asset classification in respect of \nsuch borrower shall continue be governed by the extant asset classification norms. \n \n                                                      \n19 For accounts restructured under IBC, the specified period shall be deemed to commence from the date of \nimplementation of the resolution plan as approved by the Adjudicating Authority  \n20 Additional provisions for delayed implementation of RP within timelines shal l be as per paragraphs 11.1 \u2013  11.4 of this \nMaster Circular    50 18.4 MSME accounts restructured under the circulars DBR.No.BP.BC.18/21.04.048/2018-\n19 dated January 1, 2019  and DOR.No.BP.BC.34/21.04.048/2019-20 dated February 11, 2020  \nshall attract the provisioning requirements prescribed therein. \n19. Additional Finance  \n19.1 Any additional finance approved under the RP (including any resolution plan approved \nby the Adjudicating Authority under IBC) may be treated as 'standard asset' during the monitoring \nperiod under the approved RP, provided the account demonstrates satisfactory performance (as \ndefined at footnote 16) during the monitoring period. If the restructured asset fails to perform \nsatisfactorily during the monitoring period or does not qualify for upgradation at the end of the \nmonitoring period, the additional finance shall be placed in the same asset classification category \nas the restructured debt.  \n19.2 Similarly, any interim finance [as defined in section 5 (15) of the IBC] extended by the \nlenders to debtors undergoing insolvency proceedings under IBC may be treated as \u2018standard \nasset\u2019 during the insolvency resolution process period as defined in the IBC. During this period, \nasset classification and provisioning for the interim finance shall be governed by the norms laid \ndown in Part A of this Master Circular . Subsequently, upon approval of the resolution plan by  the \nAdjudicating Authority, treatment of such interim finance shall be as per the norms applicable to \nadditional finance, as per Paragraph 19.1 above. \n20. Income recognition norms  \n20.1 Interest income in respect of restructured accounts classified as 'standard as sets' may \nbe recognized on accrual basis and that in respect of the restructured accounts classified as 'non -\nperforming assets' shall be recognised on cash basis.  \n20.2 In the case of additional finance in accounts where the pre-restructuring facilities were \nclassified as NPA, the interest income shall be recognised only on cash basis except when the \nrestructuring is accompanied by a change in ownership.  \n21. Conversion of Principal into Debt / Equity and Unpaid Interest into 'Funded \nInterest Term Loan' (FITL), Debt o r Equity Instruments  \n21.1 An act of restructuring might create new securities issued by the borrower which would \nbe held by the lenders in lieu of a portion of the pre-restructured exposure. The FITL / debt / equity \ninstruments created by conversion of principal / unpaid interest, as the case may be, shall be \nplaced in the same asset classification category in which the restructured advance has been \nclassified.  \n21.2 The provisioning applicable to such instruments shall be the higher of:  \na) The provisioning applicable to the asset classification category in which such \ninstruments are held; or    51 b) The provisioning applicable based on the fair valuation of such instruments as \nprovided in the following paragraphs.  \n21.3 Debt/quasi -debt/equity instruments21 acquired by the lenders as part of a RP shall be \nvalued as under: \na) Debentures/bonds shall be valued as per the instructions compiled at Paragraph 3.7.1 \nof the Master Circular - Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation \nof Investment Portfolio by Banks dated July 1, 2015  (as amended from time to time).  \nb) Conversion of debt into Zero Coupon Bonds (ZCBs)/low coupon bonds (LCBs) as part \nof RP shall be subject to the conditions compiled at Paragraph 5.4 of the Master \nCircular - Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment \nPortfolio by Banks dated July 1, 2015  (as amended from time to time). Such \nZCBs/LCBs shall be valued as per the instructions contained at Paragraph 3.7.3 of \nthe above said Master Circular, subject to the following:  \ni. Where the borrower fails to build up the sinking fund as required under the \nabove said Master Cir cular, ZCBs/LCBs of such borrower shall be collectively \nvalued at Re.1 \nii. Instruments without a pre-specified terminal value would be collectively valued \nat Re.1. \nc) Equity instruments, where classified as standard, shall be valued at market value, if \nquoted, or  else, should be valued at the lowest value arrived using the following \nvaluation methodologies: \ni. Book value (without considering 'revaluation reserves', if any) which is to be \nascertained from the company's latest audited balance sheet. The date as on \nwhich the latest balance sheet is drawn up should not precede the date of \nvaluation by more than 18 months. In case the latest audited balance sheet is \nnot available the shares are to be collectively valued at Re.1 per company.  \nii. Discounted cash flow method wher e the discount factor is the actual interest \nrate charged to the borrower on the residual debt post restructuring plus a risk \npremium to be determined as per the board approved policy considering the \nfactors affecting the value of the equity. The risk prem ium will be subject to a \n                                                      \n21 These instruments shall be subject to all the instructions contained in Master Circular - Prudential Norms for Classification, \nValuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated July 1, 2015  (as amended from time to time) to the extent \nthey are not inconsistent with the instructions contained in this circular.    52 floor of 3 per cent and the overall discount factor will be subject to a floor of 14 \nper cent. Further, cash flows (cash flow available from the current as well as \nimmediately prospective (not more than six months) level of operati ons) \noccurring within 85 per cent of the useful economic life of the project only shall \nbe reckoned. \nd) Equity instruments, where classified as NPA shall be valued at market value, if \nquoted, or else, shall be collectively valued at Re.1. \ne) Preference Shares shall be valued on discounted cash flow (DCF) basis as per the \ninstructions compiled at Paragraph 3.7.4 of the Master Circular - Prudential Norms for \nClassification, Valuati on and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated July \n1, 2015  (as amended from time to time), subject to the following modifications:  \ni. The discount rate shall be subject to a floor of weighted average actual interest \nrate charged to the borrower on the residual debt after restructuring plus a \nmark -up of 1.5 percent.  \nii. Where preference dividends/coupons are in arrears, no credit should be taken \nfor accrued dividends/coupons and the value determined as above on DCF \nbasis should be discounted further by at least 15 per cent if arrears are for one \nyear, 25 per cent if arrears are for two years, so on and so forth (i.e., with 10 \npercent increments). \n21.4 The overarching principle should be that valuation of instruments arising out of \nresolution of stressed assets  shall be based on conservative assessment of cash flows and \nappropriate discount rates to reflect the stressed cash flows of the borrowers. Statutory Auditors \nshould also specifically examine as to whether the valuations of such instruments reflect the ri sk \nof loss associated with such instruments.  \n \n21.5 In case lenders have acquired unquoted instruments on conversion of debt as a part \nof a RP, and if the RP is not deemed as implemented, such unquoted instruments shall collectively \nbe valued at Re. 1 at that point, and till the RP is treated as implemented. \n \n21.6 The unrealised income represented by FITL / Debt or equity instrument should have a \ncorresponding credit in an account styled as \"Sundry Liabilities Account (Interest Capitalization)\". \n \n \n   53 21.7 The unrealised income represented by FITL / Debt or equity instrument can only be \nrecognised in the profit and loss account as under: \na) FITL/debt instruments: only on sale or redemption, as the case may be;  \nb) Unquoted equity/ quoted equity (where classified as NPA): only on sale; \nc) Quoted equity (where classified as standard): market value of the equity as on the \ndate of upgradation, not exceeding the amount of unrealised income converted to \nsuch equity. Subsequent changes to value of the equity will be dealt as per the extant \nprudential norms on investment portfolio of banks. \n22. Change in Ownership  \n22.1 In case of change in ownership of the borrowing entities, credit facilities of the \nconcerned borrowing entities may be continued/upgraded as \u2018standard\u2019 after the change in \nownership is implem ented, either under the IBC or under this framework. If the change in \nownership is implemented under this framework, then the classification as \u2018standard\u2019 shall be \nsubject to the following conditions:  \na) Lenders shall conduct necessary due diligence in this r egard and clearly establish \nthat the acquirer is not a person disqualified in terms of Section 29A of the IBC. \nAdditionally, the \u2018new promoter\u2019 should not be a person/entity/subsidiary/associate \netc. (domestic as well as overseas), from the existing promoter/promoter group. \nLenders should clearly establish that the acquirer does not belong to the existing \npromoter group (as defined in Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of \nCapital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018).  \nb) The new promoter s hall have acquired at least 26 per cent of the paid up equity capital \nas well as voting rights of the borrower entity and shall be the single largest \nshareholder of the borrower entity. \nc) The new promoter shall be in \u2018control\u2019 of the borrower entity as per t he definition of \n\u2018control\u2019 in the Companies Act, 2013 / regulations issued by the Securities and \nExchange Board of India/any other applicable regulations / accounting standards as \nthe case may be. \nd) The conditions for implementation of RP as laid out in Part B1 of this Master Circular \nare complied with. \n22.2 Upon change in ownership, all the outstanding loans/credit facilities of the borrowing \nentity need to demonstrate satisfactory performance (as defined at footnote 16 ) during the \nmonitoring period. If the account fails to perform satisfactorily at any point of time during the \nmonitoring period, it shall trigger a fresh Review Period, in terms of Paragraph 9.1 above.    54  \n22.3 The quantum of provisions held (excluding additional provisions) by the bank against \nthe said ac count as on the date of change in ownership of the borrowing entities can be reversed \nonly after the end of monitoring period subject to satisfactory performance during the same. \n23. Principles on classification  of sale and lease back transactions as restructuring  \n23.1 A sale and leaseback transaction of the assets of a borrower or other transactions of \nsimilar nature will be treated as an event of restructuring for the purpose of asset classification \nand provisioning in the books of lenders with regard to the residual debt of the seller as well as \nthe debt of the buyer if all the following conditions are met: \na) The seller of the assets is in financial difficulty;  \nb) Significant portion, i.e. more than 50 per cent, of the revenues of the buyer from the \nspecific asset is dependent upon the cash flows from the seller; and \nc) 25 per cent or more of the loans availed by the buyer for the purchase of the specific asset \nis funded by the lenders who already have a credit exposure to the seller.  \n24. Prudential Norms relating to Refinanci ng of Exposures to Borrowers  \nIf borrowings/export advances (denominated in any currency, wherever permitted) for the purpose \nof repayment/refinancing of loans denominated in same/another currency are obtained: \na) From lenders who are part of Indian banking sy stem (where permitted); or  \nb) with the support (where permitted) from the Indian banking system in the form of \nGuarantees/Standby Letters of Credit/Letters of Comfort, etc., such events shall be treated \nas \u2018restructuring\u2019 if the borrower concerned is under fi nancial difficulty.  \n25. Takeout Finance  \n \nTakeout financing transactions that involve prior commitments shall be governed by the circular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.144/21.04.048-2000 dated February 29, 2000 on \u201cIncome Recognition, Asset \nClassification, Provisioning and other related matters and Capital Adequacy Standards \u2013  Takeout \nFinance\u201d.  \n \n26. Regulatory Exemptions  \n \n26.1 Exemptions from RBI Regulations  \n \n26.1.1 Acquisition of non-SLR securities by way of conversion of debt is exempted from the \nrestrictions and the prudential limit on inv estment in unlisted non-SLR securities prescribed by the \nRBI.   55 26.1.2 Acquisition of shares due to conversion of debt to equity during a restructuring process \nwill be exempted from regulatory ceilings/restrictions on Capital Market Exposures, investment in \nPara -Banking activities and intra-group exposure. However, these will require reporting to RBI \n(reporting to D oS, CO every month along with the regular DSB Return on Asset Quality) and \ndisclosure by banks in the Notes to Accounts in Annual Financial Statements . Nonetheless, banks \nwill have to comply with the provisions of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n \n26.2 Exemptions from Regulations of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)  \n \n26.2.1 SEBI has provided exemptions, under certain conditions, from the requirements of \nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) \n(ICDR) Regulations, 2018 for restructurings carried out as per the regulations issued by the \nReserve Bank. \n26.2.2 With reference to the requirements contained in sub-regulations 158 (6) (a) of ICDR \nRegulations, 2018, the issue price of the equity shall be the lower of (a) or (b) below: \na) The average of the weekly high and low of the volume weighted average price of the \nrelated equity shares quoted on the r ecognised stock exchange during the twenty six \nweeks preceding the \u2018reference date\u2019 or the average of the weekly high and low of the \nvolume weighted average prices of the related equity shares quoted on a recognised \nstock exchange during the two weeks prec eding the \u2018reference date\u2019, whichever is \nlower; and \nb) Book value: Book value per share to be calculated from the latest audited balance \nsheet (without considering 'revaluation reserves', if any) adjusted for cash flows and \nfinancials post the earlier restruc turing, if any. The date as on which the latest balance \nsheet is drawn up should not precede the date of restructuring by more than 18 \nmonths. In case the latest audited balance sheet is not available the shares are to be \ncollectively valued at Re.1 per company. \n26.2.3 In the case of conversion of debt into equity, the \u2018reference date\u2019 shall be the date on \nwhich the bank approves the restructuring scheme. In the case of conversion of convertible \nsecurities into equity, the \u2018reference date\u2019 shall be the date  on which the bank approves the \nconversion of the convertible securities into equities.  \n \n   56 27. Restructuring of frauds/ willful defaulters  \n \nBorrowers who have committed frauds/ malfeasance/ willful  default will remain ineligible for \nrestructuring. However, in cases where the existing promoters are replaced by new promoters22, \nand the borrower company is totally delinked from such erstwhile promoters/management, \nlenders may take a view on restructuring such accounts based on their viability, without prejudice \nto the continuance of criminal action against the erstwhile promoters/management. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n22 New promoters must satisfy the conditi ons specified at paragraph 22.1 (a), (b) and (c) above.    57 PART C \u2013 Miscellaneous  \n28.

In \naddition to these instructions and with a view to ensuring better corporate governance structure in \ncompanies and ensuring accountability of independent/professional directors, promoters , auditors, \netc. henceforth, the followi ng prudential measures will be applicable:  \na) The provisioning in respect of existing loans/exposures of banks to companies having director/s (other than nominee directors of government/financial institutions brought on \nboard at the time of distress), whose name/s appear more than once in the list of wilful \ndefaulters, will be 5% in cases of standard accounts; if such account is classified as NPA, it will attract accelerated provisioning as  under:  \nAsset \nClassification Period as NPA  Current provisioning (%)  Revised accelerated \nprovisioning (%)  \nSub- standard  \n(secured)  Up to 6 months  15 No change  \n6 months to 1 year  15 25 \nSub-standard  \n(unsecured ab-\ninitio)  Up to 6 months  25 (other than \ninfrastructure loans)  25 \n20 (infrastructure loans)  \n6 months to 1 year  25 (other than \ninfrastructure loans)  40 \n20 (infrastructure loans)  \nDoubtful I  2nd year  25 (secured portion)  40 (secured portion)  \n100 (unsecured portion)  100 (unsecured portion)  \nDoubtful II  3rd & 4th year  40 (secured portion)  100 for both secured an d \nunsecured portions  100 (unsecured portion)  \nDoubtful III  5th year onwards  100 100 \n \n \nb) This is a prudential measure since the expected losses on exposures to such borrowers \nare likely to be higher. It is reiterated that no additional facilities should be granted by any bank/FI to the listed wilful defaulters, in terms of Paragraph 2.5 (a) of \nMaster Circular on \nWilful Defaulters dated July 1, 2015 .   58 c) With a view to di scouraging borrowers/defaulters from being unreasonable and non-\ncooperative with lenders in their bonafide resolution/recovery efforts, banks may classify \nsuch borrowers as non-cooperative borrowers23, after giving them due notice if satisfactory \nclarifications are not furnished. Banks will be required to report classification of such borrowers to CRILC. Detailed instructions in this regard have been issued vide \ncircular \nDBR.No.CID.BC.54/20.16.064/2014 -15 dated December 22, 2014  on Non-Cooperative \nBorrowers.  \nd) Further, if any particular entity is reported as non-cooperative, any fresh exposure to such \na borrower will , by implication,  entail greater risk necessitating higher provisioning. \nBanks/FIs will therefore be required to make higher provisioning as applicable to \nsubstandard assets in respect of new loans sanctioned to such borrowers as also new loans sanctioned to any other company that has on its board of directors any of the whole \ntime directors/promoters of a non- cooperative borrowing company or any firm in which \nsuch a non- cooperative borrower is in charge of management of the affairs. However, for \nthe purpose of asset classification and income recognition, the new loans would be treated \nas standard assets. This is a prudential measure since the expected losses on exposures \non exposures to such non-cooperative borrowers are likely to be higher.  \n29. Dissemination of Information  \n29.1 A t present, the list of Suit filed accounts  and non-suit filed accounts of Wilful Defaulters ( \u20b925 \nlakh and above) is submitted by banks to the Credit Information Companies (CICs) of which they \nare member(s), who display the same on their respective websites as and when received. In order \nto make the current system of banks/FIs reporting names of suit filed accounts and non-suit filed \naccounts of Wilful Defaulters and its availability to the banks by CICs as current as possible, banks \nare advised to forward data on wilful defaulters to the CICs at the earliest but not later than a \nmonth from the reporting date and they must use/ furnish the detailed information as per the format prescribed in our Master Circular DBR.No.CID.BC.57/20.16.003/2014-15 dated July 1, \n2015  on \u2018Wilful Defaulters\u2019 , as updated from time to time.  \n29.2 In terms of our Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters mentioned above, in case any falsification \nof accounts on the part of the borrowers is observed by the banks / FIs, and if it is observed that the auditors were negligent or deficient in conducting the audit, banks should lodge a formal \ncomplaint against the auditors of the borrowers with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \n                                                      \n23 A non-cooperative borrower is one who does not engage constructively with his lender by defaulting in timely repayment \nof dues while having ability to pay, thwarting lenders\u2019 efforts for recovery of  their dues by not providing necessary information \nsought, denying access to assets financed / collateral securities, obstructing sale of securities, etc. In effect, a non-\ncooperative borrower is a defaulter who deliberately stone walls legitimate efforts of the lenders to recover their dues.    59 India (ICAI) to enable the ICAI to examine and fix accountability of the auditors. RBI reiterates \nthese instructions for strict compliance. Pending discipl inary action by ICAI, the complaints may \nalso be forwarded to the RBI (Department of Banking Supervision, Central Office) and IBA for \nrecords. IBA would circulate the names of the CA firms against whom many complaints have been \nreceived amongst all banks w ho should consider this aspect before assigning any work to them. \nRBI would also share such information with other financial sector regulators/Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)/Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).  \n29.3 Further, banks may seek explanati on from advocates who wrongly certify as to clear legal \ntitles in respect of assets or valuers who overstate the security value, by negligence or connivance, and if no reply/satisfactory clarification is received from them within one month, they \nmay report their names to IBA. The IBA may circulate the names of such advocates/valuers \namong its members for consideration before availing of their services in future. The IBA would \ncreate a central registry for this purpos e. \n30. Bank Loans for Financing Promoters\u2019 Co ntribution  \n30.1 I n terms of extant instructions on Bank Loans for Financing Promoters Contribution as \nconsolidated in our Master Circular DBOD.No.Dir.BC.16/13.03.00/2014- 15 dated July 1,  2015  on \n\u2018Loans and Advances \u2013  Statutory and Other Restrictions\u2019, the  promoters' contribution towards the \nequity capital of a company should come from their own resources and banks should not normally \ngrant advances to take up shares of other companies.  \n30.2 It has been decided that banks can extend finance to \u2018specialized\u2019  entities established for \nacquisition of troubled companies subject to the general guidelines applicable to advances against \nshares/debentures/bonds as contained in the above -mentioned Master Circular and other \nregulatory and statutory exposure limits. The lenders should, however, assess the risks associated \nwith such financing and ensure that these entities are adequately capitalized, and debt equity ratio \nfor such entity is not more than 3:1.  \n30.3 In this connection, a \u2018specialized\u2019 entity will be a body corporate exclusively set up for the \npurpose of taking over and turning around troubled companies and promoted by individuals or/and \ninstitutional promoters (including Government) having professional expertise in turning around \n\u2018troubled companies\u2019 and eli gible to make investments in the industry/segment to which the target \nasset belonged. \n31. Credit Risk Management  \n31.1 Banks are advised that they should strictly follow the credit risk management \nguidelines contained in our circular DBOD.No.BP.(SC).BC.98/21.04.103/ 99 dated October 7,   60 1999 on \u2018Risk Management Systems in Banks\u2019 and DBOD.No.BP.520/21.04.103/2002-03 dated \nOctober 12, 2002  on \u2018Guidance Notes on Management of Credit Risk an d Market Risk\u2019  \n \n31.2 It is reiterated that lenders should carry out their independent and objective credit \nappraisal in all cases and must not depend on credit appraisal reports prepared by outside \nconsultants, especially the in-house consultants of the borrowi ng entity. \n \n31.3 Banks/lenders should carry out sensitivity tests/scenario analysis, especially for \ninfrastructure projects, which should inter alia include project delays and cost overruns. This will \naid in taking a view on viability of the project at the time of deciding on deferment of \nDCCO/restructuring.  \n \n31.4 Lenders should ascertain the source and quality of equity capital brought in by the \npromoters /shareholders. Multiple leveraging, especially, in infrastructure projects, is a matter of \nconcern as it effecti vely camouflages the financial ratios such as Debt/Equity ratio, leading to \nadverse selection of the borrowers. Therefore, lenders should ensure at the time of credit \nappraisal that debt of the parent company is not infused as equity capital of the subsidi ary/SPV.  \n \n31.5 Ministry of Corporate Affairs had introduced the concept of a Director Identification \nNumber (DIN) with the insertion of Sections 266A to 266G of Companies (Amendment) Act, 2006. \nFurther, in terms of Paragraph 5.4 of our Master Circular on Wilful  Defaulters dated July 1, 2015 , \nin order to ensure that directors are correctly identified and in no case, persons whose names appear to be similar to the names of directors appearing in the list of wilful defaulters, are \nwrongfully denied credit facilities on such grounds, banks/FIs have been advised to include the \nDirector Identification Number (DIN) as one of the fields in the data submitted by them to Reserve \nBank of India/Credit Information Companies. \n \n31.6 It is reiterated that while carrying out the credi t appraisal, banks should verify as to \nwhether the names of any of the directors of the companies appear in the list of defaulters/ wilful \ndefaulters by way of reference to DIN/PAN etc. Further, in case of any doubt arising on account \nof identical names, banks should use independent sources for confirmation of the identity of \ndirectors rather than seeking declaration from the borrowing company.  \n \n31.7 Paragraph 2.7 of the Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters states that, \u201cwith a view to \nmonitoring the end-use of funds, if the lenders desire a specific certification from the borrowers\u2019 \nauditors regarding diversion / siphoning of funds by the borrower, the lender should award a separate mandate to the auditors for the purpose. To facilitate such certification by the auditors   61 the banks and FIs will also need to ensure that appropriate covenants in the loan agreements are \nincorporated to enable award of such a mandate by the lenders to the borrowers / auditors\u201d.  \n \n31.8 In addition to the above, banks are advised that with a view to ensuring proper end-\nuse of funds and preventing diversion/siphoning of funds by the borrowers, lenders could \nconsider engaging their own auditors for such specific certification purpose without relying on \ncertification given by borrower\u2019s auditors. However, this cannot substitute bank\u2019s basic minimum \nown diligence in the matter. \n32. Registration of Transactions with CERSAI  \nIn terms of circular DBOD.Leg.No.BC.86/09.08.011/2010-11 dated April 21, 2011  on \u2018Setting up of \nCentral Electronic Registry under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and \nEnforcement of Security Interest Act 2002\u2019, as amended from time to time, banks are required to \nregister, on an ongoing basis, the transactions relating to securitization and reconstruction of financial assets on the CERSAI portal . Banks also need to file, on an ongoing basis, the following \ntypes of security interest on the CERSAI portal  to secure any loans or advances:  \na) particulars of creation, modification, or satisfaction of security interest in mortgage by \ndeposit of title deeds ; \nb) particulars of creation, modification, or satisfaction of security interest in mortgage other than mortgage by deposit of title deeds; \nc) particulars of creation, modification, or satisfaction of security interest in hypothecation of \nplant and machinery, stocks, debts including book debts or receivables, whether existing or future. \nd) particulars of creation, modification, or satisfaction of sec urity interest in i ntangible assets, \nbeing know how, patent, copyright, trademark, licence, franchise or any other business or commercial right of similar nature. \ne) particulars of creation, modification, or satisfaction of security interest in any \u2018under construction\u2019 residential or commercial or a part thereof by an agreement or instrument \nother than mortgage. \n33. Board Oversight  \n33.1 The Board of Directors of banks should take all necessary steps to arrest the deteriorating \nasset quality in their books and should focus on improving the credit risk management system.   62 Early recognition of problems in asset quality and resolution envisaged in these guidelines requires \nthe lenders to be proactive and make use of CRILC. \n33.2 The boards of banks should put in place a system for proper and timely classification of \nborrowers as wilful defaulters or/and non-cooperative borrowers. Further, Boards of banks should \nperiodically review the accounts classified as such, say on a half yearly basis.    63 PART D - ANNEXES \nAnnex - 1   \nDetails of Gross Advances, Gross NPAs, Net Advances and Net NPAs  \nPart A   \n(Rs. in Crore up to two decimals)  \nParticulars  Amount  \n1.

All transactions must meet \nthe requirements as detailed in the polic y.  \n11. Loan transfers should result in transfer of economic interest without being \naccompanied by any change in underlying terms and conditions of the loan contract  \nusually . In all cases, if there are any modifications to terms and conditions of the \nloan contract during and after transfer (eg. in take -out financing), the same shall be \nevaluated against the definition of  \u2018restructuring\u2019 provided  in Paragraph 1 of the \nAnnex to the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Framework for Resolution of \nStressed Assets) Directions 2019, dated June 7, 2019 . \n12.

In such cases, the roles and responsibilities of the transferor and \ntransferee(s) shall be clearly delineated contractually.  \n13.

A loan transfer should result in immediate separation of the transferor from the  risks \nand rewards associated with loans to the extent that the economic interest has \nbeen transferred.  In case of any retained  economic  interest in the exposure by the \ntransferor, the loan transfer agreement should clearly specify the distribution of the  \nprincipal and  interest income from the transferred loan between the transferor  and \nthe transferee (s).  \n9 \n 16.

The transferor should \nbe able to demonstrate that a notice to this effect has been given to the \ntransferee (s) and that the transferee (s) have acknowledged the absence of such \nobligation.  \n18. Wherever security interest is held by the transferor in trust with the transferee (s) as \nthe beneficiar ies, the transferee (s) shall ensure that a mutually agreed and binding \nmechanism  for timely invocation of such security interest, if the need arises, has \nbeen properly documented and put in place.  \n19. The transfer of loans by transferor (s) must not contravene the rights of underlying \nobligors  and all necessary consents from obligors (including from third parties ), \nwhere  necessary  as per the respective contracts , should have been obtained.  \n20. Any rescheduling, restructuring or re -negotiation of the terms of the underlying \nagreement/s attempted by permitted transferee(s) after the transfer of assets to the \ntransferee(s) shall be as per the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential \nFramework  for Resolution of Stressed Assets) Directions, 2019 issued vide circular \nDBR.No.BP.BC.45/21.04.048/2018 -19 dated June 7, 2019 . \n21. A transferor should notify RBI (Department of Supervision) of all instances where \nit has replaced  loans transferred  to a transferee or paid damages arising out of any \nrepresentation or warranty.   \n10 \n 22. For domestic  transactions, transferee (s) should ensure that the transferor has \nstrictly adhered to the MHP criteria in respect of loans acquired by them, as \nprescribed in Part B of Chapter III of these  directions.  \n23. Transfer as well as acquisition of exposures by  overseas branches of Indian banks  \nshall be required to be in compliance with the requirements prescribed in this \ncircular, without derogation of  any other  statutory or regulatory  provisions, including \nthose  prescribed un der Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.  \nProvided that , in jurisdictions which do not have  regulations related to MHP , \noverseas branches of Indian banks may acquire  such exposures , save for those \noriginated in India, without the requirement of adhering to the MHP criteria . \n24. The extant instructions on outsourcing and the applicable provisions of the Reserve \nBank of India (Know Your Customer (KYC)) Directions, 2016  (as amended from \ntime to time) shall be complied with  in all cases . \n25. In respect of exposures that do not meet the requirements of these directions, \ntransferee(s) shall maintain capital charge equal to the actual exposure acquir ed. \nIn such cases, the transf eror shall continue to recognise the transferred loan in its \nentirety, as if it was not transferred at all in the first place, and the consideration \nreceived shall be recognised as an advance.  \nB. Transferor as servicing facility provide r \n26. The transferee (s) may engage a servicing facility  provider , which may also be the \ntransferor , to administer or service the acquired exposures .  \n27. If a lender, including  a transferor , perfor ms the role of a servicing facility provider \nfor the transferee (s) after the loan transfer has occurred , it should ensure that the \nfollowing conditions are fulfilled:  \na. The nature, purpose, extent of the facility and all required standards of \nperformance should be clearly specified in a written agreement.  \nb. The facility is provided on an 'arm's  length basis' on market terms and \nconditions.   \n11 \n c.

The duration of the facility is limited to the earlie st of the dates on which:  \ni. the underlying loans are completely amortised;  \nii. all claims connected with the transferee (s)\u2019 economic interest in \nthe underlying loans are paid out; or  \niii. the lender 's obligations as the servicing facility provider are \notherwise terminated.  \ne. There should not be any recourse to the lender  beyond the fixed \ncontractual obligations . \nf.

The lender  should be under no obligation to remit funds to the \ntransferee (s) until it has received funds generated from the underlying \nloans . \nh. The lender  shall hold in trust,  on behalf of the transferee (s), the cash \nflows arising from the underlying loans and shall avoid co -mingling of \nthese cash flows with its own cash flows.  \nProvided that  if the above conditions are not satisfied, the lender  shall maintain \ncapital on the loans transferred as if the loans in respect of which servicing \nfacility is being provided are held by it directly on  its books.  \nChapter I II: Transfer of Loans which are not in default  \nA.

The provisions  of this Chapter do not apply to:  \na. transfer of loan accounts of borrowers by a lender to other lenders, at the \nrequest/instance of borrower;  \nb. inter-bank participations covered by the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.57/62 -88 \ndated December 31, 1988 as amended from tim e to time;  \nc. sale of entire portfolio of loans consequent upon a decision to exit the line \nof business completely;  \nd. sale of stressed loans ; and   \n12 \n e. any other arrangement/transactions, specifically exempted by the Reserve \nBank of India.  \n29. The transactions referred to in Clause  28 above  shall be governed by the \nrespective regulatory frameworks. However, in all such cases, the provisions of \nChapter II shall continue  to apply except in cases where the respective regulatory \nframework provides for otherwise.  \n30. A transferor  can transfer a single loan or a part of such loan or a portfolio of such \nloans to permitted transferees  through assignment or novation or a loan \nparticipation contract.  \n31. In cases where loan transfers result in a change of lender of record under a loan \nagreement , the transferor and transferee (s) should ensure that the existing loan \nagreement has suitable enabling provisions  including consent by the underlying \nborrower that allow for such transactions by laying down the required ground rules.  \n32. Transferor \u2019s retention of economic interest, if any, in the loans transferred should \nbe supported  by legally valid documentation. A legal opinion regarding the \nfollowing , at a minimum,  should also be kept on record by the transferor : \na. legal validity of amount of economic interest retained by the transferor;   \nb. the transferor not retaining any risk and rewards associated with the loans \nto the extent transferred to the transferee (s); \nc. the arrangement does not interfer e with transferee (s)\u2019 rights and rewards \nassociated with the loans to the extent transferred to it , except to the extent \nof collaborative action contractually agreed between the transferor and the \ntransferee (s) for enforcement of security, if any , including the scenarios in \nwhich the security interest is held by the transferor in trust for the trustees;  \nand \nd. the arrangement does not result in the transferor becoming an agent, \ntrustee, or fiduciary of the transferee (s), except : \ni. providing servicing facilities extended by the transferor, if any, post \nsuch transfer , to the extent of  rights  to cash  flows in respect of the  \ntransferee (s); and  \n13 \n ii. collaborative action contractually agreed between the transferor and \ntransferee (s) in relation to enforcement of security  including \nscenarios in which the security interes t is held by the transferor in \ntrust for the transferee (s). \n33. There shall not be any difference in the criteria for credit underwriting  applied by \nthe transferor  to exposures transferred and those  held or retained  on their book. \nTo this end, similar  processes for approving and, where relevant, amending, \nrenewing  and monitoring of credit  facilities extended  should be applied by the \ntransferor  for all the loan exposures originated by it . \n34. The transfer shall be only on cash basis and the consideration shall be received \nnot later than at the time of transfer of loans . The transfer consideration should be \narrived at in a transparent manner on an arm's length basis.  \n35. The due diligence  in respect of the loans cannot be outsourced by the transferee (s) \nand should be carried out by its own staff with the same rigour and as per the same \npolicies as would have been done for originating any loan.  \n36. The above due diligence requirements shall be applicable  at the level of each loan . \nIn case of loans acquired a s a portfolio,  in case a transferee is unable to perform \ndue diligence at the individual loan level  for the entire portfolio but can perform due \ndiligence at the individual loan level for not less than  one-third of the portfolio by \nvalue and number of loan s in the portfolio , the due diligence may be performed at \nthe portfolio level  for the remaining , in which case, the transferor has to retain at \nleast 10 per cent of economic interest in the transferred loans.  \nExplanation : If a transfer involves multiple transferees, the minimum retention \nrequirement by the transferor, if any of the transferee s is unable to perform due \ndiligence at the individual loan level, shall be on the entire amount of transferred \nloans, including the portions transferred to transfere es who are able to perform \ndue diligence at the individual loan level.  \n37. Lenders need to monitor on an ongoing basis and in a timely manner performance  \ninformation on the loans acquired , including through conducting periodic stress  \ntests and sensitivity ana lyses,  and take appropriate action  required , if any . The \naction may , inter alia,  include modification to exposure ceilings in respect of certain   \n14 \n types of asset classes, change in ceilings  applicable to transferor , etc. For this \npurpose, transferee (s) should put in place formal policies and procedures \nappropriate to and commensurate with the risk profile of the loans acquired. Such \nprocedures should be as rigorous as that followed by them for portfolios of similar \nloans directly originated by them . The information required for these procedures, if \nnot collected directly by the lenders and obtained from the servicing facility agent, \nif any, should be certified by the authorized officials of the servicing facility agent.  \n38. Depending upon the size of the por tfolio, credit monitoring procedures may include \nverification of the information submitted by the servicing  facility  agent\u2019s concurrent \nand internal auditors. The servicing  facility  agreement should provide for such \nverifications by the auditors of the transferee (s), and wherever applicable, the \ntransferor. All relevant information and audit reports should be available for \nverification by the supervisors from RBI during the supervisi on of the transferee (s) \nand transferor.  \nB. Minimum holding period  (MHP)  \n39. 7The transferor  can transfer loans only after a minimum holding period (MHP), as \nprescribed below, which is counted from the date of registration of the underlying \nsecurity interest  with Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and \nSecurity Interest of India (CERSAI):  \na. Three months in case of loans with tenor of up to 2 years;  \nb. Six months in case of loans with tenor of more than 2 year s. \nProvided that in case of loans wh ere security do es not exist  or security cannot \nbe registered  with CERSAI , the MHP shall be calculated from the date of first \nrepayment of the loan.  \nProvided further that  in case of transfer of project loans, the MHP shall be \ncalculated  from the date of commencement of commercial operations of the \nproject being financed.  \n                                                 \n7 Amended vide amendment dated December 05, 2022   \n15 \n Provided  further  that in case of loans acquired from other entities by a \ntransferor, such loans cannot be transferred before completion of six months \nfrom the date on wh ich the loan was taken into the books of the transferor.  \n8Provided further that  the transfer of receivables, acquired as part of \u2018factoring \nbusiness\u2019 as defined under the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011, will be \nexempted from the above specified MHP requirement subject to fulfilment of \nfollowing conditions:  \ni. The residual maturity o f such receivables, at the time of transfer, should not \nbe more than 90 days, and  \nii. As specified under clauses 10 and 35 of these directions, the transferee \nconducts proper credit appraisal of the drawee of the bill, before acquiring \nsuch receivables  \n40. The above  MHP requirement is not applicable to loans transferred by the arranging \nbank to other lenders under a syndication arrangement.  \nC. Capital Adequacy and other prudential norms   \n41. Any loss  or profit arising because of transfer  of loans , which is realised, should be \naccounted  for accordingly and reflected in the Profit & Loss account of the \ntransferor for the accounting period during which the transfer is completed.  \nHowever, unrealised profits, if any, arising out of such transfers , shal l be deducted \nfrom CET 1 capital or net owned funds for meeting regulatory capital adequacy \nrequirements till the maturity of such loans . \n42. In case of transfer of a pool of loans, the transferee(s) , and the transferor(s) in case \nof retention of economic interest, should maintain borrower -wise accounts. Thus, \nthe exposures of the transferor(s) and the transferee(s) would be to the individual \nobligors in a pool of loans.  \n43. The capital adequacy treatment for loans acquired , in respect of the economic \ninterest  held by the transferor and transferee (s) post such transfer , will be as per \nthe instructions applicable to loans directly originated by the lenders.  \n                                                 \n8 Inserted vide amendment dated December 28, 2023   \n16 \n 44. Transferee (s) may, if they so desire, have the pools of loans externally rated before \nacquiring  so as to  have a third-party  view of the credit quality of the pool in addition \nto their own due diligence. However, such external rating  must be done ex-post the \ntransferee (s)\u2019 due diligence and such rating cannot substitute for the due diligence \nthat the transferee (s) are required to perform.  \n45. The transferee(s) , as well as transferor(s) shall apply the extant income \nrecognition, asset classification and provisioning as well as exposure norms , on \nindividual obligor basis in all cases to the extent of retaine d economic interest .  \n46. In case of pool of loans acquired, transferee(s) should put in place mechanisms to \nenable application of relevant prudential norms on individual obligor basis . Such \nmechanisms may also include relying on the details obtained from the servicing \nfacility provider. However, such mechanisms must provide for adequate checks  by \nthe transferee (s)\u2019 concurrent auditors, internal auditors and statutory auditors. All \nrelevant information and audit reports should be available for verification by the \nsupervisors from RBI during supervision of the transferee (s). \n47. For permitted transferees , the acquired loans will be carried at acquisition cost \nunless it is more  than the outstanding principal  at the time of the transfer , in which \ncase the premium paid , should be amortised based on straight line method or \neffective interest rate method, as considered appropriate by the individual \npermitted transferee . However, the outstanding/unamortised premiu m need not be \ndeducted from capital.  \n48. In cases  where a transferor makes representations and warranties concerning \nloans transferred, the transferor will not be required to hold capital against such \nrepresentations and warranties provided the following cond itions are satisfied:  \na. Any representation or warranty is provided only by way of a formal written \nagreement ;  \nb. The representation or warranty refers to an existing state of facts that is \ncapable of being verified by the transferor at the time the loans are \ntransferred;  \nc. The representation or warranty is not open -ended and, in particular, does \nnot relate to the future creditworthiness of the loans/underlying borrowers ;  \n17 \n d. The exercise of a representation or warranty, if any, requiring a transferor to \nreplace loans  (or any parts thereof ) transferred , on grounds covered in the \nrepresentation or warranty, must be:  \ni. undertaken within 30 days of the transfer of loans; and  \nii. conducted on the same terms and conditions as the original transfer . \nProvided that  upon such replacement, the transferor shall apply the asset \nclassification and provisioning norms as if the reacquired exposures had \nnot been transferred in the first place.  \ne. A transferor that is  required to pay damages for breach of representation or \nwarranty can do so provided the agreement to pay damages meets the \nfollowing conditions:  \ni. the onus of proof for breach of representation or warranty remains at \nall times with the party so alleging;  \nii. the party alleging the breach serves a written Notice of Claim on the \ntransferor , specifying the basis for the claim; and  \niii. damages are limited to losses directly incurred as a result of the \nbreach.  \nChapter I V: Transfer of stressed loans  \nA. General Requirements  \n49. The instructions  contained in this Chapter would cover transfer of stressed loans, \nincluding transfer  to ARCs.  \n50. The transfer  of stressed loans must be done through assignment or novation only; \nloan participation  is not permitted in the case of stressed loans.  \n51. The Board approved  policies of every lender on transfer  and / or acquisition  of \nstressed loans  shall, inter alia , cover the following aspects:  \na. Norms and procedure for transfer  or acquisition  of such loans ; \nb. Valuation methodology to be followed to ensure that the realisable value of \nstressed loans , including the realisability of the underlying security interest, \nif available,  is reasonably estimated;   \n18 \n c. Delegation of powers to various functionaries for taking decision on the \ntransfer or acquisition of the loans ; \nd. Stated objectives for  acquiring  stressed assets ; \ne. Risk premium to be applied for the purpose of Clause 67 ; etc. \n52. The policy on transfer of stressed loans shall be based on the following principles : \na. The process of i dentification of stressed loans beyond a specified value, as \nmay be determined by a lender \u2019s policy, for transfer shall follow a top-down \napproach i.e., the head office/corporate office of the lender  shall be actively \ninvolved in identification of stressed loans  for transfer ; \nb. At a minimum, all loans classified as NPA above a threshold amount  \ndecided by the Board/Board Committee  shall be reviewed by the \nBoard/Board Committee at periodic intervals and a  view, with documented \nrationale, be taken on transfer or otherwise. The loans identified for transfer \nshall be listed for the purpose of transfer as indicated above . \n53. 9Transferors should have clear policies with regard to valuation of loan exposures \nproposed to be transferred. The basis or the grounds which will determine the type \nof valuation used - internal or external - must be clearly specified in the policy. The \ndiscount rate used by the transferor in the internal valuation exercise shall also be  \nspelt out in the policy. This may be either cost of equity or average cost of funds or \nopportunity cost or some other relevant rate, subject to a floor of the contracted \ninterest rate charged . However, in case the credit  exposure  being transferred \n(withou t netting for provisions) , singly, jointly or severally,  is Rs.100 crore or more, \nthe transferor shall obtain two external valuation reports. The cost of valuation \nexercise , external or otherwise,  shall be borne by the transferor.  \n54. In general , lenders shall  transfer stressed loans , including through bilateral sales,  \nonly to permitted transferees and ARCs.  \n55. The manner of transfer must be in terms of the Board approved policy of the \ntransferor. Lenders may also use e -auction platforms, wherever available, for \ntransferring their loans.  \n                                                 \n9 Amended vide amendment dated December 05, 2022   \n19 \n 56. However, when negotiated on a bilateral basis, such negotiations must necessarily  \nbe followed by an auction through Swiss Challenge method if the aggregate \nexposure (including investment exposure) of lenders to the borrower /s whos e loan \nis being transferred is Rs.100 crore  or more . In all other cases, the bilateral \nnegotiations shall be subject to the price discovery and value maximisation \napproaches adopted by the transferor as part of the Board approved policy \ndescribed in Clause 51, which may also include Swiss Challenge method . The \nbroad guidelines to be followed for the Swiss Challenge Method are given in Part \nD of this Chapter.  \nProvided that  in case of transfer of stressed loans undertaken as a resolution \nplan under the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Framework for Resolution of \nStressed Assets) Directions, 2019  with the approval of signatories to the inter-\ncreditor a greement ( ICA) repre senting 75 per cent by value of total outstanding \ncredit facilities (fund based as well non -fund based) and 60 per cent of \nsignatories by number , for the exit of all signatories to the ICA from the stressed \nloan exposure, Swiss Challenge method would be mandatory irrespective of \nthe above exposure threshold.  \n57. The transferor shall ensure that subsequent to transfer of the stressed loans, they \ndo not assume  any operational, legal or any other type of risks relating to the \ntransferred loans including additional funding or commitments to the borrower / \ntransferee(s) with reference to the loan transferred.  Subsequently, fresh exposure \nmay be taken on the  borrower after a cooling period laid down in the respective \nBoard approved policy of the transferor , which  in any case,  shall not be less than \n12 months from the date of such transfer.  \n58. Notwithstanding  the stipulation s in Clause s 54-57, if the transfer of stressed loan s \nare undertaken as a resolution plan under the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential \nFramework for Resolution of Stressed Assets) Directions, 2019  resulting in an exit \nof all lenders  specified at Clause 3  from the stressed loan exposure, such transfer \nis permitted to any class of entities, including a corporate entity, that are permitted \nto take on loan exposures in terms of a statutory provision or under the regulations \nissued by a financial sector regulator, and which are listed in the Annex . The Annex \nwill be updated as and when any new class of entities is permitted by the respective  \n20 \n financial sector regulators. In case such transferee(s) are nei ther ARCs nor \npermitted transferees , the transfer shall be additionally  subject to the following \nconditions:  \n(i) The transferee entity should be incorporated in India or registered with a \nfinancial sector regulator in India  (Securities and Exchange Board of India, \nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, Pension Fund \nRegulatory and Development Authority, and International Financial Services \nCentres Authority) .  \n(ii) The transferee should not be classified as a non -performing account (NPA) \nby any lending institution at the time of such transfer;  \n(iii) The transferee (s) should not fund the loan acquisition through loans from \nlenders specified at Clause 3.   \n(iv) 10The lenders spec ified at Clause 3 should not take any credit /investment \nexposure  apart from working capital facilities (which are not in the nature of  \nterm loans ) to the borrower whose loan account is transferred , for at least \nthree years from the date of such transfer . \n11Provided that the working capital facilities are sanctioned by the lenders \nwhich are not transferors.  \n(v)  12Further, for at least three years from the date of such transfer, the lenders \nspecified at Clause 3 should not take any credit /investment exposure  to the \ntransferee(s) for deployment, either directly or indirectly, into the operations \nof the borrower.  For this purpose, borrower shall mean the legal entities to \nwhich the transferor(s) had exposure which  was transferred to the \ntransferee(s) as a part of the resolution plan , and may include , but is not \nlimited to, a special purpose vehicle having a legal -entity status set up for a \nproject.  \n \nExplanation : The entity permitted to take on loan exposures by its  statutory \nor regulatory framework, as referred to in this clause, would have to be \nseparately enabled by its regulatory or statutory framework for taking on \nloan exposures , and then listed in the Annex to these directions by the \n                                                 \n10 Amended vide amendment dated December 05, 2022  \n11 Inserted vide amendment dated December 05, 2022  \n12 Amended vide amendment dated December 05, 2022   \n21 \n Reserve Bank . The above cl ause merely permits the lenders to transfer \nstressed loans under a resolution plan to such entities which are already \npermitted to take on loan exposures.  The respective financial sector \nregulators shall put in place a framework for this purpose in consult ation with \nthe Reserve Bank.  \n59. The transferor (s) must provide adequate time for due diligence by prospective \nacquirers, which may vary as per the size of the loan. \n60. The loan transfer  agreement shall clearly specify that in the event an ICA is \nrequired to be signed in terms of the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Framework \nfor Resolution of Stressed Assets) Directi ons, 2019  the transferee, regardless of \nthe nature of the entity, shall sign the ICA as and when required.  \n61. The t ransferor (s) shall ensure that no transfer of a stressed loan is made  at a \ncontingent price whereby in the event of shortfall in the realization of the agreed \nprice , the transferor (s) would have to bear a part of the shortfall.  \n62. The t ransferor shall transfer the stressed loans to transferee (s) other than ARCs \nonly on cash b asis. The entire transfer consideration should be received not later \nthan at the time of transfer of loans,  and the loan can be taken out of the books of \nthe transferor only on receipt of the entire transfer consideration. NBFCs which are \nrequired to compl y with IndAS  shall continue to be guided by the Standards and \nthe ICAI Advisories  regarding recognition of the consideration received pursuant to \nthe transfer. In case of other lenders, i f the transfer to transferee(s) other than \nARCs is at a price below the net NBV at the time of transfer , the shortfall shall be \ndebited to the profit and loss account of the year in which transfer has taken place.  \nIf the sale consideration is for a value higher than the NBV at the time of transfer , \nthe excess provisions may be reversed .  \n63. The l enders are permitted to treat a pool of stressed loans acquired on a portfolio \nbasis as a single asset in their books provided that the pool consists of \nhomogeneous personal  loans . Homogeneity should be assessed on the basis of \ncommon risk drivers, including similar risk factors and risk profiles.  In all other \ncases, the stressed loans acquired shall be treated as separate assets for the \npurpose of prudential requirements such as asset classification, capital \ncomputa tion, income recognition etc.   \n22 \n Explanation:  If a portfolio of stressed homogeneous personal loans acquired is \ntreated as a single asset by the transferee, the portfolio shall be treated as a \nsingle asset for the purpose of Clause 67 as well.  \n64. The reporting o bligation, if any, to Credit Information Companies in respect of the \nstressed loans acquired  will be with the transferee (s), if the latter is a credit \ninstitution as defined in sub -section (f) of Section 2 of the Credit Information \nCompanies (Regulation) Act, 2005 . \n65. If the transferee(s) , except ARCs,  have no existing exposure to the borrower whose \nstressed  loan account is acquired, the acquired stressed loan shall be classified as \n\u201cStandard\u201d by the transferee (s). Thereafter, the asset classification status of the \nloan acquired , shall be determined by the record of recovery in the books of the \ntransferee (s) with reference to cash flows estimated at the time of transfer of the \nloan.   \n66. In case the  transferee(s) , exce pt ARCs,  have existing exposure to the borrower \nwhose stressed  loan account is acquired, the asset classification of the acquired \nexposure shall be the same as the existing asset classification of the borrower with \nthe transferee . This treatment shall be applicable even if such acquisition is \npursuant to the transferee being a successful resolution applicant under the \nInsolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.  \n67. The lender acquiring stressed loans shall make provisions for such loans as p er \nthe asset classification status in its books upon acquisition. Regardless of the asset \nclassification , if the net present value of the cash flows  estimated while acquiring \nthe loan is less than the consideration paid for acquiring the loan, provisions shall \nbe maintained to the extent of the difference. For this purpose, the discount factor \nshall be the actual interest rate charged to the borrower as per the original loan \ncontract plus a risk premium to be determined as per the transferee\u2019s  Board \napprov ed policy considering the asset classification of the loan on the books of the \ntransferor . The risk premium will be subject to a floor of 3 per cent.  \nProvided that NBFCs preparing financial statements as per IndAS, shall \ncontinue to make pr ovisions as requ ired as per Ind AS.  However, they shall \nconcurrently assess the provisioning required as per the methodology \nexplained above and provisions so required shall be included in the  \n23 \n computation of the prudential floor as prescribed under Paragraph 2 of the \nAnne x to the circular DOR (NBFC).CC.PD.No.109/22.10.106/2019 -20 dated \nMarch 13, 2020 . \n68. In the case of ARCs, the asset classification of stressed loans acquired by them \nand the associated provisions to be maintained shall be continued to be guided by \nthe extant instructions as applicable to them in this regard . \n69. The lenders  shall hold the acquired stressed loans in their books for a period of at \nleast six months before transferring to other lenders. Lenders are generally \nprohibited from acquiring loans that had been transferred as stressed loans in the \nprevious six months.  \nProvided that  this clause shall not apply if the transfer of a stressed loan is  to \nan ARC or is  undertaken as a resolution plan under the Reserve Bank of India \n(Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets) Directions, 2019  with \nthe approval of signatories to the ICA representing 75 per cent by value of total \noutstanding credit facilities (fund based as well non -fund based) and 60 per cent \nof signatories by number for the exit of all signatories to the ICA from the \nstressed loan exposure . \nB. Additional requirements for transfer of NPAs  \n70. The transferor  shall continue to pursue the staff accountability aspects as per the \nexisting instructions  in respect of the NPAs  transferred to other lenders.  \n71. In respect of NPAs acquired from other lenders, the cash flows received by the \ntransferee from holding such asset should first be used to amortise the funded \noutstanding in the books of the transferee in respect of the loan till the acquisition \ncost is recovered. The cash flows in excess of the acquisition cost, if any, can be \nrecognised as profit.  \n72. The l enders shall assign 100% risk weight to the NPAs acquired from other lenders \nas long as the loans are classified as \u2018standard \u2019 upon acquisition. If the loans are \nclassified as NPA, risk weights as applicable to NPA shall be applicable.  \n \n  \n24 \n C. Transfer of loans  to Asset Reconstruction Companies  \n73. 13Subject to the provisions of the circulars DNBR.PD (ARC) \nCC.No.07/26.03.001/2018 -19 dated June 28, 2019  and DOR.NBFC(ARC) CC. No. \n8/26.03.001/2019 -20 dated December 6, 2019 , all stressed loans which are in \ndefault in the books of the transferors are permitted to be transferred to ARCs .  This \nshall include loan exposures classified as fraud as on the date of transfer  provided \nthat the responsibilities of the transferor with respect to continuous reporting, \nmonitoring , filing of c omplaints with law enforcement agencies and proceedings \nrelated to such complaints shall also be transferred to the ARC. The transfer of \nsuch loan exposures to an ARC , however, does not absolve the transferor from \nfixing the staff accountability as require d under the extant instructions on frauds.  \n74. In case of specific stressed loans , where it is considered necessary, transferor(s) \nshall be free to enter into agreement with the ARC to share, in an agreed \nproportion, any surplus realised by the ARC from the concerned stressed loan. In \nsuch cases, the terms of transfer should provide for a report from the ARC to the \ntransferor(s) on the value realised from the loan. Transferor(s) shall not account for \nthe profit until it has materialised.  \n75. When the stresse d loan is transferred to ARC at a price below the NBV at the time \nof transfer, lenders shall debit the shortfall to the profit and loss account for the \nyear in which the transfer has taken place. Banks are permitted to use \ncountercyclical or floating provi sions for meeting any shortfall on transfer of \nstressed loan when the transfer is at a price below the NBV.  \n76. On the other hand, when the stressed loan is transferred to an ARC for a value \nhigher than the NBV  at the time of transfer , lenders shall reverse the excess \nprovision on transfer to the profit and loss account in the year the amounts are \nreceived and only when the sum of cash received by way of initial consideration \nand / or redemption or transfer  of Security Receipts (SR) / Pass Through \nCertificates (PTCs) / other securities issued by ARCs is higher than the NBV of the \nloan at the time of transfer . Further, such reversal shall be limited to the extent to \nwhich cash received exceeds the NBV of the loan  at the time of transfer . \n                                                 \n13 Amended vide amendment dated December 05, 2022   \n25 \n 77. Investments by lenders in SRs / PTCs  / other securities issued by ARCs shall be \nvalued periodically by reckoning the Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the ARC \nbased on the recovery ratings received for such instruments.  \nProvided that w hen transferors inves t in the SRs/PTCs issued by ARCs in \nrespect of the stressed loans transferred by them to the ARC, the transferors \nshall carry the investment in their books on an ongoing basis, until its transfer \nor realization, at lower of the redemption value of SRs arri ved based on the \nNAV as above, and the NBV of the transferred stressed loan at the time of \ntransfer.  \n14Deleted  \n77A. 15If the investment by the transferor in SRs issued against loans transferred by it \nis more than 10 percent of all SRs issued against the transferred asset, then the \nvaluation of the SRs on the books of the transferor shall be the lower of the \nfollowing:  \ni) value arrived at in terms of clause 77; and  \nii) face value of the SRs reduced by the notional provisioning rate applicable if the \nloans had continued on the books of the transferor.  \n \nProvided that in respect of valuation of investment in SRs outstanding in the \nbooks of lenders specified at sub -clauses 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 3(f) and Local Area \nBanks, as on the date of issuance of these directions (September 24, 2021), the \nfollowing treatmen t shall be applicable:  \na) The difference between the carrying value of such SRs and the valuation arrived \nat in terms of this clause, as on the next financial reporting date after the date of \nissuance of these directions, may be provided over a five -year period starting with \nthe financial year ending March 31, 2022 \u2013 i.e. from FY 2021 -22 till FY 2025 -26. \nb) Subsequent valuation of investments in such SRs on an ongoing basis shall, \nhowever, be strictly in terms of the provisions of these directions.  \n                                                 \n14 Deleted vide amend ment dated December 05, 2022  \n15 Inserted vide amendment dated December 05, 2022   \n26 \n c) Len ders concerned shall put in place a board approved plan to ensure that the \nprovisioning made in each of the financial years in compliance of sub -clause (a) \nabove is not less than one fifth of the required provisioning on this count.  \nd) Valuation of invest ments in SRs made by all lenders after the issuance of these \ndirections shall be strictly in terms of the provisions of these directions.  \n78. SRs/ PTCs  which are not redeemed as at the end of the resolution period (i.e., five \nyears or eight years as the case ma y be) shall be treated as loss asset in books of \nthe lenders and fully provided for.  \n79. The valuation, classification and other norms applicable to investment in non -SLR \ninstruments prescribed by RBI from time to time shall be applicable to lenders\u2019  \ninvestment in debentures/ bonds/ SRs /PTCs issued by ARC. However, if any of \nthe above instruments issued by ARC is limited to the actual realisation of the \nfinancial assets assigned to the instruments in the concerned scheme, the lender  \nshall reckon the NAV obtained from ARC from time to time, for valuation of such \ninvestments.  \n80. There is no prohibition on lenders from taking over standard accounts from ARCs. \nAccordingly, in cases where ARCs have successfully implemented a resolution \nplan for the stressed loans acquired by them, lenders may, at their discretion and \nwith appropriate due diligence, take over such loans after the  period equivalent to \nthe \u2018monitoring  period\u2019 as defined in Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Framework \nfor Resolution of Stressed As sets) Directions, 2019 issued vide circular \nDBR.No.BP.BC.45/21.04.048/2018 -19 dated June 7, 2019 , provided that the \naccount performed satisfactorily , as defined in the cir cular ibid during the said \n\u2018monitoring period\u2019. Lenders shall lay down a board approved policy containing \nvarious aspects governing such take overs viz., type of assets that may be taken \nover, due diligence requirements, viability criteria, performance req uirement of \nasset, etc.  as a part of the requirements under Clause 51. A lender cannot at any \npoint of time acquire from ARCs the loan exposures they have themselves earlier \ntransferred.  \n81. Where stressed loans are taken over by ARCs as agent s for recover y in exchange \nfor a fee, the loans will not be removed from the books of the transferors but  \n27 \n realisations as and when received shall be credited to the loan account s. The \ntransferors shall continue making provisions for the loan in the normal course.  \nD. Price Discovery  through Swiss Challenge Method  \n82. Subject to the requirements under Clause 56, the lenders shall put in place a board \napproved policy on adoption of Swiss Challenge Method for transfer  of their \nstressed loans . The policy  should  specify  the conditions under  which lender (s) may \nopt for Swiss Challenge method, which could be based on parameters such as a \ntolerance limit for extent of haircut required by the lender (s) in the base -bid (as \nspecified in Clause 85), for instance, or any objective parameter identified by the \nlender(s)\u2019 Board. The policy should also specify the minimum mark -up over the \nbase -bid required for  the challenger bid  (as specified in Clause 85) to be \nconsidered by the lender(s) , which in any case, shall not be less than five per  cent \nand shall not be more than 1 5 per cent . For this purpose, mark -up shall be the \ndifference between the challenger bid and the base -bid expressed as a percentage \nof the base -bid. \n83. In case of transfer of stressed  loans  undertaken as a resolution plan under the \nReserve Bank of India (Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets) \nDirections, 2019  with the approval of signatories  to the ICA , the minimum mark -up \nover the base -bid required for the challenger bid to be considered by the lender(s) \nshall be decided with the approval of signatories to the ICA representing 75 per \ncent by value of total outstanding credit facilities (fund  based as well non -fund \nbased) and 60 per cent of signatories by number. The above decision will prevail \nover any individual policy of any of the signatories to the ICA . \n84. On an ongoing basis, the lenders should identify the stressed loans  which will be \noffered for transfer  and an authenticated list of such loans shall be maintained by \nthe lender s. The list may, at the discretion of the lender, be disclosed to prospective  \nbidder on entering into confidentiality agreement.  \n85. The broad  contours of the  Swiss Challenge Method are as under:  \na. A prospective transferee interested in acquiring a specific stressed loan may \noffer a bid to the lender (s), which shall be termed as the base -bid.  \n28 \n b. The lender (s) shall then publicly call for counter bids from other prospective \nbuyers, on comparable terms , by disclosing the essential elements of the \nbase -bid and also clearly specifying the minimum mark -up (as specified in \nClause 82) that would be acceptable.  \nc. If no counter bid  crossed the minimum mark -up specified in the invitation, \nthe base -bid becomes the winning bid. \nd. If counter bid(s) cross the minimum mark -up specified in the invitation, the \nhighest counter bid becomes the challenger bid.  The prospective transferee \nwho prov ided the base -bid is then invited to match the challenger bid. If the \nprospective transferee who provided the base -bid either matches the \nchallenger bid or bids higher than the challenger bid, such bid shall become \nthe winning bid; else, the challenger bid  shall be the winning  bid. \ne. The lenders will then have the following two options:  \ni. Transfer  the loan to winning bidder, as determined above;  \nii. If the lender decides not to transfer the loan to winning bidder, the \nlender will be required to make immediate provision on the account \nto the extent of the higher of the following:  \n\uf0b7 The discount on the book value quoted in the challenger bid , \nand \n\uf0b7 The provisioning required as per extant asset classifi cation \nand provisioning norms.  \nChapter V: Disclosures and Reporting  \n86. The lenders should make appropriate disclosures in their financial statements, \nunder  \u2018Notes to Accounts\u2019, relating to the total amount of loans not in default  / \nstressed loans transferred and acquired to / from  other entities as prescribed \nbelow , on a quarterly  basis starting from the quarter ending on December 31, 2021 : \na. In respect of loans not in default that are transferred or acquired, t he \ndisclosures should cover , inter alia,  aspects such as weighted average \nmaturity, weighted average holding period, retention of beneficial economic \ninterest, coverage of tangible security coverage,  and rating -wise distribution \nof rated loans.  Specifically, a transferor should disclose all inst ances where \nit has agreed to replace loans transferred to transferee (s) or pay damages  \n29 \n arising out of any representation or warranty . The disclosures should also \nprovide break -up of loans transferred / acquired through assignment / \nnovation and loan partic ipation.  \nb. In the case of stressed loans transferred or acquired, the following \ndisclosures should be made:  \nDetails of stressed loans transferred  during the year  (to be made separately \nfor loans  classified as NPA and SMA)  \n(all amounts in Rs. Crore)  To \nARCs  To permitted \ntransferees  To other \ntransferees  \n(please specify)  \nNo: of accounts     \nAggregate principal \noutstanding  of loans \ntransferred     \nWeighted average residual \ntenor of the loans transferred     \nNet book value of loans \ntransferred  (at the time of \ntransfer)     \nAggregate consideration     \nAdditional consideration \nrealized in respect of accounts \ntransferred in earlier years     \nDetails of loans acquired  during the year  \n(all amounts in Rs. Crore)  From lenders listed in \nClause 3  From ARCs  \nAggregate principal \noutstanding  of loans acquired    \nAggregate consideration paid    \nWeighted average residual \ntenor of loans acquired      \n30 \n The transferor(s) should also make appropriate disclosures with regard to the \nquantum of excess provisions reversed to the profit and loss account on account \nof sale of stressed loans.

Transferors shall report each loan transfer transaction undertaken under these \ndirections to a trade reporting platform as notified by the Reserve Bank. The \ndetailed instructions in this regard will be issued separately . In anticipation of the \nsame, lenders  shall maintain a database of loan transfer transactions with \nadequate MIS concerning  each transaction till the reporting platform is notified and \nthe related instructions are issued.  \nChapter VI: Repeal of circulars  \n88.

While complicated and opaque securitisation structures could be undesirable from the point of view of financial stability , prudentially structured \nsecuritisation transactions can be an important facilitator in a well- functioning financial \nmarket  in that it improves risk distribution and liquidity of lenders in originating fresh \nloan exposures . \nGiven the above, i n exercise of the powers conferred by  the Sections 21 and 35A of  \nthe Banking Regulation Act, 1949; Chapter IIIB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934; \nand Sections 30A, 32 and 33 of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, the Reserve \nBank , being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in the public interest so to do, \nhereby, issues the directions hereinafter specified.  \nShort title and commencement  \n1.

\nProvided that the pool containing a s ingle asset  eligible to be securitised  \nis also permitted . \nProvided further that a securitisation structure may have tranches with \ndifferent  maturities.  \n(t) \u201csecuritisation exposures \u201d include but are not restricted to exposures to \nsecuritisation notes issued by the special purpose entity including asset -backed \nsecurities  and mortgage- backed securities, credit enhancements,  underwriting \ncommitments, liquidity facilities, interest rate or currency swaps, credit \nderivatives and tranched cover ; \nExplanation : Reserve accounts, such as cash collateral accounts, which \nis earmarked to absorb credit losses arising from the securitisation and  \nis recorded as an asset by the originator  must also be treated as \nsecuritisation exposures.  \n(u) \u201csecuritisation notes \u201d mean securities issued by the special purpose entity as a \npart of securitisation;  \n(v) \u201csenior tranche\u201d means a tranche which is effectively backed or secured by a \nfirst claim on the entire amount of the assets in the underlying securitised pool ; \nProvided that  where all tranches above the first -loss piece are rated, the \nmost highly rated position would be treated as a senior tranche.  \nProvided that  when there are several tranches that share the same \nrating, only the most senior tranche in the cash flow waterfall would be \ntreated as senior (unless the only difference among them is the effective maturity).   \n7 \n Provided that  when the different ratings of several senior tranches only \nresult from a difference in maturity, all of these tranches should be \ntreated as senior tranche s. \n(w) \u201cspecial purpose entity (SPE) \u201d means a company , trust or other entity organised \nfor a specific purpose, the activities of which are limited to those appropriate to \naccomplish the purpose of the SPE, and the structure of which is intended to \nisolate the SPE from the credit risk of an originator ; \nExplan ation : Any reference to SPE in these directions would also refer \nto the trust settled or declared by the SPE as a part of the process of \nsecuritisation.  \n(x) \u201csubordinate tranche\u201d means any tranche that is junior to the senior tranche(s);  \n(y) \u201csynthetic securitisat ion\u201d means a structure where credit risk of an underlying \npool of exposures is transferred, in whole or in part, through the use of credit \nderivatives or credit guarantees that serve to hedge the credit risk of the \nportfolio which remains on the balance sheet of the lender ; \nExplanation : The above definition does not include the use of \ninstruments permitted to lenders for hedging under the current regulatory \ninstructions.  \n(z) \u201ctranche\u201d means a contractually established segment of the credit risk \nassociated with an exposure or a pool of exposures, where a position in the \nsegment entails a risk of credit loss greater than or less than a position of the same amount in another segment, without taking account of credit protection provided by third parties directly to the holders of positions in the segment or in \nother segments;  \nExplanation: Securitisation notes  issued by the SPE  and credit enhancement  \nfacilities  available shall be treated as tranche s. \n(aa) \u201ctranche maturity \u201d means the tranche\u2019s effective maturity in years, and is \nmeasured as prescribed in Section E of Chapter VI of these directions ;  \n8 \n (bb) \u201ctranche thickness \u201d means the measure calculated as detachment point \n(D) minus attachment point (A), where D and A are calculated in accordance \nwith Section D of Chapter VI of these directions ; \n \nChapter I I: General r equirements for securitisation  \nA. Assets eligible for securit isation \n6. Lenders, including overseas branches of Indian banks, shall not  undertake the \nsecuritisation activities or assume securitisation exposures as mentioned below:  \na. Re-securitisation exposures;  \nb. Structures in which short term instruments such as commercial paper, which \nare periodically rolled over, are issued against long term assets held by a \nSPE \nc. Synthetic securitisation;  and \nd. 1Securitisation with the following assets as underlying:  \ni. revolving credit facilities as underlying \u2013  These involve underlying \nexposures where the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount \nand repayments within an agreed limit under a line of credit (e.g. \ncredit card receivables and cash credit facilities) ; \nii. Restructured loans and advances which are in the specified period;  \niii. Exposures to other lending institutions ; \niv. Refinance exposures of AIFIs;   \nv. Loans with bullet payments of both principal and interest as \nunderlying;  and \nvi. Loans with residual maturity of less than 365 days;  \nProvided that  loans with tenor up to 24 months extended to individuals for \nagricultural activities (as described in Chapter III of  the Reserve Bank of India \n(Priority Sector Lending \u2013  Targets and Classification) Directions, 2020) where \nboth interest and principal are due only on maturity and trade receivables with \ntenor up to 12 months discounted/purchased by lenders from their borrowers \nwill be eligible for securitisation. However, only t hose loans/receivables will be \neligible for securitisation where a borrower (in case of agricultural loans) /a \n                                                 \n1 Amended vide amendment dated December 05, 2022  \n9 \n drawee of the bill (in case of trade receivables) has fully repaid the entire \namount of last two loans/receivables (one loan, in case of agricult ural loans with \nmaturity extending beyond one year) within 90 days of the due date.  In case \nsuch assets are securitised, the investors in the securitisation notes issued \nagainst them should be able to verify the compliance of the underlying asset \nwith the above requirement.  \n \n7. It is clarified that securitisation of exposures held by overseas branches of Indian \nbanks shall not contravene any provision /s of extant legal/regulatory framework, \nincluding Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 and the rules or regulations \nthereunder .  \n8. Subject to the above, all other on- balance sheet exposures of originators, which \nare in the nature of loans  and advances and are classified as Standard, are eligible \nas underly ing assets in a securitisation transaction.  \n9. The originators of such exposures shall have satisfied the Minimum Holding period \nrequirement as per  Clause 39 of the Reserve Bank  of India ( Transfer  of Loan \nExposures ) Directions, 2021  including the proviso to the above C lause.2 \n3Provided that for commercial or residential real estate mortgages, MHP shall \nbe counted from the date of full disbursement of the loan, or registration of \nsecurity interest with Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction \nand Security Interest of India (CERSAI), whichever is later.  \n                                                 \n2 The transferor  can transfer loans only after a minimum holding period (MHP), as prescribed below, \nwhich is counted from the date of registration of the underlying security interest:  \na. Three months in case of loans with tenor of up to 2 years;  \nb. Six months in case of loans with tenor of more than 2 years.  \nProvided that in case of loans where security does not exist or security cannot be registered, \nthe MHP shall be calculated from the date of first repayment of the loan.  \nProvided further that  in case of transfer of project loans, the MHP shall be calculated from the \ndate of commencement of commercial operations of the project being financed.  \nProvided further that  in case of loans acquired from other entities by a transferor, such loans \ncannot be transferred before completion of six months from the date on which the loan was \ntaken into the books of the transferor.  \n \n3 Inserted vide amendment dated December 05, 2022   \n10 \n 10. The MHP will be applicable to individual loans in the underlying pool of securitised \nloans. MHP will not be applicable to loans referred to in the proviso to C lause 6. \n11. The transactions undertaken in terms of these directions must not contravene the \nrights of underlying obligors. To ensure compliance with this stipulation, enabling \nclauses must be included in the contract between originator and servicing agent \nand all necessary consent from obligors (including from t hird parties), where \nnecessary as per the respective contracts, should have been obtained.  \nB. Minimum Retention Requirement (MRR)  \n12. The MRR is primarily designed to ensure that the originators  have a continuing \nstake in the performance of securitised assets so as to ensure that they carry out \nproper due diligence of loans to be securitised. The originators  should adhere to \nthe MRR as detailed below while securitising loans  leading to issuance of \nsecuritisation notes other than residential mortgage backed securities : \na. For underlying loans with original maturity of 24 months or less, the MRR \nshall be 5% of the book value of the loans  being securitised.  \nb. For underlying loans with original maturity of more than 24 months as well \nas loans with bullet repayments, as mentioned in proviso to C lause 6, the \nMRR shall be 10% of the book value of the loans being securitised.  \n13. In the case of residential mortgage backed securities, the MRR for the originator \nshall be 5% of the book value of the loans being securitised, irrespective of the \noriginal maturity . \n14. The MRR shall  be retained by the originator as follows:  \na. Upto 5 per cent of the book value of loans being securitised:  \n\u2022 First loss facility, if available;  \n\u2022 If first loss facility is not available, or where retention of the entire \nfirst loss facility amounts to less than 5 per cent, balance \nthrough retention of equity tranche;  \n\u2022 Where retention of the entire first loss facility, if available, and \nequity tranche amounts to less than 5 per cent, balance pari \npassu in remaining tranches sold to investors.   \n11 \n b. Greater than 5 per cent of the book value of loans being securitised:  \n\u2022 First loss facility, or equity tranche or any other  tranche sold to \ninvestors, in any combination thereof.   \n \nExplanation : It is clarified that first loss facility for this purpose shall not include \novercollateralization available, if any.  \n15. Investment in the Interest Only Strip representing the Excess Interest Spread/ \nFuture Margin Income, whether or not subordinated, will not be counted towards \nthe MRR.  \n16. MRR should not be reduced either through hedging of credit risk or selling or \nencumbering the retained interest. MRR has to be maintained by the originat ing \nlender  itself and not by any of its group entities. The form of MRR should not \nchange during the life of securitisation. The MRR as a percentage of unamortised \nprincipal should be maintained on an ongoing basis except for reduction of retained \nexposure due to repayment or through the absorption of losses. Specifically, in \ncases of securitisations featuring replenishment period, MRR should be maintained \nnot only at  the initiation of the securitisation but also at the end of the replenishment \nperiod.  \n17. For complying with the MRR under  these guidelines lenders should ensure that \nproper documentation in accordance with law is made.  \nC. Origination Standards \n18. Underwriting standards  for exposures securitised should not be less stringent than \nthose applied to exposures  retained on the balance sheet of the originator. Where \nunderwriting standards  change between the loan origination and till all the claims \nassociated with securitised note are paid- off, the originator should disclose to the \nentities having securitisation exposures the timing and purpose of such changes.  \n19. In cases of securitisation of exposures purchased by originator from other lenders, \nthe requirements applicable for underwriting standards  shall apply to the standards \nof due diligence process adopted by the originator  which may include verification \nof sufficiency and consistency of loan origination process of the lender from whom \nthe exposures were purchased by the originator .  \n12 \n D. Payment priorities and observability  \n20. To prevent investors being subjected to unexpected repayment profiles during the \nlife of a securitisation, the priorities of payments for all liabilities in all circumstances \nshould be clearly defined at the time of securitisation and appropriate legal comfor t \nregarding their enforceability should be provided.  \n21. To help provide investors with full transparency over any changes to the cash flow \nwaterfall, payment profile or priority of payments that might affect a securitisation, \nall triggers affecting the cash f low waterfall, payment profile or priority of payments \nof the securitisation should be clearly and fully disclosed in offer documents and in \ninvestor reports, with information in the investor report that clearly identifies the \nbreach status  in respect of expected cash flows to the note holders , the ability for \nthe breach to be reversed and the consequences of the breach.  \n22. To ensure rights and interest of the securitisation note holders are protected, \ndefinitions, policies and remedies pertaining to the contours and caveats around \nthe performance of the underlying loans must be suitably communicated. Further, \nthe rights and control of the securitisation note holders must be documented to \naccount for all circumstances, including insolvency of all entities invol ved in \nsecuritisation,  such as the originator SPE , etc . Full disclosure and supporting \ndocumentation regarding legal and financial risk factors must be made available to \nprospective and existing investors within a reasonable period of time, on an \nongoing or on demand basis.  \n23. Securitisations featuring a replenishment period should include provisions for \nappropriate early amortisation events and/or triggers of termination of the replenishment period, including, notably:  \na. deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;  \nb. a failure to acquire sufficient new underlying exposures of similar credit quality; and \nc. the occurrence of an insolvency -related event with regard to the \noriginator (s). \n24.  In the event actions of associated institutional stakeholders  (originator, SPE, \nservicing agent, credit enhancement provider and others) that are not prohibited in \nthis framework, result in material alteration of the risk profile of the securitisation  \n13 \n notes  at any point, the originator shall ensure that same is adequately informed \nand disclosed to investors, credit rating agencies and other service providers within \na maximum time frame of 14 calendar days.  \nE. Limit on Total Retained Exposures by Originators \n25. The total exposure of  an originator  to the securitisation exposures belonging to a \nparticular securitisation structure or scheme should not exceed 20% of the  total \nsecuritisation exposures created by such structure or scheme.  However, the \nexposure of originators to credit enhancing interest only strip shall be excluded \nfrom this limit.  \n26. Credit exposure on account of interest rate swaps/currency swaps entered into with \nthe SPE will be excluded from this limit.  \n27. The 20% limit on total retained exposures will not be deemed to have been \nbreached if it is exceeded due to amortisation of securitisation notes issued.  \nF. Issuance and Listing  \n28. The minimum ticket size for issuance of securitisation notes shall be Rs.1 crore.  \n4Explanation: Ticket size, for the purpose of these directions, refers to the size of \ninvestment by a single investor.  \n29.  Listing of securitisation notes, e specially in respect of  certain product class , such \nas RMBS,  and/or generally above a certain threshold is recommended, though not \nmandatory . In any case, any offer of securitisation notes to fifty or more persons in \nan issuance would be required to be listed in terms of Securities and Exchange \nBoard of India (Issue and Listing of Securitised Debt Instruments and Security \nReceipts ) Regulations, 2008.  \nG. Conditions to be satisfied by the special purpose entity  \n30. The SPE should meet the following criteria to enable the originator to apply the \nguidelines on capital adequacy and other aspects as prescribed in these directions \nwith regard to the securitisation exposures assumed by it:  \n                                                 \n4 Inserted vide amendment dated December 05, 2022   \n14 \n a. Any transaction between the originator and the SPE should be strictly on \narm\u2019s length basis.  \nb. The SPE  and the trustee should not resemble in name or imply any \nconnection or relationship with the or iginator of the assets in its title or name.  \nc. The originator should not have any ownership, proprietary or beneficial \ninterest in the SPE  except those specifically permitted under these \ndirections . The originator should not hold any share capital in the SPE.  \nd. The originator should not have more than one representative, without veto \npower , on the board of the SPE  provided the board has at least four \nmembers and independent directors are in majority.  \ne. If the SPE is set up as a trust, then:  \ni. The originator shall not exercise control, directly or indirectly, over the \nSPE and the trustees , and shall not settle the trust deed, if any . \nii. The originator shall not have any ownership, proprietary or beneficial \ninterest in the trustees.  \niii. The SPE  should be bankruptcy remote and non- discretionary.  \niv. The trust deed, if any,  should lay down, in detail, the functions to be \nperformed by the trustee, their rights and obligations as well as the \nrights and obligations of the investors in relation to the sec uritised \nassets. The t rust deed should not provide for any discretion to the \ntrustee as to the manner of disposal and management or application \nof the trust property. In order to protect their interests, investors \nshould be empowered in the trust deed to c hange the trustee at any \npoint of time.  \nv. The trustee should only perform trusteeship functions in relation to \nthe SPE and should not undertake any other business with the SPE . \nvi. A copy of the trust deed, if any, and the accounts and statement of \naffairs of the SPE should be made available by the originator and/or \nother lenders , to the RBI, if required to do so.   \n15 \n f. The originator shall not support the losses of the SPE  except under the \nfacilities explicitly permitted under these directions  and shall also not be \nliable to meet t he recurring expenses of the SPE . \ng. The SPE  should make it clear to the investors in the securitisation notes \nissued by it that these securitisation notes are not insured and that they do \nnot represent deposit liabilities of the originator, servicer or trustees.  \n31. In cases where the originator has purchased loans from another lender , the \nprovisions of Clause 30 shall apply to the lender from whom the originator has \npurchased the exposures, as well.  \nProvided that  for the purpose of sub- clause (d) of C lause 30, only one of either \nthe originator or the lender from whom loans were purchased by the originator, \nmay have the representative on the board of the SPE.   \nH. Representations and Warranties \n32. An originator that sells assets to SPE may make representations and warranties \nconcerning those assets. The  originator will be required to hold capital against such \nrepresentations and warranties  if any of the following condi tions are not satisfied:  \na. Any representation or warranty is provided only by way of a formal written \nagreement.  \nb. The originator undertakes appropriate due diligence before providing or \naccepting any representation or warranty.  \nc. The representation or warranty refers to an existing state of facts that is \ncapable of being verified by the originator at the time the assets are sold.  \nd. The representation or warranty is not open -ended and, in particular, does \nnot relate to the future creditworthiness of the assets, the performance of \nthe SPE and/or the securitisation  notes the SPE issues.  \ne. The exercise of a representation or warranty, requiring an originator to \nreplace assets (or any parts of them) sold to a SPE, must be:  \ni. undertaken within 120 days of the transfer of assets to the SPE; and  \nii. conducted on the same terms and conditions as the original sale.  \nf. An originator that is required to pay damages for breach of representation \nor warranty can do so provided the agreement to  pay damages meets the \nfollowing conditions:   \n16 \n i. the onus of proof for breach of representation or warranty remains at \nall times with the party so alleging;  \nii. the party alleging the breach serves a written Notice of Claim, \nspecifying the basis for the claim; and \niii. damages are limited to losses directly incurred as a result of the \nbreach.  \ng. An originator should notify RBI (Department of Supervision) of all instances  \nwhere it has agreed to replace assets sold to SPE  or pay damages arising \nout of any representation or w arranty.  \nI. Accounting provisions \n33. Originators shall sell assets to SPE only on cash basis and the sale consideration \nshould be received not later than the transfer of the asset to the SPE.  Further, there \nshould not be gap of more than 30 days between transfer of the assets and the \nissuance of securitisation notes . \n34. NBFCs which are required to comply with Indian Accounting Standards (IndAS) \nshall continue to be guided by the Standards and the ICAI Advisories with respect \nto accounting for securitisation exposures and transactions.  \n35. In case of other lenders, any loss, profit or premium realised at the time of the sale \nshould be accounted accordingly and reflected in the Profit & Loss account for  the \naccounting period during which the sale is completed.   \n36. For such lenders  specified at C lause 35, the following treatment shall be applicable \nin the case of unrealised gains arising out of sale of underlying assets to the SPE  \nsuch as that associated with expected future margin income (represented by \ninterest -only strips or otherwise) : \na. The unrealised gains  should not be recognised in Profit and Loss account; \ninstead the lenders  shall hold the unrealised profit under an accounti ng head \nstyled as \u201c Unrealised Gain on Loan Transfer Transactions \u201d. \nb. The profit may be recognised in Profit and Loss Account only when such \nunrealised gains associated with expected future margin income is \nredeemed in cash. However, if the unrealised gains associated with \nexpected future margin income is credit enhancing (for example, in the form  \n17 \n of credit enhan cing interest -only strip), t he balance in this account may be \ntreated as a provision against potential losses incurred.  \nc. In the case of amortising credit -enhancing interest -only strip, a lender would \nperiodically receive in cash, only the amount which is left after absorbing \nlosses, if any, supported by the credit -enhancing interest -only strip . On \nreceipt, this amount may be credited to Profit and Loss account and the \namount equivalent to the amortisation due may be written- off against the \n\u201cUnrealised Gain on Loan Transfer Transactions \u201d account bringing down the \nbook value of the credit -enhancing int erest -only strip in the lender\u2019s books.  \nd. In the case of a non- amortising credit -enhancing interest -only strip, as and \nwhen the lender receives intimation of charging- off of losses by the SPE \nagainst the credit -enhancing interest -only strip, it may write -off equivalent \namount against \u201c Unrealised Gain on Loan Transfer Transactions \u201d account \nand bring down the book value of the credit -enhancing interest -only strip in \nthe lender\u2019s books. The amount received in final redemption value of the \ncredit -enhancing interest -only strip received in cash may be taken to Profit \nand Loss account.  \nChapter III: Simple, transparent and comparable (STC) securitisations  \n37. Only securitisations that additionally satisfy all the criteria laid out in Annex 1 of \nthese directions fall within the scope of the STC framework. The above criteria are \nbased on the prescriptions of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. \nExposures to securitisations that are STC -compliant can be subject to the \nalternative capital treatment as determined by  Clauses 108 to 110. \n38. The originator must disclose to investors all necessary information at the \ntransaction level to allow investors to determine whether the securitisation is STC -\ncompliant. Based on the information provided by the originator, the investor must \nmake its own assessment of the securitisation\u2018s STC compliance status before \napplying the alternative capital treatment.  \n39. For securitisation exposures retained by the originator, where significant credit risk \ntransfer in terms of the requirements of the C lauses 81 and 82 have been achieved  \n18 \n by the originator , the determination of compliance with STC requirements  shall be \nmade by the originator.  \n40. STC criteria need to be met at all times. Checking the compliance with some of the \ncriteria might only be necessary at origination (or at the time of initiating the \nexposure, in case of guarantees or liquidity facilities) of an STC securitisation. \nNotwithstanding, investors and holders of the securitisation positions are expected \nto take into account developments that may invalidate the previous compliance \nassessment, for example deficiencies in the frequency and content of the investor \nreports, in the alignment of interest, or changes in the t ransaction documentation \nat variance with relevant STC criteria.  \n41. In cases where the cri teria refer to underlying, and the pool is dynamic, the \ncompliance with the criteria will be subject to dynamic checks every time that \nassets are added to the pool.  The criteria for the addition of assets shall be clearly \ndescribed in relevant transaction documents.  \n42. Investors should consider whether the originator, servicer and other parties with a \nfiduciary responsibility to the securitisation note holders have an establ ished \nperformance history for substantially similar credit claims or receivables to those \nbeing securitised and for an appropriately long period of time.  \n43. RBI would verify the preferential regulatory capital treatment assignments made by \nthe lenders, includ ing the originator, as part of the supervisory review. If it is \ndiscovered that a transaction does not satisfy the STC criteria for regulatory capital \npurposes, RBI would take appropriate supervisory action including inter alia  \nadditional capital under the Pillar 2 framework, and/ or by denying preferential \nregulatory capital treatment for that specific transaction and potentially others as \nwell. \nChapter I V: Provision of facilities supporting securitisation structures \nA. General conditions \n44. Lenders may provide supporting facilities such as credit enhancement facilities, \nliquidity facilities, underwriting facilities and servicing facilities.  Apart from lenders, \nsince such facilities may also be provided by entities that are not lenders, entities \nproviding such facilities are generally referred to in these directions as \u201cfacility  \n19 \n providers\u201d.  Such facility provider (s) must be regulated by at  least one financial \nsector regulator.  \n45. The facilities, as above, provided by facility providers should satisfy the following \nconditions, in addition to the specific conditions applicable to each facility as \nprescribed in the remaining sections of this Chapter:  \na. Provision of the facility should be structured in a manner to keep it distinct \nfrom other facilities and documented separately from any other facility \nprovided by the facility provider . The nature, purpose, extent of the facility \nand all required standards  of performance should be clearly specified in a \nwritten agreement to be executed at the time of originating the transaction \nand disclosed in the offer document.  \nb. The facility is provided on an 'arm's length basis' on market terms and \nconditions, and subjec ted to the facility provider\u2019s normal credit approval and \nreview process.  \nc. Payment of any fee or other income for the facility is not subordinated or \nsubject to deferral or waiver.  \nd. The facility is limited to a specified amount and duration.  \ne. The duration of the facility is limited to the earlier of the dates on which:  \ni. all claims connected with the securitisation notes issued by the SPE \nare paid out; or  \nii. the facility provider's obligations in relation to such facility are \notherwise terminated.  \nf. There should not be any recourse to the facility provider beyond the fixed \ncontractual obligations. In particular, the facility provider should not bear any \nrecurring expenses of the securitisation.  \ng. The facility provider has obtained legal opinion that the terms of agreement \nprotect it from any liability to the investors in the securitisation or to the SPE \n/ trustee, except in relation to its contractual obligations pursuant to the \nagreement governing provision of the facility.   \n20 \n h. The SPE and/or investors in the securitisation  notes issued by the SPE have \nthe clear right to select an alternative party to provide the facility  subject to \ncompliance of instructions in this direction.  \nB. Credit enhancement facilities  \n46. Credit enhancement is the process of enhancing credit profile of a structured \nfinancial transaction through provision of additional security/financial support, for \ncovering losses on securitised assets in adverse conditions. The enhancements \ncan be broadly divided into two types viz. internal credit enhancement and external \ncredit enhancement. A credit enhancement which, for the investors, creates \nexposure to entities other than the underlying borrowers is called the external credit \nenhancement. For instance, cash collaterals and first/second loss guarantees are \nexternal f orms of credit enhancements. Investment in subordinated tranches, over -\ncollateralisation, excess spreads, credit enhancing interest -only strips are internal \nforms of credit enhancements.  \n47. Credit enhancement facilities include all arrangements that could res ult in a facility \nprovider absorbing losses of the  investors  in a securitisation transaction. Such \nfacilities may be provided by both originators and third parties. The facility provider \nproviding credit enhancement facilities should ensure that the follow ing conditions \nare fulfilled failing which credit enhancement provider will be required to hold capital \nequal to the full value of the securitised assets : \na. All conditions specified in C lause 44-45. \nb. Credit enhancement facility should be provided only at the initiation of the \nsecuritisation transaction.  \nc. The amount of credit enhancement extended at the initiation of the \nsecuritisation transaction should be available to the SPE during the entire \nlife of the securitisation  notes in respect of which such credit enhancement \nis provided, subject to any resets of such credit enhancement specifically \npermitted under these directions.   \nd. Any utilization / draw down of the credit enhancement should be immediately \nwritten -off by debit to the profit and loss account  by facility provider .  \n21 \n C. Reset of credit enhancements  \n48. Resets can be applied to external forms of credit enhancement s, which is in first or \nsecond loss position. The original amount of external credit enhancements \nprovided at the time of initiation of securit isation transaction can be reset by the \ncredit enhancement provider subject to the conditions enumerated below.  \na. At the time of reset, all the outstanding tranches of securitisation notes \nshould be re- rated (other than equity tranches). The first reset of credit \nenhancement will not be permitted if the rating of any of the tranches has \ndeteriorated vis -a-vis the original rating of these securiti sation positions. \nSubsequent resets would not be permitted if the rating of any of the tranches \nhas deteriorated v is-\u00e0-vis the rating at the time of previous reset.  \nb. If reset is permissi ble in terms of (a ) above, the amount of credit \nenhancement required for retaining the original or current outstanding \nrating, whichever is higher should be determined by the concerned rating \nagency  for the first reset. Similarly, for subsequent resets, the amount of \ncredit enhancement required for retaining the higher of the rating at the time \nof previous reset and current outstanding rating should be determined by \nthe concerned rating agency.  \nProvided that  only the rating agency , subject to it s continued rating \noperations , which had rated the securiti sation transaction initially shall \nre-rate it for the purpose of reset of credit enhancement.  Enabling \nclauses and commercial terms must be made part of the initial contract \nto ensure the implementation of this regulatory advisory failing which \ncredit enhancement reset cannot be executed.  \nc. The reset of credit enhancement would be subject to the consent of the \ninvestors in the securitisation notes . The consent may either be explicitly \nobtained during every reset or the transactions documents may contain \ngeneral c lauses providing implicit consent of the investors for rest of credit \nenhancement.  \nd. The reset of credit enhancement should be provided for in the contractual \nterms of the transaction and the initial rating of the transaction should take  \n22 \n into account the likelihood of resets.  Such contractual clause should include \nclearly defined portfolio- level delinquency triggers, which, if met, should \nresult in the credit enhancement res ets not available or possible.  \ne. In case such a contractual clause was not available originally, reset of credit \nenhancement may be carried out subject to the consent of all investors of \noutstanding securitisation notes . \nf. In structures where external credit enhancements exist providing first loss \ncredit enhancement (FLCE) and second loss credit enhancement (SLCE), \nthe reset may be carried out simultaneously between FLCE and SLCE in a \nproportion such that the reset maintains at least the outstanding rating [as \nenvisaged in (b ) above] of SLCE.  \ng. Reset of equity tranche is not allowed as it would tantamount to a res et of \nan internal credit enhancement.  \n49. For all securitisat ions other than residential mortgage backed- securitisations, at the \ntime of first reset, at least 50% of the total principal amount assigned at the time of \ninitiation of the securiti sation transaction must have been amortised. The \nsubsequent resets may be carried out after the p ool principal has amortised in \nsteps of 10%, i.e., up to at least 60%, 70% and 80% of the original level. However, \na minimum gap of six months should be maintai ned between successive resets.  \n50. For residential mortgage- backed securitisations, at the time of first reset, at least \n25% of the total principal amount assigned at the time of initiation of the \nsecuriti sation transaction must have been amortised. The subsequent resets may \nbe carried out at every 10%  (of the original level)  further amortisation of the pool \nprincipal. A minimum gap of six months  should be maintained between successive \nresets.  \n51. The excess credit enhancement can be released subject to the followi ng \nconditions:  \na. The release of credit enhancement would be subject to a reserve floor as a \npercentage of the initial credit enhancement provided at the time of \ntransaction, i.e., at any time, the level of credit enhancement available, \nfollowing any reset shall not drop below the prescribed reserve floor . Thus,  \n23 \n even if the required level of credit enhancement to maintain the ratings, as \nassessed by the credit rating agency during a reset, is lower than the \nreserve floor, the excess amount available for reset shall be computed as \nthe difference between the available credit enhancement and the reserve \nfloor.  \nb. The stipulation of the floor may be based on the transaction structure, \ndepending on asset class, the track record of the originator and other pool \nspecif ic factors such as concentration of long term contracts in a pool, and \nin no case should be less than:  \ni. 30% of the initial credit enhancement for securitisations other than \nresidential mortgage backed- securitisations; and  \nii. 20% of the initial credit enhancement for residential mortgage \nbacked- securitisations.  \nc. A maximum of 60% of the credit enhancement in excess of that required to \nretain the credit rating of all the tranches as referred to in sub- clause (b) of \nClause 48 assigned to them can be considered for r elease, at any point of \ntime subject to fulfilling  the reserve floor indicated at (a) above.  \nd. The reset should not lead to exposures retained by originators along with \ncredit enhancements offered by them falling below the level of MRR \nprescribed in Section B of Chapter II of these directions.  \n52. In order to facilitate a common understanding amongst stakeholders and to allow \nthe market to understand the linkage between good pool performance and CE \nreset, credit rating agencies  will disseminate information pertai ning to CE reset via \npress release and would confirm that ratings will not be adversely affected by such \nreset.  \nD. Liquidity facilities  \n53. A liquidity facility is provided to help smoothen the timing differences faced by the \nSPE between the receipt of cash flows from the underlying assets and the \npayments to be made to investors. A liquidity facility should meet all of the following  \n24 \n conditions to guard against the possibility of the facility functioning as a form of \ncredit enha ncement and/ or credit support:  \na. All conditions specified in C lause s 44-45. \nb. The documentation for the facility must clearly define the circumstances \nunder which the facil ity may or may not be drawn on.  \nc. The facility should be capable of being drawn only where there is a sufficient \nlevel of non -defaulted assets to cover drawings, or the full amount of assets \nthat may turn non- performing are covered by a substantial credit \nenhancement.  \nd. The facility shall not be drawn for the purpose of:  \ni. providing credit enhancement;  \nii. covering losses of the SPE;  \niii. serving as a permanent revolving funding, i.e., liquidity support \nshould be an exception rather than the norm ; and \niv. covering any losses incurred in the underlying pool of exposures prior \nto a draw down.  \ne. The liquidity facility should not be available for the following purposes:  \ni. meeting recurring expenses of securitisation;  \nii. funding acquisition of additional assets by the SPE;  \niii. funding the final scheduled repayment of investors; and  \niv. funding breaches of warranties.  \nf. Facility should be provided to SPE and not directly to the investors.  \ng. When the liquidity facility has been drawn the facility provider shall have a \npriority of claim over the future c ash flows from the underlying assets, and \nthus will be senior to the senior tranche.  \nh. The originator must not be liable to meet any shortfall in liquidity support \nprovided by any independent third party.  \n54. If any of the conditions are not satisfied, a liquidity facility will be regarded as \nserving the economic purpose of credit enhancement .  In such cases,  the liquidity \nfacility provided by a third party shall be treated as a credit enhancement .  \n25 \n 55. Since the li quidity facility is meant to smoothen temporary cash flow mismatches, \nthe facility will remain drawn only for short periods , preferably not used for two \nconsecutive repayments  to investors . If the drawings under the facility are \noutstanding for more than 90 days it should be classified as NPA and fully provided \nfor. \nE. Underwriting facilities \n56. An originator or a third- party service provider may act as an underwriter fo r the \nissue of securitisation notes by SPE and treat the facility as an underwriting facility \nfor capital adequacy purposes subject to the following conditions:  \na. All conditions specified in C lause s 44-45 are satisfied.  \nb. The underwriting is exercisable only when the SPE  cannot issue \nsecuritisation notes into the market at a price equal to or above the \nbenchmark predetermined in the underwriting agreement.  \nc. The facility provider has the ability to withhold payment and to terminate the \nfacility, if necessary, upon the occurrence of specified events (e. g. material \nadverse changes or defaults on assets above a specified level); and \n57. In case any of the above conditions are not satisfied, the facility will be considered \nas a credit enhancement . \n58. An originator may underwrite only investment grade senior notes issued by the \nSPE. The holdings of securitisation notes devolved to the originator through \nunderwriting would not attract provisions of C lause 25 provided they are sold to \nunrelated third parties within three- month period following the acquisition. For the \nperiod between acquisition and upto three months, the originator will maintain \ncapital equal to as if the exposures were held on the books of the originator.  \nF. Servicing Facilities \n59. A servicing facility provider administers or services the securitised assets . Hence, \nit should not have any obligation to support any losses incurred by the SPE , except \nto the extent contractually provided in the servicing facility agreement indemnifying \nthe SPE from defaults, breaches, negligence or fraud by the servicing facilit y \nprovider , and should be able to demonstrate this to the investors  in the  \n26 \n securitisation exposures . A facility provider  performing the role of a service provider \nfor a proprietary or a third- party securitisation transaction should ensure that the \nfollowing conditions are fulfilled:  \na. All conditions specified in C lause s 44-45. \nb. The service provider should be under no obligation to remit funds to the SPE \nor investors until it has received funds generated from the underlying assets \nexcept where it is  also the provider of an eligible liquidity facility.  \nc. The service provider shall hold in trust, on behalf of the investors,  the cash \nflows arising from the underlying and should avoid co- mingling of these cash \nflows with their own cash flows.  \nd. The service provider should remit all the cashflows arising from the \nunderlying loans forming part of the securitised pools to the SPE a s per the \nagreed mechanism, irrespective of any retained interest in the securitisation \ntransaction in other capacities.  \n60. Where any of the above conditions are not met, the service provider may be \ndeemed as providing liquidity facility to the SPE or investors and treated \naccordingly for capital adequacy purpose.  \nChapter V: Requirements to be met by lenders who are investors in \nsecuritisation exposures \nA. Due Diligence Requirements \n61. Lenders can invest in securitised notes only if the originator has explicitly disclosed \nto the purchasing lenders that it has adhered to the MRR  and MHP requirements \nand will adhere to MRR on an ongoing basis, as applicable and advised in this \ndirection.  \n62. For the overseas branches of Indian lenders, they should not invest or assume \nexposure to securitisation positions in other jurisdictions which have not laid down any MRR. Regarding MHP, the overseas branches of Indian lenders operating in jurisdictions wh ich do not have regulations related to MHP, may comply with \nregulations prescribed in those jurisdictions . \n  \n27 \n 63. Further, only if the originator has explicitly disclosed that it has complied with the \napplicable provisions of the Reserve Bank of India (Know Your Customer (KYC)) \nDirections, 2016 (as amended from time to time) , lenders may invest in  such  \nsecuritised notes.  \n64. Lenders must have a comprehensi ve understanding of the risk characteristics of \nits individual securitisation exposures as well as the risk characteristics of the pools \nunderlying its securitisation exposures, at all times.  Lenders also have to \ndemonstrate that for making such an assessm ent they have implemented formal \npolicies and procedures as appropriate.  \n65. Lenders should be able to access performance information on the underlying pools \non an ongoing basis. Such information may include, as appropriate, but not limited \nto the following: the average credit quality  through average credit scores or similar \naggregates of creditworthiness , extent of diversification of the pool of loans, \nvolatility  of the market values of the collaterals supporting the loans, cyclicality of \nthe economic activities in which the underlying borrowers are engaged, exposure \ntype, prepayment rates, property types, occupancy, etc.  \n66. Lenders should have a thorough understandi ng of all structural features of a \nsecuritisation transaction that would materially impact the performance of their \nexposures to the transaction.  Such information may include, as appropriate, but \nnot limited to the following: seniority of the tranche, thic kness of the subordinate \ntranches, its sensitivity to prepayment risk and credit enhancement resets, \nstructure of repayment waterfalls, waterfall related triggers, the position of the \ntranche in sequential repayment of tranches, liquidity enhancements, availability of \ncredit enhancements in the case of liquidity facilities, deal -specific definition of \ndefault, etc.  \n67. Apart from the above, lenders should take note of, analyse and record the following \nwhile taking the decision regarding a securitisation exposur e: \na. the reputation of the originators in terms of observance of credit appraisal \nand credit monitoring standards, due diligence standards in case the \nsecuritised assets had been purchased, adherence to minimum retention \nand minimum holding standards in earl ier securitisations, and fairness in \nselecting exposures for securitisation;   \n28 \n b. loss experience in earlier securitisations of the originators in the relevant \nexposure classes underlying the securitisation position, incidence of any \nfrauds committed by the underlying borrowers, truthfulness of the \nrepresentations and warranties made by the originator;  \nc. the statements and disclosures made by the originators, or their agents or \nadvisors, about their due diligence on the securitised exposures and, where \napplicable,  on the quality of the collateral supporting the securitised \nexposures; and \nd. where applicable, the methodologies and concepts on which the valuation \nof collateral supporting the securitised exposures is based and the policies \nadopted by the originator to ensure the independence of the valuer.  \nB. Stress testing \n68. Lenders should regularly perform their own stress tests appropriate to their \nsecuritisation positions. For this purpose, various factors which may be considered \ninclude, but are not limited to, rise in default rates in the underlying portfolios in a \nsituat ion of economic downturn, rise in pre- payment rates due to fall in rate of \ninterest or rise in income levels of the borrowers leading to early redemption of \nexposures, fall in rating of the credit enhancers resulting in fall in market value of \nsecuritisati on notes and drying of liquidity of the securitisation  notes resulting in \nhigher prudent valuation adjustments. Based on the results of stress tests, \nadditional capital shall be held to support any higher risk, if required.  \nC. Credit monitoring and valuation \n69. Lenders shall have Board approved policies detailing valuation of the securitisation \nnotes in which they have invested. The policies should inter alia  describe the \nmodels used for valuation, the assumptions underpinning the models, the policy \nregarding bac k-testing and stress testing the valuation model and its parameters \netc. The Board approved valuation policies and the use of such policies in \nassigning valuation to the investment positions in securitisation notes by lenders \nwill be a part of supervisory review.  \n70. The counterparty for the investor in the securitisation notes would not be the SPE \nbut the underlying assets in respect of which the cash flows are expected from the \nobligors.  The securitisation exposures of lenders will be subject to the requirements  \n29 \n of Paragraphs 8.3 to 8.10 of the circular DBR.No.BP.BC.43/21.01.003/2018- 19 \ndated June 3, 2019 on \u201cLarge Exposures Framework\u201d  (as amended from time to \ntime).  \n71. Lenders need to monitor on an ongoing basis and in a timely manner, performance \ninformation on the exposures underlying their securitisation positions and take \nappropriate action, if any, required. Action may include modification to exposure \nceilings to certain ty pe of asset class underlying securitisation, modification to \nceilings applicable to originators etc.  \n72. For this purpose, lenders should establish formal procedures appropriate to their \nbanking book and trading book and commensurate with the risk profile of t heir \nexposures in securitised positions as stipulated in Clauses 65 to 67. Where \nrelevant, this shall include the exposure type, the percentage of loans more than \n30, 60 and 90 days past due, default rates, prepayment rates, loans in foreclosure, \ncollateral type and occupancy and frequency distribution of credit scores or other \nmeasures of credit worthiness across underlying exposures, industry and \ngeographical diversification, frequency distribution of loan to value ratios with \nbandwidths that facilitate adequate sensitivity analysis. Lenders  may inter alia \nmake use of the disclosures made by the originators in the form given in Annex 2  \nto monitor the securitisation exposures.  \nChapter V I: Capital requirement s for securitisation exposures  \nA. General Conditions \n73. Lenders must maintain capital against all securitisation exposure amounts , \nincluding those arising from the provision of credit risk mitigants to a securitisation \ntransaction, investments in asset -backed or mortgage- backed securities, retention \nof a subordinated tranche, and extension of a liquidity facility or credit \nenhancement.  For the purpose of capital computation, whenever securitisation \nexposures are a subject of repurchase agreements and repurchased by a lender, \nthe exposure must be treated as retained exposure and not a fresh exposure.  \nLenders must deduct from Common Equity Tier 1 or net owned funds any increase \nin equity capital resulting from a securitisation transaction, either realised at the \ntime of sale of underlying assets to the SPE, or unrealised gains on sale of  \n30 \n underlying assets such as that associated with expected future margin income, \nwhere recognised upfront, till the maturity of such assets.   \n74. For the purpose of calculating exposure amount, a lender shall measure the \nexposure amount of its off -balance exposure as follows:  \na. for credit risk mitigants sold or purchased by banks (including small finance \nbanks) , the treatment set out in Paragraph 7 of the \u201cMaster Circular \u2013  Basel \nIII Capital Regulations\u201d dated July 1, 2015 (as amended from time to time)  \nwill apply;  \nb. for credit protections, including off -balance sheet exposures, sold or \npurchased by NBFCs, the treatments set out in the relevant Master \nDirections  (as amended from time to time)  will apply;  \nc. for facilities that are not eligible credit risk mitigants, use a credit conversion \nfactor (CCF) of 100% ; and \nd. for derivatives contracts other than credit risk derivatives contracts, such as \ninterest rate or currency swaps sold or purchased by the lenders , to the \nextent not covered by sub- clauses (a) to (c) above, the measurement \napproach set out in the circular dated November 10, 2016 on \u201cGuidelines \nfor computing exposure for counterparty credit risk arising from derivative \ntransactions\u201d will apply . \n75. For the purposes of calculating capital requirements, a lender \u2019s exposure A \noverlaps another exposure B if in all circumstances the lender  will preclude any \nloss for the lender  on exposure B by fulfilling its obligations with respect to exposure \nA. For exa mple, if a lender  provides full credit support to some securitisation notes \nand holds a portion of these securitisation notes, its full credit support obligation \nprecludes any loss from its exposure to the securitisation notes. If a lender  can \nverify that fulfilling its obligations with respect to exposure A will preclude a loss \nfrom its exposure to B under any circumstance, the lender  does not need to \ncalculate risk -weighted assets for its exposure B.  \n76. To arrive at an overlap, a lender may, for the purposes of calculating capital \nrequirements, split or expand its exposures, i.e., splitting exposures into portions \nthat overlap with another exposure held by the lender and other portions that do  \n31 \n not overlap; and expanding exposures by assuming for capital purposes that \nobligations with respect to one of the overlapping exposures are larger than those \nestablished contractually. For example, a liquidity facility may not be contractually \nrequired to cover defaulted assets in certain circumstances. For capital purposes, \nsuch a situation would not be regarded as an overlap to the securitisation notes \nissued by that securitisation. However, the lender may calculate risk -weighted \nassets for the liquidity facility as  if it were expanded (either in order to cover \ndefaulted assets or in terms of trigger events) to preclude all losses on the \nsecuritisation notes. In such a case, the lender would only need to calculate capital \nrequirements on the liquidity facility.  \n77. Overl ap could also be recognised between relevant capital charges for exposures \nin the trading book and capital charges for exposures in the banking book, provided \nthat the lender  is able to calculate and compare the capital charges for the relevant \nexposures.  \n78. Liquidity facilities provided by lenders that satisfy the requirements of Section D of \nChapter IV of these directions  shall attract risk weights as per the SEC -ERBA \napproach prescribed in Section H of this Chapter . \n79. Liquidity facilities provided by lenders that do not satisfy the requirements of \nSection D of Chapter IV of these directions shall maintain capital charge equal to \nthe actual exposure, after applying a credit conversion factor of 100% for the \nundrawn portion.  \n80. All securitisation exposures, which are not cove red by these directions, or which \ndo not satisfy the conditions prescribed in these directions  (including the exposures \nprohibited as per C lause 6), or where originator is  not a lender referred to in C lause \n3, or for which prudential treatment is not advised explicitly in these directions, \nlenders shall keep capital charge equal to the actual exposure and will be subjected \nto supervisory scrutiny and suitable action.  \nB. Derecognition of transferred assets for the purpose of capital adequacy \n81. An originator has to maintain capital against the exposures transferred to a SPE, \nwhich then forms the underlying for securitisation notes issued by the SPE, i.e., the \nexposures transferred to a special purpose entity must be included in the  \n32 \n calculation of  risk-weighted assets of the originator  and the consideration received \nfrom SPE must be recognised as an advance, unless atleast the following \nconditions are satisfied:  \na. The originator does not maintain direct or indirect control over the \ntransferred exposures.  For this purpose, t he originator is deemed to have \nmaintained effective control over the transferred credit risk exposures if it: \n(i) is able to repurchase from the SPE the previously transferred exposures \nin order to realise their benefits; or (ii) i s obligated, contractually or \notherwise,  to retain the risk of the transferred exposures.  \nExplanation : For the purpose of this sub- clause, retention of servicing \nrights in respect of the transferred exposures would not constitute control \nby the originator over the transferred exposures.  \nb. The originator should not be able to repurchase the transferred exposures \nunless it is done through invocation of a clean- up call option.  \nProvided that  the purchase on invocation of clean- up calls is conducted \nat arm's lengt h, on market terms and conditions (including price/fee) and \nis subject to the originator's normal credit approval and review \nprocesses;  \nc. The transferred exposures are legally isolated from the originator in such a \nway that the exposures are put beyond the r each of the originator or its \ncreditors, even in bankruptcy  (specially IBC)  or administration.   \nd. The securitisation notes issued by the SPE are not obligations of the \noriginator.  Thus, the investors who purchase the securitisation notes have \na claim only to the underlying exposures.  \ne. The holders of the securitisation  notes issued by the SPE against the \ntransferred exposures have the right to pledge or trade them without any \nrestriction, unless the restriction is imposed by a statutory or regulatory risk \nretention requirement.   \n33 \n f. The exercise of the clean- up calls, if any, should not be mandatory on the \noriginator, in form or substance and must be at the discretion of the \noriginator . \ng. The clean- up call options, if any, should not be structured to avoid allocating \nlosses to credit enhancements or positions held by investors or otherwise \nstructured to provide credit enhancements.  \nProvided that  if a clean -up call, when exercised, is found to serve as a \ncredit enhancement  (for example, to purchase delinquent  underlying \nexposures) , the exercise of the clean- up call should be considered a \nform of implicit support provided by the originator.  \nh. The threshold at which clean- up calls become exerci sable shall not be more \nthan 10% of the original value of the underlying exposures  or securitisation \nnotes . \ni. The securitisation does not contain clauses that require the originator to \nreplace or replenish the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality \nof the pool in the event of deterioration in the underlying credit quality , \nexcept under conditions specifically permitted in these Directions . \nj. If the originator provides credit enhancement or first loss facility, the \nsecuritisation structure shall not allow for increase in the above positions \nafter inception.  \nk. The securiti sation does not contain clauses that increase the yield payable \nto parties other than the originator such as investors and third-party  \nproviders of credit enhancements, in response to a deterioration in the credit \nquality of the underlying pool.  \nExplanation  1: This restriction stipulates that deterioration in the credit \nquality of the underlying pool should be covered through invocation of \nfirst loss or second loss facilities, if available, and the protection available \ndue to the seniority of the securitisation exposures , and not by increase \nin payments to the investors .  \n34 \n Explanation 2:  This restriction shall not apply to increase in yields to \ninvestors on account of movements in reference rates to which the \nunderlying loans may be benchmarked.  \nl. There must be no termination options or triggers to the securitisation \nexposures except eligible clean- up call options or termination provisions for \nspecific changes in tax and regulation (regulatory or tax call options)  or early \namortisation provisions.  \nProvided that  early amortisation provisions do not subordinate the \noriginator\u2019s senior or pari passu interest in the underlying to the interest \nof other investors, nor subordinate the originator\u2019s subordinated interest \nto an even greater degree relative to the interest of other parties, nor in \nother ways increase the exposure of the originator to the losses \nassociated with the underlying exposures shall be treated as in violation \nof the provisions of this clause.  \n82. The originator should obtain legal opinion t hat the transfer of exposures to a special \npurpose entity satisfies the above conditions if the exposures are to be excluded \nfrom the calculation of risk weighted assets.  \nC. Approaches for computation of risk weighted assets \n83. Lenders shall apply  Securitisation  External Ratings Based approach (SEC -ERBA)  \nfor calculation of risk weighted assets for credit risk of securitisation exposures.  For \nunrated securitisation exposures , lender shall maintain capital charge equal to the \nactual exposure.    \n84. The capital charges computed based on the prescribed risk weights are subject to \na cap of the actual exposure in respect of which capital adequacy is being \ncomputed such that the capital requirement for any securiti sation position does not \nexceed the securiti sation exposure amount .  \n85. However, the originator may apply a maximum capital requirement for the \nsecuritisation exposures it holds , upto the permissible aggregate threshold, equal \nto the capital requirement that would have been assessed against the entire \nunderlying loan exposures had they not been securitised.    \n35 \n 86. When a lender  provides implicit support to a securitisation, it must, at a minimum, \nhold capital against all of the underlying exposures associated with the \nsecuritisation transaction as if they had not been securitised. Additionally, lenders  \nwould not be permitted to recognise in regulatory capital any gain on sale.  \nD. Determination of attachment point  (A) and detachment point  (D) \n87. The attachment point (A) represents the threshold at which losses within the \nunderlying pool would first be allocated to the relevant securitisation exposure. The \nattachment point (A) shall be expressed as a decimal value between zero and one \nand shall be equal to the greater of zero and the ratio of the outstanding balance \nof the pool of underlying exposures in the securitisation minus the outstanding \nbalance of all tranches that rank senior or pari passu to the tranche containing the \nrelevant securitisati on position including the exposure itself to the outstanding \nbalance of all the underlying exposures in the securitisation.  \n88. The detachment point (D) represents the threshold at which losses within the \nunderlying pool result in a total loss of principal for  the tranche in which a relevant \nsecuritisation exposure resides. The detachment point (D) shall be expressed as a \ndecimal value between zero and one and shall be equal to the greater of zero and \nthe ratio of the outstanding balance of the pool of underlyi ng exposures in the \nsecuritisation minus the outstanding balance of all tranches that rank senior to the \ntranche containing the relevant securitisation position to the outstanding balance \nof all the underlying exposures in the securitisation.  \n89. For the calculation of A and D, over -collateralisation and funded reserve accounts \nmust be recognised as tranches; and the assets forming these reserve accounts \nmust be recognised as underlying assets. Only the loss -absorbing part of the \nfunded reserve accounts that pr ovide credit enhancement can be recognised as \ntranches and underlying assets.  \n90. Unfunded reserve accounts, such as those to be funded from future receipts from \nthe underlying exposures (eg unrealised excess spread) and assets that do not \nprovide credit enhancement related to these instruments must not be included in \nthe above calculation of A and D.   \n36 \n 91. Lenders should take into consideration the economic substance of the transaction  \nrather than the form  and apply these definitions conservatively in the light  of the \nstructure.  \nE. Determination of tranche maturity  \n92. For risk based capital purposes, tranche maturity ( \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47) can be measured at the \nlender \u2019s discretion in either of the following manners:  \na. As the rupee weighted -average maturity of the contractual cash flows of the \ntranche, as expressed below, where \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 denotes the cash flows (principal, \ninterest payments and fees) contractually payable by the borrower in period \nt. The contractual payments  must be unconditional and must not be \ndependent on the actual performance of the securitised assets. If such \nunconditional contractual payment dates are not available, the final legal \nmaturity shall be used.  \n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47= \u2211\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\n\u2211\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \nb. On the basis of final legal maturity of the tranche, where \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f is the final legal \nmaturity of the tranche.  (MT and M L are in years ) \n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47=1+0.8(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\u22121) \n93. In all cases, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 will have a floor of one year and a cap of five years.  The cap of five \nyears is only for the capital computation purposes and  is not applicable for the \nactual permissible maturity for tranches.  \n94. When determining the maturity of a securitisation exposure, lenders should take \ninto account the maximum period of t ime they are exposed to potential losses from \nthe securitised assets. In cases where a lender provides a commitment, the lender \nshould calculate the maturity of the securitisation exposure resulting from this \ncommitment as the sum of the contractual maturi ty of the commitment and the \nlongest maturity of the asset(s) to which the lender would be exposed after a draw \nhas occurred.  \n95. For credit protection instruments that are only exposed to losses that occur up to \nthe maturity of that instrument, a lender  would  be allowed to apply the contractual  \n37 \n maturity of the instrument and would not have to look through to the protected \nposition.  \nF. Treatment by banks (including small finance banks) of credit risk \nmitigation for securitisation exposures  \n96. Banks  may recognise credit protection purchased on a securitisation exposure \nwhen calculating capital requirements subject to the following:  \na. collateral recognition is limited to that permitted under Paragraph 7.3.5 of \nthe \u201cMaster Circular \u2013  Basel III Capital Regulations\u201d dated July 1, 2015 (as \namended from time to time) . Eligible Collateral pledged by SPEs may be \nrecognised;  \nb. credit protection provided by the entities listed in Paragraph 7.5.6 of the \n\u201cMaster Circular \u2013  Basel III Capital Regulations\u201d dated July 1, 2015 (as \namended from time to time)  may be recognised. SPEs cannot be recognised \nas eligible guarantors; and \nc. where guarantees fulfil the minimum operational conditions as specified in \nParagraph 7.5 of the \u201cMaster Circular \u2013  Basel III Capital Regulations \u201d dated \nJuly 1, 2015 (as amended from time to time) , lender s can take account of \nsuch credit protection in calculating capital requirements for securitisation \nexposures.  \n97. When a bank provides full (or pro rata) credit protection to a securitisation \nexposure, it must calculate its capital requirements as if it directly holds the portion \nof the securitisation exposure on which it has provided credit protection (in \naccordance with the definition of tranche maturity).  \n98. Provided that the conditions set out in C lause 96 are met, the bank buying full (or \npro rata) credit protection may recognise the credit risk mitigation on the \nsecuritisation exposure in accordance with the CRM framework.  \n99. Under all approaches, a lower -priority sub- tranche must be treated as a non- senior \nsecuritisation exposure even if the original securitisation exposure prior to \nprotection qualifies as senior tranche as defined in sub- clause ( v) of Clause 5.  \n38 \n 100. A maturity mismatch exists when the residual maturity of a hedge is less than \nthat of the underlying exposure. When protection is bought on a securitisation \nexposure(s), for the purpose of setting regulatory capital against a maturity \nmismatch, the capital  requirement will be determined in accordance with Paragraph \n7.6 of the \u201cMaster Circular \u2013  Basel III Capital Regulations\u201d dated July 1, 2015 (as \namended from time to time) . When the exposures being hedged have different \nmaturities, the longest maturity must be used.  \nG. Securitisation \u2013 External Ratings Based Approach (SEC -ERBA)  \n101. For securitisation exposures that are externally rated, risk -weighted assets \nunder the securitisation external ratings -based approach (SEC -ERBA) will be \ndetermined by multiplying securitisation exposure amounts by the appropriate risk \nweights as  determined by C lauses 102 to 104 provided that the following \noperational criteria are met : \na. To be eligible for risk -weighting purposes, the external credit assessment \nmust take into account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure \nthe lender  has with regard to all payments owed to it. For example, if a lender  \nis owed both principal and interest, the assessment must fully take into \naccount and reflect the credit risk associated with timely repayment of both \nprincipal and interest;  \nb. The external credit assessments must be from an eligible external credit \nrating agency  (CRA)  as provided i n Paragraph 6 of the \u201cMaster Circular \u2013  \nBasel III Capital Regulations\u201d dated July 1, 2015 (as amended from time to \ntime).  A rating must be published in a publicly accessible form and included \nin the CRA \u2019s transition matrix. Also, loss and cash flow analysis as well as \nsensitivity of ratings to changes in the underlying rating assumptions should \nbe publicly available. Consequently, ratings that are made available onl y to \nthe parties to a transaction do not satisfy this requirement.  Further, the \nexternal credit assessment provided by the eligible CRAs should not be \nmore than six months old.  \nc. Eligible CRAs must have a demonstrated expertise in assessing \nsecuritisations, which may be evidenced by strong market acceptance.   \n39 \n d. Furthermore, a bank cannot use the credit assessments issued by one \nexternal credit rating agency for one or more tranches and those of another \nexternal credit rating agency for other positions (whether r etained or \npurchased) within the same securitisation structure that may or may not be \nrated by the first external credit rating agency. Where two or more eligible \nCRAs can be used and these assess the credit risk of the same \nsecuritisation exposure differently, Paragraph 6.7 of the \u201cMaster Circular \u2013  \nBasel III Capital Regulations\u201d dated July 1, 2015 will apply.  \ne. Where credit risk mitigation (CRM) is provided to specific underlying \nexposures or the entire pool by an eligible guarantor as defined in Paragraph \n7.5.6 of the \u201cMaster C ircular \u2013 Basel III Capital Regulations\u201d dated July 1, \n2015 and is reflected in the external credit assessment assigned to a \nsecuritisation exposure(s), the risk weight associated with that external \ncredit assessment should be used. In order to avoid any double -counting, \nno additional capital recognition is permitted. If the CRM provider is not \nrecognised as an eligible guarantor, the covered securitisation exposures \nshould be treated as unrated.  \nf. In the situation where a credit risk mitigant solely protects  a specific \nsecuritisation exposure within a given structure (eg asset -backed security \ntranche) and this protection is reflected in the external credit assessment, \nthe lender  must treat the exposure as if it is unrated and then apply the CRM \ntreatment outl ined in Paragraph 7 of the \u201cMaster Circular \u2013  Basel III Capital \nRegulations\u201d dated July 1, 2015 (as amended from time to time) . \ng. A lender is not permitted to use any exter nal credit assessment for risk -\nweighting purposes where the assessment is at least partly based on \nunfunded support provided by the lender . For example, if a lender  buys \nasset -backed securities (ABS) where it provides an unfunded securitisation \nexposure (eg liquidity facility or credit enhancement), and that exposure \nplays a role in determining the credit assessment on the ABS, the lender  \nmust treat the ABS as if it were not rated. The lender  must continue to hold \ncapital against the other securitisation exposures it provides (eg against the \nliquidity facility and/or credit enhancement).   \n40 \n 102. For exposures with short -term ratings, the following risk weights will apply:  \nERBA risk weights for short -term ratings  \nExternal credit \nassessment  A1+/A1  A2 A3 All other \nratings  \nRisk weight  15% 50% 100%  1250%  \n \n103. For exposures with long- term ratings, the risk weights depend on:  \na. the external rating grade;  \nb. the seniority of the position;  \nc. the tranche maturity; and \nd. in the case of non- senior tranches, the tranche thickness.  \n104. Specifically, for exposures with long- term ratings, risk weights will be \ndetermined according to the following table and will be adjusted for tranche maturity \nand tranche thickness for non- senior  tranches  as prescribed in Clause 105 of these \ndirections . \nERBA risk weights for long -term ratings  \nRating Senior tranche  Non-senior (thin) tranche  \nTranche maturity ( \ud835\udc74\ud835\udc74\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc7b) Tranche maturity ( \ud835\udc74\ud835\udc74\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc7b) \n1 year  5 years  1 year 5 years  \nAAA 15% 20% 15% 70% \nAA+ 15% 30% 15% 90% \nAA 25% 40% 30% 120% \nAA- 30% 45% 40% 140% \nA+ 40% 50% 60% 160% \nA 50% 65% 80% 180% \nA- 60% 70% 120% 210% \nBBB+  75% 90% 170% 260% \nBBB 90% 105% 220% 310% \nBBB- 120% 140% 330% 420% \nBB+ 140% 160% 470% 580%  \n41 \n BB 160% 180% 620% 760% \nBB- 200% 225% 750% 860% \nB+ 250% 280% 900% 950% \nB 310% 340% 1050 % 1050 % \nB- 380% 420% 1130 % 1130 % \nCCC+/CCC/CCC - 460% 505% 1250 % 1250 % \nBelow CCC - 1250 % 1250 % 1250 % 1250 % \n \n105. The risk weight assigned to a securitisation exposure when applying the SEC -\nERBA is calculated as follows5: \na.

To account for tranche thickness, lender s shall calculate the risk weight for \nnon-senior tranches as follows:  \n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45  \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 =(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61  \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53  \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f  \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a)\n\u2217(1\u2212min (\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47,50% )) \nwhere T is the tranche thickness.  \n106. In the case of market risk hedges such as currency or interest rate swaps, the \nrisk weight will be inferred from a securitisation exposure that is pari passu to the \nswaps or, if such an exposure does not exist, from the next subordinated tranche.  \n107. The resul ting risk weight is subject to a floor risk weight of 15%. In addition, the \nresulting risk weight should never be lower than the risk weight corresponding to a \nsenior tranche of the same securitisation with the same rating and maturity.   \nAlternative capital treatment for term Short, Transparent and Comparable (STC)  \nsecuritisations  \n \n \n                                                 \n5 An illustrative example for ca lculation of risk weights is given in Annex 4.   \n42 \n 108.

Wherever a third -party servicing agent service have been availed, the originator \nshall ensure robust and legally binding information sharing mechanisms are in \nplace to comply with stipulated reporting requirements with requisite frequency and \nrigor. In suc h cases of obtaining data from third- party entities, originator must get \ninformation duly certified by the respective third- party auditors, preferably at a \nfrequency of no more than a year.  \nA. Disclosures to be made in Servicer/Investor/Trustee Report  \n112. The ori ginator (s) should disclose to investors the weighted average holding \nperiod of the assets securitised and the level of thei r MRR in the securitisation.  \n113. The originator(s) should ensure that prospective investors have readily \navailable access to all material ly relevant data on the credit quality and \nperformance of the individual underlying exposures, cash flows and collateral \nsupporting a securitisation exposure as well as such information that is necessary \nto conduct comprehensive and well -informed stress te sts on the cash flows and \ncollateral values supporting the underlying exposures.  \n114. The disclosure by an originator of its fulfilment  of the MHP and MRR should be \nmade available publicly and should be appropriately documented; for instance, a \nreference to the retention commitment in the prospectus for securitisation notes \nissued under that securitisation programme would be considered appropriate. The \ndisclosure should be made at origination of the transaction,  and should be \nconfirmed thereafter at a minimum half yearly (end- September and March), and at \nany point where the requirement is breached. The above periodical disclosures \nshould be made separately for each securitisation transaction, throughout its life, \nin the servicer report, investor report, trustee report, or any similar document \npublished.  \n115. The aforesaid disclosures can be made in the format given in Annex 2.  These \ndisclosures should be made separately for each securitisation transaction \nthroughout the life of the transaction.   \n44 \n B. Disclosures to be made in Notes to Accounts  \n116. The Notes to Annual Accounts of the originators  should indicate the outstanding \namount of securitised assets as per books of the SPE s and total amount of \nexposures retained by the originator  as on the date of balance sheet to comply with \nthe MRR. These figures should be based on the infor mation duly certified by the \nSPE\u2019s auditors obtained by the originator  from the SPE.  \n117. These disclosures should be made in the format given in Annex 3.  \nC. Reporting of Transactions to the Reserve Bank  \n118. The originator must also submit the details  of the securitisation transactions  \nundertaken, including the details of the securitisation notes issued, to the Reserve \nBank on a quarterly basis. The format for the same shall be communicated \nseparately  and shall be effective from the date advised therein.  \nChapter VI: Repeal of circulars  \n119.

Paragraph 4.4.5, 5.16 of \nDBR.No.BP.BC.1/21.06.201/\n2015- 16 01.07.2015  Master Circular \u2013 Basel III \nCapital Regulations  \n  \n45 \n Annex 1  \nSimple, transparent and comparable securitisation \u2013  criteria for regulatory \ncapital purposes  \nAll the following criteria must be satisfied in order for a securitisation to receive the \nalternative regulatory capital treatment as determined by C lauses 108 to 110.  \nNature of Assets  \n1. The assets underlying the securitisation should be homogeneous credit claims \nor receivables eligible under Part A of Chapter II. Credit claims or receivables should have contractually identified periodic payment streams relating to principal, interest, or principal and interest payments. Any referenced interest \npayments or discount rates should be based on an external benchmark.  \n2. For this purpose, the \u201chomogeneity\u201d criterion should be assessed taking into account the following principles:  \na. The nature of assets should be such that investors would not need to \nanalyse and assess materially different legal and/or credit risk factors and \nrisk profiles when carrying out risk analysis and due diligence checks of \neach asset.  \nb. Homogeneity should be assessed on the basis of common risk drivers, \nincluding similar risk factors and risk profiles.  \nc. Credit claims or receivables included in the securitisation should have \nstandard obligations, in terms of rights to payments and/or income from \nassets and that result in a peri odic and well -defined stream of payments to \ninvestors.  \nd. Repayment of noteholders should mainly rely on the principal and interest \nproceeds from the securitised assets. Partial reliance on refinancing or re -\nsale of the asset securing the exposure may occur provided that re -\nfinancing is sufficiently distributed within the pool and the residual values \non which the transaction relies are sufficiently low and that the reliance on \nrefinancing is thus not substantial.  \n \n  \n46 \n Asset performance history  \n3. In order to provide investors with sufficient information on an asset class to \nconduct appropriate due diligence and access to a sufficiently rich data set to \nenable a more accurate calculation of expected loss in different stress scenarios, \nverifiable loss performance data,  such as delinquency and default data, should \nbe available for credit claims and receivables with substantially similar risk \ncharacteristics to those being securitised, for a time period long enough to permit meaningful evaluation by investors.  \n4. Sources of and access to data and the basis for claiming similarity to credit claims \nor receivables being securitised should be clearly disclosed to all market \nparticipants.  \n5. The originator of the securitisation or the original lender of the exposures that are securit ised, as the case may be, must have sufficient experience in originating \nexposures similar to those securitised. For capital purposes, investors must determine whether the performance history of the originator for substantially similar claims or receivable s to those being securitised has been established for \nan \"appropriately long period of time\u201d. This performance history must be no \nshorter than a period of seven years for non- retail exposures. For retail \nexposures, the minimum performance history is five y ears.  \nPayment status \n6. Credit claims or receivables being transferred to the SPE may not, at the time of inclusion in the pool, include obligations that are in default or delinquent or obligations for which the originator, servicer and other parties with a f iduciary \nresponsibility to the securitisation note holders are aware of evidence indicating a material increase in expected losses or of enforcement actions.  \n7. To ensure that the quality of the securitised credit claims and receivables is not affected by changes in underwriting standards, the originator should demonstrate to investors that any credit claims or receivables being transferred to the SPE have been originated in the ordinary course of the originator\u2019s business to materially non- deteriorating under writing standards.  \n8. The originator should verify that the underlying credit claims or receivables meet the following conditions:   \n47 \n a. the credit claims or receivables is not under the monitoring period as \ndefined in defined in the Prudential Framework on Resolution of Stressed \nAssets dated June 7, 2019;  \nb. the obligor does not have a credit assessment by a credit rating agency or a credit score indicati ng a significant risk of default; and \nc. the credit claim or receivable is not subject to a dispute between the obligor and the originator.  \n9. The assessment of these conditions should be carried out by the originator no earlier than 45 days prior to the date on which the securitisation comes into effect. \nAdditionally, at the time of this assessment, there should, to the best knowledge of the originator, be no evidence indicating likely deterioration in the performance status of the credit claim or receivable.  \nConsistency of underwriting  \n10. Underwriting standards should not be less stringent than those applied to credit claims and receivables retained on the balance sheet.  In all circumstances, all \ncredit claims or receivables must be originated in accordance with sound and prudent underwriting criteria based on an assessment that the obligor has the \u201cability and volition to make timely payments\u201d on its obligations.  \n11. The originator of the securitisation is expected, where underlying credit claims or receivables have been acquired from third parties, to review the underwriting standards (ie to check their existence and assess their quality) of these third parties and to ascertain that they have assessed the obligors\u2019 \u201cability and volition to make timely payments on obligations\u201d.  \nAsset selection and transfer  \n12. While assets transferred to a securitisation will be subject to defined criteria as approved by the Board of the originator, the performance of the securitisation should not rely upon the ongoing selection of assets through active management on a discretionary basis of the securitisation\u2019s underlying portfolio.  \nExplanation : As long as they are not actively selected or otherwise \ncherry -picked on a discretionary basis, the addition of credit claims or \nreceivables during t he replenishment periods or their substitution or  \n48 \n repurchasing due to the breach of representations and warranties do not \nrepresent active portfolio management.  \n13. Credit claims or receivables transferred to a securitisation should satisfy clearly defined eli gibility criteria. Credit claims or receivables transferred to a \nsecuritisation after the date on which securitisation becomes effective may not be actively selected, actively managed or otherwise cherrypicked on a discretionary basis.  \n14. The securitisation s hould be such that the underlying credit claims or receivables:  \na) are enforceable against the obligor and their enforceability is included in the representations and warranties of the originator;  \nb) are beyond the reach of the seller, its creditors or liquidators and are not subject to material recharacterisation or clawback risks;  \nc) are not effected through credit default swaps, derivatives or guarantees, but by a transfer of the credit claims or the receivables to the securitisation;  \nd) demonstrate effecti ve recourse to the ultimate obligation for the underlying \ncredit claims or receivables and are not a securitisation of other securitisations; and \ne) for regulatory capital purposes, an independent third- party legal opinion \nmust support the claim that the transfer of assets under the applicable laws comply with the above sub- clauses.  \n15. The originator should provide representations and warranties that the credit claims or receivables being transferred to the SPE are not subject to any condition or encumbrance that  can be foreseen to adversely affect enforceability \nin respect of collections due.  \n16. To assist investors in conducting appropriate due diligence prior to investing in a new offering, sufficient loan- level data in accordance with applicable laws or, in \nthe case of granular pools, summary stratification data on the relevant risk \ncharacteristics of the underlying pool should be available to potential investors before pricing of a securitisation.  \nInitial and ongoing data \n17. To assist investors in conducting appropriate and ongoing monitoring of their investments\u2019 performance and so that investors that wish to purchase a securitisation in the secondary market have sufficient information to conduct  \n49 \n appropriate due diligence, timely loan- level data in accordance with applicable \nlaws or granular pool stratification data on the risk characteristics of the \nunderlying pool and standardised investor reports should be readily available to current and potential investors at least quarterly throughout the life of the securitis ation. Cut -off dates of the loan- level or granular pool stratification data \nshould be aligned with those used for investor reporting.  \n18. To provide a level of assurance that the reporting of the underlying credit claims or receivables is accurate and that the underlying credit claims or receivables \nmeet the eligibility requirements, the initial portfolio should be reviewed for conformity with the eligibility requirements by an appropriate legally accountable and independent third party.  \nExplanation : The review  should confirm that the credit claims or \nreceivables transferred to the SPE meet the portfolio eligibility requirements. The review could, for example, be undertaken on a representative sample of the initial portfolio, with the application of a minimum co nfidence level. The verification report need not be provided \nbut its results, including any material exceptions, should be disclosed in \nthe initial offering documentation.  \nRedemption cash flows  \n19. To help ensure that the underlying credit claims or receivables do not need to be \nrefinanced over a short period of time, there should not be a reliance on the sale or refinancing of the underlying credit claims or receivables in order to repay the liabilities of the SPE, unless the underlying pool of credit claims o r receivables is \nsufficiently granular and has sufficiently distributed repayment profiles. Rights to receive income from the assets specified to support redemption payments should be considered as eligible credit claims or receivables in this regard \nCurre ncy and interest rate asset and liability mismatches  \n20. To reduce the payment risk arising from the different interest rate and currency \nprofiles of assets and liabilities and to improve investors\u2019 ability to model cash flows, interest rate and foreign currency risks should be appropriately mitigated \nat all times, and if any hedging transaction is executed the transaction should be \ndocumented according to industry -standard master agreements. Only  \n50 \n derivatives used for genuine hedging of asset and liability mism atches of interest \nrate and / or currency should be allowed.  \na. For capital purposes, the term \u201cappropriately mitigated\u201d should be \nunderstood as not necessarily requiring a completely perfect hedge. The appropriateness of the mitigation of interest rate and f oreign currency \nthrough the life of the transaction must be demonstrated by making available to potential investors, in a timely and regular manner, quantitative information including the fraction of notional amounts that are hedged, as well as sensitivity  analysis that illustrates the effectiveness of the hedge \nunder extreme but plausible scenarios.  \nb. If hedges are not performed through derivatives, then those risk -mitigating \nmeasures are only permitted if they are specifically created and used for the purpose of hedging an individual and specific risk, and not multiple risks at the same time (such as credit and interest rate risks). Non- derivative risk \nmitigation measures must be fully funded and available at all times.  \nPayment priorities and observability  \n21. Investor reports should contain information that allows investors to monitor the \nevolution over time of the indicators that are subject to triggers. Any triggers breached between payment dates should be disclosed to investors on a timely basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of all underlying transaction \ndocuments.  \n22. Following the occurrence of a performance- related trigger, an event of default or \nan acceleration event, the securitisation positions should be repaid in accordance with a sequential amortisation priority of payments, in order of tranche seniority, and there should not be provisions requiring immediate liquidation of the underlying assets at market value.  \n23. To assist investors in their ability to appropriately model the cash flow waterfal l \nof the securitisation, the originator should make available to investors, both before pricing of the securitisation and on an ongoing basis, a liability cash flow model or information on the cash flow provisions allowing appropriate modelling of the secu ritisation cash flow waterfall.  \n24. To ensure that debt forgiveness, loan moratoriums, payment holidays, restructurings and other asset performance remedies can be clearly identified,  \n51 \n policies and procedures, definitions, remedies and actions relating to \ndelinquency, default or restructuring of underlying debtors should be provided in clear and consistent terms, such that investors can clearly identify debt forgiveness, loan moratoriums, payment holidays, restructuring and other asset performance remedies on an ongoing basis.  \nVoting and enforcement rights \n25. To help ensure clarity for note holders of their rights and ability to control and \nenforce on the underlying credit claims or receivables, upon insolvency of the \noriginator, all voting and enforcement rights related to the credit claims or \nreceivables should be transferred to the SPE. Investors\u2019 rights in the \nsecuritisation should be clearly defined in all circumstances, including the rights \nof senior versus junior note holders.  \nDocumentation disclosure and legal review  \n26. To help investors to fully understand the terms, conditions, legal and commercial \ninformation prior to investing in a new offering and to ensure that this information \nis set out in a clear and effective manner for all programmes and offerings, sufficient initial offering and draft underlying documentation should be made available to investors (and readily available to potential investors on a continuous basis) within a reasonably sufficient period of time prior to pricing, or when legally permiss ible, such that the investor is provided with full disclosure of the legal and \ncommercial information and comprehensive risk factors needed to make informed investment decisions.  \nExplanation : For the purpose of this clause, initial offering documentation \nwould typically mean draft offering circular, draft offering memorandum, draft offering document or draft prospectus, such as a \u201cred herring\u201d whereas draft underlying documentation would typi cally mean asset sale \nagreement, assignment, novation or transfer agreement; servicing, backup servicing, administration and cash management agreements; trust/management deed, security deed, agency agreement, account bank agreement, guaranteed investment c ontract, incorporated terms or master \ntrust framework or master definitions agreement as applicable; any relevant inter -creditor agreements, swap or derivative documentation,  \n52 \n subordinated loan agreements, start -up loan agreements and liquidity \nfacility agr eements; and any other relevant underlying documentation, \nincluding legal opinions.  \n27. Final offering documents should be available from the closing date and all final \nunderlying transaction documents shortly thereafter. These should be composed such that readers can readily find, understand and use relevant information.  \nFiduciary and contractual responsibilities \n28. To ensure that all the documentation of securitisation transactions has been subject to appropriate review prior to publication, the terms and documentation of the securitisation should be reviewed by an appropriately experienced third \nparty legal practice, such as a legal counsel already instructed by one of the \ntransaction parties. Investors should be notified in a timely fashion of any \nchanges in such documents that have an impact on the structural risks in the securitisation.  \n29. To help ensure servicers have extensive workout expertise, thorough legal and \ncollateral knowledge and a proven track record in loss mitigation, such parties should be able to demonstrate expertise in the servicing of the underlying credit claims or receivables, supported by a management team with extensive industry experience. The servicer should at all times act in accordance with reasonable and prudent standards.  \n30. Policies, pr ocedures and risk management controls should be well documented \nand adhere to good market practices and relevant regulatory regimes. There should be strong systems and reporting capabilities in place. In assessing whether \u201cstrong systems and reporting capabilities are in place\u201d for capital purposes, well documented policies, procedures and risk management controls, as well as strong systems and reporting capabilities, may be substantiated by a third-party review.  \n31. The party or parties with fiduciary responsi bility should act on a timely basis in \nthe best interests of the securitisation note holders, and both the initial offering and all underlying documentation should contain provisions facilitating the timely resolution of conflicts between different classes  of note holders by the trustees, \nto the extent permitted by applicable law.   \n53 \n 32. The party or parties with fiduciary responsibility to the securitisation and to \ninvestors should be able to demonstrate sufficient skills and resources to comply with their duties  of care in the administration of the SPE.  \n33. To increase the likelihood that those identified as having a fiduciary responsibility towards investors as well as the servicer execute their duties in full on a timely basis, remuneration should be such that thes e parties are incentivised and able \nto meet their responsibilities in full and on a timely basis.  \nTransparency to investors \n34. To help provide full transparency to investors, assist investors in the conduct of their due diligence and to prevent investors being subject to unexpected disruptions in cash flow collections and servicing, the contractual obligations, duties and responsibilities of all key parties to the securitisation, both those with a fiduciary responsibility and of the ancillary service providers , should be defined \nclearly both in the initial offering and all underlying documentation.  \nExplanation : For the purpose of this clause, \u201cinitial offering\u201d and \n\u201cunderlying transaction documentation\u201d shall have the same meaning as \nin the explanation to the C lause 26 of this Annex.  \n35. Provisions should be documented for the replacement of servicers, bank account providers, derivatives counterparties and liquidity providers in the event of failure or non- performance or insolvency or other deterioration of creditworthiness of \nany such counterparty to the securitisation.  \n36. To enhance transparency and visibility over all receipts, payments and ledger entries at all times, the performance reports to investors should distinguish and report the securitisation\u2019s income and disbursements, such as scheduled principal, redemption principal, scheduled interest, prepaid principal, past due interest and fees and charges, delinquent, defaulted and restructured amounts under debt forgiveness and payment holidays, including accurate accounting for amounts attributable to principal and interest deficiency ledgers.  \n \n \n  \n54 \n Credit risk of underlying exposures \n37. At the portfolio cut -off date6 the underlying exposures have to meet the \nconditions under the Standardised Approach for credit risk, and after taking into \naccount any eligible credit risk mitigation, for being assigned a risk weight equal to or smaller than:  \na. 40% on a value- weighted average exposure basis for the portfolio where \nthe exposures are loans secured by residential mortgages or fully guaranteed residential loans;  \nb. 50% on an individual exposure basis where the exposure is a loan secured by a commercial mortgage;  \nc. 75% on an individual exposure basis where the exposure is a retail exposure; or  \nd. 100% on an individual exposure basis for any other exposure.  \nGranularity of the pool  \n38. At the portfolio cut -off date, the aggregated value of all exposures to a single \nobligor shall not exceed 1%  of the aggregated outstanding exposure value of all \nexposures in the portfolio.  \nProvided that  the applicable maximum concentration threshold could be \nincreased to 2% if the originator retains subordinated tranche(s) that form credit enhancements that are loss absorbing, and which cover at least the first 10% of losses. These tranche(s) retained by the originator shall not be eligible for the STC capital treatment.  \n        \n                                                 \n6 Date post which no credit claim or

RESTRICTIONS ON HOLDING SHARES IN OTHER CO -OPERATIVE  \nSOCIETIES \n \n1.1 Section 19 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co -operative \nSocieties) (BR Act, 1949 (AACS)) stipulates that no co- operative bank shall hold shares \nin any other co -operative society except to such extent and subject to such conditions as \nthe Reserve Bank of India (Reserve Bank) may specify in that behalf. However, nothing \ncontained in the section applies to - \n \n1.1.1  shares acquired through funds provided by the State Government for that purpose;  \n1.1.2  in the case of a central co- operative bank, the holding of shares in the state \nco-operative bank to which it is affiliated;  and \n1.1.3  in the case of a primary (urban) co- operative bank (UCB), holding of shares \nin the central co- operati ve bank to which it is affiliated or in the state co-\noperative bank of the state in which it is  registered.  \n \n1.2 In pursuance of the powers conferred by S ection 19 read with S ection 56 of the \nsaid Act, the Reserve Bank has specified that the extent and conditions subject to which \nco-operative banks may hold shares in any other co- operative society shall be as follows:  \n1.2.1 The total investments of a co -operative bank in the shares of co - operative \ninstitutions, other than those falling under any of the categories stated at paragraphs 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 above, shall not exceed 2 per cent of its owned funds (paid -up share capital and reserves).  \n1.2.2 The investment of a bank in the shares of any one co -operative institution \ncoming under paragraph 1.2.1 above s hall not exceed 5 per cent of the \nsubscribed capital of that  institution.  \nNote : When more than one co- operative bank contributes to the shares in a co- operative \nsociety falling under paragraph 1.2.1, the limit of 5 per cent of the subscribed capital indica ted above shall apply not in respect of the investment of each of the banks but in \nrespect of the investment of all the banks taken together. In other words, the total \ninvestment of all the co- operative banks should be limited to 5 per cent of the subscribed \ncapital of the enterprise concerned.  \nA co-operative bank should offer to make its contribution to the shares of a co- operative \nsociety coming under paragraph 1.2.1 above only if the bye- laws of the recipient society \nprovide for the retirement of share c apital contributed by it.  4   \n1.2.3 The retirement of the share capital contributed by a bank to the shares of \nany society coming under paragraph 1.2.1 above should be completed in 10 equal annual installments commencing from the co -operative year \nimmediately  following the year in which the concern commences business \nor production.  \n1.2.4 A co-operative bank should not, except with the permission of the Reserve \nBank, contribute to the share capital of a society coming under category \nreferred to in paragraph 1.2.1 above, if it is situated outside its area of  \noperation.  \n1.2.5 The above restrictions will not apply to holdings by co- operative banks of \nshares in non- profit making co- operative societies such as those formed for \nthe protection of mutual interests, (e.g. , co- operative banks' association) or \nfor the promotion of co- operative education etc. , (e.g.,  state co- operative \nunion), or housing co-  operatives for the purpose of acquiring premises on \nownership basis,  etc. \n \n2 STATUTORY (SLR)  INVESTMENTS  \n \n2.1 Maintenance of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) for  UCBs  \nBanks shall refer to the Master Direction- Reserve Bank of India [Cash Reserve Ratio  \n(CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)] Directions, 2021 on the maintenance of SLR.  \n \n3 INVESTMENT  POLICY \n \n3.1 Keeping i n view the various regulatory/statutory  guidelines  and the bank's own \ninternal requirements, UCBs should lay down, with the approval of their Board of \nDirectors, the broad Investment Policy and objectives to be achieved while undertaking investment transac tions. The Investment Policy  should be reviewed each year. The \nBoard/Committee/Top Management should actively oversee investment transactions. Banks should not undertake any transactions on behalf of Portfolio Management Scheme (PMS) clients in their fiduc iary capacity, and on behalf of other clients, either as \ncustodians of their investments or purely as their  agents.  \n3.2 The bank\u2019s I nvestment Policy should clearly indicate the authority to put through \ninvestment deals , the procedure to be followed for obtaini ng sanction of the appropriate \nauthority  for putting through deals, fixing various prudential exposure limits, and reporting  \nsystem.  \n 5  3.3 The Investment Policy of the bank should include guidelines on the quantity (ceiling) \nand quality of each type of security  to be held on its own investment account.  It should \nbe prepared strictly observing the instructions issued by the Registrar of Co -operative \nSocieties (Central Registrar of Co- operative Societies, where applicable) and the \nReserve Bank from time to time and clearly spell out the internal control mechanism, \naccounting standards, audit, review and reporting system to be evolved.  \n3.4 All the transactions should be clearly recorded indicating full details. The Top \nManagement should undertake a periodic review of investment transactions in a critical manner and put up details of large transactions to the Board, for  information.  \n3.5 A copy of  the internal I nvestment Policy guidelines framed by the bank with the \napproval of its Board should be forwarded to the concerned Regional Office of \nDepartment of Supervision, Reserve Bank, certifying that the policy is in accordance with the prescribed guidelines and the same has been put in place. Subsequent changes, if any, in the Investment Policy should also be advised to the Regional Office of the Reserve Bank.  \n3.6   For investment in non- SLR instruments , banks should review their Investment Policy  \nand ensure that it provides for the nature and extent of investments intended to be made,  \nthe risk parameters,  and cut -loss limits for holding / divesting the investments. The banks \nshould put in place proper risk management systems for capturing and analyzi ng the risk \nin respect of n on-SLR investments and taking remedial measures in time.  Banks should \nalso be guided by instructions given in paragraph 12 of this Master Circular.  \n \n4 GENERAL  GUIDELINES  \n4.1 UCBs should not undertake any purchase/sale transactions with broking firms or \nother intermediaries on principal -to-principal  basis.  \n4.2 Banks should not  hold an oversold position in any security  except for those banks \nwhich are eligible to undertake short sale position in Government securities as prescribed in paragraph 10 of this Master Circular.  However, scheduled UCBs may sell a \nGovernment Security already contracted for purchase, provided:  \n4.2.1  the purchase contract  is confirmed prior to the sale,  \n4.2.2  the purchase contract is guaranteed by Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL ) or the security is contracted for purchase from the Reserve Bank  \nand, \n4.2.3  the sale transaction will settle either in the same settlement cycle as the preceding purchase contract, or in a subsequent settlement cycle so that the delivery obligation under the sale contract is met by the securities 6  acquired under the purchase contract (e.g. when a security is purchased on \nT+0 basis, it can be sold on either T+0 or T+1 basis on the day of the purchase; if however it is purchased on T+1 basis, it can be sold on T+1 \nbasis on the day of purchase or on T+0 or T+1 basis  on the next day).  Sale \nof Government  Securities  allotted to successful bidders in primary issues \non the day of allotment, with and between CSGL constituent account holders is permitted.  \n4.3 For purchase of securities from the Reserve Bank through Open Market Operations \n(OMO), no sale transactions should be contracted prior to receiving the confirmation of the deal/advice of allotment from  the Reserve Bank.  \n4.4 Banks should exercise abundant caution to ensure adherence to these guidelines. \nThe concurrent auditors should specifically verify the compliance with these instructions. The concurrent audit reports should contain specific observations on the compliance with the above instructions and should be incorporated in the monthly report to the Chairman/ Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the bank and the half yearly \nreview to be placed before the Board of Directors. CCIL will make avail able to all market \nparticipants as part of its daily reports, the time stamp of all transactions as received from NDS- OM. The mid office/back office and the auditors may use this information to \nsupplement their checks/scrutiny of transactions for complianc e with the instructions. Any \nviolation noticed in this regard should immediately be reported to the concerned Regional \nOffice of Department of Supervision, Reserve Bank of India. Any violation noticed in this regard would attract penalties as currently applicable to the bouncing of SGL even if the deal has been settled because of the netting benefit under DVP III, besides attracting further regulatory action as deemed necessary.  \n4.5  Banks successful in the auction of primary issue of Government Securities, may  \nenter into contracts for sale of the allotted securities in accordance with the terms and conditions as indicated below:  \n4.5.1  The contract for sale can be entered into only once by the allottee bank, on the basis of an authenticated allotment advice issued by Reserve Bank. The selling bank should make suitable noting/stamping on the allotment advice indicating the sale contract number etc., the details of which should be intimated to the buying entity. Any sale of securities should be only on a T+0 or T+1 settl ement  basis.  \n4.5.2  The contract for sale of allotted securities can be entered into by banks only with entities maintaining SGL Account with Reserve Bank for delivery and settlement on the next working day through the DVP  system.  \n 7  4.5.3  The face value of securities sold should not exceed the face value of \nsecurities indicated in the allotment  advice.  \n4.5.4  The sale deal should be entered into directly without the involvement of  \nbroker/s.  \n4.5.5  Separate record of such sale deals should be maintained containing details such as number and date of allotment advice, description and the face value of securities allotted, the purchase consideration, the number, date of delivery and face value of securities sold, sale consideration, the date and details of actual delivery etc. This record should be made available to Reserve Bank for verification. Banks should immediately report any cases of failure to maintain such records.  \n4.5.6  Such type of sale transactions of Government Securities allotted in the auctions for primary issues on the same day and based on authenticated allotment advice should be subjected to concurrent audit and the relative audit report should be placed before the Board of Directors of the bank once every month. A copy thereof should also be sent to the concerned Regional \nOffice of Department of Supervision, RBI . \n4.5.7  Banks will be solely responsible for any failure of the contracts due to the securities not being credited to their SGL account on account of non-payment  etc. \n4.6 While undertaking OTC transactions in Government securit ies, b anks should seek \na scheduled commercial bank, a Primary Dealer ( PD), a financial institution, another \nUCB, insurance company, mutual fund or provident fund, as a counterparty for their \ntransactions. Preference should be given to  direct deals with suc h counter parties. It will \nbe desirable to check prices from other banks or PDs with whom the UCB may be maintaining Gilt account. The prices of all trades done in Government Securities, \nincluding those traded through NDS -OM, are also available at Reserve Bank\u2019s website \n(www.rbi.org.in\n). \n4.7 Scheduled UCBs may undertake retailing of Government Securities with non- bank \nclients, such as provident funds, non- banking financial companies, high net worth \nindividuals etc. subject to the following conditions:  \n4.7.1  Banks may freely buy and sell Government Securities on an outright basis at the prevailing market prices without any restriction on the period between \nsale and purchase.  \n4.7.2  Retailing of Government Securities should be on the basis of ongoing \nmarket rates/yield curve emerging out of secondary market transactions.  8  4.7.3  Immediately on sale, the corresponding amount should be deducted by the \nbank from its investment accounts  and also from its SLR assets.  \n4.7.4  These transactions should be looked into by the concurrent/ statutory auditors of the bank.  \n4.7.5  Banks should put in place adequate internal control checks/ mechanisms \nas advised by the Reserve Bank from time to time.  \n4.8 Banks may take advantage of the non- competitive bidding facility in the auction of \nGovernment of India dated securities, provided by the Reserve Bank. Under this scheme, \nbanks may bid upto \u20b9 2 crore (face value) in any auction of Government of India dated \nsecurities, either directly, through a bank or through a PD. For availing this facility, no bidding skill is required, as allotment upto \u20b9 2 crore (face value) is made at the weighted \naverage cut -off rate which emerges in the auction. UCBs may also participate directly or \nthrough a bank or a PD in the competitive and non- competitive auctions of S tate \nDevelopment Loans  (SDLs)  conducted by the Reserve Bank. Participation in non-\ncompetitive auction of S DLs will be as per guidelines prescribed in the Scheme of Non-\nCompetitiv e Bidding in the Auction of S DLs issued vide \ncircular \nIDMD.No. 954/08.03.001/2009- 10 dated August 24,  2009 , as amended from time to time. \nAn advertisement in leading newspapers is issued 4- 5 days in advance of the date of \nauction. Half yearly auction calendar of Government of India securities is also issued by the Reserve Bank.  \n4.9 Gilt Accounts , if opened,  should be used for holding the securities and such \naccounts should be maintained in the same bank with whom the cash account is maintained.  \n4.10 In case Gilt account is opened with any of the eligible non-banking institutions, the \nparticulars of the designated funds account (with a bank) should be intimated to that  \ninstitution.  \n4.11 All transactions must be monitored to see that delivery takes place on settlement \nday. The fund account and investment account should be reconciled on the same day before close of  business.  \n4.12 Officials deciding about purchase and sale transactions should be separated from \nthose responsible for settlement and accounting.  \n4.13 All investment transactions should be perused by the Board at least once a month.  \n4.14 When the bank has been specifically permitted to tender physical SGL transfer \nforms , it should keep a proper record of the SGL forms received / issued to facilitate \ncounter -checking by their internal control systems/Inspecting Officers of Reserve \nBank/other  auditors.  \n 9  4.15 All purchase/sale trans actions in Government Securities by the banks should \nnecessarily be through SGL/CSGL  account (with Reserve Bank) or Gilt  account (with a \nscheduled commercial bank/ State co-operative bank/PD/SHCIL)  or in a dematerialised \naccount with depositories (NSDL/CDSL).  \n4.16 No transactions in Government Securities by a UCB should be undertaken in \nphysical form with any  broker.  \n4.17 The entities maintaining the CSGL/designated funds accounts are required to \nensure availability of clear funds in the designated funds accounts for purchases and of \nsufficient securities in the CSGL account for sale transactions.  \n4.18 The security dealings of banks generally being for large values, it may be necessary \nto ensure, before concluding the deal, the ability of the counterparty to fulfill the contract, particularly where the counterparty  is not a bank.  \n4.19 While buying securities for SLR purpose, the bank should ensure that the security it \nintends to purchase has an SLR status. The SLR status of securities issued by the Government of India and the State Governments will be indicated in the Press Release issued by the Reserve Bank at the time of issuance of the securities. An updated and current list of the SLR securities will be posted on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website (https://dbie.rbi.org.in) under the link \u201cDatabase on Indian Economy -Statistics -Financial \nMarket -Government Securities Market .\u201d \n4.20 In order to avoid concentration of risk, the banks should have a fairly diversified \ninvestment portfolio. Smaller investment portfolios should preferably be restricted to securities with high safety and liquidity such as Government  Securities.  \n4.21 UCBs may seek the guidance of Primary Dealers\u2019 Association of India (PDAI)/Fixed \nIncome and Money Market Dealers' Association (FIMMDA) on investment in Government  \nSecurities.  \nNegotiated Dealing System \u2013  Order Matching \n \n4.22 All lice nsed UCBs fulfilling the eligibility criteria contained in circular \nIDMD.DOD.No.13/10.25.66/2011 -12 dated November 18, 2011  as amended from time to \ntime, are allowed direct  access to Negotiated Dealing System \u2013  Order Matching platform. \nThe eligibility criteria are as under:  \n(a) Current account with RBI or a funds account with one of the Designated Settlement Banks (DSBs) chosen by Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) for  funds  settlement.  \n(b) Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) Account with RBI. \n(c) Membership of Negotiated Dealing System  (NDS).  \n(d) Indian Financial Network (INFINET)  connectivity.  10  (e) Membership of  CCIL.  \n(f) Minimum Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of  9 per cent . \n(g) Net Non-Performing Assets (NPA) of less than 5 per cent . \n(h) Minimum net worth of \u20b925 crore.  \n4.23 All eligible UCBs desirous of obtaining NDS- OM membership are required to apply \nto concerned Regional O ffice of the Department of Supervision, RBI, for regulatory \nclearance before applying to Financial Markets Regulation Department (FMR D), RBI for \nNDS- OM membership.  \n4.24 Eligible UCBs applying for NDS- OM membership need to have the required \ninfrastructure in place for direct access to NDS -OM and also bear the cost involved in \nsetting up the infrastructure. A fter opening a SGL account with the RBI (which is one of \nthe several requirements to be fulfilled by a UCB for obtaining NDS -OM membership), \nthe UCB concerned cannot open / maintain a gilt account with a CSGL account holder. \nHowever, such UCBs can continue to bid for Government securities under the scheme of non-competitive bidding in Government  securities.  \n \n5 TRANSACTIONS THROUGH SGL  ACCOUNTS  \n \n5.1 SGL Account  \n5.1.1  Transfers through SGL accounts by UCBs  having SGL facility can be made \nonly if they maintain a regular current account with the Reserve Bank. All transactions in Government Securities for which SGL facility is available, should be put through SGL accounts  only.  \n5.1.2  Banks should report / conclude t heir transactions on NDS / NDS -OM and \nclear / settle them through CCIL as central counterparty . In such cases \nwhere exceptions have been specifically permitted to tender physical SGL \ntransfer forms, the guidelines regarding SGL transfer forms should also be \nfollowed.  \n5.1.3  Before issue of SGL transfer forms covering the sale transactions, banks should ensure that they have sufficient balance in the respective SGL accounts. Under no circumstances, an SGL transfer form issued by a bank in favour of another bank  should  bounce for want of sufficient balance in the \nSGL account. The purchasing bank should issue the cheques  (or make \npayment by any other eligible mode)  only after receipt of the SGL transfer \nforms from the selling  bank.  \n \n 11  5.1.4  In the event of bouncing of SGL tr ansfer forms and the failure of the account \nholder concerned to offer satisfactory explanation for such bouncing, the \nUCB shall be liable to pay penalties as under:  \ni.

In the next financial year, upon being satisfied \nthat the UCB in question has made improvements in its internal control \nsystems, RBI may grant specific approval for undertaking short sales by \nusing the SGL A/c facility.  \niii. The monetary penalty may be paid by the UCB concerned by way of a \ncheque or through electronic mode for the amount favouring the Reserve \nBank of India, within five working days of receipt of intimation of order \nimposing penalty from RBI.  \n5.1.5  For the purpose of instructions  given in paragraph 5.1.3, \u2018SGL bouncing\u2019 \nshall mean failure of settlement of a Government securities transaction on \naccount of insufficiency of funds in the curr ent account of the buyer or \ninsufficiency of securities in the SGL / CSGL account of the seller, \nmaintained with the Reserve Bank of India.  \n5.1.6 The defaulting UCB shall make appropriate disclosure, on the number of \ninstances of default as well as the quantum of penalty paid to the Reserve \nBank during the financial year, under the \u201cNotes to Account\u201d in its balance \nsheet.  12  5.1.7 Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraphs  5.1.3 to 5.1.5, the \nReserve Bank reserves the right to take any action including t emporary or \npermanent debarment of the SGL account holder, in accordance with the \npowers conferred under the G overnment Securities  Act, 2006 as it may \ndeem fit, for violation of the terms and conditions of the opening and \nmaintenance of SGL/ CSGL accounts or breach of the operational \nguidelines issued from time to time.  \n5.1.8 In addition to the above, as NDS Members, UCBs should strictly abide by \nall other provisions of the NDS (Membership) Regulations, 2002 as \namended from time to time.  \n \n5.2 SGL Forms \n5.2.1  The SGL transfer forms should be in the standard format prescribed by the \nReserve Bank and printed on semi -security paper of uniform size. These \nshould be serially numbered and there should be a control system in place to account for each SGL form.  \n5.2.2  SGL transfer forms should be signed by two authorised officials of the bank \nwhose signatures should be recorded with the respective PDO of Reserve Bank and other  banks.  \n5.2.3  The SGL transfer form received by the purchasing bank should be deposited in its SGL account immediately. No sale should be affected by \nway of return of SGL transfer form held by the bank.  \n5.2.4  Any bouncing of SGL transfer forms issued by selling bank in favour of the buying bank should immediately be brought to the notice of the Reserve Bank by the buying bank.  \n5.3 Control, Violation and Penalty  Provi sions  \n5.3.1  Record of SGL transfer forms issued/received should be maintained. Balances as per the bank\u2019s books in respect of SGL accounts should be reconciled with the balances in the books of PDOs. The PDO concerned will forward a monthly statement of balances  of SGL/CSGL account to all \naccount holders. UCBs having SGL/CSGL accounts with PDOs may use these statements for the purpose of monthly reconciliation of their \nSGL/CSGL balances as per their books and the position in this regard \nshould be placed before the Audit Committee of the Board. This reconciliation should also be periodically checked by the internal audit department. A system for verification of the authenticity of the SGL transfer 13  forms received from other banks and confirmation of authorised signatories \nshould be put in place.  \n5.3.2  Banks should also forward a quarterly certificate to the PDO concerned, indicating that the balances held in the SGL accounts with the PDO have been reconciled and that it has been placed before the Audit Committee of the Board. A copy thereof should be sent to the concerned Regional Office \nconcerned of the Department of Supervision, RBI . \n5.3.3  Banks should put in place a system to report to the Top Management on a monthly basis the details of transactions in securities, details of SGL bouncing and review of investment transactions undertaken during the  \nperiod.  \n5.3.4  All promissory notes, debentures, shares, bonds, etc. , held in physical form,  \nshould be properly recorded and held under joint custody.

These should be subjected to periodical verification, say once \nin a quarter or half -year, by persons unconnected with their  custody.  \n5.3.5   Certificates should be obtained at quarterly/half -yearly intervals in respect \nof securities lodged with other institutions. Similarly, it is necessary to reconcile the SGL Account balance with the PDO at monthly  intervals.  \n5.3.6   The internal inspectors and concurrent auditors should peruse the transactions to ensure that the deals have been undertaken in the best interest of the bank. The Vigilance Cell should also make surprise sample checks of large transactions.  \n5.3.7  The concurrent auditors should certify that investments held by the bank, as on the last reporting Friday of each quarter and as reported to Reserve Bank, are actually owned/held by it. Such a certificate should be submitted to the concerned Regional Office of Department of Supervision RBI, within \n30 days from the end of the relative quarter.  \n \n6 ENGAGEMENT OF  BROKERS  \n6.1 Dealing through Brokers  \n6.1.1   The inter -bank securities transactions should be undertaken directly \nbetween banks and no bank should engage the services of any broker in such transactions. Banks may, however, undertake securities transactions among thems elves or with non- bank clients through members of  National \nStock Exchange (NSE)  / BSE wherein the transactions are transparent. In 14  case any transactions in securities are not undertaken on NSE /BSE, the \nsame should be undertaken by the banks directly without the use of  brokers.  \n6.1.2  Purchase of permissible shares and PSU bonds in the secondary market \n(other than inter -bank transactions) should be only through recognised \nstock exchanges and registered stock - brokers.  \n6.1.3  The SBI DFHI has been permitted to operate as a broker in the inter - bank \nparticipation market. This would enable the banks to seek intermediation of \nSBI DFHI for borrowing/lending, if required. However, the banks shall be \nfree to settle transaction in the inter -bank participations market directly, if so  \ndesired.  \n6.1.4  If a deal is put through with the help of a broker, the role of the broker should be restricted to that of bringing the two parties to the deal together. Under no circumstances banks should give power of attorney or any other authorisation to t he brokers/ intermediaries to deal on their behalf in the \nmoney and securities  markets.  \n6.1.5  Disclosure of counter party should be insisted upon on conclusion of the deal put through brokers.  \n6.1.6  Contract confirmation from the counter party should be insisted upon.  \n6.1.7  The brokers should not be involved in the settlement process at all i.e. , both \nthe fund settlement and delivery of security should be done with the counterparty  directly.  \n \n6.2 Empanelment of  Brokers  \n6.2.1  The bank should prepare a panel of brokers with the approval  of their Board \nof Directors. \n6.2.2  Brokers should be empaneled after verifying their credentials e.g.:  \n(a) SEBI  registration \n(b) Membership of BSE/NSE for debt  market.  \n(c) Market turnover in the preceding year as certified by the Exchange/s.  \n(d) Market reputation etc. \n6.2.3  The bank  should check websites of SEBI/respective exchanges, to ensure \nthat the broker has not been put in the banned list. \n \n 15  6.3 Broker  Limits  \n6.3.1  A disproportionate part of the business should not be transacted through \nonly one or a few brokers. Banks should fix aggregate contract limits for each of the approved brokers and ensure that these limits are not exceeded. A record of broker -wise details of deals put through and brokerage paid \nshould be maintained.  \n6.3.2  A limit of 5  per cent  of total transactions (both purchases and sales) entered \ninto by the banks during a year should be treated as the aggregate upper contract limit for each of the approved brokers.  \n6.3.3  This limit should cover both the business initiated by the bank and the business offered/brought to the bank by a broker.  \n6.3.4  It should be ensured that the transactions entered through individual brokers during a year normally do not exceed the prescribed limit. However, if it becomes necessary to exceed the aggregate limit for any br oker, the \nspecific reasons, therefore, should be recorded in writing by the authority empowered to put through the deals. In such cases, post - facto approval of \nthe Board may be obtained after explaining the circumstances under which the limit was  exceeded . \nNote: C larifications on certain issues  raised by the banks in this regard are furnished in \nAnnex I. \n \n7 SETTLEMENT OF GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS \u2013  THROUGH \nCLEARING CORPORATION OF INDIA LTD.  (CCIL)  \n7.1 All Government Securities transactions (both Outright and Repo) are being settled \nthrough CCIL only.  \n7.2 UCBs, which are not a member of NDS -CCIL system, should undertake their \ntransactions in Government Securities through gilt account/demat account maintained with a NDS  member.  \n7.3 All outright secondary market t ransactions in Government Securities will be settled \non T+1 basis. However, in case of repo transactions in Government Securities, the market participants will have the choice of settling the first leg on either T+0 basis or T+1 basis as per their  requirem ent. \n \n \n  16  8 TRADING OF GOVERNMENT SECURITIES ON STOCK EXCHANGES  \n8.1 The facility of trading of Government Securities on the stock exchanges, in the \ndematerialized mode only, is available to banks in addition to the present NDS -OM of the \nReserve Bank, w hich will continue to remain in place.  \n8.2 The UCBs have the option to undertake transactions in dated Government of India \nsecurities in dematerialised form on automated order driven system of NSE  and BSE in \naddition to the existing mode of dealing through SGL/CSGL  acco unts with Reserve Bank \nor gilt accounts with the designated entities such as Scheduled Commercial \nBank/PD/State Co -operative Bank  etc. \n8.3 As the trading facility on the above stock exchanges will operate parallel to the \npresent system of trading in Government  Securities, the trades concluded on the \nexchanges will be cleared by their respective clearing corporations/Clearing Houses. \nHowever, trading members of the stock exchanges shall not be involved in the settlement process for any regulated entity of Reserv e Bank. All stock exchange trades of banks \nhave to be settled either directly with CCIL/Clearing House (in case they are clearing \nmembers) or else through a clearing member  custodian.\n \n8.4 With a view to facilitating participation on the stock exchanges within the regulations \nprescribed by Reserve Bank, SEBI and the exchanges, banks are being extended the \nfollowing facilities:  \n8.4.1  Opening demat accounts with a bank depository participant (DP) of NSDL/CDSL or with SHCIL in addition to their SGL/CSGL accounts with Reserve Bank/authorised entities.  \n8.4.2  Value free transfer of securities between SGL/CSGL and demat accounts is being enabled at PDO, Mumbai, subject to operational guidelines issued separately by Internal Debt Management Department  to all SGL account  \nholders.  \n8.5 The balances in Government Securities maintained by the banks in the depositories \nwill be included for SLR purpose. Any shortfall in maintenance of CRR/SLR resulting from settlement failure (on either the NDS -CCIL market or the stock exchanges) will attract t he \nusual penalties.  \n8.6 The Boards of UCBs may take a conscious decision in regard to using the stock \nexchange platform for making investments in Government Securities in addition to the existing NDS- CCIL market and the direct bidding facility. As regulations of SEBI wil l also \napply insofar as trading of Government Securities is concerned, the Board should frame \nand implement a suitable policy to ensure that operations are conducted in accordance with the norms laid down by Reserve Bank/SEBI and the respective stock exchange. Prior to commencing operations, the dealing officials should also familiarize themselves with the basic operating procedures of the stock  exchanges.  17  8.7 Operational  Guidelines \n8.7.1  Banks should put in place appropriate internal control systems cater ing to \nstock exchange trading and settlement before commencing operations on \nthe exchanges. The back -office arrangement should be such that trading on \nthe NDS- OM/OTC market and on the stock exchanges can be tracked easily \nfor settlement, reconciliation and management reporting. Banks should, \ntherefore, install enabling IT infrastructure and adequate risk management systems.  \n8.7.2   Only SEBI registered brokers who are authorized by the permitted \nexchanges (NSE /BSE) to undertake transactions in Government Securitie s \ncan be used for placing buy/sell orders. A valid contract note indicating the time of execution must be obtained from the broker at end of  day. \n8.7.3  The dealing officials should independently check prices in the market or on the stock exchange screens before placing their orders with the brokers. The decision- making processes cannot be delegated to brokers by the  banks.  \n8.7.4  The transactions done through any broker will be subjected to the current guidelines on transactions done through brokers.  \n8.7.5  Brokers/trading mem bers shall not be involved in the settlement process; all \ntrades have to be settled through clearing member custodians. Hence, it will be necessary for UCBs to enter into a bilateral clearing agreement with such service providers beforehand.  \n8.7.6  All transactio ns must be monitored with a view to ensuring timely receipt of \nfunds and securities. Any delay or failure should be promptly taken up with the exchange/authorities  concerned.  \n8.7.7  At the time of trade, securities must be available with the banks either in their SGL or in the demat account with depositories.  \n8.7.8  Any settlement failure on account of non- delivery of securities/non-  \navailability of clear funds will be treated as SGL bouncing and the current penalties in respect of SGL bouncing will be applicable. The st ock \nexchanges will report such failures to the respective PDOs.  \n8.7.9  For the limited purpose of dealing through the screen- based trading system \nof the stock exchanges the condition that a UCB should seek a scheduled commercial bank, a PD, a financial institution, another UCB, insurance \ncompany, mutual fund or provident fund as a counterparty, while \nundertaking transactions in Government Securities, will not  apply.  \n 18  8.7.10   Banks should report on weekly basis to their Audit Committee of the Board, \ngiving the details of trades on aggregate basis done on the stock exchanges \nand details of any \u2018closed- out\u2019 transactions on the exchanges.  \n8.7.11  The banks should take all necessary precautions and strictly adhere to all \ninstructions/guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank rel ating to transactions \nin Government Securities as  hitherto.  \n \n9 REPO/REVERSE REPO TRANSACTIONS \n9.1 UCBs may execute repo transactions subject to adherence to instructions given in \nRepurchase Transactions (Repo) (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2018 issued vide \ncircular FMRD.DIRD.01/14.03.038/2018- 19 dated July 24, 2018 . \n9.2  However, only Scheduled UCBs  with strong financials and sound risk management \npractices are eligible to undertake repo transactions in corporate debt securities. \nAccordingly, scheduled UCBs , fulfilling the following conditions only would be \npermitted to undertake such transactions.  \n(a) CRAR of 10  per cent  or more and gross NPA of less than 5 per cent  and \ncontinuous rec ord of profits during the previous three years.  \n(b) Sound risk management practices and mandatory concurrent audit of the Investment  portfolio.  \n9.3 Further, the Repo transactions in corporate bonds shall be undertaken only with scheduled commercial banks / PDs and not with other market participants. UCBs \nwhich are lenders of funds in a repo transaction may provide for Counter -party credit \nrisk corresponding to the risk weight for such exposure as applicable to the loan / investment exposure. UCBs  may also ensure that securities acquired under repo \nalong with other n on-SLR investment already in the Balance Sheet should be within \nthe stipulated ceiling of n on-SLR investment (i.e. , 10 per cent  of a bank's total \ndeposits as on March 31 of the previous year). The funds borrowed under repo should be within the limit prescribed for call money borrowing (i.e., 2 per cent  of the \nprevious year's  deposits).  \n9.4 UCBs can undertake repo transactions  only in Government securities held in excess \nof the prescribed SLR requirements.  \n9.5 Repos shall be accounted as per guidelines contained in Annex I II of this Master \nCircular.  \n 19  10. SHORT SELLING IN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES  \n10.1 Well managed UCBs , who are members of NDS- OM and have regular concurrent \naudit of their treasury operations, are permitted to undertake intra- day short selling of \nGovernment Securities. Accordingly, Urban Co- operative Banks, fulfilling the following \nconditions are required to seek permission f rom the Regional Offices concerned to \nundertake such transactions.  \na. NDS- OM Membership.  \nb. Net Worth of  \u20b925 crore, CRAR of 9  per cent  or more and net NPA of not more \nthan 3 per cent . \nc. Sound risk management practices and mandatory concurrent audit of their \nTreasury Operations.  \n10.2 UCBs are advised to adhere to the instructions/directions as prescribed in Short \nSale (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2018 issued vide FMRD.DIRD.05/14.03.007/2018- 19 \ndated July 25, 2018 . \n \n11. \u2018WHEN ISSUED\u2019 TRANSACTIONS IN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES \n11.1 UCBs  shall adhere to the When Issued Transactions (Reserve Bank) Directions, \n2018 issued FMRD.DIRD.03/14.03.007/2018- 19 dated July 24, 2018  for undertaking \n\u201cWhen Issued\u201d  (WI) transactions.  \n11.2 The accounting treatment of transactions undertaken in WI securities  would be as \nfollows:  \n(a) The \u2018WI\u2019 security should be recorded in books as an off - balance sheet item till \nissue of the security.  \n(b) The off - balance sheet net position in \u2018WI\u2019 market should be marked to market \nscrip -wise on a daily basis at the day's closing price of the \u2018WI\u2019 security. In case \nthe price of the \u2018WI\u2019 security is not available, the value of the underlying security \nbe used instead. Depreciation, if any, should be provided for and appreciation, if any, should be ignored.  \n(c) The off -balance sheet (net) position in \u2018WI\u2019 securities, scrip- wise, would attract \na risk weight of  2.5 per cent . \n(d) On delivery, the underlying security may be classi fied in any of the three \ncategories, viz; \u2018Held to Maturity\u2019, \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 or \u2018Held for Trading\u2019, 20  depending upon the intent of holding, at the contracted price.  \n11.3 It is clarified that the securities bought in the \u2018WI\u2019 market would be eligible for SLR  \npurposes, only on delivery.  \n \n12. NON - SLR INVESTMENTS  \n12.1 In order to contain risks arising out of the non- SLR investment portfolio of banks, \nthe banks should adhere to the following guidelines:  \n 12.1.1 Prudential  Limit \nThe Non- SLR investments shall  be limited to 10 per cent  of a bank\u2019s total deposits \nas on March 31 of the previous year.  \n12.1.2 Instruments \nUCBs may invest in the following instruments:  \n(a) \"A\" or equivalent and higher rated Commercial Papers (CPs), debentures and  \nbonds.  \n(b) Units of Debt Mutual Funds and Money Market Mutual  Funds.  \n(c) Shares of Market Infrastructure Companies  (MICs).  \n12.1.3 Restrictions \n(a) Investment in perpetual debt instruments is not  permitted.  \n(b) Investment in unlisted securities shall be subject to a minimum rating \nprescribed at 12 .1.2 (a) above and shall not exceed 10 per  cent of the total \nnon-SLR investments at any time. In terms of  \nUBD.(PCB).BPD.Cir.No.14/16.20.000/2007-08 dated September 18, 2007, where \nbanks have already exceeded the said limit, no further investment in such \nsecurities will be permitted. Since there is a time lag between issuance and \nlisting of securities, which are proposed to be listed but not listed at the time of \nsubscription, banks may not be able to participate in primary issues of n on-\nSLR securities. In view of this, investments in n on-SLR debt securities (both \nprimary and secondary market) by banks where the security is proposed to be listed in the Exchange(s) may be considered as inves tment in listed security at \nthe time of making investment. However, if such security is not listed within the period specified, the same will be reckoned for the 10 per  cent limit specified \nfor unlisted n on-SLR securities. In case such investments included under \nunlisted non-SLR securities lead to a breach of 10 per  cent limit, the bank \nwould not be allowed to make further investments in n on-SLR securities (both \nprimary and secondary market) till such time its investment in unlisted 21  securities comes within the limit of 10 per cent.  \n(c) Investment in deep discount / zero coupon bonds should be subject to the \nminimum rating as stated above and comparable market yields for the residual duration. However, banks are not permitted to invest in Zero Coupon Bonds from F ebruary 18, 2011 as advised vide  \ncircular \nNo.UCB(PCB)BPD.Cir.No.36/16.20.000/2010- 11 dated February 18, 2011  \nunless the issuer builds up a sinking fund for all accrued interest and keeps it invested in liquid investments / securities (Government  bonds).  \n(d) Investment in units of Mutual Funds, other than units of Debt Mutual Funds and Money Market Mutual Funds, are not permitted. The existing holding in \nunits of Mutual Funds other than Debt Mutual Funds and Money Market Mutual Funds, including those in UTI should be disinvested. Till such time that they are held in the books of the bank, they will be reckoned as Non- SLR \ninvestments for the purpose of the limit at 13.1.1 above. The banks should, however, review their existing risk management policy  to  ensure that they do \nnot have disproportionate exposure in any one scheme of a Mutual Fund.  \n(e) Non-SLR investment, other than in units of Debt Mutual Funds and Money \nMarket Mutual Funds , and CPs, shall be in instruments with an original maturity \nof over one year.  \n(f) Investments in shares of All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) are  not \npermitted. In terms of  UBD.(PCB).BPD.Cir.No.14/16.20.000/2007-08 dated \nSeptember 18, 2007 , the existing share holding in these institutions may be \nphased out and till such time they are held in the books of the bank, they will \nbe reckoned as n on-SLR investments for the purpose of the limit at 12 .1.1 \nabove.  \n(g) All fresh investments under n on-SLR category should be classified under Held \nfor Trading (HFT) / Available for Sale (AFS) categories only and mar ked to \nmarket as applicable to these categories of investments. However, investments in the long- term bonds issued by companies engaged in \nexecuting infrastructure projects and having a minimum residual maturity of seven years may be classified under Held to Maturity (HTM) category  \n(h) All non-SLR investments will be subject to the prescribed prudential \nsingle/group counter party exposure limits.  \n(i) All transactions for acquisition / sale of n on-SLR investments in secondary \nmarket may be undertaken with mutual funds, pension / provident funds and \ninsurance companies, in addition to undertaking transactions with commercial \nbanks and primary dealers, subject to adherence to the instructions contained 22  in Para 7 of RBI Master Direction FMRD.DIRD.2/14.01.002/2017- 18 dated \nAugust 10, 2017 . \n(j) UCBs investing in shares of Market Infrastructure Companies (MICs), are \nallowed to exceed the limit for Investments in Non-  SLR / unlisted secu rities \nprescribed in paragraph 12 .1.1 and 12.1.3 (b) above, if it becomes necessary \nto do so for acquiring membership of MICs. The MICs eligible for such Investments by UCBs are Clearing Corporation of India Ltd., National Payments Corporation of India and Society for World Wide Inter -Bank \nFinancial Tele- Communication (SWIFT). The list of eligible MICs will be \nupdated from time to time by the Reserve Bank of  India.  \nNote : For the definitions of certain items such as rated security, investment grade rating, \netc., please see Annex II . \n12.1.4 Review  of non- SLR investment  \nThe Board should review the following aspects of  non-SLR investment at least at \nhalf-yearly intervals:  \n(a) Total business  (investment and divestment) during the reporting period.  \n(b) Compliance with prudential limits prescribed for n on-SLR investment.  \n(c) Compliance with the prudential guidelines issued by Reserve Bank on Non-SLR securities.  \n(d) Rating migration of the issuers/issues held in the bank's books and consequent diminution in the portfolio  quality.  \n(e) Extent of non-performing investments in  the non-SLR category and sufficient \nprovision thereof.  \n12.1.5 Disclosure  \nThe banks shall disclose the details of the issuer -wise composition of n on-SLR \ninvestments and the non- performing investments, as indicated in Annex ure III - \nC.3(d)  of Master Direction on Financial Statements -  Presentation and Disclosures \ndated August 30, 2021 . \n12.2 Bonds/ Debentures received through Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARC)  \n(i) The bonds/ debentures received by the banks as sale consideration towards sale of financial assets to ARCs , will be classified as n on-SLR investments in the books of \nthe banks and accordingly the valuation, classification and other norms applicable \nto non-SLR investments of banks as prescribed by Reserve Bank from time to time, \nwould be applicable to the instruments received by the banks by way of sale consideration from ARC . UCBs are allowed to hold these investments, over and 23  above the limit of 10 per cent  of its deposits as on 31 March of the previous year, \nfor non-SLR securities. UCBs are not permitted to make any direct investment in the \nsecurity receipts, pass -through certificates, or bonds/ debentures issued by ARC. \nUCBs registered under the Multi -State Co -operative Societies Act, 2002 are \npermitted  to invest  in Security  Receipts  issued by ARC  in respect of financial assets \nsold by them to the ARC. However, UCBs must ensure that there is no order issued \nby a Court of competent jurisdiction restricting them from entering into such transactions. A set of guidelines to be followed by Multi -State Co -operative Banks \non sale of Financial Assets to ARC  has been formulated and furnished in the Annex \nIV. The guidelines may be placed before the bank's Board and appropriate steps \ntaken for their  implementation.  \n(ii) When a bank sells its financial assets to ARC, on transfer the same would be removed from the books of the bank.  \n(iii) If the sale to ARC is at a price below the Net Book Value (NBV) (i.e. , book value \nless the provision held), the shortfall should be written off/ debited to Profit & Loss Account of that year, subject to the provisions of co- operative societies  \nacts/rules/administrative guidelines in regard to write- off of debts.  \n(iv) Multi - State Urban Cooperative Banks  are permitted to reverse to P& L account the \nexcess provision when the sale is for a value higher than the NBV on sale of NPAs to their profit and l oss account. However, banks can reverse excess provision \narising out of sale of NPAs only when the cash received (by way of initial consideration and/or redemption of security receipt /pass through certificates) is higher than the NBV of the NPAs sold to ARCs . Further, the quantum of excess \nprovision reversed to profit and loss account will be limited to the extent of which cash exceeds the NBV of the NPAs sold. The quantum of excess provision reversed to the Profit and Loss account on account of sale of N PAs shall be disclosed in the \nfinancial statements of the bank under \u201cNotes to Account\u201d , as provided in Annexure \nIII - C.4(f)(i) of \nMaster Direction on Financial Statements - Presentation and \nDisclosures dated August 30, 2021 . \n \n12.3 Placement of deposits with other banks by  UCBs  \n12.3.1 Prudential inter -bank (gross) exposure limit \nThe total amount of deposits placed by an UCB with other banks (inter -bank) \nfor all purposes including call money/ notice money, and deposits, if any, placed for availing clearing facility, CSGL facility, currency chest facility, remittance facility and non -fund based facilities like Bank Guarantee, Letter \nof Credit, etc. shall not exceed 20 per cent of its total deposit liabilities as 24  on March 31 of the previous year. The balances held in deposit accounts \nwith commercial banks  (including scheduled Small Fi nance Banks) , \nscheduled UCBs , State Cooperative Banks, District Central Cooperative \nBanks  and investments in Certificate of Deposits issued by commercial \nbanks, being interbank  exposures, will be included in this 20 per cent  limit. \nIn cases where the smaller non- scheduled UCBs are keeping current \naccount/minimum required balance for clearing purpose with relatively larger non- scheduled bank for sub- member clearing arrangements, it is \npossible that the financial position of the non-  scheduled UCB with whom \nsuch deposits are kept, could take a hit due to unexpected downturn in its business and which could have an effect on the financial position for the depositing bank and its busi ness. Non- scheduled UCBs, which have \nexposures to other non- scheduled UCBs on account of clearing \narrangements may, therefore, review their exposures to such banks periodically based on their published balance sheet and Profit and Loss Account statements.  \n12.3.2 Prudential inter -bank counter party  limit \nWithin the prudential inter -bank (gross) exposure limit, deposits with any \nsingle bank should not exceed 5 per cent of the depositing bank's total \ndeposit liabilities as on March 31 of the previous year.  \n12.3.3 Scheduled UCBs may accept deposits from other scheduled UCBs, if i t is \npart of an arrangement for providing specific services to the latter bank such as acting as the sponsor bank for clearing purposes, DD arrangement, CSGL facility, currency chest facility, foreign exchange transactions, remittance facility and non- fund based facilities like bank guarantee (BG), \nletter of credit (LC), etc. However, the acceptance of deposits by scheduled UCBs from other scheduled UCBs in the nature of placement of deposits for \ninvestment purposes is not permitted.   \n12.3.4 Only Scheduled UCBs fu lfilling the criteria provided in \ncircular \nDCBR.BPD.(PCB).Cir.No.8/16.20.000/2015 -16 dated November 19, 2015  \nare permitted to accept deposits from scheduled/ non -scheduled UCB s. \nThose scheduled UCBs which fail to meet the criteria shall phase out the deposits as provided in circular  ibid. The total inter -UCB deposits accepted \nby a scheduled UCB satisfying the criteria should not exceed 10 per cent  of \nits total deposit liabilities as on 31st March of the previous financial  year.  \n12.3.5 The interbank exposures arising from deposits placed by UCBs with a UCB under All -inclusive Directions (AID) shall be fully provided within five years 25  at the rate of 20 per cent annually in terms of circular \nDOR.(PCB).BPD.Cir.No.11/16.20.000/2019 -20 dated April 20, 2020 . \nFurther, wherever UCBs are facing difficulty in withdrawal of deposits from \na weak State Cooperative Bank /District Central Cooperative Bank , they \nshall make provision to the extent of 10 per cent  per annum on their \nexposure to such State Cooperative Bank s/District Central Cooperative \nBank s.  The interest receivable on such deposit s shall not be recognised as \nincome by the UCBs.  \n12.3.6 Keeping in view the prescribed prudential limits, UCBs may formulate a policy taking into account their funds position, liquidity and other needs for placement of deposits with other banks, the cost of funds , expected rate of \nreturn and interest margin on such deposits, the counter party risk, etc ., and \nplace it before their Board of Directors. The Board should review the position at least at half yearly  intervals.  \n \n13. INTERNAL CONTROL AND INVESTMENT  ACCOUNTING  \n13.1 Internal  Control  \n13.1.1 For every transaction entered into, a deal slip should be prepared which should contain details relating to name of the counterparty , whether it is \ndirect deal or through a broker, and if through a broker, details of security, amount, pric e, contract date and time. For each deal, there must be a system \nof issue of confirmation to the counterparty.  \n13.1.2 The Deal Slips should be serially numbered and controlled separately to ensure that each deal slip has been properly accounted for. \n13.1.3 On the basis of vouchers passed after verification of actual contract notes received from the broker/ counterparty  and confirmation of the deal by the \ncounterparty the Accounts Section should independently write the books of  \naccounts.  \n13.1.4 A record of broker -wise details of deals put through and brokerage paid \nshould be maintained.  \n13.1.5 The Internal Audit Department should audit the transactions in securities on an ongoing basis and monitor compliance with the laid down management policies and prescribed procedures and report the deficiencies directly to the \nmanagement of the bank.  \n \n 26  13.2 Investment  Accounting \n13.2.1 Accounting Standards \nIn order to bring about uniform accounting practice among banks in booking \nof income on units of mutual funds (debt mutual funds and money market \nmutual fund)  and equity of AIFIs, as a prudent practice, such income should \nbe booked on cash basis and not on accrual basis. However, in respect of \nincome from Government Securities/bonds of public sector undertakings and AIFIs, where interest rates on the instrument s are predetermined, \nincome may be booked on accrual basis, provided interest is serviced regularly and is not in arrears.  \n13.2.2 Broken Period Interest -  Government and Other Approved Securities  \n13.2.2.1 With a view to bringing about uniformity in the accounting treatment \nof broken period interest on Government Securities paid at the time of acquisition, the banks should not capitalise the \nbroken period interest paid to seller as part of cost \nbut treat it as an item of expenditure under Profit & Loss Account.  \n13.2.2.2 It is to be noted that the above accounting treatment does not take \ninto account taxation implications and hence the bank should comply with the \nrequirements of income tax authorities in the manner prescribed by  them.  \n13.2.2.3 Accounting Procedure for investments in Government \nSecurities \u2013 Settlement Date  Accounting \nWith a view to bringing in uniformity in the practice adopted by banks while \naccounting for investments in Government Securities, it has been decided that \nbanks should follow \"Settlement Date\" accounting for recording both outright and \nrepos/reverse repo transactions in Government Securities.  \n \n14. RECOMMENDATIONS OF GHOSH COMMITTEE  \nThe following recommendations made by the Ghosh Committee should be implem ented \nby the banks to prevent frauds and malpractices:  \n14.1 Concurrent Audit  \n14.1.1  In view of the possibility of abuse, treasury functions viz. investments, funds \nmanagement including inter -bank borrowings, bills rediscounting, etc. \nshould be subjected to concurrent  audit and the results of audit should be \nplaced before the Chairman and Managing Director of the bank at \nprescribed intervals.  \n 27  14.1.2 It is the primary responsibility of the banks to ensure that there are adequate \naudit procedures for ensuring proper compliance of the instructions in regard \nto the conduct of investment  portfolio.  \n14.1.3 The concurrent audit should cover the following aspects:  \n(i) Ensure that in respect of purchase and sale of securities the concerned department has acted within its delegated powers.  \n(ii) Ensure that the securities other than those in SGL and in demat form, \nas shown in the books, are physically  held.  \n(iii) Ensure that the Accounting Unit is complying with the guidelines regarding SGL forms, delivery of scrips, documentation and  \naccounting.  \n(iv) Ensure that the sale or purchase transactions are done at rates beneficial to the bank.  \n(v) Scrutinise conformity with broker limits and include excesses observed in their periodical  reports.  \n14.1.4 Banks should formulate internal control guidelines for acquisition of permissibl e shares, debentures and PSU bonds in the secondary market \nduly approved by their  Boards.  \n14.2 Internal  Audit  \nPurchase and sale of Government Securities etc. should be separately subjected to audit by internal auditors . In the absence of internal auditors , audit may be conducted by \nChartered Accountants . The results of their audit should be placed before the Board of \nDirectors once in every quarter.  \n14.3 Review  \nBanks should undertake a half -yearly review (as of March 31 and September 30) of their \ninvestment portfolio, which should, apart from other operational aspects of investment portfolio, clearly indicate and certify adherence to the laid down internal Invest ment Policy  \nand procedures and Reserve Bank\u2019s guidelines and put up the same before the Board within a month. Such review reports should be forwarded to Regional Office of Department of Supervision (erstwhile Urban Banks Department ) by May 15/November 15 r espectively.  \n14.4 Penalties for  Violation  \nBanks should scrupulously follow the above instructions. Any violation of these \ninstructions will invite penal action against defaulting banks which could include raising of \nreserve requirements, withdrawal of refinance from the Reserve Bank, denial of access \nto money markets, denial of new branches/extension counters and advising the President 28  of Clearing House to take appropriate action including suspension of membership of the \nClearing House.  \n15. Categorisation of  Investm ents \n15.1 UCBs are required to classify their entire investment portfolio (including SLR and \nNon-SLR securities) under three categories , viz.: \n(i) Held to Maturity  (HTM)  \n(ii) Available for Sale (AFS)  \n(iii) Held for Trading (HFT)  \nBanks should decide the category of the investm ent at the time of acquisition and the \ndecision should be recorded on the investment proposals. I nvestments in non-SLR \nsecurities , since September 18, 2007,  should be classified under HFT / AFS categories \nonly and marked to market as applicable to these categories of investments. However, \ninvestments in the long- term bonds  issued by companies engaged in executing \ninfrastructure projects and having a minimum residual maturity of seven years may be classified under HTM category.  \n15.2 Held to Maturity  \n15.2.1 Securities acquired by the banks with the intention to hold them up to \nmaturity will be classified under HTM  category.  \n15.2.2 The investments included under HTM category should not exceed 25 per cent of the bank's total investments. However, banks are permitted to exceed the limit of 25 per cent of their total investments under HTM category  \nprovided,  \n(a) the excess comprises only of SLR securities  \n(b) the total SLR securities held in the HTM category is not more than 25 \nper cent of their NDTL as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight.  \n15.2.3 UCBs are not expected to resort to sale of securities held in HTM category. However, if due to liquidity stress, UCBs are required to sell securities from HTM portfolio, they may do so with the permission of their Board of Direc tors \nand rationale for such sale may be clearly recorded. Profit on sale of investments from HTM category shall first be taken to the Profit and Loss account and, thereafter, the amount of such profit shall be appropriated to \u2018Capital Reserve\u2019 from the net  profit for the year after statutory \nappropriations. Loss on sale shall be recognized in the Profit and Loss account in the year of sale.  29  15.3 Held for Trading \n15.3.1 Securities acquired by the banks with the intention to trade by taking \nadvantage of the short -term pr ice/interest rate movements will be classified \nunder HFT category.  \n15.3.2 If banks are not able to sell the security within 90 days due to exceptional circumstances such as tight liquidity conditions, or extreme volatility, or market becoming unidirectional, the security should be shifted to the AFS category, subject to conditions stipulated in paragraphs 15 .5.3 and 15 .5.4 \nbelow.  \n15.4 Available for Sale \n15.4.1 Securities which do not fall within the above two categories will be classified under AFS  category.  \n15.4.2 Banks have the fr eedom to decide on the extent of holdings under AFS \ncategory. This may be decided by them considering various aspects such as basis of intent, trading strategies, risk management capabilities, tax planning, manpower skills, capital position,  etc. \n(Profit o r loss on sale of investments in HFT and AFS categories should be taken to the \nProfit and Loss  Account).  \n15.5 Shifting of  investments \n15.5.1 Banks may shift investments to/from HTM category with the approval of the Board of Directors once in a year. Such shifting will normally be allowed at \nthe beginning of the accounting year. No further shifting to/from this category will be allowed during the remaining part of that accounting year.  \n15.5.2 Banks may shift investments from AFS category to HFT category with the approval of their Board of Directors. In case of exigencies, such shifting may be done with the approval of the Chief Executive of the Bank, but should be ratified by the Board of  Directors.  \n15.5.3 Shifting of investments from HFT category to AFS category is generally not \nallowed. However, it will be permitted only under exceptional circumstances such as mentioned in paragraph 15 .3.2 above, subject to depreciation, if \nany, applicable on the date of transfer, with the approval of the Board of Directors/Investment Committee.  \n15.5.4 Transfer of scrips from one category to another, under all circumstances, \nshould be done at the acquisition cost/book value/market value on the date \nof transfer, whichever is the least, and the depreciation, if any, on such \ntransfer should be fully provided  for. 30   \n15.6 Classification of Investments in the Balance Sheet  \nFor the purpose of Balance Sheet, the investments should continue to be classif ied in the \nfollowing categories : \n(i) Government  securities  \n(ii) Other approved securities  \n(iii) Shares  \n(iv) Bonds of  PSU \n(v) Others  \n16. Valuation of investments \n16.1 Valuation Standards  \n16.1.1 Investments classified under HTM category need not be marked to market \nand will be carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the face value, in which case the premium should be amortised over the period remaining \nto maturity.  \n16.1.2 The individual scrip in the AFS category will be marked to market at the year-end or at more frequent intervals. The book value of the individual \nsecurities would not undergo any change after the revaluation.  \n16.1.3 The individual scrip in the HFT category will be marked to market at \nmonthly or at more frequent intervals. The book value of  individual  \nsecurities in this category would not undergo any change after marking to market.  \nNote : Securities under AFS and HFT categories shall be valued scrip- wise and \ndepreciation/appreciation shall be aggregated for each classification as indicated at paragraph 15 .6 above separately for AFS and HFT. Net depreciation, if any, shall be \nprovided for. Net appreciation, if any, should be ignored. Net depreciation required to be \nprovided for in any one classification should not be reduced on account of net \nappreciation in any other classification. Similarly , net depreciation for any classification \nin one category should not be reduced from appreciation in similar classification in \nanother  category.  \n16.1.4 (i) Investment Depreciation Reserve (IDR) required to be created on \naccount of depreciation in the value of investments held under 'AFS' or 'HFT' categories in any year should be debited to the Pr ofit & Loss Account \nand an equivalent amount (net of tax benefit, if any, and net of consequent reduction in the transfer to Statutory Reserve) or the balance available in 31  the Investment Fluctuation Reserve ( IFR) Account, whichever is less, shall \nbe transferred from the IFR Account to Profit & Loss Account.  \n(ii) In the event that IDR created on account of depreciation in \ninvestments is found to be in excess of the required amount in any year, \nthe excess should be credi ted to the Profit & Loss Account and an \nequivalent amount (net of taxes, if any, and net of transfer to Statutory \nReserves as applicable to such excess provision) should be appropriated to the IFR Account to be utilised to meet future depreciation requirem ent \nfor investments.  \n(iii) The amounts debited to the Profit & Loss Account for depreciation \nprovision and the amount credited to the Profit & Loss Account for reversal of excess provision should be debited and credited respectively under the head \"Expenditure -  Provisions & Contingencies\".  \n(iv) The amounts appropriated from the Profit & Loss Account/ to IFR \nand the amount transferred from the IFR to the Profit & Loss Account should be shown as 'below the line' items after determining the profit for the year.  \n16.1.5 In respect of securities included in any of the three categories where \ninterest/principal is in arrears, the banks should not reckon income on the securities and should also make appropriate provisions for the depreciation in the value of the investment. The banks should not set -off \nthe depreciation requirement in respect of these non- performing securities \nagainst the appreciation in respect of other performing securities.  \n16.2 Market  Value \n16.2.1 Quoted Securities  \nThe 'market value' for the purpose of periodical valuatio n of investments included \nin the AFS and the HFT categories would be the market price of the scrip as available from the trades/quotes on the stock exchanges, SGL account transactions, and prices declared by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Limited \n(FBIL)/F IMMDA . \n16.2.2 Unquoted SLR  Securities  \nIn respect of unquoted securities, the procedure as detailed below should be adopted.  \n(i) Central Government  Securities  \n(a) The Reserve Bank will not announce the YTM rates for unquoted Government securities, for the purpose of valuation of investments by 32  banks. The banks shall value the unquoted Central Government \nsecurities on the basis of the prices/YTM rates put out by the Financial \nBenchmark India Pvt. Ltd. (FBIL)  at periodical  intervals.  \n(b) It is clarified that the reckoning of number of years for the purpose of \ndeciding upon appropriate \u2018Yield To Maturity\u2019 (YTM) Rate be done by \nrounding off the fractional period of a year to the nearest completed \nyear.  \n(c) As regards valuation of other unquoted securities including PSU bonds, \nbanks should uniformly follow YTM method for arriving at valuation of unquoted securities.  \n(ii) Treasury Bills should be valued at carrying cost.  \n(iii) State Government  Securities  \nState Government securities shall  be valued on the basis of the prices / YTM \nrates put out by FBIL periodically.  \n(iv) Other Approved Securities  \nOther approved securities will be valued applying the YTM method by marking it up by 25 basis points above the yields of the Central Government Securities of equivalent maturity put out by FBIL  periodically.  \n16.2.3 Unquoted Non- SLR securities \n(i) Debentures/Bonds  \nAll debentures/bonds other than debentures/ bonds which are in the nature of advance should be valued on the YTM basis. Such debentures/bonds may be of different ratings. These will be valued with appropriate mark -up over the \nYTM rates for Central Governme nt securities as put out by FBIL /FIMMDA  \nperiodically. The mark -up will be graded according to the ratings assigned to \nthe debentures/bonds by the rating agencies subject to the following:  \n(a) The rate used for the YTM for rated debentures/bonds should be at least 50 basis points above the rate applicable to a Government of India security  of equivalent maturity,  \n(b) The rate used for the YTM for un- rated debentures/ bonds should not \nbe less than the rate applicable to rated debentures/bonds of equivalent maturity. T he mark -up for the un- rated debentures/bonds should \nappropriately reflect the credit risk borne by the bank.  \n(c) Where interest/principal on the debenture/bonds is in arrears, the provision should be made for the debentures as in the case of 33  debentures/bonds t reated as advances. The depreciation/provision \nrequirement towards debentures where the interest is in arrears or \nprincipal is not paid as per due date, shall not be allowed to be set -off \nagainst appreciation against other debentures/bonds.  \n(ii) Where the debentures/bond is quoted and there have been transactions within 15 days prior to the valuation date, the value adopted should not be higher than the rate at which the transaction is recorded on the stock  \nexchange.  \n(iii) Shares of Co- operative Institutions  \nIf UCBs h ave regularly received dividends from co- operative institutions, then \ntheir shares should be valued at face value. In a number of cases, the co-operative institutions in whose shares the UCBs have made investments have either gone into liquidation or have not declared dividend at all. In such cases, the banks should make full provision in respect of their investments in shares of such co- operative institutions. In cases where the financial position \nof co- operative institutions in whose shares banks have made investments is \nnot available, the shares have to be taken at Re. 1/ - per co- operative \ninstitution.  \n(iv) Valuation of Non- SLR securities issued by the Government of India  \n(a) Over the years, the Government of India has, from time to time, issued several special securities which do not qualify for the purpose of complying with the SLR requirements of UCBs. Such Government securities are governed by a separate set of terms and conditions and entail a higher degree of illiquidity spread.  \n(b) For the limited purpose of valuation, a ll special securities issued by the \nGovernment of India, directly to the beneficiary entities, which do not carry SLR status, may be valued at a spread of 25  bps above the \ncorresponding yield on Government of India securities.  \n(c) It may be noted, that at present, such special securities comprise: Oil Bonds, Fertiliser  Bonds, bonds issued to the State Bank of India (during \nthe rights issue), Unit Trust of India, Industrial Finance Corporation of India Ltd., Food Corporation of India, the erstwhile Industrial Investment Bank of India Ltd., the erstwhile Industrial Development Bank of India \nand the erstwhile Shipping Development Finance Corporation.  \n \n 34  16.2.4 Units of Mutual  funds \nInvestments in quoted debt/money market Mutual Fund Units should be valued as \nper stock exchange quotations. Investments in un- quoted Mutual Funds Units  are \nto be valued on the basis of the latest re- purchase price declared by the Mutual \nFunds in respect of each particular Scheme. In case of funds with a lock -in period, \nor where repurchase price/market quote is not available, units could be valued at Net Asset Value (NAV). If NAV is not available, then these could be valued at cost, \ntill the end of the lock -in period.  \n17. INVESTMENT FLUCTUATION RESERVE (IFR)  \nWith a view to build up adequate reserves to guard against market risks:  \n17.1 All UCBs sh all build IFR out of realised gains on sale of investments, and subject \nto available net profit, of a minimum of 5 per cent of the investment portfolio. This minimum  requirement  should be computed with reference to investments in two \ncategories, viz. HFT and AFS. However, banks are free to build up a higher percentage of IFR up to 10 per cent of the portfolio depending on the size and composition of their portfolio, with the approval of their Board of Directors.  \n17.2 Banks should transfer maximum amount of the gains realised on sale of investment \nin securities to the IFR. Transfer to IFR shall be as an appropriation of net profit after appropriation to Statutory Reserve.  \n17.3 The IFR consisting of realised gains from the sale of investments held in AFS & \nHFT would be eli gible for inclusion in Tier II  capital.  \n17.4 Transfer from IFR to the Profit and Loss Account to meet depreciation requirement \non investments would be a \u2018below the line\u2019 extraordinary  item.  \n17.5 Banks should ensure that the unrealised gains on valuation of the investment \nportfolio are not taken to the Income Account or to the IFR.  \n17.6 Banks may utilise the amount held in IFR to meet, in future, the depreciation \nrequirement on investment in securities.  \n17.7 A bank may, at its discretion, draw down the balance available in IFR in excess of \n5 per  cent of its investment in AFS & HFT  for credit to the balance of profit / loss as \ndisclosed in the profit and loss account at the end of any accounting year. In the event the balance in the IFR is less than 5 per  cent of its investment in AFS & HFT, a draw \ndown will be permitted subject to the following conditions : \n(a) The drawn down amount is used only for meeting the minimum Tier I capital \nrequirements by way of appropriation to free reserves or reducing the balance \nof loss, and 35  b) The amount drawn down is not more than the extent to which the MTM \nprovisions made during the aforesaid year exceed the net profit on sale of investments during that year.  \n17.8 Distinction between IFR and Investment Depreciation Reserve (IDR)  \nIt may be noted that IFR is created out of appropriation of net profit from the realised gains from the sale of investments held in AFS & HFT,  and forms part of \nthe reserves of the bank qualifying under Tier II capital.  \nIDR is a provision created by charging diminution in investment value to Profit and \nLoss Account. While the amount held in IFR should be shown in the balance sheet as such, the amount held in IDR should be reported as Contingent provisions against depreciation in investment . 36  Annex I  \n \nCertain clarifications on brokers\u2019 limits \n[Paragraph 6.3] \n \nSr. \nNo. Issue raised  Response  \n1. The year should be calendar \nyear or financial year?  Since banks close their accounts at \nthe end of March, it may be more  \nconvenient to follow t he financial year. \nHowever, the  banks may follow \ncalendar year or any other period of \n12 months provided, if it is  \nconsistently  followed in future.  \n2. Whether to arrive at the total \ntransactions of the year, \ntransactions entered into \ndirectly with counterparties , i.e. \nwhere no brokers are involved would also be taken into account?  Not necessary. However, if there are \nany direct deals with the brokers as purchasers or sellers the same would have to be included in the total transactions to arrive at the limit of transactions to be done through an individual broker.  \n3. Whether in case of ready \nforward deals both the legs of the deals i.e. , purchase as well \nas sale will be included to arrive \nat the volume of total \ntransactions?  Yes \n4. Whether central loan/state \nloan/treasury bills etc. \npurchased though direct \nsubscriptions/auctions will be included in the volume of total \ntransactions?  No, as brokers are not involved as \nintermediaries.  \n5. It is possible that even though \nbank considers that a particular \nbroker has touched the \nprescribed limit of 5 per cent , he \nmay come with an offer during the \nremaining period of the year \nwhich the bank may find to its \nadvantage as compared to offers \nreceived from the other brokers \nwho have not yet done business \nupto the prescribed limit. If the offer received is more \nadvantageous the limit for the broker may be exceeded and the reasons therefore recorded,  and approval of \nthe competent authority/Board \nobtained post facto.  37  6. For a bank which rarely deals \nthrough brokers  and \nconsequently the volume of \nbusiness is small maintaining the \nbroker -wise limit of 5  per cent  \nmay mean splitting the orders in small values amongst different brokers and there may also arise \nprice  differential.  There may be no need to split an \norder. If any deal causes, the particular broker's share to exceed \n5 per cent  limit, our circular \nprovides the necessary flexibility inasmuch as Board's post facto approval can be obtained.  \n7. During the course of the year, it \nmay not be possible to \nreasonably predict what will be the total quantum of transactions through brokers as a result of which there could be deviation in complying with  the norm of 5 per \ncent. The bank may get post facto \napproval from the Board after explaining to it, the circumstances in which the limit was exceeded.  \n8. Some of the small private sector \nbanks have mentioned that \nwhere the volume of business \nparticularly, the transactions \ndone through brokers is small the observance of 5 per cent  limit \nmay be difficult. A suggestion has, therefore, been made that the limit may be required to be \nobserved if the business  done  \nthrough a br oker, exceeds a cut -\noff point of say \u20b910 crore.  As already observed the limit of 5  \nper cent  can be exceeded subject \nto reporting the transactions to the \ncompetent authority post facto. Hence, no change in instructions is considered necessary.  \n9. Whether the limit is to be \nobserved with reference to total transactions of the previous year as the total transactions of the current year would be known only at the end of the year? The limit has to be observed with \nreference to the year under review. While oper ating the limit, \nthe bank should consider  the \nexpected turnover of the current year which may be based on turnover of the previous year and anticipated rise or fall in the \nvolume of business in the current  \nyear.  38  Annex II  \n \nDefinitions of certain terms  \n[Paragraph 12 .1.3] \n \n1. With a view to imparting clarity and to ensure that there is no divergence in the \nimplementation of the guidelines, some of the terms used in the guidelines are defined below.  \n2. A security will be treated as rated if it is subjected to a detailed rating exercise by an \nexternal rating agency in India which is registered with SEBI and is carrying a current or valid \nrating. The rating relied upon will be deemed to be current or valid if: \n \n(i) the credit rating letter relied upon is  not more than one month old on the date of \nopening of the issue,  and \n(ii) the rating rationale from the rating agency is not more than one year old on the date \nof opening of the issue,  and \n(iii) the rating letter and the rating rationale is a part of the offer docum ent. \n(iv) In the case of secondary market acquisition, the credit rating of the issue should be in force and confirmed from the monthly bulletin published by the respective rating agency.  \n(v) Securities which do not have a current or valid rating by an external rat ing agency \nwould be deemed as unrated securities.  \n \n3. A \u2018listed\u2019 debt security is a security which is listed in a stock exchange. If not so, it is an \n\u2018unlisted\u2019 debt  security.  \n4. A Non Performing Investment (NPI), similar to a Non Performing Advance (NPA), is one \nwhere : \n \n(a) Interest/ instalment (including maturity proceeds) is due and remains unpaid for \nmore than 90 days.   \n(b) if any credit facility availed by the issuer is NPA in the books of the bank, investment \nin any of the securities issued by the same issuer would also be treated as  NPI. \n \n \n  \n \n   39  Annex I II \n \nGuidelines for accounting of Repo/Reverse Repo transactions \n[Paragraph 9.5] \n \n1. The Reserve Bank of India (Amendment) Act, 2006 (Act No. 26 of  2006) provides \na legal definition of 'repo' and 'reverse repo' (vide sub- sections (c) and (d) of section 45 U \nof Chapter III D of the Act) as an instrument for borrowing (lending) funds by selling \n(purchasing) securities with an agreement to repurchase (resell) the securities on a \nmutually agreed futur e date at an agreed price which includes interest for the  funds  \nborrowed  (lent).  Accordingly, to bring such transactions onto the balance sheet in their \ntrue economic  sense and enhance transparency, the accounting guidelines have been \nreviewed and the r evised guidelines are given below:  \n2. Applicability of the accounting guidelines: The revised accounting guidelines will \napply to market repo transactions in Government Securities and corporate debt securities  \nincluding the tri -party repo in such securities . These accounting norms will, however, not \napply to repo / reverse repo transactions conducted under the Liquidity Adjustment \nFacility (LAF) with Reserve Bank.  \n3. Market participants may undertake repos from any of the three categories of \ninvestments, viz., Held for Trading , Available for Sale and Held to  Maturity . \n4. The economic essence of a repo transaction, viz., borrowing (lending)  of funds by \nselling (purchasing) securities shall be reflected in the books of the repo participants, by accounting the same as c ollateralised lending and borrowing transaction, with an \nagreement to repurchase, on the agreed terms. Accordingly, the repo seller, i.e., borrower of funds in the first leg, shall not exclude the securities sold under repo but continue to carry the same i n his investment account (illustration given in the Annex I II (a) & I II (b)) \nreflecting his continued economic interest in the securities during the repo period. On the other hand, the repo buyer, i.e., lender of funds in the first leg, shall not include t he \nsecurities purchased under repo in his investment account but show it in a separate sub-head (Annex (I II) (a) & (I II) (b)). The securities would, however, be transferred from the \nrepo seller to repo buyer as in the case of normal outright sale/purchase transactions and such movement of securities shall be reflected using the Repo/Reverse Repo Accounts and contra entries. In the case of repo seller, the Repo Account is credited in the first leg for the securities sold (funds received), while the same is r eversed when the securities \nare repurchased in the second leg.  Similarly, in the case of repo buyer, the Reverse Repo Account is debited for the amount of securities purchased (funds lent) and the same is reversed in the second leg when the securities are sold back.  \n5. The first leg of the repo transaction should be contracted at the prevailing market \nrates. The reversal (second leg) of the transaction shall be such that the difference 40  between the consideration amounts of first and second legs should reflect the repo \ninterest.  \n6. The accounting principles to be followed while accounting for repo / reverse repo \ntransactions are as  under:  \n(i) Coupon /Discount  \n(a) The repo seller shall continue to accrue the coupon/discount on the \nsecurities sold under repo even during the repo period while the repo \nbuyer shall not accrue the same.  \n(b) In case the interest payment date of the security offered under repo fal ls \nwithin the repo period, the coupons received  by the buyer of the security \nshould be passed on to the seller of the securi ty on the date of receipt as \nthe cash consideration payable by the seller in the second leg does not \ninclude any intervening cash flows.  \n(ii) Repo Interest Income /  Expenditure  \nAfter the second leg of the repo / reverse repo transaction is over,  \n(a) the difference between consideration amounts of the first leg and second \nleg of the repo shall be reckoned as Repo Interest Income / Expenditure in the books of the repo buyer / seller respectively;  and \n(b) the balance outstanding in the Repo Interest Income / Expenditure account should be transferred to the Profit and Loss account as an \nincome or an expenditure. As regards repo / reverse repo transactions outstanding on the balance sheet date, only the accrued income / expenditure till the balance sheet date should be taken to the Profit and \nLoss account. Any repo income / expenditure for the remaining period should be reckoned for the next  accounting period.  \n(iii) Marking to Market  \nThe repo seller shall continue to mark to market the securities sold under repo transactions as per the investment classification of the security. To illustrate, in case \nthe securities sold by banks under repo transactions are out of the Available for \nSale category, then the mark to market valuation for such securities should be done \nat least once a quarter. For entities which do not follow any investment classification norms, the valuation for securities sold under repo transactions may be in \naccordance wit h the valuation norms followed by them in respect of securities of \nsimilar  nature.  41  7. Accounting Methodology \nThe accounting methodology to be followed along with the illustrations is given in Annexes \nIII (a) and I II (b). Participants using more stringent accounting principles may continue \nusing the same principles.  \n8. Classification of Accounts \nBanks shall classify the balances in Repo Account under Schedule 4 under item I (ii) or I \n(iii) as appropriate. Similarly, the balances in Reverse Repo Account shall be classified \nunder Schedule 7 under item I (ii) a or I (ii) b as appropriate. The balances in Repo interest \nexpenditure Account and Reverse Repo interest income Account shall be classified under Schedule 15 (under item II or III as appropriate) and under Schedule 13 (under item III or IV as appropriate) respectively. The balance sheet classification for other participants shall be governed by the guidelines issued by the respective regulators.  \n9. Disclosure  \nThe disclosures should be made by banks in the \u201cNotes on Accounts\u2019 to the Balance Sheet , as provided in Annexure III -  C.3(e) of \nMaster Direction on Financial Statements \n- Presentation and Disclosures dated Augus t 30, 2021 . 42    \nAnnex I II (a) \nRecommended Accounting Methodology for accounting of  \nRepo / Reverse Repo transactions  \n[Paragraph 7 of Annex I II] \n(i) The follo wing accounts may be maintained , viz. i) Repo Account, ii) Reverse \nRepo Account, iii) Reverse Repo Interest Income Account, iv) Repo Interest Expenditure \nAccount v) Reverse Repo Interest Receivable Account and vi) Repo Interest Payable  \nAccount.  \n(ii) In additi on to the above, the following 'contra' accounts may also be maintained, \nviz. i) Se curities  Sold under Repo Account, (ii) Securities Purchased under Reverse \nRepo Account, (iii) Securities Receivable under Repo Account and (iv) Securities Deliverable under Reverse Repo Account.  \nRepo  \n(iii) In a repo transaction, the securities should be sold in the first leg at market \nrelated prices and re -purchased in the second leg at the same prices. The \nconsideration amount in the second leg would, however, include the repo interest. The sale and repurchase should be reflected in the Repo  Account.\n \n(iv) Though the securities are not excluded from the repo seller's  investment account \nand not included in the repo buyer's investment account, the transfer of securities shall be reflected by using the necessary contra  entries.  \nReverse Repo  \n(v) In a reverse repo transaction, the securities should be purchased in the first leg \nat prevailing market prices and sold in the second leg at the same prices. The consideration amount in the second leg would, however, include the repo interest. The purchase and sale should be reflected i n the Reverse Repo Account.  \n(vi) The balances in the Reverse Repo Account shall not be a part  of the Investment  \nAccount  for balance sheet  purposes  but can be reckoned for SLR purposes if the \nsecurities acquired under reverse repo transactions are approved securities.  \nOther aspects relating to Repo/Reverse Repo  \n(vii) In case the interest payment date of the securities sold under repo falls within the \nrepo period, the coupons received by the buyer of the security should be passed on to the seller on the date of rec eipt as the cash consideration payable  by the seller  in the \nsecond leg does  not include any intervening cash flows.  \n(viii) To reflect the accrual of  interest in respect  of the outstanding repo transactions \nat the end of the accounting period, appropriate entries should be passed in the Profit and 43  Loss account to reflect Repo Interest Income / Expenditure in the books of the buyer / \nseller respectively and the same should be debited / credited as an expenditure \npayable/i ncome receivable. Such entries passed should be reversed on the first working \nday of the next accounting period.  \n(ix) Repo seller continues to accrue coupon/discount as the case may be, even \nduring the repo period while the repo buyer shall not accrue the same.  \n(x) Illustrative examples are given in Annex I II (b) \n \n 44   \nAnnex I II (b) \n \nIllustrative examples for accounting of Repo / Reverse repo transactions  \n[Paragraph 7 of Annex I II] \nWhile in the body of the circular, the term \"repo\" is used generically to include both repo and \nreverse repo (which is simply a mirror image of a repo transaction), in this Annex the accounting \nguidelines have been set out separately for repo and reverse repo for clarity.  \nA.

Scope  \nThese guidelines would be applicable to sale of financial assets enumerated in \nparagraph 3 below, by Multi -State Co -operative Banks, for asset reconstruction / \nSecuritisation under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enfor cement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act).  \n2. Structure \nThe guidelines to be followed by Multi -State Co -operative Banks while selling their \nfinancial assets to ARC under the Act ibid and investing in bonds / debentures / security \nreceipts offered by the ARC are given below. The prudential guidelines have been \ngrouped under the following headings : \ni) Financial assets which can be sold.  \nii) Procedure for sale of financial assets of Multi -State Co -operative Banks to \nARC, including valuation and pricing aspects.  \niii) Prudential norms, in the following areas, for Multi -State Co -operative Banks \nfor sale of their financial assets to ARC  and for investing in bonds / \ndebentures / security receipts and any other securities offered by the ARC as \ncompensation c onsequent upon sale of financial assets : \na) Provisioning / Valuation norms  \nb) Capital adequacy norms  \nc) Exposure norms  \niv) Disclosure requirements  \n3. Financial assets which can be sold \nA financial asset may be sold to the ARC by Multi -State Co -operative Ba nks where the \nasset is : \ni) A Non Performing Asset, including a non- performing bond / debenture, and \nii) A Standard  Asset where:  \n(a) the asset is under consortium / multiple banking arrangements with Commercial Banks and Multi State Cooperative Banks as member \nbanks,  \n(b) at least 75 per cent  by value of the asset is classified as non- performing \nasset in the books of other banks, and 52  (c) at least 75 per cent  (by value) of the banks who are under the \nconsortium / multiple banking arrangements agree to the s ale of the \nasset to ARC . \n4. Procedure for sale of financial assets of Multi -State Co -operative Banks to \nARC, including valuation and pricing aspects \n(a) The SARFAESI Act, 2002 allows acquisition of financial assets by ARC  from Multi -\nState Co -operative Bank  on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon \nbetween them. This provides for sale of the financial assets on 'without recourse' \nbasis, i.e., with the entire credit risk associated with the financial assets being transferred to ARC, as well as on 'wi th recourse' basis, i.e., subject to unrealized \npart of the asset reverting to the seller bank. Multi -State Co -operative Banks are, \nhowever, directed to ensure that the effect of the sale of the financial assets should be such that the asset is taken off f rom the books of the bank and after the sale \nthere should not be any known liability devolving on the bank.  \n(b) Banks which propose to sell their financial assets to ARC should ensure that the \nsale is conducted in a prudent manner in accordance with the policy approved by the Board. The Board shall lay down policies and guidelines covering, inter alia,  \ni) Financial assets to be sold;  \nii) Norms and procedure for sale of such financial assets;  \niii) Valuation procedure to be followed to ensure that the realisable value of \nfinancial assets is reasonably estimated;  \niv) Delegation of powers of various functionaries for taking decision on the sale \nof the financial assets; etc.  \n(c) Banks should ensure that subsequent to sale of the financial assets to ARC, they do not assume any operational, legal or any other type of risks relating to the financial assets sold.  \n(d)    (i)    Each bank will make its own assessment of the value offered by the ARC for \nthe financial asset and decide whether to accept or reject the offer.  \n(ii)    In the case of consortium / multiple banking arrangements with other Multi -\nState Cooperative Banks and Commercial Banks, if 75 per cent  (by value) of \nthe banks decide to accept the offer, the remaining banks will be obligated to accept the offer.  \n(iii)  Under no circumstances, can a transfer to the ARC  be made at a contingent \nprice whereby in the event of shortfall in the realization by t he ARC, the banks \nwould have to bear a part of the shortfall.  \n(e) Banks may receive cash or bonds or debentures as sale consideration for the financial assets sold to ARC.  53  (f) Bonds / debentures received by banks as sale consideration towards sale of \nfinancial assets to ARC will be classified as investments in the books of banks.  \n(g) Banks may also invest in security receipts or other bonds / debentures issued by ARC in respect of financial assets sold by them to ARC. These securities will also \nbe classifie d as investments in the books of banks.  \n(h) In cases of specific financial assets, where it is considered necessary, banks may enter into agreement with ARC to share, in an agreed proportion, any surplus \nrealised by ARC on the eventual realisation of the c oncerned asset. In such cases \nthe terms of sale should provide for a report from the ARC to the bank on the value \nrealised from the asset. No credit for the expected profit will be taken by banks \nuntil the profit materializes on actual sale.  \n5. Prudential norms for banks for the sale transactions \n(A) Provisioning / valuation norms \n(a)    (i)     When a bank sells its financial assets to ARC, on transfer the same will \nbe removed from its books.  \n(ii) If the sale to ARC is at a price below the net book value (NBV) (i.e., \nbook value less provisions held), the shortfall should be debited to the profit and loss account of that year.  \n(iii) Multi -State Urban Cooperative Banks are permitted to reverse to P&  L \naccount the excess provision when the sale is for a value higher than \nthe NBV on sale of NPAs to their profit and loss account. However, \nbanks can reverse excess provision arising out of sale of NPAs only when the cash received (by way of initial consideration and/or redemption of security receipt /pass through certificates) is higher than the NBV of the NPAs sold to ARCs . Further, the quantum of excess \nprovision reversed to profit and loss account will be limited to the extent of which cash exceeds the NBV of the NPAs sold. The quantum of excess provision reversed to the Profit and Loss account on account of sale of NPAs shall be disclosed in the financial statements of the bank under \u201cNotes to Account\u201d.  \n(iv) When banks invest in the security receipts is sued by ARC in respect of \nthe financial assets sold by them to the ARC, the sale shall be recognised in books of the banks at the lower of:  \n* the redemption value of the security receipts, and  \n* the NBV of the financial asset.  \nThe above investment should b e carried in the books of the bank / FI at the \nprice as determined above until its sale or realization, and on such sale or 54  realization, the loss or gain must be dealt with in the same manner as at (ii) \nand (iii) above.  \n(b) The securities (bonds and debent ures) offered by ARC  should satisfy the \nfollowing conditions:  \n(i) The securities must not have a term in excess of six years.  \n(ii) The securities must carry a rate of interest which is not lower than 1.5  \nper cent  above the 'Bank Rate' in force at the time of issue.  \n(iii) The securities must be secured by an appropriate charge on the assets transferred.  \n(iv) The securities must provide for part or full prepayment in the event the ARC sells the asset securing the security before the maturity date of the \nsecur ity. \n(v) The commitment of the ARC to redeem the securities must be \nunconditional and not linked to the realization of the assets.  \n(vi) Whenever the security is transferred to any other party, notice of transfer should be issued to the ARC.  \n(c) Investment in debentures / bonds / security receipts issued by ARC \nAll instruments received by banks from ARC as sale consideration for \nfinancial assets sold to them and also other instruments issued by ARC in \nwhich banks invest will be in the nature of non SLR secur ities. Accordingly, \nthe valuation, classification and other norms applicable to investment in non-SLR instruments prescribed by RBI from time to time would be applicable to bank's investment in debentures / bonds / security receipts issued by ARC. However,  if any of the above instruments issued by ARC is limited to the \nactual realisation of the financial assets assigned to the instruments in the concerned scheme, the bank shall reckon the Net Asset Value (NAV), obtained from ARC from time to time, for valua tion of such investments  \n(B) Capital Adequacy \nFor the purpose of capital adequacy, banks should assign risk weights as under to the investments in debentures / bonds / SRs issued by ARC and held by banks as \ninvestment : \ni) Risk weight for credit risk : 100%.  \nii) Risk weight for market risk: 2.5%  \nApplicable risk weight = (i) + (ii)  \n 55  (C) Exposure Norms \nBanks' investments in debentures/ bonds / SRs issued by an ARC will constitute \nexposure on the ARC. As there are a few ARC, banks' exposure on ARC through \ntheir investments in debentures / bonds / SRs issued by the ARC may go beyond \ntheir prudential exposure ceiling. In view of the extra ordinary nature of event, \nbanks will be allowed, in the initial years, to exceed prudential exposure ceiling on a case- to-case basis.  \n6. Disclosure Requirements \nBanks, which sell their financial assets to an ARC, shall be required to make the disclosures in the Notes on Accounts to their Balance sheets  as provided in Annexure \nIII - C.4(f)(i) of \nMaster Direction on Financial Statements -  Presentation and Disclosures \ndated August 30, 2021 . \n7. Related Issues  \n(a) ARC will also take over financial assets which cannot be revived and which, \ntherefore, will have to be disposed of on a realisation basis. Normally the ARC will \nnot take over these assets but act as an agent for recovery for which it will charge a fee.  \n(b) Where the assets fall in the above category, the assets will not be removed from \nthe books of the bank but realisations as and when received will be credited to the asset account. Provisioning for the asset will continue to be made by the bank in \nthe normal course.  \n \n  56  Appendix A  \n \nA.

In the past,  Commercial  Banks other than RRBs were permitted to transfer to profit \nand loss account (followed by subsequent appropriation to general reserve) outstanding \ncredit entries of individual value less than USD  2,500 or equivalent in Nostro accounts \noriginated up to March 31, 2002, subject to certain conditions.

Unless specifically  allowed by extant regulations, b anks shall take prior approval \nfrom the Reserve Bank of India before any appropriation is made from the Statutory \nReserve or any other reserve.  Banks are further advised that :   \na) all expenses including provisions and write -offs recognized in a period, whether \nmandatory or prudential, sh all be reflected in the profit and loss account for the \nperiod as an \u2018above the line \u2019 item ( i.e. before arriving at the net profit /loss for the \nyear); \nb) draw down from reserves , with the prior approval of Reserve Bank  of India , shall \nbe effected only \u2018below the line \u2019 (i.e. after arriving at the  net profit / loss for the \nyear); and  \nc) suitable disclosures shall be  made of such draw down in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 \nto the Balance Sheet.  \n19.  Subject to compliance with applicable laws, banks, without prior approval  of \nReserve Bank of India , can utilize the share premium account for meeting issue \nexpenses3 of shares to the extent that such expenses are incremental costs directly \nattributable to the transaction that otherwise would have been avoided. The share \npremium account shall not be utilized for writing off the expenses relating to the issue \nof debt instru ments.  \n20. In respect of provisioning for frauds,  banks  that have reported the fraud within the \nprescribed time shall have the option to make the provision  for the same  over a period, \nnot exceeding four quarters, commencing from the quarter in which the fraud has been \ndetected.  Where such a bank chooses to provide for the fraud over two to four quarters \n                                                            \n3 Registration and other regulatory fees, amounts paid to legal, accoun ting and other professional advisers, printing \ncosts and stamp duties   \n7 \n and this results in the full provisioning being made in more than o ne financial year,  \nsubject to compliance with applicable laws,  it may debit reserves other than the \nStatutory Reserve  by the amount remaining un -provided at the end of the financial year \nby credit to provisions.  However, subsequently, it should proportion ately reverse the \ndebits to the reserves and complete the provisioning by debiting profit and loss account, \nin the successive quarters of the next financial year.   Where there has been delay, \nbeyond the prescribed period, in reporting the fraud to the Rese rve Bank, the entire \nprovisioning is required to be made at once.  \nUnreconciled balances  \n21.  Unreconciled credit balances in any transitory account  represent ing unclaimed \nbalances sh all not be transferred to the profit and loss account  or to any reserves .  \nDeferred tax l iability  (DTL)  on Special Reserve created under  Section 36(1) (viii) \nof the Income Tax Act, 1961  \n22.  Banks  shall make provisions for  DTL on the Special Reserve  created under section  \n36(1) (viii) of Income Tax Act, 1961 .  \nWindow dressing   \n23.

Accounting Standard 5 - Net Profit or Loss for the Period, Prior Period \nItems and Changes in Accounting Policies  \nThe objective of this standard is to prescribe the classification and disclosure of \ncertain items in the statement of profit and loss so that all enterprises prepare \nand present such a statement on a uniform basis. Accordingly, this Standard \nrequir es the classification and disclosure of extraordinary and prior period items, \nand the disclosure of certain items within profit or loss from ordinary activities. It \nalso specifies the accounting treatment for changes in accounting estimates and \nthe disclos ures to be made in the financial statements regarding changes in \naccounting policies . Paragraph 4.3 of Preface to the Statements on Accounting \nStandards issued by the ICAI states that Accounting Standards are intended to \napply only to items which are mater ial. Since materiality is not objectively \ndefined, it has been decided that all banks should ensure compliance with the \nprovisions of the Accounting Standard in respect of any item of prior period \nincome or prior period expenditure which exceeds one per  cent of the total \nincome/total expenditure of the bank if the income/expenditure is reckoned on a \ngross basis or one per  cent of the net profit before taxes or net losses as the \ncase may be if the income is reckoned net of costs.   Since the format of the pro fit \nand loss accounts of banks prescribed in Form B under Third Schedule to the \nBanking Regulation Act , 1949 does not specifically provide for disclosure of the \nimpact of prior period items on the current year\u2019s profit and loss, such \ndisclosures, wherever warranted, may be made in the \u2018Notes on Accounts \u2019 to \nthe balance sheet of banks.  \n2. Accounting Standard 9  \u2013 Revenue Recognition  \nNon-recognition of income by the banks in case of non -performing advances \nand non -performing investments, in compliance with the regulatory prescriptions \nof the Reserve Bank of India , shall not attract a qualification by the statutor y \nauditors as this would be in conformity with provisions of the standard, as it Annex II  \n(Applicable to commercial banks)  \n \n- 41 - \n recognizes  postponement of recognition of revenue where collectability  of the \nrevenue is significantly uncertain.  \n3. Accounting Standard 11 - The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange \nRates  \nAS 11 is applied in the context of the accounting for transactions in foreign \ncurrencies and in translating the financial statements of foreign operations. T he \nissues that arise in this context have been identified and banks shall be guided \nby the following while complying with the provisions of the Standard:         \n(I) Classification of Integral and Non -integral Foreign Operations  \nParagraph 17 of AS 11 states that the method used to translate the financial \nstatements of a foreign operation depends on the way in which it is financed \nand operates in relation to the reporting enterprise. For this purpose, foreign \noperations are classif ied as either \"integral foreign operations\" or \"non -\nintegral foreign operations\". The issue that arises here pertains to the \nclassification of representative offices set up in foreign countries, foreign \nbranches and off -shore banking units set up in India as \"integral foreign \noperation\" or \"non -integral foreign operation\".  \nTaking into consideration the operation of the foreign branches of Indian \nbanks and the indicators listed in paragraph 20 of the standard, it is clarified \nthat foreign branches of Indian  banks , IFSC Banking Units (IBUs)  and \nOffshore Banking Units (OBUs) set up in India by banks shall be classified \nas \"non -integral foreign operations\". Taking into consideration the operation \nof the representative offices of banks set up abroad and the expl anation in \nparagraph 18 of the Standard, representative offices shall be classified as \n\"integral foreign operations\". These classifications are for the limited purpose \nof compliance with the Standard.  \n(II) Exchange rate for recording foreign currency transactio ns and \ntranslation of financial statements of non -integral foreign \noperation . \nAs per paragraphs 9 and 21 of the Standard, a foreign currency transaction \nshall be recorded by Indian branches and integral foreign operations, on \ninitial recognition in the reporting currency, by applying to the foreign Annex II  \n(Applicable to commercial banks)  \n \n- 42 - \n currency amount the exchange rate between the reporting currency and the \nforeign currency at the date of the transaction. Further, paragraph 24(b) of \nthe Standard states that income and expense items of non -integral foreign \noperations shall be translated at exchange rates at the dates of t he \ntransactions. Indian branches and integral foreign operations of banks may \nface difficulty in applying the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the \ntransaction in respect of the items which are not being recorded in Indian \nRupees or are currently bei ng recorded using a notional exchange rate, due \nto their extensive branch network and volume of transactions. Banks may \nalso face difficulty in translating income and expense items of a non -integral \nforeign operation by applying the exchange rates at the d ates of the \ntransactions . \nBanks, which are in a position to apply the exchange rate prevailing on the \ndate of the transaction for recording the foreign currency transactions at their \nIndian branches and integral foreign operations and for translating the \nincome and expense items of  non-integral foreign operations as required \nunder AS 11 shall comply with the requirements. Banks, which have an \nextensive branch network, have a high volume of foreign currency \ntransactions and are not fully equipped on the technology front shall be \nguided by the following:  \na) Paragraph 10 of the Standard allows, for practical reasons, the use of a \nrate that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction The \nStandard also states that if exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use \nof average rate for a period is unreliable. Since the enterprises are \nrequired to record the transactions at the date of the occurrence thereof, \nthe weekly average closing rate of the preceding week can be used for \nrecording the transactions occurring in the relevant  week, if the same \napproximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. In view of the \npractical difficulties which banks may have in applying the exchange rates \nat the dates of the transactions and since the Standard allows the use of \na rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction, \nbanks may use average rates as detailed below:  Annex II  \n(Applicable to commercial banks)  \n \n- 43 - \n b) FEDAI publishes a weekly average closing rate at the end of each week \nand a quarterly average closing rate at the end of each quarter for various \ncurrencies.  \nc) In respect of Indian branches and integral foreign operations, those \nforeign currency transactions, which are currently not being recorded in \nIndian Rupees at the date of the transaction or are being recorded using \na notional exchange rate shall now be recorded at the date of the \ntransaction by using the  weekly average closing rate of the preceding \nweek, published by FEDAI, if the same approximates the actual rate at \nthe date of the transaction.  \nd) Generally, Indian banks prepare the consolidated acc ounts for their \ndomestic and foreign branches at quarterly or longer intervals. Hence, \nbanks may use the  quarterly average closing rate , published by FEDAI at \nthe end of each quarter, for translating the income and expense items of \nnon-integral foreign operations during the quarter.  \ne) If the weekly average closing rate of the preceding week does not \napproximate the actual rate at the date of the transaction, the closing rate \nat the date of the transaction shall be used. For this purpose, the weekly \naverage  closing rate of the preceding week would not be considered \napproximating the actual rate at the date of the transaction if the \ndifference between ( A) the weekly average closing rate of the preceding \nweek and ( B) the exchange rate prevailing at the date of  the transaction, \nis more than three and a half percent  of (B). In respect of non -integral \nforeign operations, if there are significant exchange fluctuations during \nthe quarter, the income and expense items of non -integral foreign \noperations shall be trans lated by using the exchange rate at the date of \nthe transaction instead of the quarterly average closing rate. For this \npurpose, the exchange rate fluctuation would be considered as \nsignificant, if the difference between the two rates is  more than seven \npercent  of the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.  \nf) Banks are encouraged to equip themselves to record the foreign currency \ntransactions of Indian branches as well as integral foreign operations and Annex II  \n(Applicable to commercia l banks)  \n \n- 44 - \n translate the income as well as expense  items of non -integral foreign \noperations at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.  \n \n(III) Closing rate  \nParagraph 7 of the Standard defines \u2018Closing rate\u2019 as the exchange rate at \nthe balance sheet date. In order to ensure uniformity among banks, closing \nrate to be applied for the purposes of AS 11 (revised 2003) for the relevant \naccounting period would be the last  closing spot rate  of exchange \nannounced by FEDAI for that accounting period.  \n(IV) Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR)  \nIn the context of recognition of gains in profit and loss account from FCTR \non repatriation of accumulated profits/retained earnings from overseas \nbranch(es), it is clarified that the repatriation of accumulated profits shall not \nbe considered as disposal or part ial disposal of interest in non -integral \nforeign operations as per AS 11. Accordingly, banks shall not recognise in \nthe profit and loss account the proportionate exchange gains or losses held \nin the foreign currency translation reserve on repatriation of p rofits from \noverseas operations.  \n4. Accounting Standard 17 \u2013 Segment Reporting  \nThe indicative formats for disclosure under \u2018AS 17 \u2013 Segment Reporting\u2019 are as \nbelow: -  \nFormat  \nPart A: Business segments  \n     (Amount in \u20b9 crore)  \nBusiness \nSegments \uf067 Treasury  Corporate / \nWholesale Banking  Retail Banking  Other Banking \nBusiness  Total  \nParticulars \uf069 Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  \nRevenue            \nResult            \nUnallocated \nexpenses            \nOperating \nprofit            \nIncome taxes            \nExtraordinary \nprofit / loss            \nNet profit            Annex II  \n(Applicable to commercial banks)  \n \n- 45 - \n Business \nSegments \uf067 Treasury  Corporate / \nWholesale Banking  Retail Banking  Other Banking \nBusiness  Total  \nParticulars \uf069 Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  \nOther \ninformation:            \nSegment \nassets            \nUnallocated \nassets            \nTotal assets            \nSegment \nliabilities            \nUnallocated \nliabilities            \nTotal \nliabilities            \nNote: No disclosure need be made in the shaded portion  \nPart B: Geographic segments  \n     (Amount in \u20b9 crore)  \n Domestic  International  Total  \n Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  Current \nYear  Previous \nYear  \n(a) Revenue        \n(b) Assets        \nNote:  \na) The business segment shall ordinarily be considered as the primary reporting format and \ngeographical segment would be the secondary reporting format.  \nb) The business segments will be \u2018Treasury\u2019, \u2018Corporate / Wholesale Banking\u2019, \u2018Retail Banking\u2019 and \n\u2018Other banking operations\u2019.  \nc) \u2018Domestic\u2019 and \u2018International\u2019 segments will be the geographic segments for disclosure.  \nd) Banks shall adopt their own methods, on a re asonable and consistent basis, for allocation of \nexpenditure among the segments.  \ne) \u2018Treasury\u2019 shall include the entire investment portfolio.  \nf) Retail Banking shall include exposures which fulfil the four criteria of orientation, product, granularity, \nand low v alue of individual exposures for retail exposures laid down in Master Directions on Basel \nIII: Capital Regulations (modified from time to time). Individual housing loans will also form part of \nRetail Banking segment for the purpose of reporting under AS -17. \ng) Corporate / Wholesale Banking includes all advances to trusts, partnership firms, companies, and \nstatutory bodies, which are not included under \u2018Retail Banking\u2019.  \nh) Other Banking Business includes all other banking operations not covered under \u2018Treasury, \n'Wholesale Banking' and 'Retail Banking' segments. It shall also include all other residual operations \nsuch as para banking transactions/activities.  \ni) Besides the above -mentioned segments, banks shall report additional segments within \u201cOther \nBanking Business\u2019 which meet the quantitative criterion prescribed in the AS 17 for identifying \nreportable segments .  \nj) Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs, LABs and PBs)  shall sub -divide  retail banking  into \n(i) Digital Banking and (ii) Other Retail Banking  segments . The business involving digital banking \nproducts acquired by Digital Banking Units ( DBUs ) or existing digital banking products would qualify \nto be clubbed under \u2018Digital Banking\u2019 Segment .  \n5. Accounting Standard 18 \u2013 Related Party Disclosures  \nThe manner o f disclosures required by paragraphs 23 to 26 of AS 18 is illustrated \nas below. It may be noted that the format given below is merely illustrative in \nnature and is not exhaustive.  Annex II  \n(Applicable to commercial banks)  \n \n- 46 - \n  (Amount in \u20b9 crore)  \nItems/Related \nParty  Parent  \n(as per \nownership or \ncontrol)  Subsidiaries  \n Associates/  \nJoint \nventures  Key \nManagement  \nPersonnel @ Relatives of \nKey \nManagement \nPersonnel  Total  \nBorrowings#       \nDeposits#       \nPlacement of \ndeposits#       \nAdvances#       \nInvestments#       \nNon-funded \ncommitments#       \nLeasing/HP \narrangements \navailed#       \nLeasing/HP \narrangements \nprovided#       \nPurchase of fixed \nassets        \nSale of fixed \nassets        \nInterest paid        \nInterest received        \nRendering of \nservices*       \nReceiving of \nservices*       \nManagement \ncontracts*        \n@ Whole time directors of the Board and CEOs of the branches of foreign banks in India.  \n#   The outstanding at the year end and the maximum during the year are to be disclosed  \n*    Contract services etc. and not services like remittance facilities, locker facilities etc.  \nNote:  \ni) Related parties for a bank are its parent, subsidiary(ies), associates/ joint ventures, Key \nManagement Personnel (KMP) and relatives of KMP. KMP are the whole -time directors for an \nIndian bank and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)  for a foreign bank having branches in India. \nRelatives of KMP would be on the lines indicated in section  45 S of the RBI Act, 1934  \nii) The name and nature of related party relationship shall be disclosed, irrespective of whether ther e \nhave been transactions, where control exists within the meaning of the Standard. Control would \nnormally exist in case of parent -subsidiary relationship. The disclosures may be limited to \naggregate for each of the above related party categories and would pertain to the year -end \nposition as also the maximum position during the year.  \niii) The Accounting Standards is applicable to all nationalised banks. The accounting standard \nexempts  state -controlled  enterprises i.e., nationalised banks from making any disclosures \npertaining to their transactions with other related parties which are also state controlled \nenterprises. Thus,  nationalised banks need not disclose their transactions with the subsidiaries a s \nwell as the RRBs sponsored by them. However, they will be required to disclose their transactions \nwith other related parties.  Annex II  \n(Applicable to commercial banks)  \n \n- 47 - \n iv) Secrecy provisions: If in any of the above category of related parties there is only one related party \nentity, any disclosure wo uld tantamount to infringement of customer confidentiality . In terms of AS \n18, the disclosure requirements do not apply in circumstances when providing such disclosures \nwould conflict with the reporting enterprise\u2019s duties of confidentiality as specifically required in \nterms of statute, by regulator or similar co mpetent authority. Further, in case a statute or regulator \ngoverning an enterprise prohibits the enterprise from disclosing certain information,  which is \nrequired to be disclosed, non -disclosure of such information would not be deemed as non -\ncompliance wit h the Accounting Standards. On account of the judicially recognized common law \nduty of the banks to maintain the confidentiality of the customer details, they need not make such \ndisclosures. In view of the above, where the disclosures under the Accounting Standards are not \naggregated disclosures in respect of any category of related party i.e., where there is only one \nentity in any category of related party, banks need not disclose any details pertaining to that related \nparty other than the relationship wit h that related party.  \n6. Accounting Standard 23 \u2013 Accounting for Investments in Associates in  \nCFS \nThis Accounting Standard sets out principles and procedures for recognizing , in \nthe CFS, the effects of the investments in associates on the financial position \nand operating results of a group. The Standard requires that an investment in \nan associate shall be accounted for in CFS under the equity method subject to \ncertain exceptions. The term associate is defined as an enterprise in which the \ninvestor has signifi cant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint \nventure of the investor. Significant influence is the power to participate in the \nfinancial and/ or operating policy decisions of the investee but not control over \nthose policies. Such an influen ce may be gained by share ownership, statute or \nagreement. As regards share ownership, if an investor holds, directly or \nindirectly through subsidiaries 20  per cent  or more of the voting power of the \ninvestee, it is presumed that the investor has significant influence, unless it can \nbe clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. Conversely, if the investor \nholds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries less t han 20  per cent  of the \nvoting power of the investee, it is presumed that the investor does not have  \nsignificant influence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated. A  \nsubstantial or majority ownership by another investor does not necessarily \nprecl ude an investor from having significant influence.  \nThe issue is whether conversion of debt into equity in an enterprise by a bank \nby virtue of which the bank holds more than 20 percent will result in an investor -\nassociate relationship for the purpose of A S 23.  From the above it is clear that Annex II  \n(Applicable to commercial banks)  \n \n- 48 - \n though a bank may acquire more than 20  per cent  of voting power in the \nborrower entity in satisfaction of its advances it may be able to demonstrate that \nit does not have the power to exercise significant influence si nce the rights \nexercised by it are protective in nature and not participative. In such a \ncircumstance, such investment may not be treated as investment in associate \nunder this Accounting Standard. Hence the test shall not be merely the \nproportion of invest ment but the intention to acquire the power to exercise \nsignificant influence.  \n7. Accounting Standard 24 - Discontinuing operations  \nThis Sta ndard  establishes principles for reporting information about \ndiscontinuing operations.  Merger/ closure of branches of banks by transferring \nthe assets/ liabilities to the other branches of the same bank may not be deemed \nas a discontinuing operation and hence this Accounting Standard will not be \napplicable to merger / closure of branches of banks by transferring the assets/ \nliabilities to the other branches of the same bank. Disclosures shall be required \nunder the Standard only when: (i) discontinuing of the op eration has resulted in \nshedding of liability and realisation of the assets by the bank or decision to \ndiscontinue an operation which will have the above effect has been finalised by \nthe bank and (ii) the discontinued operation is substantial in its entire ty. \n8. Accounting Standard 25 \u2013 Interim Financial Reporting  \nThis Standard prescribes the minimum content of an interim financial report and \nthe principles for recognition and measurement in a complete or condensed \nfinancial statements for an interim period. The disclosures required to be made \nby listed banks in terms of the listing agreements would not tantamount to interim \nreporting as envisaged under AS 25 and as such  AS 25  is not mandatory for the \nquarterly reporting prescribed for listed banks. The recogn ition and \nmeasurement principles laid down under AS 25 shall however, be complied with \nin respect of such quarterly reports. Half yearly review  of accounts shall be \napplicable for all commercial banks6 irrespective of whether such banks are \nlisted or not.  Banks shall follow the format prescribed by the Department of \n                                                            \n6 Half yearly review of accounts by a uditors has only been prescribed for commercial banks.  Annex II  \n(Applicable to commercial banks)  \n \n- 49 - \n Supervision , Reserve Bank of India  (or National Bank for Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment for RRBs) for the purpose.  \n9. Accounting Standard  26 \u2013 Intangible asset  \nThis Standard prescribes the accounting treatment for intangible assets that are \nnot dealt with specifically in another accounting standard. With respect to \ncomputer software which has been customized for the bank\u2019s use and is \nexpected to be in use for some time , the detailed recognition and amortization \nprinciple in respect of computer software prescribed in the Standard adequately \naddresses these issues and may be followed by banks. It may be noted that \nintangible  assets recognized and carried in the balance sh eet of banks in \ncompliance with AS 26 shall attract provisions of section  15(1) of the Banking \nRegulation Act 1949, in terms of which banks are prohibited from declaring any \ndividend until any expenditure not represented by tangible assets is carried in \nthe balance sheet. Banks desirous of paying dividend while carrying any \nintangible assets in its books must seek exemption from section  15(1) of the \nBanking Regulation Act, 1949 from the Central Government.  \n10. Accounting Standard  27 - Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint \nVentures   \nThis Standard is applied in accounting for interests in joint ventures  and the \nreporting of joint venture assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the financial \nstatements of ventures and investo rs, regardless of the structures or forms \nunder which the joint venture activities take place. This Standard identifies three \nbroad types of joint ventures, namely, jointly controlled operations, jointly \ncontrolled assets and jointly controlled entities. I n case of jointly controlled \nentities, where banks are required to present  CFS, the investment in joint \nventures  shall be accounted for as per provisions of this standard. In respect of \njoint ventures in the form of joint ly controlled operations and jointl y controlled \nassets, this Accounting Standard is applicable for both solo financial statements \nas well as  CFS. It is clarified that though paragraph 2 6 of the Accounting \nStandard prescribes that for the purpose of solo financial statements, investment \nin jointly controlled entities is to be accounted as per Accounting Standard 13, \nsuch investment is to be reflected in the solo financial statements of banks as Annex I I \n(Applicable to commercial banks)  \n \n- 50 - \n per guidelines prescribed by R eserve Bank of India since Accounting Standard \n13 does not apply to banks.  RRBs sponsored by banks shall be treated as \nassociates  and AS 27 shall not apply for investment in RRBs . The investment in \nRRBs shall however, be accounted in the consolidated financial statements as \nper the provisions of Accounting Standard 23.  \n11. Accounting Standard  28 \u2013 Impairment of assets  \nThis standard prescribes the procedures that an enterprise applies to ensure \nthat its assets are carried at no more than their recoverable amount. It is clarified \nthat the standard shall not apply to inventories, investments and other financial \nassets such as loans and advances and shall generally be applicable to banks \nin so far as it relates to fixed assets. The Standard shall generally apply to \nfinancial lease assets and non -banking assets acquired in settlement of claims \nonly when the indications of impairment of the entity are evident.  \n  Annex III  \nDisclosure in financial statements \u2013 \u2018Notes to Accounts\u2019  \n \n- 51 - \n Annex III \nDisclosure in f inancial statements \u2013 \u2018Notes to Accounts\u2019   \nA. General  \nThe items listed in these Directions shall be disclosed in the \u2018Notes to Accounts\u2019 \nto the financial statements. Banks shall make additional disclosures  where \nmaterial.  \nB. Presentation  \nIn addition to the schedules to the Balance Sheet, a summary of \u2018Significant \nAccounting Polici es\u2019 and \u2018Notes to Accounts\u2019 shall be disclosed as separate \nSchedules.  \nC. Disclosure requirements  \nBanks shall , at the minimum,  furnish the following information in the \u2018Notes to \nAccounts\u2019 . Banks shall note that mere mention of an activity, transaction or item \nin the disclosure template does  not imply that it is permitted,  and banks sh all \nrefer to the extant statutory and regulatory requirements while determining the \npermissibility or otherwise of an activity or transaction.  Thes e are common \ntemplates for commercial banks and Co-operative Banks , unless stated \notherwise.  RRBs , LABs  and Co-operative Banks  may omit those line \nitems/disclosures which are not applicable/permitted or with no exposure / \ntransaction  both in the current ye ar and previous year. Banks shall disclose \ncomparative information in respect of the previous period for all amounts \nreported in the current period\u2019s financial statements.  Further, banks shall include \ncomparative information for narrative and descriptive i nformation if it is relevant \nto understanding the current period\u2019s financial statements.  Out of disclosure \nrequirements specified in this Annex, disclosures outlined in Annex III -A shall be \nmandatory for RCBs from the year ending March 31, 2024.  \n1.

No.S475/ 04.09.003/2021 -22                August 27, 2021 \n \nThe Chairman / Managing Director / Chief Executive Officer  \nof all banks participating in NEFT  \n \nMadam / Dear Sir, \nEnhancements to Indo-Nepal Remittance Facility Scheme \nThe Indo-Nepal Remittance Facility Scheme (Scheme) was launched by the Reserve Bank of \nIndia in May 2008 as an option for  cross-border remittances  from India to Nepal, with special \nfocus on requirements of migrant workers of Nepali origin working in India. The Scheme \nleverages the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) ecosystem available in the country \nfor origination of such remittances  and entails  a ceiling of \u20b950,000 per remittance with a \nmaximum of 12 remittances in a year . The beneficiary receives funds in Nepal ese Rupees \nthrough credit to her / his bank account maintained with the subsidiary of State Bank of India (SBI) in Nepal , i.e., Nepal  SBI Bank Limited (NSBL) or through an agency arrangement. \n \n2. A review of the Scheme has since been made and to boost trade payments between the \ntwo countries, a s also to facilitate person-to-person remittances electronically to Nepal , the \nfollowing enhancements are announced \u2013  \ni. Increase in the ceiling per transaction from \u20b950,000 to \u20b92 lakh.  \nii. Removal of the cap of  12 remittances in a year  per remitter . \niii. As hitherto, banks shall accept remittances by way of cash from walk -in customers or \nnon-customers. The ceiling of \u20b950,000 per remittance with a maximum of 12 remittances \nin a year shall, however, continue to apply for such remittances. \niv. The charges for transactions up to \u20b950,000 shall continue as provided in circular DPSS \n(CO) N o.1381/04.09.003/2008-09 dated February 09, 2009 . For transactions  beyond  \n\u20b950,000,  the charges  prescribed by SBI  shall apply . \nv. The banks shall put in place suitable velocity checks and other risk mitigation \nprocedures.  \n 2 \n  \n3. The enhancements are also expected to facilitate payments relating to retirement,  pension,  \netc., to our ex -servicemen who have settled / relocated in Nepal. \n4. These directi ons are issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and \nSettlement Systems Act,  2007 (Act 51 of 2007)  and shall come into effect from October  01, \n2021. \n \nYours faithfully, \n \n(P Vasudevan) Chief General Manager  \n  \n \n \n   ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/INDONEPALREMITTANCE9593B81D2D304BB0A320C3D981794D29.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Aug 27, 2021", "info": " \nRBI/2021- 22/93  \nDCM  (CC) No. 97527/03. 41.01/ 2021- 22                                            August 27, 2021 \n \nThe Chairman / Managing Director &  \nChief Executive Officer  \n(All Scheduled Commercial banks including RRBs ) \n \nMadam / Dear Sir , \n \nReview of incentive and other measures to enhance distribution of coins \n \nPlease refer to our Master Direction DCM (CC) No.G- 2/03.41.01/2021- 22 dated April \n01, 2021  on \u201cCurrency Distribution & Exchange Scheme (CDES)\u201d for bank branches \nincluding currency chests which inter  alia, provides for financial incentives of \u20b925 per \nbag to banks  for distribution of coins over the counter.  \n2.  Keeping in view the overall objectives of Clean Note policy and to ensure that all \nbank branches provide better customer service to members of publ ic with regard to \nexchange of notes and distribution of coins, the afore- said Scheme has since been \nreviewed and it has now been decided to revise the incentive being paid to the banks for distribution of coins with a major thrust on alternate avenues so as to extend the \noutreach. Accordingly, paragraph 2 (Incentives) Sl.No. (iii)  stands revised as follows : \na) Revised scheme of incentive for distribution of coins \n(i) With effect from September 01, 2021, an incentive of \u20b9 65/- per bag for \ndistribution of coins  (instead of \u20b9 25/- as earlier) will be paid on the basis of \nnet withdrawal from currency chest  (CCs) , withou t waiting for claims from \nbanks. Currency chest branch will have to pass on the incentive to the linked \nbank/branches for coins distributed by them on a pro- rata basis  within one \nweek from the receipt of incentives from RBI\n. \n(ii) An additional incentive of \u20b9 10/- per bag would be paid for coin distribution \nin rural and semi -urban areas on the submission of a CA / Auditor  certificate \nto this effect.  \n(iii) The distribution of coins shall  also be verified by RBI Regional Offices during \ninspection of currency chest/incognito visit to branches etc.  \nb) Banks to provide coins to bulk customers  \n \nFurther, in terms of Para graph 2, Sl. No. (iii) (iii) of circular ibid , banks were instructed \nto put in place a system of checks and balances so as to ensure that coins are \ndistributed to retail customers in small lots and not to bulk customers.  \nOn a review, with a view to meet  the coin requirements of bulk customers (requirement \nof more than 1 bag in a single transaction) banks are advised to provide coins to such \ncustomers  purely for business transactions . The banks may also endeavour to provide \nsuch services as part of their Board approved policy on \u2018D oor Step Banking\u2019  servic es.  \nSuch customers should be KYC compliant constituents of the bank and the record of coins supplied should be maintained. Banks are advised to exercise due diligence to \nensure that such facility is not misused.  \nDisbursement of coins to retail customers through counters of bank branches shall \ncontinue as hitherto.  \nc) Engaging Business Correspondents (BCs) for distribution of coins \n \nAttention is invited to \ncirculars DBOD. No.BAPD.BC.4 6/22.01.009/2013- 14 dated \nSeptember 2, 2013  and DCM (Plg) No. G 12 /10.65.03/2013- 14 dated September 10, \n2013 , permitting banks to include distribution of coins and banknotes in the scope of \nactivities undertaken by BCs and explore the possibility of enlisting their service for \ncarrying out various currency management functions while addressing the last mile \nconnectivity issues.  \nIn this context, it is reit erated that banks should enhance the engagement of their BCs \nfor distribution of coin s to public and may also incentivise such activities as per their \nBoard approved policy.   \nTo ensure steady supply of coins to bulk customers and BCs for onward distribution, \nall banks may ensure that each of their branches maintains a minimum stock of one \nbag of coins in  each denomination.  \n  \n \n \nd)  Engaging Cash in Transit (CIT) entities for distr ibution of coins \n \nAttention is also invited to circular  DCM (Plg) No. G -  14/10.65.03/2013- 14 dated \nOctober 10, 2013  on Monetary Policy Statement for 2013- 14 - Distribution of \nBanknotes and Coins \u2013  Alternative Avenues  wherein banks were advised to explore \nthe possibility of engaging the services of CIT entities for the purpose of distribution of \nbanknotes and coins. It is reiterated that banks may engage CIT entities  to further \nenhance distribution of coins  to public.  \n3.  Implementation of coin distribution measures may be commented upon by officers \ndeputed to undertake bi -monthly and half -yearly verification as a part of i nternal control \nand supervision by the currency chest maintaining bank.  \n4.  Senior Officers of banks on visits to currency chests and branches may be advised to specifically comment on the implement ation of the above measures in their visit \nreports.  \n5.

Thereafter, the lower of the book value/market value shall be used for \nnormalizing the market value of individual STRIPS to the book value/market value. Pos t- \nstripping, the book value/market value of the existing securities shall be derecognized and \nreplaced by the normalized value of STRIPS whose sum total shall exactly equal the book \nvalue/market value of the extinguished security (thereby ensuring that th ere is no profit or \nloss on account of stripping). Any appreciation, arising due to the shifting of the security \nfrom HTM shall be ignored. The same methodology shall be  follow ed for securities that are \nstripped from the AFS/HFT portfolio.  \n4.4 (i) Before a  security is stripped, it shall be marked to market. Appreciation, if any, sh all \nbe ignored and depreciation, if any,  shall be recognised , if the market value is lower \nthan the book value. Such depreciation shall not be aggregated for the purpose of \narrivi ng at net depreciation/appreciation of investment under the AFS/HFT category. \nThe book value/ market value of the security, whichever is lower, shall be used to \nnormalise the STRIPS.  \n(ii) The Normalisation principle, on stripping/reconstitution shall be ap plied on the clean \nprice of the security (without considering the accrued interest) as the accrued interest \nis booked as income/expenditure.  \n(iii) Normalisation sh all also be applied in the case of reconstitution (even when \nSTRIPS are acquired from the mar ket). \n(iv) The book value of the STRIPS (ZCBs) sh all be valued and marked to market as \nper these Directions .

The i nstructions were  issued vide the above circulars  in order to  enforce credit \ndiscipline  amongst the borrowers as well as to facilitate better monitoring by the \nlenders; and for this purpose, a graded approach had  been prescribed on opening and \noperating of current accounts  and CC/OD facilities. Banks were required to implement \nthese instructions in a non- disruptive manner while keeping the bonafide business \nrequirements of the borrowers in mind.  \n3. It is reiterated that :  \na. In case of borrowers who have not availed of CC/OD facilit y from any bank, \nthere is no restriction on opening of current accounts by any bank if  exposure of \nthe banking system to such borrowers is less than \u20b95 crore.  \nb. In case of borrowers who have not availed of CC/OD facility from any bank  \nand the exposure of the banking system is \u20b95 crore or more but less than \u20b95 0 \ncrore , there is no restriction on lending banks to such borrowers  from opening a  \ncurrent account. Even non- lending banks  can open current accounts for such \nborrowers though only for collection purpose s.  \nc. The restriction applies to borrowers in case they avail of CC/OD facility since \nall operations that can be carried out from a current account can also be carried \nout from a CC/OD account as banks in a CBS environment follow a one- bank -one-\ncustomer  model as against a one- branch- one-customer model.     \n4. We have in the meantime received requests from the banks for some more time \nto resolve the operational issues while implementing the circular in letter and spirit.  \nTherefore, i n order to ensure that the instructions are implemented in a non- disruptive \nmanner, it has been decided that:  \na. Banks will be permitted time till October 31, 2021 to implement the provisions \nof the circular. This extended time line shall be utilised by bank s to engage with \ntheir borrowers to arrive at mutually satisfactory resolutions within the ambit of the \ncircular. Such issues which banks are unable to resolve themselves shall be \nescalated to Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA) for appropriate guidance. Residual issue s, if any, requiring regulatory consider ation shall be flagged by IBA to the \nReserve Bank  for examination by Septem ber 30 , 2021.  \nb. In terms of para 1(vii) of \ncircular DOR.No.BP.BC.30/21.04.048/2020- 21 dated \nDecember 14, 2020 , accounts of White Label ATM operators and their agents are \nexempt from the provisions of the Current Account circu lar dated August 6, 2020 . \nSince Cash-in-Transit (CIT) Companies / Cash Replenishment Agencies (CRAs)  \nessentially carry out a similar activity, the exemption would be applicable  to these \nentities as well.   \nc. Banks shall put in place a monitoring mechanism, both at head office and \nregional/zonal office levels to monitor non- disruptive implementation of the circular \nand to ensure that customers are not put to undue inconvenience during the implementation process .    \nd.

In order to enable effective management of  attendant risks in outsourcing of such \nactivities, it was announced in t he Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies  \nreleased with the bi-monthly Monetary Polic y Statement 2020 -21 on February 05, 2021 , that \na framework for  outsourcing of p ayment and settlement -related activities by PSOs, will be \nissued by the Reserve Bank of India . Accordingly, a framework  for the same is provided in the \nAnnex . The PSOs shall ensure that all their outsourcing arrangements, including the existing \nones, are in compliance with this framework by March 31 , 2022.  \n 3. This framework  is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and \nSettlement  Syste ms Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007) . \n \n Yours faithfully,  \n \n \n \n(P Vasudevan)  \nChief General Manager \n \n Annex  \n(RBI circular CO.DPSS. POLC.No. S-384/02.32.001/ 2021- 2022  dated  August 3, 2021)  \nFramework for Outsourcing of Payment and S ettlement -related activities  by PSOs1 \n \n \n1. Introduction  \n1.1. This framework is applicable to non- bank PSOs insofar as it relates to their payment \nand / or settlement -related activities.   \n1.2. It seeks to put in place minimum standards to manage risks in outsourcing of payment \nand / or settlement -related activities (including other incidental activities like on-\nboarding customers2, IT based services, etc.).  \n1.3. The framework is  not applicable to activities other than those related to payment and / \nor settlement services , such as internal administrati on, housekeeping or similar \nfunctions .  \n1.4. For the purpose of this framework, 'outsourcing' is defined as use of a third party  (i.e. \nservice provider)  to perform activities on a continuing basis t hat would normally be \nundertaken by the PSO itself, now or in the future. \u2018Continuing basis \u2019 would include \nagreements for a limited period.  \n1.5. The term \u2018service provider\u2019 includes , but is not limited to,  vendors, payment gateways, \nagents, consultants and / or their representatives that are engaged in the activity of \npayment and / or settlement systems.  It also includes sub- contractors (i.e., secondary \nservice providers) to whom the primary service providers may further outsource whole or part of some activity related to payment and settlement system activities outsourced \nby the PSO . \n1.6. This framework is applicable to a service provider , whether  located in India or \nelsewhere.  \n1.7. The servic e provider, unless it is  a group company of the PSO, shall not be owned or \ncontrolled by any director or officer of the PSO or their relatives; the terms  \u2013 control, \ndirector,  officer and relative \u2013 have the same meaning as assigned to them under the \nCompanies Act, 2013.  \n1.8. Outsourcing process is associated with several risks ; following is an illustrative list of \nsuch risks:  \n                                                           \n1 As per the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, a \u201csystem provider\u201d means a person who \noperates an authorised payment system.  The terms  \u2018Provider\u2019 and \u2018Operator\u2019 have been used \ninterchangeably in this framework . \n \n2 The word \u201ccustomer\u201d wherever used in this framework includes the end- user, i.e., general public, who \nuses the payment system product(s). Further, customer data / information includes payments -related \ndata / information also.   \n \n a) Compliance Risk \u2013  Where p rivacy, c ustomer / consumer  and prudential laws are \nnot adequately complied with by the service provider ; \nb) Concentration and Systemic Risk \u2013  Where  the overall industry has considerable \nexposure to one service provider  and hence, individual  PSO  may lack control over \nthe service provider;  \nc) Contractual Risk \u2013  Where the PSO  may not have the ability to enforce the contract ; \nd) Country Risk \u2013  When political, social or legal climate creates added risk ; \ne) Cyber Security risk \u2013 Where breach in IT systems may lead to potential loss of \ndata, information, reputation, money, etc.;  \nf) Exit Strategy Risk \u2013 When over -reliant on one firm , the PSO  loses related skills \ninternally , and it becomes  difficult to  bring  the activity back in- house ; and where the \nPSO  has entered into contracts that makes  speedy exit prohibitively expensive;  \ng) Legal Risk \u2013 Where the PSO  is subjected to fines, penalties, or punitive damages \nresulting from supervisory actions, as well as to private settlements due to acts of \nomission and commission by the service provider ; \nh) Operational Risk  \u2013 Arising due to technology failure, fraud, error, inadequate \nfinancial capacity to fulfil obligations and / or to provide remedies ; \ni) Reputation Risk \u2013 Where t he service provided is poor and customer interaction is \ninconsistent with the overall standard expected from the PSO; and  \nj) Strategic Risk \u2013  Where the service provider conducts busi ness on its own behalf, \ninconsistent with the overall strategic goals of the PSO.  \n1.9. It is essential that the PSO , which is outsourcing its activities, ensures the following : \na) Exercises due diligence, puts in place sound and responsive risk management \npractices for effective oversight, and manages the risks arising from such \noutsourcing of activities.  \nb) Outsourcing arrangements  do not  impede its effective supervision by RBI.  \n1.10.  Outsourcing of activities by the PSOs shall  not require prior approval from  RBI.  \n \n2. Activities that shall not be outsourced  \n2.1. The PSO s shall not outsource core management functions3, including risk \nmanagement  and internal audit; compliance and decision- making functions such as \ndetermining compliance with KYC norms . However, while internal audit function itself \n                                                           \n3 Core management functions  should include,  but not be confined to, management of payment system \noperations (netting, settlement , etc.); transaction management (reconciliation, reporting and item \nprocessing); according sanction to merchants for acquiring ; managing customer  data;  risk \nmanagement ; information technology  & information security management ; etc. \n  \n \n is a management process, the auditors for this purpose can be appointed by the PSO \nfrom its own employees or from the outside on contract.  \n \n3. Criticality of outsourcing \n3.1. The PSO  shall carefully evaluate the need f or outsourcing its critical processes and \nactivities , as also selection of service provider (s) based on comprehensive risk \nassessment. The critical processes are those,  which  if disrupted , shall have the \npotential to significantly impact the business operations, reputation, profitability and / \nor customer service.  \n \n4. PSO \u2019s role and regulatory and s upervisory requirements  \n4.1. Outsourcing of any activity by the PSO  shall not reduce its obligations , and those of its \nboard and senior management, who are ultimate ly responsible  for the outsourced \nactivity. The PSO  shall, therefore , be liable for the actions of its service provider s and \nshall retain ultimate control over  the outsourced activity.  \n4.2. The PSO , while exercising due diligence in respect of  outsourcing, shall consider all \nrelevant laws, regulations, guidelines and conditions of authorisation / approval, \nlicensing or registration.  \n4.3. Outsourcing arrangements shall not affect the rights of a customer  of a payment \nsystem  against the PSO , as well as those of a payment system participant against the \nPSO, including her / his ability to avail grievance redressal as applicable under the \nrelevant laws. Responsibility of addressing the grievances of its customers shall rest \nwith the PSO, including in respect of the services provided by the outsourced agency (i.e., service provider).  \n4.4. A PSO, which has outsourced its customer grievance redressal function, m ust also \nprovide its customers the option of direct access to its nodal officials for raising and / \nor escalating complaints. Such access should be enabled through adequate phone  \nnumbers, e -mail ids, postal address, etc., details of which shall be displayed \nprominently on its website, mobile application s, advertisements, etc. , and adequate \nawareness shall also be creat ed about the availability of this recourse .  \n4.5. If the customer is required  to have an interface with the service provider to avail \nproducts of  the PSO , then the P SO shall state the same through the  product literature  \n/ brochure, etc. , and also indicate therein the role of such service provider . \n4.6. A PSO must ensure that outsourcing does not  impede or interfere with the ability of the \nPSO  to effectively oversee and manage its activities ; nor does it prevent  RBI from \ncarrying out its supervisory functions and objectives.  \n \n  \n \n 5. Outsourcing  policy  \n5.1.  To outsource any of its payment and settlement -related activities , the PSO shall have \na board- approved comprehensive outsourcing policy, which incorporates, inter -alia, \ncriteria for selection of such activities and service providers ; parameters for grading \nthe criticality of outsourcing; delegation of authority depending on risks and criticality ; \nand, systems to monitor and review the operation of these activities.  \n \n6. Role of the b oard  and responsibilities of the senior management  \n6.1. Role of the b oard  \nThe board of the PSO , or a committee of the board to which  powers have been \ndelegated , shall be responsible,  inter-alia, for the following : \na) approving a framework to evaluate the risks and criticality  of all existing and \nprospective outsourcing;  \nb) approving policies that apply to outsourcing arrangements;  \nc) mapping appropriate approval authorities for outsourcing depending on risks and \ncriticality ; \nd) setting up suitable administrative mechanism of  senior management  for the \npurpose of this framework ; \ne) undertaking periodic review of outsourcing policy, strategies and arrangements for \ntheir continued relevance , safety and soundness;  \nf) deciding on business activities to be outsourced and approving suc h \narrangements ; and \ng) compl ying with regulatory instructions.  \n \n6.2. Responsibilities of the senior management  \nThe senior management shall be responsible for : \na) evaluating the risks and criticality  of all existing and prospective outsourcing, based \non the framework approved by the b oard;  \nb) developing  and implement ing sound and prudent outsourcing policies and \nprocedures commensurate with the nature, scope and complexity of the outsourcing activity;  \nc) review ing periodically the effectiveness of policies and procedures , and for \nidentify ing new outsourcing risks as they ar ise; \nd) communicat ing, in a timely manner, to the b oard any information related to \noutsourcing risk s; \ne) ensuring that contingency plans, based on realistic and probable disruptive \nscenarios, are in place and tested periodically;  and \nf) ensuring an independent review and audit for compliance with the set policies.   \n \n 6.3. A central  record of all outsourcing arrangements shall be maintained and it shall be \nreadily accessible for review by the b oard and senior management of the PSO . The \nrecord shall be  updated promptly, and half yearly review s shall be placed before the \nboard or its senior management.  \n \n7. Evaluating capability of the s ervice provider  \n7.1. While considering /  renewing an outsourcing arrangement , the PSO  shall include  \nissues related to undue concentration of such  arrangements  with a service provider . \n \n8. Outsourcing  agreement  \n8.1. The terms and conditions governing the contract between the PSO  and the service \nprovider shall be carefully defined in written agreement s and vetted  by PSO\u2019s legal \ncounsel  for their legal effect and enforceability. Every such agreement shall address \nthe risks and the strategies for mitigati ng them . The agreement  shall be sufficiently  \nflexib le to allow the PSO  to retain adequate  control over the outsou rced activity  and \nthe right to intervene with appropriate measures to meet legal and regulatory \nobligations. The agreement shall also bring out the nature of legal relationship between \nthe parties , i.e. whether agent, principal or otherwise. Some of the key provisions of \nthe agreement  should incorporate the following:  \na) defin ing activit y to be outsourced , includ ing appropriate service and performance \nstandards;  \nb) having access by the PSO to all books, records and information relevant to the \noutsourced activity , available with the service provider;  \nc) providing  for continuous monitoring and assessment by the PSO  of the service \nprovider , so that any necessary corrective measure can be taken immediately;  \nd) including termination clause and minimum period to execute such provision, if \ndeemed necessary;  \ne) ensur ing controls are in place for  maintaining  confidentiality of customer data and \nincorporating service provider \u2019s liability in case of breach of security and leakage \nof such  information related to customer s; \nf) incorporating contingency plan( s) to ensure business continuity;  \ng) requir ing prior approval / consent of  the PSO  for use of sub- contractors by the \nservice provider for all or part of an outsourced activity;  \nh) retaining PSO\u2019 s right to conduct audit of the service provider , whether by its  internal \nor external auditors, or by agents appointed to act on its behalf , and to obtain copies \nof any audit or review reports and findings made about  the service provider in \nconjunction with the services performed for the  PSO ;  \n \n i) adding  clauses to allow RBI or person( s) authorised by it to access the PSO 's \ndocuments, record of transactions and other necessary information given to, stored \nor processed by the service provider , within a reasonable time;  \nj) keeping clauses  to recognise the right of  RBI to cause an inspection to be made of \na service provider of a PSO  and the books of account s, by one or more of its \nofficers or employees or other persons ; \nk) requiring clauses relating to a clear obligation on any service provider to comply \nwith directions given by RBI insofar as they involve activities of the PSO ; \nl) maintaining  confidentiality of customer's information even after the agreement  \nexpires or gets terminated;  and \nm) preser ving documents and data by the service provider in accordance with legal / \nregulatory obligations  of the PSO , and the PSO \u2019s interests in this regard shall be \nprotected even after termination of the services.  \n \n9. Confidentiality  and security  \n9.1. Public confidence and customer trust in the PSO  is a prerequisite for its  stability and \nreputation.  PSO  shall ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information \nin the custody or possession of the service provider.  \n9.2. Access to customer information by staff of the service provider shall be on 'need to \nknow' basis , i.e., limited to areas where the information is required to perform the \noutsourced function.  \n9.3. The service provider shall be able to isolate and clearly identify the PSO 's customer \ninformation, documents, records and assets to protect their confidentiality. Where the \nservice provider acts as an outsourcing agent for multiple PSO s, there should be  strong \nsafeguards  (including encryption of customer data)  to avoid co-mingling of information , \ndocuments, records and assets  of different PSOs . \n9.4. The PSO  shall regularly review and monitor the security practices  and control \nprocesses of the service provider and require the service provider to disclose security  \nbreaches.  \n9.5. The PSO  shall immediately notify  RBI about  any breach of security and leakage of \nconfidenti al information related to customer s. In such eventualities, the PSO  would be \nliable to its  customers for any damage.  \n9.6. The PSO shall ensure that the extant  instructions related to storage of payment system \ndata shall be strictly adhered to by service provider , domestic or off -shore .  \n \n10. Responsibi lities  of Direct Sales Agents (DSA s) / Direct Marketing Agents (DMA s)  \n10.1.  The PSO s shall ensure that the DSA s / DMA s are properly trained to handle their \nresponsibilities with care and sensitivity, particularly for aspects such as soliciting  \n \n customers, hours of calling, privacy of customer information,  conveying the correct \nterms and conditions of the products on offer, etc.  \n10.2.  The PSO s shall put in place a board-approved code of conduct for DSA s / DMA s and \nobtain their undertaking to abide by the same . \n \n11. Business continuity and m anagement of d isaster recovery plan \n11.1.  Service provider shall develop and establish a robust framework for documenting, \nmaintaining and testing business continuity and recovery procedures  arising out of any \noutsourced activity . The PSO  shall ensure that the service provider periodically tests \nthe business continuity and r ecovery plans, and shall also consider conducting \noccasional joint exercises for testing of business continuity and recovery procedures \nwith its service provider.  \n11.2.  To mitigate risk of unexpected termination of the outsourcing agreement or liquidation \nof the service provider, the PSO  shall retain adequate control over its  outsourcing and \nshall have the right to intervene with appropriate measures to continue its business \noperations  and its services to the customers in such cases without incurring prohibitive \nexpenses  or any break in i ts operations and services to the customers . \n11.3.  As part of contingency plan, the PSO  shall consider the availability of alternative \nservice provider (s), as well as  the possibility of bringing the outsourced activity back \nin-house in an emergency and assess the cost, time and resources that would be \ninvolved.  \n11.4.  The PSO 's information, documents and records, and other assets  shall be isolable by \nthe service provider. This is to ensure that in appropriate situations, all documents, \nrecord of transactions and information given to the service provider, and assets of the \nPSO, can be removed from the possession of the service provider in order to continue its business operations, or deleted, destroyed or rendered unusable.  \n \n12. Monitoring and control of o utsourced activities  \n12.1.  The PSO  shall put in place a management structure to monitor and control its \noutsourcing activities. It shall ensure that outsourcing agreement with the service provider contains provisions to address monitoring and control  by it of the outsourced \nactivities.  \n12.2.  Regular audit by either the internal or external auditors of the PSO sh all be conducted \nto assess the adequacy of the risk management practices adopted in overseeing and \nmanaging the outsourcing arrangement s and the PSO 's compliance with its risk \nmanagement framework.  \n12.3.  The PSO  shall, at least on an annual basis, review the financial and operational \nconditions of the service provider to assess its ability to fulfil its outsourcing obligations.  \n \n Such due diligence reviews shall highlight any deter ioration or breach in performance \nstandards, confidentiality and security, and in business continuity preparedness.  \n12.4.  In the event of termination of the outsourcing agreement  for any reason in cases where \nthe service provider deals with the customers, the same shall be given due publicity by \nthe PSO informing the customers so as to ensure that they stop dealing with the \nconcerned service provider.  \n12.5.  Certain cases like outsourcing of cash management , may involve reconciliation of \ntransactions between the PSO, the service provider and its sub -contractors, if any. In \nsuch cases, PSO shall ensure that this reconciliation process is carried out in a timely \nmanner.  \n12.6.  A robust system of internal audit of all outsourced activities shall be put in place and \nmonitored by the b oard of the PSO . \n \n13. Outsourcing  within a g roup / c onglomerate  \n13.1.  The PSO  could have back  office and service arrangements  / agreements with group \nentities ; for instance, sharing of premises, legal  and other professional services, \nhardware and software applications, centrali sed back  office functions, outsourcing \ncertain payment and settlement  services to other group entities, etc. Such \narrangements with group entities  shall be based on the PSO \u2019s board-approved policy \nand service level arrangements  / agreements with its  group entities . The agreements  \nshall cover demarcation of shar ed resources  like premises, personnel, etc. Wherever \nthere are multiple group entities involved or any cross -selling is observed,  the \ncustomers shall be informed about the actual company  / entity  offering the product  / \nservice.  \n13.2.  The PSO  shall ensure that such arrangements : \na) are appropriately documented in written agreements with details like scope of \nservices, charges for services and maintaining confidentiality of customer's data;  \nb) do not cause any confus ion among  customers as to  whose products / services they \nare availing , by clear physical demarcation of the site of activities of different group \nentities;  \nc) do not compromis e ability of the PSO  to identify and manage risk s on a standalone \nbasis;  and \nd) do not prevent RBI from being able to obtain information required for supervision \nof the PSO  or pertaining to the group as a whol e. \n13.3.  The PSO  shall ensure that its ability to carry out operations in a sound fashion is not \naffected if premises or other services (such as IT systems  and support staff) provided \nby the group entities become unavailable.   \n \n 13.4.  If sharing of premises is done with the group entities for cross -selling, the PSO shall \ntake measures to ensure that the entity's identification is distinctly  visible and clear to \nthe customers. Any communication by group entit ies (marketing brochure, verbal \ncommunication by  staff / agent, etc.)  in the PSO \u2019s premises shall mention nature of \narrangement of the entit ies with the PSO , so that customers are clear about  the seller \nof the product.  \n13.5.  The PSO \u2019s advertisement or any agreement shall not give any overt or tacit impression \nthat it is in any way responsible for the obligations of its group entities.  \n13.6.  The risk management practices to be adopted by the PSO  while outsourcing to a \nrelated party (i.e. party within the group / conglomerate) shall be identical to those \nspecified above in this framework for a non -related party . \n \n14. Additional requirements for off -shore outsourcing  \n14.1.  The engagement of a service provider in a foreign country exposes the PSO  to country \nrisk. To manage such  country risk, the  PSO  shall closely monitor government policies \nand, political, social, economic and legal conditions in countries where the service \nprovider is based, both during the risk assessment process and on a continuous basis , \nand establish sound procedures for dealing with country risk problems. This includes \nhaving appropriate contingency and exit strategies. In principle,  arrangements shall \nonly be entered into with parties operating in jurisdictions generally upholding \nconfidentiality clauses and agreements. The gov erning law of the arrangement shall \nalso be clearly specified.  \n14.2.  The activities outsourced outside India shall be conducted in a manner so as not to hinder efforts to supervise or reconstruct the India activities of the PSO  in a timely \nmanner.  \n14.3.  As regards  off-shore outsourcing of its services relating to Indian operations, the PSO  \nshall ensure t he following:  \na) The off -shore regulator regulating the off -shore service provider shall neither \nobstruct the arrangement nor object to RBI \u2019s visit(s)  for audit / scrutiny / \nexamination / inspection / assessment or visit(s) by PSO \u2019s internal and external \nauditors ; \nb) The regulatory authority of the off -shore location does not have access to the data \nrelating to Indian operations of the PSO simply on the gr ound that the processing \nis being undertaken there (not applicable if off -shore processing is done in the \nhome country of the PSO) ; and \nc) The jurisdiction of the courts in the off -shore location where data is process ed, does \nnot extend to the operations of the PSO  in India on the strength of the fact that the  \n \n data is being processed there even though the actual transactions are undertaken \nin India.  \n                                             \n15. Members  / Participants of payment systems operated by  the PSOs  \n15.1.  In some payment systems  operated by the PSOs , there  could be other members /  \nparticipants  also.

Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and \nNational Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT)  systems, in a phased manner.  A reference \nis also invited to the Master Directions on Access Criteria for Payment Systems  dated \nJanuary 17, 2017  wherein Reserve Bank  had prescribed criteria for access to CPS.  \n2.Direct access for non-b anks to CPS lower s the overall risk in the payments  \necosystem. It also brings advantages to non-b anks like reduction in cost of payments,  \nminimising dependence on banks, reducing the tim e taken for completing payments,  \neliminating the uncertainty in finality of the payments as the settlement is carried out  \nin central bank  money, etc. The risk of failure or delay in exec ution of fund transfers  \ncan also be avoided when the transactions are directly initiated and processed by the  \nnon-b ank entities.\n3.On a review of extant arrangements and after detailed discussions with Payment  \nSystem Providers (PSPs), it is advised that, in the first phase, authorised no n-bank \nPSPs,  viz. PPI Issuers, Card Networks and White Label ATM Operators shall be  \neligible to partic ipate in CPS as direct members as per the approach presented in the  \nAnnexure hereto.2 \n  \n4. The  Master Direction s on Access Criteria for Payment Systems dated January 17, \n2017  are also being modified accordingly. For operational and user convenience, \nReserve Bank has placed a set of FAQs  on the subject on its website.  \n5. These instructions are issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment \nand Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007)  and come into effect  from the date \nof this circular . \nYours faithfully,  \n \n (P Vasudevan)  \nChief General Manager   \n Annexure to Circular Ref.DPSS .CO.LVPD No. S290/ 04.04.009/ 2021- 22 \ndated July 28, 2021 \n \nAccess for Non- banks to Centralised Payment Systems \n \nContents \n \n1 Background  .......................................................................................................................................... 1 \n2 Direct Access for Non -banks to CPS  ..................................................................................................... 2 \n2.1 Meaning of Direct Access to CPS  .................................................................................................. 2 \n2.2 Benefits of Dire ct Access  ............................................................................................................... 2 \n3 Eligibility  ............................................................................................................................................... 3 \n3.1 Entities  .......................................................................................................................................... 3 \n3.2 Criteria  ........................................................................................................................................... 4 \n3.3 Membership Type and Nature of Transactions  ............................................................................ 5 \n4 Operational Aspects  ............................................................................................................................. 6 \n4.1 Process of Applying for Direct Access to CPS by Non -banks  ......................................................... 6 \n4.2 Other Operational Aspects  ........................................................................................................... 7 \n \n1 Background \n1.1 Centralised Payment Systems (CPS) in India are Real Time Gross Settlement \n(RTGS) and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system s, both owned and \noperated by Reserve Bank. As part of its drive to encourage moving towards digital payments, Reserve Bank has been continuously taking measures to improve the \npayment ecosystem in general , and CPS in particular. The NEFT and RTGS systems \nwere made available 24x7 x365 with effect from December 2019 and December 2020 \nrespectively.  \n1.2 One of the ways to provide impetus to digital payments is to extend the access to payment systems to more entities. This is also engaging the attention of other central \nbanks globally. Reserve Bank\u2019s Vision Document on Payment and Settlement Systems 20 19-2021 includes review of membership of CPS to enable access 2 \n neutrality between banks and non- banks and to develop a framework for settlement \nrisk management with increased participation of non- banks.  The document also refers \nto the need for a single national settlement account  for all authorised card networks . \n1.3 Apart from banks, very few select non- banks have been given approval to \nparticipate in CPS  so far . The non- bank s which are permitted membership / access to \nCPS are standalone primary dealers, clearing corporations of stock exchanges, \ncentral counter  parties, retail payment system organisations , select financial \ninstitutions (NABARD, EXIM Bank)  and DICGC.  \n1.4 Banks have been providing the services to non- banks for their payment and \nsettlement needs. However, if the bank , which provides payment services to  non-\nbanks, is impacted, it can cause business disruption to  the non- banks also. The \ndisruption, even if temporary, could have the potential to cause and spread instability \nin the system. Consequently, the customers of the non- banks, who are using their \nproducts and services, would also get affected.  \n2 Direct A ccess for Non-banks to CPS  \n2.1 Meaning of D irect Access to CPS  \n2.1.1 Allotment of  a separate Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) . \n 2.1.2 Opening a Current Account with  the Reserve Bank in its core banking system \n(e-Kuber ). \n 2.1.3 Maintaining a settlement account with the Reserve Bank.  \n 2.1.4 Membership of Indian Financial Network (INFI NET) and use of Structured \nFinancial Messaging S ystem (SFMS) to communicate with CPS.  \n \n2.2 Benefits of D irect Access  \n2.2.1  Efficiency : For non- banks, the cost of routing payments through banks can be \nminimised. The risk of failure or delay in execution of fund transfers can be eliminated \nif the transactions are directly initiated by non- banks.  3 \n 2.2.2 Competition and i nnovation: Non-banks increasingly and actively offer financial \nservices which hitherto were the sole domain of banks.  They  are seen to be agile in \ncoming up with innovative products and solutions as well . Direct access to CPS can \nfurther enable them to leverage technology to offer customised choices to consumers. \nThey can use their capabilities to assimilate and analyse data to support their \ninnovations and solutions. As non- banks compete in the same segment that banks \noperate, direct access can provide level playing field, minimising the need to use \nintermediaries.  \n2.2.3 Risk management and stability : As the settlement is carried out in central bank \nmoney, it greatly reduces the uncertainty in finality of the payments and settlement \nrisk.  Expanding the access and participation facilitates diversity and resiliency of the ecosystem.  \n \n2.2.4 Data  protection: Direct access to CPS  can enable the non- banks to safeguard \ncustomer information and fund flows, which may not be possible when using banks to provide payment servic es. \n \n3 Eligib ility \n3.1 Entities  \n3.1.1 Non- banks include entities like P ayment System Providers  (PSPs) and Non-\nBanking Financial Companies (NBFCs) that are regulated by Reserve Bank as also \nentities that are under the remit of other financial sector regulators like PFRDA, IRDAI, \nSEBI, etc.    3.1.2 To start with, access to non- banks in CPS will be enabled in a phased manner. \nIn the first phase, only the following authorised non- bank  PSPs  shall be provided \naccess \u2013 \ni. Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) I ssuers ; \nii. Card Network s; and \niii. White Label ATM Operators.  \n 4 \n 3.2 Criteria   \n3.2.1 Eligibility for non -bank access to CPS shall be as per the criteria prescribed by \nReserve Bank.  \n 3.2.2 For access to CPS the non -bank PSPs  shall fulfil the following criteria:  \ni.

Thereafter, while arriving at net amount of inter -\nbranch trans actions for inclusion under 'Other Liabilities and \nProvisions' if in credit, or 'Other Assets' if in debit, the aggregate \namount of 'Blocked Account' should be excluded and only the \namount representing the remaining credit entries should be netted \nagainst debit entries. Thus, the balance in the 'Blocked Account' will \nbe reckoned for the purpose of maintenance of CRR and SLR, even though the net of inter -branch entries is a debit balance.  \n \n(ii) Margin Money on Bills Discounted / Purchased  \n The bank should follow uniform procedure in treating margin money on bills \npurchased/discounted as outside liabilities and should include it in other \ndemand and time liabilities for the purpose of maintenance of reserve requirements.  \n (iii) Interest Accrued on Deposits  \n(a) The interest ac crued on all deposit accounts (such as, savings, \nfixed, recurring, cash certificates, reinvestment plans, etc.), by whatever name called, should be treated by the bank as its liability \nfor the purpose of maintaining CRR and SLR irrespective of \nwhether the accrued interest has become actually payable or is not \npayable till due dates for repayment of deposits.  \n(b) The interest accrued on deposits should be classified under 'Other Demand and Time Liabilities'  \n \n  ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/80MD21389A0318704E99835FC3013AA49E9A.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jul 14, 2021", "info": " \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\ufffd\u0915  \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA  \nwww.rbi.org.in  \n\u092e\u0941\ufffd\u093e \ufffd\u092c\u0902\u0927 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , 4\u0925\u093e \u0924\u0932 , \u0905\u092e\u0930 \u092d\u0935\u0928 , \u092a\u0940.\u090f\u092e . \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 400001  \n \nDepartment  of Currency Management , 4th Floor, Amar Building, P.M.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), UK has announced on  March 05, \n2021 that LIBOR will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be a \nrepresentative rate: \n(a) Immediately after Dec ember  31, 2021, in the case of all Po und sterling, Euro, \nSwiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the 1- week and 2- month US dollar \nsettings; and  \n(b) Immediately  after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining US dollar settings . \n2. With the objective of  orderly, safe and sound LIBOR transition and c onsidering \ncustomer protection, reputational and litigation risk s involved , banks  / financial institutions  \nare encouraged to cease , and also encourage their customers to cease,  entering into \nnew financial contracts that reference LIBOR as a benchmark  and instead use any widely   \n \naccepted ARR, as soon as practicable and in any case by December  31, 2021 . While \ncertain US dollar LIBOR settings will continue to be published till June 30, 2023, the \nextension of the timeline for cessation is primarily aimed at ensuring roll -off of USD \nLIBOR -linked legacy contracts, and not to encourage continued reliance on LIBOR. It is, \ntherefore, expected that contracts referencing LIBOR may generally be undertaken after \nDecember 31, 2021, only for the purpose of managing risk s arising out of LIBOR contracts  \n(e.g. hedging contracts, novation, market -making in support of client activity, etc.) , \ncontracted on or before December 31, 2021.  \n3.   Banks/financial institutions are urged to incorporate robust fallback clauses , preferably \nwell before the respective cessation dates,  in all financial contracts that reference LIBOR \nand the maturity of which is after  the announced cessation date of the respective LIBOR \nsettings. Banks/financial institutions are encouraged to ensure that new contracts entered \ninto before December 31, 2021 that reference LIBOR and maturity of which is after the date on which LIBOR ceases or become non- representative include fallback  clauses.  \nBanks /financial institutions  may refer to the standard fallback clauses developed for this \npurpose by various agencies such as International Swaps and Derivatives Association, \nIndian Banks\u2019 Association,  Loan Markets\u2019 Association, Asia Pacific Loan Markets \nAssociation and Bankers Association for Finance & Trade.   \n4.  Banks  are also encouraged to cease using th e Mumbai Interbank Forward Outright  \nRate (MIFOR), published by the Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd (FBIL), which references the LIBOR as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. \nFBIL has started publishing daily adjusted MIFOR  rates from June 15,  2021 and modified \nMIFOR  rates from June 30,  2021 which can be used for legacy contracts and fresh \ncontracts respectively .  Banks may trade in MIFOR after December 31, 2021 only for \ncertain specific purposes such as transactions executed to support risk management activities such as hedging, required participation in central counterparty procedures  \n(including transactions for hedging the consequent MIFOR exposure) , market -making in \nsupport of client activities or novation of MIFOR transactions in respect of transactions \nexecuted on or before December 31, 2021.   \n \n5.  Banks / financial institutions must undertake a co mprehensive review of all direct and \nindirect LIBOR exposures and put in place a framework to mitigate risks arising from such \nexposures on account of transitional issues including valuation and contractual clauses . \nThey may also put in place the necessary  infrastructure to be able to offer products \nreferencing the ARR. Continued efforts to sensitise clients about the transition as well as \nthe methodology and convention changes involved in the alternatives to LIBOR  will be \ncritical in this context .  \n6.  The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor the evolving  global and domestic  situation  \nwith regard to the transition  away from LIBOR  and proactively tak e steps , as necessary , \nto mitigate associated risks in order to ensure a smooth transition.  \n \nYours  sincerely ,  \n \n(Dimple Bhandia ) \nChief General Manager  \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/LIBOR4B79B1870D234E3FACC2EE378D8F6F84.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jul 08, 2021", "info": "                                                                     \n                                                        \n\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928  \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , \u0915\ufffd \ufffd\u0940\u092f  \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f , 5\u0935\ufffd  \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932 , \u0905\u092e\u0930  \u092d\u0935\u0928 ,  \u0938\u0930 \u092a\u0940 \u090f\u092e \u0930\u094b\u0921 , \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908-400001  \n                            Department of Regulation , Central Office,  5th floor, Amar Building, Sir P.M.Road, Mumbai -400001  \n\u091f\u0947\u0932\u0940\u092b\u094b\u0928 /Tel No:022- 22603000  Email ID: returnsco@rbi.org.in  \n \n \n  \n \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f  \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d  \u092c\ufffd\u0915  \n     _____________ RESERVE BANK OF INDIA _____ _________ __ \nwww.rbi.org.in   \n \nRBI/20 21-22/68  \nDoR.RET.REC.30 /12.07.150/20 21-22                           July 0 7, 2021  \n \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks  \n  \nDear Sir /Madam  \n \nInclusion of \u201cShivalik Small Finance  Bank  Limited \u201d in the Second Schedule \nof the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 \n    \n \nWe advise that \u201cShivalik Small Finance  Bank  Limited\u201d has been included in the \nSecond Schedule to the Reserve Bank of India Ac t, 1934 vide Notification \nDoR.LIC.(Shivalik SFB).

While it is entirely the banks \u2019 prerogative to take a view on the desirability of \noutsourcing a permissible activity having regard to all relevant factors, including the \ncommercial aspects of the decision, such outsourcing results in banks being exposed to \nvarious risks. To enable t he co-operative banks to put in place necessary safeguards for \naddressing the risks inherent in outsourcing of activities , guidelines on managing risks in \noutsourcing are given in Annex\n.  \n3. Co-operative banks are advised to conduc t a self -assessment of their existing \noutsourcing arrangement s and bring the same in line with these guidelines within a \nperiod of six months from the date of issue of this circular.  \nYours faithfully  \n \n(Sunil T. S. Nair ) \nChief General Manager   \n1 \n Annex  \nGuideli nes on Managing Risks in Outsourcing of Financial services  by Co -\noperative Banks  \nIntroduction  \n1.1 'Outsourcing' is defined as use of a third party to perform activities on a continuing \nbasis that would normally be undertaken by a co- operative bank itself,  now or in the \nfuture. 'Continuing  basis' would include agreements for a limited period.  \n1.2 These guidelines are intended to provide direction and guidance to co -operative \nbanks to adopt sound and responsive risk management practices for effective oversig ht, \ndue diligence and management of risks arising from outsourcing activities.  \n1.3 The underlying principles behind these guidelines are that the co -operative bank  \nshould ensure that outsourcing arrangements neither diminish its ability to fulfil its \nobligations to customers and RBI, nor impede effective supervision by R eserve Bank of \nIndia (RBI)/ National Bank for Agriculture and Development ( NABARD)1. Co-operative \nbanks, therefore, have to take steps to ensure that the service provider employs the same high standard of care in performing the services as would be employed by them , if \nthe activities were conducted by the banks and not outsourced. Accordingly, co -\noperative banks should not engage in outsourcing that would result in their internal \ncontrol, business conduct or reputation being compromised or weakened.  \n1.4 These guidelines are concerned with managing risks in outsourcing of financial \nservices and are not applicable to technology -related issues as also activities not \nrelated to financial services like usage of courier, catering of staff, housekeeping and \njanitorial services, security of the premises, movement and archiving of records , etc. \nCo-operative banks  which desire to outsource would not require prior approval from RBI  \n/ NABARD. However, suc h arrangements would be subject to on- site / off- site \nmonitoring and inspection/scrutiny by RBI  / NABARD.  \n                                                 \n1 Reserve Bank of India i s the supervisor for Primary (Urban) Co -operative Banks. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment is the supervisor for State Co -operative Banks and Central Co -operative Banks.  The word \u2018RBI/NABARD\u2019 \nmentioned in these guidelines may be interpret ed in relation to the relevant supervising authority of co -operative banks.   \n2 \n 2. Activities that shall  not be outsourced  \nCo-operative banks  which choose to outsource financial services , however , shall not \noutsource core managem ent functions including policy formulation, internal audit and \ncompliance , compliance with KYC norms, credit  sanction and management of \ninvestment portfolio. However, where required, experts, including former employees, \ncould be hired on a contractual basi s subject to the Audit Committee of Board/Board \nbeing assured that such expertise does not exist within the audit function of the bank. Any conflict of interest in such matters shall be recognised and effectively addressed. Ownership of audit reports in al l cases shall rest with regular functionaries of the internal \naudit function.  \n3. Material Outsourcing \nDuring inspections / scrutinies , RBI / NABARD will review the implementation of these \nguidelines to assess the quality of related risk management systems particularly in \nrespect of material outsourcing. Material outsourcing arrangements  are those, which if \ndisrupted, have the potential to significantly impact the business operations, reputation \nor profitability  of co- operative banks . Materiality of outsourci ng would be based on: - \ni. The level of importance to the co-operative bank of the activity being outsourced  \nas well as the significance of the risk posed by the same ; \nii. The potential impact of the outsourcing by  the co-operative bank on various \nparameters such as earnings, solvency, liquidity, funding capital and risk profile;  \niii. The likely impact on the co -operative bank\u2019s reputation and brand value, and \nability to achieve its business objectives, strategies  and plans, should the service \nprovider fail to perform t he service;  \niv. The cost of the outsourcing as a proportion of total operating costs of the co-\noperative bank;  \nv. The aggregate exposure to that particular service provider, in cases where the co-operative bank out sources various functions to the same service provider;  \nvi. The significance of activities outsourced in context of customer service and protection.   \n3 \n  4. Co-operative bank's role  \n4.1 The outsourcing of any activity by a co- operative bank does not diminish its \nobligations, and those of its Board and CEO along  with the M anagement, who have the \nultimate responsibility for the outsourced activity. Co -operative banks  shall,  therefore,  \nbe responsible for the actions of their service provider including actions of the B usiness \nCorrespondent s and their retail outlets / sub- agents and the confidentiality of \ninformation pertaining to the customers that is available with the service provider. The \nbank shall retain ultimate control of the outsourced activity.  \n4.2 The co-operative bank s shall consider all relevant laws, regulations, guidelines and \nconditions of approval, licensing or registration when performing its due diligence in relation to outsourcing.  \n4.3 The grievance redressal mechanism of co- operative banks should not  be \ncompromised on account of outsourcing.  Outsourcing arrangements shall not affect the \nrights of a customer against the co-operative bank, including the ability of the customer s \nto redress  their grievances  as applicable under relevant laws . \n4.4 Outsourcing shall not impede or interfere with the ability  of a co-operative bank to \neffectively oversee and manage its activities nor should it impede RBI / NABARD in carrying out its supervisory functions  and objectives . \n4.5 The service provider should not be owned or controlled by any director or \nofficer/emplo yee of the co -operative bank or their relatives having the same meaning as \nassigned under the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules framed thereunder  from time to \ntime.  \n5. Risk Management practices for outsourcing \n5.1 Outsourcing Policy  \nA co-operative bank  intending to outsource any of its financial activities sh all put in \nplace a comprehensive outsourcing policy, approved by its Board, which incorporates, \ninter alia, criteria for selection of such activities as well as service providers, parameters for definin g material outsourcing based on the broad criteria indicated in para 3, \ndelegation of authority depending on risks and materiality and systems to monitor and  \n4 \n review the operations of these activities.  \n5.2 Role of the Board of Directors (Board) , and CEO along with the Senior \nManagement  \n5.2.1 The Board,  and CEO  along with the Senior Management  shall be ultimately \nresponsi ble for outsourcing operations  and for managing risks inherent in such \noutsourcing relationships. The Board and CEO along with the M anagement  shall have \nthe responsibility to institute an effective governance mechanism and risk management \nprocess for all outsourced operations . \nThe Board shall be responsible,  inter alia , for: - \ni. Approving a framework to evaluate the risks and materiality of all  existing and \nprospective outsourcing and the policies that apply to such arrangements;  \nii. Laying down appropriate approval authorities for outsourcing dep ending on risks \nand materiality;  \niii. Undertaking regular review of the framework for its efficacy and update the same \nto ensure that the outsourcing strategies and arrangements have continued \nrelevance,  effectiveness,  safety and soundness;  \niv. Deciding on business activities of a m aterial nature to be outsourced and \napproving such arrangements;  \nv. Assessment of management competencies to develop sound and responsive outsourcing risk management policies and procedures commensurate with the nature, scope, and complexity of outsourcing arrangements ; and \nvi. Setting up suitable administrative framework of management for the purpose of these guidelines.  \n5.2.2 Chief Executive Office r (CEO ) and Senior Management of the bank  shall be \nresponsible for:  \ni. Evaluating the risks and materiality of all existing and prospective outsourcing, based on the framework approved by the Board;  \nii. Devel oping and implementing sound and prudent procedures commensurat e with  \n5 \n the nature, scope and complexity of the outsourcing;  \niii. Reviewing periodically the effectiveness of policies and procedures;  \niv. Communicating information pertaining to material outsourcing ris ks to the Board \nin a timely manner;  \nv. Ensuring that contingency plans, based on realistic and probable disruptive \nscenarios, are in place and tested;  \nvi. Ensuring that there is independent review and audit for compliance with set policies ; and \nvii. Undertaking periodic review of outsourcing arrangements to identify new material outsourcing risks.  \n5.3 Evaluation of the Risks  \nThe indicative key risks in outsourcing that need to be evaluated by the co -operative \nbanks are: - \ni. Strategic Risk \u2013 The service provider may conduct business on its own behalf, \nwhich is inconsistent with the overall strategic goals of the bank.  \nii. Reputation Risk - Poor service from the service provider, its customer \ninteraction not being consistent with the overall standards of the bank , or failure \nin preservation and protection of confidential customer information.  \niii. Compliance Risk - Privacy, consumer and prudential laws not adequately \ncomplied with.  \niv. Operational Risk \u2013 Arising due to technology failure, fraud, error, inadequate \nfinancial capacity to fulfil obligations and/or provide remedies.  \nv. Legal Risk - Includes but is not limited to exposure to fines, penalties, or punitive \ndamages resulting from supervisory actions, as well as private settlements due to omissions and commissions of the service provi der. \nvi. Exit Strategy Risk  - This could arise from over -reliance on one firm, the loss of \nrelevant skills in the bank itself preventing it from bringing the activity back in-house and where the bank has entered into contracts wherein speedy exits would be prohibitively expensive.   \n6 \n vii. Counterparty Risk - Due to inappropriate underwriting or credit assessments.  \nviii. Contractual Risk \u2013 Arising from whether or not the bank has the ability to \nenforce the contract.  \nix. Country Risk - Due to political, social or legal climate cre ating added risk.  \nx. Concentration and Systemic Risk - Due to lack of control of individual banks \nover a service provider, more so when overall banking industry has considerable \nexposure to one service provider.  \n5.4 Evaluating the Capability of the Service Pr ovider  \n5.4.1 In considering or renewing an outsourcing arrangement, co -operative banks shall \nundertake appropriate due diligence to assess the capability of the service provider to \ncomply with obligations in the outsourcing agreement. Due diligence should take into \nconsideration qualitative, quantitative, financial, operational and reputational factors. Co-operative banks shall  consider whether the service providers \u2019 systems are \ncompatible with their own and also whether their standards of performance including in the area of customer service are acceptable to it. Co -operative banks shall also \nconsider, while evaluating the capability of the service provider, issues relating to undue concentration of outsourcing arrangements with a single service provider. W here \npossible, co-operative  bank s may obtain independent reviews and market feedback on \nthe service provider to supplement their  own findings.  \n5.4.2 Due diligence should involve an evaluation of all available information about the \nservice provider, includi ng but not limited to the following: - \na. Past experience, competence to implement and support the proposed activity \nover the contracted period;  \nb. Financial soundness and ability to service commitments even under adverse conditions;  \nc. Business reputation, culture, compliance, complaints and outstanding or potential \nlitigation;  \nd. Security, internal controls, audit  coverage, reporting, monitoring and business  \n7 \n continuity management ; \ne. External factors like political, economic, social and legal environment of the \njurisdic tion in which the service provider operates and other events that  may \nimpact service performance;  \nf. Ensuring due diligence by service provider of his employees ; and.  \ng. Ability to effectively service all the customer s with confidentiality where a service \nprovi der has exposure  to multiple banks.  \n5.5 The Outsourcing Agreement  \nThe terms and conditions governing the contract between a  co-operative bank and \nservice provider should be carefully defined in written agreements and vetted by bank \u2019s \nlegal counsel on thei r legal effect and enforceability. Every such agreement should \naddress the risks and risk mitigation strategies. The agreement should be sufficiently flexible to allow the bank to retain an appropriate level of control over the outsourcing and the right to intervene with appropriate measures to meet legal and regulatory \nobligations. The agreement should also bring out the nature of legal relationship \nbetween the parties, i.e., whether agent, principal or otherwise.  \nSome of the key provisions of the contract  would be:  \ni. The contract should clearly define the activities being outsourced including \nService Level Agreements (SLAs) to agree and establish accountability for performance expectations. SLAs must clearly formalize the performance criteria to measure the quality and quantity of service levels.   \nii. The co-operative bank shall ensure its ability to access all books, records and \ninformation relevant to the outsourced activity available with the service provider.   \niii. The contract should provide for continuous monitoring and assessment of the service provider by the co -operative bank so that any necessary corrective \nmeasure can be initiated  immediately.  \niv. Controls to ensure customer data confidentiality and service providers \u2019 liability in \ncase of breach of security and leakage of confidential customer related  \n8 \n information shall be incorporated.  \nv. A termination clause and notice period should be included.  \nvi. Contingency plans to ensure business continuity should be included.  \nvii. The contract should provide for the prior approval/consent of co- operative bank  \nfor use of subcontractors by the service provider for all or part of an outsourced \nactivity.  Before according the consent, co- operative banks should review the \nsubcontracting arrangement and ensure that these arrangements are com pliant \nwith the extant guidelines on outsourcing.  \nviii. The contract should provide the co -operative bank s with the right to conduct \naudits on the service provider whether by its internal or external auditors, or by \nagents appointed to act on its behalf and to obtain copies of any audit or review reports and findings made on the service provider in conjunction with the services performed for the co -operative bank.  \nix. Outsourcing agreement should include a clause to allow RBI/NABARD  or \npersons authorised by it to acc ess the co -operative bank \u2019s documents, records of \ntransactions, logs and other necessary information given to, stored or processed by the service provider , within a reasonable time.  This includes information \nmaintained in paper and electronic formats . \nx. Outs ourcing agreement should also include a clause to recognise the right of the \nRBI / NABARD to cause an inspection of a service provider of a co -operative \nbank and its books and account s by one or more of its officers or employees or \nother authorised persons . \nxi. The outsourcing agreement should also provide that confidentiality of customers\u2019 information should be maintained even after the contract expires or gets terminated.  Further, co- operative bank shall have necessary provisions to ensure \nthat the service pr ovider preserves documents as required by law and take \nsuitable steps to ensure that its interests are protected in this regard even post termination of the services.  \n  \n9 \n 5.6 Confidentiality and Security \n5.6.1 Public confidence and customer trust in co -operative bank is a prerequisite for the \nstability and reputation of the bank. Hence,  the co-operative bank s shall seek to ensure \nthe preservation and protection of the security and confidentiality of customer \ninformation in the custody of the service provider.  \n5.6.2 Access to customer information by staff of the service provider shall be on \u2018 need \nto know \u2019 basis , i.e., limited to those areas where the information is required in order to \nperform the outsourced function.  \n5.6.3 The co-operative bank s shall ensure t hat the service provider is able to isolate and \nclearly identify the co -operative bank \u2019s customer information, documents, records and \nassets to protect the confidentiality of the information. In the instances, where service \nprovider acts as an outsourcing agent for multiple banks, care should be taken to build adequate safeguards so that there is no comingling of information/documents, records \nand assets.  \n5.6.4 The co-operative bank s shall  review and monitor the security practices and control \nprocesses of t he service provider on a regular basis and require the service provider to \ndisclose security breaches.  \n5.6.5 The co-operative bank s shall immediately notify RBI / NABARD in the event of any \nbreach of security and leakage of confidential customer related information. In these eventualities, the co -operative bank shall be liable to its customers for any damage.  \n5.7 Business Continuity and Management of Disaster Recovery Plan  \n5.7.1 Co- operative bank s shall require its service providers to develop and establish a \nrobust framework for documenting, maintaining and testing business continuity and recovery procedures. Banks need to ensure that the service provider periodically tests the Business Continuity and Recovery Plan.  Banks  may also conduct joint testing and \nrecovery exercises with its service provider  at mutually agreed frequency but at least \nannually . \n5.7.2 In order to mitigate the risk of unexpected termination of the outsourcing \nagreement or liquidation of the service provider, co -operative banks shall  retain an  \n10 \n appropriate level of control over their outsourcing and the right to intervene with \nappropriate measures to continue its business operations in such cases without incurring prohibitive expenses and without any break in the operations of the bank and  \nits services to the customers.  \n5.7.3 In establishing a viable contingency plan, co -operative banks should consider the \navailability of alternative service providers or the possibility of bringing the outsourced activity back in -house  in an emergency and t he costs, time and resources that would be \ninvolved.  \n5.7.4 Co- operative banks to ensure that in adverse conditions  and/ or termination of the \ncontract , all documents, records of transactions and information given to the service \nprovider and assets of the bank can be removed from the possession of the service provider in order to enable the bank to continue its business operations ; or deleted, \ndestroyed or rendered unusable.  \n5.8 Monitoring and Control of Outsourced Activities  \n5.8.1 The co-operative bank s shall have in place a management structure to monitor \nand control their  outsourcing activities. It shall also  be ensured  that outsourcing \nagreements with the service provider contain provisions to address their monitoring and control of outsourced activities . \n5.8.2 A central record of all material outsourcing that is readily accessible for review by \nthe Board and CEO along with the m anagement of the co -operative bank shall  be \nmaintained. The records should be updated promptly and half yearly reviews should be  \nplaced before the Board.  \n5.8.3 Regular audits at least annually by either the internal auditors or external auditors \nof the bank should assess the adequacy of the risk management practices adopted in overseeing and managing the outsourcing arrangement, the bank \u2019s compliance with its \nrisk management framework and these guidelines.  \n5.8.4 Co- operative banks shall  at least on an annual basis, review the financial and \noperational condition of the service provider to assess its ability to continue to meet its outsourcing obligations. Such due diligence reviews, which can be based on all  \n11 \n available information about the service provider should highlight any deterioration or \nbreach in performance standards, confidentiality and security, and in business continuity preparedness.  Co-operative banks shall also submit an Annual Compliance Certificate \ngiving the particulars of outsourcing contracts, the prescribed periodicity of audit by internal / external auditor, major findings of the audit and action taken through Boar d, to \nthe Regional Offices  of RBI / NABARD.  \n5.8.5 The event of termination of any  outsourcing agreement for any reason  where the \nservice provider deals with customers , shall be publici sed by displaying at a prominent \nplace in the branches  and posting it on the bank\u2019s website so as to ensure that the \ncustomers do not continue to deal with  the service provider.  \n5.8.6 Certain cases, like outsourcing of cash management, might involve reconciliation of transaction between the co -operative banks, the service prov ider and its sub-\ncontractors. In such cases, banks should ensure reconciliation of transactions between the bank and the service provider (and /or its subcontractor) are carried out  as advised \nin RBI guidelines on \n\u2018Outsourcing of Cash Management \u2013  Reconciliation of \nTransactions\u2019 dated May 14, 2019  as amended from time to time.     \n5.8.7 A robust system of internal audit of all outsourced activities shall be put in place and monitored at the Board level.  \n5.9 Redressal of Grievances related to Outsourced services  \n5.9.1 The co- operative banks shall give wide publicity to the Grievance Redressal \nMachinery within the bank  and also by placing the information on their website . It should \nbe clearly indicated that co- operative banks' Grievance Redressal Machinery will also \ndeal with the issues relating to services provided by the outsourced agencies.  The \nname and contact number of designated grievance redressal officer of the co -operative \nbank should be made known and widely publicised. The designated officer should ensure that genuine grievances of customers are redressed promptly . \n5.9.2 The grievance redressal procedure of the co- operative bank and the time frame \nfixed for responding to the complaints shall be placed on the bank's website.  \n  \n12 \n 5.10 Reporting of transactions to FIU or other competent authorities  \nCo-operative banks shall be responsible for making Currency Transactions Reports and \nSuspicious Transactions Reports to FIU or any other competent authority in respect of \nthe banks' customer related activities carried out by the service providers.  \n6 Centralised List of Outsourced Agents  \nIf a service provider\u2019s contract is terminated prematurely prior to the completion of \ncontracted period of service, Indian Banks' Association (IBA) would have to be informed \nwith reasons for termination. IBA would be maintaining a caution list of such service providers for the entire banking industry for sharing among banks.\n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT642C29DCE69C264AC198E4BDE2C671F7F2.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 25, 2021", "info": "       \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f  \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\ufffd  \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \n_______________________ RESERVE BANK OF INDIA_________________________  \n        www.rbi.org.in   \n \nRBI/2021 -2022/ 63 \nFIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.12/06.02.31/2021- 22                                   June 25, 2021    \n \n \nThe Chairman/ Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer  \nAll Commercial Banks  \n(including Small Finance Banks, Local Area Banks and Regional Rural Banks)  \nAll Primary (Urban) Co -operative Banks/State Co -operative Banks  \n/ District Central Co -operative Banks  \nAll-India Financial Institutions  \nAll Non -Banking Financial Companies  \nDear  Sir/Madam,  \nNew Definition of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises   \n \nPlease refer to the circular FIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.4/06.02.31/2020 -21 dated August 21, \n2020  on \u2018New Definition of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises \u2013 clarifications\u2019.  \n2.

Further, there shall not be any \u2018dual hatting\u2019 \n                                            \n1 As on March 31 of the previous year  \n2 \u2018Board\u2019  in this circular refers to Board of Directors (BoD ) \n3 UCBs reporting earlier to Mumbai Regional  Office of  the erstwhile Department of Co- operative Bank Supervision shall report \nto the Central Office of the Department of Supervision.    \n 2 \n2 i.e. the CRO shall not be given any other responsibility  such as CEO , COO , CFO , \nChief of the I nternal Audit, etc.   \ne) In UCBs that follow committee approach in credit sanction process for high value \nproposals, if the CRO is one of the decision makers in the credit sanction process, he shall have voting power and all members who are part of the credit sanction proc ess, \nshall individually and severally be liable for all the aspects, including risk perspective \nrelated to the credit proposal. If the CRO is not a part of the credit sanction process, \nhis role will be limited to that of an adviser . \nf) In UCBs  which do not fo llow committee approach for sanction of high value credits, \nthe CRO can only be an adviser in the sanction process and shall not have any sanctioning power.  \ng) All credit products shall be vetted by the CRO from the angle of inherent and control \nrisks.  \n3. The CRO shall support the Board in establishing an integrated risk management system, \ncapable of identifying, measuring and monitoring all types of risks on an ongoing basis.  This \nwill include developing the organisational  risk appetite and a framework that will translate the \nBoard\u2019s strategy into clearly laid down monitorable risk limits at the aggregate and at \ngranular levels. The CRO shall also be involved in actual monitoring and mitigation of risks.  \n4. It is emphasized that  the primary responsibility of  risk management lies with the Board. In \norder to focus the required level of attention on various aspects of risk management, UCBs \nmeeting the eligibility criteria specified in para 1 above are advised to set up a Risk Management Committee ( of the Board)  by March 31, 2022.  The Board shall decide the \nmembership, scope of work and frequency of meeting of the Risk Management Committee.   \n5. UCBs meeting  the prescribed criteria as on March 31, 2021 shall appoint  / designate a \nCRO  by March 31, 2022.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) periodically identifies jurisdictions with weak \nmeasures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing (AML / CFT) in its following \npublications: i) High -Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, and ii) Jurisdictions under \nIncreased Monitoring. A jurisdict ion whose name does not appear in these  two lists is \nreferred to as a FATF compliant jurisdiction.  Investments in PSOs from FATF non -\ncompliant jurisdictions shall not be treated at par with that from compliant jurisdictions.  \n \n3. Investors in existing PSOs holding their investments prior to the classification of the \nsource or intermediate jurisdiction/s as FATF non- compliant, may continue with the \ninvestments or bring in additional investments as per extant regulations so as to support \ncontinuity of business  in India.  \n \n4. New i nvestors from or through non- compliant FATF jurisdictions, whether in existing \nPSOs or in entities seeking authori sation as PSOs, are  not permitted  to acquire,  directly or \nindirectly , \u2018significant influence\u2019 as defined in the applicabl e accounting standards in the \nconcerned PSO. In other words, fresh investments (directly or indirectly) from such  \n \nContinuation Sheet\u2026  \n \n| Reserve Bank of India | DPSS | Central Office | 2 \n \n \n \njurisdictions, in aggregate, should account for less than 20 per cent of the voting power \n(including potential1 voting power) of the PSO.  \n 5. The above instructions, as amended from time to time, shall also apply to any entity \nthat has applied for or that intends to apply for  authorisation as a PSO  under the Payment \nand Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  \n 6. This directive is issued under Section 18 read with Section 10(2) of the Payment \nand Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  \n \nYours faithfully,  \n \n \n(P.

In such cases, it should be ensured that new investments from FATF non- compliant jurisdictions \nare less than both (i) 20 per cent of the existing voting powers, and (ii) 20 per cent of existing and potential voting \npowers assuming those potential voting rights have materialised.

The recommendations of the Committee have been comprehensively examined. It is also \nobserved that the last change in interchange fee structure for ATM transactions was in August \n2012, while the charges payable by customers were last revised in August 2014. A  substantial \ntime has thus elapsed since these fees were last changed . Accordingly , given the increasing \ncost of ATM deployment and expenses towards ATM maintenance incurred by banks / white \nlabel ATM o perators , as also considering the need to balance expectations of stakeholder \nentities and customer convenience, it has been decided as under  : \na. Allow increase in interchange fee per transaction from \u20b915 to \u20b917 for financial \ntransactions and from \u20b95 to \u20b96 for non- financial transactions  in all centres . This shall \nbe effective from August  1, 2021 . \nb. Customer s are eligible for five free transactions (inclusive of financial and non-\nfinancial transactions) every month from their own bank  ATM s. They are also \neligible for free transactions (inclusive of financial and non- financial transactions) \nfrom other bank ATMs viz. three transactions in metro centres and five transactions \nin non- metro centres . Beyond the free transactions, the ceiling / cap on customer \ncharges is  \u20b920 per transaction, as  prescribed vide circular DPSS.CO.PD.No.316/  \n02.10.002/2014- 2015 dated August 14, 2014 . To compensate the banks for the higher  interchange fee  and given the general escalation in costs , they are allowed \nto increase the customer charges to \u20b921 per transaction. This increase shall be \neffective from January 1, 2022.  \nc. Applicable taxes, if any, shall be additionally payable.  \nd. These  instructions shall also apply , mutatis mutandis , to transactions done at  Cash \nRecycler Machines (other than for cash deposit transactions) . \n \n3.

In respect of accounts of borrowers which  were restructured in terms of the MSME \nrestructuring circulars , lending institutions are permitted, as a one -time measure, to review the \nworking capital sanctioned limits and / or drawing power based on a reassessment of the \nworking capital cycle, reduction of margins, etc. without the same being treated as \nrestructuring.

The resurgence of Covid- 19 pandemic in India in the recent weeks and the consequent \ncontainment measures to check  the spread of the pandemic  may impact the recovery process \nand create new uncertainties. With the objective of alleviat ing the potential stress to  individual \nborrowers  and small  businesses, the following set of measures are being announced. These set \nof measures are broadly in line with the contours of the Resolution Framework - 1.0, with \nsuitable modifications.   \n3. Part A of this circular pertains to re quirements specific to resolution of advances to \nindividuals  and small businesses and Part B pertains to working capital support for : (i) \nindividuals who have availed of loans for business purposes , and (ii) small businesses,  where \nresolution plans were im plemented previously.

Any resolution plan implemented in breach of the stipulations of this circular shall be fully \ngoverned by the Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets issued on June 7, \n2019  (\u201cPrudential Framework\u201d ), or the relevant instructions as applicable to specific \ncategory of lending institutions where the Prudential Framework is not applicable.  \nInvocation of resolution process  \n7. The lending institutions shall  frame Board approved policies at the earliest ( but not later than \nfour weeks from the date of this Circular ), pertaining to implementation of viable resolution \nplans for eligible borrowers under this framework, ensuring that the resolution under this facility is provided only to the borrowers having stre ss on account of Covid- 19. The Board \napproved policy shall, inter alia , detail the eligibility of borrowers in respect of whom the \nlending institutions shall be willing to consider the resolution, and shall lay down the due \ndiligence considerations to be f ollowed by the lending institutions to establish the necessity of \nimplementing a resolution plan in respect of the concerned borrower  as well as the system for \nredressing the grievance of borrowers  who request for resolution under the window and / or \nare u ndergoing resolution under this window . The Board approved policy shall be sufficiently \npublicised and should be available on the website of the lending institutions in an easily \naccessible manner.   3 8. The resolution process under this window shall be treat ed as invoked when the lending \ninstitution and the borrower agree to proceed with the efforts towards finalising a resolution \nplan to be implemented  in respect of such borrower .

In order to optimise the processing time, lending \ninstitutions may prepare product -level standardized templates as part of their Board approved \npolicies, as above, for resolution under this window. \n9. The decision to invoke the resolution process under this window shall be taken by each \nlending institution having exposure to a borrower independent of invocation decisions taken  \nby other lending institutions, if any, having exposure to the same borrower.  \n10. The last date for invocation of resolution permitted under this window is September 30, \n2021. \nPermitted features of resolution plan s and implementation  \n11. The resolution pl ans implemented under this window may inter alia  include rescheduling \nof payments, conversion of any interest accrued or to be accrued into another credit facility, \nrevisions in working capital sanctions, granting of moratorium  etc. based on an assessment of \nincome streams of the borrower. However, compromise settlements are not permitted as a \nresolution plan for this purpose.  \n12. The moratorium period, if granted, may be for a maximum of two years, and shall come \ninto force immediately upon implementation of the resolution plan. The extension of the \nresidual tenor of the loan facilities may also be granted to borrowers , with or without payment \nmoratorium. The overall cap on extension of residual tenor, inclusive of moratorium period if \nany permitted, shall  be two years.  \n13. The resolution plan may also provide for conversion of a portion of the debt into equity or other marketable, non- convertible debt securities issued by the borrower, wherever applicable, \nand the same shall be governed in terms of P aragraphs 30- 32 of the Annex to the Resolution \nFramework \u2013 1.0.  \n14. The instructions contained in the \ncircular DOR.No.BP.BC/13/21.04.048/2020- 21 dated \nSeptember 7, 2020  on \u201cResolution Framework for COVID -19-related Stress \u2013 Financial \nParameters\u201d shall not be ap plicable to resolution plans implemented under this window. \n15. The resolution plan should be finalised and implemented within 90 days from the date of invocation of the resolution process under this window. The resolution plan shall be deemed to \nbe implem ented only if all the conditions in Paragraph 10 of the Annex to the Resolution \nFramework \u2013 1.0 are met . \n \n  4 Asset classification and provisioning  \n16. If a resolution plan is implemented in adherence to the provisions of this circular, the asset \nclassificati on of borrowers\u2019 accounts classified as Standard may be retained as such upon \nimplementation, whereas the borrowers\u2019 accounts which may have slipped into NPA between invocation and implementation may be upgraded as Standard, as on the date of implementation \nof the resolution plan.  \n17. The subsequent asset classification for such exposures will be governed by the criteria laid \nout in the \nMaster Circular -  Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and \nProvisioning pertaining to Advances dat ed July 1, 2015  or other relevant instructions as \napplicable to specific category of lending institutions (\u201cextant IRAC norms\u201d).  \n18. In respect of borrowers where the resolution process has been invoked, lending institutions \nare permitted to sanction a dditional finance  even before implementation of the plan in order to \nmeet the interim liquidity requirements of the borrower. This facility  of additional finance  may \nbe classified as \u2018 Standard\u2019 till implementation of the plan regardless of the actual perfo rmance \nof the borrower in the interim.  However, if the resolution plan is not implemented within the \nstipulated timelines, the asset classification of the additional finance sanctioned will be as per \nthe actual performance of the borrower with respect to s uch additional finance or performance \nof the rest of the credit facilities, whichever is worse.  \n19. The lending institutions shall keep provisions from the date of implementation, which are \nhigher of the provisions held as per the extant IRAC norms immediately before implementation, or 10 percent of the renegotiated debt exposure of the lending institut ion post \nimplementation (residual debt). Residual debt, for this purpose, will also include the portion of \nnon-fund based facilities that may have devolved into fund based facilities after the date of \nimplementation.  \n20. Half of the above provisions may be  written back upon the borrower paying at least 20 per \ncent of the residual debt without slipping into NPA post implementation of the plan, and the \nremaining half may be written back upon the borrower paying another 10 per cent of the \nresidual debt without  slipping into NPA subsequently.  \nProvided that  in respect of exposures other than personal loans, the above provisions shall not \nbe written back before one year from the commencement of the first payment of interest or \nprincipal (whichever is later) on the  credit facility with longest period of moratorium. \n21. The provisions required to be maintained under this window, to the extent not already \nreversed, shall be available for the provisioning requirements when any of the accounts, where a resolution plan had been implemented, is subsequently classified as NPA.  \nConvergence of the norms for loans resolved previously  \n22. In cases of loans of borrowers specified in Clause 5 above where resolution plans had been \nimplemented in terms of the Resolution F ramewor k \u2013 1.0, and where the resolution plans  had \npermitted no moratoria or moratoria of less than two years and / or extension of residual tenor \nby a period of less than two years, lending institutions are permitted to use this window to  5 modify such plans only  to the extent of increasing the period of moratorium / extension of \nresidual tenor subject to the caps in Clause 12 above , and the consequent  changes necessary \nin the terms of the loan  for implementing such extension. The overall caps on moratorium and \n/ or extension of residual tenor granted under Resolution Framework \u2013 1.0 and this framework \ncombined, shall be two years.  \n23. This modification shall also follow the timelines specified in Clauses 7 , 10 and 1 5 above. \nFor loans where modifications are implemented in line with Clause 2 2 above, the instructions \nregarding asset classification and provisioning shall continue to be as per the Resolution \nFramework \u2013 1.0. \nB. Working capital support for small businesses where resolution plans were \nimplemented prev iously  \n24. In respect of borrowers specified at sub -clauses (b) and (c) of Clause 5 above where \nresolution plans had been implemented in terms of the Resolution Framework \u2013 1.0, lending \ninstitutions are permitted , as a one -time measure,  to review the worki ng capital sanctioned \nlimits and / or drawing power based on a reassessment of the working capital cycle , reduction \nof margins , etc. without the same being treated as restructuring.  The decision with regard to \nabove shall be taken by lending institutions by September 30, 2021, with the margins and working capital limits  being restored to the levels as per the resolution plan implemented under \nResolution Framework \u2013 1.0, by March 31, 2022. \n25. The above measures shall be contingent on the lending institutions satisfying themselves \nthat the same is necessitated on account of the economic fallout from COVID -19. Further, \naccounts provided relief under these instructions shall be subject to subsequent supervisory \nreview with regard to their justifiabil ity on account of the economic fallout from COVID -19. \n26. Lending institutions may, accordingly, put in place a Board approved policy to implement \nthe above measures, which should be disclosed in the public domain and placed on their \nwebsites in a prominen t and easily accessible manner.  \nC. Disclosures and Credit Reporting  \n27. Lending institutions publishing quarterly financial statements shall, at the minimum, make \ndisclosures as per the format prescribed in Format -X\n in their financial statements for the \nquart ers ending September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2021. The resolution plans \nimplemented in terms of Part A of this framework should also be included in the continuous \ndisclosures required as per Format -B prescribed in the Resolution Framework  \u2013 1.0. \n28. The number of borrower accounts where modifications were sanctioned and implemented in terms of Clause 2 2 above, and the aggregate exposure of the lending institution to such \nborrowers may also be disclosed on a quarterly basis, starting from the quarter ending June 30, 2021. \n29.

These guidelines supersede all previous guidelines (list enclosed at Table 1) issued on the subject.  \n \n2. Applicability:  \n2.1 These guidelines will be applicable to the Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs), UCBs and NBFCs  including HFCs  (hereinafter referred to as the Entities)  for Financial Year \n2021- 22 and onwards in respect of appointment/r eappointment of SCAs/SAs\n1 of the Entities. \nHowever, non- deposit taking NBFCs with asset size2 below \u20b91,000 crore have the option to \ncontinue with their extant procedure.  \n \n2.2 As RBI guidelines regarding appointment of SCAs/SAs shall be implemented for the first \ntime for UCBs and NBFCs from FY 2021- 22, they shall have the flexibility to adopt these \nguidelines from H2 (second half) of FY 2021- 22 in order to ensure that there is no disruption.  \n \n \n                                                \n1 SCAs in case of the Entities  which appoint se parate Statutory Branch Auditors (SBAs) and SAs in case of all other \nEntities  \n \n2 For the purpose, asset size means total assets.   \n2 \n \n3.

Further, the Entity may fi nalise the work allocation \namong SCAs/SAs, before the commencement of the statutory audit, in consultation with their SCAs/SAs.  \n 4.2 The Entities should decide on the number of SCAs/SAs based on a Board/ Local \nManagement Committee (LMC)  Approved Policy, inter alia , taking into account the relevant \nfactors such as the size and spread of assets, accounting and administrative units, complexity of transactions, level of computerization, availability of other independent audit inputs, identified risks in financia l reporting, etc.  \n \n                                                \n3 As defined in Rule 6(3) of the Companies (Audit & Auditors) Rules, 2014  \n  \n3 \n \nConsidering the above factors and the requirements of the Entity, the actual number of \nSCAs/SAs to be appointed shall be decided by the respective Boards /LMC , subject to the \nfollowing limits:  \nSl. No.  Asset Size of the Entity  Maximum num ber of SCAs/SAs  \n1.  Upto \u20b95,00,000 crore  4 \n2.  Above \u20b9 5,00,000 crore and Upto     \n\u20b9 10,00,000 crore  6 \n3.  Above \u20b9 10,00,000 crore and Upto    \n\u20b9 20,00,000 crore  8 \n4.  Above \u20b9 20,00,000 crore  12 \n   \nThe above limits have been prescribed to ensure that the number of SCAs/SAs appointed by the Entities are adequate, commensurate with the asset size and extent of operations of the Entities, with a view to ensure that audits are conducted in a timely and effective manner.

Eligibility Criteria of Auditors  \nEach Entity is required to appoint audit firm(s) as its SCA(s )/SA(s) fulfilling the eligibility norms \nas prescribed in Annex I\n. \n \n6. Independence of Auditors  \n6.1 For Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) and NBFCs4, the Audit Committee of the Board \n(ACB)/ LMC  shall monitor and assess the independ ence of the auditors and conflict of interest \nposition in terms of relevant regulatory provisions, standards and best practices. Any concerns \n                                                \n4 For the NBFCs which are required to constitute an Audit Committee of the Board (ACB) in terms of Para 70 (1) of \nMaster Direction - Non-Banking Financial Company - Systemically Important Non- Deposit taking Company and  \nDepos it taking Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016  to be read with Section 177 of the Companies Act, 2013.   \n4 \n \nin this regard may be flagged by the ACB/LMC to the Board of Directors of the Commercial \nBank (excluding RRBs)/NBF C and concerned Senior Supervisory Manager (SSM)/Regional \nOffice (RO) of RBI.  \nFor UCBs/remaining NBFCs, the Board of Directors shall monitor and assess the independence of the auditors. Any concerns in this regard may be flagged by the Board of the UCB/NB FC to the concerned SSM/RO of RBI.  \n6.2 In case of any concern with the Management of the Entities such as non- availability of \ninformation/non- cooperation by the Management, which may hamper the audit process, the \nSCAs/SAs shall approach the Board\n5/ACB/LMC of the Entity, under intimation to the \nconcerned SSM/RO of RBI.  \n6.3 Concurrent auditors of the Entity should not be considered for appointment as SCAs/SAs \nof the same Entity. The audit of the Entity and any entity with large exposure6 to the Entity for \nthe same reference year should also be explicitly factored in while assessing independence of \nthe auditor.  \n \n6.4 The time gap between any non- audit works (services mentioned at Section 144 of \nCompanies Act, 2013, Internal assignments, special assignments, et c.) by the SCAs/SAs for \nthe Entities or any audit/non- audit works for its group entities should be at least one year, \nbefore or after its appointment as SCAs/SAs. However, during the tenure as SCA/SA, an audit firm may provide such services to the concerned Entities which may not normally result in a conflict of interest\n7, and Entities may take their own decision in this regard, in consultation with \nthe Board/ACB/LMC.  \n6.5 The restrictions as detailed in para 6.3 and 6.4 above, should also apply to an audit  firm \nunder the same network8 of audit firms or any other  audit firm having common partners .  \n7.

Such reports should be sent with the approval/recommendation of the Board/ACB/LMC, with the full details of the audit firm.   \n7.3 In the event of lapses in carrying out audit assignments resulting in misstatement of an \nEntity\u2019s financial statements, and any violations/lapses vis -\u00e0-vis the RBI\u2019s directions/guidelines \nregarding the role and responsibilities of the SCAs/SAs in relation to Entities, the SCAs/SAs \nwould be l iable to be dealt with suitably under the relevant statutory/regulatory framework.  \n \n8. Tenure and Rotation  \n8.1. In order to protect the independence of the auditors/audit firms, Entities will have to \nappoint the SCAs/SAs for a continuous period of three y ears\n11, subject to the firms satisfying \nthe eligibility norms each year. Further, Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) and UCBs can \nremove the audit firms during the above period only with the prior approval of the concerned office of RBI (Department of Superv ision), as applicable for prior approval for appointment, as \nmentioned at Para 3.2 of this circular. NBFCs removing the SCAs/SAs before completion of three years tenure shall inform concerned SSM/RO at RBI about it, along with reasons/justification for the same, within a month of such a decision being taken.  \n8.2 An audit firm would not be eligible for reappointment in the same Entity for six years (two tenures) after completion of full or part of one term of the audit tenure\n12. However, audit firms \ncan cont inue to undertake statutory audit of other Entities.  \n 8.3. One audit firm can concurrently take up statutory audit of a maximum of four Commercial Banks [ including not more than one PSB or one All India Financial Institution (NABARD, \nSIDBI, NHB, EXIM Bank)  or RBI ], eight UCBs and eight NBFCs during a particular year, \nsubject to compliance with required eligibility criteria and other conditions for each Entity and \n                                                \n9 Board shall review the performance of SCAs/SAs in case ACB is non- existent in the Entity . \n10 Circular dated March 26, 2004  on \u2018Asse ssment of Performance of Statutory Auditors\u2019 addressed to the PSBs has \nbeen superseded by this circular.  \n11 Office of C &AG will continue to appoin t Statutory Auditors of the Government Companies and Government \nControlled Other Companies under Section 139 (5) and 139 (7) of the Companies Act , 2013 . Such Companies are \nalso subject to supplementary/test audit by the  Office of C&AG  under Section 143 (6) and (7)  of the said Act . Such  \nEntities  will be guide d by the C&AG Guidelines regarding tenure and rotation policy. However, such appointments \nfor Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd. and India Post Payments Bank Ltd. will be done by the Office of C&AG with RBI\u2019s \nconcurrence. Further, the audit firms which have already  completed tenure of 1 year or 2 year s with any Entity may \nbe permitted to complete the balance tenure only, i.e. 2 years and 1 year respectively, if they fulfill the eligibility norms on an annual basis.  \n \n12 In case an audit firm has conducted audit of any  Entity  for part -tenure (1 year or 2 years) and then not appointed \nfor remainder tenure, they also would not be eligible for reappointment in the same Entity  for six years from \ncompletion of part -tenure.   \n6 \n \nwithin overall ceiling prescribed by any other statutes or rules. For clarity, the limits presc ribed \nfor UCBs exclude audit of other co- operative societies by the same audit firm.  For the purpose \nof this circular, a group of audit firms having common partners and/or under the same network, \nwill be considered as one entity and they will be considered for allotment of SCA/SA \naccordingly. Shared/Sub- contracted audit by any other/associate audit firm under the same \nnetwork of audit firms is not permissible. The incoming audit firm shall not be eligible if such audit firm is associated with the outgoing a uditor or audit firm under the same network of audit \nfirms.  \n \n9. Audit Fees and Expenses  \n9.1 The audit fees for SCAs/SAs of all the Entities shall be decided in terms of the relevant \nstatutory/regulatory provisions.  Public Sector Banks will continue to be g uided by relevant RBI \ninstructions in the matter.  \n \n9.2 The audit fees for SCAs/SAs of all the Entities shall be reasonable and commensurate with \nthe scope and coverage of audit, size and spread of assets, accounting and administrative units, complexity of transactions, level of computerization, identified risks in financial reporting, \netc. \n 9.3 The Board/ACB/LMC of Entities shall make recommendation to the competent authority as per the relevant statutory/regulatory instructions for fixing audit fees of SCA s/SAs.  \n \n10. Statutory Audit Policy and Appointment Procedure  \n10.1 Each Entity shall formulate a Board/LMC Approved Policy to be hosted on its official \nwebsite/public domain and formulate necessary procedure thereunder to be followed for appointment of SCA s/SAs. Apart from conforming to all relevant statutory/regulatory \nrequirements in addition to these instructions, this should afford necessary transparency and \nobjectivity for most key aspects of this important assurance function.  \n \n10.2 Guidelines on minim um procedural requirements are given at Annex II\n.   \nYours faithfully,  \n \n(Ajay Kumar Choudhary)  \nChief General Manager -In-Charge  \n \nFAQs - Guidelines for Appointment of Statutory Central Auditors (SCAs)/Statutory Auditors \n(SAs) of Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs), UCBs and NBFCs (including HFCs)   \n7 \n \nANNEX I  \nEligibility Criteria for Appointment as SCA/SA  \nA.

NULM has been under implementation \nw.e.f. September 24, 2013 in all district headquarters (irrespective of population) and all the cities with population of 1 lakh or more.  \n \nThe Self Employment Program (SEP) of NULM focus es on providing financial \nassistance through provision of interest subsidy on loans to support establishment of \nIndividual & Group Enterprises and S elf-Help Groups (SHGs) of urban poor. The \nerstwhile provision of capital subsidy for USEP (Urban Self Employment Program) and \nUWSP (Urban Women Self -Help Program) under  SJSRY has been replaced by interest \nsubsidy for loans to Individual enterprise (SEP -I), Group enterprise (SEP- G) and Self \nHelp Groups ( SEP-SHGs). With a view to improving the livelihood opportuniti es for the \npoor in urban areas, erstwhile Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (UPA \nDivision), Government of India vide their Office Memorandum No.K -14011/2/2012-\nUPA/FTS -5196 dated February 19, 2016 had enhance d the scope of National Urban \nLivelihoods Mission. The Mission with enhanced scope was  renamed as \u201cDeendayal \nAntyodaya Yojana -National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY -NULM)\u201d.  \nThe operational guidelines of the Self Employment Program (SEP) component of DAY -\nNULM are as under:  \n1. Introduction:  \n1.1 The SEP provides  financial assistance to individuals/groups including street \nvenders/hawkers of urban poor for setting up gainful self -employment ventures/ micro-\nenterprises, suited to their skills, training, aptitude and local conditions. The programme \nalso support s Self Help Groups (SHGs) of urban poor to access easy credit from bank \nand avail interest subsidy on SHG loans. The SEP will also focus on technology, \nmarketing and other support services to the above beneficiarie s engaged in micro \nenterprises for their livelihoods  and will also facilitate issuance of credit cards for \nworking capital requirement of the entrepreneurs.  \n 1.2 The underemployed and unemployed urban poor will be encouraged to set up \nsmall enterprises relati ng to manufacturing, servic e and small business for which there \nis considerable local demand. Local skills and local crafts should be particularly encouraged. Each Urban Local Body (ULB) should develop a compendium of such    \n3 \n activities/projects keeping in vi ew skills available, marketability of products, costs, \neconomic viability etc.  \n \n1.3 The percentage of women beneficiaries under SEP shall not be less than 30 \npercent. SCs and STs must be benefited at least to the extent of the proportion of their \nstrength in t he city/town population of poor. A special  provision of 5 percent reservation \nshould be made for the differently -abled under this program  with priority to women.  In \nview of the Prime Minister\u2019s 15- Point Program for the Welfare of Minorities, at least 15 \npercent of the physical and financial targets under this component shall be earmarked for the minority communities.  \n \n2. Selection  of Beneficiary & Procedure for Sponsoring Applications:  \nThe Community Organizers (COs) and professionals from Urban Local Body  (ULB) will \nidentify the prospective beneficiaries from among the urban poor. The community \nstructures formed under Social Mobilization & Institutional Development (SM&ID) \ncomponent of DAY - NULM viz. Self Help Groups (SHGs) and Area Level Federations \n(ALFs ) may also refer prospective individual and group entrepreneurs for purpose of \nfinancial assistance under SEP to ULB. The beneficiaries may directly approach ULB or \nits representatives for assistance.  Banks may also identify prospective beneficiaries at \ntheir end and forward such cases directly to ULB. The Banks  may also use their \nempaneled Business Correspondents ( BCs) and Business Facilitators (BFs) to increase \nthe outreach. Due diligence wil l be undertaken as per the Banks\u2019 policy, in this regard.   \n \n2.1 The application for individual and group enterprise loans will be sponsored by the \nUrban Local Body (ULB) which will be the sponsoring agency for the individual and group enterprise.  \n \n2.2 The ULB will create awareness regarding SEP to the prospective beneficiaries \nthrough mass media campaigns, Information Education and Communication (IEC) activities, adv ertisements in local newspapers, City Livelihoods Centres (CLCs) etc. The \nULB may also disseminate information regarding this component through active involvement of Resource Organizations and its field staff.  \n \n2.3 The beneficiaries desirous of seeking financial assistance for setting up an \nenterprise can submit an application of intent to the concerned ULB officials on a plain paper with basic details viz:  Name, Age, Contact details, Address, Aadhaar details (if \nany), amount of loan required, bank account number (if available), type of enterprise/ \nactivity, category etc. The intent could also be sent by mail /post to the ULB office. The \nULB shall accept suc h intents throughout the year.  \n \n2.4 The community structures formed under Social Mobilization & Institutional \nDevelopment (SM&ID) component of DAY -NULM viz: Self Help Groups (SHGs)/ Area    \n4 \n Level Federations (ALFs) may also refer prospective individual and gr oup entrepreneurs \nfor purpose of financial assistance under SEP to ULB.  \n \n2.5 On submission/receipt of the intent from the beneficiary the respective ULB will \nenter the details in a register/or MIS if available and hence will generate a waiting list of \nbene ficiaries. The ULB will issue an acknowledgement to the beneficiary with a unique \nregistration number, which may be used as a reference number for tracking the status \nof application.  \n \n2.6 ULB will call the beneficiaries in order of the waiting list to complete requisite \ndocumentation including filling of Loan Application Form (LAF), activity details, identity \nproof, address proof, bank account details etc. To verify the identity of the beneficiary, \nher/his Aadhar number will also be brought on record. If beneficiary does not have \nAadhaar card, his/ her any other unique identification document like voters\u2019 card, driving license etc. will be taken and s/he will be helped to obtain Aadhar card as soon as possible. The State Urban Livelihoods Mission (SULM)  may develop a Loan Application \nForm (LAF) in suitable format in consultation with State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) convenor bank. The same LAF may be utilised across the State/UTs. The Loan Application Form (LAF) will contain basic data in respect of econo mic status of the \nbeneficiary and her/his family. This data will be such that it can be used to analyse \nimpact of the benefits on her/his economic status at a later stage.  \n \n2.7 A Task Force constituted at ULB level will scrutinize the applications based on \nexperience, skills, viability of activity, scope of the activity etc. Thereafter, the Task \nForce will shortlist the applications and call for interview of the applicants before \nrecommending or rejecting the application or call for additional information f rom the \napplicant if required.  \n \n2.8 The Chief Executive Officer (CEO)/ Municipal Commissioner of ULB will be \nresponsible to constitute the Task Force and will be the Chairman of the Task force. \nThere could be more than 1 task force at ULB level depending upon the size/population of the ULB.  \n2.9 The indicative composition of the Task Force is as follows:  \n \nSr.  No.  TASK Force at ULB level  Role  \n1. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) ULB/ Municipal \nCommissioner of ULB/ or any representative authorized \nby CEO ULB  Chairman  \n2. Lead District Manager (LDM)  Member  \n3.

Such cases recommended by task force have to be processed by concerned banks within a time frame of 15 days. As these cases are already recommended by the task force, such cases should be rejected by banks only \nin exceptional circumstances.  \n \n2.12 The banks will send a periodic report to the ULB on the status of the applications \nreceived. In case of MIS being used, the banks may be allowed to update the status of \napplication online in addition to manual report.  \n \n2.13 Banks may also directly accept the loan applications of urban poor beneficiaries on \nthe basis of relevant documents as per the guidelines of Prime Minister MUDRA Yojana \n(PMMY) or any other such scheme without the need of having prior sponsoring from \nULB. The banks can send details of such loans sanctioned by them to ULBs for \nconfirmation of their eligibility for interest subsidy under DAY -NULM. Task Force \nconstituted for scrutinizing applications should quickly clear these applications if they \notherwise meet the criteria. On confirmation of their eligibility, interest subsidy may be \nclaimed from ULBs on the pattern of interest subsidy claim for beneficiaries sponsored \nby ULBs .

In case the beneficiary has ac quired requisite \nskills from family occupation such cases should be certified by the ULB before \nextending financial assistance.  \n 3.2 Entrepreneurship Development Program (EDP): In addition to skill training of \nthe beneficiaries, the ULB will also arrange to conduct Entrepreneurship Development Program for 3 -7 days for individual and group entrepreneurs. The EDP will cover basics \nof entrepreneurship development such as management of an enterprise, basic accounting, financial management, marketing, backward and f orward linkages, legal \nprocedures, costing and revenue etc. In addition to above topics the module should also include group dynamics, allocation of work, profit sharing mechanism etc. for group \nenterprises.  \n \n3.3 The EDP module may be developed and finalized by State Urban Livelihoods \nMission (SULM) supported by State Mission Management Unit (SMMU) with assistance \nof an empaneled institution/agency or consulting firm and same may be utilized for \nconducting training program by the ULB. This EDP training may be arranged through institutions such as Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI), reputed institutions engaged in entrepreneurship development/ training, management/ \neducational institutes,  reputed NGOs  engaged in entrepreneurship development/ \ntraining etc.  \n \n3.4 Follow -up entrepreneurial support to Individual and Group entrepreneurs:    \nAfter financing to Individual and Group beneficiaries, the ULB will also arrange to \nconduct follow -up Entrepreneurship Development Programme (EDP) as and when \nrequired.

All the Banks will consolidate data \nregarding interest subsidy from their branches and upload on the portal of Nodal \nBank. The nodal bank, after verification  by concerned ULB/states , will transfer the \ninterest subsidy to the beneficiaries through DBT mode.  The State/UT will deposit \nsome funds in advance with the nodal bank, which will release funds as p er guidelines \nof the DAY -NULM. Nodal bank will regularly render account of reimbursement to the \nSULM. This procedure will be followed in all three types of loans i.e. SEP (I), SEP (G) and SHG -Bank Linkage.     \n8 \n 6.

Group Enterprises (SEP -G) -Loan & Subsidy  \nA Self Help Group (SHG) or members of an SHG constituted under DAY -NULM or a \ngroup of urban poor for self -employment can avail benefit of subsidized loans under this \ncomponent from any bank. The norms/ specifications for group based micro -enterprise \nloans are as follows:  \n    \n9 \n 7.1 Eligibility Criteria:  The group enterprises should have minimum of Three  (3) \nmembers with a   minimum of 70%  of the members  from urban poor families.

SHG -Bank Linkage \u2013  General Guidelines  \nLinking of SHGs with banks have been emphasized in the Monetary policy of Reserve \nBank of India and Union Budget announcements from time to time and various guidelines in this regard have been issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to banks. \nTo scale up the SHGs linkage program and make it sustainable, banks have been    \n10 \n advised to consider lending to SHGs as part of their mainstream credit operations both \nat policy and implementation level.  \n \n8.1 Master Circular of RBI on SHG -Bank Linkage Programme, FIDD.FID.BC. \nNo.06/12.01.033/2021- 22 dated April 01, 2021  contains instructions on opening of \nSavings Bank Account of Self Help Groups (whether registered or unregistered) , which \nare engaged in promoting habit of savings among their members as a starting point. \nThereafter, the SHGs may be sanctioned Savings Linked Loans (varying from a saving \nto loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4) after due assessment or grading by banks. However, in case \nof matured SHGs, loans may be given beyond the limit of four times the savings as per the discretion of the bank.  The Banks have also been instructed that the advances to \nSHGs irrespective of the purposes for which the members of SHGs should be incl uded \nby the banks as part of their lending to the weaker sections.  \n \n8.2 Under Social Mobilization & Institution Development (SM&ID) component of DAY -\nNULM, the ULB will do necessary groundwork to open bank accounts for SHGs and facilitating access to Revolving Fund (RF). The ULB may also engage Resource \nOrganization (RO) for the purpose or may directly facilitate SHGs through its staff. (Concept & Formation of SHGs, ROs and Revolving Fund has been detailed out in Social Mobilization & Institutional Dev elopment (SM&ID) component of DAY - NULM).  \n 8.3 The banks will send the details of disbursed loan cases to the ULB along w ith the \ncalculation details of the interest subsidy amount. The ULB will check  the data at their \nend and will release the inter est subs idy amount on monthly basis to the banks \nfollowing a similar pr ocedure as mentioned in Para 5.  \n \n8.4 The ULB through its field staff or Resource Organization (ROs) will facilitate filling of \nloan applications for eligible SHGs to access credit from the bank s. The ULB will be \nresponsible to forward the Loan application of the SHGs to the concerned banks with \nrequisite documentation. The ULB will maintain area wise, bank -wise, ROs/ Staff wise \ndata of SHGs loan applications forwarded to the banks. The same will  be sent to SULM \non a monthly basis.  \n \n8.5 In order to ensure effective SHG -Bank Linkage under DAY -NULM, the SULM will \nmonitor and review the progress with banks on regular basis and co- ordinate with SLBC \nfor interest subsidy/ subvention on SHG Loans in the state. Active involvement of State \nlevel Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) and lead banks may be ensured for sensitization of bank and branch staff for financial inclusion of urban poor.  \n \n8.6 It may be noted that the identification, selection, formation and monitoring of SHGs \nwho are to get interest subvention would be the responsibility of State/ ULBs and banks \nwould not be liable for wrong identification of SHGs who get interest subvention.     \n11 \n  \n8.7 Type of Loan Facility: SHGs can avail either Term loan or a Cash Credit Limit (CCL) \nloan or both based on their needs. In case of need, a dditional loan can be sanctioned \neven though the previous loan is outstanding.  \n \n8.8 Guidelines for prompt repayment are as follows:  \na. For Cash Credit Limit to SHGs:  \ni) Outstanding balance shall not have remained in excess of the sanctioned \nlimit/drawing power continuously for more than 30 days.  \n \nii) There shall be regular credits and debits in the account. In any case there shall be at \nleast one customer induced credit during the month.  \n \niii) Customer induced Credits during a month shall be sufficient to cover the interest debited during the month.  \n \nb. For Term Loan to SHGs: A term loan account where all of the interest payments \nand/or instalments of principal were paid within 30 days of the due date during the entire tenure of the loans would be considered as an account having prompt payment.  \n 9. Progress Reporting for SEP -I, SEP-G & SEP- SHG  \n9.1 The ULB will prepare a data sheet of the applications recommended by the TASK \nforce along  with their status details of the sanction, disbursement and rejection (along \nwith reasons) after validating the same with the respective banks. This data sheet will be sent to SULM on a monthly basis.  \n \n9.2 The SULM will compile all the reports received fr om respective ULBs and will \ncommunicate to M inistry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA)  on a monthly basis.  \n \n9.3 SULM must ensure that progress under SEP is reviewed in every SLBC and District \nConsultative Committee (DCC) meetings. Any other important iss ue with regard to SEP \nmay be taken up by SULM with SLBC convener bank for effective coordination and implementation.  \n10. Credit Card for enterprise development  \n10.1 The financial assistance to the individual entrepreneurs though subsidized loan \nfor setting up o f enterprises under DAY -NULM could be viewed as initial impetus to \nfacilitate livelihood support to the urban poor. However the individual entrepreneurs \nrequire further financial support in terms of working capital to make the enterprise \neconomically sustainable. This may include immediate and short term monthly \nrequirement of cash for meeting expenses for purchase of goods, raw materials and other miscellaneous expenditures etc. The micro- entrepreneur does not have a regular    \n12 \n fixed monthly cash inflow/incom e to meet expenses arising out of entrepreneurial \nactivities. To approach a financial institution for such immediate credit requirement, it \nrequires procedural documentation and consumes a lot of time. This need for working \ncapital credit is generally met from informal sources of credit (including money lenders) \nwhich is typically available at high rate of interest.  \n \n10.2 In order to support the micro- entrepreneurs to meet their working capital and \nmiscellaneous credit needs, DAY -NULM will facilitate access to  Credit Cards  or MUDRA \nCard through banks.  \n 10.3 The SULM in consultation with the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) will \nfinalize the norms, limits and specifications for issuance of Credit  Card (or) MUDRA \nCard to the individual entrepreneurs. The General Cr edit Card Scheme (GCC), which is \nbeing implemented by all scheduled commercial banks or any other variant of credit cards for enterprise development of banks in urban areas, may be explored by SULM \nand SLBC for the same. The Circular on revised GCC scheme has been issued by RBI \nnotification vide \nRPCD.MSME&NFS.BC.No.61/06.02.31/2013- 14 dated December 02, \n2013  available on RBI web- site \u2018www.rbi.org.in \u2019. \n 10.4 The ULB will identify the prospective beneficiaries and will facilitate linkages with \nbanks for issuance of credit cards. The focus is to initially facilitate issuance of credit \ncard to cover all the beneficiaries who have availed financi al assistance under SEP.  \nAdditionally,  other beneficiaries who are running their own business but have not \navailed assistance under SEP may also be covered if they satisfy the norms of issuance \nof credit cards.  \n \n10.5 The targets for the same may be decided at U LB level and the progress under \nthis component is aggregated at SULM l evel and communicated to M inistry of  Housing \nand Urban Affairs (MoHUA)  periodically.  \n \n11. Technology, Marketing and Other Support  \n \n11.1 Micro entrepreneurs often need support in order to grow and sustain their \nbusinesses. Support needed may be for establishment, technology, marketing, and other services. Micro entrepreneurs who run very small businesses may need to gain a better understanding of what the market needs, demand of the products produc ed by \nthem, prices, where to sell, etc. Support services under this component are envisaged with a view to provide an encouraging environment for development of micro enterprises.  \n    \n13 \n 11.2 The City Livelihoods Centers (CLCs) established under DAY -NULM will offer \nservices to the micro- enterprises such as in establishment (licenses, certificates \nregistration, legal services etc.), production, procurement, technology, processing, \nmarketing, sales, packaging, accounting etc. for long term sustainability. CLC s will also  \nprovide support in taking up feasibility/ assessment studies on market demand and \nmarket strategy for products and services of micro- enterprises.  \n \n11.3 All SEP individual and groups enterprises can avail the services from CLCs as \nper the norms of CLCs. The CLCs with support of ULB may also tie up with various \nother government schemes which offer services and benefits for micro- enterprise \ndevelopment for the benefit of prospective beneficiaries.  \n 11.4 The SULM may arrange for additional funds/professional assistance for the \npurpose of providing above services to CLCs.  \n \n12. Funding Pattern of SEP of DAY -NULM  \n12.1 Funding under this component will be shared between the Centre and the States \nas per the general norms under DAY -NULM.  \n \n12.2 The Ministry will allocate funds to the states on annual basis based on the targets \nassigned to the states. The states in consultation with the respective SLBCs and ULBs \nwill decide the targets and corresponding funds will be allocated to ULBs so that full \nreimbursement to the banks on account of I nterest subvention is settled during the \nfinancial year and no subvention amount remain overdue or pending with the States.  \n \n13. Monitoring and Evaluation \n13.1 The S tate Mission management Unit (SMMU)  at the State level and C ity Mission \nManagement Unit (CMMU)  at the ULB level will closely monitor progress of activities / \ntargets under this component, undertake reporting and evaluation. The SULM and the ULB/executing agencies shall report timely progress in formats prescribed by the Mission Directorate from time- to-time, indicating the cumulative achievement monthly \nand up to the end of the quarter and key issues in implementation.  \n \n13.2 In addition, under DAY -NULM, a comprehensive and robust IT -enabled DAY -\nNULM MIS will be established for tracking targets and achievements. States and ULBs will be required to submit their progress reports online and may also use this tool to monitor progress on the ground. In the spirit of proactive disclosure of information and \nensuring transparency under DAY -NULM, key progress  reports under SEP will also be \nmade available in the public domain in a timely manner.  \n    \n14 \n 13.3 All the SEP beneficiaries should be visited periodically to assess the impact of \nthe benefit and also to know any problem being faced by them.  The Community \nOrganisers  (COs) should visit all the beneficiaries in their jurisdiction at least once in \nthree months.  The project officer/ technical experts at CMMU level should visit at least \n50% beneficiaries once in three months.  The observations during the field visit should  \nbe kept in record and be uploaded on MIS also.  \n \n13.4 During the field visit mentioned above data on economic status of the \nbeneficiaries should be collected and be compared with similar data given in loan \napplication form, to know the impact of the benefit on the economic conditions of the beneficiaries.  \n \n13.5 Impact analysis studies may also be conducted at suitable interval to assess the \nimpact of benefit under SEP on the economic status of the beneficiaries.  \n \n13.6 To monitor progress of the targets vis -a-vis achievement under DAY -NULM, \nBanks are advised to furnish cumulative progress reports on quarterly basis as per \nenclosed proforma ( Annex I  & II) to the Director,  NULM  as well as to RBI on email  latest \nby the end of next month of the quarter to which they relate.  \n \n13.7 Unique Code for loans under NULM:  Banks are advised to categorise these \nloans under Non- Farm sector and use unique sub-code in their database for loans \ngranted under NULM. Further, separate sub- sub-codes may also be assigned for SEP -I, \nSEP- G, SHG and WSHGs. Proper care must be taken while classifying loans under \nNULM parti cularly relating to SHG and WSHGs  to enable distinct identificati on of these \nloans vis -\u00e0-vis NRLM loans as WSHGs are eligible for additional 3 percent interest \nsubvention.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n15 \n             ANNEX I  \nStatement showing Target under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana \u2013   \nNational Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY -NULM)  \n \nName of the Bank  \n    (To be furnished at the time of target allocation)  \nReporting year  \n \n        No in Actual & Amount in Rs lakh  \n \n   \n16 \n                 ANNEX II \n Quarterly Statement showing Cumulative Progress under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana \u2013             \n National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY -NULM) \n \n NAME OF THE BANK  \n REPORTING YEAR \n REPORTING QUARTER                                                                                                                      No of Ac/s in Actual and Amt in Rs.Lakhs  \n \n   \n17 \n Appendix  \n \n \n   \n \n  No. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

Please do not respond in any manner to such offers.  \n \n \n2 \n Master Circular  - Credit Facilities to Scheduled Castes (SCs) & Scheduled Tribes (STs)  \n \nBanks should take the following measures to step up their advances to SCs / STs:  \n \n \n1. Planning Process  \n \n1.1 The District Level Consultative Committees formed under the Lead Bank Scheme should \ncontinue to be the principal mechanism of co- ordination between banks and development \nagencies in this regard.  \n \n1.2 The district credit plans formulated by the lead banks should clearly indicate the linkage \nof credit with employment and development schemes.  \n \n1.3 Banks will have to establish closer liaison with the District Industries Centres, which have \nbeen set up in different districts for promoting self -employment.  \n \n1.4 At the block level, a certain weightage is to be given to scheduled castes / scheduled tribes \nin the planning process. Accordingly, the credit planning should be weighted in favour of \nscheduled castes / scheduled tribes and special bankable schemes suited to members of \nthese communities should be drawn up to ensure their participation in such schemes and \nlarger flow of credit to them for self -employment. It will be necessary for the banks to consider \nloan proposals of these communities with utmost sympathy and understanding.  \n \n1.5 Banks should periodically review their lending procedures and policies to see that loans \nare sanctioned in time, are adequate and production- oriented and that they generate \nincremental income to make them self -liquidating.  \n \n1.6 Whil e 'adopting' villages for intensive lending, villages with sizeable population of these \ncommunities may be specially chosen; the alternative of adopting specific localities (bastis) in \nthe concerned villages which have a concentration of these communities could also be \nconsidered.  \n \n2. Role of Banks  \n \n2.1 Bank staff may help the poor borrowers in filling up the forms and completing other \nformalities so that they are able to get credit facility within a stipulated period from the date of \nreceipt of applications.  \n \n2.2 In order to encourage SC / ST borrowers to take advantage of credit facilities, greater \nawareness among them about various schemes formulated by banks will have to be created. As a majority of the eligible borrowers would be illiterate persons, public ity through brochures, \nother literature, etc. will be of limited utility. The more desirable method would be for the field staff of banks to contact such borrowers and explain to them the salient features of the schemes as also the advantages that will acc rue. Banks should advise their branches to  \n \n3 \n organize meetings more frequently exclusively for SC / ST beneficiaries to understand their \ncredit needs and to incorporate the same in the credit plan.  \n \n2.3 Circulars issued by RBI / NABARD should be circulated a mong the staff for compliance.  \n \n2.4 Banks should not insist on deposits while considering loan applications under Government \nsponsored poverty alleviation schemes / self -employment programmes from borrowers \nbelonging to SCs / STs. It should also be ensured that applicable subsidy is not held back \nwhile releasing the loan component till the full repayment of bank dues. Non-release of subsidy \nupfront amounts to under -financing and hampers asset creation / income generation.  \n \n2.5 The National Scheduled Tribes Finance & Development Corporation and National \nScheduled Castes Finance & Development Corporation have been set up under the \nadministrative control of Ministry of Tribal Affairs and Ministry of Social Justice & \nEmpowerment, respectively. The banks should a dvise their branches / controlling offices to \nrender all the necessary institutional support to enable the institution to achieve the desired objectives.  \n \n2.6 Advances sanctioned to State sponsored organizations of SC / ST, for the specific purpose \nof purc hase and supply of inputs to and / or the marketing of outputs of the beneficiaries viz. \nartisans, village and cottage industries of  these organizations, should be treated as Priority \nSector Advances, subject to the condition that the relative advances are exclusively for the \npurpose of purchase and supply of inputs to and / or marketing of the outputs of beneficiaries of these organizations.  \n \n2.7 Rejection of loan applications in respect of SCs / STs should be done at the next higher \nlevel instead of at the branch level and reasons of rejection should be clearly indicated.  \n \n3. Role of SC / ST Development Corporations  \n \nThe Government of India has advised all State Governments that the Scheduled Caste/ Tribes \nDevelopment Corporations can consider bankable schemes / proposals for bank finance. As regards Collateral Security and / or third-party  guarantee for loans, guideli nes issued to banks \non priority sector lending will apply.  \n \n4. Reservations for SC / ST Beneficiaries under Major Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  \n \nThere are several major centrally sponsored schemes under which credit is provided by banks \nand subsidy is received through Government Agencies. Credit flow under these schemes is \nmonitored by RBI. Under each of these, there is a significant reservation / relaxation for the members of the SC / ST communities.  \n \n  \n \n4 \n  \n(i) Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods M ission:  \n \nThe Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India has launched Deendayal Antyodaya \nYojana- National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY -NRLM) by restructuring erstwhile \nSwarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana, effective from April 01, 2013.

In order to ensure that persons belonging to SCs / STs also \nderive adequate benefit under the Differential Rate of Interest (DRI) Scheme, banks have \nbeen advised to grant to eligible borrowers belonging to SCs  / STs such advances to the \nextent of not less than 2/5th (40 percent) of total DRI advances. Further, the eligibility criteria under DRI that size of land holding should not exceed 1 acre of irrigated land and 2.5 acres \nof unirrigated land are not applicable to SCs / STs.

Monitoring and Review  \n \n6.1 A special cell should be set up at the Head Office of banks for monitoring the flow of credit \nto SC / ST beneficiaries. Apart from ensuring the implementation of the RBI guidelines, the \ncell would also be responsible for collection of relevant information / data from the branches, \nconsolidation thereof and submission of the requisite returns to RBI and Government.  \n \n6.2 SLBC convenor Bank  should invite the representative of National Commission for SCs / \nSTs to attend SLBC meetings.

R. Gadgil (Gadgil Study Group) on the O rganizational  Framework \nfor the Implementation of the S ocial Objectives, which submitted its report in October \n1969. The Study Group drew attention to the fact that commercial banks did not \nhave adequate presence in rural areas and also lacked the required rural orientation. The Study Group, therefore, recommended the adoption of an 'Area Approach' to \nevolve plans and programmes for the development of an adequate banking and \ncredit structure in the rural areas.  \n(ii)  A Committee of Bankers on Branch Expansion Programme of P ublic Sector \nBanks appointed by the Reserve Bank of India under the Chairmanship of Shri F. K. \nF. Nariman (Nariman Committee) endorsed the idea of an  \u2018Area Approach\u2019  in its \nreport (November 1969) , recommending that in order to enable the P ublic Sector \nBanks to discharge their social responsibilities, each bank should concentrate on \ncertain districts where it should act as a 'Lead Bank'.       \n(iii)  Pu rsuant to the above recommendations, the Lead Bank Scheme was \nintroduced by the Reserve Bank of India in December 1969. The Scheme aims at \ncoordinating the activities of banks and other developmental agencies through \nvarious fora in order to achieve the obj ective of enhancing the flow of bank finance to  \nthe priority sector and other sectors and to promote banks ' role in the overall \ndevelopment of the rural sector. For  coordinating the activities in the district, a \nparticular bank is assigned \u2018L ead Bank\u2019 responsibility of the district. The Lead Bank \nis expected to assume a leadership role for coordinating the efforts of the credit \ninstitutions and the Government.    \n(iv)  In view of the several changes that had taken place in the financial sector, the \nLead Bank Scheme was last reviewed by the High Level Committee headed by Smt . \nUsha Thorat, the then Deputy Governor  of the Reserve Bank of India in 2009.   \n(v)  The High Level Committee held wide ranging discussions with various \nstakeholders viz. State Governments, banks, development institutions, academicians, NGOs, MFIs etc. and noted that the Scheme has been useful in \nachieving its original objectives of improvement in branch expansion, deposit mobilisation and lending to the priority sector, especially in rural/semi urban areas.  5 \n \nThere was overwhelming consensus that the Scheme needs to continue. Based on \nthe recommendations of the Committee, the guidelines were issued to SLBC \nConvenor  banks  and Lead B anks for implementation.  \n \n(vi) Envisaging  greater role for private sector banks,  Lead B anks were advised to \nensure that private sector banks are more closely involved in the implementation of \nthe Lead Bank Scheme.  Private  sector banks should involve themselves more \nactively by leveraging on Information Technology bringing in their expertise in \nstrategic planning. They  should also involve themselves in the preparation as well as \nimplementation of  the District Credit Plan.  \n \n(vii)  In view of the changes that  have taken place in  the financial sector over the \nyears, the Reserve Bank of India had constituted a \u201cCommittee of Executive \nDirectors\u201d of the Bank to study the efficacy of the Scheme and suggest measures for its improvement. Based on the Committee\u2019s recommendations and feedback \nreceived from various stakeholders, certain \u2018action points\u2019 were issued to SLBC \nConvenors/Lead Banks and NABARD on April 6, 2018.  \n \n2.  Fora under Lead Bank Scheme \n2.1     Block Level Banker s\u2019 Committee (BLBC)  \nBlock Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) is a forum for achieving coordinati on \nbetween credit institutions and field level development agencies at the block level . \nThe forum prepares and reviews  the implementation of the Block Credit Plan and \nalso resolves operational problems in the implementation of the credit programmes \nof banks. The Lead District Manager (LDM) of the district is the Chairman of the \nBlock Level Bankers\u2019 Committee. All the banks operat ing in the block including the \nSmall Finance Banks , Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks , RRBs, \nthe D istrict Central  Co-operative Banks , Block Development Officer, technical \nofficers in the block, such as extension officers for agriculture, industries and co-\noperatives are members of the Committee. BLBC meetings are held at quarterly \nintervals.  To strengthen the BLBC forum which operates at the base level of the \nLead Bank Scheme, it is necessary that all branch managers attend BLBC meetings and enrich the discussions with their valuable inputs. Controlling Heads of banks may also attend a few of the BLBC meetings selectively. Participation by the District 6 \n \nDevelopment Manager (DDM) of NABARD in BLBCs would ensure better and more \nmeaningful discussions for the development of the Block. Therefore, NABARD has \nbeen advised that  DDMs should  attend all Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee meetings \nin their district and actively participate in the credit planning exercise and review \nmeetings at the block level.  The Lead District Officer ( LDO) of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia ( RBI) selectively attends the BLBC meeting s. The representatives of \nPanchayat Samitis are also invited to attend the meetings at half yearly intervals so \nas to share their knowledge and experience on rural development in the credit planning exercise. Payments Banks should also be invited to attend the meetings.  \n \n2.2 District Consultative Committee (DCC)  \n  \n2.2.1 Constitution of DCC  \nThe District Consultative Committees  were constituted in the early seventies  as a \ncommon forum at the district level for bankers as well as Government \nagencies/departments to facilitate  coordination in implementing various \ndevelopmental activities under the Lead Bank Scheme. The District Collector is the \nChairman of the DCC meetings. Reserve Bank of India,  NABARD, all the \ncommercial banks including Small Finance Banks , Wholly  Owned Subsidiaries \n(WOS) of Foreign Banks, RRBs, Payments Banks,  Co-operative banks including the \nDistrict Central Cooperative Bank (DCCB),  various State Government departments \nand allied agencies are the members of the DCC.  The Lead District Officer (LDO) \nrepresents the Reserve Bank as a member of the DCC.  The Lead District Manager \n(LDM) convenes the DCC meetings. The Director of Micro,  Small and Medium \nEnterprises Development Insti tute (MSME -DI) in the district is an invitee in districts \nwhere MSME clusters are located to discuss issues concerning MSMEs.  \n2.2.2 Conduct of DCC Meetings  \ni) DCC meeting s should be convened by the L ead Banks at quarterly intervals.  \nii) At the DCC level, sub- committees as appropriate,  may be set up to work \nintensively on specific issues and submit reports to the DCC for its consideration.  \niii) DCC should give adequate feedback to the SLBC on various issues that need to \nbe discussed on a wider platform, so that these receive adequate attention at the \nState Level.  \n 7 \n \n2.2.3 Agenda for DCC Meetings  \n \nWhile Lead Banks are expected to address the problems particular to the concerned \ndistricts, some of the important areas which are common to all districts which the \nlead banks should invariably discus s in the fora are as under:  \ni) Review of progress under F inancial Inclusion Plan (FIP).  \nii) The specific issues inhibiting and enabling IT enabled financial inclusion  \niii) Issues  to facilitate 'enablers' and remove/ minimise  'impeders' for banking \ndevelopment for inc lusive growth  \niv) Monitoring initiatives for providing 'Credit Plus' activities by banks and State \nGovernments such as setting up of Financial Literacy Centres  (FLCs) and \nRSETI# type Training Institutes for providing skills and capacity building to \nmanage businesses.  \nv) Scaling up financial literacy efforts to achieve financial inclusion.  \nvi) Review of performance of banks under District Credit Plan (DCP)  \nvii) Flow  of credit to priority s ector and weaker sections of the society  \nviii) Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022  \nix) Assistance under Government sponsored schemes  \nx) Grant of educational loans  \nxi) Progress under SHG -  bank linkage  \nxii) SME financing & bottlenecks thereof, if any  \nxiii) Timely submission of data by banks  \nxiv) Review of relief measures (in case of natural calamities wherever applicable)  \nThe above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. The L ead Banks may include any \nother agenda item considered necessary.  \n \n# Rural Self Emplo yment Training Institutes (RSETIs) should be more actively \ninvolved and monitored at various fora of LBS particularly at the DCC level. Focus \nshould be on develop ment of skills to enhance the credit absorption capacity in the \narea and renewing the training programmes towards sustainable micro enterprises. \nRSETIs should design specific programmes for each dis trict/ block, keeping in view \nthe skill mapping and the potential of the region for  necessary  skill training and skill \nup gradation of the rural youth in the district.  \n  8 \n \n \n2.2.4 Role of LDMs  \n \nAs the effectiveness of the Lead Bank Scheme depends on the dynam ism of the \nDistrict Collectors and the Lead District Managers (LDMs), with supportive role of the \nRegional/Zonal Office, the office of LDM should be s ufficiently strengthened with \nappropriate infrastructural support being the focal point for  the successful  \nimplementation of the Lead Bank Scheme. Apart from the provision of a separate \noffice space, technical infrastructure like computers, printer, data connectivity, etc. \nwhich are basic necessities for LDMs to discharge their core responsibilities may be \nprovided to LDMs\u2019 Office without exception.  Offic ers of appropriate level , attitude \nand possessing requisite leadership skills should be posted as LDMs. Additionally, it \nis suggested that a dedicated vehicle may be provided to LDMs\u2019 to facilitate closer \nliaison with the bank officials, district administr ation officials as also to organise/ \nattend various financial literacy initiatives and meetings. The absence of a specialist officer/assistant for data entry/analysis is a common and major  issue faced by LDMs. \nLiberty to hire the services of skilled comput er operator may be given to the LDMs to \novercome the shortage of staff/ in case appropriate staff is not posted at LDM office .  \nFurther, for successful functioning of the Lead Bank Scheme, we expect Lead Banks  \nto go the extra mile to provide facilities over and above the bare minimum to these critical field functionaries. Apart from the usual role of LDMs like convening meetings \nof the DCC/DLRC and periodical meetings of DDM/  LDO/ Government officials for \nresol ving outstanding issues etc., the new functions envisaged for LDMs include the \nfollowing:  \ni) Monitoring the implementation of the D istrict Credit Plan  \nii) Associate with the setting up of Financial Lit eracy Centres (FLCs), RSETIs by \nbanks  \niii) Associate with organizing financial literacy camps by FLCs and rural branches \nof banks.  \niv) Holding annual sensitisation workshops for banks and Government officials \nwith participation by NGOs/Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)  \nv) Arranging for quarterly awareness and feedback  public meetings, grievance \nredressal etc.  \n \n 9 \n \n2.2.5 Quarterly Public Meeting and Grievance Redressal  \nThe Lead District Manager should convene a quarterly public meeting at various \nlocations in the district in coordination with the LDO of Reserve Bank, banks hav ing \npresence in the area and other stakeholders to generate awareness of the various \nbanking policies and regulations relating to the common person, obtain feedback \nfrom the public and provide grievance redressal to the extent possible at such \nmeetings or facilitate approaching the appropriate machinery for such redressal.  \n \n2.2.6 District Level Review Committee (DLRC) Meetings \nDLRC meetings are Chaired by the District Collector and attended by members of \nthe District Consultative Committee (DCC).  Public Representatives i.e. Local  \nMPs/MLAs/ Zilla Parishad Chiefs are also invited to these meetings.  The DLRC \nmeetings should be convened by the L ead Banks at  least once in a quarter.  The \nDLRC is a forum to review the pace and quality of the implementation of various \nprogrammes under the Lead Bank Scheme in the district . Hence,  association of non-\nofficials is considered useful. Lead Banks are required to ensure the presence of \npublic representatives in DLRC meetings as far as possible. Therefore, L ead B anks \nshould fix the date of DLRC meetings with due regard to the convenience of the \nrepresentatives of the public i.e. MPs/MLAs etc. and invite and involve them in all functions conducted by the banks in the districts, such as opening of new bank ing \noutlets , distribution of Kisan Credit Cards, SHG credit linkage programmes , etc. \nResponses to queries from public representatives need to be accorded highest \npriority and attended to promptly. The follow up of the DLRC\u2019s decisions is required \nto be discussed in the DCC meetings.   \n2.2.7 DCC/DLRC meetings - Annual Calendar of Meetings  \ni) DCC and DLRC are the important fora facilitating coordination among commercial \nbanks, Government agencies and others at the district level to review and find \nsolutions to the problems hindering developmental activities. Therefore, it is \nnecessary that all the members participate and deliberate in these  meetings. On a \nreview of the DCC/DLRC meetings, it was observed that late receipt/non- receipt of \nintimation of the date of meetings, clash of dates with other events, commonality of \ndates etc. , hinder participation of members in these meetings, thus undermining the \nprime objective of conducting the above meetings.  10 \n \nii)   Lead B anks have, therefore, been advised to prepare an Annual S chedule of \nDCC and DLRC meetings on Calendar year basis for all districts in consultation with \nthe Chairperson of the meetings, L ead District Officer of the RBI and P ublic \nRepresentatives in case of DLRC.  This yearly Calendar should be prepared in the \nbeginning of each year and circulated to all members as advance intimation for \nblocking future dates to attend the DCC and DLRC meetings and the meetings \nshould be conducted as per the calendar.  While preparing the Calendar , it should be \nensured that DCC and DLRC meetings are not  held simultaneously.  \n  \n2.3 State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)  \n  \n2.3.1 Constitution of SLBC  \n i) The State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) was  constituted in April 1977, as an \napex inter -institutional forum to create adequate coordination machinery in all States, \non a uniform basis for development of the State. SLBC is chaired by the Chairman/ \nManaging Director / Executive Director of the C onvenor Bank. It comprises \nrepresentatives of commercial banks  including Small Finance Banks , Wholly Owne d \nSubsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks, RRBs,  Payments Banks,  State Cooperative \nBanks, RBI, NABARD, heads of Government departments including representatives from National Commission for Scheduled Castes/Tribes, National Horticulture Board, \nKhadi & Village Industries Commission etc. and representatives of financial \ninstitutions operating in a State, who come together and sort out coordination problems at the policy implementation level.  Representatives of various \norganizations from different sectors of the economy like industry bodies, retail \ntraders, exporters , farmers\u2019 unions,  etc. are special invitees in the SLBC meetings for \ndiscussing their specific problems, if any. SLBC meetings are held on quarterly basis. The responsibility for  convening the SLBC meetings would be of the SLBC \nConvenor Bank of the State.  \n \nii) Recognising that SLBCs, primarily as a committee of bankers at the State level , \nplay an important role in the development of the State, illustrative guidelines on the \nconduct of State Level Bank ers\u2019 Committee meetings have been issued.  \n2.3.2 Conduct of SLBC Meetings  \ni)  SLBC meetings are required to be held regularly at quarterly intervals.  The \nmeetings are chaired by the Chairman / Managing Director / Executive Director of the 11 \n \nConvenor Bank and co-chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary or Development \nCommissioner of the State concerned.  In  cases  where the Managing Director/Chief  \nExecutive  Officer/Executive  Director of the SLBC  Convenor  Bank  is unable to attend  \nSLBC Meetings,  the Regional  Director  of the RBI shall co-chair  the meetings  along  \nwith the Additional  Chief  Secretary/Development  Commissioner  of the State  \nconcerned.  A High Level of participation in SLBC/UTLBC meetings ensures an \neffective and desired outcome with meaningful discussion on issues of publi c policy \nof both the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India.  \nii)  The Chief Minister/Finance Minister and senior level officers of the State/RBI (of \nthe rank of Deputy Governor / Executive Director) may be invited to attend the SLBC meetings.  Further, the State Chief Ministers are encouraged to attend at least one \nSLBC meeting in a year.  \n \niii)  State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee meetings should primarily focus on policy issues \nwith participation of only the senior functionaries of  the banks/ Government \nDepartments.  All routine issues may be delegated to sub- committee(s) of the SLBC.  \nA Steering Sub- committee may be constituted in the SLBC to deliberate on agenda \nproposals from different stakeholders and finalise a compact agenda for the SLBC \nmeetings. Typically, the Sub- Committee could consist of SLBC Convenor, RBI & \nNABARD representatives & senior State Government representative from the \nconcerned department, e.g. Finance/ Institutional Finance and two to three banks \nhaving major presence.  \n \niv) Other issue- specific sub -committees may be constituted as required.  The sub \ncommittees may examine the specific issues  relating to agriculture, micro, \nsmall/medium industries/enterprises, handloom finance, export promotion and \nfinancial in clusion, etc.  in-depth and devise solutions/recommendations for adoption \nby the full committee. They are expected to meet more frequently than the SLBC. \nThe composition of the sub- committee s and subjects/ specific issues \nimpeding/enabling financial inclusi on to be deliberated upon, may vary from State to \nState depending on the specific problems/issues faced by the States.  \n \nv)   The secretariat/offices of the SLBC should be sufficiently strengthened to enable \nthe SLBC Convenor Bank to effectively discharge its functions.  \n 12 \n \nvi)  The various fora at lower levels may give adequate feedback to the SLBC on \nissues that need to be discussed on a wider platform.  \n \nvii)   Several institutions and academicians are engaged in research,  studies etc. that \nhave implicat ions for sustainable development in agriculture and MSME sector. \nEngaging with such research institutions and academicians would be useful in \nbringing in new ideas for furthering the objectives of the Lead Bank Scheme. The \nSLBCs may, therefore, identify such academicians and researchers and invite them as 'special invitees' to attend SLBC meetings occasionally both for adding value to \nthe discussions and also associate them with studies appropriate to the State. Other \n'special invitees' may be invited to at tend SLBC meetings depending on the agenda \nitems/issues to be discussed in the meetings.  \n \nviii)  The activities of NGOs in facilitating and channelling credit to the low income \nhouseholds are expected to increase in the coming years. Several corporate houses are also engaged in corporate social responsibility activities for sustainable \ndevelopment. A linkage with such NGOs/Corporate houses operating in the area to \nensure that the NGOs/corporates provide the necessary 'credit plus' services can \nhelp leverage bank credit for inclusive growth. Success stories could be presented in \nSLBC meetings to serve as models that could be replicated.  \n  \n2.3.3 Revised Agenda for SLBC Meetings \n \n1.

Any other item, w ith the permission of the Chair . \n \nThe above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. SLBC Convenor Banks may include \nany other agenda item considered necessary.  \n 15 \n \n2.3.4   SLBC - Yearly Calendar of Meetings \n \ni)  To improve the effectiveness and streamline  the functioning of SLBC/UTLBC \nmeetings, SLBC Convenor  Banks have been advised to prepare a yearly calendar of \nprogramme s (calendar year basis) in the beginning of the year itself, for conducting \nthe meetings. The calendar of programmes should clearly specify the cut off dates \nfor data submission to SLBC and acceptance thereof by the SLBC Convenor. This \nyearly calendar should be circulated to all the concerned as an advance intimation \nfor blocking of future dates of senior functionaries of various agencies like Central \nGovernment , State Governments, banks, RBI , etc. The SLBC/UTLBC meetings \nshould be conducted as per the calendar under all circumstances. The agenda \nshould also be circulated in advance without waiting for the data from defaulting \nbanks. The matter should, however, be taken up with the defaulting banks in the SLBC meeting. In addition, the SLBC Convenor  Bank should write a letter in this \nregard to the controlling office of the defaulting banks under advice to the Regional \nOffice of RBI. The SLBC Convenor Bank will, however, continue to follow -up with \nbanks for timely data submission. Further, in case the Chief Minister, Finance \nMinister or other very senior functionaries are not able to attend the SLBC on some \nvery rare occasion, then if so desired by them, a special SLBC meeting can be held.  \nFollowing broad guidelines should be used for preparation of the calendar of \nprogrammes:   \nActivity  To be completed by (Date)  \nPrepa ration of calendar of SLBC/UTLBC \nmeetings and intimation to all the concerned of \nthe cut -off dates for submission of data and dates \nof meetings as per the dateline given below.  15th January  every year  \nReminder regarding the exact date of meeting \nand submi ssion of data by banks to SLBC  15 days before end of the quarter  \nDead line for receipt of information/data by SLBC \nConvenor Bank 15 days from the end of the quarter  \nDistribution of agenda cum background papers  20 days from the end of the quarter  \nHolding  of the meeting  \n Within 45 days from the end of the \nquarter  \nForwarding the minutes of the meeting to all \nstakeholders  Within 10 days from holding the \nmeeting \nFollow -up of the action points emerged from the \nmeeting To be completed within 30 days of \nforwarding the minutes (for review in \nthe next meeting)  16 \n \n      \nii)   The objective of preparing the calendar of meetings in the beginning of the year \nis to ensure adequate notice of these meetings and timely compilation and dispatch \nof agenda papers to all stakeholders. It also ensures clear cut guidelines for the \nsubmission of data to SLBC C onvenors by participating banks & Government \nDepartments. It is expected to save precious time of SLBC C onvenors otherwise \nspent in taking dates from various senior functionaries attending these SLBC meetings.  \niii)  SLBC C onvenor Banks  need to appreciate the advantages of ensuring \nadherence to the yearly calendars.  SLBC C onvenor Banks have therefore been \nadvised to give wide publicity to the annual calendar at the beginning of the year and \nensure that dates of senior functionaries expected to attend the meetings are \nblocked for all meetings by their offices.  In case, despite blocking dates, if for some \nreason, the senior functionary is not able to attend the meeting, the meeting should \nbe held as planned in the calendar.  More importantly, the data for review in thes e \nmeetings should be received as per deadlines set in the calendar and those who do \nnot submit the data in time should be asked to explain the reasons for delay in \nsending the data that may be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Under no \ncircumstance , should the preparation of the agenda be delayed beyond the dates \nstipulated as per the calendar.  \n2.3.5 SLBC Website \u2013 Standardisation of information /data \n \nSLBC Convenor  Banks are required to maintain the SLBC websites where all \ninstructions pertaining to LBS and Government Sponsored Schemes are made \navailable and are accessible to the common man desiring any information relating to \nthe conduct of meetings or State- wise data/ bank-wise performance. In order to \nstandardize the information and data that is to be made available on the SLBC \nwebsite, an indicative list of the information & data is given in the Annex II\n.  SLBCs \nshould arrange to place the prescribed minimum information on the websites of \nSLBCs of their bank and keep it updated regularly, at least on quarterly basis. Banks \nmay note that the list is only indicative and SLBCs are free to put any additional information considered relevant for the State.  \n  17 \n \n2.3.6 Liaison with State Government  \n \nSLBC Convenor  Banks are expected to co- ordinate the activities of all banks in the \nState, discuss with S tate Government officials , the operational problems in lending, \nextending necessary support for  banking development and to achieve the objective \nof financial inclusion.  \n2.3.7 Capacity Building/Training/Sensitization Programmes  \n \ni) There is a need for sensitising the District Collectors and CEOs of Zilla Parishads \non bank s and banking in general as also on the specific scope and role of the Lead \nBank Scheme. In each State, a full day \u2018Sensitisation W orkshop\u2019  may be convened \nby the SLBC Convenor  Bank every y ear, preferably in April/May . Such sensitisation \nshould form part of the probationary training of such officers. Further, as soon as \nthey are posted in a district, the SLBC may arrange for exposure visits for the District \nCollectors to the SLBC C onvenor\u2019s office for sensitisation and understanding of the \nLead Bank Scheme.   \nii) Staff at the operational level of banks and government agencies associated with \nimplementation of the Lead Bank Scheme need to be aware of the latest \ndevelopments and emerging opportunities. There is need for staff sensitisation/ \ntraining/seminars, etc. at periodic intervals on an ongoing basis . \n \n3. Implementation of Lead Bank Scheme  \n3.1 Preparation of credit plans  \nPlanning plays an important role in the implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme \nand a bottom -up approach is adopted to map the existing potential for development.  \nUnder LBS, planning starts with identifying block -wise/  activity -wise potential \nestimated for various sectors.  \n3.2 Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs)  \ni) Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) are a step towards decentralized credit \nplanning with the basic objective of mapping the existing potential for development \nthrough bank credit. PLPs take into account the long term physical potential, \navailability of infrastructure support, marketing facilities, and policies/programmes of 18 \n \nGovernment etc.  NABARD to take measures  to ensure that PLPs should be more \nfocussed and implementable so that banks can utilize them  more gainfully while \npreparing the Branch Credit Plan. PLPs should emphasise on promotion of \nsustainable agricultural practices suitable to local conditions. While preparing the \nPLPs, the focus must be on identifying processes and projects that :  \na. reduce the carbon foot -print,  \nb. prevent the overuse of fertilizers,  \nc. ensure efficient utilisation of water and  \nd. address agricultural pollution issues.  \n \nThe plans must also focus on promoting innovative farming systems such as organic \nfarming, bio dynamic farming, permaculture and sustainable small -scale  farming, as \nalso promoting Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs)  and Farmers\u2019 Markets. Such \ninitiatives must be supported by appropriate investments and project finance \nframeworks. \n \nii) A pre -PLP meeting is convened by LDM during June every year to be attended by \nbanks, Government agencies, etc., to reflect their views and concerns regarding \ncredit potential (sector/activity -wise) and deliberate on major financial and socio-\neconomic developments in the district in the last one year and priorities to be set out for inclusion in the PLP.  The DDM of NABARD make s a presentation in this meeting \noutlining the major requirements of information for preparing the PLP for the \nfollowing year. The preparation of PLP for the next year is to be completed by August every year to enable t he State Government to factor in the PLP projections.   \niii) The procedure for preparing the District Credit Plan is as follows:  \na) Controlling Offices of commercial banks  including Small Finance Banks , \nWholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) of F oreign Banks  and Head Office of RRB \nand DCCB/LDB circulate the accepted block -wise/ac tivity-wise potential to all \ntheir branches for preparing the Branch Credit Plans (BCP) by their respective branch managers.  Banks should ensure that the exercise of preparation of branch/block plans is completed in time by all branches so that the Credit  \nPlans become operational on time.  19 \n \nb) A special Block Level Bankers' Committee (BLBC) meeting is  convened for \neach block where the Branch Credit Plans are discussed and aggregated to \nform the Block Credit Plan.  The DDM and the LDM guide the BLBC in \nfinalizing the plan,  ensuring that the Block Credit Plan is in tune with the \npotentials identified activity -wise including in respect of Government \nSponsored Schemes .   \n \nc) All the Block Credit Plans of the district are  aggregated by the LDM to form \nthe District Credit Plan  (DCP) . This plan indicates an analytical assessment of \nthe credit needs of the district to be deployed by all the financial institutions \noperating in the district and the total quantum of funds to be earmarked as \ncredit by all the financial institutions for a new financial year.  The \nZonal/Controlling Offices of banks, while finalizing their business plans for the \nyear, should take into account the commitments made in the DCP which shoul d be ready well in time before the performance budgets are finalized.   \n \nd) The District Credit Plan is then placed before the DCC by the Lead District \nManager for final acceptance/approval.  All the District Credit Plans are eventually aggregated into a State Level Credit Plan to be prepared by SLBC \nConvenor B ank and launched by the 1st of April every year.   \n \ne) The corporate business targets for branches, blocks, districts and states may be aligned with the Annual Credit Plans (ACP) to ensure better implementation. The Controlling Offices of the banks in each state should synchronize their inter nal business plans with the ACP.  \n3.3   Monitoring the Performance of C redit Plans \nThe performance of the credit plans is reviewed in the v arious fora created under the \nLead Bank Scheme as shown below:  \nAt Block Level  Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC)  \nAt District Level  District Consultative Committee (DCC) & District \nLevel Review Committee (DLRC)  \nAt State Level  State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)  \n                                                        \n 20 \n \nMonitoring of LBS by RBI  - Monitoring Information System (MIS)  \ni)  Data on Annual Credit Plan (ACP)  is an important element to review the flow of \ncredit in the State.  ACP formats are aligned with  the extant reporting guidelines on \npriority sector lending. Accordingly, the ACP is to be prepared considering the \ncategories of priority sector that would include Agriculture, Micro, Small and Medium \nEnterprises, Export Credit, Education,  Housing, Social  Infrastructure, Renewable \nEnergy and Others.  Further, it has been decided that bank loans to Micro/Small and \nMedium Enterprises (Services), engaged in providing or rendering of services as defined in terms of investment in equipment under MSMED Act, 2006, shall qualify \nunder priority sector without any credit cap.  The reporting statement for ACP target \nis LBS- MIS-I (Annex I V\n), statement for disbursement and outstanding LBS -MIS-II \n(Annex V ) and ACP achievement vis -\u00e0-vis ACP target , LBS- MIS-III (Annex VI).  \nSLBC Convenor B anks/ Lead Banks have been advised to prepare the statements \nLBS MIS I, II and III as per the revised formats starting from the financial year 2018-\n19.  They should prepare the bank group wise statements of LBS- MIS-I, II and III as \nper the prescribed formats and also place these statements for meaningful review in  \nall DCC and SLBC meetings.  \nii)  In order to maintain consistency and integrity of data with the A ll-India data of \nscheduled commercial banks and facilitate a meaningful review/analysis of data, the \nACP data needs to be grouped separately for scheduled commercial banks and \nother banks like State Cooperative B anks , DCCBs , etc. while presenting in the \nDCC/SLBC meetings and submitting to our R egional Offices.  The data pertaining to \nscheduled commercial banks needs to be further grouped into public sector banks, private sector banks , Regional Rural Banks , Small Finance Banks  and Whol ly \nOwned Subsidiaries (WOS) of F oreign Banks  to know the bank group wise position.   \n3.4   Revised mechanism of  Data Flow for LBS fora meetings \n \nAt present, discussions at the quarterly meetings of the various LBS fora viz. State \nLevel Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC), District level Consultative Committee (DCC) and \nBlock  Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) primarily focus on the performance of \nbanks in the disbursement of loans vis -a-vis the allocated target under the Annual \nCredit Plan. The integrity & timeliness of the data submitted by banks for the purpose has been an iss ue as a significant portion of this data is manually compiled and \nentered into the Data Management Systems of the SLBC Convenor  Banks. The 21 \n \nextent to which this data corresponds with the data present in the Core Banking \nSolution ( CBS)  of the respective bank s also varies significantly. Therefore, there is \nneed of a standardized system to be developed on the website maintained by each SLBC to enable uploading and downloading of the data pertaining to the Block, \nDistrict as well as the State. The relevant data must also be directly downloadable \nfrom the CBS and/ or MIS of the banks with a view to keeping manual intervention to \na minimal level in the process. The procedure relating to the envisaged intervention \nin this area is given below : \nManagement of Data Flow  at LBS Fora \u2013 Procedure \ni. Each bank\u2019s CBS should have a provision to generate a report pertaining to all LBS related data/ tables to Excel. This data should have information pertaining to \nall the branches operating in the state including fields/ columns for District & Block name. Access to Download & Export this data from the bank \u2019s CBS should \nbe given to the Controlling Offices of the b anks who would be solely responsible \nfor the process of \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 for all districts/ blocks within their jurisdiction.  \n \n \nii. The \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 process is the process of uploading this Excel file (downloaded in step (i) above) on the SLBC websites. SLBC websites should \nhave a provision to \u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 all the data present in the Excel Sheet on the database of the SLBC w ebsite. This would obviate any manual \u2018data entry\u2019 at the \nSLBC/ Controlling Office level.  \n \n \niii. To facilitate the above functionality, each SLBC Convenor Bank would have to add this \u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 functionality to their SLBC website along with the requisite capabilities at the back -end. \n \niv. The SLBC website would, thus, effectively wor k as a data aggregation platform. \nFurther, data analysis capabilities could also be added to the SLBC websites depending on the available resources.  \n \nv. The SLBC websites should provide access to LDMs to download district and block specific data directly from this website thus ensuring integ rity and timely \navailability of data.  \n \nvi. There could still be some data pertaining to State Government Schemes/ other data that is not available on the CBS or MIS of the banks. This would have to be 22 \n \ncollated at the Controlli ng Office level as is done now. At the SLBC website, \nfunctionalities could be provided to enter this data too. This could then be \ndownloaded by the LDMs for district/ block level reports. Banks may also add \nOpen Format fields like \u2018text boxes\u2019 for data or information that is special or is entered/ used once in a while.   \n \nvii. Such a system ensures that LDMs & SLBC Convenor Banks have to do zero or minimal data entry/ feeding and all data is entered by a single \u2018custodian of data\u2019 \nwhich is the Controlling Office of each b ank. Any information to be provided by \nGovernment extension agencies could also be similarly uploaded.  \nNecessary modifications may be made on the SLBC websites and to the CBS & MIS \nsystems of all banks to implement the envisaged data flow mechani sm. \n \nA Working Group of select SLBC Convenor banks and NABARD was constituted by RBI to work out a standardised system for collection, storage, presentation and \nmanagement of data on the SLBC/ UTLBC website. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), which may be followed by SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks, \nmember banks and LDMs , as suggested by the Working Group for management of \nthe data flow  is given at Annex III\n. \n \n4.   Assignment of Lead Bank Responsibility  \n \ni) Lead Bank Scheme is administered by the Reserve Bank of India since 1969. The \nassignment of L ead Bank responsibility to designated banks in every district is done \nby the Reserve Bank of India following a detailed procedure formulated for this \npurpose. As on March 31, 2021, 1 2 public sector banks and one private sector bank \nhave been assigned Lead Bank responsibility in 730 districts of the country.  \nii) State Level Bankers \u2019 Committee  (SLBC) /Union Territory Level Bankers' \nCommittee (UTLBC) , as an apex level for um at the State /Union Territory (UT)  level, \ncoordinates the activities of the financial institutions  and Government departments in \nthe State/Union Territory under  the Lead Bank Scheme. SLBC/UTLBC Convenorship \nis assigned to banks for this purpose.  As on  March 31, 2021, the SLBC/ UTLBC \nconvenorship of 2 8 States and 8  Union Territories has been assigned to 11 public \nsector banks and one private sector bank. A List of State /UT wise SLBC /UTLBC  \nConvenor  Banks  and district  wise Lead Banks is given  in Annex  I. 23 \n \niii) The Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) has been extended to the districts in the \nmetropolitan areas , thus bringing the entire country under the fold of the Lead Bank \nScheme.  \n5.   Banking Penetration  \ni)  Over the years, the focus of the Lead Bank Scheme has shifted to inclusive \ngrowth and financial incl usion. The use of Information Technology (IT) and \nintermediaries has enabled banks to increase the outreach, scale and depth of \nbanking services at affordable cost.   \nii)   SLBC Convenor B anks / L ead Banks are advised to focus attention on the need \nfor achieving 100% financial inclusion through penetration of banking services in the \nrural areas. Upon issuance of D oR revised guidelines on \u2018Rationalisation of Branch \nAuthorisation Policy\u2019 on May 18, 2017 clarifying  on \u2018Banking Outlet \u2019, banks were \nadvised to consider opening of a CBS -enabled banking outlet or a part time banking \noutlet , as the case may be,  in unbanked rural centres.  \niii)  SLBC Convenor Banks should take up with the State Governments , impeders \nsuch as issues of road/digital connectivity, conducive law and order situation, \nuninterrupted power supply, adequate security , etc. for ensuring banking expansion \nat all centres where penetration by the formal banking system is required. However,  \nthese impeders should not inhibit the scaling up of financial inclusion initiatives.  \n \n5.1   Roadmap for providing banking services in unbanked villages \nIn November 2009, a roadmap to provide  banking services in villages with population \nmore than 2000 was rolled out .  All the identified villages have been provided with \nbanking services through branches, business correspondents or through other \nmodes such as ATMs and mobile vans.  Later, in June  2012, a roadmap to provide \nbanking services in unbanked villages with less than 2,000 population was rolled out . \nSLBC Conve nor Banks and L ead Banks were advised to complete the process of \nproviding banking services in unbanked villages with population below 2000 by \nAugust 14, 2015.  \n \n 24 \n \n5.2 Roadmap for opening brick and mortar branches in villages with \npopulation more than 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial \nbank  \nAs brick and mortar branches are an integral component  of financial inclusion, it was \ndecided to focus on vi llages with population above 5000 without a bank branch of a \nscheduled commercial bank. This was to  enable banks to provide quality financial \nservices and timely support to BC outlets that would help in sustaining and \nstrengthening the services provided through BCs and also ensur ing close \nsupervision of BC operations. Accordingly, SLBC Convenor B anks we re advised to \nidentify villages with population above 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial bank in their State and allot these villages among scheduled commercial \nbanks (including Regional Rural Banks) for opening of branches.   \n \n5.3   Aligning roadmap for unbanked villages having population more than \n5000 with revised Guidelines on Branch Authorisation Policy  \n \nIn terms of circular DBR. No.BAPD.BC.69/22.01.001/2016- 17 dated May 18, 2017\n \nissued by D oR on \u2018Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy -  Revision of \nGuidelines \u2019, final  guidelines on \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 have been issued with a view to \nfacilitate financial  inclusion as also to provide flexibility to  banks on the choice of \ndelivery channel.  Accordingly, SLBC Convenor Banks have been  advised to identify \nall unbanked rural centres (URCs) in the State, compile and maintain an updated list \nof all such centres.  The updated list should be displayed on the website of each \nSLBC to facilitate banks to choose/indicate the place/centre where they wish to open \na \u2018banking outlet\u2019.  \n \nii)   Further, SLBC Convenor Banks have been advised that in order to comply with \nthe criteria of opening at least 25 percent of the total banking outlets in unbanked \nrural centres in Tier 5 & 6  centres , as  prescribed  vide D oR  circular dated May 18, \n2017,  banks should give priority to villages w ithout a banking outlet having \npopulation more than 5000 (i.e. Tier 5 centres) and ensure that all such villages under their jurisdiction are covered with a C BS-enabled Banking Outlet on priority \nbasis.  \n \niii)  The updated list of unbanked rural centres should be tabled in all SLBC meetings \nduring discussions on the progress of providing banking services in unbanked rural centres.  25 \n \n 5.4 National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI): 2019- 2024 \u2013 Universal \nAccess to Financial Services  \n \nProviding banking access to every village  within a 5 KM radius / hamlet of 500 \nhouseholds in hilly areas has been one of the key objectives of the National Strategy \nfor Financial Inclusion (NSFI): 2019- 2024.  Accordingly, SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor \nbanks have been advised to review the presence of banking outlets of Scheduled \nCommercial Banks (SCBs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Small Finance Banks \n(SFBs) and Payments Banks (PBs) in every village within a 5 KM radius / hamlet of \n500 households in hilly areas under their jurisdiction(s) and ensure that universal access to financial services  are provided to all such villages.  \n \n6. Credit Deposit Ratio ( CD Ratio)  \n \n6.1   CD Ratio of B anks in Rural and Semi -Urban Areas  \n \nBanks have been advised to achieve a C D Ratio of 60 percent  in respect of their \nrural and semi -urban branches separately on an A ll-India basis. While it is not \nnecessary that this ratio should be achieved separately , branch- wise, district -wise or \nregion- wise, the banks should,  nevertheless, ensure that wide dis parity in the ratios \nbetween different States / Regions is avoided in order to minimise regional \nimbalance in credit deployment. The credit dispensation in certain districts is very \nlow, as a result of various factors suc h as lack of necessary infrastructure, varying \nability of different regions to absorb credit, etc. B anks may review the performance of \ntheir bank branches in such areas and take necessary steps to augment the credit \nflow. The Lead Banks may discuss the problem in all its aspects with the other \nfinancial institutions in the district and also in the DCC forum.  \n \n6.2    Implementation of the Recommendations of the Expert Group on CD \nRatio  \n \ni)   An Expert Group was constituted by the Government of India to go into the nature \nand magnitude of the problem of low CD Ratio across States / Regions and to \nsuggest steps to overcome the problem. The Expert Group examined the problems \nand causes of low CD  Ratio and made recommendations . As per the \nrecommendations, the CD R atio of banks should be monitored at different levels \nbased on the following parameters \u2013  26 \n \nInstitution / Level  Indicator  \nIndividual Banks at Head Office  Cu + RIDF  \nState Level (SLBC)  Cu + RIDF  \nDistrict Level  Cs \n \nWhere:  \n \nCu = Credit as per place of Utilization  \nCs = Credit as per place of Sanction  \nRIDF = Total Resource support provided to States under RIDF \nFurther, banks are advised that:  \n \n\u2022 In the districts having CD Ratio less than 40 percent , Special Sub -Committees \n(SSCs) of the DCC shall be set up to monitor the CD R atio. \n\u2022 Districts having CD  Ratio between 40 and 60 percent , shall be monitored \nunder the existing system by the DCC, and  \n\u2022 The district with CD R atio of less than 20 percent  need to be treated on a \nspecial footing.  \n \nii)  Special Sub- Committee s (SSCs) of the DCC should be set up in the districts \nhaving CD R atio less than 40 percent , in order to monitor the CD  Ratio and to draw \nup Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs) to increase the CD R atio. The Lead District \nManager (LDM) is designated as the C onvenor of the SSC which,  in addition to the \nDistrict Co-ordinators of banks functioning in the area, should comprise of the  LDO \nof RBI, the DDM of NABARD, the District Planning Officer or a representative of the \nCollector duly empowered to take decisions on behalf of the district administration.  \nThe functions of the Special Sub- Committee are as under:  \n\u2022 The SSCs should draw  up M onitorable Action Plans (MAPs) for improving the \nCD Ratio in their districts on a self -set graduated basis.  \n\u2022 For this purpose,  the SSC should hold a special meeting immediately after its \nconstitution and on the basis of the various ground level parameters, set for itself, a target for increasing the CD R atio initially for the current year. It will \nalso, at the same meeting, set a definite time frame to achieve a CD Ratio \nmore than 60 percent  in annual increments.  \n\u2022 Consequent to the completion of this process, the target and time frame self -\nset by the SSC should be placed before the DCC for approval.  \n\u2022 The plans for implementation must then be taken up by the SSC and \nmonitor ed assiduously once in two months.  27 \n \n\u2022 The SSC should report  the progress on the implementation of the plan to the \nDCC on a quarterly basis and through them to the Convenor of the SLBC.  \n\u2022 On the basis of the feedback r eceived from the DCC regarding the progress in \nthe implementation of the Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs), a consolidated \nreport should be prepared by the SSC and tabled at all SLBC meetings for \ndiscussion / information.  \niii)  As regards the districts with a CD Ratio less than 20 percent , these are generally \nlocated in hilly, desert  or inaccessible terrains and / or those dependent solely on the \nprimary sector and/ or characterized by a breakdown of the law and order \nmachinery. In such areas, conventional methods are not likely to work unless the \nbanking system and the State Government come together in a specially meaningful \nway. \n \niv) While the framework for implementation for raising the CD Ratio in these districts \nwill be the same as in the case of districts with CD R atio below 40 percent (i.e. \nsetting up of SSC etc.), the focus of attention and the level of efforts should be of a \nmuch higher scale.  \nFor this,  \n\u2022 All such districts should first be placed in a special category.  \n\u2022 Thereafter, the responsibility for increasing their CD R atio should be taken by \nbanks and State Governments and the districts should be \"adopted\" by the \nDistrict Administration and the L ead Bank jointly.  \n\u2022 While banks would b e responsible for credit disbursement, the State \nGovernment would be required to give an upfront commitment regarding its responsibilities for creation of identified rural infrastructure together with \nsupport in creating an enabling environment for banks t o lend and to recover \ntheir dues.  \n\u2022 Progress in the special category districts should be monitored at the district \nlevel and reported to the corporate offices of the concerned banks.  \n\u2022 The Chairmen/ Managing Directors  of banks should give special attention to \nthe CD R atio in such districts.  \n \n \n 28 \n \n7.   Direct Benefit Transfer  \n \nDirect Benefit Transfer  (DBT) was rolled out by  the Government of India in  selected \ndistricts in January 2013. It was expanded to other districts subsequently.  SLBC \nConvenor  Banks were advised to co- ordinate with the Government authorities to \nimplement DBT.  Banks were advised to include the status of the roll -out of DBT  as a \nregular agenda item for discussion in SLBC meetings as part of Financial \nInclusion/ Direc t Benefit Transfer ( DBT) implementation. As a prerequisite to the \nimplementation of the DBT, every eligible individual should have a bank account. Further, to make disbursements at the doorstep through the ICT- based BC model, \nbanking outlets either through brick & mortar branc hes or the branchless mode is  \nneeded in all villages across the country.  Hence, banks have been advised to:   \n\u2022 take steps to complete the opening of bank accounts  and seeding of Aadhaar \nnumber s in all bank accounts .  \n\u2022 closely monitor the progress in seeding of Aadhaar number with the bank  \naccounts of beneficiaries.  \n\u2022 put in place a system to  provide the beneficiary of the seeding request an \nackn owledgement and also send a  confirmation of the seeding of Aadhaar \nnumber.  \n\u2022 form a DBT Implementation Co- ordination Committee, along with the State \nGovernment department  concerned, at district level and review the seeding of \nAadhaar number s in bank accounts.  \n\u2022 ensure that district and village wise names and other details of  business \ncorre spondents (BCs) engaged/other arrangements made by the bank are  \ndisplayed on the SLBC website.  \n\u2022 set up a Complaint Grievance Redressal mechanism in each bank and \nnominate a Complaint Redressal Officer in each district, to redress the \ngrievances related to \u2018 seeding of Aadhaar number in bank accounts'.  \n \nBanks were further advised to ensure that opening of bank accounts and seeding of \nAadhaar numbers with existing or new accounts of eligible beneficiaries opened for the purpose of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) under social welfare schemes, was in \nconformity with the provisio ns listed under Section 16 of the Master Direction -  Know 29 \n \nYour Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016 (updated as on May 29, 2019) and extant \nprovisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering (PML) Rules.  \n8. Service Area Approach (SAA)  \n \ni) The Service Area Approach (SAA) , introduced in April 1989 for planned and \norderly development of rural and semi -urban areas was applicable to all scheduled \ncommercial banks including Regional Rural Banks.  Under SAA, each bank branch \nin a rural or semi -urban area was designated to serve an area of 15 to 25 villages \nand the branch was responsible for meeting the needs of bank credit of  its service \narea.  The primary objective of SAA was to increase productive lending and forge effective linkages between bank credit, production, productivity and increase in \nincome levels.  \n   \nii) The Service Area Approach scheme was reviewed in December 2004 and it was decided to dispense with the restrictive provisions of the scheme while retaining the \npositive features of the SAA such as credit plann ing and monitoring of the credit \npurveyance. Accordingly, under SAA , the allocation of villages among the rural and \nsemi -urban branches of banks were made not applicable for lending except under \nGovernment Sponsored Schemes. Thus , while  the c ommercial banks and RRBs are \nfree to lend i n any rural and semi -urban area, the borrowers have the choice of \napproaching any branch for their credit requirements.  \n8.1 Dispensing with \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019  \n \nIn order to ensure hassle free credit to all bor rowers, especially in rural and semi -\nurban areas and keeping in view the technological developments and the different \nways available with banks to avoid multiple financing, banks have been advised to \ndispense with obtaining a \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 from the individu al borrowers \n(including SHGs & JLGs) in rural and semi -urban areas for all types of loans \nincluding loans under Government Sponsored Schemes, irrespective of the amount \ninvolved unless the Government Sponsored Scheme itself provides for obtention of a \n\u2018No Due Certificate\u2019.  Further, it has been clarified that the policy of dispensing with a \n\u2018No Due Certificate\u2019  for lending by banks is also applicable to urban areas including \nmetropolitan cities.  \n 30 \n \nii)   Banks are encouraged to use an alternative framework of due diligence as part \nof the credit appraisal exercise other than the \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 which could, \namong others, consist of one or more of the following:  \n\u2022 Credit history check through C redit Information Companies  (CICs)  \n\u2022 Self-declaration or an affidavit from the borrower  \n\u2022 CERSAI registration  \n\u2022 Peer monitoring  \n\u2022 Information sharing among lenders  \n\u2022 Information search (writing to other lenders with an auto deadline)  \n \niii) Banks are also advised to submit information/data to all Credit Information \nCompanies (CI Cs), as  required in terms of extant instructions issued by RBI.  \n \n9.   Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022 \ni)  The Government of India,  in the Union Budget 2016- 17, had announced its \nresolve to double the income of farmers by 2022. Several steps have been taken \ntowards attaining this objective including setting up of an inter -ministerial committee \nfor preparation of a blue print for the same. This agenda has also been reiterated by \nthe government in several fora  and has acquired primacy from the point of view of \nrural and agricultural development.  \nii) The strategy to achieve this goal, inter -alia, includes,  \n \n\u2022 Focus on irrigation with large budgets, with the aim of \"per drop, more crop\"  \n\u2022 Provision of quality seeds and nutrients based on soil health of each field  \n\u2022 Investments in warehousing and cold chains to prevent post -harvest crop \nlosses  \n\u2022 Promotion of value addition through food processing  \n\u2022 Creation of a national farm market, removing distortions and development of  \ninfrastructure such as e- platform across 585 stations  \n\u2022 Strengthening of the crop insurance scheme to mitigate risks at affordable \ncost \n\u2022 Promotion of ancillary activities like poultry, bee- keeping and fisheries  31 \n \niii. Needless to emphasize that acceleration in income generation is significantly \ndependent on better capital formation in agriculture. Towards this, banks should \nrevisit their documentation for crop loans, simplify them where required and ensur e \nspeedy sanctioning and disbursal of loans within specified time limits.  \niv. The Lead Bank Scheme, which ensures inter -departmental/governmental \ncoordination in the financial sector, should,  therefore,  be leveraged to further the \nobjective of doubling farmer s\u2019 income by 2022. Lead B anks are accordingly advised \nto ensure the following:  \na. Work closely with NABARD in the preparation of Potential Linked Credit Plans \n(PLPs) & Annual Credit Plans (ACPs) keeping the above strategy in \nconsideration \nb. Include \u2018Doubling of Farmers \u2019 Income by 2022\u2019 as a regular agenda under the \nLead Bank Scheme in various fora  such as SLBC, DCC, DLRC and BLBC  \nc. For the purpose of monitoring and reviewing the progress, Lead B anks may \nuse the benchmarks as may be provided by NABARD  \nd. Map the overall strategy as given in para 9 (ii) above to the agriculture/agro-\nancillary lending plan of the bank . \n10. Expanding and D eepening of Digital Payments Ecosystem    \n \nWith a view to expanding and deepening the digital payments ecosystem, t he \nSLBCs/UTLBCs were advised to identify one district in their respective States/UTs \non a pilot basis in consultat ion with banks and stakeholders  and allocate it to a bank \nwith signifi cant footprint which will endeavour to make the district 100% digitally \nenabled within one year , in order to enable every individual in the district to make/ \nreceive payments digitally in a safe, secure, quick, affordable and convenient manner. SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks were also advised to devise a time bound \nroadmap to all branches of member banks (Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks, Regional Rural Banks, Small Finance Banks and Payments Banks) located in the identified district(s) for on- boarding merchants/ traders/ businesses/ utility service \nproviders to facilitate fully digital transactions .

This Master \nCircular  consolidates the circulars  issued by Reserv e Bank on the subject up to March \n31, 2021, as indicated in the Appendix\n.  \n \nYours faithfully  \n  \n(Sonali Sen Gupta)  \nChief General Manager -in-Charge  \nEncl: As above  \n  \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n Master Circular on SHG -Bank Linkage Programme  \nSelf Help Groups ha ve the potential to bring together the formal banking structure and the \nrural poor for mutual benefit . Studies conducted by NABARD in a few states to assess the \nimpact of the linkage project have brought out encouraging and positive features like increase \nin loan volume of the SHGs, definite shift in the loaning pattern of the members from non-\nincome generating activities to production activities, nearly 100 per cent recovery performance, significant reduction in the transaction costs for both the banks and the \nborrowers etc., besides leading to a gradual increase in the income level of the SHG \nmembers. Another significant feature observed in the linkage project is  that about 85 per cent \nof the groups linked with banks were formed exclusively by wom en. \n2. Recognizing the importance of SHG Bank linkage, banks have been advised to meet the \nentire credit requirements of SHG members, as envisaged in Paragraph 93 of the Union Budget announcement for the year 2008-09, made by the Honorable Finance Minister , \nwherein it was stated as under: \"Banks will be encouraged to embrace the concept of Total Financial Inclusion. Government will request all scheduled commercial banks to follow the example set by some public sector banks and meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members, namely, (a) income generation activities, (b) social needs like housing, education, \nmarriage, etc. and (c) debt swapping\".  Linking of SHGs with banks has  thus been emphasized \nin the Monetary Policy Statements of Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget \nannouncements from time to time and various guidelines have been issued to banks in this \nregard.  \n3. Banks should provide adequate incentives to their branches in financing the Self Help \nGroups (SHGs) and establish linkages with them, making the procedures simple and easy. \nThe group dynamics of working of the SHGs need neither be regulated nor formal structures \nimposed or insisted upon. The approach to financing of SHGs should be totally hassle-free \nand may also include consumption expenditures.  Accordingly, the following guidelines  should \nbe adhered to enable effective linkage of SHGs with the banking sector.  \n \n 3 \n 4. Opening of Savings Bank A/C  \nThe SHGs, registered or unregistered, which are engaged in promoting savings habit among \ntheir member s are eligible to open savings bank accounts with banks. These SHGs need not \nnecessarily have already availed of credit facilities from banks before opening savings bank \naccounts. The instructions on simplified Customer Due Diligence (CDD) applicable to SH Gs \nas prescribed in Part VI of the  Master Direction - Know Your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016  \n(as updated from time to time)  shall be adhered to.   \n5. Lending to SHGs  \na) Bank lending to SHGs should be included in branch credit plan, block credit plan, district \ncredit plan and state credit plan of each bank. Utmost priority should be accorded to the \nsector in preparation of these plans. It should also form an integral part of the bank\u2019s corporate credit plan.  \nb) As per operational guidelines issued by NABARD, SHGs may be sanctioned savings linked loans by banks (varying from a saving to loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4). However, in case of matured SHGs, loans may be given beyond the limit of four times the savings as per \nthe discretion of the bank.  \nc) A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation is a precondition for augmenting flow of credit to SHGs. Banks should strive to remove all operational irritants and make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and disburse credit by delegating \nadequate sanctioning powers to branch managers. The loan application forms, procedures and documents should be made simple. It would help in providing prompt and hassle-free credit.  \n6. Interest rates  \nThe banks would have the discretion to decide on the interest rates applicable to loans given to Self Help Groups/member beneficiaries , subject to regulatory guidelines on interest rate \non advances contained in Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Interest Rate on \nAdvances) Directions, 2016 issued vide \nDBR. Dir.No.85/13.03.00/2015-16 dated March 3,  \n2016 , as amended from time to time.   4 \n 7. Service/ Processing charges \nNo loan related and ad hoc service charges/inspection charges should be levied on priority \nsector loans up to \u20b9 25,000. In the case of eligible priority sector loans to SHGs/ JLGs, this \nlimit will be applicable per member and not to the group as a whole.   \n8. Separate Segment under priority sector \nLoans to SHGs are allowed to be classified under Priority Sector Lending (PSL) under  the \nrespective categories viz Agriculture, MSME, Social  Infrastructure and others, subject to \nextant guidelines of Master Directions \u2013  Priority Sector Lending (PSL) \u2013  Targets and \nClassification  issued vide Master Directions  FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.5/04.09.01/2020-21 dated \nSeptember 4, 2020 , as amended from time to time.  \n9. Presence of defaulters in SHGs  \nDefaults by a few members of SHGs and/or their family members to the financing bank should \nnot ordinarily come in the way of financing SHGs per se by banks, provided the SHG is not \nin default. However, the bank loan may not be utilized by the SHG for financing a defaulter member to the bank.  \n10. Capacity Building and Training  \na) Banks may initiate suitable steps to internalize the SHGs linkage project and organize \nexclusive short duration programmes for the field level functionaries. In addition, suitable awareness/sensitization programmes may be conducted for their middle level controlling \nofficers as well as senior officers.  \nb) Banks shall refer to instructions on Financial Lit eracy by FLCs and rural branches \u2013  Policy \nreview  vide Circular FIDD.FLC.BC.No.22/12.01.018/2016-17 dated March 02, 2017\n \nconducting tailored programs targeting SHGs . \n11. Monitoring and Review of SHG Lending  \n \nConsidering the potential of SHGs, banks shall closely monitor the progress regularly at various levels. In order to give a boost t o the ongoing SHG bank linkage programme for credit \nflow to the unorganized sector, monitoring of SHG bank linkage programme shall  be a regular 5 \n item on the agenda for discussion at the SLBC and DCC meetings. It should be reviewed at \nthe highest corporate level on a quarterly basis. Further, progress of the programme may be \nreviewed by banks at regular intervals . The progress under SHG -BLP, as pres cribed vide RBI \nletter FIDD.CO.FID.No.3387/12.01.033/2017-18 dated April 26, 2018 shall be reported to \nNABARD (Micro Credit Innovations Department), Mumbai, on a quarterly basis, and the \nreturns in the prescribed format  shall be submitted within 15 days from due date.  \n12. Reporting to CICs  \nRecognizing the importance of credit information reporting in respect of the SHG members \nfor financial inclusion, banks are advised to adhere to the guidelines on Credit information \nreporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) members  dated June 16, 2016  and Credit \ninformation reporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) members  dated January 14, \n2016 . \n \n  6 \n Appendix  \nList of Circulars consolidated in the Master Circular \nSr. No. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

NRLM was renamed as DAY -NRLM (Deendayal \nAntyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016. The  \nDAY- NRLM is  the flagship program of Govt. of India for promoting poverty reduction \nthrough building strong institutions of the poor, particularly women, and enabling these \ninstitutions to ac cess a range of financial services and livelihoods . DAY- NRLM adopts a \ndemand driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State specific poverty reduction action plans. The blocks and districts in which all  the components of \nDAY- NRLM would  be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or \nNGOs, would  be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas remaining would  be non-\nintensive blocks and districts. \nThe key features of DAY -NRLM have been furnished in Annex \nI. \n \n2. Women SHGs and their  Federations \n \n2.1 Women SHGs under DAY -NRLM consist of 10 -20 persons. In case of special SHGs \ni.e. groups in the difficult areas, groups with disabled persons, and groups formed in \nremote tribal areas, this number may be a minim um of 5 persons.  \n \n2.2 DAY- NRLM promotes affinity -based women Self Help Groups  (SHGs).  \n \n2.3 Only for groups to be formed with Persons with disabilities, and other specia l \ncategories like elder, transgender , DAY- NRLM will have both men and women in the \nSelf-Help Groups.  \n \n2.4 SHG is an informal group and registration under any Societies Act, State \ncooperative Act or a partnership firm is not m andatory vide Circular RPCD.No.  Plan \nBC.13/PL -09.22/90- 91 dated July 24th, 1991. However, Federations of Self Help \nGroups formed at Village, Gram Panchayat, Cluster or higher level may be registered \nunder appropriate acts prevaili ng in their  respective states.  \n \nFinancial Assistance to the SHGs \n3. Revolving Fund:  DAY- NRLM , MoRD,  would provide Revolving Fund (RF) support to \nSHGs in existence for a minimum period of 3/6 month and follow the norms of good \nSHGs, i.e. they follow \u2018Panchasutra\u2019 \u2013  regular meetings, regular savings, regular internal 3  lending,  regular  recoveries  and maintenance of proper  books  of accounts.  Only such  \nSHGs that  have not received any RF earlier  would be provided with RF, as corpus,  with a \nminimum of  \u20b910,000 and up to a maximum  of \u20b915,000 per SHG.  The purpose  of RF is to \nstrengthen  their institutional and financial management capacity and build a good credit \nhistory within the group.  \n \n4. Capital Subsidy has been discontinued under  DAY- NRLM:  \nNo Capital Subsidy would be sanctioned to any SHG from the date of implementation of  \nDAY- NRLM.  \n \n5. Community Investment Support Fund (CIF)  \nCIF would  be provided by MoRD to the SHGs promoted under DAY \u2013  NRLM  in all \nblocks (intens ive and non- intensive) and would be routed through the Village level/ \nCluster level Federations, to be maintained in perpetuity by the Federations. The CIF \nwould be used, by the Federations, to advance loans to the SHGs and/or to undertake \nthe common/collective socio- economic activities . \n \n6. Introduction of Interest subvention:  \nDAY- NRLM  has a provision  for interest  subvention,  to cover  the difference between the \nLending Rate of the banks and 7%, on all credit from the banks/ financial institutions \navailed by women SHGs,  for a maximum  of \u20b9 300,000/ - per SHG.  This would  be \navailable across the country in two ways:  \n \n(i) In 250 identified districts, banks may  lend to the women SHGs @7% up to an \naggregated loan amount of \u20b9 300,000/ -. The banks would be subvented to the extent of \ndifference between the Weighted Average Interest Charged and 7%, subject to the \nmaximum limit of 5.5%. An additional interest subvention of 3% is also available on \nprompt repayment by the SHGs, reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%.   \n \n(ii) In the remaining districts, the banks may  lend at their respective lending rates,  \napplicable to SHGs.  In these districts, a ll women SHGs  under  DAY\u2013  NRLM  would  be \neligible  for interest subvention on prompt re payment . The difference between the bank \nlending rates and 7% for loans up to  \u20b9 300,000/ - subject to a maximum limit of 5.5% , \nwould be subvented directly in  the loan accounts of the SHGs by the SRLM s. This part \nof the scheme would  be operationalized by  the SRLMs.  \n \n\u2022 Salient features of the Scheme are enclosed in Annex  II. \n\u2022 The list of 250 identified districts is as per Annex  III. \n\u2022  Subvented i nterest  rate would  be communicated separately to the banks by \nGoI/RBI.  \n \n \n 4   \n7. Role of banks:  \n \n \n7.1 Opening of Savings account : \n \n7.1.1 Opening of Savings account  of SHGs:  The role of banks  would commence with \nopening of accounts  for all the Women SHGs  including  members  with disability  and the \nFederations of the SHGs. The SHGs engaged in promoting of savings habits among \ntheir members would be eligible to open savings bank  accounts.  \n \n(i) Know Your Customer (KYC) verification of only the office bearers shall suffice for \nopening of savings bank  account.  \n(ii)  Banks may  not insist on Permanent Ac count Number (PAN) of SHGs at the time of \nopening of account or transactions and may accept declaration in Form No 60 as \nmay be required.  \n(iii) For KYC verification pertaining to SHG members during opening of accounts, \ninstructions of Department of Banking Regulation in Master Direction on KYC (dated \nFebruary  25, 2016 , updated as on March 23, 2021 ) shall be adhered to while \ncompleting Customer Due Diligence (CDD ) process.  CDD means identifying and \nverifying the customer and the beneficial owner . Accordingly, the current \ninstructions under Simplified norms for Self Help Groups (SHGs) mention that \nwhile opening of accounts Customer Due Diligence (CD D) of all the members \nof SHG sh all not be required and CDD of only the office bearers shall  suffice.  At the \ntime of credit linking of SHGs, banks may undertake KYC verification of all the \nmembers in the SHG. However, opening of savings account of all members with the \nbank shall not be m ade a prerequisite for credit linkage of SHGs.  Banks are advised \nto maintain separate Savings and loan account for Self Help Groups.  \n(iv) Business Correspondent s deployed by  banks may also be authorized to open \nSaving Bank Accounts of the SHGs after verification/approval of the base branch , \nsubject to adherence to extant BC guidelines and in accordance with the bank\u2019s \nBoard approved policy on Business Correspondents.  However, ensuring \ncompliance with KYC and AML norms under the BC model continues to be the responsibility of the banks.    \n \n7.1.2 Opening of Savings account  of Federation of SHGs : Banks  are advised to open \nsavings account of Federations of SHGs at village, Gram Panchayat, Cluster or higher level.  These  accounts  may be categorized as savings  account  for \u2018Association  of \npersons\u2019. The \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 (KYC) norms for the signatories of such accounts \nas specified from time to time by Reserve Bank of India would  be applicable.\n \n \n7.1.3  Opening of Current Account of Producer Groups (PGs): In order to \nfacilitate collective production and marketing for their produce, banks are \nadvised to open current account for Producer Groups  promoted under DAY -\nNRLM  at village, Gram Panchayat, Cluster or higher level. The \u2018K now Your 5  Customer\u2019 (KYC) norms for the signatories of such accounts as specified from \ntime to time by Reserve Bank of India would be applicable.  \n \n7.1.4  Transaction in Savings/ Cash Credit  account  of SHGs  and Federation of \nSHGs : SHGs  and their federations may be encouraged to transact  through their \nrespective saving account s and Cash  Credit  Loan  account s on regular basis. To \nfacilitate this, banks are advised to enable transactions in jointly operated savi ngs/Cash \nCredit account of SHGs and their  federations  with inter operable facility at retail outlets \nmanaged by Business Correspondents . Banks are also advised to extend all such \nservices to SHGs and their federations through Business Correspondents  as per their \nboard approved polic ies. \n \n7.2  Lending Norms to individual SHG members and SHGs  \n \n7.2.1   The eligibility criteria for the SHGs to avail  loans:  \n \n\u2022 SHG s should be in active existence at least since the last 6 months as per the \nbooks of account of SHGs and not from the date of opening of S/B  account.  \n\u2022 SHG s should be practicing \u2018 Panchasutras\u2019 i.e. Regular meetings; Regular savings; \nRegular inter -loaning; Timely repayment; and Up- to-date books of  accounts;  \n\u2022 Qualified as per grading norms fixed by NABARD. As and when the federations of \nthe SHGs come to  existence,  the  grading  exercise  may   be  done  by  the  \nFederations to support the banks.  \n\u2022 The existing defunct SHGs are also eligible for credit if they are revived and continue to be active for a minimum period of 3 months.  \n \n7.2.2 Loan Application: It is advised that all banks may use the Common Loan \nApplication Forms recommended by Indian Bank\u2019s Association (IBA) for extending credit facility to SHGs .\n \n \n7.2.3 Loan amount : Emphasis is laid on the multiple doses of assistance under DAY - \nNRLM. This would mean assisting an SHG over a period of time, through repeat doses \nof credit, to enable them to access higher amounts of credit for taking up sustainable \nlivelihoods and improve on the quality of  life. \n \nSHGs may  avail either Term Loan (TL) or a Cash C redit Limit (CCL) loan or both based \non the need. In c ase of need, additional loan may  be sanctioned even though the  \nprevious loan is  outstandin g, based on the repayment behavior and performance of the \nSHG . \n The amount of credit under different facilities are as follows:  \n 6  Cash Credit Limit (CCL): In case of CCL, banks are advised to sanction minimum loan \nof \u20b9 6 lakh to each eligible SHGs for a period of 3 years with a  yearly drawing power \n(DP). The drawing power may be enhanced annually  based on the  repayment \nperformance of the SHG. The drawing power may be calculated as follows:  \n\u2022 DP for First Year: 6  times of the exist ing corpus or minimum   of \u20b91 lakh, whichever \nis higher  \n\u2022 DP for Second Year: 8 times of the corpus at the time review/ enhancement or \nminimum of \u20b92  lakh, whichever is  higher  \n\u2022 DP for Third Year: Minimum  of \u20b96 lakh based on the Micro credit plan prepared by \nSHG  and appraised by the Federations  /Support  agency  and the previous  credit  \nhistory.  \n\u2022 DP for Fourth Year  onwards:  Above \u20b96 lakh, based on the Micro  credit  plan \nprepared by SHG and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the \nprevious credit History.  \n \nTerm Loan:  In case of Term Loan, banks are advised to sanction loan amount in doses \nas mentioned below:  \n\u2022 First Dos e: 6 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b91 lakh, whichever is \nhigher  \n\u2022 Second Dose: 8  times of the e xisting corpus or minimum of \u20b92 lakh, whichever is \nhigher  \n\u2022 Third Dose: Minimum of \u20b96 lakh , based on the Micro credit plan prepared by the \nSHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit history.  \n\u2022 Fourth Dose onwards: Above \u20b96 lakh, based on the Micro credit plan prepared by \nthe SHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit History.  \n \nBanks are advised take necessary measures to ensure that eligible SHGs are provided \nwith repeat loans. Banks are advised to coordinate with DAY -NRLM to institutionalize a \nmechanism for online submission of loan application from SHGs for tracking and timely \ndisposal of application.  \n \n(Corpus is inclusive of revolving funds, if any, received by that SHG, its own savings, \ninterest earning by SHG from on- lending to its members, income from other sources, \nand funds from other sources in case of promotion by other institutes/NGOs.)  \n \n7.3   Purpose of loan and repayment : \n \n7.3.1   The loan amount  would  be distributed among members  based on the Micro  Credit  \nPlan (MCP) prepared by the SHGs. The loans may be used by members for meeting \nsocial needs,  high cost debt swapping,  construction or repair  of house,  construction of \ntoilets  and taking up sustainable livelihoods by the individual members within the SHGs 7  or to finance any viable common activity started by the SHGs.  \n \n7.3.2  In order to facilitate use of loans for augmenting livelihoods of SHG members, it \nis advised that at l east 50% of loans above \u20b92 lakh,  75% of loans above \u20b94 lakh and at \nleast 85% of loans above \u20b9 6 lakh  be used primarily for income generating productive \npurposes.  Micro  Credit  Plan (MCP)  prepared by SHGs  would  form the basis  for \ndetermining the purpose and usage of  loans.  \n \n7.3.3  Repayment schedule for Term  Loans  may be as follows:  \n\u2022 The First dose of loan may  be repaid in 24- 36 months  in monthly/Quarterly \nInstalments.  \n\u2022 The Second dose of loan may be repaid  in 36-48 months  in monthly/Quarterly  \ninstalments.  \n\u2022 The Third dose of loan may  be repaid in 48- 60 months based on the cash flow in  \nmonthly/ Quarterly instalments . \n\u2022 The loan from Fourth dose onwards may  be repaid between 60 -84 months  based on \nthe cash flow in m onthly/ quarterly installments.   \n \n7.3.4 All facilities  sanctioned under DAY-  NRLM would  be governed by the Asset  \nClassification  norms is sued by Reserve Bank of India f rom time to  time.  \n \n7.4. Security and Margin:  \n \nNo collateral and no margin would  be charged up to \u20b910.00 lakh limit to the SHGs. No lien \nshould be marked against savings bank account of SHGs and no deposits should be \ninsisted upon while sanctioning loans  \n \n7.5. Dealing with  Defaulters:  \nIt is desirable that willful defaulters  should  not be financed under  DAY- NRLM.  In case \nwillful defaulters are members of a group, they might be allowed to benefit from the \nthrift and credit activities of the group including the corpus built up with the assistance \nof Revolving Fund. But at the stage of accessing bank loan by SHG for financing \neconomic activities by its members, the willful defaulters should not have the benefit of \nsuch bank loan until the outstanding loans are repaid. Willful defaulters of the group \nshould not get benefits under the DAY -NRLM Scheme and the group may be fi nanced \nexcluding such defaulters while documenting the loan. However, banks should not deny \nloan to entire SHG on the pretext that spouse or other family members of individual \nmembers of SHG being a defaulter with the bank. Further, non- willful defaulters should \nnot be debarred from receiving the loan. In case default is due to genuine reasons, banks may follow the norms suggested for restructuring the account with revised \nrepayment  schedule.  \n 8   \n8  Credit Target  Planning \n8.1      Based on the Potential  Linked Plan/State  Focus  Paper  prepared by NABARD,  \nSLBC sub -committee on SHG Bank Linkage may arrive at the district -wise, block -wise \nand branch- wise credit plan. The sub-  committee should consider the existing SHGs, \nNew SHGs  proposed,  and number  of SHGs  eligible  for fresh  and repeat  loans  as \nsuggested by the SRLMs to arrive at the credit targets for the states. The targets so \ndecided should be approved in the SLBC and reviewed and monitored periodically for \neffective implementation.  \n8.2  The district -wise credit plans  should be communicated to the DCC. The Block - \nwise/Cluster -wise targets are to be communicated to the bank b ranches through the \nControllers . \n9 Post credit follow - up \n9.1 Loan pass books or statement of accounts in regional languages may be issued to \nthe SHGs which may contain all the details of the loans disbursed to them and the \nterms and conditions applicable to the loan sanctioned. The passbook should be \nupdated with every transaction made by the SHGs. At the time of documentation and \ndisbursement of l oan, it is advisable to clearly explain the terms and conditions as part \nof financial  literacy.  \n9.2  Bank branches may observe one fixed day in a fortnight to enable the staff to go \nto the field and attend the meetings  of the SHGs  and Federations  to observe the \noperations of the SHGs and keep a track of the regularity in the SHGs meetings and  \nperformance.  \n10  Repayment:  \nPrompt repayment of the loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks  shall take all possible  measures,  i.e. personal  contact,  organization of joint \nrecovery camps with District Mission Management Units (DPMUs) / District Rural \nDevelopment Agency( DRDAs ) to ensure the recovery of loans. Keeping in view, the \nimportance of loan recovery, banks should prepare a  list of defaulting SHGs  under \nDAY- NRLM every month and furnish the list in the BLBC, DCC meetings.  This would  \nensure that DAY- NRLM  staff at the district/ block  level would  assist  the bankers in \ninitiating the repayment  \n \n11  Supervision and monitoring of the Scheme \nBanks may set up cells for Self Help Groups at respec tive Regional/Zonal offices of \nbanks. These cells should periodically monitor and review the flow of credit to the \nSHGs, ensure the implementation of the guidelines to the scheme, collect data from the branches and make available consolidated data to the Head office and the DAY -NRLM \nunits at the districts/ blocks. The cell should also discuss this consolidated data in the SLBC, BLBC and DCC meetings regularly to maintain the effective communication with \nthe state staff and all banks.  9   \n11.1 State  Level  Bankers\u2019  Committee: SLBCs  shall constitute  a sub-committee  on SHG \nbank linkage. The sub- committee should consist of members from all banks operating \nin the State, RBI, NABARD, CEO of SRLM, representatives of State Rural \nDevel opment Department, Secretary -Institutional Finance and Representatives of \nDevelopment Departments etc. The sub-  committee shall discuss  a specific agenda of \nreview, implementation and monitoring of the SHG -Bank linkage and the issues/ \nconstraints in achiev ement of the credit target. The decisions of SLBCs should be \nderived from the analysis of the reports of the sub-committee.  \n \n11.2  District Coordination Committee: The DCC shall regularly monitor the flow of \ncredit to SHGs at the district level and resolve issues that constrain the flow of credit  to \nthe SHGs  at district  level.  This committee  should have participation of LDMs, AGM of \nNABARD, district coordinators of the banks and DPMU staff representing DAY -NRLM and office \nbearers of SHG federations  \n \n11.3  Block  level Bankers  Committee:  The BLBC  shall take up issues of SHG bank \nlinkage at the block level. In this Committee, the SHGs/ Federations of the SHGs \nshould be included as members to raise their voice in the forum. Branch wise status of \nSHG credit shall be monitored at the BLBC.  \n \n11.4  Reporting to Lead District Managers:  The branches may furnish the progress \nreport and the delinquency report achieved under various activities of DAY -NRLM in the \nformat at Annex \u2013IV and Annex -V to the LDM every month for onward submission to \nSpecial Steering Committee/sub- committee constituted by  SLBC.  \n \n11.5  Reporting to RBI: Banks may give a state- wise consolidated report on the \nprogress made on DAY -NRLM to RBI/NABARD at quarterly intervals. The data may be \nsubmitted within a month from the end of the concerned quarter.  \n \n11.6 LBR returns:  Existing procedure of submitting LBR returns to be continued duly \nfurnishing the correct  code  \n \n12  Financial Literacy: Financial Literacy is one of the important strategies to \nspread awareness  on financial  behavior  and keep households  informed about  various \nfinancial products and services. DAY -NRLM has trained and deployed a large number \nof cadre called \u2018Financial Literacy Community Resource Persons (FL- CRPs)\u2019 to c arry \nout financial literacy camps at village level. Financial Literacy Centers (FLC) \nestablished by various bank s may coordinate with respective SRLMs and utilize the \nservices of FL- CRPs to conduct village camps on Financial  Literacy.  \n \n13  Data  Sharing:  \n 10  13.1 Data  sharing on a mutually agreed format / interval may be provided to DAY -\nNRLM or State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs) for initiating various strategies \nincluding recovery  etc.  \n The financing banks are advised to regularly share data on loans to SHGs  with the \nDAY-  NRLM or SRLMs, directly from the CBS platform.  \n \n13.2  Banks  should share data of Pradhan Mantri  Jeevan Jyoti Bima  Yojana (PMJJBY)  \nand Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) with DAY -NRLM on agreed \nformats to facilitate higher enrollment and claim settlement under the mentioned \nschemes.  \n \n13.3  Banks  to share data of all SHG t ransactions being done at Business \nCorrespondents points using Dual Authentication technology introduced by banks on a \nmutually agreed format/interval only after obtaining consent of the customer. However, \nthe banks should ensure preservation and protection of the security and confidentiality \nof customer information in the custody or possession of BC.  \n \n14  DAY- NRLM support to the bankers:  \n \n14.1    SRLM would develop strategic partnerships with major banks at various levels. It \nwould invest in creating enabling conditions for both the banks and the poor for a \nmutually rewarding relationship.  \n \n14.2  SRLM would  assist the SHGs through imparting financial Literacy, extending \ncounselling services on savings, credit, insurance, pension and training on Micro-  \nInvestment  Planning embedded in capacity  building.  \n \n14.3  SRLMs  would  extend support  to banks  for improving quality  of banking services  to \npoor clients including follow -up for recovery of over dues if any, by positioning customer \nrelationship managers (Bank Mitra/ Sakhi) with every bank branch involved in financing of SHGs. \n \n \n14.4  Leveraging IT mobile technologies and institutions of poor, youth or SHG \nmember as business facilitators and business  correspondents.  \n \n14.5  Community Based Repayment mechanism (CBRM):  One exclusive sub -  \ncommittee for SHG Bank Linkage may be formed at village/cluster/ block level which would provide support to the banks in ensuring proper utilization of loan amount, \nrecovery etc. The bank linkage sub -  committee members from each village level \nfederation along with project staff would  meet once in a month under the chairmanship \nof the Branch Manager in the branch premises with the agenda items relating to bank  \nlinkage.  11  Annex I  \n  \n   \nKey Features of DAY -NRLM   \n  \n1. Universal Social Mobilization: To begin with, DAY -NRLM would ensure that at \nleast one member from each identified rural poor household, preferably a woman, is \nbrought under the Self Help Group (SHG) network in a time bound manner. \nSubsequently, both women and men would be organized for addressing livelihood \nissues i.e. farmers organizations, milk producers\u2019 cooperatives, weavers associations, \netc. All these institutions are inclusive and no poor would be left out of them. DAY -\nNRLM would ensure adequate  coverage  of  vulnerable  sections   of  the  society  such  \nthat  50%  of  the beneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are minorities and 3% are persons \nwith disability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of all \nhouseholds under the automatically included criteria and households with at least one \ndeprivation criteria as per Socio- Economic and Caste Census (SECC).  \n  \n2. Participatory Identification of poor (PIP): The experience from SGSY suggests that the current BPL list has large inclusion and exclusion errors. To widen the t arget \ngroups beyond the BPL list and to include all the needy poor identified as households with at least one deprivation criteria as per Socio- Economic and Caste Census \n(SECC). DAY-  NRLM would also undertake community -based process i.e. participation \nof the poor in the process of identifying the target group. Participatory process based \non sound methodology and tools (social mapping and well -being categorization, \ndeprivation indicators) and als o locally understood and accepted criterion ensures local \nconsensus that inadvertently reduces the inclusion and exclusion errors and enables \nformation of the groups on the basis of mutual affinity. Over the years, the participatory \nmethod of identifying t he poor have been developed and applied successfully in the \nstates like AP, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha.   \n  \nThe households identified with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC along with households identified through the P.I.P process would  be accepted as DAY -NRLM \ntarget group and would be eligible for all the benefits under the programme. The list \nfinalized after PIP process would  be vetted by the Gram Sabha and approved by the \nGram Panchayat.   \n  \nTill the PIP process is undertaken by the State in a particular district/Block, the rural \nhouseholds with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC list would  be targeted \nunder DAY -NRLM. As already provided in the Framework for implementation of DAY -\nNRLM, up to 30% of the total membership of the SH Gs may be from among the \npopulation marginally above the poverty line, subject to the approval of other members 12  of the group. This 30% also includes the poor households whose name does not figure \nin the SECC list but are as poor as those included in SECC l ist.  \n  \n3. Promotion of Institutions of the poor: Strong institutions of the poor such as \nSHGs and their village level and higher -level federations are necessary to provide \nspace, voice and resources for the poor and for reducing their dependence on external agencies. They empower them and also act as instruments of knowledge and \ntechnology dissemination, and hubs of production, collectivization and commerce. \nDAY- NRLM, therefore, would focus on setting up these institutions at various levels. In \naddition, D AY- NRLM would promote specialized institutions like Livelihoods \ncollectives, producers\u2019 cooperative/companies for livelihoods promotion through \nderiving economies of scale, backward and forward linkages, and access to \ninformation, credit, technology, mark ets etc.  \nThe Livelihoods collectives would enable the poor to optimize their limited resource.   \n  \n4. Strengthening all existing SHGs and federations of the poor. There are existing \ninstitutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of NGOs. \nDAY-  NRLM would strengthen all existing institutions of the poor in a partnership mode. \nThe self-help promoting institutions both in the Government and in the NGO sector \nwould promote social accountability practices to introduce greater transparenc y. This \nwould be in addition to the mechanisms that would be evolved by SRLMs and state governments. The learning from one another underpins the key processes of learning \nin DAY- NRLM.  \n  \n5. Emphasis on Training, Capacity building and skill building:  DAY- NRLM would \nensure that the poor are provided with the requisite skills for managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods, enhancing their credit \nabsorption capacity and credit worthiness, etc. A multi -pronged appr oach is envisaged \nfor continuous capacity building of the targeted families, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders. Particular focus \nwould be on developing and engaging community professionals and community \nresource persons for capacity building of SHGs and their federations and other \ncollectives. DAY-  NRLM would make extensive use of ICT to make knowledge \ndissemination and capacity building more effective. \n \n \n6. Revolving Fund and Community investment support Fund (C.I.F): A Revolving \nFund would be provided to eligible SHGs as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thrift and accumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long- run and \nimmediate consumption needs in the short -run. The C.I.F would be a corpus and used \nfor meeting the members\u2019 credit needs directly and as catalytic capital for leveraging \nrepeat bank finance. The C.I.F would be routed to the SHGs through the Federations. 13  The key   to  coming  out  of  poverty  is  continuous  and  easy  access  to  finance,  at \nreasonable rates, till they accumulate their own funds in large measure.   \n  \n 7. Universal Financial Inclusion: DAY- NRLM would work towards achieving \nuniversal financial inclusion, beyond basic banking services to al l the poor households, \nSHGs and their federations. DAY -NRLM would work on both demand and supply side \nof Financial Inclusion. On the demand side, it would promote financial literacy among \nthe poor and provides catalytic capital to the SHGs and their federations. On the supply \nside, it would coordinate with the financial sector and encourage use of Information, \nCommunication & Technology (ICT) based financial technologies, business \ncorrespondents and community facilitators like \u2018Bank Mitras\u2019. It would also w ork \ntowards universal coverage of rural poor against loss of life, health and assets. Further, \nit would work on remittances, especially in areas where migration is endemic.   \n  \n8. Provision of Interest Subvention: The rural poor need credit at low rate of interest \nand in multiple doses to make their ventures economically viable. In order to ensure \naffordable credit, DAY -NRLM has a provision for subvention on interest rate above 7% \nper annum for all eligible SHGs, who have availed loans from mainstream financial institutions.   \n  \n9. Funding Pattern: DAY- NRLM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the financing \nof the programme would be shared between the Centre and the States in the ratio of \n60:40 (90:10 in case of North Eastern States including Sikkim; completely from the \nCentre in case of UTs). The Central allocation earmarked for the States would broadly \nbe distributed in relation to the incidence of poverty in the States.   \n  \n10. Phased Implementation: Social capital of the poor consists of the institutions of \nthe poor, their leaders, community professionals and more importantly community resource persons (poor women whose lives have been transformed through the \nsupport of their institutions). Building up social capital takes some time in the initial \nyears, but it multiplies rapidly after some time. If the social capital of the poor does not \nplay the lead role in DAY- NRLM, then it would not be a people\u2019s programme. Further, it \nis important to ensure that the quality and  effectiveness of the interventions is not \ndiluted. Therefore, a phased implementation approach is adopted in DAY -NRLM. DAY-\nNRLM would reach all districts by the end of 12th Five- year Plan.   \n  \n11. Intensive blocks. The blocks that are taken up for implementation of DAY -NRLM, \n\u2018intensive blocks\u2019, would have access to a full complement of trained professional staff \nand cover a whole range of activities of universal and intense social and financial \ninclusion, livelihoods, partnerships etc. However, in the remaining blocks or non-\nintensive blocks, the activities may be limited in scope and intensity.   \n  14  12. Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs). RSETI concept is built on \nthe model pioneered by Rural Development Self Employment Institute (RUDSETI) \u2013  a \ncollaborative partnership between SDME Trust and Canara Bank. The model \nenvisages transforming unemployed youth into confident self - employed entrepreneurs \nthrough a short duration experiential learning programme followed by systematic long duration hand holding support. The need- based training builds entrepreneurship \nqualities, improves self -confidence, reduces risk of failure and develops the trainees \ninto change agents. Banks are fully involved in selection, training and post training \nfollow up stages . The needs of the poor articulated through the institutions of the poor \nwould guide RSETIs in preparing the participants/trainees in their pursuits of self - \nemployment and enterprises. DAY -NRLM would encourage public sector banks to set \nup RSETIs in all d istricts of the country.  \n \n \n                 \n     15   \n \nAnnex II   \n  \nInterest Subvention S cheme for Women SHGs  \n \nInterest subvention scheme on Credit to Women SHG s in rural areas would be \navailable in following two ways:  \n I.  Interest subvention scheme on credit to women SHGs in 250 districts:  \n i. All women SHGs would be eligible for Interest subvention on credit up to \u20b93 lakh at \nsubvented rate of 7% per annum. SHGs availing capital subsidy under SGSY in their existing credit outstanding would  not be eligible for benefit under this scheme.  \n ii. The commercial banks  (Public Sector, Private Sector and Small Finance Banks) \nwould lend to all the women SHGs in rural areas at the rate of 7% up to an aggregated \nloan amount of \u20b9 300,000/ - in the 250 districts as provided in Annexure III\n. For the \nwomen SHGs in these districts an additional interest subvention of 3% is also available \non prompt repayment, reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%. \n \niii. All c ommercial banks (Public Sector, Private Sector and Small Finance Banks) \nwould be subvented to the extent of difference between the Weighted Average Interest \nCharged (WAIC as specified by Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance) \nand 7% subject  to the maximum limit of 5.5%. This subvention would be available to all \nthe banks on the condition that they make SHG credit available at 7% p.a. in the 250 districts.  \n iv. Further, the SHGs would  be provided with an additional 3% subvention on the \nprompt repayment of loans. For   the purpose of Interest Subvention of additional 3% on \nprompt repayment, an SHG account would  be considered prompt payee if it satisfies \nthe following criterion.  \n \na. For Cash Credit Limit:  \ni. Outstanding balance shall not have remain ed in excess of the limit/drawing power \ncontinuously for more than 30 days.  \nii. There should be regular credit and debits in the accounts. In any case there shall be at least one customer induced credit during a month.  \niii. Customer induced credit should be sufficient to cover the interest debited during the month.  \n 16  b. For the Term loans: A term loan account where all of the interest payments and/or \ninstalments of principal were paid within 30 days of the due date during the tenure of \nthe loan, would be considered as an account having prompt payment.  \n \nv. The banks should credit the amount of 3% interest subvention to the eligible prompt \npayee SHG loan accounts and seek the reimbursement after the end of reporting quarter.  \n \nvi. The funding for the scheme would be met out of Central Allocation under DAY - \nNRLM  \n \nvii. The interest subvention scheme shall be implemented through a Nodal Bank \nselected by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD).

In order to obviate the time lag between issue of DR orders and payment of DR to the \nbeneficiary and to render expeditious service to senior citizens, the following actions are \nrequired to be taken:  \n \n(a) It has been decided to discontinue the procedure of forwarding government orders \nin respect of dearness relief etc. to pension paying agency banks. Agency Banks \nmay, therefore, act on the copies of  government orders supplied by government to \nthem through post, fax, e- mails or by accessing from the website and authorize \ntheir pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately.  \n(b) All agency banks are advised to scrupulously follow al l the guidelines/instructions \ncontained in various notifications of Government (Central as well as States) and  3  take necessary action immediately without waiting for any further instructions \nfrom RBI . \n \nTiming of pension disbursement by agency banks.  \n3. The pension paying banks will credit the pension amount in the accounts of the \npensioners based on the instructions given by respective Pension Paying Authorities.  \nRefund of excess pension payment to Government  \n \n4. Whenever any excess/overpayment is detected the entire amount thereof \nshould be credited to the Government account in lump sum immediately when the \nexcess/overpayment is due to an error on the part of the agency bank. This action is \nindependent  of recovery from the pensioner.  Agency banks are requested to seek \nguidance from respective Pension Sanctioning Authorities regarding the process to be \nfollowed for recovery of excess pension paid to the pensioners, if any.  \n \n5. If the excess/wrong payment to  the pensioner is due to errors committed by the \ngovernment, banks may take up the matter with the full particulars of the cases with \nrespective Government Department for a quick resolution of the matter. However, this \nmust be a time bound exercise and the government authority\u2019s acknowledgement to \nthis effect must be kept on the bank\u2019s record. The banks may take up such cases with \ngovernment departments without reference to the Reserve Bank of India.  \n \nWithdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacita ted pensioners  \n  \n6. In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners \nin withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorise \nsuch pensioners as  under:  \n \n(a) Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the \nbank.  \n(b) Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also \nnot even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form \ndue to certain physical defect /incapacity.  \n \n7. With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their 4  accounts, banks may follow the procedure as  under:  \n(a) Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it \nshould be identified by two independent witnesses k nown to the bank, one of \nwhom should be a responsible bank official.  \n \n(b) Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also would not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained \non the cheque/withdrawal form, w hich should be identified by two independent \nwitnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official.  \n \n8. Accordingly, the agency banks are requested to instruct their branches to \ndisplay the instructions issued in this regard on their notice board so that sick and \ndisabled pensioners could make full use of these facilities. Agency Banks are also \nadvised to strictly implement the instructions issued by RBI regarding the facilities to be provided to the sick and disabled persons and sensitise staff members in the matter \nand to refer to the FAQs\n on pension disbursement hosted on our website \nwww.rbi.org.in  in case of any doubt.  \n \nReimbursement of pension payments  \n \n9. Link branches of agency banks may submit reimbursement claims to Reserve \nBank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur / Government Banking Division at \nRegional Office for Central/State Government pension payments.  \n \nContinuation of either or survivor pension account after death of pensioner  \n \n10. All agency banks disbursing Central Government pension have been advised that \nin case the spouse (Family pensioner) opts for existing joint account for credit of family pension, banks should not insi st on opening a new account when the spouse is the \nsurvivor and having a joint account with the pensioner and in whose favour an authorisation for payment of family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order  \n(PPO).  5  Life Certificat e - Issuance of Acknowledgement  \n \n11. There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of pension \npaying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order \nto alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to \nmandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also advised to consider \nentering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of ackn owledgement as well as \nreal time updation of records.  \n \nSingle Window System for reimbursement of Pension Payments  \n  \n12. Single Window System was introduced to facilitate prompt settlement of \nreimbursement claims and reconciliation. The underlying objective is to make each \npension paying bank responsible in its own right to effect settlement without the \nintervention of RBI Offices or SBI (at District Headquarters) in the process eliminating \ncause of delay in reimbursement claims.  \n \nCustomer Service \n \n13. All agency banks may issue instructions to their dealing branches to adhere to the \nrecommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee relating to pension payments. A checklist may be provided to the inspecting officers/auditors, which may at a minimum \ninclude the items given in Annex 1\n. Agency banks may also instruct their internal \nauditors/inspectors to comment on the quality of customer service in their reports which \nmay be made available to Reserve Bank\u2019s inspecting officers, as and when they visit the \nbranches.  \n \n14. Grievances of pensioners are not being addressed properly at the branch level \nespecially after the setting up of Centralised Pension Processing Centres  (CPPCs). To \nprovide hassle free service to the pensioners, there should be a forum for regular \ninteraction and settlement of grievances. Accordingly, agency banks should appoint \none/two nodal officers at each Region/Zone for monitoring the resolution of g rievances of 6  pensioners on regular basis and the GM/CGM concerned should review the position at \nmonthly intervals  \n \n15. At locations outside the CPPCs, there should be designated nodal officers for pension \nrelated complaints who should be easily accessible to pensioners and who should hold \nregular meetings at different locations in their jurisdiction on the lines of Pension Adalat. \nEach bank should establish toll free dedicated pension line manned by trained persons \nwith access to the database to answer queries,  note down and redress complaints.  \n \n16. Following several complaints from pensioners alleging inordinate delay in disbursing \nrevised pension and arrears, agency banks are advised as  under:  \n \n(a) Pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in crediting pension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for the delay  after the due date of payment  and the compensation  shall be credited  to the \npensioner's account automatically without any claim from the pensioner on the same  day when the bank affords credit for revised pension/ pension arrears, in \nrespect of all delayed pension payments made since October 1, 2008.  \n(b) Pension paying banks have been advised to put in place a mechanism to obtain \nimmediately the copies of pension or ders from the pension paying authorities \ndirectly and make payments without waiting for receipt of instructions from the \nReserve Bank of India so that pensioners should get benefits announced by the \nGovernments in the succeeding month's pension payment its elf. \n(c) When the agency bank is calculating pension, the branch should continue to be a \npoint of referral for the pensioner lest he/she feel disenfranchised.  \n(d) All branches having pension accounts should guide and assist the pensioners in \nall their dealings wit h the bank.  \n(e) Suitable arrangements should be made to place the arithmetic and other details \nabout pension calculations on the web, to be made available to the pensioners \nthrough the net or at the branches at periodic interval as may be necessary and \nsuffici ent advertisement is made about such arrangements.  7  (f) All claims for agency commission by banks in respect of pension payments must \nbe accompanied by a certificate from ED/CGM in charge of government business \nthat there are no pension arrears to  be credited/ delays in crediting regular \npension/arrears thereof.  \n(g) All agency banks disbursing pension are advised to provide considerate and sympathetic customer service to the pensioners, especially to those pensioners \nwho are of old age.  8  Annex 1 \n \nChecklist  relating  to Government  Business  (pension related)  for \ninternal/concurrent audit  \n \nInternal inspections should assess branch performance in servicing pensioner customers. \nIn this regard, the following may be ensured:  \n \n1. A specific questionnaire covering all aspects of pension payment may be devised for use \nduring inspection of pension paying branches.  \n2. Inspecting officers may also, during inspections, call up pensioners at random and \nenquire about their satisfaction with pension- related services.  \n3. A detailed check -list relating to pension payments/government business may be given by \nbanks to internal auditors/inspectors in order to adhere to the recommendations of the \nPrabhakar Rao Committee, constituted by the Government of  India, relating to pension \npayments/government business.  \n \nThese include the following:  \n \n(a) Whether there is delay in payment of pension, revision of pension, revision in dearness relief etc.  \n(b) Whether the branch manager has structured interaction with a cross section of pensioners serviced at the branch on quarterly basis, where the number of \npensioners of all governments and departments exceeds affixed number, say, 100 \nor 200.  \n(c) Whether nominations have been obtained for all pension accounts.  \n(d) Whether pension acc ounts have been converted into joint accounts wherever \napplicable.  \n(e) Whether the bank branch has an effective complaint redressal mechanism and the complaints of pensioners are attended promptly and their grievances redressed \nexpeditiously.  9  (f) Whether the pension is credited to pensioner\u2019s account during the last four working \ndays of the month except for the month of March for which pension is to be credited \non or after first working day of April.  \n(g) Whether the pension paying branch obtains Life Cert ificate/ Non -employment \ncertificate/Employment Certificate from the pensioners in the month of November \nevery year.  \n(h) Whether pension paying branches deduct income tax at source from pension \npayments wherever applicable.  \n(i) Whether paper tokens in acknowledgement of cheques presented are invariably \ngiven by the tax collecting branches.  \n(j) Whether the challans are stamped giving bank\u2019s BSR code and Challan \nIdentification Number (CIN)  clearly.  \n(k) Whether the stamped challans are kept  in the custody of bank\u2019s staff and handed \nover to the concerned tax payer only on production of the paper token.  10  Appendix  \n \nList of circulars consolidated for the Master Circular  \n \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.130/45.01.001/2002 - \n03 30.08.2002  Single Window System for Reimbursement of \npension payments made to Central Government \nCivil Pensioners by public sector banks  \n2 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.H - \n506/45.01.001/2002- 03 12.04.2003  Payment of Pension to Government Pensioners \nthrough Public Sector Banks \u2013  Steps taken by \nGovernment to minimize delay in payment of \nDearness Relief (DR) to Pensioners \u2013 \nDiscontinuation of forwarding Government  orders \nin respect  of DR etc. through Reserve Bank of \nIndia. \n3 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No11303/45.01.0\n03/2005- 06 06.02.2006  Disbursement of pension through Public  Sector \nBanks \u2013 Payment of Dearness Relief (DR)  \n4 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No. H- \n3085/45.01.001/2008- 09 01.10.2008  Recommendations of the Prabhakar Rao \nCommittee on customer service \u2013  Pension \nPayments.  \n5 DGBA.GAD.No  H-3078/45.01.001/2008 -09 01.10.2008  Establishment of Centralised Pension  Processing \nCentre (CPPC)  \n6 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.H -\n7652/45.05.031/2008- 09 03.03.2009  Scheme for payment o f pension to Central \nGovernment Civil/Defence/Railway/Telecom/ \nFreedom Fighters/ State Governments \nPensioners  by Public Sector Banks -Staggering of \npension payments by PSBs.  \n7 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.H -\n10450/45.03.001/2008 -09 01.06.2009  Recovery / Refund of overpayment of  pension to \nthe Government Account.  \n8 Ref.DGBA.GAD.No.H 3194/45.01.001/2\n009-10 14.10.2009  Scheme for payment of pension to Central Civil/ \nDefence/ Railway/Telecom Pensioners/ Freedom \nFighters/ State Governments' Pensioners through \nPublic Sector Banks - Facility for withdrawal of  \npension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated \npensioners.  \n9 Ref.DO.No.CSD.CO/8793/13.01.001/200 9\n-10 09.04.2010  Pension Payment to central/  State Govt. \nPensioners by agency Banks -Compensation for \ndelay  \n10 DGBA.GAD.

The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the \nCentral and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the \nagency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual \nagreement. RBI pays agency commission to the agency banks for the g overnment \nbusiness handled by them. This Master Circular consolidates the instructions contained in the circulars listed in Annex  1\n. \nGovernment transactions eligible for agency commission  \n2. Trans actions relat ing to the following government business undertaken by \nagency banks are eligible for agency commission paid by RBI : \n(a) Revenue receipts and payments on behalf of the Central/State Government s \n(b) Pension payments in respect of Central / State Governments  and \n(c) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank as eligible for \nagency commission  \n \n3. The Agency banks also undertake the work related to Small Savings Schemes  \n(SSS)  the commission for which is borne by Government of India.  Though the \nsettlement of commission on such SSS is processed by RBI  and settled at Central \nAccounts Section (CAS), Nagpur , the rates of agency commission related to SSS \ntransactions  are decided by Government of India.  Agency commission claims on \nSpecial D eposit Scheme ( SDS) related transactions (where mirror accounts are \nmaintained in RBI) are also settled at CAS, Nagpur.  \n4. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from \nfinancial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commission as these \ntransactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business.  Reserve Bank pays t he agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for \nacting as agents for management of public debt.  \n5. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical mode or e- mode \n(challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the \nagency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive remuneration from the State Government for doing this work.  \n6. If the agency bank is engaged by the State Government as Franking Vendor \nand it collects stamp duty from the publ ic for franking the documents, it will not be \neligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to it as Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects  the stamp duty paid \nby the Franking Vendor for credit to the Treasury through challan in physical or e-mode for purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since it is a regular payment of Stamp Duty as stated above.  \n 3 \n Government transactions not eligible for agency commission  \n7. Agency banks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or \nthrough authorised branches of any other agency bank including  State Bank of India \nor offices of Reserve Bank of India wherever they do not have their own authorised \ndirect tax collection branch sho uld indicate the same separately in the scroll. Such \ntransactions will not be eligible for payment of agency commission. Banks should furnish a certificate to the effect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) \npaid by them have been excluded while claiming agency commission.  \n8. The following activities , inter alia,  do not come under the purview of agency \nbank business and are therefore not eligible for payment of agency commission.  \n(a) Furnishing of bank guarantees/security deposits, etc . through agency  banks \nby government contractors/suppliers, which constitute banking transactions \nundertaken by banks for their customers.  \n(b) The banking business of autonomous/statutory bodies /Municipalities / \ncompanies/ Corporations/Local Bodies.  \n(c) Paym ents which have been classified as capital in nature by government to \ncover losses incurred by autonomous/statutory bodies/ Municipalities/ Corporations/Local Bodies , etc.  \n(d) Prefunded schemes which may be implemented by a Central Government Ministry/Dep artment (in consultation with CGA) and a State Government \nDepartment through any bank . \n(e) Transactions related to Gold Monetisation Scheme 2015  \n \n(f) Transactions arising out of Letters of Credit / Bank Guarantee opened by \nbanks on behalf of Ministries/Departments etc. do not qualify for agency \ncommission as RBI only reimburses the paid amount to the banks based on \nthe mandate received from the governments.  \n \n(g) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank or Central or \nState Govern ment as ineligible for agency commission  \n9. Agency Banks are advised to meticulously follow instructions issued by RBI \nfrom time to time regarding transactions which are not eligible for agency commission \nand submit their claims for agency commission accordi ngly. All agency banks while \nclaiming agency commission should certify that no claim of agency commission is made on ineligible transactions.  \n \n \n 4 \n Reporting of transactions by agency banks to RBI   \n10. After the operationalisation of NEFT 24X7 and RTGS 24X7, agency banks \nauthorised to collect GST shall upload their luggage files in RBI\u2019s QPX/E -Kuber on all \ndays except the Global holidays, which are January 26, August 15, October 2, all \nnon-working Saturdays, all Sundays and any other day declared holiday by RB I for \nGovernment Transactions due to exigencies .  \n11. State government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) of \nprevious month reported after 8th of the succeeding month and those pertaining to earlier months should be reported to RBI through a separate statement for \naccounting, after being confirmed by the competent authorities of concerned state government.  \n12. For Central Government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) \nor any adjustments thereof , if reported after a gap of 90 da ys from the date of \ntransaction, agency banks have to obtain prior approval from concerned ministry/department and submit the same to RBI separately at the time of reporting such transactions for settlement.   \nRates for agency commission  \n13. As per a gency bank agreement, RBI pays agency commiss ion at rate s \ndetermined by it. The rates applicable with effect from July 1, 2019 are as under:  \nSr.No. Type of Transaction  Unit Revised Rate  \na.  (i) Receipts - Physical mode  Per transaction   \u20b940/- \n (ii) Receipts - e-mode Per transaction   \u20b99/- \nb. Pension Payments  Per transaction   \u20b975/- \nc. Payments other than Pension  Per \u20b9100 turnover  6.5 paise per \u20b9100 \n 14. In this context, the \u2018Receipts -e-mode transactions\u2019 indicated against Sr. No. \na.(ii) in  the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from \nthe remitter\u2019s bank account through internet banking as well as such transactions \nwhich  do not involve physical  receipt of cash /instruments  at all . For example,  \nchallan generated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with \ncash/instrument should be treated as transaction under physical mode.   \n 15. With reference to the implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) \nregime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), \nprocessed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number (CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if \nmultiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This \nmeans that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such  records clubbed under a single challan 5 \n i.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming \nagency commission  effective J uly 1, 2017.  \n \n16. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that \na single challan (electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only and not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts that will get credited.  Therefore, records clubbed \nunder a si ngle challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single \ntransaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission.   \n17. Agency banks would be eligible to claim agency commission for pension \ntransactions at the rate of \u20b975 per transaction only when the entire work relating to \ndisbursement of pension including pension calculation is attended to by them . If the \nwork relating to pension calculations, etc., is attended to by the concerned \nGovernment Department / Treasury and the bank s are required only to credit the \namount of pension to the pensioners' accounts maintained with them by a single \ndebit to Government Account, such transaction is to be categorised under \u2018other than \npension payment\u2019 and would be eligible for payment of agenc y commission @ 6.5  \npaise per \u20b9 100/- turnover w.e.f. July 1, 2019 . \n18. The number of transactions eligible for payment of agency commission should \nnot exceed 14 per pensioner per year.  This includes one monthly credit for payment \nof net pension and a maximum of two per year for payment of arrears on account of increase in dearness relief, if applicable. Cases involving payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension qualifies as a single transaction for claiming of \nagency commission. In other words, any payment of arrears on account of late \nstart/restart of pension should be treated as a single credit transaction and not as separate monthly credits.  \n19. Agency commission is payable to an agency bank at the full rate provided the \ntransactions are handled by the bank at all stages.  Where, however, the work is \nshared between two banks, the agency commission is shared between the banks in \nthe proportion of 75:25.  Thus, broadly, the agency commission is payable to the \nagency  banks as detailed below:  \n(a) At the full rate, in cases where the transactions are handled by the bank at all \nstages, i.e.,  upto the stage of dispatch of scrolls and challans / cheques to the \nPay and Accounts Offices,  and treasuries/sub- treasuries .  \n(b) At 75% of the applicable  rate, where the dealing branch is required to account \nfor the transaction by passing on the scrolls and documents to the local/nearest branch of Reserve Bank of India or by any agency bank \nconducting government business.  \n(c) At 25% of the applicable rate , in the case of agency branch which received the \nscrolls and documents from dealing branches of other banks and is responsible for the account ing of these transactions and dispatching of the \nscrolls and documents to the Pay and Accounts Offices, Treasuries, et c. 6 \n 20. All agency banks should settle their agency transactions for both funds and \nagency commission directly with the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank \ninstead of routing them through any other agency bank that acts as aggregator in \ncertain cases.  So also for payments made by all agency banks on behalf of state \ngovernment/s get directly settled with the concerned Regional Office of RBI. Agency \nTransaction details/scrolls may be sent directly by individual agency bank to the concerned State Government/T reasury.  This new arrangement for settlement of state \ngovernment funds on day to day basis (receipts and payments) directly with Reserve Bank is with effect from January 1, 2018.  \n \nClaiming  agency commission  \n21. Agency banks are required to submit their claims  for agency commission in \nthe prescribed format to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions and the respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for  State government \ntransactions.  However, agency commission claims with respect to GST  receipt \ntransactions will be settled at Mumbai Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India only \nand accordingly all agency banks, authorized to collect GST, are advised to submit \ntheir agency commission claims pertaining to GST receipt transactions at Mumbai  \nRegional Office only. The formats  for claiming agency commission for all agency \nbanks and separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the branch officials and Chartered Accountants or Cost Accountants are given in Annex 2\n, \nAnnex 2A  and Annex 2B  respectively . These certificates would be in addition to the \nusual Certificate from ED / CGM (in charge of government business) to the effect that there are no pension arrears to be credited / delays in crediting regular pension / \narrears thereof . \n22. Where the External Auditor is also the Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor, \nclaims can be certified by such Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor. In addition to this, agency banks are required to ensure that the agency bank\u2019s internal inspectors / auditors verify the agency commission claims submitted by their branches and \nconfirm their accuracy during the course of their inspection / audit.  \n \n23. Reference is also drawn to the instructions contained in our letter dated \nNovember 4, 2016 advising the process of claiming reimbursement of service tax \n(ST) on agency commission received for Central and State Government transactions, \ncentrally from Reserve Bank of India at Central Acc ounts Section, Nagpur. The same \nprocess continued even after Service Tax got subsumed into the Goods and Service Tax (GST) framework. This process of centralised claims submission has been \nreplaced with a system whereby applicable GST (18% at present) shal l be paid along \nwith agency commission by the respective Regional Offices of RBI / CAS, Nagpur as \nthe case may be.  \n 24. For eligible government transactions done with effect from July 01, 2019, \nagency banks shall submit the agency commission claims, including applicable GST amount, as per revised agency commission rates indicated above, to RBI at 7 \n respective ROs / CAS, Nagpur as per the extant instructions issued by RBI in this \nregard. TDS on GST shall be deducted as applicable by RBI at the time of making agenc y commission payment in accordance with Government instructions in the \nmatter.  \n 25. However, for eligible government transactions done by agency banks upto \nJune 30, 2019, agency banks shall continue to submit agency commission claims as \nwell as the centralized claims for ST/GST reimbursement as hitherto.  \n26. Agency banks are required to ensure that agency commission claims \nsubmitted to the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India / Central Accounts \nSection, Nagpur as applicable in the prescribed format are accurat e.  Agency banks \nmay also alert their branches concerned to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to our Regional Offices are accurate.  Such erroneous claims, if certified by the Internal / Concurrent Auditors, will defeat the very purpose of mak ing such \nrequirement an essential condition for making quarterly claims.  \n27. Agency banks are advised to furnish their claim on agency commission to \nReserve Bank within 60 calendar days from the end of the quarter in which the \ntransactions have been conducted.   If the banks fail to lodge the claims within the \nstipulated period mentioned above they may forward the same to RBI only after giving reasons for delay.   \n \nPenal interest for wrong claims  \n \n28. As per the agreement that agency banks have with RBI, violation or non-\ncompliance of inst ructions issued by Government or  Reserve Bank shall attract \nimposition of penalty.\n Agency banks will be liable to pay penal interest at Bank Rate \nas notified by Reserve Bank of India plus 2% for any wrong claims of agency commissio n settled.  \n \n \n \n \n 8 \n Annex  1 \nList of circulars consolidated in the Master Circular  \n \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

Credit Facilities to Minority Communities : \n \nThe Government of I ndia has indicated that care should be taken to see that minority \ncommunities secure, in a fair and adequate measure the benefits flowing from various \nGovernment sponsored schemes. Accordingly, a ll commercial banks are  advised to \nensure smooth flow of bank  credit to minority communities.  \n \nGovernment of India has also forwarded a list of 121 minority concentration districts having at least 25% minority population, excluding those States / UTs where minorities \nare in majority (J & K, Punjab, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Lakshadweep). \nAccordingly , all scheduled commercial banks are advised to specially monitor the credit \nflow to minorities in these 121 districts, thereby, ensuring that the minority communities receive a fair and equitable portion of the cre dit within the overall \ntarget of the priority sector  (list of Minority Concentration Districts at Annexure I\n). \n \nIn terms of Reserve Bank's extant guidelines on lending to priority sector, a target of 40 \npercent of Adjusted Net Bank  Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent amount of Off -\nBalance Sheet Exposures (OBE), whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for lending to the priority sector by domestic scheduled \ncommercial banks and foreign banks with 20 and above branches , for Small Finance \nBanks it is 75% of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) . Within this , a sub -target of \n12 per cent  of ANBC or Credit Equivalent amount of OBE, whichever is higher, as on \nMarch 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for lending to weaker sections which includes, among others, persons from minority communities.   Revised targets for \nweaker sections  shall be implemented in a phased manner as indicated in Para 5.2 of  \nRBI Master Direction s on Priority Sector lending (Tar gets and Classification) dated \nSeptember 04, 2020  \n \n \n2. Definition of Minority Communities  \n \n2.1 The following communities have been notified as minority communities by the \nGovernment of India,  Ministry  of Minority Affairs ; \n(a) Sikhs   \n(b) Muslims   \n(c) Christ ians  \n(d) Zoroastrians   \n(e) Buddhists  \n(f) Jains   \n  \n2 \n  \n  \n2.2 In  the case of a partnership firm, if the majority of the partners belong to one or the \nother of the specified minority communities, advances granted to such partnership \nfirms may be treated as advances granted to minority communities. Further, if the \nmajority beneficial ownership in a partnership firm belongs to the minority \ncommunity, then such lending can be classified as advances to the specified \ncommunities. A company has a separate legal entity and hence advances granted \nto it cannot be classified as advances to the specified minority communities.  \n \n3. Creation of Special Cell and Designating an exclusive Officer  \n \n3.1 A Special Cell should be set up in each bank to ensure smooth flow of credit to \nminority communities and it should be headed by an officer holding the rank of      \nDeputy General Manager/Assistant General Manager or any other similar rank who should function as a 'Nodal Officer'.  \n \n3.2  The Lead Bank in each of the minority concentration districts should have an officer \nwho shall exclusively l ook after the problems regarding the credit flow to minority \ncommunities. It shall be his responsibility to publicise among the minority \ncommunities various programmes of bank credit and also to prepare suitable \nschemes for their benefit in collaboration with branch managers.  \n \n3.3 The designated officer should exclusively look after aspects relating to credit \nassistance to minority communities in the concerned districts. The designated officer may be attached to the Lead Bank set up at the district level. He would thus, be able \nto receive necessary guidance from Lead Bank Officer, who will be senior enough and have adequate experience for liaising effectively with the other credit institutions \nand Gov ernment agencies and will also be working in close collaboration with the \nbranch managers of other banks in the district. The designated officer will also arrange group meetings for their guidance for formulation of schemes suitable for \nthe members of the minority communities. It will be necessary for the banks \nconcerned to ensure that the role assigned to the designated officer/s is effectively fulfilled.  \n \n3.4 The Convenor banks of the District Consultative Committees (DCCs) and the State           \n       Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs) should ensure that steps taken to facilitate the   \n      flow of credit to the minority communities and the progress made in this regard are  \n      reviewed regularly at their meetings.   \n  \n3 \n  \n \n3.5  The Convenor banks of DLRC/SLRM/SL BCs may invite Chairman/ Managing \nDirectors of State Minority Commissions/Boards or the State Minorities Financial \nCorporations or their representatives to attend the meetings of District Level Review \nCommittee (DLRC), State Level Review Meeting (SLRM) and State Level Bankers \nCommittee (SLBC).  \n \n \n3.6  Names, designation and office addresses of (i) the officer -in-charge of the Special \nCell at Head Office and (ii) officer appointed by Lead Banks in the identified districts to look after exclusively the problems of  minority communities, should be furnished \nby banks to the National Commission for Minorities at the following address and updated periodically:  \nThe Secretary  \nNational Commission for Minorities  \nGovernment of India  \n5\nth Floor ,Lok Nayak Bhawan \nKhan Market  \nNew Delhi 110 003  \n \nA copy of the relevant communication may also be furnished to Financial Inclusion  \nand Development  Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai.  \n \n \n3.7  The Lead Banks in the identified districts having concentration of minority \ncomm unities may involve the State Minority Commission / Finance Corporation in \nthe extension work including creating awareness, identification of beneficiaries, \npreparation of viable projects, provision of backward and forward linkages such as \nsupply of inputs /marketing, recovery etc.  \n \n3.8  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may collaborate with DDMs of NABARD/ \nNGOs/ Voluntary Organizations in reaching the poor through Self Help Groups (SHGs). Lead Banks of the Minority Concentration Districts will have to exercise the \npro-active role expected of them to ensure that the minority communities, \nparticularly those who are poor and illiterate have access to bank credit for taking up \nproductive activities.  \n \n4 Advances under DRI Scheme  \nBanks may route loans under the DRI scheme through State Minority \nFinance/Development Corporation on the same terms and conditions as are \napplicable to loans routed through SC/ST Development Corporations, subject to the \nbeneficiaries of the Corporations meeting the eligibility criteria and other terms and  \n  \n4 \n conditions prescribed under the scheme. Banks may ensure proper maintenance of \nthe register to evolve timely sanction and disbursement of loan applications.  \n \n5.   Monitoring  \n5.1  With a view to monitoring the performance of banks in providi ng credit to the \nspecified minority communities, data on credit assistance provided to members of \nminority communities should be furnished to Reserve Bank of India and to the \nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Minority Affairs, on hal f \nyearly basis as at the end of March and September every year. The statements \n(given in Annexure II ) should reach RBI within one month from the end of each half \nyear.\u201d  \n \n \n5.2  The Conveno r banks of the District Consultative Committees in the identified \nminority concentrated districts should furnish the data on priority sector advances \ngranted by banks to specified minority communities compiled by them in the \nprescribed format (vide Annexure III ) for the district  under their lead responsibility to \nthe concerned Regional Offices of RBl within one month from the close of the relative quarter.  \n \n5.3  The progress made in regard to the flow of credit to the minority communities \nshould be reviewed regularly at the meetings  of the District Consultative \nCommittees (DCCs) and the State Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs).  \n \n \n5.4  The Lead Banks in the identified minority concentrated districts should furnish the \nrelevant extracts of the agenda notes and the minutes of the meetings of the DCCs and of the respective SLBCs to the Union Ministry of Finance and to the Ministry of \nMinority Affairs  on a quarterly basis for their use.  \n \n6 Training  \n \n6.1  With a view to ensuring that the bank staff and officers have proper perspective and \nappreciation of the various programmes for welfare of minorities, necessary \norientation may be provided to officials and other staff. For this purpose, banks \nshould include suitable lecture sessions as part of all relevant training programmes \nlike induction courses, pr ogrammes on rural lending, financing of priority sectors, \npoverty alleviation programmes, etc.  \n \n6.2  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may sensitise and motivate the staff \nposted to identified districts through proper training to assist the minority \ncommunities under various credit schemes.   \n  \n5 \n  \n6.3  The Lead Banks may organize sensitization workshops for bank officials regarding \nmicro credit/ lending to SHGs with the help of DDMs of NABARD.  \n \n6.4  The Lead Banks functioning in the identified districts should organize Entrepreneur \nDevelopment Programmes so that the members of the minority communities in \nthese areas are enabled to derive the benefit of various programmes being financed \nby the banks. Depending upon the major vocation and type of activity undertaken by  \nlarge sections of the people in the districts, suitable programmes may be organized in co -operation with State Governments, Industries Department, District Industries \nCentre, SIDBI, State Technical Consultancy Organization, Khadi and Village \nIndustries Commission and other voluntary organizations which are fully equipped to \nimpart such training and orientation. The duration of the programme, the course \ncontent, the faculty support to be selected etc. should be decided by each Lead \nBank taking into account the prevailing conditions, need and existing skills as well \nas aptitude of the people in the district.  \n \n7 Publicity  \n \n7.1  There should be good publicity about various anti -poverty programmes of the \nGovernment where there is large concentration of minority communities and \nparticularly in the districts listed in the Annexure I  which have a concentration of \nminority communities.  \n \n7.2  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may create awareness among minority \ncommunities regarding credit faci lities available from banks through appropriate \nmeasures which may include publicity through (i) print media i.e. distribution of pamphlets in local languages, advertisements/articles in newspapers etc. (ii) TV \nchannels - DD/ local channels, (iii) particip ation / setting up of stalls in the Melas / \nfairs organized during the religious /festive occasions by these communities.  \n \n8.   National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC)  \n 8.1  National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC ) was \nestablished in September 1994 to promote economic and developmental activities for the backward sections amongst the minorities. NMDFC works as an apex body \nand channelises its funds to the beneficiaries through the State Minority Finance \nCorporation  of the respective State/Union Territory Governments.  \n \n  \n  \n6 \n  \n \n8.2  The NMDFC is operating, inter -alia, the Margin Money Scheme. Bank finance \nunder the scheme will be upto 60 percent of the project cost. The remaining amount \nof the project cost is shared by NMDFC, the State channelising agency and the \nbeneficiary in the proportion of 25%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. Banks may \nimplement the Margin Money scheme evolved by NMDFC. While extending bank \nfinance, banks should bear in mind the guidelines/instructions issued by RBI from \ntime to time on priority sector advances. It may be ensured that the assets created \nout of the loan amount are mortgaged / hypothecated to the banks. Where \nrecoveries have been made by the banks, it would be in order if the amounts are \nappropri ated first towards bank dues.  \n \n9 Prime Minister\u2019s 15 Point Programme for the Welfare of Minorities  \nGovernment of India has revised the \u201cPrime Minister\u2019s New 15- Point Programme for \nthe Welfare of Minorities\u201d. An important objective of the Programme is to ensure that \nan appropriate percentage of the priority sector lending is targeted for the minority \ncommunities and that the benefits of various government sponsored schemes reach \nthe under -privileged, which includes the disadvantaged sections of the minority \ncommunities. The New Programme is to be implemented by the Central \nMinistries/Departments concerned through State Governments/Union Territories \nand envisages location of certain proportion of development projects in minority \nconcentration districts. Accordingly, all scheduled commercial banks are required to \nensure that within the overall target for priority sector lending and the sub- target of \n12 percent for the weaker sections, sufficient care is taken to ensure that minority \ncommunities also receive an equitable portion of the credit. Lead Banks have been advised to keep this requirement in view while preparing district credit plans.  \n  \n                                            ------------------------------------  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n7 \n  \nAnnexure I \nList of 121 Minority Co ncentration Districts  \n(Vide paragraph 3.3, 5.3 and 7.1)  \nSl.

With a view to sustain these efforts and to ensure \ndiscipline among the banks on timely and accurate reporting of currency chest transactions, we have issued instructions on the subject.  \n2. The Master Direction enclosed incorporates updated guidelines / circulars on the subject. The Direction will be updated from time to time as and when fresh instructions \nare issued.  \n3. This  Master Direction  has been placed on RBI website at  www.rbi.org.in\n. \nYours faithfully,  \n \n(Ishan Shukla)  \nChief General Manager  \nEncl : As above \n  \nAnnex  \nMaster Direction on Levy of Penal Interest for Delayed Reporting / Wrong \nReporting / Non- Reporting of Currency Chest Transactions and Inclusion of \nIneligible Amounts in Currency Chest Balances  \n1. Penal interest for Delayed Reporting / Wrong Reporting / Non- Reporting of \nCurrency Chest Transactions  \n1.1 Reporting of Currency Chest Transactions  \nThe minimum amount of deposit into / withdrawal from currency chest will be \u20b9 1,00,000 \nand thereafter, in multiples of \u20b9 50,000.  \n1.2 Time limit for Reporting  \n1.2.1 The currency chests should invariably report all transactions through CyM \u2013  CC \nportal on the same day by  7 pm . \n1.2.2 Relaxation in respect of strike period in banks  \nRelaxation in the reporting period on account of strike situation will be considered on case -to-case basis.  \n1.3 Levy of penal interest \u2013  \n1.3.1 Delay in Reporting -  \nIn the event of delay in reporting currency chest transactions, penal interest at the rate indicated in paragr aph 3 of this circular will be levied on the  amount due  from the chest \nholding bank for the period of delay. Penal interest will be calculated on T+0 basis i.e. penal interest will be levied in respect of transactions not reported by currency chests to \nthe Issue Office on the same business day within the time limit prescribed above.  \n1.3.2 Wrong reporting \nPenal interest will be levied in respect of cases of wrong reporting in the same manner \ntill the date of receipt of corrected advice by Reserve Bank. As de bits/credits to banks' \ncurrent accounts are raised on the basis of the transactions reported by the currency \nchests, penal interest will invariably be levied in all cases of wrong reporting by the currency chests. It is expected that currency chests would ensure the correctness of \nfigures reported on the CyM - CC portal. Particular care should be taken to ensure that \nremittances of fresh notes/notes to the currency chests are not reported as 'deposit' transactions on the portal.  \n1.3.3 Penal interest for inclusion of ineligible amounts in the currency chest balances  \n(i) Penal interest will be levied in all cases where the bank has enjoyed 'ineligible' credit in its current account with Reserve Bank on account of wrong reporting / delayed \nreporting / non- repor ting of transactions. Penal measures will also be taken in cases of \nshortages in chest balances / remittances, shortages due to pilferage / frauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest balances / remittances as per the prevailing \n\u201cScheme of Penalties\u201d.  \n(ii) Further, only cash held in the custody of joint custodians and 'freely available' to them is eligible for inclusion in the chest balances. Thus, cash kept for safe custody in \nsealed covers for whatever reasons/cash in trunks/bins under the lock and key of any \nofficial/s other than the Joint Custodians or bearing a third lock put by any official in \naddition to the two locks of the Joint Custodians is not eligible for being included in the chest balances. If such amounts are included in the chest balances, these will be \ntreated as instances of wrong reporting and will attract penal interest at the rate \nspecified in Para 3.  \n(iii) In all the above cases (excepting shortages in chest balances / remittances, shortages due to pilferage / frauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest balances / \nremittances), penal interest will be levied from the date of inclusion of 'ineligible' \namounts in chest balances till the exclusion of such amounts from chest balances. \nPenal measures for shortages in chest balances / r emittances, shortages due to \npilferage / frauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest balances / remittances will be taken on the basis of prevailing \u201cScheme of Penalties\u201d.  \n \n  \n2 Levy of penalty  \n2.1 Reporting of Soiled note remittances to RBI  \nSoiled note remittances to RBI should not be shown as withdrawal by chest/s. In case \nsuch remittances to RBI are wrongly reported as 'withdrawals', a penalty of \u20b9 50,000 will \nbe levied irrespective of the value of remittance and period of such wrong reporting.  \n2.2 Reporting of diversions in CyM \u2013  CC portal  \nAll currency chest diversions (both between chests of the same bank and between \nchests of different banks) have to be reported through \u2018Diversion Module\u2019 of CyM -CC \nPortal. The CC sending the diversion should initiat e the diversion entry. The receiving \nCC should acknowledge the same. Diversions must not be reported as \nDeposit/Withdrawal. A penalty of \u20b9 50,000 will be levied for such wrong reporting.  \n2.3 Delayed reporting where currency chests had \u201cNet Deposit\u201d  \nPenal i nterest at the prevailing rate for delayed reporting of the instances where the \ncurrency chest had reported \u201cnet deposit\u201d may not be charged. However, in order to \nensure proper discipline in reporting currency chest transactions, a flat penalty of \u20b9 \n50,000  may be levied on the currency chests for delayed reporting irrespective of the \nvalue of net deposit.  \n3. Rate of penal interest  \nPenal interest shall be levied at the rate of 2% over the prevailing Bank Rate for the period of delayed reporting/wrong reporti ng/non- reporting /inclusion of ineligible \namounts in chest balances.  \n4. Representations  \n4.1 As the sole criterion for levy of penal interest for  delayed reporting is the number of \ndays of delay, there should ordinarily be no occasion for banks to request f or \nreconsideration of the Reserve Bank's decision in individual cases. However, representations, if any, on account of genuine difficulties faced by chests especially in \nhilly/remote areas and those affected by natural calamities, etc., may be made to the Issue Office concerned through the Head / Controlling office of the bank concerned \nwithin a month from the date of debit of the bank concerned.  \n4.2 In the case of  wrong reporting representations for waiver will not be considered. \n{cf. para 1.3.2 above}.  \n4.3 As the intention behind the levy of penal interest is to inculcate discipline among \nbanks so as to ensure prompt/correct reporting, pleas by banks for waiver of penal \ninterest on grounds that delayed/wrong/non- reporting did not result in utilization of t he \nReserve Bank's funds or shortfall in the maintenance of CRR/SLR or that they were the result of clerical mistakes, unintentional or arithmetical errors, first time error, \ninexperience of staff etc., will  not be considered as valid grounds for waiver of penal \ninterest. Further, we will take a serious view of all such lapses.  \n-------------------------  \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/77MD01042021E0839C3AEC50408A8570A02A57D40E4F.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 01, 2021", "info": " \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f  \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\ufffd  \u092c\ufffd\u0915  \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA  \nwww.rbi.org.in   \n\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092c\u0902\u0927 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , 4\u0925\u093e \u0924\u0932, \u0905\u092e\u0930 \u092d\u0935\u0928, \u092a\u0940 .\u090f\u092e\u0964 \u092e\u093e\u0917\ufffd , \u092b\u094b\u091f\ufffd, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 400001 \nDepartment of Currency Management, 4th Floor, Amar Building, P.M.

A \nrevised version of  Master Circular on the subject is annexed for your information and \nnecessary action. This Master Circular is placed on our website www.rbi.org.in . \nYours faithfully  \n(Ishan Shukla)  \nChief General Manager  \nEncl:  As above \n \n \n   \n \n \nMaster Circular \u2013  Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated April  01, 2021  \n1. Facility for Exchange o f Notes a nd Coins a t Bank Branches  \n(a) All branches of banks in all parts of the country are mandated to provide the \nfollowing customer services, more actively and vigorously to the members of public \nso that there is no need for them to approach the RBI Regional Offices for this \npurpose:  \n(i) Issuing fresh / good quality notes and coins of all denominations,  \n(ii) Exchanging soiled / mutilated  / defective notes,*  \n* Small Finance Banks and Payment Banks may exchange mutilated and defective notes at their option.  \nand \n(iii) Accepting coins and notes either for transactions or exchange.  \nIt will be preferable to accept coins, particularly, in the denom inations of \u20b91 and \u20b92, \nby weighment. However, accepting coins packed in sachets of 100 each would \nperhaps be more convenient for the cashiers as well as the customers. Such sachets \nmay be kept at the counters and made available to the customers.  \n(b) All br anches should provide the above facilities to members of public without any \ndiscrimination on all working days. The scheme of providing exchange facility by a \nfew select currency chest branches on one of the Sundays in a month will remain unchanged. The names and addresses of such bank branches should be available \nwith the respective banks.  \n(c) The availability of the above- mentioned facilities at the bank branches should be \ngiven wide publicity for information of the public at large.  \n(d) None of the bank branches should refuse to accept small denomination notes \nand / or coins tendered at their counters. All coins in the denomination of 50 paise, \n\u20b91, \u20b92,  \u20b95, \u20b910 and \u20b920 of various sizes, theme and design issued from time to time \nby the Government of India continue to be legal tender.  2. Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 [ as Amended by Reserve \nBank of India (Note Refund) Amendment Rules, 2018] -  Delegation of P owers \n(a) In terms of Section 28 read with Section 58 (2) of Reserve Bank of India Act, \n1934, no person is entitled as a right to recover from the Government of India or RBI \nthe value of any lost, stolen, mutilated or imperfect currency note of the GOI or banknote.  However, with a view to mitigating the hardship to the public in genuine \ncases, it has been provided that the RBI may, with the previous sanction of the Central Government, prescribe the circumstances in, and the conditions and limitations subject to whic h, the value of such currency notes or banknotes may be \nrefunded as a matter of grace.  \n(b) With a view to extending the facility for the benefit and convenience of public, all \nbranches of banks have been delegated powers under Rule 2(j) of Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 [as A mended by Reserve Bank of India (Note \nRefund) Amendment Rules, 2018] (hereinafter referred to as NRR, 2009) for \nexchange of mutilated / defective notes free of cost.  \n(c) The NRR, 2009 were amended to enable the public to exchange mutilated notes \nin Mahatma Gandhi (New) series, which are smaller in size compared to the earlier \nseries. The minimum area of the single largest undivided piece of the note required for payment of full value for notes of rupees fifty and above denominations were also revised. The Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Amendment Rules, 2018 have \nsince been notified in the Gazette of India on September 6, 2018.  \n3. Liberalized D efinition of a Soiled Not e \nIn order to facilitate quicker exchange facilities, the definition of soiled note has been \nexpanded. A \u2018soiled note\u2019 means a note which has become dirty due to normal wear and tear and also includes a two piece note pasted together wherein both the piece s \npresented belong to the same note and form the entire note with no essential feature missing. These notes should be accepted over bank counters in payment of Government dues and for credit to accounts of the public maintained with banks. However, in no c ase, these notes should be issued to the public as re- issuable notes \nand shall be deposited in currency chests for onward transmission to RBI offices as \nsoiled note remittances for further processing.  4. Mutilated Notes \u2013  Presentation and Passing \nA mutilat ed note is a note of which a portion is missing or which is composed of \nmore than two pieces. Mutilated notes may be presented at any of the bank \nbranches. The notes so presented shall be accepted, exchanged and adjudicated in \naccordance with NRR, 2009.  \n5. Extremely Brittle, Burnt, Charred, Stuck- Up Notes \nNotes which have turned extremely brittle or are badly burnt, charred or inseparably \nstuck up together and, therefore, cannot withstand normal handling, shall not be accepted by the bank branches for exchange. Instead, the holders may be advised to tender these notes to the Issue Office of Reserve Bank of India concerned where \nthey will be adjudicated under a Special Procedure.  \n6. Procedure f or Exchange o f Soiled/  Mutilated/  Imperfect Notes \n6.1 Exchange of Soiled Notes  \n6.1.1 Notes presented in small number: Where the number of notes presented by \na person is up to 20 pieces with a maximum value of \u20b95, 000 per day, banks should \nexchange them over the counter, free of charge.  \n6.1.2 Notes presented in bulk:  Where the number of notes presented by a person \nexceeds 20 pieces or \u20b95, 000 in value per day, banks may accept them, against \nreceipt, for value to be credited later. Banks may levy service charges as permitted in Master Circular on Customer Service in Banks (DBR.No.Leg.BC.21/09.07.006/2015- 16 dated July 1, 2015). In case tendered value \nis above \u20b950, 000, banks are expected to take the usual precautions.  \n6.2 Exchange o f Mutilated a nd Imperfect Notes  \n6.2.1 While designated branches may continue to follow the procedure as laid down \nin Part I II of NRR, 2009 ( www.rbi.org.in \u2192Publications\u2192Occassional) for exchanging \nmutilated and imperfect notes and issue receipt for the notes presented for adjudication, non- chest branches are required to follow  the following procedure for \nnotes presented in small numbers and in bulk.  6.2.2 Notes presented in small number:  Where the number of notes presented by \na person is up to 5 pieces, non- chest branches should normally adjudicate the notes \nas per the procedur e laid down in Part III of NRR, 2009 and pay the exchange value \nover the counter. If the non- chest branches are not able to adjudicate the mutilated \nnotes, the notes may be received against a receipt and sent to the linked currency \nchest branch for adjudic ation. The probable date of payment should be informed to \nthe tenderers on the receipt itself and the same should not exceed 30 days. Bank account details should be obtained from the tenderers for crediting the exchange \nvalue by electronic means.  \n6.2.3 Notes presented in bulk:  Where the number of notes presented by a person \nis more than 5 pieces not exceeding \u20b95, 000 in value, the tenderer should be advised \nto send such notes to nearby currency chest branch by insured post giving his / her \nbank account detai ls (a/c no, branch name, IFSC, etc.) or get them exchanged \nthereat in person. All other persons tendering mutilated notes whose value exceeds \u20b95,000 should be advised to approach nearby currency chest branch. Currency \nchest branches receiving mutilated not es through insured post should credit the \nexchange value to the account of sender by electronic means within 30 days of \nreceipt of notes.  \n6.3 Tenderers aggrieved with the service provided by the banks in this regard may \napproach Banking Ombudsman concerned, following the procedure as laid under \nBanking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006 with the bank/  postal receipts as proof for \nnecessary action.  \n7. Notes B earing \"PAY\" / \"PAID\" / \"REJECT\" S tamps \n(a) Every Officer- in-charge of the branch i.e. the Branch Manager and every Officer -\nin-charge of the Accounts or Cash Wing of the Branch shall act as 'Prescribed \nOfficer' in each branch to adjudicate the notes received at the branch for exchange in accordance with NRR, 2009. After adjudicating mutilated notes, the Pres cribed \nOfficer is required to record his order by subscribing his initials to the dated 'PAY'/ 'PAID'/ 'REJECT' stamp. The 'PAY' /'PAID' & 'REJECT' stamps should also carry the name of the bank and branch concerned and held under the custody of the \n'Prescr ibed Officer' to avoid misuse.  (b) Mutilated / defective notes bearing 'PAY'/'PAID' (or 'REJECT') stamp of any RBI \nIssue Office or any bank branch, if presented for payment again at any of the bank \nbranches should be rejected under Rule 6(2) of NRR, 2009 and the tenderer should be advised that the value of such note/s cannot be paid since the same has already been paid as is evident from the PAY/  PAID stamps affixed on it/  them. All bank \nbranches have instructions not to issue notes bearing PAY/  PAID stamps  to the \npublic even through oversight. The branches should caution their customers not to \naccept such notes from any bank or anybody else.  \n8. Notes with Slogans/ Scribbling/ Stain e tc. \n(a) Notes with slogans, political or religious messages, scribbling, st ain (including \ncolour stain) etc . are unfit for usage and circulation and go against Clean Note Policy \nof RBI.  \n(b) Such notes received from members of public may not be reissued for circulation. \nThey may be remitted to currency chest for onward remittance to RBI offices. \n(c) Any note with slogans and message of a political or religious nature written \nacross it ceases to be a legal tender and the claim on such a note will be rejected \nunder Rule 6(3) (iii) of NRR, 2009. Similarly, notes which are disfigured m ay also be \nrejected under Rule 6(3) (ii) of  NRR, 2009 . \n(d) All Bank notes with scribbling / stain (including colour stain) on them c ontinue to \nbe legal tender. Such notes can be deposited or exchanged in any bank branch.  \n9. Deliberately Cut Notes \nThe notes, which are found to be deliberately cut, torn, altered or tampered with, if \npresented for payment of exchange value should be rejected under Rule 6(3)  (ii) of \nthe NRR, 2009. Although it is not possible to precisely define deliberately cut notes, a close look at such notes will clearly reveal any deliberate fraudulent intention, as the manner in which such notes are mutilated will  follow a broad uniformity in the \nshape/  location of missing portions of the notes, especially when the notes are \ntendered in large numbers. The details of the case such as the name of the tenderer, the number of notes tendered and their denominations should be reported thereafter to the D GM/ GM, Issue Department,  Reserve Bank of India under whose jurisdiction the branch falls. The matter should also be reported to local police in case a large \nnumber of such notes are tendered.  \n10. Training \nRBI Issue Offices conduct training programmes for 'Prescribed Officers' of bank \nbranches on a priority basis. As the training programmes are intended to provide \nknowledge and instil confidence in the Prescribed Officers in the process of adjudication of defec tive notes, it is imperative that the Prescribed Officers of the \nbranches are deputed for such programmes.  \n11. Display of Notice Board \nAll bank branches are required to display at their branch premises, at a prominent \nplace, a board indicating the availabi lity of note and coin exchange facility with the \nlegend, \"SOILED/  MUTILATED NOTES AND COINS ARE ACCEPTED AND \nEXCHANGED HERE\" for information of general public. Banks should ensure that all their branches provide facility for exchange of notes and coins not  only to their \ncustomers but also others. However, they should ensure that the note exchange \nfacility is not cornered by money changers / dealers in defective notes.  \n12. Disposal o f Notes Adjudicated a t Bank Branches  \nRegarding audit of the notes adjudicated by bank branches, the full value paid notes \nhave to be remitted by all branches to the chest branches with which they have been linked and therefrom to the RBI Issue Offices concerned together with the next soiled \nnote remittance in the manner already laid down. The half value paid notes and rejected notes, which are held by the chest branches in their cash balance, may either be remitted separately packed together with the full value paid notes or sent by registered and insured post as and when required.  The full value paid notes will \nbe treated as chest remittance by the RBI Issue Office while the half value paid \nnotes and rejected notes will be treated as notes tendered for adjudication and processed accordingly. All chest branches are required to submi t to our  RBI Issue \nOffices a monthly statement showing the number of notes adjudicated during the \nmonth.  \n 13. Uncurrent Coins \nThe coins of 25 paise and below, issued from time to time, ceased to be legal tender \nfor payments as well as account with effect from June 30, 2011 in terms of Gazette \nNotification No. 2529 dated December 20, 2010 issued by the Government of India.  \n14. Monitoring and Control  \n(a) The Regional Managers / Zonal Managers of the banks may pay surprise visits to \nthe branches and report the position of compliance in this regard to the Head Office which will review such reports and take prompt remedial action, wherever necessary.  \n(b) Any non- compliance in this regard shall be viewed as violation of instructions \nissued by the Reserve Bank of India.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \nMaster Circular \u2013  Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated April 01, 2021 \nList of circulars / notifications consolidated by the Master Circular  \nSr.\nNo Circular / Notification No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

The framework had ensured that changing payment needs of \ncustomers were accommodated by adequately balancing safety, security and convenience of such transactions.

D uring the ext ended timeline, no new mandate for recurring online \ntransactions shall be registered by  stakeholders , unless such mandates are compliant with the \nframework . \n3.

Newly incorporated non -bank entities which may not \nhave an audited statement of financial accounts shall submit a certificate f rom their CA \nregarding the current net -worth along with provisional balance sheet.  \n \n   \n 3.

Para 5.4 related to disclosure of comprehensive information regarding merchant policies, customer grievanc es, privacy policy and other terms and conditions on the \nwebsite and / or their mobile application,  refers to policies of the PA and not of \nindividual merchants on- boarded by it.  \n 4. KYC and m erchant on -boarding related  \n4.1. In case a PA is maintaining an account -based relationship with the merchant, the KYC \nguidelines of Department of Regulation (DoR), RBI is applicable. Thus, to this extent, \npara 6 on \u2018Safeguards against Money Laundering (KYC / AML / CFT) Provisions\u2019 shall \nalso be applicable.  \n4.2. For merchant on -boarding, the PA can have a Board approved policy (Para 7.1). There \nwould not be a requirement to carry -out entire process of KYC (in accordance with the \nKYC guidelines of DoR), in cases where the merchant already has a bank account which is being used for transaction settlement purpose.   \n   \n5. OPGSP related  \n5.1. Entities functioning as OPGSP and undertaking cross -border transactions in terms of \nOPGSP guidelines shall ensure compliance with the instructions issued vide A.P.

(DIR Series) Circular \nNo.16 dated September 24, 2015 , are also adhered to.  \n \n6. Security, fraud prevention and risk management f ramework related  \n6.1. The PA needs to ensure compliance of the infrastructure of the merchants to security \nstandards like PCI -DSS and PA- DSS, as applicable.  \n6.2. Merchants are not allowed to store payment data irrespective of their being PCI -DSS \ncompliant or otherwise. They shall, how ever, be allowed to store limited data for the \npurpose of transaction tracking; for which, the required limited information may be \nstored in compliance with the applicable standards.  \n6.3. The PA cannot also store customer card credentials within its database or the server \n(irrespective of it being accessed by merchant or not) except for the limited purpose of transaction tracking; for which, required credentials may be stored in compliance with the applicable standards.  \n6.4. Para 10.5: A standard system audit , including cyber security audit , conducted by CERT-\nIn empanelled auditors may be carried out.  \n \n7. Settlement and escrow account related  \n7.1.

The applicability of \ncircular  DPSS.CO.PD.No.1102/02.14.08 /2009 -10 dated November \n24, 2009  on \u201cDirections for opening and operation of Accounts and settlement of \npayments for electronic payment transactions  involving intermediaries\u201d  shall be as \nfollows:  \n7.2.1.  The circular shall be considered repealed for authorised PAs from the date of \nauthorisation;   \n 7.2.2.  The circular shall be considered repealed with effect from June 30, 2021 except \nfor such PAs who have applied for authorisation and a decision on it is pending with \nRBI.  \n \n7.3. The existing entities can continue to maintain nodal accounts till they have been \nauthorised by RBI. Since the PA needs to move towards an escrow account, the bank and the PA may take a call about maintaining the same from an earlier date as well. However, this alone shall not make them eligible for a \u201cdesignated payment system\u201d status under Section 23A of the PSS Act.  \n7.4. If the bank can satisfactorily establish that the nodal account of an entity has been migrated to escrow account in compliance with the new instructions, it can allow the \nbalances under existing nodal accounts of PAs to be considered for calculation of \u2018Core \nportion\u2019.  \n7.5. Those entities who have not attained the requisite net -worth as of March 31, 2021 shall \nwind up their PA business. Banks shall be required to close such nodal accounts after \nJune 30, 2021 unless the PA produces evidence to the bank regarding application fo r \nauthorisation being made to RBI.  \n7.6. The pre- funding has been allowed to tide over temporary mis -matches. Taking back of \nsurplus pre- funding is not allowed.  \n7.7. There can be different \u201ct\u201d for different merchants as per the agreement between PA and merchants.  \n7.8. Para 8.6: The amount due to the merchant will be reckoned only after the settlement \nand credit to the escrow account. There is no need to prefund the account for this purpose.

In view of the ensuing closing of \ngovernment accounts for the financial year 2020- 21, receiving branches including those \nnot situated locally, should adopt special arrangements such as courier service etc., for passing on challans/scrolls etc., to the Nodal/Focal Point branches so that all payments \nand collections made on behalf of government towards the end of March are accounted \nfor in the same financial  year. These instructions regarding special messenger \narrangements may please be informed to all branches concerned.  \n \n3. As regards reporting of March 2021 transactions by Nodal/Focal Point branches in April 2021, the branches may be advised to follow the procedure as outlined in the Annex\n. To \nsum up, the nodal/Focal Point branches will be required to prepare separate set of scrolls, one pertaining to March 2021 residual transactions and another for April transactions \nduring the first  10 days of April 2021.

Kindly issue necessary instructions in the matter to your branches concerned \nimmediately.  \n Yours faithfully  \n \n(R. Kamalakannan)  \nChief General Manager  \n \nEncl: As above \n  3 \n \nANNEX  \n \nReporting of March 2021 transactions  \n \n1. Beginning from April 1, 2021, the Nodal/Focal Point branches will segregate on a daily \nbasis all scrolls/challans pertaining to March 2021 received from the receiving branches \nconcerned and prepare separate main scrolls for:  \n \n(a) scrolls for transactions of March 2021 or earlier period (i.e. e ffected during the \nprevious financial year 2020- 21) and  \n(b) scrolls pertaining to current transactions (i.e. those effected from April 1, 2021 \nonwards).  \n 2. The main scrolls for March 2021 transactions prepared from April 1 to April 10, 2021 \nare to be distinc tly marked as March Residual \u2013  1, March Residual \u2013  2 and so on upto \nApril 10, 2021. In other words, serial number should be allotted in consecutive order for each main scroll of March 2021 transactions sent from April 1 to April 10, 2021. These \nscrolls alo ng with the copies of daily summary of Receipts and Payments prepared \nseparately for March 2021 transactions will be forwarded to the Departmental Officials concerned (i.e. Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers and Designated \nOfficers) in the u sual way. The Nodal/Focal Point branches will also be required to report \nthe above transactions to the Link Cell through separate Daily Memos. These advices \nmust be sent to enable the Link Cell of each bank at Nagpur, to make daily settlement \nwith Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section (CAS) Nagpur. On receipt of \nadvices from the Nodal/Focal Point branches, the Link Cell should segregate the advices \nfor the March Residual transactions and forward them separately to Reserve Bank of India, CAS, Nagpur. This procedure should continue upto and inclusive of April 10, 2021 \nonly. All transactions reported thereafter by the receiving branches will be reported and \naccounted for in the usual manner in the accounts of the month of report irrespective of \nthe date of transaction. Following the special arrangements for March 2021 transactions, \nit is necessary for the Nodal/Focal Point branches to prepare two sets of DMS to be \nsubmitted to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers for March 2021 \ntransactions \u2013 one for transactions upto March 31, 2021 and another for March Residual 4 \n \ntransactions adjusted by Nodal/Focal Point branches with Reserve Bank of India, Central \nAccounts Section, Nagpur, during April 1 to April 10, 2021.  \n3. Since the Nodal/Focal Point branch will also be reporting the April 2021 transactions pertaining to year 2021- 22 in addition to March 2021 Residual transactions, monthly \nstatement for April 2021 transactions should be compiled and furnished to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers in the usual way. In order to distinguish the April 2021 \n(year 2021- 22) and March Residual Transactions, the statement pertaining to March \nResidual Transactions should be clearly marked as \"March Residual Account\". The \nstatement of March (Residual ) Transactions should be sent by all Focal Point Branches \nto Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers latest by April 18, 2021.  \nNote: As advised in our circular GA.NB.No.376/42.01.001/1995- 96 dated May 22, 1996 \nall the cheques/amounts realized on or before March 31, 2021 should be treated as \ntransactions relating to the current financial year as \"March 2021 or March Residual Transactions\", the reporting of which may take place during the month of April (upto April \n10, 2021). But if any cheque is t endered on or before March 31, 2021 and realised on or \nafter April 1, 2021, it will be treated as transaction for the next financial year as \"April \nTransactions\". Accordingly, the banks will prepare separate scrolls for March 2021 and \nApril 2021 (Financial  year 2021- 22) transactions.  \n \n*** \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/108RESIDUALA1966F0198FE40EC95F31C3DBB2B6D25.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Mar 15, 2021", "info": "                        \u092d\u0941\u0917\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0914\u0930 \u093f\u0928\u092a\u091f\u093e\u0928 \ufffd\u0923\u093e\u0932\u0940  \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , \u0915\ufffd \ufffd\u0940 \u092f  \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f , 14\u0935\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932 , \u0915\ufffd \ufffd\u0940 \u092f  \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f  \u092d\u0935\u0928,\u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926  \u092d\u0917\u0924 \ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0908  - 400001  \n\u092b\u094b\u0928 Tel: (91 -22) 2260 1000;  \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d  \u0938 Fax: (91 -22) 2265 9566;   \u0908 \u092e\u0947\u0932-e-mail :   cgmdpssco@rbi.org.in   \nDepartment of Payment and Settlement Systems, Central Office, 14th Floor, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Fort, Mumbai - \n400001  \n\ufffd\u0939\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928  \u0939\u0948, \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e  \ufffd\u092f\u094b\u0917  \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0907\u090f  \n   \n \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f  \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA  \nwww.rbi.org.in   \n \nRBI/2020 -21/107 \nDPSS.CO.RPPD.No. SUO  21102/04.07.005/2020- 21                         March 15 , 2021  \n \nThe Chairman and Managing Director / Chief Executive Officer   \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks including Regional Rural Banks /   \nUrban Co- operative Banks / State Co- operative Banks /   \nDistrict Central Co -operative Banks / Local Area Banks / Payment Banks  / \nSmall Finance B anks  / National Payments Corporation of India  \n \nMadam / Dear Sir,  \n \nExtension of C heque Truncation System (CTS) across all bank branches in the \ncountry  \n \nPlease refer to the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated \nFebruary 5, 2021  wherein Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had announced pan-India \ncoverage of CTS by bring ing all branches  of banks in the country under  image -based \nCTS clearing mechanism.  \n \n2.      The CTS is in use since 2010 and presently covers around 1, 50,000  branches. \nAll the erstwhile 1219 non- CTS clearing houses  (ECCS centres)  have been migrated \nto CTS  effective September 2020 . It is , however,  seen that there are branches of \nbank s that are outside any formal clearing arrangement  and their customers face \nhardships due to longer time taken and cost involved in collection of cheques \npresented by them .   \n3.

REs shall formulate a policy for digital payment products and services with the \napproval of their Board.  The contours of the polic y, while d iscussing the parameters \nof any \u201c new product \u201d including its alignment with the overall business strategy and \ninherent risk of the product, risk management/ mitigation measures , compliance \nwith regulatory instructions,  customer experience,  etc., should explicitly discuss \nabout payment security requirements from Functionality, Security and Performance  \n(FSP)  angles such as:  \na) Necessary controls to protect the confidentiality of  customer data and integrity \nof data and processes  associated with the digital product/ services offered;  \nb) Availability of requisite infrastructure e.g. human resources, technology, etc.  \nwith necessary back up;  \nc) Assurance that the p ayment product is built in a secure manner offering robust \nperformance ensuring safety , consistency  and rolled out after necessary testing \nfor achieving  desired FSP;   \nd) Capacity building and expansion with scalability  (to meet the growth for efficient \ntransaction processing) ;   \ne) Minimal customer service disruption with high availability  of systems/ channels  \n(to have minimal technical declines) ; \nf) Efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanism and handling  of customer \ngrievance; and \ng) Adequate and appropriate review mechanism followed by swift corrective \naction, in case any one of the above requirements is hampered or having high \npotential to get hampered.  \n \nThe Board and Senior Management shall be responsible for implementation of this \npolicy . The policy shall  be reviewed periodically, at least on a yearly basis. REs may \nformulate this policy separately for its different digital products or include the same as part of their overall product policy. F urther, the policy document should require \nthat every digital payment product/ services offered address es the mechanics, clear \ndefinition of starting point , critical intermittent stages/ points  and end point in the \ndigital payment cycle, security aspects,  validations till the digital payment is settled, \nclear pictorial representation of digital path and exception handling. In addition,  \nsigning off of the above requirements, mechanism  for carrying out U ser Acceptance \nTests (UAT) in multiple stages before roll out, sign off from multiple stakeholders \n(post UAT) and data archiv al requirements shall also be taken in to account . The \nneed for an external assessment of the entire process including the logic, build and 5 \n security aspects o f the application(s) supporting the digital product should be clearly \narticulated.   \n5. REs shall incorporate appropriate processes into their governance and risk \nmanagement programs for identifying, analysing, monitoring and managing the \nspecific risks, incl uding compliance risk  and fraud risk,  associated with the portfolio \nof digital payment  products and services  on a continual basis and in a holistic \nmanner. The Board/ Senior Management of REs  shall have appropriate \nperformance monitoring systems/ key performance indicators for assessing \nwhether the product or service offered through digital payment  channels meet \noperational and security norms . \n6. As part of this process, the REs shall  define product -level limits on the level of \nacceptable security risk, document specific security objectives and performance \ncriteria including quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the success of the security \nbuilt into the digital payment  product or service, periodically compare actual results \nwith projections and qualitative benchmarks to detect and address adverse trends or concerns in a timely manner  and modify the business plan/  strategy  involving the \nproduct, when appropriate,  based o n the security performance of the product or \nservice.  \n7. REs shall have trained resources  with necessary expertise to manage the digital \npayment  infrastructure. Wherever the REs are dependent on third party service \nproviders, adequate oversight and controls for monitoring the activities of the third \nparty personnel , in line with RBI guidelines  on outsourcing , shall be put in place.   \n8. REs s hall conduct risk assessments with regard to the safety and security of digital \npayment  products and associated processes and services as well as suitability and \nappropriateness of the same vis -a-vis the target users , both prior to establishing the \nservice(s) and regularly thereafter. The risk assessment should take into account \u2013 \na) The technology stack and solutions used;  \nb) Known vulnerabilities at each of the touchpoints of the digital product and the \nremedial action taken by the entity;  \nc) Dependence on third party service providers and oversight over such providers;  \nd) Risk arising out of integration of digital payment  platform with other systems  \nboth internal and external to the RE, including c ore system s and systems of \npayment systems operators , etc.;  \ne) The customer experience, convenience and technology adoption required to use such products;  \nf) Reconciliation process ; \ng) Interoperability aspects ; \nh) Data storage, security and privacy protection as per extant laws/ instructions ; 6 \n i) Operational risk including  fraud risk;  \nj) Business continuity  and service availability ; \nk) Compliance with extant cyber security requirements ; and  \nl) Compatibility  aspects . \n \nSuch assessment shall cover the surrounding ecosystem  as well . The assessment \nof risks sh all address the need to protect and secure payment data1 and evaluate \nthe resilience of systems . The internal Risk and Control Self -Assessment (RCSA) \nexercise shall cover the risks (inherent) & controls vis -\u00e0-vis the probability and \nimpact of threats to arrive at  residual risk.  In such an exercise, it is imperative for  \nREs to maintain database of all systems and applications storing customer data in \nthe payment ecosystem and compliance with applicable PCI standards in each of \nthe system s (notwithstanding mandatory requirement s of certification/ standard \naccreditation) .   \n9. REs shall evaluate the risks associated with the chosen technology platforms, \napplication architecture, both on the server and client side. Further, REs should \nundertake a review of the risk scenarios and existing security measures based on \nincidents affecting their services, before any  major c hange to the infrastructure or \nprocedures is made or, when, any new threats are identified through risk monitoring \nactivities.  Further, unused or unwanted features of the platform sho uld be closely \ncontrolled to minimi se risk . \n10. REs shall develop sound internal control systems  and take into account the \noperational risk  before offering digital payment  products and related services. This \nwould include ensur ing that adequate safeguards are in place to protect integrity of \ndata, customer confidentiality and security of data.   \n11. REs shall ensure that the digital payment  architecture is robust and scalable,  \ncommensurat e with the transaction volumes and customer growth. The IT strategy \nof the RE shall ensure that  a robust capacity management plan is in place to m eet \nevolving demand.  REs shall also put in place review mechanism of IT/  IT Security \narchitecture and technology platform overhaul  on a periodic basis based on Board-\napproved policy . \n12. REs shall have necessary capacity, systems and procedures in place to periodically \ntest the backed -up data, application pertaining to digital products to ensure recovery \n                                                           \n1 customer data; customer and beneficiary account details; payment credentials; transaction data;  7 \n without loss of transactions  or audit -trails . These facilities should be tested at least \non a half -yearly  basis for digital payment products and services.    \nOther Generic  Security Controls  \n13. The communication protocol in the digital payment  channels (especially over \nInternet) shall adhere to a secure standard .  An appropriate level of encryption and \nsecurity shall be implemented in the digital payment ecosystem . \n14. Web applications providing the digital payment  products and services should not \nstore sensitive information in HTML hidden fields, cookies, or any other client -side \nstorage to avoid any compromise in the integrity of the data.  \n15. REs shall implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution and DDoS mitigation \ntechniques to secure the digital payment  products and services offered over \nInternet .   \n16. The key length (for symmetric/  asymmetric encryption, hashing), algorithms (for \nencryption, signing, exchange of  keys, creation of message digest, random number \ngenerators), cipher suites , digital certificates  and applicable protocols used in \ntransmission channels, processing of data, authentication purpose, shall be strong, \nadopting internationally accepted and published standards that are not deprecated/  \ndemonstrated to be insecure/  vulnerable and the configurations involved in \nimplementing such controls are in general, compliant with extant instructions and \nthe law of the land.  \n17. REs shall renew their  digital certificates  used in digital payment ecosystem  well in \ntime. \n18.

REs shall implement multi- tier application architecture,  segregating application, \ndatabase and presentation layer in the digital payment  products  and services.  \n20. REs shall follow a \u2018secure by design\u2019 approach in the development of digital \npayment  products and services.  REs shall ensure that digital payment  applications \nare inherently more secure by embedding security within their development \nlifecycle.  \n                                                           \n2 Mobile banking, mobile payment applications of the regulated entities  8 \n 21. REs shall explicitly define security objectives (including protection of customer \ninformation/ data) during (a) requirements gathering , (b) designing , (c) \ndevelopment , (d) testing including source code review , (e) implementation, \nmaintenance & monitoring and (f) dec ommissioning phases of the digital payment  \napplications.  \n22. REs (including those partnering with other entities to co- brand/  co-develop \napplications) shall adopt and incorporate a threat modelling approach during \napplication lifecycle management into their policies, processes, guidelines and \nprocedures.  \n23. For digital payment applications that are licensed by a third party vendor, REs shall \nhave an escrow arrangement for the source code for ensuring continuity of services \nin case the vendor defaults or is unabl e to provide services.  \n24. REs shall conduct security testing including review of source code , Vulnerability \nAssessment (VA) and Penetration Testing (PT) of their digital payment  applications  \nto assure that the application is secure for putting through transactions while \npreserving confidentiality and integrity of the data that is stored and transmitted.  \nSuch testing should invariably  cover compliance with various standards like  \nOWASP.  If the source code is not owned by the RE, the n, in such cases, the RE \nshall obtain a certificate from the application developer stating that the application \nis free of known vulnerabilities, malware s and any covert channels in the code. In \nthis context, \na) The VA shall be conducted at least on a half -yearly basis ; PT shall be \nconducted at  least on a yearly basis . In addition, VA/PT shall be conducted as \nand when any new IT Infrastructure or digital payment application is introduced  \nor when any major change is performed in application or infrastructure;  \nb) Testing related to review of source code/ certification shall be conducted/ \nobtained. This shall continue on a yearly  basis , if changes/ upgrades have been \nmade to the application during the year ; \nc) Testing/  Certification should broadly address the objective that the product/  \nversion/module(s) functions only in a manner that it is intended to do, is \ndeveloped as per the best secure design/  coding practices and standards, \naddressing known flaws/threats due to insecure coding ; and \nd) Penal provisions shall be included by the RE into third- party contractual \narrangements for any non- compliance by the application provider.  \n \n25. REs may also run automated VA scanning tools to automatically scan all systems \non the network that are critical, public facing or store customer sensitive data on a \ncontinuous/ more frequent basis.  9 \n 26. REs shall compare the results from earlier vulnerability scans to verify / ascertain \nthat vulnerabilities are  addressed either by patching, implementing a compensating \ncontrol, or documenting and accepting the residual risk with necessary approval \nand t hat t here is no recurrence of the known vulnerabilities. The identified \nvulnerabilities should be fixed in a time-bound manner.  \n27. REs shall e nsure tha t all vulnerability scanning is performed in authenticated mode \neither with agents running locally on the system to analys e the security configuration \nor with remote scanners that are given administrative rights on the system being \ntested.3 \n28. REs shall verify and thoroughly test the functionality  (to validate whether the system \nmeets the functional  requirements/  specifications ) and security controls of payment \nproduct s and services  before its launch/  moving to the production environment.  \n29. REs shall institute a mechanism to actively monitor for the non- genuine/ \nunauthorised/ malicious  applications  (with similar name/  features) on popular  app-\nstores and the W eb and respond accordingly to bring them down.  \n30. The server at the RE \u2019s end should have adequate checks and balances to ensure \nthat no transaction is carried out through non-genuine/ unauthorised digital payment  \nproducts / applications  and the authentication process is robust, secure and \ncentralised.  \n31.  The security controls for digital payment  applications must focus on how these \napplications handle, store and protect payment data. The APIs for secure data \nstorage and communication have to be implemented and used correctly in order to \nbe effective. REs shall refer to standards such as OWASP -MASVS, OWASP -ASVS \nand other relevant OWASP standards, security and data protection guidelines in \nISO 12812, threat catalogues and guides developed by NIST (including for \nBluetooth and LTE security ), for application security and other protection measures. \nSuch testing has to necessarily verify for vulnerabilities including, but not limited to OWASP/  OWASP Mobile Top 10, application security guidelines/ requirements \ndeveloped/ shared by operating system pr oviders/ OEMs.  \n32. REs shall redact/ mask customer information such as account numbers/ card \nnumbers/ other sensitive information when transmitted via SMS / e-mails .   \n \n                                                           \n3 SANS Crit ical Security Controls  10 \n Authentication Framework  \n33. In view of the proliferation of cyber -attacks and their potential consequences , REs \nshould implement , except where explicitly permitted/ relaxed,  multi -factor \nauthentication for  payments through electronic modes and fund transfers , including \ncash withdrawals from ATMs/ micro- ATMs/ business correspondents,  through \ndigital payment  applications . At least one of the authentication methodolog ies \nshould be generally dynamic or non-replicable.  [e.g., Use of One Time Password, \nmobile devices (device binding  and SIM), biometric / PKI/ hardware tokens,  EMV \nchip card (for Card Present Transactions)  with server -side verification could be \ntermed  either in dynamic or non- replicable methodologies .]. \n34. REs may als o adopt adaptive authentication to select the right authentication factors \ndepending on risk assessment, user risk profile and behaviour.  Properly designed \nand implemented multi -factor authentication methods are more reliable and \nstronger fraud deterrents and are more difficult to compromise. The key  objectives \nof multi -factor authentication are to protect the confidentiality of payment data as \nwell as enhance confidence in digital payment  by combating various cyber -attack \nmechanisms like phishing, keylogging, spyware/ malware and other internet -based  \nfrauds targeted at REs and their customers . In this regard,  \na) The implementation of appropriate authentication methodologies should be \nbased on an assessment of the risk posed by the RE\u2019s digital payment  products \nand services . The risk should be evaluated in light of the type of customer ( e.g., \nretail / corporate/  commercial); the customer transactional requirements/  pattern \n(e.g., bill payment, fund transfer), the sensitivity of customer information and \nthe volume, value of transactions involved.  \n b) Beyond the technology factor, the success of a particular authentication method depends on appropriate policies, procedures, and controls.  An effective \nauthentication method should take into consideration customer acceptance, ease of use, reliable performance, scalability to accommodate growth, custome r profile, location, transaction, etc ., and interoperability with other \nsystems.  \n \nc) To enhance online processing security, multi factor authentication and alerts \n(like SMS, e -mail, etc.) should be applied in respect of all payment transactions  \n(including debits and credits) , creation of new account linkages (addition/ \nmodification/ deletion of beneficiaries), changing account details or revision to fund transfer limits. In devising these security features, REs should take into account their eff icacy and differing customer preferences for additional online \nprotection.  \n \nd) The alerts  and OTPs  received by the customer for online transactions shall \nidentify the merchant  name, wherever applicable, rather than the payment \naggregator  through which the transaction was effected.     11 \n  \ne) As an integral part of the multi  factor authentication architecture, REs should \nalso implement appropriate measures to minimise exposure to a middleman \nattack which is more commonly known as a man- in-the-middle attack (MITM), \nman- in-the browser (MITB) attack or man- in-the application attack.  This is to \nensure, among other things, that the data in transit is secured and the transactions are authenticated only by genuine/  authori sed source/  process.   \n \nf) An authenticated session, together with its encryption protocol, should remain \nintact throughout the interaction with the customer. Else, in the event of \ninterference or in case the customer closes the application, the session should \nbe terminated , and the af fected transactions resolved or reversed out. The \ncustomer should be promptly notified about the status of the transaction by \nemail, SMS  or through other means.  \n \n35. REs should set down the maximum number of failed log -in or authentication \nattempts after which access to the digital payment  product / service is  blocked. They \nshould have a secure procedure in place to re- activate the access to blocked \nproduct/  service . The customer shall be notified for failed log -in or authentication \nattempts . \nFraud Risk Management\n \n36. The REs shall document and implement the configuration aspects for identifying \nsuspicious transactional behaviour in respect of rules, preventive, detective types \nof controls, mechanism to alert  the customers in case of failed authent ication, time \nframe for the same,  etc.   \n37. System a lerts shall be parameteri sed and monitored in terms of various applicable \nparameters. Such parameters, as applicable could be: transaction velocity  (e.g.,  \nfund transfers, cash withdrawals, payments through electronic modes, adding new \nbeneficiaries, etc.)  in a short period, more so  in the accounts of customers who\u2019ve \nnever used mobile app/  internet banking / card  ever (depending upon the type of \npayment channel) , high risk merchant category codes (MCC) parameters, \ncounterfeit card parameters (String of Invalid CVV/  PINs indicates an account \ngeneration attack), n ew account parameters ( excessive activity on a new account ), \ntime zones, geo- locations, IP address origin (in respect of unusual patterns, \nprohibited zones/ rogue IPs), behavioural biometrics, transaction origination from point of compromise, transactions to mobile wallets / mobile numbers / VPAs on \nwhom vishing fraud or other types of fraud is/are registered/  recorded, declined \ntransactions, transactions with no approval code,  etc.  12 \n 38. Fraud analysis shall be conducted to identify the reason for fraud occurrence and \ndetermine mechanism  to prevent such frauds.  \n39. The staff, especially in the fraud control function,  shall be educated about frauds \nand trained in the following skills and areas of expertise:   \na) Fraud control tools and their usage;  \nb) Investigative techniques and procedures ; \nc) Cardholder and merchant education techniques to prevent fraud;  \nd) Scheme/  Card operating regulations ; \ne) Data processing and analysis and l iaising  or communicating wi th law \nenforcement agencies ; and  \nf) The requisite skills required to (i) set and update appropriate rules, (ii) monitor \nthe exceptions thrown based on the rules on a continuous  basis and take \nnecessary actions promptly , (iii) communicate/  escalate wherever required to \nappropriate authorities , and  (iv) differentiate false positives from the rest . \n \n40. REs shall m aintain updated contact details of service providers, intermediaries, \nexternal agencies and other stakeholders  (including other REs)  for coordination in \nincident response.  REs shall put in place a mechanism with the stakeholders to \nupdate and verify such contact details.  REs shall also formulate specific SOP s to \nhandle incidents related to payment ecosystem to mitigate the loss either to the \ncustomer or RE.   \nReconciliation Mechanism  \n41. A real time/  near-real time  (not later than 24 hours  from the time of receipt of \nsettlement file(s)) reconciliation  framework for all digital payment transactions \nbetween RE and all other stakeholders such as payment system operators, \nbusiness correspondents, card networks, payment system processors, payment \naggregators, payment gateways, third party technology service providers, other participants, etc., shall be put in place for better detection and prevention of \nsuspicious transactions. A mechanism shall be introduced to monitor the \nimplementation and effectivenes s of such framework.   \nCustomer Protection, Awareness and Grievance Redressal Mechanism  \n42. REs shall incorporate secure, safe and responsible usage guidelines and training \nmaterials for end users within the digital payment  applications. They shall also make \nit mandatory (i.e. not providing any option to circumvent/ avoid the material) for the \nconsumer to go through secure usage guidelines (even in the consumer\u2019s preferred \nlanguage) while obtaining and recording confirmation during the on- boarding 13 \n procedure in the first instance and first use  after each update of the digital payment  \napplication or after major updates to secure and safe usage guidelines.  \n43. REs shall mention/ incorporate a section on the digital payment  application clearly \nspecifying the process and procedure (with forms/ contact information, etc.) to lodge \nconsumer grievances. A mechanism to keep this information periodically updated \nshall also be put in place. The reporting facility on the application shall provide an \noption for registering a grievance.  Customer dispute handling, reporting and \nresolution procedures, including the expected tim elines for the RE's response \nshould be clearly defined.   \n44.  REs shall adhere to extant instructions4, updated from time to time , to put in place \nsystem/s for online dispute resolution for resolving disputes and grievances of \ncustomers pertaining to digital payments . \n45. REs shall educate c ustomers about the need to maintain the physical and logical \nsecurity of their d evices accessing digital payment  products and services including \nrecommending secure/  regular installation of operating system and application \nupdates, downloading applications only from authori sed sources , having anti -\nmalware/  anti-virus  applications on devices , etc. \n46. REs shall ensure that its customers are provided information about the risks , \nbenefits  and liabilities of using digital payment  products and its related services \nbefore they subscribe to them. Customers shall  also be informed clearly and \nprecisely on their rights, obligations and responsibilities on matters relating to digital payment s, and, any  problems that may arise from its service unavailability, \nprocessing errors and security breaches.  The terms and condi tions  including \ncustomer privacy and security policy  applying to digital payment  products and \nservices shall be readily available to customers within the product. All digital channels are to be offered on express willingness of customer s and shall not be \nbundled without their  knowledge.  \n47.  Whenever new operating features or functions, particularly those relating to \nsecurity, integrity and authentication, are introduced to online delivery channels,  \n                                                           \n4 RBI/2020- 21/21 DPSS.CO.PD No.116/02.12.004/2020- 21 circular dated August 6, 2020  on \u2018Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) \nSystem for Digital Payments\u2019  \n 14 \n clear and effective communication followed by sufficient instructions to properly \nutilise such new features should be provided to the customers.  \n48.  REs may continuously create public awareness on the types of threats and attacks  \nused against the consumers while using digital payment  products  and \nprecautionary measures to safeguard against the same. Customers shall be \ncautioned against c ommonly known threats  in recent times like phishing, vishing, \nreverse -phishing, remote access of mobile devices and educated to secure and \nsafeguard their account details, credentials, PIN, card details, devices , etc.  \n49. REs shall provide digital payment products and services , to a customer only at her/ \nhis option based on specific written or authenticated electronic requisition along with \na positive ac knowledgement  of the terms and conditions .   \n50. REs should provide a mechanism on their mobile and internet banking application \nfor their customers to , with necessary authentication,  identify/  mark a transaction \nas fraudulent for seamless and immediate notification to his RE. On such \nnotification by the customer, th e RE s may endeavour to build the capability for \nseamless/ instant reporting of fraudulent  transactions to the corresponding \nbenefici ary/ counterparty\u2019s RE ; vice-versa have mechanism to receive such \nfraudulent transactions  reported  from other REs . The objective of this mechanism  \nis to accelerate early detection and enable the banking / payment  system to trace \nthe transaction trail and mitigate the loss to the defrauded customer at the earliest \npossible time.   \n \n \n \n \n       15 \n  \nChapter III  \nINTERNET BANKING SECURITY CONTROLS  \nIn addition to the controls prescribed in Chapter II, the following instructions are \napplicable to REs offering/ intending to offer internet banking facility to their customers:  \n51. Internet banking websites are vulnerable to authentication related brute force \nattacks/ applicat ion layer Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Based on the RE\u2019s \nindividual risk/ vulnerability assessment on authentication- related attacks such as \nbrute force/ DoS attacks, REs shall implement additional levels of authentication to \ninternet banking website s uch as adaptive authentication, strong CAPTCHA \n(preferably with anti -bot features) with server -side validation, etc., in order to plug \nthis vulnerability and prevent its exploitation.  Appropriate measures shall be taken \nto prevent DNS cache poisoning attacks  and for secure handling of cookies . Virtual \nkeyboard option should be made available.  \n52. An online session shall be automatically terminated after a fixed period of inactivity.  \n53. Secure delivery of password for login purpose shall be ensured. The password \ngenerated and dispatched by the RE should be valid for a limited period from the date of its creation.  If the password is generated and dispatched by the RE, then , \nthe user shall be compulsorily required to change the password,  on the first login.    \n54. When the internet banking application is accessed through external websites ( eg: \nin case of payment of taxes,  e-commerce transactions , etc.), the procedure f or \nauthentication and the appearance/ look and feel  of the RE\u2019s internet banki ng site \nshould be made uniform as far as possible.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 \n Chapter IV  \nMOBILE PAYMENTS APPLICATION SECURITY CONTROLS   \nIn addition to the controls prescribed in Chapter II, the following instructions are \napplicable to the REs offering/ intending to offer mobile banking / mobile payments  \nfacility to their customers  through mobile application:  \n55. On detection of any anomalies or exceptions for which the mobile application was \nnot programmed, the customer shall  be directed to remove the current copy/ \ninstance of the application and proceed with installation of a new copy/ instance of \nthe application.  REs shall be able to verify the version of the mobile application \nbefore the transactions are enabled.   \n56. Specific Controls for mobile  applications include:  \na) Device policy enforcement (allowing app install ation / execution after baseline \nrequirements are met);  \nb) Application secure download/ install;  \nc) Deactivating older application versions in a phased but time bound manner (not \nexceeding six months from the date of release of newer version) i.e., \nmaintaining only one version (excluding the overlap period while phasing out \nolder version) of the mobile application on a platform/ operating system;  \nd) Storage of customer data;  \ne) Device or application encryption;  \nf) Ensuring minimal data collection/ app permissions;  \ng) Application sandbox/  containerisation;   \nh) Ability to identify remote access applications (to the extent possible) and prohibit login access to the mobile application, as a matter of precaution; and   \ni) Code obfuscation.  \n \n57. REs may consider to perform validation on the security and compatibility condition \nof the device/ operating system and the mobile application  to ensure that activities \nrelating to the account  are put through the mobile application in a safe and secure \nmanner.   \n58. REs may explore the feasibility of implementing a code that checks if the device is \nrooted/ jailbroken prior to the installation of the mobile application and disallow the \nmobile application to install/  function if the phone is rooted/ jailbroken.  \n59. Checksum of current  active  version of application  shall be hosted on public platform \nso that users can verify the same.  \n 17 \n 60. REs shall ensure device binding of mobile application5.  \n61. Considering  that the additional factor of authentication and mobile application may \nreside on the same mobile device in the case of mobile banking,  mobile payments,  \nREs may consider  implement ing alternatives to SMS -based OTP authentication \nmechanisms .   \n62. The mobile application should require re- authentication whenever the device or \napplication remains unused for a designated period and each time the user \nlaunches the application. Applications must be able to identify new network \nconnections or connections from unsecured networks like unsecured Wi -Fi \nconnections  and must implement appropriate authentication / checks / measures  to \nperform transactions under those circumstances.  \n63. The mobile application should not store/ retain  sensitive personal/ consumer \nauthentication inf ormation such as user IDs, passwords, keys, hashes, hard coded \nreferences on the device and the application should securely wipe any sensitive \ncustomer information from memory when the customer/ user exits the application.  \n64. REs shall ensure that their mobile application limi t the writing of sensitive \ninformation into \u2018temp\u2019 files. The sensitive information written in such files must be \nsuitably encrypted/ masked/ hashed and stored securely.  \n65. REs may consider  designing anti -malware capabilities into their mobile \napplications.  \n66. REs shall ensure that the usage of raw (visible) SQL queries in mobile applications \nto fetch or update data from databases is avoided. Mobile applications should be \nsecured from SQL injec tion type of vulnerabilities.  Sensitive information should  be \nwritten to the database in an encrypted form.  Web content, as part of the mobile \napplication\u2019s layout,  should not be loaded if errors are detected during SSL/  TLS \nnegotiation. Certificate errors on account of the certificate not being signed by a \nrecognised certificate authority ; expiry/  revocation of the certificate must be \ndisplayed to the user .  \n                                                           \n5  The device binding should be preferably implemented through a combination of hardware, software and service information.  \nIn case, the RE allows multiple devices to be registered, then, (a) the user must be notified of every new device registration on \nmultiple channels such as registered mobile number, email or phone call and (b) in relation to the mobile application, RE must \nmaintain a record of all registered devices, providing the user a facility to disable a registered device.  18 \n Chapter V  \nCARD PAYMENTS SECURITY  \nIn addition to the controls prescribed in Chapter II, the following instructions are \napplicable to the REs offering/ intending to issue cards (credit/  debit / prepaid)  (physical \nor virtual) to their customers:   \n67. REs shall follow various p ayment card standards (over and above PCI -DSS and \nPA-DSS6) as per Payment Card Industry ( PCI) prescriptions  for comprehensive \npayment card security as per applicability/  readiness of updated versions of the \nstandards such as \u2013  \na) PCI-PIN (secure management, processing, and transmission of personal \nidentification number (PIN) data) ; \nb) PCI-PTS (security approval framework addresses the logical and/  or physical \nprotection of cardholder and other sensitive data at point of interaction (POI) \ndevices and hardware security modules (HSMs);  \nc) PCI-HSM  (securing cardholder -authentication applications and processes \nincluding key generation, key injection, PIN verification, secure encryption algorithm , etc.); and \nd) PCI-P2PE (security standard that requires payment card information to be \nencrypted instantly upon its initial swipe and then securely transferred directly \nto the payment processor) . \n68. REs should ensure that terminals installed at the merchants for capturing card \ndetails for payments or otherwise are validated against the PCI -P2PE program to \nuse PCI -approved P2PE solutions; P oS terminals with PIN entry installed at the \nmerchants for capturing card payments (including the double swipe terminals) are  \napproved by the PCI -PTS program.  \n69. Acquirer s shall secure their card payment infrastructure (Unique Key P er Terminal \n\u2013 UKPT or Derived Unique Key P er Transaction \u2013 DUKPT/ Terminal Line \nEncryption \u2013 TLE).    \n70. The security controls to be implemented at HSM are:  \na) The HSMs should have logging enabled, the logs must themselves be tamper \nproof ;  \nb) HSM can become a single point of failure. This needs to be mitigated by \u2018clustering \u2019 for high availability and ensure secure backups ;  \nc) Access to the HSM should be controlled through Access Control Lists  (ACLs);   \nd) Separate ACLs should be maintained for each individual application to ensure \napplication level isolation;   \ne) All access to HSM should be managed and monitored using a robust Privileged Identity and Access Management solution;  \nf) Decryption and validation of keys, PIN should be done at HSM ; \n                                                           \n6 PCI Secure Software Standard, a PCI standard within PCI Software Security Framework (SSF) will replace PA -DSS as the \nprimary standard for securing payment software in 2022. (ref: PCI security standards website)  19 \n g) Card PIN generation and printing should be directly at system connected HSM ; \nh) CVV generation and validation should be done at HSM ;  \ni) Ensure HSM is implemented with secure PIN block format  with controls to \ndisable outputting PIN block in weaker format ; \nj) Secure key management for HSMs (such as LMKs , etc.); and \nk) Security of the physical keys of the HSM device should be properly maintained . \n \n71. REs shall implement the following for improving the security posture of the ATM:  \na) Implement security measures such as BIOS password, disabling USB ports, \ndisabling auto- run facility, applying the latest patches of operating system and \nother softwares, terminal security solution, time- based admin access, etc ;   \nb) Implement anti -skimming an d whitelisting solution; and  \nc) Upgrade all the ATMs with supported versions of operating system. Use of ATMs that have unsupported operating systems shall be prohibited.  \n \n72. REs shall ensure robust surveillance/ monitoring of card transactions (especially \noverseas cash withdrawals) and setting up of rules and limits commensurate with \ntheir risk appetites. REs shall take up with the card network  and/ or ATM network \nas the case may be,  to put in place transaction limits at Card, BIN as well as at the \nRE level. Such limits shall be mandatorily set at the card network switch itself. Limits \ncould be mandated both for domestic as well as international transactions \nseparately. REs shall put in place transaction control mechanisms with necessary caps (restrictions o n transactions), if any of the limits set as per the above \nrequirement is breached. A periodic review mechanism of such limits set as per the risk appetite of the RE shall be put in place as per the Board- approved policy. REs \nshall institute a mechanism to monitor breaches, if any, on a 24x7 basis, including \nweekends, long holidays and put in place a robust incident response mechanism to \nmitigate the fraud loss, on account of suspicious transactions, if any. REs shall \nensure that card details of the customers are not stored in plain text at the RE and \nits vendor(s) locations, systems and applications.

HFCs are permitted to apply  zero percent risk weights in respect of exposures \nguaranteed under any existing or future schemes launched by Credit \nGuarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE), Credit Risk \nGuarantee Fund Trust  for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH) and indi vidual \nschemes under National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC) \nprovided they satisfy the following conditions : \na. Prudential Aspects : The guarantees provided under the respective \nschemes should comply with the requirements for credit risk mitigati on, in \nterms of paragraph 7.5 of the \u2018Master Circular on Basel III Capital \nRegulations\u2019 dated April 01, 2022 , as amended from time to time, which, \ninter alia , requires s uch guarantees to be direct, explicit, irrevocable and \nunconditional;  \nb. Restrictions on permissible claims: Where the terms of the guarantee \nschemes restrict the maximum permissible claims through features like \nspecified extent of guarantee coverage, clause on first loss absorption by \nmember lending institutions (MLI), payout cap, etc., the zero percent risk \nweight shall be restricted to the maximum permissible claim and the \nresidual exposure shall be subjected to risk weight as applicable to the \ncounterparty  in terms of extant regulations.  \nc. In case of a portfolio -level guarantee, effective from April 01, 2023, the \nextent of exposure subjected to first loss absorption by the MLI, if any, \nshall be subjected to full capital deduction and the residual exposure sha ll \nbe subjected to risk weight as applicable to the counterparty in terms of \nextant regulations, on a pro rata basis. The maximum capital charge shall \nbe capped at a notional level arrived at by treating the entire exposure as \nunguaranteed.  \n6.2.6.2. Furthe r, subject to the aforementioned prescriptions at Paragraph  6.2.6.1, any \nfuture scheme launched under any of the aforementioned Trust Funds, in order \nto be eligible for zero percent risk weight, shall provide for settlement of the \n                                                            \n  \n-26- \n eligible guaranteed claim s within thirty days from the date of lodgement, and \nthe lodgement shall be permitted within sixty days from the date of default.  \n6.2.6.3. The above regulatory stipulation shall be applicable to HFCs, to the extent they \nare recognised as eligible MLIs unde r the respective schemes.  \n6.2.6.4. Some illustrative examples of risk weights applicable on claims guaranteed \nunder specific existing schemes are given as illustration I in section V . \n \n6.2.7.  Strengthening credit standards  \n6.2.7.1.  The HFCs shall review their extant sect oral exposure limits for consumer \ncredit and put in place, if not already there, Board approved limits in respect \nof various subsegments under consumer credit as may be considered \nnecessary by the Boards as part of prudent risk management. In particular, \nlimits shall be prescribed for all unsecured consumer credit exposures. The \nlimits so fixed shall be strictly adhered to and monitored on an ongoing basis \nby the Risk Management Committee. All HFCs shall endeavour to comply \nwith the provisions of this parag raph at the earliest, but in any case shall \nimplement them by no later than February 29, 2024.  \n6.2.7.2.  All top -up loans extended by HFCs against movable assets which are \ninherently depreciating in nature, such as vehicles, shall be treated as \nunsecured loans for c redit appraisal, prudential limits and exposure \npurposes.  \n6.3.  Off-Balance Sheet items :   \nGeneral  \n6.3.1.  HFCs shall calculate the total risk weighted off -balance sheet credit exposure \nas the sum of the risk -weighted amount of the market related and non -market \nrelate d off-balance sheet items. The risk -weighted amount of an off -balance \nsheet item that gives rise to credit exposure shall be calculated by means of a \ntwo-step process:  \nStep 1: the notional amount of the transaction is converted into a credit \nequivalent am ount, by multiplying the amount by the specified credit \nconversion factor or by applying the current exposure method; and   \n-27- \n Step 2: the resulting credit equivalent amount is multiplied by the risk weight \napplicable, viz. zero per  cent for exposure to Centra l Government/State \nGovernments, 20 per  cent for exposure to banks and 100 per  cent for others.  \nNon-market -related off - balance sheet items:  \n6.3.2.  The credit equivalent amount in relation to a non -market related off -balance \nsheet item shall be determined by mult iplying the contracted amount of that \nparticular transaction by the relevant credit conversion factor (CCF).  \nItem \nNo. Item Description  CCF \ni.

Where the non -market related off -balance sheet item is an undrawn or \npartially undrawn fund -based facility, the amount of undrawn commitment  \nto be included in calculating the off -balance sheet non -market related credit \nexposures is the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be \ndrawn during the remaining period to maturity. Any drawn portion of a \ncommitment forms a part of HFC\u2019s on -balance sheet credit exposure.  \nFor example:  \nA term loan of \u20b9100 crore is sanctioned for a large housing project which \ncan be drawn down in stages over a three year period. The terms of sanction \nallow draw down in three stages \u2013 \u20b925 crore in Stage I, \u20b925  crore in Stage \nII and \u20b950 crore in Stage III, where the borrower needs the HFC\u2019s explicit \napproval for draw down under Stages II and III after completion of certain \nformalities. If the borrower has drawn already \u20b910 crore under Stage I, then \nthe undrawn p ortion would be computed with reference to Stage I alone i.e., \nit will be \u20b915 crore. If Stage I is scheduled to be completed within one year,  \n-29- \n the CCF will be 20 per cent and if it is more than one year then the applicable \nCCF will be 50 per cent.  \nMarket R elated Off -Balance Sheet Items:  \n6.3.3.  HFCs shall take into account all market related off -balance sheet items (OTC \nderivatives and Securities Financing Transactions such as repo/ reverse repo/ \nCBLO etc.) while calculating the risk weighted off -balance sheet cred it \nexposures. The credit risk on market related off -balance sheet items is the \ncost to an HFC of replacing the cash flow specified by the contract in the event \nof counterparty default. This shall depend, among other things, upon the \nmaturity of the contrac t and on volatility of rates underlying the type of \ninstrument.  \n \n6.3.4.  Market related off -balance sheet items would include:  \na. Interest rate contracts \u2013 including single currency interest rate swaps, basis \nswaps, forward rate agreements, and interest rate future s;  \nb. Foreign  exchange contracts, including contracts involving gold - includes \ncross currency swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps), \nforward foreign exchange contracts, currency futures, currency options;  \nc. Credit Default Swaps; and  \nd. Any other  market related contracts specifically allowed by the Bank  which  \ngive rise to credit risk.  \n6.3.5.  Exemption from capital requirements is permitted for:  \na. Deleted10 and; \nb. Instruments traded on futures and options exchanges which are subject to \ndaily mark -to-market a nd margin payments.  \n6.3.6.  The exposures to Central Counter Parties (CCPs), on account of derivatives \ntrading and securities financing transactions (e.g. Collateralised Borrowing \nand Lending Obligations \u2013 CBLOs, Repos) outstanding against them shall be \nassigned zero exposure value for counterparty credit risk, as it is presumed \n                                                            \n10 Vide circular DOR.MRG.REC.64/00 -00-005/2022 -23 dated August 11, 2022 .  \n-30- \n that the CCPs\u2019 exposures to their counterparties are fully collateralized on a \ndaily basis, thereby providing protection for the CCP\u2019s credit risk exposures.  \n6.3.7.  A CCF of 100 per cent shall be applied to the corporate securities posted as \ncollaterals with CCPs and the resultant off -balance sheet exposure shall be \nassigned risk weights appropriate to the nature of the CCPs. In the case of \nClearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), the risk w eight shall be 20 per \ncent and for other CCPs, the risk weight will be 50 per  cent.  \nCurrent Exposure Method  (used for measuring capital charge  for default risk)  \n6.3.8.  The total credit exposure to a counterparty in respect of derivative transactions \nshould be ca lculated according to the current exposure method as explained \nbelow.  \nThe credit equivalent amount of a market related off -balance sheet transaction \ncalculated using the current exposure method is the sum of:  \na. current  exposure; and  \nb. potential future  exposu re of the contract.  \n6.3.9.  Current  exposure is defined as the sum of the gross positive mark -to-market \nvalue of all contracts with respect to a single counterparty (positive and \nnegative marked -to-market  values of various contracts  with the same \ncounterparty shall not be netted). The current exposure method requires \nperiodical calculation of the current  exposure by marking these contracts to \nmarket.  \nNote: In case of bilateral netting arrangement,  refer to the definition as \nspecified in Paragraph 6.3.10B.  \n6.3.10.  Potentia l future  exposure is determined by multiplying the notional principal \namount of each of these contracts, irrespective of whether the contract has a \nzero, positive or negative mark -to-market  value by the relevant add -on factor \nindicated below according to t he nature and residual maturity of the \ninstrument.  \nCredit Conversion Factors for interest rate related, exchange rate \nrelated and gold related derivatives  \n Credit Conversion Factors (%)  \n Interest Rate \nContracts  Exchange Rate \nContracts & Gold   \n-31- \n One year or  less 0.50 2.00 \nOver one year to five years  1.00 10.00  \nOver five years  3.00 15.00  \n Notes:  \na. For contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the add -on factors are to be \nmultiplied by the number of remaining payments in the contract.  \nb. For contracts tha t are structured to settle outstanding exposure following \nspecified payment dates and where the terms are reset such that the market \nvalue of the contract is zero on these specified dates, the residual maturity would \nbe set equal to the time until the next  reset date. However, in the case of interest \nrate contracts which have residual maturities of more than one year and meet \nthe above criteria, the CCF or add -on factor is subject to a floor of 1.0 per cent.  \nc. No potential future  exposure would be calculated  for single currency floating/ \nfloating interest rate swaps; the credit exposure on these contracts would be \nevaluated solely on the basis of their mark -to-market  value.  \nd. Potential future exposures should be based on \u2018effective\u2019 rather than \u2018apparent \nnotio nal amounts\u2019. In the event that the \u2018stated notional amount\u2019 is leveraged or \nenhanced by the structure of the transaction, the \u2018effective notional amount\u2019 \nmust be used for determining potential future exposure. For example, a stated \nnotional amount of USD 1 million with payments based on an internal rate of \ntwo times the lending rate of the HFC would have an effective notional amount \nof USD 2 million.  \n6.3.10A.  When effective bilateral netting contract as specified in  paragraph 6.3.10C  is \nin place, current exposure i.e. replacement cost  will be  the net replacement \ncost; and the potential future exposure i.e. add-on will be A Net as calculated \nbelow:  \na. Credit exposure on bilaterally netted forward  transactions will be calculated \nas the sum of the net  mark -to-market repla cement cost, if positive, plus an  \nadd-on based on the notional underlying principal.   \n-32- \n The add -on for netted transactions (A Net) will equal the weighted average of \nthe gross add -on (A Gross) and the gross add -on adjusted by the ratio of net \ncurrent replacemen t cost to gross current replacement cost (NGR). This is \nexpressed through the following formula:  \nANet = 0.4 * AGross + 0.6 * NGR * AGross \nwhere:  \nNGR = level of net replacement cost/level of gross replacement cost for \ntransactions subject to legally enforce able netting agreements5A \nAGross = sum of individual add -on amounts (calculated by multiplying the \nnotional principal amount by the appropriate add -on factors set out \nin the table in paragraph 6.3.10 and paragraph 6.3.11 of all \ntransactions subject to lega lly enforceable netting agreements with \none counterparty.  \nb. For the purposes of calculating potential future exposure to a netting \ncounterparty for forward foreign  exchange contracts and other similar \ncontracts in which the notional principal amount is equiv alent to cash flows, \nthe notional principal is defined as the net receipts falling due on each value \ndate in each currency. The reason for this is that offsetting contracts in the \nsame currency maturing on the same date will have lower potential future \nexposure as well as lower current exposure.  \n6.3.10B.  Definitions and general terminology  \na. Current Exposure  is the larger of zero, or the market value of a transaction \nor portfolio of transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would \nbe lost upon the defa ult of the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the \nvalue of those transactions in bankruptcy. Current exposure is often also \ncalled Replacement Cost (RC).  \nb. Netting Set  is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are \nsubject to a legally enf orceable  bilateral netting arrangement and for which \nnetting is recognised for regulatory capital purposes. Each transaction that \n                                                            \n5A HFCs must calculate NGR on a counterparty by counterparty basis for all transactions that are subjec t to legally \nenforceable netting agreements.   \n-33- \n is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement that is \nrecognised for regulatory capital purposes shoul d be interpreted as its own \nnetting set for the purpose of these rules.  \n6.3.10C.  Requirement for recognition of Bilateral Netting Contract:  \na. HFCs  may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligation \nbetween such HFC and its counterparty to deliver a g iven currency on a \ngiven value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for \nthe same currency and value date, legally substituting one single amount \nfor the previous gross obligations.  \nb. HFCs  may also net transactions subject to any legal ly valid form of bilateral \nnetting not covered in (a), including other forms of novation.  \nc. In both cases (a) and (b), a n HFC will need to satisfy that it has:  \n(i)  A netting contract or agreement with the  counterparty which creates a \nsingle legal obligation, c overing all included transactions, such that the \nHFC would have either a claim to receive or obligation to pay only the \nnet sum of the positive and negative mark -to-market values of included  \nindividual transactions in the event a counterparty fails to perf orm due \nto any of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar \ncircumstances;  \n(ii)  Written and reasoned legal opinions that, in the event of a legal \nchallenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find \nsuch HFC\u2019s exposure to be such a net amount under:  \n\uf0b7 The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, \nif the foreign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the \nlaw of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;  \n\uf0b7 The law that governs the in dividual transactions; and  \n\uf0b7 The law that governs any contract or agreement  necessary to effect \nthe netting.  \n(iii) Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting \narrangements are kept under review in the light of possible changes in \nrelev ant law.   \n-34- \n d. Contracts containing walkaway clauses will not be eligible for netting for the \npurpose of calculating capital requirements under these guidelines. A \nwalkaway clause is a provision which permits a non -defaulting counterparty \nto make only limited pa yments or no payment at all, to the estate of a \ndefaulter, even if the defaulter is a net creditor.  \nCredit conversion factors for Credit Default Swaps (CDS)  \n6.3.11.  A CDS creates a notional short position for specific risk in the reference asset/ \nobligation for t he protection buyer. This position will attract a Credit Conversion \nFactor of 100 and a risk weight of 100. The add on factor shall be fixed as 10 \nper cent (of notional principal of CDS) in relation to potential future exposure.  \n   \n-35- \n Chapter V  \nAsset Classific ation and Provisioning  \n7. Accounting Standards  \nHFCs that are required to  implemen t Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as per the \nCompanies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015  shall prepare their financial \nstatements in accordance with Ind AS notified by the Government of India and shall \ncomply with the regulatory guidance specified in terms of  Paragraph 3.1.7  of these  \ndirections . Other HFCs shall comply with the requirements of notified Accounting \nStandards (AS) insofar as they are not inconsistent wit h any of these directions.   \n8. Asset Classification  \nThe asset classification  norms as given below shall apply to every HFC : \n8.1. Every HFC shall, after taking into account the degree of well -defined credit \nweaknesses and extent of dependence on collateral security  for realisation, \nclassify its lease/  hire purchase assets, loans and advances and any other forms \nof credi t into the following classes, namely:  \na. Standard assets  \nb. Sub-standard assets  \nc. Doubtful assets and  \nd. Loss assets.   \n8.2. The class of assets referred to above sh all not be upgraded merely as a result of \nrescheduling, unless it satisfies the conditions required for the upgradation.  \n8.3. Classes of Assets  \n8.3.1.  \u201cStandard asset \u201d shall mean the asset in respect of which, no default in \nrepayment of principal or payment of intere st is perceived and which does not \ndisclose any problem or carry more than normal  risk attached to the business.  \n8.3.2.  \u201cSub-standard asset \u201d shall mean:  \na. an asset which has been classified as non -performing asset for a period not \nexceeding 1 2 months;  \nb. an asset, w here the terms of the agreement regarding interest and/  or \nprincipal have been re -negotiated or rescheduled after release of any  \n-36- \n instalment of loan or an inter -corporate  deposit which has been rolled over, \nuntil the expiry of one year of satisfactory perfo rmance under the re -\nnegotiated or rescheduled terms.  \nProvided  that where a delay in completion of a project is caused on account \nof factors beyond the control of the project implementing agency, terms of \nthe loan agreement regarding interest and/or princip al may be rescheduled \nonce before the completion of the project and such loans may be treated as \nstandard asset, subject to the condition that such reschedulement shall be \npermitted only once by the Board of Directors of the concerned housing \nfinance compa ny and that interest on such loan is paid re gularly and there \nis no default.  \nProvided  further that where natural calamities impair the repaying capacity \nof a borrower, terms of the loan agreement regarding interest and/or \nprincipal may be rescheduled and s uch loans shall not be classified as sub -\nstandard; the classification of such loans would thereafter be governed by \nthe revised terms and conditions.  \nExplanation:  Extension in repayment tenor of a floating rate loan on reset of \ninterest rate, so as to keep the EMI unchanged provided it is applied to a \nclass of accounts uniformly, will not render the account to be  classified as \nre-negotiated or rescheduled account. In other words, extension or \ndeferment of EMIs to individual borrowers as against to an entire class, \nwould render the accounts to be classified as re -negotiated or rescheduled \naccounts.  \n8.3.3.  \u201cDoubtful asset \u201d shall mean : \na. a term loan, or  \nb. a lease asset, or  \nc. a hire purchase asset, or  \nd. any other asset,  \nwhich remains a sub -standard asset fo r a period exceeding 12 months.  \n \n  \n-37- \n 8.3.4.  \u201cLoss asset \u201d shall mean:  \na.  an asset which has been identified as loss asset by the HFC or its internal \nor external auditor or by the Bank or by the  NHB  during the inspection of the \nHFC, to the extent it is not written off by the HFC; and  \nb. an asset which  is adversely affected by a potential threat of non -\nrecoverability due to an y one of the followi ng, namely:  \ni. non-availability  of security, either primary or collateral, in case of secured \nloans and advances;  \nii. erosion in value of security, either primary or collateral, is established;  \niii. insurance claim, if any, has been denied or settled in part;  \niv. fraudule nt act or omission on the part of the borrower;  \nv. the debt becoming time barred under Limitation Act, 1963 (Act 36 of \n1963);  \nvi. inchoate or defective  documentation.  \nExplanation:  For the removal of doubt, it is clarified that mere right of the \nhousing finance co mpany to file suit against the borrower/  guarantor for \nrecovery of dues does not debar the Bank, NHB  or the auditors to consider \nthe asset or part thereof as loss asset due to aforesaid reasons.  \n8.3.5.  \u201cNon-Performing Asset \u201d (referred to in these directions as \u201cN PA\u201d) shall mean:  \na. an asset, in respect of which, interest has remained overdue for  a period of \nmore than ninety days.  \nb. a term loan  (other than the one granted to an agriculturist or to a person \nwhose income is dependent on the harvest of crops)  inclusive of unpaid \ninterest, when the instalment is overdue for a period of more than ninety \ndays  or more or on which interest amount remained overdue for a period of \nmore than ninety days . \nc. a demand or call loan, which remained overdue for a period of more than \nninety  days  from the date of demand or call or on which interest amount \nremained overdue for a period of more than ninety days . \nd. a bill which remains overdue for a period of more than ninety days .  \n-38- \n e. the interest in respect of a debt or the income on receivables und er the head \n'other current assets' in  the nature of short term loans / advances, which \nfacility remained overdue for a period of more than ninety days.  \nf. any dues on account of sale of assets or services rendered or \nreimbursement of expenses incurred, which r emained overdue for a period \nof more than ninety days . \ng. the lease rental and hire purchase instalment, which has become overdue \nfor a period of more than ninety days . \nh. an inter corporate deposit, in respect of which interest or principal has \nremained overdue  for a period of more than ninety days.  \ni. a term loan granted to an agriculturist or to a person whose income is \ndependent on the harvest of crops if the installment of principal or interest \nthereon remains unpaid:  \ni. for two crop seasons beyond the due date i f the income of the borrower \nis dependent  on short duration crops, or  \nii. for one crop season beyond the due date if the income of the borrower is \ndependent on long duration crop.  \nExplanation:  \ni. For the purpose of this sub -clause \u201clong duration\u201d crops would be  crops \nwith crop season longer than one year and crops, which are not \u201clong \nduration\u201d crops, would be treated as \u201cshort duration\u201d crops.  \nii. The crop season for each crop means the period up to harvesting of the \ncrops raised, would be as determined by the Sta te Level Bankers\u2019 \nCommittee in each State.  \nj. in respect of loans, advances and other credit facilities (including bills \npurchased and discounted), the balance outstanding under the credit \nfacilities (including accrued interest) made  available to the same bor rower / \nbeneficiary when any of the above credit faciliti es becomes non -performing \nasset.   \nProvided  that in the case of lease and hire purchase transactions, an HFC \nshall classify each such account on the basis of its record of recovery.   \n-39- \n 8A. Clarifications  on A sset Classification, etc.11 \n8A.1.  An amount is to be treated as overdue if it is not paid on the due date fixed by the \nHFC. The exact due dates for repayment of a loan, frequency of repayment, \nbreakup between principal and interest, examples of SMA/ NPA classific ation \ndates, etc. shall be clearly specified in the loan agreement and the borrower shall \nbe apprised of the same at the time of loan sanction and also at the time of \nsubsequent changes, if any, to the sanction terms/ loan agreement till full \nrepayment of the loan. In cases of loan facilities with moratorium on payment of \nprincipal and/ or interest, the exact date of commencement of repayment shall also \nbe specified in the loan agreements. In case of existing loans, compliance to these \ninstructions shall ne cessarily be ensured as and when such loans become due for \nrenewal/ review.  \n8A.2.  Every HFC shall recognise incipient stress in loan accounts, immediately on \ndefault12, by classifying such assets as special mention accounts (SMA) as per the \nfollowing categories:  \nSMA Sub -categories  Basis for classification \u2013 Principal or interest payment \nor any other amount wholly or partly overdue  \nSMA -0 Upto 30 days  \nSMA -1 More than 30 days and upto 60 days  \nSMA -2 More than 60 days and upto 90 days  \n \n8A.3.  The above instructions on SMA  classification of borrower accounts are applicable \nto all loans13, including retail loans, irrespective of size of exposure of the lending \ninstitution.  \n8A.4.  The borrower accounts shall be flagged as overdue by the lending institutions as \npart of their day -end p rocesses for the due date, irrespective of the time of running \nsuch processes. Similarly, classification of borrower accounts as SMA as well as \nNPA shall be done as part of day -end process for the relevant date and the SMA \n                                                            \n11 Vide circulars DOR.STR.REC.68/21.04.048/2021 -22 dated November 12, 2021  and DOR.STR.REC.85/21.04.048/ \n2021 -22 dated February 15, 2022  \n12 \u2018Default\u2019 means non -payment of debt (as defined under the IBC) when whole or any part or instalment of the debt \nhas become due and payable and is not paid by t he debtor or the corporate debtor, as the case may be.  \n13 Agricultural advances governed by crop season -based asset classification norms shall be exempt from this \ninstruction.   \n-40- \n or NPA classification date shall be the calendar date for which the day end process \nis run. In other words, the date of SMA/NPA shall reflect the asset classification \nstatus of an account at the day -end of that calendar date.  \nExample:  If due date of a loan account is March 31, 2021, and f ull dues are not received \nbefore the lending institution runs the day -end process for this date, the date of overdue \nshall be March 31, 2021. If it continues to remain overdue, then this account shall get \ntagged as SMA -1 upon running day -end process on Apr il 30, 2021 i.e. upon  completion \nof 30 days of being continuously overdue. Accordingly, the date of SMA -1 classification \nfor that account shall be April 30, 2021.  \nSimilarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, it shall get tagged as SMA -2 upon \nrunning day -end process on May 30, 2021 and if continues to remain overdue further, it \nshall get classified as NPA upon running day -end process on June 29, 2021.  \n8A.5.  Loan accounts classified as NPAs may be upgraded as \u2018standard\u2019 asset only if \nentire arrears of int erest and principal are paid by the borrower. HFCs shall have \ntime till September 30, 2022 to put in place the necessary systems to implement \nthis provision.  \nIn case of borrowers having more than one credit facility, loan accounts shall be \nupgraded from NP A to standard asset category only upon repayment of entire \narrears of interest and principal pertaining to all the credit facilities.  \n8A.6.  Consumer Education on SMA/ NPA  \nWith a view to increasing awareness among the borrowers, HFCs should place \nconsumer educati on literature on their websites, explaining with examples, the \nconcepts of date of overdue, SMA and NPA classification and upgradation, with \nspecific reference to day -end process. HFCs shall also consider displaying such \nconsumer education literature in th eir branches by means of posters and/or other \nappropriate media. Further, it shall also be ensured that their front -line officers \neducate borrowers about all these concepts, with respect to loans availed by them, \nat the time of sanction/disbursal/renewal o f loans.  \n \n  \n-41- \n 8B. Framework for Compromise Settlements and Technical Write -offs14 \nHFCs shall comply with the instructions contained in circular on \u2018Framework for \nCompromise Set tlements and Technical Write -offs\u2019 dated June 08, 2023 , as \namended from time to time.  \n9. Income Recognition  \n9.1. The income recognition shall be based on recognised accounting principles.   \n9.2. Incom e including interest/ discount or any other charges on NPA shall be \nrecognised only when it is actually realised. Any such income recognised before \nthe asset became non -performing and remaining unrealised shall be reversed.  \n9.3. In respect of hire purchase assets, where instalments are overdue for more than \ntwelve months, income  shall be recognised only when hire charges are actually \nreceived. Any such income taken to the credit of profit and loss account before the \nasset becoming non -performing and remaining unrealised, shall be reversed.  \n9.4. In respect of lease assets, where lease rentals are overdue for more than twelve \nmonths, the income shall be recognised only when lease rentals are actually \nreceived. The net lease rentals taken to the credit of profit and loss account before \nthe asset became non -performing and remaining unreali sed shall be reversed.   \nExplanation: For the purpose of this paragraph, \u2018net lease rentals\u2019 mean gross \nlease rentals as adjusted by the lease adjustment account debited/credited to the \nprofit and loss account and as reduced by depreciation at the rate app licable under \nschedule XIV of the Companies Act, 1956.  \n9.5. In cases of loans where moratorium has been granted for repayment of interest, \nthe interest income may be recognised on accrual basis for accounts which \ncontinue to be classified as \u2018standard\u2019.  \n9.6. If loa ns with moratorium on payment of interest (permitted at the time of sanction \nof the loan) become NPA after the moratorium period is over, the capitalized \ninterest corresponding to the interest accrued during such moratorium period need \nnot be reversed.  \n \n                                                            \n14 Inserted vide  circular DOR.STR.REC.20/21.04.048/2023 -24 dated June 08, 2023   \n-42- \n 10. Income from Investment  \n10.1.  Income  from dividend on shares of corporate bodies and units of mutual funds \nshall be taken  into account on cash basis.  \nProvided  that the income from dividend on shares of corporate bodies shall be \ntaken into account on accrual basis w hen such dividend has been declared by \nthe corporate body in its annual general meeting and the HFC\u2019s right to receive \npayment is established.  \n10.2.  Income  from bonds and debentures of corporate bodies and from Government \nsecurities/  bonds shall be taken into a ccount on accrual basis.  \nProvided  that the interest rate on these instruments is pre -determined and \ninterest is serviced regularly and is not in arrears.  \n10.3.  Income  on securities of corporate bodies or public -sector  undertakings, the \npayment of interest and re payment of principal of which have been guaranteed \nby Central Government or a State Government shall be taken into account on \naccrual basis . \n11. Investment Policy  and Accounting for Investments  \n11.1.  The Board of Directors of every HFC shall frame investment policy for the \ncompany  and shall implement the same.  The criteria to classify the investments  \ninto current and long -term investments shall be spelt out by the Board of the \ncompany ex-ante in the  investment policy.  Investments in securities shall be \nclassified int o current and long term, at the time of making each investment.  In \ncase of inter -class transfer \u2013  \na. There shall be no such transfer on ad -hoc basis.  \nb. Such transfer, if warranted, sh all be effected only at the beginning of each half \nyear, on April 1 or Octobe r 1, with the approval of the Board.  \nc. The investments shall be transferred scrip -wise, from current to long term or \nvice-versa, at book value or market value, whichever is lower.  \nd. The depreciation,  if any, in each scrip shall be fully provided for and \napprec iation, if any, shall be ignored.   \n-43- \n e. The depreciation in one scrip shall not be set off against appreciation in another \nscrip, at the time of such inter -class transfer, even in respect of the scrips of \nthe same category.  \n11.2.  Accounting for Investments  \n11.2.1.  Quoted cur rent investments shall, for the purpose of valuation, be grouped \ninto the following categories, viz.  \na. equity shares  \nb. preference shares,  \nc. debentures and bonds,  \nd. Government securities including treasury bills,  \ne. units of mutual fund, and  \nf. others.  \n11.2.2.  Quoted current in vestments for each category shall be valued at cost or \nmarket value whichever is lower. For this purpose, the investments in each \ncategory shall be considered scrip -wise and the cost and market value \naggregated for all investments in each category. If the aggregate market \nvalue for the category is less than the aggregate cost for that category, the \nnet depreciation shall be provided for or charged to the profit and loss \naccount. If the aggregate market value for the category exceeds the \naggregate cost for t he category, the net appreciation shall be ignored.  \nDepreciation in one category of investments shall not be set off against \nappreciation in another category.  \n11.2.3.  Unquoted  equity shares in the nature of current investments shall be valued \nat cost or breakup v alue, whichever is lower. Where th e balance sheet of the \ninvestee company is not available for two years, such shares shall be valued \nat one Rupee only.   \n11.2.4.  Unquoted preference shares in the nature of current investments shall be \nvalued at cost or face value  or the net asset value , whichever is lower.  In \ncase the net asset value is negative or the balance sheet of the investee \ncompany is not available for two years, it should be valued at Rupee one per \ncompany.  \n11.2.5.  Investments in unquoted Government securities or  Government guaranteed \nbonds shall be valued at carrying cost.   \n-44- \n 11.2.6.  Unquoted investments in the units of mutual funds in the nature of current \ninvestments shall be valued at the net asset value declared by the mutual \nfund in respect of each particular scheme.  \n11.2.7.  Commercial papers shall be valued at carrying cost.  \n11.2.8.  A long-term investment shall be valued in accordanc e with the applicable  \nAccounting Standard s. \nNote: Unquoted debentures shall be treated as term loans or other type of credit \nfacilities depending upon t he tenure of such debentures for the purpose of income \nrecognition and asset classification.  \n \n12. Provisioning Requirements  \nThe provisioning requirements as given below shall apply to every HFC.  \nEvery HFC shall, after taking into account the time lag between a n account \nbecoming non -performing, its recognition as such, the realisation of the security and \nthe erosion over time in the value of security charged, make provision against  \nstandard assets,  sub-standard assets, doubtful assets and loss assets as provided  \nhereunder:   \nLoans, advances and other credit facilities including bills purchased and discounted -  \n12.1.  The provisioning requirement in respect of loans, advances and other credit \nfacilities including bills purchased and discounted shall be as under:  \nLoss Asse ts  The entire asset shall be written off. If the assets are \npermitted to remain in the books for any reason, 100% \nof the outstanding shall be provided for.  \nDoubtful Assets  (a) 100% provision to the extent to which the advance \nis not covered by the realis able value of the security to \nwhich the HFC has a valid recourse shall be made. The \nrealisable value is to be estimated on a realistic basis;   \n-45- \n (b) In addition to item (a) above, depending upon the \nperiod for which the  asset has remained doubtful, \nprovisio n to the extent of 2 5% to 100% of the secured \nportion  (i.e. estimated realisable value of the \noutstanding) shall be made on the following basis:  \nPeriod for which the asset has been \nconsidered as doubtful  Per cent of \nprovision (%)  \n Up to one year  25 \n One to three years   40 \n More than three years  100 \nSub-standard \nassets  A general provision of 1 5 per cent of total outstanding \nshall be made . \nStandard assets  \n(not applicable \nto HFC s in \nUpper Layer)  (a) Standard Assets in \nrespect of housing loans at \nteaser/ special rates i.e. \nhousing loans at \ncomparatively lower rates of \ninterest in the first few years \nafter which rates are re -set at \nhigher  rates  2% provision on the \ntotal outstanding \namount of such loans. \nThe provisioning of \nthese loans to be reset \nafter one year at the \napplicable rates from \nthe date on which the \nrates are reset at higher \nrates if the accounts \nremain \u2018standard\u2019  \n(b)(i) Standard Assets in \nrespect of Commercial Real \nEstates  - Residential \nHousing  (CRE -RH) 0.75% on the total \noutstanding amo unt of \nsuch loans  \n(b)(ii) Standard Assets in \nrespect of all other \nCommercial Real Estates \n(CRE)  1.00% on the total \noutstanding amount of \nsuch loans   \n-46- \n (b)(iii) Standard Assets in \nrespect of Individual Housing \nLoans  0.25% on the total \noutstanding amount of  \nsuch loans  \n(c) Standard Assets in \nrespect of all loans other \nthan (a) & (b) above  A general provision of \n0.4% of the total \noutstanding amount of \nloans which are \nstandard assets shall \nbe made  \n \nProvided that no provision need be made towards the portion of housing loan \nguaranteed by CRGFTLIH becomes non -performing. However, the amount \noutstanding in excess of the guaranteed portion should be provided for as per the \nextent directions on provisioning requirement.  \nNote:  \na. Loans  under Rural Housing Funds Scheme / Urban Housing Funds Schemes are \nnot to be regarded as loans given at teaser/  special rates.  \nb. Commercial Real Estate \u2013 Residential Housing (CRE \u2013RH) would consist of loans \nto builders/  developers for residential housing projects (except for captive \nconsumpt ion) under CRE segment. Such project should ordinarily not include \nnon-residential commercial real estate. However integrated housing project \ncomprising of some commercial spaces (e.g. shopping complex, school etc.) can \nalso be specified under CRE -RH, prov ided that the commercial area in the \nresidential housing project does not exceed 10 per cent of the total Floor Space \nIndex (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the \npredominantly residential housing complex exceed the ceiling of the project \nloans, the entire loan should be classified as CRE and not CRE -RH.  \nc. Other commercial real estate  (CRE)  would consist of loan to builders/ developers/ \nother for office building, retail space, multi -purpose commercial premises, multi -\ntenanted com mercial premises, industrial or warehouse space, hotels, land  \n-47- \n acquisition, development and construction etc. other than those covered by note \n(b) above.  \nd. Loans for third dwelling unit onwards to an individual will also be treated as CRE \nexposure.  \ne. The revis ed provisioning norms relating to standard category of individual \nhousing loans would be effective prospectively but the provisions held at present \ntowards such loans should not be reversed. However, in future, if by applying the \nrevised provisioning norms , any provisions are required over and above the level \nof provisions currently held for the standard category of such loans, these should \nbe duly provided for.  \nf. The provisions on standard assets should not be reckoned for arriving at net \nNPAs.  \ng. The provision s towards standard assets need not be netted from gross advances \nbut shown separately as \u2018Contingent Provisions against Standard Assets\u2019 in the \nbalance sheet.  \nLease and hire purchase assets \u2013  \n12.2.  The provisioning requirements in respect of hire purchase and l eased assets shall \nbe as under:  \n12.2.1.  Hire purchase assets - In respect of hire purchase assets, the total dues \n(overdue and future instalments taken together)  as reduced by  \na. the finance charges not credited to the profit and loss account and \ncarried forward as unmatured finance charges; and  \nb. the depreciated value of the underlying asset, shall be provided for.  \nExplanation: For the purpose of this paragraph,  \ni. the depreciated value of the asset shall be notionally computed as the \noriginal cost of the asset to be re duced by depreciation at the rate of \ntwenty per cent per annum on a straight -line method; and  \nii. in the case of second hand asset, the original cost shall be the actual \ncost incurred for acquisition of such second -hand asset.   \nAdditional  provision for hire purchase and leased assets   \n-48- \n 12.2.2.  In respect of hire purchase and leased assets, additional provision shall be \nmade as under:  \n(a) Where hire charges or lease rentals are overdue \nup to 12 months  Nil \n(b)  Where hire charges or lease rentals are overdue \nfor more than  12 months up  to 24 months  10 per  cent of the \nnet book value  \n(c) Where hire charges or lease rentals are overdue \nfor more than 24 months but up  to 36 months  40 per  cent of the \nnet book value  \n(d) Where hire charges or lease rentals are overdue \nfor more than 36 months but up  to 48 months  70 per  cent of the \nnet book value  \n(e) Where hire charges or lease rentals are overdue \nfor more than 48 months  100 per  cent of the \nnet book value  \n \n12.2.3.  On expiry of a period of 12 months after the due date of the last instal ment of \nhire purchase/  leased asset, the entire net book value shall be fully provided \nfor.  \nNotes:  \na. The amount of caution money/  margin money or security deposits kept by the \nborrower with the HFC in pursuance of the hire purchase agreement shall be \ndeduc ted against the provi sions stipulated under Paragraph  12.2.1 above, if not \nalready taken into account while arriving at the equated monthly instalments \nunder the agreement. The value of any other security available in pursuance to \nthe hire purchase agreeme nt shall be deducted only against the provisions \nstipulated under Paragraph  12.2.2 above .  \nb. The amount of security deposits kept by the borrower with the HFC in pursuance \nto the lease agreement together with the value of any other security available in \npursuance to the lease agreement shall be deducted only against the provisions \nstipulated under Paragraph  12.2.2 above.  \nc. It is clarified that income recognition on and pro visioning against  NPAs are two \ndifferent aspects of prudential norms and provisions as per  the norms are \nrequired to be made on NPAs on total outstanding balances including the \ndepreciated book value of the leased asset under reference after adjusting the \nbalance, if any, in the lease adjustment account.  The fact that income on an  \n-49- \n NPA has not b een recognised shall not be taken as reason for not making \nprovision.  \nd. An asset which has been renegotiated or rescheduled as referred to in Sub-\nparagraph (b) of Paragraph  8.3.2 of these directions  shall be a sub -standard \nasset or continue to remain in the same category in which it was prior to its \nrenegotiation or re -schedulement as a doubtful asset or a loss asset as the case \nmay be. Necessary provision shall be made as applicable to suc h asset till it is \nupgraded. In case where an asset has been reschedul ed on account of natural \ncalamities having impaired the repaying capacity of the borrower as provided in \nSub-paragraph (b) of Paragraph  8.3.2, any provisioning made prior to such \nrescheduling shall neither be written back nor adjusted against any provision ing \nrequirements that may arise in future.  \ne. All financial leases w ritten on or after April 1, 2002 shall attract the provisioning \nrequirements as applicable to hire purchase assets.  \n13. Policy on Demand/ Call Loans  \n13.1.  The Board of Directors of every  HFC granting/  intending to grant demand/  call \nloans shall frame a policy for the company and implement the same.  \n13.2.  Such policy shall, inter alia, stipulate  guidelines in respect of  the following - \na. A cut -off date within which the repayment of demand or call loan shall be \ndemanded or called up . \nb. The sanctioning authority shall, record specific reasons in writing at the time \nof sanctioning demand or call loan, if the cut -off date for demanding or calling \nup such loan is stipulated beyond a period of one year from the date of \nsanction . \nc. The rate of interest which shall be payable on such loans . \nd. Interest on such loans, as stipulated shall be payable either at monthly or \nquarterly basis . \ne. The sanctioning authority shall, record specific reasons in writing at the time \nof sanctioning demand or call loan, if no interest is stipulated or a moratorium \nis granted for any period .  \n-50- \n f. A cut -off date, for review of performa nce of the loan, not exceeding six months \ncommencing from the date of sanction . \ng. Such demand or call loans shall not be renewe d unless the periodical review \nhas shown satisfactory compliance with the terms of sanction.  \n14. Disclosure Norms  \nHFCs are required to make disclosures in their financial statements in accordance \nwith the guidelines in these Directions, applicable accounting s tandards, laws and \nregulations. The disclosures  specified in these directions are in addition to and not \nin substitution of the disclosure requirements specified under other laws, regulations, \nor accounting and financial reporting standards . More comprehen sive disclosures \nthan the minimum required are encouraged, especially if such disclosures  \nsignificant ly aid in the understanding of the financial position and performance.  \nPlease refer to the formats specified in Annex III  and Annex IV . \n15. Disclosure of Non -Performing Assets and Provisions  in balance sheet  \n15.1.  The outstanding amount and the provisions  made as per Paragraph  12 above , \nwithout netting them from the income or against the value of assets,  shall be \ndistinctly disclosed under separate heads of accounts f or housing and non -\nhousing finance business and individually for each type of assets in the balance \nsheet as under:  \na. for standard, sub -standard, doubtful and loss assets separately for housing \nand non -housing finance business along with total; and  \nb. for depr eciation in investments.  \n15.2.  Such provisions shall not be appropriated from the general provisions and loss \nreserves held, if any, by the housing finance company.   \n15.3.

HFCs , as principal, are responsible for the action of their agents. Hence, they should \nensure that their agents , engaged for recovery of their dues should strictly adhere to \nthese guidelines and instruction including the fair practice code for HFCs, while \nengaging in the process of recovery of dues.  \n\u2018Agents\u2019 for the purpose of these guidelines would include agencies engaged by the \nHFCs and the agents/ employees of the concerned agencies.  \nIt is expected that the HFCs would, in the normal course , ensure that their own \nemployees  also adhere to the se guideline s during the loan recovery process.  \n2. Engagement of Recovery Agents  \nHFCs  should have a due diligence process in place for engagement of recovery \nagents, which should be structured to cover, among others, individuals involved in the \nrecovery process. HFCs should also ensure that the agents engaged by them in the \nrecovery process , carry out verification of the antecedents of their employees, which \nmay include pre -employment police verification, as a matter of abundant caution and \nHFCs may decide the periodicity at which re -verification of antecedents should be \nresorted to.  \n3. Trainin g of Recovery Agents  \n3.1. HFCs should ensure that, among others, the recovery agents are properly trained \nto handle with care and sensitivity, their responsibilities, in particular aspects like \nhours of calling, privacy of customer information etc.  \n3.2. HFCs should ensure that over a period of one year , all their recovery agents \nundergo the training  as prescribed by Indian Institute of Banking and Finance (IIBF)  \nand obtain the certificate from the institute. Further, the service providers engaged \nby HFCs , should also  employ only such personnel who have undergone the above \ntraining and obtained the certificate from the IIBF.  \n \n                                                            \n47 These guidelines shall be adopted by HFCs for the compliance of Paragraph 5.7.2 of the Directions on Managing \nRisks and Code of Conduct in Outsourcing of Financial Services .  \n-200- \n 4. Intimating borrowers about Recovery Agents  \n4.1. HFC shall prominently display the list of recovery agency firms/ companies/ \nindividual as the case may  be, empanelled with it including name and period of \nempanelment on its website, branches/ offices, mobile applications or any other \nplatform which is being used for engagement with customer.  \n4.2. To ensure due notice and appropriate authorization, HFCs should inform the \nborrower , the details of recovery agency firms/ companies while forwarding default \ncases to the recovery agency.  \n4.3. Further, in some of the cases, the borrower might not have received the details \nabout the recovery agency due to refusal/ non -availa bility/ avoidance. To ensure \nidentification, it would be appropriate if the agent also carries a copy of the notice \nand the authorization letter from the HFC along with the identity card issued to him \nby the HFC or the agency firm/ company. Where the recov ery agency is changed \nby the HFC during the recovery process, in addition to the HFC notifying the \nborrower of the change , the new agent should carry the notice and the \nauthorization letter with his identity card.  \n4.4. The notice and the authorization letter sh ould, among other details, also include \nthe telephone numbers of the relevant recovery agency. HFCs should ensure that \nthere is a tape recording of the content/ text of the calls made by the recovery \nagents to the customers and vice -versa , with the knowled ge of the customer . HFCs \nmay take reasonable precautions such as intimating the customer that the \nconversation is being recorded, etc.  \n5. Incentives to Recovery Agents  \nStiff targets or high incentives may induce agents to use intimidatory and questionable \nmethods for recovery of dues. HFCs are, therefore, advised to ensure that the \ncontracts with the recovery agent do not induce adoption of uncivilised, unlawful and \nquestionable behaviour or recovery process.  \n6. Methods followed by Recovery Agents  \nAll the members  of the staff or any person authorised to represent the HFC in \ncollection or/and security repossession should follow the guidelines set out, such as:   \n-201- \n a. Customer would be contacted ordinarily at the place of his/ her choice and in the \nabsence of any specified  place at the place of his/ her residence and if unavailable \nat his/ her residence, at the place of business/ occupation.  \nb. Identity and authority to represent the HFC should be made known to the customer \nat the first instance.  \nc. Customer\u2019s privacy should be r espected.  \nd. Interaction with the customer shall be in a civil manner.  \ne. HFCs\u2019 representatives shall contact customers between 8.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. for \nrecovery of overdue loans . \nf. Customer\u2019s request to avoid call at a particular time or at a particular place s hall \nbe honoured as far as possible.  \ng. The time and number of calls and contents of conversation should be documented.  \nh. All assistance should be given to resolve disputes or differences regarding dues in \na mutually acceptable and in an orderly manner.  \ni. During visits to customer\u2019s place for dues collection, decency and decorum should \nmaintained.  \nj. Only employees of the Recovery Agency shall visit the borrower\u2019s premises for the \nrecovery/ collection activity and no other person shall accompany such Recovery \nAgent.  \nk. Inappropriate occasions such as bereavement in the family or such other \ncalamitous occasion , or marriage functions, festivals etc.  should be avoided for \nmaking calls/ visits to collect dues.  \nl. The written communication sent by the collection agent to the bor rower should \nhave the approval of the HFC.  \nm. HFCs shall interact  only with the customer / borrower or the guarantor  (only if so \nrequired)  and shall not approach any other relatives/ contacts of the borrower . \n7. Taking possession of property mortgaged to HFCs \n7.1. It has been observed by the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court that we are governed by rule \nof law in the country and the recovery of loans or seizure of asset could be done \nonly through legal means. It is emphasised in this context that HFCs may rely on \nlegal remedies av ailable under the relevant statutes while enforcing security  \n-202- \n interest without intervention of the courts. In this context, it may be mentioned that \nthe Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of \nSecurity Interest Act, 2002 (SA RFAESI Act) and the Security Interest \n(Enforcement) Rules, 2002 , framed thereunder have laid down well -defined \nprocedures not only for enforcing security interest but also for auctioning the \nmovable and immovable property after enforcing the security inter est. \n7.2. Where HFCs have incorporated a pre -possession clause in the contract with the \nborrower and rely on such pre -possession clause for enforcing their rights, they \nshould ensure that the pre -possession clause is legally valid, complies with the \nprovisions of the Indian Contract Act in letter and spirit, and ensure that such \nprepossession clause is clearly brought to the notice of the borrower at the time of \nexecution of the contract. The terms and condition of the contract should be strictly \nin terms of the  disclosed recovery policy and should contain provisions regarding : \na. Notice period before taking possession ;  \nb. circumstances under which the notice period can be waived ; \nc. the procedure for taking possession of the security ; \nd. a provision regarding final chance to be given to the borrower for repayment of \nloan before the sale/ auction of the property ; \ne. the procedure for giving repossession to the borrower ; and  \nf. the procedure for sale/ auction of the property.  \n8. Use of forum of Lok Adalats  \nThe Honourable Supreme Cour t has also observed, inter alia, that loans, personal \nloans, credit card loans and housing loans with less than  \u20b910 lakh can be referred to \nLok Adalats. HFCs are encouraged to use the forum of Lok Adalats for recovery of \nhousing loans with less than  \u20b910 lakh as suggested by Honourable Supreme Court.  \n9. Utilisation of Credit Counsellors  \nHFCs should have in place an app ropriate mechanism to utilize the service of credit \ncounsellors for providing suitable counselling to the borrowers where they become \naware that the case of a particular borrower deserves sympathetic consideration.  \n  \n-203- \n 10. Complaints against the H FC/ its Recovery  Agents  \n10.1.  Complaints received by NHB regarding violation of the above guidelines and \nadoption of above practices followed by recovery agents of HFCs would be viewed \nseriously. Supervisory actions could be att racted when the High Courts or the \nSupreme Court p ass strictures or impose penalties against any HFC or its \nDirectors/ Officers/ agents with regard to policy, practice and procedures related \nto the recovery process.  \n10.2.  Where a grievance/ complaint has been lodged, HFCs should not forward cases \nto recovery ag encies till they have finally disposed of any grievance/ complaint \nlodged by the concerned borrower. However, where the HFC is convinced, with \nappropriate proof, that the borrower is continuously making frivolous/ vexatious \ncomplaints, it may continue with  the recovery proceedings through the Recovery \nAgents even if a grievance/ complaint is pending with them. In case where the \nsubject matter of the borrower\u2019s dues might be sub judice , HFCs should exercise \nutmost caution, as appropriate, in referring the ma tter to the recovery agencies, \ndepending on the circumstances.  \n10.3.  Each HFC should have a mechanism whereby the borrower grievances with \nregards to the recovery process can be addressed. The details of the mechanism \nshould also be furnished to the borrower whi le advising the details of the recovery \nagency as at Para graph  4 above.  \n11. Periodical review, monitoring and control  \nHFCs engaging recovery agents are advised to undertake a periodical review of the \nmechanism to learn from experience, to effect improvement an d to bring to the notice \nof the Bank  suggestion for improvement in the guidelines.  \n12.

HFCs should, at least on an annual basis, review the financial and operation \ncondition of the service providers to assess their ability to continue to meet their \noutsourcing conditions. Such due diligence reviews, which can be based on all \navailable information about the service provider should highlight any deterioration \nor breach in performance standards, confidentiality and security, and in business \ncontinuity prep aredness.   \n-204- \n 12.2.  The outsourcing agreement  should provide for the prohibition of further \noutsourcing by the service provider for all or part of an outsourced activity;  \n12.3.  HFCs should have in place a management structure to monitor and control its \noutsourcing activi ties. It should ensure that outsourcing agreement with the service \nproviders contain provisions to address their monitoring and control of outsourced \nactivities.  \n12.4.  Regular audits by either the internal auditors or external auditors of the HFC should \nassess t he adequacy of the risk management practices adopted in overseeing and \nmanaging the outsourcing arrangement, the HFC\u2019s compliance with its risk \nmanagement framework and the requirements of these guidelines.  \n12.5.  In the event of termination of the agreement for any reason, this should be \npublicized so as to ensure that the customers do not continue to deal with that \nservice providers.  \n12.6.  HFCs should constitute a Grievance Redressal Machinery within the company and \ngive wide publicity about it through electronic and print media. The name and \ncontact number of designated grievance redressal officer of the HFC should be \nmade known and widely publicised. The designated officer should ensure that \ngenuine grievances of customers are redressed promptly without any delay. It  \nshould be clearly indicated that HFCs Grievance Redressal Machinery will also \ndeal with the issue relating to services provided by the outsourced agency.  \n12.7.  Generally, a time limit of one month  may be given to the customer for preferring \ntheir complaints/ gr ievances.

All products, services, facilities, etc. offered by housing finance companies (HFCs) \nshould be made available to visually impaired persons and should be offered at all \nbranches/ offices of the HFC.  \n2. All products, services, facilities, etc. must be made available to visually impaired \ncustomers as are offered to other customers and their impairment of vision should not \nbe a criterion for sanctioning/  denying a loan.  \n3. HFCs must provide the same facilities to a visuall y impaired customer as it would to \nany other customer.  \n4. HFCs must follow the same procedure for extending products, services, facilities, etc. \noffered by them to a visually impaired customer as it does for its other customers.  \n5. No additional burden of inte rest payment, collateral and other terms should be \nimposed on the visually impaired customer.  \n6. If the credit policy of an HFC does not insist for a co -borrower or a guarantor for other \ncustomers for any type of loan facilities extended by it, the same shou ld not be insisted \nupon for a visually impaired customer.  \n7. HFCs should not equate visually impaired customers with illiterate customers.  \n8. HFCs should not deny any services to visually impaired customers including visually \nimpaired customers who use their t humb impression. If necessary, HFCs may take a \nDeclaration of Thumb Impression as an additional document  from visually impaired \ncustomer.  \n9. Additional facilities like reading and filling up of forms, slips, etc. should be provided \nto a visually impaired cus tomer. The Officer/ Manager of the branch/ office should read \nout the rules of business and other terms and conditions in the presence of a witness, \nif required by the customer.  \n10.

In this con text, there is a need for \nputting in place a system/ procedure for realistic valuation of properties/ fixed assets and \nalso for empanelment of valuers for the purpose. HFCs shall be guided by the following \naspects while formulating a policy on valuation of  properties and appointment of valuers:  \n1. Policy for valuation of immovable properties  \n1.1. HFCs shall have a Board approved policy in place for valuation of properties \nincluding collaterals accepted for their exposures.  \n1.2. The valuation shall be done by professi onally qualified independent valuers i.e. the \nvaluer should not have a direct or indirect interest. However, valuation of properties \nby the internal technical valuers of housing finance companies is permissible \nsubject to the internal technical valuer havi ng qualifications similar to those \nprescribed under the Companies (Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017.   \n1.3. The frequency of valuation shall be decided by the Board of a n HFC, based on the \nobserved volatility in the prices of the assets in the past  except annually in the case \nof Non -Performing Asset (NPA). The frequency of valuation in case of Non -\nPerforming Asset (NPA) shall be annual in case of assets classified as sub -\nstandard for more than six months or the classification of assets as doubtful a ssets. \nThe frequency decided by the HFC shall be reviewed by its Board annually. \nFurther, where the value of the properties has been substantially impaired by any \nevent, these are to be immediately revalued and appropriately factored in to capital \nadequacy  computation.  \n1.4. Valuation procedure to be followed to ensure that the realisable value of properties \nis reasonably estimated.  \n1.5. HFCs shall obtain minimum two valuation reports, at least one of them being from \nan independent valuer, in case the loan amount is  \u20b950 lakh or above (or such any \nother lower value as may be decided by the Board of the company) and below \u20b975  \n-215- \n lakh. The lower of the two valuations shall be considered by the HFC for deciding \nupon the loan amount.   \n1.6. In case the loan amount is \u20b975 lakh or above, HFCs shall necessarily obtain \nminimum two independent valuation reports and the lower  of the two shall be \nconsidered by the HFC for deciding upon the loan amount.  \n1.7. (Deleted)  \n1.8. The requirement of valuation in respect of financing of the initial purchase  of a \nresidential dwelling unit from a State Housing Board/Municipal Corporation/ \nDevelopmental Authority or other public agencies by an HFC shall be decided by \nthe company with the approval of its Board.  \n1.9. In respect of financing of any initial transaction of the purchase of a property, the \nvalue of the property for the purposes of arriving at the Loan to Value ratio (LTV) \nshould not exceed the documented transaction value as per the agreement to sale, \nsale deed etc. Valuation in such cases, if required, may  be done as per the policy \napproved by the Board of the company.   \n2. Policy of revaluation of HFC\u2019s own properties  \nIn addition to the above, the HFCs may keep the following aspects in view while \nformulating policy for revaluation of their own properties:  \n2.1. HFCs have been permitted to include revaluation reserves at a discount of 55% as \na part of Tier 2 Capital. In view of this, it is necessary that revaluation reserves \nrepresent true appreciation in the market value of the properties and HFCs have \nin place a comprehensive policy for revaluation of fixed assets owned by them. \nHFCs shall have a Board approved comprehensive policy in place for valuation of \nits own properties and such a policy should inter -alia cover procedure for \nidentification of assets for reva luation, maintenance of separate set of records for \nsuch assets, the frequency of revaluation, depreciation policy for such assets, \npolicy for sale of such revalued assets etc. The policy should also cover the \ndisclosure required to be made in the 'Notes o n Account' regarding the details of \nrevaluation such as the original cost of the fixed assets subject to revaluation and \naccounting treatment for appreciation/ depreciation etc.   \n-216- \n 2.2. As the revaluation should reflect the change in the fair value of the fixed a sset, the \nfrequency of revaluation should be determined based on the observed volatility in \nthe prices of the assets in the past. Further, any change in the method of \ndepreciation should reflect the change in the expected pattern of consumption of \nthe futu re economic benefits of the assets. The HFCs should adhere to these \nprinciples meticulously while changing the frequency of revaluation/method of \ndepreciation for a particular class of asset and should make proper disclosures in \nthis regard.  \n3. Policy for Em panelment of Independent Valuers  \n3.1. HFCs should have a procedure for empanelment of professional valuers and \nmaintain a register of 'approved list of valuers'.  \n3.2. HFCs shall prescribe a minimum qualification and minimum post qualification \nexperience for empane lment of valuers. Different qualifications and experience \nmay be prescribed for different classes of assets (e.g. land and building, plant and \nmachinery, agricultural land, etc.). While prescribing the qualifications, HFCs may \ntake into consideration the q ualifications prescribed under Section 34AB (Rule 8A) \nof the Wealth Tax Act, 1957.  \n3.3. While framing the above policy, HFCs shall also be guided by the provisions of the \nSection 247 of the Companies Act, 2013, Rules made or to be made thereunder \nand amendment s therein, from time to time. Further, HFCs shall also be guided by \nrelevant Accounting Standard s.  \n   \n-217- \n Annex X V \n            (Deleted)48  \n \n  \n                                                            \n48 Vide circular DOR.FIN.REC.No.41/03.10.136/2021 -22 dated August 25, 2021   \n-218- \n  \nAnnex X VA \nInformation on secured assets possessed under the SARFAESI Act, 2002  \n \nSl. \nNo Branch \nName  State  Borrower \nNam e Guarantor \nName  \n(wherever \napplicable)  Registered \naddress of \nthe \nBorrower  Registered \naddress of \nthe \nGuarantor  \n(wherever \napplicable)  Outstanding \namount  \n(in \u20b9)  Asset \nClassifi -\ncation  Date of \nAsset \nclassification  Details of \nsecurity \npossessed  Name of \nthe Title \nholder of \nthe \nsecurity \npossessed  \n                        \n                        \n                        \n \n   \n-219- \n Annex XVI \nGuideline s for entry of Housing Finance Companies into Insurance Business  \nThe guidelines for entry of housing finance companies into insurance business are as \nfollow:  \n1.

The level of net non -performing assets should be not more than 3% of the total \noutstanding assets, including loans and advances taken together;  \nd. The HFC should have net profit for the last three continuous years;  \ne. The track record of the performance of the subsidiaries, if any, of the concerned \nHFC shou ld be satisfactory;  \nf. Regulatory compliances and servicing public deposits, if held.  \n2.2. In case where a foreign partner contributes 26 per cent of the equity with the \napproval of IRDA/ Foreign Investment Promotion Board, more than one HFC may \nbe allowed to part icipate in the equity of the Insurance JV Company. As such \nparticipants will also assume insurance risk, only those HFCs which satisfy the \ncriteria given in Paragraph  2.1 above, would be eligible.  \n2.3. In case more than one company (irrespective of doing financ ial activity or not) in \nthe same group of the HFC wishes to take a stake in the insurance company, the \ncontribution by all companies in the same group shall be counted for the limit of 50 \nper cent prescribed for the HFC in an Insurance JV Company.  \n2.4. In cases  where IRDA issues calls for capital infusion into the Insurance JV \nCompany, the Bank may, on a case to case basis, consider need based relaxation \nof the 50% group limit specified above. The relaxation, if permitted, will be subject \nto compliance by the HF C with all regulatory conditions specified under the \nguidelines and such other conditions as may be necessary in the specific case.  \n3. Making investments in the insurance company  \nHFCs  which are not eligible as joint venture participants, as above or otherwise  can \nmake investments up to 10 per cent of the Owned Fund of the HFC or  \u20b9 50 crore, \nwhichever is lower, in the insurance company. Such participation shall be treated as \nan investment and should be without any contingent liability for the HFC. The eligibili ty \ncriteria for the HFC will be as under \u2013  \n-221- \n 3.1. The NOF of the HFC should not be less than  \u20b9 100 crore;  \n3.2. The CRAR of the HFC should be not less than 12%;  \n3.3. The level of net non -performing assets should be not more than 3% of the total \noutstanding assets taken toge ther; \n3.4. The HFC should have net profit for the last three continuous years;  \n3.5. The track record of the performance of the subsidiaries, if any, of the concerned \nHFC should be satisfactory;  \n3.6. Regulatory compliance and servicing public deposits, if held.  \n4. No HFC wou ld be allowed to conduct such business departmentally. A subsidiary or \na company in the same group of a n HFC or of another HFC engaged in the business \nof housing finance or banking will not normally be allowed to join the insurance \ncompany on risk particip ation basis.  \n5. HFCs entering into insurance business as joint venture participant or investor or on \nrisk participation basis will be required to obtain prior approval  of the Bank . Application \nalong with supporting documents is to be submitted by the HFC to t he Bank . The Bank \nwill give permission to HFC on case to case basis keeping in view all relevant factors. \nIt should be ensured that risks involved in insurance business do not get transferred \nto the HFC and that the HFC business does not get contaminated b y any risks which \nmay arise from insurance business. There should be an 'arms -length' relationship \nbetween the HFCs and the insurance outfit.  \n6. Board Approved Policy  \nA comprehensive Board approved policy regarding undertaking insurance distribution, \nwhether under the agency or the br oking model should be formulated and services \nshould be offered to customers in accordance with this policy. The policy will also \nencompass issues of customer appropriateness and suitability as well as grievance \nredressal. It may be noted that as IRDA Guidelines do not permit group entities to take \nup both corporate agency and broking in the same group even through separate \nentities, HFCs or their group entities may undertake either insurance brokin g or \ncorporate agency business.  \n  \n-222- \n 7. Compliance with IRDA Guidelines  \n7.1. The IRDA (Licensing of Corporate Agents) Regulations, 2002, as amended from \ntime to time, as applicable, should be complied with by HFCs undertaking these \nactivities.  \n7.2. The deposit to be maintained by an insurance broker as pe r the IRDA (Licensing \nof Banks as Insurance Brokers) Regulations, 2013, as amended from time to time, \nshould be maintained with a scheduled commercial bank.  \n8. Ensuring Customer Appropriateness and Suitability  \nWhile undertaking insurance distribution business , either under the corporate agency \nor broking model under the relevant IRDA Regulations, HFCs must keep the following \nin view:  \n8.1. All employees dealing with insurance agency/ broking business should possess \nthe requisite qualification prescribed by IRDA.  \n8.2. There should be a system of assessment of the suitability of products for \ncustomers.  Pure risk term products with no investment or growth components that \nare simple and easy for the customer to understand will be deemed universally \nsuitable products. More com plex products with investment components will require \nthe HFC to necessarily undertake a customer need assessment prior to sale. It \nshould be ensured that there is a standardized system of assessing the needs of \nthe customer and that initiation/ transactio nal and approval processes are \nsegregated.  \n8.3. HFCs should treat their customers fairly, honestly and transparently, with regard \nto suitability and appropriateness of the insurance product sold.  \n9. Prohibition on Payment of Commission/ lncentive directly to HFC S taff \nThere should be no violation of the guidelines issued by IRDA in payment of \ncommissions/  brokerage/  incentives. This may be factored in while formulating a \nsuitable performance assessment and incentive structure for staff. Further, it must be \nensured that no incentive (cash or non -cash) should be paid to the staff engaged in \ninsurance broking/ corporate agency services by the insurance company .  \n  \n-223- \n 10. Transparency and Disclosures  \n10.1.  The HFCs should not follow any restrictive practices of forcing a customer to either \nopt for products of a specific insurance company or link sale of such products to \nany banking product. It should be prominently stated in all publicity material \ndistributed by the HFC that the purchase by a n HFC's customer of any insurance \nproducts is purely voluntary, and is not linked to availment of any other facility from \nthe HFC.  \n10.2.  Further, the details of fees/ brokerage received in respect of insurance br oking/ \nagency business undertaken by them should be disclosed in the 'Notes to \nAccounts' to t heir Balance Sheet.  \n \nNotes:  \n1. Holding of equity by a promoter HFC in an insurance company or participation in any \nform in insurance business will be subject to compliance with any rules and regulations \nlaid down by the IRDA/Central Government.  \n2. Eligibi lity criteria would be reckoned with reference to the latest available audited \nbalance sheet for the previous year;  \n3. Provisions of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987 would be applicable for such \ninvestments while computing the Net Owned Fund of the HFC . \n   \n-224- \n Annex X VII \nGuidelines on Wilful Defaulters  \nPurpose:  \nTo put in place a system to disseminate credit information pertaining to willful defaulters \nfor cautioning housing finance companies so as to ensure that further finance is not made \navailable to them.  \n1. Introduction  \nThe guidelines are  prescribed to put in place the mechanism of reporting the \ninformation on wilful defaults of  \u20b925 lakh and above by HFCs to all Credit Information \nCompanies  (CICs ). \n2. Guidelines on Wilful Defaulters   \n2.1. Definitions of \u2018Lender\u2019, \u2018Un it\u2019 and \u2018wilful default\u2019  \n2.1.1.  Lender: The term \u2018lender\u2019 covers all HFCs to which any amount is due, provided \nit is arising on account of any banking transaction, including off balance sheet \ntransactions such as derivatives, guarantees and letters of credit.  \n2.1.2.  Unit: The term \u2018unit\u2019 includes individuals, juristic persons and all other forms of \nbusiness enterprises, whether incorporated or not. In case of business \nenterprises (other than companies), HFCs may also report (in the Director \ncolumn of Appendix XVII (a)), the names of those persons who are in charge \nand responsible for the management of the affairs of the business enterprise.  \n2.1.3.  Wilful Default: A \u2018wilful default\u2019 would be deemed to have occurred if any of the \nfollowing events is  noted:  \na. The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment/ repayment obligations to the \nlender even when it has the capacity to honour the said obligations.  \nb. The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment/ repayment obligations to the \nlender and has not utilise d the finance from the lender for the specific \npurposes for which finance was availed of but has diverted the funds for \nother purposes.  \nc. The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment/ repayment obligations to the \nlender and has siphoned off the funds so th at the funds have not been  \n-225- \n utilized for the specific purpose for which finance was availed of, nor are the \nfunds available with the unit in the form of other assets.  \nd. The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment/ repayment obligations to the \nlender and ha s also disposed off or removed the movable fixed assets or \nimmovable property given for the purpose of securing a term loan without \nthe knowledge of the HFC/ lender.  \nThe identification of the wilful default should be made keeping in view the track \nrecord of the borrowers and should not be decided on the basis of isolated \ntransactions/ incidents. The default to be categorized  as wilful , must be \nintentional, deliberate and calculated.  \n2.2. Diversion and siphoning of funds  \n2.2.1.  Diversion of Funds: The term \u2018diversion o f funds\u2019 referred to at Paragraph  \n2.1.3(b) above, should be construed to include any one of the undernoted \noccurrences:  \na. utilization  of short -term working capital funds for long -term purposes not in \nconformity with the terms of sanction;  \nb. deploying borrowed  funds for purposes / activities or creation of assets \nother than those for which the loan was sanctioned;  \nc. transferring borrowed funds to the subsidiaries / companies in the same \ngroup or other corporates by whatever modalities;  \nd. routing of funds through any bank or members of consortium without prior \npermission of the lender;  \ne. investment in other companies by way of acquiring equities / debt \ninstruments without approval of lenders;  \nf. shortfall in deployment of funds vis -\u00e0-vis the amounts disbursed / drawn and \nthe difference not being accounted for.  \n2.2.2.  Siphoning of Funds: The term \u2018siphoning of funds\u2019, referred to at Paragraph  \n2.1.3(c) above, should be construed to occur if any funds borrowed from HFCs \nare utilised for purposes unrelated to the operations of th e borrower, to the \ndetriment of the financial health of the entity or of the lender. The decision as \nto whether a particular instance amounts to siphoning of funds would have to  \n-226- \n be a judgment of the lenders based on objective facts and circumstances of the  \ncase.  \n2.3. Cut-off Limits  \nWhile the penal measures indicated at Paragraph  2.5 below would normally be \nattracted by all the borrowers identified as wilful defaulters or the promoters \ninvolved in diversion/ siphoning of funds, keeping in view the present limit o f \u20b925 \nlakh fixed by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) for reporting of cases of \nwilful default, any wilful defaulter with an outstanding balance of  \u20b925 lakh or more, \nwould attract the penal measures stipulated at Paragraph  2.5 below. This limit of  \n\u20b925 lakh may also be applied for the purpose of taking cognizance  of the instances \nof siphoning/ diversion of funds.  \n2.4. End-Use of Funds  \nIn cases of project financing, the HFCs seek to ensure end use of funds by, inter \nalia, obtaining certification from the Char tered Accountants for the purpose. In case \nof short -term corporate/ clean loans, such an approach ought to be supplemented \nby 'due diligence' on the part of lenders themselves, and to the extent possible, \nsuch loans should be limited to only those borrower s whose integrity and reliability \nare above board. The HFCs, therefore, should not depend entirely on the \ncertificates issued by the Chartered Accountants but strengthen their internal \ncontrols and the credit risk management system to enhance the quality o f their loan \nportfolio.  \nThe requirement and related appropriate measures in ensuring end -use of funds \nby the HFCs , should form a part of their loan policy document. The following are \nsome of the illustrative measures that could be taken by the lenders for monitoring \nand ensuring end -use of funds:  \na. Meaningful scrutiny of quarterly progress reports/ operating statements/ \nbalance sheets of the borrowers;  \nb. Regular inspection of borrowers\u2019 assets charged to the lenders as security;  \nc. Periodical scrutiny of borrower s\u2019 books of accounts and the \u2018no -lien\u2019 accounts \nmaintained with other banks;  \nd. Periodical visits to the assisted units;   \n-227- \n e. System of periodical stock audit, in case of working capital finance;  \nf. Periodical comprehensive management audit of the \u2018credit\u2019 functio n of the \nlenders, so as to identify the systemic -weaknesses in their credit \nadministration.  \n(It may be kept in mind that this list of measures is only illustrative and by no means \nexhaustive.)  \n2.5. Penal Measures  \nThe following measures should be initiated by t he HFCs against the wilful \ndefaulters identified as per the definition indicated at Paragraph  2.1.3 above:  \n2.5.1.  No additional facilities should be granted by any HFC to the listed wilful \ndefaulters. In addition, such companies (including their entrepreneurs/ \npromoters) where HFCs have identified siphoning/ diversion of funds, \nmisrepresentation, falsification of accounts and fraudulent transactions , should \nbe debarred from institutional finance from the HFCs, SCBs, FIs, NBFCs, for \nfloating new ventures for a per iod of 5 years from the date of removal of their \nname from the list of wilful defaulters as published/  disseminated by RBI/  CICs.  \n2.5.2.  The legal process, wherever warranted, against the borrowers/ guarantors and \nforeclosure for recovery of dues should be initi ated expeditiously. The lenders \nmay initiate criminal proceedings against wilful defaulters, wherever necessary.  \n2.5.3.  Wherever possible, the HFCs should adopt a proactive approach for a change \nof management of the wilfully defaulting borrower unit.  \n2.5.4.  A covenant  in the loan agreements, with the companies to which the HFCs \nhave given funded/ non -funded credit facility, should be incorporated by the \nHFCs to the effect that the borrowing company should not induct on its Board \na person whose name appears in the list of wilful defaulters and that in case, \nsuch a person is found to be on its Board, it would take expeditious and \neffective steps for removal of the person from its board.  \nIt would be imperative on the part of the HFCs to put in place a transparent \nmechanism  for the entire process so that the penal provisions are not misused and \nthe scope of such discretionary powers are kept to the barest minimum. It should  \n-228- \n also be ensured that a solitary or isolated instance is not made the basis for \nimposing the penal acti on. \n2.6. Guarantees furnished by individuals, companies in the same group and not \nin the same group  \nWhile dealing with wilful default of a single borrowing company in a Group, the \nHFCs should consider the track record of the individual company, with reference \nto its repayment performance to its lenders. However, in cases where guarantees \nfurnished by the companies in the same Group on behalf of the wilfully defaulting \nunits are not honored  when invoked by the HFCs, such companies in the same \ngroup should also be  reckoned as wilful defaulters.  \nIn connection with the guarantors, in terms of Section 128 of the Indian Contract \nAct, 1872, the liability of the surety is co -extensive with that of the principal debtor \nunless it is otherwise provided by the contract. Ther efore, when a default is made \nin making repayment by the principal debtor, the lender will be able to proceed \nagainst the guarantor/ surety , even without exhausting the remedies against the \nprincipal debtor. As such, where a lender has made a claim on the guarantor on \naccount of the default made by the principal debtor, the liability of the guarantor is \nimmediate. In case the said guarantor refuses to comply with the demand made \nby the creditor/  lender, despite having sufficient means to make payment of the  \ndues, such guarantor would also be treated as a wilful defaulter. HFCs may ensure \nthat this position is made known to all guarantors at the time of accepting \nguarantees and it should also be a part of Fair Practice Code (FPC) of HFCs.  \n2.7. Role of auditors  \nIn case any falsification of accounts on the part of the borrowers is observed by \nthe HFCs, and if it is observed that the auditors were negligent or deficient in \nconducting the audit, they should lodge a formal complaint against the auditors of \nthe borrowers  with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to enable \nthe ICAI to examine and fix accountability of the auditors. Pending disciplinary \naction by ICAI, the complaints may also be forwarded to the NHB, RBI (Department \nof Supervision, Central  Office) and IBA for records.   \n-229- \n With a view to monitoring the end -use of funds, if the lenders desire a specific \ncertification from the borrowers\u2019 auditors regarding diversion/ siphoning of funds \nby the borrower, the lender should award a separate mandate to  the auditors for \nthe purpose. To facilitate such certification by the auditors, the HFCs will also need \nto ensure that appropriate covenants in the loan agreements are incorporated , so \nas to enable award of such a mandate by the lenders to the borrowers/ auditors.  \nIn addition to the above, HFCs are advised that with a view to ensuring proper end  \nuse of funds and preventing diversion/ siphoning of funds by the borrowers, lenders \ncould consider engaging their own auditors for such specific certification purp ose \nwithout relying on certification given by borrower\u2019s auditors. However, this cannot \nsubstitute a HFC\u2019s basic minimum own diligence in the matter.  \n2.8. Role of Internal Audit/ Inspection  \nThe aspect of diversion of funds by the borrowers should be adequately looked \ninto while conducting internal audit/ inspection of their offices/ branches and \nperiodical reviews on cases of wilful defaults should be submitted to the Audit \nCommittee of the HFC.  \n2.9. Reporting to Credit Information Companies  \n2.9.1.  All housing finance compa nies (HFCs) shall become members of all CICs and \nsubmit requisite data to CICs.  \n2.9.2.  HFCs should submit the list of suit -filed accounts and non -suit filed accounts of \nwilful defaulters of  \u20b925 lakh and above on a monthly or more frequent basis to \nall Credit Information Companies. This would enable such information to be \navailable to the HFCs on a near real time basis.  \nExplanation  In this connection, it is clarified that HFCs need not repor t cases \nwhere : \n(a) outstanding amount falls below  \u20b925 lakh and  \n(b) in respect of cases where HFCs have agreed for a compromise settlement \nand the borrower  has fully paid the compromised amount.  \n2.9.3.  Credit Information Companies (CICs) have also been advised to dissem inate \nthe information pertaining to suit filed accounts of wilful defaulters on their \nrespective websites.   \n-230- \n 3. Mechanism for identification of Wilful Defaulters  \nThe mechanism referred to in Paragraph  2.5 above should generally include the \nfollowing:  \n3.1. The evide nce of wilful default on the part of the borrowing company and its \npromoter/ whole -time director at the relevant time should be examined by an \nIdentification Committee headed by an Executive Director or equivalent or below \nthe rank of Chairman/ Chairman & Managing Director or the Managing Director & \nChief Executive Officer/ CEOs and consisting of two other senior officers of the \nrank of GM/ DGM.  \n3.2. If the Identification Committee concludes that an event of wilful default has \noccurred, it shall issue a Show Ca use Notice to the concerned borrower and the \npromoter/ whole - time director and call for their submissions and after considering \ntheir submissions , issue an order recording the fact of wilful default and the \nreasons for the same. An opportunity should be g iven to the borrower and the \npromoter/ whole -time director for a personal hearing if the Committee feels such \nan opportunity is necessary.  \n3.3. The Order of the Identification Committee should be reviewed by another \nCommittee called Review Committee, headed by  the Chairman/ Chairman & \nManaging Director or the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer/ CEOs and \nconsisting, in addition, to two independent directors/ non -executive directors of the \nHFCs and the Order shall become final only after it is confirmed by the said Review \nCommittee. However, if the Identification Committee does not pass an Order \ndeclaring a borrower as a wilful defaulter, then the Review Committee need not be \nset up to review such decisions.  \n3.4. As regard a non -promoter/ non -whole time direct or, it should be kept in mind that \nSection 2(60) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines an officer who is in default to \nmean only the following categories of directors:  \n3.4.1.  Whole -time director ; \n3.4.2.  where there is no key managerial personnel, such director or directors as \nspecified by the Board in this behalf and who has or have given his or their  \n-231- \n consent in writing to the Board to such specification, or all the directors, if no \ndirector is so specifi ed;  \n3.4.3.  every director, in respect of a contravention of any of the provisions of \nCompanies Act, who is aware of such contravention by virtue of the receipt by \nhim of any proceedings of the Board or participation in such proceedings and \nwho has not objected t o the same, or where such contravention had taken \nplace with his consent or connivance.  \nTherefore, except in very rare cases, a non -whole time director should not be \nconsidered as a wilful defaulter unless it is conclusively established that:  \n(a) he/ she was  aware of the fact of wilful default by the borrower by virtue of \nany proceedings recorded in the minutes of meeting of the Board or a \nCommittee of the Board and has not recorded his objection to the same in \nthe Minutes; or,  \n(b) the wilful default had taken p lace with his consent or connivance.  \nThe above exception will however not apply to a promoter director even if not \na whole time director.  \n3.5. A similar process as detailed in Sub-paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 above should be \nfollowed when identifying a non -promoter/  non-whole -time director as a wilful \ndefaulter.  \n4. Criminal Action against Wilful Defaulters  \nHFCs are further advised  to follow  as under:  \n4.1. Monitoring End -Use of Funds  \nIn reference to Para graph  2.4 above , it is advised that HFCs should closely monitor \nthe end -use of funds and obtain certificates from borrowers certifying that the funds \nare utilised for the purpose for which they were obtained. In case of wrong \ncertification by the borrowers, HFCs may consider appropriate legal proceedings, \nincluding criminal act ion wherever necessary, against the borrowers.  \n4.2. Criminal Action by HFCs  \nIt is essential to recognise that there is scope even under the existing legislations \nto initiate criminal action against wilful defaulters depending upon the facts and \ncircumstances of  the case under the provisions of Sections 403 and 415 of the  \n-232- \n Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860. HFCs are, therefore, advised to seriously and \npromptly consider initiating criminal action against wilful defaulters or wrong \ncertification by borrowers, wherever considered necessary, based on the facts and \ncircumstances of each case under the above provisions of the IPC to comply with \nour instructions and the recommendations of JPC.  \nIt should also be ensured that the penal provisions are used effectively and \ndeter minedly but after careful consideration and due caution. Towards this end, HFCs \nare advised to put in place a transparent mechanism, with the approval of their Board, \nfor initiating criminal proceedings based on the facts of individual case.  \n5. Reporting  \n5.1. Need  for Ensuring Accuracy  \nCredit Information Companies disseminate information on non -suit filed and suit \nfiled accounts respectively of wilful defaulters, as reported to them by the HFCs \nand therefore, the responsibility for reporting correct information and  also accuracy \nof facts and figures rests with the concerned HFCs. HFCs may also ensure the \nfacts about directors, wherever possible, by cross -checking with Registrar of \nCompanies.  \n5.2. Position regarding Guarantors  \nHFCs may take due care to follow the provisio ns set out in Paragraph  3 above  in \nidentifying and reporting instances of wilful default in respect of guarantors also. \nWhile reporting such names to CICs, HFCs may include \u2018Guar\u2019 in brackets i.e. \n(Guar) against the name of the guarantor and report the sam e in the Director \ncolumn.  \n5.3. Government Undertakings  \nIn the case of Government undertakings, it should be ensured that the names of \ndirectors are not reported. Instead, a legend \u2018Government of --------  undertaking\u2019 \nshould be added.  \n5.4. Inclusion of Director Ident ification Number (DIN)  \nMinistry of Corporate Affairs had introduced the concept of a Director Identification  \nNumber (DIN) with the insertion of Sections 266A to 266G in the Companies \n(Amendment) Act, 2006. In order to ensure that directors are correctly id entified  \n-233- \n and in no case, persons whose names appear to be similar to the names of \ndirectors appearing in the list of wilful defaulters, are wrongfully denied credit \nfacilities on such grounds, HFCs have been advised to include the Director \nIdentification N umber (DIN) as one of the fields in the data submitted by them to \nCredit Information Companies.  \nIt is reiterated that while carrying out the credit appraisal, HFCs should verify as to \nwhether the names of any of the directors of the companies appear in the  list of \ndefaulters/ wilful defaulters by way of reference to DIN/ PAN etc. Further, in case \nof any doubt arising on account of identical names, HFCs should use independent \nsources for confirmation of the identity of directors rather than seeking declarati on \nfrom the borrowing company.  \n5.5. Sharing of contact details of Nodal Officers dealing with CICs  \nFor better coordination with CICs, HFCs should  forward the complete details of the \nnodal officers (name, designation, contact no., email id) to all the CICs. Furt her, \nthe details of the nodal officer with whom the CICs need to coordinate in respect \nof disputes/  complaints on data reported  should also be forwarded .   \n-234- \n Appendix X VII (a) \n(Refer Para graph  2.9 of Annex )  \nFormat for submission of data on cases of wilful de fault of  \u20b925 lakh & above (Suit \nfiled and Non -Suit filed) to all CICs on monthly or more frequent basis:  \nThe HFCs are required to submit data of wilful defaulters on FTP Platform and/or in \nCompact Disks (CDs) to all CICs on monthly or more frequent basis, using t he following \nstructure (with the same field names):  \nField  Field Name  Type  Width  Description  Remark  \n1.

No.DoS.CO.PPG./ SEC.0 5 /11.01.005 /2020 -21 dated February  03, 202 1 \n \n \nGuidelines on Risk -Based Internal Audit (RBIA) System for Select NBFCs and UCBs  \n \nRBI vide circular DBS.CO.PP.BC.10 /11.01.005/2002 -03 dated December 27, 2002 , had \nintroduced Risk-Based Internal Audit (RBIA) system in Scheduled Commercial B anks (SCBs)  \nas part of their internal control framework , which was further supplemented vide circular \nDoS.CO.PPG./SEC.04/11.01.005/2020 -21 dated January 07, 2021 . This framework  relies \nbroadly on a well-defined policy for internal audit, functional independence with sufficient \nstanding, effective channels of communication and adequate audit resources with sufficient \nprofessional competence . \n \nWhile NBFCs (Non -Banking Financial Companies) and Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks \n(UCBs) have grown in size and become systemically important, prevalence of different audit \nsystem/ approaches in such entities has created certain inconsistencies, risks and gaps. As SCBs, \nNBFCs and UCBs face  similar risk s by virtue of being  engaged in similar  financial \nintermediation activities, the ir internal audit systems also need to broadly align  while keeping \nin mind the principle of proportionality . Considering these aspects, t he Guidelines  herein \nprescribe the broad principles that should be followed by  NBFCs and UCBs  to enable them to \ngradually move  towards a n RBIA system .  \n \nA. Objective s and Scope  \n1. An effective Risk -Based Internal Audit  (RBIA) is an  audit  methodology that links an \norganisation's overall  risk management  framework and  provide s an assurance to the Board \nof Directors and the Senior Management on the quality and effectiveness of the \norganisation\u2019s internal control s, risk management and governance related systems and \nprocesses .  \n \n2 \n \n2. The internal audit function should broadly assess and contribute to the overall improvement \nof the organization\u2019s governance, risk management, and control processes using a \nsystematic  and disciplined  approach. The function is an integral part of sound corporate \ngovernance and is considered as the third line o f defen ce.  \n3. Historically, the internal audit system in NBFCs/UCBs  has generally been concentrating \non transaction testing, testing of accuracy and reliability of accounting records and financial \nreports, adherence to legal and regulatory requirements , etc. However, in the changing \nscenario , such testing by itself might not be sufficient . Therefore, SEs will have to move \ntowards a framework which will include, in addition to selective transaction testing, an \nevaluation of the risk management systems and control procedures in various areas of \noperations. This will also help in anticipating areas of potential risks and mitigating such \nrisks.   \n4. While t he Risk Management  Function should focus on identification, measurement , \nmonitoring , and management of risks, development of risk policies and procedures, use of \nrisk management models, etc ., RBIA should undertake an independent risk assessment for \nthe purpose of formulating a risk-based audit plan which considers  the inherent business \nrisks emanating from an activity / location and the effectiveness of the control systems for \nmonitoring such inherent risks . \n \nExpectations on the role s and responsibilities of different functionaries for this internal audit \nframework are provided in the following paragraphs.  \n \nB. Board of Directors  / Audit Committee of Board  \n1. The Board of Directors ( the Board)  / Audit C ommittee of Board (ACB) of NBFCs and the \nBoard of UCBs  are primarily responsible for overseeing the internal audit function  in the \norganization . The RBIA  policy shall be formulated with the approval of the Board and \ndisseminate d widely within the organization. The policy sh all clearly document the \npurpose, authority, and responsibility of the internal audit activity , with a clear demarcation \nof the role and expectations from Risk Management Function and Risk Based Internal \nAudit  Function . The policy should be consistent with the size  and nature of the business \nundertaken , the complexity of operations  and should factor  in the key attributes of internal \naudit function  relating to  independence , objectivity, professional ethics, accountability , etc. \nThe RBIA  policy must be revi ewed periodically.   \n \n3 \n \n2. The internal audit function shall be carried out  effectively so as to ensure that it adds value \nto the organization. For the purpose, the ACB/Board  shall approve a RBIA  plan to \ndetermine the priorities of the internal audit function based on the level and direction of \nrisk, as consistent with the entity \u2019s goals. The risk assessment of business and other \nfunctions of the organization sh all at the minimum be conducted on an annual basis . Every \nactivity  / location, including the risk management  and compliance  function s, shall be \nsubjected to risk assessment  by the RBIA . The policy should also lay down the maximum \ntime period beyond which even the low risk business activities  / locations would  not remain \nexcluded for audit.  \n3. The ACB/Board  is expected to review the performance of RBIA . The ACB/Board  should \nformulate and maintain a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all \naspects of the internal audit function. The quality assurance program may include \nassessment of the internal audit function  at least once in a year for adherence to the internal \naudit policy, objectives and expected outcomes. Further, ACB/Board  shall promot e the use \nof new audit tools / new technologies for reducing  the extent of manual monitoring  / \ntransaction testing  / compliance monitoring , etc.  \n \nC. Senior Management  \n1. The senior management is responsible for ensuring adherence to the internal  audit  policy \nguidelines as approved by the Board and development of an effective internal control \nfunction that identifies, measures, monitors and reports all risks faced. It shall ensure that \nappropriate action is taken on the internal audit findings within given timeline s and status \non closure of audit reports is placed before the ACB/Board . \n2. The senior management is responsible for establishing a comprehensive and independent \ninternal audit function  which  should promote a ccountability and transparency.  It shall \nensure that the RBIA  Function is adequately staffed with skilled personnel of right aptitude \nand attitude  who are  periodically trained to update their knowledge, skill and competencies.  \n3. A consolidated position  of major risks faced by the organization  shall be presented at leas t \nannually to the ACB/Board , based on inputs from all forms of audit.  \n \nD. Internal Audit Function  \nThe internal audit function should assess and make appropriate recommendations to improve \nthe governance processes on business decision making, risk management and control ; promot e  \n \n4 \n \nappropriate ethics and values within the organization ; and ensure  effective performance \nmanagement and staff accountability, etc.  \n \nThe following key -attributes ne ed to be observed:  \nI. Authority , Stature , Independence  and Resources  \nThe internal audit function must have sufficient authority, stature, independence and resources \nthereby enabling internal auditors to carry out their assignments properly . The Head of Internal \nAudit (HIA) shall be a senior executive with the ability to exe rcise independent judgement. \nThe HIA and the internal audit function aries  shall have the authority to communicate with any \nstaff member and get access to all records that are necessary to carry out the entrusted \nresponsibilities.  \nII. Competence  \nRequisite professional competence, knowledge and experience of each internal auditor is \nessential for the effectiveness of internal audit function. The areas of knowledge and experience \nmay include banking /financial entity\u2019s  operations, accounting, informa tion technology, data \nanalytics , forensic investigation, among others . The collective skill levels  should be adequate  \nto audit all areas of the SE . \nIII. Rotation of Staff  \nExcept for the entities where the internal audit function is a specialised function and managed \nby career internal auditors, the Board should prescribe a minimum period of service for staff \nin the internal audit function. The Board may also examine the fea sibility of prescribing at least \none stint of service in the internal audit function for those staff possessing specialized \nknowledge useful for the audit function, but who are posted in other areas , so as to have \nadequate skills for the staff in the internal audit function.  \nIV. Tenor for appointment of Head of Internal Audit  \nExcept for the entities where the internal audit function is a specialised function and managed \nby career internal auditors, the HIA shall be appointed for a reasonably long period, preferably \nfor a minimum of three years.  \nV. Reporting Line  \nThe HIA shall di rectly report to either  the ACB/Board / MD & CEO or to the Whole Time \nDirector (WTD) . Should the Board of Directors decide to allow the MD & CEO or a WTD to \nbe the \u2018 Reporting authority\u2019, then the \u2018 Reviewing authority\u2019 shall be the ACB/Board and the \n\u2018Accepting authority\u2019 shall be the Board in matters of performance appraisal of the HIA .  \n \n5 \n \nFurther, in such cases, the ACB/Board shall meet the HIA at least once in a quarter , without \nthe presence of the senior management  (including the MD & CEO/WTD ). The HIA shall not \nhave any reporting relationship with the business verticals of these SEs  and shall not be given \nany business targets.  \nVI. Remuneration  \nThe independence and objectivity of the internal audit function could be undermined if the \nremuneration of internal audit staff is linked to the financial performance of the business lines \nfor which they exercise audit responsibilities. Thus, the remunerat ion policies should be \nstructured in a way to avoid creating conflict of interest and compromising audit\u2019s \nindependence and objectivity.  \nVII. Responsibilities  and Other General Expectations  \n1. The internal audit function should work on the basis of established pol icies and \nprocedures  as approved by the ACB /Board .  \n2. The internal audit shall undertake an independent risk assessment for the purpose of \nformulating a risk -based audit plan. This risk assessment would cover risks at various \nlevels /areas  (corporate and branch , the portfolio and individual transactions, etc.) as \nalso the associated processes . \n3. The risk assessment in the  internal audit department should be used for focusing on the \nmaterial risk areas and prioritizing the audit  work.  \n4. The risk  assessment process should, inter alia, include identification of inherent \nbusiness risks in various activities undertaken , evaluation of the effectiveness of the \ncontrol systems for monitoring the inherent risks of the business activities ( \u2018Control \nrisk\u2019) and drawing -up a risk -matrix for  both the factors viz., inherent business risks and \ncontrol risks.  \n5. The basis for determination of the level (high, medium, low) and trend (increasing, \nstable, decreasing) of inherent business risks and control risks should be clearly spelt \nout. \n6. The risk assessment may make use of both quantitative and qualitative approaches. \nWhile the quantum of credit, market, and operational risks could largely be determined \nby quantitative assessment, the qualitative approach may be adopt ed for assessing the \nquality of overall governance and controls in various business activities.  \n7. The risk assessment methodology should include, inter alia, parameters  such as  (a) \nPrevious internal audit reports and compliance ; (b) Proposed  changes in busi ness lines  \n \n6 \n \nor change in focus ; (c) Significant change in management / key personnel ; (d) Results \nof regulatory examination report ; (e) Reports of external auditors ; (f) Industry trends \nand other environmental factors ; (g) Time elapsed since last audit ; (h) Volume of \nbusiness and complexity of activities ; (i) Substantial performance variations from the \nbudget ; and (j) Business strategy of the entity vis -\u00e0-vis the risk appetite and adequacy \nof control.  \n8. For the risk assessment to be accurate, it will be necess ary to have  proper MIS and data \nintegrity  arrangements . The internal audit function should be kept informed of all \ndevelopments such as introduction of new products, changes in reporting lines, changes \nin accounting practices  / policies , etc. The risk asse ssment should invariably be \nundertaken on a yearly basis. The assessment should also be periodically updated to \ntake into account changes in business environment, activities and work processes, etc.  \n9. Before taking up specific internal audit assignment, the plan, scope , objectives , \ntimelines and resource allocations  of the assignment should be clearly established. The \nscope and objectives of the assignment should be based on a preliminary assessment of \nthe risks relevant to the business activity under review . \n10. The SEs may prepare a Risk Audit Matrix based on the magnitude and frequency of \nrisk. The Audit Plan should prioritize audit work to give greater attention to the areas \nof: \na. High magnitude  and high frequency  \nb. High magnitude  and medium frequency  \nc. High magnitude and low frequency  \nd. Medium magnitude and high frequency  \ne. Medium magnitude  and medium frequency  \nf. Low magnitude  and high frequency.  \n11. The scope of the audit and resource allocation should be sufficient to achieve the \nobjectives of the audit assignment.  The precise scope of RBIA  must be determined by \neach SE for low, medium, high, very high and extremely high risk areas.  The scope of \ninternal audit should also include system and process audits in respect of all critical \nprocesses . The findings of such au dits should also be placed before the IT Committee  \nof the Board.  \n12. The internal audit report should be based on appropriate analys is and evaluation. It \nshould bring out  adequate , reliable, relevant and useful information to support the  \n \n7 \n \nobservations and conclusions. It should cover the  objectives, scope, and results of the \naudit assignment  and make appropriate recommendations and / or action plans .  \n13. All the pending high and medium  risk paras and persisting irregularities should be \nreported to the ACB/Board  in order to highlight key areas in which risk mitigation has \nnot been undertaken despite risk identification.  \n14. The internal audit function should have a system  to monitor compliance to the \nobservations made by internal audit.  Status of  compliance should  be an integral part of \nreporting to the ACB/Board . \n15. The internal audit function shall not be outsourced. However, where required, experts \nincluding former employe es can be hired on a contractual basis subject to the \nACB /Board  being assured that such expertise do es not exist within the audit function \nof the SE. Any conflict of interest in such matters shall be recognised and effectively \naddressed. Ownership of audit  reports in all cases shall rest with regular functionaries \nof the internal audit function.  \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/88NBFCSUCBS9C069C43CFCB494795E304AC9D23C87F.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jan 27, 2021", "info": " \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f  \ufffd\u0930\u091c\u0935\u0930\u094d  \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \n         RESERVE BANK OF INDIA  \nwww.rbi.org.in  \n \n\u0909\u092a\u092d\u094b\u0917\u0924\u093e \u093f\u0936\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923 \u0914\u0930 \u0938\u0902\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915 \u0947 \u0928\u094d\ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f , \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u095b\u0932 , \u0905\u092e\u0930 \u092d\u0935\u0928 , \u0938\u0930 \u092a\u0940\u0970 \u090f\u092e\u0970 \u0930\u094b\u0921 , \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 \u2013 400001  \nConsumer Education and Protection Department, Central Office, First Floor, Amar Building, Sir P.

PRD.Cir.No.01/13.01.013/2020- 21                               January 27, 2021  \n All Scheduled Commercial Banks  (excluding Regional Rural Banks)  \n \nMadam/Dear Sir,  \n \nStrengthening of Grievance Redress Mechanism in Banks  \n \nPlease refer to the \u2018 Statement on Developmental and Regulatory P olicies\n\u2019 issued as \npart of the Monetary Policy statement dated December 4, 2020 , wherein it was  stated \nthat with a view to strengthen and improve the efficacy of the grievance redress  \nmechanism of banks and to provide better customer service it has been decided to put \nin place a comprehensive framework comprising certain measures . \n \n2. Reserve Bank of India has taken various initiatives over the years for improving \ncustomer service and grievance redress  mechanism in banks . Detailed guidelines on \ncustomer service were  issued to banks  encompassing various aspects  of operations \nthat impact customers . The Banking Ombudsman Scheme was introduced in 1995 to \nserve as an alternate grievance redress  mechanism for  customer  complaints against \nbanks. In 2019, Reserve Bank also introduced the Complaint Management System \n(CMS), a fully automated process -flow based platform , available 24x7 for customers \nto lodge their complaints with the Banking Ombudsman (BO ). \n \n3. As part of the disclosure initiative, banks were  advised to disclose in their annual \nreports, summary  information regarding the complaints handled by them; and certain \ndisclosures were  also being made in the Annual Report of the Ombudsman Schemes \npublished by the Reserve Bank. To further strengthen grievance redress mechani sms, \nbanks were mandated to appoint an Internal Ombudsman (IO) to function as an \nindependent and objective authority at the apex of their  grievance redress  mechanism.  \n \n4.  Effective grievance redress  should be an integral part of the business  strategy of \nthe banks . It is, however, evident from the increasing number of complaints  received \nin the Offices of B anking Ombudsman (OBOs ), that greater attention by banks to this \narea is warranted. More focused attention to customer service and grievance redress  \nwill ensure satisfactory  customer outcomes and greater customer confidence.   \n 2 \n 5. In view of the above,  and to further strengthen the customer grievance redress  \nmechanism in banks, i t has been decided to put in place a comprehensive framework \ncomprising  of, inter -alia, enhanced disclosures by banks on customer complaints , \nrecovery of cost of redress  from banks for the maintainable complaints received \nagainst them in OBOs  in excess of the peer  group average, and undertaking intensive \nreview of the grievance redress  mechanism and supervisory action against banks that \nfail to improve their redress  mechanism in a time bound manner. Details of the \nframework are provided in the Annex .  \n6. The framework will come into effect from the date of the circular . \n \nYours faithfully , \n \n(Ranjana Sahajwala)  \nChief General Manager   \n3 \n Annex  \n \n \nStrengthening of Grievance Redress Mechanism in Banks  \n \nThe framework for strengthening grievance redress  mechanism in banks will have the \nfollowing major components:  \n \nI. Enhanced disclosures on complaints  \n2. Disclosures serve as an important tool for market discipline as well as for consumer \nawareness  and protection. Appropriate disclosures relating to the number and nature of \ncustomer complaints and their redress  facilitate customers  and interested market \nparticipants to better differentiate among banks to take an informed decision in availing \ntheir products and services . To ensure provision of relevant and important information in \nthis regard to bank customers and other stakeholders, the current set of disclosures made \nby the banks are being enhanced as indicated below:   \n \nDisclosures by banks  \n3. Disclosures currently made by banks regarding customer complaints and grievance \nredress  in their annual report are made in terms of Para 16.4 of the Master Circular on \n\u2018Customer Service in Banks\u2019 dated July 01, 20151. The disclosures are summary in nature \nand comprise the following:  \n         \n                                            \n1 https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9862  4 \n Current disclosures made by banks on complaints and grievance redress \n \nCustomer complaints (received by the bank )  \n    Previous year  Current year  \n(a) No. of complaints pending at the beginning \nof the year      \n(b) No. of complaints received during the year      \n(c) No. of complaints redressed during the year      \n(d) No. of complaints pending at the end of the \nyear     \n \nAwards passed by the Banking Ombudsm an \n  Previous year  Current year  \n(a) No. of unimplemented Awards at the \nbeginning of the year      \n(b) No. of Awards passed by the B anking \nOmbudsmen during the year      \n(c) No. of Awards implemented during the year      \n(d) No. of unimplemented Awards at the end of \nthe year      \n \n \n4. It has now been decided that the above disclosures will be replaced by the following \nset of granular disclosures  to be made by banks in their annual report s. These  disclosures \nare intended to provide to the customers of banks and members of public greater insight into the volume and nature of complaints received by the banks from their customers and \nthe complaints received by banks from the OBOs, as also the quality  and turnaround time \nof redress . \n    5 \n Enhanced disclosures to be made by banks on complaints and grievance redress  \n \n \nSummary information on c omplaints received by the bank from customers   \nand from the OBOs  \nSr. \nNo  Particulars  Previous \nyear   Current year  \n Complaints received by the bank from its customers  \n1.

Number of Awards unimplemented within the \nstipulated time (other than those appealed)    \n \nNote: Maintainable complaints refer to complaints on the grounds specifically mentioned in BO Scheme  2006 and \ncovered within the ambit of the Scheme.  \n \nTop five grounds of complaints received by the bank from customers  \nGrounds of \ncomplaints , \n(i.e. \ncomplaints  \nrelating to) Number of \ncomplaints \npending at \nthe \nbeginning of \nthe year  Number of \ncomplaints \nreceived \nduring the \nyear  % \nincrease/ \ndecrease \nin the \nnumber of \ncomplaints \nreceived  \nover the \nprevious \nyear Number of \ncomplaints \npending at \nthe end of \nthe year  Of 5, number of \ncomplaints pending \nbeyond 30 days  \n1 2 3 4 5 6 \n Current Year  \nGround - 1          \nGround - 2         \nGround - 3         \nGround - 4         6 \n Ground - 5         \nOthers          \nTotal       \n        Previous Year  \nGround - 1       \nGround - 2      \nGround - 3      \nGround - 4      \nGround - 5      \nOthers       \nTotal       \n \nNote: The master list for identifying the grounds of complaints is provided in Appendix 1 . \n \n \n \nII. Recovery of cost of redress of complaints from banks  \n5. At present, redress  of complaints under BO Scheme , 2006 (BOS) is cost -free for bank s \nas well as their customers . Given that the banker -customer relationship is the primary \nrelationship, the main responsibility of customer grievance redress  lies with bank s. Wi th \na view to ensure that banks discharge this  responsibility effectively,  the cost of redress  of \ncomplaints w ill be recov ered from those banks against whom the maintainable \ncomplaints2 in the OBOs exceed their peer  group average as detailed in para 7 below . \nHowever, grievance redress  under BOS for customers will continue to remain cost -free.  \n \n6. To operationalize the cost -recovery framework for banks, peer groups based on the \nasset size of banks as on March 31 of the previous year will be identified, and peer  group \naverages of maintainable complaints received in OBOs would be computed on the following three parameters:   \n\u2022 average number of maintainable complaints per branch;  \n\u2022 average number of maintainable complaints per 1,000 accounts (total of deposit \nand credit accounts) held by the bank; and \n                                            \n2 Maintainable complaints refer to complaints on the grounds specifically mentioned in BOS 2006 and are \ncovered within the ambit of the Scheme.  7 \n \u2022 average number of maintainable digital complaints per 1,000 digital transactions3  \nexecuted through the bank by its customers.  \n \n7. The cost of redressing complaints in excess of the peer group average will be \nrecovered from the banks as follows:  \n\u2022 excess in any one parameter -  30% of the cost of redressing a complaint (in the \nOBO) for the number of complaints in excess of the peer group average;  \n\u2022 excess in any two parameters - 60% of the cost of redressing a complaint for the \nnumber of complaints exceeding the peer group average in the parameter with the \nhigher excess ; \n\u2022 excess in all the three parameters \u2013  100% of the cost of redressing a complaint for \nthe number of complaints exceeding the peer group average in the parameter with \nthe highest excess.  \n8. The cost of redress to be recovered in this respect will be the average cost of handling \na complaint at the OBOs during the year.  \n \nIII. Intensive Review of Grievance Redress Mechanism  \n9. Reserve Bank will undertake,  as a part of its supervisory mechanism, annual  \nassessment s of customer service and grievance redress  in banks based on the data and \ninformation available through the C omplaint Management System,  and other sources and \ninteractions . Banks identified as having persist ing issues in grievance redress  will be  \nsubject ed to an intensive review of their  grievance redress  mechanism to better identify \nthe underlying systemic issues and initiat e corrective measures . The intensive review \nshall include, but will not be limited  to, the following areas :  \ni. Adequacy of the c ustomer service and customer grievance r edress  related \npolicies . \nii. Functioning of the Customer Service Committee of the Board.   \n                                            \n3 \u2018Digital Transaction\u2019 means a payment transaction in a seamless system effected without the need for cash at least \nin one of the two legs, if not in both. This includes transactions made through digital / electronic modes wherein both \nthe originator and the beneficiary use digital / electronic medium to send or receive money .   8 \n iii. Level of involvement of the Top Management in customer service and customer \ngrievance related issues .   \niv. Effectiveness of the grievance redress  mechanism  of banks .  \n10. Based on the review, a remedial action plan will be formulated and formally \ncommunicated to the bank s for implementation within a specific time frame.  In case no \nimprovement is observed in the grievance redress  mechanism within the prescribed \ntimelines  despite the measures  undertaken , the bank (s) will be subject ed to corrective \nactions through appropriate regulatory and supervisory measures . \n  9 \n  \nAppendix I \nStrengthening of Grievance Redress Mechanism in Banks  \n \nMaster list of grounds of complaint s to be used for disclosure on the top five \nground- wise receipt of complaints by banks under Para 4 of the Annex  \n \n \n1.

While the aforesaid G uidance Note lays out the basic approach for risk based internal \naudit functions, banks are expected to re -orient their approach, in line with the evolving best \npractices,  as a p art of their overall Governance  and Internal Control framework. Banks are \nencouraged to adopt the International Internal Audit standards, like those issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).  \n 3. To bring uniformity in approach followed by the banks , as also to align the expectations \non Internal Audit Func tion with the best practices, banks are  advised  as under:  \na) Authority , Stature and Independence  - The \ninternal audit function must have sufficient \nauthority, stature, independence and resources within the bank, thereby enabling internal \nauditors to carry out their assignments with objectivity. Accordingly, the Head of Internal  \nAudit (HIA) shall  be a senior executive of the bank who shall have the ability to exercise \nindependent judgement . The HIA as well as the internal audit function shall have the  \n \n2 \n \nauthority to communicate with any staff member and have access to all records or files that \nare necessary to carry out the entrusted responsibilities.  \nb) Competence - Requisite professional  competence , knowledge and experience of each \ninternal auditor is essential for the effectiveness of the bank's internal audit function. The desired areas of knowledge and experience may include banking operations , accounting, \ninformation technology, data analytics  and forensic investigation, among others . Banks \nshould ensure that \ninternal  audit function has  the requisite skill s to audit all areas of the \nbank. \nc) Staff Rotation  - Except for the entities where the internal audit function is a specialised \nfunction and managed by career internal auditors, the Board should prescribe a minimum \nperiod of service for staff  in the Internal Audit function. The Board may also examine the feasibility  of prescribing  at least one stint of service in the internal audit function for those \nstaff possessing  specialized knowledge  useful for the audit function, but who are posted in \nother departments, so as to have adequate skill s for the staff in the  Internal Audit function.  \nd) Tenor for appointment of Head of Internal Audit  - \nExcept for the entities where the internal \naudit function is a specialised function and managed by career internal auditors, the HIA  \nshall  be appointed for a reasonably long period, preferably for a minimum of three  years.  \ne) Reporting Line  - The HIA shall directly report to  either the Audit Committee of the Board \n(ACB)  / MD & CEO or Whole Time Director (WTD) . Should the B oard of Directors decide \nto allow the MD & CEO  or a WTD to be the \u2018reporting authority\u2019  of the HIA, then the \n\u2018reviewing authority\u2019  shall be with the ACB and the \u2018accepting authority \u2019 shall be with the \nBoard in matters of performance appraisal of the HIA . Further, i n such cases,  the ACB  shall \nmeet the HIA at least once in a quarter , without the presence of the senior management , \nincluding the MD & CEO/ WTD . The HIA shall not have any reporting relationship with \nthe business verticals of the bank and shall not be given any business targets. I n foreign \nbanks operating in India as branches, the HIA shall report to the internal audit function in \nthe controlling office  / head office.  \nf) Remuneration -  The independence and objectivity of the internal audit function could  be \nundermined if the remuneration of internal audit staff is linked to the financial performance \nof the business lines for which they exercise audit responsibilities. Thus, the remuneration \npolicies  should be structured in a way that it avoids  creating conflict of interest and \ncompromising audit\u2019s  independence and objectivity.  \n  \n \n3 \n \n4. The internal audit function shall not be outsourced. However, where required, experts , \nincluding former employees , could be hired on contractual basis subject to the ACB being \nassured that such expertise do es not exist within the audit function of the bank. Any conflict of \ninterest in such matters shall be recognised and effectively addressed. Ownership of audit \nreports in all cases shall rest with regular functionaries of the internal audit function . \n 5.

It was conceived as a key measure to improve the quality \nand accuracy of financial data systems for better risk management post the Global Financial \nCrisis.  \n2. LEI has been introduced by the Reserve Bank in a phased manner for participants in the \nover the counter ( OTC ) derivative and non-derivative markets  as also  for large corporate \nborrowers . \n3. It has now been decided to introduce the LEI system for all  payment transactions of value  \n\u20b950 crore and above undertaken by entities  (non-individuals)  using Reserve Bank -run \nCentralised  Payment Systems viz. Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National \nElectronic Funds Transfer (NEFT).  \n4. In preparation for the wider introduction of LEI across all payment transactions, member  \nbanks should:  \ni. advise  entities who undertake large value transactions ( \u20b950 crore and above) to obtain \nLEI in time, if they do not already have one;  \nii. include remitter  and beneficiary LEI information in RTGS and NEFT payment \nmessages (d etails of the identified fields in the messaging structures  of RTGS and \nNEFT for inclusion of LEI information are at Annex ); \niii. maintain record s of all transaction s of \u20b950 crore and above through RTGS and / or \nNEFT . \n  \n \n5. Entities can obtain LEI from any of the Local Operating Units (LOUs) accredited by the \nGlobal Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) , the body  tasked to support the \nimplementation and use of LEI. In India, LEI can  be obtained from Legal Entity Identifier India \nLtd. (LEIL) ( https://www.ccilindia-lei.co.in ), which is  also recognised as an issuer of LEI by the \nReserve Bank under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  \n6. These directi ons are issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and \nSettlement Systems Act , 2007 (Act 51 of 2007)  and shall be effective from April 1, 2021.  \nYours faithfully, \n \n(P Vasudevan)  \nChief General Manager  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \nAnnex \nBank Customers who must obtain LEI \ni.
