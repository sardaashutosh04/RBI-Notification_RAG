The existing instructions on the classification and valuation of the investment portfolio\nhave been reviewed to bring them in consonance with the best international practices.\n2.  During the last few years the Indian financial system, in general, has witnessed a sea change.\nFIs/Banks are now on a better footing than before in terms of capital adequacy, investment\nmanagement, income recognition, asset classification, provisioning for non-performing assets\nand other such prudential issues. At the same time, trading in the securities market has improved\nin terms of turnover and maturities dealt with. In view of these developments and taking into\nconsideration the evolving international practices, an Informal Group in the Bank has reviewed\nthe existing instructions on the classification and valuation of the investments portfolio. The\nGroup studied the international practices in accounting of investments in the light of the\ninternational accounting standards and submitted its Report in October 1999.\n3. Revised Guidelines\nThe guidelines on classification and valuation of investments by FIs have been revised on the\nbasis of the recommendations of the Informal Group so that they are in consonance with the best\ninternational practices. In supersession of our earlier circulars in regard to classification and\nvaluation of different types of investments by FIs it is advised that the revised guidelines as\ngiven in this circular may be followed.\n3.1 The highlights of the revised guidelines are given below:\u2022 The revised guidelines furnished in the Annexure will be effective from the\nhalf year ended March  31, 2001.\n\u2022 The FIs are required to classify their entire investment portfolio as on March 31,\n2001, under three categories viz. \u2018Held to Maturity\u2019,  \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 and\n\u2018Held for Trading\u2019.\n\u2022 The investments will be classified as i) Government securities ii )other approved\nsecurities iii) Shares iv) Debentures & Bonds v) Subsidiaries/ joint ventures vi)\nOthers (CP, Mutual Fund Units, etc.).\n\u2022 The investments under the Available for Sale and Held for Trading categories\nshould be marked to market as prescribed or at more frequent intervals.\n\u2022 The investments under the Held to Maturity category need not be marked to\nmarket.\n\u2022 Classification of investments, shifting of investments among the three categories,\nvaluation of the investments, methodology for booking profit/ loss on sale of\ninvestments and providing for depreciation should be in accordance with the\nguidelines in the Annexure.\n\u2022 The risk-weights assigned to the various securities at present including those for\n'market risk', would remain unchanged.\n3.2 The classification of the existing investments among the three categories may be done at\nthe book value of the respective securities as on March 31, 2001.   Subsequent valuation of the\nsecurities included under the \u2018Held for Trading\u2019 and the \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 categories may be\nrevalued as specified in the revised guidelines. The first such revaluation may be done as on\nMarch 31,  2001 for the securities under the \u2018Held for Trading\u2019 category. Securities under the\n\u2018Available for Sale\u2019 category may also be revalued as on that date if the FI proposes to revalue\nthis category at intervals more frequent than \u2018annual\u2019 intervals.\n3.3 FIs should formulate an Investment Policy with the approval of their Board of Directors to\ntake care of the requirements on classification, shifting and valuation of investments under the\nrevised guidelines. Besides, the Policy should adequately address risk-management aspects,\nensure that the procedures to be adopted by the banks under the revised guidelines are consistent,\ntransparent and well documented to facilitate easy verification by inspectors and statutory\nauditors.\nYours faithfully\n(K.C.

Such type of fraud could have been avoided if the\ntransfer procedure or registration of lien in respect of shares held as security had been\nadopted by financial institutions, irrespective of the fact whether shares were obtained\nas primary or collateral security against such advances.  In order to avoid such a\nsituation, it is advised as under :\n2. Whenever the limits of advances granted to a borrower against the security of\nshares/debentures exceed Rs.10 lakhs, it should be ensured  that the said\nshares/debentures are transferred in the FI's name.\n3. The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has amended the SEBI\n(Depositories & Participants) Regulations, 1996 to facilitate the pledge of\ndematerialised securities.  The securities pledged by the borrower get blocked in\nfavour of the lending FI.  In the case of default by the borrower, the FI may invoke the\npledge, subject to the provisions of the pledge document and on such invocation, the\ndepository will register the name of the FI as beneficial  owner of such securities.  In\nview of the above position, securities which are held in dematerialised form under the\ndepository system, the requirement that the shares/debentures should be transferred in\nFI\u2019s name need not be insisted upon provided the securities have been blocked in\nfavour of lending FI.  FIs are therefore free to take their own decision in regard to\ntransfer of securities in their name.\n4. In view of the facility provided by the depository system under the Depositories\nAct, 1996 to hold shares/debentures in dematerialised form, FIs could acceptshares/debentures held in such form in addition to those in the physical form as\nsecurity for advances to further safeguard their interests.\n5.

The\nreports on trial basis have since been received from the PDs and examined at our end.\nTaking into account the trial returns and the comments/suggestions received from the\nPDAI, certain individual PDs as also from the other related Departments of  RBI, the\nCapital Adequacy standards have, as set out here, been finalised.\n2.  The `Guidelines on Capital Adequacy Standards for Primary Dealers\u2019 are enclosed. It\nhas been decided to operationalise the revised Standards with effect from September 30,\n2000. Accordingly, the PDs should work out the capital charges on their portfolio as on\nSeptember 30, 2000 in accordance with the guidelines set out in the enclosed Note and,\nalong with a copy each of their Risk Management system and the framework for working\nout the Value at Risk, submit to us before December 30, 2000. The Primary Dealers\nshould, hence forth, submit the return on a quarterly basis i.e. as at March 31, June 30,\nSeptember 30 and December 31 before 15th of the month following the quarter. Each\nreturn should be accompanied by the Back Testing results. While the report of the\nExternal Auditors as envisaged at Para B.5 (Attachment II) may be submitted along with\nthe return as on March 31, the PDs should immediately report to us in case their Risk\nManagement system and/or the VaR framework undergoes any material change that\nwould effect the capital charges.\n3. For meeting the market risk capital charges, the Tier \u2013 III Capital has specifically been\nintroduced in accordance with international norms. The PDs may consider issuing Tier \u2013\nIII Capital for meeting the market risk capital requirements. The characteristics of the\nTier \u2013 III Capital, the instruments, tenor and terms and conditions that need to be fulfilled\nfor considering it as eligible for capital adequacy requirement are detailed in Attachment\n\u2013 I.\n4.  It may also be noted that the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision is engaged in a\ncomprehensive review/revision of the existing Capital Adequacy Accord.   The document\nis presently under consultative process among the subscribing member countries. Since\nsuch international practices are being worked out in conjunction with the IOSCO\n(International Organisation of Securities Commissions) i.e. the federation of regulatorsfor securities firms etc., the capital adequacy standards for PDs set out in the present Note\nwould be reviewed from time to time in the light of the Basle Committee/IOSCO\ndevelopments and revised as considered warranted.\n5.  Primary Dealers who are not able to work out the capital charges as per the internal\nrisk model (VaR) based method or whose VaR framework is not satisfactory, should\nmaintain minimum capital of 7 (seven) per cent on their securities portfolio, exclusively\nfor market risk i.e. in addition to the capital for credit and counter party risk.\n6.  Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(Usha Thorat)\nChief General Manager \u2013in- Charge\nEncl :\nCapital Adequacy Standards for Primary Dealers\nThe system of Primary Dealers in Government Securities Market was introduced in 1995.\nThe operations of the PDs are guided by the \u201cGuidelines to Primary Dealers in\nGovernment Securities Market\u201d. The PDs are also entities registered with RBI under the\nRBI (NBFC) Regulations. At the time of introduction of the system, besides fixing a\nminimum absolute capital requirement, the PDs were enjoined to adhere to the capital\nadequacy standards prescribed for NBFCs. Notional risk weights towards the position\nrisk on Government securities were also indicated in addition.\nThe focus of the RBI (NBFC) Regulations is on the deposit acceptance function. PDs,\nhowever, are entities engaged in securities business, predominantly in Government\nsecurities and meet their funding needs in the money markets. The major risk they face\ntherefore, is the interest rate risk. The application of capital adequacy guidelines prescribed\nfor NBFCs under RBI (NBFC) Regulations in toto to the Primary Dealers therefore\nnecessitated reconsideration. The firming up of the views in international\nfinancial/securities markets with regard to the capital towards market risk, has also speededup the introduction of focussed capital adequacy standards for PDs. In the existing\nguidelines, capital requirement for market risk is captured by stipulating different weights\nfor securities of different maturities and then making the CRAR requirement under the\nNBFC Regulations applicable. It is now felt necessary to review the system and introduce\ncapital adequacy standards for market risk in accordance with international best practices.\nThe present Note contains the capital adequacy standards to be adopted and maintained\nby the Primary Dealers.\n1.  CAPITAL FUNDS\nExplanations :\n(a) \u201cTier-I Capital\u201d would mean paid-up capital, statutory reserves and other disclosed\nfree reserves. Investment in subsidiaries where applicable, intangible assets, losses in\ncurrent accounting period and losses brought forward from previous accounting\nperiods will be deducted from the Tier I capital.\n(b) \u201cTier-II capital\u201d includes the following :-\n(i) preference shares other than those which are compulsorily convertible\ninto equity;\n(ii) revaluation reserves  at discounted rate of fifty five percent;\n(iii) general  provisions  and  loss  reserves  to the extent these are not\nattributable to actual  diminution in value or identifiable potential loss in\nany specific  asset and are available to meet unexpected losses, up to the\nextent of one and one fourth (1.25) percent of total risk weighted assets;\n(iv) hybrid debt capital instruments; and\n(v) subordinated debt\n(c) ``Tier \u2013 III Capital\u2019\u2019 is the capital issued to meet market risk capital charge in\naccordance with the criteria laid down in Attachment I\n(d) \u201csubordinated debt \u201c   means a fully paid up capital instrument, which is unsecured\nand subordinated to the claims of other creditors, is free of restrictive clauses and is\nnot redeemable at the instance of the holder or without the consent of the ReserveBank.

For capital adequacy purposes, no such netting off\nshould be done except to the extent of  the provisions indicated\nabove.\n(b)  Risk weights for off-Balance Sheet items\nThe intrinsic credit risk in respect of off-Balance Sheet  items is arrived at  in a\ntwo  stage  process. The face value of each of the off-Balance Sheet items is\nmultiplied  by  the ``credit conversion factor\u201d  as per the nature of the item, as\nindicated in the table below. This will then be multiplied  with the weights\nrelevant to the counter party to the contract  (viz., Government, bank, Financial\nInstitution  etc.) as specified for on balance sheet items above.Nature of item Credit conversion\nfactor  percentage\n i) Financial guarantees considered 100\nas credit substitutes\nii) Other guarantees 50\niii) Share/debenture/auction stock 100\nunderwriting obligations\niv) Partly-paid shares/debentures 100\nand other securities\nv) Bills discounted/rediscounted 100\nvi) Repurchase agreements (e.g. buy/sell) 100\nwhere the credit risk remains with the PD\nvii) Other contingent liabilities/ 50\ncommitments like standby facility with\noriginal maturity of over  one year\nviii) Similar contingent liabilities/ 0\ncommitments with original maturity of\nupto one year or which can be uncondi-\ntionally cancelled at any time\nNote:  Cash margins/deposits shall be deducted before applying the Conversion\nFactor.\n(bi) Interest Rate Contracts\nFor the Interest Rate related contracts, which generally are - interest rate swaps, forward\nrate agreements, basis swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate options and other contracts\nof similar nature, the methodology for capital charge calculation will be as under :\n(i)  The notional principal amount will be multiplied by the Conversion Factors\ngiven below to arrive at the Adjusted Value.\nConversion Factor\n@   0.5% of Notional Principal Value for original maturity of less than 1 year\n@   1.0% for original maturity of one year and less than two years\n@   1.0% for each additional year from two years and above(ii)  The Adjusted Value  thus obtained shall be multiplied by the Risk Weight\napplicable to the counter party as specified below:\nGovernment/any exposure 0%\nguaranteed by Government\nBanks/Financial Institutions 20%\n (as specified by DBOD)\nPrimary Dealers in the Government 100%\nSecurities market\nAll others 100%\nSection-B  : MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses in on and off \u2013 balance sheet positions arising\nfrom movements in market prices. The objective in introducing the capital adequacy for\nmarket risk is to provide an explicit capital cushion for the price risk to which the PDs are\npredominantly exposed in their portfolio.\nInternationally there are two methods for working out the capital charge for market risks\nviz : (i) the standardised model and (ii) the internal risk management based model \u2013\nsubject to fulfillment of certain conditions.\n As the risk management systems at the PDs are still evolving, it is considered\nappropriate that PDs calculate capital charges based on the standardised method as\nalso under the internal risk management framework based (VaR) model, the\nminimum parameters for which are indicated elsewhere in this Note, and maintain\nthe higher of the two requirements.\nIn case the capital charges are already being maintained as per the risk based model and\nwork out to be higher than as per the standardised method, such PDs should not scale\ndown or modify the model. Permitting maintenance of capital charges based exclusively\non the risk based model will be considered after the PDs gain sufficient experience in this\nregard.The methodology for working out the capital charges for market risk on the portfolio are\ndetailed in Annexure \u2013 1(a) (Fixed Income instruments - as per the Standardised method),\nAnnexure \u2013 1(b) (Fixed Income instruments - as per the internal risk model [VaR] based\nmethod, Annexure \u2013 2 (on Equity Positions) and Annexure \u2013 3 (on Interest Rate\nContracts).\nSection C  :  SUMMATION OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS\nThe capital adequacy requirements for the PDs will comprise\n@  the credit risk requirements as indicated in Section : A,  plus\n@  the capital charge for market risk requirements as arrived at under Section:B\nAnnexure-1(a) or (b), Annexures-2 and 3.\n? Every Primary Dealer shall maintain a minimum capital ratio consisting of Tier I and\nTier II Capital which shall not be less than fifteen per cent of its aggregate risk\nweighted assets and of risk adjusted value of off-balance sheet items.\n? The total of Tier II Capital, if any, shall not exceed one hundred per cent of Tier I\nCapital, at any point of time.\n? The total of Tier III Capital, if any, shall not exceed two hundred and fifty per cent of\nthe Tier I and Tier II Capital available for meeting market risk capital charge i.e.\nexcess over the credit and counter party risk capital requirements.\n? In working out the eligible capital, the PDs are required to first calculate their\nminimum capital requirements for credit risk and only afterwards the capital charge\ntowards market risk requirements. The total capital funds will represent the capital\navailable to meet both the credit as also the market risks.\n? The overall capital adequacy ratio will be calculated by establishing an explicit\nnumerical link between the credit risk and the market risk factors, by multiplying the\nmarket risk capital charge with 6.67 i.e. the reciprocal of the minimum credit risk\ncapital charge of  15 %. The resultant figure is added to the sum of risk weighted\nassets worked out for credit risk purpose. The numerator for calculating the overallratio will be the PD\u2019s Tier I , Tier II and the Tier III Capital after head room\ndeductions, if any.

The\ncapital charge under this method is the sum of four components :\na) the net short or long position in the whole trading book;\nb) a small proportion of the matched positions in each time-band (the  \u201c vertical\ndisallowance \u2019\u2019);\nc) a larger proportion of the matched positions across different time-bands (the\n\u201chorizontal disallowance \u2019\u2019) ;\nd) a net charge for positions in options, where appropriate\nNote  :  Since blank short selling in the cash position is not allowed, netting as indicated at\n(a) and the system of `disallowances\u2019 as at (b) and (c) above are applicable currently only\nto the PDs entering into FRAs/IRSs.\nSeparate duration ladders should be used and capital charges summed up with no\noffsetting between positions of opposite sign, in case such a situation exists.\nAfter mapping all the positions, individual net positions are to be summed within each\ntime band irrespective of whether they are long or short positions, to produce a gross\nposition figure.\nUnder the duration method, PDs with the necessary capability may, with RBI\u2019s\npermission use a more accurate method of measuring all of their general market risks by\ncalculating the price sensitivity of each position separately.  PDs must elect and use the\nmethod on a continuous basis and the system adopted will be subjected to monitoring by\nRBI.  The mechanics of this method are as follows:   -   First calculate the price sensitivity of each instrument in terms of a change in\ninterest rates of between 0.6 and 1.0 percentage points depending on the duration\nof the instrument (Table 1 );\n   - Slot the resulting sensitivity measures into a duration-based ladder with the\nthirteen time-bands set out in Table 1;\n  @ Subject the lower of the long and short positions in each time-band to a 5% capital\ncharge towards vertical disallowance designed to capture basis risk;\n  @@   Carry forward the net positions in each time-band  for horizontal offsetting\nacross the zones  subject to the disallowances set out in Table 2.\n@ / @@ : Applicable only where opposite positions exist as explained at Note\n            above.Table 1\nDuration time-bands and assumed changes in yield\nAssumed change in yield Assumed change in yield\nZone 1 Zone 3\n0 to 1month 1.00 4 to 5 years 0.85\n1 to 3 mo 1.00 5 to 7 years 0.80\n3 to 6 mo 1.00 7 to 10 years 0.75\n6 to 12 mon 1.00 10 to 15 years 0.70\n15 to 20 years 0.65\nZone 2 Over 20 years 0.60\n1to2 years 0.95\n2 to 3 years 0.90\n3 to 4 years 0.85\nTable 2\nHorizontal disallowances\nZones Time-band Within the\nzoneBetween\nadjacent zonesBetween zones\n1 and 3\n0 \u2013 month\n1 - 3 months\n3 \u2013 6 monthsZone 1\n6 \u2013 12 months40%\n1 \u2013 2 years\n2 \u2013 3 years Zone 2\n3 \u2013 4 years30%\n4 \u2013 5 years\n5 \u2013 7 years\n7 \u2013 10 years\n10 \u2013 15 years\n15 \u2013 20 yearsZone 3\nOver 20 years30%40% 100%\nThe gross  positions  in each time-band will be subject to risk weighting as per the\nassumed change in yield set out in Table 2, with no further offsets.Annexure \u2013 1(b)\nFixed Income Instruments\nInternal risk model (VaR) based method\nThe PDs should calculate the capital requirement based on their internal Value at Risk\nmodel for market risk, as per the following minimum parameters :\n(a) \"Value-at-risk\"  must be computed on a daily basis.\n(b) In calculating the value-at-risk, a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence\ninterval is to be used.\n(c) An instantaneous price shock equivalent to a 30-day movement in prices is\nto be used, i.e. the minimum \"holding period\" will be thirty trading days.\n(d) The choice of historical observation period   (sample period) for\ncalculating value-at-risk will be constrained to a minimum length of one\nyear and not less than 250 trading days.  For PDs who use a weighting\nscheme or other methods for the historical observation period, the\n\"effective\" observation period must be at least one year (that is, the\nweighted average time lag of the individual observations cannot be less\nthan 6 months).\n(e) The capital requirement will be the higher of (i) the previous day's value-\nat-risk number measured according to the above parameters specified in\nthis section and (ii) the average of the daily value-at-risk measures on each\nof the preceding sixty business days, multiplied by a multiplication factor\nprescribed by RBI (3.30 presently).\n(f) No particular type of model  is prescribed.  So long as the model used\ncaptures all the material risks run by the PDs, they will be free to use\nmodels, based for example, on variance-covariance matrices, historical\nsimulations, or Monte Carlo simulations etc.Annexure - 2\n (b) Equity positions\nThis section sets out a minimum capital standard to cover the risk of holding or taking\npositions in equities by the PDs.  It applies to long and short positions in all instruments\nthat exhibit market behavior similar to equities, but not to non-convertible preference\nshares (which will be covered by the interest rate risk requirements described in Section\nB).  Long and short positions in the same issue may be reported on a net basis.  The\ninstruments covered include equity shares, convertible securities that behave like equities,\nand commitments to buy or sell equity securities.\nAs with debt securities, the minimum capital standard for equities is expressed in terms\nof two separately calculated charges for the \u201ccredit risk\u2019\u2019 and for the \u201cgeneral market\nrisk\u2019\u2019 of holding a position in equity as indicated in Sections A and B. For the purposes of\nmarket risk, the equity holdings should be included in the duration ladder with the\nmaximum sensitivity i.e. below 1 month.Annexure - 3\nInterest rate contracts (derivatives)\nThe measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and off-balance-sheet\ninstruments in the portfolio, which react to changes in interest rates, [viz. forward rate\nagreements (FRAs), interest rate swaps (IRS)]. A summary of the rules for dealing with\ninterest rate derivatives is set out below.\nCalculation of positions\nThe derivatives should be converted into positions in the relevant underlying and become\nsubject to market risk charges as described above. The amounts reported should be the\nmarket value of the principal amount of the underlying or of the notional underlying.\nForward Rate Agreements\nThese instruments are treated as a combination of a long and a short position in a notional\nGovernment security.  The maturity of a future or a FRA will be the period until delivery\nor exercise of the contract, plus \u2013 where applicable \u2013 the life of the underlying\ninstrument.  For example, a long position in a June three-month interest rate future (taken\nin April) is to be reported as a long position in a Government security with a maturity of\nfive months and a short position in a Government security with a  maturity of two\nmonths.  Where a range of deliverable instruments may be delivered to fulfil the contract,\nthe PD has flexibility to elect which deliverable security goes into the duration ladder.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nSwaps will be treated as two notional positions in Government securities with relevant\nmaturities.  For example, an interest rate swap under which a PD is receiving floating rate\ninterest and paying fixed will be treated as a long position in a floating rate instrument of\nmaturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a\nfixed-rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the residual life of the swap.  For swaps\nthat pay or receive a fixed or floating interest rate against some other reference price, the\ninterest rate and the reference rate components should be slotted into the appropriate\nrepricing duration category, relevant for that component.Allowable offsetting of matched positions\nPDs may exclude from the interest rate maturity framework, long and short positions\n(both actual and notional) in identical instruments with exactly the same issuer, coupon,\ncurrency and maturity.  In addition, opposite positions in the same category of\ninstruments can in certain circumstances be regarded as matched and allowed to offset\nfully.  To qualify for this treatment the positions must relate to the same underlying\ninstruments, and be of the same nominal value.  In addition, for Swaps and FRAs: the\nreference rate (for floating rate positions) must be identical and the coupon closely\nmatched (i.e. within 15 basis points); and the next interest fixing date or, for fixed coupon\npositions, the residual maturity must correspond within the following limits:\n.   less than one month hence: same day;\n.   between one month and one year hence: within seven days;\n.   over one year hence: within thirty days.\nPDs with large swap books may use alternative formulae for these swaps to calculate the\npositions to be included in the duration ladder.  One method would be to first convert the\npayments required by the swap into their present values.   For that purpose, each payment\nshould be discounted using/building zero coupon yields, and a single net figure for the\npresent value of the cash flows entered into the appropriate time-band using procedures\nthat apply to zero (or low) coupon bonds; these figures should be slotted into the general\nmarket risk framework as set out earlier.  Another method would be to calculate the\nsensitivity of the net present value implied by the change in yield used in the duration\nmethod and allocate these sensitivities into the time-bands set out in Table 1 to Annexure\n\u2013 1(a).Attachment I\nCriteria for Tier \u2013 III Capital\nThe principal form of eligible capital to cover market risk consists of shareholders\u2019 and\nretained earnings (Tier I Capital) and supplementary capital (Tier II Capital) as defined in\nthe Note.  But PDs may also employ a third tier of capital (\u201cTier III\u201d), consisting of short-\nterm subordinated debt as defined in paragraph 2 below for the sole purpose of meeting a\nportion of the capital requirements for market risks, subject to the following conditions:\n? PDs will be entitled to use Tier III Capital solely to support market risks as\ndefined in Section B. This means that any capital requirement arising in respect of\ncredit and counter party risk, including the credit counter party risk in respect of\nderivatives etc. in terms of Section A (b) of the Note, need to be met by the Tier I\nand II Capital only;\n? Tier III Capital will be limited to 250% of a PD\u2019s Tier I Capital that is required to\nsupport market risks i.e. surplus after meeting the credit and counter party risk\ncapital requirements;\n? in case a  PD is having surplus Tier II Capital elements, they may be substituted\nfor Tier III up to the same limit of 250% subject to the limitations that - eligible\nTier II Capital may not exceed total Tier I Capital, and long-term subordinated\ndebt may not exceed 50% of Tier I Capital (long-term subordinated debt with a\nminimum original term to maturity of  over five years will continue to be part of\nTier II Capital);\n? the sum total of Tier II plus Tier III Capital should not exceed total Tier I Capital.\n2.   For short-term subordinated debt to be eligible as Tier III Capital, it needs, if\ncircumstances demand, to be capable of becoming part of PD\u2019s permanent capital and\nthat be available to absorb losses in the event of insolvency. It must, therefore, at a\nminimum;\n? be unsecured, subordinated and fully paid up;\n? have an original maturity of at least two years;\n? not be repayable before the agreed repayment date unless the RBI agrees;? be subject to a lock-in clause that neither interest nor principal may be paid (even\nat maturity) if such payment means that the PD falls below or remains below its\nminimum capital requirement.\n3.  In calculating eligible capital, it will be necessary first to calculate the PD\u2019s\nminimum capital requirement for credit risk, and only afterwards its market risk\nrequirement, to establish how much Tier I and Tier II Capital is available to support\nmarket risk. Tier III Capital will be regarded as eligible only if it can be used to\nsupport market risks under the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 above. Excess,\nas unused but eligible Tier III Capital, which is not at present supporting market risks,\nmay be reported separately.Attachment II\nCriteria for use of internal model to measure market risk capital charge\nA. General criteria\n1. The use of an internal model will be conditional upon the explicit approval of the\nReserve Bank.\n2. RBI will only give its approval if, at a minimum, it is satisfied that:\n- the PD's  risk management system is conceptually sound and its\nimplementation is certified by external auditors;\n- the PD has, in the RBI\u2019s view, sufficient numbers of staff skilled in the use of\nsophisticated models not only in the trading area but also in the risk control,\naudit, and back office areas;\n- the PD has, in the RBI\u2019s judgement, a proven track record of reasonable\naccuracy in measuring risk (back testing);\n- the PD  regularly conducted stress tests along the lines discussed in Para B.4\nbelow\n3. RBI has the right to insist on a period of initial monitoring of the live testing of a\nPD\u2019s internal model before it is used for capital charge purposes.\n4. In addition to these general criteria, PDs using internal models for capital\npurposes will be subject to the requirements detailed in Sections B.1 to B.5\nbelow.\nB.1 Qualitative standards\nThe extent to which PDs meet the qualitative criteria contained herein will influence the\nlevel at which the RBI will ultimately set the multiplication factor referred to in Section\nB.3 (h) below, for the PD.  Only those PDs, whose models are in full compliance with\nthe qualitative criteria, will be eligible for use of the minimum multiplication factor. The\nqualitative criteria include:\n(b) The PD should have an independent risk control unit that is responsible for the\ndesign and implementation of the system. The unit should produce and analysedaily reports on the output of the PD's risk measurement model, including  an\nevaluation of the relationship between measures of risk exposure and trading\nlimits. This unit must be independent from trading desks and should report\ndirectly to senior management of the PD.\n(c) The unit should conduct a regular back testing programme, i.e. an ex-post\ncomparison of the risk measure generated by the model against actual daily\nchanges in portfolio value over longer periods of time, as well as hypothetical\nchanges based on static positions.\n(d) Board of Directors and senior management should be actively involved in the\nrisk control process and must regard risk control as an essential aspect of the\nbusiness to which significant resources need to be devoted.  In this regard, the\ndaily reports prepared by the independent risk control unit must be reviewed\nby a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce\nboth reductions in positions taken by individual traders and reductions in the\nPD\u2019s overall risk exposure.\n(e) The PD\u2019s internal risk measurement model must be closely integrated into the\nday-to-day risk management process of the institution.  Its output should\naccordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and\ncontrolling the PD\u2019s market risk profile.\n(f) The risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with internal\ntrading and exposure limits.  In this regard, trading limits should be related to\nthe PD\u2019s risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and\nthat it is well-understood by both traders and senior management.\n(g) A routine and rigorous programme of stress testing should be in place     as a\nsupplement to the risk analysis based on the day-to-day output of the PD\u2019s risk\nmeasurement model.  The results of stress testing should be reviewed\nperiodically by senior management and should be reflected in the policies and\nlimits set by management and the Board of Directors.  Where stress tests\nreveal particular vulnerability to a given set of circumstances, prompt steps\nshould be taken to manage those risks appropriately.\n(h) PDs should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a documented\nset of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the operation of the\nrisk measurement system. The risk measurement system must be well\ndocumented, for example, through a manual that describes the basic principles\nof the risk management system and that provides an explanation of the\nempirical techniques used to measure market risk.\n(i) An independent review of the risk measurement system should be carried out\nregularly in the PD\u2019s own internal auditing process.  This review should\ninclude both the activities of the trading desks and of the risk control unit.  Areview of the overall risk management process should take place at regular\nintervals (ideally not less than once a year) and should specifically address, at\na minimum:\n- . the adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and\nprocess;\n- . the organisation of the risk control unit ;\n- . the integration of market risk measures into daily risk management;\n- . the approval process for risk pricing models and valuation systems used\nby front and back-office personnel;\n- . the validation of any significant change in the risk measurement process;\n- . the scope of market risks captured by the risk measurement model;\n- . the integrity of the management information system;\n- . the accuracy and completeness of position data;\n- . the verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data\nsources used to run internal models, including the independence of such\ndata sources;\n- . the accuracy and appropriateness  of volatility and other assumptions;\n- . the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations;\n- . the verification of the model's accuracy through frequent back testing as\ndescribed in (b) above and in the Attachment III.\n(j) The integrity and implementation of the risk management system in\naccordance with the system policies/procedures laid down by the Board of\nDirectors should be certified by the external auditors as outlined at Para B.5.\n(k) A copy of the back testing result should be furnished to RBI.\nB.2 Specification of market risk factors\nAn important part of a PD\u2019s internal market risk measurement system is the specification\nof an appropriate set of market risk factors, i.e. the market rates and prices that affect the\nvalue of the PD\u2019s trading positions.  The risk factors contained in a market risk\nmeasurement system should be sufficient to capture the risks inherent in all the PD\u2019sportfolio of on-and-off-balance sheet positions.  The following guidelines should be kept\nin view:\n(a) For interest rates, there must be a set of risk factors corresponding to interest\nrates in each portfolio in which the PD has interest-rate-sensitive on-or-off-\nbalance sheet positions.\nThe risk measurement system should model the yield curve using one of a\nnumber of generally accepted approaches, for example, by estimating forward\nrates of zero coupon yields.  The yield curve should be divided into various\nmaturity segments in order to capture variation in the volatility of rates along\nthe yield curve. For material exposures to interest rate movements in the major\ninstruments, PDs must model the yield curve using all material risk factors,\ndriven by the nature of the PD\u2019s trading strategies.  For instance, a PD with a\nportfolio of various types of securities across many points of the yield curve\nand that engages in complex arbitrage strategies, would require a greater\nnumber of risk factors to capture interest rate risk accurately.\nThe risk measurement system must incorporate separate risk factors to capture\nspread risk (e.g. between bonds and swaps), i.e. risk arising from less than\nperfectly correlated movements between Government and other fixed-income\ninstruments.\n(b) For equity prices, at a minimum, there should be a risk factor that is designed to\ncapture market-wide movements in equity prices (e.g. a market index).\nPosition in individual securities or in sector indices could be expressed in \"beta-\nequivalents\" relative to this market-wide index. More detailed approach would\nbe to have risk factors corresponding to various sectors of the equity market\n(for instance, industry sectors or cyclical and non-sectors), or the most\nextensive approach, wherein, risk factors corresponding to the volatility of\nindividual equity issues are assessed. The method could be decided by the PDs\ncorresponding to their exposure to the equity market and concentrations.\nB.3. Quantitative standards\n(a)   PDs should update their data sets  at least once every three months and\nshould also reassess them whenever market prices are subject to material\nchanges.  RBI may also require a PD to calculate their value-at-risk using a\nshorter observation period if, in it\u2019s judgement, this is justified by a\nsignificant upsurge in price volatility.\n(b) The multiplication factor will be set by RBI on the basis of the assessment\nof the quality of the PD\u2019s risk management system, as also the back testing\nframework and results, subject to an absolute minimum of 3. The document\n`Back testing\u2019 mechanism to be used  in conjunction with the internal riskbased model for market risk capital charge\u2019, enclosed as Attachment III,\npresents in detail the back testing mechanism.\nPDs will have flexibility in devising the precise nature of their models, but the parameters\nindicated at Annexure-1(b) are the minimum which the PDs need to fulfil for acceptance\nof the model for the purpose of calculating their capital charge. RBI will have the\ndiscretion to apply stricter standards.\nB.4 Stress testing\n1. PDs that use the internal models approach for meeting market risk capital\nrequirements must have in place a rigorous and comprehensive stress testing program to\nidentify events or influences that could greatly impact them.\n2.  PD\u2019s stress scenarios need to cover a range of factors than can create\nextraordinary losses or gain in trading portfolios, or make the control of risk in those\nportfolios very difficult.  These factors include low-probability events in all major types\nof risks, including the various components of market, credit and operational risks.\n3. PD\u2019s stress test should be both of a quantitative and qualitative nature,\nincorporating both market risk and liquidity aspects of market disturbances.  Quantitative\ncriteria should identify plausible stress scenarios to which PDs could be exposed.\nQualitative criteria should emphasize that two major goals of stress testing are to evaluate\nthe capacity of the PD\u2019s capital to absorb potential large losses and to identify steps the\nPD can take to reduce its risk and conserve capital.  This assessment is integral to setting\nand evaluating the PD\u2019s management strategy and the results of stress testing should be\nroutinely communicated to senior management and, periodically, to the PD\u2019s Board of\nDirectors.\n4.  PDs should combine the standard stress scenarios with stress tests developed\nby PDs themselves to reflect their specific risk characteristics.  Specifically, RBI may ask\nPDs to provide information on stress testing in three broad areas, which are discussed in\nturn below.\n(a) Scenarios requiring no simulations by the PD.\n5. PDs should have information on the largest losses experienced during the\nreporting period available for RBI\u2019s review.  This loss information could be compared to\nthe level of capital that results from a PD\u2019s internal measurement system.  For example, it\ncould provide RBI with a picture of how many days of peak day losses would have been\ncovered by a given Value-at-Risk estimate.\n(b) Scenarios requiring a simulation by the PD.6. PDs should subject their portfolios to a series of simulated stress scenarios and\nprovide RBI with the results.  These scenarios could include testing the current portfolio\nagainst past periods of significant disturbance, for example, the January 1998 volatility\nincorporating both the large price movements and the sharp reduction in liquidity\nassociated with these events.  A second type of scenario would evaluate the sensitivity of\nthe PD\u2019s market risk exposure to changes in the assumptions about volatilities and\ncorrelations.  Applying this test would require an evaluation of the historical range of\nvariation for volatilities and correlations and evaluation of the PD\u2019s current positions\nagainst the extreme values of the historical range.  Due consideration should be given to\nthe sharp variation that at times has occurred in a matter of days in periods of significant\nmarket disturbance.\n(c) Scenarios developed by the PD itself to capture the specific\ncharacteristics of its portfolio\n7. In addition to the scenarios prescribed by RBI under (a) and (b) above, a PD\nshould also develop its own stress tests which it identified as most adverse based on the\ncharacteristics of its portfolio. PDs should provide RBI with a description of the\nmethodology used to identify and carry out the scenarios, as well as with a description of\nthe results derived from these scenarios.\n8. The results should be reviewed periodically by  senior management and should\nbe reflected in the policies and limits set by management and the Board of Directors.\nMoreover, if the testing reveals particular vulnerability to a given set of circumstances,\nRBI would expect the PD to take prompt steps to manage those risks appropriately (e.g.\nby reducing the size of its exposures).\nB.5 External Validation\nPDs should get the internal model\u2019s accuracy validated by external auditors, including at\na minimum, the following:\n(a) verifying that the internal validation processes described in B.1(h) are\noperating in a satisfactory manner;\n(b) ensuring that the formulae   used in the calculation process as well as for\nthe pricing of complex instruments are validated by a qualified unit, which\nin all cases should be independent from the trading desks;\n(c) Checking that the structure  of internal models is adequate with respect to\nthe PD\u2019s activities and geographical coverage;\n(d) Checking the results of the PD\u2019s back testing of its internal measurement\nsystem (i.e. comparing Value-at-Risk estimates with actual profits and\nlosses) to ensure that the model provides a reliable measure of potential\nlosses over time. PDs should make the results as well as the underlying\ninputs to their value-at-risk calculations available to the external auditors;\n(e) Making sure that data flows and processes associated with the risk\nmeasurement system are transparent and accessible.   In particular, it isnecessary that auditors are in a position to have easy access, wherever they\njudge it necessary and under appropriate procedures, to the models\u2019\nspecifications and parameters.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. X \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nAttachment III\n\u201cBACK TESTING\u201d mechanism to be used in conjunction  with the internal risk\nbased model for market risk capital charge\nThe following are the parameters of the back testing framework for incorporating into the\ninternal models approach to market risk capital requirements.\nPrimary Dealers that have adopted an internal model-based approach to market risk\nmeasurement are required routinely to compare daily profits and losses with model-\ngenerated risk measures to gauge the quality and accuracy of the their risk measurement\nsystems.  This process is known as \"back testing\".\nThe objective of the back testing efforts is the comparison of actual trading results with\nmodel-generated risk measures. If the comparison uncovers sufficient differences,\nproblems almost certainly must exist, either with the model or with the assumptions of\nthe back test.\nII. Description of the back testing framework\nThe back testing program consists of a periodic comparison of the Primary Dealer\u2019s daily\nValue-at-Risk measures with the subsequent daily profit or loss (\u201ctrading outcome\u201d).\nThe Value-at-Risk measures are intended to be larger than all but a certain fraction of the\ntrading outcomes, where that fraction is determined by the confidence level of the Value-\nat-Risk measure.  Comparing the risk measures with the trading outcomes simply means\nthat the Primary Dealer counts the number of times that the risk measures were larger\nthan the trading outcome.  The fraction actually covered can then be compared with the\nintended level of coverage to gauge the performance of the Primary Dealer\u2019s risk model.\nUnder the Value-at-Risk framework, the risk measure is an estimate of the amount that\ncould be lost on a set of positions due to general market movements over a given holding\nperiod, measured using a specified confidence level.\nThe back tests to be applied compare whether the observed percentage of outcomes\ncovered by the risk measure is consistent with a 99% level of confidence.  That is, they\nattempt to determine if a PD\u2019s 99th percentile risk measures truly cover 99% of the firm\u2019s\ntrading outcomes.i)  Significant changes in portfolio composition relative to the initial positions are\ncommon at trading day end.  For this reason, the back testing framework suggested\ninvolves the use of risk measures calibrated to a one-day holding period.\nA more sophisticated approach would involve a detailed attribution of income by source,\nincluding fees, spreads, market movements, and intra-day trading results.\nPrimary Dealers should perform back tests based on the hypothetical changes in portfolio\nvalue that would occur were end-of-day positions to remain unchanged.\nii)  Back testing using actual daily profits and losses is also a useful exercise since it can\nuncover cases where the risk measures are not accurately capturing trading volatility in\nspite of being calculated with integrity.\nPrimary Dealers should perform back tests using both hypothetical and actual trading\noutcomes.  The steps involve calculation of the number of times that the trading\noutcomes are not covered by the risk measures (\u201cexceptions\u201d).  For example, over 200\ntrading days, a 99% daily risk measure should cover, on average, 198 of the 200 trading\noutcomes, leaving two exceptions.\nThe back testing framework to be applied entails a formal testing and accounting of\nexceptions on a quarterly basis using the most recent twelve months of date. Primary\nDealers may however base the back test on as many observations as possible.\nNevertheless, the most recent 250 trading days' observations should be used for the\npurposes of back testing. The usage of the number of exceptions as the primary reference\npoint in the back testing process is the simplicity and straightforwardness of this\napproach.\nNormally, in view of the 99% confidence level adopted, a lever of 4 exceptions in the\nobservation period of 250 days would be acceptable to consider the model as accurate.\nExceptions above this, would invite supervisory actions. Depending on the number of\nexceptions generated by the Primary Dealer\u2019s back testing model, both actual as well as\nhypothetical, RBI may initiate a dialogue regarding the Primary Dealer\u2019s model, enhance\nthe multiplication factor, may impose an increase in the capital requirement or disallow\nuse of the model as indicated above depending on the number of exceptions.\nIn case large number of exceptions are being noticed, it may be useful for the PDs to dis-\naggregate their activities into sub sectors in order to identify the large exceptions on their\nown. The reasons could be of the following categories:\nBasic integrity of the model\n1) The PD\u2019s systems simply are not capturing the risk of the positions\nthemselves (e.g. the positions of an office are being reported incorrectly).\n2) Model volatilities and/or correlations were calculated incorrectly (e.g. the\ncomputer is dividing by 250 when it should be dividing by 225).Model\u2019s accuracy could be improved\n3) The risk measurement model is not assessing the risk of some instruments\nwith sufficient precision (e.g. too few maturity buckets or an omitted\nspread).\nBad luck or markets moved in fashion unanticipated by the model\n4) Random chance (a very low probability event).\n5) Markets moved by more than the model predicted was likely (i.e. volatility\nwas significantly higher than expected).\n6) Markets did not move together as expected (i.e. correlations were\nsignificantly different than what was assumed by the model).\nIntra-day trading\n7) There was a large (and money-losing) change in the PD\u2019s positions or\nsome other income event between the end of the first day (when the risk estimate\nwas calculated) and the end of the second day (when trading results were\ntabulated).", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/29622.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Dec 09, 2000", "info": "Remittance towards Schemes  involving money circulation\nA.P.

There are various\nfactors that can be identified as being responsible for causing sickness. These can be broadly\ncategorized into internal and external factors. The internal factors include a) technical causes\nsuch as obsolete technology and non-availability of skilled labour, b )financial causes such as\npoor resource management, diversion of funds and deficiency of working capital and other\nfunds, and c) managerial causes such as lack of entrepreneurship lack of professionalism and\nmarketing problems. The external factors include a )economic  causes such as high cost of inputs,\nuneconomic size of the project, over estimation of demand and high break even point, and, b)\nsocio-political causes such as government controls and its fiscal policies such as taxation and\nnon-payment of subsidies and incentives in time, and, lack of physical and social infrastructure.\n2.0.Industrial sickness is an inherent part of the process of development. However, concerted\nefforts are to be initiated by the Govt and other concerned agencies for timely detection of\nsickness at its incipient stage. There is need for a body of experts to expeditiously determine thepreventive, ameliorative and remedial  measures that need to be put into force for the\nrehabilitation of viable sick industrial units, and, enforce the measures considered appropriate for\nthe rehabilitation. At the same time, it needs to take active measures for expeditious winding up\nof non-viable sick industrial units.\n3.0.To facilitate the revival of viable sick industrial units as also the winding-up of non- viable\nsick units, Government of India have set up a statutory board viz. Board for Industrial and\nFinancial Reconstrution (BIFR) under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act,\n1985. Small Scale Industries do not, however, come under the purview of BIFR. Government of\nGujarat had, therefore, introduced a Scheme for rehabilitation of SSI and non-BIFR sick\nindustries vide Government of Gujarat IM&ED Resolution No. SIU-1091/3224-CH dated 20th\nJune 1991. The Scheme has been in operation for nearly seven years. As the impact of the\nScheme in tackling the problem of sickness in the SSI sector was not found satisfactory, the State\nGovernment have reviewed the Scheme and decided to modify it suitably for effective\nrehabilitaion of Small Scale and non-BIFR Sick Industries.\n4.0.In a meeting with the bankers held on 22nd May 98 by Hon. Chief Minister, the issue of\nrevival and rehabilitation of the SSI units was discussed in detail. The bankers unanimously\nagreed about the imperative need to initiate proactive measures in this direction and assured the\nState of their total commitment in view the RBI guidelines. Two important decisions that were\narrived at in this meeting were :\na) A State level body would be set up on the lines of BIFR and the bankers agreed to comply\nwith its recommendations regarding financial sacrifices for the rehabilitation of the sick unit.\nb) RBI also expressed its commitment to comply with the recommendations of this state level\nbody for effective revival of non -BIFR viable sick industrial units.\nFurther, the Hon. Minister, Industries held a series of consultative meetings with the members of\ntrade and industry and experts in the field to understand the reasons for sickness and policy that\nneeds to be adopted for addressing these concerns. Accordingly, the State Government has\ndecided to approve the following Scheme in supercession of IM&ED Resolution No.SIU-1091/\n3224-CH dated 20th June 1991.\n5.0 Title : This Scheme shall be known as \u201cScheme for Rehabilitation of Small Scale and\nnon-BIFR Sick Viable Industries\u201d .\ni) Operative Period :  This Scheme shall come into operation with effect from the date of issuse\nof this order.\nii) Applicability of the Scheme :  The Scheme shall be applicable only to Small Scale industrial\nunits/ancillary units in the manufacturing sector whose total investment in  plant and machinery\nexceeds Rs. 5 lacs.

Calculation of credit requirements of Khadi Institutions\nIn our circular No.PLNFS.BC.10/ C.464(A) Spl.KVIC-91/92 dated 17 July 1991, it was indicated\nthat the KVIC assesses the credit requirements of its implementing agencies after taking into\naccount various relevant aspects including the assistance provided by the Commission itself, and,\nas such, it should be possible for the banks to be guided by the assessment of the KVIC. While\nthere is no change in the methodology of assessment of the working capital adopted by KVIC\nand the banks, the following measures should be taken to enable the khadi institutions to raise\nadequate working capital.\ni) Along with the Interest Subsidy Eligibility Certificate, KVIC will furnish the work sheet\nindicating the details of assessment of working capital requirements of the units.\nii) KVIC s assessment may be accepted if it does not exceed the assessment made by the banks\nby more than 10%.\niii) In case the KVIC s assessment of working capital exceeds the bank s assessment by more\nthan 10%, the quantum of working capital may be arrived at by mutual dialogue between the\ninstitutions/KVIC and the financing banks.\niv) In case of sharp differences between the peak level and lean season credit requirements,\nadditional credit limits may be sanctioned by the banks; KVIC will indicate such peak level\ncredit requirements also in the Interest Subsidy Eligibility Certificates.\nB. In view of the fact that the KVI sector is playing an important role in creating employment\nopportunities for poor people in rural areas, it has been decided to do away with the limits\nprescribed in our circular RPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.84/06.06.12/93-94 dated 7 January 1994, in\nregard to population, credit requirement and investment in plant and machinery for  classifying\nthe advance under the priority sector.

No.2(2)/1/95-IF.II\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE\nDepartment of Economic Affairs\n(Banking Division)  \"Jeevan Deep\"\nParliament Street, New Delhi\nMarch 21, 1995\nDear Ms. Vaz,\nWhile presenting the Central Government s Budget for 1995-96 the Finance Minister has\nannounced the following with regard to improving the flow of credit to the SSI Sector.\nPara 18 :  Adequate availability of credit from the banking system is critical for the small scale\nsector. The Government, in consultation with banks, has formulated a Seven Point Action Plan\nfor improving the flow of credit to this sector. A key feature of the Plan is the setting up of\nsepcialized bank branches to serve the needs of small scale units in 85 identified districts, eachwith more than 2,000 registered small scale units. The public sector banks will ensure that 100\nsuch dedicated branches are operational before the end of 1995-96.\nThe 7 Point Action Plan consists of the following :\ni) The customer service in specialised SSI branches is generally much better as compared to\nservices provided by normal branches, timebound action needs to be taken by banks for setting\nup of specialised SSI branches in 85 identified districts each with more than 2000 registered SSI\nunits. These branches should have adequate infrastructure and be manned by officials having the\nnecessary background and skills and possessing the right attitude. These branches should\ngenerally be headed by Chief Managers. For this purpose, banks should be empowered to create\nadditional posts of Chief Managers, if necessary, with the approval of their respective Boards.\nii) With a view to facilities timely sanction of adequate credit facilities to SSI it is essential that\nbranch managers are vested with sufficient discretionary powers so that most of the credit\ndecisions are taken at the branch or the regional level itself. For this purpose banks should\nreview the existing delegation of powers at the branch and regional levels.\niii) The banks should undertake sample surveys of their  performing  SSI accounts with a view to\nfind out whether they are getting adequate credit.\niv) Steps should be taken to ensure that as far as possible composite lending (covering both term\nloans for fixed assets and working capital facility simultaneously) are sanctioned by commercial\nbanks to SSI entrepreneurs. In case of loans sanctioned by State Financial Corporations, banks\nshould appraise projects jointly or simultaneously with SFCs.\nv) Banks should have regular meetings at zonal and regional levels with the SSIs entrepreneurs\nin order to understand their problems and provide them counselling and guidance.\nvi) There is a need to sensitise bank managers and increase their awareness regarding working of\nthe SSI sector. The problem faced by SSI sector in regard to bank finance to a large extent could\nbe solved if branch level officials have the right attitude, skills and orientation. In understanding\ntheir role the branch level officials should be made aware of the importance of the SSI sector\nfrom the point of view of creation of additional employment opportunities, exports, etc. A\nhealthy growth of this sector will facilitate the smooth loan recovery in the SSI borrowal\naccounts. Further, timely assistance will prevent these accounts from becoming sticky. The\naforesaid aspects should therefore from part of the inputs in training imparted to bank staff.\nvii) The banks should also take steps to review the procedural formalities (including\ncumbersome and lengthy application forms) with a view to ensuring that procedures are\nsimplified and are reduced to a minimum in the case of SSI entrepreneurs.\nWe shall be grateful if necessary directions to banks are issued on the Action Plan announced by\nthe Finance Minister. The implementation of the Action Plan would need to be monitored by the\nBoard of Directors of each public sector bank. RBI may also kindly evolve a system to review\nthe progress periodically under the Plan.\nWith regards, Yours Sincerely,\nSd/-\n(P. BOLINA)\nMs. I. T.

At\npresent 836 items are reserved for this sector. Of late, Ministry of Industry, Government of India\nhave been receiving complaints about the violation of the policy of reservation by the medium\nand large scale undertakings. These complaints mainly pertain to the manufacture of consumer\ngoods like bread, biscuits, tooth-paste, tooth-powder, ice-cream etc. A number of Parliamentary\nQuestions regarding violation of this policy have also been received by the Government.\n2. The basic conditions of reservation policy and the circumstances under which medium/large\nscale undertakings can manufacture reserved items as advised by the Government of India, are\ngiven in the Annexure. As a measure of check, we advise that while accepting the loan proposals\nfor medium and large industries, please ensure that these units do not violate the reservation\npolicy. A copy of your advice to your controlling offices/branches may please be sent to us for\nour information.\n3. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(A. M. KHAN)\nJoint Chief Officer\nANNEXURE\nBASIC CONDITIONS OF RESERVATION POLICY AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES\nUNDER WHICH MEDIUM/LARGE SCALE UNDERTAKINGS CAN MANUFACTURE\nRESERVED ITEMS\nThe present policy of encouraging growth of small industries because of their inherent\nadvantages like labour intensity and adaptability to semi-urban and rural environment is based on\nseveral promotional measures, one of which is reservation of industries for exclusive\nmanufacture in the small scale sector. This policy was initiated in 1967 with 47 items in the list.\nSince then there have been additions to and deletions from the list including change in\nnomenclature. As on date, 836 items are reserved for exclusive manufacture in the small scale\nsector. The industries (Development and Regulation) Act was amended in March  84\nempowering the Government to reserve items for small scale sector with statutory backing. With\na view to determine the nature of any article or class of article that may be reserved for\nproduction by the small scale or ancillary industrial undertakings, Government has constituted an\nAdvisory Committee on Reservation in March, 1984.\n2. Circumstances under which medium/large scale units can manufacture reserved items\ni) Where existing medium/large industrial undertakings are manufacturing reserved items, they\nhave to obtain a Carry-on-Business (COB) licence to continue manufacture such reserved items.\nThe capacity in the COB licence is, however, pegged at the best production level achieved by\nsuch undertakings in the three years preceding the date of reservation of the item.\nii) When small scale industrial undertakings graduate into medium/large scale undertakings, such\nundertakings have also to obtain a COB licence to enable them to continue manufacturing of\nreserved items. In such cases also, their capacity is pegged with respect to the date on which it\nbecame incumbent on the undertaking to apply for and obtain a COB licence.\niii) In case large industrial undertakings wish to take up manufacture of items reserved for smallscale sector their applications can be considered if they undertake an export obligation of a\nminimum of 75% of new or additional production to be achieved within a maximum period of\nthree years.\niv) Where an industrial licence has already been issued to medium/large scale undertakings to\nmanufacture items prior to the date of reservation, such undertakings can continue to\nmanufacture the reserved items upto the licensed capacity endorsed on the licences.\n3. Marketing of Reserved items by medium/large scale units. Marketing of products reserved for\nexclusive manufacture in the small scale sector by large scale units does not constitute violation\nof the reservation policy.\nRPCD.PLNFS.BC.No.165/06.03.01/94-95\n6 June, 1995 16\nJyestha 1915 (Saka)\nAll Commercial Banks\nDear Sir,\nScheme for Financing Primary Weavers\nCo-operative Societies by Commercial Banks\nIn his budget speech on March 15, 1995 the Finance Minister referred to the proposal to extend\nconcessional refinance from NABARD to the Primary Weavers  Co-operative Societies (PWCs)\nthrough the commercial banks, besides the present system of routing the same through the\ncooperative banks. In para 14(k) of Governor s circular No.CPC.BC.144/07.01.279/94-95 dated\nApril 17, 1995 while announcing the scheme it was indicated that operating instructions are\nbeing issued separately.\n2. In pursuance of the above, we give below the outline of the modalities for financing PWCs by\ncommercial banks :\ni)Coverage\nRefinance by NABARD to commercial banks will be available for financing the Primary\nWeavers  Co-operative Societies for production-cum-marketing activities.\nii) Selection of Primary Weavers  Co-operative Societies\nThe list of societies to be financed by the commercial banks will be identified by the Directorate\nof Handlooms in each of the States with the approval of the concerned Registrars of Co-\noperative Societies. At the district level, a committee will be constituted consisting of\nrepresentatives of NABARD, District Central Co-operative Bank and Lead Bank who will\nscrutinise and approve the list of societies. The extension of finance by commercial banks will be\non the basis of their respective Service Area obligations. The implementation of the Scheme will\nbe monitored by the District Level Consultative Committee (DLCC).\niii) Criteria for Selection\na) The scheme of financing PWCS for their production and marketing activities will be confined\nto areas where District Central Co-operative Banks are weak and have not been able to provide\nadequate credit support to such societies.\nb) The societies to be financed will be required to have a satisfactory working record, reasonable\nlevel of financial strength and managerial efficiency together with the capacity to provide margin\nfor their borrowings.\nc) The societies should be viable or potentially viable and should have paid managers.\nd) The audit classification of the society should be atleast  B .\ne) The societies should not be indebted to the DCCB.iv) Norms for financing\nThe norms for financing on the basis of cash credit against hypothecation of stocks will be\nsimilar to those prescribed for the financing by the co-operative banks.\nv) Margin\nThe commercial banks may maintain a margin of 10 per cent for their lendings.\nvi) Interest Rate on Refinance/Advances\nThe scheme could be operated under the condition that the State Government provides a subsidy\nof 2.5 per cent. Where such a subsidy is available, NABARD will make available a line of credit\nto commercial banks at 9.5 per cent per annum and the commercial banks will onland to\nhandloom co-operatives at the same rate i.e. 9.5 per cent.\nvii) Refinance\nRefinance may be drawn by the commercial banks from NABARD through their designated\nbranches on a quarterly basis as in the case of co-operative banks. Each drawal from the limit\nwill be allowed for a period of 12 months and the commercial banks will have to maintain non-\noverdue cover in respect thereof.\nviii) The advances made by commercial banks to handloom co-operatives will be reckoned as\nindirect finance to the small scale industries (SSI) sector and form part of their priority sector\nlendings.\n3. We are advising NABARD to forward to you detailed instructions including the refinance\nfacility available.\n4. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(A. M.

It is estimated that there are about 38.9\nlakh handlooms in the country. However, of the total number of full-time weavers only 20 per\ncent have been brought under the fold of co-operatives. With a view to increasing the coverage\nof weavers under the co-operative fold to 50 per cent and provide continuous employment to\nthem the Government of India has recently launched an ambitious programme of setting up of\n3000 Handloom Development Centres and 500 modern dyeing units in various States during the\nVIII Five Year Plan. This indicates that there will be growing demand for institutional credit\nfrom the handloom sector.\n2. Commercial banks, ordinarily cover the non-members of the weavers  co-operative societies\nwho work individually or under master weavers and extend finance mainly for purchase of loom,\nconstruction of workshed and for meeting the working capital requirements. Commercial banks\nare also assisting handloom weavers through poverty alleviation and employment generation\nschemes like IRDP, DRI, SUME, etc.3. The Rajya Sabha has set up a Committee on petitions praying for improvement in the living\nconditions of the handloom weavers and for protection and promotion of handloom industry. The\nCommittee had discussions with the representatives of State Governments, NABARD and banks\non financing the handloom weavers during their visit to Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu\nand Uttar Pradesh. Thereafter on 28 February 1995 the Committee had oral evidence of the\nFinance Secretary, Government of India on this subject. During the evidence, the Committee had\nmentioned about the plight of weavers  community in the above States and felt that the credit\nsupport for the banking system did not reach them to the desired extent. It was, therefore,\nsuggested in the meeting to impress upon the commercial banks to ensure that adequate financial\nassistance is provided to the individual weavers. In the areas where there was concentration of\nweavers, banks should make special efforts to cover them.\n4. As regards primary weavers  co-operative societies, the commercial banks have so far not\nfinanced their production-cum-marketing activities. Recently we have taken a decision to allow\nthe commercial banks also to provide working capital requirements to the primary weavers  co-\noperative societies and a detailed circular No.RPCD.PLNFS.BC.No.165/06.03.01/94-95 dated 6\nJune 1995 on the subject has already been issued.\n5.In view of the foregoing, we shall be glad if you will please take suitable action to increase the\nflow of credit to the individual weavers as also identify the PWCS for extending necessary credit\nsupport at the earliest. For this purpose please ensure that the programme finalised by the\nhandloom sector gets dovetailed in the Annual Action Plan in each district and the progress of\nimplementation of the Annual Action Plan is regularly monitored at the district level meetings\nwhere the representatives of handloom sector also participate.\n6.

We now find from the data received from banks that 136 specialised\nbranches have been operationalised in these districts by 31 March 1996 and 33 specialised\nbranches in other districts. As these branches have been in existence for some time now, it is\nnecessary to assess their performance with regard to their lendings to SSI units.

Needless to emphasise that these specialised branches should be staffed by senior\nofficials having requisite delegated powers and sensitising them to deal with the problems of the\nsector with empathy.\n3. A list of branches proposed to be operationlised by your bank indicating the location (place,\ndistrict and state) and the probable time by which the branch will be operationalised, may please\nbe sent to us within a period of one month.4.

This arrangement envisages provision of a line of credit of Rs.1000 crore by a\nconsortium of banks. The rate of interest applicable to the line of credit has been linked to the\naverage prime lending rates of five major banks in the consortium.\n2. In this connection banks are advised that apart from lending by way of the consortium\narrangement, they may also extend credit facilities directly, on merits, to KVI units approaching\nthem at the stipulated rates of interest. A reference is invited in this connection to our circular\nRPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.16/06.06.12/94-95 dated 28 July 1994 wherein the measures to be taken\non the basis of the Kalia Committee recommendations, have been mentioned. As indicated\ntherein, banks are requested to keep in view, while assessing the working capital requirements of\nthe Khadi institutions/KVI units, the following aspects so as to enable the khadi institutions to\nraise adequate working capital.\ni) Along with the proposal for working capital requirements. KVIC/KVI units will furnish the\nwork sheet indicating the details of assessment of working capital requirements of the units.ii) KVIC s assessment may be accepted if it does not exceed the assessment made by the banks\nby more than 10%.\niii) In case the KVIC s assessment of working capital exceeds the bank s assessment by more\nthan 10%, the quantum of working capital may be arrived at by mutual dialogue between the\ninstitutions/KVIC and the financing banks.\niv) In case of sharp differences between the peak level and lean season credit requirements,\nadditional credit limits may be sanctioned by banks; KVIC will indicate such peak level credit\nrequirements also in the credit proposals.\n3.

It is equally necessary that decisions taken are\ncommunicated to the SSI units promptly.\niv) The specialised SSI branches set up by banks need to be equipped with appropriate personnel\nhaving adequate discretionary powers to sanction credit. Attention need to be bestowed on\naspects such as attitudinal change in the mindset of staff, training etc. with a view to bring about\nperceptible improvement in the functioning of the specialised branches.\nv) Grievances redressal machinery at the controlling offices should be reactivated.

While banks have increased the flow of credit to SSI\nsector during the recent period, the gap between the requirements of working capital and the\nlimits granted is increasing. In order to improve the position, you are advised to ensure\nadherance to the simplified procedure of providing working capital limits on the basis of a\nminimum of 20 per cent of the projected annual turnover for new as well as existing units,\nhaving working capital limits upto Rs.2 crores from the banking system. We may add that there\nshould not be any arbitrary denials of/reductions in limits sanctioned.\n2. We also advise you to operationalise more specialised branches at centres where there is\npotential for financing many SSI borrowers. Banks are also advised to equip such branches with\nadequate skilled and experienced personnel so that the problems of SSI units are considered\nsympathetically. Please let us know as soon as possible, say before 30 September 1997, your\nprogramme for operationalising more specialised branches during the year and the names of such\ncentres.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-(R. M. JOSHI)\nGeneral Manager\nRPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.64/06.04.01/97-98\n30 December, 1997\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\nDear Sir,\nRehabilitation of Sick Small Scale Industrial Units\nPlease refer to our Circular RPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.90/06.04.01/95-96 dated 13 February 1998\nregarding parameters for the grant of reliefs/concessions by banks as per the packages involved\nfor rehabilitation of potentially viable sick small scale industrial units.\n2. It has been observed from the data relating to SSI sick units as at the end of March 1996 that\nout of 2,62,376 sick SSI units with outstanding bank credit of Rs.3721.94 crores, 2,40,168 units\nwith outstanding amount of Rs.2943.65 crores were classified as non-viable.\nIn the SSI sector, particularly among the tiny and decentralised sector as well as those assisted\nunder schemes like SEEUY, a number of units financed by banks, are no longer in existence or\nare not traceable and/or have no assets left, etc. We wonder whether such units have also been\nincluded in the above data reported by banks. We shall be glad if you will please ensure to treat\nsuch units as a category distinct from sick SSI units and report separately, as per extant\ninstructions.\n3. As you are aware, Reserve Bank has been placing emphasis on a systematic approach to the\ndetection of symptoms leading to sickness and ensure that sickness is arrested at the incipient\nstage itself. The branch officials and other functionaries at field level should be alert in\nmonitoring day-today operations in the borrowal accounts so as to facilitate identification of the\nearly warning signals and initiate corrective steps promptly. Such steps may include providing\ntimely financial assistance depending on established needs, sorting out difficulties which are\nnon-financial in nature and require assistance from outside agencies, etc. Banks should take a\nsympathetic attitude and strive for rehabilitation, in respect of units in the SSI sector, particularly\nwherever the sickness is on account of circumstances beyond the control of entrepreneurs. Since\nSSI financing is part of priority sector lending, every possible effort should be made to see that\nSSI sector thrives on healthy lines. The emphasis of the rehabilitation effort in the case of SSI\nunits, will, therefore have to be on adequate and timely intensive relief measures and their\nspeedy application rather than giving a long span of time to the units for rehabilitation. In cases\nof units which are not capable of revival, banks should try for a settlement and/or to resort to\nother recovery measures, very expeditiously.\n4. You may issue suitable instructions to the concerned officials of controlling offices and\nbranches so as to ensure that prompt and adequate measures are taken in rehabilitating all viable\nsick SSI units so that number of non-viable sick SSI units become minimal.\nYou are also requested to review the existing position of sick SSI units in your bank and take\nurgent remedial steps to complete the viability studies of the units expeditiously.\n5.

You may\naccordingly reckon the bank advances to SSI units for the purpose of classification under the\npriority sector.\n3. In order to ensure that credit is available to all segments of the SSI sector, it has been decided\nthat out of the funds available to SSI sector under priority sector advances, banks should ensure\nthat 40% will be made available for units with investment in plant and machinery upto Rs.5\nlakhs, 20% for units with investment between Rs.5 lakhs and Rs.25 lakhs and the remaining 40%\nfor other SSI units.\n4.

In the context of changes in the structure of lending rates of banks, it is considered necessary\nto revise the parameters on interest rates for various facilities under rehabilitation packages. It is\nalso considered preferable to prescribe rates which will be fixed percentage points below the\nprevailing fixed/minimum lending rates, wherever applicable, for banks so as to obviate the need\nfor change in the parameters, whenever there is a revision in lending rates on advances.\nAccordingly, it has been decided to revise the parameters on interest rates and promoters\ncontribution in respect of sick SSI units under rehabilitation packages as under :\ni) Working Capital\nInterest on working capital may be charged at a rate 1.5 per cent below the prevailing fixed/\nminimum lending rate, wherever applicable.\nii) Funded Interest Term Loan (FITL)\nNo interest may be charged on funded interest.\niii) Working Capital Term Loan (WCTL)\nInterest on working capital term loan may be charged at a rate between 1.5 per cent and 3 percent below the prevailing fixed/minimum lending rate wherever applicable.\niv) Existing Term Loan\nInterest on existing term loan may be reduced where considered necessary by not more than 3\nper cent in the case of tiny/decentralised sector units and by not more than 2 per cent in other\ncases, below the document rate.\nv) Contingency Loan Assistance\nInterest on the contingency loan assistance may be charged at the concessional rate allowed for\nworking capital assistance.\nvi) Fresh Rehabilitation Term Loan (RTL) - (Funds for start-up expenses)\nInterest on fresh rehabilitation term loan may be charged at a rate 1.5 per cent below the\nprevailing fixed/minimum lending rate wherever applicable or as prescribed by\nSIDBI/NABARD, where refinance assistance is obtained from it for the purpose.\n3. All interest rate concessions would be subject to annual review, depending on the performance\nof the units.\n4. The revised parameters on interest rates will be applicable only to the packages which are yet\nto be prepared. In all other cases, such as where the packages sanctioned are under\nimplementation, packages sanctioned but yet to be implemented and the draft packages finalised\nfor final approval, the interest rates as committed in the packages may continue, subject to\nannual review.\n5. Promoter s Contribution\nPromoters  contribution towards the rehabilitation assistance may be fixed at a minimum of 10\nper cent of the additional long term requirements under the package in the case of tiny sector\nunits and at 20 per cent of such requirements for other units. In the case of units in the\ndecentralised sector, promoters  contribution may not be insisted upon, as hitherto, for\nrehabilitation. It is, however, open to banks and financial institutions to stipulate a higher\npromoters  contribution where warranted. At least 50 per cent of the above promoters\ncontribution should be brought in immediately and the balance within six months. For arriving at\npromoters  contribution, the monetary value of the sacrifices from banks, financial institutions\nand Government may be taken into account, in addition to the long term requirement of funds\nunder the rehabilitation package. While evolving packages, it should be made a precondition that\nthe promoters should bring in their contribution within the stipulated time frame.\n6.

In this connection it is clarified that SSSBEs can be\nregistered in any part of the country, without any locational restriction (including\ncities/metropolitan areas) and are eligible for the same benefits/concessions that are admissible to\nsmall scale industries, provided they satisfy the above investment criteria.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(S. JOHN)\nJoint Chief Officer\nRPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.99/06.02.31/92-93\nApril 17, 1993\nChaitra 27, 1915\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\nDear Sir,\nReport of the Committee to examine the adequacy of\ninstitutional credit to the SSI Sector and related aspects\nPlease refer to the circular No.CPC.BC.129/07.01.279/92-93 dated 7 April 1993 addressed by\nour Governor to all scheduled commercial banks. As mentioned therein, considering the\ncontribution of the SSI sector to overall industrial production, exports and employment and also\nrecognising the need to give a fillip to this sector, a special package of measures has been\ndevised to ensure adequate and timely credit to this sector. While doing so, the recommendations\nof the  Committee to Examine the Adequacy of Institutional Credit to the Small Scale Industries\nSector and Related Aspects  headed by Shri P. R. Nayak and other factors have been taken into\naccount. The salient features of the package are set out below:\n2. Examination of bank finance profile of working capital to the small scale sector by the\nCommittee has revealed that this sector as a whole received a level of working capital which was\nonly 8.1 per cent of its output. The village industries and the smaller tiny industries among them\ncould get working capital finance to the extent of only about 2.7 per cent of their output. Banks\nare, therefore, advised to give preference to village industries, tiny industries and other small\nscale units in that order, while meeting the credit requirements of the small scale sector.\n3. At present norms for inventory and receivables are applicable to all units enjoying aggregatefund-based working capital credit limits of Rs.10 lakhs and above from the banking system.\nUnits enjoying limits of Rs.10 lakhs and above but upto Rs.50 lakhs are subject to the first\nmethod of lending, as recommended by the Tandon Committee, for assessment of their\nMaximum Permissible Bank Finance (MPBF). It has been decided that henceforth for the credit\nrequirements of village industries, tiny industries and other SSI units having aggregate fund-\nbased working capital credit limits upto Rs.50 lakhs from the banking system, the norms for\ninventory and receivables as also the First Method of Lending will not apply. Instead such units\nmay be provided working capial limits computed on the basis of a minimum of 20 per cent of\ntheir projected annual turnover for new as well as existing units. The banks may satisfy\nthemselves about the reasonableness of the projected annual turnover of the applicants on the\nbasis of annual statements of accounts or any other documents such as returns filed with sales-\ntax/revenue authorities and also ensure that the estimated growth during the year is realistic.\nThese SSI units would be required to bring in 5 per cent of their annual turnover as margin\nmoney. In other words, 25 per cent of the output value should be computed as working capital\nrequirement of which atleast four-fifths should be provided by the banking sector, the balance\none-fifth representing the borrower s contribution towards margin for the working capital. In\ncases where output exceeds the projections or where the initial assessment of working capital is\nfound inadequate, suitable enhancement in the working capital limits should be considered by the\ncompetent authority as and when this is deemed necessary. Drawals against the limits should be\nallowed against the usual safeguards so as to ensure that the same are used for the purpose\nintended. Banks will have to ensure regular and timely submission of monthly statements of\nstocks, receivables, etc. and also periodical verification of such statements vis-a-vis physical\nstocks. Other SSI units having aggregate fund-based working capital limits of above Rs.50 lakhs\nwould, however, continue to be governed by the existing guidelines on lending norms, method of\nlending, etc.\n4. The banks should step up the credit flow to meet the legitimate requirements of the SSI sector\nin full during the Eighth Five year Plan. For this purpose the banks should draw up annual credit\nbudget for the SSI sector on a bottom-up basis. Each branch of the bank should prepare an\nannual budget in respect of working capital requirements at all SSIs before the commencement\nof the year. Such budgeting should cover (a) functioning (healthy) units which already have\nborrowing limits with the branch (b) new units and units whose proposals are under appraisal\nand (c) sick units under nursing and also sick units found viable and for which rehabilitation\nprogrammes are under preparation. To the extent possible, the budget may be prepared after\ndiscussions/feedback received from the borrowing units. The budget should take into account,\namong other relevant aspects, normal sales growth, price rise during the past year, anticipated\nspurt in business etc. The budget of each branch should be sent through the Regional/Zonal\nOffice to the Head Office of the bank for consolidation and earmarking of the funds for SSI\nfinancing.\n5. Reserve Bank of India had issued a set of guidelines in February 1987, which laid down, inter\nalia, the definition of a sick SSI unit, viability of a sick SSI unit and the extent of\nreliefs/concessions which could be granted by commercial banks as part of the rehabilitation\npackage. The definition of sick SSI unit and the extent of concessions which could be extended\nwere subsequently modified vide our circular letters RPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.122/SIU.20/88-89\nand PLNFS.BC.1/SIU.20/92-93 dated 8 June 1989 and 1 July 1992, respectively. In the light of\nthe recommendations of the Committee, it has been decided to further modify the definition of a\nsick SSI unit and the rate of interest applicable for Working Capital Term Loan (WCTL) grantedas a part of the rehabilitation package as follows :\na) Definition of sick SSI units\nAn SSI unit may be classified as sick when;\ni) any of its borrowal accounts has become a  doubtful  advance i.e. principal or interest in\nrespect of any of its borrowal accounts has remained overdue for a period exceeding 2\u00bd years,\nand\nii) there is erosion in the net worth due to accumulated cash losses to the extent of 50 per cent or\nmore of its peak net worth during the preceding two accounting years.\nb) Interest on WCTL\nIn respect of WCTL the rate of interest applicable may be 1.5 to 3.0 percentage points below the\nprevailing fixed rate/minimum lending rate, wherever applicable, but not more than the lowest\nlending rate for tiny/decentralised sector units and not more than 5 percentage points below the\nminimum lending rate in the case of advances of over Rs.2 lakhs (i.e. the highest lending rate)\nfor the other SSI units.\n6. An effective grievance redressal machinery within each bank which can be approached by the\nSSI in case of difficulties has to be set up. Separate instructions in this regard will follow.\n7. It is desirable that a single financing agency meets both the requirement of the working capital\nand term credit for small scale units. The  Single Window Scheme  (SWS) of SIDBI enables the\nsame agency-SFC or commercial bank - as the case may be, to provide term loans and working\ncapital to SSI units having a project outlay upto Rs.20 lakhs and working capital requirement\nupto Rs.10 lakhs. The banks are advised to adopt this approach.\n8. Procedure and time frame laid down for disposal of loan applications received form SSI\nborrowers, vide our circular letter RPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.6/PS.72/88 dated 30 July 1988, should\nbe strictly enforced.\n9. The decision on the other recommendations of the Committee will be conveyed in due course.\nMeanwhile, you may take necessary action in regard to the above and keep us apprised of action\ntaken in the matter.\n10. Please acknolwedge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(R. K. JALAN)\nChief Officer\nRPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.1/06.02.31/92-93\nJuly 3, 1993\nAashadha 12, 1915 (Saka)\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\nDear Sir,\nReport of the Committee to examine the adequacy of the\ninstitutional credit to the SSI sector and related aspects\nPlease refer to our circular RPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.99/06.02.31/92-93 dated 17 April 1993 on the\ncaptioned subject. The decisions taken on some of the other recommendations of the Nayak\nCommittee on small scale industries sector are set out below :\n2. RBI have issued, from time to time, guidelines to banks in the matter of financing the working\ncapital requirements of small scale units, rehabilitation of sick small scale units, co-ordination\nbetween commercial banks and State Financial Corporations (SFCs) in meeting the creditrequirements of these units and other related aspects. There are, however, several representations\nfrom the industry that banks do not always follow these guidelines. A sample study conducted by\nthe Reserve Bank had also revealed that the compliance by banks at the field level with these\nguidelines was deficient in certain respects. Banks should therefore, take immediate steps to\nensure full adherence in letter and spirit by all their branches and controlling offices to the RBI\nguidelines. Further, with a view to ascertaining the position regarding implementation of these\nguidelines by the branches, banks themselves should carry out special studies on an annual basis\non as large a sample of branches as possible. The findings of these study should be reported to us\nperiodically indicating, among others, the steps taken for rectifying the deficiencies, if any,\nobserved in the process.\n3. We have reiterated in our circular dated 17 April 1993 referred to above that the procedure and\ntime frame laid down for disposal of loan applications received from SSI borrowers should be\nstrictly enforced. In this context, we advise that whenever application for fresh\nlimits/enhancement of existing limits was not considered favourably by the sanctioning official\nor where the limits applied for are proposed to be curtailed, the same should be referred to the\nnext higher authority with all relevant particulars, to ensure scrutiny by an independent authority\nand the latter should confirm the decision of the sanctioning official or otherwise dispose of the\nsame, within a time-bound manner. Another alternative which would also help eliminate delays\ninherent in the consideration of the proposals by the successive tiers in the heirachy and facilitate\ntimely decisions on credit proposals would be for banks to adopt a system of Committee\napproach, in which decisions are taken by the competent authority after a structured discussions\nwith the branch manager and also the authorities at the intervening levels. This system would\nsave considerable time and avoidable correspondence between the various authorities.\n4. Problems faced by the SSI sector in regard to bank finance, to a large extent, could be solved\nif the branch level officials have the right aptitude, skills and orientation. In understanding their\nrole the branch managers/officials at the branches should be made aware of the importance of\nsmall scale sector from the point of view of creation of additional employment opportunities,\nexports, etc. A healthy growth of the sector will facilitate smooth loan recovery in the SSI\nborrowal accounts. Further, timely assistance will prevent these accounts from becoming sticky.\nThe aforesaid aspects should, therefore, form part of the inputs in the training imparted to the\nbanks  staff. There should be an interaction between the banks  staff and the SSI borrowers as\npart of the training programmes. Banks may also consider awarding trophies to branches for\noutstanding performance in financing SSI units as a mark of public recognition.\n5. One of the complaints frequently voiced by the SSI units pertains to insistence by some banks\non compulsory deposit mobilisation as a  quid pro quo  for the sanction of credit facilities to the\nunits. While enlisting the co-operation of banks  customers for deposit mobilisation cannot be\nfaulted, insisting on deposit mobilisation of stipulated amounts as a precondition to the sanction\nof credit or otherwise has no justification. You may, therefore, issue appropriate instructions to\nyour controlling offices/branches to desist from such practices.\n6. The second All India Census of SSI (1988) carried out by the Development Commissioner\n(SSI), Government of India has revealed that there were 85 districts in the country each with\nmore than 2000 registered SSI units (units registered with the Industries Department of the State\nGovernments) and another 110 districts each having between 1000 and 2000 registered SSI units.\nA list containing the names of these 204 district is enclosed for your information. It has been\ndecided that while State Financial Corporations (SFCs) would act as the principal financing\nagency for SSIs in 40 out of the 85 districts referred to above, to take care of both term loan andworking capital requirements of all new SSI units which can be financed under the Single\nWindow Scheme (SWS) of SIDBI, commercial banks should act as the principal financing\nagency under the SWS in the remaining 45 districts as well as in the rest of the country. The\nprocess of allocating 40 districts to SFCs to act as principal financing agency is in progress and\nthe names of the districts so allocated to SFCs will be furnished to you in due course. It has also\nbeen decided that in order to effectively discharge their responsibility commercial banks should\nopen specialised branches to cater to the SSI clientele in the 45 districts where they will be acting\nas the principal financing agency as also in the 119 districts each having between 1000 and 2000\nregistered SSI units. Banks should also consider converting such of the branches as have a fairly\nlarge number of SSI borrowal accounts into sepcialised branches. However, pending allocation\nof districts to SFCs to act as principal financing agency, the process of opening specialised\nbranches in the 119 districts referred to above should be initiated on a priority basis. The\nconcerned lead bank in the district would identify banks, depending upon the number of SSI\nborrowal accounts serviced by them for opening of specialised branches and keeping in view the\nguidelines issued by RBI in this regard vide Circular DBOD.No.BL.BC.132/22.01.001/92 dated\n20 May 1992.\n7. In our circular RPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.48/SIU.20-87 dated 6 February 1987, we have\nenumerated the steps to be taken by banks for arresting the sickness among SSI units at the\nincipient stage itself. RBI has since issued revised instructions to banks on the system of assets\nclassification inter alia, classifying the advances of banks into four categories viz. Standard, Sub-\nstandard, Doubtful and Loss. When any advance to an SSI unit has to be rated down from\nStandard to Sub-standard  category the concerned bank branch should go on alert and make a full\nenquiry into the financial health of the unit, its operations, etc. and report its findings to higher\nauthorities. Such reports should pin-point the factors which have led to default and also indicate\nwhether there are signs of incipient sickness in the unit. The progress of the unit should be kept\nunder close watch and wherever necessary additional finance should be provided if such a course\nis warranted. As soon as the advance comes under the category  doubtful  the position relating to\nall the advances granted to the concerned unit should be reveiwed and the unit classified as sick\nif it satisfies the condition relating to the erosion in net worth. Viability studies/nursing\nprogrammes should be taken up within 3 months and 6 months, respectively from the\nidentification of the unit as sick. In all matters relating to decisions on viability of a sick SSI unit\nthere should be a proper system within the banks for review of such decisions on an appeal made\nby the aggrieved unit.\n8. In order to tackle the problem of sickness among the SSI units expeditiously, RBI had advised\nbanks in para 4 of circular DBOD.No.CAS.BC.133/C.446(SIU)-76 dated 26 November 1976\n(copy enclosed) that they should set up cells at important regional centres also; besides the cell at\nHead Office to deal with sick industrial units and provide expert staff, including technical\npersonnel to look into the technical aspects. We shall be glad if you will please take expeditious\nsteps to set up separate cells at all your controlling offices, if not already done, to tackle the\nproblems of sickness among the small scale units.\n9. The decision on the remaining recommendations of the Committee will be conveyed in due\ncourse. In the meantime, you may take necessary action in regard to the above and keep us\napprised of action taken in the matter.\n10. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-(R. K. JALAN)\nChief Officer Encls : 7\nEnclosure\nREF.No.DBOD.CAS.BC.133/C.446(SIU)-76\nNovember 26, 1976\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\nDear Sir,\nSick Industrial Undertaking\nPlease refer to our circular letter No.DBOD.CAS.BC.71/C.446(SIU)-76 dated the 29th June\n1976, advising the banks, inter alia, to keep us informed of the progress made in identifying the\nsick units, etc., as also furnish us with the names of such units enjoying total credit limits of Rs.1\ncrore or more from the banking system.\n2. In order to enable us to have a broad idea of the extent of sickness in different industries, the\nreasons for sickness, present position and the task involved in rehabilitation, we shall be glad if\nyou will please furnish us information, in duplicate, as in the proforma enclosed, in respect of all\nsick units grouped industrywise every calender quarter, so as to reach us within 15 days from the\nclose of the quarter. The data for the quarter ended 30th September 1976 should reach us by 15th\nDecember 1976.\nFor the above purpose, a unit may be considered as  sick  if it has incurred cash loss for one year\nand, in the judgement of the bank, is likely to continue to incur cash losses for the current year as\nwell as the following year and which has an imbalance in its financial structure, such as current\nratio of less than 1:1 and worsening debt equity ratio (total outside liabilities to net worth). Such\nunits would invariably have a working capital term loan which they are not in a position to repay.\nThese units will require a comprehensive rehabilitation programme and intensive care over a\nperiod and should be distinguished from those units which merely indicate incipient sickness\ncalling for a close watch and preventive remedial action on the part of the banks. The units to be\nincluded in the statement as per enclosed proforma are those which are already sick and not those\nwhich show signs of incipient sickness.\n3. Whatever may be the reasons for sickness in an industrial unit, the symptoms of sickness get\nreflected in the financial indicators. The banks should, therefore, make every effort to ensure that\nthe information system, introduced, on the recommendations of RBI Study Group, is utilised to\nmonitor the performance of the borrowing units. They should also obtain half-yearly pro-forma\nbalance sheet and profit and loss account from the borrowers, within two months from the end of\nthe half-year, and gear themselves up to take quick remedial action, wherever necessary. For this\npurpose, we invite your attention to the guidelines, issued by us in terms of our circular letter\nDBOD.No.CAS.(COD)83/ 27C-76 dated the 14th July 1976, for focussing the attention of the\noperating staff on the major aspects which should not be missed while scrutinising the\nannual/quarterly statements. Any adverse trend noticed, which would be an alarm signal, may be\nsubjected to a deeper study.\n4. To tackle the problem expeditiously, it may be necessary for banks to set up cells at important\nregional centres also, besides the cell at the Head Office and provide expert staff, including\ntechnical personnel to look into technical aspects. May be that in many cases remedial action\nrequired to be taken by the banks would not be confined only to financial controls, but also\nextend to improving/ changing the borrowers management and removing deficiencies of  various\ntypes in the arrangements for purchase, production marketing etc.5. In all cases of sick units, the banks should assess the situation and come to an early decision\nabout the desirability of rehabilitating them. The discussions with the concerned parties,\nobtaining the feasibility reports etc., should not take long and a target date should be fixed, as\ntime is of the essence. What the banks should specifically bear in mind is that they should plan a\ntimeframe, of say about two months, within which they should come up with necessary proposals\nfor assistance, once the viability is established. In cases the term-lending institutions are also\ninvolved, there should be close co-ordination between banks and such institutions for exchanging\ninformation and views in not only determining the viability but also in drawing up the nursing\nprogramme and monitoring the performance. If the proposal involves additional financial\nassistance and the borrower is covered by our Credit Authorisation Scheme, the banks should\nobtain our authorisation under the Scheme, furnishing full details about the rehabilitation\nproposal.\n6. We need hardly emphasise that identifying units which have already become sick and those\nwhich are likely to become sick is of the utmost importance not only from the point of view of\nthe financial banks but also the national economy. Of equal importance is the need for quick\nnursing programme where a sick unit has potential viability and for preventive remedial action\nwhere a unit shows signs of incipient sickness. The banks are, therefore, requested to take up this\ntask in right earnest in a spirit of urgency.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(A. K.

However, it is learnt that many banks  branches are not providing the working capital\ncredit limits to the SSIs based on this formula and they continue to observe their earlier\nprocedure in this regard. You are therefore requested to look into this and advise all such\nbranches not observing these norms immediately to ensure that the SSIs whose credit limit in\nindividual cases does not exceed Rs.1 crore are sanctioned working capital limits based on the\nnew formula and that they do not suffer for want of credit from the banks.\n2. Further the banks were advised to open the special SSI branches or convert those branches\nwhich have a fairly large number of SSI borrowal accounts into the specialised branches vide\nRPCD circular No.RPCD.PLNFS.BC.1/06.02.13/92-93 dated 3 July 1993.

The question of financing of marketing expenses of SSI units\nhas been re-examined by us. It has been decided as below:\ni) Normal marketing expenses should be included in the cost of finished goods/value of\nreceivables and therefore be taken into account while arriving at the working capital\nrequirements of the units. ii) At the time of appraisal of a new project, banks as well as term\nlending institutions should invariably take into account the marketing expenditure as an item of\nproject cost. (In this connection a copy of IDBI s circular No.6763/DFID.REF.1 dated 2 March\n1987 is enclosed for information vide Annexure II). iii) Normally if existing units go in for a new\nproduct which involves heavy marketing expenses, it will be in the nature of a separate project\nand the financing of such an expansion/diversification activity should be considered on the basis\nof the usual norms. If existing units have to incur large special expenditure towards marketing of\ntheir existing products and such expenditure cannot be written off to the profit and loss account\nin that year, it may have to be treated as deferred revenue expenditure recoverable over a\nreasonable period during which the benefits of such expenditure will be reaped. The bank should\nsanction appropriate amount of assistance for the purpose in such cases. The financing bank may\nconsider such request on merits, taking into account various factors like working of the unit,\nmarket potential, reasonableness of the expenditure, security and repayment period.\n2.

Certain issues have been raised bythe banks in the context of these guidelines. These have been examined by us and the following\nmodifications have been made:\na) Definition of sick SSI units\ni) The definition of sick SSI unit has been modified as under :-\n\u201cA small scale industrial unit should be considered as sick if it has, at the end of any accounting\nyear, accumulated losses equal to or exceeding 50% of its peak net worth in the immediately\npreceding five accounting years.\u201d\nIn the case of the tiny/ decentralised sector also a unit may be considered as sick if it satisfies the\nabove definition. However, in the case of such units, if it is difficult to get financial particulars, a\nunit may be considered as sick if it defaults continuously for a period of one year, in the payment\nof interest or installments of principal and there are persistent irregularities in the operation of its\ncredit limit with the bank.\nii) In the SSI sector, particularly among the tiny and decentralised sector as well as those assisted\nunder schemes like SEEUY, a number of units, financed by the banks, are no longer in existence\nor are not traceable and/or have no assets left, etc. It has been decided to treat such units as a\ncategory distinct from sick SSI units and collect data thereof separately. Necessary instructions\nare being issued in this regard separately.\niii) The above definition [vide item ( i)] may be adopted for the purpose of reporting data from\nthe half-year ending September 1989, while for the purpose of identifying sick units/formulating\nnursing programme, banks should go by this definition with immediate effect. However, cases of\nSSI units identified as sick and already put under nursing programmes on the basis of the\nprevious definition, need not be reopened.\nb) Period upto which concessions can be granted to a unit where there is more than one\npackage\nThere have been instances where within a year or two after commencement of implementation of\nthe package, it had become necessary to work out a fresh package. A question has been raised as\nto whether, in such cases, the period of five years for grant of concessions/determining viability\nshould be reckoned from the date of original package or from the date of the revised package. It\nhas been decided that for the purpose of extending reliefs and concessions/determining viability,\nthe period of five years should be reckoned with reference to the date of implementation of the\noriginal package only. In cases, however, where there is a change of management as a part of a\nfresh package, the period may be reckoned with reference to the date of the fresh package.\nc) Funding of interest - Need for uniform approach\nIn item (v) of Annexure II to our circular dated 6 February 1987 referred to above, it has been\nspecified that future cash losses incurred in the initial stages of the rehabilitation programme till\nthe unit reaches break-even level, should be financed as indicated therein. The following further\nclarifications are issued in this regard:\ni) Future cash losses in this context will refer to losses from the time to implementation of the\npackage up to the point of cash break-even as projected.\nii) Future cash losses as above, should be worked out before interest (i.e., after excluding\ninterest) on working capital etc., due to the banks and should be financed by the financial\ninstitutions if it is one of the financiers of the unit. In other words, the financial institutions\nshould not be asked to provide for interest due to the banks in the computation of future cash\nlosses and this should be taken care of by future cash accruals.\nThe interest due to the bank should be funded by it separately. Where, however, a commercial\nbank alone is the financier, the future cash losses including interest will be financed by it. Theinterest on the funded amounts of cash losses/interest will be at the rates prescribed by Industrial\nDevelopment Bank of India under its scheme for rehabilitation assistance as indicated in our\ncircular of 6 February 1987 ibid.\niii) It has been observed that although a uniform date for the purpose of segregation of interest\nfor funding is required to be followed both by banks and financial institutions in accordance with\nthe instruction issued by the Reserve Bank of India, i.e., the first date of the accounting year\nfrom which the unit started incurring cash losses continuously, there is no uniformity in this\nregard in actual practice. In several cases, units have paid interest to banks and financial\ninstitutions for varying periods. Thus, although the banks may be funding the entire interest\ndebited to the account after the above date, the financial institutions may not be doing the same\nas they might have received some payments towards interest relating to a period after the above\ndate. In order to ensure uniformity, it has been decided that the institutions should refund the\ninterest received by them after the above date by suitably increasing the amounts of interest\nfunded by them so as to cover the entire interest for the period the units has incurred cash losses\ncontinuously.\n2.

This implies that this industry cannot be set up even in the\nsmall scale sector without obtaining a licence from the Government under the Industries\n(Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. However, an industrial undertaking has been defined\nunder the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 as any industrial undertaking\npertaining to a Scheduled Industry carried out in one or more factories. The word  factory  has\nbeen defined as any premises including the percents thereof, in any part of which a\nmanufacturing process is being carried out or is ordinarily so carried on.\ni) With the aid of power, provided that fifty or more workers are working or were working\nthereon on any day of the preceding twelve months;\nor\nii) Without the aid of power, provided that one hundred or more workers are working or were\nworking thereon on any day of the preceding twelve months and provided further that in no part\nof such premises any manufacturing process is being carried on with the aid of power.\nIn other words, units which carry on manufacturing process with the aid of power and with less\nthan 50 workers or without the aid of power and with less than 100 workers are not coveredunder the definition of  industrial undertaking  under the Industries (Development and\nRegulation) Act, 1951. It has come to the notice of the Government that a number of units in the\nsmall scale sector are being set up in this industry. The units being so set up are not covered\nunder the definition of  industrial undertaking  as defined in the Industries (Development and\nRegulation) Act and are, therefore, outside the purview of the licensing provisions of the Act.\nSince a very large capacity in the re-rolling industry has already been created which is totally\ndisproportionate to the current and estimated future demand for the products, Government of\nIndia have decided that assistance from banks and financial institutions should not be made\navailable to new units which are outside the purview of the Industries (Development and\nRegulation) Act and are being set up in small scale sector.\n4.

In view of\nthe importance of uncontaminated blood products being available in adequate quantity,\nGovernment have advised that the affected units should be enabled to recommence production\nwith the safeguards specified by experts through the recommended manufacturing processes. The\nunits would require, urgently, fresh working capital as also term loan for installing additional\nequipments etc.\n2. As this is a special set of circumstances, the blood products manufacturing units need urgent\nattention from the banks to tide over the difficulty. Banks are, therefore, advised to take action as\nindicated below :\ni)Request from the affected SSI units for converting the irregular portion of the working\ncapital into a term loan should be considered sympathetically. As the operation of the accounts of\nthese units is expected to be regular otherwise, the question of unadjusted interest or penal\ninterest is not likely to arise. Hence, the working capital converted into working capital term loan\nmay be repaid in 7 years. In the case of SSI units, the rate of interest on such working capital\nterm loan may be reduced by not more than 2 percentage points below the prescribed rate for\nterm loan, the reduced rate in no case being less than the rate of interest charged on loans under\nIRDP. A reference is invited in this connection, to item (iii) of Annexure-II to our circular\nRPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.48/SIU.20-87 dated 6 February 1987. Where the affected unit comes\nunder the non-SSI category i.e., if it is a medium/large scale industrial unit, the rate of interest onsuch working capital term loan may be fixed suitably between 13\u00bd per cent to 15 per cent per\nannum. A longer period of repayment for the working capital term loan not exceeding 10 years\nin any case, may be considered for both SSI and non-SSI units, subject to the condition that the\nconcessionality in interest as stated above will be withdrawn after the seventh year. Reference\nmay please be made in this regard to paragraph 4 of circular IECD.No.IRD.BC.132/SIU-A-85\ndated 5 November 1985 issued by our Industrial & Export Credit Department.\nii) As regards security for the working capital term loan banks may, in individual cases, approach\nthe financial institutions concerned holding first charge on fixed assets for ceding a pari passu\ncharge in their favour in respect of the working capital term loan in confirmity  with the practice\nfollowed by financial institutions and banks in such cases.\niii) Fresh term loans, where necessary, are to be granted without delay to enable the units to\ninstall equipments for changing the manufacturing process to comply with the new directions\nfrom the health/drug control authority. In such cases, the banks should be guided by the\ninstructions contained in our circular IECD.No.PMS.207/C.446(C&P )087/88 dated 29 June\n1988.\n3. It may please be noted that the above instructions will be applicable only to those units\nengaged in manufacturing of blood products which have been affected by the Government s\ndecision to destroy stocks contaminated with AIDS virus and not to other units which might have\nbecome sick/ weak due to other causes.\n4.

KHOPKAR)\nAssistant Chief OfficerRPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.69/SIU.20-90/91\n8 January, 1991\n18 Pausa, 1912\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\nDear Sir,\nRehabilitation of sick Small Scale Industrial Units\nPlease refer to our circular letter RPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.48/SIU.20-87 dated 6 February 1987\nprescribing certain broad parameters for grant of reliefs or concessions by banks as part of the\npackages evolved for the rehabilitation of potentially viable sick units in the Small Scale\nIndustries (SSI) sector. The banks were advised that cases of rehabilitation packages envisaging\nconcessions in interest rates beyond those specified therein should be referred to us for approval.\n2. The above parameters were evolved so as to have uniformity of approach among banks in the\nmatter of reliefs/concessions, to help in expediting the finalisation of rehabilitation packages and\nto ensure that excessive concessions are not extended in the name of rehabilitation. As adequate\ntime has elapsed since the issue of the aforesaid instructions it is felt that banks would have\nacquired considerable experience in all aspects relating to grant of concessions and reliefs for\nrehabilitation of sick SSI units. In the light of the above it has been decided to withdraw with\nimmediate effect, the present system of prior approval by the Reserve Bank for extending\nreliefs/concessions beyond the prescribed parameters.\n3. In this connection, it is relevant to take note of the viability of a sick SSI unit and the\nrehabilitation of such a unit would depend primarily on the unit s ability to continue to service its\nrepayment obligations including the past restructured debts. It is, therefore, essential to ensure\nthat ordinarily there is no write-off or scaling down of debt such as by reduction in rate of\ninterest with retrospective effect except to the extent indicated in our guidelines. Such a step as\nwell as concessions/ reliefs beyond the parameters indicated in our guidelines should be\nconsidered only in exceptional cases where such a course of action is deemed absolutely\nnecessary e.g., ( i) good export potential for the products manufactured by the unit; (ii) where\nthere is established demand for the products; (iii) the cost of setting up a similar new unit will be\ndisproportionately high as compared to the cost of revival of the unit; (iv) substantial\nrelief/assistance is provided by the Central and/or State Governments and sacrifices are made by\nthe labour for the revival of the unit. The involvement of the promoters particularly in infusing\nfresh funds for revival of the unit should also be considered in deciding the extent of\nreliefs/concessions to be offered by the bank. In all such cases banks should invariably\nincorporate a  right of recompense  clause in the sanction letter and other documentation. All\nsuch cases involving concessions/ reliefs beyond those stipulated in our guidelines should be put\nup to the bank s Board for sanction.\n4. While prior approval of the Reserve Bank for individual package involving reliefs/concessions\nbeyond parameters has been dispensed with, we would continue to monitor all such cases. For\nthis purpose, banks should furnish to us information on a half-year basis, for the periods ending\nSeptember and March every year, in the format enclosed. The statements showing particulars of\nindividual packages approved during the half-year should be furnished to us within one month\nfrom the close of the half-year to which it relates. The first such statement should be for the half-\nyear ending 31 March, 1991.\n5. As already advised in our circular dated 6 February 1987 referred to above, efforts to\nrehabilitate sick units in the SSI sector have to reckon with the relative weakness of such units towithstand difficulties. Hence, the emphasis of the rehabilitation effort in the case of SSI unit will\nhave to be on adequate relief measures and their speedy application. Banks should take all\nnecessary steps to adhere to strict time discipline in dealing with various aspects of rehabilitation\nof sick SSI units. Ordinarily it should be possible to take a decision on the viability or otherwise\nof a unit identified as sick, within a period of 3 months. The finalisation of the nursing\nprogramme should be completed within a period of 3 months from the date of such decision.\nAssistance from other agencies/ Government Department may be necessary in areas like raw\nmaterial supply, power, marketing, etc. for undertaking the nursing programme in some cases;\nthere may also be cases needing co- ordinated action by the financial institutions and the banks\nconcerned. All such cases should be decided either by convening meetings of the representative\nof the various agencies/institutions concerned; alternatively, such cases should be referred to the\nState Level Inter Institutional Committee without delay. A reference may please be made in this\ncontext to the instructions contained in para 4 of our circular\nRPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.72A/SIU.28/89-90 dated 30 December 1989.\n6.

The Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) had been representing to us\nthat despite issue of guidelines by Reserve Bank, some of the problems still persisted and the\nimplementing agencies of KVIC/ KVIBs continued to face difficulties in obtaining adequate bank\ncredit for KVI programmes. A meeting was, therefore, held under the Chairmanship of our\nDeputy Governor ( Shri A. Ghosh) on 10 May, 1991 with the Chairman of KVIC, and\nrepresentatives of SIDBI, NABARD and some of the commercial banks, to discuss the relativeissues. In the light of the deliberation and the consensus arrived at in the said meeting, it has been\ndecided that banks should take action on the lines indicated below :-\ni)Sanction of credit limits\nIn our circular dated 12 July, 1988, ibid, it was indicated that KVIC assesses the credit\nrequirements of its implementing agencies after taking into account various relevant aspects\nincluding the assistance provided by the Commission itself and, as such, it should be feasible for\nbanks to be generally guided by the assessment of the KVIC. Some of the banks had, however,\nexpressed difficulties in accepting the requests of the units for sanction of credit limits as per the\ninterest subsidy eligibility certificates  issued by KVIC since they were not supported by detailed\nassessment made by the KVIC and the amounts indicated were not in conformity with the banks\nprescribed norms. The KVIC has now agreed that a  worksheet  showing the detailed credit\nassessment made by it would be attached to the interest subsidy eligibility certificate while\nsubmitting the loan proposals to the banks. Wherever banks have difficulty in sanctioning the\nfull amount of credit indicated by KVIC, the concerned bank should initiate a dialogue with the\napplicant as well as the KVIC so that the differences could be resolved through discussion. In\nthis connection, NABARD has proposed to organise a few workshops for familiarising KVIC\nofficials with the methodology adopted by banks for assessment of credit requirements so that\nthe divergence could be eliminated.\nii) Delay in sanction of loans by banks\nIn our circular letter dated 12 July, 1988 referred to above, we have advised banks that credit\nproposals received from the State Khadi and Village Industry Boards ( KVIBs) and other\nassociates/ implementing agencies of KVIC should be disposed of within 8-9 weeks in any case.\nIt has been brought to our notice that this time limit is not being adhered to by banks and that the\nborrowing institutions find it difficult to achieve the annual targetted  programme  due to delay in\nsanction of credit limits/enhancement of credit limits, by banks, thus resulting in heavy financial\nlosses. Banks should, therefore, ensure that the time schedule prescribed for disposal of loan\napplications is strictly adhered to. With a view to reviewing specific instances of undue delay in\nthe disposal of loan applications and having interaction at the field level, it has been decided that\nKVIC or its agency viz. KVIB should be made a member of the State Level Bankers Committees\n(SLBCs) as also of the District Consultative Committees ( DCCs). Lead Banks/ convenor banks of\nSLBCs may please take action accordingly.\niii) Project Profiles\nIt has been decided that banks should not normally call for a separate project profile in regard to\nsmall loans to individual artisans/village industries. Large projects of KVIC assisted agencies\nwould, however, have to be supported by suitable project profiles, wherever such project profiles\nprepared by NABARD /SIDBI are available banks should adopt the same. In respect of other\nactivities KVIC may have dialogue with the concerned banks who will extend assistance in\nformulating appropriate project profiles.\niv) Security and Margin requirements\nAs far as security and margin requirements are concerned banks should follow the RBI\nguidelines for advance to priority sector. Banks should not insist on personal guarantees of\nofficials of the implementing agencies for loans sanctioned to the agencies.\nv) Inclusion of physical and financial programmes for KVI sector in the credit plans\nprepared under Service Area Approach\nIn order to ensure that the KVI sector s programmes are not hampered for want of adequate and\ntimely bank credit, it is necessary that such programmes are included in the credit plans preparedby banks under the Service Area Approach. Some banks had expressed difficulty in getting\nadequate details of such programmes well in time for being built into the credit plans. It has,\ntherefore, been decided that KVIC/ KVIBs would furnish to the concerned lead banks the annual\nphysical and fnancial  programmes  under the Khadi and Village Industries Sector with full details\nof the various schemes blocks-wise and village-wise, well in time so that the same could be\nincluded in the respective branch/ block/district credit plans.\n2.

One of the banks had sought our\ninstructions regarding the correct method of computation of value of plant and\nmachinery/equipment which is taken on lease/hire-purchase by the borrowing unit, in order to\ndetermine its status. In this connection, we have to clarify that in the case of SSI units, as per the\nnotification of Government of India, in calculating the value of plant and machinery, whether\nheld on ownership term or by lease or by hire-purchase, the original price paid by the owner,\nirrespective of whether the plant and machinery are new or second-hand, will have to be taken\ninto account. In other words, in the case of machinery taken on hire-purchase/lease the actual\nprice paid by the owner i.e. hirer/ leassor should be taken into account for computing the value of\nplant and machinery.\n2. The above clarification will also apply in the case of  small business  units which take\nequipment (including vehicles) on hire-purchase/lease.\n3.

Contribution from SIDC/SIIC etc., which form part of the promoters  contribution, may be\nindicated clearly.\nQ.8 The entrepreneur shall ensure that there is a reasonable market potential for the product\nbefore taking decision to set up facilities for its manufacture. The fact that industrial licence etc.,\nhave been given by Government does not necessarily mean that the market aspect has been fully\nexamined. The unit would be well advised to undertake a comprehensive market survey to\nestablish the market potential to the satisfaction of the banks/institutions. The questions in this\nsection are designed to elicit fuller information on the market prospects for the company s\nproducts and the related issues.\nQ.8.01 While answering this question, described the product, its major uses and present and\nfuture market prospects. If the product is a new one, intended to substitute an existing product,\nexplain the special qualities/features of the product vis-a-vis the existing product which would be\nsubstituted. Bring out clearly the advantages of the unit s product vis-a-vis the products of its\ncompetitors.\nQ.8.02 Give data on the present installed capacity likely to materialised in each of the next few\nyears and current production and expected production for the next few years. Figures of existing\ncapacity and production would be available from publications like the Monthly Statistics ofProduction (published by the Central Statistical Organisation), Guidelines to Industries (by\nDGTD etc.) Some of the sources for the estimates of future demand are publications of the\nPlanning Commission, DGTD, Chambers of Commerce and Industry, State Directorates of\nIndustries, State Industrial Development Corporations, etc. There are a number of Consultancy\norganisations in the country which would also be able to undertake a detailed market study on\nbehalf of the applicant.\nQ.8.03 8.05 If it is proposed to export a part of the production (either because of a stipulation in\nto the  industrial licence or for any other reason), give data regarding the export market,\ninternational prices during the last 2/3 years, etc. The information may include figures of the\ncountry s export of the product to the various countries for the past few years and projected\nexport demand made by the Export Promotion Councils, Development Councils, Trade\nDevelopment Authority, etc.\nQ.8.06 If the bulk of the production is expected to be sold to a few consumers, or the product is\nsophisticated and having limited market, please indicate the long-term arrangements, if any,\nmade with such consumers or dealers in the products.\nQ.10 The purpose of this section is to assess the economic benefits from the project accruing to\nthe country, particularly in terms of foreign exchange earnings.\nFurnish the international prices (f.o.b. prices for exports and c.i.f. for imports) of the finished\nproduct and of the major material inputs such as raw materials, etc. It is not necessary that the\ncompany should be importing or exporting the commodities. The figures of international prices\nare required by the institutions for calculating the benefits accruing to the country by\nindigenously producing or by exporting the products abroad.\nThe data for this purpose could be obtained from export promotion councils, industry\nassociations, leading importers/exporters, foreign trade journals, etc., and the sources from which\ndata have been obtained may be indicated in your replies.\nAgainst Q.10.04 explain the company s assessment in detail of the scope for ancillary industries\nto come up in the area as a result of the setting up of the proposed project.\nQ.11 If any special conditions have been imposed in any of the approvals mentioned under these\nquestions, please indicate how far these conditions have been complied with and steps taken to\ncomply with the same.

No. BP.BC. 94/C.464(A)-78 July 20, 1978\nAsadha 29, 1900(s)\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\nDear Sir\nReport of the High Powered Committee for Examining\nBank Credit Problems of Small Scale Industries\nThe Government of India had constituted a High Powered Committee under the Chairmanship of\nShri I.C. Puri, Development Commissioner, Small Scale Industries, New Delhi, for examining\nbank credit problems of small scale industries. The committee has gone into the relevant  aspects\nand has submitted its Report. The recommendations made by it are reproduced in  the Annexure.\nSome of the recommendations have been examined and we advise as under :-\n2.i) With a view to introducing a measure of uniformity and simplicity, the committee has\nevolved two sets of application and interview-cum-appraisal forms for small scale industrial\nborrowers whose requirements of credit facilities do not exceed Rs. 2 lakhs. One set of these\nforms is for advances upto Rs. 25,000/- and another for advances between Rs. 25,000/- and Rs. 2\nlakhs. We commend these simplified forms for adoption by banks as early as possible. The\nformats have been given as Annexure I and I-A to the Report of the Working Group on co-\nordination between State Financial Corporation and banks (vide our letter\nDBOD.No.CAS.BC.88/ C.446(SFC)-78 dated the 8th July 1978).\nii)Banks should adopt a flexible approach towards margin requirements, particularly in\nregard to smaller of the small scale industries and the technically qualified and other\nentrepreneurs sponsored under special employment schemes of Central/State Governments and\nno viable schemes should be turned down merely for want of margins, if the proposal is\notherwise in order. Further, in deserving cases, the entrepreneurs may be permitted to introduce\nequity contribution in stages, as and when required, without insisting that the entire equity should\nbe brought in at the initial stage of the project itself. However, the source of additional funds\nrequired to meet margins for operating at a level beyond the breakeven level should be identified\nto the satisfaction of the banks at the outset itself.\niii)Banks should be largely guided by the viability of the projects while entertaining credit\nproposals. Collateral security by way of immovable properties or third party guarantees should\nnot be insisted upon as a matter of routine. No worthwhile proposal should be turned down\nmerely for want of collateral security/guarantee. Where collateral security is obtained, the\ncreation of the charge may be, as far as possible, by way of equitable mortgage instead of\nregistered mortgage to save stamp/registration costs to the borrowers.\niv)Banks should fix repayment programmes in respect of term loans after taking into\nconsideration the surplus generating capacity of the unit financed, the break even point, etc. and\nnot in an ad hoc manner. Besides, the repayment schedules fixed should be reviewed and\nrescheduled to the extent necessary whenever an industrial unit is unable to make payment due topower cuts, recession or other genuine reasons. Banks should collect the interest accrued on\nloans during the holiday period in easy installments after the unit starts generating surplus,\nwithout any incidence of compound interest.\nv)With a view to facilitating timely sanction of credit facilities, the branch managers should\nbe vested with adequate discretionary powers for ensuring that 60 to 80 per cent of the credit\ndecisions are taken at the branch level itself. The intention is that small credit limits upto Rs.\n25,000/- and those exceeding this amount but upto Rs.2 lakhs should normally be disposed of\nwithin a period of 4 weeks and 8 to 9 weeks respectively from the date of receipt of the\napplications. Banks should, therefore, make a review of the discretionary powers of officials at\nvarious levels. The delegation of adequate authority should, of course, be with due regard to the\nexperience and capabilities of the branch managers and there should be proper system of control\nover the exercise of such discretion by the branch managers.\n3.We shall be glad if you will take immediate steps to implement the aforesaid\nrecommendations of the committee and give suitable operating instructions to all your offices.\n4.The other recommendations of the committee are being examined by us /Government of\nIndia.\n5.Please acknowledge receipt and keep us informed of the steps taken in the matter.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(K. B. Chore)\nAdditional Chief Officer\nANNEXURE\nReport of the High Powered Committee for Examining Bank Credit Problems of Small\nScale Industries\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\n1.Standardisation of Application and Appraisal Forms\nThe Committee has evolved two sets of application and interview-cum-appraisal forms for small\nscale industrial borrowers whose requirements of credit facilities do not exceed Rs. 2 lacs.\nCategory  C  - for advances upto Rs. 25,000/-\nCategory  B  - advances between Rs. 25,000/- and Rs. 2 lacsThe Committee recommends that these simplified application and appraisal forms be adopted by\nall banks, for the sake of uniformity and simplicity.\n2.Margins\ni)In the case of technically qualified entrepreneurs, the minimum margin  requirements should\nbe flexible and no viable schemes should be turned down merely for want of margins, if\notherwise in order.\nii)For small units requiring financial assistance upto Rs. 25,000/- ( Category  C ) there should\nbe no insistence on margins; banks should not hesitate to finance upto 100% of their\nrequirements.\niii)In respect of the Category  B  units, requiring financial assistance ranging between\nRs.25,000/- and Rs.2 lacs, margins should not exceed 20% to 25%.\niv)In the case of small industrial units set up under special employment schemes of the\nGovernment, banks should not call for additional margins over and above those stipulated by the\nGovernment.\nv)Entrepreneurs should be permitted to introduce their equity contribution in stages as and\nwhen required, without insisting that the entire equity be brought in at the initial stage.\nvi)To extend to the entrepreneurs equity or quasi-equity assistance, the Committee\nrecommends the setting up of a soft loan assistance fund or a National Equity Fund.\nvii)The investment subsidy schemes and transport subsidy schemes available to entrepreneurs in\nbackward areas should be given adequate publicity so that they may be fully availed of by\nentrepreneurs.\n3.Collateral Security\ni)Banks should give up the security-oriented approach in financing small industries and\nshould depend only on the viability of the project.\nii)The prac tice of obtaining third party guarantees, in a routine manner, especially in the\ncase of small loans, should be discontinued.\niii) When a homogeneous group of small borrowers are financed, group guarantees may be\nobtained to facilitate recovery.\niv) Banks should not, normally, insist for collateral security by way of immovable properties or\nthird party guarantees.\nv)Unencumbered industrial assets may be obtained as collateral security, without causing\nhardship to the borrowers by way of additional costs. Such security should also be released from\nthe prior charge whenever legitimate need arises.\nvi) Banks should not obtain, as a rule, registered mortgages and should accept equitable\nmortgages where immovable properties are to be charged as security, either primary or collateral.\n4.Repayment Programmes\ni)Banks should fix repayment programmes taking into account the sustenance\nrequirements, surplus generating capacity, the break-even point and provision for contingencies\nand not in  ad hoc  manner.ii)Adequate start-up (holiday) period for repayment should be given, taking into account the\ntime taken to reach the break-even point.\niii)Interest on loans during the holiday period should be collected in easy installment after\nthe unit starts operating surplus, without any incidence of compound interest.\niv)In cases of power-cuts, recession, or natural calamities, the repayment programmes of all\nloans should be reviewed and rescheduled to the extent necessary.\n5.Discretionary Powers\ni)Banks should review the discretionary powers of their branch managers and ensure that\n60% to 80% of the credit decisions required by the clientele of the branch are taken at the branch\nlevel itself.\nii)Applications for loans upto Rs.25 ,000/- (Category  C ) should be disposed of, positively,\nwithin 4 weeks after receipt. Applications for advances above Rs.25 ,000/- upto Rs. 2 lacs\n(Category  B ) should be disposed of within 8 to 9 weeks.\n6.Rate of Interest\ni)Banks should adopt a slab system of interest rates, for SSI advance s, with a positive bias\ntowards the smaller units.\nii)For advances to small units of Category  C  (advances upto Rs. 25,000/-) the interest\nshould not exceed the minimum lending rate prescribed by RBI (at present 12 1/2% p.a.)\niii)In the case of units wi th credit facilities between Rs.25 ,000/- and Rs. 2 lacs (Category  B\n) the rate should be lower than in the higher slabs and, in any case, should not be much higher\nthan the minimum lending rate itself (at present 12\u00bd% p.a.)\niv)Banks should avoid charging  penal interest rate and whenever necessary give special\nconcessions in interest rates to sick units under rehabilitation.\nv)The concessions in interest rates for units in backward areas, recommended by Nayak\nCommittee should be implemented by the banks.\nvi)The Committee recommends to the Government to exempt interest on advances to small\nindustries from the interest tax, so that the banks may pass on further reduction in interest\ncorrespondingly.\nvii)Banks should not levy service charges, inspection cha rges, etc. on advances to small scale\nindustries.\nviii)Banks should, normally, obtain refinance from IDBI for all eligible term loans to pass on\nthe benefit of lower rates of interest. If a bank decides not to obtain refinance, it should,\nhowever, pass on the concessionary interest rates on such loans, on its own.\n7.IDBI Refinance & Bill Rediscounting Scheme\ni)The procedures for obtaining refinance may be further simplified, in respect of term loans\nupto Rs. 5 lacs.\nii)All term loans to small scale industries may be made eligible for refinance.\niii)The stipulations relating to minimum requirements of debt/equity ratio, promoters\ncontribution etc. may be relaxed in respect of small units.\niv)The bills from SSI units may be accepted for rediscount wit hout any specific limit being\nfixed under Bill Rediscounting Scheme.8.Measures to be taken to Facilitate  Flow of Institutional Finance\ni)To increase the coverage of financing small industries, banks should make fuller\nutilisation of SISIs for project evaluation, rehabilitation of sick units, recovery of dues, and\nmarketing assistance. It is recommended that the Government could take steps to upgrade the\nskills available in the SISIs in the country.\nii)To increase the flow of credit to the SSI sector , the entrepreneur should \u2013\na)furnish adequate data to the bank to take credit decisions,\nb)give adequate attention to proper planning at all stages and discuss the plans with the\nbank,\nc)maintain basic records, books of accounts, stock registers, etc.,\nd)appreciate the need for improving managerial skills, and\ne)pay adequate attention to the aspect of quality control.\n9.Conclusion\ni)The impact of the implementation of these recommendations may be reviewed by a\nsimilar Committee after a period of three years.\nii)A small Committee under the Chairmanship of Development Commissioner (SSI) with a\nfew bankers, Reserve Bank of India and a representative of industry be appointed to keep a\nvigilant watch over the implementation of the report and ironing out any problems.\nDBOD.No. BP.BC.169/C.464(A)-78 December 12, 1978\nAgrahayana 21, 1900(S)\nAll Commercial Banks\nDear Sir\nBank Credit for Artisans, Village & Cottage Industries and\nSmall-Scale Industries in the Tiny Sector\nPursuant to the decision taken at the meeting the Prime Minister had with the Chief Executives\nof major commercial banks and financial institutions on 8th October 1978, Government of India\nset up a Working Group for evolving specific measures for expanding bank credit to small scale\nand cottage industries, artisans etc., with special reference to District Industries  Centres ( DICs).\nThe Working Group, which submitted its report recently, has noted that although there has been\na considerable increase in the flow of institutional finance to this sector, the orientation has\nmainly been, so far as term lending and commercial banks were concerned, to the modern small\nscale industrial units in the urban and semi-urban areas and in the case of co-operatives,\nprincipally towards the handloom industry. The thrust of the new industrial  policy for this sector\nwas, however, to generate production and employment in the rural areas. The Working Grouphas accordingly made its recommendations for chanalising institutional credit on an increasing\nscale to the  tiny  modern small scale industries and the village and household industries which\nare planned to be developed in the rural areas. Based on the suggestions made by the Working\nGroup for the different sub-sectors under small scale industry, we advise as follows :\nInstitutional Credit for Artisans and Village and Cottage Industries\n2. It has been recognised that this sector has the largest employment potential which can be\nrealised only if several organisational, managerial, financial technical and marketing problems of\nthis sector are resolved in an integrated manner. In providing credit to this sector, banks are\nexpected to adopt the following measures :\na)It is estimated that the total credit requirements of an individual artisan or a village  or\ncottage unit would not normally exceed Rs. 25,000/- inclusive of both equipment finance and\nworking capital. Credit upto Rs.25 ,000/- to this sub-sector should be sanctioned as a composite\nterm loan, for equipment finance or working capital or both, with repayment period of 7 to 10\nyears or even more with an initial moratorium period of 12 months to 18 months both for interest\nand principal, considering the small amount of surpluses which can be expected to be generated\nand the continuous essential sustenance needs of the borrowers.\nb)There should be no insistence on margin for this category. The guarantee cover in respect\nof these loans is proposed to be enhanced to 90% and as such, banks should not ask for any\ncollateral security/guarantee.\nc)The ma ximum rate of interest that can be charged on these loans will be the ceiling rates\nfor primary lenders prescribed under the IDBI Automatic Refinance Scheme, viz. 9 1/2% p.a. in\nspecified backward districts and 11% p.a. in other areas (excluding the cases which would be\ncovered by the Differential Rate of Interest Scheme). irrespective of whether refinance is\nobtained or not. IDBI is making necessary arrangements to cover such composite loans under its\nAutomatic Refinance Scheme.\nd)While sanctioning the  limit  or  loan , the requirements of one operating cycle should be\nliberally assessed and a contingency of 10 to 20% should be added to this amount in the original\nsanction itself to be disbursed when required in any unforeseen contingency due to operational\nbottlenecks or for some consumption requirements. The quantum of finance extended for\nconsumption purposes in individual cases should not exceed the ceiling indicated hereunder :-\ni) General Consumption Rs. 75/-\nii) Medical Expenses Rs.250/-\niii) Educational needs Rs.100/-\niv)Marriage ceremonies Rs.250/-\nv) Funerals, births, etc. Rs. 75/-\nvi)Certain religious ceremonies Rs. 75/-\nProvided, however, the aggregate of the consumption finance for two or more purposes should\nnot  exceed Rs. 500/- per borrower.e)The loans sanctioned should be reviewed at periodic intervals (say annually) to assess\nwhether the working capital requirement of the unit has increased either as a result of increased\nlevel of operations or increased cost and enhancements in the loans authorised wherever\njustified.\nFor the above purposes village and cottage industry will be defined as :\n\u201cArtisans (irrespective of location) or small industrial activities (viz. manufacturing, processing,\npreservation and servicing) in villages and small towns with a population not exceeding 50,000/ -\ninvolving utilisation of locally available natural resources and/or human skills (where individual\ncredit requirements do not exceed Rs.25 ,000/-) \u201c\n3.Institutional Finance for the  Tiny Sector\nIn the case of term loans to this sector the ceiling of 11% as already prescribed in Governor s\nletter dated 12th December 1977 will be applicable. In respect of credit limits for working capital\nfor above Rs. 25,000 but upto Rs. 1 lakh granted to this sector, banks may charge interest at a\nrate not exceeding 12\u00bd% p.a. (except for small banks with aggregate demand and time liabilities\nof less than Rs. 25 crores which may charge interest at a rate not exceeding 13\u00bd% p.a.)\n(Tiny sector includes industrial units located in villages and in towns with population not\nexceeding 50,000 and in which the original investment in equipment and machinery does not\nexceed Rs. 1 lakh).\n4.Banks should not charge penal interest in respect of loans and advances to the  above two\nsectors whether for term requirements or for working capital. Immediately on occurence of the\ndefault in the accounts, the concerned branches should, however, take steps with the active co-\noperation of the DICs to restore the account to health or where this is not found possible, initiate\nnecessary steps for recovery. No further charges should be levied by banks on such units except\nby way of reimbursement of reasonable out-of-packet expenses where unavoidable, incurred by\nbanks in respect of the relative accounts.\n5.With a view to facilitating timely sanction of credit facilities to the above sectors, it\nshould be ensured that all proposals upto Rs. 1 lakh are disposed of within a period of 30 days\nfrom the date of receipt of application. For this purpose-\na)All branch managers of banks should be vested with discretionary powers to sanction\nproposals upto Rs. 25,000/- without reference to any higher authority. Since the objective of\nsetting up the DIC is to decentralise the decision-making process to the district level especially in\nregard to the  tiny  sector, the decisions in respect of these advances should also be at the district\nlevel at least upto Rs. 25,000/-. If any bank has any immediate difficulty in extending such\ndiscretionary powers to all its branches, it should create the necessary administrative machinery\nat least at the district level, for this purpose.b)In respect of advances above Rs. 25,000/- and upto Rs.1 lakh, in order to ensure that the\nappraisal at both the DIC and the bank (and the SFC where it is involved) is taken  up\nsimultaneously, the DIC will forward a copy each of the application  (in duplicate) [including the\ninterview form prescribed by High Powered Committee for Examining Bank Credit Problems of\nSmall-Scale Industries for such advances- (Category  B )] to the bank and to SFC, (where\nnecessary). Further, the Manager (Credit) will also have discussions with the Branch Manager of\nthe bank and the SFC, wherever possible during the appraisal stage so that their points also can\nbe taken care of during the first appraisal itself. The DIC, while forwarding the appraisal will\nmake available the inputs of its different functional managers, like Raw Material, Technical and\nMarketing and not merely that of the Manager (Credit) so as to obviate the necessity of the bank\nreferring it to SISI or Technical Consultancy Organisation or outside consultants. If any proposal\nis found to be not acceptable by banks or financial institutions, it should be returned to the DICs\nwith the  specific reasons for non-acceptance. The DICs would than be expected to rectify the\ndefects or deficiencies so as to make it eligible.\nc)All banks should initiate a feedback mechanism to ensure that the time limit fixed for\ndisposal of proposals is adhered to and that applications are not rejected on flimsy grounds. The\nrejection of applications should be at a level higher than the Branch Manager in every instance.\nd)Once a proper appraisal has been submitted by the DIC, banks should not reduce the lim it\nwithout apprising the DIC of the reasons for reduced sanction.\n6.It is not the intention that all such proposals for assistance must necessarily be routed\nthrough DICs. In fact, the Branch Managers should continue to entertain such proposals directly\nas at present. Regular meetings and discussions between the Officers of the DIC  and the banks\nand SFC represented in the districts as also senior representatives from State s Industries\nDepartment should be held for closer co-ordination among the financial institutions and DIC, at\nleast in the initial period of six months to a year.\n7.Please ensure that suitable guidelines are issued to your bank s offices and that the\nrelative circular reaches them at least within fortnight.

The Working Group on small-scale industries with special reference to\nDistrict Industries Centres, has also made recommendations in respect of problems faced by\nlarger small-scale industries as well. Based on these recommendations, we have to advise as\nfollows :\na)When a SSI unit needs term finance from a SFC and working capital from a bank, it often\nexperiences considerable delay in obtaining working capital after term loans are sanctioned.\nWhile the Bhide  Committee has made comprehensive recommendations in this regard, these\nhave not been either implemented by banks or have not percolated down to the branch level.\nThere is an urgent need to rectify this situation.\nb)In sanctioning of the quantum of credit facilities, there is a tendency to cu t down the\nlimits on an adhoc basis on the plea that the unit will require the full credit limits only when it\ngoes into full production. There are often delays subsequently for enhancing limits and unit's\noperations suffer. The full working capital should, therefore, be sanctioned at the outset\nobviating the necessity for references to sanctioning authority subsequently.\nc)Once the unit goes into operation, temporary additional requirements of finance are often\ndelayed as a result of which operations suffer. If there is any distortion in the operating cycle,\ne.g. by non-payment of certain bills, etc., the units fail to get prompt assistance. This is often the\nresult of the need to refer such proposals to the controlling authority. In this connection, some of\nthe banks have delegated authority to their branches to exceed the limits sanctioned by a certain\npercentage in cases of need. Similar procedures are recommended for adoption uniformly by all\nbanks.\nd)The Reserve Bank of India has already directed al l the commercial banks that term loan\nto SSI units should not carry a rate of interest exceeding 11% irrespective of whether they avail\nof the refinance facility from the IDBI or not. As concessionary refinance is available from IDBI\nfor units in specified backward districts, subject to the banks charging a rate of interest not\nexceeding 9 1/2% p.a. banks should ensure that term finance to SSI Units in those areas become\navailable at 9 1/2% p.a. If they are eligible for refinance from IDBI, even if refinance is not\nactually availed of.\ne)In the case of large SSI units with working capital limits exceeding Rs.1 lakh the penal\nrates charged should be in conformity with the instructions issued by the Reserve Bank of India\nand especially the following points should be borne in mind :\ni)Penal rate should not be applied in a routine manner; it should be used as a deterrent only\nin extreme cases of financial indiscipline or wilful defaults;ii)the decision to charge penal rate should be taken only at the controlling office, taking into\naccount the overall position. The facts of the case should justify that such a course of action is\nwarranted to discipline the borrower ;\niii)the penal rate should be applied on the amount of default or irregularity and not on the\ntotal outstandings.\nf)No further charges should be levied by banks except by way of reimbursement of\nreasonable out-of-pocket expenses, where unavoidable, incurred in respect of the relative\naccounts.\n2.Please ensure that suitable guidelines are issue d to your bank's offices and that the\nrelative circular reaches them at least within a forthnight.

The maximum rates of interest to be charged in case of advances to units in\nthe 'tiny' sector have been indicated in paragraph 3 of the letter. In this connection, we have to\nclarify that in the case of term loans for not less than three years granted to units in the tiny\nsector, banks should ensure that the rate of interest charged does not exceed 9\u00bd% for units in\nspecified backward districts and 11% in other areas. These loans are normally eligible for\nrefinance from Industrial Development Bank of India. However, the rates of interest specified\nabove should be made applicable irrespective of whether or not Industrial Development Bank of\nIndia refinance is availed of.\nIn our circular referred to above, we have also indicated that in respect of credit limits for\nworking capital for over Rs.25 ,000/- but upto Rs.1 lakh granted to units in the tiny sector, banksmay charge a maximum rate of interest of 12\u00bd% (13\u00bd% for small banks). It is expected that\nnormally credit limits below Rs.25 ,000/- to the tiny sector will be granted in the form of\ncomposite term loans and charged interest accordingly. However, in cases where units in the tiny\nsector require only working capital limits upto Rs.25 ,000/-, banks should ensure that the rate of\ninterest is as low as possible, particularly in the specified backward district, and in any case does\nnot exceed 12\u00bd% (13\u00bd% for small banks with demand and time liabilities of less than Rs.25\ncrores).\nFor the sake of ready reference, we enclose a chart indicating the ceiling interest rate structure in\ncase of advances to the small-scale industrial sector.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(K.

As stated in paragraph 2 of the above circular, it has been recognised that the large\nemployment potential of this sector can be realised only if several organisational, managerial,\nfinancial, technical and marketing problems of this sector are resolved in an integrated manner.\nThe Working Group, had, therefore, recommended that institutional credit support should be\navailable to recognized organisations providing inputs, marketing support, technical guidance\nand other facilities to the decentralised industrial sector viz., artisans, village and cottage\nindustries. The Group had further recommended that these organisations should be included in\nthe  priority sector  for the purposes of credit facilities.\n3. The above recommendations have been examined and it has been decided that advances\ngranted to organisations, which have been established for the purpose of developing the\ndecentralised sector by the Central and State Governments or by recognised promotional and\nmarketing organisations like KVIC, for the purchase and supply of inputs to and/or marketing\nthe output of the artisans, village and cottage industries, should be treated as  priority sector\nadvances. Typically, the eligible institutions will be State Level Corporations set up exclusively\nfor assisting handlooms, handicrafts and/or sericulture or registered societies promoted by the\nKVIC, etc. Advances to these institutions for the above specific purposes will have to be\nsegregated from other advances, if any, given to them.\n4.

In regard to the concession in the rate of\ninterest, so far as the tiny* units are concerned, banks have been advised not to charge more than\n13.50% p.a.

This concession will now extend to all the tiny units, including those\ncovered under the revised definition with an enhanced limit of Rs.2 lakhs for working capital\nlimits.\n3. As regards exemption from the minimum lending rates, advances upto Rs. 2 lakhs and covered\nunder the Credit Guarantee Scheme for small-scale industries are at present exempt from the\nminimum lending rate directive (currently 13.5%).

Keeping in view the revised definition of small-scale\nindustries, it has been decided that the present ceilings on interest rates will continue to be\napplicable for all credit limits to SSI units upto (and inclusive of) Rs. 25 lakhs for working\ncapital purpose. Interest applicable to limits in excess of Rs.25 lakhs will, however, be subject to\nthe normal ceiling of 19.4% p.a.\n5.

As far\nas the small scale sector industries are concerned, their present definition is based on the\nNotification dated 16th February, 1973 issued in terms of Section 29(B) of the Industries\n(Development & Regulation) Act, which prescribes the appropriate investment ceiling in fixed\nassets in plant and machinery for small scale units and for ancillaries respectively. It will be\nnoted that small scale units have so far been promoted essentially for providing goods and\nservices  relateable to manufacture or processing of services connected thereof. It has been\nnoticed that while a number of service oriented enterprises falling under the definition of small\nscale units at present in force have been registered as small scale units, there are cases in which\nsuch registration has been denied, creating a somewhat anomalous situation.\nSince it is clear that the scope for self-employment opportunities will increasingly form the\ngrowth of urbanisation and industrial dispersal and, in order to bring about greater  uniformity in\nregard to assistance to service-oriented small scale units, Government have been pleased to\ndecide that all service-oriented enterprises would also be eligible to be registered as small scale\nestablishment, provided some minimum investment in fixed assets in plant and machinery is\ninvolved in setting up such establishments. Such small scale establishments would typically\ncover personal or household services required in urban, semi-urban/rural contexts such as\nlaundry, zeroxing, repair and maintenance of consumer durables, hatchery, poultry farms etc.\nWhile registering such service-oriented units as small scale establishments, care will have to be\ntaken to ensure that no enterprise engaged in a purely trading or commercial activity is included.\nThe test to be applied in registering small service establishments would be the requirement of\nsome minimum investment in fixed assets in plant and machinery and the fact that the unit\nprovides services for personal or household needs to the extent that these remain the dominant\nactivities, the unit may be registered as a small scale establishment.\nGovernment have further decided that on being so registered, these small scale establishments\nwould be entitled to the same concession and incentives as small scale industries and ancillaryindustries as per definition contained in the Notification dated 16th February, 1973. It is clarified\nthat purely trading or commercial enterprises will not so qualify.\nIn view of the fact that the investment in fixed assets in plant and machinery required by such\nsmall service establishments would not be large and also having regard to the fact that it is\nnecessary to use the extended definition to encourage increasing dispersal of such establishments\non as wide a scale as possible, Government have further  decided that such small service\nestablishment be registered, subject to a ceiling of investment in fixed assets in plant and\nmachinery in each case not exceeding Rs.2 lakhs and subject further to such establishments\nbeing located in rural areas and towns with a population of 100,000 or less.\nIn respect of the framework of extension, consultancy  and other dispensing services required for\nsuch small service establishments, Government have also decided that the Development\nCommissioner (Small Scale Industries) and associated agencies set up for the promotion of the\nsmall scale sector as a whole under the Central Government and, in case of States, the Directors\nof Industries and the associated promotional agencies at the State level will remain responsible\nfor the promotion and growth of small service establishments, as in the case of small scale\nindustries.\nIn so far as the National Small Industries Corporation is concerned, instructions are being issued\nto the Corporation to extend hire-purchase assistance to small service establishments also.\nSuitable instructions are  being separately issued by the Ministry of Industry in regard to the\napplicability of the Central Investment Subsidy Scheme to small service establishments also,\nprovided they are located in eligible areas/districts.

No.BP.BC.169/ C.464(A)-78 dated the 12th December 1978, has been in operation for\nmore than three years. This Scheme is intended to assist the artisans, village and cottage\nindustries located in villages and small towns with a population not exceeding 50,000 involving\nutilisation of locally available resources and/or human skills. However, on receipt of\nrepresentations stating that the loans granted by banks under the Scheme had not actually gone to\nthe persons for whom they were intended, we conducted a study on a sample basis covering 130\nbranches of banks in different States. The Study revealed that only 12 of these branches had\ngranted composite term loans. Some of the branch  Managers were not even aware of the\nScheme. The period of loans varied between two and five years without any provision for initial\nmoratorium. Most of the loans were granted against  collateral security and in certain cases even\nthird party guarantees were insisted upon. Margins were stipulated between 15% and 30% and\nthe specified concessional  rates of interest were not charged. The credit requirements of\nborrowers were not liberally assessed taking into account the requirements of  one operating\ncycle and contingency of 10% to 20% as also provision for consumption expenses. In case of\nsome of the banks, adequate discretionary powers were not vested in branch Managers to\nsanction the loans without reference to higher authorities. Thus, the composite loan scheme has\nnot been implemented by banks in accordance with the instructions issued by us and as such it\nfailed to serve the intended purpose, i.e., to generate production and employment in rural areas\nand small towns to the desired extent.\n2.Certain difficulties have been expressed by banks in regard to composite term loans, i.e.,\n(i) long repayment period of 7 to 10 years or even more with an initial moratorium of 12 to 18\nmonths both for interest and principal, and (ii) want of specimen of standardized documents to be\nexecuted by borrowers.\nIn this connection, we have to advise as under :\ni)The period of repayment of term loans is fixed taking into account the break-even point,\nsurplus-generating capacity of the unit, etc. The artisans and village/cottage industrial units\navailing of the composite term loans would be able to generate small amounts of surpluses.\nBesides, taking into account their continuous essential sustenance needs, the period of repayment\nof loans will have necessarily to be kept at the above level.\nii)The banks can in consultation with their legal advisers finalised the specimen of the\ndocuments. Industrial Development Bank of India which provides full refinance in respect of\ncomposite term loans under its  Refinance of Industrial Loans Scheme  has agreed that refinance\nassistance will be allowed for such loans provided the documents executed evidence the term\nloan character of the assistance sanctioned.\n3.The basic approach to wards development of small scale industries as outlined in the\nIndustrial Policy Resolutions and National Plans is to create immediate employment\nopportunities with relatively less investment and to help in raising levels of earnings and\nstandards of living of a large number of artisans, craftsmen and entrepreneurs. In this context, the\ncomposite term loan scheme assumes special importance for extending credit facilities to\nartisans, village and cottage industries on soft terms with a view to providing them withemployment opportunities. It is felt that this Scheme will become popular if banks take liberal\nview in regard to credit proposals received by them from the aforesaid borrowers. For your ready\nreference, we give in the Annexure our guidelines on composite term loans as contained in\ncircular dated 12th December 1978 referred to in paragraph 1 above. We shall be glad if you will\nplease issue suitable instructions to your bank s offices for grant of composite term loans to\nartisans, village and cottage industries in accordance with these guidelines. The action\ntaken/proposed to be taken in the matter may please be advised to us at an early date.\n4.Please acknowledge receipt and let us know the officer to be contacted in your Central\nOffice for the purpose of monitoring in this regard.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(B.

No.BP.BC.169/ C.464(A)-78\nDated the 12th December 1978.\nInstitutional credit for artisans, village and cottage industries\nIt has been recognised that this sector has the largest employment potential which can be realised\nonly if several organisational, managerial, financial, technical and marketing problems of this\nsector are resolved in an integrated manner. In providing credit to this sector, banks are expected\nto adopt the following measures :\na)It is estimated that the total credit requirements of an individual artisan or a village or\ncottage unit would not normally exceed Rs.25 ,000/- inclusive of both equipment finance and\nworking capital. Credit upto Rs. 25,000/- to this sub-sector should be sanctioned as a composite\nterm loan, for equipment finance or working capital or both, with repayment period of 7 to 10\nyears or even more with an initial moratorium period of 12 months to 18 months both for interest\nand principal, considering the small amount of surpluses which can be expected to be generated\nand the continuous essential sustenance needs of the borrowers.\nb)There should be no insistence on margin for this category. The guarantee cover in respect\nof these loans is proposed to be enhanced to 90% and as such banks should not ask for any\ncollateral security/guarantee.\nc)The maximum rate of i nterest that can be charged on these loans will be the ceiling rates\nfor primary lenders prescribed under the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI)\nAutomatic Refinance Scheme, viz., 10.25%* p.a. in specified backward districts and 12.5%* p.a.in other areas (excluding the cases which would be covered by the Differential Rate of Interest\nScheme), irrespective of whether refinance  is obtained or not. IDBI is making necessary\narrangements to cover such composite loans under its Automatic Refinance Scheme.\nd)While sanctioning the  limit  or  loan , the requirements of one operating cycle should be\nliberally assessed and a contingency of 10 to 20% should be added to this amount in the original\nsanction itself to be disbursed when required in any unforeseen contingency due to operational\nbottlenecks or for some consumption requirements. The quantum of finance extended for\nconsumption purposes in individual cases should not exceed the ceiling indicated hereunder:\n(i)General Consumption Rs. 75/-\n(ii)Medical expenses Rs. 250/-\n(iii)Educational needs Rs. 100/-\n(iv)Marriage  ceremonies Rs. 250/-\n(v)Funerals, Births etc. Rs. 75/-\n(vi)Certain religious ceremonies. Rs. 75/-\n* Interest rates revised with effect from the 2nd March 1981\nProvided, however, the aggregate of the consumption finance for two or more purposes should\nnot exceed Rs.500/- per borrower.\ne)The loans sanctioned should be reviewed at periodical intervals (say annually) to assess\nwhether the working capital requirement of the unit has increased either as a result of increased\nlevel of operations or increased cost and enhancements in the loan authorised wherever justified.\nFor the above purposes, village and cottage industry will be defined as :\n\u201cArtisans (irrespective of location) or small Industrial activities (viz., manufacturing, processing,\npreservation and servicing) in villages and small towns with a population not exceeding 50,000\ninvolving utilisation of locally available natural resources and/or human skills (where individual\ncredit requirements do not exceed Rs.25 ,000/-) .\u201d\n2.Banks should not charge penal interest in respect of composite term loan to the above\nsector.\nImmediately on occurrence of the default in the accounts, the concerned branches  should,\nhowever, take steps with the active co-operation of the DICs to restore the account to health or\nwhere this is not found possible, initiate necessary steps for recovery. No further charges should\nbe levied by banks on such units except by way of reimbursement of reasonable out- of  pocket\nexpenses, where unavoidable, incurred by banks in respect of the relative accounts.\n3.With a view to facilitating timely sanction of credit facilities of the above sectors, it\nshould be ensured that all composite term loan proposals are disposed of within a period of 30\ndays from the date of receipt of application. For this purpose :-\na)All branch managers of banks should be vested with discretionary powers to sanction\nproposals upto Rs. 25,000/- without reference to any higher authority. Since the objective ofsetting up the DIC is to decentralise the decision-making process to the district level especially in\nregard to the  tiny  sector, the decisions in respect of these advances should also be at the district\nlevel at least upto Rs. 25,000/-. If any bank has any immediate difficulty in extending such\ndiscretionary powers to all its branches, it should create the necessary administrative machinery\nat least at the district level, for this purpose.\nb)All Banks should initiate a f eedback mechanism to ensure that the time limit fixed for\ndisposal of proposals is adhered to and that applications are not rejected on flimsy grounds. The\nrejection of applications should be at a level higher than the Branch Manager in every instance.\nc)Once a proper/appraisal has been submitted by the DIC, banks should not reduce the limit\nwithout apprising the DIC of the reasons for reduced sanction.\n4.It is not the intention that all such proposals for assistance must necessarily be routed\nthrough DICs. In fact, the Branch Managers should continue to entertain such proposals directly\nas at present. Regular meetings and discussions between the Officers of the DIC and the banks\nand SFC represented in the districts as also senior representatives from State s Industries\nDepartment should be held for closer co-ordination among the financial institutions and DIC, at\nleast in the initial period of six months to a year.\nRPCD.No.PS.BC.13/ C.464(A)-KVIC-82. November 13, 1982\nKartika 22, 1904(S)\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\nDear Sir\nBank Credit to KVIC Sector\nThe credit requirements of KVIC Sector from financial institutions during the Sixth Plan Period\nhave been estimated at Rs.520 crores. Of this, an amount of Rs.230 crores is proposed to be\nraised by KVI Sector from financial institutions  under its Interest Subsidy Scheme. KVIC had\nreported to us that the progress in availing of institutional finance during 1980-81 and 1981- 82\nhas been quite low. Our Governor had convened a meeting of the Chairman of KVIC and\nChairmen of certain major banks on 10 July 1982 to consider some of the practical problems\nfaced by the KVI Sector in obtaining bank finance for KVI programmes. A summary record of\nthe proceedings of the meeting is enclosed  for your  information. In the light of the deliberations\nof the meeting, it has been decided that banks may take action on the lines indicated below :-\na)According to KVIC, in a number of cases, banks had provided credit to the KVIC\ninstitutions for smaller amounts than recommended by KVIC in the eligibility certificates issued\nby it under the Interest Subsidy Scheme. The assessment made by KVIC for the purpose of\nissuing Interest Subsidy Eligibility Certificates should, by and large, be acceptable to banks.\nHowever, to enable the banks to verify the basis on which the assessments have been made andwith a view to ensuring uniformity as between different banks, the norms for assessment of\ncredit to KVI sector could be discussed and agreed to at the DCC/SLBC forums.\nb)A few banks, only in the public sector, have been extending credit to KVI sector. Other\npublic sector banks as also banks in the private sector may extend credit support to the KVI\nsector which is extending its helping hand to artisans and other who are otherwise unorganised\nenabling the latter to get necessary support for their activities. The banking system should do\ntheir utmost to support the KVI sector.\nc)As the credit proposals of KVI sector are generally for larger limits, the\nDivisional/Controlling offices of banks may directly entertain proposals and make credit\nassessments so that delay in sanctioning the credit limits could be avoided. In this context, you\nmay please advise us the details of discretionary powers vested in your Branch Managers and the\nnext higher tier (i.e. Divisional/Regional Manager) for granting advances to the priority sector\nborrowers.\n2.Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(J. R. Prabhu)\nDeputy Chief Officer\nANNEXURE\nSummary Record of the Proceedings of Governor s Meeting with Chairman of KVIC and\nChairmen of Banks held on the 10th July 1982\nThe meeting was presided over by Dr. I. G. Patel, Governor.\n2.Welcoming the participants, Governor mentioned that the meeting was convened to\nconsider some of the practical problems faced by KVIC in obtaining bank finance for its\nprogrammes. He requested Shri. Thomas, the Chairman of KVIC, to initiate the discussions.\nShri. Thomas stated that Khadi and village industries activities have been given an important\nplace in the Sixth Plan. Budgetary allocations made for the sector would not be sufficient to meet\nits expanding activities and the KVIC sector would have to look increasingly for finance from\nthe financial institutions especially in the context of KVIC taking up activities in new areas. He\npointed out that the progress in availing institutional finance under KVIC s sponsorship has been\nslow. Governor observed at this stage that there was no lack of sympathy for the KVIC sector\nand that finance could be extended by the banks.\n3.Shri Thomas referred to some of the problems faced by KVIC institutions in obtaining\nfinance from the banks. He mentioned that in a number of cases banks have provided credit to\nthe institutions for smaller amounts than recommended by KVIC in the eligibility certificates\nissued by it under Interest Subsidy Scheme. He wanted that banks should accept therecommendations of KVIC on the basis of the assessments made by it. It was stated by some of\nthe banks that the basis on which the assessments were made was not indicated in the\ncertificates. Deputy Governor ( Shri. Ghosh) observed that KVI could indicate to banks the\ndetails of assessments made and KVIC and banks may sit together to resolve the differences.\nShri. Sonalkar, Central Bank of India, suggested that the norms for assessment could be\ndiscussed and accepted by the District Consultative Committee through the lead bank.\nConcluding the discussion on this point Governor observed that by and large the assessments\nmade by KVIC for the purpose of issuing Interest Eligibility Certificates should be acceptable to\nthe banks, but the banks have the right to exercise their own judgement in the matter. The norms\nfor assessment could be discussed and agreed to at the District Consultative Committee forums.\n4.Shri Thomas mentioned that while Reserve Bank of India had exempted KVIC from the\noperation of selective credit control, a large number of individual institution sponsored by it have\nto approach Reserve Bank of India for such exemption. He desired that recognised and Certified\nKVIC institutions should automatically get exemptions from the operation of selective credit\ncontrol. Governor agreed to examine the suggestions and said that prima facie he thought the\nsuggestion was reasonable.\n5.Shri Thomas observed that in case the individual artisans borrowed the money directly\nfrom banks they would be eligible for interest at 4% under the DRI Scheme. Governor pointed\nout that over 40% of the people lived below the poverty line and in the present situation, all the\neligible borrowers could not obviously be granted loans at the differential rate of 4% within the\nceiling for DRI loans.\n6.Shri Thomas observed that the lending rates adopted by the co-operative banks were\ndifferent from adopted by nationalised banks for the priority sector. Governor indicated that there\nis no reason why co-operatives should not charge 13.5% for the KVIC sector. Shri Thorat,\nChairman of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank Ltd. agreed that the suggestion should be\nacceptable.\n7.Another point made by Shri Thomas was that the branch managers do not possess\nadequate discretionary powers and the proposals had to be referred to higher authorities which\nresults in delay. The view expressed and accepted was that as credit proposals were for larger\nlimits. KVIC institutions should directly approach the Divisional/Controlling offices of banks to\nobviate such delays.\n8.Shri Panditrao mentioned that there has been under-financing of the schemes covered by\nthe Employment Guarantee Scheme of the Maharashtra Government. The representative of the\nMaharashtra State Co-operative Bank mentioned that the whole issue was being examined and\nthe matter would soon be set right.\n9.Shri Thomas referred to the credit squeeze and the paucity of resources for KVIC sector.\nGovernor observed that these measures do not affect the KVIC sector.\n10.Shri Thomas desired that apart from the nationalised banks, the non- nationalised banks\nand other credit institutions should also come forward to finance the KVIC sector. It wasobserved by the Governor that the public sector banks could very well take care of the financial\nrequirements of the KVIC sector but others could also extend assistance, if necessary. It was also\nmentioned that NABARD would be actively involved in the provision of financial  assistance to\nthe KVIC sector.\n11.Summing up the discussions, Governor observed that KVIC sector had been doing good\nwork. It has extended its helping hand to artisans who are otherwise unorganised enabling them\nto get necessary support for their activities. The banking system should do their utmost to\nsupport this activity.\nRPCD.

IRD.BC.132/SIU-A-85 dated 5 November 1985 addressed by\nour Industrial and Export Credit Department to all Scheduled Commercial Banks advising\nparameters for provision of reliefs/ concessions by banks under rehabilitation packages evolved\nfor sick industrial units considered as potentially viable.\n2. We have since examined the need for separate guidelines in regard to rehabilitation of sick\nunits in the small scale industries (SSI) sector with specific reference to definition of sick SSI\nunit, viability norms, incipient sickness as also reliefs and concessions from banks/ financial\ninstitutions for implementation of rehabilitation Packages in the case of potentially viable units.\nAlthough sickness in the large, medium and small industrial units exhibit many common\nfeatures, any approach to sickness in SSI sector has to reckon with the relative weakness of such\nunits to withstand difficulties as also the distinction between the small scale units and tiny sector\nunits and further that between tiny sector units and units in the decentralised  sector comprising\nartisans, village and cottage industries units. The emphasis of the rehabilitation effort in the case\nof SSI units will, therefore, have to be on adequate and intensive relief measures and their speedy\napplication rather than giving a long span of time to the units for rehabilitation. Accordingly, the\nfollowing guidelines are issued in the case of rehabilitation of sick units in the SSI Sector.\nIncipient Sickness\n3. It is of utmost importance to take measures to ensure that sickness is arrested at the incipient\nstage itself. The managements of the units financed should be advised about their primary\nresponsibility to inform the banks if they face problems which could lead to sickness and to\nrestore the units to normal health. The branch officials, who are in constant contact with them,\nshould develop mutual confidence between the bank and the borrowers. The organisational\narrangements at branch level should also be fully geared for early detection of sickness and\nprompt remedial action. Banks/Financial institutions will have to identify the units showing\nsymptoms of sickness by effective monitoring. An illustrative list of warning signals of incipient\nsickness that are thrown up during the scrutiny of borrowal  accounts and other related records\ne.g. periodical financial data, stock statements, reports on inspection of factory premises and\ngodowns  etc. is given in Annexure -I which will serve as a useful guide to the operating\npersonnel. The branch officials who are familiar with the day-to-day operations in the borrowal\naccounts should be under obligation to identify the early warning signals and initiate corrective\nsteps promptly. Such steps may include providing timely financial assistance depending on\nestablished need, if it is within the powers of the branch manager, and an early reference to the\ncontrolling office where the reliefs required are beyond his delegated powers. The branch\nmanager should also help the unit in sorting out difficulties which are non-financial in nature and\nrequire assistance from outside agencies like Government departments/undertakings, Electricity\nBoards, etc. He should also keep the term lending institutions informed about the position of the\nunits wherever they are also involved.Definition of Sick SSI Unit\n4. A SSI unit should be considered  Sick  if it has (a) incurred cash loss in the previous\naccounting year and is likely to continue to incur cash loss in the current accounting year  and\nhas an erosion on account of cumulative cash losses to the extent of 50 per cent of more of its net\nworth and/or (b) continuously defaulted in meeting four consecutive quarterly installment of\ninterest or two half-yearly installment of principal on term loans and there are persistent\nirregularities in the operation of its credit limits with the bank. While both the conditions (a) and\n(b) should be satisfied in the case of larger SSI units, it would suffice if either alternative (a) or\n(b) is satisfied in the case of the tiny and decentralised sector units. The above definition may be\nadopted for the purpose of reporting data from the half-year ending June 1987, while for the\npurpose of formulating nursing programmes, banks should go by this definition with immediate\neffect.\nViability of Sick SSI Units\n5. A unit may be regarded as potentially viable if it would be in a position, after implementing a\nrelief package spread over a period not exceeding 5 years from the commencement of the\npackage from banks, financial institutions, Government (Central/State) and other concerned\nagencies, as may be necessary, to continue to service its repayment obligations as agreed upon\nincluding those forming part of the package, without the help of the concessions after the\naforesaid period. The repayment period for restructured (past) debts should not exceed 7 years\nfrom the date of implementation of the package. In the case of tiny/ decentralised sector units, the\nperiod of reliefs/concessions and repayment period of restructured debts will be 2 years and 3\nyears respectively. Based on the norms specified above, it will be for the banks/financial\ninstitutions to decide whether a sick SSI unit is potentially viable or not. The viability study of\nthe unit should be carried out and decision on rehabilitation or otherwise taken as far as possible\nwithin a period of 3 months from the date of receipt of complete information  on relevant aspects\nfrom the management  of the unit.\nReliefs and Concessions for\nRehabilitation of Potentially Viable Units\n6. It is emphasised that only those units which are considered to be potentially viable should be\ntaken up for rehabilitation. Norms for grant of reliefs and concessions by banks/financial\ninstitutions to potentially viable sick SSI units for rehabilitation are furnished in Annexure-II.\nWe may add that the reliefs/concessions to the extent indicated in the Annexure  are not intended\nto be given as a matter of course in all cases of rehabilitation of sick SSI units, it is for the\nbanks/financial institutions to decide on the nature and extent of concessions\nnecessary/warranted within these parameters, depending upon the merits of each case.\nDelegation of Powers\n7. The delay in the implementation of agreed rehabilitation packages should be reduced. One of\nthe factors contributing to such delay was found to be the time taken for obtaining  clearance to\nthe reliefs and concessions. As it is essential to accelerate the process of clearance, the banks andthe financial institutions may delegate sufficient powers to senior officers at various levels such\nas district, divisional, regional, zonal and also at head office to sanction the bank s or the\nfinancial institution s commitment to its share in the rehabilitation package drawn up in\nconformity with the prescribed guidelines.\nRBI Approval\n8. Cases of concessions in interest rates beyond those specified in these guidelines should be\nreferred to us for approval.\n9. Please acknowledge receipt and advise us of the action taken by your bank in implementing\nthe above. Your report may please be sent to us before the end of March 1987.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(P.

After this is\ndone, the unpaid interest on term loans and cash credit during this period should be segregated\nfrom the total liability and funded. No interest may be charged on funded interest and repayment\nof such funded interest should be made within a period not exceeding 3 years from the date of\ncommencement of implementation of the rehabilitation programme.\nii)Unadjusted Interest Dues\nUnadjusted interest dues such as interest charged between the date upto which rehabilitation\npackage was prepared and the date from which actually implemented, may also be funded on the\nsame terms as at ( i) above.\niii)Term Loans\nThe rate of interest on term loans may be reduced, where considered necessary, by not more than\nthree per cent in the case of tiny/ decentralised  sector units and by not more than two per cent in\nother cases, the reduced rates in no case being less than the rate of interest charged under\nIntegrated Rural Development Programme  (IRDP).\niv)Principal Dues\nAfter the unadjusted interest portion of the cash credit account is segregated as indicated at ( i)\nand (ii) above, the balance representing principal dues may be treated as irregular to the extent it\nexceeds drawing power. This amount may be funded as Working Capital Term Loan (WCTL)\nwith a repayment schedule not exceeding 5 years. Interest may be charged on this funded loan at\n10 per cent per annum.\nv)Cash Losses\nCash losses are likely to be incurred in the initial stages of the rehabilitation programme till the\nunit reaches the break-even level. Such cash losses excluding interest as may be incurred during\nthe nursing programme  may also be financed by the bank or the financial institution, if only one\nof them is the financier. But if both are involved in the rehabilitation package, the financialinstitution concerned should finance such cash losses. Interest may be charged on the funded\namount at the rates prescribed by IDBI under its scheme for rehabilitation assistance.\nvi)Working Capital\nNeed-based working capital should be sanctioned to the unit to enable it to carry on its\noperations, with interest at the minimum of the band of the prescribed interest rates during the\nrehabilitation period. Where the minimum of the band exceeds 15% (as for instance in the case\nof working capital assistance in excess of Rs. 25 lakhs, where it is 16.5%), the rate may be fixed\nat 15% p.a.\nvii)Contingency Loan Assistance\nFor meeting escalations in capital expenditure to be incurred under the rehabilitation programme,\nbanks/financial institutions may provide, where considered necessary, appropriate additional\nfinancial assistance upto 15 per cent of the estimated cost of rehabilitation by way of\ncontingency loan assistance. Interest on this contingency assistance may be charged at the\nconcessional rate allowed for working capital assistance.\nviii)Funds for Start-up Expenses and Margin for Working Capital\nThere will be need to provide the unit under rehabilitation with funds for start-up expenses\n(including payment of pressing creditors) or margin money for working capital in the form of\nlong-term loans. Where a financial institution is not involved, banks may provide the loan for\nstart-up expenses, while margin money assistance may either come from IDBI under its\nRefinance Scheme for Rehabilitation or should be provided by State Government where it is\noperating a margin money scheme. The term loan from banks will carry the same rates as the\nexisting term loans or as prescribed by IDBI where refinance assistance is obtained from it for\nthe purpose.\nix)Promoters  Contribution\nPromoters  contribution towards the rehabilitation assistance may be fixed at not less than 5% of\nthe additional long-term requirements under the package in the case of tiny sector units and at\n10% of such requirements for other units. In the case of units in the decentralised sector,\npromoters  contribution may not be insisted upon for rehabilitation.\nx)Guarantee Fee\nThe guarantee fee payable to Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) in\nrespect of sick SSI units should be borne by the banks/financial institutions during the period of\nrehabilitation programme.\nRPCD.No.PLNFS.

It has been brought to\nour notice that some banks are charging interest at rates higher than 12.5 per cent per annum on\nworking capital limits sanctioned to SHDCs for these purposes. Banks concerned may, therefore,\nreview the interest rates being charged by them to SHDCs and adhere to the prescribed rate of\n12.5 per cent per annum as provided in our current directive on interest rates on advances.\n2.It has also been reported that some banks are not reckoning items like  credit sales to\nGovernment Departments  and pending rebate claims as certified by Government for the purpose\nof calculating drawing power under working capital limits of SHDCs.

It has been brought to our notice that implementing  agencies of\nKVIC/State KVI Boards are not treated as eligible organisations for concessional rate of interest\nof 12.5% per annum applicable to working capital limits sanctioned to State Level Corporations\nfor purchase and supply of inputs to artisans, village and cottage industries and/or marketing\ntheir output. In this connection, we clarify that advances sanctioned to implementing agencies of\nKVIC/State KVI Boards exclusively for the purpose of purchase and supply of inputs to and/or\nmarketing of the outputs of artisans, village and cottage industries and so expressly certified by\nKVIC/State KVI Boards will also be eligible for the  concessional rate of interest of 12.5% per\nannum. As the advances extended for the above purposes alone would qualify for the\nconcessional interest rate, in case credit limits are sanctioned to these agencies for other\ntrading/manufacturing activities or for building up buffer stocks, it would be necessary  for thebanks to sanction to separate credit limits in respect of the former category of advances eligible\nfor concessional interest rate of 12.5% per annum.\n2.Please acknowledge receipt\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(M.

The Government of India have since advised us that with a view to giving further\nrelief to drought-affected handloom weavers, they have decided to provide margin money to\nState Handloom Development Corporations to raise increased working capital for production of\nhandloom cloth thereby generating higher level of employment to handloom weavers in drought-\naffected areas.

With the recent enlargement of the scope of village industries that can\nbe assisted by KVIC, the need for a further step up of institutional credit flow to the sector has\nassumed added urgency. In this context KVIC had brought to out notice the persisting practical\nproblems faced by it in obtaining adequate bank credit for KVI programmes. These issues were\ndiscussed at a meeting Governor had with KVIC Chairman on  8 June 1988. In the light of the\ndeliberations of the meeting, it has been decided that banks should take action on the lines\nindicated below :\ni)It was indicated in our circular dated 13 November 1982 referred to above that the\nassessment of credit requirements of the various KVIBs at the state level and other\nassociate/implementing institutions (societies) by KVIC under its Interest Subsidy Scheme\nshould, by and large, be acceptable to banks. KVIC has informed that in a number of cases, the\nbanks are still not following these instructions and are allowing only limits for much lower\namounts. In this connection we are advised that KVIC assesses the credit requirements of its\nimplementing agencies after taking into account various relevant aspects, including the\nassistance to be provided by KVIC itself. It should, therefore, be feasible for banks to be\ngenerally guided by the assessment of KVIC. Cases where banks have a divergent view should\nbe settled expeditiously by mutual consultation.\nii)It is also reported that there is undue delay in sanctioning credit limits by banks to the\nKVIC s units and very often the applications for credit limits take upto 9 months or even more\nfor disposal. Banks are advised to ensure that credit proposals from the KVIBs and  other\nassociate/ implementing agencies of KVIC are disposed of within 8-9 weeks in any case.\niii)KVIC has complained that banks insist that the b orrowing units under KVI sector should\ndeposit the original title deeds of their properties as security. It was explained by the KVIC\nofficials that these documents are deposited by the implementing agencies with KVIC which is\nwilling to execute a  letter of disclaimer of prior rights  and that such a letter is tantamount to\nconceding first charge on the properties. They also stated that some of the banks have accepted\nsuch letters of disclaimer in lieu of deposit of original title deeds. We advise that other banks\nmay also examine the matter and accept the letter of disclaimer if they are satisfied after looking\ninto the legal aspects.\n2.We shall be glad if you will please issue necessary instructions in this regard to your\ncontrolling offices and branches urgently.3.Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(P. K. Parthasarathy)\nChief Officer\nRPCD. No.PLNFS.BC.6/PS.72/88-89 July 30, 1988\nSravana 8, 1910\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\nDear Sir\nCredit Assistance to Small Scale Industries (SSI) Sector\nAs you are aware, there has been progressive increase in banks assistance to SSI sector over the\nyears. However, reports continue to flow regarding delay in sanction/inadequacy of working\ncapital, lack of effective co-ordination between commercial banks and State Financial\nCorporations, etc. The Chairmen/Chief Executives of banks are requested to pay special attention\nto the credit requirements of small scale industries and take immediate action on the  following\naspects in particular.\n2.Timely Sanction of  Working  Capital limits\nWith a view to facilitating timely sanction of adequate credit facilities, it is essential that branch\nmanagers are vested with sufficient discretionary powers so that most of the credit decisions are\ntaken at the branch level itself. For this purpose, banks may review the existing delegation of\npowers at branch and regional levels and also ensure that officers with requisite  background and\nadequate delegated powers are posted to branches located in areas having potential for growth\nand development of small scale industries or with concentration of small scale units. It is\nnecessary to enforce strict time discipline in dealing with all priority sector credit proposals,\nincluding those received from SSI sector. The practice of issuing an acknowledgement with date\nof receipt for all loan applications received should be enforced in all branches. After the receipt\nof the application, a definite date may be indicated to the applicant for discussion, clarifications,\netc. if considered necessary. The banks  decision regarding credit assistance should be\ncommunicated to the applicant within the prescribed period (8-9 weeks) from the date of receipt\nof the application, as per guidelines already issued. For monitoring the timely disposal of cases,\nbanks should introduce an appropriate system. The Regional Managers should review the cases\nevery month. Further, credit proposals of small scale units not decided within three months from\nthe date of receipt should be reported on a quarterly basis to the Boards of Directors for review\nand effective follow up action. It should be ensured that all branches maintain the prescribedregisters for recording the dates of receipt and disposal of loan applications, with full details in\nproper manner.\n3.Adequacy of Working Capital Sanctioned by Banks\nIt is reported that often the branch officials reduce the working capital levels, presumably on the\nground that the new unit will require full credit limits only when it begins operating at its full\ncapacity. However, undue delays are reported in subsequently enhancing the credit limits to\nsupport the increasing level of operations, causing avoidable hardship to the units. Banks are,\ntherefore, advised that the full working capital limits determined on the basis of  need  related to\nthe rated capacity of the unit, may be sanctioned at the commencement itself, adding a\ncontingency provision of say  10 per cent to take care of unforeseen circumstances due to\noperational bottlenecks etc. The branches should be flexible and realistic in permitting operations\non the limits sanctioned. As drawals  on working capital limits are ordinarily related to drawing\npower based on value of stocks/receivables, etc. it should be possible for branches to regulate the\noperations in the accounts consistent with the actual requirements and the contingencies which\nmay arise Within the limits sanctioned, drawals  should be allowed automatically to match the\nincreasing levels of operations, if the conduct of account is satisfactory. Requests for increase in\nlimits should be considered expeditiously and decisions taken promptly, and in any case, within\n6 weeks.\nBanks are aware that Reserve Bank has prescribed simplified formats for application to be filled\nin by intending borrowers as also interview-cum-appraisal forms for assessing term loan and\nworking capital needs of small scale units, tiny units etc. The functionaries at the branch level\nmay be advised to extend necessary assistance to the intending borrowers in completing the\nforms and related aspects.\nTo ensure that rejections or reduction of limits are done after due consideration, the following\nprocedure should be adhered to :\na)rejection of applications for fresh limits/enhancement of existing limits should not be\ndone without the approval of the next higher authority.\nb)sanction of reduced limits should be reported to the next higher authority immediately\nwith full details for review and confirmation.\n4.Co-ordination Between Commercial Banks and State Financial  Corporations\n(SFCs)\nReserve Bank of India has issued detailed guidelines regarding joint/simultaneous appraisal of\nprojects by commercial banks and State Financial Corporations, or acceptance of the SFCs\nappraisal by the commercial banks wherever joint appraisal has not been possible. The guidelines\nalso require that working capital assistance should be sanctioned by banks at least 4 months\nbefore a unit goes on stream. In this connection, we refer to Governor s D.O. letter\nNo.DBOD.MC.52/C.808/88 dated 15 March 1988 addressed to the Chairmen of all public sector\nbanks and DBOD Chief Officer s D.O. Letter No. DBOD. MC.55/C.808/88 dated 19 March\n1988 addressed to Chairmen of all private sector banks and advise that banks are required toformulate effective monitoring system for ensuring that projects approved by State level\nfinancial institutions are sanctioned the needed working capital finance well in time. All the\nbanks are required to incorporate the systems devised by them for this purpose in their Annual\nAction Plans. In the guidelines issued in IECD circular letter No.PMS.150/ C.446(PL)-86/87\ndated 8 December 1986 banks have been advised that they should establish necessary rapport\nwith the State level financial institutions and associate themselves with the meetings convened\nby the latter to resolve the cases of delay in sanction of working capital.\nWe further advise that the State Level Inter- Institutional Committees ( SLIICs) which are\nrequired to meet once in 3 months, should also include as a regular item on the agenda, the\nparticulars of cases where SFC-assisted units are not able to get working capital finance from\ncommercial banks. SFCs are also being advised in this regard. The concerned banks whose cases\nwill be taken up for discussion would be invited to attend the meetings of the SLIICs even if they\nare not regular members of the forum.\n5.Rehabilitation of Sick SSI Units\nIt is of the utmost importance to monitor closely the working of tiny and small scale units and to\ntake timely remedial action when signs of incipient sickness are found (vide paragraph 3 of our\ncircular letter RPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.48/SIU.20-87 dated 6 February 1987). Banks are advised\nthat in respect of all SSI units classified as sick as on 30 June 1988, viability studies should be\ncompleted before 31 October 1988 and in the case of all units considered as potentially viable,\nnursing programmes should be formulated and implemented before 31 December 1988. The\nbanks should submit brief reports in this regard to Rural Planning and Credit Department,\nCentral office before 30 November 1988 regarding the completion of viability studies, and\nbefore 31 January 1989 in respect of initiating nursing programmes for potentially viable units.\nThese brief progress reports are not intended to replace the half-yearly returns prescribed for\nmonitoring the progress of rehabilitation of sick SSI units (State-wise and Industry-wise).\n6.Periodical Reports to the Boards of Banks with Respect to Credit Assistance to SSI\nSector\nUnder the current guidelines, banks are required to apprise their Boards of Directors of the\nposition of credit assistance to priority sector at least on a half-yearly basis. Banks are now\nadvised that they should, in addition, put up separate half-yearly reports to the Boards reviewing\nthe position of application for financial assistance from the SSI sector, assistance granted to the\nSSI sector, comprehensively covering, among others, overall progress, State-wise and industry-\nwise details, position of sick units and follow-up action taken, complaints and grievances\nredresal , delays in sanction, etc.\n7.You will agree that it is a matter of serious concern that complaints are continuously\nbeing received from important quarters regarding non-observance and non-compliance, at the\nfield level, of the various guidelines issued. It should be made the responsibility of the\ncontrolling offices (Zonal/ Regional Offices) to ensure compliance with the guidelines by the\noffices in their jurisdiction. The non-observance of the guidelines/instructions at the field level\nshould be seriously viewed and appropriate action taken in cases of dereliction. We look to theChairmen/Chief Executives of the banks to ensure effective compliance with directives and\nguidelines issued in this behalf.\n8.Please acknowledge receipt of this letter to the Chief Officer, Rural Planning & Credit\nDepartment at the address given above.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(P.

A copy of the relevant circular letter No.F1.27/87-88 dated 13 may\n1988 addressed by IDBI to the Managing Director of SFCs/twin function Small Industrial\nDevelopment Corporations ( SIDCs) is enclosed for your information and guidance.\n2.This Scheme is intended to overcome the difficulties and delays experienced by tiny and\nsmall scale industrial units assisted by SFCs/twin function SIDCs in securing timely and\nadequate working capital finance from banks. It would enable SFCs and twin function SIDCs to\nprovide, through a single window, both term loan for acquisition of fixed assets and working\ncapital for inventory to new tiny and small scale units, whose project cost does not exceed Rs. 5\nlakhs and total working capital requirement at the normal level of operations is upto Rs. 2.5\nlakhs. The facility would enable SSI units to start commercial production expeditiously. Besides\nproviding term loan for acquiring fixed assets, SFCs/SIDCs will also now simultaneously\nprovide working capital facility upto Rs.2.5 lakhs in such cases.\n3.Item 15 of the Annexure to the IDBI circular explains the mechanism through which the\nSingle Window Scheme is to be operated by SFCs/SIDCs. It has been envisaged that the assisted\nunits would open a current account with a designated bank branch to which the proceeds of the\nworking capital loan would be credited as and when disbursed by SFC/SIDC. In this connection\ncommercial banks may please follow the  undernoted guidelines :a)The designated branch will maintain the current account of the unit and forward a copy of\nthe monthly statement of account to the borrower as also to the SFC/SIDC concerned. The\nresponsibility for monitoring the value of stocks, scrutiny of stock statements, inspection,\nrecoveries, etc. would rest with the concerned SFC/SIDC. The banks could recover their usual\ncharges from the borrower for maintaining the current account and related items of work.\nb)The borrower under the Scheme has the option to approach the designated bank for\nmeeting the existing and/or additional working capital requirement at any time after availing of\nthe initial working capital assistance under Single Window Scheme. In case the bank agrees to\nthe proposal, it will have to meet the unit s entire working capital needs including the working\ncapital assistance provided by SFC under the Single Window Scheme which will be immediately\nextinguished out of the assistance so provided by the bank . To enable the bank to consider the\nunit s request for assistance, the SFCs/SIDCs have already been advised by IDBI to send a copy\nof their appraisal note to the designated bank as soon as possible, after sanction of assistance by\nthem. We advise that the commercial banks may sanction, on merits, need-based working capital\nassistance to such units in consultation with and with the consent of the concerned SFC/SIDC.\nc)Units availing both term loan and working ca pital finance under the Single Window\nScheme from SFCs/SIDCs may also  require facilities like opening of Letters of Credit,\nBills/Cheques discounting, etc. which are normally not provided by SFCs/SIDCs. Hence these\nunits may approach banks for such facilities. Banks may consider such requests for these types of\nfacilities, as and when received from units and/or SFCs/SIDCs, taking such precautions and\nsecurity as they think necessary in each case, subject to the existing guidelines for priority sector\nadvances. In this connection, we are advised by IDBI that the SFC/SIDC concerned would have\nno objection to the borrowing units creating a charge on the book debts or the current assets\nfinanced under such facilities in favour of the commercial banks and that the security envisaged\nfor the working capital loan by the SFC/SIDC already excludes book debts from its charge.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(P.

In pursuance of the above\nannouncement, IDBI has finalised the Single Window Scheme as per particulars given in the\nAnnexure. The Scheme comes into force with immediate effect.\n2.The salient features of the Scheme are as follows :\ni)New tiny and small units whose cost of project (excluding working capital margin) does\nnot exceed Rs. 5 lakhs and total working capital requirement at the normal level of operations is\nupto Rs. 2.5 lakhs would be eligible for assistance under the Scheme, provided the unit has been\nsanctioned term loan for fixed assets and loan for working capital by the same SFC/twin function\nSIDC.\nii)The repayment period of the working capital  loan would be upto 10 years including\ninitial moratorium upto 3 years.\niii)IDBI would provide 100% refinance in respect of such loans under ARS, and outside the\nannual BPRF limits.\niv)The spread available to SFCs/twin function SIDCs in respect of such loans would be\nhigher at 4.5%.\n3.The Scheme, which has been finalised in consultation with RBI, is intended to overcome\nthe difficulties and delays presently experienced by tiny and small scale units assisted by\nSFCs/twin function SIDCs in securing timely and adequate working capital finance from banks.\nAs SFCs/twin function SIDCs themselves can, under the Single Window Scheme, now also\nprovide working capital assistance to the eligible units, it is expected that such units would be\nable to start commercial production on a viable basis expeditiously.\n4.We may further add that with the introduction of the above Scheme, the existing\nIntegrated Term Loan Scheme stands withdrawn. At the same time the Composite Loan Scheme,\npresently being operated through SFCs/SIDCs and banks under which loans upto Rs. 50,000 are\nprovided to units in the tiny and decentralised sectors covering their needs of fixed assets and/or\nworking capital will continue to remain in force.\n5.Looking to the liberal facilities provided u nder the Single Window Scheme, we are sure\nthat SFCs/twin function SIDCs would take maximum advantage of the Scheme in the interest of\nhealthy and viable growth of tiny and small industries.\nYours faithfullySd/-\n(R.

In the former case, as and when the\nassistance is sanctioned, the working capital\nloan from the SFC should be repaid out of the\nproceeds of the loan sanctioned by the bank.\nThe SFC in turn should immediately thereafter\nrelease its charge on current assets and also\nconcede second charge on fixed assets if so\ninsisted upon by the bank.\nd) To facilitate smooth interaction between the\nSFC/IDC and the designated bank as also to\nenable the bank to consider borrowing unit s\nrequest for assistance, the SFC/IDC should\nforward a copy of its appraisal to the bank soon\nafter the loans are sanctioned by it.\ne) SFC/IDC should monitor the operations in\nworking capital account by obtaining monthly\nstatements from the bank for operations in the\ncurrent account as well as monthly stock\nstatements from the assisted units showing the\nposition of inventory level.RPCD.No.PLNFS.BC.76/PS.72/88-89 February 25, 1989\nPhalguna 6,1910\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\nDear Sir\nOwnership of Units - Two or more Undertakings Under the Same\nOwnership- Status  of the Unit\nAs you are aware, the criterion for classifying an industrial unit under small scale category is its\ninvestment in plant and machinery. Government of India, Ministry of Industry has now advised\nthat if an industrial undertaking/proprietor/partner sets up two or more units within the same\nState or outside, whether manufacturing similar or different items, the fixed investment in plant\nand machinery of all such units is to be clubbed together for determining the SSI status of the\nunits. It has also been clarified by Government, that investment of the industrial undertaking as a\nwhole is to be clubbed and not to the extent of the share of a partner. We, therefore, advise that\nwhere the aggregate investment in plant and machinery of such  related  units exceeds the\nprescribed limit they should not be treated as small scale industrial undertakings.\n2.We also invite a reference to our circular RPCD.No.PS.BC.37/ C.464(A)-83 dated 16\nJune 1983 wherein banks were advised that industrial units which are subsidiaries of or owned or\ncontrolled by medium and large scale undertakings have been taken out of the purview of the\ndefinition of small scale and ancillary industries. Such units also will not be considered as small\nscale units for the purposes of bank credit. Consequently, advances granted to the units in two\ncategories referred to above should be immediately taken out of the purview of SSI sector. They\nwill also not be eligible to be classified as priority sector advances.\n3.The guidelines for pr iority sector including margins, rates of interest and norms for\nrehabilitation of sick SSI units will not be applicable to these units.\n4.We shall be glad if you will please take steps to implement the above instructions with\nimmediate effect.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(S.

A copy of the Scheme is enclosed.\n2.The coverage of the Scheme, which was originally operated through the agency of\nnationalised banks, was extended in July 1988 to State Bank of India and specified State\nFinancial Corporations ( SFCs)/State Industrial Development Corporations ( SIDCs) in the  North\nEastern Region  and Hilly States of Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. In this\nconnection. I enclose a copy of letter No. RPCD.PLNFS.BC.44/SSI-70-88/89 dated November\n15, 1988 addressed by Reserve Bank of India to all public sector banks. In consultation with the\nGovernment of India, we have since decided to extend the Scheme to Associate Banks of SBI as\nwell. They would be functioning as operating agency under the Scheme. A copy of the format for\nexecution of the agency agreement with IDBI is enclosed. I would request your bank to kindly\napproach the nearest Regional/Branch office of IDBI for this purpose.\n3.It is envisaged under the Scheme that the banks while providing assistance from out of\nNEF should simultaneously sanction requisite term loan and working capital facilities so as to\nensure that the entire financial requirements of the borrowers are met from a single source. You\nmay bring this aspect specifically to the notice of the Offices which would be operating the\nScheme at the regional/ branch level. We are allocating an annual limit of Rs.50 lakhs (Rs.

Presently, we are also separately calling for a return\nfrom all the NBFCs holding public deposits of Rs. 20 crore and above for the purpose of\nmonetary aggregates.  However, there are certain parameters on which information is not\navailable in any of the present  returns, which however is essential for addressing\nsupervisory concerns and for picking up the early warning signals of deterioration in\nfinancial health of companies especially those holding substantial public deposits.\nAccordingly, a separate format for closer monitoring of NBFCs holding public deposits of\nRs. 20 crore and above, has been devised  under direction of  the Board for Financial\nSupervision (BFS),  so  that the aberrations, if any, should be brought to the notice of the\nBank at the earliest possible opportunity for initiating timely supervisory action in  discharge\nof the  statutory responsibilities cast on the Bank.   The following operational guidelines are\nissued in this regard.\n(i)The return has been named as \u2018Supervisory and Monetary Return\u2019 and is numbered as\nNBS-5. The return is to be submitted by all the NBFCs including RNBCs, holding public\ndeposits of Rs. 20 crore and above as at the end of quarters ending June, September,\nDecember and March.  This replaces the existing return named as \u201c Quarterly Return on\nAssets and Liabilities of Large NBFCs\u201d  on monetary aggregates being submitted by\ncompanies holding pubic deposits of Rs. 20 crore and above.\n(ii)The return comprises of four parts viz. Part \u2013 1, ( Company\u2019s profile in brief), Part-2\n(Monetary Data), Part-3 (Supervisory Data) and Part-4 (Supervisory Comments).  Part-1, 2\nand 3 are to be filled in by the companies themselves and submitted to the ROs whereas Part-\n4 is to be appended and filled in by ROs.  ROs  should also verify / check the particulars\nsubmitted by the companies.\n(iii)Copies of the return may be forwarded to all the companies under your jurisdiction as\nidentified on the basis of the last return on liquid assets submitted by them; by individually\naddressing a letter to  each such company indicating that the return for the quarter has to be\nsubmitted latest by the 10th of the month succeeding the quarter positively.  The first such\nreturn may be submitted for the quarter ended September 2000.  Though some companies\nmight have submitted the information as per the old return, a fresh return may be called from\nthem.(iv)Monitoring Groups of two Officers each in Grade B/C for monitoring the affairs of 5\nNBFCs or less having public deposits of Rs. 20 crore or above may  be constituted at the RO\nwith the number of Groups depending on the number of such companies. The officers to be\nidentified for this purpose should, preferably have (a) either inspected the company or any\nother company having similar nature of business; (b) have supervisory experience in the\nbanking or non-banking sector and (c) have skills in analysis of data and off-site monitoring.\nHowever, it may please be noted that monitoring of the companies by officers as members of\nthe Monitoring Group will be in addition to their regular duties and not in replacement\nthereof.\n(v)The Monitoring Groups should monitor the timely receipt of the return from each\nNBFC, scrutinise it for internal consistencies, tabulate the data for comparison of\nperformance vis-a-vis the previous quarter, interpret according to the regulatory framework\nand ascertain the supervisory concerns, if any. The Group should add their comments on the\nconcerns arising out of the functioning of the company, observations on the compliance of\nthe inspection findings, advices / guidelines / instructions issued, if any by the Bank, to the\ncompany and the proposed course of action to set right the irregularities.\n(vi)The Regional Director may be kept informed of the developments more particularly in\nrespect of the weak and problem NBFCs. The Regional - in-Charge may hold discussions\nwith the CEO of the companies, wherever necessary, before arriving at his conclusions so\nthat a fair view can be taken.  The return of each such company along with the comments of\nthe Regional-in-Charge should thereafter be submitted to the Regional Director.\n(vii)A copy of the return put up to the Regional Director with comments of Monitoring\nGroup should be simultaneously sent to concerned CMD pending perusal by the Regional\nDirector at Central Office so as to reach by 20th of the month  over the Wide Area Network.\n(viii)The views of Regional Director may be forwarded by Regional Office to Central\nOffice as soon as possible so that they can be taken into account before finalising the course\nof action at the level of Central Office.\n(ix)The Regional Offices would monitor receipt of the return from all the companies\nfalling in their jurisdiction, follow up with them for timely submission of the return. The\nintention of Central Office is that the returns are received at Central Office by 20th of the\nmonth following the quarter so that a report is placed before the Board for Financial\nSupervision in their meeting in the same month or the succeeding month.\n2.Please acknowledge receipt and confirm action indica ting the number of companies\nidentified for the purpose, the names of team members of the Monitoring Group(s) for each\nof the company and endorse a copy of the advice issued to each NBFC for submission of the\nreturn, as stipulated. In case you have suggestions, you may apprise us of the same at the\nearliest to enable us to take a  uniform decision with the approval of higher authorities.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(D.S.Nagi)General Manager\nEncl: Form No. NBS-5", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/17313.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 17, 2000", "info": "Foreign Exchange Management (Foreign Currency Accounts by a Person Resident in \nIndia) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2000 \n \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \n(EXCHANGE CONTROL DEPARTMENT) \nCENTRAL OFFICE \nMUMBAI \u2013 400 001 \n \nNotification No.FEMA 30 /2000-RB \ndated November  17, 2000 \n \nForeign Exchange Management (Foreign Currency Accounts by a Person Resident in \nIndia) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2000 \n \nIn exercise of the powers conferred by clause (b) of Section 9 and clause (e) of sub-\nsection (2) of Section 47 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999), and in partial modification of its notification No.FEMA 10/2000-RB dated 3\nrd May, 2000, the Reserve \nBank of India makes the following Regulations to amend the Foreign Exchange Management (Foreign Currency Accounts by a Person Resident in India) Regulations, 2000, namely:- \n \n1.

BC.\n201/07.01.279/2000-01 dated 10th October, 2000. As indicated therein, the guidelines on banks\u2019\ninvestments in shares and financing of equities have been finalised based on the feed back received\nfrom banks and other market participants on the draft guidelines earlier issued by RBI. These are\ngiven below for compliance by banks :\n2. Ceiling on banks\u2019 investments in shares and debentures\n(i) In terms of circular DBOD No.Dir.BC.61/13.07.05/94 dated May 18, 1994, banks are free to\nacquire shares, convertible debentures of corporates and units of equity-oriented mutual funds,\nsubject to a ceiling of 5 per cent of the incremental deposits of the previous year. As recommended\nby the RBI-SEBI Technical Committee, it has been decided that within the overall exposure to\nsensitive sectors, a bank\u2019s exposure to capital market by way of investments in shares, convertible\ndebentures and units of mutual funds (other than debt funds) through primary or secondary markets\nshould not exceed 5 per cent of the bank\u2019s total outstanding domestic credit (excluding inter-bank\nlendings  and advances outside India) as on March 31 of the previous year.\n(ii) It is clarified that the ceiling for investments in shares, etc., as stated in the above paragraph is\nthe maximum permissible ceiling and a bank\u2019s Board of Directors is free to adopt a lower ceiling\nfor the bank, keeping in view its overall risk profile. In respect of those banks where the present\noutstanding investments in equities are relatively small and well below the above overall ceiling, as\na prudential measure, the Board should also lay down an annual ceiling for fresh investments in\nequities so that any increase in fresh investments in equities takes place in a phased, gradual and\ncautious manner, within the overall absolute ceiling fixed by the Board.\n(iii) Banks may make investment in shares directly taking into account the in-house expertise\navailable within the bank as per the investment policy approved by the Board of Directors subject to\nthe risk management and internal control guidelines indicated in paragraph 7.\n(iv) Banks may also make investment in units of UTI and SEBI approved other diversified mutual\nfunds with good track records as per the investment policy approved by the Board of Directors.\nBanks should make investments in specific schemes of mutual funds / UTI and not place funds with\nmutual funds / UTI for investments in the capital market on their behalf.\n(v) Underwriting commitments taken up by the banks in respect of primary issues through book\nbuilding route would also be within the above overall ceiling.2\n(vi) Investments in shares and debentures / bonds should as hitherto, be reckoned for the purpose of\narriving at the prudential norm of single borrower and borrower- group exposure ceilings, as\nstipulated in our circular DBOD. No. BP. BC 132/66-89 dated 26th May,1989.\n(vii) Credit substitutes like Commercial Paper, non-convertible debentures, etc., may not be\nreckoned as part of credit portfolio for arriving at the ceiling on bank\u2019s investments in shares and\ndebentures.\n(viii) Banks whose investments in shares, etc., are now in excess of the above overall ceiling may\nbring down their investments gradually to conform to the ceiling, by March 31, 2001.\n3. Financing of Initial Public Offerings ( IPOs)\n(i) Banks may grant advances for subscribing to IPOs to individuals. The maximum amount of\nfinance that can be extended to an individual against IPOs should be Rs.10 lakh, as applicable to\nadvances against physical shares. The other terms and conditions for financing of IPOs (including\nthe minimum margin of 50 per cent and 25 per cent against physical and dematerialised  shares,\nrespectively) should be the same as those applicable to advances against shares to individuals, set\nout in our Master Circular DBOD.No.Dir.BC.90/ 13.07.05/1998 dated August 28, 1998. The\ncorporates should not be extended credit by banks for investment in other companies\u2019 IPOs.\nSimilarly, banks should not provide finance to NBFCs for further lending to individuals for IPOs.\n(ii) Finance extended by a bank for IPOs should be reckoned as an exposure to capital market.\n4. Issue of guarantees on behalf of brokers\nIn terms of our above Master Circular dated 28th August, 1998, banks are free to determine the\nmargin to be maintained for issue of guarantees on behalf of share brokers, as per the loan policy\napproved by their Boards. It has now been decided that a minimum margin of 25 per cent inclusive\nof cash margin, should be obtained by banks for issue of guarantees on behalf of share brokers.\nBanks may, at their discretion, obtain margin higher than 25 per cent as per the policy approved by\ntheir Board of Directors.\n5. Advances against shares and debentures to individuals and share brokers and market\nmakers:\n(i) Advances to individuals :\nThe terms and conditions relating to financing of individuals against shares and debentures, viz.,\nmaximum amount of finance of Rs. 10 lakh and Rs. 20 lakh against physical and dematerialized\nshares with a minimum margin of 50 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, formulation of a lending\npolicy by the Board, laying down an aggregate limit for advances against shares to individuals, etc.,\nset out in the Master circular dated 28th August, 1998 would remain unchanged.\n(ii) Advances to share brokers:\nAs set out in the Master circular dated 28th August ,1998, banks are free to provide need based\noverdraft facilities / line of credit to share brokers and market makers against shares and debentures\nheld by them as stock-in-trade after making a careful assessment of the requirements for finance\ntaking into account the financial position of the borrower, operations on his own account and on\nbehalf of clients and other relevant factors indicated therein. Banks are also free to grant working\ncapital facilities to stock brokers registered with SEBI, to meet the cash flow gap between delivery\nand payment for DVP transactions undertaken on behalf of institutional clients. As indicated3\ntherein, banks may decide on the basis of their commercial judgement, the quantum as well as\nmargin on the finance provided to the stock brokers and market makers.\n(iii) Advances to corporates for meeting promoters\u2019 contribution, bridge loan against expected\nequity flows, etc:\nLoans sanctioned to corporates  against the security of shares for meeting promoters\u2019 contribution to\nthe equity of new companies in anticipation of raising resources and bridge loans sanctioned to\ncompanies for a period not exceeding one year against expected equity flows/issues, expected\nproceeds of non-convertible debentures, external commercial borrowings, GDRs and/or funds in the\nnature of foreign direct investments, (which are now within the ceiling of 5 per cent of the\nincremental deposits of the previous year in terms of Master Circular dated 28th August, 1998 and\nCircular DBOD.No.DIR.BC.2/13.07.05/99 dated 29th January, 1999, respectively), would continue\nto be within the overall ceiling stipulated in paragraph 2 above.\n6. Conformity with provisions of Banking Regulation Act ,1949:\n(i) The bank\u2019s exposure by way of investment in shares and advances against shares\nshould meet the statutory requirements regarding holding of shares of a company contained in\nsections 19(2) and (3) and 20(1)(a) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, as also the single\nborrower and borrower-group exposure norms stipulated by the RBI.\n(ii) The other terms and conditions contained in the Master Circular dated 28th August, 1998 remain\nunchanged.\n7. Risk Management and internal control\n Banks desirous of making investments in equity shares, etc. within the above ceiling and financing\nof equities, should observe the following guidelines:\na) Build up adequate expertise in equity research by establishing a dedicated equity research\ndepartment, as warranted by their scale of operation,\nb) Formulate a transparent policy and procedure for investment in shares, etc,\nc) The decision in regard to individual investments in shares, etc., should be taken by the\nInvestment Committee set up by the bank. The Investment Committee should be held\naccountable for the investments made by the bank.\nd) Banks should review on an ongoing basis, their investment in shares with a view to\nassessing the risks due to volatility in asset prices.\ne) As a prudential measure, a bank\u2019s exposure to investment in equities whose prices are\nsubject to volatility ( e.g., shares, convertible debentures and units of equity- oriented\nmutual funds) should not normally exceed 20 per cent of its net worth.\nf) The RBI- SEBI Committee in its report has observed that internationally, advances\nagainst shares are also treated as lending to \u2018sensitive sector\u2019 on account of the volatility\nin prices. The Committee has further observed that most of the banks have not laid down,\nas part of their lending policy, any prudential norm on maximum exposure to capital\nmarket, including investments as well as advances against shares. The Committee has\ntherefore, recommended that the Boards of banks should lay down a prudential ceiling on\nthe bank\u2019s total exposure to capital market, keeping in view its overall risk profile.\nAccordingly, in addition to the ceiling of 5 per cent on investments prescribed in\nparagraph 2 ( i), Board of Directors of banks should also fix an overall ceiling on advances\nagainst shares, i.e., financing of IPOs, advances to individuals and share brokers and\nmarket makers, issue of guarantees on behalf of brokers, advances to corporates to meet\npromoters\u2019 contribution, etc.4\ng) The following may be excluded for reckoning the bank\u2019s aggregate exposure by way of\nfinancing of equities:\n i.

An analysis of the bank-wise data furnished by Scheduled Commercial Banks so far, in\nAnnexure A to Form A  revealed certain conceptual deficiencies in the compilation of data on\nforeign currency assets as also in regard to revaluation of foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nIn particular, it has been observed that banks have been reporting the outstanding balances\nconverted at the current exchange rate instead of the revaluation component on account of\nexchange rate changes. In order to enable the banks to furnish required information accurately,\nthe following guidelines are issued for compilation of data in Annexure A :\n\u2022 Banks should provide data in Column 2 on overseas foreign currency assets (as specified in\nfootnote 5 vide circular letter DBOD No. BC. 89/12.01.001/98-99 dated 24 August, 1998) on\nthe basis of actual Nostro balances. As stated in footnote 5, overseas foreign currency assetsinclude i) balances held abroad i.e. the cash component of Nostro account, debit balances in\nACU (US Dollar) account and credit balances with the commercial banks of ACU countries, ii)\nshort-term foreign deposits and investments in eligible securities, iii) foreign money market\ninstruments including Treasury Bills and iv) foreign shares and bonds. This should , thus, ipso\nfacto cover FCNR (B) deposits held in Nostro accounts which have not been swapped into\nrupees, excluding bank credit in India in foreign currency out of such deposits.\n\u2022 For reporting in Column 2,  banks should convert their overseas foreign currency assets\nand bank credit in India in foreign currency in the four major currencies (viz., US dollar, GBP,\nJapanese Yen and DM/Euro) at the FEDAI noon mean rate  on the reporting Friday , as is the\ncase with the conversion of FCNR(B) deposits vide circular DBOD No. BC. 39/12.01.001/95\ndated April 05, 1995.\n\u2022 In case of currencies other than the four major currencies, banks could use cross currency\nrates through the US dollar, using New York closing rates on the FXXZ screen on the Reuters\nscreen ; and\n\u2022 In the case of currencies which are not traded in New York, banks could use the cross\ncurrency rates through the US dollar using the Reuter Asian screen or the national currency\nmarket in question.\n\u2022 Banks should, therefore, submit data in Column 2 on FCNR (B) deposits , bank credit in\nIndia in foreign currency and overseas foreign currency assets and overseas borrowings on the\nbasis of the conversion methodology prescribed above. The term 'book value' in column 2 in\nrespect of these four categories of foreign currency assets /liabilities would, therefore,\nrefer to the rupee value arrived at by the conversion method prescribed above. Data on\nother foreign currency assets /liabilities may be provided in Column 2 on the basis of rupee\nvalue in their books.\n\u2022 Banks should calculate their Net Demand and Time Liabilities as the sum total of Column 2\n( as compiled by the conversion methodology prescribed above ) and column 4 in respect of all\nforeign currency liabilities including FCNR (B) deposits and overseas borrowings. The term\n'revaluation value' in column 3 of Annexure A may be defined as the sum of appreciation\n/depreciation and revaluation gains/losses of foreign currency assets /liabilities arising out\non account of exchange rate changes between the current reporting Friday and the\nimmediately preceding reporting Friday. Banks may provide data on the revaluation valueof their FCNR(B) deposits, bank credit in India in foreign currency , overseas foreign currency\nassets and overseas borrowings in column 3. Banks may provide the revaluation value in\ncolumn 3 in respect of other foreign currency assets /liabilities in case data in column 2 are\ninclusive of such revaluation . The data on revaluation value submitted in respect of foreign\ncurrency assets/liabilities in column 3 would not affect the NDTL calculations.\nThe above procedure supercedes the instructions relating to compilation of data in\nrespect of liabilities under EEFC, RFC, ESCROW accounts, foreign credit line under\nPCFC Scheme, credit balance in ACU (US dollar) accounts under column 3 in Annexure\nA, vide circular DBOD No.BC.10/12.01.001/98-99 dated 15 February 1999.\n\u2022 For reporting data in column 3  banks should work out the revaluation value of their\nforeign currency assets (in the form of overseas foreign currency assets and bank credit in India\nin foreign currency)/ FCNR(B) liabilities/overseas borrowings by subtracting the difference in\nbook value (as per prescribed methodology) between two reporting fortnights less current\nvalue of the incremental transactions (illustration is given in the Annexure to this circular).\n3. In Annexure B,  the revaluation of investments for submission of data in column 3 may be\ndone as per the guidelines contained in our circular DBOD No.BP.BC.32/21.04.048/2000-2001\ndated 16 October, 2000.\n4. Accordingly, it has been decided that from the Reporting Friday, December 01 , 2000 all the\nScheduled Commercial Banks in India should submit Form A Returns along with the Annexure\nA & B in the prescribed format as per the revised methodology indicated above.\n5. In case any clarification on compilation etc; of data is needed, you may contact Dr. M.D.\nPatra, Director, Division of Money and Banking, Department of Economic Analysis and\nPolicy, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai  - 400 001 at either at his telephone 022\n266 0529, fax 022 2633186 or e-mail mdpatra@rbi.org.in .\n6.

Mittal)\nGeneral ManagerANNEXURE\nCONVERSION OF NOSTRO BALANCES AND EXCHANGE RATE REVALUATION\nREPORTING FRIDAY 1\nAssume that\n1. A bank has foreign currency assets of one US dollar and one Hong Kong dollar.\n2. The Rupee- US dollar rate works out to Rs.10 and the Hong Kong dollar -US dollar\nrate works out to HKD 2.\nThen,\nStep I : Calculation of Book Value\n1. The book value of the bank's US dollar works out to Rs.10 * 1 = Rs.10.\n2. The book value of the bank's HK dollar works out to 0.5(Rs.10)*1= Rs.5, given that\nthe Hong Kong Dollar -US dollar rate is HKD 2.\n3. The book value of the banks' foreign currency assets works out to Rs.15 (= 10+ 5 ).\nStep 2. Calculation of Revaluation value.\n4. Since this is the base Reporting Friday, revaluation does not arise.\nREPORTING FRIDAY 2\nAssume that,\n1. A bank purchases one more US dollar and one more Hong Kong dollar. Consequently,\nthe banks' foreign currency assets comprise two US dollars and two Hong Kong\ndollars.\n2. The Rupee-US dollar rate depreciates to Rs.20 but the Hong Kong dollar -US dollar\nrate still works out to HKD 2.\nThen,\nStep 1.\n3. The book value of banks' two US dollar works out Rs.40 ( =20*2 )\n4. The book value of banks' two HKD works out Rs.20 { ( =20 * 0.5 )* 2}.\n5. The book value of the banks' foreign currency works out to Rs.60 ( = 40 +20).Step 2. Calculation of Book Vlaue.\n6. The revaluation value may be worked out by subtracting the difference in book value\nas on the two Reporting Fridays less the current value of the incremental transaction.\n7. In case of foreign currency assets held in the US dollar , the difference between the\nbook value as on the two dates works out to Rs.30 ( = 40-10). The current value of the\nincremental US dollar is Rs.20. Hence the revaluation value would work out to Rs.10\n(= 30-20).\n8. In the case of foreign currency assets held in the HK dollar , the difference between\nthe book value as on the two dates works out to Rs15 ( = 20 - 5 ). The current value of\nthe incremental HK dollar is Rs.10. Hence the revaluation value would work out to\nRs.5 (=15-10).\n9. The total revaluation value of the bank's foreign currency assets works out to Rs.15 (=\n10+5 ).\n10. The revaluation value, as computed above , is essentially the sum of the products of\nthe base reporting Friday date 1 quantity of each foreign currency and the difference in\nthe exchange rate of that currency in Rupee between the current reporting Friday date\n2 and the base previous reporting Friday date 1. Mathematically,\nRevaluation Value =\u03a3\u03a3(i (pi2-pi1)xi1,\nWhere , pi2 and pi1 are the exchange rate of foreign currency i in respect of the Indian\nrupee at current reporting Friday date 2 and the previous / base reporting Friday date 1,\nrespectively and xi1 is the quantity of the foreign currency i at the previous /base\nreporting Friday date 1.\nThis holds in all cases.\n11. In our example ,\nIn case of the US dollar , pus2 = Rs.20, p us1 = Rs.10 and x us1 = 1,\nIn case of the HK dollar pHk2 = Rs.10, p Hk1 = Rs.5 and x Hk1 = 1,\nTherefore, Revaluation Value = (i ( pi2-pi1)xi1\n = ( pus2-pus1)xus1 + ( pHk2-pHk1)xHk1\n = (20-10)*1 + (10-5)*1\n = 10+5 = Rs15.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/16823.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 04, 2000", "info": "Statement by Dr.Bimal Jalan, Governor,\nReserve Bank of India on Mid-Term Review of\nMonetary and Credit Policy for the year 2000-2001\nThe Statement on Mid-Term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy\nconsists of three parts: I. Mid-Term Review of Macro-economic and Monetary\nDevelopments in 2000-01; II. Stance of Monetary Policy for the second half of\n2000-01; and III. Financial Sector Reforms and Monetary Policy Measures.\nI.  Mid-Term Review of Macro-economic and\n    Monetary Developments in 2000-01\nDomestic Developments\n2.On the basis of the meteorological reports available upto September\n2000, it has been observed that the south-west monsoon was active and the\nquantum and distribution of rainfall were fairly satisfactory at the aggregate\nlevel.  Of the 35 meteorological sub-divisions, 28 sub-divisions received\nexcess or normal rainfall, which was the same as that of the last year.  As\nsome sub-divisions were affected by deficient rainfall or floods, the agricultural\nout-turn in 2000-01 remains somewhat uncertain.  As of now, the output of\nfoodgrains during the year is expected to remain close to that of last year.\nThe total buffer stock of foodgrains stood at 40.8 million tonnes at the end of\nAugust 2000, which is higher by 38.3 per cent over the stock level of 29.9\nmillion tonnes at the end of August 1999.  The stocks of rice at 13.56 million\ntonnes are higher by 57.5 per cent, and those of wheat by 27.9 per cent.\nOverall, therefore, the outlook for  agricultural supplies is  comfortable during\nthe year.\n3.The industrial outlook presents a mixed picture. The increase in\nindustrial production during the first four months of the current financial year\nwas lower at 5.4 per cent than 5.9 per cent recorded during the corresponding\nperiod of the previous year.  Manufacturing sector recorded a growth rate of\n5.7 per cent upto July 2000 as compared with 6.7 per cent in the same period\nof last year.  According to the use-based classification, basic goods2\nproduction registered an accelerated growth rate of 4.7 per cent in\ncomparison with 3.8 per cent during the same period of the previous year.\nProduction in consumer goods sector also showed a better performance at\n8.3 per cent compared with 2.5 per cent during the previous year. The\nintermediate goods sector recorded a lower growth of 5.2 per cent against 9.6\nper cent during the previous year. The capital goods sector showed a\nnegative growth of 0.3 per cent so far. The general deceleration observed in\nthe Index of Industrial Production is partly attributable to the Central Statistical\nOrganisation (CSO) incorporating the revised Wholesale Price Index (1993-\n94=100) as the deflator.\n4.The CSO, in their recent release, has placed the real GDP growth in\nthe first quarter (April-June) of 2000-01 at 5.8 per cent as against 6.9 per cent\nobserved in the first quarter of 1999-2000.  Taking the first quarter estimates\ninto account, as per present indications, the real GDP growth during 2000-01\ncan be placed in the range of  6.0 \u2013 6.5 per cent as against the projection of\n6.5 \u2013 7.0 per cent indicated in the April policy statement.\n5.The rate of inflation on a point-to-point basis as on September 23, 2000\nwas 6.06 per cent as against 3.20 per cent a year ago.  On an average basis,\nthe annual inflation rate was at 4.96 per cent as against 4.37 per cent in the\nlast year.  Inflation as measured by rise in Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the\nmonth of August 2000 was 3.99 per cent as compared with 3.15 per cent in\nAugust 1999.  On an average basis, the annual CPI inflation was, however ,\nsubstantially lower at 3.25 per cent as against 10.16 per cent in the same\nperiod of last year.\n6.The contribution to inflation has  primarily arisen from the \u2018fuel, power,\nlight and lubricants\u2019 group, the index of  which recorded an increase of 25.9\nper cent as on September 23, 2000 over the previous year. The increase in\nparticular was in \u2018mineral oils\u2019. This is a consequential impact of the\nsubstantial rise in  international oil prices since September 1999. The increase\nin prices of other items among both the primary articles and the manufactured\nproducts ,  excepting fertilizers, were subdued.  The inflation rate, excluding\nthe effect of price increase in the fuel and petroleum group, works out to only3\n2.44 per cent on a point-to-point basis.  While a close watch has to be kept on\nthe inflation front, and the international oil prices continue to be a matter of\nparticular concern, the overall demand/supply conditions in respect of\nsensitive commodities and manufactured goods remain comfortable. On the\nwhole, as of now, the rate of inflation for the year as a whole is likely to be\nclose to the average of last two years.\n7.Growth of money supply during the current financial year upto\nSeptember 22, 2000 was 6.6 per cent as against 6.8 per cent observed in the\nsame period last year.  On an annual basis (September 22, 2000 over\nSeptember 24, 1999), M 3 growth was lower at 13.6 per cent than 16.3 per\ncent observed in the comparable period of the preceding year. Aggregate\ndeposits of scheduled commercial banks in the current financial year so far\nincreased by Rs.59 ,603 crore (7.3 per cent) as compared with Rs.51,680\ncrore (7.2 per cent) in the same period last year.  Assuming that the strong\ndeposit accretion will continue, the increase in aggregate deposits during the\ncurrent year will be of the order of  Rs.1,25,000 crore as envisaged in the April\npolicy statement.  The monetary expansion during 2000-01 so far, is in the\nexpected trajectory as indicated in the April policy statement, and the\nprojected growth in M 3 for 2000-01 is likely to remain around 15.0 per cent.\n8.Reserve money in the current financial year upto September 29, 2000\nincreased by Rs.688 crore (0.2 per cent) as against an expansion of Rs.3 ,617\ncrore (1.4 per cent) in the comparable period of last year.  Currency in\ncirculation increased by 1.9 per cent as against 3.8 per cent in the\ncorresponding period of the last year.  On an annual basis, currency\nexpansion was 9.9 per cent as against 14.8 per cent in the previous year.\nThere has been a shift in the sources contributing to the reserve money\nexpansion during this year.  During 1999-2000, the reserve money expansion\nwas mainly due to increase in net foreign exchange assets and RBI credit to\ncommercial sector whereas during this year so far, it has been mainly due to\nincrease in net RBI credit to the central government.  There is a sharp decline\nin the RBI credit to commercial sector in the current year. Net foreign\nexchange  assets of RBI in the current financial year have also  declined by4\nRs.2,799 crore as against an increase of Rs.5,219 crore during the same\nperiod last year.  Net RBI credit to the Government, however ,  increased\nsubstantially by Rs.10,588 crore as against Rs.308 crore in the corresponding\nperiod of last year.  On the components side, bankers\u2019 deposits with RBI\ndeclined substantially by Rs.4 ,124 crore (primarily due to reduction in CRR).\nOn the whole, the  reserve money expansion is expected to remain moderate\nand significantly lower than last year.\n9.There has been a significant pick up in the bank credit and other flows\nto the commercial sector from the banking system during the current year.\nScheduled commercial banks\u2019 credit expanded by Rs.30 ,867 crore (7.1 per\ncent) upto September 22, 2000 as against an increase of Rs.11,821 crore (3.2\nper cent) in the previous year.  Food credit increased by Rs.6 ,398 crore as\nagainst Rs.3,716 crore in the previous year.   Non-food bank credit increased\nby Rs.24 ,469 crore (6.0 per cent) as against  an increase of  Rs.8,105 crore\n(2.3 per cent) in the previous year.  Together with the provisional data on\ninvestments in commercial paper, investments in bonds / shares / debentures\nof PSUs and private corporate sector, the flow of resources from scheduled\ncommercial banks to the commercial sector  increased by Rs.26,471 crore\n(5.6 per cent) as against Rs.13,647 crore (3.4 per cent) in the previous year.\nBanks' investments in instruments issued by financial institutions and mutual\nfunds this year increased by Rs.171 crore as against Rs.1 ,773 crore last year.\nTotal resource flow to the commercial sector including capital issues, GDRs\nand borrowings from financial institutions increased by Rs.58 ,838 crore  as\ncompared with Rs.34,235 crore in the previous year.\n10.The sig nificant expansion in resource flow from banks to the\ncommercial sector has occurred despite some evidence of deceleration in the\ngrowth rate of industrial output in the past few months of the current year.\nThe feedback received from select bankers indicates that there have been\npositive increases in stocks of fertilizers, sugar, petroleum and automobiles.\nThere has been some pick up in infrastructure sector and working capital\ngrowth in financing bills receivables.  Export growth has also been higher\nresulting in higher export credit. Data collected internally by RBI on additional5\nlimits of Rs.150 crore and above show a high year-on-year growth in limits for\nmanufacture of silk and synthetic fibres, drugs and pharmaceuticals,\nfertilizers, light engineering, leasing and hire purchase, etc.\n11.The Union Budget for 2000-01 placed the net market borrowings of the\nCentral Government at Rs.76 ,383 crore and gross borrowings at Rs.1,17,704\ncrore.  Upto October 6, 2000, the Central Government, keeping the normal\npace, completed net borrowings of Rs.47 ,026 crore, and gross borrowings of\nRs.77,183 crore.  RBI continued to combine auction issues with acceptance\nby private placement of dated securities of the Government consistent with\nmarket conditions. In the current financial year so far, devolvement and\nprivate placements with RBI amounted to Rs.31 ,977 crore. However, the\nreserve money impact of this remained moderate due to decreases in RBI\ncredit to commercial sector and net foreign currency assets. The commercial\nbanks\u2019 investment in government securities this year showed an increase of\nRs.23,934 crore against an increase of Rs.35,766 crore in the corresponding\nperiod of the previous year.  However, in the aggregate, banks continued to\nhold government securities in excess of SLR prescription by a sizeable\nmargin.\n12.Government of India\u2019s fiscal deficit upto August 2000 this year is\nreported to be significantly lower at Rs.36 ,447 crore representing an\nimprovement by 24.3 per cent compared to last year.  This has been\ncontributed by a substantial increase in revenue receipts of Rs.64 ,523 crore,\nan increase of 27.5 per cent over last year, and a marginal increase of 2.7 per\ncent in expenditure. This is encouraging.  However, two major uncertainties\nwhich may finally affect the budgetary outlook are: the pace of progress in\nrealising the projected receipts from disinvestments, and the budgetary outgo\nto meet the shortfall in the oil pool account.  Notwithstanding these\nuncertainties, it is absolutely essential to contain the borrowing programme\nwithin the budgeted levels.  In fact ,  a reduction in the borrowing programme\nwould be desirable as it would make a positive contribution to keeping the\ninterest rate outlook positive and stable.6\n13.Several initiatives  have been taken recently in regard to the internal\ndebt management policy.  Consequently, there has been a lengthening of  the\nmaturity structure in the last two years. Reissues and price based auctions\nwere also introduced in order to enable consolidation of securities.\nCombining private placement with strategic open market operations whenever\nappropriate, has enabled the conduct of the government borrowing\nprogramme without being unduly disrupted by unanticipated external and\ndomestic developments. An internal debt management policy, however deft,\ncannot continuously handle a widening deficit without serious adverse\nconsequences in the debt market.  It is, therefore, necessary that a strong\nframework is put in place to build up positive expectations on the fiscal front\nand it is hoped that the proposed Fiscal Responsibility Legislation will address\nthis issue.\nExternal Developments\n14.There have been marked changes in the external environment since\nApril 2000 when the annual monetary and credit policy statement was\npresented. During the year 1999-2000, despite a sharp increase in oil prices,\nthe foreign currency assets of India had increased by US $ 5.54 billion, and\nforex markets were generally stable. In the month of March 2000 alone, the\nincrease in foreign exchange reserves was US $ 2.1 billion, and both exports\nand capital flows had registered substantial growth. The subsequent period,\nfrom about mid-May to early August 2000, however, proved to be difficult for\nmanagement of the external sector. Forex markets were affected by\nconsiderable uncertainty with the rupee depreciating against the US dollar by\n3.2 per cent between May 31 and September 29, 2000, and overall foreign\nexchange reserves declining by US $ 1.8 billion. Since the middle of August\n2000, the situation has shown some improvement, and forex markets and\nreserve levels have been relatively stable.\n15.As is well-known, in the very short-run, \u201cexpectations\u201d about the likely\nbehaviour of a currency next day or over a week or fortnight can play a major\nrole in determining its movement against foreign currencies, particularly the\nUS dollar. Given the \u201cbandwagon\u201d effect of any adverse movements, and the7\nherd behaviour of market participants, expectations can often become self-\nfulfilling. This is particularly true of thin developing country market, where net\nvolumes are relatively small. The day to day movement in currency markets is\nfurther complicated by volatility in private capital flows, which are highly\nsensitive to short-term domestic and international developments as well as\nfuture expectations. In view of these and other imponderables, it is not\npossible to come to a definitive conclusion about the relative role of different\nfactors in explaining the behaviour of forex markets in India during May \u2013\nAugust 2000. Some of the factors which had a bearing on developments\nduring this period were:\n\u2022 The increase in US interest rates by 50 basis points in May 2000,\nwhich was followed by hikes in the European interest rate by 50 basis\npoints in June and 25 basis points in August 2000.  The increase in US\ninterest rate in May coming on top of several earlier increases,\nsignificantly reduced the interest differential in respect of holdings in\nUS dollars vis-a-vis Indian rupees.\n\u2022 In April 2000, there was considerable uncertainty about the prospects\nof the US economy. This was reflected, among other things, in the\nsharp drop in equity prices. In April, the NASDAQ index fell by nearly\n25 per cent, which in turn affected equity prices, in all major stock\nexchanges, including the Sensex in India. The US outlook, however,\nchanged dramatically in June/July with an increasing consensus that\nthe US economy was \u201csoft landing\u201d and US growth rates were likely to\nbe sustained at a relatively high level.\n\u2022 In view of the continuing uncertainty about recovery in Japan and the\noutlook for European economies, the US dollar appreciated sharply\nagainst most major currencies. US dollar appreciated by 5.7 per cent,\n2.2 per cent and 0.8 per cent against Euro, Pound-Sterling and\nJapanese Yen, respectively, during the period end-May to end of\nSeptember 2000. US dollar also appreciated by 7.8 per cent against\nThai Baht, 1.7 per cent against Indonesian Rupiah, 8.5  per cent8\nagainst Philippines Peso, and 0.4 per cent against Singapore dollar\nduring the same period.  (It may be noted that, as depreciation of the\nrupee against the US dollar was less than that of several other\ncurrencies, the rupee also appreciated against the Euro and Pound\nSterling from end-May to mid-September by 4.4 per cent and 3.4 per\ncent, respectively. However, rupee depreciated by 1.8 per cent against\nthe Japanese Yen during the same period.)\n\u2022 The price of crude oil imported by India increased further during the\nyear, on top of the sharp increase recorded in the previous year.\nAverage prices of Brent crude in September  2000 were US $ 32.97\nper barrel as compared with  US $ 25.55 in December 1999 and US\n$ 22.51 in September 1999. As a result, there was a substantial\nincrease in the volume of demand for foreign currency by Indian Oil\nCorporation (IOC) and other bulk importers of crude oil.\n\u2022 For various reasons, including some uncertainty about the prospects of\nthe equity market in India, there was a sharp reversal in capital flows\non account of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). In the months May\nto August, 2000, there was a net outflow of US $ 505 million as against\na net inflow of US $ 948  million during the first quarter of the calendar\nyear.\n16.In order to cope with the adverse effects of the above factors, which\npersisted for several weeks, the Reserve Bank had to adopt a combination of\nmeasures. These included: (a) use of foreign exchange reserves to partially\nmeet the excess demand in currency markets, particularly on account of oil\nimports and government debt servicing; (b) increasing the cost of bank\nfinancing for imports and overdue export bills; (c) allowing the exchange rate\nto move in response to the prevailing demand/supply situation; (d) increasing\nthe Bank Rate to pre-April level in order to partially reverse the narrowing of\ninterest differential between dollar/rupee holdings in order to improve inflows.\nIn order to mop up some excess liquidity in the system, CRR was also\nincreased by 0.5 percentage point.  The very short-term Repo and reverse9\nRepo rates were also increased in order to make it less attractive to hold daily\nlong positions in US dollars; and (e) repatriation of 50 per cent of balances\nheld in EEFC accounts, along with reduction in entitlement in respect of\nfurther accretions to these accounts.\n17.It may be argued that a recourse to one or two measures more\nintensively would have been more appropriate, or alternatively the rupee\nexchange rate could have been allowed to depreciate much more sharply and\n\u201cfind its own level\u201d.  Under certain circumstances, depending on availability of\nfirm information on what exactly was causing the turbulence in forex markets,\neither of these positions could be valid. However, while at times the\nunderlying causes of exchange market volatility are easy to diagnose (e.g.\neffects of contagion, sanctions or hostilities at the border), often the precise\ncause and the degree of volatility as well as its duration are difficult to\nestimate or forecast.  Multiplicity of factors, which can also change from time\nto time, and which are often self-fulfilling can influence forex market outcomes\n(e.g., uncertainty of economic outlook, changes in oil prices, behaviour of\nequity markets abroad or movements in the exchange rate of   US dollar vis-\na-vis Euro, or rumours about central bank actions, etc.).  In the situation\nprevailing in our exchange markets during May-August 2000, based on a\ncontinuous analysis of the evolving situations, recourse to a combination of\nmeasures was preferred so that the adverse impact on the rest of the\neconomy could be minimised. A reliance on one or two measures (e.g., sharp\nmonetary tightening or unchecked depreciation of the exchange rate, and/or\nunlimited use of reserves) could have had unacceptable longer term\nconsequences for the economy and the financial system, including a much\ngreater risk of non-reversible destabilisation.\n18.A related issue that has figured in the recent debate on the\nmanagement of the external sector is that it would be appropriate if, during\nperiods of excess capital flows or capital surge (as experienced during some\nmonths in 1999-2000, and also earlier), the rupee was allowed to appreciate\nsubstantially (rather than the RBI absorbing part or whole of the excess\nsupply). From a theoretical point of view, this argument has some merit. If10\nthere were sharp two-way movements in the exchange rate, market operators\nwould be subject to two-way risks rather than being able to take \u201cone-way\u201d bet\nduring periods of excess demand for foreign currency. In reality, however, the\nsituation is somewhat more complicated. It is not clear whether greater\nvolatility in exchange rates, and continuing sharp depreciation within a very\nshort period during periods of excess demand, would stabilise expectations or\ndestabilise currency markets beyond the levels of tolerance.  The world-wide\nexperience of emerging markets is that there is always a greater rush to \u201cget\nout\u201d (when exchange rate is falling sharply) than to \u201cget in\u201d (when exchange\nrate is rising). In countries with a current account deficit, like India, a build-up\nof reserves is also essential to take into account various types of \u201cliquidity\nrisks\u201d associated with different types of flows and other requirements.  As\npointed out in the April policy statement, the recent international experience\nparticularly during the period of East Asian crisis, has highlighted the fact that\nemerging market economies have to largely rely on their own resources\nduring external exigencies as there is no \u201clender of the last resort\u201d to provide\nadditional liquidity at short notice. While two-way movements in currency are\ncertainly desirable and no attempt should be made to provide a \u201cfloor\u201d when\nthere are excess capital inflows, it is necessary to keep the above\nconsiderations in view in order to guard against unexpected contingencies.\n19.A lesson of experience, not only in India but also in other countries, is\nthat, given the nature of foreign exchange markets and uncertainty in the\ndirection of capital flows in a floating rate environment, the situation and\noutlook can change dramatically within short periods and extreme caution and\ncare need to be exercised in the management of the exchange rate and\nforeign exchange reserves.\n20.Looking ahead to the second-half of the current year, there is ne ed for\ncontinued caution and vigilance on the external front in view of several\nuncertainties. Despite the action by OPEC in early September to increase\nsupplies and the action by the United States to release some oil from strategic\nreserve, international prices of crude oil continue to be very high and cast a\nsubstantial burden on oil. Internationally, while growth/inflation outlook in11\nindustrialised countries as a whole remains favourable, the exchange markets\ncontinue to be characterised by sharp volatility and unpredictable movements\n(as revealed, for example, by the sudden depreciation of Euro and Pound\nSterling vis-a-vis US dollar in early September). The behaviour of equity\nmarkets world wide, which in turn influences inflows of foreign capital for\nportfolio investment, is also far from stable, and an unexpected turnaround in\nsuch investments cannot be ruled out.\n21.In coping with these uncertainties, the favourable factors for India are:\ncontinued good performance of exports, particularly software exports; a\ncomfortable level of foreign exchange reserves; a favourable outlook for\nforeign direct investment in certain important sectors (such as, Information\nTechnology and Telecommunications); a relatively low level of external\ncommercial debt, particularly short-term debt; and a positive outlook for\nsustained economic growth. No effort should be spared to take maximum\nadvantage of these positive factors, and to further accelerate the process of\ngrowth with particular emphasis on exports.\n22.Exports have done well during the current year and capital inflows have\nalso increased in the very recent period. India\u2019s exports during the first four\nmonths of the current financial year at about US $ 13.9 billion recorded an\nincrease of over 25.0 per cent  over the exports during the corresponding\nperiod of the preceding year. During the same period, imports at US $ 17.6\nbillion, also increased by about 25.0 per cent compared to 1.1 per cent in the\npreceding year. Of the total imports, oil imports increased by US $ 5.5 billion\n(or nearly 100 per cent) impacted by higher prices. Trade deficit in the first\nfour months of the current financial year was US $ 3.7 billion as against US\n$ 3 billion in the same period last year. However, despite the substantial\nincrease in the oil import bill, increase in exports and invisible receipts is\nexpected to keep the current account deficit for the year 2000-01 at less than\n2.0 per cent of GDP, which is considered reasonably satisfactory.\n23.In the last two years, as  pointed out in the April policy statement,\nseveral measures have been introduced to ensure timely delivery of credit to\nexporters and remove procedural hassles. These measures included12\nprovision of \u2018On Line credit\u2019 to exporters, extension of \u2018Line of Credit\u2019 for\nlonger duration for exporters with good track record, peak/non-peak credit\nfacilities to exporters, permission for interchangeability of pre-shipment and\npost-shipment credit and meeting the term loan requirements of exporters for\nexpansion of capacity and modernisation of machinery and upgradation of\ntechnology. Improvements were also made in the procedure for handling of\nexport documents and fast track clearance of export credit at specialised\nbranches of banks. Similarly, new simplified guidelines were issued for\nsanction of credit facilities for software services, project services and software\nproducts and packages.\n24.In order to ensure that the above procedural and other improvements\nin the credit delivery system were actually reaching the exporters, the\nReserve Bank had also set up a Bankers\u2019 Group at the operational level\n(comprising senior officials from commercial banks and the Reserve Bank).\nThe Group held a number of interactive sessions with exporters as also base-\nlevel officials of the commercial banks at 21 major export centres in the\ncountry in addition to discussions with industry associations. In order to further\nimprove the credit delivery system, the Reserve Bank had invited exporters,\nparticularly those who were located in non-metropolitan centres, to send their\nreactions on whether the new system was working satisfactorily.  They were\nalso requested to send their suggestions for improvement in procedures,\nparticularly those which were designed to reduce paper work without diluting\naccountability.\n25.In response to this request, a number of suggestions, mainly of a\nprocedural nature, were received from export organisations and exporters.\nThese have recently been examined by the Bankers\u2019 Group.  Banks are being\nadvised separately to implement the recommendations of the Group to further\nsimplify the procedures for export credit.\n26.The action taken by the Reserve Bank to reduce accumulated\nbalances and further accretions to EEFC account in August 2000 has no\ndoubt caused some disappointment among exporters. It may be recalled that\nthis account was essentially meant for use by exporters for certain specified13\npurposes to facilitate mostly current account and other permissible payments.\nWhile most exporters were using the scheme for the intended purposes, in the\nrecent period, it was noticed that balances in these accounts were being\nincreased, which added to the magnitude of \u201cleads\u201d and \u201clags\u201d in external\nreceipts.  The Reserve Bank has reviewed  the scheme in the light of previous\nexperience and feedback received from premier export organisations. It is\ndesirable to persevere with the positive feature of the scheme, viz., the\nreduction in the \u201ctransaction\u201d and banking costs for exporters for making\ncurrent account and other permissible payments, while at the same time\nensuring that the scheme is not used for unintended purposes.  The details of\nthe revised EEFC scheme are given in Part III.\n27.In the last two years, a number of changes have also been introduced\nin various schemes for remittances, investment and maintenance of bank\naccounts by Non-Resident Indians ( NRIs) in order to make these special\nfacilities procedurally simple. In April, Reserve Bank had also invited\nresponses from NRIs on the actual working of these simplified procedures,\nand suggestions for further improvement. It is gratifying to note that most of\nthe responses have been highly positive, and no special problems in the\noperation of these schemes have been reported.\n28.In recent months, the Government has taken several initiatives to\nencourage the flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on mutually beneficial\nbasis. Thus, new foreign investment proposal in the IT sector will now be\nentitled to automatic approval irrespective of whether the investor has an\nexisting joint venture or technical collaboration in the country. IT companies\nwith an existing joint venture or a technical collaboration need not henceforth\nseek \u201cno objection certificate\u201d from existing joint venture partners/associates\nto float new business. Government has also permitted foreign equity\ninvestment in micro credit/rural credit activities.  FDI upto 100 per cent has\nbeen allowed for business-to-business e-commerce subject to certain\nconditions.  The upper limit of Rs.1 ,500 crore for FDI in projects of electricity\ngeneration, transmission and distribution (other than atomic reactor power\nplants) has been removed. The level of FDI in oil refining sector under14\nautomatic route has also been raised from the existing 49 per cent to 100 per\ncent. It may be mentioned that \u201cin principle\u201d or prior approval of the Reserve\nBank is no longer required for any FDI proposal as long as it is in conformity\nwith Government guidelines.\n29.Recently, the Government has delegated powers to the Reserve Bank\nto approve External Commercial Borrowings(ECB) upto US $ 50 million under\nthe automatic route, and upto US $100 million on a case-by-case basis. In\norder to avoid recourse to short-term or high-cost ECBs, Government has\nalso laid down certain conditions regarding minimum maturity period and\nacceptable spreads for such borrowings. In respect of ECB proposals under\nthe automatic route, which conform to Government guidelines, prior approval\nof RBI will not be required. The procedure for proposals requiring specific\napproval of RBI is also being simplified.\nII. Stance of Monetary Policy for the\nSecond Half of 2000-2001\n30.On April 1, 2000, the Reserve Bank had announced a number of\nmeasures to enhance liquidity and reduce the cost of funds to banks. These\nmeasures included a reduction in the Bank Rate, CRR and the Repo rate by 1\npercentage point each.  On April 27, 2000, the annual monetary and credit\npolicy statement expressed RBI\u2019s intention \u201cto continue the current stance of\nmonetary policy and ensure that all legitimate requirements of bank credit are\nmet while guarding against any emergence of inflationary pressures due to\nexcess demand.  Towards this objective, the Reserve Bank will continue its\npolicy of active management of liquidity through OMO, including two-way\nsale/purchase of treasury bills, and reduction in cash reserve ratio as and\nwhen required\u201d.  On July 21, 2000, however, RBI increased the Bank Rate by\n1 percentage point and CRR by 0.5 percentage point. Short-term repo rates\nwere also substantially raised in several stages, soon after the introduction of\nLiquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) on June 5, 2000 (these rates have recently\nbeen reduced).  The change in course within four months of the April 115\nreductions in Bank Rate/CRR has elicited a fair amount of comment and\ndebate among experts, market participants and bankers.\n31.It is useful to recall that, while confirming the intention to continue the\nthen prevailing stance of monetary policy, the April policy statement had also\ncautioned that, \u201cit cannot be over- emphasised that the above outlook can\nchange dramatically within a relatively short period of time in the event of\nunanticipated domestic or international events. Several unfavourable events\nthat affected the outlook for the economy during the years 1997 through 1999\npoint to the need to respond quickly and to change course, if and when\nrequired\u201d. Further, it was stated that, \u201cthe Reserve Bank will continue to\nmonitor domestic monetary and external developments, and tighten monetary\npolicy through the use of instruments at its disposal, when necessary and\nunavoidable\u201d. Moreover, banks and financial institutions were specifically\nurged to, \u201cmake adequate allowances for unforeseen contingencies in their\nbusiness operational plans, and take into account the implications of changes\nin the monetary and external environment on their operations\u201d. Thus, the\npossibility of \u201ca change in course\u201d and \u201ctightening of monetary policy\u201d in the\nevent of a change in the domestic or international situation was specifically\nrecognised in the April policy statement. And as it happened, such a change\nof course did indeed become necessary a few months later.\n32.It may also be mentioned that, in the conduct of monetary policy, a\nchange of course in response to the emerging situation is often unavoidable.\nThis has also been the experience of most central banks in developing\neconomies as well as industrialised countries with well developed financial\nsystems.  For instance, the US Federal Reserve reduced  interest rates in\nsuccessive steps from September to November 1998 from 5.5 per cent to\n4.75 per cent, but, revised the stance in June 1999 and hiked the rate in\nsuccessive steps to 6.5 per cent beyond the level at which easing\ncommenced. Similarly, the European Central Bank, which strongly opposed\nthe easing stance till March 1999, actually  reduced  the interest rate by 50\nbasis points in April 1999, but subsequently changed course when new\ninformation became available and hiked the rates in November 1999.  The16\nBank of England which eased the rates in June 1999, reversed its stance and\nhiked the rates in September 1999.\n33.As financial systems become more open and more deregulated, it\nbecomes difficult to anticipate or accurately predict the market behaviour.\nFinancial market conditions, and market actions, in turn can have important\nimpact on macro-economic outcomes in terms of investment, growth, inflation\nor external stability. For example, when markets were highly controlled, bank\ninterest rates were fixed by the Reserve Bank, and credit allocation was\ncentralised, it was possible for monetary policy prescriptions to remain fixed\nfor a long period. As we move towards a more efficient, more competitive and\na more vibrant financial system, it is necessary to accept the fact that\nmonetary instruments will be used more flexibly. It is also essential for market\nparticipants to take greater recourse to appropriate asset-liability and risk\nmanagement techniques in order to take account of the unanticipated\nchanges in monetary conditions and the interest rate outlook.\n34.Apart from the impact of sharp increase in the international prices of\ncrude oil, the domestic inflationary outlook is somewhat uncertain.  As on\nSeptember 23, 2000, the point-to-point inflation in \u201cmanufactured products\u201d\nwhich account for a weight of 63.75 per cent was 2.91 per cent and in\n\u201cprimary articles\u201d accounting for a weight of 22.03 per cent was 1.25  per cent.\nIn fact, the prices of foodgrains declined by 5.44 per cent.  On the supply side,\nstocks of foodgrains at the end August 2000 were at a comfortable level of\n40.8 million tonnes. The low rate of inflation in \u201cprimary articles\u201d and\n\u201cmanufactured products\u201d combined with comfortable stocks of foodgrains are\nsources of comfort in the management of the overall inflationary environment.\nThe M3 growth as on September 22, 2000 was 13.6 per cent which was also\nin line with the projected growth of 15.0 per cent envisaged in the April policy\nstatement and thus, as of now, no undue pressure from the demand side is\nanticipated. However, as mentioned earlier, the external outlook principally in\nrespect of crude oil prices, remains highly uncertain and is a cause of\nconcern.17\n35.Taking the above factors as well as Government\u2019s borrowing\nrequirements into account, as per present indications, liquidity conditions are\nlikely to remain adequate during the rest of the year. The banking system is\nnot expected to face any difficulty in meeting fully the demand for commercial\ncredit  from industrial and other sectors.  The Reserve Bank also stands ready\nto provide appropriate liquidity through its LAF as necessary in order to\nmanage the overall liquidity situation in the economy.\n36.During the rest of the current year, the interest rate outlook would\ncrucially depend on external market conditions, domestic developments in\nrespect of the overall rate of inflation, demand for credit from the commercial\nsector  and Government\u2019s borrowing requirements.  To the extent possible, It\nwill continue to be the endeavour of the RBI to maintain a stable interest rate\nenvironment.  However, as mentioned in the April policy statement, it will be\nprudent for banks and financial institutions to make sufficient allowance for\nunforeseen contingencies, including possible changes in monetary measures,\nin their business operational plans though, as of now ,  Reserve Bank\u2019s policy\nwill continue to be to maintain stable  monetary  conditions.\n37.In the last four months, the LAF introduced since June 5, 2000 has\nbeen effectively used to influence short-term interest rates by modulating day-\nto-day liquidity conditions and to contain volatility in foreign exchange market.\nFor a few weeks, the repo rates were increased sharply and remained high.\nIn the more recent period, they have been brought down to a more\nreasonable level. The LAF would continue to be operated in a flexible manner,\nboth in terms of the applicable rates and tenors, in keeping with the\ndevelopments in financial markets. It may, however, be mentioned that the full\neffectiveness of the LAF is at present constrained by the automatic additional\nliquidity available through refinance and liquidity support facilities to banks\nand primary dealers.18\nIII.    Financial Sector Reforms and\n        Monetary Policy Measures\n38.The rece nt annual Monetary and Credit Policy Statements as well as\nMid-Term Reviews have focussed on structural measures to strengthen the\nfinancial system and to improve the functioning of the various segments of\nfinancial markets.   As pointed out in the April policy statement, the main\nobjectives of these measures have been five-fold: (a) to increase operational\neffectiveness of monetary policy by broadening and deepening various\nsegments of the market; (b) to redefine the regulatory role of the Reserve\nBank in order to make it more efficient and purposive; (c) to strengthen the\nprudential and supervisory norms; (d) to improve the credit delivery system;\nand (e) to develop the technological and institutional infrastructure of the\nfinancial sector.\n39.To meet th e above objectives, a number of measures have been\ninitiated in various areas.  In the following paragraphs, an attempt is made to\nreview briefly the progress made so far in respect of these initiatives and to\nmodify some of them, where necessary.  As far as possible, changes\nproposed, have been decided after extensive consultations with experts and\nmarket participants.  Suggestions made by commentators in media as well as\nspecialised journals have also been taken into account, wherever appropriate.\n40.It is not proposed to make any change in some of the important\nmonetary measures, such as the Bank Rate, the CRR or the LAF.  As\nemphasised in earlier Policy statements, changes in respect of Bank Rate,\nCRR and the Repo Rates (under LAF) will be made as and when necessary,\nand will not necessarily be linked to half-yearly policy statements.\nDevelopment of Money Market\n41.As part of April 2000 policy statement, certain measures were\nannounced to facilitate the development of the Forward Rate Agreements/\nInterest Rate Swaps ( FRAs/IRS) and Certificates of Deposit (CDs).  Similarly,\nthe policy stance relating to call/notice money market and Commercial Paper19\n(CP) had also been indicated.  After a review of the developments, the\nfollowing measures are being introduced :\n(a) Permission to non-banks to lend\n      in the call money market\nFollowing the recommendations of Narasimham Committee II ,  the\nReserve Bank has taken several steps to widen the participation in repo\nmarket such as,  ( i) permission to non-bank participants maintaining current\nand SGL accounts with RBI, Mumbai to undertake both repo and reverse\nrepo; (ii) reduction  in minimum maturity for repo transactions to 1 day; (iii)\nstate government securities being made eligible for undertaking repos; and\n(iv) opening of its purchase window to impart liquidity to government\nsecurities whenever situation warrants.  In the context of improving the\nefficacy of the LAF and to make the money market more efficient and enable\nthe development of a short-term rupee yield curve, as recommended by the\nCommittee, it is necessary to move towards the objective of pure inter-bank\ncall money market as early as possible.  However, considering the fact that\nthe repo market is yet to be broad-based in terms of instruments and\nparticipants and acquire enough depth, it has been decided to extend the\npermission granted to select corporates, which have been given specific\npermission to route call money transactions through Primary Dealers ( PDs)\nwhich is available now upto December 2000 for a further period of six months,\ni.e., upto June 2001.\nIn addition to select corporates  which have been permitted to route call\nmoney transactions through PDs, there are several non-bank institutions such\nas Financial Institutions and Mutual Funds which are currently permitted to\nlend directly in the call/notice money market.  In order to make necessary\ntransitional provisions, in respect of these institutions also, before the call\nmoney market is confined only to banks/ PDs, it has been decided to\nconstitute a Group to suggest a smooth phasing out by a planned reduction in\ntheir access to call/notice money market.  This Group will also include\nrepresentatives of  non-bank institutions.20\n(b) Guidelines for issue of Commercial Paper (CP)\nIt was indicated in the April policy statement that the current guidelines\nfor issue of CP would be modified in the light of recommendations made by an\nInternal Group.  Accordingly, a draft of the revised guidelines as also the\nReport of the Internal Group were circulated in July 2000.  Taking into account\nthe suggestions received from the participants, the guidelines have now been\nfinalised.  A summary of the guidelines is in Annexure I.  Full Text is being\nissued separately.\nThe new guidelines are expected to provide considerable flexibility to\nparticipants and add depth and vibrancy to the CP market while at the same\ntime ensuring prudential safeguards and transparency.  In particular, the\nguidelines will enable companies in the services sector to more easily meet\ntheir short-term working capital needs.  At the same time banks and FIs will\nhave the flexibility to fix working capital limits duly taking into account the\nresource pattern of companies\u2019 finances including CPs.\n(c) Transfer of Certificates of Deposit (CDs)\n.At present, while the minimum maturity period for CDs is fixed at 15\ndays, there is also a restriction that CDs issued by banks and financial\ninstitutions cannot be transferred or transacted in the secondary market\nbefore 15/30 days from the date of issue.  With a view to providing flexibility\nand depth to the secondary market, it is proposed to withdraw the restriction\non transferability period for CDs issued by both banks and financial\ninstitutions.\n(d) Rating Requirement for Term Deposits\n                 Raised by Financial Institutions\nAt present, mobilisation of term deposits by select all-India financial\ninstitutions, which are governed by the Reserve Bank of India guidelines, do\nnot require any rating.  In order to improve the functional efficiency of the\nmarket, it is proposed to make rating mandatory for the term deposits\naccepted by all-India financial institutions with effect from November 1, 2000.21\nDevelopment of Government\nSecurities Market\n42.Important developme nts in respect of the measures announced in the\nApril policy statement are :\n\u2022 It was proposed to introduce a scheme for automatic invocation by the\nSGL Account holder of undrawn refinance/liquidity support from RBI for\nfacilitating smooth securities settlement. Detailed guidelines for\nimplementation of the facility has since been issued.\n\u2022 With a view to facilitating sale of securities allotted in primary issues on\nthe same day, it was proposed to allow the entities which get\nallotments in primary issues to sell the allotted securities on the same\nday.  Relevant instructions have  been issued.\n\u2022 The day of payment in respect of 14 and 91 day Treasury Bills was\nchanged from Saturday to the next working day pending a review after\nsix months. Since the system has been working smoothly, it has been\ndecided to continue with the change of day of payment from Saturday\nto the next working day.\n\u2022 A detailed review of liquidity support to PDs has been undertaken and\nmodifications introduced in the scheme in consultation with them.\nFurther, the commission payment to PDs for auction Treasury Bills has\nsince been withdrawn. A note containing the proposed capital\nadequacy standards for PDs was circulated and suggestions received\nfrom them have been examined and incorporated in the guidelines.\nRevised guidelines are being separately issued to the PDs.\n\u2022 State Bank of India as the chief promoter has constituted a Core\nGroup, which is working on a Report for setting up a Clearing\nCorporation for money, debt and foreign exchange markets. The Core\nGroup is presently engaged in having presentations from different22\nentities with expertise for setting up the proposed Clearing Corporation\nand it would come out with its recommendations shortly.\n43.It is now proposed to intro duce some further measures for\ndevelopment of government securities market :\n(a) Guidelines for Constituents\u2019 SGL Accounts\nCurrently, SGL Account holders are provided the facility to maintain a\nsecond SGL Account called Constituents\u2019 SGL Account in the books of\nReserve Bank of India to enable them to hold government securities on behalf\nof their constituents.  With a view to encouraging investors to hold securities\nin scrip-less form and to ensure that entities holding securities in custody\nemploy practices and procedures so that the constituents\u2019 securities are\nappropriately accounted and kept safe, it has been decided to frame a set of\nguidelines governing the maintenance of the Constituents\u2019 SGL Accounts.\nThe guidelines are being issued separately.\n(b)  Order-driven Screen-based trading\n       in Government Securities\nReserve Bank of India has decided, in principle, to move over in due\ncourse to order-driven screen-based trading in government securities on the\nstock exchange.  Reserve Bank of India would specify the date for switchover\nto order-driven screen-based system in consultation with SEBI.  As and when\nthe date is specified, it will be applicable to all Stock Exchanges on which\nbanks and FIs can operate.\nPrudential Measures\n44.With a view to strengthening the financial position of banks prudential\nnorms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning have been\nimplemented in a phased manner commencing from the accounting year\n1992-93.  The basic principles of these norms were income recognition based\non record of recovery, classification of assets on the basis of uniform and\nobjective criteria and provisioning based on chances of recovery and period\nfor which the assets remain as non-performing asset (NPA).  Further, over23\nthese years emphasis has also been made to move towards adopting the\ninternational best practices in these areas.  Keeping in view the wide-ranging\nand rapid changes taking place in the financial sector, following further\nmeasures are being introduced :\n(a) General Provisions on Standard\n                 Assets as Tier 2 Capital\nThe Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector Reforms had\nobserved that our standards with regard to asset classification in banks were\nliberal and needed to be revised to fall in line with the international best\npractices.  In this connection, the Committee had recommended for a general\nprovision of 1 per cent on standard assets, which RBI should consider\nintroducing in a phased manner.  Accordingly, as a part of tightening the\nprudential norms, banks were advised in October 1998 to make a general\nprovision on standard assets of a minimum of 25 basis points from the year\nended March 31, 2000. The guidelines were partially modified on April 24,\n2000 stipulating that the provision should be made on a global portfolio basis\nand not on domestic advances, the general provision on standard assets will\nnot be eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, etc.  In view of the international\nbest practices followed in this regard, it is proposed to include the general\nprovision on standard assets in Tier 2 Capital.  Necessary instructions will be\nissued separately.\n (b) Categorisation and  Valuation\n       of Banks\u2019 Investment Portfolio\nAs mentioned in the Mid-Term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy\nfor 1999-2000, the Report of the Informal Group on Valuation of Banks\u2019\nInvestment Portfolio was circulated among banks and discussed with the\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Indian Banks Association.\nThe guidelines have now been finalised keeping in view the comments and\nsuggestions received from them.  The revised guidelines are in consonance\nwith the best international practices on categorisation and valuation of\ninvestments and are effective from the half-year ended September 30, 2000.24\nA summary of the revised guidelines on categorisation and valuation of\nbanks\u2019 investments is in Annexure II.  Detailed operational instructions are\nbeing issued separately.\n(c) Annexing Balance Sheets of Subsidiaries\n                 to Parent Bank's Balance Sheet\nBanks are required to voluntarily build-in risk weighted components of\ntheir subsidiaries into their own balance sheet on notional basis and earmark\nadditional capital in their books, in stages, beginning from the year ending\nMarch 2001.  However, at present, public sector banks are not required to\nannex the balance sheets of their subsidiaries to their balance sheet. In order\nto bring more transparency to the balance sheets of public sector banks and\nas a further step towards consolidated supervision and to provide additional\ndisclosures, it has been decided that public sector banks should also annex\nthe balance sheets of their subsidiaries to their balance sheet beginning from\nthe year ending March 31, 2001.\n(d) Non-Performing Asset \u2013 \u201cPast Due\u201d Concept\nTaking into account the existing legal framework, production and\npayment cycles, business practices, geographical spread and agrarian nature\nof the economy and problems involved in payment and settlement systems,\nthe concept of \u201cpast due\u201d was incorporated into the two quarter delinquency\nnorm on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning introduced\nin April 1992.  However, the \u201cpast due\u201d concept (grace period of 30 days) is\nnot applicable in case of cash credit / overdraft accounts and bills purchased\nand discounted, which are classified as non-performing when such accounts\nremain out of order or overdue for a period of more than 180 days.  Advances\ngranted for agricultural purposes are, however, treated as NPA only if interest\nand/or instalment of principal remains unpaid, after it has become past due,\nfor two harvest seasons but for a period not exceeding two half years. Due to\nthe improvements in the payment and settlement systems, recovery climate,\nupgradation of technology in the banking sector, etc., the concept of \"past\ndue\" is not considered relevant any more.  The \u201cpast due\u201d concept is25\ntherefore, being dispensed with.  This will be made effective from March 31,\n2001.\n(e) Move towards Risk Based Supervision\nAs part of the April policy statement, it was announced that the\nReserve Bank would be engaging the services of reputed international\nconsultants to develop an overall plan for moving towards Risk Based\nSupervision (RBS) incorporating international supervisory best practices.\nAccordingly, the Department for International Development of the UK\nconsented to fund RBS project and appointed an international consultant.\nThey commenced their activity in July 2000. The consultants completed\nPhase 1 of the project by conducting a review and evaluation of current\nsupervisory and regulatory framework, policies, guidelines, instructions, tools,\ntechniques, systems, available IT infrastructure and various internal and\nexternal linkages.  They have submitted the Draft Report consisting of their\nrecommendations and findings.  The thrust of the Phase 1 recommendations\nis on enhancements to the regulation and supervision framework leading to\nincreased effectiveness of overall supervision through greater focus on risk as\nwell as a realignment of the inspection process to fall in line with a more risk-\nbased approach.  Their recommendations cover vital areas such as data\nmanagement, supervisory process, inspections, feedback to banks, external\naudit, etc. During Phase 2 of the project, the Consultants are expected to\nwork out the practical and operational aspects of the above recommendations\nand suggest a new risk based supervisory framework including the\nsequencing of the different stages and a time frame for implementation.\n(f) Discussion Paper on Prompt\n     Corrective Action\nTo guard against regulatory forbearance and to ensure that regulatory\nintervention is consistent across institutions and in keeping with the extent of\nproblem, a framework for Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) has been prepared\nwith various trigger points for prompt responses by the supervisors. The\nframework provides certain mandatory and discretionary action points for the\nsupervisors.  The schedule of corrective actions has been worked out based26\non three parameters, i.e., Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR), Net\nNPAs and Return on Assets (ROA) which represent the three important\nparameters of capital adequacy, asset quality and profitability.  When a bank's\nperformance activates these trigger points, a certain set of mandatory/\ndiscretionary actions will follow.  These action points are proposed to pre-\nempt any deterioration in the soundness of banks.  The PCA has been put on\nthe web site ( www.rbi.org.in ) for wide discussion, debate, and comments.\nThe scheme will be finalised in the light of comments and suggestions\nreceived from experts and market participants.\n(g) Macro-Prudential Indicators ( MPIs)\nThe health and stability of financial systems have traditionally been\nmeasured by Macro-economic indicators ( MEIs).  Financial sector supervisors\nhave been using their own set of Micro-prudential Indicators based on\nCAMELS framework.  Following the East Asian Crisis, the interest in micro-\nprudential indicators has increased and it has been postulated that\nAggregated Micro-prudential Indicators ( AMPIs) coupled with MEIs would be\nbetter macro-level indicators of health and stability of financial systems.  The\nmacro-prudential Indicators ( MPIs), comprise of AMPIs and MEIs.  A half-\nyearly Financial Stability review using MPI data would be initially prepared for\ninternal circulation.\n(h) Credit Exposures to Individual/Group Borrowers\nIt was announced in the Mid-Term Review of Monetary and Credit\nPolicy of October 1999 to reduce the exposure ceiling in respect of individual\nborrower from 25 per cent to 20 per cent of capital funds effective April 1,\n2000 and where the (then) existing level of exposure was more than 20 per\ncent, banks should reduce the level to 20 per cent over a two year period\nending October, 2001.\nA review of current practices regarding credit exposure limits vis-\u00e0-vis\ninternational best practices shows that there are certain issues which require\nfurther consideration. The first relates to the concept of \u2018capital funds\u2019; second27\nrelates to the scope of the measurement of credit exposure, in particular, the\ncoverage of non-fund and other off-balance sheet exposures; and the third\nrelates to the level of exposure limit itself.  Taking into account the\ncomplexities involved, it has been decided to prepare a detailed Discussion\nPaper  on the subject which would inter alia address issues relating to current\npractices in India vis-\u00e0-vis international best practices and the possible\nalternative approaches with pros and cons and other relevant aspects.  The\nDiscussion Paper which is expected to be finalised by December 2000, will be\ncirculated among banks.  Based on the comments and suggestions on the\nissues, and followed by an interaction  with banks, RBI will take a final view on\nthe approach that should be adopted with a view to making it effective from\nMarch end 2002.\nBank Financing of Equities and\nInvestments in Shares\n45.The Standing Technical Committee, comprising officials of RBI and\nSEBI, which was requested to develop operating guidelines for a transparent\nand stable system of bank financing of equities and investments in shares,\nsubmitted its report in August 2000.  This report was released for public\ncomments by RBI.  On the basis of the comments received from experts and\nother market participants on the proposals made by the Committee as well as\nthe views expressed by banks in the meeting taken by RBI with the Chief\nExecutives of major banks in September 2000, draft guidelines were prepared\nby RBI and circulated once again, among select banks, and also placed on\nthe RBI website for comments from banks, financial institutions and other\nmarket participants.  Based on the feedback received from banks and other\nmarket participants, the guidelines on bank financing of equities and\ninvestment in shares have now been finalised.  These are given in\nAnnexure III.\n46.These guidelines are expected to enable the Boards of banks to frame\nsuitable operational guidelines for each bank, taking into account their\nindividual risk profiles, and provide for investments by banks in the equity\nmarket on a more stable and long-term basis subject to appropriate prudential28\nconsiderations.  The RBI-SEBI Technical Committee will review the actual\nworking of these new guidelines after six months in consultation with select\nbanks.  If any changes in operational procedures and/or overall framework are\nrequired, the Committee\u2019s recommendations will be widely circulated and\ndiscussed with all concerned.\nReview of Exchange Earners Foreign\nCurrency A/ cs (EEFC) Facility\n47.Since August 14, 2000, banks are permitted to credit 35 per cent of the\ninward remittances in the EEFC accounts of Export oriented units, units in\nExport Processing Zone, Software Technology Park or Electronic Hardware\nTechnology Park and 25 per cent of inward remittances in respect of others.\nPrior to this, the respective entitlements were 70 per cent and 50 per cent.\nOn a review, in order to facilitate quick export-related payments and reduce\ntransaction costs, it has been decided to restore fully the earlier entitlements\nto 70 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively.  Payments which can be made\nfrom these accounts will also remain the same as before.\n48.As balances in the accounts are meant to be used by the account\nholders for their current account trade transactions and other permitted\npayments, the EEFC accounts (including existing accounts) will henceforth be\nheld in the form of current accounts.  The cheque-issuing facility against these\naccounts will continue to be available for convenience of exporters.  No credit\nfacilities, either fund based or non-fund based, will be provided by banks\nagainst the EEFC balances.\nCredit Delivery Mechanisms\n49.Credit delivery mechanisms have been strengthened by improving and\nsimplifying procedures and reducing documentation and enhancing\ndecentralised decision making such that the targeted sector viz., agriculture,\nexports, macro-credit institutions and small scale industries are able to\naccess credit without undue hassles.  As a further step in this direction the\nfollowing measures are being taken : 29\n (a) Charging of Penal Interest: Deregulation\nIn terms of the current instructions, banks have been advise d about the\noverall penal/additional interest to be charged by banks which should not\nexceed 2 per cent over and above the rate of interest applicable/normally\ncharged to the respective borrowers.  It may be mentioned that since issue of\nthe above instructions, interest rates on loans and deposits have been\nsubstantially deregulated and banks\u2019 Boards have been empowered to\nformulate policy on lending rates taking into account their cost of fund, the\nunderlying credit risk, etc.  Since the Boards have been empowered to decide\nthe Prime Lending Rate (PLR) as also the spread over PLR, it is felt that the\ndecision on penal interest that should be levied for reasons such as default in\nrepayment, non-submission of financial statements, etc., should also be left to\nthe Boards of each bank.  This would also give further operational autonomy\nto the banks.  It has, therefore, been decided that banks may formulate\ntransparent policy for charging penal interest rates, with the approval of their\nBoards.  The policy should be governed by well accepted principles of\ntransparency, fairness, incentive to service the debt and due regard to\ngenuine difficulties of customers.\n(b)   Margins on Credit for Free\n        sale Sugar: Deregulation\nPrescription of margins under selective credit control are at present in\nvogue only in respect of sugar. Effective October 22, 1997, for unreleased\nstocks of sugar with sugar mills, which contain both the levy and free sale\ncomponents, separate margins have been stipulated.  The minimum margin\nfor levy stock is prescribed as 10 per cent, while free sale sugar is subject to\na margin of 15 per cent.  There is no margin on the buffer stock. On a review\nof market conditions and with a view to providing the flexibility to banks in\nprescribing margins, it has been decided to withdraw the existing\nprescriptions under selective credit control on free sale sugar.  Margins in\nrespect of free sale sugar will be decided by the banks based on their\ncommercial judgement.  The prescribed margins of 10 per cent in respect of30\nlevy stock and zero margin in respect of buffer stocks will continue without\nchange.\n(c) Review of Consortium\n     arrangement for Food Credit\nAt present, food credit is disbursed under a single window consortium\nled by SBI.  However, the consortium arrangement is regulated by the\nReserve Bank in respect of fixing sanctions of limits for the procurement of\nfoodgrains by the state governments and the FCI, the percentage share\namong the members of the consortium and the interest rate chargeable on\nfood credit.  In the context of the present policy of providing more  flexibility\nand operational freedom to banks as well as government and other\nenterprises, it has been decided to undertake a review of these\narrangements. A Committee representing banks, RBI, Government and FCI\nwill be constituted for the purpose.\n(d) Export Credit\nAs mentioned in Part I, in response to the request to exporters to send\ntheir suggestions, RBI has received a number of suggestions from export\norganisations and exporters mainly of a procedural nature for further\nimprovement in the credit delivery system.  These suggestions have been\nexamined by the Bankers\u2019 Group and RBI, and banks are being requested to\nimplement the recommendations of the Group.\n(e)  Review of recommendations of the\n                  Bills Discounting Group\nA Working Group on Bills Discounting by Banks was constituted under\nthe Chairmanship of Shri K.R.  Ramamoorthy, to examine inter alia the\npossibility of extending bills discounting facility to services sector especially\nindustries such as information technology, software services, travel and\ntourism, etc.  In view of the services sector transforming the economic profile\nof the country and is poised to register tremendous growth and contribute\nsignificantly to the overall economy, the Group undertook a detailed scrutiny\nof the key issues involved in bill financing and examined the possibility of31\nstrengthening the existing bill discounting mechanism and extending its scope\nto services sector. The Group has made several recommendations duly\ntaking into account the Indian context in respect of bill financing, Banker\u2019s\nAcceptance, Bill financing - services sector and challenges of e-commerce\nthat may be thrown up in the financial sector of the country.  The Working\nGroup has submitted its report to the Reserve Bank of India recently.  The full\ntext of the Report has already been placed on the RBI website\n(www.rbi.org.in ), for wider debate and discussion.  Based on the feedback\nand in consultation with market participants, RBI will evolve suitable\nguidelines for implementation.\n(f) Kisan Credit Cards\nPursuant to the budget announcement a model scheme for issue of\nKisan Credit Card to farmer borrowers was formulated in 1998 and all banks\nwere advised to implement it.  The scheme was primarily formulated for\ncatering to the short-term credit requirements of the farmers.  All public sector\nbanks have been advised to set monthly targets within the yearly target fixed\nfor the bank and draw action plan for achieving the overall target.\n(g)  Implementation of Swarnjayanti\n           Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY)\nThe year 1999-2000 was the first year of implementation of SGSY.\nThe scheme was launched with effect from April 1, 1999 and detailed\nguidelines were issued to banks by the Reserve Bank for speedy\nimplementation of the scheme.  Public sector banks were also advised to\norganise special workshops to discuss the scheme and its implementation.\nBanks are advised to monitor the progress of the scheme periodically and put\nin earnest efforts for its success.\n(h) Self Help Groups ( SHGs)\nThe Finance Minister made an announcement in the Budget Speech\nabout the special emphasis laid on the promotion of micro enterprises in rural\nareas set up by vulnerable sectors including women, scheduled castes,\nscheduled tribes and other backward classes.  In 1999-2000, the credit-32\nlinkage as also loan disbursements by banks to SHGs were more than twice\nthe cumulative performance upto the end of the previous year under the\nNABARD programme.  A coverage of additional one lakh SHGs by NABARD\nand SIDBI during the year 2000-01 has been announced.  Banks are advised\nto provide maximum support to SHGs as per RBI circular dated March 3,\n2000.\n(i) Small Scale Industries (SSI)\nThe Finance Minister in his Budget Speech on February 29, 2000\nannounced that the public sector banks should accelerate their programme of\nopening SSI branches to ensure that every district and SSI clusters within\ndistricts are served by at least one such branch.  The Lead Banks of the\ndistricts have been advised to take steps for operationalising these branches\nin their respective districts either by opening new branches or by converting\nthe existing branches.  The convenor bank of SLBC in each state has been\nasked to monitor the progress in the respective states.  The public sector\nbanks have also been advised to complete the process of\nopening/ operationalising SSI branches by December 31, 2000.\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)\n50.Of 37,212 NBFCs which applied for registration ,  the Bank has so far\napproved registration to 702 deposit taking companies permitting them to\naccept public deposits and also granted registration to 9,857 NBFCs in the\ncategory of non-public deposit taking companies. Since the expiry of time\nperiod for attaining the minimum stipulated level of Net Owned Fund (NOF) of\nRs.25 lakhs on January 10, 2000, Bank has received applications from as\nmany as 8,027 NBFCs reporting attainment of NOF of Rs.25 lakhs and 2,207\nNBFCs for extension of time. The Bank is at present engaged in processing\napplications of such NBFCs as had the NOF below Rs.25 lakhs as on January\n10, 2000. It has already been announced that the extension of time would be\nconsidered on merits of each NBFC.  The Bank has also taken a number of\nsteps like prohibition from acceptance of public deposits, launching of\nprosecution proceedings, filing of winding up petitions against delinquent33\ncompanies besides rejection of 15,727 applications which did not fulfil the\nnecessary criteria for registration.\n(a) Regulatory Norms for NBFCs\nReserve Bank is working out the modalities in  consultation with the\nassociations of NBFCs, for formation of a Self Regulatory Organisation of\nNBFCs. Draft guidelines for asset liability management and formats of\nseparate balance sheet for NBFCs have been circulated among the members\nof Informal Advisory Group on NBFCs for the views of industry. Further steps\nwould be taken to put in place the disclosure norms and guidelines for risk\nmanagement for NBFCs.\n(b) Working Group on Asset Securitisation\nWith a view to laying down the road map for development of asset\nsecuritisation in the Indian financial system, the Working Group on asset\nsecuritisation appointed by the Reserve Bank submitted its Report in\nDecember 1999.  Various recommendations of the Working Group have been\ngrouped into short-term, medium-term and long- term  with definite time frame\nin each category.  The major recommendations pertain to changes in the legal\nframework relating to various statutes, tax-neutrality for securitisation\ntransactions, rationalisation of stamp duty and reduction in registration\ncharges, appropriate accounting policies and prudential norms,\nstandardisation of documents, development of specialised financial\nintermediaries, etc.  Reserve Bank has set up an Implementation Committee\nfor suggesting the framework for giving effect to the above recommendations.\nTechnology Upgradation\n51.The Reserve Bank ha s been playing an important role in the setting up\nof  an effective and efficient payment and settlement system in the country.\nMuch progress has been made in consolidating the existing payment system,\ndeveloping technologically advanced modes of payment and moving towards\nthe ultimate objective of linking various payment and settlement systems into\nan efficient and integrated system that will function in an online real time\nenvironment.  Towards this end, the following measures are introduced :34\n(a) Preparation of a \"Payment\n           System Vision Document\"\nThis document will detail the payment system agenda proposed to be\nfollowed for the next 2/3 years.   The Vision Document will focus on the\nimplementation of the systemically important payment system applications\nhaving an impact on large value inter-bank funds transfers.  It would detail the\nextensive use of INFINET for information flow and funds movements.  It\nwould also detail the need for integration of the IT plans of the banks with\nINFINET.\n(b) Working Group on Internet Banking\nThe Bank has established an internal Group on Internet Banking. The\ntasks set out for the Group  are to : identify the risks to the organization and\nthe banking system; suggest an appropriate supervisory and legal framework;\nsuggest measures for adoption of the international best practices;\nrecommend adequate security systems in conformity with international\nstandards; and suggest a clearing and settlement arrangement for electronic\nbanking and electronic money transfers.  Commercial banks are invited to\nsend their suggestions for consideration by the Working Group.\n(c) Use of Imaging Technology for reducing\n            Clearing Reconciliation Differences\nIn the four metros where MICR operations are being ha ndled by the\nBank, the Reserve Bank is all set to introduce Greyscale Imaging Technology\nwhich will be a value added service to the members of the Clearing House.\nThe advantages of imaging are manifold.  Primarily, it will aid in the creation\nof a record of the cheques that have been passed through the reader sorters.\nThis will aid in the reconciliation process.  Importantly, imaging parameters\ncan be set to find out suspect instruments.35\n(d) Imaging to serve as pre-cursor\n           for Cheque Truncation\nCheque truncation will enable retention of the paper payment\ninstruments at the Presenting Bank level itself, with only the image of the\ninstrument travelling over the network.  This will to a large extent reduce the\ntime lags in the collection of instruments especially inner-city cheques.\nHowever, for cheque truncation to take place, amendments to the Negotiable\nInstruments Act have to be carried out to obviate the need for physically\npresenting instruments to the paying banker.  The Task Force on Legal\nIssues set up by the National Payments Council is looking into the need for\namendments to various Acts as also the need for framing new legislation for\nthe regulation of multiple electronic payments.\nLegal Reforms\n52.With the rapid advancements in information and communication\ntechnologies, the financial system is undergoing a continuous process of\nchange.  For central banks to keep pace with these developments, it is\nimportant that they have sufficient flexibility in appropriately reorienting the\noperative, regulatory and supervisory frameworks.  In his budget speech in\nFebruary 2000, the Union Finance Minister has also underscored the need for\naccording greater flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy.  The Reserve\nBank of India is working on proposals for amendments to the Reserve Bank\nof India Act, 1934 and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 in this regard.\nInternational Financial\nStandards and Codes\n53.As mentioned in the April policy statement, a Standing Committee on\nInternational Financial Standards and Codes  was set up to identify and\nmonitor the developments in global standards and codes being evolved in the\ncontext of the international developments and consider the applicability of\nthese standards and codes to the Indian financial system and chalk out a\nroad map for aligning India's standards and practices with international best\npractices.  Advisory Groups in ten major subject areas were set up in the36\nbeginning of this year to assist the Standing Committee.  Of these ten\nAdvisory Groups, the Advisory Group on \"Transparency in Monetary and\nFinancial Policies\" submitted its Report in September 2000.  The Group has\nexamined issues related to the clarity of roles and responsibilities including\ntransparency in monetary policy formulation and implementation in detail.\nThe Advisory Groups on \"Payment and Settlement System\", \"Banking\nSupervision\" and \"Insurance Regulation\" have also submitted the first part of\ntheir Report.  The Report on \"Payment and Settlement System\" deals with\nissues pertaining to the inter-bank payment and settlement system covering\nCore Principle and Central Bank responsibilities. The Report on \"Banking\nSupervision\" has taken an exhaustive account and given recommendations\npertaining to 4 major areas in banking regulation, viz., corporate governance\nin banks, transparency practices in Indian banking, supervision of cross-\nborder banking and internal rating practices adopted by banks.  The Report\non \"Insurance Regulation\" mainly deals with the various provisions relating to\nlicensing of insurance companies in the light of standards set by the\nInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the Twenty\nInsurance Guidelines issued by OECD.  The Reports of the Advisory Groups\nare available on Bank's Website ( www.rbi.org.in ).\n54.Report of the Advisory Group on \"Accounting and Auditing\" has\ndiscussed issues regarding transparency practices in accounting and\nauditing, the status of compliance with international accounting standards in\nIndia and also various issues pertaining to adoption of US-GAAP.  The Group\nis likely to submit its Report by November 2000.\n55.The remaining five Advisory Groups namely Advisory Group on\n\"Corporate Governance\", \"Data Dissemination\", \"Bankruptcy Laws\", \"Fiscal\nTransparency\" and \"Securities Market Regulation\" have made considerable\nprogress and it is expected that the Advisory Groups would be finalising their\nReports by end November 2000.37\nRegulations Review Authority\n56.The Reserve Bank would like to take this opportunity t o express its\nappreciation to bankers, experts, market participants and members of the\npublic who have sent their suggestions to the Regulations Review Authority\n(RRA) set up by the Bank in April 1999.  The RRA has completed one and\nhalf year of its operation and has reviewed several of Reserve Bank's rules,\nregulations and reporting systems on the basis of suggestions received by it.\nDuring this period, RRA received 235 applications which contained more than\n400 suggestions, pertaining to various functional areas of the Bank.  A few\nimportant developments during the current year (April-September, 2000) as a\nresult of implementation of the suggestions were (a )  putting in place in the\nBank, a comprehensive and effective information transmittal system in\nelectronic form for the benefit of seekers of information from the Bank, (b)\nrevision in Bank's instructions relating to nomination facility, etc., for the\nbenefit of investors in Relief Bonds, (c) increase in the limit of same day credit\nof local/outstation instruments sent for collection by banks from Rs.5,000 to\nRs.7,500, (d) streamlining the procedure for prompt payment of interest to\nscheduled commercial banks on their CRR balances and (e) relaxation in the\nprescribed eligibility criteria for opening and maintaining Non-Resident\nExternal Rupee Accounts by the District Central Co-operative Banks.\n57.Out of several Master Circulars being prepared on important areas of\ncompliance by banks and institutions, under the aegis of RRA, one circular on\nExposure Norms has already been issued to banks and others are in various\nstages of finalisation.\n58.The RRA will formally cease to operate on March 31, 2001.  However,\nvarious departments of the Reserve Bank will continue with their efforts to\nfurther simplify procedures, reduce paper work and improve service.\nSuggestions from bankers and others will be welcome.\nMumbai\nOctober 10, 200038\nAnnexure  I\nSummary  of  Guidelines for Issue of\nCommercial Paper (CP)\nEligibility : Corporates, primary dealers ( PDs), satellite dealers ( SDs), and all-India\nfinancial institutions ( FIs) ;  for a corporate to be eligible, (a) the tangible net worth of\nRs.4 crore; (b) having a sanctioned working capital limit from a bank/FI; and (c) the\nborrowal account is  a Standard Asset.\nRating Requirement :  The minimum credit rating shall be P-2 of CRISIL or such\nequivalent rating by other approved agencies.\nMaturity :   A minimum of 15 days and a maximum upto one year.\nDenomination :  Minimum of Rs.5 lakh and multiples thereof.\nLimits and Amount  : CP can be issued as a \"stand alone\" product.

The report was released for public\ncomments. On the basis of the comments received from the media and other market\nparticipants on the proposals made by the Committee as well as the views expressed\nby banks in the meeting taken by RBI with the Chief Executives of major banks on\nSeptember 19, 2000, RBI prepared new draft guidelines.  These draft guidelines\nwere again circulated among select banks and also placed on the RBI website for\ncomments from banks, financial institutions and other market participants.\nBased on the feed back received from  banks and others, the guidelines on\nbank financing of equities and investments in shares have now been finalised.\nThese are given below.\n1. Bank financing of equities\n(i) Financing of Initial Public Offerings ( IPOs)\n(a) The financing of Initial Public  Offerings ( IPOs) should be treated as advances\nagainst shares to individuals.  Accordingly, banks may grant advances for\nsubscribing to IPOs only to individuals.  Further, the terms and conditions for\nfinancing of IPOs should be the same as those applicable to advances against\nshares to individuals, set out in our Master circular DBOD.No.Dir.BC.90/\n13.07.05/1998 dated August 28, 1998.  The maximum amount of finance that can be\nextended to an individual against IPOs should be Rs.10 lakh, as applicable to\nadvances against physical shares.  The corporates should not be extended credit by\nbanks for investment in other companies\u2019 IPOs.  Similarly, banks should not provide\nfinance to NBFCs for further lending to individuals for IPOs.\n(b) Finance extended by a ba nk for IPOs should be reckoned as an exposure to\ncapital market.\n(ii) Issue of guarantees on behalf of brokers\nA minimum margin of 25 per cent inclusive of cash margin, should be\nobtained by banks for issue of guarantees on behalf of share brokers. Banks may, at43\ntheir discretion, obtain margin higher than 25 per cent as per the policy approved by\ntheir Board of Directors.\n(iii) Total exposure\nThe Board of Directors of banks may lay down a prudential ceiling on the\nbank\u2019s aggregate exposure to capital market, keeping in view its overall risk profile.\nBoards of each bank should also take a view on the exposure on a particular\ncorporate either through primary or secondary market or through book building route,\nkeeping in view its overall risk management policy.  The bank\u2019s exposure should,\nhowever, meet the statutory requirements regarding holding of shares of a company\ncontained in sections 19(2) and (3) and 20(1)(a) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949,\nas also the single borrower and borrower-group exposure norms stipulated by the\nRBI.  The following may be excluded for reckoning the bank\u2019s aggregate exposure to\ncapital market:\n(a) Advances against collateral security of shares.     \n(b) Advances to individuals for personal purposes like education, housing,\nconsumption, etc., against the security of shares.\n(c) Credit substitutes like Commercial Paper, non-convertible debenture, etc.,\nmay not be reckoned as part of credit portfolio for arriving at the bank\u2019s exposure to\ncapital market.\n2.  Banks\u2019 investments in shares and debentures\n(i)In terms of circular DBOD No.Dir.BC ..61/13.07.05/94 dated May 18, 1994,\nbanks are free to acquire shares, convertible debentures of corporates and units of\nequity oriented mutual funds, subject to a ceiling of 5 per cent of the incremental\ndeposits of the previous year.  The RBI-SEBI Technical Committee has\nrecommended that the ceiling prescribed for banks\u2019 investments in shares,\nconvertible debentures, etc., should be related to outstanding advances and not to\nincremental deposits of the previous year.  It has, therefore, been decided that within\nthe overall exposure to sensitive sectors, a bank\u2019s total exposure to capital market by\nway of investments in shares, convertible debentures and units of mutual funds\n(other than debt funds) should not exceed 5 per cent of the banks\u2019 total outstanding\ncredit as on March 31 of the previous year.  It is further clarified that the ceilings for\ninvestments in shares, etc., are maximum permissible ceiling and a bank\u2019s Board of\nDirectors is free to adopt a lower ceiling for an individual bank, keeping in view the\nbank\u2019s overall risk profile and volatility in equity prices.  In respect of those banks\nwhere the present outstanding investments in equities are relatively small and well44\nbelow the 5 per cent overall ceiling, as a prudential measure, the Board should also\nlay down an annual ceiling for fresh investments in equities so that any increase in\nfresh investments in equities take place in a phased, gradual and cautious manner,\nwithin the absolute ceiling fixed by the Board for each year.\n(ii) Banks may make investment in shares directly or through UTI and SEBI\napproved other diversified mutual funds with good track records.  Investment in\nUTI/mutual funds will be as per the investment policy approved by the Board of\nDirectors, taking into account the in-house expertise available within the bank. It is\nadvised that the decisions in regard to investments in shares, etc., should be taken\nby the Investment Committee set up by the bank.\n(iii) Underwriting commitments taken up by the banks in respect of primary issues\nthrough book building route would also be within the above norms.\n(iv) Loans sanctioned to corporates for meeting promoters\u2019 contributions and\nbridge loans sanctioned to companies for a period not exceeding one year against\nexpected equity flows/issues, expected proceeds of non-convertible debentures,\nexternal commercial borrowings, GDRs and/or funds in the nature of foreign direct\ninvestments, (which are now within the ceiling of 5 per cent of the incremental\ndeposits of the previous year), would also  continue to be within the above overall\nceiling.\n(v) The decision on investments in shares, debentures, etc., maybe made by the\nBoard/ALCO of each bank keeping in view the permitted tolerance levels of\nmismatch.  The quantum and tenure of such investments may be decided by Boards\nof each bank.\n(vi) Banks whose investments in shares, etc., are now in excess of 5 per cent of\noutstanding credit as on March 31, 2000 may bring down their investments gradually\nto conform to this prudential norm, by March 31, 2001.\n3. Valuation and disclosure\nBanks should mark to market their investment portfolio in equities like other\ninvestments on a quarterly basis.  Further, banks should disclose the total\ninvestments made in shares, convertible shares and units of equity oriented mutual\nfunds as also aggregate advances against shares, etc., in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 to\ntheir balance sheets, beginning from the year ending March 2001.45\n4. Review of Guidelines\nThe Standing Technical Committee of RBI and SEBI will review the guidelines\nafter six months in consultation with banks, keeping in view the operational\nmechanism and the experience gained.  In case any changes are required in the light\nof actual experience, the Committee will make appropriate recommendations to the\nRBI.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/16777.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 01, 2000", "info": "Foreign Exchange Management Act , 1999 -  Foreign Travel\nA.P.

The\nclassification of the investments in the balance sheet, for disclosure, is under six groups viz., i)\nGovernment securities ii) Other approved securities iii) Shares iv) Debentures & Bonds v)\nSubsidiaries/ joint ventures vi) Others (CP, Mutual Fund Units, etc.). While the first two\nclassifications represent the banks\u2019 investments in SLR securities the other four represent the non-\nSLR securities. Banks were earlier advised that for the purpose of valuation,\na) the investments of banks in SLR securities should be bifurcated into  \u2018current\u2019 and \u2018permanent\u2019,\nwith the prescription that the \u2018current\u2019 investments are not less than 75% of the total SLR\nsecurities, excluding the new banks set up after 1993 in the private sector which were required to\ninclude their entire SLR investments under \u2018current\u2019 category and\nb) \u2018current\u2019 category of SLR investments and the entire portfolio of non-SLR investments should\nbe marked to market.\n2.2 RBI has also been issuin g detailed guidelines to be followed for valuation of the\ninvestments and marking them to market every year. Besides, to facilitate valuation of investments\nwhich are not quoted, YTM rates for Government securities of different maturities, as on March 31,\nare also being issued annually.\nReview\n3. With the introduction of prudential norms on capital adequacy, income recognition, asset\nclassification and provisioning requirements the financial position of banks in India has improved\nin the last few years. Simultaneously, trading in the securities market has improved in terms of\nturnover and the range of maturities dealt with. In view of these developments and taking into\nconsideration the evolving international practices, an Informal Working Group in the Bank has\nreviewed the existing instructions on the classification and valuation of the investments portfolio.\nThe guidelines on classification and valuation of investments by banks have been revised on thebasis of the recommendations of the Informal Group to bring them in consonance with the best\ninternational practices.\nRevised Guidelines\n4.1 The highlights of the revised guidelines are given below:\n\u2022 The revised guidelines furnished in the Annexure will be effective from the half-year ended\nSeptember 30, 2000.\n\u2022 The banks are required to classify their entire investment portfolio as on September 30, 2000,\nunder three categories viz. \u2018Held to Maturity\u2019, \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 and \u2018Held for Trading\u2019.\n\u2022 In the balance sheet, the investments will continue to be disclosed as per the existing six\nclassifications viz. i) Government securities ii )other approved securities iii) Shares iv)\nDebentures & Bonds v) Subsidiaries/ joint ventures vi) Others (CP, Mutual Fund Units, etc.).\n\u2022 The investments under the Available for Sale and Held for Trading categories should be\nmarked to market periodically as indicated in the Annexure or at more frequent intervals.\n\u2022 The investments under the Held to Maturity category need not be marked to market as in the\ncase of \u2018Permanent\u2019 securities at present.\n\u2022 Classification of investments, shifting of investments among the three categories, valuation\nof the investments, methodology for booking profit/ loss on sale of investments and\nproviding for depreciation should be in accordance with the guidelines in the Annexure.\n\u2022 The risk-weights assigned to the various securities at present, including those for \u2018market\nrisk\u2019, would remain unchanged.\n4.2 The classification of the existing investments among the three categories may be done at the\nbook value of the respective securities as on September 30, 2000. Subsequent valuation of the\nsecurities included under the \u2018Held for Trading\u2019 and the \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 categories may be\ncarried out as specified in the revised guidelines. The first such revaluation may be done as on\nSeptember 30, 2000 for the securities under the \u2018Held for Trading\u2019 category. Securities under the\n\u2018Available for Sale\u2019 category may also be revalued as on that date if the bank proposes to revalue\nthis category at intervals more frequent than \u2018annual\u2019 intervals.\n4.3 Banks should formulate an Investment Policy with the approval of their Board of Directors to\ntake care of the requirements on classification, shifting and valuation of investments under the\nrevised guidelines. Besides, the Policy should adequately address risk-management aspects, ensure\nthat the procedures to be adopted by the banks under the revised guidelines are consistent,\ntransparent and well documented to facilitate easy verification by inspectors and statutory auditors.\nYours faithfully\n      Sd/-\n(A.Ghosh)\nChief General Manager-in-ChargeANNEXURE\nGuidelines for Classification and Valuation of Investments by banks\nA. Categorisation:\n1. The entire investment portfolio of the banks (including SLR securities and non-SLR securities)\nwill be classified under three categories viz. \u2018Held to Maturity\u2019, \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 and \u2018Held for\nTrading\u2019. However, in the balance sheet, the investments will continue to be disclosed as per the\nexisting six classifications viz. i) Government securities ii) Other approved securities iii) Shares iv)\nDebentures & Bonds v) Subsidiaries/ joint ventures vi) Others (CP, Mutual Fund Units, etc.).\n[ Definitions: The securities acquired by the banks with the intention to hold them up to maturity\nwill be classified under Held to Maturity. The securities acquired by the banks with the intention to\ntrade by taking advantage of the short-term price/ interest rate movements will be classified under\nHeld for Trading. The securities which do not fall within the above two categories will be classified\nunder Available for Sale]\n2. Banks should decide the category of the investment at the time of acquisition and the decision\nshould be recorded on the investment proposals.\nHeld to Maturity\n3. The investments included under \u201cHeld to Maturity\u201d should not exceed 25 per cent of the bank\u2019s\ntotal investments. The banks may include, at their discretion, under Held to Maturity category\nsecurities less than 25 per cent of total investment.\n4. The following investments will be classified under \u2018Held to Maturity\u2019 but will not be counted for\nthe purpose of ceiling of 25% specified for this category:\na) Re-capitalisation bonds received from the Government of India towards their re- capitalisation\nrequirement and held in their investment portfolio. This will not include re- capitalisation bonds of\nother banks acquired for investment purposes.\nb) Investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures. [A joint venture would be one in which the bank,\nalong with its subsidiaries, holds more than 25% of the equity.]\nc) The investments in debentures/ bonds, which are deemed to be in the nature of an advance.\nDebentures/ bonds must be treated in the nature of an advance when:\n\u2022 The debenture/bond is issued as part of the proposal for project finance and the tenure of the\ndebenture is for a period of three years and above\nor\nThe debenture/bond is issued as part of the proposal for working capital finance and the tenure of\nthe debenture/ bond is less than a period of one year\nand\n\u2022 the bank has a significant stake i.e.10% or more in the issue\nand\u2022 the issue is part of a private placement, i.e. the borrower has approached the bank/FI and not\npart of a public issue where the bank/FI has subscribed in response to an invitation.\nThe debentures/ bonds deemed to be in the nature of advance will be subject to the usual prudential\nnorms applicable to advances.\n5. The banks, which had already marked to market more than 75% of their SLR portfolio, will be\ngiven the option to re-classify their investments under this category up to the permissible level.\n6. Profit on sale of investments in this category should be first taken to the Profit & Loss Account\nand thereafter be appropriated to the \u2018Capital Reserve Account\u2019. Loss on sale will be recognised in\nthe Profit & Loss Account.\nAvailable for Sale & Held for Trading\n7. The banks will have the freedom to decide on the extent of holdings under Available for Sale and\nHeld for Trading categories. This will be decided by them after considering various aspects such as\nbasis of intent, trading strategies, risk management capabilities, tax planning, manpower skills,\ncapital position.\n8. The investments classified under Held for Trading category would be those from which the bank\nexpects to make a gain by the movement in the interest rates/ market rates. These securities are to\nbe sold within 90 days. If the bank is not able to sell the security within 90 days due to exceptional\ncircumstances such as tight liquidity conditions, or extreme volatility, or market becoming\nunidirectional, the security should be shifted to the Available for Sale category subject to items 12\nand 13 below.\n9. Profit or loss on sale of investments in both the categories will be taken to the Profit & Loss\nAccount.\nB. Shifting among categories:\n10. Banks may shift investments to/from Held to Maturity category with the approval of the Board\nof Directors once a year.  Such shifting will normally be allowed at the beginning of the accounting\nyear. No further shifting to/from this category will be allowed during the remaining part of that\naccounting year.\n11. Banks may shift investments from Available for Sale category to Held for Trading category\nwith the approval of their Board of Directors/ ALCO/ Investment Committee. In case of exigencies,\nsuch shifting may be done with the approval of the Chief Executive of the bank/ Head of the\nALCO, but should be ratified by the Board of Directors/ ALCO.\n12. Shifting of investments from Held for Trading category to Available for Sale category is\ngenerally not allowed.  However, it will be permitted only under exceptional circumstances as\nmentioned at item 8 above, subject to depreciation, if any, applicable on the date of transfer, with\nthe approval of the Board of Directors/ ALCO/ Investment Committee.13. Transfer of scrips from one category to another, under all circumstances, should be done at the\nacquisition cost/ book value/ market value on the date of transfer, whichever is the least, and the\ndepreciation, if any, on such  transfer should be fully provided for.\nC. Valuation\n14. Investments classified under Held to Maturity category need not be marked  to market and will\nbe carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the face value, in which case the premium\nshould be amortised over the period  remaining to maturity.\n15. Banks should recognise any diminution, other than temporary, in the value of their investments\nin subsidiaries/ joint ventures which are included under  Held to Maturity category and provide\ntherefor. Such diminution should be determined and provided for each investment individually.\n16. The individual scrips in the Available for Sale category will be marked to market at the year-\nend or at more frequent intervals. While the net depreciation under each classification referred to in\nitem 1 above should be recognised and fully provided for as indicated in item 17 below, the net\nappreciation under each classification referred to in item 1 above should be ignored. The book\nvalue of the individual securities would not undergo any change after the revaluation.\n[Note: Securities under this category shall be valued scrip-wise and depreciation/ appreciation shall\nbe aggregated for each classification referred to in item 1 above. Net depreciation, if any, shall be\nprovided for. Net appreciation, if any, should be ignored. Net depreciation required to be provided\nfor in any one classification should not be reduced on account of net appreciation in any other\nclassification.]\n17. The provisions required to be created on account of depreciation in the Available for Sale\ncategory in any year should be debited to the Profit & Loss Account and an equivalent amount (net\nof tax benefit, if any, and net of consequent reduction in the transfer to Statutory Reserve) or the\nbalance available in the Investment Fluctuation Reserve Account, whichever is less, shall be\ntransferred from the Investment Fluctuation Reserve Account to the Profit & Loss Account. In the\nevent provisions created on account of depreciation in the Available for Sale category are found to\nbe in excess of the required amount in any year, the excess should be credited to the Profit & Loss\nAccount and an equivalent amount (net of taxes, if any, and net of transfer to Statutory Reserves as\napplicable to such excess provision) should be appropriated to the Investment Fluctuation Reserve\nAccount to be utilised to meet future depreciation requirement for investments in this category. The\namounts debited to the Profit & Loss Account for provision and the amount credited to the Profit &\nLoss Account for reversal of excess provision should be debited and credited respectively under the\nhead \u201cExpenditure \u2013 Provisions & Contingencies\u201d. The amounts appropriated from the Profit &\nLoss Account and the amount transferred from the Investment Fluctuation Reserve to the Profit &\nLoss Account should be shown as \u2018below the line\u2019 items after determining the profit for the year.\n18. The individual scrips in the Held for Trading category will be revalued at monthly or at more\nfrequent intervals and the net appreciation/ depreciation under each classification referred to in item\n1 above will be recognised in the income account.  The book value of the individual scrip will\nchange with the revaluation.General\n19. In respect of securities included in any of the three categories where interest/ principal is in\narrears, the banks should not reckon income on the securities and should also make appropriate\nprovisions for the depreciation in the value of the investment. The banks should not set-off the\ndepreciation requirement in respect of these non-performing securities against the appreciation in\nrespect of other performing securities.\nMarket value\n20. The \u2018market value\u2019 for the purpose of periodical valuation of investments included in the\nAvailable for Sale and the Held for Trading categories would be the market price of the scrip as\navailable from the trades/ quotes on the stock exchanges, SGL account transactions, price list of\nRBI, prices declared by Primary Dealers Association of India (PDAI) jointly with the Fixed Income\nMoney Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) periodically. In respect of\nunquoted securities, the procedure as detailed below should be adopted.\nUnquoted SLR securities\nCentral Government Securities\n21. The Reserve Bank of India will not announce the YTM rates for unquoted Government\nsecurities, as hitherto, for the purpose of valuation of investments by banks. The banks should value\nthe unquoted Central Government securities on the basis of the prices/ YTM rates put out by the\nPDAI/ FIMMDA at periodical intervals.\n22. The 6.00 per cent Capital Indexed Bonds may be valued at \u201ccost\u201d as defined in circular DBOD.\nNO.BC.8/12.02.001 / 97-98 dated January 22, 1998 and BC.18/12.02.001/2000-2001 dated August\n16, 2000.\n23.

Other approved securities will be valued applying the YTM method by marking it up by 25\nbasis points above the yields of the Central Government Securities of equivalent maturity put out\nby PDAI/ FIMMDA periodically.\nUnquoted non-SLR securities\nDebentures/ Bonds\n26. All debentures/ bonds other than debentures/ bonds which are in the nature of advance should\nbe valued on the YTM basis.  Such debentures/ bonds may be of different companies having\ndifferent ratings. These will be valued with appropriate mark-up over the YTM rates for Central\nGovernment securities as put out by PDAI/ FIMMDA periodically. The mark-up will be gradedaccording to the ratings assigned to the debentures/ bonds by the rating agencies subject to the\nfollowing :-\n(a) The rate used for the YTM for rated debentures/ bonds should be at least 50 basis points above\nthe rate applicable to a Government of India loan of equivalent maturity.\n(b) The rate used for the YTM for unrated debentures/ bonds should not be less than the rate\napplicable to rated debentures/ bonds of equivalent maturity. The mark-up for the unrated\ndebentures/ bonds should appropriately reflect the credit risk borne by the bank.\n(c) Where interest/ principal on the debenture/ bonds is in arrears, the provision should be made for\nthe debentures as in the case of debentures/ bonds treated as advances. The depreciation/ provision\nrequirement towards debentures where the interest is in arrears or principal is not paid as per due\ndate, shall not be allowed to be set-off against appreciation against other debentures/ bonds.\nWhere the debenture/ bonds is quoted and there have been transactions within 15 days prior to the\nvaluation date, the value adopted should not be higher than the rate at which the transaction is\nrecorded on the stock exchange.\nPreference Shares\n27. The valuation of preference shares should be on YTM basis. The preference shares will be\nissued by companies with different ratings. These will be valued with appropriate mark-up over the\nYTM rates for Central Government securities put out by the PDAI/FIMMDA periodically. The\nmark-up will be graded according to the ratings assigned to the preference shares by the rating\nagencies subject to the following:\na) The YTM rate should not be lower than the coupon rate/ YTM for a GOI loan of equivalent\nmaturity.\nb) The rate used for the YTM for unrated preference shares should not be less than the rate\napplicable to rated preference shares of equivalent maturity. The mark-up for the unrated\npreference shares should appropriately reflect the credit risk borne by the bank.\nc) Investments in preference shares as part of the project finance may be valued at par for a period\nof two years after commencement of production or five years after subscription whichever is\nearlier.\nd) Where investment in preference shares is as part of rehabilitation, the YTM rate should not be\nlower than 1.5% above the coupon rate/ YTM for GOI loan of equivalent maturity.\ne) Where preference dividends are in arrears, no credit should be taken for accrued dividends and\nthe value determined on YTM should be discounted by at least 15% if arrears are for one year, and\nmore if arrears are for more than one year. The depreciation/ provision requirement arrived at in the\nabove manner in respect of non-performing shares where dividends are in arrears shall not be\nallowed to be set-off against appreciation on other performing preference shares.f) The preference share should not be valued above its redemption value.\ng) When a preference share has been traded on stock exchange within 15 days prior to the valuation\ndate, the value should not be higher than the price at which the share was traded.\nEquity Shares\n28. Equity shares for which current quotations are not available or where the shares are not quoted\non the stock exchanges, should be valued at break-up value (without considering \u2018revaluation\nreserves\u2019, if any) which is to be ascertained from the company\u2019s latest balance sheet (which should\nnot be more than one year prior to the date of valuation).

The thrust of new\nlicensing policy and revised entry point norms are delineated below:\nRevised policy approach\nThe thrust of revised licensing policy is on strong start up capital and corporate governance.\nAccordingly, it has been decided to revise the entry point norms (EPN), and prescribe 4\ncategories of EPN based on population criteria. Revised EPN are set out in Annexure 'A'.\nBesides EPN, corporate governance assumes significant importance in running UCBs on\nsound lines, following eligibility criteria have been prescribed for promoters of new UCBs.\n(a) There should at all times be at least two directors with suitable banking experience or\npersons with relevant professional qualifications i.e., Chartered Accountants with banking\nexperience.\n(b) The promoters should not be defaulters to any financial institution/bank/cooperative\nbank/cooperative society, etc.\n(c) No criminal proceedings should have been instituted against the promoters\n(d) Promoters should not be associated as director with any chit fund/NBFC/ cooperative\nbank.\nViability Norms\nRBI have examined the relevance of continuance of existing viability standards in the context\nof application of prudential norms and relative regulatory prescriptions for UCBs and it has\nbeen decided to dispense with these norms. Hence, the viability norms prescribed in our\ncircular dated May 25,1993 stand withdrawn for the existing as well as new banks.\nUnit Banks\nMany UCBs function as unit banks (single branch banks) confining to compact geographical\nlocations. The initial infrastructure expenditure requited for unit banks may be relatively\nlower than the banks which intend to open branches. It has, therefore, been decided to\nprescribe 50% relaxation in entry point capital for the banks which propose to set up as unit\nbanks i.e. \u2018Single branch bank is given without any branches. EPN prescription for unit banks\nhas been furnished in Annexure \u2018B\u2019. However, an UCB which subsequently desires to open a\nbranch/branches has to necessarily enhance its capital to the level requited for setting up of a\nnew bank as applicable to the centre where its registered office is located or where the branch\nis proposed to be opened, whichever is higher.\nRelaxation in EPN for special categories of banks\nThe relevance of continuation of relaxation in EPN for banks organised by mahilas, SCs/STs,\nbanks organised in less/least developed areas, North Eastern States, Sikkim, Daman, Diu,\nAndaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep regions and tribal and desert areas declared by\nthe specified authority of the State concerned has been re-examined in the context of HPC\nrecommendations and it has been decided to continue with the existing relaxation in EPN to\nthese categories of banks. The EPN for these categories of banks are given in Annexure \u2018B\u2019\n& \u2018C\u2019. Less/Least developed areas are required to be notified as backward by the respectiveState Government. It is needless to mention that the criteria for determining the backwardness\nshould be based on socio-economic indices rather than strength of urban co-operative\nbanking movement in that area. It is also clarified that membership of Mahila Banks should\nexclusively confine to women and they should not resort to enrolment of male members as\n\u2018A\u2019 category or nominal members. In the case of banks organized by SCs/STs, at least 51%\nof the credit deployed by such banks should necessarily go to SC/ST members of such banks.\nIt is also clarified that promoters cannot seek multiple relaxation in EPNs on the grounds of\nspecial category and for organisation of unit banks. Illustratively, if promoters desire to set up\na bank in less developed area of \u2018D\u2019 category centre, they have to mobilise Rs.12.5 lakh entry\npoint capital irrespective of the fact whether the proposed bank intends to function as a unit\nbank or multi-branch bank.\nAnnexure \u2013 A\n(Rs.

BC. 201/ 07.01.279/ 2000-2001 dated\nOctober 10, 2000 enclosing a copy of the Statement on \u201cMid-term Review of Monetary\nand Credit Policy for the year 2000-2001\u201d.   The guidelines in regard to some of the\npolicy measures contained in paragraphs 41, 44 and 49 of the Statement are given below :-\n1.  Certificates of Deposits (CDs) Scheme\nIn terms of circular DBOD No.Dir. BC.36/13.03.00/98 dated April 29, 1998, the\nminimum  lock-in period for CDs was reduced to 15 days from the date of issue.   With a\nview to providing flexibility and depth to secondary market ,  it has now been decided to\nwithdraw the restriction on transferability period for CDs issued by banks.\n2. Provision on Standard Assets \u2013\nInclusion in Tier II capital\nIn terms of paragraph 3 of circular DBOD No.BP.BC.164/ 21.04.048/ 2000  dated  April\n24, 2000 , the provision on \u2018Standard Assets\u2019 is not eligible for inclusion in Tier II\ncapital. In line with the international best practices followed in this regard, it has been\ndecided to allow banks to include the \u2018General Provisions on Standard Assets\u2019 in Tier II\ncapital.  However, the provisions on standard assets  together with other \u2018general\nprovisions/ loss reserves\u2019 will be admitted as Tier II capital up to a maximum of 1.25 per\ncent of the total  risk weighted assets.\n3.   Annexing Balance Sheets of Subsidiaries2to Parent Bank\u2019s Balance Sheet\nBanks were advised, vide paragraph 3 of circular  DBOD No. BP. BC. 169\n/21.01.002/2000 dated May 3, 2000, to voluntarily build in the risk-weighted components\nof their subsidiaries into their own balance sheet on notional basis, at par with the risk\nweights applicable to the bank\u2019s own assets and earmark additional capital in their books,\nin phases, beginning from the year ending March, 2001.  In this connection, it may be\nmentioned that at present public sector banks are not required to annex the balance sheets\nof their subsidiaries to their balance sheet unlike other banking companies which are\nrequired to do so under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956.  In order to bring\nmore transparency to the balance sheets of the public sector banks and as a further step\ntowards consolidated supervision and to provide additional disclosures, it has been\ndecided that beginning from the year ending March, 2001, public sector banks should also\nannexe the Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss account, Report of the Board of Directors, and\nthe Report of the Auditors in respect of each of their subsidiaries, to their own balance\nsheets.\n4. Asset Classification \u2013 \u2018Past  Due\u2019 Concept\nUnder the extant guidelines on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning,\nan asset is classified as NPA based on the period for which the amounts due in the\naccount remained \u2018past due\u2019. In paragraph 1 of our circular DBOD.BP.BC.59/21.04.043-\n92 dated December 17,1992, it has been clarified that an amount should be considered\n\u201cpast due\u201d when it remains outstanding for 30 days beyond due date.  Due to the\nimprovements in the payment and settlement systems, recovery climate, upgradation of\ntechnology in the banking system, etc., it has been decided to dispense with \u2018past due\u2019\nconcept, with effect from March 31, 2001.  Accordingly, as from that date, a Non-\nperforming Asset (NPA) shall be an advance where\ni) interest and/or instalment of principal remain overdue for a period of more\nthan 180 days in respect of a Term Loan,\nii) the account remains \u2018out of order\u2019 for a period of more than 180 days, in\nrespect of an Overdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC),\niii) the bill remains overdue for a period of more than 180 days in the case of\nbills purchased and discounted,3iv) interest and/or instalment of principal remains overdue for two harvest\nseasons but for a period not exceeding two half years in the case of an\nadvance granted for agricultural purposes, and\nv) any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than 180\ndays in respect of other accounts.\n5.  Charging of Penal Interest\nIn terms of circular DBOD.No.DIR.BC.70/C-96-76 dated 26th June 1976, read with\ncircular DBOD.No.DIR.BC.88/C-96-89 dated March 8, 1989, banks have been advised\nabout the overall penal/additional interest to be charged by banks, which should not\nexceed 2 per cent over and above the rate of interest applicable/normally charged to the\nrespective borrowers. It may be mentioned that since issue of the above instructions,\ninterest rates on loans and deposits have been substantially deregulated and banks' Boards\nhave been empowered to formulate policy on lending rates taking into account their cost\nof fund, the underlying credit risk, etc. Since the Boards have been empowered to decide\nthe Prime Lending Rate (PLR) as also the spread over PLR, it is felt that the decision on\npenal interest that should be levied for reasons such as default in repayment, non-\nsubmission of financial statements, etc., should also be left to the Boards of each bank.\nThis would also give further operational autonomy to the banks. It has, therefore, been\ndecided that banks may formulate transparent policy for charging penal interest rates,\nwith the approval of their Boards. The policy should be governed by well accepted\nprinciples of transparency, fairness, incentive to service the debt and due regard to\ngenuine difficulties of customers.\n6.   Margins on credit for free sale sugar\nIn terms of circular DBOD.No.DIR.BC.126/13.08.01/97 dated October 21, 1997, the\nminimum margin on levy sugar was 10 per cent while the free sale sugar was subject to a\nmargin of 15 per cent and the buffer stock was at zero per cent margin. On a review of\nmarket conditions and with a view to providing the flexibility to banks in prescribing\nmargins, it has been decided to withdraw the existing prescriptions under selective credit\ncontrol on free sale sugar. Margins in respect of free sale sugar will be decided by the\nbanks based on their commercial judgement. The prescribed margins of 10 per cent in\nrespect of levy stock and zero margin in respect of buffer stocks will continue without4change. An amending directive dated October 10, 2000 in this regard is enclosed and the\nrevised instructions shall come into effect from the same date.\n 7.

In this context, the\nGroup has recommended the mechanism of sub-allocation of limits, within the overall\nworking capital limits sanctioned to their corporate borrowers, for meeting their\npayment obligations to SSI units.\n2. In the light of the decision taken by the Group of Ministers, banks are advised to take\nfollowing measures with immediate effect:\n(i) Banks may, while sanctioning/renewing credit limits to their large\ncorporate borrowers (i.e. borrowers enjoying working capital limits of\nRs. 10 crore and above from the banking system), fix separate sub-\nlimits, within the overall limits, specifically for meeting payment\nobligations in respect of purchases from SSIs either on cash basis or on\nbill basis.(ii) The size of such sub-limits may be decided taking into account the\nprojected purchases by corporate borrowers from the SSIs during a year\nin relation to their total purchases and other relevant factors.\n(iii)  Further, with a view to ensuring availability of adequate balance in the\naccount for meeting the payment obligations to SSI units, banks may\nensure that sale proceeds/other receipts of the borrower are credited to\nthis account on a pro rata  basis.\n3. The above arrangement is expected to ensure availability of adequate funds for\nmaking timely payment by the corporate borrowers of banks to their SSI creditors.\nHowever, banks should closely monitor the operations in the sub-limits, particularly\nwith reference to their corporate borrowers\u2019 dues to SSI units. For the purpose, banks\nmay ascertain periodically from their corporate borrowers, the extent of their dues to SSI\nsuppliers and ensure that the corporates pay off such dues before the  appointed day\n/agreed date as defined/indicated in Section 2(b) and 3 of the Interest on Delayed\nPayments to Small Scale and Ancillary Undertakings Act, 1993  (32 of 1993)  by using\nthe balance available in the sub\u2013limit so created. If , at any time, the sub-limit is\nexhausted there is no bar on such payments being made from the other segment of the\nworking capital limit.  Similarly, if no payments are due to SSI suppliers, and the sub-\nlimit remains unutilised/partly utilised, banks may allow their corporate borrowers to\noperate this limit for meeting other working capital expenses.\n4.

CP as a privately placed instrument, was introduced in India\nin 1990 with a view to enabling highly rated corporate borrowers to diversify their\nsources of short-term borrowings and to provide an additional instrument to investors.\nSubsequently, primary dealers and satellite dealers were also permitted to issue CP to\nenable them to meet their short-term funding requirements for their operations.\nGuidelines for issue of CP are presently governed by various directives issued by the\nReserve Bank of India, as amended from time to time.  In pursuance of the Statement on\nMonetary and Credit Policy for the Year 2000 - 2001, to keep pace with several\ndevelopments in the financial market, it has been decided to modify the guidelines in the\nlight of recommendations made by an Internal Group. Now, the Reserve Bank inexercise of the powers conferred by Sections 45 J, 45 K and 45 L of the Reserve Bank of\nIndia Act, 1934 (2 of 1934) issues the following guidelines replacing all earlier\ndirections/guidelines on the subject :\nWho can issue Commercial Paper (CP)\n2.Corporates, primary dealers (PDs) and satellite de alers (SDs), and the all-India\nfinancial institutions (FIs) that have been permitted to raise short-term resources under\nthe umbrella limit fixed by Reserve Bank of India are eligible to issue CP.\n3.A corporate would be eligible to issue CP provided - ( a) the tangible net worth of\nthe company, as per the latest audited balance sheet, is not less than Rs. 4 crore; (b)\ncompany has been sanctioned working capital limit by bank/s or all-India financial\ninstitution/s; and (c) the borrowal account of the company is classified as a Standard\nAsset by the financing bank/s/ institution/s.\nRating Requirement\n4.All eligible participants shall obtain the credit rating for issuance of Commercial\nPaper  from either the Credit Rating Information Services of India Ltd.

Ltd. or such other\ncredit rating agency (CRA) as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of India from time\nto time, for the purpose.  The minimum credit rating shall be P-2 of CRISIL or such\nequivalent rating by other agencies.  The issuers shall ensure at the time of issuance of\nCP that the rating so obtained is current and has not fallen due for review.\nMaturity\n5.CP can be issued for maturities between a minimum of 15 days and a maximum\nupto one year from the date of issue.\nDenominations6.CP can be issued in denominations of Rs.5 lakh or multiples thereof. Amount\ninvested by single investor should not be less than Rs.5 lakh (face value).\nLimits and the Amount of Issue of CP\n7.CP can be issued as a \"stand alone\" product.   The aggregate amount of CP from\nan issuer shall be within the limit as approved by its Board of Directors. Banks and FIs\nwill, however, have the flexibility to fix working capital limits duly taking into account\nthe resource pattern of companies\u2019 financing including CPs.\n8. An FI can issue CP within the overall umbrella limit fixed by the RBI i.e., issue of CP\ntogether with other instruments viz., term money borrowings, term deposits, certificates\nof deposit and inter-corporate deposits should not exceed 100 per cent of its net owned\nfunds, as per the latest audited balance sheet.\n9. The total amount of CP proposed to be issued should be raised within a period of two\nweeks from the date on which the issuer opens the issue for subscription.  CP may be\nissued on a single date or in parts on different dates provided that in the latter case, each\nCP shall have the same maturity date.\nEvery CP issue should be reported to the Chief General Manager, Industrial and Export\nCredit Department (IECD), Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai through the\nIssuing and Paying Agent  (IPA) within three days from the date of completion of the\nissue, incorporating details as per Schedule  II.\n10.Every issue of CP, including renewal, should be treated as a fresh issue.\nWho can act as Issuing and Paying Agent (IPA)\n11.Only a scheduled bank can act as an IPA for issuance of C P.\nInvestment in CP12.CP may be issued to and held by individuals, banking companies, other\ncorporate bodies registered or incorporated in India and unincorporated bodies, Non-\nResident Indians (NRIs) and Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs).  However,\ninvestment by FIIs would be within the limits set for their investments by Securities and\nExchange  Board of India (SEBI).\nMode of Issuance\n13. CP can be issued either in the form of a promissory note (Schedule I) or in a\ndematerialised form through any of the depositories approved by and registered with\nSEBI.   As regards the existing stock of CP, the same can continue to be held either in\nphysical form or can be demateralised, if both the issuer and the investor agree for the\nsame.\n14. CP will be issued at a discount to face value as may be determined by the issuer.\n15.No issuer shall have the issue of Commercial Paper underwritten or   co-\naccepted.\nPreference for Dematerialised form\n16.While option is available to both issuers and subscrib ers, to issue/hold CP in\ndematerialised or physical form, issuers and subscribers are encouraged to prefer\nexclusive reliance on dematerialised form of issue/holding. Banks, Financial\nInstitutions, PDs and SDs are advised to invest and hold CPs only in dematerialised\nform, as soon as arrangements for such dematerialisation are put in place.\nPayment of CP\n17.The initial investor in CP shall pay the discounted value of the CP by means of a\ncrossed account payee cheque to the account of the issuer through IPA. On maturity of\nCP, when the CP is held in physical form, the holder of the CP shall present the\ninstrument for payment to the issuer through the IPA.  However, when the CP is held indemat form, the holder of the CP will have to get it redeemed through the depository and\nreceive payment from the IPA.\nStand-by Facility\n18.In view of  CP being a `stand alone\u2019 product, it would not be obligatory in any\nmanner on the part of banks and FIs to provide stand-by facility to the issuers of CP.\nBanks and FIs would, however, have the flexibility to provide for a CP issue, credit\nenhancement by way of stand-by assistance/credit backstop facility, etc., based on their\ncommercial judgement and as per terms prescribed by them.  However, these should be\nwithin the prudential norms as applicable and subject to specific approval of the Board.\nProcedure for Issuance\n19.Every issuer must appoint an IPA for issuance of CP.  The issuer should disclose\nto the potential investors its financial position as per the standard market practice. After\nthe exchange of deal confirmation between the investor and the issuer, issuing company\nshall issue physical certificates to the investor or arrange for crediting\nthe CP to the investor's account with a depository. Investors shall be given a copy of\nIPA certificate to the effect that the issuer has a valid agreement with the IPA and\ndocuments are in order (Schedule III).\nRole and Responsibilities\n20.The role and responsibilities of issuer, IPA and CRA are set out below :\n(a)  Issuer\nWith the simplification in the procedures for CP issuance, issuers would now\nhave more flexibility.  Issuers would, however, have to ensure that the  guidelines and\nprocedures laid down for CP issuance  are strictly adhered to.\n(b)  Issuing and Paying Agent (IPA)(i)IPA would ensure that issuer has the minimum credit rating as stipulated by the\nRBI and amount mobilised through issuance of CP is within the quantum indicated by\nCRA for the specified rating.\n(ii)IPA has to verify all the document s submitted by the issuer viz., copy of board\nresolution, signatures of authorised executants (when CP in physical form) and issue a\ncertificate that documents are in order.  It should also certify that it has a valid\nagreement with the issuer (Schedule III).\n(iii)Original documents verified by the IPA should be held in the custody of\nIPA.\n(c)  Credit Rating Agency (CRA)\n(i)Code of Conduct prescribed by the SEBI for CRAs for undertaking rating of\ncapital market instruments shall be applicable to them (CRAs) for rating CP.\n(ii)Further, the credit rating agency would henceforth have the discretion to\ndetermine the validity period of the rating depending upon its perception about the\nstrength of the issuer.  Accordingly, CRA shall at the time of rating, clearly indicate the\ndate when the rating is due for review.\n(iii)While the CRAs can decide the validity period of credit rating, CRAs would\nhave to closely monitor the rating assigned to issuers vis-a-vis their track record at\nregular intervals and would be required to make its revision in the ratings public through\nits publications and website.\n21.Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA),\nas a self-regulatory organisation (SRO) for the fixed income money market securities,\nmay prescribe, for operational flexibility and smooth functioning of CP market, any\nstandardised procedure and documentation that are to be followed by the participants, in\nconsonance with the international best practices.  Till such time, the\nprocedures/documentations prescribed by IBA should be followed.22.Violation of these guidelines will attract penalties prescribed in the Act by the\nRBI and may also include debarring from the CP market.\nNon-applicability of Certain Other Directions\n23.Nothing contained in the Non-Banking Financial Companies Acceptance of\nPublic Deposits (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998 shall apply to any non-banking\nfinancial company (NBFC) insofar as it relates to acceptance of deposit by issuance of\nCP, in accordance with these Guidelines.\n24.Definitions of certain terms used in the Guidelines are provided in the Annexure.\nReserve Bank of India,\nIndustrial and Export Credit Department,\nMumbai - 400 001.\nOctober 10, 2000.ANNEXURE\nDefinitions\nIn these guidelines, unless the context otherwise requires :\n(a) \"bank\u201d or \u201cbanking company\" means a banking company as defined in clause (c)\nof Section 5 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949) or a\n\"corresponding new bank\", \"State Bank of India\" or \"subsidiary bank\" as defined\nin clause (da), clause (nc) and clause (nd) respectively thereof and includes a\n\"co-operative bank\" as defined in clause (cci) of Section 5 read with Section 56\nof that Act.\n(b) \u201cscheduled bank\u201d means a bank included in the Second Schedule of the Reserve\nBank of India Act, 1934.\n(c) \u201cAll-India Financial Institutions (FIs)\u201d mean those financial institutions which\nhave been permitted specifically by the Reserve Bank of India to raise resources\nby way of Term Money, Term Deposits and Certificates of Deposit within\numbrella limit.\n(d) \"Primary Dealer\" means a financial institution which holds a valid letter of\nauthorisation as a Primary Dealer issued by the Reserve Bank, in terms of the\n\"Guidelines for Primary Dealers in Government Securities Market\" dated March\n29, 1995, as amended from time to time.\n(e) \"Satellite Dealer\" means a financial institution which holds a valid letter of\nauthorisation as a Satellite Dealer issued by the Reserve Bank, in terms of the\n\"Guidelines for Satellite Dealers in Government Securities Market\" dated\nDecember 31, 1996, as amended from time to time.(f) \"corporate\u201d or \u201ccompany\" means a company as defined in Section 45 I (aa) of\nthe Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 but does not include a company which is\nbeing wound up under any law for the time being in force.\n(g) \"non-banking company\" means a company other than banking company.\n(h) \u201cnon-banking financial company\u201d means a company as defined in Section 45 I\n(f) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.\n(i) \u201cworking capital limit\u201d means the aggregate limits, including those by way of\npurchase/discount of bills sanctioned by one or more banks/FIs for meeting the\nworking capital requirements.\n(j) \"Tangible net worth\" means the paid-up capital plus free reserves (including\nbalances in the share premium account, capital and debentures redemption\nreserves and any other reserve not being created for repayment of any future\nliability or for depreciation in assets or for bad debts or reserve created by\nrevaluation of assets) as per the latest audited balance sheet of the company, as\nreduced by the amount of accumulated balance of loss, balance of deferred\nrevenue expenditure, as also other intangible assets.\n(k) words and expressions used but not defined herein and defined in the Reserve\nBank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934) shall have the same meaning as assigned to\nthem in that Act.\n-------------------------", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/16259.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 10, 2000", "info": "Export Credit - Suggestions  from exporters\nfor improvement in  procedures - action points\nTELEGRAMS : \"RESERVBANK\" MUMBAI\nTELEPHONE } 266 1602\nFAX No. 022-2660407\nRBInet - bomiecd\nE-mail - rbibiecd@giasbmo1.vsnl.net.inRESERVE BANK OF INDIA\nINDUSTRIAL & EXPORT CREDIT\nDEPARTMENT\nCENTRAL OFFICE\nCENTRAL OFFICE BUILDING\nPOST BAG 10030\nMUMBAI - 400 001\nIECD No 4/04.02.02/2000-2001\nOctober 10, 2000\nThe Chairmen/Chief Executives\nof all Commercial banks\nDear Sir,\nExport Credit - Suggestions from exporters\nfor improvement in procedures - action points\nPlease refer to paragraphs 25 and 49(d) of the Statement on Mid-term Review of\nMonetary and Credit Policy for the year 2000-2001 enclosed to letter No.\nMPD.BC.201/07.01.279/2000-01dated October 10, 2000 regarding the suggestions received\nfrom export organisations and exporters on further improvement of procedures for export credit\ndelivery. As stated therein, these suggestions have been examined by the Bankers' Group and\nRBI, and banks are advised to implement the following recommendations of the Bankers' Group.\n2. In cases where the export credit limits are utilised fully, banks may adopt a\nflexible approach in negotiating the bills drawn against LCs and consider in such cases\ndelegating discretionary/higher sanctioning powers to branch managers to meet the credit\nrequirements of the exporters. Similarly, branches may also be authorised to disburse a certain\npercentage of the enhanced/ adhoc limits, pending sanction by higher authorities/board/committee\nwho had originally accorded sanctions, to enable the exporters to execute urgent export orders in\ntime.\n3.It is reported that banks are hesitant to waive submission of order/LC even in respect of\nexporters with good track record as settlement of claims, if any, by ECGC is adversely affected2\nby such waivers. ECGC has reported that any waiver of submission of order/LC should form part\nof the terms of sanction of the export credit limits and should be communicated to ECGC. Where\nsuch waivers are permitted ab-initio  and the system of obtaining periodical statement of\noutstanding orders/ LCs on hand has been put in place, the same may be incorporated in the\nsanction proposals as well as in the sanction letters issued to exporters and appropriately brought\nto the notice of ECGC. Further, if such waivers are permitted at a time subsequent to sanction of\nexport credit limits with the approval of the appropriate authority, the same may be incorporated\nin the terms of sanction by way of amendments and communicated to ECGC.\n4.

However, there have been a few instances of gridlock in the\nDVP system due to shortfall of funds on a gross basis in the current account of one or more SGL\naccount holders.  To take care of such unusual and exceptional occurrences, a scheme of Special\nFund Facility for Security Settlement is being introduced as a follow up of the Monetary and Credit\nPolicy announcement for the Year 2000-2001 on April 27, 2000. It has been decided to implement\nthe Scheme with effect from October 3, 2000. The scheme is detailed in the following paragraphs.\n1. Objective\nDelivery versus Payment (DVP) system that involves simultaneous transfer of securities and funds\nin government securities transactions, was introduced with effect from  July 1995 to alleviate\ncounterparty settlement risk. Under this system trades are settled on a gross trade by trade basis\nwith irrevocable final settlement taking place simultaneously for securities and funds, on ensuring\nthat there are sufficient funds in buyers account and sufficient securities  in sellers account. With\nthe increase in  government securities transactions, the cases of transactions failing to settle due to\nshortfall of funds on a gross basis in the current accounts of one or more SGL account holders is\npossible especially where transactions are linked.\nThe objective of the new scheme is to provide intra-day funds to banks and primary dealers ( PDs)\nfor facilitating settlement of securities  transactions in case of gridlock. In such cases, the intra-day\nfacility will not become an overnight credit.  It will be available for settlement relating to their\ntransactions in Government of India dated Securities, Treasury Bills and State Government\nsecurities in their own SGL accounts as well as in constituent SGL accounts.   The scheme provides\nfor automatic invocation of funds facility against undrawn Collateralised Lending Facility\n(CLF)/Level I - PD Liquidity Support (PDLS).\n2. Eligibility\nBanks and Primary Dealers who are eligible to avail of CLF/LSF from the Reserve Bank at the\nBank Rate will be eligible for special intra day fund facility for securities settlement. The special\nfund facility will be available against the amount of undrawn CLF/PDLS by banks/primary dealers\nthrough collateralised intra-day credit from  the Reserve Bank.\n3.Rate of Interest\nThe interest rate on funds provided to a participant under the scheme will be charged at the  Bank\nRate. The interest  cost   will   be shared equally among  all beneficiary participants involved in the\nsettlement of linked securities transactions. In addition, a flat fee of Rs.25 per transaction would be\ncharged from each of the  beneficiary participants.\n4. Special Intra-Day Fund LimitSpecial Intra-day Fund limit would be the  undrawn balance against CLF/PDLS and drawal would\nbe restricted to 95 per cent of face value of outstanding securities in Reverse Repo Constituent SGL\naccount (RRCSGL)  of a participant after providing for successful bids in Reverse Repo auctions.\n5. Eligible securities\nAll transferable Government of India dated securities and treasury bills (except 14 day  treasury\nbills) will be eligible instruments for  automatic invocation of special intra-day fund facility  from\nthe Reserve Bank.\n6. Margin Requirement\nThe margin will be uniformly applied in respect of  Govt. of India dated securities and treasury bills\nheld in the RRCSGL Account. The amount of securities that will be transferred from RRCSGL\nAccount of the participant for extending special fund facility for securities settlement, will be 105\nper cent of fund amount (rounded off to higher lakh) in terms of face value.\n7. Settlement of Transactions\nThe special intra-day funds extended by RBI to a participant for  settlement of securities\ntransactions will be reversed on the same day by debiting the current account of the participant.\nSimilarly, securities transferred from RRCSGL to RBIs account will also be reversed on the same\nday.\n8. SLR and Securities held in RRCSGL Account of RBI\nThe securities held in RRCSGL account in  custody by  RBI on behalf of the constituents will be\ncounted for SLR purposes. A certificate giving daily balance of securities held in the  participants\u2019\nname in RRCSGL Account will be issued by RBI on a fortnightly basis.\n9. Mechanics of the operations\n(i)  The RRCSGL Account  which is already operational for securities operations facilitating\nReverse Repos auctions under Liquidity Adjustment Facility will be used for this scheme.  The\nparticipant-wise security account in RRCSGL Account will be maintained by the Securities\nDepartment of Mumbai Office.\n(ii)  Banks/Primary Dealers intending to avail of this facility would be required to transfer the\nsecurities being offered from their main SGL accounts as collateral  to the constituent account of\nRRCSGL Account  along with required SGL transfer forms duly executed by them  within the cut-\noff time of 14.00 hours on all  working days (except Saturdays) and 11.00 hours on Saturdays.

The\nReport of the Committee submitted on 2nd  August, 2000 was placed on the RBI  Website\nsoliciting  comments on the proposals  made by the Committee  from  banks,  financial\ninstitutions  and other market  participants.  A  meeting  with  Chief  Executives of   major\nbanks was also taken by the  Deputy  Governor, Shri  S. P. Talwar,  on 19th  September, 2000\nto  elicit  the  views of the  banks  on the  recommendations  made  by the Committee.  Keeping\nin view  the  views expressed  by  the bankers in the meeting   as also by other  market\nparticipants,  the  following  draft  guidelines on  bank  financing of equities  and investment  in\nshares, based on the report of the RBI-SEBI Committee are being issued,  for  comments  from\nbanks,  financial  institutions  and other interested  participants.\n(i)     Financing of  Initial Public  Offerings ( IPOs)\n [a]  The  financing of IPOs  should be treated  as  advances  against  shares to individuals.\nAccordingly ,  as recommended by the RBI-SEBI Committee, the terms  and conditions  for\nfinancing of IPOs should be the same  as  those  applicable  to  advances  against shares to\nindividuals.   The maximum amount  of   finance  that  can be  extended to an individual\nagainst  IPOs  should, however,  be  Rs.10 lakh,  as  applicable  to  advances  against  physical\nshares.   The corporates should not be extended credit by banks for investment in other\ncompanies\u2019 IPOs.  Similarly, banks should not provide finance to NBFCs for further lending to\nindividuals for IPOs.\n[b]   Finance  extended by a  bank for IPOs  should be reckoned  as  an exposure to capital\nmarket.\n(ii)  Issue  of  guarantees on behalf of brokers\nBanks  should  obtain a  minimum  margin  of  25%  inclusive of  cash margin,  for issue of\nguarantees  on behalf of  share brokers.  Banks  may,  at their  discretion,  obtain margin higher\nthan  25% as per the policy  approved by their Board of Directors.\n(iii)  Total  exposure2\nThe Board  of Directors of  banks  may  lay down  a prudential ceiling  on the bank\u2019s\naggregate exposure  to  capital  market,  keeping in view  the overall  risk profile.  The\nfollowing   may  be excluded  for  reckoning  the bank\u2019s  aggregate  exposure  to  capital\nmarket :\n[a]    Advances  against collateral  security of shares,\n[b]  Advances to individuals for  personal purposes  like  education,  housing, consumption, etc.\nagainst  the  security of shares.\n[c]    Credit substitutes like  Commercial  Paper,  non convertible debenture, etc.   may not be\nreckoned  as part of  credit portfolio for  arriving at the  bank\u2019s  exposure to capital  market.\n(iv)  Banks\u2019  investments in shares  and  debentures\n[a]  In  terms of  circular  DBOD. No. Dir. BC.61/13.07.05 ./94  dated May  18, 1994,  banks\nare  free to acquire shares  and /or  convertible  debentures  of  corporates subject to a ceiling\nof  5% of the incremental  deposits of the previous year.  This is  an  annual  ceiling  and   no\ncumulative  ceiling has been prescribed  for  banks\u2019 aggregate  investments  in  shares  and\nconvertible debentures. As recommended by the RBI-SEBI Committee, it is proposed that  the\nceiling prescribed for banks\u2019 investments in shares, convertible debentures, etc.  should  be\nrelated to outstanding advances  and  not  to incremental  deposits of  the previous year  and\nthat  within the overall exposure to sensitive  sectors, the exposure to capital  market  by way of\ninvestments  in shares, convertible debentures  and units of   mutual funds  should not exceed\n5% of the banks\u2019 total  outstanding credit as on 31st March of the previous year. It is clarified\nthat this ceiling for investment  in shares  is  not  mandatory .  Consequently ,  it is not\nobligatory  on the part of  banks to  invest in equity shares, convertible  debentures and units of\nequity oriented mutual funds upto their  eligible  limit.  Keeping in view the volatility of capital\nmarket and the bank\u2019s overall risk profile, the Boards of  Directors  of each bank  shall\nformulate  its  policy on  exposure to capital  market.\n[b]    The extent  upto which  banks  may  make  investment in shares directly  or  through UTI\nand SEBI approved other diversified mutual  funds with good track records, will be as per the\ninvestment policy approved by the  Board of Directors  keeping  in view  the in-house expertise\navailable within the bank.  The operational aspects  including the decision on  investments\nshall be taken by the Investment Committee set up by the bank.\n[c] Under the extant instructions, banks are required to mark to market their investment\nportfolio in equities like other investments  on quarterly basis.  Further, banks may disclose\ntheir investment in shares in their balance sheets on the same lines as advances against shares.3\n[d] The Standing Technical Committee of RBI-SEBI will review these guidelines a fter six\nmonths based on the feed back received from banks and other market participants.\nThe draft guidelines are being put on the RBI web-site, www.rbi.org.in , and are also being\nforwarded to select banks and other market participants for comments on the above proposals\nby 30th September 2000 whereafter the Reserve Bank of India will finalise the guidelines.

The Customs  serial  number  will have ten numerals denoting\nthe  code  number  of  the port of shipment,  the  calendar  year  and a six digit running serial\nnumber.   Customs will certify the value declared by the exporter on both the copies of the\nGR form at  the  space  earmarked and  will also record the assessed value.  They will then\nreturn the duplicate copy of the form to the exporter and  retain  the  original  for transmission\nto Reserve Bank.    Exporters should submit  the duplicate copy\nof the GR form again to Customs along with the cargo to be shipped.   After  examination  of\nthe goods and certifying the quantity  passed  for  shipment   on   the duplicate  copy,\nCustoms will return it to the exporter  for  submission  to  the authorised dealer  for\nnegotiation or collection of export bills.\n(b)Within twenty one days from the date of export, exporter  should lodge the\nduplicate  copy together with relative shipping  documents  and an extra copy  of  the  invoice\nwith  the authorised dealer named in the GR form.   After the documents have  been\nnegotiated/sent for collection, the authorised dealer should report the transaction to Reserve\nBank  in  statement ENC  under cover of appropriate R-Supplementary Return.     The\nduplicate  copy  of  the  form together  with a  copy  of invoice will be retained by the\nauthorised dealer  till  full export  proceeds  have  been realised  and thereafter  submitted  to\nReserve  Bank duly certified  under  cover  of  appropriate R-Supplementary Return.\nNOTE: (i)In the case of exports made under deferred credit arrangement or to joint\nventures abroad against equity participation or under rupee credit agreement,\nthe number and date of Reserve Bank approval and/or number and date of the\nrelative RBI circular should be recorded at the appropriate  place on the GR\nform.\n (ii)Where Duplicate copy of GR form is misplaced or lost ,  authorised  dealer\nmay accept another copy of duplicate GR form duly certified by Customs.\n(c)On account of introduction of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) System at\ncertain Customs offices where shipping bills are processed electronically, the existing\ndeclaration in GR form is replaced by a declaration in form SDF (Statutory Declaration\nForm).  The SDF form should be submitted in duplicate (to be annexed to the relative\nshipping  bill)   to   the  concerned   Commissioner  of  Customs.      After   verifying   and\nauthenticating the declaration in form SDF, the Commissioner of Customs will hand over tothe exporter, one copy of  the  shipping bill marked \u2018Exchange Control Copy\u2019 in which form\nSDF has been appended for being submitted to the authorised dealer within 21 days from the\ndate of export.   The authorised dealer should accept the Exchange Control (EC) copy of the\nshipping bill and form SDF appended thereto, submitted by the exporter for collection/\nnegotiation of  Shipping documents.  The manner of disposal of EC copy of shipping Bill\n(and form SDF appended thereto) is same as that for GR forms.\n(d)In cases  where ECGC initially settles the claims of  exporters in respect  of\nexports insured with them and subsequently receives the export proceeds from the\nbuyer/buyer's country through the efforts made by them, the share of exporters  in  the\namount  so  received  is disbursed through the bank  which  had handled  the shipping\ndocuments.  In such cases, ECGC will issue a certificate to the bank which  had handled  the\nrelevant shipping documents after full proceeds have been received. The certificate  will\nindicate the number of declaration form, name  of  the exporter, name of the authorised\ndealer,   date  of  negotiation,  bill  number,  invoice  value  and  the  amount actually\nreceived  by  ECGC.  It will  be  in  order  for  authorised dealers  to certify the duplicate GR\nform/ EC copy of shipping bill  on the basis of the certificate issued by ECGC and submit\nthem to Reserve Bank.   The certificate issued  by  ECGC  may  also  be attached to the\nduplicate GR/SDF/PP form while forwarding them  to Reserve Bank.\n(e)Where a part of export proceeds are credited to EEFC account, the export\ndeclaration (duplicate) form may be certified as under:\n\"Proceeds     amounting     to    .........\nrepresenting .......% of the export realisation\ncredited  to  EEFC  account  maintained  by the\nexporter with..........\"\n(ii)The manner of disposal of PP forms is same as that for GR forms.  Postal authorities\nwill allow export of goods by post only if the original copy of the form has been\ncountersigned by an authorised dealer.  Therefore, PP forms should   be first presented by the\nexporter to an authorised dealer for countersignature.   Authorised dealer will countersign the\nforms in accordance with directions in paragraph B.2 and return the original copy to the\nexporter, who should submit the form to the post office with the parcel.   The duplicate copy\nof the PP form will be retained by the authorised dealer to whom the exporter should submit\nrelevant documents together with an extra copy of invoice for negotiation/collection, within\nthe prescribed period of twenty one days.\nB.2Counter signature on PP forms\nPP forms will be presented by the exporter to an authorised dealer for\ncountersignature. Authorised dealers should countersign the PP forms after  ensuring that the\nparcel is being addressed to their branch or correspondent bank in the country of  import.\nThe concerned overseas branch or correspondent should be instructed to deliver the parcel to\nconsignee against payment  or  acceptance of relative bill.   Authorised dealers may, however,\ncountersign PP forms covering parcels addressed direct to the consignees, provided\n(a)an irrevocable letter of credit for the full value of the  export has been opened in\nfavour of exporter and has been advised through authorised dealer concerned;\nor\n(b)the full value of the shipment has been received in advance by the exporter through\nan authorised dealer;\nor(c)the authorised dealer is satisfied,  on the basis of the standing and track record of the\nexporter and the arrangements  made  for  realisation  of  the  export proceeds, that\nhe could do so\nIn such cases, particulars of advance payment/letter of credit/ authorised dealer's certification\nof standing etc. of the exporter should be furnished on the form under proper authentication.\nAny alteration in the name  and  address of consignee on the PP  form  should also be\nauthenticated by the authorised dealer under his stamp   and signature.\nB.3.A.  Terms of payment - Invoicing - (Software)\n(i)In respect of long duration contracts involving series of transmissions, the\nexporters should bill their overseas clients periodically ,  i.e. at least once a month or on\nreaching  the  \"milestone\"  as  provided  in  the contract entered into with the overseas client\nand the last invoice/bill should  be  raised  not later  than  15 days form the date of\ncompletion of the contract. It would be in order for the exporters to submit a combined\nSOFTEX form for all the invoices raised on a particular overseas client, including advance\nremittances received in a month.\n(ii)In respect of  contracts  involving  only  'one  shot operation', the invoice/bill\nshould be raised within 15 days from the date of transmission.\n(iii)The exporter  should  submit  SOFTEX  form to the concerned official of\nGovernment  of   India  at  STPI/EPZ for valuation/certification  not  later than 30 days from\nthe date of invoice/the date of last invoice raised in a month,  as indicated above.\n(iv)The invoices raised on overseas clients as at ( i) to (iii) above will be subject to\nvaluation of export declared on SOFTEX form by the designated official of Government of\nIndia and consequent amendment made in the invoice value, if necessary.\nB.3.B.      Disposal of SOFTEX forms\nAs for disposal of SOFTEX forms the procedure indicated in Regulation 6 of Export\nRegulations is to be observed.  The authorised  dealers on receipt of the duplicate copy of the\nSOFTEX form from the exporter will after full realisation  of value declared on the form or as\ncertified by the designated officials (whichever is higher) submit it to Reserve Bank duly\ncertified, under cover of an appropriate \"R\u201d return along with a copy/ ies of invoice/s.\nB.4      Shut out Shipments and Short Shipments\n(i)When part of a shipment covered by a GR form already filed with Customs is\nshort-shipped , exporter must give notice of short shipment to Customs in form and manner\nprescribed.  In case of delay in obtaining certified short shipment  notice  from Customs,\nexporter should give an undertaking to the authorised dealer to the effect  that  he  has filed\nthe short-shipment notice with the Customs and that he will furnish  it as soon as it is\nobtained.   Authorised dealer should send the short shipment notice along with the GR\nduplicate to Reserve Bank.\n(ii)Where a shipment has been entirely shut out and there is delay in making\narrangements to re-ship, exporter will give notice in duplicate to Customs in the manner and\nin form prescribed for the purpose, attaching thereto the unused duplicate copy of GR form\nand the shipping bill. Customs will verify that the shipment was actually shut out, certify\ncopy of the notice as correct and forward it   to  Reserve  Bank  together  with  unusedduplicate  copy  of the GR form.   In this case, the original GR form received earlier from\nCustoms will be cancelled.  If the shipment is made subsequently, a fresh set of GR form\nshould be completed.\nB.5Consolidation of Air Cargo\nWhere air cargo is shippe d under consolidation, the airline company's   Master\nAirway  Bill  will  be  issued to the Consolidating Cargo Agent who will in turn issue  his\nown  House Airway  Bills ( HAWBs) to individual shippers.  Authorised dealers may\nnegotiate HAWBs only if the relative letter of credit specifically provides for negotiation of\nthese documents in lieu of Airway Bills issued by the airline company.\nB.6 Exports by Barges/Country Craft/Road Transport\nFollowing procedure should be adopted  by  exporters  for filing original copies  of\nGR/SDF forms where exports are made to neighbouring countries by road, rail or river\ntransport :\n(a) In  case  of  exports  by  barges/country  craft/road transport,  the  form should\nbe presented by exporter or his agent at the Customs  station  at  the  border\nthrough  which  the  vessel  or  vehicle  has to pass before crossing over to the\nforeign  territory.  For this purpose, exporter may arrange either to give the\nform to the person in charge of the vessel or vehicle or forward it  to  his\nagent  at  the  border for submission to Customs.\n(b) As regards exports by rail ,  Customs staff have  been posted  at  certain\ndesignated  railway stations for attending to Customs formalities. They will\ncollect the GR/SDF forms in  respect  of   goods  loaded  at   these  stations  so\nthat the goods may move  straight on to the foreign  country  without  further\nformalities  at  the border.   The list of designated railway stations is\nobtainable  from  the Railways.    In respect  of  goods loaded at stations other\nthan the designated  stations, exporters  must  arrange  to present GR/SDF\nforms to the Customs Officer at the Border Land Customs Station where\nCustoms formalities are completed.\n(c) In terms of an agreement on Border Trade between India and Myanmar ,\nexchange of certain specified locally produced commodities, by people living\nalong the India- Myanmar  border on both sides under barter trade arrangement\nas also trade in freely convertible currency, has been permitted as per\nguidelines issued by Reserve Bank to authorised  dealers from time to time.\nAuthorised dealers should follow strictly the guidelines.\nPART C \u2013 Authorised Dealer\u2019s Obligation\nC.1Delay in Submission of Shipping Documents by Exporters\nIn cases where exporters present do cuments pertaining  to exports  after the prescribed\nperiod of twenty one days from date of export, authorised  dealers  may  handle them  without\nprior approval of Reserve Bank, provided they are satisfied with the reasons for the delay.\nC.2Check-list for Scrutiny of Forms\nAuthorised dealer/exporter should verify the following :(i) Authorised   dealer should ensure that the number on the duplicate copy of a\nGR form presented to them is the same  as that  of  the  original  which is\nusually recorded on the Bill of Lading/Shipping bill  and the duplicate has\nbeen duly verified and authenticated by appropriate Customs authorities.  In\nthe case of SDF form, the Shipping Bill No. should be the same as that\nappearing on the Bill of Lading.\n(ii) Bill of Lading/Airway Bill issued on 'freight prepaid' basis may be accepted\nwhere the sale contract is on f.o.b., f.a.s.  etc.  basis provided the amount of\nfreight has been included in the invoice and the bill.   Conversely, in the case\nof c.i.f., c.&f. etc. contracts whose freight is sought to be paid at destination, it\nshould be ensured that the deduction made is only to the extent of freight\ndeclared on GR/SDF form or the actual amount of freight indicated  on  the\nBill  of Lading/Airway Bill, whichever is less. Likewise, where the marine\ninsurance  is taken by  the  exporters  on  buyer's  account, authorised dealer\nshould verify that the actual amount  paid  is received from the buyer through\ninvoice and the bill.\n(iii) The documents submitted do not reveal any material inter se discrepancies in\nregard to description of goods exported, export value or country of destination.\nNOTE:A.The export realisable value may be more than what was originally\ndeclared to/accepted by Customs on the  GR/SDF form  in certain\ncircumstances such  as  where  in c.i.f.  or c.&f. contracts, part or\nwhole of any freight increase taking place after the contract  was\nconcluded  is agreed to be borne by buyers or where as a result of\nsubsequent  devaluation of the currency of the contract, buyers have\nagreed to an increase in price.\nB. In cases where the documents are being negotiated by a person other\nthan the exporter who has signed GR/PP/SDF/SOFTEX Form in\nrespect of the concerned consignment of export, authorised dealers\nmay negotiate the documents after ensuring compliance with\nRegulation 12 of \u201cExport Regulations\u201d.\nC. In certain  lines  of  export  trade,  final settlement  of  price may be\ndependent on the results of quality analysis of samples  drawn  at  the\ntime of shipment;  but the results of  such analysis  will  become\navailable  only after the shipment has been made.  Sometimes,\ncontracts  may provide for payment of penalty for late shipment of\ngoods in conformity with trade practice concerning the commodity.   In\nthese cases, while exporters  declare  to Customs the full export value\nbased on the contract  price,  invoices  submitted  along with  shipping\ndocuments for negotiation / collection  may reflect a different value\narrived at after taking  into account the results of analysis of samples\nor late shipment penalty, as the case may be.\nAs  such  variations  stem  from the terms of contract, authorised dealers may\naccept them on  production  of documentary evidence after verifying  the\narithmetical accuracy of the calculations and on conforming the terms of\nunderlying contracts.\nC.3Trade DiscountBills in respect of exports by  sea or  air  which fall  short of the value declared on\nGR/SDF forms on account of trade discount may be accepted  for negotiation or  collection\nonly  if  the  discount has been declared by exporter on relative GR/SDF form at the time of\nshipment and accepted by Customs.\nC.4Advance Payments against Exports\nExporters may receive advance payments (with or without interest) from their\noverseas buyers. It should however, be ensured that the shipments made against the advance\npayments are monitored by the authorised  dealer through whom the advance payment is\nreceived.   The  appropriations  made against  every  shipment must be endorsed on the\noriginal copy of the inward remittance certificate issued for advance remittance.\nNOTE :Purchase of foreign exchange from the market for refunding advance payment\ncredited to EEFC account may be allowed only after utilising the entire\nbalances held in the exporter\u2019s EEFC accounts maintained at different\nbranches/banks .\nC.5Part Drawings\nIn certain lines of export trade ,  it is the practice to  leave a small part of the invoice\nvalue   undrawn  for payment after adjustment  due  to  differences in weight, quality, etc. to\nbe ascertained  after arrival and inspection,  weighment or analysis of the goods.   In such\ncases, authorised dealers may  negotiate bills, provided\n(a)the amount of undrawn balance is considered normal in  the  particular line  of\nexport trade,  subject to a maximum of 10 per cent of the full export value;\nand\n(b)an undertaking is obtained from exporter on the duplicate of GR/SDF/PP that\nhe  will  surrender/account for the balance proceeds of the shipment within the\nperiod  prescribed  for realisation.\n       NOTE : In cases where exporter has not been able to arrange for repatriation\nof the undrawn balance in spite of best efforts authorised dealers, on\nbeing satisfied with the bona fides of the case, may submit duplicate\ncopies of GR/PP/SDF forms to Reserve Bank duly certified for the\namount actually realised. Authorised  dealers should however, ensure\nthat the exporter has realised  at least the value for which the bill was\ninitially drawn (excluding undrawn  balances) or 90% of the value\ndeclared on GR/PP/SDF form, whichever is more and a period of one\nyear has elapsed from the date of shipment.\nC.6Consignment Exports\n(i) When goods have been exported on consignment basis, authorised dealer,\nwhile forwarding shipping documents to his overseas branch/ correspondent,\nshould instruct the latter to deliver them only against trust receipt/undertaking\nto deliver sale proceeds by a specified date within the period prescribed for\nrealisation of  proceeds  of  the export.  This procedure should be followed\neven if, according to the practice in certain trades, a bill for part of the\nestimated value is drawn in advance against the exports.\n(ii) The agents/consignees may deduct from sale proceeds of the goods expenses\nnormally incurred towards receipt, storage and sale of the goods, such aslanding charges, warehouse rent, handling charges, etc. and remit the net\nproceeds to the exporter.\n(iii) The Account Sales received from the Agent/Consignee should  be verified by\nthe authorised dealer before it is sent to Reserve Bank along with the relative\nduplicate  GR/SDF/PP  forms. Deductions in Account Sales should be\nsupported by bills/ receipts  in  original  except  in  case  of petty items like\npostage/cable charges, stamp duty etc.\nNOTES :A.     In case of goods exported on consignment basis, freight  and marine\n        insurance must  be arranged in India.\nB. Reserve Bank, on an application made to it may, permit individual\nexporters to hire warehouses abroad subject to such terms and conditions as it\nmay stipulate.\nC. Reserve Bank will permit, on application, exporters with satisfactory track\nrecord a longer period up to twelve months for realisation of export proceeds\nfor exports on consignment basis made to CIS countries and East European\ncountries financed in any permitted currency.\nC.7Despatch of Shipping Documents\n(i) While Authorised dealers should normally despatch shipping documents  to\ntheir overseas branches/ correspondents expeditiously, they may despatch\nshipping documents direct to the consignees or their agents resident in the\ncountry of  final  destination of goods in cases where advance payment or an\nirrevocable letter of credit has been received  for the  full value   of   the\nexport   shipment   and  the  underlying  sale contract/letter of credit  provides\nfor  despatch  of  documents direct  to  the consignee or his agent resident in\nthe country of final destination of goods.\n(ii) In  cases  not  covered  by  ( i) above also, authorised dealers may accede to the\nrequest of the exporter, for despatch  of  documents for whatever reason,\ndirect to the consignee/agent provided the exporter is a regular  customer and\nthe authorised dealer is satisfied, on the basis of standing and track record of\nthe exporter and the  arrangements made for realisation of export proceeds,\nthat the request can be acceded to.\n(iii) Documents in respect of goods or software which are accompanied with a\ndeclaration by the exporter that they are not more than rupees twenty five\nthousand in value and not declared on GR/SDF/PP/ SOFTEX  form, in terms\nof paragraph A.2 may be directly sent by the exporter to the consignee.\n(iv) Documents in respect of goods exported against 100% advance remittance, in\nterms of paragraph C.4 may be directly sent by the exporter to the consignee.\nC.8     Handing Over Negotiable Copy of Bill of Lading\nto Master of Vessel/Trade Representative\n     Authorised dealers may deliver one negotiable copy of the Bill of Lading to the Master of\nthe carrying  vessel or trade representative, in respect  of exports to certain landlocked\ncountries if the shipment is covered by an irrevocable letter of credit  and  the  documents\nconform strictly to the terms of the Letter of Credit which, inter alia, provides for such\ndelivery.\nC.9Export Bills Register(i) Authorised dealers should maintain Export Bills Register, in physical or electronic\nform. Details of  GR/SDF/PP form number, due date of payment, the fortnightly\nperiod of R Supplementary Return with  which ENC statement covering the\ntransaction was sent to Reserve Bank  and  the period of R Supplementary Return\nwith which the duplicate copy of GR/SDF/PP form is submitted to Reserve Bank\nshould be available.\n(ii) Authorised dealers should ensure that all types  of export  transactions are  entered  in\nthe Export  Bills Register and are given bill numbers  on  calendar  year basis (i.e.\nJanuary  to December).   The bill numbers should be recorded in ENC statement and\nother relevant returns submitted to Reserve Bank.\nC.10Follow-up of Overdue Bills\n(i) Authorised dealers should closely watch realisation of bills and in cases where bills\nremain outstanding, beyond the due date for payment  or 6 months from the date of\nexport, the matter should be promptly taken up with concerned exporter.  If the\nexporter  fails to  arrange  for  delivery  of the proceeds, within six months or seek\nextension  of  time  beyond  six  months  the  matter  should  be  reported  to  Reserve\nBank stating, where  possible, the  reason for  the  delay  in realisation of proceeds.\nThe duplicate copies of GR/SDF/PP forms should, however ,  continue to be held by\nauthorised dealer until full proceeds are realised except in case of undrawn balances\ncovered by Note under paragraph C.5. Authorised dealers should  follow  up export\noutstandings with exporters systematically and vigorously so that action  against\ndefaulting exporters does not get delayed.  Any laxity in the follow up of realisation\nof export proceeds by authorised dealers will be viewed seriously by Reserve Bank\nleading to the invocation  of the penal provision under  FEMA 1999.\n(ii) Authorised dealers should furnish to Reserve Bank, on half-yearly basis, a\nconsolidated statement in Form XOS giving details of all export bills outstanding\nbeyond six months from the date of export as at the end of June and December every\nyear. The statement should be submitted in triplicate within fifteen days from the\nclose of the relative half-year.\nC.11Reduction in Invoice Value on account of\nPrepayment of Usance Bills\nOccasionally, exporters may approach  authorised dealers for reduction in invoice\nvalue on account of cash discount to overseas buyers for prepayment of the usance bills.  In\nsuch cases authorised dealers may allow cash discount to  the  extent of amount\nof proportionate interest  on  the  unexpired  period   of   usance, calculated  at  the  rate of\ninterest  stipulated in the export contract or at the prime rate/LIBOR of the currency  of\ninvoice  where rate of interest is not stipulated in the contract.\nC.12Reduction in Value\nIf, after a bill has been negotiated  or  sent  for collection, the amount thereof is\ndesired to be reduced for  any reason, authorised dealer  may  approve such reduction, if\nsatisfied about genuineness of the request,  provided;\n(a) the reduction does not exceed 10% of invoice value\n(b) it does not relate to an export of\ni. gold or silver jewellery or articles made out of cut and polished diamonds,ii. commodities  subject  to  floor  price stipulations,\n(c) the exporter is not on the exporters' caution list of Reserve Bank, and\n(d)the exporter is advised to surrender proportionate export incentives  availed of,\nif any.\nIn the case of exporters who  have  been  in  the  export business  for  more than three years,\nreduction in invoice value may be allowed,  without any percentage ceiling,  subject to  the\nabove  conditions  as  also  subject  to their track record being satisfactory i.e. the export\noutstandings do not exceed 5% of the average annual export realisation during preceding\nthree calendar years. For the purpose of reckoning    the   percentage   of   outstanding\nexport   bills  to   average   export  realisations  during   the  preceding   three calendar  years,\noutstandings in respect of exports made to  countries  facing  externalisation  problems  may\nbe  ignored  provided the payments have been made by the  buyers  in  the  local  currency.\nC.13   Export Claims\nAuthorised dealers may remit export claims on application, provided the relative export\nproceeds have already been realised and repatriated to India and the exporter is not on the\ncaution list of Reserve Bank.  In all such cases of remittances, the exporter should be advised\nto surrender proportionate export incentive, if any, received by him.\nC.14Change of Buyer/Consignee\nPrior approval of Reserve Bank is not required if ,  after goods  have been shipped,\nthey are to be transferred to a buyer other than the original buyer in the  event  of  default  by\nthe latter,  provided the reduction in value,  if any,  involved does not exceed 10% and the\nrealisation  of  export proceeds  is  not delayed  beyond the  period  of  six  months  from  the\ndate of export.  Where  the reduction  in value  exceeds  10%, all other relevant  conditions\nstipulated  in  paragraph  C.12  should also be satisfied.\nC.15Extension of Time Limit\nIn cases where an exporter has not been able  to  realise proceeds  of a shipment made\nwithin the period prescribed ( i.e within six months from the date of export), for  reasons\nbeyond his control,  but expects to be able to realise proceeds if extension of the period is\nallowed to him, necessary application (in duplicate)   should be made to the concerned\nRegional Office of Reserve Bank in form ETX through his authorised dealer with appropriate\ndocumentary evidence.   Extension will not ordinarily be  granted unless Reserve Bank is\nsatisfied that the exporter is in no way directly or indirectly responsible  for  the  delay  in\nrealisation  of  proceeds  and that by grant of a short extension the exporter will be able to\nrealise proceeds.\nC.16Shipments Lost in Transit\nWhen  shipments  from  India  for  which payment has  not already been received\neither  by  negotiation  of  bills under letters of credit or otherwise are lost  in transit,\nauthorised dealer  must ensure that insurance claim is made as soon as the loss is known.\nThe duplicate copy of GR/SDF/PP form should be forwarded to Reserve Bank with following\nparticulars:\n(a) Amount  for which shipment was insured.\n(b) Name and address of insurance company\n(c) Place where claim is payable.In cases where claim is payable abroad, authorised dealer must  arrange to collect the full\namount of claim due on the lost shipment, through the medium of his overseas\nbranch/correspondent and forward the duplicate copy of GR/SDF/PP form to Reserve Bank\nonly after the amount has been  collected.    A  certificate  for  the amount  of claim  received\nshould be furnished on the reverse of the duplicate copy.\nNOTE  : Sometimes claims on shipments lost in  transit are also partially settled\ndirectly by shipping companies/airlines under carriers' liability.\nAuthorised dealers should ensure that amounts of such claims if settled\nabroad are also repatriated to India by exporters.\nC.17Payment of Claims by ECGC\nWhere export has been covered by a polic y issued by ECGC, settlement of a claim by\nthe Corporation does not absolve the exporter of the statutory obligation  undertaken on the\nGR/SDF/PP form to realise proceeds of the export within prescribed  period.   In such cases,\nexporter  should, in consultation with ECGC,  take all necessary steps  for  realising the\nproceeds.  Authorised dealers should also continue to hold the duplicate copies of\nGR/SDF/PP forms in their custody and initiate follow-up measures in the normal manner.\nC.18Write off of unrealised Export Bills\n(i)An exporter who has not been able to realise the outstanding export dues\ndespite best efforts,  may approach the authorised dealer, who had handled the relevant\nshipping documents, with appropriate supporting documentary  evidence  with a request for\nwrite off of the unrealised portion. Authorised dealers  may  accede  to  such  requests\nsubject to the under noted conditions:\n(a) The relevant amount has  remained  outstanding  for one year or more;\n(b) The  aggregate amount of write off allowed by the authorised dealer during  a\ncalendar year does not  exceed 10%  of the total export proceeds realised by\nthe concerned exporter through the concerned authorised dealer  during the\nprevious calendar year;\n(c) Satisfactory  documentary  evidence is furnished  in  support of the exporter\nhaving made all efforts  to realise  the  dues;\n(d) The case falls under  any  of  the  undernoted categories:\n(i) The overseas  buyer  has been declared insolvent and a certificate from\nthe official liquidator indicating that  there is no possibility of recovery\nof export proceeds produced.\n(ii) The overseas buyer is not  traceable  over a reasonably  long period of\ntime.\n(iii) The goods exported  have  been  auctioned or destroyed by the\nPort/Customs/Health authorities in the importing  country.\n(iv) The unrealised amount represents the  balance due in  a case settled\nthrough the intervention of the Indian  Embassy,  Foreign Chamber of\nCommerce or similar Organisation;\n(v) The unrealised amount represents the undrawn balance of an export\nbill (not  exceeding  10% of the invoice value) remained outstanding\nand  turned  out  to  be unrealisable despite all efforts made by the\nexporter;\n(vi) The cost of resorting to legal  action  would be  disproportionate to the\nunrealised amount  of the  export bill  or  where  the  exporter even\nafter winning the Court case against the overseas  buyer  could  not\nexecute the Court decree due to reasons beyond his control.;(vii) Bills were drawn for the  difference  between the letter of credit value\nand actual export value or  between  the  provisional  and  the actual\nfreight  charges but  the amount has remained unrealised consequent\non  dishonour of the bills by the  overseas  buyer  and there are no\nprospects of realisation.\n(e) The case is not the subject matter of any pending civil or criminal suit.\n(f) The exporter has not come to the adverse notice of the Enforcement Directorate or\nthe  Central  Bureau of  Investigation  or  any such  other  law enforcement\nagency.\n(g)  The exporter has surrendered  proportionate export incentives,  if  any,\n                        availed of in  respect  of the relative shipments.\n(ii) Where there is no further amount to be realised against  the GR/SDF/PP form\ncovered  by  the  write  off, authorised  dealer should submit the duplicate thereof to Reserve\nBank along with 'R' return, duly certified, as under:\n\u201c  Write off of  ...................................................\n                      (Amount in words and figures)\npermitted in terms of paragraph C.18 of Directions to Authorised Dealers.\nDate Stamp & Signature of\nAuthorised Dealer \u201c\nC.19Return of Documents to Exporters\nThe duplicate copies  of GR/SDF/PP forms  and  shipping documents, once submitted\nto authorised dealers for negotiation, collection, etc, should not ordinarily be returned to\nexporters, except for rectification of errors and resubmission.\nC.20Exporters' Caution List\nAuthorised dealers will  also  be  advised whenever  exporters  are  cautioned in terms\nof provisions contained in Regulation 17 of \u201cExport Regulations\u201d.  Authorised   dealers\nshould not accept for negotiation/collection  shipping  documents  covering exports  declared\non  GR/SDF/PP forms completed by such exporters nor countersign PP forms completed by\nthem  unless the  GR/SDF/PP  forms bear  approval  of  Reserve  Bank.\nPART D - Remittances connected with Export\nD.1Agency Commission on Exports\n(i) Authorised   dealers  may  allow  payment  of commission, either by remittance  or  by\ndeduction from invoice value, on application submitted by the exporter. The remittance  on\nagency commission may be allowed subject to the following conditions:\n(a) Amount  of  commission  has  been  declared  on GR/SDF/PP/SOFTEX form\nand  accepted  by  Customs  authorities  or Department  of  Electronics,\nGovernment  of India /EPZ authorities as the case may be.   In cases  where\nthe  commission  has  not  been  declared  on  GR/SDF/PP/SOFTEX form,remittance  thereof  may  be allowed after satisfying about the reasons\nadduced by  the  exporter  for  not declaring commission on Export\nDeclaration  Form, provided  a valid agreement/written understanding between\nthe exporter and /or beneficiary for payment of commission subsists.\n(b) The relative shipment has already been made.\n(ii)Authorised dealers may allow payment of commission by Indian exporters, in respect\nof their exports covered under counter trade arrangement through Escrow Accounts\ndesignated in U.S. dollar, subject to the following conditions ;-\n(a) The payment of commission satisfies the conditions as at (a) and (b) stipulated\nin paragraph above.\n(b) The commission is not payable to Escrow Account  holders themselves.\n(c) The commission should not be allowed by deduction from the invoice value.\n           NOTE : Payment of commission is prohibited on exports made by Indian\npartners towards equity participation in an overseas joint\nventure/wholly owned subsidiary as also exports under Rupee Credit\nRoute.\nD.2     Refund of Export Proceeds\nRefund of export proceeds may be allowed by authorised dealers through whom the proceeds\nwere originally received, provided such goods are re-imported into India on account of poor\nquality etc. and evidence of re-import has been submitted. In all such cases, exporters should\nbe advised to surrender the proportionate incentives availed of, if any, against the relevant\nexport.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/15786.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Sep 05, 2000", "info": "Foreign Exchange Management (Foreign Exch ange Derivative Contracts) (Amendment) \nRegulations, 2000 \n \nReserve Bank of India \nExchange Control Department \nCentral Office \nMumbai \u2013 400 001 \n \nNotification No.FEMA 28 /2000-RB. \ndated  September  5, 2000 \n \nForeign Exchange Management (Foreign Exch ange Derivative Contracts) (Amendment) \nRegulations, 2000 \n \n In exercise of the powers conferred by claus e (h) of sub-section (2 ) of section 47 of the \nForeign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) , and in partial modification of its \nnotification No.FEMA 25/2000-RB dated 3rd May, 2000, the Reserve B ank of India makes the \nfollowing Regulations to amend the Fo reign Exchange Management (Foreign exchange \nderivative contracts) R egulations 2000, namely:- \n \n2.

With a view to liberalising further ECB approvals, the Government have vide Press\nRelease F.No.4 (32)\u20132000 ECB dated September 1, 2000, decided to operationalise the\nautomatic route for fresh ECB approvals upto USD 50 million and all refinancing of existing\nECBs with immediate effect.\n3.  Accordingly ,  under the automatic route arrangement, any legal entity, registered under\nthe Companies Act, Societies Registration Act, Co-operative Societies Act, including\nproprietorship/partnership concerns, will henceforth be eligible to enter into loan agreements\nwith overseas lender(s) for raising fresh ECB with average maturity of not less than 3 years for\nan amount upto USD 50 million and for refinancing an existing ECB provided it is in compliance\nwith both the ECB guidelines framed by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, and the\nregulations/directions/circulars issued by Reserve Bank in this regard.  Corporates would not be\nrequired to obtain prior approval for raising ECB upto USD 50 million and for refinancing of an\nexisting ECB from the Ministry of Finance / Reserve Bank.\nThe corporate shall ensure that they raise ECB from an internationally accepta ble and/or\nrecognised lender, such as export credit agencies, suppliers of equipments, foreign collaborators,\nforeign equity holders, international capital markets, reputed international banks and financial\ninstitutions, etc.  Further, the loan should be organised through a reputed merchant banker\nregistered with the regulatory authorities of the host country, viz., USA, Japan, EU countries,\nSingapore and such other countries as may be notified from time to time by the Government of\nIndia.  The lenders should be recognised and registered in the host countries for the purpose of\nextending international finance.\n      The corporate shall submit through an authorised dealer of its choice, three copies of the\nloan agreement to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank after signing the same\nwith the lender.    The Regional Office  of  the  Reserve Bank2\nwould acknowledge receipt of the copies of the agreement and will allot a loan identification\nnumber to such an agreement.

It will, however, be required to file\nquarterly returns in a prescribed format through the authorised dealer.  The withholding tax\nexemption would continue to be granted by the Ministry of Finance (Department of\nRevenue/Department of Economic Affairs), Government of India.\n4.Authorised  dealers, as hitherto, shall be required to forward all applications to the Chief\nGeneral Manager, ECB Division, Exchange Control Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central\nOffice, Mumbai 400 001, to obtain prior permission for prepayment of outstanding ECBs (viz.,\n10 per cent of the outstanding amount once during the life of the loan or ECBs with residual\nmaturity upto one year).\n5.Opening of foreign currency account for parking ECB proceeds temporarily, pending\nutilisation, will require prior approval of the concerned Regional Office of  Reserve Bank.\n6.

Import licences cannot be used to the full amount in cover of\nf.o.b. cost of the goods leaving insurance and freight to local agent of thesupplier, as additional charges to be paid in rupees over the amount specified\nin the import licence.\n(ii) Importers sometime enter into contracts on f.o.b. terms and agree to the\nsuppliers paying for the freight to be reimbursed to them along with the cost of\nthe goods. Authorised dealers in such cases should, before making the\nremittance of freight charges, ascertain the actual freight amount paid with\nreference to the original freight bill or memo issued by the shipping company or\nthe amount stated on the relative bill of lading.\nA.10Surrender of Import Licences\nExchange Control copy of the import licence submitted by importer for opening of L/C or\nmaking remittance when fully utilised, should be retained by authorised dealers and may be\npreserved till scrutiny by the internal audit or inspection is completed.\nA.11 Advance Remittance\nAuthorised dealers may allow advance remittance for import of goods without any ceiling\nsubject to the following conditions :\n(a) the importer should hold the EC copy of a valid import licence if  the goods to\nbe imported are those included in the negative list of imports in the Export and\nImport Policy in force;\n(b) remittance is made direct to the suppliers;\n(c) if the amount of advance remittance exceeds U.S.$25,000 or its equivalent, a\nguarantee from an international bank of repute situated outside India or a\nguarantee of an authorised dealer in India, if such  a guarantee is issued against\nthe counter-guarantee of an international bank of repute situated outside India,\nshould be obtained. An unconditional standby L/C from an international bank\nof repute situated outside India may also be accepted in lieu of bank guarantee\nprovided it is irrevocable, non-transferable and lists out full particulars  of the\ntransactions and there is a clear provision for prompt   payment   being\nreceived   in  convertible  currency  in  an approved manner. The validity of the\nguarantee /letter of credit should adequately cover the period for the  purpose of\nenforcing payment;\n(d) physical import of goods into India should be made within three months (twelve\nmonths in case of  capital goods)  from  the date of remittance and the importer\nshould give an undertaking to furnish  documentary evidence of import within\nfifteen days from the close of the relevant period. Authorised dealers, if\nsatisfied  with the request, may allow extension of time for import not\nexceeding one month (three months in case of capital goods). In cases where the\nadvance remittance has been made against a bank guarantee, the guaranteeshould be suitably amended, if need be, to cover the extended period for import\nof  goods into India; and\n(e) authorised dealer should ensure that in the event of non-import of      goods, the\namount of advance remittance is repatriated to India or is utilised for any other\npurposes for which release of exchange is permissible under the Act, Rules or\nRegulations made thereunder, to the satisfaction of the authorised dealer.\nA.12 Time Limit for Settlement of Import Payments\n(i)In terms of the extant Rules , remittances against imports should be completed not later\nthan six months from the date of shipment. Accordingly, deferred payment arrangements\ninvolving payments beyond a period of six months from the date of shipment are treated as\nexternal commercial borrowings which require prior approval of the Reserve\nBank/Government of India { cf: Regulation 5 (3) of Reserve Bank Notification No. FEMA\n3/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000}. There would, however, be no objection to importers\nwithholding amounts not exceeding 15 per cent of the cost of goods towards guarantee of\nperformance, etc. Authorised dealers may make remittances of amounts so withheld, provided\nthe earlier remittance had been made through them. No payment of interest is permissible on\nsuch withheld amounts.\n(ii)Sometimes, settlement of import dues may be delayed due to disputes, financial\ndifficulties, etc. Authorised dealers may make remittances in such cases even if the period of\nsix months has expired, provided -\n(a) authorised dealer is satisfied about the genuineness of the circumstances leading\nto the delay in payment; and\n(b) no payment of interest is involved for the additional period. However, in cases\nwhere the overseas supplier insists on payment of interest, it may be allowed in\naccordance with the provisions contained in paragraph A.13, upto a maximum\nperiod of 60 days beyond 180 days from the date of shipment provided the\nimport bill is paid within that period.\nNOTES :A.     In case of import bills negotiated under letter of credit and      retired by\nimporter after expiry of six months from the date of shipment of relative goods,\nsettlement of the payment would be deemed to be completed within six months from the\ndate of shipment if reimbursement was made  to the overseas bank within that period,\nB.  Remittances against import of books may be allowed without restriction as to time\nlimit, provided no interest payment is involved nor has the importer forgone any part of\nthe discount/ rebate normally allowed to importers towards compensation for delay in\nsettlement of dues.A.13   Interest on Import Bills\n(i)    Authorised   dealers may make remittances on account of interest accrued on usance bills\nunder 'normal interest clause' or of overdue interest payable on sight bills for a period not\nexceeding six months from the date of shipment in respect of imports without prior approval\nof Reserve Bank.\nNOTE : Interest under 'normal interest clause' would mean interest at the 'prime' rate (or\nits equivalent) of the country in the currency of which the goods are invoiced or LIBOR for\nthe currency.\n (ii)    In case of pre-payment of usance import bills, remittances may be made only after\nreducing the proportionate interest for the un-expired portion of usance at the rate, according\nto the contract, at which the interest has been claimed  for the usance period or the prime rate\nor LIBOR of the currency in which the goods have been invoiced , whichever is applicable.\nWhere interest is not separately claimed, remittances may be allowed after deducting the\nproportionate interest for the un-expired portion of usance at the prevailing 'prime' rate/\nLIBOR of the currency of invoice.\nA.14 War Risk Insurance/Bunker/Congestion Surcharge\n/Premium for Extended Insurance\nAuthorised dealers may make remittances towards war risk insurance premium,\nbunker/ congestion  surcharge at foreign ports, premia for extended insurance cover, etc., which\nare incidental to imports.\nA.15  Imports under Penalty\nAuthorised  dealers may make remittances against goods imported without authority, but later\nallowed to be cleared by the Customs Authorities against payment of penalty, to the extent of\nc.i.f. value of the goods indicated on the relative Exchange Control copy of the Customs Bill of\nEntry evidencing imports of goods to India.\nA.16     Remittances against Replacement Imports\n(i)  In case import of an item does not require licence under the Export -Import Policy in force\nand there is a need for remittance of foreign exchange for import of replacement goods for a\ndefective item imported earlier, the remittance should be made after ensuring that there is no\ndouble payment for the same import.\n(ii)  Where goods are short-supplied, damaged, short-landed or lost in transit, the procedure\nlaid down below should be followed for payment against replacement goods:\n(a) In cases where no letter of credit has been opened or remittances made,\nExchange Control copy of the import licence may be  automatically treated as\nvalid for the replacement consignment,  provided it is shipped within the\nvalidity period of the licence.(b) If the Exchange Control copy has already been utilised to cover the opening of a\nletter of credit against the original goods which have been lost, the original\nendorsement to the extent of the value of the lost goods may be cancelled by\nauthorised  dealers without reference to the Reserve Bank, provided the\ninsurance claim relating to the lost goods has been settled in favour of the\nimporter by remittance from abroad through an authorised  dealer, if insurance\nwas covered abroad and by local payment in rupees if insurance was covered in\nIndia. Payment for the replacement goods may then be made against suitable\nendorsement on the import licence subject to the conditions that the replacement\nconsignment is shipped within the validity period of the licence.\n(c) If replacement goods are to be shipped after the expiry of import licence, the\nimporter should be asked to apply to DGFT for replacement or for revalidation\nof the expired licence.\nA.16      A Guarantee for Replacement Import\nIn case  replacement goods for a defective import are being sent by the overseas supplier\nbefore the defective goods imported earlier are dispatched out of India, authorised dealers\nmay issue guarantees at the request of importer clients for the despatch/return of defective\ngoods, according to their commercial judgement.\nA.17   Evidence of Import\n(i) Obligations of purchaser of foreign exchange as contained in sub-section (6) of Section 10 of\nForeign Exchange Management Act ,1999 are indicated in paragraph A.3 ibid.\n(ii)    In case of all imports, except import through couriers, where value of foreign exchange\nremitted/paid for import into India exceeds US $ 5000 or its equivalent , it is obligatory on the\npart of authorised dealers through whom the relative remittance was made to ensure that the\nimporter submits\n(a) the Exchange Control copy of the Bill of Entry for home consumption, or\n(b) in case of 100% Export Oriented Units the exchange control copy of the Bill of\nEntry for warehousing, or\n(c) Customs Assessment Certificate or Postal Appraisal Form as declared  by the\nimporter to the custom authorities, where import has been made by post , as an\nevidence that the goods for which the payment was made have actually been\nimported into India.\n(iii)  where imports are made in  non-physical form, i.e., software or data through internet/\ndatacom channels and drawings and designs through e-mail/fax a certificate from a chartered\naccountant that the software/data/ drawing/design has been received by the importer may be\nobtained.Note: Authorised dealers should advise importers to keep Custom authorities informed of the\nimports made by them under this  clause.\n(iv)    In respect of remittances for imports through courier services, authorised dealers should\nensure submission of the Exchange Control copy of the Bill of Entry in case of imports valued at\nRupees one lakh or more.  Where the value of import is less than Rs. one lakh, authorised  dealers\nmay obtain from the importer, a copy of the Bill of Entry, in the prescribed form issued by the\nCustoms in the name of registered courier, duly certified by the courier company indicating\nthereon the particulars of the consignment for which the copy has been issued.\n(v)  Authorised dealers should ensure that in all cases, including cases of advance remittance\npermitted in terms of paragraph A.11 above, evidence of import is submitted by their importer\ncustomer and is duly verified.  In respect of imports on D/A. basis, since goods would normally\nbe cleared before the due date of payment, authorised dealers should insist on production of\nevidence of import at the time of effecting remittance of import bill.  Authorised dealers should\nadvise this requirement to their importer customer  while delivering the documents against\nacceptance.\nNOTE: A.In respect of imports on D/A basis if importers fail to produce documentary evidence\ndue to genuine reasons such as non-arrival of consignment, delay in delivery/customs\nclearance of consignment, etc., authorised dealers may, if satisfied with the genuineness of\nrequest,  allow reasonable time not exceeding three months from the date of remittance to the\nimporter to submit the evidence of import.\n(vi)      Authorised dealers should in all cases acknowledge receipt of evidence of import e.g.\nExchange Control copy of the Bill of Entry, Postal Appraisal Form or Customs Assessment\nCertificate, etc., from importers by issuing acknowledgement slips containing the following\nparticulars:\n(a) importer's full name and address with code number ;\n(b) import licence number and date (wherever applicable);\n(c) bank's reference of letter of credit number ,etc., if any;\n(d) number and date of Exchange Control copy of the Bill of  Entry/     Postal\nAppraisal Form or Customs Assessment Certificate and the amount of import ;and\n(e) particulars of goods imported.\n(vii)    Internal inspectors or auditors (including external auditors appointed by authorised\ndealers) should carry out 100 per cent verification of the documents evidencing import, e.g.\nExchange Control copies of Bills of Entry or Postal Appraisal Form or Customs Assessment\nCertificate, etc.\n(viii)   Documents evidencing import into India received in terms of paragraph A.17 above\nshould be preserved by authorised dealers for a period of one year from the date of its\nverification as required under sub-paragraph (vii) above. However, in respect of cases which\nare under investigation by investigating agencies, the documents should be destroyed only\nafter obtaining clearance from the investigating agency concerned.A.18   Follow up by Authorised Dealers\n(i)     In case an importer does not furnish the document of evidence of import, as required under\nparagraph A.17, within 3 months from the date of remittance involving foreign exchange\nexceeding US$5,000, the authorised dealer should rigorously follow-up for the next 3 months ,\nincluding issue of registered letters to the importer ,for submission of an appropriate document as\nevidence of import.\n(ii)     Authorised dealers should forward to the Reserve Bank a statement on   half yearly basis\nas at the end of June & December of every year, in form BEF  (format enclosed) furnishing\ndetails of import transactions, exceeding US$5,000 in respect of which importers have defaulted\nin submission of an appropriate document evidencing import within 6 months from the date of\nremittance.  The said half yearly statement should be submitted to the Regional Office of the\nReserve Bank under whose jurisdiction the authorised dealer is functioning, within 15 days from\nthe end of half year to which the statement relates.\n Note: A. In cases where at the time of advance remittance purpose of remittance  was\nindicated as import and subsequently the exchange has been used for a\npurpose for which sale of exchange is permissible, and a document to the\nsatisfaction of authorised dealer has been produced, such cases should not\nbe treated as  default and hence be excluded from the BEF statement .\nB. Authorised dealers may accept Into Bond Bill of Entry as a provisional\nevidence of import into India. However, they may ensure submission of\nExchange Control copy of the Bill of Entry for Home consumption within a\nreasonable period of time. Wherever Into Bond Bill of Entry has been\nsubmitted such cases need not be reported in BEF statement.\nA.19  Precautions for Handling Import Documents\nAuthorised dealers should exercise due care while handling import documents on collection\nbasis on behalf of importer customers with reference to their line of business, financial\nstanding, frequency of  import,  etc.  to  establish\nthe genuineness of the import. In the case of bills involving large values, authorised dealers\nshould satisfy themselves that the importer is known to be trading in items mentioned in the\nshipping documents or that the items are required for his actual use. In case of importers who\nare not their constituents, authorised dealers should, at the time of acceptance of the\ndocuments/making payment, call for detailed Certificate-cum-Report from their bankers in\nsupport of the genuineness of imports.\nA.20     Receipt of import Bills/Documents\n(i)  Import bills and documents should be received from the banker of the seller by the banker\nof the buyer in India.

Public limited, public limited\nand private limited companies.\n(ii)In all other cases, at the request of importer clients, authorised dealers may receive bills\ndirect from the overseas seller up to U.S.$ 25,000 (U.S. Dollars Twenty five thousand only),\nprovided the authorised dealer is fully satisfied about the financial standing/status and track\nrecord of the importer customer. Before extending the facility, authorised dealer should obtain\nreport on each individual overseas seller from the overseas banker or reputed credit agency.\nA.21   Postal Imports\nRemittances   against   bills  received for collection in respect of imports by post parcel may be\nmade by authorised dealers, provided the goods imported are such as are normally despatched\nby post parcel.

Any scheduled commercial bank would be permitted to undertake insurance business as agent\nof insurance companies on fee basis, without any risk participation.  The subsidiaries of banks will\nalso be allowed to undertake distribution of insurance product on agency basis.\n2.  Banks which satisfy the eligibility criteria given below will be permitted to set up a joint\nventure company for undertaking insurance business with risk participation, subject to safeguards.\nThe maximum equity contribution such a bank can hold in the joint venture company will\nnormally be 50 per cent of the paid-up capital of the insurance company.  On a selective basis the\nReserve Bank of India may permit a higher equity contribution by a promoter bank initially,\npending divestment of equity within the prescribed period (see Note 1 below).\nThe eligibility criteria for joint venture participant will be as under as on March 31, 2000:\n(i) The net worth of the bank should not be less than Rs.500 crore;\n(ii) The CRAR of the bank should not be less than 10 per cent;\n(iii) The level of non-performing assets should be reasonable;\n(iv) The bank should have net profit for the last three continuous years;\n(v) The track record of the performance of the subsidiaries, if any, of the concerned\nbank should be satisfactory.\n3.   In cases where a foreign partner contributes 26 per cent of the equity with the approval of\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority/Foreign Investment Promotion Board, more\nthan one public sector bank or private sector bank may be allowed to participate in the equity of\nthe insurance joint venture.  As such participants will also assume insurance risk, only those banks\nwhich satisfy the criteria given in paragraph 2 above, would be eligible.\n4.    A subsidiary of a bank or of another bank will not normally be allowed to join the insurance\ncompany on risk participation basis.  Subsidiaries would include bank subsidiaries undertaking\nmerchant banking, securities, mutual fund, leasing finance, housing finance business, etc.\n5.     Banks which are not eligible as joint venture participant, as above, can make investments up\nto 10% of the networth of the bank or Rs.50 crore, whichever is lower, in the insurance company\nfor providing infrastructure and services support.  Such participation shall be treated as an\ninvestment and should be without any contingent liability for the bank.\nThe eligibility criteria for these banks will be as under:\n(i) The CRAR of the bank should not be less than 10%;\n(ii) The level of NPAs should be reasonable;\n(iii) The bank should have net profit for the last three continuous years.\n6.   All banks entering into insurance business will be required to obtain prior approval of the\nReserve Bank. The Reserve Bank will give permission to banks on case to case basis keeping in\nview all relevant factors including the position in regard to the level of non-performing assets of\nthe applicant bank so as to ensure that non-performing assets do not pose any future threat to the\nbank in its present or the proposed line of activity, viz., insurance business. It should be ensured\nthat risks involved in insurance business do not get transferred to the bank and that the banking\nbusiness does not get contaminated by any risks which may arise from insurance business.

It has been decided that,\nfor the current financial year i.e. April 2000 to March 2001, each bank should compute\nits share of the housing finance allocation at 3 percent of its incremental deposits as on\nthe last reporting Friday of March 2000 over the corresponding figure of the  last\nreporting Friday of March 1999.  However, this is the minimum housing finance\nallocation and there is no objection to banks exceeding this level, having regard to their\nresources position.\n2.

Bank   credit  eligible   for   being\ntreated as housing finance under\nhousing  finance  allocations\n(a) Finance provided for construction of residential houses to be constructed\nby public housing agencies like HUDCO, Housing Boards, local bodies,\nindividuals, co-operative societies, employers etc. priority being accorded\nfor financing construction of housing meant for economically weaker\nsections, low income group and middle income group.  However, housing\nfinance of the following nature shall not form part of housing finance\nallocation :\n(i) housing finance granted by banks to their own employees;\n(ii) housing finance granted to Non Resident Indians ( NRIs) direct or\nthrough Housing Finance Institutions ( HFCs);\n(iii) direct housing loans in excess of Rs.5 lakhs and Rs.10 lakhs\nprovided in semi-urban/rural areas and Urban/Metropolitan\ncentres respectively; and\n(iv) housing loans taken over from other lending institutions.\n(b) Finance for construction of educational, health, social, cultural or other\ninstitutions/ centres, which are part of a housing project and which are\nnecessary for the development of settlements or townships;\n(c) Finance for shopping complexes, markets and such other centres catering\nto the day to day needs of the residents of the housing colonies and\nforming part of a housing project;\n(d) Finance for construction meant for improving the conditions in slum\nareas for which credit may be extended directly to the slum-dwellers on\nthe guarantee of the Government or indirectly to them through the State\nGovernments;\n(e) Bank finance for purchase of plot alone may be treated as part of housing\nfinance provided the bank obtains a declaration from the borrower that he\nintends to construct a home on the said plot, whether with the help of\nbank finance or otherwise, within a period of two years from the\navailment  of said finance.  Since the compliance with the declaration\nrests with the borrower, the banks may if they so desire, incorporate\nsuitable covenants in the loan documents at the time of sanction to enable\nthem to recall the loan or charge higher rate of interest in the event of\nnon-compliance by the borower  with his declaration.\n(f) Finance provided to ( i) the bodies constituted for undertaking repairs and\n(ii) the owners of building/house/flat, whether occupied by themselves or\nby tenants, to meet the need based requirements for their\nrepairs/additions, after satisfying themselves regarding the estimated cost\n(for which requisite certificate should be obtained from an\nEngineer/Architect, wherever necessary) and obtaining such security as\ndeemed appropriate.(g) Housing finance provided by banks for which refinance is availed of\nfrom National Housing Bank (NHB).\n(h) Bank credit given for slum improvement schemes to be implemented by\nSlum Clearance Boards and other public agencies.\n(i) Investment in the guaranteed/non-guaranteed bonds and debentures of\nNHB/HUDCO in primary market  provided investment in non-guaranteed\nbonds is made only if guaranteed bonds are not available.\n2. Terms and conditions for\nsanction of Housing Finance\n(a) Security, margin, repayment schedule\nIn respect of direct lending for housing to borrowers, banks are free to\nevolve their own guidelines on aspects such as margin, security,\nrepayment schedule, etc. with the approval of their respective Board of\nDirectors.\n(b) Rate of interest\nThe rate interest on direct/indirect housing finance will be in conformity\nwith RBI\u2019s directive in force.  The directive presently in force is DBOD\nNo.Dir.BC.106/13.03.00/99- dated 29th October 1999.\n(c) Indirect housing finance\n(i) General\nBanks should ensure that their indirect housing finance is\nchannelled by way of term loans to housing finance institutions,\nhousing boards, other public housing agencies, etc. primarily for\naugmenting the supply of serviced land and constructed units.  It\nshould also be ensured that the supply of plots/houses is time\nbound and public agencies do not utilise the bank loans merely for\nacquisition of land.  Similarly, serviced plots should be sold by\nthese agencies to co-operative societies, professional developers\nand individuals with stipulation that the houses should be\nconstructed thereon within a reasonable time, not exceeding 3\nyears.  For this purpose, banks may take advantage of various\nguidelines issued by NHB for augmenting the supply of serviced\nland and constructed units.\n(ii)Lending to Housing Finance Institutions\nIn terms of NHB guidelines, housing finance companies\ntotal borrowings whether by way of deposits, issue of\ndebentures/bonds and advances from banks or from financial\ninstitutions but excluding any loan obtained from NHB should not\nexceed  10 to 15 times of their Net Owned Funds (i.e. paid-up\ncapital and free reserves less deferred  revenue expenditure and\nintangible assets).  Considering the above ceiling on total\nborrowings of housing finance companies prescribed by NHB ,\nthe stipulation restricting the quantum of term loans to be\nextended  to  housing  finance  companies  by  banks  to 3 times\nof  NOF of  housing  finance  companies  have  been  withdrawnin respect of housing finance companies which are eligible to\ndraw refinance from NHB .  However, in respect of other housing\nfinance companies, the stipulation will continue to exist.\n(iii)Lending to Housing Boards and other agencies\nBanks may extend term loans to state level Housing\nBoards and other public agencies.  However, in order to develop a\nhealthy housing finance system, while doing so, banks must not\nonly keep in view the past performance of these agencies in the\nmatter of recovery from the beneficiaries but they should also\nstipulate that the Boards will ensure prompt and regular recovery\nof loan instalments  from the beneficiaries.\n(iv)Financing of land acquisition\nIn view of the need to increase the availability of land\nand house sites for increasing the housing stock in the country,\nbanks may extend finance to public agencies for acquisition and\ndevelopment of land provided it is a part of the complete project,\nincluding development of infrastructure such as water systems,\ndrainage, roads, provision of electricity, etc.  Such credit may be\nextended by way of term loans.  The project should be completed\nas early as possible and, in any case, within 3 years, so as to\nensure quick re-cycling of bank funds for optimum results.  If the\nproject covers construction of houses, credit extended therefor in\nrespect of individual beneficiaries should be on the same terms\nand conditions as stipulated for direct finance.\n(v) Term loans to private builders\nIn view of the important role which professional builders\nas providers of construction services have to play in the housing\nfield, especially where land is acquired and developed by State\nHousing Board and other public agencies, commercial banks may\nextend credit to private builders on commercial terms by way of\nloans linked to each specific project.  The period of credit for\nloans extended by banks to private builders may be decided by\nbanks themselves based on their commercial judgement subject to\nusual safeguards and after obtaining such security as banks may\ndeem appropriate.   Such  credit may be extended to builders of\nrepute and employing professionally qualified personnel.  It\nshould be ensured, through close monitoring, that no part of such\nfunds is used for any speculation in land.  Care should also be\ntaken to see that prices charged from the ultimate beneficiaries do\nnot include any speculative element, that is, prices should be\nbased only on the documented price of land, the actual cost of\nconstruction and a reasonable profit margin.\n3.Refinance from RBI\nFinance provided by banks would not be eligible for refinance from RBI.\n4.Certain clarifications about Direct Housing Finance(a) Bank finance extended to a person who is already owning a house in the\ntown/village where he resides, for buying/constructing a second house in\nthe same or other town/village for the purpose of self occupation, may be\nconsidered as direct housing finance.\n(b) Bank finance extended for purchase of house by a borrower who\nproposes to let it out on rental basis on account of his posting outside the\nheadquarter or because he has been provided accommodation by his\nemployer, may be treated as direct housing finance.\n(c) Finance extended by banks to borrowers for purchase of old house,\nirrespective of the age of the dwelling unit in accordance with their\nlending policy may be classified as direct housing finance.\n5.Housing Finance to Non-Resident Indians ( NRIs)\nAuthorised Dealers in Foreign Exchange have been granted permission to grant\nloans to NRIs holding Indian passports for acquisition of a house/flat for residential\npurposes subject to certain terms and conditions.  The housing loans granted to NRIs\nshould be treated outside the purview of annual housing finance allocation.  Further, it\nshould not be included in the quarterly housing finance statements required to be\nforwarded to us.\n6.Term loans to Housing Finance Intermediaries\nBanks have been permitted to grant term loans to housing intermediary agencies\nagainst the direct loans sanctioned/proposed to be sanctioned (including those to Non-\nResident Indians) by the latter irrespective of the per borrower size of the loan extended\nby these agencies.  Further, housing finance sanctioned by commercial banks to housing\nfinance intermediary agencies would henceforth be reckoned for the purpose of\nachievement of their housing finance allocation irrespective of the per borrower size of\nthe loan extended by these agencies.  However, term loans extended by commercial\nbanks to housing intermediary agencies against the latter\u2019s on-lending to Non-Resident\nIndians will not be treated as housing finance for the purpose of the scheme of yearly\nhousing finance allocation applicable to banks.\nAs regards rate of interest on term loans extended by commercial banks to\nhousing finance intermediary agencies for on-lending to Indian residents, banks are free\nto charge interest rates without reference to their own Prime Lending Rate.\n7.Term loans for housing projects\ninvolving budgetary support\nIn respect of housing projects undertaken by both public sector and private sector\nundertakings, banks are free to sanction term loans for financially viable and bankable\nprojects provided they have income generation capacity sufficient to repay the loan\ntogether with interest.  Further in respect of projects undertaken by public sector units,\nterm loans may be sanctioned only for corporate entities (i.e. public sector entities\nregistered under Companies Act or a Corporation established under the relevant statute).\nSuch term loans should not be in lieu of or to substitute budgetary resources envisaged\nfor the project.  The term loan could supplement budgetary resources if such\nsupplementing was contemplated in the project design.\n8. Quarterly statementsFor the purpose of monitoring the macro level performance of the commercial\nbanks in disbursement of housing finance vis-\u00e0-vis their housing finance allocation\nbanks are advised to submit on quarterly basis details of disbursements made by them\ntowards housing finance as per the format (specimen enclosed) within 20 days from the\nclose of the respective quarter.\n9.Housing Loans under Priority Sector\nHousing finance limits considered as Priority Sector Advances are as under :\n(a)Direct Finance\n(i) Loans upto Rs.5 lakhs for construction of houses by individuals in\nrural and semi-urban areas.\n(ii) Loans upto Rs.10 lakhs for construction of houses by individuals\nin urban and metropolitan areas.\n(iii) Loans upto Rs.50 ,000/- for repairs to damaged houses by\nindividuals.\n(b) Indirect Finance\n(i) Assistance given to any governmental agency for construction of\nhouses for slum clearance and rehabilitation of slum dwellers\nsubject to a ceiling of Rs.5 lakhs of loan amount per housing unit.\n(ii) Assistance given to a non-governmental agency, approved by the\nNational Housing Bank, for the purpose of refinance for\nconstruction of houses or for slum clearance and rehabilitation of\nslum dwellers subject to ceiling of loan component of Rs.5 lakhs\nper housing unit.\n(iii) All the investments in bonds issued by NHB and HUDCO\nexclusively for financing of housing irrespective of the loan size\nper dwelling unit.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/14961.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Aug 02, 2000", "info": "Guidelines for recovery of dues relating to\nNon-Performing  Assets ( NPAs)  of  public\nsector banks\nBP.BC. 11/21.01.040/99-00\nJuly   27,   2000\nShravana  5, 1922\nChairmen and Managing Directors\nof all Public Sector Banks\nDear Sir,\nGuidelines for recovery of dues relating to\nNon-Performing  Assets ( NPAs)  of  public\nsector banks\nPlease refer to our  circular DBOD.BP.BC.57/21.01.040/99  dated  May 27, 1999,  setting\nout the guidelines for constitution of  Settlement Advisory Committees ( SACs) for\ncompromise  settlements of  chronic  NPAs  of  small sector.\n2.  A review  of  compromise settlements of  NPAs  through Settlement  Advisory\nCommittees ( SACs) made by us has revealed that the progress of  recovery of  NPAs\nthrough this mechanism has not been encouraging. The  recovery  position in respect of\ncategories of  borrowers other than small sector has also not been satisfactory. Banks have\nrepresented to us that on account of the relative inflexibility of the  parameters given in the\naforesaid guidelines, much progress could not be made in the recovery of NPAs. While\nbanks should  take  effective  measures  to strengthen the  credit  appraisal  and post-credit\nmonitoring  to  arrest  the incidence of fresh  NPAs,  a  more  realistic  approach  is  needed\nto reduce  the stock  of  existing  and chronic  NPAs in all categories. It  has  therefore, been\ndecided to modify  the guidelines,  which  will provide a simplified, non-discretionary  and\nnon-discriminatory  mechanism for  recovery  of the stock of  NPAs.  All public sector\nbanks should uniformly implement these  guidelines, so that maximum realisation of  dues is\nachieved  from  the  stock of  NPAs  within  the  stipulated  time.\n3.  The revised guidelines will cover  NPAs  relating to all sectors including the  small\nsector.  The  guidelines will not, however, cover cases of   wilful  default,  fraud  and2\nmalfeasance.   The banks should identify cases of wilful default, fraud and  malfeasance  and\ninitiate prompt action  against  them.    Accordingly,  in modification of guidelines  set out in\nour Circular of 27th May, 1999, revised guidelines for recovery of dues relating to NPAs of\npublic  sector  banks  in  all  sectors  are  given  below :\n(A) Guidelines  for  recovery  of  NPAs\n      upto  Rs. 5.00 crore\n[ i ]Coverage\na) The revised guidelines will cover  all  NPAs in all sectors irrespective of the nature\nof business, which  have become  doubtful or  loss  as on 31st March, 1997 with\noutstanding  balance of  Rs. 5.00 crore and below on  the cut off date.\nb) The guidelines will also cover NPAs classified as  sub- standard  as on 31st March,\n1997,  which have subsequently become doubtful  or  loss category.\nc) These  guidelines will also cover cases pending before Courts / DRTs / BIFR, subject\nto consent decree being obtained from the Courts/ DRTs/BIFR.\nd) Cases of wilful default, fraud and malfeasance will not be covered.\ne) The revised guidelines will remain operative only upto 31st March, 2001.\n[ ii ] Settlement Formula \u2013 Amount and off date\na ) NPAs classified as Doubtful or Loss\n     as on  31st March, 1997.\nThe minimum amount that should be recovered under the revised guidelines in respect of\ncompromise settlement of NPAs classified as doubtful or loss  as on 31st March, 1997 would\nbe 100% of  the  outstanding balance in the account as on the date of  transfer to the\nprotested  bills account or the amount outstanding as on the date  on which  the  account was\ncategorised as doubtful NPAs, whichever happened  earlier,  as  the case  may  be.\nb ) NPAs classified as Sub-standard as on 31st  March, 1997\n     which  became  doubtful  or  loss  subsequently\nThe minimum amount that should be recovered  in respect of NPAs classified as Sub-\nstandard  as on 31st March, 1997 which became doubtful or loss   subsequently  would  be\n100% of  the outstanding  balance  in  the account  as on the date of transfer to the protested\nbills account or the amount  as on the date on which the account  was  categorised  as3\ndoubtful  NPAs, whichever happened earlier, as the case may be,  plus interest at existing\nPrime Lending Rate  from  1st April, 1997 till the date of final  payment.\n[ iii ] Payment\nThe amount of settlement arrived at  in both the above cases, should  preferably be paid in\none lump sum. In  cases where the borrowers are unable to pay the  entire  amount  in one\nlump sum, at least  25% of the amount of  settlement  should  be paid upfront  and  the\nbalance amount of 75% should be recovered in instalments within a period of one year\ntogether  with  interest  at the  existing  Prime Lending Rate from the date of  settlement\nupto  the  date of  final  payment.\n[ iv ]  Sanctioning Authority\nThe  decision  on  the  compromise  settlement and consequent  sanction  of waiver or\nremission or write-off should be taken by the competent authority  under  the  delegated\npowers.\n[ v ]  Non-discretionary  Treatment\nThe banks  should  follow  the above guidelines  for  compromise settlement  of all  NPAs\ncovered  under the revised  scheme, without  discrimination and  a  monthly  report  on the\nprogress and details of settlements  should be submitted  by the concerned  authority to the\nnext higher authority and their Central Office. Banks should give  notice by 31st  August,\n2000 to the eligible defaulting  borrowers to avail of  the opportunity for one time settlement\nof their outstanding  dues in terms of  these guidelines. Adequate  publicity  through  various\nmeans  to  these  guidelines  must  be  ensured.\n[ vi ]  Reporting to the Board\nThe banks  should submit a report on the progress  in  the recovery of NPAs under the\nrevised guidelines every quarter to the Board of Directors.  A  copy of  the quarterly\nprogress  report  should  also be sent to us.\n(B) Guidelines for Recovery  of  NPAs\n     over Rs.  5.00 crore\n[ i ]  CMDs  should  personally  supervise  the NPAs of  Rs. 5.00  crore and  above on case\nto  case  basis.

The  matter  should  be\nplaced  before  the  Board  of  Directors,  finalising  the  course  of  action  by  30th\nSeptember, 2000  in each  such  case.\n( ii )   The  Board  of  Directors  may  evolve  policy  guidelines  regarding one  time\nsettlement  of NPAs over  Rs.5.00 crore covering the  computation   formula, realisable\namount,  cut off  date  and  payment  conditions  with  reference  to  factors  of  security  and\ndisposability, etc.  as  part of  its loan recovery policy including setting up of Settlement\nAdvisory  Committee,  staff  accountability  and  other  relevant  aspects  and  decide\nindividual  cases  in  accordance  with  such  policy. A copy  of  such  policy  should  also\nbe  sent  to us.\n[ iii ] Wherever  a  suit is  required  to  be  filed  against  the defaulters,  who have not come\nup  for  one  time  settlement,  or  where restructuring  is  not  feasible,  suits  must  be filed\nin  all  such  cases  by  31st  October,  2000.

CP was introduced in India in 1990 with a view to enabling highly rated\ncorporate borrowers to diversify their sources of short-term borrowings and to provide an\nadditional instrument to investors. Guidelines for issue of CP are presently governed by\nvarious directives issued by Reserve Bank of India, as amended from time to time. In\npursuance of the Statement on Monetary and Credit Policy for the Year 2000 - 2001, to keep\npace with several developments in the financial markets, it has been decided to modify the\nguidelines in the light of recommendations made by an Internal Group. Accordingly, the\nfollowing guidelines are issued, replacing all earlier directions/guidelines on the subject :\nWho can issue Commercial Paper (CP)\n2.Highly rated corporate borrowers, primary dealers ( PDs) and satellite dealers ( SDs)\nand all-India financial institutions (FIs) which have been permitted to raise resources through\nmoney market instruments under the umbrella limit fixed by Reserve Bank of India are\neligible to issue CP.\n3.A company shall be eligible to issue CP provided - (a) the tangible net worth  of the\ncompany, as per the latest audited balance sheet, is not less than Rs. 4 crore; (b) the working\ncapital (fund-based) limit of the company from the banking system is not less than Rs.4 crore\nand (c) the borrowal  account of the company is classified as a Standard Asset by the\nfinancing bank/s.\nRating Requirement\n4.All eligible participants should obtain the credit rating for issuance of Commercial\nPaper, from either the Credit Rating Information Services of India Ltd. (CRISIL) or the\nInvestment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Ltd. (ICRA) or the Credit\nAnalysis and Research Ltd. (CARE) or the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating India Pvt. Ltd. (DCR\nIndia) or such other credit rating agency as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of India\nfrom time to time, for the purpose. The minimum credit rating shall be P-2 of CRISIL or such\nequivalent rating by other agencies. Further, the participants shall ensure at the time of\nissuance of CP that the rating so obtained is current and has not fallen due for review.\nMaturity\n5.CP can be issued for maturities between a minimum of 15 days and a maximum upto\none year from the date of issue. If the maturity date is a holiday, the company would be liable\nto make payment on the immediate preceding working day.\nDenominations\n6.CP can be issued in denominations of Rs.5 lakh or multiples thereof.\nLimits and the Amount of Issue of CP2\n7.The aggregate amount to be raised by issuance of CP by a corporate should not\nexceed the working capital (fund-based) limit sanctioned to it by bank/banks. Corporates can\nautomatically raise CP to the extent of 50 percent of working capital limits without prior\nclearance from the bank/s. (The 50 per cent limit would also be inclusive of any outstanding\nCP). However, companies intending to issue CP in excess of 50 per cent of working capital\nlimits can do so after getting prior clearance  from bank/s.\n8.The aggregate amount of CP issued by a PD/SD should be within the limits fixed by\ntheir respective Boards.\n9.An FI can issue  CP within the overall umbrella limit fixed by the RBI, i.e., issue of\nCP together with other instruments, viz., term money borrowings, term deposits, certificates\nof deposit and inter-corporate deposit should not exceed 100 per cent of its net owned funds,\nas per the latest audited balance sheet.\n10.The total amount of CP proposed to be issued should be raised within a period of two\nweeks from the date on which the issuer opens the issue for subscription. CP may be issued\non a single date or in parts on different dates provided that in the latter case, each CP shall\nhave the same maturity date.\n11.Every issue of CP, including renewal, should be treated as a fresh issue.\nInvestment in CP\n12.CP may be issued to and held by individuals, banking companie s, other corporate\nbodies registered or incorporated in India and unincorporated bodies, Non-Resident Indians\n(NRIs) and Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). However, investment by FIIs would be\nwithin the 30 per cent limit set for their investments in debt instruments.\nMode of Issuance\n13.CP can be issued either in the form of a promissory note (Schedule I) or in a\ndematerialised form through any of the depositories approved by and registered with SEBI.\nAs regards the existing stock of CP, the same can either continue to be held in physical form\nor can be demateralised, if both the issuer and the investor agree for the same.\n14.CP will be issued at a discount to face value as may be determined by the issuer.\n15.Banks and all-India financial inst itutions are prohibited from underwriting or co-\naccepting issues of Commercial Paper.\nPreference for Dematerialised form\n16.While option is available to both issuers and subscribers, to issue/hold CP in\ndematerialised or physical form, issuers and subscribers, banks and financial institutions in\nparticular, are encouraged to prefer exclusive reliance on dematerialised form of\nissue/holding.\nPayment of CP3\n17.On maturity of CP, when the CP is held in physical form the holder of the CP shall\npresent the instrument for payment to the issuer through the Issuing and Paying Agent (IPA).\nHowever, when the CP is held in demat form, the holder of the CP will have to get it\nredeemed through the depository and receive payment from the IPA.\nProcedure for Issuance\n18. (a) For Corporates\n(i)Any company proposing to issue CP should submit a proposal incorporating details in\nthe form annexed hereto as Schedule II.A, as modified from time to time, by the Reserve\nBank of India, to the financing banking company together with the certificate issued by the\ncredit rating agency. The financing banking company, on receipt of the proposal for issuance\nof CP, shall scrutinise the same and on being satisfied shall take the proposal on record.\n(ii)A Company proposing to iss ue CP upto 50 per cent of working capital limits may,\nafter submitting the proposal as stated in paragraph 18( i) above, open the issue for\nsubscription.\n(iii)However, a company proposing to issue CP in excess of 50 per cent of working\ncapital limits can open the issue for subscription only after the proposal has been taken on\nrecord by the financing banking company.\n(iv)Companies must ensure that the proposed issue of CP is complete within the period of\ntwo weeks from the date of opening of the issue for subscription.\n(v)After the exchange of deal confirmation between the investor and the issuer, issuing\ncompany shall issue physical certificates to the investor or arrange for crediting the CP to the\ninvestor's account with depository. Investors shall be given a copy of IPA agreement, copy of\nIPA certificate to the effect that documents are in order and a statement of account from\ndepository (in case of demat form).\n(vi)The initial investor in CP shall pay the discounted value of the CP by means of a\ncrossed account payee cheque to the account of the issuing company with the financing\nbanking company only.\n(vii)The working capital (fund-based) limit of every company issuing the CP shall be\ncorrespondingly reduced by the financing banking company, once the CP is issued and the\nfinancing banking company shall make necessary adjustments in the account of such\ncompany respectively, with the banking company/the other member banking companies.\n(viii)Every company issuing CP shall within three days from th e date of completion of\nissue, advise the Reserve Bank of India {Industrial and Export Credit Department, Central\nOffice, Mumbai (IECD)}, through the financing banking company, the amount of CP actually\nissued.\n(b) For Primary Dealer/Satellite Dealer4\n(i) Every Primary Dealer(PD)/Satellite Dealer(SD) proposing to issue CP should report\ndetails of the proposed issue to the Reserve Bank of India (IECD) in the Form annexed hereto\nas Schedule II.B, as modified from time to time by the Reserve Bank of India.\n(ii)Every PD/SD shall thereafter, make arrangements for privately placing the issue and\nensure that the proposed issue of CP is complete within a period of two weeks from the date\nof communication to the Reserve Bank.\n(iii)The initial investor in CP shall pa y the discounted value of the CP by means of a\ncrossed account payee cheque to the account of the issuing PD/SD.\n(iv)Every PD/SD issuing CP shall advise the Reserve Bank of India (IECD) the amount\nof CP actually issued, within three days from the date of completion of issue.\n(c) For All-India Financial Institutions\n(i)Every financial institution proposing to issue CP should report details of the proposed\nissue to the Reserve Bank of India (IECD) in the Form annexed hereto as Schedule II.C, as\nmodified from time to time by the Reserve Bank of India.\n(ii)The financial institution should ensure that aggregate amount of CP issued is within\nthe overall umbrella limit fixed by Reserve Bank of India.\n(iii)Every financial institution should thereafter make arrangements for privately placing\nthe issue and ensure that the proposed issue of CP is complete within a period of two weeks\nfrom the date of communication to the Reserve Bank.\n(iv)The initial investor in CP shall pay the discounted value of the CP by means of a\ncrossed account payee cheque to the account of the issuing financial institution.\n(v)Every financial institution issuing CP shall advise the Reserve Bank of India (IECD\nwith copy to Financial Institutions Division, Department of Banking Supervision) the amount\nof CP actually issued, within three days from the date of completion of issue.\nRole and Responsibilities\n19.The role and responsibilities of issuer, financing banking company, IPA and CRA are\nset out below :\n(a) Issuer\nWith the simplification in the procedure for CP issuance, corporates/issuers would now have\nmore flexibility.

The Bank last amended the NBFC regulations on January 13, 2000 to address the\nsupervisory concerns arising out of certain undesirable practices of some NBFCs so that the\nNBFCs grow on sound and healthy lines and to enhance the protection available to the NBFC\ndepositors. However, we have received further suggestions from the NBFCs and members  of\nInformal Advisory Group on NBFCs. It has been decided to amend the above-mentioned\ndirections, as per details given below :\n(1)  Definition of public deposits for NBFCs other than RNBCs\n(i) The Bank has received a number of representations from the trade and\ncommerce that it is common for the members of family and other relatives  of\nthe directors of the companies to render financial help in the days of crisis of\nany business enterprise. This tradition holds good even for the entities engaged\nin the financial business. However, the present provisions of NBFC Directions\non Acceptance of Public Deposits restrict borrowings from these sources\nowing to such receipt of money also falling within the purview of public\ndeposits. As a result, the small and medium NBFCs which are family run but\ndo not fulfill the conditions relating to the minimum investment grade  credit\nrating are not able to access funds from their relatives thus affecting adversely\ntheir business operations.\n(ii) We have reviewed the position and it has been decided(a) to exempt the deposits from relative of a Director of the NBFC from\nthe purview of public deposits;\n(b) that the onus of the proof  that  deposits have been accepted from the\nrelative of a director of the company rests with  the NBFC  itself;\n(c) that the NBFCs shall obtain a separate application form from such\ndepositors with suitable notice to their attention that such deposits\nwould be treated as deposits from relatives;\n(d) that the relationship between the depositor and the specific director/s of\nthe company  would be material on the date of acceptance of such\ndeposits. On any director ceasing to be the director of the company,\nsuch deposits would remain outside the definition of public deposits till\nthe date of maturity. If the deposits are required to be renewed, the\ndepositor-relative should have the relationship with one of the directors\nof the company on the date of renewal  of such deposits by the NBFC.\nIf the depositor does not have a relative among the directors on the\ndate of renewal, the deposits, if renewed, would be treated as public\ndeposits; and\n(e) that such deposits in the hand of both private limited NBFCs and\npublic limited   NBFCs as also the NBFCs accepting public deposits\nand those not accepting public deposits  would be exempted from RBI\nRegulations.\n(2) Mandatory compliance by RNBCs with Prudential\nNorms for primary eligibility to accept deposits\n(i) The provisions of prudential norms were extended to the residuary non-\nbanking companies under the provisions of Non-Banking Financial\nCompanies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998 as contained in\nthe notification No. DFC.119/ DG(SPT)-98 dated January 31, 1998. However,\nthe stipulations that RNBC should mandatorily comply with prudential norms,\nas applicable, were so far, inadvertently not included in the RNBC Directions\nas a precondition for its eligibility for accepting deposits like in the case of\nother NBFCs.\n(ii) It has now been decided to amend these Directions providing therein that\nthe compliance by every RNBC with prudential norms is mandatory and a pre-requisite for acceptance of deposits by these companies in the interests of\ndepositors' protection.\n(iii) Accordingly, the RNBCs  which do not comply with the Prudential Norms\nare directed to stop accepting deposits forthwith.\n(3)Interest rates payable on RNBC deposits\n(i) Residuary Non-Banking Companies ( RNBCs) are the only finance companies\nwhich are presently enjoined upon to pay a minimum rate of interest on their\ndeposits whereas other NBFCs can pay any rate of interest subject to the\nmaximum ceiling on the interest rate prescribed by RBI. These companies are\nobliged to keep at least 80 per cent of the aggregate deposit liabilities in the\nsecurities specified by the Bank on which the return is correlated to the yield\non sovereign papers. In the wake of certain fundamental changes in the money\nmarket like the bank rate has been reduced to 7 per cent, the overall yield on\ntheir investments has declined.\n(ii) Some of the RNBCs have represented to the Bank that they are unable to\nreduce the interest rate payable on their deposits because of the floor ceiling\nprescribed by the Bank. It has, therefore, been decided keeping in view the\nfactors stated in ( i) above that RNBCs should pay interest rates on their\ndeposits which shall not be less than,\n(a) at the rate of 6 per cent per annum (to be compounded annually) on the\namount deposited in lump sum or at monthly or longer intervals; and\n(b) at the rate of 4 per cent per annum (to be compounded annually) on the\namount deposited under daily deposit schemes.\nOther provisions in this regard remain unchanged.\n(4)     Permission to RNBCs to invest in the\nschemes of Mutual Funds besides UTI\n(i) We have received requests from certain RNBCs that they may be permitted to\ninvest in the schemes of mutual funds ,  besides those of UTI. The Directions\nto these companies  regarding investments of the aggregate amount of deposit\nliabilities are driven by the objectives to safeguarding the depositors' interestwhile ensuring that these companies remain economically viable and have\nsufficient avenues for investment of their deployable funds.\n(ii) It has, therefore, been decided to allow these companies to\n(a) invest  upto 2 percent of the amount of aggregate deposit liabilities to the\ndepositors in any scheme/s of any mutual fund governed by SEBI\nregulations subject to the condition that aggregate of such investments\nincluding the investments in the schemes of UTI should not exceed 10\npercent of such amount.\n(b) It may be clarified that the ceiling of 2 percent is not applicable to the\nschemes of UTI and the company may invest upto 10 percent of such\namount in the schemes of UTI. It is also clarified that the norms for\nincome recognition and the valuation of investments in mutual fund units\nas prescribed under the NBFC Directions on Prudential Norms would be\napplicable, ipso facto.\n(5) Amendments to Prudential Norms Directions\n(i) The NBFCs and  their Associations have brought to the notice of the Bank that\n(a) in the case of credit against second hand assets becoming NPA because\nthe value of such assets after five years is treated as nil on account of\nadministered rate of depreciation at 20 percent per annum on straight\nline method, the company has to make entire provision for such credit\nin the first year itself and thus financing of second hand assets has been\nbadly hit;\n(b) there have also been instances that the NBFCs have granted finance for\nperiods upto 5 years whereas the NBFC Directions on Prudential\nNorms envisage full provisions against NPAs within a period of 4\nyears; and\n(c) the concept of net realisable value is a matter of interpretation because\nof the different bench-marks used by different NBFCs.\n(ii) It is recognised that the equipment leasing and hire purchase finance companies have\nbeen playing an important role in financing  of new as well as second hand\ncommercial assets. It is also our endeavour that the RBI regulations should be self-contained and should lead to uniform  practices among the NBFCs. It has accordingly\nbeen decided to rationalise the prudential norms in respect of the equipment leasing\nand hire purchase finance assets as under :\n(a) The NBFCs should make provisions against NPAs with correlation to\nthe net book value of the assets in four stages at 10, 40, 70 and 100 per\ncent (as against the present three stages of 10, 50 and 100 per cent );\n(b) In the case of HP agreements, the amount of caution money  or margin\nmoney or security deposit may be adjusted, if received as per the terms\nof agreement, against the provisions required to be made for unsecured\nportion, provided the same has not been taken into account while\ncalculating the equated monthly instalment earlier. However, the value\nof any other security to which the NBFC has a valid recourse may be\ndeducted only against the provisions stipulated under clause (ii) of\nparagraph 8(2);\n(c) In the case of leased asset, the amount of security deposit together with\nthe value of any other asset to which the NBFC has a valid recourse\nmay be deducted only against the provisions stipulated under clause\n(ii) of paragraph 8(2);\n(d) The value of second hand assets would be the cost of acquisition of the\nasset by the hirer and not the invoice cost of the vehicle on the date of\nits original acquisition. The provisions in case of the asset becoming\nNPA should then be made on the such cost of acquisition on the same\nlines as are applicable to financing of a new vehicle;\n(e) The concept of net book value has been done away with and the\nunsecured portion has to be computed as the difference between the\ntotal dues and the depreciated value of the hire purchase asset; and\n(f) Other provisions in the Prudential Provisioning Norms shall remain\nunchanged like the income recognition on accrual basis upto 12\nmonths, stipulation that the outstanding balance in a non-performing\naccount shall be fully provided for within 12 months of the date of\nexpiry of the contract period; the rate of depreciation for hire purchase\nassets at 20 per cent on straight line method, etc.\n(6)Formats of returns to be submitted by NBFCs and RNBCsWith the introduction of a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory framework in\nthe year 1998 and installation of state of the art wide area network for off-site\nsurveillance, the need for rationalising and modifying the existing returns being\nsubmitted was felt essential. The earlier system of returns on one hand called for some\ninformation which has lost relevance at the same time some important information\nwas not available in the existing system. Therefore, the returns being submitted by the\nNBFCs have been modified and rationalised. Further, the annual return submitted by\nNBFCs having total assets of Rs.100 crore and above giving the comparative position\nof operational data for the last three years and the quarterly return submitted by\nNBFCs holding public deposits of Rs.50 crore and above have been discontinued.\n(7)Introduction for NBFC Depositors\nIt has been brought to the notice of the Bank by a number of NBFCs and their\nAssociations that the NBFCs raise public deposits from the depositors located in  far-\nflung areas  and deal with the general masses who may not be fully conversant with\nthe banking needs. It is advised for abundant clarification that introduction for NBFC\ndepositors mean the identification of the prospective depositor. The NBFCs may\nensure that the new depositor is not a fictitious person by verifying physically some\nform of  identification, i. e. PAN number, Election ID card, passport, ration card or\nintroduction by one of the existing depositors, etc. A copy of such an evidence may be\nkept on record by the company.\nOther Measures for protection of interests of depositors\n3.The following additional  measures are being advised as a part of the various steps\ntaken for the  protection of interests of depositors:\n(1) Registered NBFCs to brand their Certificates of Registration\n(i) The Bank has stratified the NBFCs into two categories viz. those taking public\ndeposits and those not accessing public deposits. The companies specifically\npermitted to accept public deposits are so advised and the other companies are\nalso advised that they should not accept public deposits without prior\npermission of the Bank.\n(ii) The companies taking public deposits are comprehensively regulated for\nprotection of depositors' interests. However, the format of Certificate ofregistration does not make any distinction between the companies permitted to\naccept and not allowed to accept such deposits.\n(iii) There are chances that a few unscrupulous NBFCs registered with the Bank\nbut not allowed to accept public deposits may  misrepresent to the gullible\npublic to place their savings with them on the ground that they are registered\nwith the Bank. While the Bank would take serious action against the erring\ncompanies, it is advised in the interests of the NBFCs and the depositors that\nall the NBFCs who have so far been issued a Certificate of Registration by the\nBank should\n(a) brand the Certificate as Deposit Taking Company or as Non-\nDeposit Taking Company in bold letters in red ink; and\n(b) send to the Regional Office of DNBS of the Bank a copy thereof\nduly certified by their auditors stating therein that the original\ncertificate has been so branded.\n(2) Acceptance of public deposits by Registered NBFCs and RNBCs\n(i) Three year period allowed to the NBFCs under the provisions of RBI Act for attaining\nminimum NOF of  Rs.25 lakhs has since expired on January 10, 2000. Although such\na period could be extended by the Bank at its discretion, it has been decided to allow\nextension of time only on a selective basis. Nevertheless, the extension of time is\nrelevant only for attaining the minimum NOF and not for acceptance of public\ndeposits. The Bank has also been aggressively advertising that the members of public\nshould make deposits only with the registered NBFCs.\n(ii) Having completed the work of registration of all eligible  NBFCs, it has been decided\nthat registration of an NBFC with RBI under Section 45-IA of the RBI Act would be\nthe primary eligibility criteria for accessing public deposits. Accordingly, only the\nregistered NBFCs, if specifically permitted by the Bank should accept public deposits,\nsubject to their eligibility as per the provisions of Directions as applicable. The\nunregistered NBFCs are not allowed to accept public deposits even though their\napplications may be pending with the Bank for any reason. Further the NBFCs which\nhave been granted the Certificate of Registration but have been specifically  advised\nto obtain prior permission of the Bank before they intend to accept public deposits,\nshould scrupulously adhere to the above Directions and should not accept public\ndeposits until they have been permitted to do so.Guidelines for entry of NBFCs  into insurance business\n4.In the statement of Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2000-2001 announced by\nour Governor on April 27, 2000 it was indicated, inter alia, that the guidelines for entry of\nNBFCs into insurance business would be announced shortly. Accordingly, the Bank has\nissued on June 9 ,  2000 the final guidelines after taking into account the\nviews/suggestions/comments of  the market participants. A copy of the guidelines is\nenclosed as Annexure I. The aspirant NBFCs are advised to make an application along with\nnecessary particulars duly certified  by their statutory auditors to the Regional Office of\nDepartment of Non-Banking Supervision under whose jurisdiction the registered office of the\nNBFCs is situated.\n5.A copy each of the amending Notifications No. 141-145 dated June 30, 2000 is\nenclosed. You are requested to ensure meticulous compliance with the regulatory framework.\n6.Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter to the General Manager/Deputy General\nManager of the Regional Office of the Department of Non-Banking Supervision under whose\njurisdiction the registered office of your company is located.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(V. S. N. Murty)\nChief General Manager - in -Charge\nEncls : As aboveIssued on June 9, 2000\nFinal  Guidelines for Entry of NBFCs  into Insurance\n1.Any  non-banking financial company (NBFC) registered with RBI having net owned\nfund of Rs. 2 crore  would be permitted to undertake insurance business as agent of insurance\ncompanies on fee basis, without any risk participation.\n2.  All NBFCs registered with RBI  which satisfy the eligibility criteria given below will\nbe permitted to set up a joint venture company for undertaking insurance business with risk\nparticipation, subject to safeguards. The maximum equity contribution such an NBFC  can\nhold in the joint venture company will normally be 50 per cent of the paid-up capital of the\ninsurance company. On a selective basis, the Reserve Bank of India may permit a higher\nequity contribution by a promoter NBFC  initially, pending divestment of equity within the\nprescribed period [see Note (1) below].  The eligibility criteria for joint venture participant\nwill be as under, as per the latest available audited balance sheet.   \n(i) The  owned fund of the NBFC  should not be less than Rs. 500 crore,\n(ii) The CRAR of the  NBFC  engaged in loan and investment activities holding\npublic deposits should be not less than 15% and for other NBFCs at 12%\nirrespective of their holding public deposits or not.\n(iii) The level of net non-performing assets should be  not more than 5% of the\ntotal outstanding leased/hire purchase assets and advances taken together,\n(iv) The  NBFC should have net  profit for the last three continuous years,\n(v) The track record of the performance of the subsidiaries, if any, of the\nconcerned NBFC  should be satisfactory,\n(vi) Regulatory compliance and servicing public deposits, if held.\nThe provisions of RBI Act would be applicable for such investments while computing the net\nowned funds of the NBFC.\n3. In case where a foreign partner contributes 26 per cent of the equity with the approval\nof insurance Regulatory and Development Authority/Foreign Investment Promotion Board,\nmore than one NBFC  may be  allowed to participate in the equity of the insurance joint\nventure. As such participants will also assume insurance risk, only those  NBFCs which\nsatisfy the criteria given in paragraph 2 above, would be eligible.\n4.   No NBFC would be allowed to conduct such business departmentally. A subsidiary or\ncompany in the same group of an NBFC or of another NBFC  engaged in the business of annon-banking financial institution  or banking business will not normally be allowed to join\nthe insurance company on risk participation basis.\n5. NBFCs registered w ith RBI  which are not eligible as joint venture participant, as\nabove can make investments up to  10 per cent of the owned fund of the NBFC or Rs.50\ncrore, whichever is lower, in the insurance company . Such participation shall be treated as an\ninvestment and should be without any contingent liability for the  NBFC.  The eligibility\ncriteria for these NBFCs  will be as under:\n(i) The CRAR of the NBFC  (applicable only to those holding public deposits)  should\nnot be less than  12 per cent if engaged in equipment leasing/hire purchase finance\nactivities and 15 per cent if it is a loan or investment company ;\n(ii) The level of net NPA should be  not more than 5 per cent of total outstanding\nleased/hire purchase assets and advances;\n(iii) The NBFC  should have net profit for the last three continuous years.\n6.All NBFCs registered with RBI  entering into insurance business as agents or\ninvestors or on risk participation basis will be required to obtain prior approval of the Reserve\nBank. The Reserve Bank will give permission to NBFCs  on case to case basis keeping in\nview all relevant factors. It  should be ensured that risks involved in insurance business do\nnot get transferred to the NBFC  and that the NBFC  business does not get contaminated by\nany risks which may arise from insurance business.\nNotes :\n(1)Holding of equity by a promoter NBFC  in an insurance company or participation in\nany form in insurance business will be subject to compliance with any rules and regulations\nlaid down by the IRDA/Central Government. This will include compliance with Section 6AA\nof the Insurance Act as amended by the IRDA Act, 1999, for divestment of equity in excess\nof 26 per cent of the paid  up capital within a prescribed period of time.\n(2)For applications received during the fi nancial year 2000-2001, any  fresh capital\ninfused after the  audited balance sheet date for 1999-2000 would also be taken into account.\nThe unaudited and certified balance sheet as on a latest date may be reckoned  for\ndetermining the eligibility criteria and the audited balance sheet for the above date would be\nsubmitted to RBI as soon as possible.(3)For subsequent years, the eligibility criteria would be reckoned with reference to the\nlatest available audited balance sheet for the previous year.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/14089.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 29, 2000", "info": "DBOD BC NO. 186/12.01.001/99-2000\n28.06.2000\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\n( Excluding Regional Rural Banks)\nDear Sir\nSection 42 of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 - Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)-\n-maintenance of minimum level of 65 per cent on a daily basis.\nAs per extant instructions the banks are required to maintain a minimum level of 65.0 per cent of\nCRR balances required to be maintained by banks on each of the days of the reporting fortnight\nbeginning the first working day upto the 13th day and on the 14th day of the reporting fortnight ,\nbanks are allowed to maintain less than 65.0 per cent of the required cash balances to adjust the\naverage of daily balances to the required level.\nAs June 30, 2000, the reporting Friday, happens to be RBI 's account closing day , the banks will\nnot be in a position to transact any business with RBI on that day.

They include, inter alia, progressive\nderegulation, introduction of IRS/ FRA, introduction of Asset-Liability Management (ALM)\nsystem, apparent shift in investors preference towards short-term instruments, etc. These\ndevelopments have necessitated the review of  extant guidelines relating to raising of\nresources by FIs. Accordingly the following modifications are being prescribed with\nimmediate effect:\n2.FIs  are not  required to seek  Reserve Bank\u2019s, issue-wise prior approval/ registration\nfor raising of resources by way of issue of bonds (both public issue and private placement)\nsubject to the fulfillment of  the following conditions :\ni. The minimum maturity of the bond   should  be  3 years ;\nii. In respect of bonds having  call/ put or both options, the same should not be\nexercisable before the expiry of one year from the date of issue of bonds ;\niii. The YTM offered, at the time of issue of bonds, should not exceed 200 basis\npoints above the YTM on the Government of India securities of equal residual\nmaturities.  The effective YTM on instruments having call/ put options should also\nsatisfy this requirement ;\niv. No  \u2018Exit\u2019 option  on the  bonds  will be  offered before the end of  one year,\nfrom the date of issue.\n3. The  outstandings of total resources mobilised at any point of time by an individual FI\nincluding funds mobilised under the \u2018umbrella limit\u2019 as prescribed by the Reserve Bank\nshould not exceed 10 times its  net owned funds (NOF)  as per  the latest audited  balance\nsheet.\n4. The  limit  fixed for raising resources is only an enabling provision, FIs are advised to\narrive at their requirements of resources along with maturity structure and the  interest rate2offered thereon on a realistic basis, derived  inter alia, from a sound system of ALM / Risk\nManagement.\n5. In case of   floating rate  bonds,  FIs  should seek  prior approval from Reserve Bank,\nin regard to \u2018reference  rate\u2019 selected and the methods  of floating rate  determination. The\nsame is not required for subsequent individual issues so long as the underlying reference rate\nand method of floating rate determination remain unchanged.\n6. FIs should take note to comply with the prudential requirements of  other regulatory\nauthorities such as SEBI, etc. as hitherto .\n7. FIs are required to furnish  monthly statements giving details on the resources  raised\nas per the Annexure I and II enclosed herewith. The statements as at the end of a month are\nrequired to be furnished on or before the 10th day of the following month. The details  in\nrespect of public issue of bonds  are to be incorporated in the statement for the month during\nwhich the respective issue is closed.\nThe  statements are to be addressed to the Chief General Manager, Financial Institutions\nDivision, Department of Banking Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, The Arcade, Tower 6,\nWorld Trade Center, Cuffe Parade, Mumbai 400 005.

Part A of the guidelines\ncontained the control mechanisms which are compulsorily to be adopted / implemented by the\nPDs while Part B contained the prudential systems / controls the PDs are expected to have in\nplace like any market participant. The PDs, after adopting / putting in place the guidelines, are\nrequired to submit a Report to us on the implementation by February 29, 2000.\n2.  The implementation reports have since been received from the PDs.  While reporting\nimplementation of the guidelines, some PDs have made certain suggestions / requested for\nclarification on few items in the guidelines. The suggestions / clarifications desired and the views\ntaken thereon on examination are indicated below for information and guidance of the PDs.\n(a) Limit regarding transactions put through a broker.\nViews / Clarification\nNo change in the guidelines is proposed for the present.  The matter, however, is under\ncontinuous review.\n(b) 100 per cent Concurrent Audit of the transactions etc.\nViews / Clarification\nSince Concurrent Audit is considered the first line of defense and enables detection of violations\n/ omissions on a real time, it is essential that Concurrent Audit should cover 100 per cent of the\nsecurities transactions.  Irregularities should be rectified immediately and brought to the notice of\nthe competent authority on a concurrent basis.\n(c) Treatment of brokerage, commission, fees etc.\nViews / Clarification\nNormally, for securities firms where the securities are stock-in-trade, charges such as brokerage,\ncommission etc. \u2013 any expenditure to purchase and sell the current assets \u2013 would be of revenue /\ndeferred revenue nature.  The broken period interest received / paid also get adjusted at the time\nof coupon payment.  There could however, be differences in the treatment of these items\nbetween the IAS and the GAAP accounting standards.  Whichever is the standard followed, the\nrequirement would be that the method should be true and fair; should not result in overstating the\nprofit or assets value; should be followed consistently; and be generally acceptable.  The\nrequirements of the tax authorities need also be fulfilled.  It has therefore been felt that in case\nthe system followed by a particular PD does not dilute these principle and conforms to generally\nadopted accounting standards such as IAS, GAAP etc. and if the same is acceptable to the taxThe buying entity accepting the SGL form should subject the form to verification of the\nsignature etc. in order to ensure its authenticity before submitting for transfer.\n(e) The other suggestions received viz.  the stipulations regarding sale of securities only when\nthey are held in own account; sale of securities obtained in repo not being allowed, should be\nremoved; securities lending should be permitted and the cash / securities grid lock issues need to\nbe solved.\nViews / Clarification\nAll these issues have been taken on hand and are being / have been examined separately.  Views\n/ decisions, when finalised, have been / would be advised to the PDs.\nYours faithfully,\n(A.S. Rao)\nDy.

IDMC No 3968 /03.75.00/ 99-2000\nMay 29, 2000\nJyestha 8, 1922\nTo:\nAll Primary Dealers and Scheduled Commercial Banks (Excluding RRBs)\nDear Sirs,\nSub: Liquidity Adjustment Facility\nEnclosed is a Scheme of the \u201cLiquidity Adjustment Facility\u201d as announced in the\nStatement on Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2000-01 for implementation from\nJune 5, 2000. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(Usha Thorat)\nChief General Manager2\nScheme of Liquidity Adjustment Facility\nPursuant to the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee Report on\nBanking Reforms ( Narasimham Committee II), it was decided in principle, to introduce a\nLiquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) operated through repo and reverse repo.  In April\n1999, an Interim Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was introduced to provide a ceiling\nand the Fixed Rate Repos were continued to provide a floor for the money market rates.\nFollowing the measures announced in the Statement on Monetary and Credit policy for\nthe year 2000-2001, it has been decided to implement the first stage of LAF from June 5,\n2000.  The details of the Scheme are as under:\n1. The Scheme :\nUnder the scheme, ( i) Repo auctions (for absorption of liquidity) and (ii) reverse repo\nauctions (for injection of liquidity) will be conducted on a daily basis (except Saturdays).\nBut for the intervening holidays and Fridays, the repo tenor will be one day. On Fridays,\nthe auctions will be held for three days maturity to cover the following Saturday and\nSunday. With the introduction of the Scheme, the existing Fixed Rate Repo will be\ndiscontinued. So also the liquidity support extended to all scheduled commercial banks\n(excluding RRBs) and Primary Dealers through Additional Collaterialised Lending\nFacility (ACLF) and refinance/reverse repos under Level II, respectively will be\nwithdrawn.  Export Refinance and Collateralised Lending Facility (CLF) at Bank Rate\nwill continue as per the existing procedures.   Like-wise, Primary Dealers will continue to\navail of liquidity support at level I at Bank Rate. The funds from the Facility are expected\nto be used by the banks for their day-to-day mismatches in liquidity. The Scheme will be\nreviewed from time to time in consultation with market participants and appropriate\nchanges will be made in the light of experience.\n2. Rate of Interest:\nInterest rates in respect of both repos and reverse repos will be decided through cut off\nrates emerging from auctions on \u201cuniform price\u201d basis conducted by the Reserve Bank of\nIndia, at Mumbai.  The repo rate in per cent per annum expected by the tenderer will be\nexpressed up to two decimal points rounded off to the nearest 5 basis points. As there will\nbe no adjustment for accrued coupon, the cash flow will depend upon the repo rate\nemerging on day-to-day basis.\n3. Mechanics of operations:\ni). Bids   will be received in tender forms ( Annexure I and II) at IDM Cell\nbefore 11.00 a.m. on week days except Saturdays.  A separate box for the\npurpose will be kept at the reception on the Ground floor of the Central\nOffice Building. Processing of the bids will be done at IDMC. The auction\nresults will be displayed by Mumbai Office by 1.00 p.m.3\nii). The repo will be conducted as \u201cHold in Custody\u201d type, wherein the\nReserve Bank of India will act as a custodian for the participants and hold\nthe securities on their behalf in the Repo/Reverse Repo Constituents\u2019\nAccounts. Further, for the purpose the participants will have to give an\nundertaking as given in the respective tender forms authorizing RBI to act\non behalf of them.  Reserve Bank of India shall not, however be held\nresponsible for any loss, damage or liability on account of acting as the\nCustodian on behalf of the participants. A Repo Constituents\u2019 SGL\nAccount (RC SGL Account) and Reverse Repo Constituents\u2019 SGL\nAccount (RRC SGL Account) will be opened and held in the Securities\nDepartment in Mumbai Office for this purpose which will have institution-\nwise subsidiary records of the securities sold under Repo and securities\nbought under reverse repo. RBI will have Subsidiary Accounts in the case\nof both of these Accounts.\niii) On success in auction in respect of repos the tenderer\u2019s RC SGL\nAccount will be credited with the required quantum of securities debiting\nBank\u2019s subsidiary account/Investment Account.  Likewise, the tenderer\u2019s\nCurrent Account will be debited for the resultant cash flows crediting the\nBank\u2019s Account. The transaction will be reversed in the second leg.\niv) In the case of reverse repos, on acceptance of bid, the tenderer\u2019s    SGL\naccount/  RRC SGL Account  will be debited with the required quantum\nof securities crediting Bank\u2019s Investment Account/Subsidiary RRC SGL\nAccount. Accordingly, the tenderer\u2019s Current Account will be credited\nwith the repo amount debiting the Bank's account. The transactions will be\nreversed in the second leg.\nv) Transactions between RBI and counter parties including operation of\nthe RC SGL Account and RRC SGL Account would not require separate\nSGL forms as provision will be made in the application form for the\npurpose. Likewise, transfer of securities from/to RBI\u2019s Investment\nAccount and Subsidiary Accounts in the Repo and Reverse Repo SGL\naccount will not require signing of  SGL transfer forms. However, transfer\nfrom tenderer\u2019s SGL Account to the RRC SGL Account will require\ncompletion of SGL form. In the case of reverse repos tenderers will have\nthe option to either use the RRC SGL Account route or getting their SGL\nAccounts debited for the purpose of transferring securities to RBI.4\nvi) Pricing of all securities including Treasury bills will be at Face Value\nfor repo/reverse repo operations by RBI. Accrued interest as on the date of\ntransaction will be ignored for the purpose of pricing of securities.\nCoupon, if any, will be transferred to the RBI in the case of repos and RBI\nwill collect the coupon if any on the due dates and credit the same to the\nparty\u2019s Current Account in the case of reverse repos.\n4. Eligibility :\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) and Primary\nDealers ( PDs) having Current Account and SGL Account with RBI, Mumbai will be\neligible to participate in the Repo and Reverse Repo auctions.\n5.

Settlement of Transactions:\nThe settlement of transactions in the auction will take place on the same day.\n9. SLR and Securities held in Repo SGL Account :\nSecurities held by RBI on behalf of banks Repo Constituents\u2019 SGL account and credit\nbalance in the RRC SGL Account will be counted for SLR purpose and a certificate  will\nbe issued to banks by RBI on a fortnightly basis.

It has been decided by Reserve Bank of India (Exchange Control\nDepartment) to allow Export Houses/Trading Houses/ Star Trading Houses/Super Star\nTrading Houses with good track record, on application by them, a longer period of upto\n360 days from date of shipment for realisation of proceeds of export   of certain goods as\nallowed by our Exchange Control Department from time to time as per the A.D.\n(G.P.Series) circulars, to the Russian Federation on consignment basis against repayment\nof State Credits. In this connection A.D. (G.P. Series) Circular No.5 dated May 31, 1999\nmay  be seen for procedural details.\n2. In view of longer period of realisation permitted, ab-initio, for these goods it has been\ndecided to rationalise the interest rates on the post-shipment credit granted for export of\nthese  goods on  consignment  basis  to Russian Federation against repayment of State\nCredits. Accordingly, in respect of post-shipment credit extended to such exports the\ninterest rate applicable will be as under :\nPeriod  of  Post-\nshipment Credit Rate of Interest\na) Upto 90 days from\ndate of advanceThe rate applicable for post-shipment credit, for usance\nbills, for period upto 90 days (at present not exceeding\n10%per annum).\nb) Beyond 90 days and\nupto 360 days from date\nof shipment.The rate applicable for post-shipment credit, for usance\nbills, for the period beyond 90 days and upto six months,\nfrom the date of shipment (at present 12% per annum).3.It is expected that sale proceeds of goods exported  on consignment basis to the\nRussian Federation would be realised within the permitted period of upto 360 days and\npost-shipment credit liquidated. In case, however, this does not happen, the higher rate of\ninterest as applicable for bills under exports realised beyond 6 months from the date of\nshipment i.e. the rate applicable to \"Export Credit Not Otherwise Specified\" (ECNOS) at\npost-shipment stage will apply for the entire period beyond 6 months.  Banks are free to\ndecide with effect from 29th October 1999 the appropriate rate of interest for ECNOS at\npost shipment stage subject to extant PLR and spread guidelines.\n4. The above instructions will come into force with immediate effect. These changes are\napplicable only to post-shipment credit against exports on consignment basis to the\nRussian Federation where extension of time for realisation  beyond 6 months from the\ndate of export has been permitted by RBI (Exchange Control Department) before\nshipment is made. There is no change in the rates of interest on pre-shipment credit.\n5. Please note that the refinance to banks against export credit would, however, be\navailable from RBI upto a period of 180 days only each at pre-shipment and post-\nshipment stages.\nPlease acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(S.S.

Further, in terms of\nparagraph C.2 of Memorandum PEM, service contracts as specified therein, need prior\nclearance of authorised dealer/ Exim Bank/Working Group as the case may be, at pre-bid\nstage.\nIt has now been decided to dispense with the requirement of clearance of project\nexport proposals (including service contract proposals) at pre-bid stage.  Hence, exporters\ndesiring to submit bids for execution of projects abroad including service contracts will\nnot be required to obtain clearance for submission of bids from authorised dealer/ Exim\nBank/Working Group.  Exporters, in such cases ,  should, however, in their own interest,\nensure that conditions as laid down in Memorandum PEM for submission of bids are\ncomplied with.\n2.Bridge Finance\nIn terms of paragraph B.5(g) of Memorandum PEM, bridge finance for meeting\ntemporary short-falls in working capital in respect of turnkey projects and civil\nconstruction contracts, may be approved by authorised dealer/ Exim Bank provided the\nfinance required does not exceed 15% of the contract value.

It has now been decided to permit authorised dealers also to consider such\nproposals themselves without forwarding them to Exim Bank.\n4.Approval for payment terms\nIt has been decided to dispense with the requirement stipulated at paragraph\nB.7(vi) of Memorandum PEM that the exporters should obtain Reserve Bank\u2019s approval\nfor payment terms after the proposal at post award stage has been cleared by the\nauthorised dealer/ Exim Bank/Working Group, in all cases where the authority approving\nthe proposal has conveyed such approval on behalf of the Reserve Bank.\n5.Single Foreign Currency Account\nfor more than one project\nIn terms of paragraph D.1(i) of Memorandum PEM, general permission has been\ngranted to project/service exporters for opening foreign currency accounts subject to\nconditions stipulated by the authorised dealer/ Exim Bank/Working Group as the case may\nbe. The exporter in such cases is required to maintain separate foreign currency account\nfor each contract abroad.  It has now been decided to allow the exporter, if he so desires,\nto maintain a single foreign currency account for more than one contract being executed\nabroad in the same country subject to the conditions as may be stipulated by the\nauthorised dealer/ Exim Bank.  It will however, be necessary for the exporter to submit\nproject-wise statement of accounts duly certified by a Chartered Accountant to the\nconcerned office of the Reserve Bank as also to the authorised dealer monitoring the\nprojects.\n6.Third Country Purchases\nIn terms of paragraph D2 of Memorandum PEM, authorised dealers may open\nletters of credit in favour of third country suppliers on back to back  basis provided  the\namounts for which credit is to be opened from India in favour of third country supplier\ndoes not exceed  the  amount  for which  a credit  has  been opened  by the project\nauthority in favour of Indian exporter and the credit has been advised through the same\nauthorised dealer.It has now been decided that such Letters of Credit may be established by any\nauthorised  dealer on a back-to-back basis, subject to the same terms and conditions.\n7.Guarantees\nIn terms of paragraph D.7 of Memorandum PEM the authorised  dealers/ Exim\nBank have been authorised  to furnish, without prior permission of Reserve Bank, bid\nbonds/tender guarantees and advance payment/performance guarantees, in cases where\nthey have been authorised  to approve proposals of exporters to submit bids for\nundertaking contracts abroad.

Review of Macro-economic and Monetary\nDevelopments: 1999-2000\nDomestic Developments\n2.According to the estimates of the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), the GDP\ngrowth in 1999-2000 is likely to be 5.9 per cent as compared with 6.8 per cent in 1998-99 and\n5.0 per cent in 1997-98. (It may be noted that the CSO figures for 1998-99 have been\nsubstantially revised upwards because of increase in the growth rate of agriculture and allied\nactivities to 7.2 per cent during that year.) A welcome feature of macro-economic\ndevelopments last year was a substantial  acceleration in the growth of industrial output,\nparticularly manufacturing output.  Recovery in industrial production, witnessed during the\nfirst six months of the year was further consolidated during the second half of the year.\nDuring April 1999-February 2000, industrial growth was 7.9 per cent, with manufacturing\noutput showing a growth of  8.8 per cent.\n3.The annual rate of inflation as reflected in the movements in the  wholesale price\nindex (1981-82=100) during the year was 3.74 per cent (on a point-to-point basis) and was\n2.97 per cent (on an average basis).  The inflation rates were significantly lower than in the\npreceding year+. The reduction in the rate of inflation was also reflected in the Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI). The CPI for the month of February 2000 showed an increase of 3.61 per\ncent over the previous year (as compared with 8.64 per cent in February 1999).  A relatively\nhigh growth of output, fuelled by sustained industrial recovery, combined with low inflation\nand high reserves, provided a positive environment for monetary management in 1999-2000.\n4.During 1999-2000, the annual growth in M 3, on a point to point basis, was 13.6 per\ncent (provisional) as against 19.2 per cent in 1998-99.  The aggregate deposits of the\nscheduled commercial banks increased by 13.5 per cent as against 19.3 per cent in the\nprevious year.  It may be mentioned that a substantial part of the increase in the aggregate\ndeposits was due to increase in time deposits (of over Rs.87,187 crore). This is a continuation\nof the pattern observed in 1998-99 when almost the entire increase in the aggregate deposits\nwas accounted for by increase in time deposits.\n5.Non-food credit showed an expansion of 16.0 per cent as against an increase of 13.0\nper cent in the previous year. The total flow of funds from scheduled commercial banks to the\ncommercial sector, including banks\u2019 investments in bonds/debentures/shares issued by public\nsector undertakings (PSUs) and private corporate sector and commercial paper, etc., is\nestimated at Rs.69,380 crore as against Rs.56,558 crore in the corresponding period of the\nprevious year.  Total resource flow to the commercial sector, including capital issues, Global\nDepository Receipts  (GDRs) and borrowings from financial institutions, is placed at\nRs.1,34,013 crore as compared with Rs.1,13,488 crore in the previous year.  The faster2\ngrowth in bank credit to the commercial sector despite a lower growth in deposits was\nfacilitated by substantial reduction in cash reserve ratio (CRR) and increase in non-deposit\nsources of funds, such as bills payable, operating surplus, etc.\n6.Partly as a result of tax concessions extended to mutual fun ds in the last year\u2019s\nBudget, there was a substantial increase in resources flowing to such funds during 1999-\n2000. Preliminary figures indicate that mutual funds  have mobilised net resources of\nRs.17,966 crore during the year as compared with a net outflow of Rs.1,204 crore in the\nprevious year. Further growth and development of mutual funds, provided they are able to\ncompete for household and corporate savings without special concessions, could contribute to\nthe development and stability of the financial system in the long run.  A developed financial\ninfrastructure, with multiple intermediaries operating in different asset markets with varying\nrisk profiles, is likely to be less vulnerable to unanticipated developments, including external\nshocks.\n7.Food credit expansion during the year was of the order of Rs.8,875 crore as against\nRs.4,331 crore in the previous year. Investment by scheduled commercial banks in\ngovernment securities increased by Rs.54,612 crore during the year as against Rs.36,261\ncrore in the previous year. The share of lending to government in the overall deployment of\nresources by the scheduled commercial banks during the year was substantially larger than in\nthe previous year.\n8.As per t he Revised Estimates in the Union Budget, the fiscal deficit of the Central\nGovernment (excluding small savings) for 1999-2000 was higher at 5.6 per cent of GDP as\nagainst budgeted figure of 4.0 per cent. As a result, gross market borrowings exceeded the\nbudgeted level by Rs. 15,616 crore. In addition, State Governments\u2019 gross market borrowings\namounted to Rs. 13,706 crore as against Rs.12,114 crore in the previous year\n9.Due to  favourable macro-economic environment, the Reserve Bank was able to meet\nthe large market borrowing requirements of government without too much stress and without\ncausing upward pressure on interest rates. In fact,  secondary market yields on government\nsecurities of 7-year and 10-year maturity were nearly 110-120 basis points lower at end-\nMarch 2000 than those prevailing a year ago. Since 1998-99, a conscious attempt has been\nmade to elongate the maturity structure of marketable debt of the  Government to avoid\nbunching of redemption with consequent pressure on sustainability of the gross market\nborrowing programme.  During 1999-2000, there was no issue of dated securities up to 5\nyears.  Furthermore, about 65 per cent (Rs.56,630 crore) of the total dated securities\n(Rs.86,630 crore) issued during the year was above 10-year maturity.\n10.An important monetary development during the year has been the negative  growth in\nthe monetised deficit of the Government (i.e., net Reserve Bank credit to Government), and\nlow growth of reserve money, despite large borrowing requirements.  As on April 24, 2000,\ni.e., a day before the final closing of government accounts, the monetised deficit of the\nGovernment was negative  by as much as Rs.5,584 crore, reflecting the success achieved by\nReserve Bank in activating its Open Market Operations (OMO).  This compares with an\nincrease  in the monetised deficit by Rs.11,800 crore in 1998-99 and by  Rs.12,915 crore in\n1997-98.  So far as reserve money is concerned, the increase during the year was only 8.1 per\ncent as compared with 14.6 per cent in the previous year.3\n11.The relatively low growth of M 3 of 13.6 per cent (as compared with 19.2 per cent last\nyear) was possible because of a lower expansion in reserve money.  Particularly significant\nwas the decline in the monetised deficit of the government which contributed to this\nfavourable outcome.  It is interesting to note that if the reserve money growth and monetised\ndeficit were of the same order in 1999-2000 as in the previous year, on the basis of the\nnormal relationship among these variables, M 3 expansion could have actually been even\nhigher than last year, which would have had an unfavourable effect on the inflationary\noutlook for the current year.\n12.While some comfort can be drawn from the fact that we have been able to manage a\nlarge government borrowing programme without undue strain on interest rates or the overall\nliquidity environment, it is also clear that such high levels of fiscal deficits are not sustainable\nover the medium term.   The continuing large fiscal deficits year after year have already led\nto sharp increase in repayment obligations on outstanding public debt in the nineties. In 1990-\n91, the gross and net borrowing of the Central Government stood respectively at Rs.8,988\ncrore and Rs.8,001 crore in a ratio of 1:0.89. Thus, for every rupee of fresh borrowing, the\ngovernment received 89 paise in net terms.  In 2000-01, the gross and net borrowings of the\ngovernment are projected at Rs.1,17,704 crore and Rs.76,383 crore respectively. Thus, in the\ncurrent year, the net receipt for every rupee of borrowing will be only 65 paise. Yet another\nconsequence of larger borrowings is the substantial increase in interest payments which will\ntouch Rs.1,01,266 crore in 2000-01.  Interest payments in 1990-91 were only Rs.21,498\ncrore.\n13.The lar ge  borrowing programmes of Government year after year have also put\npressure on the absorptive capacity of the market.  The banking system now holds\ngovernment securities of around 34.3 per cent of its net demand and time liabilities as against\na minimum statutory requirement of 25 per cent.  In terms of volume, the holdings above the\nStatutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) amounted to about Rs.85,000 crore, which is higher than the\nlast year\u2019s  net borrowings.\n14.The overall monetary management has also become much more complex now than\nwas the case a few years ago.  The last year\u2019s positive outcome was partly due to the fact that\nthe economy was in a phase of business cycle when there was no problem of excess demand\nor emerging inflationary pressures.  If the economy were characterised by excess demand and\nliquidity pressures, it would have been difficult to meet the large borrowing requirements of\ngovernment without a sharp increase in interest rates and some crowding out of private\ninvestments. Under those circumstances, the economy could have slipped into a vicious circle\nof tight liquidity and  high interest rates. It is of utmost importance that such an eventuality is\navoided by taking credible fiscal action urgently. A national consensus on an effective and\ntime bound programme of fiscal correction is, therefore,  essential so that efforts made in this\ndirection in the Union Budget for 2000-01 can be further intensified.\nExternal Developments\n15.A notable development affecting India\u2019s balance of payments  during the year was the\nsharp increase in prices of crude oil and petroleum products.  In the last 16 months, crude oil\nprices increased by around 150 per cent from US $ 10-11 per barrel during January 1999 to\nabout US $ 25 per barrel during most part of March 2000. Following the recent decision of\nOPEC to increase production, oil prices have declined to around US $ 20-21 per barrel in\nApril 2000.4\n16.The impact on oil import bill, due to increase in the prices of oil, is estimated to be US\n$ 12 billion during the year 1999-2000.  Fortunately, the increase in oil import bill was\nabsorbed without an undue pressure in the overall current account deficit.  The current\naccount deficit is likely to be around 1.0 per cent of the GDP in 1999-2000, i.e., the same\nlevel as in the previous year.  The relatively low current account deficit was made possible by\na turnaround in exports, lower growth of non-oil imports and continued buoyancy in invisible\nreceipts. After taking into account the recent changes in oil prices as well as changes in\nEXIM policy, the current account deficit in the year 2000-2001 is still expected to be well\nbelow 2 per cent of GDP.\n17.Developments in respect of both the exchange rate of the rupee as well as movements\nin foreign exchange reserves were also satisfactory.  At the end of March 2000, the foreign\ncurrency assets of the country were higher by US $5.54 billion compared with a year ago, and\nreached the highest level of US $ 35.06 billion.  Foreign exchange reserves, including gold\nand SDRs, were also at their highest (US $ 38.04 billion), and showed an increase of US $\n5.55 billion during the course of the year. Net reserves, after taking into account forward\nliabilities, increased by US $ 5.67 billion over the year.\n18.Following t he East-Asian crisis and subsequent developments in certain other\ncountries, an appropriate policy for management of foreign exchange reserves in emerging\neconomies has figured prominently on the international agenda.  India is a member of various\ninternational groups where discussions on the international financial architecture and related\nissues are currently in progress (e.g., the International Monetary and Financial Committee at\nthe IMF, the Bank for International Settlements, the Group of 20, and Working Groups set up\nby the Financial Stability Forum, etc.). It is now widely agreed that in judging the adequacy\nof reserves in emerging economies, it is not enough to relate the size of reserves to the\nquantum of merchandise imports or the size of the current account deficit.  In view of the\nimportance  of capital flows, and associated volatility of such flows, it has become\nincreasingly important to take into account the composition of capital flows, particularly\nshort-term external liabilities, in judging the adequacy or otherwise of foreign exchange\nreserves.  An additional factor which has to be built into this assessment is the need to take\ninto account certain contingencies, such as, unanticipated increase in commodity/asset prices.\n19.The recent in ternational experience, particularly during the period of the East Asian\ncrisis, also highlighted the fact that the emerging economies have to largely rely on their own\nresources during external exigencies as there is no \u201clender of the last resort\u201d to provide\nadditional liquidity at short notice.  While the International Monetary Fund and the World\nBank did their best to arrange rescue packages and provided financial assistance to the\naffected economies, the agreement on conditionality packages necessarily took some time\nand their implementation posed further difficult challenges for the policy makers. The\ncontent, size and the speed with which these programmes could be approved also varied from\ncountry to country depending on the strength of political support by industrialised countries,\nwhich are the major shareholders of the international financial institutions.\n20.The overall approach to the management of India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves  has\nreflected the changing composition of balance of payments, and has endeavoured to reflect\nthe \u201cliquidity risks\u201d associated with different types of flows and other requirements.  The\npolicy for reserve management is thus judiciously built upon a host of identifiable factors and\nother contingencies.  Such factors inter alia  include:  the size of the current account deficit;5\nthe size of short-term liabilities (including current repayment obligations on long-term loans);\nthe possible variability in portfolio investments and other types of capital flows; the\nunanticipated pressures on the balance of payments arising out of external shocks (such as,\nthe impact of the East Asian crisis in 1997-98 or increase in oil prices in 1999-2000); and\nmovements in the repatriable foreign currency deposits of Non-Resident Indians.\n21.The movements in India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves in recent years has kept pace\nwith our requirements on trade as well as capital account. The strength of the foreign\nexchange reserves has also been a positive factor in facilitating flow of portfolio investments\nby FIIs and in reducing the \u2018risk\u2019 premium on foreign borrowings and Global Depository\nReceipts (GDR)/American Depository Receipts (ADR) issued by Indian corporates.\nHowever, there can be no room for complacency.  Unanticipated domestic or external\ndevelopments, including undue volatility in asset prices in equity/bond markets, can create\ndisproportionate pressures in the foreign exchange market in emerging economies. It is,\ntherefore, essential to continue with the pursuit of realistic and credible exchange rate\npolicies, in addition to vigorous implementation of domestic and external sector reforms  to\nfurther strengthen the balance of payments position over the medium term.  It is also\nnecessary to ensure that, leaving aside short term variations in levels, the quantum of reserves\nin the long run is in line with the growth in the economy and the size of risk-adjusted capital\nflows. This will provide us with necessary security against unfavourable or unanticipated\ndevelopments.\n22.The day-to-day movements in exchange rates are market determined.  The primary\nobjective of the Reserve Bank in regard to the management of the exchange rate continues to\nbe the maintenance of orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market, meeting temporary\nsupply-demand gaps which may arise due to uncertainties or other reasons, and curbing\ndestabilising and self-fulfilling speculative activities.  To this end, as in the past, the Reserve\nBank will continue to monitor closely the developments in the financial markets at home and\nabroad, and take such measures as it considers necessary from time to time.\n23.Exports, particularly software exports (which technically form part of the invisible\nreceipts in the balance of payments statistics) have done well during the year.  In the interest\nof balance of payments viability, this momentum must be kept up.  In the past 18 months,\nseveral measures were introduced to ensure timely delivery of credit to exporters and remove\nprocedural hassles.  These measures included provision of \u2018On Line credit\u2019 to exporters,\nextension of \u2018Line of Credit\u2019 for longer duration for exporters with good track record,\npeak/non-peak credit facilities to exporters, permission for interchangeability of pre-shipment\nand post-shipment credit and meeting the term loan requirements of exporters for expansion\nof capacity and modernisation of machinery and upgradation of technology.  Improvements\nwere also made in the procedure for handling of export documents and fast track clearance of\nexport credit at specialised branches of banks. Similarly, new simplified guidelines were\nissued for sanction of credit facilities for software services, project services and software\nproducts and packages.\n24.In order to ensure that the above procedural and o ther improvements in the credit\ndelivery system are actually reaching the exporters, the Reserve Bank had also set up a\nBankers\u2019 Group at the operational level (comprising senior officials from commercial banks\nand the Reserve Bank).  The Group has held a number of inter-active sessions with exporters\nas also base-level officials of the commercial banks at 21 major export centres in the country\nin addition to discussions with industry associations. So far, the feedback received from this6\nexercise is highly positive. In order to further improve the credit delivery system, the Reserve\nBank would now like to invite exporters, particularly those who are located in non-\nmetropolitan centres, to send their reactions on whether the new systems are working\nsatisfactorily.  They may also send their suggestions for improvement in procedures,\nparticularly those which are designed to reduce paper work without diluting accountability.\nExporters\u2019 responses can be sent directly to the RBI by post or by e-mail at\nexportsreview@rbi.org.in   by end of June 2000.  On the basis of responses received, the\nBankers\u2019 Group will be advised to formulate a programme of action to further improve the\ncredit delivery system.\n25.Over the past  two years, the Reserve Bank has also introduced several new facilities\nfor Non-resident Indians (NRIs).  The overall objective is to make financial transactions in\nand out of India by NRIs as flexible and easy as possible, and to reduce the need for seeking\nindividual or specific permission from the Reserve Bank.  Thus, general permission has\nalready been issued for opening of different types of bank accounts, transactions in shares,\nsecurities and debentures, and portfolio and direct investments, etc.  As in the case of\nexporters, NRIs are also requested to send in their responses on whether the facilities and\nprocedures are working satisfactorily.  They may also send their further suggestions for\nimprovement in these facilities. Their views/suggestions may also be sent by e-mail at\nnrireview@rbi.org.in  by the end of June 2000. Further action to improve the facilities will\nbe taken by the Reserve Bank, in consultation with the Government, wherever necessary.\n26.Recently, the Government has substantially expanded the automatic route for Foreign\nDirect Investment (FDI).  RBI has already granted general permission to the Indian\ncompanies to receive funds and issue shares to their foreign collaborators. No specific\napproval of Reserve Bank is required for such investments. The same benefit has also been\nextended to all cases of foreign investment approved by the Foreign Investment Promotion\nBoard (FIPB).  The above facilities are subject to filing a post-facto report by the recipient\ncompany with the Regional Offices of the RBI within 30 days of the issue of shares to\nforeign collaborators.  All companies are requested to comply with this requirement.\n27.In January, 2000  general permission was granted to Indian compan ies for issue of\nADRs and GDRs without any value limits.  Accordingly, Indian corporates can now freely\nutilise up to 50 per cent of such ADRs/GDRs for overseas investments subject only to post\nfacto reporting  to the Reserve Bank.  In addition, companies in IT & entertainment software\nand certain other knowledge-based sectors have been granted further facilities for overseas\nacquisition  without requiring prior permission of the Government or the Reserve Bank.\nThese facilities provide for acquisitions allowed by issue of ADRs/GDRs on stock swap basis\nup to a value limit of 10 times the export earnings of the Indian company in the previous\nyear, or up to U.S. $ 100 million (without reference to the level of actual exports).  It is also\nopen to Indian companies to apply to the Reserve Bank for approval of any overseas\ninvestment or acquisition proposals which do not fall within the above parameters.  It is\nhoped that these facilities would provide sufficient scope for expansion of internationally\ncompetitive Indian enterprises at the global level.7\nII. Stance of Monetary Policy for 2000-2001\n28.Against the background of the developments in the economy last year and economic\nprospects during 2000-2001 an important objective of monetary policy in the current year is\nto provide sufficient credit for growth while ensuring that there is no emergence of\ninflationary pressures  on this account. On current assessment, the prospects for achieving\nthese objectives look reasonably promising.  Notwithstanding the sharp increase in oil prices,\nthe international inflationary environment continues to be reasonably benign.  A freer trade\nregime, combined with a high level of food stocks and a high level of foreign exchange\nreserves, should provide sufficient scope for effective supply management during the year.\nOn the demand side, the budget stance of reining in the overall fiscal deficit is welcome.\nSome allowance, however, has to be made for the fact that there has been considerable delay\nin the adjustment of important administered prices, including prices of petroleum products.\nHowever, such adjustments cannot be avoided if fiscal deficit has to be kept under reasonable\ncontrol in order to keep potential inflationary pressures under check and future expectations\nfavourable.\n29.Keeping the above considerations in view, the Reserve Bank proposes to continue the\ncurrent stance of monetary policy and ensure that all legitimate requirements for bank credit\nare met while guarding against any emergence of inflationary pressures due to excess\ndemand.  Towards this objective, the Reserve Bank will continue its policy of active\nmanagement of liquidity through OMO, including two-way sale/purchase of treasury bills,\nand reduction in cash reserve ratio as and when required.\n30.In line with the continuing overall stance of policy, at the beginning of the new\nfinancial year on April 1, 2000, the RBI announced a number of measures to enhance\nliquidity and reduce the cost of funds to banks.  These measures were :\n(i) A reduction in the Bank Rate by 1.0 percentage point;\n(ii) A reduction in CRR by 1.0 percentage point in two stages;\n(iii) A reduction in Repo Rate by 1.0 percentage point; and\n(iv) A reduction in savings deposit rate of scheduled commercial\nbanks from 4.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent.\nFollowing the above measures most public sector banks have also announced a reduction in\ntheir lending and deposit rates.  For major banks, deposit rates have been reduced by 0.50 to\n1.00 percentage point depending on maturity and prime lending rates have been reduced by\n0.50 to 0.75 percentage point.  In March 1999 also, banks had effected similar reductions in\nthe PLR. Taking these changes in the PLR into account, the prime lending rate of the largest\nbank (i.e., the State Bank of India) was lower by 1.75 percentage point on April 3, 2000\ncompared with end-February, 1999.\n31.For purposes of monetary policy formulation on the basis of current trends, growth in\nreal GDP may be placed at 6.5 to 7.0 per cent in 2000-2001, assuming a normal agricultural\ncrop and continued improvement in industrial performance.  Assuming the rate of inflation to\nbe around 4.5 per cent (i.e., close to the average of last two years),  the projected  expansion\nin M3 for 2000-2001 is about 15.0 per cent.  This order of growth in M 3 should lead to an\nincrease in aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks by about 15.5 per cent (or\nRs.1,25,000 crore).  Non-food bank credit adjusted for investments in commercial paper,\nshares/debentures/bonds to PSUs and private corporate sector is projected to increase by8\naround 16.0 per cent.  This is expected to be adequate to meet the credit needs of the\nproductive sectors of the economy.\n32.However, it cannot be over-emphasised that the above outlook can change\ndramatically within a relatively short period of time in the event of unanticipated domestic or\ninternational events. Several unfavourable events that affected the outlook for the economy\nduring the years 1997 through 1999 point to the need to respond quickly and to change\ncourse, if and when required.  In the past 3 weeks, even after eliminating the effect of the\nchange in the base year of the Wholesale Price Index, the inflation rate has been  somewhat\nrising.  Some States have also been affected by severe droughts. On the inflation front,\ntherefore, there is need for continuous vigilance and caution.  The Reserve Bank will\ncontinue to monitor domestic monetary and external developments, and tighten monetary\npolicy through the use of instruments at its disposal, when necessary and unavoidable. Banks\nand other financial institutions should make adequate allowances for unforeseen\ncontingencies in their business operational plans, and take into account the implications of\nchanges in the monetary and external environment on their operations.\n33.Based on the experience of some industrialised countries, there is a view that, in India\nalso, monetary policy, to be transparent and credible, should have an explicit narrowly\ndefined objective like an inflation mandate or target.  While technically this appears to be a\nsound proposition, there are several constraints in the Indian context in pursuing a single\nobjective.  First, there is still fiscal dominance  and the debt management function gets\ninextricably linked with the monetary management function while steering the interest rates.\nIf the two functions, (i.e., monetary management and debt management) were to be separated\nas has also been suggested by some experts, it is almost certain that the prevailing interest\nrates in the market would be substantially higher than considered desirable from monetary\nstability and/or growth points of view.  The last year\u2019s experience in our ability to maintain a\nsofter interest rate environment, during a period of low inflation, while at the same time\nmeeting large government borrowing requirements, confirms this view.  Secondly, in the\nabsence of fully integrated financial markets, which remain still imperfect and segmented, the\ntransmission channel of policy is rather weak and yet to evolve fully.  Thirdly, the high\nfrequency data requirements including those on a fully dependable inflation rate for targeting\npurposes are yet to be met. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to carefully measure\nand balance between possible outcomes, after taking into account movements in a variety of\nmonetary and other indicators.\n34.It may be recalled that during the last 2 \u00bd years, the Bank Rate, Repo Rate and CRR\nhave been used in conjunction with OMO and other operations bearing on liquidity to meet\nshort-term monetary policy objectives in the light of emerging domestic and external\nsituations.  The Bank Rate and short-term repo rate announced by the RBI have been\nperceived by the markets as signals for direction in market rates of interest, in particular the\ncall money rates.  The active debt management, combining private placements and\ndistribution of securities through open market sales at convenient intervals and activating the\nOMO window for Treasury bills, has helped in keeping the short-term liquidity  situation\nreasonably comfortable during the year  without causing undue pressure on security prices.\n35.While there has been a significant softening of interest rates in the last 13 months,  the\ndecline in nominal interest rates has not kept pace with the decline in the rate of inflation.\nUnder the circumstances, there has been some debate in the country on the need to bring\nnominal interest rates down sharply so that real interest rates would move down9\ncorrespondingly. If this  happens, it is argued, industrial growth could be accelerated further\nand India\u2019s competitiveness abroad would improve. At the same time, it has to be recognised\nthat there are several structural factors which constrain downward flexibility in the interest\nrate structure in India.  The mid-term review of the Monetary and Credit Policy in October\n1999 had dealt with some of these structural rigidities.  In view of the interest in the subject,\nand also significant decisions taken recently to reduce some of the administered interest rates\nand abolish the interest tax, it may be useful to revisit this matter again.\n36.It needs to be  reiterated that the prime lending rates of banks for commercial credit\nare entirely within the purview of the banks and are not set by the Reserve Bank.  The\ndomestic interest rates which are subject to regulation are only the rate of interest on savings\naccounts and rates of interest on export credit and credit for small and tiny sectors, including\nDRI schemes, up to an amount of Rs.2 lakh. It is interesting to note that several key rates\nfixed by RBI, i.e., the Bank Rate, Repo Rate and the rate on savings account have already\ncome down  substantially (to 7.0 per cent, 5.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent, respectively). At the\npresent levels, these rates are not too  out of line with ruling international rates.\n37.Decisions in regard to interest rates on bank credit have to be taken by banks\nthemselves in the light of various factors, including their own cost of funds, their transaction\ncosts, and interest rates ruling in the non-banking sector. It is interesting to note that, even\nafter reduction in several administered rates, the post tax return on deposits being provided by\nbanks is considerably lower than the prevailing rates on contractual  savings like Provident\nFund, as well as National Savings Scheme. The interest rate, subject to tax, on 3-yearly\ndeposits is currently 9.5 per cent as compared with 11 per cent for National Savings Scheme\nand Provident Fund (which, of course, have longer maturity and are also less liquid).\n38.Banks have been given freedom to offer variable interest rates on longer-term\ndeposits.  However, partly due to historical reasons and partly due to strong preference of\ndepositors (for example, fixed-income groups and retirees), banks have continued to offer\nfixed interest rates on relatively long-term deposits. The effect of this practice is to reduce the\nflexibility that banks have in lowering their lending rates since the rates on the existing stock\nof deposits cannot be lowered.  (For example, in respect of one of the large public sector\nbanks, it is estimated that 80 per cent of time deposits are  longer than 1 year.  Even though\nthe rates of interest for maturities of one year and above are currently in the range of 8.00 to\n9.50 per cent, the effective rate of interest for the outstanding deposits of maturities above\none year is as high as 11 per cent.)\n39.Another factor affecting the interest rate structure in India is the high level of non-\ninterest operating expenses of public sector banks.  These work out to 2.5 to 3 per cent of\ntotal assets.  The high transaction costs which generally reflect high staff costs, combined\nwith relatively high levels of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), further constrain the\nmanoeuvrability in respect of lending rates.\n40.Against the above background, it is clear that, while much greater flexibility in the\nstructure of interest rates in tune with changes in the inflationary environment is desirable ,\nthere is no \u201cquick fix\u201d solution to engineer a sharp fall in nominal deposit and lending rates\nof banks. Vigorous action has to be taken by banks to reduce their transaction costs and the\nvolume of NPAs, and improve risk management.  This requires action in a number of areas,\nincluding legal reforms for recovery of dues and restructuring of weak banks. Concerted\naction is also required to move forward with financial reforms in a competitive environment10\ncoupled with a reduction in Government\u2019s fiscal deficit and wider public acceptance of the\nneed for flexibility in administered interest rates.11\nIII. Financial Sector Reforms and\nMonetary Policy Measures\n41.The recent annual Monetary and Credit Policy Statements in April, as well as mid-\nterm reviews in October, have focused on \u2018structural measures\u2019 to strengthen the financial\nsystem and to improve the functioning of the various segments of financial markets.  The\nmain objectives of these measures have been five-fold: (a) to increase operational\neffectiveness of monetary policy by broadening and deepening money market and bond\nmarket, especially the government securities market; (b) to redefine the regulatory role of the\nReserve Bank; an attempt has been made to reduce RBI\u2019s direct role in fixing interest rates,\nmargins and credit allocations, while simultaneously strengthening its role in the\ndevelopment of financial markets and the management of overall liquidity in the system; (c)\nto strengthen prudential and supervisory norms, while at the same time providing banks and\nfinancial institutions maximum autonomy in operational matters; (d) to improve the credit\ndelivery system, particularly for agriculture, exports, services, small-scale industries, self-\nhelp groups and micro-credit institutions; and (e) to develop the technological and\ninstitutional infrastructure for an efficient financial sector.\n42.While there has been substantial progress in achieving some of these objectives, the\npace of progress has been relatively slow in certain areas.  Thus, for example, considerable\nsuccess has been achieved in redefining the role of the Reserve Bank in financial markets and\nin actively associating financial experts and intermediaries in policy formulation and its\nimplementation.  Substantial progress has also been made in the area of deregulation and\nproviding much greater autonomy to banks in operational matters.  Money market is\nfunctioning reasonably satisfactorily  with substantial volume of transactions, although it still\ncontinues to be dominated by a few operators. The secondary market for government\nsecurities has been strengthened with the emergence of a large number of Primary Dealers\n(PDs) as active participants.  Technological infrastructure in the form of Indian Financial\nNetwork (INFINET) has been put in place, and preparatory work for Real Time Gross\nSettlement System (RTGS)  and Centralised Data Base Management has been completed.\nHowever, so far, very little progress has been made in making the secondary market for\nsecurities and bonds sufficiently liquid and accessible to individuals and small investors.\nPrudential and supervisory norms have been strengthened, but there is considerable scope for\nfurther improvement in risk management and internal control procedures of banks and other\ninstitutions.  The NPA levels remain unduly high, and there is still a long way to go in\nmaking the loan recovery/settlement procedures timely and efficient.  A large number of\nmeasures have been introduced to make the credit delivery system less cumbersome and\nhassle free, but progress on the ground is slow.\n43.In this year\u2019s policy also, it is proposed to review the present position and carry\nforward the direction of financial reforms initiated in recent years, keeping in view the actual\nexperience in implementation and other relevant  developments.\nIntroduction of Liquidity Adjustment\nFacility (LAF) replacing Interim Liquidity\nAdjustment Facility (ILAF)\n44.Pursuant to the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee Report on Banking\nReforms (Narasimham Committee II), it was decided in principle, to introduce a Liquidity\nAdjustment Facility (LAF) operated through repo and reverse repos in order to set a corridor12\nfor money market interest rates.  To begin with, in April 1999, an Interim Liquidity\nAdjustment Facility (ILAF) was introduced pending further upgradation in technology and\nlegal/procedural changes to facilitate electronic transfer and settlement.\n45. The ILAF was operated through a combination of repo, export credit refinance,\ncollateralised lending facilities and OMO.  ILAF provided a mechanism for injection and\nabsorption of liquidity available to banks and PDs to overcome mismatches in supply and\ndemand from time to time.  The fortnightly average utilisation of CLF/ACLF and export\ncredit refinance facilities by banks ranged between Rs.3,180 crore and Rs.10,122 crore during\nthe year 1999-2000.  Liquidity support availed of by PDs was in the range of Rs.814 crore\nand Rs.7,406 crore during the above period.\n46.The ILAF has served its purpose as a transitional measure for providing reasona ble\naccess to liquid funds at set rates of interest.  In view of the experience gained in operating\nthe interim scheme last year, an Internal Group was set up by RBI to consider further steps to\nbe taken. Following the recommendation of the Internal Group, it has now been decided to\nproceed with the implementation of a full-fledged LAF.  The new scheme will be introduced\nprogressively in convenient stages in order to ensure smooth transition.\n\u2022 In the first stage, with effect from June 5, 2000, the Additional CLF and level\nII support to PDs will be replaced by  variable rate repo  auctions with same day\nsettlement.\n\u2022 In the second stage, the effective date for which will be decided in\nconsultation with banks and PDs, CLF and level I liquidity support will also be\nreplaced by variable rate repo  auctions. Some minimum liquidity support to PDs will\nbe continued but at interest rate linked to variable rate in the daily repos auctions as\ndetermined by RBI from time to time.\n\u2022 With full computerisation of Public Debt Office (PDO) and introduction of\nRTGS expected to be in place by the end of the current year, in the third stage, repo\noperations through electronic transfers will be introduced.  In the final stage, it will be\npossible to operate LAF at different timings of the same day.\n47.In the proposed LAF, the quantum of adjustment as also the rates would be flexible,\nresponding immediately to the needs of the system.  At the same time, funds made available\nby the RBI through this facility would meet primarily the day-to-day liquidity mismatches in\nthe system and not the normal financing requirements of eligible institutions.  It is expected\nthat the LAF would also help the short-term money market interest rates to move within a\ncorridor and impart greater stability, facilitating emergence of a short-term rupee yield curve.\nBoth the time-table and the scope of proposed changes are, however,  subject to review in the\nlight of actual experience.\n48.There will be no change in the export credit refinance s cheme. This will continue as\nbefore and as such banks will be entitled to automatic access for export refinance as per\npresent policy.  Ideally, it would also be desirable for export credit refinance to be subsumed\nin the LAF for effectiveness of monetary policy.  However, under the present circumstances,\ngiven certain domestic rigidities in the interest rate structure and the desirability of giving\nmaximum support to exporters, there is a case for  the scheme of export credit refinance to\ncontinue for some more time.  It would be possible to do away with sector-specific refinance,13\nlike export credit refinance facility, when domestic interest rates in nominal and real terms\nconverge with international rates  on a sustainable basis.\nDevelopment of Financial Markets\n49.In an effort to carry forward the reforms towards widening and deepening of the\nfinancial markets, the following measures are being introduced for further development of the\nmarkets :\n(a)  Money Market\n\u2022 Forward Rate Agreements and Interest Rate Swaps were formally introduced\nin 1999.  The guidelines had indicated that the rate on any domestic money or debt\nmarket instrument can be used as the benchmark.  In order to provide more flexibility\nfor pricing of rupee interest rate derivatives and to facilitate some integration between\nmoney and foreign exchange markets, the use of \u2018interest rates implied in the foreign\nexchange forward market\u2019 as a benchmark would be permitted in addition to the\nexisting domestic money and debt market rates.\n\u2022 At present, the minimum maturity for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) is 3\nmonths.  To bring it on par with other instruments such as CP and  term deposits, the\nminimum maturity of CDs is being  reduced to 15 days.  Incidentally, the minimum\nperiod of transferability for CDs has already been reduced to 15 days.\n\u2022 It was indicated in the \u2018Mid-Term Review\u2019 of October 1999 that permission\ngiven to non-bank entities for routing their transactions in call/notice money market\nthrough PDs will be  withdrawn by end-June 2000.  It has been decided that the\nfacility to non-bank entities for routing transactions through PDs would be further\nextended up to end-December 2000 and simultaneously steps will be initiated to\nextend repo facility to such entities through Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) II\nAccounts.\n\u2022 It was indicated in the \u2018Mid-Term Review' of October 1998 that, in line  with\nthe suggestion of the Narasimham Committee II, the Reserve Bank ultimately aims to\nmove towards a pure inter-bank (including PDs) call/notice money market.\nSubsequent to the amendment of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA)\n1956, the repo market has been widened to cover all such non-bank entities holding\nboth current and SGL Accounts with RBI, Mumbai, including mutual funds.  These\nentities can now borrow as well as lend in the repo market. Hence, it is proposed to\nreview and evolve a time bound programme of withdrawing permission to these\nentities for lending in the call/notice money market, coinciding with development of\nrepo market.\n\u2022 To keep pace with several developments in financial markets, the current\nguidelines for issue of CPs were reviewed by an Internal Group. It has been decided\nto modify the guidelines in the light of Group\u2019s recommendations.  The modified draft\nguidelines would cover aspects such as, greater flexibility to the issuers to raise CP\nthrough introduction of an automatic route for CP issuance, broadening the investor-\nbase, simplification of procedures for issuing CP, permission to issue CP in\ndematerialised form and standardisation of documentation procedures.  These14\nmeasures are expected to provide more liquidity and depth to the product. A draft of\nthe revised guidelines would be circulated separately and final guidelines would be\nissued after consultation with market participants.\n\u2022 As per the RBI Act 1934, CRR is to be maintained on an average daily basis\nduring a reporting fortnight by all scheduled banks.  This system provides\nmanoeuvrability to banks to adjust their cash reserves on a daily basis depending upon\nintra-fortnight variations in cash flows.  For the computation of CRR to be maintained\nduring the fortnight, a lagged reserve system has been introduced effective fortnight\nbeginning November 6,1999 whereby banks have to maintain CRR on the  net\ndemand and time liabilities (NDTL) of the second preceding fortnight. With this,\nbanks are able to assess their exact liability positions and the corresponding reserve\nrequirements.   With a view to providing further flexibility to banks and enabling\nthem to choose an optimum strategy of holding reserves depending upon their intra-\nperiod cash flows, it has been decided to reduce the requirement of a minimum of 85\nper cent of the CRR balances to be maintained to 65 per cent  with effect from the\nfortnight beginning May 6, 2000.  This is expected to result in smoother adjustment of\nliquidity between surplus and deficit units and enable better cash management by\nbanks.\n(b)  Government Securities Market\n(i)  Amendments to  Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956\n50.In terms of notification issued under Section 16 of the Securities Contracts\n(Regulation) Act, 1956 and under the amended Section 29A of the Act, Government of India\nhas delegated regulatory powers to RBI to regulate dealings in Government securities, money\nmarket securities, gold related securities and securities derived from these securities as also\nready forward contracts in debt securities, vide notification dated March 1, 2000.  Consequent\nupon the delegation of powers by the Government and as part of development of the repo\nmarket, State Government securities have been made eligible for undertaking repos.  RBI has\nalso widened the scope of participation in the repo market to all the entities having SGL and\nCurrent Account with RBI, Mumbai, thus increasing the number of eligible non-bank\nparticipants to 64 from the earlier 35.  These measures are expected to give a fillip to the repo\nmarket besides enabling better cash and asset-liability management by non-bank institutions.\n(ii)  Special Facility for Securities Settlement\n51.RBI operates the government securities settlement system for those having SGL\nAccounts in the Public Debt Office through Delivery versus Payment.   Under this system,\ntrades are settled on a gross \u201ctrade by trade\u201d basis with irrevocable final settlement taking\nplace simultaneously for securities and funds after ensuring that there is sufficient funds in\nbuyer\u2019s account and sufficient securities in seller\u2019s account. In view of increased volumes in\ntransactions, it is proposed to introduce a scheme for automatic invocation by the SGL\nAccount holder of undrawn refinance/liquidity support from RBI for facilitating smooth\nsecurities settlement.  The facility will be available only to banks and PDs, subject to\nadequate safeguards. Detailed guidelines will be issued separately.15\n(iii)  Sale of Securities Allotted in Primary Issues on the same day\n52.In terms of the guidelines issued by RBI, no sale deal should be entered into without\nactually  having the securities in the investment portfolio at the time of sale. This procedure is\ninhibiting entities which get allotments in primary issues from selling securities allotted, on\nthe same day.  Hence, it has been decided to remove such restriction and allow such entities\nto sell the securities after they have been allotted to them, thus enabling sale, settlement and\ntransfer on the same day.\n(iv)  Payments for Treasury Bills\n53.At present auctions in respect of 14 and 91 day Treasury Bills are normally held on\nFridays and payments in respect of allotments made on Saturdays. Considering the request\nfrom the market participants,  the day of payment has been changed from Saturday to the next\nworking day in respect of both 14 and 91 day Treasury Bills.  This will be reviewed after six\nmonths.\n(v)  Operations of Primary Dealers\n54.Under the existing scheme, the liquidity support to PDs is linked to their bidding\ncommitments and secondary market operations and are provided at level I at the Bank Rate\nand at level II at 2 per cent above the Bank Rate.  As level II will be discontinued with the\nintroduction of LAF, a detailed review of liquidity support to PDs will be made and\nmodifications will be introduced in consultation with PDs.\n55.The minimum bidding commitment by PDs cover more than 100 per cent of the\nauction issue of Treasury Bills and the PDs are not required to take devolvement.  OMO\nwindow for Treasury Bills with exclusive access to PDs has also been opened.   In view of\nthese developments, the commission payment to PDs for auction Treasury Bills is being\nwithdrawn.\n56.Currently, the capital adequacy requirements for PDs for credit risk are based on the\nsame norms as applicable to NBFCs.  For market risk, separate requirements have been given\nin the \u201cGuidelines for the PDs in the Government Securities Market\u201d.  As these do not still\nadequately address the risks being faced by the PDs in the market, comprehensive capital\ncharges on the portfolio risks are considered essential.  Taking into account the principles for\ncapital adequacy for market risk evolved by regulatory bodies such as the International\nOrganisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the Bank for International Settlements\n(BIS), fresh guidelines for capital adequacy standards for PDs are being evolved, which will\nbe finalised in consultation with PDs.\n(c)  Debt Securities Clearing Corporation\n57.A mention was made in the Mid Term Review of October 1999  about the setting up\nof a clearing corporation for money and debt securities.  This is expected, inter alia,  to pave\nthe way for further opening up of the repo market to PSU bonds and bonds of Financial\nInstitutions held in demat form in depositories.  A preliminary proposal to set up such a\ncorporation has already been received from the PDs and action to establish such a corporation\nis being initiated.16\nBanks\u2019 entry into Insurance Business\n58.With the passage of the Insurance Regulatory and Develo pment Authority (IRDA)\nAct, 1999, banks can enter into insurance business.  The insurance business does not break-\neven during the initial years of operation.  Banks do not also have adequate actuarial and\ntechnical expertise in undertaking insurance business. It is, therefore, necessary to restrict\nentry only to strong banks in insurance sector on risk participation basis.  Consequently,\nbanks having minimum net worth of Rs.500 crore, and satisfying other criteria in regard to\ncapital adequacy, profitability, etc., will be allowed to undertake insurance business through\njoint venture on risk participation basis.  RBI  will consider bank\u2019s equity contribution in the\njoint venture up to 50 per cent.  However, higher equity contribution by a promoter bank may\nbe allowed initially, on a highly selective basis, pending divestment of the equity in excess of\n50 per cent within the period prescribed under the amended insurance statutes. Banks which\ndo not satisfy the above criteria will be allowed on a \u2018without risk participation\u2019 basis up to\n10 per cent of their net worth or Rs.50 crore, whichever is lower, as strategic investors.\nThere will, however, be no bar on any bank or its subsidiary taking up distribution of\ninsurance products on fee basis as an agent of insurance company.  Banks will be required to\nobtain prior approval of RBI for entering into the insurance area.    Detailed guidelines are in\nAnnexure II.\nInterest Rate Policy\n59.With progressive deregulation of interest rates, banks now have considerable\nflexibility to decide their deposit and lending rate structures and manage their assets and\nliabilities efficiently.  Banks are now free to offer a fixed rate or a floating rate on deposits of\nany maturity of 15 days and above.  On the lending side, banks are free to prescribe their own\nlending  rates including the Prime Lending Rate (PLR).  Further, banks have been given the\nfreedom to offer tenor-linked PLRs and fixed rate loans.  Certain specified categories of\nadvances have been freed from the norms of PLR.  After consultation with banks, with the\nobjective of  providing more operational flexibility and eliminating rigidities, the following\nmeasures are being introduced:\n(a)  Review of PLR norms\n(i)   Tenor-Linked PLR\n60.Banks have been provided the freedom to operate different PLRs for different\nmaturities. It is observed that some banks are declaring a stand alone PLR in addition to tenor\nlinked PLRs.  Banks which have moved over to declaration of tenor-linked PLRs should\nalways indicate the specific tenor for which the declared PLRs is applicable.\n(ii)  Fixed Rate Loans\n61.Currently, banks are permitted to offer fixed interest rates only when the loan is for\nproject finance purposes.  The restriction on fixed rate term loans being extended only for\nproject loan is now being withdrawn. Banks will henceforth have the freedom to offer all\nloans on fixed or floating rates.  However, banks will have to ensure that the PLR stipulations\nas applicable are complied with.  The nature of alignment with PLR will have to be made\nexplicit at the time of sanction of the loan.  However, for small loans up to Rs.2 lakh, the\nstipulation of not exceeding PLR (of relevant maturity) will be applicable.17\n(b)  FCNR (B) Deposits: Greater Flexibility of Operations\n62.At present, in the case of FCNR (B) deposits offered by banks, swap rates as on the\nlast working day of the preceding week form the base for fixing the ceiling rates for the\ninterest rates that are effective the following week.  In order to make the market more\n\u201conline\u201d, banks at their discretion will have the option to choose the current swap rates while\noffering FCNR (B) deposits.  This will provide banks with  the freedom to refer to the swap\nrates quoted on any online screen based information system.\n63.Presently, banks are free to offer fixed/floating rates on NRE/FCNR(B) deposits. It\nhas been decided that banks would be permitted as in the case of domestic term deposits, to\noffer differential rates of interest on NRE deposits on size group basis.  In the case of\nFCNR(B) deposits where  the interest rates offered are subject to a ceiling rate, the\ndifferential rates on size group basis  would be permitted within the overall ceiling\nprescribed.  This flexibility is expected to help banks to reduce their overall cost of deposits.\n(c) Resource Mobilisation by all-India Financial\nInstitutions \u2013 Greater Flexibility\n64.As per existing stipulations, all-India Financial Institutions (FIs) are allowed to\nborrow in the term money market, through CDs, term deposits and Inter-corporate Deposits\n(ICDs) within the umbrella limit equal to their net owned funds.  The interest rate on term\ndeposits offered by financial institutions is subject to a ceiling of  'not exceeding  14.0 per\ncent per annum' and furthermore financial institutions have to ensure that the interest rates\noffered by them do not exceed the rates offered by SBI for comparable maturities.  As\nfinancial institutions are free to decide interest rates on all other instruments, it has been\ndecided that they may be given flexibility in the matter of fixing interest rates also on term\ndeposits.  This will facilitate FIs using these instruments in a flexible manner for ALM.\n65.With progressive deregulation, FIs have been rais ing resources from the market by\nissuing bonds as well as through money market instruments subject to RBI regulation.  FIs\nare permitted to issue bonds with maturity of 5 years and above without prior RBI permission\nbut with simple registration with RBI provided the bonds are \u201cplain vanilla\u201d (i.e., without\nspecial features like options, etc.) and the interest rate on such bonds is not more than 200\nbasis points above the yield on Government of India securities of comparable residual\nmaturity at the time of issuing bonds.  All other bond issues have to be referred to the RBI for\nprior approval.  Based on a review of regulatory experience, it has been decided to modify the\nguidelines and provide more freedom and flexibility to FIs in raising resources through bond\nissues, subject to overall limits fixed in terms of net owned funds.  A draft proposal will be\ncirculated among the FIs, and guidelines will be issued after further consultation with FIs.\nLiberalisation of Export Credit Refinance Facility\n66.The facility of export credit refinance to banks enable them to fund a part of their\nexport credit without any resource constraint, particularly when the level of export credit\nexpands and liquidity conditions are relatively tight.    At present, scheduled commercial\nbanks are provided export credit refinance to the extent of 100 per cent of the increase in\noutstanding export credit eligible for refinance over the level of such credit as on February\n16, 1996.  Representations have been received from some institutions that the manner in\nwhich the export credit refinance limit is fixed under the existing  scheme precludes the use18\nof Export Bill Rediscounting Schemes by banks, which is of benefit to exporters.  It is\nproposed to liberalise the scheme  by introducing the following modification:\n\u2022 For the purpose of fixing refinance limits, the outstanding export credit\n(including export bills rediscounted with institutions like EXIM Bank and refinance\nobtained from NABARD/EXIM Bank) will form the basis which will enable banks to\nuse rediscounting of export bills without any reduction in refinance limits.\n\u2022 Drawal of refinance will be on the basis of export credit eligible for refinance,\ni.e., after excluding export bills rediscounted with other banks/EXIM Bank and\nrefinance from NABARD/EXIM Bank, Pre-shipment Credit in Foreign Currency\n(PCFC), scheme of Rediscounting of Export Bills Abroad (EBR) and overdue export\ncredit from outstanding aggregate export credit.\n67.The scheme will come into force effective fortnight beginning May 6, 2000.  With the\nrevised scheme, banks will have the benefit of rediscounting export bills with institutions like\nEXIM Bank, without sustaining reduction in refinance limits from RBI.  In the proposed\nscheme, it has also been ensured that the export credit refinance limit already available to a\nparticular bank is maintained.  Operating instructions are being issued separately.\nPost-award Clearance of Project Proposals\nfor Exports \u2013 Enhancement of Limit\n68.At present, Authorised Dealers can consider for post-award clearance in respect of\nsupply contract on deferred payment terms, turnkey projects or construction contract if the\nvalue of such contract is Rs.25 crore or less.  In the case of contract of value exceeding Rs.25\ncrore (but within Rs.100 crore or where the Authorised Dealer is unable to grant clearance for\nany reason),  Exim Bank may grant post-award clearance.  It has now been decided that the\nabove value limits for clearance for post-award proposals for ADs should be raised from\nRs.25 crore to Rs.50 crore  and that for Exim Bank from Rs.100 crore to Rs.200 crore.\nGold Deposit Scheme - Allowing Banks\nto Lend Gold to Other Nominated Banks\n69.At present, specific deployment avenues have been outlined for the gold mobilised\nunder the Gold Deposit Scheme. In order to provide more deployment avenues within the\ncountry and at the same time to exploit the synergy between the lending expertise of a few\nbanks with the vast branch net work of the others, banks are being permitted to deploy the\ngold mobilised under the Gold Deposit Scheme by lending  it to other nominated bank for\nsimilar use.\nPrudential Measures\n(a)  Risk Management Systems in Banks\n70.The Reserve Bank had issued in October 1999, comprehensive guidelines to banks to\nenable them to put in place appropriate risk management systems, covering credit risk,\nmarket risk, and operational risk. In order to control the magnitude of overall risks faced by\nbanks, they were advised to lay down, in the Loan Policy approved by their Boards,\nprudential norms among others, on exposure to single borrower, group of borrowers, industry19\nspecific exposure, exposure to sensitive sectors, etc.  A review by RBI of the action taken by\nbanks shows that most of the banks are well advanced in setting up a system for an\nappropriate assessment of risks associated with different types of assets.  This process needs\nto be further accelerated. \n71.In this connection, an issue which has received so me attention is the appropriate role\nof banks in providing financial support to individuals as well as to corporates and market\nintermediaries against the security of shares/debentures/bonds.  RBI has already issued some\nguidelines for advances against shares/units/debentures and PSU bonds, to individuals, stock\nbrokers and corporates.  However, some grey areas remain where there is need for removal of\nany ambiguities so that policy of banks for supporting the development of capital markets is\ntransparent and known to all concerned, including investors.  In order to further develop the\noperating guidelines for bank financing of equities, it is proposed to refer the matter to the\nStanding Technical Committee on Co-ordination between RBI and SEBI.  The Committee\nwill review the status and make suitable recommendations, after appropriate consultations\nwith banks and market participants.  The Committee will consider, inter alia,  the desirability\nof having an aggregate exposure ceiling for advances against security of shares as well as\nissues relating to fixing prudent level of margins on all advances (i.e., advances to\nindividuals, corporates, brokers and others) against shares and Initial Public Offers (IPOs).  A\ntransparent and stable system of bank financing, which can be sustained during periods of\n\u201cups\u201d as well as \u201cdowns\u201d in equity prices, would contribute to healthy development of\nfinancial markets, while at the same time minimising risks for banks.\n(b)  Capital Adequacy Norms for Banks\u2019 Subsidiaries\n72.At present, the balance sheets of subsidiaries of banks are neither consolidated with\nthat  of the parent bank nor have any uniform capital adequacy norm been prescribed for\nsubsidiaries.  The Basel Committee has proposed that the new capital adequacy framework\nshould be extended to include, on a fully consolidated basis, holding companies that are\nparents of banking groups.  On prudential considerations, in India also, it is necessary to\nadopt best practices in line with international standards, while duly reflecting local\nconditions.  To achieve this objective, to begin with, banks are advised to voluntarily build-in\nthe risk weighted components of their subsidiaries into their own balance sheet on notional\nbasis.  This should be  at par with the risk weights applicable to bank\u2019s own assets.  Banks\nshould also earmark additional capital in their books over a period of time so as to obviate the\npossibility of impairment to their net worth when switch over to unified balance sheet for the\ngroup as a whole is adopted after some time. The additional capital required may be provided\nin the bank\u2019s books in phases beginning from the year ending March 2001.\n(c)  New Capital Adequacy Framework\n73.In June 1999, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision had released a\nconsultative paper on 'A New Capital Adequacy Framework' for comments by interested\nparties  by  March 31, 2000.  The new  framework aims at further strengthening the\nsoundness and stability of the financial system and is designed to better align regulatory\ncapital with underlying risks faced by banks.  The framework also provides for explicit\ncapital charge for other risks, viz.,  operational risk and interest rate risk in the banking book\nfor banks where interest rate risks are significantly above average.  In view of the widespread\nimplications of the new Framework, an internal Working Group was constituted in the RBI to\nexamine its impact and applicability, likely problems in implementation and the time span20\nwithin which the Framework could be adapted to suit Indian conditions.  RBI has finalised\nand forwarded its comments on the new Framework to the Basel Committee.  These\ncomments are available on the RBI\u2019s web-site to generate wider discussion among banks,\nfinancial institutions and academia. The adoption of the new Framework, when it comes into\nforce, will have important implications for emerging market economies and will call for\nstructural changes in the current regulatory and supervisory standards.    Capital adequacy, in\nrelation to risk profile, calls for adoption of sophisticated tools for management of risks.\nBanks would, therefore, have to pay even greater attention to Risk Management Systems, and\nselection and training of personnel. The existing accounting and disclosures standards would\nalso need to be improved further to fall in line with the international best practices.\n(d)  Monitoring adherence to International\n Financial Standards and Codes\n74.Recent international discussions on building up a sound financial architecture  have\nemphasised the need for evolving codes and  standards based on recognised best practices in\nareas such as monetary and financial policies, fiscal, financial,  accounting, corporate\ngovernance and payment and settlement systems. In order to monitor developments in this\nregard and to consider various aspects relevant to India, the Reserve Bank has constituted in\nassociation with the Government of India a \u2018Standing Committee on International Financial\nStandards and Codes\u2019.   The Committee would aim at identifying and monitoring\ndevelopments in global standards and codes being evolved in the context of the international\ndevelopments and consider the applicability of these standards and codes to Indian financial\nsystem, and chalk out a road map for aligning India\u2019s standards and practices with\ninternational best practices.\n75.The Standing Committee has set up  non-official Advisory Groups in ten major\nsubject areas with outside eminent experts in concerned fields. The Groups have undertaken\na review of standards and the feasibility of the compliance and the time frame, given the\nprevailing legal and institutional practices in India.  The Standing Committee would\nundertake a periodic review of the status and progress in this regard and make available its\nreports alongwith the Reports of the Advisory Groups to all concerned organisations in\npublic and private sector for review and comments.\n(e)  Move towards Risk Based Supervision of Banks\n76.The recent years have witnessed a gradual shift towards deregulation, reinforced by\nintroduction of prudential norms and adoption of international supervisory best practices.\nConsidering the complexities of banking business and  emerging product innovations with\ncomplex risk profiles, there is a growing acceptance that a Risk Based Supervision (RBS)\napproach would be more efficient than the traditional transaction-based approach. The risk\nbased supervision approach entails the monitoring of banks by allocating supervisory\nresources and focusing supervisory attention according to the risk profile of each institution.\nThe instruments of risk based supervision will be by way of enhancements of the supervisory\ntools traditionally used, viz., off-site monitoring and on-site examination supplemented by a\nmarket intelligence mechanism. In this regard, the Reserve Bank would be engaging services\nof reputed  international consultants to draw on other countries' experiences  and to develop\nan overall plan for moving towards RBS, which would incorporate international  best\nsupervisory  practices suited for Indian conditions.21\n(f)  Non-Performing Advances (NPAs) of Banks\n77.The level of NPAs of public sector banks has been a cause for concern.   The\nGovernment of India and Reserve Bank of India have initiated a number of measures for\nexpeditious recovery of the accumulated stock of NPAs but the progress of recovery has been\nslow.  The measures include setting up of more Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs),\nstrengthening the infrastructure of DRTs, amendment to the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks\n& Financial Institutions Act as well as setting up of Settlement Advisory Committees (SACs)\nfor compromise settlement of chronic NPAs of small sector.  The guidelines on Settlement\nAdvisory Committees were aimed at reducing the stock of NPAs by encouraging the banks to\ngo in for compromise settlement in a transparent manner.  Banks will have to more\naggressively pursue the recourse to DRTs as well as compromise settlement through the\nSACs since the operation of SACs is scheduled to lapse on September 30, 2000.\n(g)  Banks\u2019 non-SLR Investments\n78.A study undertaken by RBI on the non-SLR investment portfolio of banks has caused\nsome concern, as substantial portion of such investments composed of privately placed\nunquoted securities.  With a view to ensuring that such non-SLR investments are made on\nsound prudential considerations, with more transparency and guarding against potential risks,\ndraft guidelines for banks\u2019 non-SLR investments have been evolved in consultation with\nbanks and financial institutions. These guidelines were circulated among banks and financial\ninstitutions on April 4, 2000.  The draft guidelines was also put on the RBI website for\ncomments from the general public.  Guidelines would be revised duly taking into account the\ncomments and suggestions from  banks,  financial institutions and others.  The revised\nguidelines will be recirculated before they are finalised.\nCredit Delivery Mechanisms\n79.Banks and financial  institutions have been entrusted with providing credit on\nreasonable terms to certain sectors, viz., agriculture, micro-credit institutions, small  scale\nindustries and housing.  In order to enhance the flow of credit to these sectors various steps\nhave been undertaken by the RBI.\n(a)  Micro-credit\n80.The Micro-credit Special Cell which was set up in the RBI pursuant to the Monetary\nand Credit Policy announcement in April 1999 submitted its report in January 2000.\nMeanwhile, the Task Force on Supportive Policy and Regulatory Framework for Micro\nfinance, set up by NABARD, had also submitted its report.  A circular letter was issued to\nbanks on February 18, 2000 for main-streaming micro-credit.  Banks have been advised that\nmicro- credit  extended by them to individual borrowers either directly or through any\nintermediary would be reckoned as part of their priority sector lending.   Banks have been\ngiven freedom to prescribe their own lending norms keeping in view the ground realities and\ndevise appropriate loan and savings products in this regard.  Priority should be accorded to\nthis sector in preparation of credit plans by banks.  Banks have also been advised that micro-\ncredit should form an integral part of their corporate credit plan and should be reviewed at the\nhighest level every quarter.  A revised reporting system for monitoring micro-credit\ndisbursals on a half-yearly basis has been put in place.  In view of its potential in alleviation\nof poverty, banks have to make all out efforts at provision of micro-credit.22\n(b)  Self Help Groups\n81.As annou nced in the Budget Speech for the year 2000-2001, NABARD and SIDBI\nare expected to cover an additional 1 lakh Self Help Groups (SHGs) during the current year.\nTo give a further boost to this programme, a micro finance Development Fund is proposed to\nbe created at NABARD with a start up contribution of Rs.100 crore from concerned\ninstitutions.  This fund will provide start up funds to micro finance institutions and\ninfrastructure support for training and systems management and data building.  Special\nemphasis will be placed on promotion of micro enterprises in rural areas set up by vulnerable\nsections including women, SC/STs and other backward classes.  Banks have been advised to\ncontinue their efforts at forging linkages with SHGs in their respective service areas either on\ntheir own initiative or by enlisting support of NGOs in the field, so that the national goal set\nout in the Budget announcement is met.\n(c)  Agriculture\n82.Following the Report of the Gupta Committee on Agricultural credit, a number of\nmeasures have been taken to improve credit delivery system for agriculture, such as ,  greater\nflexibility and discretion to the lending banks in matters of collateral, margin, security,\ndispensation of \u201cno dues certificates\u201d, delegation of sufficient powers to branch managers,\nintroduction of composite cash credit to cover the farmers\u2019 production requirements,\nintroduction of new loan procedures, cash disbursement of loans and simplification of\nprocedures for loan agreements.   The following further measures are now being taken:\n\u2022 At present, a ceiling of Rs.5 lakh has been prescribed for classifying advances\nfor financing distribution of inputs for the allied activities, such as cattle-feed,\npoultry-feed, etc., as indirect advances to agriculture.  It has been decided to enhance\nthe ceiling to Rs.15 lakh.\n\u2022 At present, bank finance to NBFCs for on-lending to Small Road and Water\nTransport Operators (SRWTOs) and the tiny sector of industry is reckoned under\npriority sector lending.  With a view to providing one more avenue for bank\u2019s lending\nto agriculture and increasing the outreach of banks in rural areas, it has been decided\nthat lending by banks to NBFCs for on-lending to agriculture may be reckoned for the\npurpose of priority sector lending as indirect finance to agriculture.  A circular to this\neffect has already been issued.\n(d) Drought Relief\n83.Some parts of the country have been affected by severe drought.  These drought\naffected areas have to be provided maximum support, as per RBI guidelines, for conversion\nof short-term production loans into medium-term loans, reschedulement/postponement of\nexisting term loan instalments, providing additional need-based crop loans/working capital\nand consumption loans and relaxation in security and margin norms. RBI has instructed its\nRegional Offices to remain in close contact with the State Government authorities and local\nbanks so that expeditious action is taken to provide relief. RBI has also advised the convenor\nbanks of State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) to convene the meeting of SLBC to take\nstock of the situation and initiate immediate steps for providing relief.23\n(e)  Budget follow up \u2013 the SSI Sector\n84.Following the announcements made by the recent Union Budget in respect  of the SSI\nsector, the following action has been taken :\n\u2022 The requirement of providing collateral security is a major bottleneck in the flow\nof bank credit to very small units. RBI has recently  issued instructions to dispense\nwith the collateral requirement for loans up to Rs. 1 lakh.  The limit is being further\nincreased for the tiny sector from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.5 lakh.\n\u2022 To promote credit flow to small borrowers, the composite loan limit (for\nproviding working capital and term loans through a single window) is being increased\nfrom Rs.5 lakh to Rs.10 lakh.\n\u2022 Public sector banks have been requested to accelerate their programme of SSI\nbranches to ensure that every district and SSI clusters within districts are served by at\nleast one specialised SSI bank branch.  Furthermore, to improve the quality of\nbanking services, SSI branches are being asked to obtain ISO certification.\nCircular letters have been issued to banks in respect of the above measures.\n(f)  Setting up of a Credit Information Bureau\n85.RBI had set up a Working Group to explore the possibilitie s for setting up a Credit\nInformation Bureau in India.  The Working Group submitted its Report in November, 1999.\nThe Bureau is expected to expedite credit and investment decisions by banks and financial\ninstitutions as also curb growth of fresh NPAs through better institutional mechanism. The\nState Bank of India has entered into an MoU with HDFC to set up a Credit Information\nBureau and the modalities for setting up of the Bureau in regard to ownership and equity\nparticipation, management structure, security standards, rights and liabilities of the Bureau,\netc., are currently being worked out.  The banks and financial institutions are advised  to\nmake the necessary in-house arrangement for gathering and collection of such information in\none place for transmitting it to the Bureau.\nDeposit Insurance\n86.The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is at present\nengaged in the revamping of the system of deposit insurance in pursuance of the\nrecommendations of the Advisory Group on Reforms in Deposit Insurance in India.  The\nDICGC has, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, already examined most of the\nrecommendations.  A new law, in supercession of the existing enactment, is required to be\nenacted to implement the recommendations and the task of preparation of the new draft law\nhas been taken up. The relevant proposals in this respect will be forwarded in due course to\nthe Government for consideration.\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)\n87.After the passage of the amendment  to the RBI Act on March 23, 1997, the  RBI\nreceived 37,392 applications for grant of certificate of registration.  Of these, 26,769 NBFCs\nhad net owned fund (NOF) below Rs.25 lakh till the end of 1999 and, therefore, did not fulfill\nthe primary criteria of having a minimum NOF of Rs.25 lakh, under the RBI Act. These24\nNBFCs were given three years time to reach the minimum NOF of Rs.25 lakh. As on April 1,\n2000,  as many as 7,636 NBFCs have reported to have stepped up their NOF to Rs.25 lakh or\nmore thus becoming primarily eligible for Certificate of Registration. In addition,  the Bank\nhas received 2,651 applications for extension of time.  The remaining NBFCs have neither\nreported having attained the minimum NOF of Rs.25 lakh, nor sought extension of time.  As\nper the provision in  the Act/NBFC Directions, all the remaining NBFCs with NOF of less\nthan Rs.25 lakh are not entitled to accept fresh public deposits.  These NBFCs are advised to\nstrictly adhere to the provisions of the Statute, RBI regulations and continue to repay the\nmatured deposits as per the contracted terms.\n88.Considering the heterogeneous size and geographical spread of the NBFCs, RBI is\nkeen to promote the concept of self regulatory organisation particularly for smaller NBFCs,\nand further improve  the disclosure requirements in order to instill confidence about their\nfunctioning.   The Reserve Bank also proposes to extend to the NBFCs the guidelines on\nAsset Liability Management and Risk Management after getting the views of the industry.\nThe RBI is also considering guidelines for NBFCs for their entry/participation in insurance\nbusiness.  Further, the RBI is reviewing the regulatory structure and procedures for fixing of\ninterest rates on deposits of different types of non-banking companies.\nApproach to Universal Banking\n89.The Narasimham Committee II suggested that Development Financial Institutions\n(DFIs) should convert  ultimately into either commercial banks or non-bank finance\ncompanies.  The Khan Working Group held the view that DFIs should be allowed to become\nbanks at the earliest.  The RBI released a \u2018Discussion Paper\u2019 (DP) in January 1999 for wider\npublic debate.  The feedback on the discussion paper indicated that while universal banking is\ndesirable from the point of view of efficiency of resource use, there is need for caution in\nmoving towards such a system by banks and DFIs.  Major areas requiring attention are the\nstatus of financial sector reforms, the state of preparedness of concerned institutions, the\nevolution of regulatory-regime and above all a viable transition path for  institutions which\nare desirous of moving in the direction of universal banking.  It is proposed to adopt the\nfollowing broad approach for considering proposals in this area:\n(a) The principle of \u201cUniversal Banking\u201d is a desirable goal and some progress\nhas already been made by permitting banks to diversify into investments and long-\nterm financing and the DFIs to lend for working capital, etc.  However, banks\nhave certain special characteristics and as such any dilution of RBI\u2019s prudential\nand supervisory norms for conduct of banking business would be inadvisable.\nFurther, any conglomerate, in which a bank is present, should be subject to a\nconsolidated approach to supervision and regulation.\n(b) Though the DFIs would continue to have a special role in the Indian financial\nsystem, until the debt market demonstrates substantial improvements in terms of\nliquidity and depth, any DFI, which wishes to do so, should have the option to\ntransform into bank (which it can exercise), provided the prudential norms as\napplicable to banks are fully satisfied.  To this end, a DFI would need to prepare a\ntransition path in order to fully comply with the regulatory requirement of a bank.\nThe DFI concerned may consult RBI for such transition arrangements.  Reserve\nBank will consider such requests on a case by case basis.25\n(c) The regulatory framework of RBI in respect of DFIs would need to be\nstrengthened if they are given greater access to short-te rm resources for\nmeeting their financing requirements, which is necessary.\n(d) In due course, and in the light of evolution of the financial system,\nNarasimham Committee\u2019s recommendation that, ultimately there should be only\nbanks and restructured NBFCs can be operationalised.\nHigh Power Committee on\nUrban Co-operative Banks\n90.A High Power Committee (HPC) was constituted in May 1999 under the\nChairmanship of Shri K.Madhava Rao, to review the performance of Urban Co-operative\nBanks (UCBs) and suggest necessary measures to strengthen this sector.  The terms of\nreference included reviewing  of existing bank and branch licensing policies, application of\ncapital adequacy norms and bringing in suitable legislative amendments for effective\nfunctioning of the UCBs.  The HPC submitted its recommendations to RBI on  November 30,\n1999.  The Report of the HPC has been made available for public debate, and the\nrecommendations are presently under consideration of RBI in consultation with Government.\nTechnology Upgradation\n91.The Reserve Bank has been playing a central role in the reform of the payment and\nsettlement system in the country. Much progress has been made in consolidating the existing\npayment systems, developing new technologically advanced modes of payment and moving\ntowards the ultimate objective of linking various payment and settlement systems into an\nefficient and integrated system that will function in an on-line real time environment.\n92.With the ultimate goal of  designing and developing a  mu ltiple deferred/discrete net\nsettlement system and RTGS, facilitating efficient funds management, house-keeping and\ncustomer service, the Reserve Bank has taken a number of steps to improve the infrastructure.\nThese include :\n\u2022 The development of the Payment System Generic Architecture Model for both\ndomestic and cross-border payments. The Model conceives networking of\ncomputerized bank branches, with their controlling offices, central treasury cells and\nHead Offices with the proviso for introducing standardisation of operating systems\nand networking platforms within the bank and a bank-level standardized gateway to\nINFINET.\n\u2022 A consultant has been appointed to assist in the implementation of the RTGS.\nSystem Requirement Specifications would take into account the international best\npractices and the specific requirements of Indian banking.\n\u2022 Progress is being made towards developing standards for newer payment\ninstruments such  as SMART Cards.  A  pilot project on SMART Cards has come out\nwith a set of recommendations for SMART Card standards  which have been\nforwarded to the Bureau of Indian Standards for adoption as National Standards.\nThe major items  in the Action Plan for 2000-2001 are :26\n\u2022 The spread and coverage of the Indian Financial Network \u2013 INFINET will be\nextended to cover all the hundred odd commercially important centres in the country.\nThe development of the Structured Financial Messaging backbone for exchange of\nfinancial messages based on international standards will also be implemented.\n\u2022 Priority will be given for integrating the various segments of the payments and\nsettlement system and on the introduction of the RTGS and the consolidation of the\nvarious Deferred Net Clearing Settlements spread across various cities.\n\u2022 Technology upgradation and increasing the scope of computerisation by\nbringing in more activities under its ambit within the banking sector.\nRegulations Review Authority\n93.The experience in the last one year with Regulations Review Authority (RRA) for\nreviewing Reserve Bank's rules, regulations and reporting systems  based on the suggestions\nreceived from  general public at large, users of services of the Bank and  market participants\nhas been satisfactory. After a review of the progress so far, the Reserve Bank has since\nextended the term of RRA for a further period of one year from April 1, 2000.   The RRA has\nreceived 200 applications which contained more than 350 suggestions pertaining to the entire\ngamut of operations of the Bank.  Implementation of several suggestions not only paved the\nway for streamlining several existing procedures and improving customer service, but also\nhelped in  reviewing and streamlining Bank\u2019s reporting systems. A notable achievement of\nRRA has been the  compilation of Master circulars, subject-wise, in Manual form by merging\na large number of circulars issued over many years on specific subjects. Such master\ncirculars cover important operational areas of compliance by banks and institutions. This\nwork is being further pursued.\nMid-Term Review\n94.A Review of credit and monetary developments in the first half of the current year\nwill be undertaken in October 2000.  The mid-term review will be confined to a review of\nmonetary developments and to such changes as may be necessary in monetary policy and\nprojections for the second half of the year.\nMumbai\nApril 27, 200027\nAnnexure I\nFeatures of the Proposed Scheme of\nLiquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)\n(Draft)\nThe Scheme of Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) will include (i) Repo Auctions\nand (ii) Reverse Repo auctions. The features of the proposed Scheme are presented below :\nFeatures of Repo Auctions\n2.The current Fixed Rate Auction system and ACLF for banks along with Level II\nsupport for PDs will be replaced by a variable interest rate auction system on \u201cuniform price\u201d\nbasis to be conducted by Reserve Bank of India.  The minimum amount will be Rs.1 crore\nand in multiples of Rs.1 crore.  Only banks and PDs maintaining SGL and Current Accounts\nwith Reserve Bank of India at Mumbai will be eligible to participate in the repo auction.\nBids for repos are to be submitted before 10.30 a.m. on all working days, Monday through\nFriday. Multiple bids can be submitted. There will be no auction on Saturdays. The results of\nthe auctions will be announced by 1.00 p.m.  The settlement of transactions in the auctions\nwill take place on the same day.  But for intervening holidays, the repo auctions will be for\none day except on Fridays; on Fridays, the auction will be for three days or more maturing on\nthe following working day.\n3.RBI will maintain a Constituents\u2019 Repos SGL Account for purposes of settlement.\nSecurities held by Reserve Bank of India on behalf of banks in the Repo SGL Accounts will\nbe eligible for SLR purposes. The Reserve Bank will issue SGL Balance Certificate\nindicating the details of total holdings of bank/institution and total loan-wise securities held\nin the Repo Constituents\u2019 SGL Account as on any date.  To simplify the provision of\nliquidity, in case of reverse repo auctions, successful participants who are eligible to draw\nrefinance from RBI will be granted refinance against collateral as per the existing procedures.\nThe other successful banks/institutions not eligible for refinance will be provided liquidity\nsupport in the form of reverse repo as per the existing procedures.\n4.After further consultations, and modifications as necessary, the abo ve scheme will\ncome into effect on June 5, 2000.  It is also proposed to review the scheme after some\nexperience has been gained in implementation.28\nAnnexure II\nGuidelines for Entry of Banks into Insurance\n1.Any Scheduled Commercial Bank would be permitted to undertake insurance\nbusiness as agent of insurance companies on fee basis, without any risk participation.  The\nsubsidiaries of banks will also be allowed to undertake distribution of insurance product on\nagency basis.\n2.Banks which satisfy the eligibility criteria given below will be permitted to set up a\njoint venture company for undertaking insurance business with risk participation, subject to\nsafeguards.  The maximum equity contribution such a bank can hold in the joint venture\ncompany will normally be 50 per cent of the paid-up capital of the insurance company.  On a\nselective basis, the Reserve  Bank of India may permit a higher equity contribution by a\npromoter bank initially, pending divestment of equity within the prescribed period (see Note\n1 below).\nThe eligibility criteria for joint venture participant will be as under,  as on March 31, 2000 :\n(i) The net worth of the bank should not be less than Rs.500 crore,\n(ii) The CRAR of the bank should not be less than 10 per cent,\n(iii) The level of non-performing assets should be reasonable,\n(iv) The bank should have net profit for the last three continuous years,\n(v) The track record of the performance of the subsidiaries, if any,\nof the concerned bank should be satisfactory.\n3.In cases where a foreign partner contributes 26 per cent of the equity with the\napproval of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority/Foreign Investment Promotion\nBoard, more than one public sector bank or private sector bank may be allowed to participate\nin the equity of the insurance joint venture.  As such participants will also assume insurance\nrisk, only those banks which satisfy the criteria given in paragraph 2 above, would be\neligible.\n4.A subsidiary of a bank or of another bank will not normally be allowed to join the\ninsurance company on risk participation basis.  Subsidiaries would include bank subsidiaries\nundertaking merchant banking, securities, mutual fund, leasing finance, housing finance\nbusiness, etc.\n5.Banks which are not eligible as joint venture participant, as above, can make\ninvestments up to 10 per cent of the net worth of the bank of Rs.50 crore, whichever is lower,\nin the insurance company for providing infrastructure and services support.

The Reserve Bank will give permission to banks on case to case basis\nkeeping in view all relevant factors including the position in regard to the level of non-\nperforming assets of the applicant banks so as to ensure that non-performing assets do not\npose any future threat to the bank in its present or the proposed line of activity, viz., insurance\nbusiness.  It should be ensured that risks involved in insurance business do not get transferred\nto the bank and that the banking business does not get contaminated by any risks which may\narise from insurance business.  There should be \u2018arms length\u2019 relationship between the bank\nand the insurance outfit.\nNotes:\n1. Holding of equity by a promoter bank in an insurance company or participation in any\nform in insurance business will be subject to compliance with any rules and regulations laid\ndown by the IRDA/Central Government.  This will include compliance with Section 6AA of\nthe Insurance Act as amended by the IRDA Act, 1999, for divestment of equity in excess of\n26 per cent of the paid up capital within a prescribed period of time.\n2.In case audited balance sheet for the year ending March 31, 2000 is not available,\nunaudited balance sheet for the year ending March 31, 2000 may be considered for reckoning\nthe eligibility criteria.  For subsequent years, the eligibility criteria would be reckoned with\nreference to the latest available audited balance sheet for the previous year.\n3.Banks which make investments under paragraph 5 of the above Guidelines, and later\nqualify for risk participation in insurance business (as per paragraph 2 of the Guidelines) will\nbe eligible to apply to the Reserve Bank for permission to undertake insurance business on\nrisk participation basis.\n                                           \n* The macro-economic and monetary developments in 1999-2000 are dealt with in greater detail in a separate\ndocument, which is published for the first time, as part of the annual monetary and credit policy.\n+With effect from April 1,2000, the Wholesale Price Index had been revised to a new series with 1993-94 as the\nbase year.

The increase of 0.42 percentage\npoint, is accounted for by the change in composition and the weighting diagram.  However, it may be noted that\nthe inflation rate for 1999-2000 on an average  basis, according to the new WPI series was substantially lower\n(2.9 per cent in 1999-2000 as against 6.0 per cent in the previous year).", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/13026.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 03, 2000", "info": "A.D.(M.A.Series) Circular No.7 (April 28, 2000)\nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA\nEXCHANGE CONTROL DEPARTMENT\nCENTRAL OFFICE\nMUMBAI-400 001\nA.D.(M.A.Series) Circular No.7\nApril 28, 2000\nTo\nAll Authorised Dealers in Foreign Exchange\nDear Sirs,\nAmendments to Exchange Control Manual (ECM)\nIt has been decided to amend/modify the exchange control regulations as stated in\nthe following paragraphs.\n2.Remittance of surplus passage fare and/or freight by agents of Foreign\nAirline/ Shipping Companies - Ad-hoc remittance facility\nIn terms of paragraph 8B.1 and 8B.2 of Exchange Control Manual (ECM),\nauthorised dealers are permitted to allow foreign airline, and shipping companies to make\nremittances of surplus passage fare and/or freight collection on submission of statements\nSPM1 and SPM2, respectively.\nWith a view to enabling foreign airline/shipping companies to transfer such surplus\ncollections soon after the end of the month/sailing of the vessel, pending scrutiny of\nrespective statements by their bankers, it has been decided to grant ad hoc remittance\nfacility to these companies.

However, in case of default in\ninterest/principal by the State Government  banks are  required to assign 100 per cent risk\nweight on investment in all the securities issued or guaranteed by that State Government.\nThe position has since been reviewed and it has been decided that banks need to assign risk\nweight of 100 per cent only on those State Government guaranteed securities issued by\nthe defaulting entities and not on all the securities issued or guaranteed by that State\nGovernment.\nBanks are further advised to pay due regard to the record of particular State Government in\nhonouring their guarantees while processing any further requests for loans to PSUs in that\nState on the strength of State Government guarantee.\n2.

In other words, our guidelines on income recognition, asset\nclassification and provisioning will apply to such additional credit facilities only after a\nperiod of one year from the date of disbursement.\nBanks have been representing that the above relaxation is not available in respect of\nadditional credit facilities granted under the rehabilitation package/nursing programme\nprepared by banks themselves or under consortium arrangements .   On a review of the matter,\nit has been decided that no provision need be made for a period of one year in respect of\nadditional credit facilities granted to SSI units which are identified as sick (as defined in\npara 5 (a )  of RPCD Circular No. PFNFS.

In the light of suggestions received\nfrom banks in regard to treatment and accounting of provision on Standard Assets, our\ninstructions are partially modified as under:\n\u2022 The general provision of 0.25 per cent on Standard Assets should be  made on global\nportfolio basis and not on domestic advances alone.\n\u2022 Provisions towards Standard Assets need not be netted from gross advances as\nadvised earlier but shown separately as \u201cContingent Provisions against Standard\nAssets\u201d, under \u201cOther Liabilities and Provisions - Others\u201d in Schedule No. 5 of the\nbalance sheet.\n\u2022 The above contingent provision will not be eligible for inclusion in Tier II Capital.\n4.

Although such\nadvances are secured, it is likely that they may not be fully secured by tangible assets.\nHence, banks may now indicate separately in Schedule 9 that item B ( i)  includes \u201cAdvances\nagainst Book Debts\u201d as shown below:\nAdvances \u2013 (Schedule 9)\nB (i)Secured by tangible assets *\n(* includes advances against Book Debt)\n5.

Siddiqi)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nDraft Guidelines for banks\u2019 Non-SLR investments\nAs you may be aware the RBI has been concerned for quite some time about the\nquality of the Non-SLR Portfolio of banks as studies have shown that a substantial\nportion of it is composed of privately placed unquoted securities. Though banks have\nnot reported any significant losses on their holding of unquoted debt, the absence of a\nsecondary market for unquoted paper raises concerns about the valuation of the\nportfolio also.2. With a view to ensuring that Non-SLR investments are made on the basis of sound\nprudential considerations and more transparency, accountability and risk perception is\nbrought to bear on decision making, the following guidelines are issued relating to\ni. classification of debentures as advances or investments\nii. limits on nature and extent of advance or investment and\niii. Valuation basis\n3. Classification of debentures\ni. The Accounting standard on \" Disclosure of Accounting Policies ( AS-1) \" as\nwell as the Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial\nstatements issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee have\nstipulated that the accounting treatment and presentation in financial\nstatements of transactions and events should be in accordance with their\nsubstance and economic reality and not merely the legal form ( details of\nrelevant accounting standards are given in Annexure I ).\nTherefore, In deciding upon the classification, it is important to consider the intention\nbehind the deployment of funds. The factors which could indicate the intention are :-\na. the tenure of the debenture\nb. the purpose for which the proceeds will be used\nc. the share of the investor in the total issue\nd. whether the borrower approached the lender or whether the borrower\nissued an invitation to which the lender responded\n(ii) Having regard to the above, debentures must be treated in the nature of an advance\nwhen :\na. the debenture is issued as part of the proposal for project finance\nb. the tenure of the debenture is of 5 years and above, i.e. long-term\nc. the investor has a significant stake in the issue say 10% or more\nd. the issue is part of a private placement, that is, the borrower has\napproached the investor and not part of a public issue where the investor\nhas subscribed in response to an invitation\n(iii) Since it may be difficult in all cases to identify debentures which in substance are\nadvances, the debentures need not be shown as advances if any of the following\nfeatures exist. (The reasons are stated thereagainst).\nFeature Reason\n(a) Tenure is less than 5 years. Project finance is normally 5 years and\nmore.\n(b) Stake is less than 10% of issue Advance implies a lender/borrowerrelationship which suggests one or a\nconsortium of lenders. When the stake is\nbelow 10% it may suggest the relationship\nof an investor.\n(c) Debenture is not privately placed When the institution subscribes to a public\nissue of debentures or buys the debentures\nin the secondary market, it is acting as an\ninvestor and not as a lender.\n4. Limit on the extent of advance or investment\n4.1 Where the debenture is treated as advance there need not be any limit on the extent\nof holding since the advance will be subject to the usual prudential norms applicable to\nadvances.\n4.2 Where the debenture is treated as investment, such investment should be within a\nlimit of 15% of total investments considering the fact that the debentures are generally\nilliquid. There is a similar limit in respect of thinly traded or non-traded investments of\nmutual funds.\n5. Valuation :\ni. Debentures : Because of their illiquidity, all debentures falling within the\ncategory of investments should be valued on the YTM basis. Since the\ndebentures may be of different companies having different ratings, the basis\nof valuation may be decided by the institutions subject to the following:-\na. The rate used for the YTM should be at least 0.5% above the\nrate applicable to a Government of India loan of equal maturity.\nb. Where the debenture is quoted and there have been transactions within\n15 days prior to the valuation date, the value adopted should not be higher than\nthe rate at which the transaction is recorded on the stock exchange.\nii. Preference Shares : The basis of valuation of preference shares should be\non YTM basis. Since the preference shares will be issued by companies with\ndifferent ratings, the basis of valuation may be decided by the institutions\nsubject to the following (for the reasons stated thereagainst).\nStipulation Reason\na. The rate used for YTM Should:- i. Dividends on preference shares are tax-\nfree.\ni. in the case of a bank must not be lower\nthan the coupon rate for a GOI loan of equal\nMaturityii. The effective tax rate for a bank is 38.5%\nand for an FI is 23.1% considering 40%\ndeduction under Section 36(1) (viii).ii. in the case of an FI must not be lower\nthan 1.5% above the coupon rate for a GOI\nloan of equal maturityiii. Therefore the after-tax return on a GOI\nloan with a coupon rate of 10.75% would be\n6.61% for a bank and 8.27% for an FI.\niv. Considering a risk factor of 4%, the\nexpected return should be 10.61% for a bank\nand 12.27% for an FI.\na. Where preference dividends are in arrears,\nno credit should be taken for accrued\ndividends and the value determined on YTM\nshould be discounted by at least 15% if\narrears are for one year and more if the\narrears are for more than one year.When preference dividends are in arrears, the\nshare is a on-performing asset.\n* The share should not be valued at above its\nredemption value.This is the maximum amount which will be\nreceived on redemption.\n* When a preference share has been traded\non the stock exchange within 15 days prior\nto the valuation date, the value should not be\nhigher than the price at which the share is\ntraded.\nAnnexure I\n1.1 Accounting Standard on \"Disclosure of Accounting Policies\" (AS-1) states as\nunder :-\n\"Considerations in the Selection of Accounting Policies\"\n16. The primary consideration in the selection of accounting policies by an\nenterprise is that the financial statements prepared and presented on the basis of\nsuch accounting policies should represent a true and fair view of the state of\naffairs of the enterprise as at the balance sheet date and of the profit or loss for\nthe period ended on that date.\n17. For this purpose, the major considerations governing the selection and\napplication of accounting policies are: -\na. Prudence\n.........\n b.Substance over Form\n The accounting treatment and presentation in financial statements of\ntransactions and events should be governed by their substance and not merely\nby the legal form. c. Materiality\n .............\"\n 2. Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements\nissued by the International Accounting Standards Committee states under\n\"Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Statements\".\n \"Qualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information\nprovided in financial statements useful to users. The four principal qualitative\ncharacteristics are understandability, relevance, reliability comparability\".\n Under reliability there is a paragraph (No.35) headed \"Substance over Form\"\nwhich states: -\n\"35. If information is to represent faithfully the transactions and other events that it\npurports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in\naccordance with their substances and economic reality and not merely their legal form.\nThe substance of transactions or other events is not always consistent with that which\nis apparent from their legal or contrived form. For example, an enterprise may dispose\nof an asset to another party in such a way that the documentation purports to pass legal\nownership to that party; nevertheless, agreements may exist that ensure that the\nenterprise continues to enjoy the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.

Accordingly, the matter has been reviewed\nand it has been decided that banks may be given discretion to charge interest at suitable\nrates in case of advances upto Rs.2 lakhs against third party deposits, as has been done\nrecently in case of advances to depositors against their own deposits.  They will now be\nfree to charge interest on such advances upto Rs.2 lakhs without reference to their Prime\nLending Rate (PLR).  However, interest rate on advances above Rs.2 lakhs against third\nparty deposits will continue to be determined in terms of Reserve Bank of India\u2019s\ndirectives on interest rates on advances issued from time to time.\n2.

Any scheduled commercial bank would be permitted to undertake insurance business\nas agents of insurance companies on fee basis, without any risk participation.  The\nsubsidiaries of any bank which have been set up with the approval of the Reserve Bank\nwill also be allowed to undertake distribution of insurance product on agency basis.\n2.    Banks which satisfy the eligibility criteria given below will be permitted to set up a\njoint venture company for undertaking insurance business.  The maximum equity\ncontribution such a bank can hold in the joint venture company will be 50 per cent of the\npaid-up capital of the insurance company.  The eligibility criteria for joint venture\nparticipant will be as under as on March 31, 2000 :\n(i) The net worth of the bank should not be less than Rs.500 crore.\n(ii) The CRAR of the bank should not less than 10 per cent.\n(iii) The level of non-performing assets should be reasonable.\n(iv) The bank should have net profit for the last three continuous years.\n(v) The track record of the performance of the subsidiaries, if any, of the\nconcerned bank should be satisfactory.\n3.In cases where a foreign partner contributes 26 per cent of the equity with the\napproval of IRDA/FIPB (Foreign Investment Promotion Board), any other nationalized\nbank or a private sector bank would be allowed to participate in the equity of the\ninsurance joint venture.  As such participants will also assume insurance risk, only those\nbanks which satisfy the criteria given above would be eligible.\n4.Any subsidiary of the same bank or of another bank will not be allowed to join the\ninsurance company on risk participation basis.  This would include bank subsidiaries\nundertaking merchant banking, securities, mutual fund, leasing finance, housing finance\nbusiness etc.  For this purpose, the Associate Banks of State Bank of India will be\nreckoned as a subsidiary where the State Bank of India is a partner.\n5.   Banks which are not eligible as joint venture participant, as above, can make\ninvestments up to 10 per cent of the networth of the bank or Rs.50 crore, whichever is\nlower, in the insurance company for providing infrastructure and services support.  Such\ninvestments will be on one time basis and without any contingent liability for the bank.\nSuch contribution will be treated as an investment.  The criteria for these banks will be as\nunder as on March 31, 2000.\n(i) The CRAR of the bank should not be less than 10 per cent.\n(ii) The level of NPA should be reasonable.\n(iii) The bank should have net profit for the last three continuous years.\n6.    All banks entering into insurance business will be required to obtain prior approval\nof the Reserve Bank.

Please refer in this connection to paragraph 64 of our circular No.\nBC.185/07.01.279/98-99 dated April 20, 1999 and paragraph 51 of our circular No.\nBC.190/07.01.279/98-99 dated October 29, 1999. This Cell has since submitted its\nreport.   In the meantime, a Task Force on Supportive Policy and Regulatory\nFramework for Micro Credit was set up by NABARD and its report has also been\npresented. Micro credit is defined as the provision of thrift, credit and other financial\nservices and products of very small amount to the poor in rural, semi-urban and urban\nareas for enabling them to raise their income levels and improve living standards. Micro\nCredit institutions are those which provide these facilities.\n2.In this context, it has been dec ided that banks may follow the undernoted\nguidelines for mainstreaming micro credit and enhancing the outreach of micro credit\nproviders:\n(i) As mentioned in our circular RPCD.No.PL.BC. 94/04.09.01/98-99 dated April 24,\n1999, interest rates applicable to loans given by banks to micro credit organisations or\nby the micro credit organisations to Self-Help Groups/member beneficiaries has been\nleft to their discretion. The interest rate ceiling applicable to direct small loans given by\nbanks to individual borrowers, however, continues to remain in force.\n(ii) The banks may formulate their own model(s) or choose any conduit/intermediary\nfor extending micro credit. They may choose suitable branches/pockets/areas where\nmicro credit programmes can be implemented.  It will be useful in our view to start with\na selected small area and concentrate fully on the poor in that area and thereafter with\nthe experience gained replicate the arrangement in other selected areas. Micro Credit\nextended by banks to individual borrowers directly or through any intermediary would\nbe reckoned as part of their priority sector lending.\n(iii) The criteria for selection of micro credit organisations are not being prescribed. It\nmay, however, be desirable for banks to deal with micro credit organisations having\nproper credentials, track record, system of maintaining accounts and records with\nregular audits in place and manpower for closer supervision and follow-up.\n(iv) Banks may prescribe their own lending norms keeping in view the ground realities.\nThey may devise appropriate loan and savings products and the related terms and\nconditions including the size of the loan, unit cost, unit size, maturity period, grace\nperiod, margins, etc. The intention is to provide maximum flexibility in regard to micro\nlending keeping in view the prevalent local conditions and the need for provision of\nfinance to the poor. Such credit should, therefore, cover not only consumption and\nproduction loans for various farm and non-farm activities of the poor but also include\ntheir other credit needs such as housing and shelter improvements.\n(v) Micro credit should henceforth be included in branch credit plan, block credit plan,\ndistrict credit plan and state credit plan of each bank.  While no target is being\nprescribed for micro credit, utmost priority should be accorded to the micro credit sector\nin preparation of these plans. As advised in our circular RPCD.PL.BC.28/04.09.22/99-\n2000 dated September 30, 1999, micro credit should also form an integral part of the\nbank\u2019s corporate credit plan and should be reviewed at the highest level on a quarterly\nbasis.2\n(vi) A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation is a pre-\ncondition for augmenting flow of micro credit. Hence banks should strive to remove all\noperational irritants and make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and disburse\nmicro credit by delegating adequate sanctioning powers to branch managers. The loan\napplication forms, procedures and documents should be made simple. It would help in\nproviding prompt and hassle-free micro credit.\n(vii) A statement should be furnished to RPCD, RBI on a half-yearly basis indicating\nthe amount of micro credit disbursed by the bank. In this connection, we have revised\nthe format for the Progress Report on the Financing of Self-Help Groups by banks\npresently being submitted by you to both NABARD and us as prescribed vide our\ncircular RPCD.PL.969/04.09.22/97-98 dated May 05, 1998. A copy of the revised\nstatement format is enclosed. The first such statement should relate to the period ending\nMarch 2000.\nBanks should initiate immediate action in regard to the above under advice to us.\n3.Please acknowledge receipt of this letter.\nYours faithfully\n( B.R.

However, the maturity of the cover should not exceed the maturity of\nthe underlying transaction.\n(iii) Foreign currency loans/bonds become eligible for cover only after final approval is\naccorded by the Reserve Bank for the arrangement.

Entities who do not have any forex exposure but  are willing to\nassume a forex liability in lieu of their long term rupee liability may also become counter parties in the\narrangement. As far as possible such transactions should be concluded on a matched basis. However,\nwhere this is not feasible authorised dealers may temporarily warehouse the swaps/absorb the mis-matches\nwithin their open position and gap limits.\nNOTE :  Authorised dealers should not allow the swap route to become a surrogate for\nforward contracts for those who do not qualify for forward cover under paragraph\n3C.1.\nHedging of Loan Exposures3C.3 (i) Authorised dealers may offer the undernoted products to corporates either on a back-to-\nback basis or by booking the transaction overseas with the branch of an authorised dealer in India.\n(a) Interest rate swaps\n(b) Currency swaps\n(c) Coupon swaps\n(d) Interest rate caps/collars (purchase)\n(e) Forward Rate Agreements\n(ii) Before entertaining any request for any of these facilities, the authorised dealer should ensure\nthat\n(a) the Reserve Bank has accorded final approval for the conclusion of the underlying loan\ntransaction;\n(b) the notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the outstanding amount of\nthe foreign currency loan;\n(c) the maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to maturity of the\nunderlying loan;\n(d) the  Board  of Directors  of  the corporate has drawn up a risk management policy, laid\ndown clear guidelines for concluding transactions, and institutionalised arrangements\nfor a quarterly review of  operations and annual audit of transactions to verify\ncompliance with the regulations.\n(e) the hedge results in reduction of the risk of exposure and there is no net inflow of\npremium, direct or implied in cases where option  components are built into the hedge\nstrategy;\n(iii) Corporates   may be permitted to unwind a hedge transaction.\n(iv) A report of the transaction (booked/cancelled), verified by the  authorised dealer should be\nsubmitted to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank, within a week of its conclusion.\n(v) Authorised dealers should obtain from the concerned corporates copies of the quarterly reviews\nand annual  audit reports vide paragraph (ii) (d) above.\n(vi) Payment of upfront premia, if any, as well as all other charges incidental to the hedge transaction\nmay be effected without the prior approval of Reserve Bank.\nOther Derivatives  -  Foreign Currency Options\n3C.4 (i) Authorised dealers may offer cross currency options to residents to cover their genuine\nexposures including contingent exposures like tender bids.

Take out finance is the product\nemerging in the context of the funding of long-term infrastructure projects.   Under this\narrangement, institution/bank financing the infrastructure projects will have an arrangement\nwith any financial institution for transferring to the latter  outstandings in respect of  such\nfinancing in their books on a pre-determined basis. The proposals for take-out finance also\nhelp the banks in asset liability management since the financing of infrastructure is long term\nin nature against their short-term resources.  There are several variants of the Take-out-\nfinance but basically they are either in the nature of unconditional take-out finance or\nconditional take-out finance though it may involve assuming full credit risk or part of the\nsame.  The  take-out-finance products will involve three parties  viz., the project company,\ntaking over institution and the lending banks/FI.  Moreover, the company should also\nrecognise the aforesaid arrangement by way of inter creditor agreement. The issues pertaining\nto criteria for assigning  risk weight  and applying other prudential norms in respect of  take\nout finance have since been examined and we advise as under  :-\nThe risk weight to be assigned for these finances will be as follows  :\nA. Unconditional take out finance\nThe unconditional take out finance involves the assumption of partial / full credit risk by the\ninstitution agreeing to take over the finance from the original lender.  In such a case the credit\nfacility extended to the borrower will be borne on the books of the original lender till it is\ntaken over.  The institution agreeing to take over would have to reflect in its books this\nobligation as a contingent liability till it actually takes over with partial or full credit risk as\nagreed upon.\nConsequently,\n(a) The lending institution should assign a risk weight of 20 per cent on the asset to\nthe extent to which risk will be assumed by taking over financial  institution as the\ncounter party is the financial institution. The portion, which will not be taken over\nby the taking over institution, will have to be assigned 100 per cent risk weight.\n(b) Contingent liability on the books of the taking over institution would have to be\nconverted at a credit conversion factor of 100 per cent.  As the counter party\nexposure will determine the risk weight it will be 100 per cent in respect of all\nborrowers or zero per cent if covered by Government guarantee.\nB.  Conditional take over:\nIn this scenario, the taking over institution would have stipulated certain  conditions to be\nsatisfied by the borrower before it is taken over from the lending institution.  There is,\ntherefore, an element of uncertainty over the  ultimate transfer of the assets to the taking over\ninstitution.  The risk weight and other prescription would therefore have to be different.\n(a) The assets on the books of the lending institution would carry 100 per cent risk weight\nas the take over is not automatic.\n(b) The obligation to take over the assets, though conditional needs to be reflected on the\nbooks of the taking over institution by way of a contingent liability.  However, since\nthe take over is conditional, the credit conversion factor will be 50 percent only as\nagainst 100 percent in the case of unconditional take over.  As regards the assignmentof risk weight no distinction is required and irrespective of the actual take over, the\nrisk weight will be 100 per cent in the case of all borrowers and zero per cent  in\nrespect of those backed by a Government guarantee.\n2. Income Recognition and Provisioning\nIn   view   of   the   time period involved in taking over, the possibility   of   a   default  in the\nmeantime can not be ruled out. The norms of income recognition and  provisioning will have\nto be followed by the concerned bank / FI in whose books the account stands as balance sheet\nitem as on the relevant date. If the lending institution observes that the asset has turned NPA\non the basis of the record of recovery, it should be classified accordingly. The lending\ninstitution should not also recognise income on accrual basis and account for the same only\nwhen it is paid by the borrower /  taking over institution (if the arrangement so provides). The\nlending institution should also make provisions against any asset turning into NPA pending its\ntake over by taking over institution. As and when the asset is taken over by the taking over\ninstitution, the corresponding provisions could be reversed. However, the taking over\ninstitution, on taking over such assets, should make provisions treating  the account as NPA\nfrom the actual date of it becoming NPA even though  the account was not in its books as on\nthat date.\nThe summary of guidelines in respect of assigning risk weight, asset classification,\nincome recognition and provisioning  in respect of  take-out finance are listed in the\nAnnexure.\nPlease acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(K.

Accordingly ,  it  has been decided to exempt such NBFCs\nwhich are engaged in   ( i) micro financing activities, (ii) licensed under Section 25 of the\nCompanies Act, 1956 and (iii) which are not accepting public deposits from the purview of\nSections 45-IA (registration), 45-IB (maintenance of liquid assets) and 45-IC (transfer of profits\nto Reserve Fund) of RBI Act, 1934.\n(2)      Un-notified nidhi companies\n(i)A Nidhi company notified under section 620-A of the Companies Act is classified at\npresent as \"Mutual Benefit Financial Company\" by RBI and regulated by the Bank for its deposit\ntaking activities and by DCA for its operational matters as also the deployment of funds.  These\nCompanies enjoy exemption from core provisions of the RBI Act viz. requirement of\nregistration, maintenance of liquid assets and creation of reserve fund, and  RBI Directions\nexcept those relating to interest rate on deposits, prohibition from paying brokerage on deposits,2ban on advertisements and the requirement of submission of certain Returns.  Such companies,\nhowever ,  are allowed to deal with their shareholders only,  for the purpose of accepting deposits\nand making loans. There are a number of companies functioning on the lines of Nidhi companies\nbut not yet notified by DCA.  As RBI Directions to classify them as loan companies disallowed\nthem the special dispensation available to Notified Nidhi companies ;   Bank and the Government\nreceived representations from a large number of such companies and their associations.\nGovernment  decided to give them  a special dispensation and notified that applications of\ncompanies incorporated on or before January 9, 1997 shall  be considered for notifying  as  Nidhi\nCompany under section 620-A of the Companies Act, 1956  only if they have minimum NOF of\nRs.10 lakh or more. These companies shall be required to have net owned fund of Rs.25 lakh by\nDecember 31, 2002 like companies already declared  as Nidhis. Government has also clarified\nthat NOF shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in the RBI Act, 1934. Thus a new class\nof companies has been created i.e. the potential Nidhi companies. To distinguish them from the\nnotified Nidhi companies ( Mutual Benefit Financial Companies) the term Mutual Benefit\nCompanies (MBC) is being used.\n(ii)   Since the notified nidhi companies are exempted from the provisions of Section 45-IA\n(Compulsory Registration with RBI), Section 45-IB (Maintenance of Liquid Assets) and Section\n45-IC (Creation of Reserve Fund), it has been decided on the lines of Government advice to\nexempt the MBCs  in existence as on January 9, 1997 and having NOF of Rs.10 lakh from the\nabove mentioned provisions of the Act in terms of powers vested with the Bank under Section 45\nNC of the Act and also from those provisions of NBFC Directions on Acceptance of Public\nDeposits and Prudential Norms which do not apply to notified nidhi companies.\n(3)Government NBFCs\n(i) There are a number of Government NBFCs which fall within the ambit of RBI\nRegulations. The Government Department or the Ministry or the Bureau of Public Enterprises to\nwhich such companies are attached, are expected to prescribe the norms for their operations on\nhealthy lines and monitor their financial health. Such companies being Government companies\npose little  supervisory concern regarding repayment of the deposits held by them and protection\nof interests of the depositors. Needless to mention, all these companies are required to be audited\nby the statutory auditors as per the provisions of Companies Act and the irregularities, if any, in\ntheir functioning are brought to the notice of Government by the auditors for corrective steps.\n(ii) Although, we do not intend to discriminate among the NBFCs o n the basis of ownership\nbut in view of the role being played by these companies in discharge of their social obligations\nand the norms prescribed for their working by their respective supervisory departments and for\navoiding dual control over them, we have decided, in consultation with Government, to exempt\nthe Government companies as conforming to Section 617 of the Companies Act from\napplicability of the provisions of RBI Act relating to maintenance of liquid assets and creation of\nreserve funds, and the Directions relating to acceptance of public deposits and prudential norms.\nThe requirement of statutory registration of these companies under Section 45-IA of the RBI\nAct, 1956 shall, however, continue.\n(4)Term deposits with banks to be reckoned as part\nof  liquid  assets  along  with Government papers3(i)The NBFCs have been voicing their problems in securing desired  lots of Government\nsecurities in small towns and localities in the country. In order to increase operational ease in\nmaintenance of liquid assets, the NBFCs have been permitted to maintain upto 5 percent of the\npublic deposits in the form of term deposits with scheduled commercial banks out of present\nrequirement of 15 percent  of public deposits to be invested in liquid assets. It is expected that it\nwould enable the NBFCs in establishing a relationship with their bankers and securing services\nas the banker. These instructions are effective retrospectively from the first day of the quarter\nbeginning January 1, 2000.\n(ii)The NBFCs are, h owever, advised to strictly adhere to the requirements of maintenance\nof liquid assets. It may also be reiterated that the NBFCs holding public deposits should\nscrupulously furnish the liquid asset return on quarterly basis and the delay in submission or non-\nsubmission thereof would be viewed seriously and the concerned NBFC would expose itself to\nlevy of penal interest and adverse action under Section 58- B(6) of the RBI Act.\n(5)Additional terms and conditions for\ngrant  of Certificate  of Registration\nPrior RBI approval for change\nin  names  of  NBFC               .\n(i)Instances have been brought to our notice of some NBFCs changing their name, more\nparticularly to add Infotec tag with a view to taking advantage of the capital market sentiments,\nwhich may not only jeopardise the interest of the depositors, but also of the investors. Such a\nchange in the name and the business plan of the company may also result into the principal\nbusiness of the NBFC becoming non-financial, thereby affecting its  eligibility for grant and\nholding of Certificate of Registration under Section 45-IA (4) of the RBI Act.  It has, therefore,\nbeen decided in the public interest that an NBFC intending to change its present name would\nneed to obtain prior permission of RBI before approaching the Registrar of Companies for\nchange of name. Any violation of these directions would attract serious action against the\ncompany as provided for under the RBI Act including cancellation of the Certificate of\nRegistration if already granted, or rejection of its application for registration ,  as the case may be.\nSubmission of information on Permanent\nAccount  Numbers  (PAN)  allotted by I.T.\nDepartment in respect of all the Directors\nof NBFCs                                                  .\n(ii) There are reports of some companies including NBFCs vanishing after mobilisation of\ncapital, deposits, etc. from public, raising grave supervisory concerns. Since the present\nregulatory framework is aimed at ensuring that registration is granted only to serious and\nbonafide players in the NBFC sector, it has been decided to place on record details of Permanent\nAccount Number issued by Income Tax Authorities, of each of the directors of all NBFCs\nwhether registered or whose applications for Certificate of Registration are pending with the\nBank. All the NBFCs are, therefore, advised to furnish the information to the respective Regional\nOffice of RBI within 2 months of the receipt of this letter failing which the grant or continuance\nof the Certificate of Registration would be reconsidered.4Change in management\nand mergers/amalgamation\n(iii)(a)A reference is invited to paragraph 2 (b) of our circular DNBS (PD).       CC.No.11/\n02.01/99-2000 dated November 15, 1999 in terms of which the NBFCs have been directed to\ngive 3 months prior public notice of the intention of sale or transfer of the ownership by sale of\nshares or transfer of control whether with or without sale of shares in one leading national and\nanother leading local vernacular newspaper. It has been observed that the change in management\nalso takes place by way of amalgamation / merger of an NBFC with another NBFC or a non-\nfinancial company and as such, these mergers / amalgamations would tantamount to the change\nin the management, as aforesaid.\n(b)It has further been decided that it would be  obligatory on the part of such an NBFC\nseeking change in management or merger or amalgamation with any other company to give an\noption to every depositor to decide whether to continue the deposits with the company under the\nnew management or the transferee company or not. The company would also be obliged to make\nthe payment to the depositors who seek the repayment of their deposits. The Bank would view\nthe non-compliance of the above instructions very seriously and penal action would be initiated\nagainst the defaulter company on the merits of each case.\nB. Amendments to NBFC Directions on\n           Acceptance of Public Deposits\n(1)Need for introduction of the depositors of NBFCs\nIt has been brought to the notice of the Bank that some of the NBFCs were holding\nbenami deposits. In order to curb this practice, it has been decided that the NBFCs should obtain\nproper introduction of the new depositors before opening their deposit accounts and accepting\nthe deposits. They should also obtain written confirmation from their introducers. In the absence\nof such introduction, any other document of identity of the prospective deposit holders may be\nobtained and kept on their record the evidence on which they have relied upon for the purpose of\nsuch introduction.\n(2)       Minimum period of hybrid debt capital instruments\nand subordinated debts for exclusion  from the\ndescription of public deposits                                  .\nA few NBFCs introduced new deposit products, one of which was the subordinated debts having\na maturity period of 17 months. The intention was to avoid the application of SEBI regulations\napplicable to the issue of debentures and those provisions of the RBI directions applicable to\nacceptance of public deposits because the  hybrid debt capital instruments and subordinated\ndebts issued by an NBFC are treated as part of Tier II capital in terms of the Prudential Norms\nDirections and by virtue thereof, they would be exempt from the meaning of `public deposit\u2019. It\nhas, therefore, been decided that the subordinated debt instruments with a minimum maturity\nperiod of 60 months or above at the time of their initial offer which (a) are unsecured and\nsubordinated to the claims of other creditors, (b) are free from restrictive clauses,  (c) are not\nredeemable at the instance of the holder or without the consent of the supervisory authority of the\nNBFC, will only be exempted from the  definition  of public deposits.5(3) Deposits received from joint shareholders\nby   a  private  limited   company\nSome of the private limited NBFCs have reportedly started accepting deposits from all\nthe joint shareholders. This practice has been found to be irregular, undesirable and\ncircumventing the NBFC Directions on Acceptance of Public Deposits. Accordingly, it has been\ndecided that the deposits accepted by a private limited NBFC from the first named shareholders\nwill only be exempted from the purview of public deposit. The deposits accepted from the rest of\nthe joint shareholders will be treated as public deposit.\n(4)Control over opening and closing of branches\nAbsence of control on opening/closing of branches/offices by the NBFCs and non-\nspecification of operational area of their agents have raised many regulatory concerns.\nIndiscriminate opening of branches not only increases risk for protection of depositors interest, it\ncreates supervisory difficulties for RBI as the registered office of the company may be in the\njurisdiction of one Regional Office of RBI whereas major chunk of business may be in the\njurisdictional area of other Regional Offices and thus the actual operations of the company\nremain unnoticed by the Regional Office having jurisdiction over the company\u2019s affairs.\nSimilarly, sudden closure of branches also evokes adverse public reaction. Though a strict\ncontrol over opening of branches/offices by NBFCs or non-specification of area of operations of\nagents is neither intended nor desirable in the present era of liberalisation, a surveillance over\nopening and closing of branches/offices is considered necessary from the view point of\nprudential supervision and protecting the interests of depositors. Accordingly, it has been\ndecided that\nNBFC other than RNBCs\n(i) an NBFC having a Certificate of Registration and otherwise entitled to accept public\ndeposits as per NBFC Directions on Acceptance of Public Deposits is allowed to open its\nbranch/office or allow its agents to operate for mobilisation of public deposits -\n(a) within the State where its registered office is situated if its NOF is upto\nRs.50 crore; and\n(b) any where in India if its NOF is more than Rs.50 crore and its fixed deposits\nprogramme has been rated by one of the approved credit rating agencies at\n'AA' or above.\nRNBCs\n(ii) An RNBC registered with the Bank and otherwise complying with all the statutory\nrequirements is allowed to open additional branches/offices and/or allow its agents to\noperate for mobilisation of deposits -\n(a) within the State of the location of its registered office if its NOF is upto\nRs.50 crore; and\n(b) any where in India if its NOF is  above Rs.50 crore.\nPrior intimation to RBI and public notice\n(iii)The NBFCs/RNBSs would be required to give 30 days\u2019 notice to RBI prior to the\nopening of any branch/office for mobilisation of  public deposits within the specified area6of operation and prior public notice  of three months in leading newspapers before closing\na branch. However, it is clarified that the area of operation of the agents, if appointed by\nthe company for mobilisation of public deposits, would be congruous with the area of\noperation of the branch/office to which such agents are attached.  A system of reporting\nthe name, address, date of opening and deposits held at each existing branch as also\ninformation on opening and closing of branches has been put in place.  These directions\nare applicable prospectively to the existing as well as new NBFCs/RNBCs. For the\npurpose of abundant clarification, it is advised that these Directions govern only the\ndeposit taking activities of the companies. Opening of branches or engaging the services\nof agents for other than deposit taking business is  not intended to be governed by RBI.\n(5)Responsibilities of the Auditors to report to RBI\non  compliance  with  branch control directions\nIn keeping with the existing policy of RBI to enlist the support of the statutory auditors in\nensuring compliance by the NBFCs of the RBI regulations, the auditors of these companies have\nbeen entrusted with the responsibility of direct reporting to RBI, along with other contraventions,\nif any, on the matters of non-compliance with the directions of RBI on control over opening and\nclosing of branches and engaging the services of agents  for mobilisation of public deposits by\nthe NBFCs.\nC.  Amendments to NBFC Directions on Prudential Norms\n(1)Compulsory Internal  Audit System  and\nConstitution  of  Audit  Committees\nOn the lines of scheduled commercial banks, it has been decided that all NBFCs having\nasset size of Rs.50 crore or above should have compulsory internal audit system accountable to\nthe Chief Executive Officer of the company. All these companies should also mandatorily\nconstitute an Audit Committee from among the members of their Board of Directors. This\nprovision is applicable to all NBFCs whether holding/accepting public deposits or not.\n(2)Information on suit filed accounts\nIn order to monitor the level of loan delinquencies in the NBFC sector, NBFCs are being\nadvised to furnish, in their Prudential Norms Return, information on suit filed/decreed debts by\nand against them.\nD.Other decisions/clarifications\nIt has been felt necessary to issue the following further instructions / clarifications for\ninformation and necessary action :\n(1)        Need for disclosure of information relating\nto  aggregate  dues  from  the  companies\nin  the  same  group  and  other  entities7We had vide our Notification dated December 18, 1998 prescribed that every NBFC\nshould include in its advertisement the information relating to exposure to its group companies\nand associates as per the recommendations of the Task Force on NBFCs.  It has been recently\nbrought to our notice that some of the NBFCs are still using the application forms in the old\nformats for soliciting deposits. It is clarified that the above disclosures should be included in the\napplication form for soliciting deposits without any further delay.\n(2)      Clarification on interpretation of\nthe requirement of credit rating\nBy an amendment made on 18 December 1998 to  para 4(4) of the NBFC Directions on\nAcceptance of Public Deposits, the NBFCs in the category of equipment leasing and hire\npurchase finance (EL/HP) having minimum  CRAR of 15% have been permitted to accept public\ndeposits without credit rating. Some of the NBFCs have pointed out that Paragraph 4(1)(i) of the\nDirections prohibits all NBFCs from accepting public deposits, if they have not obtained the\nminimum investment grade credit  rating. It is clarified that the regulatory provisions for\nacceptance of public deposits by EL/HP NBFCs are contained in paragraph 4(4) of the\nDirections. Accordingly, para 4(1)(i) of the Directions is being modified.\n(3)       Extension of time period to NBFCs\nhaving NOF  of less than Rs.25.00 lakh\nThe NBFCs still having NOF below the prescribed minimum level of Rs.25.00 lakh and\nwhose applications for grant of Certificate of Registration are pending with the RBI are allowed\ntime upto January 9, 2000 as provided in the RBI Act, to achieve the minimum NOF. All such\nNBFCs are advised that this time limit has expired on January 9, 2000. It is further clarified that\nRBI may not, in the normal course, grant extension of time to those NBFCs which have not\nattained the prescribed minimum NOF of Rs. 25 lakh by the above stipulated date and\naccordingly their application may not be considered for registration. Those of the NBFCs which\nhave since achieved the minimum level of NOF should inform Reserve Bank.\n(4)      Submission  of  Returns  on liquid Assets by\nNBFCs not holding/accepting public deposits\n In the wake of certain disquietening reports that  some of the NBFCs holding public\ndeposits were not furnishing the liquid asset returns,  Bank had stipulated in January 1999 that all\nNBFCs (including those not holding public deposits) should also submit liquid asset returns to\nthe Bank. The NBFCs not holding/accepting public deposits were advised to file \u2018Nil\u2019 reports.\nWe have received requests from various quarters that the requirement for the NBFCs not holding\npublic deposits to furnish the above mentioned return should be done away with. As the auditors\nof these companies continue to be responsible to report to RBI through exception reports in\nregard to the violation of the provisions of the RBI Act/Directions including non-submission of\nthe return on liquid assets,  it has been decided that the NBFCs not holding public deposits need\nnot furnish the return to RBI on and from the quarter ended December 1999.8(5)Provisioning against NPAs -\nIncome reversal to be shown\non Prudential Norms Return\nWe have received queries from some of the NBFCs and their auditors regarding\ndisclosure of the amount of income reversed on NPAs which was earlier taken to the credit of\nprofit and loss account. We clarify that the amount may be disclosed in the Prudential Norms\nReturn Part F, Item II.(A)(i)(a) col. (3) against the head \"entire amount taken to the credit of\nprofit and loss account before the asset became NPA and remaining unrealised\".\n(6)Aggregate ceiling on investments\nin  unquoted  shares\nWe have p rescribed a prudential ceiling of 10 per cent of owned funds on investments in\nunquoted shares by equipment leasing/hire purchase finance companies and 20 per cent in the\ncase of loan/investment companies if they are accepting/holding public deposits. Some of the\ncompanies are treating such ceilings as exposure norms against individual investee company.  It\nis clarified that the aforementioned ceilings are aggregate ceilings on investments in the\nunquoted shares of all the investee companies taken together.\n(7)Issue of secured debentures by NBFCs outside\nthe purview of description of public deposits\nThe provisions of para 2(1)(xii)(f) read asunder :\n\"any amount raised by the issue of bonds or debentures secured by the mortgage of any\nimmovable property of the company; or by any other asset or with an option to convert\nthem into shares in the company provided that in the case of such bonds or debentures\nsecured by the mortgage or any immovable property or secured by other assets, the\namount of such bonds or debentures shall not exceed the market value of such immovable\nproperty/other assets\"\nThe above provisions have been interpreted by some of the NBFCs in different manner. It is\nadvised that  -\n(a) the debentures which are partly secured,\n(b) the debentures which are secured by assets of a third party,\n(c) the debentures which have matured for redemption but have not been redeemed and are\noverdue, and\n(d) the debentures against which a charge has not been created in favour of the independent\ndebenture Trustees (other than debenture holders) within the stipulated period of 90 days\nand extended period of further 90 days\nshall be treated as part of public deposits.\n2.A copy each of the amending Notifications No. 134-140 is enclosed.

As part of its on-going efforts to address international bank supervisory\nissues, the Basle Committee is issuing the attached paper for comment by banks and\nother financial market participants on the management of interest rate risk. In this as in\nmany other areas sound controls are of crucial importance. It is essential that banks have\na comprehensive risk management process in place, that effectively identifies, measures,\nmonitors and controls interest rate risk exposures, and that is subject to appropriate board\nand senior management oversight. The attached paper describes each of these elements,\ndrawing upon experience in member countries and principles established in earlier\npublications by the Committee. The objective of the paper is to outline a number of\nprinciples for use by supervisory authorities when evaluating banks' interest rate risk\nmanagement.\n2. The supervisory capital requirements established by the Basle Committ ee\nwill, as from end-1997, cover interest rate risk in the trading activities of banks.2 This\npaper is intended to set out principles of more general application for the management of\ninterest rate risk, independent of whether the positions are part of the trading book or\nreflect banks' non-trading activities.\n3.  In developing these principles, the Committee has drawn not only on\nsupervisory guidance in member countries but also on the comments of the banking\nindustry on the Committee's earlier paper, issued for consultation in April 1993.3 In\naddition, the present paper incorporates many of the principles contained in the guidance\nissued by the Committee for derivatives activities ,4 which are reflected in the qualitative\nparameters for model-users in the recently published capital standards for market risk.\n4. These principles are intended to be of general application, based as they are\non practices currently used by many international banks, even though their specific\napplication will depend to some extent on the complexity and range of activities\nundertaken by individual banks. Supervisory authorities should, therefore, use them to re-\nassess their own supervisory methods and procedures for monitoring how banks control\ninterest rate risk. While the exact approach chosen by individual supervisors will depend\nupon a host of factors, including their on-site and off-site supervisory techniques and the\ndegree to which external auditors are also used in the supervisory function,  all members\nof the Basle Committee agree that the principles set out here provide the standards\nto be used by national supervisory authorities in evaluating the adequacy and\neffectiveness of a bank's interest rate risk management.\n5. The Basle Committee is also distributing this paper to su pervisory authorities\nworldwide in the belief that the principles presented will provide a useful framework for\nprudent supervision of interest rate risk. More generally, the Committee wishes to\nemphasise that sound risk management practices are essential to the prudent operation of\nbanks and to promoting stability in the financial system as a whole.526. This paper also provides supervisory authorities with a framework for\nobtaining information on interest rate risk. It broadly describes the types of basic\ninformation that should be available to supervisory authorities to help them in evaluating\nbanks' interest rate risk exposures. This information can then be used in a variety of ways\nby supervisory authorities to provide quantitative assessments of the interest rate risk\nfaced by banks.\n7. After careful consideration of the comments received on the April 1993\nproposal, the Committee has set out principles for sound interest rate risk management,\nrather than establishing a more standardised measure for interest rate risk. The\nCommittee will, however, keep the need for such more standardised measures under\nreview and may, at a later stage, revisit its approach in this area. In that context, the\nCommittee is aware that industry techniques for measuring and managing interest rate\nrisk are continuing to evolve, particularly for products with uncertain cash flows or\nrepricing dates, such as many mortgage-related products and retail deposits.\n8. Even though the Committee is not currently proposing capital charges\nspecifically for interest rate risk, all banks should have enough capital to support the risks\nthey incur, including those arising from interest rate risk. Individual supervisors may, of\ncourse, decide to apply capital charges to their banking system in general or to individual\nbanks that are more extensively exposed to interest rate risk, or whose risk management\nprocesses are unsatisfactory.\n9. The Committee stipulates in the five sections III to VII of the paper the\nfollowing twelve principles for banking supervisory authorities to apply in assessing\nbanks' management of interest rate risk:\nA. The role of the board and senior management\nPrinciple 1:\nIn order to carry out its responsibilities, the board of directors in a bank\nshould approve interest rate risk management policies and procedures, and\nshould be informed regularly of the interest rate risk exposure of the bank.\nPrinciple 2:\nSenior management must ensure that the structure of the bank's business and\nthe level of interest rate risk it assumes are effectively managed, that\nappropriate policies and procedures are established to control and limit these\nrisks, and that resources are available for evaluating and controlling interest\nrate risk.\nPrinciple 3:\nBanks should have a risk management function with clearly defined duties\nthat reports risk exposures directly to senior management and the board of\ndirectors and is sufficiently independent from the business lines of the bank.\nLarger or more complex banks should have units responsible for the design\nand administration of the bank's interest rate risk management system.53B. Policies and procedures\nPrinciple 4:\nIt is essential that banks' interest rate risk policies and procedures be clearly\ndefined and consistent with the nature and complexity of their activities. These\npolicies should address the bank's exposures on a consolidated basis and, as\nappropriate, also at the level of individual affiliates.\nPrinciple 5:\nIt is important that banks identify the risks inherent in new products and\nactivities and ensure these are subject to adequate procedures and controls\nbefore being introduced or undertaken. Major hedging or risk management\ninitiatives should be approved in advance by the board or its appropriate\ndelegated committee.\nC. Measurement and monitoring system\nPrinciple 6:\nIt is essential that banks have interest rate risk measurement systems that\ncapture all material sources of interest rate risk and that assess the effect of\ninterest rate changes in ways which are consistent with the scope of their\nactivities. The assumptions underlying the system should be clearly\nunderstood by risk managers and bank management.\nPrinciple 7:\nBanks must establish and enforce operating limits and other practices that\nmaintain exposures within levels consistent with their internal policies.\nPrinciple 8:\nBanks should measure their vulnerability to loss under stressful market\nconditions - including the breakdown of key assumptions - and consider those\nresults when establishing and reviewing their policies and limits for interest\nrate risk.\nPrinciple 9:\nBanks must have adequate information systems for monitoring and reporting\ninterest rate exposures to senior management and boards of directors on a\ntimely basis.\nD. Independent controls\nPrinciple 10:\nBanks must have adequate internal controls for their interest rate risk\nmanagement process and should evaluate the adequacy and integrity of those54controls periodically. Individuals responsible for evaluating control\nprocedures must be independent of the function they are assigned to review.\nPrinciple 11:\nBanks should periodically conduct an independent review of the adequacy and\nintegrity of their risk management processes. Such reviews should be available\nto relevant supervisory authorities.\nE. Information for supervisory authorities\nPrinciple 12:\nThe G-10 supervisory authorities will obtain from banks sufficient and timely\ninformation with which to evaluate their level of interest rate risk. This\ninformation should take appropriate account of the range of maturities and\ncurrencies in each bank's portfolio, as well as other relevant factors, such as\nthe distinction between trading and non-trading activities. Other supervisory\nauthorities are recommended to obtain similar information.\n10. Comment was invited on all aspects of this paper , including the two Annexes,\nby 15th April 1997.\nI.Sources and effects of interest rate risk\n1. Interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank's financial condition to adverse\nmovements in interest rates. Accepting this risk is a normal part of banking and can be an\nimportant source of profitability and shareholder value. However, excessive interest rate\nrisk can pose a significant threat to a bank's earnings and capital base. Changes in interest\nrates affect a bank's earnings by changing its net interest income and the level of other\ninterest-sensitive income and operating expenses. Changes in interest rates also affect the\nunderlying value of the bank's assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments\nbecause the present value of future cash flows (and in some cases, the cash flows\nthemselves) change when interest rates change. Accordingly, an effective risk\nmanagement process that maintains interest rate risk within prudent levels is essential to\nthe safety and soundness of banks.\n2. Before setting ou t some principles for interest rate risk management, a brief\nintroduction to the sources and effects of interest rate risk might be helpful. Thus, the\nfollowing sections describe the primary forms of interest rate risk to which banks are\ntypically exposed. These include repricing risk, yield curve risk, basis risk and\noptionality, each of which is discussed in greater detail below. These sections also\ndescribe the two most common perspectives for assessing a bank's interest rate risk\nexposure: the earnings perspective and the economic value perspective. As the names\nsuggest, the earnings perspective focuses on the impact of interest rate changes on a\nbank's near-term earnings, while the economic value perspective focuses on a bank's\nunderlying value.\n1.Sources of interest rate risk551. Repricing risk : As financial intermediaries, banks encounter interest rate risk\nin several ways. The primary and most often discussed form of interest rate risk arises\nfrom timing differences in the maturity (for fixed rate) and repricing (for floating rate) of\nbank assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet (OBS) positions. While such repricing\nmismatches are fundamental to the business of banking, they can expose a bank's income\nand underlying economic value to unanticipated fluctuations as interest rates vary. For\ninstance, a bank that funded a long-term fixed rate loan with a short-term deposit could\nface a decline in both the future income arising from the position and its underlying value\nif interest rates increase. These declines arise because the cash flows on the loan are fixed\nover its lifetime, while the interest paid on the funding is variable, and increases after the\nshort-term deposit matures.\n2. Yield curve risk : Repricing mismatches can also expose a bank to changes in\nthe slope and shape of the yield curve. Yield curve risk arises when unanticipated shifts\nof the yield curve have adverse effects on a bank's income or underlying economic value.\nFor instance, the underlying economic value of a long position in 10-year government\nbonds hedged by a short position in 5-year government notes could decline sharply if the\nyield curve steepens, even if the position is hedged against parallel movements in the\nyield curve.\n3. Basis risk : Another important source of interest rate risk (commonly referred\nto as basis risk) arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned\nand paid on different instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics. When\ninterest rates change, these differences can give rise to unexpected changes in the cash\nflows and earnings spread between assets, liabilities and OBS instruments of similar\nmaturities or repricing frequencies. For example, a strategy of funding a one-year loan\nthat reprices monthly based on the one-month US. Treasury Bill rate, with a one-year\ndeposit that reprices monthly based on one-month Libor, exposes the institution to the\nrisk that the spread between the two index rates may change unexpectedly.\n4. Optionality : An additional and increasingly important source of interest rate\nrisk arises from the options embedded in many bank assets, liabilities and OBS\nportfolios. Formally, an option provides the holder the right, but not the obligation, to\nbuy, sell, or in some manner alter the cash flow of an instrument or financial contract.\nOptions may be stand-alone instruments such as exchange-traded options and over-the-\ncounter (OTC) contracts, or they may be embedded within otherwise standard\ninstruments. While banks use exchange-traded and OTC-options in both trading and non-\ntrading accounts, instruments with embedded options are generally most important in\nnon-trading activities. They include various types of bonds and notes with call or put\nprovisions, loans which give borrowers the right to prepay balances, and various types of\nnon-maturity deposit instruments which give depositors the right to withdraw funds at\nany time, often without any penalties. If not adequately managed, the asymmetrical\npayoff characteristics of instruments with optionality features can pose significant risk,\nparticularly to those who sell them, since the options held, both explicit and embedded,\nare generally exercised to the advantage of the holder and the disadvantage of the seller.\nMoreover, an increasing array of options can involve significant leverage which can56magnify the influences (both negative and positive) of option positions on the financial\ncondition of the firm.\n2.Effects of interest rate risk\n1. As the discussion above suggests, changes in interest rates can have adve rse\neffects both on a bank's earnings and its economic value. This has given rise to two\nseparate, but complementary, perspectives for assessing a bank's interest rate risk\nexposure.\n2. Earnings perspective : In the earnings perspective, the focus of analysis is the\nimpact of changes in interest rates on accrual or reported earnings. This is the traditional\napproach to interest rate risk assessment taken by many banks, particularly in the past.\nVariation in earnings is an important focal point for interest rate risk analysis because\nreduced earnings or outright losses can threaten the financial stability of an institution by\nundermining its capital adequacy, by shaking market confidence, and by weakening\nliquidity.\n3. In this regard, the component of earnings  that has traditionally received the\nmost attention is net interest income (i.e. the difference between total interest income and\ntotal interest expense). This focus reflects both the importance of net interest income in\nbanks' overall earnings and its direct and easily understood link to changes in interest\nrates. However, as banks have expanded increasingly into activities that generate fee-\nbased and other non-interest income, a broader focus on overall net income -\nincorporating both interest and non-interest income and expenses - has become more\ncommon. The non-interest income arising from many activities, such as loan servicing\nand various asset securitisation programmes, can be highly sensitive to market interest\nrates. For example, some banks provide the servicing and loan administration function for\nmortgage loan pools in return for a fee based on the volume of assets it administers.\nWhen interest rates fall, the servicing bank may experience a decline in its fee income as\nthe underlying mortgages prepay. In addition, even traditional sources of non-interest\nincome such as transaction processing fees are becoming more interest rate sensitive.\nThis increased sensitivity has led both bank management and supervisors to take a\nbroader view of the potential effects of changes in market interest rates on bank earnings.\n4. Economic value perspective : Variation in market interest rates can also affect\nthe economic value of a bank's assets, liabilities and OBS positions. Thus, the sensitivity\nof a bank's economic value to fluctuations in interest rates is a particularly important\nconsideration of shareholders, management and supervisors alike. The economic value of\nan instrument represents an assessment of the present value of its expected net cash\nflows, discounted to reflect market rates. By extension, the economic value of a bank can\nbe viewed as the present value of bank's expected net cash flows, defined as the expected\ncash flows on assets minus the expected cash flows on liabilities plus the expected net\ncash flows on OBS positions. In this sense, the economic value perspective reflects one\nview of the sensitivity of the net worth of the bank to fluctuations in interest rates.\n5. Since the economic value perspective considers the potential impact of\ninterest rate changes on the present value of all future cash flows, it provides a more\ncomprehensive view of the potential long-term effects of changes in interest rates than is57offered by the earnings perspective. This comprehensive view is important since changes\nin near-term earnings - the typical focus of the earnings perspective - may not provide an\naccurate indication of the impact of interest rate movements on the bank's overall\npositions.\n6. Embedded losses : The earnings and economic value perspectives discussed\nthus far focus on how future changes in interest rates may affect a bank's financial\nperformance. When evaluating the level of interest rate risk it is willing and able to\nassume, a bank should also consider the impact that past interest rates may have on future\nperformance. In particular, instruments that are not marked to market may already\ncontain embedded gains or losses due to past rate movements. These gains or losses may\nbe reflected over time in the bank's earnings. For example, a long-term fixed-rate loan\nentered into when interest rates were low and refunded more recently with liabilities\nbearing a higher rate of interest will, over its remaining life, represent a drain on the\nbank's resources.\nII. Sound interest rate risk management practices\n1. Sound interest rate risk management involves the application of four basic elements in\nthe management of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments:\n\u2022Appropriate board and senior management oversight ;\n\u2022Adequate risk management policies and procedures;\n\u2022Appropriate risk measurement and monitoring systems; and\n\u2022Comprehensive internal controls and independent external audits.\n2. The specific manner in  which a bank applies these elements in managing its interest\nrate risk will depend upon the complexity and nature of its holdings and activities as well as on the\nlevel of interest rate risk exposure. What constitutes adequate interest rate risk management\npractices can therefore vary considerably. For example, less complex banks whose senior managers\nare actively involved in the details of day-to-day operations may be able to rely on relatively basic\ninterest rate risk management processes. However, other organisations that have more complex and\nwide-ranging activities are likely to require more elaborate and formal interest rate risk\nmanagement processes, to address their broad range of financial activities and to provide senior\nmanagement with the information they need to monitor and direct day-to-day activities. Moreover,\nthe more complex interest rate risk management processes employed at such banks require\nadequate internal controls that include audits or other appropriate oversight mechanisms to ensure\nthe integrity of the information used by senior officials in overseeing compliance with policies and\nlimits. The individuals involved in the risk management process or the risk management units must\nbe sufficiently independent from the business lines to ensure an adequate separation of duties and\nthe avoidance of conflicts of interest.\n3. As with other risk factor categories, the Committee believes that interest rate risk\nshould be monitored on a consolidated basis, to include interest rate exposures in subsidiaries.\nHowever, while consolidation provides a comprehensive measure, in respect of interest rate risk it\nmay underestimate risk when positions in one affiliate offset positions in another. This is because a\nconventional accounting consolidation may allow theoretical offsets between such positions from\nwhich a bank may not in practice be able to benefit because of legal or operational constraints.\nManagement should recognise the potential for consolidated measures to understate risks in such\ncircumstances.\nIII. Board and senior management oversight of interest rate risk5\nEffective oversight by a bank's board of directors and senior management is\ncritical to a sound interest rate risk management process. It is essential that these58individuals are aware of their responsibilities with regard to interest rate risk management\nand that they adequately perform their roles in overseeing and managing interest rate risk.\n1.Board of directors\n1. The board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for understanding the\nnature and the level of interest rate risk taken by the bank. The board should approve\nbroad business strategies and significant policies that govern or influence the interest rate\nrisk of the bank. It should review the overall objectives of the bank with respect to\ninterest rate risk and should ensure the provision of clear guidance regarding the level of\ninterest rate risk acceptable to the bank. The board should also approve policies and\nprocedures that identify lines of authority and responsibility for managing interest rate\nrisk exposures.\n2. Accordingly, the board of directors is responsible for approving the overall\npolicies of the bank with respect to interest rate risk and for ensuring that management\ntakes the steps necessary to identify, measure, monitor, and control these risks. The board\nor a specific committee of the board should periodically review information that is\nsufficient in detail and timeliness to allow it to understand and assess the performance of\nmanagement in monitoring and controlling these risks in compliance with the bank's\nboard-approved policies. Such reviews should be conducted regularly, being carried out\nmore frequently where the bank holds significant positions in complex instruments. In\naddition, the board or one of its committees should periodically re-evaluate significant\ninterest rate risk management policies and procedures as well as overall business\nstrategies that affect the interest rate risk exposure of the bank.\n3. The board of directors should encourage discussions between its members\nand senior management - as well as between senior management and others in the bank -\nregarding the bank's interest rate risk exposures and management process. Board\nmembers need not have detailed technical knowledge of complex financial instruments,\nlegal issues, or of sophisticated risk management techniques. They have the\nresponsibility, however, to ensure that senior management has a full understanding of the\nrisks incurred by the bank and that the bank has personnel available who have the\nnecessary technical skills to control these risks.\nPrinciple 1:\nIn order to carry out its responsibilities, the board of directors in a bank should\napprove interest rate risk management policies and procedures, and should be\ninformed regularly of the interest rate risk exposure of the bank.\n2.Senior management\n1. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that the bank has adequate\npolicies and procedures for managing interest rate risk on both a long-term and day-to-\nday basis and that it maintains clear lines of authority and responsibility for managing\nand controlling this risk. Management is also responsible for maintaining:\n\u2022 appropriate limits on risk taking;\n\u2022 adequate systems and standards for measuring risk;59\u2022 standards for valuing positions and measuring performance;\n\u2022 a comprehensive interest rate risk reporting and interest rate risk management\nreview process; and\n\u2022 effective internal controls.\n2. Interest rate risk reports to senior management should provide aggregate\ninformation as well as sufficient supporting detail to enable management to assess the\nsensitivity of the institution to changes in market conditions and other important risk\nfactors. Senior management should also review periodically the organisation's interest\nrate risk management policies and procedures to ensure that they remain appropriate and\nsound. Senior management should also encourage and participate in discussions with\nmembers of the board and - where appropriate to the size and complexity of the bank -\nwith risk management staff regarding risk measurement, reporting and management\nprocedures.\n3. Management should ensure that analysis and risk management activities\nrelated to interest rate risk are conducted by competent staff with technical knowledge\nand experience consistent with the nature and scope of the bank's activities. There should\nbe sufficient depth in staff resources to manage these activities and to accommodate the\ntemporary absence of key personnel.\nPrinciple 2:\nSenior management must ensure that the structure of the bank's business and the\nlevel of interest rate risk it assumes are effectively managed, that appropriate\npolicies and procedures are established to control and limit these risks, and that\nresources are available for evaluating and controlling interest rate risk.\n3.Independent risk management function\n1. Banks should establish a risk management function for monitoring their\ninterest rate risk. This function should provide reasonable assurance that all activities and\nall aspects of interest rate risk are covered by a bank's risk management system. It should\nbe separated from and sufficiently independent of the business lines to avoid conflicts of\ninterest and ensure adequate separation of duties. The risk management function may be\npart of a more general operations, audit, compliance, risk management or treasury unit.\nMoreover, it should report risk exposures directly to both senior-level management and\nthe board of directors. The personnel charged with measuring and monitoring interest rate\nrisk should have a well-founded understanding of all the types of interest rate risk faced\nthroughout the bank. Compensation policies for these individuals should be adequate to\nattract and retain personnel qualified to assess the risk.\n2. Larger or more  complex banks should have a unit for designing and\nadministering a bank's interest rate risk management system. The size and scope of such a\nunit should be in accordance with the size and the structure of the bank. It should also be\ncommensurate with the volume and complexity of interest rate risk incurred by the bank\nand the complexity of its transactions and commitments.\nPrinciple 3:60Banks should have a risk management function with clearly defined duties that\nreports risk exposures directly to senior management and the board of directors and\nis sufficiently independent from the business lines of the bank. Larger or more\ncomplex banks should have units responsible for the design and administration of\nthe bank's interest rate risk management system.\nIV. Adequate risk management policies and procedures\n1. Banks should have clearly-defined policies and procedures for limiting and\ncontrolling interest rate risk. These policies should address the bank's exposures not only\non a consolidated basis but also, as appropriate, at specific affiliates or other units of the\nbank. Such policies and procedures should delineate lines of responsibility and\naccountability over interest rate risk management decisions and should clearly define\nauthorised instruments, hedging strategies and position-taking opportunities. Interest rate\nrisk policies should also identify quantitative parameters that define the level of interest\nrate risk acceptable for the bank. Where appropriate, such limits should be further\nspecified for certain types of instruments, portfolios, and activities. All interest rate risk\npolicies should be reviewed periodically and revised as needed.\n2. Management, whether through policies or operating procedures, should\ndefine the structure of managerial responsibilities and oversight, including lines of\nauthority and responsibility for developing strategies and tactics used in managing the\nbank's interest rate risk exposure. Individuals and/or committees responsible for interest\nrate risk management decisions should be clearly identified. In addition, management\nshould define the specific procedures and approvals necessary for exceptions to policies,\nlimits, and authorisations.\n3. A policy statement identifying the types of instruments and activities that the\nbank may employ or conduct is one means whereby management can communicate their\ntolerance of risk. If such a statement is prepared, it should clearly identify permissible\ninstruments, either specifically or by their characteristics, and should also describe the\npurposes or objectives for which they may be used. The statement should also delineate a\nclear set of institutional procedures for acquiring specific instruments, managing\nportfolios, and controlling the bank's aggregate interest rate risk exposure.\nPrinciple 4:\nIt is essential that banks' interest rate risk policies and procedures be clearly\ndefined and consistent with the nature and complexity of their activities. These\npolicies should address the bank's exposures on a consolidated basis and, as\nappropriate, also at the level of individual affiliates.\n4. Products and activities that are new to the bank should undergo a careful pre-\nacquisition review to ensure that the bank understands their interest rate risk\ncharacteristics and can incorporate them into its risk management process. When\nanalysing whether or not a product or activity introduces a new element of interest rate\nrisk exposure, the bank should be aware that changes to an instrument's maturity,\nrepricing or repayment terms can materially affect the product's interest rate risk\ncharacteristics. To take a simple example, a decision to buy and hold a 30-year treasury61bond would represent a significantly different interest rate risk strategy for a bank that\nhad previously limited its investment maturities to less than 3 years. Similarly, a bank\nspecialising in fixed-rate short-term commercial loans that then engages in residential\nfixed-rate mortgage lending should be aware of the optionality features of the risk\nembedded in many mortgage products that allow the borrower to prepay the loan at any\ntime with little, if any, penalty.\n5. Prior to introducing a new product, hedging, or position-taking strategy,\nmanagement should ensure that adequate operational procedures and risk control systems\nare in place. The board or its appropriate delegated committee should also approve major\nhedging or risk management initiatives in advance of their implementation. Proposals to\nundertake new instruments or new strategies should contain these features:\n\u2022 a description of the relevant product or strategy;\n\u2022 an identification of the resources required to establish sound and effective interest\nrate risk management of the product or activity;\n\u2022 an analysis of the reasonableness of the proposed activities in relation to the\nbank's overall financial condition and capital levels; and\n\u2022 the procedures to be used to measure, monitor and control the risks of the\nproposed product or activity.\nPrinciple 5:\nIt is important that banks identify the interest rate risks inherent in new products\nand activities and ensure these are subject to adequate procedures and controls\nbefore being introduced or undertaken. Major hedging or risk management\ninitiatives should be approved in advance by the board or its appropriate delegated\ncommittee.\nV. Risk measurement and monitoring system\nIn general, but depending on the complexity and range of activities of the\nindividual bank, banks should have interest rate risk measurement systems that assess the\neffects of rate changes on both earnings and economic value. These systems should\nprovide meaningful measures of a bank's current levels of interest rate risk exposure, and\nshould be capable of identifying any excessive exposures that might arise.\n1.Interest rate risk measurement\n1. Measurement systems should:\n\u2022 assess all material interest rate risk associated with a bank's assets,\nliabilities, and OBS positions;\n\u2022 utilise generally-accepted financial concepts and risk measurement\ntechniques; and\n\u2022 have well-documented assumptions and parameters.\n2. A bank's int erest rate risk measurement system should address all material\nsources of interest rate risk including repricing, yield curve, basis and option risk\nexposures. In many cases, the interest rate characteristics of a bank's largest holdings will\ndominate its aggregate risk profile. While all of a bank's holdings should receive62appropriate treatment, measurement systems should evaluate such concentrations with\nparticular rigor. Interest rate risk measurement systems should also provide rigorous\ntreatment of those instruments which might significantly affect a bank's aggregate\nposition, even if they do not represent a major concentration. Instruments with significant\nembedded or explicit option characteristics should receive special attention.\n3. A number of tech niques are available for measuring the interest rate risk\nexposure of both earnings and economic value. Their complexity ranges from simple\ncalculations to static simulations using current holdings to highly sophisticated dynamic\nmodelling techniques that reflect potential future business and business decisions.\n4. The simplest techniques for measuring a bank's interest rate risk exposure\nbegin with a maturity/repricing schedule that distributes interest-sensitive assets,\nliabilities and OBS positions into \"time-bands\" according to their maturity (if fixed rate)\nor time remaining to their next repricing (if floating rate). These schedules can be used to\ngenerate simple indicators of the interest rate risk sensitivity of both earnings and\neconomic value to changing interest rates. When this approach is used to assess the\ninterest rate risk of current earnings, it is typically referred to as gap analysis . The size of\nthe gap for a given time-band - that is, assets minus liabilities plus OBS exposures that\nreprice or mature within that time-band -gives an indication of the bank's repricing risk\nexposure.\n5. A maturity/repricing schedule can also be used to evaluate the effects of\nchanging interest rates on a bank's economic value by applying sensitivity weights to\neach time-band. Typically, such weights are based on estimates of the duration of the\nassets and liabilities that fall into each time-band, where duration is a measure of the\npercent change in the economic value of a position that will occur given a small change\nin the level of interest rates. Duration-based weights can be used in combination with a\nmaturity/repricing schedule to provide a rough approximation of the change in a bank's\neconomic value that would occur given a particular set of changes in market interest\nrates.\n6. Many banks (especially those using complex financial instruments or\notherwise having complex risk profiles) employ more sophisticated interest rate risk\nmeasurement systems than those based on simple maturity/repricing schedules. These\nsimulation techniques typically involve detailed assessments of the potential effects of\nchanges in interest rates on earnings and economic value by simulating the future path of\ninterest rates and their impact on cash flows. In static simulations, the cash flows arising\nsolely from the bank's current on-and off-balance-sheet positions are assessed. In a\ndynamic simulation approach, the simulation builds in more detailed assumptions about\nthe future course of interest rates and expected changes in a bank's business activity over\nthat time. These more sophisticated techniques allow for dynamic interaction of payments\nstreams and interest rates, and better capture the effect of embedded or explicit options.\n7. Regardless of the measurement system, the usef ulness of each technique\ndepends on the validity of the underlying assumptions and the accuracy of the basic\nmethodologies used to model interest rate risk exposure. In designing interest rate risk\nmeasurement systems, banks should ensure that the degree of detail about the nature of\ntheir interest-sensitive positions is commensurate with the complexity and risk inherent in\nthose positions. For instance, using gap analysis, the precision of interest rate risk63measurement depends in part on the number of time-bands into which positions are\naggregated. Clearly, aggregation of positions/cash flows into broad time-bands implies\nsome loss of precision. In practice, the bank must assess the significance of the potential\nloss of precision in determining the extent of aggregation and simplification to be built\ninto the measurement approach.\n8. Estimates of interest rate risk exposure, whether linked to earnings or\neconomic value, utilise, in some form, forecasts of the potential course of future interest\nrates. For risk management purposes, banks should incorporate a change in interest rates\nthat is sufficiently large to encompass the risks attendant to their holdings. Banks should\nconsider the use of multiple scenarios, including potential effects in changes in the\nrelationships among interest rates (i.e. yield curve risk and basis risk) as well as changes\nin the general level of interest rates. For determining probable changes in interest rates,\nsimulation techniques could, for example, be used. Statistical analysis can also play an\nimportant role in evaluating correlation assumptions with respect to basis or yield curve\nrisk.\n9. The integrity and timeliness of data on current positions is also a key\ncomponent of the risk measurement process. A bank should ensure that all material\npositions and cash flows, whether stemming from on- or off-balance-sheet positions, are\nincorporated into the measurement system on a timely basis. Where applicable, these data\nshould include information on the coupon rates or cash flows of associated instruments\nand contracts. Any manual adjustments to underlying data should be clearly documented,\nand the nature and reasons for the adjustments should be clearly understood. In particular,\nany adjustments to expected cash flows for expected prepayments or early redemptions\nshould be well-reasoned and such adjustments should be available for review.\n10. In assessing the results of interest rate risk measurement systems, it is\nimportant that the assumptions underlying the system be clearly understood by risk\nmanagers and bank management. In particular, techniques using sophisticated\nsimulations should be used carefully so that they do not become \"black boxes\", producing\nnumbers that have the appearance of precision, but that in fact are not very accurate when\ntheir specific assumptions and parameters are revealed. Key assumptions should be\nrecognised by senior management and risk managers and should be re-evaluated at least\nannually. They should also be clearly documented and their significance understood.\nAssumptions used in assessing the interest rate sensitivity of complex instruments and\ninstruments with uncertain maturities should be subject to particularly rigorous\ndocumentation and review.\n11. When measuring interest rate risk exposure, two fu rther aspects call for more\nspecific comment: the treatment of those positions where behavioural maturity differs\nfrom contractual maturity and the treatment of positions denominated in different\ncurrencies. Positions such as savings and sight deposits may have contractual maturities\nor may be open-ended, but in either case, depositors generally have the option to make\nwithdrawals at any time. In addition, banks often choose not to move rates paid on these\ndeposits in line with changes in market rates. These factors complicate the measurement\nof interest rate risk exposure, since not only the value of the positions but also the timing\nof their cash flows can change when interest rates vary. With respect to banks' assets,\nprepayment features of mortgages and mortgage-related instruments also introduce\nuncertainty about the timing of cash flows on these positions. These issues are described64in more detail in Annex A, which forms an integral part of this text.\n12. Banks with positions denominated in different cu rrencies can expose\nthemselves to interest rate risk in each of these currencies. Since yield curves vary from\ncurrency to currency, banks generally need to assess exposures in each. Banks with the\nnecessary skills and sophistication, and with material multi-currency exposures, may\nchoose to include in their risk measurement process methods to aggregate their exposures\nin different currencies using assumptions about the correlation between interest rates in\ndifferent currencies. A bank that uses correlation assumptions to aggregate their risk\nexposures should periodically review the stability and accuracy of those assumptions.\nThe bank also should evaluate what its potential risk exposure would be in the event that\nsuch correlations break down.\nPrinciple 6:\nIt is essential that banks have interest rate risk measurement systems that capture\nall material sources of interest rate risk and that assess the effect of interest rate\nchanges in ways which are consistent with the scope of their activities. The\nassumptions underlying the system should be clearly understood by risk managers\nand bank management.\n2.Limits\n1. The goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a bank's interest rate\nrisk exposure within self-imposed parameters over a range of possible changes in interest\nrates. A system of interest rate risk limits and risk-taking guidelines provides the means\nfor achieving that goal. Such a system should set boundaries for the level of interest rate\nrisk for the bank and, where appropriate, should also provide the capability to allocate\nlimits to individual portfolios, activities or business units. Limit systems should also\nensure that positions that exceed certain predetermined levels receive prompt\nmanagement attention. An appropriate limit system should enable management to control\ninterest rate risk exposures, initiate discussion about opportunities and risks, and monitor\nactual risk-taking against predetermined risk tolerances.\n2. A bank's limits should be consistent with its overall approach to me asuring\ninterest rate risk. Aggregate interest rate risk limits clearly articulating the amount of\ninterest rate risk acceptable to the bank should be approved by the board of directors and\nre-evaluated periodically. Such limits should be appropriate to the size, complexity and\ncapital adequacy of the bank. Depending on the nature of a bank's holdings and its\ngeneral sophistication, limits can also be identified with individual business units,\nportfolios, instrument types or specific instruments. The level of detail of risk limits\nshould reflect the characteristics of the bank's holdings including the various sources of\ninterest rate risk to which the bank is exposed.\n3. Limit exceptions should be made known to appropriate senior management\nwithout delay. There should be a clear policy as to how senior management will be\ninformed and what action should be taken by management in such cases. Particularly\nimportant is whether limits are absolute in the sense that they should never be exceeded\nor whether, under specific circumstances, which should be clearly described, breaches of\nlimits can be tolerated  for a short period of time. In that context, the relative65conservatism of the chosen limits may be an important factor.\n4. Regardless of their level of aggregati on, limits should be consistent with the\nbank's overall approach to measuring interest rate risk and should address the potential\nimpact of changes in market interest rates on reported earnings and the bank's economic\nvalue of equity. From an earnings perspective, banks should explore limits on the\nvariability of net income as well as net interest income in order to fully assess the\ncontribution of non-interest income to the interest rate risk exposure of the bank. Such\nlimits usually specify acceptable levels of earnings volatility under specified interest rate\nscenarios.\n5. The form of limits for addressing the effect of rates on a bank's economic\nvalue of equity should be appropriate for the size and complexity of its underlying\npositions. For banks engaged in traditional banking activities and with few holdings of\nlong-term instruments, options, instruments with embedded options, or other instruments\nwhose value may be substantially altered given changes in market rates, relatively simple\nlimits on the extent of such holdings may suffice. For more complex banks, however,\nmore detailed limit systems on acceptable changes in the estimated economic value of\nequity of the bank may be needed.\n6. Interest rate risk limits may be keyed to specific scenarios of mo vements in\nmarket interest rates, such as an increase or decrease of a particular magnitude. The rate\nmovements used in developing these limits should represent meaningful stress situations,\ntaking into account historic rate volatility and the time required for management to\naddress exposures. Limits may also be based on measures derived from the underlying\nstatistical distribution of interest rates, such as earnings at risk or economic value-at-risk\ntechniques. Moreover, specified scenarios should take account of the full range of\npossible sources of interest rate risk to the bank including mismatch, yield curve, basis\nand option risks. Simple scenarios using parallel shifts in interest rates may be\ninsufficient to identify such risks.\nPrinciple 7:\nBanks must establish and enforce operating limits and other practices that maintain\nexposures within levels consistent with their internal policies.\n3.Stress testing\nThe risk measurement system should also support a meaningful evaluation of\nthe effect of stressful market conditions on the bank. Stress testing should be designed to\nprovide information on the kinds of conditions under which the bank's strategies or\npositions would be most vulnerable, and thus may be tailored to the risk characteristics of\nthe bank. Possible stress scenarios might include abrupt changes in the general level of\ninterest rates, changes in the relationships among key market rates (i.e. basis risk),\nchanges in the slope and the shape of the yield curve (i.e. yield curve risk), changes in the\nliquidity of key financial markets or changes in the volatility of market rates. In addition,\nstress scenarios should include conditions under which key business assumptions and\nparameters break down. The stress testing of assumptions used for illiquid instruments\nand instruments with uncertain contractual maturities is particularly critical to achieving\nan understanding of the bank's risk profile. In conducting stress tests, special\nconsideration should be given to instruments or markets where concentrations exist as66such positions may be more difficult to liquidate in stressful situations. Banks should\nconsider \"worst-case\" scenarios in addition to more probable, but less extreme, events.\nManagement and the board of directors should periodically review both the design and\nthe results of such stress tests, and ensure that appropriate contingency plans are in place.\nPrinciple 8:\nBanks should measure their vulnerability to loss under stressful market conditions -\nincluding the breakdown of key assumptions - and consider those results when\nestablishing and reviewing their policies and limits for interest rate risk.\n4.Interest rate risk monitoring and reporting\n1. An accurate, informative, and timely management information system is\nessential for managing interest rate risk exposure, both to inform management and to\nsupport compliance with board policy. Reporting of risk measures should be regular and\nshould clearly compare current exposure to policy limits. In addition, past forecasts or\nrisk estimates should be compared with actual results to identify any modelling\nshortcomings.\n2. Reports detailing the interest rate risk exposure of the bank should be\nreviewed by the board on a regular basis. While the types of reports prepared for the\nboard and for various levels of management will vary based on the bank's interest rate\nrisk profile, they should, at a minimum include the following:\n\u2022 summaries of the bank's aggregate exposures;\n\u2022 reports demonstrating the bank's compliance with policies and limits;\n\u2022 results of stress tests including those assessing breakdowns in key assumptions\nand parameters; and\n\u2022 summaries of the findings of reviews of interest rate risk policies, procedures, and\nthe adequacy of the interest rate risk measurement systems, including any findings\nof internal and external auditors and retained consultants.\nPrinciple 9:\nBanks must have adequate information systems for monitoring and reporting\ninterest rate exposures to senior management and boards of directors on a timely\nbasis.\nVI. Comprehensive controls\n1. A bank's interest rate risk management process should be an extension of its\noverall structure of internal controls. Properly structured, a system of internal controls\nshould promote effective and efficient operations, reliable financial and regulatory\nreporting, and compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and institutional policies. In\ndetermining whether internal controls meet those objectives, banks should consider the\ngeneral control environment of the organisation; the process for identifying, analysing\nand managing interest rate risk; the adequacy of management information systems; and\nadherence to control activities such as approvals, confirmations and reconciliations.\n2. An important element of a bank's internal controls involving in terest rate risk\nis comprehensive evaluation and review by management. Management should ensure that67the various components of the bank's interest rate risk management process are regularly\nreviewed and evaluated by individuals who are independent of the function they are\nassigned to review. Although procedures for establishing limits and for operating within\nthem may vary among banks, periodic reviews should be conducted to determine whether\nthe organisation complies with its interest rate risk policies and procedures. Positions that\nexceed established limits should receive the prompt attention of appropriate management\nand should be resolved according to the process described in approved policies. Periodic\nreviews of the interest rate risk management process should also address any significant\nchanges in the nature of instruments acquired, limits, and internal controls that have\noccurred since the last review.\nPrinciple 10:\nBanks must have adequate internal controls for their interest rate risk management\nprocess and should evaluate the adequacy and integrity of those controls\nperiodically. Individuals responsible for evaluating control procedures must be\nindependent of the function they are assigned to review.\n3. Reviews of the interest rate risk measurement system should include\nassessments of the assumptions, parameters, and methodologies used. Such reviews\nshould seek to understand, test, and document the current measurement process, evaluate\nthe system's accuracy, and recommend solutions to any identified weaknesses. The\nresults of this review, along with any recommendations for improvement, should be\nreported to the board and acted upon in a timely manner. Since measurement systems\nmay incorporate one or more subsidiary systems or processes, banks should ensure that\nmultiple component systems are well-integrated and consistent with each other in all\ncritical respects.\n4. The frequency and extent to which a bank should re-evaluate its risk\nmeasurement methodologies and models depends, in part, on the particular interest rate\nrisk exposures created by holdings and activities, the pace and nature of market interest\nrate changes, and the pace of innovation with respect to measuring and managing interest\nrate risk. At a minimum banks should review their underlying interest rate risk\nmeasurement methodologies and interest rate risk management process annually - and\nmore frequently as market conditions dictate.\n5. Banks, particularly those with complex risk exposures, are encouraged to\nhave their measurement systems reviewed by external auditors or other knowledgeable\noutside parties. In such cases, reports written by external auditors or other outside parties\nshould be available to relevant supervisory authorities. It is essential that any external\nreviewer be assured that the bank's risk measurement system is sufficient to capture all\nmaterial elements of interest rate risk. Such a reviewer should consider the following\nfactors in making the risk assessment, (which are, of course, also relevant to internal\nreviews):\n\u2022 the quantity of interest rate risk, for example:\n- the volume and price sensitivity of various products;\n-  the vulnerability of earnings and capital under differing rate changes including\nyield curve twists;68- the exposure of earnings and economic value to various other forms of interest\nrate risk, including basis and optionality risk.\n\u2022 the quality of interest rate risk management, for example:\n- whether the bank's internal measurement system is appropriate to the nature,\nscope, and complexities of the bank and its activities;\n- whether the bank has an independent risk control unit responsible for the design\nof the risk management system;\n- whether the board of directors and senior management is actively involved in the\nrisk control process;\n- whether internal policies, controls and procedures concerning interest rate risk are\nwell-documented and complied with;\n- whether the assumptions of the risk management system are well-documented,\ndata are accurately processed, and data aggregation is proper and reliable;\n- whether the organisation has adequate staffing to conduct a sound risk\nmanagement process.\nPrinciple 11:\nBanks should periodically conduct an independent review of the adequacy and\nintegrity of their risk management processes. Such reviews should be available to\nrelevant supervisory authorities.\nVII. Monitoring of interest rate risk by supervisory authorities\n1. Supervisory authorities should, on a regular basis, obtain sufficient\ninformation to assess individual banks' interest rate risk exposures. Such information\ncould be obtained through standardised reports that are submitted by banks , through on-\nsite examinations, or by other means. The precise information obtained could differ\namong supervisors, but should enable the supervisor to assess the level and direction of a\nbank's interest rate exposure. Such information may be generated from the bank's internal\nmeasures or from more standardised reports. As a minimum, supervisors should have\nenough information to identify and monitor banks that have significant repricing\nmismatches.\n2. A supervisory reporting framework that collects information on a bank's\npositions by remaining maturity or time to next repricing is one method that supervisors\nmay use for this purpose. Under such an approach, a bank would categorise its interest-\nsensitive assets, liabilities and OBS positions into a series of repricing time-bands or\nmaturity categories. In addition, the information should identify the balances by specific\ntypes of instruments that differ significantly in their cash flow characteristics. For\nexample, supervisors may want to collect additional information on those positions,\nwhere the behavioural maturity is different from the contractual maturity. Reviewing the\nresults of a bank's internal model, perhaps under a variety of different assumptions, can\nalso be highly informative.\n3. Banks operating in different currencies can expose themselves to interest rate\nrisk in each of these currencies. Supervisory authorities, therefore, may want banks to\nanalyse their exposures in different currencies separately, at least when exposures in69different currencies are material.\n4. Another difficult question is the extent to which interest rate risk should be\nviewed on a whole bank basis or whether the trading book, which is marked to market,\nand the banking book, which is often not, should be treated separately. As a general rule,\nit is desirable for any measurement system to incorporate interest rate risk exposures\narising from the full scope of a bank's activities, including both trading and non-trading\nsources. Supervisors may want to obtain more specific information on how trading and\nnon-trading activities are measured in a bank and whether they are incorporated into a\nsingle measurement system. They should also ensure that interest rate risk in both trading\nand non-trading activities is properly managed and controlled.\n5. A meaningful analysis of interest rate risk is only possible if the supervisor\nreceives the relevant information regularly and on a timely basis. Since the risk profile in\nthe traditional banking business changes less rapidly than in the trading business,\nquarterly or semi-annual reporting of the former may be sufficient for many banks. Some\nof the factors that supervisors may wish to consider when designing a specific reporting\nframework are described in greater detail in Annex B, which forms an integral part of this\ntext.\nPrinciple 12:\nThe G-10 supervisory authorities will obtain from banks sufficient and timely\ninformation with which to evaluate their level of interest rate risk. This information\nshould take appropriate account of the range of maturities and currencies in each\nbank's portfolio, as well as other relevant factors, such as the distinction between\ntrading and non-trading activities. Other supervisory authorities are recommended\nto obtain similar information.\nAnnex A\nInterest rate risk measurement techniques\n1. This annex provides a brief overview of the various techniques used by banks\nto measure the exposure of earnings and of economic value to changes in interest rates.\nThe variety of the techniques ranges from calculations that rely on simple maturity and\nrepricing tables, to static simulations based on current on- and off-balance-sheet\npositions, to highly sophisticated dynamic modelling  techniques that incorporate\nassumptions about the behaviour  of the bank and its customers in response to changes in\nthe interest rate environment. Some of these general approaches can be used to measure\ninterest rate risk exposure from both an earnings and an economic value perspective,\nwhile others are more typically associated with only one of these two perspectives. In\naddition, the methods vary in their ability to capture the different forms of interest rate\nexposure: the simplest methods are intended primarily to capture the risks arising from\nmaturity and repricing mismatches, while the more sophisticated methods can more\neasily capture the full range of risk exposures.\n2. As this discussion suggests, the various measurement approaches described\nbelow have their strengths and weaknesses in terms of providing accurate and reasonable70measures of interest rate risk exposure. Ideally, a bank's interest rate risk measurement\nsystem would take into account the specific characteristics of each individual interest-\nsensitive position, and would capture in detail the full range of potential movements in\ninterest rates. In practice, however, measurement systems embody simplifications that\nmove away from this ideal. For instance, in some approaches, positions may be\naggregated into broad categories, rather than modelled separately, introducing a degree of\nmeasurement error into the estimation of their interest rate sensitivity. Similarly, the\nnature of interest rate movements that each approach can incorporate may be limited: in\nsome cases, only a parallel shift of the yield curve may be assumed or less than perfect\ncorrelations between interest rates may not be taken into account. Finally, the various\napproaches differ in their ability to capture the optionality inherent in many positions and\ninstruments. The discussion in the following sections will highlight the areas of\nsimplification that typically characterise each of the major interest rate risk measurement\ntechniques.\n1.Repricing schedules\n1. The simplest technique s for measuring a bank's interest rate risk exposure\nbegin with a maturity/repricing schedule that distributes interest-sensitive assets,\nliabilities and off-balance-sheet positions into a certain number of predefined time-bands\naccording to their maturity (if fixed rate) or time remaining to their next repricing (if\nfloating rate). Those assets and liabilities lacking definitive repricing intervals (e.g. sight\ndeposits or savings accounts) or actual maturities that could vary from contractual\nmaturities (e.g. mortgages with an option for early repayment) are assigned to repricing\ntime-bands according to the judgement and past experience of the bank.\n2. Gap analysis : Simple maturity/repricing schedules can be used to generate\nsimple indicators of the interest rate risk sensitivity of both earnings and economic value\nto changing interest rates. When this approach is used to assess the interest rate risk of\ncurrent earnings, it is typically referred to as gap analysis. Gap analysis was one of the\nfirst methods developed to measure a bank's interest rate risk exposure, and continues to\nbe widely used by banks. To evaluate earnings exposure, interest rate sensitive liabilities\nin each time-band are subtracted from the corresponding interest rate sensitive assets to\nproduce a repricing \"gap\" for that time-band. This gap can be multiplied by an assumed\nchange in interest rates to yield an approximation of the change in net interest income\nthat would result from such an interest rate movement. The size of the interest rate\nmovement used in the analysis can be based on a variety of factors, including historical\nexperience, simulation of potential future interest rate movements, and the judgement of\nbank management.\n3. A negative, or liability-sensitive, gap occurs when liabilities exceed assets\n(including off-balance-sheet positions) in a given time-band. This means that an increase\nin market interest rates could cause a decline in net interest income. Conversely, a\npositive, or asset-sensitive, gap implies that the bank's net interest income could decline\nas a result of a decrease in the level of interest rates.\n4. These simple gap calculations can be augmented by information on the\naverage coupon on assets and liabilities in each time-band. This information can be used\nto place the results of the gap calculations in context. For instance, information on the71average coupon rate could be used to calculate estimates of the level of net interest\nincome arising from positions maturing or repricing within a given time-band, which\nwould then provide a \"scale\" to assess the changes in income implied by the gap analysis.\n5. Although gap analysis is a very commonly used approach to assessing\ninterest rate risk exposure, it has a number of shortcomings. First, gap analysis does not\ntake account of variation in the characteristics of different positions within a time-band.\nIn particular, all positions within a given time-band are assumed to mature or reprice\nsimultaneously, a simplification that is likely to have greater impact on the precision of\nthe estimates as the degree of aggregation within a time-band increases. Moreover, gap\nanalysis ignores differences in spreads between interest rates that could arise as the level\nof market interest rates changes (basis risk). In addition, it does not take into account any\nchanges in the timing of payments that might occur as a result of changes in the interest\nrate environment. Thus, it fails to account for differences in the sensitivity of income that\nmay arise from option-related positions. For these reasons, gap analysis provides only a\nrough approximation to the actual change in net interest income which would result from\nthe chosen change in the pattern of interest rates. Finally, most gap analyses fail to\ncapture variability in non-interest revenue and expenses, a potentially important source of\nrisk to current income.\n6. Duration : A maturity/repricing schedule can also be used to evaluate the\neffects of changing interest rates on a bank's economic value by applying sensitivity\nweights to each time-band. Typically, such weights are based on estimates of the duration\nof the assets and liabilities that fall into each time-band. Duration is a measure of the\npercent change in the economic value of a position that will occur given a small change\nin the level of interest rates.6 It reflects the timing and size of cash flows that occur before\nthe instrument's contractual maturity. Generally, the longer the maturity or next repricing\ndate of the instrument and the smaller the payments that occur before maturity (e.g.\ncoupon payments), the higher the duration (in absolute value). Higher duration implies\nthat a given change in the level of interest rates will have a larger impact on economic\nvalue.\n7. Duration-based weights can be used in combination  with a maturity/repricing\nschedule to provide a rough approximation of the change in a bank's economic value that\nwould occur given a particular change in the level of market interest rates. Specifically,\nan \"average\" duration is assumed for the positions that fall into each time-band. The\naverage durations are then multiplied by an assumed change in interest rates to construct\na weight for each time-band. In some cases, different weights are used for different\npositions that fall within a time-band, reflecting broad differences in the coupon rates and\nmaturities (for instance, one weight for assets, and another for liabilities). In addition,\ndifferent interest rate changes are sometimes used for different time-bands, generally to\nreflect differences in the volatility of interest rates along the yield curve. The weighted\ngaps are aggregated across time-bands to produce an estimate of the change in economic\nvalue of the bank that would result from the assumed changes in interest rates.\n8. Alternatively, an in stitution could estimate the effect of changing market rates\nby calculating the precise duration of each asset, liability and off-balance-sheet position\nand then deriving the net position for the bank based on these more accurate measures,\nrather than by applying an estimated average duration weight to all positions in a given72time-band. This would eliminate potential errors occurring when aggregating\npositions/cash flows. As another variation, risk weights could also be designed for each\ntime-band on the basis of actual percent changes in market values of hypothetical\ninstruments that would result from a specific scenario of changing market rates. That\napproach - which is sometimes referred to as effective duration - would better capture the\nnon-linearity of price movements arising from significant changes in market interest rates\nand, thereby, would avoid an important limitation of duration.\n9. Estimates derived from a standard duration approach may provide an\nacceptable approximation of a bank's exposure to changes in economic value for\nrelatively non-complex banks. Such estimates, however, generally focus on just one form\nof interest rate risk exposure - repricing risk. As a result, they may not reflect interest rate\nrisk arising - for instance - from changes in the relationship among interest rates within a\ntime-band (basis risk). In addition, because such approaches typically use an average\nduration for each time-band, the estimates will not reflect differences in the actual\nsensitivity of positions that can arise from differences in coupon rates and the timing of\npayments. Finally, the simplifying assumptions that underlie the calculation of standard\nduration means that the risk of options may not be well-captured.\n2.Simulation approaches\n1. Many banks ( especially those using complex financial instruments or\notherwise having complex risk profiles) employ more sophisticated interest rate risk\nmeasurement systems than those based on simple maturity/repricing schedules. These\nsimulation techniques typically involve detailed assessments of the potential effects of\nchanges in interest rates on earnings and economic value by simulating the future path of\ninterest rates and their impact on cash flows.\n2. In some sense, simulation techniques can be seen as an exte nsion and\nrefinement of the simple analysis based on maturity/repricing schedules. However,\nsimulation approaches typically involve a more detailed breakdown of various categories\nof on- and off-balance-sheet positions, so that specific assumptions about the interest and\nprincipal payments and non-interest income and expense arising from each type of\nposition can be incorporated. In addition, simulation techniques can incorporate more\nvaried and refined changes in the interest rate environment, ranging from changes in the\nslope and shape of the yield curve to interest rate scenarios derived from Monte Carlo\nsimulations.\n3. In static simulations , the cash flows arising solely from the bank's current on-\nand off-balance-sheet positions are assessed. For assessing the exposure of earnings,\nsimulations estimating the cash flows and resulting earnings streams over a specific\nperiod are conducted based on one or more assumed interest rate scenarios. Typically,\nalthough not always, these simulations entail relatively straightforward shifts or tilts of\nthe yield curve, or changes of spreads between different interest rates. When the resulting\ncash flows are simulated over the entire expected lives of the bank's holdings and\ndiscounted back to their present values, an estimate of the change in the bank's economic\nvalue can be calculated.7734. In a dynamic simulation  approach, the simulation builds in more detailed\nassumptions about the future course of interest rates and the expected changes in a bank's\nbusiness activity over that time. For instance, the simulation could involve assumptions\nabout a bank's strategy for changing administered interest rates (on savings deposits, for\nexample), about the behaviour of the bank's customers (e.g. withdrawals from sight and\nsavings deposits) and/or about the future stream of business (new loans or other\ntransactions) that the bank will encounter. Such simulations use these assumptions about\nfuture activities and reinvestment strategies to project expected cash flows and estimate\ndynamic earnings and economic value outcomes. These more sophisticated techniques\nallow for dynamic interaction of payments stream and interest rates, and better capture\nthe effect of embedded or explicit options.\n5. As with other approaches, the usefulness of simulation-based interest rate risk\nmeasurement techniques depends on the validity of the underlying assumptions and the\naccuracy of the basic methodology. The output of sophisticated simulations must be\nassessed largely in the light of the validity of the simulation's assumptions about future\ninterest rates and the behaviour of the bank and its customers. One of the primary\nconcerns that arises is that such simulations do not become \"black boxes\" that lead to\nfalse confidence in the precision of the estimates.\n3.Additional issues\n1. One of the most difficult tasks when measuring interest rate risk is how to\ndeal with those positions where behavioural maturity differs from contractual maturity\n(or where there is no stated contractual maturity). On the asset side of the balance sheet,\nsuch positions may include mortgages and mortgage-related securities, which can be\nsubject to prepayment. In some countries, borrowers have the discretion to prepay their\nmortgages with little or no penalty, a situation that creates uncertainty about the timing of\nthe cash flows associated with these instruments. Although there is always some\nvolatility in prepayments resulting from demographic factors (such as death, divorce, or\njob transfers) and macroeconomic conditions, most of the uncertainty surrounding\nprepayments arises from the response of borrowers to movements in interest rates. In\ngeneral, declines in interest rates result in increasing levels of prepayments, as borrowers\nrefinance their loans at lower yields. In contrast, when interest rates rise unexpectedly,\nprepayment rates tend to slow, leaving the bank with a larger than anticipated volume of\nmortgages paying below current market rates.\n2. On the liability side, such positions include so-called non-maturity dep osits\nsuch as sight deposits and savings deposits, which can be withdrawn, often without\npenalty, at the discretion of the depositor. The treatment of such deposits is further\ncomplicated by the fact that the rates received by depositors tend not to move in close\ncorrelation with changes in the general level of market interest rates. In fact, banks can\nand do administer the rates on the accounts with the specific intention of managing the\nvolume of deposits retained.743. The treatment of positions with embed ded options is an issue of special\nconcern in measuring the exposure of both current earnings and economic value to\ninterest rate changes. In addition, the issue arises across the full spectrum of approaches\nto interest rate measurement, from simple gap analysis to the most sophisticated\nsimulation techniques. In the maturity/repricing schedule framework, banks typically\nmake assumptions about the likely timing of payments and withdrawals on these\npositions and \"spread\" the balances across time-bands accordingly. For instance, it might\nbe assumed that certain percentages of a pool of 30-year mortgages prepay in given years\nduring the life of the mortgages. As a result, a large share of the mortgage balances that\nwould have been assigned to the time-band containing 30-year instruments would be\nspread among nearer term time-bands. In the simulation framework, more sophisticated\nbehavioural assumptions could be employed, such as the use of option-adjusted pricing\nmodels to better estimate the timing and magnitude of cash flows under different interest\nrate environments. In addition, the simulations can incorporate the bank's assumptions\nabout its likely future treatment of administered interest rates on non-maturity deposits.\n4. As with other elements of interest  rate risk measurement, the quality of the\nestimates of interest rate risk exposure depends on the quality of the assumptions about\nthe future cash flows on the positions with uncertain maturities. Banks typically look to\nthe past behaviour of such positions for guidance about these assumptions. For instance,\neconometric or statistical analysis can be used to analyse the behaviour of a bank's\nholdings in response to past interest rate movements. Such analysis is particularly useful\nto assess the likely behaviour of non-maturity deposits, which can be influenced by bank-\nspecific factors such as the nature of the bank's customers and local or regional market\nconditions. In the same vein, banks may use statistical prepayment models - either\nmodels developed internally by the bank or models purchased from outside developers -\nto generate expectations about mortgage-related cash flows. Finally, input from\nmanagerial and business units within the bank could have an important influence, since\nthese areas may be aware of planned changes to business or repricing strategies that could\naffect the behaviour of the future cash flows of positions with uncertain maturities.\nAnnex B\nMonitoring of interest rate risk by supervisory authorities\n1. This annex provides a brief ov erview of some of the factors that supervisory\nauthorities might consider in obtaining and analysing information on individual banks'\nexposures to interest rate risk. As discussed in Section VII of the text, supervisory\nauthorities should obtain information sufficient to assess banks' exposures to interest rate\nrisk in a timely fashion. Such information may be obtained through on-site examinations,\nthrough reports that are submitted by banks on a regular basis, or through other means.\n2. While the precise i nformation that is obtained will differ across supervisory\nauthorities, one approach that some may adopt is a reporting framework that collects\ninformation on a bank's positions by remaining maturity or time to next repricing. Under\nsuch an approach, a bank would categorise its interest-sensitive assets, liabilities and off-\nbalance-sheet positions into a series of repricing time-bands or maturity categories. The\ntwo sections that follow discuss the considerations that a supervisor should take into75account in specifying the number of time-bands and the grouping of positions in the\nreporting framework. The final section of this annex describes some general approaches\nthat supervisory authorities may wish to consider in analysing the information that is\nobtained through such a reporting framework.\n1.Time-bands\n1. If a reporting framework is used in which information is collected by time to\nnext repricing, the number and specific categories of time-bands chosen should be\nsufficient to provide supervisors with a reasonable basis for identifying potentially\nsignificant repricing mismatches. The bands, however, could vary materially across\ncountries, both in number and in range, depending on the lending and investing practices\nand experiences of banks in individual markets.\n2. The accuracy of a measurement system crucially depends on the precision\nwith which maturities of the positions and cash flows are recorded in the system. For cash\nflows whose maturity is unambiguous, the most precise approach is to use the exact\nmaturity date. Any aggregation of positions/cash flows in time-bands or zones necessarily\nimplies a loss of information and a lower degree of precision. For this reason, the number\nof time-bands in a maturity ladder framework always reflects a decision regarding the\nnecessary level of precision and the cost of pursuing greater accuracy. Supervisory\nauthorities could use the maturity ladder in the standardised approach of the Amendment\nto the Capital Accord as a starting point when developing a reporting framework that\nmeets their particular needs. The breakdown can, of course, be modified by regulators\neither in a general way or in a specific way for banks where the nature of business\nactivities warrants or justifies a different reporting form.\n2.Items\n1. As with the time-bands, the breakdown of assets and liabilities could differ\namong supervisors. A reporting system should include information for all rate-sensitive\nassets, liabilities and OBS positions, and should also identify balances, by specific types\nof instruments, when those instruments have or may have materially different cash flow\ncharacteristics. Specific attention should be given to items whose behavioural maturities\ndiffer from contractual maturities such as savings deposits and in some countries\nmortgage-related instruments. Further information on these issues is provided in Annex\nA. If the volume of these positions is significant, they should be reported separately so as\nto facilitate an assessment of the underlying options risk in the bank balance sheet\nstructure.\n2. The measurement of interest rate risks may be more difficult if a bank is\nengaged in trading activities. As a general rule, it is desirable for any measurement\nsystem to incorporate interest rate risk exposures arising from the full scope of a bank's\nactivities, including both trading and non-trading sources. Supervisors may wish to\npermit banks that manage their interest rate risk exposures on an integrated basis to\naggregate trading and non-trading positions in the overall reporting framework.\nNevertheless, it is important to recognise that in many countries different accounting\nrules may apply to the trading book and the traditional banking book. Under these76accounting rules, losses in the trading book may not always be offset by profits in the\nbanking book if the latter are unrealised. Furthermore, unlike the banking book, the\ncomposition of the trading portfolio changes significantly from week to week or even day\nto day because it is managed separately and according to a different (shorter) risk horizon\nthan the banking book. This means that a hedge that is present on a given day may\ndisappear a few days later. Supervisors should, therefore, review the risk management\npractices and information systems of banks that conduct material trading activities and\nshould obtain the information necessary to ensure that interest rate risk in both trading\nand non-trading activities is properly managed and controlled. Supervisors may also wish\nto ask for a separate reporting of interest rate risk positions in the trading book.\n3.Supervisory analysis\n1. With a reporting framework designed along these lines regulators should have\nat their disposal a flexible tool for the analysis of interest rate risk. Since the framework\nonly specifies basic information to be collected, it allows a more flexible use by\nregulators than a reporting system with pre-specified scenarios and assumptions.\n2. By obtaining basic information, supervisors can perform an independent\nanalysis of a bank's exposure and can develop their own views regarding the institution's\ninterest rate risk profile. Risk analysis could use different interest rate scenarios such as\nparallel shifts, a flattening or steepening of the yield curve or its inversion with rate\nchanges of different magnitude either based on statistical probabilities or a worst-case\nanalysis. For banks with important exposures in foreign currencies, calculations based on\ndifferent assumptions on correlations between interest rates in different currencies can be\nuseful. With respect to instruments with behavioural maturities regulators can make\ncalculations based on their own assumptions and compare the results with banks' own\njudgements.\n3. The focus of regulators' quantitative analysis can either be the impact of\ninterest rate changes on current earnings or on the economic value of the banks' portfolio.\nIn conducting their analysis information about average yields on assets and liabilities in\neach time-band may be useful and regulators may wish to collect such information in\naddition to pure position data.\n4. Depending on their overall approach, regulators may carry out this type of\nanalysis either on a case-by-case basis or as part of a broader system designed to identify\noutliers with apparently excessive risk-taking.\n5. By varying the parameters as described, regulators gain more insight into an\ninstitution's risk profile than with a reporting system that reduces the complexity of\ninterest rate risk to a single number. In doing so, regulators can become more familiar\nwith the sensitivity of risk measures to changes in the underlying assumptions, and the\nevaluation process may produce as many insights as the quantitative result itself.\n6. Regardless of the extent of a regulator's own independent quantitative\nanalysis, a bank's own interest rate risk measure, whether reported as part of a basic\nsupervisory reporting system or reviewed as part of an individual assessment of a bank's\nrisk management, is an important consideration in the supervisory process. Reviewing the\nresults of a bank's internal model can be highly informative, but can also be a difficult77process because of the multitude of assumptions and modelling techniques that are\nimportant, but which need to be made transparent to supervisors. To be most useful, the\ninformation received should indicate the contribution of principal elements of a bank's\nportfolio to the risk profile under different assumptions with respect to interest rate\nchanges and the market response. Finally, any quantitative analysis should be\nsupplemented by a review of internal management reports in order to gain greater\ninsights into management's evaluation and management of risks, its methods for\nmeasuring exposures, and factors not reflected in the information available in the limited\nreporting to supervisors.\n1Although still technically a consultative paper subject to changes in the light of comments still to be\nreceived, this paper is included in the present volume because of the importance the Committee\nattaches to the sound management of interest rate risk.\n2Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks , January 1996.\n3Measurement of Banks' Exposure to Interest Rate Risk,  April 1993.\n4Risk Management Guidelines for Derivatives , July 1994.\n5This section refers to a management structure composed of a board of directors and senior\nmanagement. The Committee is aware that there are significant differences in legislative and\nregulatory frameworks across countries as regards the functions of the board of directors and senior\nmanagement. In some countries, the board has the main, if not exclusive, function of supervising the\nexecutive body (senior management, general management) so as to ensure that the latter fulfils its\ntasks. For this reason, in some cases, it is known as a supervisory board. This means that the board\nhas no executive functions. In other countries, by contrast, the board has a broader competence in\nthat it lays down the general framework for the management of the bank. Owing to these\ndifferences, the notions of the board of directors and the senior management are used in this paper\nnot to identify legal constructs but rather to label two decision-making functions within a bank.\n6In its simplest form, duration measures changes in economic value resulting f rom a percentage\nchange of interest rates under the simplifying assumptions that changes in value are proportional to\nchanges in the level of interest rates and that the timing of payments is fixed. Two important\nmodifications of simple duration are commonly used that relax one or both of these assumptions.\nThe first case is so-called modified duration. Modified duration - which is standard duration divided\nby 1 + r, where r is the level of market interest rates - is an elasticity. As such, it reflects the\npercentage change in the economic value of the instrument for a given percentage change in 1 + r.\nAs with simple duration, it assumes a linear relationship between percentage changes in value and\npercentage changes in interest rates. The second form of duration relaxes this assumption, as well as\nthe assumption that the timing of payments is fixed. Effective duration is the percentage change in\nthe price of the relevant instrument for a basis point change in yield.\n7The duration analysis described in the previous section can be viewed as a very simple form of static\nsimulation.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/10968.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jan 13, 2000", "info": "39A Framework for Measuring and Managing Liquidity\n(September 1992)\nIn its work on the supervision of liquidity, the Basle Committee has focused on\ndeveloping a greater understanding of the way in which international banks manage their\nliquidity on a global basis, on the premise that supervision of liquidity is particularly effective if\nbased on a dialogue between bank and supervisor. This paper brings together practice and\ntechniques currently employed by major international banks in a single analytical framework.\nWhile no bank may follow this framework precisely, it is a model which is believed to be an\nexample of current sound management practice and which could provide useful guidance to all\nbanks.\nThe seventh ICBS provides an opportunity for other supervisory authorities to\ncontribute to this work and it is the Committee's intention to prepare a revised version of this\npaper taking account of comments made at Cannes which could then be circulated to supervisory\nauthorities worldwide with the possibility of it being made available through them to commercial\nbanks.\nI.Purpose of the analysis\nMeasuring and managing liquidity are among the most vital activities of commercial\nbanks. By assuring a bank's ability to meet its liabilities as they come due, liquidity management\ncan reduce the probability of an irreversible adverse situation developing. Even in cases where a\ncrisis develops because of a problem elsewhere at a bank, such as a severe deterioration in asset\nquality or the uncovering of fraud, or where a crisis reflects a generalised  loss of confidence in\nfinancial institutions, the time available to a bank to address the problem will be determined by\nits liquidity. Indeed, the importance of liquidity transcends the individual institution, since a\nliquidity shortfall at a single institution can have system-wide repercussions. For this reason, the\nanalysis of liquidity requires bank managements to measure not only the liquidity positions of\nbanks on an ongoing basis but also to examine how funding requirements are likely to evolve\nunder crisis scenarios.\nThis paper sets out in general terms the main elements of a model liquidity\nmeasurement and management framework. The framework strikes a balance between\nquantitative and qualitative factors used to assess liquidity, and provides a methodology for\nanalysing balance sheet and off-balance-sheet activities consistently.\nWhile this paper focuses on the use of the framework by large banks, the approach it\ndescribes appears to have broad applicability to bank liquidity measurement and control, even for\nsmall, strictly domestic banks. In particular, good management information systems, central\nliquidity control, analysis of net funding requirements under alternative scenarios, diversification\nof funding sources, and contingency planning are crucial elements of strong liquidity\nmanagement at a bank of any size or scope of operations. The information systems and analysis\nneeded to implement the approach, however, can probably absorb fewer resources and be much\nless complex at a smaller institution or one that is active in fewer markets than the large,\ninternationally active banks contemplated in this paper.\nII. Policy issues40A. Information and reporting arrangements\nVirtually every financial transaction or commitment has implications for a bank's\nliquidity. Moreover, the transformation of illiquid assets into more liquid ones is a key activity of\nbanks. Thus, a bank's liquidity policies and liquidity management approach should form key\nelements of a bank's general business strategy. Understanding the context of liquidity\nmanagement involves examining a bank's managerial approach  to funding and liquidity\noperations and its liquidity planning under alternative scenarios .\nIn particular, all banks should have an articulated and specific liquidity policy setting\nout the general importance management places on liquidity. Such a policy should also enunciate\nspecific policies on particular aspects of liquidity management, such as the relative reliance on\nthe use of certain financial instruments and the encouragement of closer relationships with\nsupervisors. This general policy should be approved by a bank's board of directors.\nAn important element in such a policy will be a liquidity reporting structure\ndesigned to provide senior management with timely information and to be flexible enough to\ndeal with various contingencies that may arise during crises. Banks that stress the importance of\nliquidity assign ultimate responsibility  for setting liquidity policy and reviewing liquidity\ndecisions to the bank's highest level of management, and their decisions need to be reviewed\nperiodically by the board of directors.\nA bank's investment in information systems  designed to gather and analyse detailed\ninformation on assets and liabilities may need to be substantial. Because market conditions and a\nbank's own liquidity needs change constantly, extensive computer systems are often necessary to\nprovide management with relevant information on an accurate and up-to-date basis. Such\nsystems can also be helpful in projecting the bank's liquidity positions under a variety of\nconditions. Sometimes these systems are integrated into information systems monitoring other\nactivities or risk exposures of the bank.\nFinally, a schedule of frequent routine liquidity reviews  and less frequent, but more\nin-depth reviews should be provided for. These reviews provide the opportunity to reexamine\nand refine a bank's liquidity policies and practices in the light of a bank's liquidity experience\nand developments in its business.\nB. Treatment of foreign currencies\nFor banks with an international presence, the treatment of assets and liabilities in\nmultiple currencies adds a layer of complexity to liquidity management for two reasons. First,\nbanks are often less well known to liability holders in foreign currency markets. In the event of\nmarket concerns, especially if they relate to a bank's domestic operating environment, these\nliability holders may not be able to distinguish rumour from fact as well or as quickly as\ndomestic currency customers. Second, in the event of a disturbance, a bank may not always be\nable to mobilise domestic liquidity to meet foreign currency funding requirements.\nHence, when a bank conducts its business in multiple currencies, its management\nmust make two key decisions. The first concerns management structure . A bank with funding\nrequirements in foreign currencies will generally use one of three approaches. It may completely\ncentralise liquidity management (the head office managing liquidity for the whole bank in every\ncurrency). Alternatively, it may decentralise by assigning operating divisions responsibility for\ntheir own liquidity, but subject to limits imposed by the head office or frequent, routine reporting\nto the head office. For example, a non-European bank might assign its London office41responsibility for the liquidity management for its European operations in all currencies. As a\nthird approach, a bank may assign responsibility for liquidity in the home currency and for\noverall coordination to the home office, and responsibility for the bank's global liquidity in each\nmajor foreign currency to the management of the foreign office in the country issuing that\ncurrency. For example, the treasurer in the Tokyo office of a non-Japanese bank could be\nresponsible for the bank's global liquidity needs in yen. All of these approaches, however,\nprovide head office management with the opportunity to monitor and control worldwide\nliquidity.\nThe second decision concerns the liquidity strategy in each currency . In the ordinary\ncourse of business, a bank must decide how foreign currency funding needs will be met. To what\nextent, for example, will a bank fund foreign currency needs in domestic currency and convert\nthe proceeds to foreign currency through the foreign exchange market or currency swaps? How\nwill a bank manage the associated risk that exchange markets will cease to be available? A\nbank's assessment will depend on the size of its funding needs, its access to foreign currency\nfunding markets, and its capacity to rely on off-balance-sheet instruments (e.g. standby lines of\ncredit, swap facilities, etc.).\nA bank must also develop a back-up liquidity strategy for circumstances in which its\nnormal approach to funding foreign currency operations is disrupted. Such a strategy will call for\ndrawing either on home currency sources and converting them to foreign currency through the\nexchange markets or drawing on back-up sources in particular foreign currencies. For example,\nback-up liquidity for all currencies may be provided by the head office using the home currency,\nbased on an assessment of the bank's access to the foreign exchange market and the derivative\nmarkets under the conditions in which the original liquidity disturbance is likely to occur.\nAlternatively, a bank's management may decide that certain foreign currencies make up a\nsufficient part of its liquidity needs to warrant separate liquidity back-up. In that case, either the\nhome office or the regional treasurer for each specific currency would develop a contingency\nstrategy and negotiate liquidity backstop facilities for those currencies.\nIII. A framework for measuring and managing liquidity\nThe framework for assessing and managing bank liquidity presented here has three\nmajor dimensions: (A) measuring and managing net funding requirements , (B) managing market\naccess, and (C) contingency planning .\nA. Measuring and managing net funding requirements\nThe analysis of net funding requirements involves the construction of a maturity\nladder and the calculation of a cumulative net excess or deficit of funds at selected maturity\ndates. A bank's net funding requirements are determined by analysing its future cash flows based\non assumptions of the future behaviour of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items, and then\ncalculating the cumulative net excess over the time frame for the liquidity assessment.\n(i) The maturity ladder\nA maturity ladder should be used to compare a bank's future cash inflows to its future\ncash outflows over a series of specified time periods. Cash inflows arise from maturing assets,\nsaleable non-maturing assets and established credit lines that can be tapped. Cash outflows\ninclude liabilities falling due and contingent liabilities, especially committed lines of credit that42can be drawn down. In Table 1, the maturity ladder is represented by placing sources and\namounts of cash inflows on one side of the page and sources and amounts of outflows on the\nother.\nIn constructing the maturity ladder, a bank has to allocate each cash inflow or\noutflow to a given calendar date from a starting point, usually the next day. (A bank must be\nclear about the clearing and settlement conventions it is using to determine its initial point.) As a\npreliminary step to constructing the maturity ladder, cash inflows can be ranked by the date on\nwhich assets mature or a conservative estimate of when credit lines can be drawn down.\nSimilarly, cash outflows can be ranked by the date on which liabilities fall due, the earliest date a\nliability holder could exercise an early repayment option, or the earliest date contingencies can\nbe called. Significant interest and other cash flows should also be included. The difference\nbetween cash inflows and cash outflows in each period, the excess or deficit of funds, becomes a\nstarting-point for a measure of a bank's future liquidity excess or shortfall at a series of points in\ntime.\nIt is this net funding requirement that requires management. Typically, a bank may\nfind substantial funding gaps in distant periods and will endeavour to fill these gaps by\ninfluencing the maturity of transactions so as to offset the gap. For example, if there is a\nsignificant funding requirement 30 days hence, a bank may choose to acquire an asset maturing\non that day, or seek to renew or roll over a liability. The closer a large gap gets, the more\ndifficult it is to offset. Thus, banks will typically collect data on relatively distant periods so as to\nmaximise the opportunities to close the gap before it gets too close. Most banks would regard it\nas important that any remaining borrowing requirement should be limited to an amount which\nexperience suggests is comfortably within the bank's capacity to fund in the market.\n(ii) Alternative scenarios\nEvaluating whether a bank is sufficiently liquid depends in large measure on the\nbehaviour of cash flows under different conditions. Analysing liquidity thus entails laying out\n\"what if\" scenarios. Three scenarios provide useful benchmarks: a bank's \"going-concern\"\ncondition, a bank-specific crisis, and a general market crisis. Under each scenario, a bank should\ntry to account for any significant positive or negative liquidity swings that could occur.\n(a) The going-concern  scenario establishes a benchmark for the \"normal\" behaviour  of\nbalance sheet-related cash flows in the ordinary course of business at a bank. This scenario is\nuseful in managing a bank's use of deposit and other debt markets. By establishing such a\nbenchmark, a bank can manage its net funding requirements so that it is not faced with very large\nneeds on any given day, so avoiding the impact of temporary constraints on its ability to roll over\nliabilities because of market disruptions or concerns about its condition.\n(b) Assessing liquidity under the second scenario, a liquidity  crisis at an individual bank\nthat remains confined to that bank, provides one type of \"worst-case\" benchmark. The key\nunderlying assumption in this scenario is that many of the bank's liabilities could not be rolled\nover or replaced and would have to be repaid at maturity so that the bank would have to wind\ndown its books to some degree. This is the scenario implicit in many existing bank supervisory\nliquidity measures. While a severe liquidity crisis at an individual bank usually stems from a\nfundamental, bank-specific problem not related to its liquidity, a bank's ability to honour its\ndeposit maturities under such conditions can provide the time that the bank would need to\naddress the underlying problem. If a bank can weather such a \"worst-case\" scenario, it can43almost certainly survive less drastic firm-specific problems.\n(c) The last scenario is some form of general market crisis  where liquidity is affected at\nall banks in one or more markets. The key underlying assumption that banks need to make in this\nscenario is that severe tiering by perceived credit quality would occur, so that differences in\nfunding access among banks or among classes of financial institutions would widen, benefiting\nsome and harming others. Although some banks may believe that central banks would ensure\nthat key markets would continue to function in some form, severe market disruption would not\nnecessarily be prevented. For bank management, this represents a second type of \"worst-case\"\nscenario that a bank would wish to weather. A supervisor or central bank may find this scenario\nto be of particular interest when surveying the liquidity profile of the entire banking sector. The\ncollective results would suggest the size of the total liquidity buffer in the banking system and\nthe likely distribution of liquidity problems among large institutions if the banking system as a\nwhole experiences a shortage of liquidity.\nA bank will need to assign the timing of cash flows for each type of asset and\nliability by assessing the probability of the behaviour of those cash flows in the scenario being\nexamined. These decisions about the specific timing and the size of cash flows are an integral\npart of the construction of the maturity ladder under each scenario. For each funding source, for\nexample, a bank would have to decide whether the liability would be: (1) repaid in full at\nmaturity; (2) gradually run off over the next few weeks; or (3) virtually certain to be rolled over\nor available if tapped. The bank's historical experience of the pattern of flows and a knowledge\nof market conventions could guide a bank's decisions, but judgement often plays a large role,\nespecially in crisis scenarios. Uncertainty is an inevitable element in choosing between possible\nbehaviour patterns, and that dictates a conservative approach that would bias a bank toward\nassigning later dates to cash inflows and earlier dates to cash outflows.\nHence, the timing of cash inflows and outflows on the maturity ladder can differ\nbetween the going-concern approach and the two crisis scenarios, as shown in Table 2. In\nconstructing the going-concern  maturity ladder, conservative assumptions need to be made about\nthe behaviour of cash flows that can replace the contractual cash flows. For example, many\nmaturing loans would be rolled over in the normal course of business and some proportion of\ntransactions and savings deposits would also be rolled over or could be easily replaced.\nIn a bank-specific crisis  scenario it is assumed that a bank will be unable to roll over\nor replace many or most of its liabilities, and that it may have to wind down its books to some\ndegree. The assumptions under the third scenario, a general market crisis , may differ quite\nsharply from the assumptions made for a bank-specific crisis. For example, a bank may believe,\nbased upon its historical experience, that its ability to control the level and timing of future cash\nflows from a stock of saleable assets in a bank-specific funding crisis would deteriorate little\nfrom normal conditions. However, in a general market crisis, this capacity may fall off sharply if\nfew institutions are willing or able to make cash purchases of less liquid assets. On the other\nhand, a bank that has a high reputation in the market may actually benefit from a flight to quality\nas potential depositors seek out the safest home for their funds. Banks may also anticipate that\ncentral banks would ensure that key markets continue to function but not necessarily without\nsignificant disruption.\n(iii) Measuring liquidity over the chosen time-frame\nThe evolution of a bank's liquidity profile under one or more scenarios can be\ntabulated or portrayed graphically, by cumulating the balance of expected cash inflows and cash44outflows at several time points. A stylised liquidity graph can be constructed enabling the\nevolution of the cumulative net excess or deficit of funds to be compared under the three\nscenarios in order to provide further insights into a bank's liquidity and to check how consistent\nand realistic the assumptions are for the individual bank. For example, a high-quality institution\nmay look very liquid in a going-concern scenario, marginally liquid in a bank-specific crisis and\nquite liquid in a general market crisis. In contrast, a weaker institution might be far less liquid in\nthe general crisis than it would in a bank-specific crisis.\nIt is important to note that the relevant time-frame for active liquidity management is\nshort, generally extending out no more than a few weeks. While most banks would not actively\nmanage their net funding requirements over a period much longer than four or five weeks,\nmanagements may consider information on requirements beyond that time frame to be useful.\nClearly, banks active in markets for longer-term assets and liabilities will need to use a longer\ntime-frame than banks which are active in short-term money markets and which are in a better\nposition to fill funding gaps at short notice. However, even this latter category of banks may find\nit worthwhile to tailor the maturity of new transactions to offset gaps some time off.\nA longer time horizon may also generate useful information on which to base more\nstrategic decisions on the extent to which a bank may rely on particular markets.\n(iv) Assumptions used in determining cash flows\nSince a bank's future liquidity position will be affected by factors that cannot always\nbe forecast with precision, assumptions need to be reviewed frequently to determine their\ncontinuing validity, especially given the rapidity of change in banking markets. The total number\nof major assumptions to be made, however, is fairly limited. This section attempts to catalogue\nthe liquidity assumptions under four broad categories: (a) assets, (b) liabilities, (c) off-balance-\nsheet activities, and (d) other.\n(a) Assets\nAssumptions about a bank's future stock of assets include their potential\nmarketability and use as collateral of existing assets which could increase cash inflows, and the\nextent to which maturing assets will be renewed, and new assets acquired, thus reducing\ncontractual cash inflows.\nDetermining the level of a bank's potential assets  involves answering three questions:\n\u2022 what proportion of maturing assets will a bank be able and willing to  roll over  or renew?\n\u2022 what is the expected level of new loan requests  that will be accepted ?\n\u2022 what is the expected level of draw-downs of commitments to lend  that a bank will need to\nfund? These commitments may take the form of committed commercial lines without\nmaterial adverse change (MAC) clauses, which a bank may not be legally able to turn\naway even if the borrower's financial condition has deteriorated; committed commercial\nlines with MAC clauses which some customers could draw down in crisis scenarios; and\nother commercial and consumer credit lines.\nIn estimating its normal funding needs, some banks use historical patterns of roll-overs, draw-\ndowns and new requests for loans; others conduct a statistical analysis taking account of seasonal\nand other effects believed to determine loan demand (e.g., for consumer loans). Alternatively, a\nbank may make judgmental business projections, or undertake a customer-by-customer\nassessment for its larger customers and apply historical relationships to the remainder.\nRoll-overs, draw-downs and new loan requests all represent potential cash drains for45a bank. Nevertheless, a bank has some leeway to control many of these items depending on the\nassumed scenario. In a crisis situation, for example, a bank might decide to risk damaging some\nbusiness relationships by refusing to roll over loans that it would make under normal conditions,\nor it might refuse to honour lending commitments that are not binding.\nIn determining the marketability of assets , the approach segregates the assets into\nthree categories by their degree of relative liquidity:\n\u2022 the most liquid category includes components such as cash, securities, and\ninterbank loans. Some of these assets may be immediately convertible into cash\nat prevailing market values under almost any scenario (either by outright sale, or\nfor sale and repurchase, or as collateral for secured financing), while others, such\nas interbank loans or some securities, may lose liquidity in a general crisis;\n\u2022 a less liquid category comprises a bank's saleable loan portfolio. The task here is\nto develop assumptions about a reasonable schedule for the disposal of a bank's\nassets. Some assets, while marketable, may be viewed as unsaleable within the\ntime frame of the liquidity analysis;\n\u2022 the least liquid category includes essentially unmarketable assets such as loans\nnot capable of being readily sold, bank premises and investments in subsidiaries,\nas well as, possibly, severely troubled credits;\n\u2022 assets pledged to third parties are deducted from each category.\nThe view underlying the classification process is that different banks could assign the\nsame asset to different categories on the maturity ladder because of differences in their internal\nasset-liability management. For example, a loan categorised  by one bank as a moderately liquid\nasset - saleable only late in the liquidity analysis time-frame - may be considered a candidate for\nfairly quick and certain liquidation at a bank that operates in a market where loans are frequently\ntransferred, that routinely includes loan-sale clauses in all loan documentation and that has\ndeveloped a network of customers with whom it has concluded loan-purchase agreements.\nIn categorising assets, a bank would also have to decide how an asset's liquidity\nwould be affected under different scenarios. Some assets that may be very liquid during times of\nnormal business conditions may be less so during a time of crisis. Consequently, a bank may\nplace an asset in different categories depending on the type of scenario it is forecasting.\n(b) Liabilities\nTo evaluate the cash flows arising from a bank's liabilities, a bank would first\nexamine the behaviour of its liabilities under normal business conditions. This would include\nestablishing:\n\u2022 the normal level of roll-overs of deposits and other liabilities;\n\u2022 the effective maturity of deposits with non-contractual maturities, such as\ndemand deposits and many types of savings accounts;\n\u2022 the normal growth in new deposit accounts.\nAs in assessing roll-overs and new requests for loans, a bank could use several\npossible techniques to establish the effective maturities of its liabilities, such as using historical\npatterns of deposit behaviour. For sight deposits, whether of individuals or businesses, many\nbanks conduct a statistical analysis that takes account of seasonal factors, interest rate\nsensitivities, and other macroeconomic factors. For some large wholesale depositors, a bank may46undertake a customer-by-customer assessment of the probability of roll-over.\nIn examining the cash flows arising from a bank's liabilities in the two crisis\nscenarios, a bank would examine four basic questions:\n\u2022 which sources of funding are likely to stay with a bank under any circumstance, and\ncan these be increased?\n\u2022 which sources of funding can be expected to run off gradually if problems arise, and at\nwhat rate? Is deposit pricing a means of controlling the rate of runoff?\n\u2022 which maturing liabilities or liabilities with non-contractual maturities can be expected\nto run off immediately at the first sign of trouble? Are there liabilities with early\nwithdrawal options that are likely to be exercised?\n\u2022 does the bank have back-up facilities that it can draw down?\nThe first two categories represent cash-flow developments that tend to reduce the\ncash outflows projected directly from contractual maturities. In addition to the liabilities\nidentified above, a bank's capital and term liabilities not maturing within the horizon of the\nliquidity analysis provide a liquidity buffer.\nThe liabilities that make up the first category may be thought to stay with a bank,\neven under a \"worst-case\" projection. Some core deposits generally stay with a bank because\nretail and small business depositors may rely on the public-sector safety net to shield them from\nloss, or because the cost of switching banks, especially for some business services such as\ntransactions accounts, is prohibitive in the very short run.\nThe second category, liabilities that are likely to stay with a bank during periods of\nmild difficulties and to run off relatively slowly in a crisis, includes core deposits that are not\nalready included in the first category. In addition to core deposits, in some countries, some level\nof particular types of interbank and government funding may remain with a bank during such\nperiods, although interbank and government deposits are often viewed as volatile. A bank's own\nliability roll-over experience as well as the experiences of other troubled institutions should help\nin developing a timetable for these cash flows.\nThe third category comprises the remainder of the maturing liabilities, including\nsome without contractual maturities, such as wholesale deposits. Under each scenario, this\napproach adopts a conservative stance and assumes that these remaining liabilities are repaid at\nthe earliest possible maturity, especially in crisis scenarios, because such money may flow to\ngovernment securities and other safe havens. Factors such as diversification and relationship\nbuilding are seen as especially important in evaluating the extent of liability runoff and a bank's\ncapacity to replace funds. Nevertheless, in a general market crisis, some high-quality institutions\nmay find that they receive larger-than-usual wholesale deposit inflows, even as funding inflows\ndry up for other market participants.\nSome banks, for example, smaller banks in regional markets, may also have credit\nlines that they can draw down to offset cash outflows. While these sorts of facility are somewhat\nrare among larger banks, the possible use of such lines could be addressed with a bank's liability\nassumptions. Where such facilities are subject to material adverse change clauses, of course they\nmay be of limited value, especially in a bank specific crisis.\n(c) Off-balance-sheet activities\nA bank should also examine the potential for substantial cash flows from its off-\nbalance-sheet activities (other than the loan commitments already considered), even if such cash47flows are not always a part of banks' current liquidity analysis.\nContingent liabilities, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees , represent\npotentially significant cash drains for a bank, but are usually not dependent on a bank's\ncondition. A bank may be able to ascertain a \"normal\" level of cash outflows on an ongoing\nconcern basis, and then estimate the scope for an increase in these flows during periods of stress.\nHowever, a general market crisis may trigger a substantial increase in the amount of draw-downs\nof letters of credit because of an increase in defaults and bankruptcies in the market.\nOther potential sources of cash outflows include swaps, written over-the-counter\n(OTC) options, and other interest rate and forward foreign exchange rate contracts . If a bank\nhas a large swap book, for example, then it would want to consider the circumstances under\nwhich the bank could become a net payer, and whether or not the potential net payout is\nsignificant. For example, if a bank is a swap market-maker, the possibility exists that in a bank-\nspecific or general market crisis, customers with in-the-money swaps (or a net in-the-money\nswap position) would seek to reduce their credit exposure to the bank by asking the bank to buy\nback swaps. Similarly, a bank would need to review its written OTC options book and any\noutstanding warrants, together with any hedges against these positions, since certain types of\ncrises may stimulate an increase in early exercises (for American-style options) or requests that\nthe bank repurchase options. These exercises and repurchase requests could result in an\nunforeseen cash drain, if hedges either cannot be quickly liquidated to generate cash or provide\ninsufficient cash.\n(d) Other assumptions\nThe discussion has centred so far on assumptions concerning the behaviour of\nspecific instruments under various scenarios. Looking solely at instruments, however, may\nignore some factors that may significantly impact a bank's cash flows.\nBesides the liquidity needs arising from business activities, banks also require excess\nfunds to support other operations. For example, many large banks provide clearing services to\ncorrespondent banks and financial institutions that generate significant and not always easily\npredictable cash inflows and outflows, the amounts of which depend on the clearing volumes of\nthe correspondent banks. Unforeseen fluctuations in these volumes can deplete a bank of needed\nfunds.\nNet overhead expenses, such as rent and salary, although generally not significant\nenough to be considered in banks' liquidity analyses, can in some cases also be sources of cash\noutflows.\nB. Managing market access\nSome liquidity management techniques are viewed as important not only for their\ninfluence on the assumptions used in constructing the maturity ladders, but also for their direct\ncontribution to enhancing a bank's liquidity. Thus, it is important for a bank to review\nperiodically its efforts to maintain the diversification of liabilities , to establish relationships with\nliability-holders  and to develop asset-sales markets .\nAs a check for adequate diversification of liabilities, a bank needs to examine the\nlevel of reliance on individual funding sources, by instrument type , nature of the provider of\nfunds, and geographic market . In addition, a bank should strive to understand and evaluate the48use of intercompany financing for its individual business offices.\nBuilding strong relationships with some providers of funding can provide a line of\ndefence in a liquidity problem and form an integral part of a bank's liquidity management. The\nfrequency of contact and the frequency of use of a funding source are two possible indicators of\nthe strength of a funding relationship.\nDeveloping markets for asset sales or exploring arrangements under which a bank\ncan borrow against assets is the third element of managing market access. The inclusion of loan-\nsale clauses in loan documentation and the frequency of use of some asset-sales markets are two\npossible indicators of a bank's ability to execute asset sales under adverse scenarios.\nC. Contingency planning\nA bank's ability to withstand a net funding requirement in a bank specific or general\nmarket liquidity crisis can also depend on the calibre of its formal contingency plans. Effective\ncontingency plans should address two major questions:\n\u2022 does management have a strategy for handling a crisis?\n\u2022 does management have procedures in place for accessing cash in emergency?\nThe degree to which a bank has addressed these questions realistically, provides management\nwith additional insight as to how a bank may fare in a crisis.\n(i) Strategy\nA game plan for dealing with a crisis should consist of several components. Most\nimportant are those that involve managerial coordination. A contingency plan needs to spell out\nprocedures to ensure that information flows  remain timely and uninterrupted, and that the\ninformation flows provide senior management with the precise information it needs in order to\nmake quick decisions. A clear division of responsibility  must be set out so that all personnel\nunderstand what is expected of them during a crisis. Confusion in this area can waste resources\non certain issues and omit coverage on others.\nAnother major element in the plan should be a strategy for taking certain actions to\nalter asset and liability behaviours . While assumptions can be made as to how an asset or\nliability will behave under certain conditions (as discussed above), a bank may have the ability to\nchange these characteristics. For example, a bank may conclude that it will suffer a liquidity\ndeficit in a crisis based on its assumptions regarding the amount of future cash inflows from\nsaleable assets and outflows from deposit run-offs. During such a crisis, however, a bank may be\nable to market assets more aggressively, or sell assets that it would not have sold under normal\nconditions and thus augment its cash inflows from asset sales. Alternatively, it may try to reduce\ncash outflows by raising its deposit rates to retain deposits that might otherwise have moved\nelsewhere.\nOther components of the game plan involve maintaining customer relationships with\nborrowers, trading and off-balance-sheet counterparties, and liability-holders. As the intensity of\na crisis increases, banks must often trade off relationships with some customers for liquidity in\norder to survive. By classifying borrowers and trading customers according to their importance\nto the bank, a bank can determine which relationships it may need to forgo at different points in a\ncrisis. At the same time, relationships with lenders become more important in a crisis. If a bank's\nstrategy requires liability managers to maintain strong ongoing links with lenders and large49liability-holders during periods of relative calm, the bank will be better positioned to secure\nsources of funds during emergencies.\nAn additional, pragmatic element that may be important is how a bank deals with the\npress and broadcast media . Astute public relations management can help a bank avoid the\nspread of public rumours that can result in significant run-offs by retail depositors and\ninstitutional investors.\n(ii) Back-up liquidity\nContingency plans should also include procedures for making up cash flow shortfalls\nin emergency situations. Banks have available to them several sources of such funds, including\npreviously unused credit facilities and the domestic central bank. Depending on the severity of a\ncrisis, a bank may choose - or be forced - to use one or more of these sources. The plan should\nspell out as clearly as possible the amount of funds a bank has available from these sources, and\nunder what scenarios a bank could use them.\nTable 1\nThe maturity ladder based on contractual maturities\nDAY 1:\nCash Inflows Cash Outflows Excess/(Shortfall)\nMaturing liabilities with\nMaturing assets 100contractual maturities 50\nInterest receivable 20Interest payable 10\nAsset sales 50Other deposit runoffs 30\nDrawdowns on Com.

With liberalisation in Indian financial markets over the last few years and growing\nintegration of domestic markets with external markets, the risks, particularly the market risks, associated\nwith FIs\u2019 operations have become complex and large, requiring strategic management.  FIs are operating\nin a fairly deregulated environment and are required to determine interest rates on various products in\ntheir liabilities and assets portfolios, both in domestic as well as foreign currencies, on a dynamic basis.\nIntense competition for business involving both the assets and liabilities, together with increasing\nvolatility in the domestic interest rates as also in foreign exchange rates, has brought pressure on the\nmanagement of FIs to maintain a good balance amongst spreads, profitability and long-term viability.\nThese pressures call for structured and comprehensive measures for institutionalising an integrated risk\nmanagement system and not just ad hoc action. The FIs are exposed to several major risks in the course\nof their business \u2013 generically classified as credit risk, market risk and operational risk \u2013 which underlines\nthe need for effective risk management systems in FIs. The FIs need to address these risks in a structured\nmanner by upgrading the quality of their risk management and adopting more comprehensive ALM\npractices than has been done hitherto.\n2. The envisaged ALM system seeks to introduce a formalised framework for management of market\nrisks through measuring, monitoring and managing liquidity, exchange rate  and interest rate risks of a FI\nthat need to be closely integrated with the FIs\u2019 business strategy.  This note lays down broad guidelines\nfor FIs in respect of liquidity, exchange rate and interest rate risk management systems which form part of\nthe ALM function. The initial focus of the ALM function would be to enforce the discipline of market\nrisk management viz. managing business after assessing the market risks involved. The objective of a\ngood risk management systems should be to evolve into a strategic tool for effective management of FIs.\n3.   The ALM process rests on three pillars:\n\u2022 ALM Information System\n\u00a7 Management  Information  System\n\u00a7 Information availability, accuracy, adequacy and expediency\n\u2022 ALM Organisation\n\u00a7 Structure and responsibilities\n\u00a7 Level of top  management involvement\n\u2022 ALM Process\n\u00a7 Risk parameters\n\u00a7 Risk identification4\u00a7 Risk  measurement\n\u00a7 Risk management\n\u00a7 Risk policies and tolerance levels.\n4.  ALM Information System\n \n ALM has to be supported by a management philosophy which clearly specifies the  risk  policies  and\ntolerance  limits.  This framework needs to be built on sound  methodology  with  necessary supporting\ninformation  system as the central element of the  entire ALM  exercise  is  the  availability  of  adequate\nand  accurate  information  with expedience. Thus, information is the key to the ALM process. There are\nvarious methods prevalent world-wide for measuring risks.  These range from the simple Gap Statement\nto extremely sophisticated and data intensive Risk Adjusted  Profitability  Measurement  methods. The\npresent guidelines would require comparatively simpler information system for generating liquidity gap\nand interest rate gap reports.\n5.     ALM  Organisation\n5.1 Successful implementation of the risk management process would require strong commitment on\nthe part of the senior management in the FI, to integrate basic operations and strategic decision making\nwith risk management. The Board should have overall responsibility for management of market risks and\nshould decide the risk management policy of the FI and set limits for liquidity, interest rate, exchange rate\nand equity price risks.\n5.2 The ALCO is a decision-making unit, consisting of the FI's senior management including CEO,\nresponsible for integrated balance sheet management from risk-return perspective including the strategic\nmanagement of interest rate and liquidity risks. While each FI will have to decide the role of its ALCO, its\npowers and responsibilities as also the decisions to be taken by it, its responsibilities would normally\ninclude:\n\u2022 monitoring the market risk levels of the FI by ensuring adherence to the various risk-limits set by the\nBoard;\n\u2022 articulating the current interest rate view and a view on future direction of interest rate movements\nand base its decisions for future business strategy on this view as also on other parameters considered\nrelevant.5\u2022 deciding the business strategy of the FI, both - on the assets and liabilities sides, consistent with the\nFI\u2019s  interest rate view, budget  and pre-determined  risk management objectives. This would, in turn,\ninclude:\n\u2022 determining the desired maturity profile and mix of the assets and liabilities;\n\u2022 product pricing for both -  assets as well as liabilities side;\n\u2022 deciding the funding strategy i.e. the source and mix of liabilities or sale of assets; the proportion\nof fixed  vs floating rate funds, wholesale  vs retail funds, money market  vs capital market funding\n, domestic vs foreign currency funding,  etc.\n\u2022 reviewing the results of and progress in implementation of the decisions made in the previous\nmeetings\n5.3 The ALM Support Groups consisting of operating staff should be responsible for analysing,\nmonitoring and reporting the risk profiles to the ALCO. The staff should also prepare forecasts\n(simulations) reflecting the impact of various possible changes in market conditions on the balance sheet\nand recommend the action needed to adhere to FI's internal limits.\n5.4   Composition of ALCO\nThe size (number of members) of  ALCO would depend on the size of each institution, business mix and\norganisational complexity. To ensure commitment of the Top Management and timely response to market\ndynamics, the CEO/CMD/DMD or the ED should head the Committee. Though the composition of\nALCO could vary across the FIs as per their respective set up and business profile, it would be useful to\nhave the Chiefs of Investment, Credit, Resources Management or Planning, Funds Management /\nTreasury ( forex and domestic), International Business and Economic Research as the members of the\nCommittee. In addition, the Head of the Technology Division should also be an invitee for building up of\nMIS and related computerisation.  Some FIs may even have Sub-committees and Support Groups.\n5.5  Committee of Directors\nThe Management Committee of the Board or any other Specific Committee constituted by the Board\nshould oversee the implementation of the ALM system and review its functioning periodically.\n6.  ALM Process\n \n The scope of ALM function can be described as follows:6\u2022 Liquidity   risk  management\n\u2022 Management of market risks\n\u2022 Trading  risk  management\n\u2022 Funding and capital planning\n\u2022 Profit   planning  and  growth  projection\n \n The guidelines contained in this note mainly address Liquidity and Interest Rate risks.\n6.1  Liquidity  Risk  Management\nMeasuring and managing li quidity needs are vital for effective operation of FIs.  By assuring a FI's ability\nto meet its liabilities as they become due, liquidity  management  can  reduce  the  probability  of  an\nadverse  situation  developing.  The importance of liquidity transcends individual institutions, as liquidity\nshortfall  in  one  institution  can  have  repercussions  on  the  entire  system. FIs\u2019 management should\nmeasure not only the liquidity positions of FIs on an ongoing basis but also examine how liquidity\nrequirements are likely to evolve under different assumptions. Experience shows that assets commonly\nconsidered to be liquid, such as Government securities and other money market instruments, could also\nbecome illiquid when the market and players are unidirectional. Therefore liquidity has to be tracked\nthrough maturity or cash flow mismatches. For measuring and managing net funding requirements, the\nuse of a maturity ladder and calculation of  cumulative  surplus or deficit of funds at selected maturity\ndates is adopted as a   standard  tool. The format of the Statement of Liquidity is furnished in Annexure I.\n6.2   The Maturity Profile,  as  detailed in  Appendix I,  could be used for measuring the  future cash\nflows of  FIs in different time buckets. The time buckets, may be distributed as under:\ni)  1 to 14 days\nii)  15 to 28 days\niii)  29 days and upto 3 months\niv)  Over 3 months and upto 6 months\nv)  Over 6 months and upto 1 year\nvi)  Over 1 year and upto 3 years\nvii)  Over 3 years and upto 5 years\nviii)  Over 5 years and upto 7 years\nix)  Over 7 years andupto 10 years\nx)  Over 10 years.76.3  The investments are assumed as illiquid due to lack of depth in the secondary market and are,\ntherefore, generally shown, as per their residual maturity, under respective time buckets. However, some\nof the FIs may be maintaining securities in the \u2018Trading Book\u2019, which are kept distinct from other\ninvestments made for retaining relationship with customers. Securities held in the 'Trading Book\u2019 should\nbe subject to the following preconditions:\ni) The composition and volume of the Trading Book should be clearly defined;\nii) Maximum maturity/duration of the trading portfolio should be restricted;\niii) The holding period of the trading securities should not exceed 90 days;\niv) Cut-loss limit(s) should be prescribed;\nv) Product-wise defeasance periods (i.e. the time taken to liquidate the \u2018position\u2019\non the basis of liquidity in the secondary market) should be prescribed;\nvi) Such securities should be marked-to-market on a daily/weekly basis and the\nrevaluation gain/loss should be charged to the profit and loss account ; etc.\nFIs which maintain such \u2018Trading Books\u2019 consisting of securities that comply with the above standards,\nare permitted to show the trading securities under 1-14 days, 15-28 days and 29-90 days buckets on the\nbasis of the defeasance periods. The Board/ALCO of the banks should approve the volume, composition,\nmaximum maturity/duration, holding/ defeasance period, cut loss limits, etc., of the \u2018Trading Book\u2019 . FIs,\nwhich are better equipped, will have the option of evolving with the approval of the Board / ALCO, an\nintegrated Value at Risk ( VaR) limit for their entire balance sheet including the \u201cBanking Book\u201d and\nthe \u201cTrading Book\u201d, for the rupee as well as foreign currency portfolio. A copy of the approved policy\nnote in this regard, should be forwarded to the Department of Banking Supervision, FID, RBI.\n6.4  Within each time bucket there could be mismatches depending on cash inflows  and  outflows.  While\nthe mismatches upto one year would be relevant since these provide early warning signals of impending\nliquidity problems, the main focus should be on the short-term mismatches viz., 1-14 days and 15-28\ndays. FIs however, are expected to monitor their cumulative mismatches (running total) across all time\nbuckets by establishing internal prudential limits with the approval of the Board / ALCO. The negative\ngap during 1-14 days and 15-28 days time-buckets, in normal course, should not exceed 10 per cent and\n15 per cent respectively, of the cash outflows in each time bucket.  If a FI  in view of its current asset-\nliability profile and the consequential structural mismatches needs higher tolerance level, it could operate\nwith higher limit sanctioned by its Board / ALCO giving specific reasons on the  need for such higher8limit. The discretion to allow a higher tolerance level is intended for a temporary period, i.e. till March\n31, 2001.  While determining the tolerance levels, the FIs may take into account all relevant factors based\non their asset-liability base, nature of business, future strategy, etc. The RBI is interested in ensuring that\nthe tolerance levels are determined keeping all necessary factors in view and further refined with\nexperience gained in Liquidity Management.\n6.5  The  Statement  of Liquidity   ( Annexure I  )  may be prepared by placing all  cash  inflows  and\noutflows  in the maturity ladder according to the expected timing of cash flows. A maturing liability will\nbe a cash outflow while a maturing asset will be a cash inflow. It would also be necessary to take into\naccount the rupee inflows and outflows on account of forex operations. Thus, the foreign currency\nresources raised abroad but swapped into rupees and deployed in rupee assets, would be reflected in the\nrupee liquidity statement. Some of the FIs have the practice of disbursing rupee loans to their exporter\nclients but denominating such loans in foreign currency in their books which are extinguished by the\nexport proceeds. Such foreign currency denominated loans too would be a part of rupee liquidity\nstatement since such loans are created out of rupee resources. As regards the foreign currency loans\ngranted out of foreign currency resources on a back-to-back basis, a  currency-wise liquidity statement\nfor each of the foreign currencies in which liabilities and assets have been created,  will need to be\nprepared in formats at Annexure I-A and Annexure II-A ,  which are similar to the formats prescribed for\nrupee resources.\n7.  Currency  Risk\n7.1 Floating exchange rate arrangement has brought in its wake pronounced volatility adding a new\ndimension to the risk profile of  FIs\u2019 balance sheets.   The  increased capital flows across free economies\nfollowing deregulation have contributed to increase in the volume of transactions. Large cross border\nflows together with the volatility has rendered the FIs' balance sheets vulnerable to exchange rate\nmovements.\n7.2  Dealing in different currencies brings opportunities as also risks. If the liabilities in  one currency\nexceed the level of assets in the same currency, then the currency mismatch can add value or erode value\ndepending upon the currency movements. Mismatched currency position, besides exposing the balance\nsheet to movements in exchange rate, also exposes it to country risk and settlement risk. FIs undertake\noperations in foreign exchange such as borrowings and making loans in foreign currency, which exposes9them to currency or exchange rate  risk. The simplest way to avoid currency risk is to ensure that\nmismatches, if any, are reduced to zero or near zero. However, irrespective of the strategies adopted, it\nmay not be possible to eliminate currency mismatches altogether.\n7.3     At present, only five FIs (viz. EXIM Bank, ICICI, IDBI, IFCI and IIBI) have been granted by RBI\n(ECD) restricted authorisation to deal in foreign exchange under FERA 1973 while other FIs are not\nauthorised to deal in foreign exchange. The FIs are, therefore, unlike banks, are not subject to the full\nrigour of the reporting requirements under Exchange Control regulations. Hence, the MAP and SIR\nstatements prescribed for banks vide AD (MA Series) circular no. 52 dated 27 December 1997 issued by\nRBI (ECD), are not applicable to FIs. In order, however, to capture the liquidity and interest rate risk\ninherent in the foreign currency portfolio of the FIs, it would be necessary to compile, on an ongoing\nbasis, currency-wise  Statement of Liquidity and IRS Statement, separately for each of the currencies in\nwhich the FIs have an exposure. These statements should be compiled in the formats prescribed at\nAnnexure I-A  and Annexure II-A  \u2013 which are similar to the formats  prescribed for the rupee resources,\nat Annexure I and Annexure II to these guidelines.\n8.   Interest  Rate  Risk  (IRR)\n8.1 Interest rate risk is the risk where changes in market interest rates  might adversely affect a FI's\nfinancial condition. The immediate impact of changes in interest rates is on FI's earnings (i.e. reported\nprofits) by changing its Net Interest Income (NII). A long-term impact of changing interest rates is on\nFI's Market Value of Equity (MVE) or Net Worth as the economic value of bank\u2019s assets, liabilities and\noff-balance sheet positions get affected due to variation in market interest rates.  The interest rate risk\nwhen viewed from these two perspectives is known as \u2018earnings perspective\u2019 and \u2018economic value\u2019\nperspective, respectively. The risk from the earnings perspective can be measured as changes in the Net\nInterest Income (NII) or Net Interest Margin (NIM). There are many analytical techniques for\nmeasurement and management of Interest Rate Risk. In the context of poor MIS, slow pace of\ncomputerisation in FIs, the traditional Gap analysis is considered to be a suitable  method   to   measure\nthe Interest Rate Risk in the initial phase of the ALM system. However, the FIs, which are better\nequipped, would have the option of deploying\nadvanced IRR management techniques with the approval of their Board / ALCO, in addition to the Gap\nAnalysis prescribed under the guidelines. It is the intention of RBI to move over to the modern10techniques of Interest Rate Risk measurement like Duration Gap Analysis, Simulation and Value at Risk\nover time when FIs acquire sufficient expertise and sophistication in acquiring and handling MIS.\nThe Gap or Mismatch risk can be measured by calculating Gaps over different time intervals as at a given\ndate. Gap analysis measures mismatches between rate sensitive liabilities and rate sensitive assets\n(including off-balance sheet positions). An asset or liability is normally classified as rate sensitive if:\ni)  within  the time interval under consideration, there is a cash flow;\nii)  the interest rate resets/ reprices contractually during the interval;\niii)  it is contractually pre-payable or withdrawable before the stated  maturities;\niv)  It is dependent on the changes in the Bank Rate by RBI.\n8.2  The Gap Report should be generated by grouping rate sensitive liabilities,  assets and off-balance\nsheet positions into time buckets according to residual maturity or next  re-pricing period, whichever is\nearlier. All investments, advances, deposits, borrowings, purchased funds, etc. that mature/re-price within\na specified timeframe are interest rate sensitive. Similarly, any principal repayment of loan is also rate\nsensitive if the FI expects to receive it within the time horizon. This includes final principal repayment and\ninterim instalments. Certain assets and liabilities carry floating rates of interest that vary with a reference\nrate and hence, these items get re-priced at pre-determined intervals. Such assets and liabilities are rate\nsensitive at the time of re-pricing.   While the interest rates on term deposits and bonds are generally fixed\nduring their currency, the interest rates on advances could be re-priced any number of occasions, on the\npre-determined reset / re-pricing dates and the new rate would normally correspond to the changes in\nPLR.\nThe interest rate gaps may be identified in the following time buckets:\ni)  1-28 days\nii)  29 days and upto 3 months\niii)  Over 3 months and upto 6 months\niv)  Over 6 months and upto 1 year\nv)  Over 1 year and upto 3 years\nvi)  Over 3 years and upto 5 years\nvii)  Over 5 years and upto 7 years\nviii)  Over 7 years and upto 10 years\nix)   Over 10 years\nx)  Non-sensitive11The various items of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet items may be classified into\nvarious time-buckets, as explained in Appendix - II  and  the   Reporting Format for interest rate sensitive\nassets and liabilities is given in Annexure II.\n8.3    The Gap is the difference between Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) and Rate Sensitive Liabilities (RSL)\nfor each time bucket. The positive Gap indicates that it has more RSAs than RSLs whereas the negative\nGap indicates that it has more RSLs. The Gap reports indicate whether the institution is in a position to\nbenefit from rising interest rates by having a positive Gap (RSA > RSL) or whether it is in a position to\nbenefit from declining interest rates  by a negative Gap (RSL > RSA). The  Gap can, therefore, be used as\na measure of interest rate sensitivity.\n8.4  Each FI should set   prudential  limits  on interest rate gaps in various time buckets with the approval\nof the Board/ALCO. Such prudential  limits should have a relationship with  the Total Assets ,  Earning\nAssets or Equity.  In addition to the interest rate gap limits, the FIs which are better equipped would\nhave the option of setting the prudential limits in terms of Earnings at Risk ( EaR) or Net Interest Margin\n(NIM) based on their views on interest rate movements with the approval of the Board/ALCO.\n9. General\n9.1 The classification of various components of assets and liabilities into different time buckets for\npreparation of Gap reports (Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity) as indicated in Appendices I & II is\nthe benchmark . FIs which are better equipped to reasonably estimate the behavioural pattern, embedded\noptions, rolls-in and rolls-out, etc of various components of assets and liabilities on the basis of past data /\nempirical studies could classify them in the appropriate time buckets, subject to approval from the ALCO\n/ Board. A copy of the note approved by the ALCO / Board may be sent to the Department of Banking\nSupervision, Financial Institutions Division.\n9.2 The impact of embedded options (i.e. the customers exercising their options for premature closure of\nterm deposits, premature encashment  of bonds and pre-payment of loans and advances) on the liquidity\nand interest rate risks profile of FIs and the magnitude of embedded option risk during the periods of\nvolatility in market interest rates, is quite substantial. FIs should therefore evolve suitable mechanism,\nsupported by empirical studies and behavioural analysis, to estimate the future behaviour of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet items to changes in market variables and estimate the impact of embedded12options. In the absence of adequate historical database, the entire amount payable under the embedded\noptions should be slotted as per the residual period to the earliest exercise date.\n9.3  A scientifically evolved internal transfer pricing model by assigning values on the basis of current\nmarket rates to funds provided and funds used is an important component for effective implementation of\nALM System.  The transfer price mechanism can enhance the management of margin i.e. lending or credit\nspread, the funding or liability spread and mismatch spread. It also helps centralising interest rate risk at\none place which facilitate effective control and management of interest rate risk.  A well defined transfer\npricing system also provide a rational framework for pricing of assets and liabilities.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/10964.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jan 13, 2000", "info": "Asset  Liability Management (ALM) System\nDecember 31, 1999\nRef DBS.FID No. C-11 /01.02.00/99-2000\nTo All India Financial Institutions\nDear Sir,\nAsset  Liability Management (ALM) System\nPlease refer to our Circular FID.No.38/01.02.00/98-99 dated 20th April 1999 forwarding the draft ALM\nguidelines for the FIs.  In the light of the comments received from the FIs and the subsequent meetings\nheld with the select FIs, the draft  guidelines have been reviewed by us and the final guidelines are\nenclosed.  The guidelines should be implemented with effect from 1 April, 2000.\n2. The FIs need to constitute an Asset Liability Committee, headed by CEO/CMD/DMD/ED, on which\nthe senior management of the FI from various relevant functions/departments should be represented.\nThe Management Committee of the Board or any other specific committee constituted for the purpose\nshould oversee the implementation of the ALM System.  Setting up an effective supporting MIS would\nbe critical to successful operationalisation of the ALM system.  In case, some of the FIs have more\nsophisticated system already in place, they may continue with it but should ensure due compliance\nwith the reporting requirements under the guidelines.\n3. The reporting mechanism under the ALM system envisages a liquidity gap report and a report on\ninterest rates sensitivity.  For the liquidity report, various items of assets and liabilities need to be\nclassified into one of the prescribed 10 time-buckets as per their residual maturity / timing of the cash\nflow, as detailed in the guidelines. The liquidity report should be compiled at quarterly intervals,\ncommencing from the position as on 1 April 2000 and at fortnightly  intervals from 1 April 2001.  For\nthe interest rate sensitivity report, the items of assets and liabilities are to be slotted into the\nprescribed10 time-buckets as per the timing of the interest rate sensitivity of the cash flow or the\nrepricing date for the asset or liability, in accordance with the guidelines. The IRS statement should be\nprepared at quarterly intervals  beginning from the position as on 1 April 2000 and at monthly\nintervals from 1 April 2001. It may be noted that the ALM System contemplated in the guidelines2seeks to capture not only the items of assets and liabilities appearing on the balance sheet as on the\nreporting date but also the cash flows  emanating from these items  over the entire life  of the asset,\nliability or the contingent commitments.\n4. Under the guidelines, the prudential liquidity gap limits  for negative gaps in the first two time-\nbuckets (viz. 1 \u2013 14 days and 14 \u2013 28 days) have been fixed at 10 per cent and 15 per cent of the cash\noutflows in the respective time-buckets.  For cumulative negative gaps  across all time-buckets, the\nFIs are expected to fix their own prudential limits, with the approval of the Board / ALCO.  Also for\nthe interest rate  gaps in various time buckets, the prudential limits will have to be fixed by the\nBoard / ALCO  of each FI. The limits for interest rate risk could be set either as simple gap limits or in\nterms of impact on Net Interest Income (NII)/ Net Interest Margin (NIM) or Value / Earnings at Risk .\n5.  Some of the FIs have been granted restricted Authorised Dealer licence by Reserve Bank and are,\ntherefore, not subject to the full scope of reporting requirements under the Exchange Control\nRegulations. Besides, the FIs which do not hold restricted AD licence may also have foreign currency\nexposures.  Hence, the ALM System intends to capture the operations of FIs not only in the domestic\ncurrency but also in various foreign currencies.

In the light of the comments received from the FIs and the subsequent meetings\nheld with the select FIs, the draft  guidelines have been reviewed by us and the final guidelines are\nenclosed.  The guidelines should be implemented with effect from 1 April, 2000.\n2. The FIs need to constitute an Asset Liability Committee, headed by CEO/CMD/DMD/ED, on which\nthe senior management of the FI from various relevant functions/departments should be represented.\nThe Management Committee of the Board or any other specific committee constituted for the purpose\nshould oversee the implementation of the ALM System.  Setting up an effective supporting MIS would\nbe critical to successful operationalisation of the ALM system.  In case, some of the FIs have more\nsophisticated system already in place, they may continue with it but should ensure due compliance\nwith the reporting requirements under the guidelines.\n3. The reporting mechanism under the ALM system envisages a liquidity gap report and a report on\ninterest rates sensitivity.  For the liquidity report, various items of assets and liabilities need to be\nclassified into one of the prescribed 10 time-buckets as per their residual maturity / timing of the cash\nflow, as detailed in the guidelines. The liquidity report should be compiled at quarterly intervals,\ncommencing from the position as on 1 April 2000 and at fortnightly  intervals from 1 April 2001.  For\nthe interest rate sensitivity report, the items of assets and liabilities are to be slotted into the\nprescribed10 time-buckets as per the timing of the interest rate sensitivity of the cash flow or the\nrepricing date for the asset or liability, in accordance with the guidelines. The IRS statement should be\nprepared at quarterly intervals  beginning from the position as on 1 April 2000 and at monthly\nintervals from 1 April 2001. It may be noted that the ALM System contemplated in the guidelines2seeks to capture not only the items of assets and liabilities appearing on the balance sheet as on the\nreporting date but also the cash flows  emanating from these items  over the entire life  of the asset,\nliability or the contingent commitments.\n4. Under the guidelines, the prudential liquidity gap limits  for negative gaps in the first two time-\nbuckets (viz. 1 \u2013 14 days and 14 \u2013 28 days) have been fixed at 10 per cent and 15 per cent of the cash\noutflows in the respective time-buckets.  For cumulative negative gaps  across all time-buckets, the\nFIs are expected to fix their own prudential limits, with the approval of the Board / ALCO.  Also for\nthe interest rate  gaps in various time buckets, the prudential limits will have to be fixed by the\nBoard / ALCO  of each FI. The limits for interest rate risk could be set either as simple gap limits or in\nterms of impact on Net Interest Income (NII)/ Net Interest Margin (NIM) or Value / Earnings at Risk .\n5.  Some of the FIs have been granted restricted Authorised Dealer licence by Reserve Bank and are,\ntherefore, not subject to the full scope of reporting requirements under the Exchange Control\nRegulations. Besides, the FIs which do not hold restricted AD licence may also have foreign currency\nexposures.  Hence, the ALM System intends to capture the operations of FIs not only in the domestic\ncurrency but also in various foreign currencies.  It would, therefore, be necessary for all the FIs to\ncompile the currency-wise  liquidity and IRS reports  in respect of their foreign currency portfolio in\nthe prescribed formats \u2013 which are similar to those prescribed for rupee resources.\n6.

Bandyopadhyay)\nChief General Manager3Guidelines for Asset Liability Management (ALM) System in Financial Institutions (FIs)\nIn the normal course, FIs are exposed to credit and market risks in view of the asset-liability\ntransformation.  With liberalisation in Indian financial markets over the last few years and growing\nintegration of domestic markets with external markets, the risks, particularly the market risks,\nassociated with FIs\u2019 operations have become complex and large, requiring strategic management.  FIs\nare operating in a fairly deregulated environment and are required to determine interest rates on various\nproducts in their liabilities and assets portfolios, both in domestic as well as foreign currencies, on a\ndynamic basis. Intense competition for business involving both the assets and liabilities, together with\nincreasing volatility in the domestic interest rates as also in foreign exchange rates, has brought\npressure on the management of FIs to maintain a good balance amongst spreads, profitability and long-\nterm viability. These pressures call for structured and comprehensive measures for institutionalising an\nintegrated risk management system and not just ad hoc action. The FIs are exposed to several major\nrisks in the course of their business \u2013 generically classified as credit risk, market risk and operational\nrisk \u2013 which underlines the need for effective risk management systems in FIs. The FIs need to address\nthese risks in a structured manner by upgrading the quality of their risk management and adopting\nmore comprehensive ALM practices than has been done hitherto.\n2. The envisaged ALM system seeks to introduce a formalised framework for management of market\nrisks through measuring, monitoring and managing liquidity, exchange rate  and interest rate risks of a\nFI that need to be closely integrated with the FIs\u2019 business strategy.  This note lays down broad\nguidelines for FIs in respect of liquidity, exchange rate and interest rate risk management systems\nwhich form part of the ALM function. The initial focus of the ALM function would be to enforce the\ndiscipline of market risk management viz. managing business after assessing the market risks involved.\nThe objective of a good risk management systems should be to evolve into a strategic tool for effective\nmanagement of FIs.\n3.   The ALM process rests on three pillars:\n\u2022 ALM Information System\n\u00a7 Management  Information  System\n\u00a7 Information availability, accuracy, adequacy and expediency\n\u2022 ALM Organisation\n\u00a7 Structure and responsibilities\n\u00a7 Level of top  management involvement\n\u2022 ALM Process4\u00a7 Risk parameters\n\u00a7 Risk identification\n\u00a7 Risk  measurement\n\u00a7 Risk management\n\u00a7 Risk policies and tolerance levels.\n4.  ALM Information System\n \n ALM has to be supported by a management philosophy which clearly specifies the  risk  policies  and\ntolerance  limits.  This framework needs to be built on sound  methodology  with  necessary supporting\ninformation  system as the central element of the  entire ALM  exercise  is  the  availability  of\nadequate  and  accurate  information  with expedience. Thus, information is the key to the ALM\nprocess. There are various methods prevalent world-wide for measuring risks.  These range from the\nsimple Gap Statement to extremely sophisticated and data intensive Risk Adjusted  Profitability\nMeasurement  methods. The present guidelines would require comparatively simpler information\nsystem for generating liquidity gap and interest rate gap reports.\n5.     ALM  Organisation\n5.1 Successful implementation of the risk management process would require strong comm itment\non the part of the senior management in the FI, to integrate basic operations and strategic decision\nmaking with risk management. The Board should have overall responsibility for management of\nmarket risks and should decide the risk management policy of the FI and set limits for liquidity,\ninterest rate, exchange rate and equity price risks.\n5.2 The ALCO is a decision-making unit, consisting of the FI's senior management including CEO,\nresponsible for integrated balance sheet management from risk-return perspective including the\nstrategic management of interest rate and liquidity risks. While each FI will have to decide the role of\nits ALCO, its powers and responsibilities as also the decisions to be taken by it, its responsibilities\nwould normally include:\n\u2022 monitoring the market risk levels of the FI by ensuring adherence to the various risk-limits set by\nthe Board;5\u2022 articulating the current interest rate view and a view on future direction of interest rate movements\nand base its decisions for future business strategy on this view as also on other parameters\nconsidered relevant.\n\u2022 deciding the business strategy of the FI, both - on the assets and liabilities sides, consistent with the\nFI\u2019s  interest rate view, budget  and pre-determined  risk management objectives. This would, in\nturn, include:\n\u2022 determining the desired maturity profile and mix of the assets and liabilities;\n\u2022 product pricing for both -  assets as well as liabilities side;\n\u2022 deciding the funding strategy i.e. the source and mix of liabilities or sale of assets; the proportion\nof fixed  vs floating rate funds, wholesale  vs retail funds, money market  vs capital market funding\n, domestic vs foreign currency funding,  etc.\n\u2022 reviewing the results of and progress in implementation of the decisions made in the previous\nmeetings\n5.3 The ALM Support Groups consisting of operating staff should be responsible for analysing,\nmonitoring and reporting the risk profiles to the ALCO. The staff should also prepare forecasts\n(simulations) reflecting the impact of various possible changes in market conditions on the balance\nsheet and recommend the action needed to adhere to FI's internal limits.\n5.4   Composition of ALCO\nThe size (number of members) of  ALCO would depend on the size of each institution, business mix\nand organisational complexity. To ensure commitment of the Top Management and timely response to\nmarket dynamics, the CEO/CMD/DMD or the ED should head the Committee. Though the\ncomposition of ALCO could vary across the FIs as per their respective set up and business profile, it\nwould be useful to have the Chiefs of Investment, Credit, Resources Management or Planning, Funds\nManagement / Treasury ( forex and domestic), International Business and Economic Research as the\nmembers of the Committee. In addition, the Head of the Technology Division should also be an invitee\nfor building up of MIS and related computerisation.  Some FIs may even have Sub-committees and\nSupport Groups.\n5.5  Committee of Directors6The Management Committee of the Board or any other Specific Committee constituted by the Board\nshould oversee the implementation of the ALM system and review its functioning periodically.\n6.  ALM Process\n \n The scope of ALM function can be described as follows:\n\u2022 Liquidity   risk  management\n\u2022 Management of market risks\n\u2022 Trading  risk  management\n\u2022 Funding and capital planning\n\u2022 Profit   planning  and  growth  projection\n \n The guidelines contained in this note mainly address Liquidity and Interest Rate risks.\n6.1  Liquidity  Risk  Management\nMeasuring and managing liquidity needs are vital for effective operation of FIs.  By assuring a FI's\nability to meet its liabilities as they become due, liquidity  management  can  reduce  the  probability\nof  an  adverse  situation  developing.  The importance of liquidity transcends individual institutions, as\nliquidity shortfall  in  one  institution  can  have  repercussions  on  the  entire  system. FIs\u2019\nmanagement should measure not only the liquidity positions of FIs on an ongoing basis but also\nexamine how liquidity requirements are likely to evolve under different assumptions. Experience\nshows that assets commonly considered to be liquid, such as Government securities and other money\nmarket instruments, could also become illiquid when the market and players are unidirectional.\nTherefore liquidity has to be tracked through maturity or cash flow mismatches. For measuring and\nmanaging net funding requirements, the use of a maturity ladder and calculation of  cumulative\nsurplus or deficit of funds at selected maturity dates is adopted as a   standard  tool. The format of the\nStatement of Liquidity is furnished in Annexure I.\n6.2   The Maturity Profile,  as  detailed in  Appendix I,  could be used for measuring the  future cash\nflows of  FIs in different time buckets. The time buckets, may be distributed as under:\ni)  1 to 14 days\nii)  15 to 28 days\niii)  29 days and upto 3 months7iv)  Over 3 months and upto 6 months\nv)  Over 6 months and upto 1 year\nvi)  Over 1 year and upto 3 years\nvii)  Over 3 years and upto 5 years\nviii)  Over 5 years and upto 7 years\nix)  Over 7 years andupto 10 years\nx)  Over 10 years.\n6.3  The investments are assumed as illiquid due to lack of depth in the secondary market and are,\ntherefore, generally shown, as per their residual maturity, under respective time buckets. However,\nsome of the FIs may be maintaining securities in the \u2018Trading Book\u2019, which are kept distinct from\nother investments made for retaining relationship with customers. Securities held in the 'Trading Book\u2019\nshould be subject to the following preconditions:\ni) The composition and volume of the Trading Book should be clearly defined;\nii) Maximum maturity/duration of the trading portfolio should be restricted;\niii) The holding period of the trading securities should not exceed 90 days;\niv) Cut-loss limit(s) should be prescribed;\nv) Product-wise defeasance periods (i.e. the time taken to liquidate the \u2018position\u2019\non the basis of liquidity in the secondary market) should be prescribed;\nvi) Such securities should be marked-to-market on a daily/weekly basis and the\nrevaluation gain/loss should be charged to the profit and loss account ; etc.\nFIs which maintain such \u2018Trading Books\u2019 consisting of securities that comply with the above\nstandards, are permitted to show the trading securities under 1-14 days, 15-28 days and 29-90 days\nbuckets on the basis of the defeasance periods. The Board/ALCO of the banks should approve the\nvolume, composition, maximum maturity/duration, holding/ defeasance period, cut loss limits, etc., of\nthe \u2018Trading Book\u2019 . FIs, which are better equipped, will have the option of evolving with the approval\nof the Board / ALCO, an integrated Value at Risk ( VaR) limit for their entire balance sheet including\nthe \u201cBanking Book\u201d and the \u201cTrading Book\u201d, for the rupee as well as foreign currency portfolio. A\ncopy of the approved policy note in this regard, should be forwarded to the Department of Banking\nSupervision, FID, RBI.\n6.4  Within each time bucket there could be mismatches depending on cash inflows  and  outflows.\nWhile the mismatches upto one year would be relevant since these provide early warning signals of\nimpending liquidity problems, the main focus should be on the short-term mismatches viz., 1-14 days8and 15-28 days. FIs however, are expected to monitor their cumulative mismatches (running total)\nacross all time buckets by establishing internal prudential limits with the approval of the Board /\nALCO. The negative gap  during 1-14 days and 15-28 days time-buckets, in normal course, should not\nexceed 10 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, of the cash outflows in each time bucket.  If a FI  in\nview of its current asset-liability profile and the consequential structural mismatches needs higher\ntolerance level, it could operate with higher limit sanctioned by its Board / ALCO giving specific\nreasons on the  need for such higher limit. The discretion to allow a higher tolerance level is intended\nfor a temporary period, i.e. till March 31, 2001.  While determining the tolerance levels, the FIs may\ntake into account all relevant factors based on their asset-liability base, nature of business, future\nstrategy, etc. The RBI is interested in ensuring that the tolerance levels are determined keeping all\nnecessary factors in view and further refined with experience gained in Liquidity Management.\n6.5  The  Statement  of Liquidity   ( Annexure I  )  may be prepared by placing all  cash  inflows  and\noutflows  in the maturity ladder according to the expected timing of cash flows. A maturing liability\nwill be a cash outflow while a maturing asset will be a cash inflow. It would also be necessary to take\ninto account the rupee inflows and outflows on account of forex operations. Thus, the foreign currency\nresources raised abroad but swapped into rupees and deployed in rupee assets, would be reflected in\nthe rupee liquidity statement. Some of the FIs have the practice of disbursing rupee loans to their\nexporter clients but denominating such loans in foreign currency in their books which are extinguished\nby the export proceeds. Such foreign currency denominated loans too would be a part of rupee\nliquidity statement since such loans are created out of rupee resources. As regards the foreign currency\nloans granted out of foreign currency resources on a back-to-back basis, a  currency-wise liquidity\nstatement for each of the foreign currencies in which liabilities and assets have been created,  will\nneed to be prepared in formats at Annexure I-A and Annexure II-A ,  which are similar to the formats\nprescribed for rupee resources.\n7.  Currency  Risk\n7.1 Floating exchange rate arrangement has brought in its wake pronounced volatility adding a new\ndimension to the risk profile of  FIs\u2019 balance sheets.   The  increased capital flows across free\neconomies following deregulation have contributed to increase in the volume of transactions. Large\ncross border flows together with the volatility has rendered the FIs' balance sheets vulnerable to\nexchange rate movements.97.2  Dealing in different currencies brings opportunities as also risks. If the liabilities in  one currency\nexceed the level of assets in the same currency, then the currency mismatch can add value or erode\nvalue depending upon the currency movements. Mismatched currency position, besides exposing the\nbalance sheet to movements in exchange rate, also exposes it to country risk and settlement risk. FIs\nundertake operations in foreign exchange such as borrowings and making loans in foreign currency,\nwhich exposes them to currency or exchange rate  risk. The simplest way to avoid currency risk is to\nensure that mismatches, if any, are reduced to zero or near zero. However, irrespective of the strategies\nadopted, it may not be possible to eliminate currency mismatches altogether.\n7.3     At present, only five FIs (viz. EXIM Bank, ICICI, IDBI, IFCI and IIBI) have been granted by\nRBI (ECD) restricted authorisation to deal in foreign exchange under FERA 1973 while other FIs are\nnot authorised to deal in foreign exchange. The FIs are, therefore, unlike banks, are not subject to the\nfull rigour of the reporting requirements under Exchange Control regulations. Hence, the MAP and\nSIR statements prescribed for banks vide AD (MA Series) circular no. 52 dated 27 December 1997\nissued by RBI (ECD), are not applicable to FIs. In order, however, to capture the liquidity and interest\nrate risk inherent in the foreign currency portfolio of the FIs, it would be necessary to compile, on an\nongoing basis, currency-wise  Statement of Liquidity and IRS Statement, separately for each of the\ncurrencies in which the FIs have an exposure. These statements should be compiled in the formats\nprescribed at Annexure I-A  and Annexure II-A  \u2013 which are similar to the formats  prescribed for the\nrupee resources, at Annexure I and Annexure II to these guidelines.\n8.   Interest  Rate  Risk  (IRR)\n8.1 Interest rate risk is the risk where changes in market interest rates  might adversely affect a FI's\nfinancial condition. The immediate impact of changes in interest rates is on FI's earnings (i.e. reported\nprofits) by changing its Net Interest Income (NII). A long-term impact of changing interest rates is on\nFI's Market Value of Equity (MVE) or Net Worth as the economic value of bank\u2019s assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet positions get affected due to variation in market interest rates.  The interest rate\nrisk when viewed from these two perspectives is known as \u2018earnings perspective\u2019 and \u2018economic\nvalue\u2019 perspective, respectively. The risk from the earnings perspective can be measured as changes in\nthe Net Interest Income (NII) or Net Interest Margin (NIM). There are many analytical techniques for\nmeasurement and management of Interest Rate Risk. In the context of poor MIS, slow pace of\ncomputerisation in FIs, the traditional Gap analysis is considered to be a suitable  method   to   measure10the Interest Rate Risk in the initial phase of the ALM system. However, the FIs, which are better\nequipped, would have the option of deploying\nadvanced IRR management techniques with the approval of their Board / ALCO, in addition to the\nGap Analysis prescribed under the guidelines. It is the intention of RBI to move over to the modern\ntechniques of Interest Rate Risk measurement like Duration Gap Analysis, Simulation and Value at\nRisk over time when FIs acquire sufficient expertise and sophistication in acquiring and handling MIS.\nThe Gap or Mismatch risk can be measured by calculating Gaps over different time intervals as at a\ngiven date. Gap analysis measures mismatches between rate sensitive liabilities and rate sensitive\nassets (including off-balance sheet positions). An asset or liability is normally classified as rate\nsensitive if:\ni)  within  the time interval under consideration, there is a cash flow;\nii)  the interest rate resets/ reprices contractually during the interval;\niii)  it is contractually pre-payable or withdrawable before the stated  maturities;\niv)  It is dependent on the changes in the Bank Rate by RBI.\n8.2  The Gap Report should be generated by grouping rate sensitive liabilities,  assets and off-balance\nsheet positions into time buckets according to residual maturity or next  re-pricing period, whichever is\nearlier. All investments, advances, deposits, borrowings, purchased funds, etc. that mature/re-price\nwithin a specified timeframe are interest rate sensitive. Similarly, any principal repayment of loan is\nalso rate sensitive if the FI expects to receive it within the time horizon. This includes final principal\nrepayment and interim instalments. Certain assets and liabilities carry floating rates of interest that\nvary with a reference rate and hence, these items get re-priced at pre-determined intervals. Such assets\nand liabilities are rate sensitive at the time of re-pricing.   While the interest rates on term deposits and\nbonds are generally fixed during their currency, the interest rates on advances could be re-priced any\nnumber of occasions, on the pre-determined reset / re-pricing dates and the new rate would normally\ncorrespond to the changes in PLR.\nThe interest rate gaps may be identified in the following time buckets:\ni)  1-28 days\nii)  29 days and upto 3 months\niii)  Over 3 months and upto 6 months11iv)  Over 6 months and upto 1 year\nv)  Over 1 year and upto 3 years\nvi)  Over 3 years and upto 5 years\nvii)  Over 5 years and upto 7 years\nviii)  Over 7 years and upto 10 years\nix)   Over 10 years\nx)  Non-sensitive\nThe various items of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet items may be classified\ninto various time-buckets, as explained in Appendix - II  and  the   Reporting Format for interest rate\nsensitive assets and liabilities is given in Annexure II.\n8.3    The Gap is the difference between Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) and Rate Sensitive Liabilities\n(RSL) for each time bucket. The positive Gap indicates that it has more RSAs than RSLs whereas the\nnegative Gap indicates that it has more RSLs. The Gap reports indicate whether the institution is in a\nposition to benefit from rising interest rates by having a positive Gap (RSA > RSL) or whether it is in a\nposition to benefit from declining interest rates  by a negative Gap (RSL > RSA). The  Gap can,\ntherefore, be used as a measure of interest rate sensitivity.\n8.4  Each FI should set   prudential  limits  on interest rate gaps in various time buckets with the\napproval of the Board/ALCO. Such prudential  limits should have a relationship with  the Total Assets\n,  Earning Assets or Equity.  In addition to the interest rate gap limits, the FIs which are better\nequipped would have the option of setting the prudential limits in terms of Earnings at Risk ( EaR) or\nNet Interest Margin (NIM) based on their views on interest rate movements with the approval of the\nBoard/ALCO.\n9. General\n9.1 The classification of various components of assets and liabilities into different time buckets for\npreparation of Gap reports (Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity) as indicated in Appendices I & II is\nthe benchmark . FIs which are better equipped to reasonably estimate the behavioural pattern,\nembedded options, rolls-in and rolls-out, etc of various components of assets and liabilities on the basis\nof past data / empirical studies could classify them in the appropriate time buckets, subject to approval\nfrom the ALCO / Board. A copy of the note approved by the ALCO / Board may be sent to the\nDepartment of Banking Supervision, Financial Institutions Division.129.2 The impact of embedded options (i.e. the customers exercising their options for premature closure\nof term deposits, premature encashment  of bonds and pre-payment of loans and advances) on the\nliquidity and interest rate risks profile of FIs and the magnitude of embedded option risk during the\nperiods of volatility in market interest rates, is quite substantial. FIs should therefore evolve suitable\nmechanism, supported by empirical studies and behavioural analysis, to estimate the future behaviour\nof assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items to changes in market variables and estimate the impact\nof embedded options. In the absence of adequate historical database, the entire amount payable under\nthe embedded options should be slotted as per the residual period to the earliest exercise date.\n9.3  A scientifically evolved internal transfer pricing model by assigning values on the basis of current\nmarket rates to funds provided and funds used is an important component for effective implementation\nof ALM System.  The transfer price mechanism can enhance the management of margin i.e. lending or\ncredit spread, the funding or liability spread and mismatch spread. It also helps centralising interest\nrate risk at one place which facilitate effective control and management of interest rate risk.  A well\ndefined transfer pricing system also provide a rational framework for pricing of assets and liabilities.\nAppendices\nAppendix - I\nMaturity Profile for Liquidity Statement\nOutflows\nHeads of Account Time-bucket category\n1.

E as % of BA Framework for Measuring and Managing Liquidity\n(September 1992)\nIn its work on the supervision of liquidity, the Basle Committee has focused on developing\na greater understanding of the way in which international banks manage their liquidity on a global\nbasis, on the premise that supervision of liquidity is particularly effective if based on a dialogue\nbetween bank and supervisor. This paper brings together practice and techniques currently employed\nby major international banks in a single analytical framework. While no bank may follow this\nframework precisely, it is a model which is believed to be an example of current sound management\npractice and which could provide useful guidance to all banks.\nThe seventh ICBS provides an opportunity for other supervisory authorities to contribute to\nthis work and it is the Committee's intention to prepare a revised version of this paper taking account\nof comments made at Cannes which could then be circulated to supervisory authorities worldwide with\nthe possibility of it being made available through them to commercial banks.\nI.Purpose of the analysis\nMeasuring and managing liquidity are among the most vital activities of commercial\nbanks. By assuring a bank's ability to meet its liabilities as they come due, liquidity management can\nreduce the probability of an irreversible adverse situation developing. Even in cases where a crisis\ndevelops because of a problem elsewhere at a bank, such as a severe deterioration in asset quality or\nthe uncovering of fraud, or where a crisis reflects a generalised  loss of confidence in financial\ninstitutions, the time available to a bank to address the problem will be determined by its liquidity.\nIndeed, the importance of liquidity transcends the individual institution, since a liquidity shortfall at a\nsingle institution can have system-wide repercussions. For this reason, the analysis of liquidity requires\nbank managements to measure not only the liquidity positions of banks on an ongoing basis but also to\nexamine how funding requirements are likely to evolve under crisis scenarios.\nThis paper sets out in general terms the main elements of a model liquidity measurement\nand management framework. The framework strikes a balance between quantitative and qualitative\nfactors used to assess liquidity, and provides a methodology for analysing balance sheet and off-\nbalance-sheet activities consistently.\nWhile this paper focuses on the use of the framework by large banks, the approach it\ndescribes appears to have broad applicability to bank liquidity measurement and control, even for\nsmall, strictly domestic banks. In particular, good management information systems, central liquidity\ncontrol, analysis of net funding requirements under alternative scenarios, diversification of funding\nsources, and contingency planning are crucial elements of strong liquidity management at a bank of\nany size or scope of operations. The information systems and analysis needed to implement the\napproach, however, can probably absorb fewer resources and be much less complex at a smaller\ninstitution or one that is active in fewer markets than the large, internationally active banks\ncontemplated in this paper.\nII. Policy issues\nA. Information and reporting arrangements\nVirtually every financial transaction or commitment has implications for a bank's liquidity.\nMoreover, the transformation of illiquid assets into more liquid ones is a key activity of banks. Thus, a44bank's liquidity policies and liquidity management approach should form key elements of a bank's\ngeneral business strategy. Understanding the context of liquidity management involves examining a\nbank's managerial approach  to funding and liquidity operations and its liquidity planning under\nalternative scenarios .\nIn particular, all banks should have an articulated and specific liquidity policy setting out\nthe general importance management places on liquidity. Such a policy should also enunciate specific\npolicies on particular aspects of liquidity management, such as the relative reliance on the use of\ncertain financial instruments and the encouragement of closer relationships with supervisors. This\ngeneral policy should be approved by a bank's board of directors.\nAn important element in such a policy will be a liquidity reporting structure designed to\nprovide senior management with timely information and to be flexible enough to deal with various\ncontingencies that may arise during crises. Banks that stress the importance of liquidity assign ultimate\nresponsibility  for setting liquidity policy and reviewing liquidity decisions to the bank's highest level of\nmanagement, and their decisions need to be reviewed periodically by the board of directors.\nA bank's investment in information systems  designed to gather and analyse detailed\ninformation on assets and liabilities may need to be substantial. Because market conditions and a\nbank's own liquidity needs change constantly, extensive computer systems are often necessary to\nprovide management with relevant information on an accurate and up-to-date basis. Such systems can\nalso be helpful in projecting the bank's liquidity positions under a variety of conditions. Sometimes\nthese systems are integrated into information systems monitoring other activities or risk exposures of\nthe bank.\nFinally, a schedule of frequent routine liquidity reviews  and less frequent, but more in-\ndepth reviews should be provided for. These reviews provide the opportunity to reexamine and refine a\nbank's liquidity policies and practices in the light of a bank's liquidity experience and developments in\nits business.\nB. Treatment of foreign currencies\nFor banks with an international presence, the treatment of assets and liabilities in multiple\ncurrencies adds a layer of complexity to liquidity management for two reasons. First, banks are often\nless well known to liability holders in foreign currency markets. In the event of market concerns,\nespecially if they relate to a bank's domestic operating environment, these liability holders may not be\nable to distinguish rumour from fact as well or as quickly as domestic currency customers. Second, in\nthe event of a disturbance, a bank may not always be able to mobilise domestic liquidity to meet\nforeign currency funding requirements.\nHence, when a bank conducts its business in multiple currencies, its management must\nmake two key decisions. The first concerns management structure . A bank with funding requirements\nin foreign currencies will generally use one of three approaches. It may completely centralise liquidity\nmanagement (the head office managing liquidity for the whole bank in every currency). Alternatively,\nit may decentralise by assigning operating divisions responsibility for their own liquidity, but subject\nto limits imposed by the head office or frequent, routine reporting to the head office. For example, a\nnon-European bank might assign its London office responsibility for the liquidity management for its\nEuropean operations in all currencies. As a third approach, a bank may assign responsibility for\nliquidity in the home currency and for overall coordination to the home office, and responsibility for\nthe bank's global liquidity in each major foreign currency to the management of the foreign office in\nthe country issuing that currency. For example, the treasurer in the Tokyo office of a non-Japanese\nbank could be responsible for the bank's global liquidity needs in yen. All of these approaches,45however, provide head office management with the opportunity to monitor and control worldwide\nliquidity.\nThe second decision concerns the liquidity strategy in each currency . In the ordinary\ncourse of business, a bank must decide how foreign currency funding needs will be met. To what\nextent, for example, will a bank fund foreign currency needs in domestic currency and convert the\nproceeds to foreign currency through the foreign exchange market or currency swaps? How will a bank\nmanage the associated risk that exchange markets will cease to be available? A bank's assessment will\ndepend on the size of its funding needs, its access to foreign currency funding markets, and its capacity\nto rely on off-balance-sheet instruments (e.g. standby lines of credit, swap facilities, etc.).\nA bank must also develop a back-up liquidity strategy for circumstances in which its\nnormal approach to funding foreign currency operations is disrupted. Such a strategy will call for\ndrawing either on home currency sources and converting them to foreign currency through the\nexchange markets or drawing on back-up sources in particular foreign currencies. For example, back-\nup liquidity for all currencies may be provided by the head office using the home currency, based on\nan assessment of the bank's access to the foreign exchange market and the derivative markets under the\nconditions in which the original liquidity disturbance is likely to occur. Alternatively, a bank's\nmanagement may decide that certain foreign currencies make up a sufficient part of its liquidity needs\nto warrant separate liquidity back-up. In that case, either the home office or the regional treasurer for\neach specific currency would develop a contingency strategy and negotiate liquidity backstop facilities\nfor those currencies.\nIII. A framework for measuring and managing liquidity\nThe framework for assessing and managing bank liquidity presented here has three major\ndimensions: (A) measuring and managing net funding requirements , (B) managing market access , and\n(C) contingency planning .\nA. Measuring and managing net funding requirements\nThe analysis of net funding requirements involves the construction of a maturity ladder and\nthe calculation of a cumulative net excess or deficit of funds at selected maturity dates. A bank's net\nfunding requirements are determined by analysing its future cash flows based on assumptions of the\nfuture behaviour of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items, and then calculating the cumulative\nnet excess over the time frame for the liquidity assessment.\n(i) The maturity ladder\nA maturity ladder should be used to compare a bank's future cash inflows to its future cash\noutflows over a series of specified time periods. Cash inflows arise from maturing assets, saleable non-\nmaturing assets and established credit lines that can be tapped. Cash outflows include liabilities falling\ndue and contingent liabilities, especially committed lines of credit that can be drawn down. In Table 1,\nthe maturity ladder is represented by placing sources and amounts of cash inflows on one side of the\npage and sources and amounts of outflows on the other.\nIn constructing the maturity ladder, a bank has to allocate each cash inflow or outflow to a\ngiven calendar date from a starting point, usually the next day. (A bank must be clear about the\nclearing and settlement conventions it is using to determine its initial point.) As a preliminary step to\nconstructing the maturity ladder, cash inflows can be ranked by the date on which assets mature or a\nconservative estimate of when credit lines can be drawn down. Similarly, cash outflows can be ranked\nby the date on which liabilities fall due, the earliest date a liability holder could exercise an early46repayment option, or the earliest date contingencies can be called. Significant interest and other cash\nflows should also be included. The difference between cash inflows and cash outflows in each period,\nthe excess or deficit of funds, becomes a starting-point for a measure of a bank's future liquidity excess\nor shortfall at a series of points in time.\nIt is this net funding requirement that requires management. Typically, a bank may find\nsubstantial funding gaps in distant periods and will endeavour to fill these gaps by influencing the\nmaturity of transactions so as to offset the gap. For example, if there is a significant funding\nrequirement 30 days hence, a bank may choose to acquire an asset maturing on that day, or seek to\nrenew or roll over a liability. The closer a large gap gets, the more difficult it is to offset. Thus, banks\nwill typically collect data on relatively distant periods so as to maximise the opportunities to close the\ngap before it gets too close. Most banks would regard it as important that any remaining borrowing\nrequirement should be limited to an amount which experience suggests is comfortably within the\nbank's capacity to fund in the market.\n(ii) Alternative scenarios\nEvaluating whether a bank is sufficiently liquid depends in large measure on the behaviour\nof cash flows under different conditions. Analysing liquidity thus entails laying out \"what if\" scenarios.\nThree scenarios provide useful benchmarks: a bank's \"going-concern\" condition, a bank-specific crisis,\nand a general market crisis. Under each scenario, a bank should try to account for any significant\npositive or negative liquidity swings that could occur.\n(a) The going-concern  scenario establishes a benchmark for the \"normal\" behaviour  of balance\nsheet-related cash flows in the ordinary course of business at a bank. This scenario is useful in\nmanaging a bank's use of deposit and other debt markets. By establishing such a benchmark, a bank\ncan manage its net funding requirements so that it is not faced with very large needs on any given day,\nso avoiding the impact of temporary constraints on its ability to roll over liabilities because of market\ndisruptions or concerns about its condition.\n(b) Assessing liquidity under the second scenario, a liquidity  crisis at an individual bank  that\nremains confined to that bank, provides one type of \"worst-case\" benchmark. The key underlying\nassumption in this scenario is that many of the bank's liabilities could not be rolled over or replaced\nand would have to be repaid at maturity so that the bank would have to wind down its books to some\ndegree. This is the scenario implicit in many existing bank supervisory liquidity measures. While a\nsevere liquidity crisis at an individual bank usually stems from a fundamental, bank-specific problem\nnot related to its liquidity, a bank's ability to honour its deposit maturities under such conditions can\nprovide the time that the bank would need to address the underlying problem. If a bank can weather\nsuch a \"worst-case\" scenario, it can almost certainly survive less drastic firm-specific problems.\n(c) The last scenario is some form of general market crisis  where liquidity is affected at all\nbanks in one or more markets. The key underlying assumption that banks need to make in this scenario\nis that severe tiering by perceived credit quality would occur, so that differences in funding access\namong banks or among classes of financial institutions would widen, benefiting some and harming\nothers. Although some banks may believe that central banks would ensure that key markets would\ncontinue to function in some form, severe market disruption would not necessarily be prevented. For\nbank management, this represents a second type of \"worst-case\" scenario that a bank would wish to\nweather. A supervisor or central bank may find this scenario to be of particular interest when surveying\nthe liquidity profile of the entire banking sector. The collective results would suggest the size of the\ntotal liquidity buffer in the banking system and the likely distribution of liquidity problems among\nlarge institutions if the banking system as a whole experiences a shortage of liquidity.47A bank will need to assign the timing of cash flows for each type of asset and liability by\nassessing the probability of the behaviour of those cash flows in the scenario being examined. These\ndecisions about the specific timing and the size of cash flows are an integral part of the construction of\nthe maturity ladder under each scenario. For each funding source, for example, a bank would have to\ndecide whether the liability would be: (1) repaid in full at maturity; (2) gradually run off over the next\nfew weeks; or (3) virtually certain to be rolled over or available if tapped. The bank's historical\nexperience of the pattern of flows and a knowledge of market conventions could guide a bank's\ndecisions, but judgement often plays a large role, especially in crisis scenarios. Uncertainty is an\ninevitable element in choosing between possible behaviour patterns, and that dictates a conservative\napproach that would bias a bank toward assigning later dates to cash inflows and earlier dates to cash\noutflows.\nHence, the timing of cash inflows and outflows on the maturity ladder can differ between\nthe going-concern approach and the two crisis scenarios, as shown in Table 2. In constructing the\ngoing-concern  maturity ladder, conservative assumptions need to be made about the behaviour of cash\nflows that can replace the contractual cash flows. For example, many maturing loans would be rolled\nover in the normal course of business and some proportion of transactions and savings deposits would\nalso be rolled over or could be easily replaced.\nIn a bank-specific crisis  scenario it is assumed that a bank will be unable to roll over or\nreplace many or most of its liabilities, and that it may have to wind down its books to some degree.\nThe assumptions under the third scenario, a general market crisis , may differ quite sharply from the\nassumptions made for a bank-specific crisis. For example, a bank may believe, based upon its\nhistorical experience, that its ability to control the level and timing of future cash flows from a stock of\nsaleable assets in a bank-specific funding crisis would deteriorate little from normal conditions.\nHowever, in a general market crisis, this capacity may fall off sharply if few institutions are willing or\nable to make cash purchases of less liquid assets. On the other hand, a bank that has a high reputation\nin the market may actually benefit from a flight to quality as potential depositors seek out the safest\nhome for their funds. Banks may also anticipate that central banks would ensure that key markets\ncontinue to function but not necessarily without significant disruption.\n(iii) Measuring liquidity over the chosen time-frame\nThe evolution of a bank's liquidity profile under one or more scenarios can be tabulated or\nportrayed graphically, by cumulating the balance of expected cash inflows and cash outflows at several\ntime points. A stylised liquidity graph can be constructed enabling the evolution of the cumulative net\nexcess or deficit of funds to be compared under the three scenarios in order to provide further insights\ninto a bank's liquidity and to check how consistent and realistic the assumptions are for the individual\nbank. For example, a high-quality institution may look very liquid in a going-concern scenario,\nmarginally liquid in a bank-specific crisis and quite liquid in a general market crisis. In contrast, a\nweaker institution might be far less liquid in the general crisis than it would in a bank-specific crisis.\nIt is important to note that the relevant time-frame for active liquidity management is short,\ngenerally extending out no more than a few weeks. While most banks would not actively manage their\nnet funding requirements over a period much longer than four or five weeks, managements may\nconsider information on requirements beyond that time frame to be useful. Clearly, banks active in\nmarkets for longer-term assets and liabilities will need to use a longer time-frame than banks which are\nactive in short-term money markets and which are in a better position to fill funding gaps at short\nnotice. However, even this latter category of banks may find it worthwhile to tailor the maturity of new\ntransactions to offset gaps some time off.\nA longer time horizon may also generate useful information on which to base more48strategic decisions on the extent to which a bank may rely on particular markets.\n(iv) Assumptions used in determining cash flows\nSince a bank's future liquidity position will be affected by factors that cannot always be\nforecast with precision, assumptions need to be reviewed frequently to determine their continuing\nvalidity, especially given the rapidity of change in banking markets. The total number of major\nassumptions to be made, however, is fairly limited. This section attempts to catalogue the liquidity\nassumptions under four broad categories: (a) assets, (b) liabilities, (c) off-balance-sheet activities, and\n(d) other.\n(a) Assets\nAssumptions about a bank's future stock of assets include their potential marketability and\nuse as collateral of existing assets which could increase cash inflows, and the extent to which maturing\nassets will be renewed, and new assets acquired, thus reducing contractual cash inflows.\nDetermining the level of a bank's potential assets  involves answering three questions:\n\u2022 what proportion of maturing assets will a bank be able and willing to  roll over  or renew?\n\u2022 what is the expected level of new loan requests  that will be accepted ?\n\u2022 what is the expected level of draw-downs of commitments to lend  that a bank will need to fund?\nThese commitments may take the form of committed commercial lines without material\nadverse change (MAC) clauses, which a bank may not be legally able to turn away even if the\nborrower's financial condition has deteriorated; committed commercial lines with MAC clauses\nwhich some customers could draw down in crisis scenarios; and other commercial and\nconsumer credit lines.\nIn estimating its normal funding needs, some banks use historical patterns of roll-overs, draw-downs\nand new requests for loans; others conduct a statistical analysis taking account of seasonal and other\neffects believed to determine loan demand (e.g., for consumer loans). Alternatively, a bank may make\njudgmental business projections, or undertake a customer-by-customer assessment for its larger\ncustomers and apply historical relationships to the remainder.\nRoll-overs, draw-downs and new loan requests all represent potential cash drains for a\nbank. Nevertheless, a bank has some leeway to control many of these items depending on the assumed\nscenario. In a crisis situation, for example, a bank might decide to risk damaging some business\nrelationships by refusing to roll over loans that it would make under normal conditions, or it might\nrefuse to honour lending commitments that are not binding.\nIn determining the marketability of assets , the approach segregates the assets into three\ncategories by their degree of relative liquidity:\n\u2022 the most liquid category includes components such as cash, securities, and interbank\nloans. Some of these assets may be immediately convertible into cash at prevailing\nmarket values under almost any scenario (either by outright sale, or for sale and\nrepurchase, or as collateral for secured financing), while others, such as interbank loans\nor some securities, may lose liquidity in a general crisis;\n\u2022 a less liquid category comprises a bank's saleable loan portfolio. The task here is to\ndevelop assumptions about a reasonable schedule for the disposal of a bank's assets.\nSome assets, while marketable, may be viewed as unsaleable within the time frame of\nthe liquidity analysis;\n\u2022 the least liquid category includes essentially unmarketable assets such as loans not\ncapable of being readily sold, bank premises and investments in subsidiaries, as well as,49possibly, severely troubled credits;\n\u2022 assets pledged to third parties are deducted from each category.\nThe view underlying the classification process is that different banks could assign the same\nasset to different categories on the maturity ladder because of differences in their internal asset-liability\nmanagement. For example, a loan categorised  by one bank as a moderately liquid asset - saleable only\nlate in the liquidity analysis time-frame - may be considered a candidate for fairly quick and certain\nliquidation at a bank that operates in a market where loans are frequently transferred, that routinely\nincludes loan-sale clauses in all loan documentation and that has developed a network of customers\nwith whom it has concluded loan-purchase agreements.\nIn categorising assets, a bank would also have to decide how an asset's liquidity would be\naffected under different scenarios. Some assets that may be very liquid during times of normal business\nconditions may be less so during a time of crisis. Consequently, a bank may place an asset in different\ncategories depending on the type of scenario it is forecasting.\n(b) Liabilities\nTo evaluate the cash flows arising from a bank's liabilities, a bank would first examine the\nbehaviour of its liabilities under normal business conditions. This would include establishing:\n\u2022 the normal level of roll-overs of deposits and other liabilities;\n\u2022 the effective maturity of deposits with non-contractual maturities, such as demand\ndeposits and many types of savings accounts;\n\u2022 the normal growth in new deposit accounts.\nAs in assessing roll-overs and new requests for loans, a bank could use several possible\ntechniques to establish the effective maturities of its liabilities, such as using historical patterns of\ndeposit behaviour. For sight deposits, whether of individuals or businesses, many banks conduct a\nstatistical analysis that takes account of seasonal factors, interest rate sensitivities, and other\nmacroeconomic factors. For some large wholesale depositors, a bank may undertake a customer-by-\ncustomer assessment of the probability of roll-over.\nIn examining the cash flows arising from a bank's liabilities in the two crisis scenarios, a\nbank would examine four basic questions:\n\u2022 which sources of funding are likely to stay with a bank under any circumstance, and can\nthese be increased?\n\u2022 which sources of funding can be expected to run off gradually if problems arise, and at what\nrate? Is deposit pricing a means of controlling the rate of runoff?\n\u2022 which maturing liabilities or liabilities with non-contractual maturities can be expected to\nrun off immediately at the first sign of trouble? Are there liabilities with early withdrawal\noptions that are likely to be exercised?\n\u2022 does the bank have back-up facilities that it can draw down?\nThe first two categories represent cash-flow developments that tend to reduce the cash\noutflows projected directly from contractual maturities. In addition to the liabilities identified above, a\nbank's capital and term liabilities not maturing within the horizon of the liquidity analysis provide a\nliquidity buffer.\nThe liabilities that make up the first category may be thought to stay with a bank, even\nunder a \"worst-case\" projection. Some core deposits generally stay with a bank because retail and\nsmall business depositors may rely on the public-sector safety net to shield them from loss, or because\nthe cost of switching banks, especially for some business services such as transactions accounts, is50prohibitive in the very short run.\nThe second category, liabilities that are likely to stay with a bank during periods of mild\ndifficulties and to run off relatively slowly in a crisis, includes core deposits that are not already\nincluded in the first category. In addition to core deposits, in some countries, some level of particular\ntypes of interbank and government funding may remain with a bank during such periods, although\ninterbank and government deposits are often viewed as volatile. A bank's own liability roll-over\nexperience as well as the experiences of other troubled institutions should help in developing a\ntimetable for these cash flows.\nThe third category comprises the remainder of the maturing liabilities, including some\nwithout contractual maturities, such as wholesale deposits. Under each scenario, this approach adopts a\nconservative stance and assumes that these remaining liabilities are repaid at the earliest possible\nmaturity, especially in crisis scenarios, because such money may flow to government securities and\nother safe havens. Factors such as diversification and relationship building are seen as especially\nimportant in evaluating the extent of liability runoff and a bank's capacity to replace funds.\nNevertheless, in a general market crisis, some high-quality institutions may find that they receive\nlarger-than-usual wholesale deposit inflows, even as funding inflows dry up for other market\nparticipants.\nSome banks, for example, smaller banks in regional markets, may also have credit lines\nthat they can draw down to offset cash outflows. While these sorts of facility are somewhat rare among\nlarger banks, the possible use of such lines could be addressed with a bank's liability assumptions.\nWhere such facilities are subject to material adverse change clauses, of course they may be of limited\nvalue, especially in a bank specific crisis.\n(c) Off-balance-sheet activities\nA bank should also examine the potential for substantial cash flows from its off-balance-\nsheet activities (other than the loan commitments already considered), even if such cash flows are not\nalways a part of banks' current liquidity analysis.\nContingent liabilities, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees , represent\npotentially significant cash drains for a bank, but are usually not dependent on a bank's condition. A\nbank may be able to ascertain a \"normal\" level of cash outflows on an ongoing concern basis, and then\nestimate the scope for an increase in these flows during periods of stress. However, a general market\ncrisis may trigger a substantial increase in the amount of draw-downs of letters of credit because of an\nincrease in defaults and bankruptcies in the market.\nOther potential sources of cash outflows include swaps, written over-the-counter (OTC)\noptions, and other interest rate and forward foreign exchange rate contracts . If a bank has a large\nswap book, for example, then it would want to consider the circumstances under which the bank could\nbecome a net payer, and whether or not the potential net payout is significant. For example, if a bank is\na swap market-maker, the possibility exists that in a bank-specific or general market crisis, customers\nwith in-the-money swaps (or a net in-the-money swap position) would seek to reduce their credit\nexposure to the bank by asking the bank to buy back swaps. Similarly, a bank would need to review its\nwritten OTC options book and any outstanding warrants, together with any hedges against these\npositions, since certain types of crises may stimulate an increase in early exercises (for American-style\noptions) or requests that the bank repurchase options. These exercises and repurchase requests could\nresult in an unforeseen cash drain, if hedges either cannot be quickly liquidated to generate cash or\nprovide insufficient cash.\n(d) Other assumptions51The discussion has centred so far on assumptions concerning the behaviour of specific\ninstruments under various scenarios. Looking solely at instruments, however, may ignore some factors\nthat may significantly impact a bank's cash flows.\nBesides the liquidity needs arising from business activities, banks also require excess funds\nto support other operations. For example, many large banks provide clearing services to correspondent\nbanks and financial institutions that generate significant and not always easily predictable cash inflows\nand outflows, the amounts of which depend on the clearing volumes of the correspondent banks.\nUnforeseen fluctuations in these volumes can deplete a bank of needed funds.\nNet overhead expenses, such as rent and salary, although generally not significant enough\nto be considered in banks' liquidity analyses, can in some cases also be sources of cash outflows.\nB. Managing market access\nSome liquidity management techniques are viewed as important not only for their influence\non the assumptions used in constructing the maturity ladders, but also for their direct contribution to\nenhancing a bank's liquidity. Thus, it is important for a bank to review periodically its efforts to\nmaintain the diversification of liabilities , to establish relationships with liability-holders  and to develop\nasset-sales markets .\nAs a check for adequate diversification of liabilities, a bank needs to examine the level of\nreliance on individual funding sources, by instrument type , nature of the provider of funds , and\ngeographic market . In addition, a bank should strive to understand and evaluate the use of\nintercompany financing for its individual business offices.\nBuilding strong relationships with some providers of funding can provide a line of defence\nin a liquidity problem and form an integral part of a bank's liquidity management. The frequency of\ncontact and the frequency of use of a funding source are two possible indicators of the strength of a\nfunding relationship.\nDeveloping markets for asset sales or exploring arrangements under which a bank can\nborrow against assets is the third element of managing market access. The inclusion of loan-sale\nclauses in loan documentation and the frequency of use of some asset-sales markets are two possible\nindicators of a bank's ability to execute asset sales under adverse scenarios.\nC. Contingency planning\nA bank's ability to withstand a net funding requirement in a bank specific or general market\nliquidity crisis can also depend on the calibre of its formal contingency plans. Effective contingency\nplans should address two major questions:\n\u2022 does management have a strategy for handling a crisis?\n\u2022 does management have procedures in place for accessing cash in emergency?\nThe degree to which a bank has addressed these questions realistically, provides management with\nadditional insight as to how a bank may fare in a crisis.\n(i) Strategy\nA game plan for dealing with a crisis should consist of several components. Most\nimportant are those that involve managerial coordination. A contingency plan needs to spell out\nprocedures to ensure that information flows  remain timely and uninterrupted, and that the information\nflows provide senior management with the precise information it needs in order to make quick52decisions. A clear division of responsibility  must be set out so that all personnel understand what is\nexpected of them during a crisis. Confusion in this area can waste resources on certain issues and omit\ncoverage on others.\nAnother major element in the plan should be a strategy for taking certain actions to alter\nasset and liability behaviours . While assumptions can be made as to how an asset or liability will\nbehave under certain conditions (as discussed above), a bank may have the ability to change these\ncharacteristics. For example, a bank may conclude that it will suffer a liquidity deficit in a crisis based\non its assumptions regarding the amount of future cash inflows from saleable assets and outflows from\ndeposit run-offs. During such a crisis, however, a bank may be able to market assets more\naggressively, or sell assets that it would not have sold under normal conditions and thus augment its\ncash inflows from asset sales. Alternatively, it may try to reduce cash outflows by raising its deposit\nrates to retain deposits that might otherwise have moved elsewhere.\nOther components of the game plan involve maintaining customer relationships with\nborrowers, trading and off-balance-sheet counterparties, and liability-holders. As the intensity of a\ncrisis increases, banks must often trade off relationships with some customers for liquidity in order to\nsurvive. By classifying borrowers and trading customers according to their importance to the bank, a\nbank can determine which relationships it may need to forgo at different points in a crisis. At the same\ntime, relationships with lenders become more important in a crisis. If a bank's strategy requires liability\nmanagers to maintain strong ongoing links with lenders and large liability-holders during periods of\nrelative calm, the bank will be better positioned to secure sources of funds during emergencies.\nAn additional, pragmatic element that may be important is how a bank deals with the press\nand broadcast media . Astute public relations management can help a bank avoid the spread of public\nrumours that can result in significant run-offs by retail depositors and institutional investors.\n(ii) Back-up liquidity\nContingency plans should also include procedures for making up cash flow shortfalls in\nemergency situations. Banks have available to them several sources of such funds, including\npreviously unused credit facilities and the domestic central bank. Depending on the severity of a crisis,\na bank may choose - or be forced - to use one or more of these sources. The plan should spell out as\nclearly as possible the amount of funds a bank has available from these sources, and under what\nscenarios a bank could use them.\nTable 1\nThe maturity ladder based on contractual maturities\nDAY 1:\nCash Inflows Cash Outflows Excess/(Shortfall)\nMaturing liabilities with\nMaturing assets 100contractual maturities 50\nInterest receivable 20Interest payable 10\nAsset sales 50Other deposit runoffs 30\nDrawdowns on Com.

As part of its on-going efforts to address international bank supervisory issues, the Basle\nCommittee is issuing the attached paper for comment by banks and other financial market participants\non the management of interest rate risk. In this as in many other areas sound controls are of crucial\nimportance. It is essential that banks have a comprehensive risk management process in place, that\neffectively identifies, measures, monitors and controls interest rate risk exposures, and that is subject to\nappropriate board and senior management oversight. The attached paper describes each of these\nelements, drawing upon experience in member countries and principles established in earlier\npublications by the Committee. The objective of the paper is to outline a number of principles for use\nby supervisory authorities when evaluating banks' interest rate risk management.\n2. The supervisory capital requirements established by the Basle Committee will, as from\nend-1997, cover interest rate risk in the trading activities of banks.2 This paper is intended to set out\nprinciples of more general application for the management of interest rate risk, independent of whether\nthe positions are part of the trading book or reflect banks' non-trading activities.\n3.  In developing these principles, the Committee has drawn not only on supervisory guidance\nin member countries but also on the comments of the banking industry on the Committee's earlier\npaper, issued for consultation in April 1993.3 In addition, the present paper incorporates many of the\nprinciples contained in the guidance issued by the Committee for derivatives activities ,4 which are\nreflected in the qualitative parameters for model-users in the recently published capital standards for\nmarket risk.\n4. These principles are intended to be of general application, based as they are on practices\ncurrently used by many international banks, even though their specific application will depend to some\nextent on the complexity and range of activities undertaken by individual banks. Supervisory\nauthorities should, therefore, use them to re-assess their own supervisory methods and procedures for\nmonitoring how banks control interest rate risk. While the exact approach chosen by individual\nsupervisors will depend upon a host of factors, including their on-site and off-site supervisory\ntechniques and the degree to which external auditors are also used in the supervisory function,  all\nmembers of the Basle Committee agree that the principles set out here provide the standards to\nbe used by national supervisory authorities in evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of a\nbank's interest rate risk management.555. The Basle Committee is also distributing this paper to supervisory authorities world wide in\nthe belief that the principles presented will provide a useful framework for prudent supervision of\ninterest rate risk. More generally, the Committee wishes to emphasise that sound risk management\npractices are essential to the prudent operation of banks and to promoting stability in the financial\nsystem as a whole.\n6. This paper also provides supervisory authorities with a framework for obtaining\ninformation on interest rate risk. It broadly describes the types of basic information that should be\navailable to supervisory authorities to help them in evaluating banks' interest rate risk exposures. This\ninformation can then be used in a variety of ways by supervisory authorities to provide quantitative\nassessments of the interest rate risk faced by banks.\n7. After careful consideration of the comments received on the April 1993 proposal, the\nCommittee has set out principles for sound interest rate risk management, rather than establishing a\nmore standardised measure for interest rate risk. The Committee will, however, keep the need for such\nmore standardised measures under review and may, at a later stage, revisit its approach in this area. In\nthat context, the Committee is aware that industry techniques for measuring and managing interest rate\nrisk are continuing to evolve, particularly for products with uncertain cash flows or repricing dates,\nsuch as many mortgage-related products and retail deposits.\n8. Even though the Committee is not currently proposing capital charges specifically for\ninterest rate risk, all banks should have enough capital to support the risks they incur, including those\narising from interest rate risk. Individual supervisors may, of course, decide to apply capital charges to\ntheir banking system in general or to individual banks that are more extensively exposed to interest rate\nrisk, or whose risk management processes are unsatisfactory.\n9. The Committee stipulates in the five sections III to VII of the paper the following twelve\nprinciples for banking supervisory authorities to apply in assessing banks' management of interest rate\nrisk:\nA. The role of the board and senior management\nPrinciple 1:\nIn order to carry out its responsibilities, the board of directors in a bank should approve\ninterest rate risk management policies and procedures, and should be informed regularly\nof the interest rate risk exposure of the bank.\nPrinciple 2:\nSenior management must ensure that the structure of the bank's business and the level of\ninterest rate risk it assumes are effectively managed, that appropriate policies and\nprocedures are established to control and limit these risks, and that resources are available\nfor evaluating and controlling interest rate risk.\nPrinciple 3:\nBanks should have a risk management function with clearly defined duties that reports risk\nexposures directly to senior management and the board of directors and is sufficiently\nindependent from the business lines of the bank. Larger or more complex banks should\nhave units responsible for the design and administration of the bank's interest rate risk\nmanagement system.56B. Policies and procedures\nPrinciple 4:\nIt is essential that banks' interest rate risk policies and procedures be clearly defined and\nconsistent with the nature and complexity of their activities. These policies should address\nthe bank's exposures on a consolidated basis and, as appropriate, also at the level of\nindividual affiliates.\nPrinciple 5:\nIt is important that banks identify the risks inherent in new products and activities and\nensure these are subject to adequate procedures and controls before being introduced or\nundertaken. Major hedging or risk management initiatives should be approved in advance\nby the board or its appropriate delegated committee.\nC. Measurement and monitoring system\nPrinciple 6:\nIt is essential that banks have interest rate risk measurement systems that capture all\nmaterial sources of interest rate risk and that assess the effect of interest rate changes in\nways which are consistent with the scope of their activities. The assumptions underlying the\nsystem should be clearly understood by risk managers and bank management.\nPrinciple 7:\nBanks must establish and enforce operating limits and other practices that maintain\nexposures within levels consistent with their internal policies.\nPrinciple 8:\nBanks should measure their vulnerability to loss under stressful market conditions -\nincluding the breakdown of key assumptions - and consider those results when establishing\nand reviewing their policies and limits for interest rate risk.\nPrinciple 9:\nBanks must have adequate information systems for monitoring and reporting interest rate\nexposures to senior management and boards of directors on a timely basis.\nD. Independent controls\nPrinciple 10:\nBanks must have adequate internal controls for their interest rate risk management\nprocess and should evaluate the adequacy and integrity of those controls periodically.\nIndividuals responsible for evaluating control procedures must be independent of the\nfunction they are assigned to review.\nPrinciple 11:57Banks should periodically conduct an independent review of the adequacy and integrity of\ntheir risk management processes. Such reviews should be available to relevant supervisory\nauthorities.\nE. Information for supervisory authorities\nPrinciple 12:\nThe G-10 supervisory authorities will obtain from banks sufficient and timely information\nwith which to evaluate their level of interest rate risk. This information should take\nappropriate account of the range of maturities and currencies in each bank's portfolio, as\nwell as other relevant factors, such as the distinction between trading and non-trading\nactivities. Other supervisory authorities are recommended to obtain similar information.\n10. Comment was invited on all aspects of this paper, including the two Annexes , by 15th\nApril 1997.\nI.Sources and effects of interest rate risk\n1. Interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank's financial condition to adverse movements in\ninterest rates. Accepting this risk is a normal part of banking and can be an important source of\nprofitability and shareholder value. However, excessive interest rate risk can pose a significant threat\nto a bank's earnings and capital base. Changes in interest rates affect a bank's earnings by changing its\nnet interest income and the level of other interest-sensitive income and operating expenses. Changes in\ninterest rates also affect the underlying value of the bank's assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet\ninstruments because the present value of future cash flows (and in some cases, the cash flows\nthemselves) change when interest rates change. Accordingly, an effective risk management process\nthat maintains interest rate risk within prudent levels is essential to the safety and soundness of banks.\n2. Before setting out some principles for inter est rate risk management, a brief introduction to\nthe sources and effects of interest rate risk might be helpful. Thus, the following sections describe the\nprimary forms of interest rate risk to which banks are typically exposed. These include repricing risk,\nyield curve risk, basis risk and optionality, each of which is discussed in greater detail below. These\nsections also describe the two most common perspectives for assessing a bank's interest rate risk\nexposure: the earnings perspective and the economic value perspective. As the names suggest, the\nearnings perspective focuses on the impact of interest rate changes on a bank's near-term earnings,\nwhile the economic value perspective focuses on a bank's underlying value.\n1.Sources of interest rate risk\n1. Repricing risk : As financial intermediaries, banks encounter interest rate risk in several\nways. The primary and most often discussed form of interest rate risk arises from timing differences in\nthe maturity (for fixed rate) and repricing (for floating rate) of bank assets, liabilities and off-balance-\nsheet (OBS) positions. While such repricing mismatches are fundamental to the business of banking,\nthey can expose a bank's income and underlying economic value to unanticipated fluctuations as\ninterest rates vary. For instance, a bank that funded a long-term fixed rate loan with a short-term\ndeposit could face a decline in both the future income arising from the position and its underlying\nvalue if interest rates increase. These declines arise because the cash flows on the loan are fixed over\nits lifetime, while the interest paid on the funding is variable, and increases after the short-term deposit\nmatures.582. Yield curve risk : Repricing mismatches can also expose a bank to changes in the slope and\nshape of the yield curve. Yield curve risk arises when unanticipated shifts of the yield curve have\nadverse effects on a bank's income or underlying economic value. For instance, the underlying\neconomic value of a long position in 10-year government bonds hedged by a short position in 5-year\ngovernment notes could decline sharply if the yield curve steepens, even if the position is hedged\nagainst parallel movements in the yield curve.\n3. Basis risk : Another important source of interest rate risk (commonly referred to as basis\nrisk) arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different\ninstruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics. When interest rates change, these\ndifferences can give rise to unexpected changes in the cash flows and earnings spread between assets,\nliabilities and OBS instruments of similar maturities or repricing frequencies. For example, a strategy\nof funding a one-year loan that reprices monthly based on the one-month US. Treasury Bill rate, with a\none-year deposit that reprices monthly based on one-month Libor, exposes the institution to the risk\nthat the spread between the two index rates may change unexpectedly.\n4. Optionality : An additional and increasingly important source of interest rate risk arises\nfrom the options embedded in many bank assets, liabilities and OBS portfolios. Formally, an option\nprovides the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy, sell, or in some manner alter the cash flow\nof an instrument or financial contract. Options may be stand-alone instruments such as exchange-\ntraded options and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts, or they may be embedded within otherwise\nstandard instruments. While banks use exchange-traded and OTC-options in both trading and non-\ntrading accounts, instruments with embedded options are generally most important in non-trading\nactivities. They include various types of bonds and notes with call or put provisions, loans which give\nborrowers the right to prepay balances, and various types of non-maturity deposit instruments which\ngive depositors the right to withdraw funds at any time, often without any penalties. If not adequately\nmanaged, the asymmetrical payoff characteristics of instruments with optionality features can pose\nsignificant risk, particularly to those who sell them, since the options held, both explicit and embedded,\nare generally exercised to the advantage of the holder and the disadvantage of the seller. Moreover, an\nincreasing array of options can involve significant leverage which can magnify the influences (both\nnegative and positive) of option positions on the financial condition of the firm.\n2.Effects of interest rate risk\n1. As the discussion above suggests, changes in interest rates can have adverse effects both on\na bank's earnings and its economic value. This has given rise to two separate, but complementary,\nperspectives for assessing a bank's interest rate risk exposure.\n2. Earnings perspective : In the earnings perspective, the focus of analysis is the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on accrual or reported earnings. This is the traditional approach to interest rate\nrisk assessment taken by many banks, particularly in the past. Variation in earnings is an important\nfocal point for interest rate risk analysis because reduced earnings or outright losses can threaten the\nfinancial stability of an institution by undermining its capital adequacy, by shaking market confidence,\nand by weakening liquidity.\n3. In this regard, the component of earnings that has traditionally rec eived the most attention\nis net interest income (i.e. the difference between total interest income and total interest expense). This\nfocus reflects both the importance of net interest income in banks' overall earnings and its direct and\neasily understood link to changes in interest rates. However, as banks have expanded increasingly into59activities that generate fee-based and other non-interest income, a broader focus on overall net income\n- incorporating both interest and non-interest income and expenses - has become more common. The\nnon-interest income arising from many activities, such as loan servicing and various asset\nsecuritisation programmes, can be highly sensitive to market interest rates. For example, some banks\nprovide the servicing and loan administration function for mortgage loan pools in return for a fee based\non the volume of assets it administers. When interest rates fall, the servicing bank may experience a\ndecline in its fee income as the underlying mortgages prepay. In addition, even traditional sources of\nnon-interest income such as transaction processing fees are becoming more interest rate sensitive. This\nincreased sensitivity has led both bank management and supervisors to take a broader view of the\npotential effects of changes in market interest rates on bank earnings.\n4. Economic value perspective : Variation in market interest rates can also affect the\neconomic value of a bank's assets, liabilities and OBS positions. Thus, the sensitivity of a bank's\neconomic value to fluctuations in interest rates is a particularly important consideration of\nshareholders, management and supervisors alike. The economic value of an instrument represents an\nassessment of the present value of its expected net cash flows, discounted to reflect market rates. By\nextension, the economic value of a bank can be viewed as the present value of bank's expected net cash\nflows, defined as the expected cash flows on assets minus the expected cash flows on liabilities plus\nthe expected net cash flows on OBS positions. In this sense, the economic value perspective reflects\none view of the sensitivity of the net worth of the bank to fluctuations in interest rates.\n5. Since the economic value perspective considers the potential impact of interest rate\nchanges on the present value of all future cash flows, it provides a more comprehensive view of the\npotential long-term effects of changes in interest rates than is offered by the earnings perspective. This\ncomprehensive view is important since changes in near-term earnings - the typical focus of the\nearnings perspective - may not provide an accurate indication of the impact of interest rate movements\non the bank's overall positions.\n6. Embedded losses : The earnings and economic value perspectives discussed thus far focus\non how future changes in interest rates may affect a bank's financial performance. When evaluating the\nlevel of interest rate risk it is willing and able to assume, a bank should also consider the impact that\npast interest rates may have on future performance. In particular, instruments that are not marked to\nmarket may already contain embedded gains or losses due to past rate movements. These gains or\nlosses may be reflected over time in the bank's earnings. For example, a long-term fixed-rate loan\nentered into when interest rates were low and refunded more recently with liabilities bearing a higher\nrate of interest will, over its remaining life, represent a drain on the bank's resources.\nII. Sound interest rate risk management practices\n1. Sound interest rate  risk management involves the application of four basic elements in the\nmanagement of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments:\n\u2022Appropriate board and senior management oversight ;\n\u2022Adequate risk management policies and procedures;\n\u2022Appropriate risk measurement and monitoring systems; and\n\u2022Comprehensive internal controls and independent external audits.\n2. The specific manner in  which a bank applies these elements in managing its interest rate risk will\ndepend upon the complexity and nature of its holdings and activities as well as on the level of interest rate risk\nexposure. What constitutes adequate interest rate risk management practices can therefore vary considerably. For\nexample, less complex banks whose senior managers are actively involved in the details of day-to-day operations\nmay be able to rely on relatively basic interest rate risk management processes. However, other organisations that\nhave more complex and wide-ranging activities are likely to require more elaborate and formal interest rate risk60management processes, to address their broad range of financial activities and to provide senior management with\nthe information they need to monitor and direct day-to-day activities. Moreover, the more complex interest rate\nrisk management processes employed at such banks require adequate internal controls that include audits or other\nappropriate oversight mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the information used by senior officials in overseeing\ncompliance with policies and limits. The individuals involved in the risk management process or the risk\nmanagement units must be sufficiently independent from the business lines to ensure an adequate separation of\nduties and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.\n3. As with other risk factor categories, the Committee believes that interest rate risk should be\nmonitored on a consolidated basis, to include interest rate exposures in subsidiaries. However, while consolidation\nprovides a comprehensive measure, in respect of interest rate risk it may underestimate risk when positions in one\naffiliate offset positions in another. This is because a conventional accounting consolidation may allow theoretical\noffsets between such positions from which a bank may not in practice be able to benefit because of legal or\noperational constraints. Management should recognise the potential for consolidated measures to understate risks\nin such circumstances.\nIII. Board and senior management oversight of interest rate risk5\nEffective oversight by a bank's board of directors and senior management is critical to a\nsound interest rate risk management process. It is essential that these individuals are aware of their\nresponsibilities with regard to interest rate risk management and that they adequately perform their\nroles in overseeing and managing interest rate risk.\n1.Board of directors\n1. The board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for understanding the nature and the\nlevel of interest rate risk taken by the bank. The board should approve broad business strategies and\nsignificant policies that govern or influence the interest rate risk of the bank. It should review the\noverall objectives of the bank with respect to interest rate risk and should ensure the provision of clear\nguidance regarding the level of interest rate risk acceptable to the bank. The board should also approve\npolicies and procedures that identify lines of authority and responsibility for managing interest rate risk\nexposures.\n2. Accordingly, the board of directors is responsible for approving the overall policies of the\nbank with respect to interest rate risk and for ensuring that management takes the steps necessary to\nidentify, measure, monitor, and control these risks. The board or a specific committee of the board\nshould periodically review information that is sufficient in detail and timeliness to allow it to\nunderstand and assess the performance of management in monitoring and controlling these risks in\ncompliance with the bank's board-approved policies. Such reviews should be conducted regularly,\nbeing carried out more frequently where the bank holds significant positions in complex instruments.\nIn addition, the board or one of its committees should periodically re-evaluate significant interest rate\nrisk management policies and procedures as well as overall business strategies that affect the interest\nrate risk exposure of the bank.\n3. The board of directors should encourage discussions between its members and senior\nmanagement - as well as between senior management and others in the bank -regarding the bank's\ninterest rate risk exposures and management process. Board members need not have detailed technical\nknowledge of complex financial instruments, legal issues, or of sophisticated risk management\ntechniques. They have the responsibility, however, to ensure that senior management has a full\nunderstanding of the risks incurred by the bank and that the bank has personnel available who have the\nnecessary technical skills to control these risks.\nPrinciple 1:61In order to carry out its responsibilities, the board of directors in a bank should approve interest\nrate risk management policies and procedures, and should be informed regularly of the interest\nrate risk exposure of the bank.\n2.Senior management\n1. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that the bank has adequate policies and\nprocedures for managing interest rate risk on both a long-term and day-to-day basis and that it\nmaintains clear lines of authority and responsibility for managing and controlling this risk.\nManagement is also responsible for maintaining:\n\u2022 appropriate limits on risk taking;\n\u2022 adequate systems and standards for measuring risk;\n\u2022 standards for valuing positions and measuring performance;\n\u2022 a comprehensive interest rate risk reporting and interest rate risk management review\nprocess; and\n\u2022 effective internal controls.\n2. Interest rate risk reports to senior management should provide aggregate information as\nwell as sufficient supporting detail to enable management to assess the sensitivity of the institution to\nchanges in market conditions and other important risk factors. Senior management should also review\nperiodically the organisation's interest rate risk management policies and procedures to ensure that they\nremain appropriate and sound. Senior management should also encourage and participate in\ndiscussions with members of the board and - where appropriate to the size and complexity of the bank\n- with risk management staff regarding risk measurement, reporting and management procedures.\n3. Management should ensure that analysis and risk management activities related to interest\nrate risk are conducted by competent staff with technical knowledge and experience consistent with the\nnature and scope of the bank's activities. There should be sufficient depth in staff resources to manage\nthese activities and to accommodate the temporary absence of key personnel.\nPrinciple 2:\nSenior management must ensure that the structure of the bank's business and the level of\ninterest rate risk it assumes are effectively managed, that appropriate policies and procedures\nare established to control and limit these risks, and that resources are available for evaluating\nand controlling interest rate risk.\n3.Independent risk management function\n1. Banks should establish a risk management function for monitoring their interest rate risk.\nThis function should provide reasonable assurance that all activities and all aspects of interest rate risk\nare covered by a bank's risk management system. It should be separated from and sufficiently\nindependent of the business lines to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure adequate separation of duties.\nThe risk management function may be part of a more general operations, audit, compliance, risk\nmanagement or treasury unit. Moreover, it should report risk exposures directly to both senior-level\nmanagement and the board of directors. The personnel charged with measuring and monitoring interest\nrate risk should have a well-founded understanding of all the types of interest rate risk faced\nthroughout the bank. Compensation policies for these individuals should be adequate to attract and\nretain personnel qualified to assess the risk.\n2. Larger or more  complex banks should have a unit for designing and administering a bank's62interest rate risk management system. The size and scope of such a unit should be in accordance with\nthe size and the structure of the bank. It should also be commensurate with the volume and complexity\nof interest rate risk incurred by the bank and the complexity of its transactions and commitments.\nPrinciple 3:\nBanks should have a risk management function with clearly defined duties that reports risk\nexposures directly to senior management and the board of directors and is sufficiently\nindependent from the business lines of the bank. Larger or more complex banks should have\nunits responsible for the design and administration of the bank's interest rate risk management\nsystem.\nIV. Adequate risk management policies and procedures\n1. Banks should have clearly-defined policies and procedures for limiting and controlling\ninterest rate risk. These policies should address the bank's exposures not only on a consolidated basis\nbut also, as appropriate, at specific affiliates or other units of the bank. Such policies and procedures\nshould delineate lines of responsibility and accountability over interest rate risk management decisions\nand should clearly define authorised instruments, hedging strategies and position-taking opportunities.\nInterest rate risk policies should also identify quantitative parameters that define the level of interest\nrate risk acceptable for the bank. Where appropriate, such limits should be further specified for certain\ntypes of instruments, portfolios, and activities. All interest rate risk policies should be reviewed\nperiodically and revised as needed.\n2. Management, whether through policies or operating procedures, should define the structure\nof managerial responsibilities and oversight, including lines of authority and responsibility for\ndeveloping strategies and tactics used in managing the bank's interest rate risk exposure. Individuals\nand/or committees responsible for interest rate risk management decisions should be clearly identified.\nIn addition, management should define the specific procedures and approvals necessary for exceptions\nto policies, limits, and authorisations.\n3. A policy statement identifying the types of instruments and activities that the bank ma y\nemploy or conduct is one means whereby management can communicate their tolerance of risk. If such\na statement is prepared, it should clearly identify permissible instruments, either specifically or by their\ncharacteristics, and should also describe the purposes or objectives for which they may be used. The\nstatement should also delineate a clear set of institutional procedures for acquiring specific\ninstruments, managing portfolios, and controlling the bank's aggregate interest rate risk exposure.\nPrinciple 4:\nIt is essential that banks' interest rate risk policies and procedures be clearly defined and\nconsistent with the nature and complexity of their activities. These policies should address the\nbank's exposures on a consolidated basis and, as appropriate, also at the level of individual\naffiliates.\n4. Products and activities that are new to the bank should undergo a careful pre-acquisition\nreview to ensure that the bank understands their interest rate risk characteristics and can incorporate\nthem into its risk management process. When analysing whether or not a product or activity introduces\na new element of interest rate risk exposure, the bank should be aware that changes to an instrument's\nmaturity, repricing or repayment terms can materially affect the product's interest rate risk\ncharacteristics. To take a simple example, a decision to buy and hold a 30-year treasury bond would63represent a significantly different interest rate risk strategy for a bank that had previously limited its\ninvestment maturities to less than 3 years. Similarly, a bank specialising in fixed-rate short-term\ncommercial loans that then engages in residential fixed-rate mortgage lending should be aware of the\noptionality features of the risk embedded in many mortgage products that allow the borrower to prepay\nthe loan at any time with little, if any, penalty.\n5. Prior to introducing a new product, hedging, or position-taking strategy, management\nshould ensure that adequate operational procedures and risk control systems are in place. The board or\nits appropriate delegated committee should also approve major hedging or risk management initiatives\nin advance of their implementation. Proposals to undertake new instruments or new strategies should\ncontain these features:\n\u2022 a description of the relevant product or strategy;\n\u2022 an identification of the resources required to establish sound and effective interest rate risk\nmanagement of the product or activity;\n\u2022 an analysis of the reasonableness of the proposed activities in relation to the bank's overall\nfinancial condition and capital levels; and\n\u2022 the procedures to be used to measure, monitor and control the risks of the proposed product\nor activity.\nPrinciple 5:\nIt is important that banks identify the interest rate risks inherent in new products and activities\nand ensure these are subject to adequate procedures and controls before being introduced or\nundertaken. Major hedging or risk management initiatives should be approved in advance by\nthe board or its appropriate delegated committee.\nV. Risk measurement and monitoring system\nIn general, but depending on the complexity and range of activities of the individual bank,\nbanks should have interest rate risk measurement systems that assess the effects of rate changes on\nboth earnings and economic value. These systems should provide meaningful measures of a bank's\ncurrent levels of interest rate risk exposure, and should be capable of identifying any excessive\nexposures that might arise.\n1.Interest rate risk measurement\n1. Measurement systems should:\n\u2022 assess all material interest rate risk associated with a bank's assets, liabilities, and OBS\npositions;\n\u2022 utilise generally-accepted financial concepts and risk measurement techniques; and\n\u2022 have well-documented assumptions and parameters.\n2. A bank's int erest rate risk measurement system should address all material sources of\ninterest rate risk including repricing, yield curve, basis and option risk exposures. In many cases, the\ninterest rate characteristics of a bank's largest holdings will dominate its aggregate risk profile. While\nall of a bank's holdings should receive appropriate treatment, measurement systems should evaluate\nsuch concentrations with particular rigor. Interest rate risk measurement systems should also provide\nrigorous treatment of those instruments which might significantly affect a bank's aggregate position,\neven if they do not represent a major concentration. Instruments with significant embedded or explicit\noption characteristics should receive special attention.643. A number of tech niques are available for measuring the interest rate risk exposure of both\nearnings and economic value. Their complexity ranges from simple calculations to static simulations\nusing current holdings to highly sophisticated dynamic modelling techniques that reflect potential\nfuture business and business decisions.\n4. The simplest techniques for measuring a bank's interest rate risk exposure begin with a\nmaturity/repricing schedule that distributes interest-sensitive assets, liabilities and OBS positions into\n\"time-bands\" according to their maturity (if fixed rate) or time remaining to their next repricing (if\nfloating rate). These schedules can be used to generate simple indicators of the interest rate risk\nsensitivity of both earnings and economic value to changing interest rates. When this approach is used\nto assess the interest rate risk of current earnings, it is typically referred to as gap analysis . The size of\nthe gap for a given time-band - that is, assets minus liabilities plus OBS exposures that reprice or\nmature within that time-band -gives an indication of the bank's repricing risk exposure.\n5. A maturity/repricing schedule can also be used to evaluate the effects of changing interest\nrates on a bank's economic value by applying sensitivity weights to each time-band. Typically, such\nweights are based on estimates of the duration of the assets and liabilities that fall into each time-band,\nwhere duration is a measure of the percent change in the economic value of a position that will occur\ngiven a small change in the level of interest rates. Duration-based weights can be used in combination\nwith a maturity/repricing schedule to provide a rough approximation of the change in a bank's\neconomic value that would occur given a particular set of changes in market interest rates.\n6. Many banks (especially those using complex financial instruments or otherwise having\ncomplex risk profiles) employ more sophisticated interest rate risk measurement systems than those\nbased on simple maturity/repricing schedules. These simulation techniques typically involve detailed\nassessments of the potential effects of changes in interest rates on earnings and economic value by\nsimulating the future path of interest rates and their impact on cash flows. In static simulations, the\ncash flows arising solely from the bank's current on-and off-balance-sheet positions are assessed. In a\ndynamic simulation approach, the simulation builds in more detailed assumptions about the future\ncourse of interest rates and expected changes in a bank's business activity over that time. These more\nsophisticated techniques allow for dynamic interaction of payments streams and interest rates, and\nbetter capture the effect of embedded or explicit options.\n7. Regardless of the measurement system, the usef ulness of each technique depends on the\nvalidity of the underlying assumptions and the accuracy of the basic methodologies used to model\ninterest rate risk exposure. In designing interest rate risk measurement systems, banks should ensure\nthat the degree of detail about the nature of their interest-sensitive positions is commensurate with the\ncomplexity and risk inherent in those positions. For instance, using gap analysis, the precision of\ninterest rate risk measurement depends in part on the number of time-bands into which positions are\naggregated. Clearly, aggregation of positions/cash flows into broad time-bands implies some loss of\nprecision. In practice, the bank must assess the significance of the potential loss of precision in\ndetermining the extent of aggregation and simplification to be built into the measurement approach.\n8. Estimates of interest rate risk exposure, whether linked to earnings or economic value,\nutilise, in some form, forecasts of the potential course of future interest rates. For risk management\npurposes, banks should incorporate a change in interest rates that is sufficiently large to encompass the\nrisks attendant to their holdings. Banks should consider the use of multiple scenarios, including\npotential effects in changes in the relationships among interest rates (i.e. yield curve risk and basis risk)\nas well as changes in the general level of interest rates. For determining probable changes in interest\nrates, simulation techniques could, for example, be used. Statistical analysis can also play an important\nrole in evaluating correlation assumptions with respect to basis or yield curve risk.659. The integrity and timeliness of data on current positions is also a key component of the risk\nmeasurement process. A bank should ensure that all material positions and cash flows, whether\nstemming from on- or off-balance-sheet positions, are incorporated into the measurement system on a\ntimely basis. Where applicable, these data should include information on the coupon rates or cash\nflows of associated instruments and contracts. Any manual adjustments to underlying data should be\nclearly documented, and the nature and reasons for the adjustments should be clearly understood. In\nparticular, any adjustments to expected cash flows for expected prepayments or early redemptions\nshould be well-reasoned and such adjustments should be available for review.\n10. In assessing the results of interest rate risk measurement systems, it is important that the\nassumptions underlying the system be clearly understood by risk managers and bank management. In\nparticular, techniques using sophisticated simulations should be used carefully so that they do not\nbecome \"black boxes\", producing numbers that have the appearance of precision, but that in fact are\nnot very accurate when their specific assumptions and parameters are revealed. Key assumptions\nshould be recognised by senior management and risk managers and should be re-evaluated at least\nannually. They should also be clearly documented and their significance understood. Assumptions\nused in assessing the interest rate sensitivity of complex instruments and instruments with uncertain\nmaturities should be subject to particularly rigorous documentation and review.\n11. When measuring interest rate risk exposure, two fu rther aspects call for more specific\ncomment: the treatment of those positions where behavioural maturity differs from contractual\nmaturity and the treatment of positions denominated in different currencies. Positions such as savings\nand sight deposits may have contractual maturities or may be open-ended, but in either case, depositors\ngenerally have the option to make withdrawals at any time. In addition, banks often choose not to\nmove rates paid on these deposits in line with changes in market rates. These factors complicate the\nmeasurement of interest rate risk exposure, since not only the value of the positions but also the timing\nof their cash flows can change when interest rates vary. With respect to banks' assets, prepayment\nfeatures of mortgages and mortgage-related instruments also introduce uncertainty about the timing of\ncash flows on these positions. These issues are described in more detail in Annex A, which forms an\nintegral part of this text.\n12. Banks with positions denominated in different cu rrencies can expose themselves to interest\nrate risk in each of these currencies. Since yield curves vary from currency to currency, banks\ngenerally need to assess exposures in each. Banks with the necessary skills and sophistication, and\nwith material multi-currency exposures, may choose to include in their risk measurement process\nmethods to aggregate their exposures in different currencies using assumptions about the correlation\nbetween interest rates in different currencies. A bank that uses correlation assumptions to aggregate\ntheir risk exposures should periodically review the stability and accuracy of those assumptions. The\nbank also should evaluate what its potential risk exposure would be in the event that such correlations\nbreak down.\nPrinciple 6:\nIt is essential that banks have interest rate risk measurement systems that capture all material\nsources of interest rate risk and that assess the effect of interest rate changes in ways which are\nconsistent with the scope of their activities. The assumptions underlying the system should be\nclearly understood by risk managers and bank management.\n2.Limits\n1. The goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a bank's interest rate risk exposure66within self-imposed parameters over a range of possible changes in interest rates. A system of interest\nrate risk limits and risk-taking guidelines provides the means for achieving that goal. Such a system\nshould set boundaries for the level of interest rate risk for the bank and, where appropriate, should also\nprovide the capability to allocate limits to individual portfolios, activities or business units. Limit\nsystems should also ensure that positions that exceed certain predetermined levels receive prompt\nmanagement attention. An appropriate limit system should enable management to control interest rate\nrisk exposures, initiate discussion about opportunities and risks, and monitor actual risk-taking against\npredetermined risk tolerances.\n2. A bank's limits should be consistent with its overall approach to me asuring interest rate\nrisk. Aggregate interest rate risk limits clearly articulating the amount of interest rate risk acceptable to\nthe bank should be approved by the board of directors and re-evaluated periodically. Such limits\nshould be appropriate to the size, complexity and capital adequacy of the bank. Depending on the\nnature of a bank's holdings and its general sophistication, limits can also be identified with individual\nbusiness units, portfolios, instrument types or specific instruments. The level of detail of risk limits\nshould reflect the characteristics of the bank's holdings including the various sources of interest rate\nrisk to which the bank is exposed.\n3. Limit exceptions should be made known to appropriate senior management without delay.\nThere should be a clear policy as to how senior management will be informed and what action should\nbe taken by management in such cases. Particularly important is whether limits are absolute in the\nsense that they should never be exceeded or whether, under specific circumstances, which should be\nclearly described, breaches of limits can be tolerated  for a short period of time. In that context, the\nrelative conservatism of the chosen limits may be an important factor.\n4. Regardless of their level of aggregati on, limits should be consistent with the bank's overall\napproach to measuring interest rate risk and should address the potential impact of changes in market\ninterest rates on reported earnings and the bank's economic value of equity. From an earnings\nperspective, banks should explore limits on the variability of net income as well as net interest income\nin order to fully assess the contribution of non-interest income to the interest rate risk exposure of the\nbank. Such limits usually specify acceptable levels of earnings volatility under specified interest rate\nscenarios.\n5. The form of limits for addressing the effect of rates on a bank's economic value of equity\nshould be appropriate for the size and complexity of its underlying positions. For banks engaged in\ntraditional banking activities and with few holdings of long-term instruments, options, instruments\nwith embedded options, or other instruments whose value may be substantially altered given changes\nin market rates, relatively simple limits on the extent of such holdings may suffice. For more complex\nbanks, however, more detailed limit systems on acceptable changes in the estimated economic value of\nequity of the bank may be needed.\n6. Interest rate risk limits may be keyed to specific scenarios of mo vements in market interest\nrates, such as an increase or decrease of a particular magnitude. The rate movements used in\ndeveloping these limits should represent meaningful stress situations, taking into account historic rate\nvolatility and the time required for management to address exposures. Limits may also be based on\nmeasures derived from the underlying statistical distribution of interest rates, such as earnings at risk or\neconomic value-at-risk techniques. Moreover, specified scenarios should take account of the full range\nof possible sources of interest rate risk to the bank including mismatch, yield curve, basis and option\nrisks. Simple scenarios using parallel shifts in interest rates may be insufficient to identify such risks.\nPrinciple 7:67Banks must establish and enforce operating limits and other practices that maintain exposures\nwithin levels consistent with their internal policies.\n3.Stress testing\nThe risk measurement system should also support a meaningful evaluation of the effect of\nstressful market conditions on the bank. Stress testing should be designed to provide information on\nthe kinds of conditions under which the bank's strategies or positions would be most vulnerable, and\nthus may be tailored to the risk characteristics of the bank. Possible stress scenarios might include\nabrupt changes in the general level of interest rates, changes in the relationships among key market\nrates (i.e. basis risk), changes in the slope and the shape of the yield curve (i.e. yield curve risk),\nchanges in the liquidity of key financial markets or changes in the volatility of market rates. In\naddition, stress scenarios should include conditions under which key business assumptions and\nparameters break down. The stress testing of assumptions used for illiquid instruments and instruments\nwith uncertain contractual maturities is particularly critical to achieving an understanding of the bank's\nrisk profile. In conducting stress tests, special consideration should be given to instruments or markets\nwhere concentrations exist as such positions may be more difficult to liquidate in stressful situations.\nBanks should consider \"worst-case\" scenarios in addition to more probable, but less extreme, events.\nManagement and the board of directors should periodically review both the design and the results of\nsuch stress tests, and ensure that appropriate contingency plans are in place.\nPrinciple 8:\nBanks should measure their vulnerability to loss under stressful market conditions -including the\nbreakdown of key assumptions - and consider those results when establishing and reviewing\ntheir policies and limits for interest rate risk.\n4.Interest rate risk monitoring and reporting\n1. An accurate, informative, and timely management information system is essential for\nmanaging interest rate risk exposure, both to inform management and to support compliance with\nboard policy. Reporting of risk measures should be regular and should clearly compare current\nexposure to policy limits. In addition, past forecasts or risk estimates should be compared with actual\nresults to identify any modelling shortcomings.\n2. Reports detailing the interest rate risk exposure of the bank should be reviewed by the\nboard on a regular basis. While the types of reports prepared for the board and for various levels of\nmanagement will vary based on the bank's interest rate risk profile, they should, at a minimum include\nthe following:\n\u2022 summaries of the bank's aggregate exposures;\n\u2022 reports demonstrating the bank's compliance with policies and limits;\n\u2022 results of stress tests including those assessing breakdowns in key assumptions and\nparameters; and\n\u2022 summaries of the findings of reviews of interest rate risk policies, procedures, and the\nadequacy of the interest rate risk measurement systems, including any findings of internal and\nexternal auditors and retained consultants.\nPrinciple 9:\nBanks must have adequate information systems for monitoring and reporting interest rate\nexposures to senior management and boards of directors on a timely basis.68VI. Comprehensive controls\n1. A bank's interest rate risk management process should be an extension of its overall\nstructure of internal controls. Properly structured, a system of internal controls should promote\neffective and efficient operations, reliable financial and regulatory reporting, and compliance with\nrelevant laws, regulations, and institutional policies. In determining whether internal controls meet\nthose objectives, banks should consider the general control environment of the organisation; the\nprocess for identifying, analysing and managing interest rate risk; the adequacy of management\ninformation systems; and adherence to control activities such as approvals, confirmations and\nreconciliations.\n2. An important element of a bank's internal controls involving in terest rate risk is\ncomprehensive evaluation and review by management. Management should ensure that the various\ncomponents of the bank's interest rate risk management process are regularly reviewed and evaluated\nby individuals who are independent of the function they are assigned to review. Although procedures\nfor establishing limits and for operating within them may vary among banks, periodic reviews should\nbe conducted to determine whether the organisation complies with its interest rate risk policies and\nprocedures. Positions that exceed established limits should receive the prompt attention of appropriate\nmanagement and should be resolved according to the process described in approved policies. Periodic\nreviews of the interest rate risk management process should also address any significant changes in the\nnature of instruments acquired, limits, and internal controls that have occurred since the last review.\nPrinciple 10:\nBanks must have adequate internal controls for their interest rate risk management process and\nshould evaluate the adequacy and integrity of those controls periodically. Individuals responsible\nfor evaluating control procedures must be independent of the function they are assigned to\nreview.\n3. Reviews of the interest rate risk measurement system should include assessments of the\nassumptions, parameters, and methodologies used. Such reviews should seek to understand, test, and\ndocument the current measurement process, evaluate the system's accuracy, and recommend solutions\nto any identified weaknesses. The results of this review, along with any recommendations for\nimprovement, should be reported to the board and acted upon in a timely manner. Since measurement\nsystems may incorporate one or more subsidiary systems or processes, banks should ensure that\nmultiple component systems are well-integrated and consistent with each other in all critical respects.\n4. The frequency and extent to which a bank should re-evaluate its risk measurement\nmethodologies and models depends, in part, on the particular interest rate risk exposures created by\nholdings and activities, the pace and nature of market interest rate changes, and the pace of innovation\nwith respect to measuring and managing interest rate risk. At a minimum banks should review their\nunderlying interest rate risk measurement methodologies and interest rate risk management process\nannually - and more frequently as market conditions dictate.\n5. Banks, particularly those with complex risk exposures, are encouraged to have their\nmeasurement systems reviewed by external auditors or other knowledgeable outside parties. In such\ncases, reports written by external auditors or other outside parties should be available to relevant\nsupervisory authorities. It is essential that any external reviewer be assured that the bank's risk\nmeasurement system is sufficient to capture all material elements of interest rate risk. Such a reviewer\nshould consider the following factors in making the risk assessment, (which are, of course, also\nrelevant to internal reviews):69\u2022 the quantity of interest rate risk, for example:\n- the volume and price sensitivity of various products;\n-  the vulnerability of earnings and capital under differing rate changes including yield curve\ntwists;\n- the exposure of earnings and economic value to various other forms of interest rate risk,\nincluding basis and optionality risk.\n\u2022 the quality of interest rate risk management, for example:\n- whether the bank's internal measurement system is appropriate to the nature, scope, and\ncomplexities of the bank and its activities;\n- whether the bank has an independent risk control unit responsible for the design of the risk\nmanagement system;\n- whether the board of directors and senior management is actively involved in the risk control\nprocess;\n- whether internal policies, controls and procedures concerning interest rate risk are well-\ndocumented and complied with;\n- whether the assumptions of the risk management system are well-documented, data are\naccurately processed, and data aggregation is proper and reliable;\n- whether the organisation has adequate staffing to conduct a sound risk management process.\nPrinciple 11:\nBanks should periodically conduct an independent review of the adequacy and integrity of their\nrisk management processes. Such reviews should be available to relevant supervisory authorities.\nVII. Monitoring of interest rate risk by supervisory authorities\n1. Supervisory authorities should, on a regular basis, obtain sufficient information to assess\nindividual banks' interest rate risk exposures. Such information could be obtained through standardised\nreports that are submitted by banks , through on-site examinations, or by other means. The precise\ninformation obtained could differ among supervisors, but should enable the supervisor to assess the\nlevel and direction of a bank's interest rate exposure. Such information may be generated from the\nbank's internal measures or from more standardised reports. As a minimum, supervisors should have\nenough information to identify and monitor banks that have significant repricing mismatches.\n2. A supervisory reporting framework that collects information on a bank's positions by\nremaining maturity or time to next repricing is one method that supervisors may use for this purpose.\nUnder such an approach, a bank would categorise its interest-sensitive assets, liabilities and OBS\npositions into a series of repricing time-bands or maturity categories. In addition, the information\nshould identify the balances by specific types of instruments that differ significantly in their cash flow\ncharacteristics. For example, supervisors may want to collect additional information on those positions,\nwhere the behavioural maturity is different from the contractual maturity. Reviewing the results of a\nbank's internal model, perhaps under a variety of different assumptions, can also be highly informative.\n3. Banks operating in different currencies can expose themselves to interest rate risk in each\nof these currencies. Supervisory authorities, therefore, may want banks to analyse their exposures in\ndifferent currencies separately, at least when exposures in different currencies are material.\n4. Another difficult question is the extent to which interest rate risk should be viewed on a70whole bank basis or whether the trading book, which is marked to market, and the banking book,\nwhich is often not, should be treated separately. As a general rule, it is desirable for any measurement\nsystem to incorporate interest rate risk exposures arising from the full scope of a bank's activities,\nincluding both trading and non-trading sources. Supervisors may want to obtain more specific\ninformation on how trading and non-trading activities are measured in a bank and whether they are\nincorporated into a single measurement system. They should also ensure that interest rate risk in both\ntrading and non-trading activities is properly managed and controlled.\n5. A meaningful analysis of interest rate risk is only possible if the supervisor receives the\nrelevant information regularly and on a timely basis. Since the risk profile in the traditional banking\nbusiness changes less rapidly than in the trading business, quarterly or semi-annual reporting of the\nformer may be sufficient for many banks. Some of the factors that supervisors may wish to consider\nwhen designing a specific reporting framework are described in greater detail in Annex B, which forms\nan integral part of this text.\nPrinciple 12:\nThe G-10 supervisory authorities will obtain from banks sufficient and timely information with\nwhich to evaluate their level of interest rate risk. This information should take appropriate\naccount of the range of maturities and currencies in each bank's portfolio, as well as other\nrelevant factors, such as the distinction between trading and non-trading activities. Other\nsupervisory authorities are recommended to obtain similar information.\nAnnex A\nInterest rate risk measurement techniques\n1. This annex provides a brief overview of the various techniques used by banks to measure\nthe exposure of earnings and of economic value to changes in interest rates. The variety of the\ntechniques ranges from calculations that rely on simple maturity and repricing tables, to static\nsimulations based on current on- and off-balance-sheet positions, to highly sophisticated dynamic\nmodelling  techniques that incorporate assumptions about the behaviour  of the bank and its customers\nin response to changes in the interest rate environment. Some of these general approaches can be used\nto measure interest rate risk exposure from both an earnings and an economic value perspective, while\nothers are more typically associated with only one of these two perspectives. In addition, the methods\nvary in their ability to capture the different forms of interest rate exposure: the simplest methods are\nintended primarily to capture the risks arising from maturity and repricing mismatches, while the more\nsophisticated methods can more easily capture the full range of risk exposures.\n2. As this discussion suggests, the various measurement approaches described below have\ntheir strengths and weaknesses in terms of providing accurate and reasonable measures of interest rate\nrisk exposure. Ideally, a bank's interest rate risk measurement system would take into account the\nspecific characteristics of each individual interest-sensitive position, and would capture in detail the\nfull range of potential movements in interest rates. In practice, however, measurement systems embody\nsimplifications that move away from this ideal. For instance, in some approaches, positions may be\naggregated into broad categories, rather than modelled separately, introducing a degree of\nmeasurement error into the estimation of their interest rate sensitivity. Similarly, the nature of interest\nrate movements that each approach can incorporate may be limited: in some cases, only a parallel shift\nof the yield curve may be assumed or less than perfect correlations between interest rates may not be71taken into account. Finally, the various approaches differ in their ability to capture the optionality\ninherent in many positions and instruments. The discussion in the following sections will highlight the\nareas of simplification that typically characterise each of the major interest rate risk measurement\ntechniques.\n1.Repricing schedules\n1. The simplest technique s for measuring a bank's interest rate risk exposure begin with a\nmaturity/repricing schedule that distributes interest-sensitive assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet\npositions into a certain number of predefined time-bands according to their maturity (if fixed rate) or\ntime remaining to their next repricing (if floating rate). Those assets and liabilities lacking definitive\nrepricing intervals (e.g. sight deposits or savings accounts) or actual maturities that could vary from\ncontractual maturities (e.g. mortgages with an option for early repayment) are assigned to repricing\ntime-bands according to the judgement and past experience of the bank.\n2. Gap analysis : Simple maturity/repricing schedules can be used to generate simple\nindicators of the interest rate risk sensitivity of both earnings and economic value to changing interest\nrates. When this approach is used to assess the interest rate risk of current earnings, it is typically\nreferred to as gap analysis. Gap analysis was one of the first methods developed to measure a bank's\ninterest rate risk exposure, and continues to be widely used by banks. To evaluate earnings exposure,\ninterest rate sensitive liabilities in each time-band are subtracted from the corresponding interest rate\nsensitive assets to produce a repricing \"gap\" for that time-band. This gap can be multiplied by an\nassumed change in interest rates to yield an approximation of the change in net interest income that\nwould result from such an interest rate movement. The size of the interest rate movement used in the\nanalysis can be based on a variety of factors, including historical experience, simulation of potential\nfuture interest rate movements, and the judgement of bank management.\n3. A negative, or liability-sensitive, gap occurs when liabilities exceed assets (including off-\nbalance-sheet positions) in a given time-band. This means that an increase in market interest rates\ncould cause a decline in net interest income. Conversely, a positive, or asset-sensitive, gap implies that\nthe bank's net interest income could decline as a result of a decrease in the level of interest rates.\n4. These simple gap calculations can be augmented by information on the average coupon on\nassets and liabilities in each time-band. This information can be used to place the results of the gap\ncalculations in context. For instance, information on the average coupon rate could be used to calculate\nestimates of the level of net interest income arising from positions maturing or repricing within a given\ntime-band, which would then provide a \"scale\" to assess the changes in income implied by the gap\nanalysis.\n5. Although gap analysis is a very commonly used approach to assessing interest rate risk\nexposure, it has a number of shortcomings. First, gap analysis does not take account of variation in the\ncharacteristics of different positions within a time-band. In particular, all positions within a given time-\nband are assumed to mature or reprice simultaneously, a simplification that is likely to have greater\nimpact on the precision of the estimates as the degree of aggregation within a time-band increases.\nMoreover, gap analysis ignores differences in spreads between interest rates that could arise as the\nlevel of market interest rates changes (basis risk). In addition, it does not take into account any changes\nin the timing of payments that might occur as a result of changes in the interest rate environment. Thus,\nit fails to account for differences in the sensitivity of income that may arise from option-related\npositions. For these reasons, gap analysis provides only a rough approximation to the actual change in\nnet interest income which would result from the chosen change in the pattern of interest rates. Finally,72most gap analyses fail to capture variability in non-interest revenue and expenses, a potentially\nimportant source of risk to current income.\n6. Duration : A maturity/repricing schedule can also be used to evaluate the effects of\nchanging interest rates on a bank's economic value by applying sensitivity weights to each time-band.\nTypically, such weights are based on estimates of the duration of the assets and liabilities that fall into\neach time-band. Duration is a measure of the percent change in the economic value of a position that\nwill occur given a small change in the level of interest rates.6 It reflects the timing and size of cash\nflows that occur before the instrument's contractual maturity. Generally, the longer the maturity or next\nrepricing date of the instrument and the smaller the payments that occur before maturity (e.g. coupon\npayments), the higher the duration (in absolute value). Higher duration implies that a given change in\nthe level of interest rates will have a larger impact on economic value.\n7. Duration-based weights can be used in combination  with a maturity/repricing schedule to\nprovide a rough approximation of the change in a bank's economic value that would occur given a\nparticular change in the level of market interest rates. Specifically, an \"average\" duration is assumed\nfor the positions that fall into each time-band. The average durations are then multiplied by an assumed\nchange in interest rates to construct a weight for each time-band. In some cases, different weights are\nused for different positions that fall within a time-band, reflecting broad differences in the coupon rates\nand maturities (for instance, one weight for assets, and another for liabilities). In addition, different\ninterest rate changes are sometimes used for different time-bands, generally to reflect differences in the\nvolatility of interest rates along the yield curve. The weighted gaps are aggregated across time-bands to\nproduce an estimate of the change in economic value of the bank that would result from the assumed\nchanges in interest rates.\n8. Alternatively, an in stitution could estimate the effect of changing market rates by\ncalculating the precise duration of each asset, liability and off-balance-sheet position and then deriving\nthe net position for the bank based on these more accurate measures, rather than by applying an\nestimated average duration weight to all positions in a given time-band. This would eliminate potential\nerrors occurring when aggregating positions/cash flows. As another variation, risk weights could also\nbe designed for each time-band on the basis of actual percent changes in market values of hypothetical\ninstruments that would result from a specific scenario of changing market rates. That approach - which\nis sometimes referred to as effective duration - would better capture the non-linearity of price\nmovements arising from significant changes in market interest rates and, thereby, would avoid an\nimportant limitation of duration.\n9. Estimates derived from a standard duration approach may provide an acceptable\napproximation of a bank's exposure to changes in economic value for relatively non-complex banks.\nSuch estimates, however, generally focus on just one form of interest rate risk exposure - repricing\nrisk. As a result, they may not reflect interest rate risk arising - for instance - from changes in the\nrelationship among interest rates within a time-band (basis risk). In addition, because such approaches\ntypically use an average duration for each time-band, the estimates will not reflect differences in the\nactual sensitivity of positions that can arise from differences in coupon rates and the timing of\npayments. Finally, the simplifying assumptions that underlie the calculation of standard duration\nmeans that the risk of options may not be well-captured.\n2.Simulation approaches731. Many banks ( especially those using complex financial instruments or otherwise having\ncomplex risk profiles) employ more sophisticated interest rate risk measurement systems than those\nbased on simple maturity/repricing schedules. These simulation techniques typically involve detailed\nassessments of the potential effects of changes in interest rates on earnings and economic value by\nsimulating the future path of interest rates and their impact on cash flows.\n2. In some sense, simulation techniques can be seen as an exte nsion and refinement of the\nsimple analysis based on maturity/repricing schedules. However, simulation approaches typically\ninvolve a more detailed breakdown of various categories of on- and off-balance-sheet positions, so that\nspecific assumptions about the interest and principal payments and non-interest income and expense\narising from each type of position can be incorporated. In addition, simulation techniques can\nincorporate more varied and refined changes in the interest rate environment, ranging from changes in\nthe slope and shape of the yield curve to interest rate scenarios derived from Monte Carlo simulations.\n3. In static simulations , the cash flows arising solely from the bank's current on- and off-\nbalance-sheet positions are assessed. For assessing the exposure of earnings, simulations estimating the\ncash flows and resulting earnings streams over a specific period are conducted based on one or more\nassumed interest rate scenarios. Typically, although not always, these simulations entail relatively\nstraightforward shifts or tilts of the yield curve, or changes of spreads between different interest rates.\nWhen the resulting cash flows are simulated over the entire expected lives of the bank's holdings and\ndiscounted back to their present values, an estimate of the change in the bank's economic value can be\ncalculated.7\n4. In a dynamic simulation  approach, the simulation builds in more detailed assumptions\nabout the future course of interest rates and the expected changes in a bank's business activity over that\ntime. For instance, the simulation could involve assumptions about a bank's strategy for changing\nadministered interest rates (on savings deposits, for example), about the behaviour of the bank's\ncustomers (e.g. withdrawals from sight and savings deposits) and/or about the future stream of\nbusiness (new loans or other transactions) that the bank will encounter. Such simulations use these\nassumptions about future activities and reinvestment strategies to project expected cash flows and\nestimate dynamic earnings and economic value outcomes. These more sophisticated techniques allow\nfor dynamic interaction of payments stream and interest rates, and better capture the effect of\nembedded or explicit options.\n5. As with other approaches, the usefulness of simulation-based interest rate risk\nmeasurement techniques depends on the validity of the underlying assumptions and the accuracy of the\nbasic methodology. The output of sophisticated simulations must be assessed largely in the light of the\nvalidity of the simulation's assumptions about future interest rates and the behaviour of the bank and its\ncustomers. One of the primary concerns that arises is that such simulations do not become \"black\nboxes\" that lead to false confidence in the precision of the estimates.\n3.Additional issues\n1. One of the most difficult tasks when measuring interest rate risk is how to deal with those\npositions where behavioural maturity differs from contractual maturity (or where there is no stated\ncontractual maturity). On the asset side of the balance sheet, such positions may include mortgages and\nmortgage-related securities, which can be subject to prepayment. In some countries, borrowers have\nthe discretion to prepay their mortgages with little or no penalty, a situation that creates uncertainty\nabout the timing of the cash flows associated with these instruments. Although there is always some\nvolatility in prepayments resulting from demographic factors (such as death, divorce, or job transfers)74and macroeconomic conditions, most of the uncertainty surrounding prepayments arises from the\nresponse of borrowers to movements in interest rates. In general, declines in interest rates result in\nincreasing levels of prepayments, as borrowers refinance their loans at lower yields. In contrast, when\ninterest rates rise unexpectedly, prepayment rates tend to slow, leaving the bank with a larger than\nanticipated volume of mortgages paying below current market rates.\n2. On the liability side, such positions include so-called non-maturity dep osits such as sight\ndeposits and savings deposits, which can be withdrawn, often without penalty, at the discretion of the\ndepositor. The treatment of such deposits is further complicated by the fact that the rates received by\ndepositors tend not to move in close correlation with changes in the general level of market interest\nrates. In fact, banks can and do administer the rates on the accounts with the specific intention of\nmanaging the volume of deposits retained.\n3. The treatment of positions with embed ded options is an issue of special concern in\nmeasuring the exposure of both current earnings and economic value to interest rate changes. In\naddition, the issue arises across the full spectrum of approaches to interest rate measurement, from\nsimple gap analysis to the most sophisticated simulation techniques. In the maturity/ repricing schedule\nframework, banks typically make assumptions about the likely timing of payments and withdrawals on\nthese positions and \"spread\" the balances across time-bands accordingly. For instance, it might be\nassumed that certain percentages of a pool of 30-year mortgages prepay in given years during the life\nof the mortgages. As a result, a large share of the mortgage balances that would have been assigned to\nthe time-band containing 30-year instruments would be spread among nearer term time-bands. In the\nsimulation framework, more sophisticated behavioural assumptions could be employed, such as the use\nof option-adjusted pricing models to better estimate the timing and magnitude of cash flows under\ndifferent interest rate environments. In addition, the simulations can incorporate the bank's assumptions\nabout its likely future treatment of administered interest rates on non-maturity deposits.\n4. As with other elements of interest  rate risk measurement, the quality of the estimates of\ninterest rate risk exposure depends on the quality of the assumptions about the future cash flows on the\npositions with uncertain maturities. Banks typically look to the past behaviour of such positions for\nguidance about these assumptions. For instance, econometric or statistical analysis can be used to\nanalyse the behaviour of a bank's holdings in response to past interest rate movements. Such analysis is\nparticularly useful to assess the likely behaviour of non-maturity deposits, which can be influenced by\nbank-specific factors such as the nature of the bank's customers and local or regional market\nconditions. In the same vein, banks may use statistical prepayment models - either models developed\ninternally by the bank or models purchased from outside developers - to generate expectations about\nmortgage-related cash flows. Finally, input from managerial and business units within the bank could\nhave an important influence, since these areas may be aware of planned changes to business or\nrepricing strategies that could affect the behaviour of the future cash flows of positions with uncertain\nmaturities.\nAnnex B\nMonitoring of interest rate risk by supervisory authorities751. This annex provides a brief ov erview of some of the factors that supervisory authorities\nmight consider in obtaining and analysing information on individual banks' exposures to interest rate\nrisk. As discussed in Section VII of the text, supervisory authorities should obtain information\nsufficient to assess banks' exposures to interest rate risk in a timely fashion. Such information may be\nobtained through on-site examinations, through reports that are submitted by banks on a regular basis,\nor through other means.\n2. While the precise i nformation that is obtained will differ across supervisory authorities,\none approach that some may adopt is a reporting framework that collects information on a bank's\npositions by remaining maturity or time to next repricing. Under such an approach, a bank would\ncategorise its interest-sensitive assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet positions into a series of\nrepricing time-bands or maturity categories. The two sections that follow discuss the considerations\nthat a supervisor should take into account in specifying the number of time-bands and the grouping of\npositions in the reporting framework. The final section of this annex describes some general\napproaches that supervisory authorities may wish to consider in analysing the information that is\nobtained through such a reporting framework.\n1.Time-bands\n1. If a reporting framework is used in which information is collected by time to next\nrepricing, the number and specific categories of time-bands chosen should be sufficient to provide\nsupervisors with a reasonable basis for identifying potentially significant repricing mismatches. The\nbands, however, could vary materially across countries, both in number and in range, depending on the\nlending and investing practices and experiences of banks in individual markets.\n2. The accuracy of a measurement system crucially depends on the precision with which\nmaturities of the positions and cash flows are recorded in the system. For cash flows whose maturity is\nunambiguous, the most precise approach is to use the exact maturity date. Any aggregation of\npositions/cash flows in time-bands or zones necessarily implies a loss of information and a lower\ndegree of precision. For this reason, the number of time-bands in a maturity ladder framework always\nreflects a decision regarding the necessary level of precision and the cost of pursuing greater accuracy.\nSupervisory authorities could use the maturity ladder in the standardised approach of the Amendment\nto the Capital Accord as a starting point when developing a reporting framework that meets their\nparticular needs. The breakdown can, of course, be modified by regulators either in a general way or in\na specific way for banks where the nature of business activities warrants or justifies a different\nreporting form.\n2.Items\n1. As with the time-bands, the breakdown of assets and liabilities could differ among\nsupervisors. A reporting system should include information for all rate-sensitive assets, liabilities and\nOBS positions, and should also identify balances, by specific types of instruments, when those\ninstruments have or may have materially different cash flow characteristics. Specific attention should\nbe given to items whose behavioural maturities differ from contractual maturities such as savings\ndeposits and in some countries mortgage-related instruments. Further information on these issues is\nprovided in Annex A. If the volume of these positions is significant, they should be reported separately\nso as to facilitate an assessment of the underlying options risk in the bank balance sheet structure.\n2. The measurement of interest rate risks may be more difficult if a bank is engaged in trading\nactivities. As a general rule, it is desirable for any measurement system to incorporate interest rate risk76exposures arising from the full scope of a bank's activities, including both trading and non-trading\nsources. Supervisors may wish to permit banks that manage their interest rate risk exposures on an\nintegrated basis to aggregate trading and non-trading positions in the overall reporting framework.\nNevertheless, it is important to recognise that in many countries different accounting rules may apply\nto the trading book and the traditional banking book. Under these accounting rules, losses in the\ntrading book may not always be offset by profits in the banking book if the latter are unrealised.\nFurthermore, unlike the banking book, the composition of the trading portfolio changes significantly\nfrom week to week or even day to day because it is managed separately and according to a different\n(shorter) risk horizon than the banking book. This means that a hedge that is present on a given day\nmay disappear a few days later. Supervisors should, therefore, review the risk management practices\nand information systems of banks that conduct material trading activities and should obtain the\ninformation necessary to ensure that interest rate risk in both trading and non-trading activities is\nproperly managed and controlled. Supervisors may also wish to ask for a separate reporting of interest\nrate risk positions in the trading book.\n3.Supervisory analysis\n1. With a reporting framework designed along these lines regulators should have at their\ndisposal a flexible tool for the analysis of interest rate risk. Since the framework only specifies basic\ninformation to be collected, it allows a more flexible use by regulators than a reporting system with\npre-specified scenarios and assumptions.\n2. By obtaining basic information, supervisors can perform an independent analysis of a\nbank's exposure and can develop their own views regarding the institution's interest rate risk profile.\nRisk analysis could use different interest rate scenarios such as parallel shifts, a flattening or\nsteepening of the yield curve or its inversion with rate changes of different magnitude either based on\nstatistical probabilities or a worst-case analysis. For banks with important exposures in foreign\ncurrencies, calculations based on different assumptions on correlations between interest rates in\ndifferent currencies can be useful. With respect to instruments with behavioural maturities regulators\ncan make calculations based on their own assumptions and compare the results with banks' own\njudgements.\n3. The focus of regulators' quantitative analysis can either be the impact of inte rest rate\nchanges on current earnings or on the economic value of the banks' portfolio. In conducting their\nanalysis information about average yields on assets and liabilities in each time-band may be useful and\nregulators may wish to collect such information in addition to pure position data.\n4. Depending on their overall approach, regulators may carry out this type of analysis either\non a case-by-case basis or as part of a broader system designed to identify outliers with apparently\nexcessive risk-taking.\n5. By varying the parameters as described, regulators gain more insight into an institution's\nrisk profile than with a reporting system that reduces the complexity of interest rate risk to a single\nnumber. In doing so, regulators can become more familiar with the sensitivity of risk measures to\nchanges in the underlying assumptions, and the evaluation process may produce as many insights as\nthe quantitative result itself.\n6. Regardless of the extent of a regulator's own independent quantitative analysis, a  bank's\nown interest rate risk measure, whether reported as part of a basic supervisory reporting system or\nreviewed as part of an individual assessment of a bank's risk management, is an important\nconsideration in the supervisory process. Reviewing the results of a bank's internal model can be77highly informative, but can also be a difficult process because of the multitude of assumptions and\nmodelling techniques that are important, but which need to be made transparent to supervisors. To be\nmost useful, the information received should indicate the contribution of principal elements of a bank's\nportfolio to the risk profile under different assumptions with respect to interest rate changes and the\nmarket response. Finally, any quantitative analysis should be supplemented by a review of internal\nmanagement reports in order to gain greater insights into management's evaluation and management of\nrisks, its methods for measuring exposures, and factors not reflected in the information available in the\nlimited reporting to supervisors.\n1Although still technically a consultative paper subject to changes in the light of comments still to be received, this\npaper is included in the present volume because of the importance the Committee attaches to the sound management\nof interest rate risk.\n2Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks , January 1996.\n3Measurement of Banks' Exposure to Interest Rate Risk,  April 1993.\n4Risk Management Guidelines for Derivatives , July 1994.\n5This section refers to a management structure composed of a board of directors and senior management. The\nCommittee is aware that there are significant differences in legislative and regulatory frameworks across countries as\nregards the functions of the board of directors and senior management. In some countries, the board has the main, if\nnot exclusive, function of supervising the executive body (senior management, general management) so as to ensure\nthat the latter fulfils its tasks. For this reason, in some cases, it is known as a supervisory board. This means that the\nboard has no executive functions. In other countries, by contrast, the board has a broader competence in that it lays\ndown the general framework for the management of the bank. Owing to these differences, the notions of the board of\ndirectors and the senior management are used in this paper not to identify legal constructs but rather to label two\ndecision-making functions within a bank.\n6In its simplest form, duration measures changes in economic value resulting f rom a percentage change of interest\nrates under the simplifying assumptions that changes in value are proportional to changes in the level of interest\nrates and that the timing of payments is fixed. Two important modifications of simple duration are commonly used\nthat relax one or both of these assumptions. The first case is so-called modified duration. Modified duration - which\nis standard duration divided by 1 + r, where r is the level of market interest rates - is an elasticity. As such, it reflects\nthe percentage change in the economic value of the instrument for a given percentage change in 1 + r. As with\nsimple duration, it assumes a linear relationship between percentage changes in value and percentage changes in\ninterest rates. The second form of duration relaxes this assumption, as well as the assumption that the timing of\npayments is fixed. Effective duration is the percentage change in the price of the relevant instrument for a basis point\nchange in yield.\n7The duration analysis described in the previous section can be viewed as a very simple form of static simulation.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/10962.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jan 10, 2000", "info": "Annexure\nDraft Guidelines for diversification into Insurance business\nby banks/financial institutions\n1.(a) Necessary modifications in the legal framework governing various enactments will\nhave to be carried out by the Government before permitting the banks/financial\ninstitutions to undertake insurance business.\n(b) Necessary approvals from appropriate authorities are required to be taken by\nbanks/financial institutions before entering into MOU with any insurance partner.\n2.

As you are\naware, the procedure for calculation of CRR has undergone change with effect from the fortnight\nbeginning Nov. 6,1999 in terms of instructions contained in para 5 of our Circular letter DBOD\nNo. BC.113/12.01.001/99-2000 dated 29-10-99. Accordingly, the prescribed CRR during the\nfortnight will be maintained by every Scheduled Commercial Bank based on its NDTL as on the\nlast Friday of the second preceding fortnight. This and certain other changes have necessitated\nrevision in the format for submission of quarterly interest claims. The new format to be used for\nsubmission of interest claim with effect from the quarter ended December 99 onwards is enclosed\nfor the use of banks. The following points may be noted while compiling the quarterly interest\nclaim in the new format.\nI) All the Scheduled Commercial Banks are required to submit their claim for the first three\nreporting fortnights of the quarter ended Dec.99, i.e., Reporting fortnight 24-9-99, 8-10-\n99 and 22-10-99 in the existing format forwarded with our circular letter DBOD\nNo.BC.156/12.01.001/97-98 dated 23-12-97 referred to above. The interest claim for\nremaining four fortnights of this quarter i.e., Reporting fortnights 22-10-99, 5-11-99, 19-\n11-99 and 3-12-99 should be submitted in the new format.\nIi) In terms of para 2(b) of our circular letter DBOD No.BC.113/12.01.001/99-2000 dated\n29-10-99, the liabilities under FCNR(B) deposits have been exempted from the\nmaintenance of incremental CRR @ 10 percent under Section 42(1A) of RBI Act 1934\nwith effect from fortnight beginning 6-11-99. With this, NRI liabilities under NRE,\nNRNR & FCNR(B) categories are exempted from maintenance of incremental CRR with\neffect from the fortnight beginning November 6,1999.

As the incremental CRR over the NDTL level of 3-5-91 has\nbeen completely withdrawn with effect from fortnight beginning 13-3-99, the Col.No.11\nof the existing format has also been omitted in the new format.\nIv)In terms of para 6 of our circular letter DBOD No.BC.113/12.01.001/1999-2000 dated\n29-10-99, it has been decided to treat `cash in hand' maintained by Scheduled\nCommercial Banks for compliance of CRR for a limited period of two monthscommencing from Dec.1 ,1999 to January 31,2000. In order to indicate cash maintained\nby banks with themselves, new Column No.14 has been introduced to indicate average\ncash balances held with themselves. This column will be operative only for two months\nfrom 1st Dec.99 to 31st January 2000.

It is also observed that some of the banks are still forwarding to us interest claim statement in\nthe form of compressed printout. The figures and other details therein are not easily decipherable.\nYou are, therefore, advised to ensure that the details of claim statements submitted are of\nreasonable standard in respect of size, quality and print.\nPlease ensure that the interest claim statements are signed only by those officials whose signatures\nare on our record.
