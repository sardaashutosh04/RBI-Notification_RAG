Definitions  \n3.1 In these  Directions, unless the context states otherwise , the terms herein shall bear \nthe meanings assigned to them below : \n(a) \u201cavailable for sale\u201d means the category of investment portfolio of AIFIs which includes \ninvestment that do not fall within the HTM (Held To Maturity) or HFT (Held For Trading) \ncategory.  \n(b) \u201cbasis risk\u201d means the risk that emanates from the changes in  interest rate of different \nassets, liabilities and off -balance sheet items in different magnitude s; \n(c) \u201ccapital  funds\u201d means the total regulatory capital  of an AIFI, fulfilling the criteria defined in \nthe prescribed capital regulations  as per Chapter II of these Directions , as per the  last \naudited balance sheet ; \n(d) \u201ccentral counterparty\u201d  (CCP) means a system provider, who by way of novation \ninterposes between system participants in the transactions admitted for settlement, there by \nbecoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer, for the purpose of effecting \nsettlement of their transactions  \n(e) \u201cclearing member\u201d means a memb er of, or a direct participant in, a CCP that is entitled to \nenter into a transaction with the CCP, regardless of whether it enters into trades with a CCP \nfor its own hedging, investment or speculative purposes or whether it also enters into trades \nas a fi nancial intermediary between the CCP and other market participants1; \n(f) \u201cclient\u201d means a party to a transaction with a CCP through either a clearing member \nacting a s a financial intermediary, or a clearing member guaranteeing the performance of the \nclient to the CCP;  \n                                            \n1 For the purpose of these guidelines, where a CCP has a lin k to a second CCP, that second CCP is \nto be treated as a clearing member of the first CCP. Whether the second CCP\u2019s collateral contribution \nto the first CCP is treated as initial margin or a default fund contribution will depend upon the legal \narrangement between the CCPs. In such cases, if any, the Reserve Bank  should be consulted for \ndetermining the treatment of this initial margin and default fund contributions.    \n8 (g) \u201ccontrol \u201d shall have the same meaning as assigned to it u nder clause (27) of Section 2 of \nthe Companies Act, 2013  as amended from time to time ; \n(h) \u201ccorporate bonds / debentures\u201d for the purpose of these Directions mean de bt securities \nwhich create or acknowledge indebtedness, including (i) debentures (ii) bonds (iii) \ncommercial papers (iv) certificate of deposits and such other securities of a company, a \nmultilateral financial institution (MFI) or a body corporate constitu ted by or under a Central \nAct or a State Act, whether constituting a charge on the assets of the company or body \ncorporate or not, and includes convertible instruments and instruments of a perpetual nature, \nbut does not include debt securities issued by Ce ntral Government or a State Government, \nor such other persons as may be specified by the Reserve Bank, security receipts and \nsecuritized debt instruments.  \n(i) \u201ccount erparty credit risk\u201d (CCR)2 means the risk that the counterparty to a transaction \ncould default before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss \nwould occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty  has a \npositive economic value at the time of default.  \n(j) \u201ccredit enhancement\u201d means a contractual arrangement in which an entity provides some \ndegree of added p rotection to other parties to a transaction so as to mitigate the credit risk of \ntheir acquired exposures  \n(k) \u201ccredit risk\u201d means the potential that an AIFI's bor rower or counterparty may fail to meet \nits obligations in accordance with agreed terms and also includes  the possibility of losses \nassociated with diminution in the credit quality of borrowers or counterparties. ; \n(l) \u201ccredit valuation adjustment\u201d means an adjustment to the mid -market valuation of the \nportfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the credit \nrisk due to any fai lure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. This \nadjustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the market \nvalue of the credit risk of both the AIFI and the counterparty;  \n(m) \u201ccross -product netting\u201d  means  the inclusion of transactions of different product \ncategories within the same netting set;  \n(n) \u201ccurrent exposure3 under the Current Exposure Method \u201d means the larger of zero, or the \nmarket value of a transaction or portfolio of transactions within a netting set with a \ncounterparty that would be lost upon the default of the counterparty, assuming no recovery \non the value of those transactions in bankruptcy;  \n(o) \u201dcurrent or valid credit rating\u201d means  a credit rating granted by a c redit rating agency in \nIndia, registered with SEBI and fulfilling the following conditions:  \n(i) The credit rating letter shall not be more than one month old on the date of opening \nof the issue;  \n(ii) The rating rationale shall not be more than one year old on the d ate of opening of the \nissue;  \n(iii) The credit rating letter and the rating rationale shall preferably be part of the offer \ndocument.  \n                                            \n2 Unlike a firm\u2019s exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk  is unilateral \nand only the lending AIFI faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value \nof the transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The market \nvalue is uncertain and can vary ove r time with the movement of underlying market factors.  \n3 Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost   \n9 (iv) In the case of secondary market acquisition, the credit rating of the issue shall be in \nforce and confirmed from the monthly bull etin published by the respective rating agency.  \n(p) \u201cdefault funds \u201d4 shall mean  clearing member\u2019s funded or unfunded contributions towards, \nor underwriting of, a CCP\u2019s mutualised loss sharing arrangements;  \n(q) \u201cdeferred tax assets\u201d shall have the same meaning as assigned under the extant \nAccounting Standards ; \n(r) \u201cderivative\u201d shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in Section 45U(a) of the \nReserve Bank  of India  Act, 1934 ; \n(s) \u201cduration  (Macaulay duration) \u201d5 measures the price volatility of fixed income securities  \noften used in the comparison of the interest rate risk between securities with different \ncoupons and different maturities.  \n(t) \u201cexchange\u201d means \u201cRecognized stock exchange\u201d and shall have the same meaning as \ndefined in Section 2 (f) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956.  \n(u) \u201cfinancial services company\u201d  means a company engaged in the 'business of financial \nservices as defined in the Reserve Bank  of India (Financial Services provided by Banks) \nDirections, 2016 dated May 26, 2016  as amended from time to time;  \n(v) \u201cforward contract\u201d6 means an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an agreed \namount of a financial instrument or currency at an agreed price, for delivery on an agreed \nfuture date.  \n(w) \u201cgeneral market  risk\u201d means risk of losses in on -and off -balance sheet positions arising \nfrom movements in market prices;  \n(x) \u201cGovern ment security\u201d shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in Section 2(f) of \nthe Government Securities Act, 2006.  \n(y) \u201chedging\u201d means taking action to eliminat e or reduce exposure to  any type of  risk; \n(z) \u201chedging set\u201d means a group of risk positions from the transactions within a single netting \nset for which only their  balance is relevant for determining the exposure amount or Exposure \nat Default ( EAD) under the CCR standardised method;  \n(aa) \u201cHeld for Trading\u201d means the category of investment portfolio maintained by AIFIs  with \nthe intention to trade  in securities  by taking advantage of short -term price/interest rate \nmovements;  \n(ab) \u201cHeld to Maturity \u201d means the category of investment portfolio maintained by AIFIs  with \nan intention to hold securiti es upto maturity ; \n                                            \n4 also known as clearing deposits or guarantee fund contributions (or any other names) . The \ndescription given by a CCP to its mutualised loss sh aring arrangements is not determinative of their \nstatus as a default fund, rather, the substance of such arrangements will govern their status . \n5 Duration is calculated  the weighted average of the present value of all the cash flows associated \nwith a fixed  income security. It is expressed in years. The duration of a fixed income security is always \nshorter than its term to maturity, except in the case of zero coupon securities where they are the \nsame . \n6 In contrast to a futures contract, a forward contract i s not transferable or exchange tradable, its \nterms are not standardized and no margin is exchanged. The buyer of the forward contract is said to \nbe long the contract and the seller is said to be short the contract;   \n10 (ac) \u201chorizontal disallowance\u201d means a disallowance of offsets to requir ed capital used for \nassessing market risk for regulatory capital. In order to calculate the capital required for  \ninterest rate risk of a trading book , offsetting  of long and short positions  is permitted . \nHowever,  interest rate risk of instruments at differ ent horizontal points of the yield curve are \nnot perfectly correlated. Hence, th is method  requires that a portion of these offsets be \ndisallowed;  \n(ad) \u201cimplicit support\u201d means the protection arising when a lender  provides support to a \nsecuritisation in excess of its predetermined contractual obligation;  \n(ae) \u201cinfrastructure  projects/ infrastructure lending\u201d means any credit facility in whatever form \nextended by the AIFIs to an y infrastructure facility that is a project in any of the sectors \nincorporated in the latest updated Harmonized Master List of Infrastructure Sub -sectors \npublished by the Government of India;  \n(af) \u201cinitial margin\u201d means a clearing member\u2019s or client\u2019s funded collateral posted to the \nCCP to mitigate the potential future exposure of the CCP to the clear ing member arising \nfrom the possible future change in the value of their transactions. Initial margin shall not \ninclude contributions to a CCP for mutualised loss sharing arrangements7. \n(ag) \u201cinterest rate risk\u201d means risk that the financial value of assets or liabilities (or \ninflows/outflows) will be altered because of fluctuations in interest  rates.  \n(ah) \u201cLarge Exposure \u201d means the sum of all exposure value of an AIFI measured in terms of \nSection 2 2 of Chapter III of these Directions, to a counterparty and / or a group of connected \ncounterparties, if it is equal to or above 10 per  cent of the AIFI\u2019s eligible capital base ; \n(ai) \u201clisted security\u201d is a security, which is listed on a n exchange ; \n(aj) \u201clong position\u201d refers to a position where gains arise from a rise in the value of the \nunderlying;  \n(ak) \u201cmodified duration\u201d or volatility of an interest bearing security is its Macaulay duration \ndivided by one plus  security \u2019s yield to maturity (YTM) p er period . It represents the \npercentage change in a securities \u2019 price for a 100 basis points change in yield8. \n \nwhere:   \nMD = Modified duration  \nP = Gross price (i.e. , clean price plus accrued interest).  \ndP = Corresponding small change in price.  \ndY = Sma ll change in yield compounded with the frequency of the coupon \npayment;  \n(al) \u201cmortgage -backed security\u201d shall have the same meaning as assigned under Master \nDirection Reserve Bank of India (Securitisation of Standard Assets) Directions, 2021  as \namended from time to time ; \n(am) \u201cnetting set\u201d  means a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject \n                                            \n7 In case s where  a CCP uses initial margi n to mutualise losses among the clearing members, it shall \nbe treated as a default fund exposure;  \n8 It is generally accurate for only small changes in the yield.   \n11 to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for whic h netting is recognised for \nregulatory capital purposes.

Introduction  \n4.1 While being essentially risk -based, the prudential regulation for various types of \nfinancial sector entities (banks, security firms, development finance institutions, non -banking \nfinancial entities) across the world tends to be broadly similar. Internationally, many \ndevelopment finance institutions have chosen to adopt Basel III Regulations because the \nmicro -prudential elements of Basel standards generally measure and capitalise financial \nrisks regardless of the entities that undertake them. Basel III strengthens  the institution -level \ni.e., micro prudential regulation, with the intention to raise the resilience of individual financial \ninstitutions in periods of stress. Basel III standards have a macro prudential fo cus also, \naddressing system wide risks, which can build up across the banking/ financial sector, as \nwell as the pro -cyclical amplification of these risks over time. These standards mainly seek \nto raise the quality and level of capital to ensure that financial entities are better able to \nabsorb losses on b oth a going concern and a gone concern basis, increase the risk \ncoverage of the capital framework, introduce leverage ratio to serve as a backstop to the \nrisk-based capital measure, raise the standards for the supervisory review process (Pillar 2) \nand publ ic disclosures (Pillar 3) etc.  \n \n4.2 Over the years, the role of the AIFIs in the Indian financial system has undergone \nsignificant change reflecting the changes in their business models. As the Indian economy \ngrows further, the AIFIs are increasingly being se en as key institutions to promote the flow of \ndirect or indirect credit to the economic sectors they cater to.  It has been decided, therefore, \nto extend Basel III Capital framework to the AIFIs as detailed in the following section s. \n \n5. Approach to Implementa tion and Effective Date   \n5.1 The AIFIs shall implement all the three Pillars of Basel III capital regulations.  Under \nPillar 1, the AIFIs shall adopt the standardized approaches for measurement of capital \ncharge for credit risk and market risk. For operational  risk, AIFIs shall adopt the Basic \nIndicator Approach.  \n \n5.2 The AIFIs shall implement the  Basel III Capital Regulations as per the following \ntimeline:  \nTable 1: Basel III Capital Regulations for AIFIs  \nMinimum capital ratios  April 1,  202410 \nMinimum Common Equity  Tier \n1 (CET1)  5.5%  \nMinimum Tier 1 capital  7% \nMinimum Total Capital*  9% \n \n6. Scope  of Application of Capital Adequacy Framework   \n6.1 An AIFI  shall comply with the capital adequacy ratio requirements at two levels:  \n(i) the consolidated (\u201cGroup\u201d) level11 capital ade quacy ratio requirements, which \n                                            \n10 For NHB, since the accounting year is July -June, the implementatio n shall commence on July 1, \n2024  \n11 A consolidated AIFI should maintain a minimum Capital to Risk -weighted Assets Ratio (C RAR) as \napplicable to a n AIFI on an ongoing basis.   \n15 measure the capital adequacy of an AIFI  based on its capital strength and risk profile \nafter consolidating the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries / joint ventures / \nassociates etc. , except those engaged in insurance and any non -financial activities; \nand \n(ii) the standalone (\u201cSolo\u201d) level capital adequacy ratio requirements, which \nmeasure the capital adequacy of an AIFI  based on its standalone capital strength and \nrisk profile.  \nAccordingly, overseas operations of an AIFI  through its branches will be covered in both the \nabove scenarios.  \n \n6.2 Capital Adequacy  at Group / Consolidated Level  \n6.2.1  All financial subsidiaries except subsidiaries engaged in insurance and any non -\nfinancial activities (both regulated and unregulated) should be fully consolidated for the \npurpose of capital adequacy. This would ensure assessment of capital adequacy at the \ngroup level, taking into account the risk profile of assets and liabilities of the consolidated \nsubsidiaries.  \n \n6.2.2  The insurance and non -financial subsidiaries / joint ventures / associates etc. , of an \nAIFI should not be consolidated for the purpose of capital adequacy. The equity and other \nregulatory capital investments in the insurance and non -financial subsidiaries will be \ndeducted from consolidat ed regulatory capital of the group. Equity  and other regulatory \ncapital investments in the unconsolidated insurance and non -financial entities /subsidiaries of \nAIFIs  (which also include joint ventures / associates of the parent AIFI) will be treated in \nterms of section s 7.5 and 8.13.6 respectively.  \n \n6.2.3  All regulatory adjustments indicated in section  7.4 are required to be made to the \nconsolidated Common Equity Tier 1 capital of the parent AIFI  as indicated therein.  \n \n6.2.4  Minority  interest (i.e., non-controlling int erest) and other capital issued out of \nconsolidated subsidiaries as per section  7.3.1 that is held by third parties will be recognized \nin the consolidated regulatory capital of the parent AIFI  subject to certain conditions as \nstipulated in section  7.3. \n \n6.2.5  AIFIs should ensure that majority owned financial entities that are not consolidated \nfor capital purposes and for which the investment in equity and other instruments eligible for \nregulatory capital  status is deducted, meet their respective regulatory capita l requirements. \nIn case of any shortfall in the regulatory capital requirements in the unconsolidated entity, \nthe shortfall shall be fully deducted from the Common Equity Tier 1 capital.  \n \n6.3 Capital Adequacy at Solo Level  \n6.3.1  While assessing the capital adequacy  of an AIFI at solo level, all regulatory \nadjustments indicated in section  7.4 are required to be made. In addition, investments in the \ncapital instruments of the subsidiaries, which are consolidated in the consolidated financial \nstatements of the group, w ill also have to be deducted from the corresponding capital \ninstruments issued by the AIFI.   \n \n6.3.2  In case of any shortfall in the regulatory capital requirements in the unconsolidated \nentity (e.g. , insurance subsidiary), the shortfall shall be fully deducted from the Common \nEquity Tier 1 capital.  \n \n7. Composition of Regulatory Capital   \n7.1 General  \nAIFIs are required to maintain a minimum Pillar 1 Capital to Risk -weighted Assets Ratio  \n16 (CRAR) of 9% on an on -going basis.  The Reserve Bank  will take into account the relev ant \nrisk factors and the internal capital adequacy assessments of each AIFI to ensure that the \ncapital held by an AIFI  is commensurate with its overall risk profile. This would include, \namong others, the effectiveness of the AIFI\u2019s  risk management systems in identifying, \nassessing / measuring, monitoring and managing various risks including interest rate risk in \nthe banking book, liquidity risk, concentration risk and residual risk. Accordingly, the Reserve \nBank  will consider prescribing a higher level of m inimum capital ratio for each AIFI under the \nPillar 2 framework on the basis of their respective risk profiles and their risk management \nsystems. Further, in terms of the Pillar 2 requirements, AIFIs  are expected to operate at a \nlevel well above the minimu m requirement.  An AIFI  should compute Basel III capital ratios in \nthe following manner:  \nCommon Equity \nTier 1 capital \nratio  = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital  \n \nCredit Risk RWA* + Market Risk RWA + Operational Risk RWA  \nTier 1 capital \nratio = \n  Tier 1 Capital  \n \n   Credit Risk RWA* + Market Risk RWA + Operational Risk RWA  \n \nTotal Capital \n(CRAR)  = \n Total Capital  \n \n   Credit Risk RWA + Market Risk RWA + Operational Risk RWA  \n \n* RWA = Risk weighted Assets ; \n \n7.2 Elements of Regulatory Capital and the Criteria for their Inclusion in the \nDefinition of Regulatory Capital  \n7.2.1  Components of Capital  \nTotal regulatory capital will consist of the sum of the following categories:  \n \n(i) Tier 1 Capital (going -concern capital12) \n(a) Common Equity Tier 1  \n(b) Additional Tier 1  \n \n(ii) Tier 2 Capital (gone -concern capital13) \n \n7.2.2  Limits and Minima   \n(i) As a matter of prudence, it has been decided that AIFIs  shall maintain a minimum \ntotal capital (MTC) of 9% of total risk weighted assets (RWAs) i.e., capital to risk weighted \nassets (CRAR). This will be further divi ded into different components as described under \nclauses (ii) to (vi) below .  \n(ii) Common Equity Tier 1  (CET1) capital shall be at least 5.5% of risk -weighted assets \n(RWAs) i.e. , for credit risk + market risk + operational risk on an ongoing basis.   \n \n(iii) Tier 1 capital shall be at least 7% of RWAs on an ongoing basis. Thus, within the \nminimum Tier  1 capital, Additional Tier 1 capital can be admitted maximum at 1.5% of \nRWAs.   \n                                            \n12 From regulatory capital perspective, going -concern capital is the capital which can absorb losses \nwithout triggering bankruptcy of the AIFI. \n13 Gone -concern capital is the capital which will absorb losses  only in a situation of liquidation of the \nAIFI.  \n17 (iv) Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 Capital) shall be at least 9% of R WAs on an \nongoing basis. Thus, within the minimum CRAR of 9%, Tier 2 capital can be admitted \nmaximum up to 2%.  \n(v) If an AIFI  has complied with the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital \nratios, then the excess Additional Tier  1 capital can be ad mitted for compliance with the \nminimum CRAR of 9% of RWAs.   \n(vi) Thus, with full implementation of capital ratios , the capital requirements  for AIFIs  are \nsummarised as follows:  \n Regulatory Capital  As % to RWAs  \n(i) Minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio  5.5 \n(ii) Additional Tier 1 Capital  1.5 \n(iii) Minimum Tier 1 Capital Ratio [(i) +(i i)]  7.0 \n(iv) Tier 2 Capital  2.0 \n(v) Minimum Total Capital Ratio (MTC) [( iii)+(iv)]  9.0 \n \n7.2.3  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital  \n(i) Elements of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital  \nElements of Common Equity component of Tier 1 capital will comprise the following:  \n(a) Common shares (paid -up equity capital) issued by the AIFI which meet the \ncriteria for classification as common shares for regulator y purposes as given \nin Annex 1 ; \n \n(b) Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of common shares;  \n \n(c) Statutory reserves;  \n \n(d) Capital reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of assets;  \n \n(e) Revaluation reserves14 arising out of change in the c arrying amount of an \nAIFI\u2019s property consequent  upon its revaluation may be reckoned as CET1 \ncapital at a discount of 55  per cent , subject to meeting the following \nconditions:  \n\uf0b7 AIFI is able to sell the property readily at its own will and there is no legal \nimpediment in selling the property;  \n\uf0b7 the revaluation reserves are shown under Schedule: Reserves & Surplus \nin the Balance Sheet of the AIFI;  \n\uf0b7 revaluations are realistic, in accordance with Indian Accounting \nStandards.  \n\uf0b7 valuations are obtained, from two indepe ndent valuers, at least once in \nevery 3 years; where the value of the property has been substantially \nimpaired by any event, these are to be immediately revalued and \nappropriately factored into capital adequacy computations;  \n\uf0b7 the external auditors of the AI FI have not expressed a qualified opinion \non the revaluation of the property;  \n                                            \n14 Revaluation reserves arise from revaluation of assets that are undervalued on the AIFI\u2019s  books, \ntypically AIFI premises. The extent to which the revaluation reserves can be relied upon as a cushion \nfor une xpected losses depends mainly upon the level of certainty that can be placed on estimates of \nthe market values of the relevant assets, the subsequent deterioration in values under difficult market \nconditions or in a forced sale, potential for actual liquid ation at those values, tax consequences of \nrevaluation, etc. Therefore, it would be prudent to consider revaluation  reserves at a discount of 55% \nwhile determining their value for inclusion in capital. Such reserves will have to be reflected on the \nface of  the Balance Sheet as revaluation reserves.   \n18 \uf0b7 the instructions on valuation of properties and other specific requirements \nas mentioned in the circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.50/21.04.018/2006 -07 \nJanuary 4, 2007  on \u2018Valuation of Properties - Empanelment of Valuers\u2019  \naddressed to banks  are strictly adhered to.  \nRevaluation reserves which do not qualify as CET1 capital shall also not qualify as \nTier 2 capi tal. The bank may choose to reckon revaluation reserves in CET1 capital \nor Tier 2 capital at its discretion, subject to fulfilment of all the conditions specified \nabove.  \n \n(f) AIFIs may, at their discretion, reckon foreign currency translation reserve \n(FCTR) arising due to translation of financial statements of their foreign \noperations in terms of Accounting Standard (AS) 11 as CET1 capital at a \ndiscount of 25% subject to meeting the following conditions:  \n\uf0b7 the FCTR is shown under Schedule: Reserves & Surplus in t he Balance \nSheet of the AIFI;  \n\uf0b7 the external auditors of the AIFI have not expressed a qualified opinion on \nthe FCTR.  \n \n(g) Other disclosed free reserves, if any;  \n \n(h) Balance in Profit & Loss Account at the end of the previous financial year;  \n \n(i) AIFIs  may reckon the profits in current financial year for CRAR calculation on \na quarterly basis provided the incremental provisions made for non -\nperforming assets at the end of any of the four quarters of the previous \nfinancial year have not deviated more than 25% from the av erage of the four \nquarters. The amount which can be reckoned would be arrived at by using the \nfollowing formula:  \n                   \nEP t= {NP t \u2013 0.25*D*t}  \n \nWhere;  \n \nEP t = Eligible profit up to the quarter \u2018t\u2019 of the current financial year; t \nvaries from 1 t o 4 \n \nNP t = Net profit up to the quarter \u2018t\u2019  \n \nD= average annual dividend paid /surplus (balance of profits) transferred  \nduring last three years  \n \nNote:  Cumulative net loss upto the quarter end  must be deducted while \ncalculating CET1 for the relevant quarter.  \n(j) While calculating capital adequacy at the consolidated level, common shares \nissued by consolidated subsidiaries of the AIFI and held by third parties (i.e. , \nminority interest) which meet the criteria for inclusion in Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital ( refer to  section  7.3.2); and  \n \n(k) Less: Regulatory adjustments / deductions applied in the calculation of \nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital [i.e. , to be deducted from the sum of items ( a) \nto (j)]. \n \n(ii) Criteria  for Classification as Common  Shares for Regulatory Purposes  \nCommon  Equity is recognised as the highest quality component of capital and is the primary \nform of funding which ensures that an AIFI  remains solvent. Therefore, under Basel  III, \ncommon shares to be included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital must meet the criteria  as \nfurnished in Annex 1 .  \n19  \n7.2.4  Additional Tier 1 Capital  \n(i) Elements of Additional Tier 1 Capital  \nAdditional Tier 1 capital will consist of the sum of the following elements:  \n(i) Perpetual Non -Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS), which comply with the \nregulatory requirements as specified in  Annex 2; \n   \n(ii) Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included in \nAdditional Tier 1 capital;  \n \n(iii) Debt capital instruments el igible for inclusion in Additional Tier 1 capital, which \ncomply with the regulatory requirements as specified in  Annex 3;  \n \n(iv) Any other type of instrument generally notified by the Reserve Bank  from time to time \nfor inclusion in A dditional Tier 1 capital;  \n \n(v) While calculating capital adequacy at the consolidated level, Additional Tier 1 \ninstruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the AIFI and held by third parties \nwhich meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier 1 capi tal (refer to section  7.3.3); \nand  \n \n(vi) Less: Regulatory adjustments / deductions applied in the calculation of Additional \nTier 1 capital [i.e. , to be deducted from the sum of items (i) to (v)].  \n \n(ii) Criteria for Classification as Additional Tier 1 Capital for Re gulatory Purposes  \nUnder Basel II I, the criteria for instruments to be included in Additional Tier 1 capital have \nbeen modified to improve their loss absorbency as indicated in Annex 2, 3 and 14. The \ncriteria for inclusion of Perpetual Non -Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS)  and \nPerpetual Debt Instruments (PDI)  in Additional Tier 1 Capital are furnished in  Annex 2 and \nAnnex 3 , respectively. Annex 14  contains criteria for loss absorption through conversion / \nwrite -down / write -off of Additional Tier 1 instruments on breach of the pre -specified trigger \nand of all non -common equity regulatory c apital instruments at the point of non -viability.  \n \n7.2.5  Tier 2 Capital  \nUnder Basel III, there will be a single set of criteria governing all Tier 2 debt capital \ninstruments.  \n(i) Elements  of Tier 2 Capital   \n(a) General Provisions and Loss Reserves  \ni. Provisions or loan -loss reserves held against future, presently unidentified losses, \nwhich are freely available to meet losses which subsequently materialize, will qualify for \ninclusion within Tier 2 capital. Accordingly, General Provisions on Standard Assets, Floating \nProvisi ons15, incremental provisions in respect of unhedged foreign currency exposures16, \nProvisions held for Country Exposures, Investment Reserve Account, excess provisions \n                                            \n15 AIFIs  shall have the option to net off such provisions from Gross NPAs to arrive at Net NPA or \nreckon it as part of their Tier 2 capital as per Master Circular dated April 1, 2023  on \u201cPrudential norms \non Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances \u201d addressed to \nbanks.  \n16 Please refer to circular Reserve Bank of India (Unhedged Foreign Curre ncy Exposure) Directions, \n2022  issued vide DOR.MRG.REC.76/00 -00-007/2022 -23 dated October 11, 2022 .  \n20 which arise on account of sale of NPAs and \u2018countercyclical provisioning buffer17\u2019 will qua lify \nfor inclusion in Tier 2 capital.  However, these items together will be admitted as Tier 2 capital \nup to a maximum of 1.25% of the total credit risk -weighted assets under the standardized \napproach.   \n \nii. Provisions ascribed to identified deterioration of particular assets or loan liabilities, \nwhether individual or grouped should be excluded. Accordingly, for instance, specific \nprovisions on NPAs, both at individual account or at portfolio level, provisions in lieu of \ndiminution in the fair value of assets in the case of restructured advances, provisions against \ndepreciation in the value of investments will be excluded.  \n \n(b) Debt Capital Instruments  issued by the AIFIs ;  \n \n(c) Preference Share Capital Instruments [ Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares \n(PCPS) / Rede emable Non -Cumulative Preference Shares (RNCPS) / Redeemable \nCumulative Preference Shares (RCPS)] issued by the AIFIs ;  \n \n(d) Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included in \nTier 2 capital;  \n \n(e) While calculating capital adequacy a t the consolidated level, Tier 2 capital \ninstruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the AIFI and held by third parties which \nmeet the criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 capital ( refer to  section  7.3.4); \n \n(f) Any other type of instrument generally notifie d by the Reserve Bank from time to time \nfor inclusion in Tier 2 capital; and  \n \n(g) Less: Regulatory adjustments / deductions applied in the calculation of Tier 2 capital \n[i.e., to be deducted from the sum of items ( a) to (f)].  \n(ii) Criteria for Classification as Ti er 2 Capital for Regulatory Purposes  \nUnder Basel III, the criteria for instruments to be included in Tier 2 capital have been \nmodified to improve their loss absorbency as indicated in Annex 4, 5 and 14. Criteria for \ninclusion of Debt Capital Instruments as Tier 2 capital are furnished in Annex 4. Criteria for \ninclusion of Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares (PCPS) / Redeemable Non -\nCumulati ve Preference Shares (RNCPS) / Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares \n(RCPS) as part of Tier 2 capital are furnished in Annex 5. Annex 14  contains criteria for loss \nabsorption through conversion / w rite-off of all non -common equity regulatory capital \ninstruments at the point of non -viability.   \n7.3 Recognition  of Minority Interest (i.e. , Non-Controlling Interest) and Other \nCapital Issued out of Consolidated Subsidiaries that is Held by Third Parties  \n7.3.1  Under Basel III, the minority interest is recognised only in cases where there is \nconsiderable explicit or implicit assurance that the minority interest which is supporting the \nrisks of the subsidiary would be available to absorb the losses at the consolidated level.  \nAccordingly, the portion of minority interest which supports risks in a subsidiary that is a \nbank will be included in group\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1. Consequently, minority interest in \nthe subsidiaries which are not banks will not be included in the r egulatory capital of the \ngroup. In other words, the proportion of surplus capital which is attributable to the minority \nshareholders would be excluded from the group\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Further, the \nminority interest in relation to other compon ents of regulatory capital will also be recognised.  \n                                            \n17 Please refer to Master Circular dated April 1, 2023  on \u201cPrudential norms on Income Recognition, \nAsset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances \u201d addressed to banks .  \n21  \n7.3.2  Treatment of Minority Interest Corresponding to Common Shares Issued by \nConsolidated Subsidiaries  \nMinority interest arising from the issue of common shares by a fully consolidated subsidiary \nof the AIFI may receive recognition in Common Equity Tier 1 capital only if: ( a) the \ninstrument giving rise to the minority interest would, if issued by the AIFI, meet s all of the \ncriteria for classification as common shares for regulatory capital purposes as stipula ted in \nAnnex 1 ; and ( b) the subsidiary that issued the instrument is itself a bank18. The amount of \nminority interest meeting the criteria above that will be recognised in consolidated Common \nEquity Tier 1  capital will be calculated as follows:  \n(i) Total minority interest meeting the two criteria above minus the amount of the surplus \nCommon Equity Tier  1 capital of  the subsidiary attributable to the minority shareholders.  \n \n(ii) Surplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital o f the subsidiary is calculated as the Common \nEquity Tier 1 of the subsidiary minus the lower of: ( a) the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital requirement of the subsidiary plus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. , 8.0% of risk \nweighted assets) and ( b) the portion of the consolidated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital requirement plus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. , 8.0% of consolidated risk \nweighted assets) that relates to the subsidiary.  \n \n(iii) The amount of the surplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital t hat is attributable to the \nminority shareholders is calculated by multiplying the surplus Common Equity Tier 1 by the \npercentage of Common Equity Tier 1 that is held by minority shareholders.  \n \n7.3.3  Treatment of Minority Interest Corresponding to Tier 1  Qualify ing Capital \nIssued by Consolidated Subsidiaries  \nTier 1 capital instruments issued by a fully consolidated subsidiary of the AIFI to third party \ninvestors (including amounts under section  7.3.2) may receive recognition in Tier 1 capital \nonly if the instrum ents would, if issued by the AIFI, meet all of the criteria for classification as \nTier 1 capital. The amount of this capital that will be recognised in Tier 1 capital will be \ncalculated as follows :  \n(i) Total Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary issued to third pa rties minus the amount of the \nsurplus Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary attributable to the third party investors.  \n \n(ii) Surplus Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary is calculated as the Tier 1 capital of the \nsubsidiary minus the lower of: ( a) the minimum Tier 1 ca pital requirement of the subsidiary \nplus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. , 9.5% of risk weighted assets) and ( b) the portion of \nthe consolidated minimum Tier 1 capital requirement plus the capital conservation buffer \n(i.e., 9.5% of consolidated risk w eighted assets) that relates to the subsidiary.  \n(iii) The amount of the surplus Tier 1 capital that is attributable to the third party investors \nis calculated by multiplying the surplus Tier 1 capital by the percentage of Tier 1 capital that \nis held by third par ty investors.  \n \nThe amount of this Tier 1 capital that will be recognised in Additional Tier 1 capital will \nexclude amounts recognised in Common Equity Tier 1 capital under section  7.3.2. \n7.3.4  Treatment of Minority Interest Corresponding to Tier 1 and Tier 2  Qualifying \nCapital Issued by Consolidated Subsidiaries  \n                                            \n18 For the purposes of this section , All India Financial In stitutions, Non -banking Financial Companies \nregulated by the Reserve Bank  and Primary Dealers will be considered to be a bank.    \n22 Total capital instruments (i.e. , Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) issued by a fully \nconsolidated subsidiary of the AIFI to third party investors (including amounts under section s \n7.3.2 and 7.3.3) may receive recognition in Total Capital only if the instruments would, if \nissued by the AIFI, meet all of the criteria for classification as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital. The \namount of this capital that will be recognised in consolidated Total Capital will be  calculated \nas follows:  \n(i) Total capital instruments of the subsidiary issued to third parties minus the amount of \nthe surplus Total Capital of the subsidiary attributable to the third party investors.  \n \n(ii) Surplus Total Capital of the subsidiary is calculated as the Total Capital of the \nsubsidiary minus the lower of: ( a) the minimum Total Capital requirement of the subsidiary \nplus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. , 11.5% of risk weighted assets ) and ( b) the portion \nof the consolidated minimum Total Capital requirement plus the capital conservation buffer \n(i.e., 11.5% of consolidated risk weighted assets) that relates to the subsidiary.  \n \n(iii) The amount of the surplus Total Capital that is attributable to the third party investors \nis calculated by multiplying the  surplus Total Capital by the percentage of Total Capital that \nis held by third party investors.  \n \nThe amount of this Total Capital that will be recognised in Tier 2 capital will exclude amounts \nrecognised in Common Equity Tier 1 capital under section  7.3.2 and amounts recognised in \nTier 1  capital  under section  7.3.3.  \n \n7.3.5  An illustration of calculation of minority interest and other ca pital issued out of \nconsolidated subsidiaries that is held by third parties  is furnished i n Annex 15. \n \n7.4 Regulatory Adjustments / Deductions  \nThe following section s deal with the regulatory adjustments / deductions which will be \napplied to regulatory capital both  at solo and consolidated level.  \n7.4.1  Goodwill  and all Other Intangible Assets  \n(i) Goodwill and all ot her intangible assets should be deducted from Common Equity \nTier 1 capital including any goodwill included in the valuation of significant investments in the \ncapital of other  financial and insurance entities which are outside the scope of regulatory \nconsol idation. In terms of AS 23 \u2013 Accounting for investments in associates, goodwill/capital \nreserve arising on the acquisition of an associate by an investor should be included in the \ncarrying amount of investment in the associate but should be disclosed separ ately. \nTherefore, if the acquisition of equity interest in any associate involves payment which can \nbe attributable to goodwill, this should be deducted from the Common Equity Tier 1 of the \nAIFI. \n  \n(ii) The full amount of the intangible assets is to be deducted  net of any associated \ndeferred tax liabilities which would be extinguished if the intangible assets become impaired \nor derecognized under the relevant accounting standards. For this purpose, the definition of \nintangible assets would be in accordance with the Indian accounting standards. Losses in \nthe current period and those brought forward from previous periods should also be deducted \nfrom Common Equity Tier 1 capital , if not already deducted . \n \n(iii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean d eduction of any goodwill \nand other intangible assets from the consolidated Common Equity which is attributed to the \nsubsidiaries, in addition to deduction of goodwill and other intangible assets which pertain to \nthe solo AIFI.  \n23  \n7.4.2  Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs)19 \n(i) Deferred tax assets (DTAs) associated with accumulated losses and other such \nassets sh all be deducted in full from CET1 capital.  \n(ii) DTAs which relate to timing differences (other than those related to accumulated \nlosses) may, instead of full deduction from CE T1 capital, be recognised in the CET1 capital \nup to 10% of a n AIFI\u2019s CET1 capital, at the discretion of AIFIs [after the application of all \nregulatory adjustments mentioned from section  7.4 and 7.5 of this Chapter].  \n(iii) Further, the limited recognition of DTAs  as at (ii) above along with limited recognition \nof significant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial (i.e. , financial \nand insurance) entities in terms of section  7.5.2 (C) (iii) of this Chapter  taken together shall \nnot exceed 15% of  the CET1 capital, calculated after all regulatory adjustments set out in \nsections 7.4 and 7.5 of this Chapter . However, AIFIs shall ensure that the CET1 capital \narrived at after application of 15% limit should in no case result in recognising any item mor e \nthan the 10% limit applicable individually.  \nNote:  The recognition of these specified items shall be limited to 15% of Common Equity \nTier 1 (CET1) capital, after the application of all deductions. To determine the maximum \namount of the specified items tha t can be recognised  (actual amount may be lower than \n15%) , AIFIs shall multiply the amount of CET1 (after all deductions, including after the \ndeduction of the specified items in full i.e., specified items sh all be fully deducted from CET1 \nalong with other deductions first for arriving at CET1) by 17.65%. This number i.e., 17.65% is \nderived from the proportion of 15% to 85% (15%/85% = 17.65%)20. \n(iv) The amount of DTAs which is to be deducted from CET1 capital may be netted with \nassociated deferred tax liabilities  (DTLs) provided that:  \n(a) both the DTAs and DTLs relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority \nand offsetting is permitted by the relevant taxation authority;  \n(b) the DTLs permitted to be netted against DTAs shall exclude amounts that \nhave been netted aga inst the deduction of goodwill, intangibles and defined benefit \npension assets; and  \n(c) the DTLs shall be allocated on a pro rata basis between DTAs subject to \ndeduction from CET1 capital as at (i) and (ii) above.  \n \n(v) The amount of DTAs which is not deducted from  CET1 capital (in terms of clause  (ii) \nabove) will be risk weighted at 250% as in the case of significant investments in common \nshares not deducted from AIFI\u2019s CET1 capital as indicated in section 7.5.2(C)(iii) of th is \nChapter .  \n \n(vi) Where the DTL is in excess  of the DTA (excluding DTA associated with accumulated \nlosses), the excess shall nei ther be adjusted against item (i ) nor added to Common Equity \nTier 1 capital.   \n                                            \n19 Please refer to circular DBR.No.BP.BC.83/2 1.06.201/2015 -16 dated March 1, 2016  on \u201cMaster \nCircular \u2013 Basel III Capital Regulations \u2013 Revision \u201d addressed to banks  \n20 For example, take an AIFI with \u20b985 of common equity (calculated net of all deductions, including \nafter the deduction of the specified items in full). The maximum amount of specified items that can be \nrecognised by this AIFI in its calculation of CET1 capit al is \u20b985 x 17.65% = \u20b915. Any excess above \n\u20b915 must be deducted from CET1. If the AIFI has specified items (excluding amounts deducted after \napplying the individual 10% limits) that in aggregate sum up to the 15% limit, CET1 after inclusion of \nthe specifie d items, will amount to \u20b985 + \u20b915 = \u20b9100. The percentage of specified items to total CET1 \nwould equal 15%.   \n24  \n(vii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of DTAs from \nthe consol idated Common Equity which is attributed to the subsidiaries, in addition to \ndeduction of DTAs which pertain to the solo AIFI. \n \n7.4.3  Cash Flow Hedge Reserve  \n(i) The amount of the cash flow hedge reserve which relates to the hedging of items that \nare not fair valued  on the balance sheet (including projected cash flows) should be \nderecognised in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. This means that positive amounts \nshould be deducted and negative amounts should be added back. This treatment specifically \nidentifies the element of the cash flow hedge reserve that is to be derecognised for \nprudential purposes. It removes the element that gives rise to artificial volatility in Common \nEquity, as in this case the reserve only reflects one half of the picture (the fair val ue of the \nderivative, but not the changes in fair value of the hedged future cash flow).  \n \n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean derecognition of cash \nflow hedge reserve from the consolidated Common Equity which is attributed to the \nsubsidiaries, in addition to derecognition of cash flow hedge reserve pertaining to the solo \nAIFI. \n7.4.4  Gain -on-Sale Related to Securitisation Transactions  \n(i) AIFIs shall be guided by the Master Direction no. DOR.STR.REC.53/21.04.177/2021 -\n22 dated September 24, 2021  titled Reserve Bank of India (Securitisation of Standard \nAssets) Directions, 2021 in this regard.  \n \n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of gain-on-sale \nfrom the consolidated Common Equity which is recognized by the subsidiaries in their P&L \nand / or equity, in addition to deduction of any gain -on-sale recognised by the AIFI at the \nsolo level.  \n \n7.4.5  Cumulative Gains and Losses due to Changes in Own  Credit Risk on Fair \nValued Financial Liabilities  \n(i) AIFIs  are required to derecognise in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, \nall unrealised gains and losses which have resulted from changes in the fair value of \nliabilities that are due to chang es in the AIFI\u2019s  own credit risk. In addition, with regard to \nderivative liabilities, derecognise all accounting valuation adjustments arising from the AIFI\u2019s  \nown credit risk. The offsetting between valuation adjustments arising from the AIFI\u2019s  own \ncredit risk and those arising from its counterparties' credit risk is not allowed.  If an AIFI \nvalues its derivatives and securities financing transactions (SFTs) liabilities taking into \naccount its own creditworthiness in the form of debit valuation adjustments ( DVAs), then the \nAIFI is required to deduct all DVAs from its Common Equity Tier 1 capital, irrespective of \nwhether the DVAs arises due to changes in its own credit risk or other market factors. Thus, \nsuch deduction also includes the deduction of initial DV A at inception of a new trade. In other \nwords, though a n AIFI will have to recognize a loss reflecting the credit risk of the \ncounterparty (i.e. , credit valuation adjustments -CVA), the AIFI will not be allowed to \nrecognize the corresponding gain due to its  own credit risk.  \n  \n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean derecognition of \nunrealised gains and losses which have resulted from changes in the fair value of liabilities \nthat are due to changes in the subsidiaries\u2019 credit risk, in the  calculation of consolidated \nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital, in addition to derecognition of any such unrealised gains and \nlosses attributed to the AIFI at the solo level.   \n25  \n7.4.6  Defined Benefit Pension Fund21 Assets and Liabilities  \n(i) Defined benefit pension fund li abilities, as included on the balance sheet, shall be \nfully recognised in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital (i.e. , Common Equity Tier \n1 capital cannot be increased through derecognising these liabilities). For each defined \nbenefit pension fun d that is an asset on the balance sheet, the asset should be deducted in \nthe calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 net of any associated deferred tax liability which \nwould be extinguished if the asset should become impaired or derecognised under the \nrelevant  accounting standards.  \n \n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of defined \nbenefit pension fund assets and recognition of defined benefit pension fund liabilities \npertaining to subsidiaries in the consolidated Common Equity T ier 1, in addition to those \npertaining to the solo AIFI.  \n \n7.5 Investments  in the Capital of Banking,  Financial and Insurance Entities22 \n7.5.1  Limits on an AIFI\u2019s  Investments in t he Capital of Banking, Financial and \nInsurance Entities  \n(i) An AIFI\u2019s  investment in the capi tal instruments issued by banking, financial and \ninsurance entities is subject to the following limits:  \n(a) An AIFI\u2019s  investments in the capital instruments  issued by banking, financial \nand insurance entities should not exceed 10% of its capital funds , but af ter all \ndeductions mentioned in section 7.4.  \n(b) AIFIs  should not acquire any fresh stake in a bank's /AIFI\u2019s  equity shares, if by \nsuch acquisition, the investing AIFI\u2019s  holding exceeds 5% of the investee bank's / \nAIFI\u2019s equity capital.  \n(c) An AIFI\u2019s equity investm ent in a single company /non -financial/ commercial \nentity that is made in conformity with its statutory mandate shall not exceed 49 per \ncent of the equity of the investee company/entity. An AIFI can hold up to 49 per cent \nof equity of a company as a pledge e. However, if the AIFI ends up acquiring this in \nsatisfaction of its claims, it shall be brought down below 10 per cent limit within three \nyears.   \n(d) Equity investment by a n AIFI in a subsidiary company, financial services \ncompany, financial institution, sto ck and other exchanges should not exceed 10% of \nthe AIFI's paid-up share capital and reserves.  \n(e) Equity investment by a n AIFI in companies engaged in non -financial services \nactivities  (except as permitted in clause (c) above)  would be subject to a limit of 10% \nof the investee company\u2019s paid up share capital or 10% of the AIFI\u2019s  paid up share \ncapital and reserves, whichever is less.  \n(f) Equity investments in any non -financial services company held  by (a) an AIFI; \n(b) entities which are AIFI\u2019s  subsidiaries, assoc iates or joint ventures or entities \ndirectly or indirectly controlled by the  AIFI;  and (c) mutual funds managed by AMCs \ncontrolled by the AIFI should in the aggregate not exceed 20% of the investee \ncompany\u2019s paid up share capital.    \n(g) An AIFI\u2019s  equity inve stments in subsidiaries and other entities that are \nengaged in financial services activities together with equity investments in entities \n                                            \n21 It includes other defined employees\u2019 funds also.  \n22 These rules will be applicable to an AIFI\u2019s equity investments in banking, financial and insuran ce \nentities, even if such investments are exempted from \u2018capital market exposure\u2019 limit.    \n26 engaged in non -financial services activities should not exceed 20% of the AIFI\u2019s  paid-\nup share capital and reserves. T he cap of 20% would not apply for investments \nclassified under \u2018Held for Trading\u2019 category and which are not held beyond 90 days.  \n(ii) An indicative list of institutions which may be deemed to be financial institutions other \nthan banks and insurance companies for capital adequacy purposes is as under:  \n \n(a) Asset Management Companies of Mutual Funds / Alternative Investment \nFunds / Private Equity Funds etc;  \n(b) Non-Banking Finance Companies;  \n(c) Housing Finance Companies;  \n(d) Primary Dealers;  \n(e) Merchant Banking Companies;  \n(f) Entities engaged in activities which are ancillary to the business of banking as \ndefined under the B anking Regulation  Act, 1949 ; and \n(g) Central Counterparties (CCPs).  \n \n(iii) Investments made by a banking subsidiary/ associate in the equity or non -equity \nregulatory capit al instruments issued by its parent AIFI should be deducted from such \nsubsidiary's regulatory capital following corresponding deduction approach, in its capital \nadequacy assessment on a solo basis. The regulatory treatment of investment by the non -\nbanking financial subsidiaries / associates in the parent AIFI\u2019s  regulatory capital would, \nhowever, be governed by the applicable regulatory capital norms of the respective regulators \nof such subsidiaries / associates.  \n \n7.5.2  Treatment  of a n AIFI\u2019s  Investments in t he Ca pital Instruments Issued by \nBanking, Financial and Insurance Entities within Limits  \nThe investment of AIFIs  in the regulatory capital instruments of other financial entities \ncontributes to the inter-connectedness amongst the financial institutions. In addi tion, these \ninvestments also amount to double counting of capital in the financial system. Therefore, \nthese investments have been subjected to stringent treatment in terms of deduction from \nrespective tiers of regulatory capital. A schematic representation  of treatment of AIFIs\u2019  \ninvestments in capital instruments of financial entities is shown in Figure 1  below. \nAccordingly, all investments23 in the capital instruments issued by banking, financial and \ninsurance entities within the limits mentioned in section  7.5.1 will be subject to the following \nrules:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n23 For this purpose, investments held in AFS / HFT category may be reckoned at their market values, \nwhereas, those held in HTM category may be reckoned at values appe aring in the Balance sheet of \nthe AIFI. \n  \n27  \nFigure 1: Investments in t he Capital Instruments  of Banking, Financial and Insurance \nEntities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation  \n  \nIn the entities where the AIFI does not o wn \nmore than 10% of the common share \ncapital of individual entity   In the entities where the AIFI owns more than \n10% of the common share capital of individual \nentity  \n \n   \nAggregate of investments in capital \ninstruments of all such entities and compare \nwith 10% of AIFI\u2019s  own Common Equity  \n  EQUITY  \n(i)Equity investments in \ninsurance subsidiaries \nwill be fully deducted \nfrom AIFI\u2019s  Common \nEquity  \n(ii)Compare aggregated \nequity investments (i.e., \nexcluding equity \ninvestments in the \ninsurance subsidiaries) \nwith 10 % of AIFI\u2019s  \nCommon Equity  after \ndeduction at (i) above   NON -COMMON \nEQUITY  \nAll such \ninvestment will \nbe deducted \nfollowing \ncorresponding \ndeduction \napproach  \n   \nInvestments less \nthan 10% will be \nrisk weighted \naccording to \nbanking book \nand trading book \nrules   Investments \nmore than 10% \nwill be \ndeducted  \nfollowing \ncorresponding \ndeduction \napproach   Investments \nless than \n10% will be \nrisk \nweighted at \n250%   More than \n10% will be \ndeducted \nfrom \nCommon \nEquity   \n(A) Reciprocal Cross - Holdings in the Capital of Banking, F inancial and Insurance \nEntities  \nReciprocal cross holdings of capital might result in artificially inflating the capital position of \nAIFIs . Such holdings of capital will be fully deducted. AIFIs  shall apply a \u201ccorresponding \ndeduction approach\u201d to such inve stments in the capital of other banks, other financial \ninstitutions and insurance entities. This means the deduction should be applied to the same \ncomponent of capital (Common Equity, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) for which the \ncapital would qualif y if it was issued by the AIFI itself. For this purpose, a holding will be \ntreated as reciprocal cross holding if the investee entity has also invested in any class of \nAIFI\u2019s  capital instruments which need not necessarily be the same as the AIFI\u2019s  holdings . \n \n(B) Investments  in the Capital of Banking, Financial and  Insurance Entities which are \noutside the Scope of Regulatory  Consolidation  and where the AIFI does not Own \nmore than 10% of the Issued Common Share Capital of the Entity  \n(i) The regulatory adjustme nt described in this section applies to investments in the \ncapital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory  \n28 consolidation and where the AIFI does not own more than 10% of the issued common share \ncapital of the e ntity. In addition:  \n(a) Investments include direct, indirect24 and synthetic holdings of capital \ninstruments. For example, AIFIs  should look through holdings of index securities to \ndetermine their underlying holdings of capital.  \n(b) Holdings in both the banking b ook and trading book are to be included. \nCapital includes common stock ( paid-up equity capital)  and all other types of cash \nand synthetic capital instruments (e.g. , subordinated debt).  \n(c) Underwriting positions held for five working days or less can be exclu ded. \nUnderwriting positions held for longer than five working days shall be included.  \n(d) If the capital instrument of the entity in which the AIFI has invested does not \nmeet the criteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2 capital of the \nAIFI, the capital is to be considered common shares for the purposes of this \nregulatory adjustment25. \n(e) With the prior approval of the Reserve Bank  an AIFI can temporarily exclude \ncertain investments where these have been made in the context of resolving or \nproviding financial assistance to reorganise a distressed institution.  \n(ii) If the total of all holdings listed in clause  (i) above, in aggregate exceed 10% of the \nAIFI\u2019s  Common Equity (after applying all other regulatory adjustments in full listed prior to \nthis one), then the amount above 10% is required to be deducted, applying a corresponding \ndeduction approach. This means the deduction should be applied to the same component of \ncapital for which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the AIFI itself. A ccordingly, the \namount to be deducted from common equity should be calculated as the total of all holdings \nwhich in aggregate exceed 10% of the AIFI\u2019s  common equity (as per above) multiplied by \nthe common equity holdings as a percentage  of the total capita l holdings. This would result \nin a Common Equity deduction which corresponds to the proportion of total capital holdings \nheld in Common Equity. Similarly, the amount to be deducted from Additional Tier 1 capital \nshould be calculated as the total of all hol dings which in aggregate exceed 10% of the AIFI\u2019s  \nCommon Equity (as per above) multiplied by the Additional Tier 1 capital holdings as a \npercentage  of the total capital holdings. The amount to be deducted from Tier 2 capital \nshould be calculated as the tot al of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10% of the AIFI\u2019s  \nCommon Equity (as per above) multiplied by the Tier 2 capital holdings as a percentage  of \nthe total capital holdings. (Please refer to illustration given in Anne x 10). \n \n(iii) If, under the corresponding deduction approach, a n AIFI is required to make a \ndeduction from a particular tier of capital and it does not have enough of that tier of capital to \nsatisfy that deduction , the shortfall will be deducted from the next highe r tier of capital (e.g. , if \nan AIFI does not have enough Additional Tier 1 capital to satisfy the deduction, the shortfall \nwill be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital).  \n  \n(iv) Investments below the threshold of 10% of AIFI\u2019s  Common Equity, which are not \ndeducted, will be risk weighted. Thus, instruments in the trading book will be treated as per \nthe market risk rules and instruments in the banking book should be treated as per the \nstandardised approach or internal ratings -based approach (as applicable). F or the \napplication of risk weighting the amount of the holdings which are required to be risk \nweighted would be allocated on a pro rata basis between the Banking and Trading Book.  \n                                            \n24 Indirect holdings are exposures or part of exposures that, if a direct holding loses its value, will \nresult in a loss to the AIFI substantially equivalent to the loss in the value of direct holding.  \n25 If the inves tment is issued out of a regulated financial entity and not included in regulatory capital in \nthe relevant sector of the financial entity, it is not required to be deducted.    \n29 However, in certain cases, such investments in both scheduled and non -schedu led \ncommercial banks will be fully deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital of investing AIFI \nas indicated in section s 8.6, 11.3.5 and 11.4.4. \n \n(v) For the purpose of risk weighting of investments in as indicated in clause  (iv) above, \ninvestments in securiti es having comparatively higher risk weights will be considered for risk \nweighting to the extent required to be risk weighted, both in banking and trading books. In \nother words, investments with comparatively poor ratings (i.e. , higher risk weights) should be \nconsidered for the purpose of application of risk weighting first and the residual investments \nshould be considered for deduction.  \n  \n(C) Significant I nvestments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and  Insurance Entities  \nwhich are outside  the Scope of R egulatory Consolidation26 \n(i) The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the \ncapital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory \nconsolidation where the AIFI owns more than 10% of the issued common share capital of \nthe issuing entity or where the entity is an affiliate27 of the AIFI. In addition:   \n(a) Investments include direct, indirect28 and synthetic holdings of capital \ninstruments. For example, AIFI should look through holdings of index securities to \ndetermine their underlying holdings of capital.  \n \n(b) Holdings in both the banking book and trading book are to be included. \nCapital includes common stock and all other types of cash and synthetic capital \ninstruments (e.g. subordinated debt).  \n \n(c) Underwriting positions held for five working days or less can be excluded. \nUnderwriting positions held for longer than five working days shall be included.  \n \n(d) If the capital instrument of the entity in which the AIFI has invested does not \nmeet the criteria f or Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2 capital of the \nbank, the capital is to be considered common shares for the purposes of this \nregulatory adjustment29. \n \n(e) With the prior approval of the Reserve Bank  an AIFI  can temporarily exclude \ncertain i nvestments where these have been made in the context of resolving or \nproviding financial assistance to reorganise a distressed institution.  \n \n(ii) Investments other than Common Shares  \nAll investments included in clause  (i) above which are not common shares shall be fully \ndeducted following a \u2018corresponding deduction \u2019 approach. This means the deduction should \n                                            \n26 Investments in entities that are outside of the scope of regulatory consolidat ion refers to \ninvestments in entities that have not been consolidated at all or have not been consolidated in such a \nway as to result in their assets being included in the calculation of consolidated risk -weighted assets \nof the group.  \n27 An affiliate of a n AIFI is defined as a company that controls, or is controlled by, or is under common \ncontrol with, the AIFI. Control of a company is defined as (1) ownership, control, or holding with power \nto vote 20% or more of a class of voting securities of the company ; or (2) consolidation of the \ncompany for financial reporting purposes.  \n28 Indirect holdings are exposures or part of exposures that, if a direct holding loses its value, will \nresult in a loss to the AIFI substantially equivalent to the loss in the value of  direct holding.  \n29 If the investment is issued out of a regulated financial entity and not included in regulatory capital in \nthe relevant sector of the financial entity, it is not required to be deducted.    \n30 be applied to the same tier of capital for which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the \nAIFI itself. If the AIFI is required to make a deduction from a particular tier of capital and it \ndoes not have enough of that tier of capital to satisfy that deduction, the shortfall will be \ndeducted from the next higher tier of capital (e.g. , if an AIFI does not have enough Additional \nTier 1 capital to satisfy  the deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from Common Equity \nTier 1 capital).  \n \n(iii) Investments  which are Common Shares  \nAll investments included in clause  (i) above which are common shares and which exceed \n10% of the AIFI\u2019s Common Equity (after the applic ation of all regulatory adjustments) will be \ndeducted while calculating Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The amount that is not deducted \n(upto 10% if AIFI\u2019s common equity invested in the equity capital of such entities)  in the \ncalculation of Common Equity Tie r 1 will be risk weighted at 250% (refer to illustration in  \nAnnex 1 0). However, in certain ca ses, such investments in both scheduled and non -\nscheduled commercial banks will be fully deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital of  \ninvesting AIFI as indicated in section s 8.6, 11.3.5 and 11.4.4. \n7.5.3  With regard to computation of indirect holdings through mutual funds or index funds, \nof capital of banking, financial and insurance entities which are outside the scope of \nregulatory consolid ation as mentioned in sections  7.5.2(B) and 7.5.2(C) above, the following \nrules may be observed:  \n(i) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds / index funds / alternative \ninvestment funds  / private equity funds / investment companies in the capital  instruments of \nthe financial entities is known ; the indirect investment of the AIFI in such entities would be \nequal to AIFI\u2019s investments in these entities multiplied by the percent of investments of such \nentities in the financial entities\u2019 capital instru ments.   \n \n(ii) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds / index funds / alternative \ninvestment funds / private equity funds / investment companies in the capital instruments of \nthe  financial entities  is not known but, as per the investment policie s / mandate of these \nentities such investments are permissible; the indirect investment would be equal to AIFI\u2019s \ninvestments in these entities multiplied by maximum permissible limit which these entities \nare authorized to invest in the financial entities\u2019 capital instruments.  \n \n(iii) If neither the amount of investments made by the mutual funds / index funds / \nalternative investment funds  / private equity funds in the capital instruments of financial \nentities nor the maximum amount which these entities can invest  in financial entities are \nknown but, as per the investment policies / mandate of these entities such investments are \npermissible; the entire investment of the AIFI in these entities would be treated as indirect \ninvestment in financial entities. AIFIs shall note that this method does not follow \ncorresponding deduction approach i.e. , all deductions will be made from the Common Equity \nTier 1 capital even though, the investments of such entities are in the Additional Tier 1 / Tier \n2 capital of the investing AIFI. \n \n7.5.4  Application  of these rule s at consolidated level would mean:  \n(i) Identifying the relevant entities below and above threshold of 10% of common share \ncapital of investee entities, based on aggregate investments of the consolidated group \n(parent plus consoli dated subsidiaries) in common share capital of individual investee \nentities.  \n \n \n  \n31 (ii) Applying the rules as stipulated in section  7.5.2 and segregating investments into \nthose which will be deducted from the consolidated capital and those which will be risk \nweigh ted. For this purpose,  \n(a) investments of the entire consolidated entity in capital instruments of investee \nentities will be aggregated  into different classes of instruments .  \n \n(b) the consolidated Common Equity of the group will be taken into account.  \n \n7.5.5  When  returns of the investors of the capital issues are counter guaranteed by the \nAIFI, such investments will not be considered as regulatory capital for the purpose of capital \nadequacy.  \n7.5.6  As indicated in section s 6.2.2 and 6.3.1, equity investments in non -financial \nsubsidiaries should be fully deducted from the consolidated and solo CET1 capital of the \nAIFI respectively, after making all the regulatory adjustments as indicated in above sections .   \n7.5.7  Intra  Group Transactions  and Exposures  \nAttention is invited to circula r DBOD.No.BP.BC.96/21.06.102/ 2013 -14 dated February 11, \n2014  on \u201cGuidelines on Management of Intra -Group Transactions and Exposures\u201d in terms \nof which intra -group exposures beyond permissible limits subsequent to March 31, 2016, if \nany, would be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital of the bank. The same \ninstructions shall apply to the AIFIs.  \n \n7.6 Transitional arrangements for AIFIs  \nCapital instruments already issued by the AIFIs which no longer qualify under Basel III  will \nbe allowed to be counted as Tie r 1 or Tier 2, as the case may be, as per the existing rules \nuntil their maturity or the first call date , whichever is earlier . All capital instruments issued by \nAIFIs after these Directions  come  into effect  shall comply  with the requirements set out in \nthese Directions .  \n \n8. Capital Charge for Credit Risk  \n8.1  General  \nUnder the Standardised Approach, the rating assigned by the eligible external credit rating \nagencies will largely support the measure of credit risk. The Reserve Bank has identified the \nexternal cre dit rating agencies that meet the eligibility criteria specified under the revised \nFramework. AIFIs  may rely upon the ratings assigned by the external credit rating agencies \nchosen by the Reserve Bank for assigning risk weights for capital adequacy purpose s as per \nthe mapping furnished in these guidelines.  \n \n8.2 Claims on Domestic Sovereigns  \n8.2.1  Both fund based and non -fund based claims on the central government will attract a \nzero per cent  risk weight. Central Government guaranteed claims will attract a zero  per c ent \nrisk weight.  \n \n8.2.2  The Direct loan / credit / overdraft exposure, if any, of AIFIs  to the State \nGovernments and the investment in State Government securities will attract zero risk weight. \nState Government guaranteed claims will attract 20 per cent risk wei ght. \n \n8.2.3  The risk weight applicable to claims on central government exposures shall also \napply to the claims on the Reserve Bank  and DICGC . The risk weight of zero per  cent shall  \n32 be applicable in respect of exposures guaranteed under any existing30 or future31 schemes \nlaunched by Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE), \nCredit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH)32 and National \nCredit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd. (NCGTC) satisfying the following conditions:  \n(i) Prudential Aspects:  The guarantees provided under the respective schemes \nshould comply with the requirements for credit risk mitigation in terms of section  10.5 of this \nChapter  which inter alia requires such guarantees to be direct, explicit, irrevocable and  \nunconditional;  \n(ii) Restrictions on permissible claims:  Where the terms of the guarantee schemes \nrestrict the maximum permissible claims through features like specified extent of guarantee \ncoverage, clause on first loss absorption by member lending institution s (MLI), payout cap, \netc., the zero per  cent risk weight shall be restricted to the maximum permissible claim and \nthe residual exposure shall be subjected to risk weight as applicable to the counterparty in \nterms of extant regulations.  \n(iii) In case of a portfol io-level guarantee, the extent of exposure subjected to first loss \nabsorption by the MLI, if any, shall be subjected to full capital deduction and the residual \nexposure shall be subjected to risk weight as applicable to the counterparty in terms of \nextant regulations, on a pro rata basis. The maximum capital charge shall be capped at a \nnotional level arrived at by treating the entire exposure as unguaranteed.  \nThe claims on ECGC shall attract a risk weight of 20 per cent.  \n \n8.2.4  The above risk weights for both dir ect claims and guarantee claims will be applicable \nas long as they are classified as \u2018standard\u2019  / performing assets. Where these sovereign \nexposures are classified as non -performing, they would attract risk weights as applicable to \nNPAs, which are detailed  in section  8.12. \n \n8.2.5  The above risk weights will be applied if such exposures are denominated in Indian \nRupees and also funded in Indian Rupees33. \n \n8.3 Claims on Foreign Sovereigns and Foreign Central Banks  \n8.3.1  Subject to section  8.3.2 below, claims on foreign sovereigns and their central banks \nwill attract risk weig hts as per the rating assigned34 to them by international rating agencies \nas follows:  \n \n \n                                            \n30 For illustrative examples of risk weights appli cable on claims guaranteed under specific existing \nschemes , AIFIs may refer Annex given in circular DOR.STR.REC.67/21.06.201/2022 -23 dated \nSeptember 7, 2022  on \u201cRevie w of Prudential Norms \u2013 Risk Weights for Exposures guaranteed by \nCredit Guarantee Schemes (CGS)\u201d  \n31 Any future scheme launched under any of the mentioned Trust Funds, in order to be eligible for \nzero percent risk weight, shall provide for settlement of the eligible guaranteed claims within thirty \ndays from the date of lodgement, and the lodgement shall be permitted within sixty days from the date \nof default.  \n32 Please refer to the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.90/21.04.048/2012 -13 dated April 16, 2013  on \nAdvances Guaranteed by \u2018Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH) - \nRisk Weights and Provisioning\u2019.  \n33 The Lines of Credit (LOCs) extended by EXIM Bank at the  behest of Central Government and \nsecured by guarantee of the Central Government shall attract zero per cent risk weight.  \n34 For example: The risk weight assigned to an investment in US Treasury Bills by an AIFI\u2019s branch  in \nParis, irrespective of the curren cy of funding, will be determined by the rating assigned to the \nTreasury Bills, as indicated in Table 2.  \n33 Table 2: Claims on Foreign Sovereigns /Central Banks  \u2013 Risk Weights  \nS&P*/ Fitch r ating s  AAA to AA  A BBB  BB to B  Below B  Unrated  \nMoody\u2019s ratings  Aaa to Aa  A Baa Ba to B  Below B  Unrated  \nRisk weight  (%) 0  20   50  100  150  100  \n    * Standard & Poor\u2019s  \n \n8.3.2  Claims  on the foreign sovereign s or foreign cent ral bank s in their jurisdiction,  \ndenom inated in domestic currency of that jurisdiction35, met out of the resources of the same \ncurrency  will attract a risk weight of zero per  cent.  However, in case a Host Supervisor \nrequires a more conservative treatment to such claims in the books of the forei gn branches \nof the AIFIs , they should adopt the requirements prescribed by the Host Country Supervisors \nfor computing capital adequacy.  \n \n8.4  Claims on Public Sector Entities (PSEs)  \n8.4.1  Claims on domestic public sector entities will be risk weighted in a manner si milar to \nclaims on Corporates.   \n \n8.4.2  Claims on foreign PSEs will be risk weighted as per the rating assigned by the \ninternational rating agencies as under:  \nTable 3: Claims on Foreign PSEs \u2013 Risk Weights  \nS&P/ Fitch ratings  AAA  to AA  A BBB to  BB Below BB  Unrated  \nMoody\u2019s ratings  Aaa to Aa  A Baa to Ba  Below Ba  Unrated  \nRW (%)  20 50 100 150 100 \n \n8.5 Claims on MDBs, BIS and IMF  \n8.5.1  Claims on the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary \nFund (IMF) and the following eligible Multilateral Developm ent Banks (MDBs) evaluated by \nthe B asel Committee on Banking Supervision (B CBS) will be treated similar to claims on \nscheduled  commercial  banks meeting the minimum capital adequacy requirements and \nassigned a uniform twenty per  cent risk weight:  \n(a) World Bank  Group: IBRD and IFC,  \n(b) Asian Development Bank,  \n(c) African Development Bank,  \n(d) European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,  \n(e) Inter-American Development Bank,  \n(f) European Investment Bank,  \n(g) European Investment Fund,  \n(h) Nordic Investment Bank,  \n(i) Caribbean Developm ent Bank,  \n(j) Islamic Development Bank ,   \n(k) Council of Europe Development Bank , \n(l) International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm)  and \n(m) Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)  \n \n8.6 Claims on Banks (Exposure to capital instruments ) \n8.6.1  In case  of an AIFI\u2019s  inves tment in capital instruments of banks, the following such \ninvestments would not be deducted, but would attract appropriate risk weights  (refer to the \nsection  7.5 above : \n                                            \n35 For example: The risk weight assigned to an investment in US Treasury Bills by an AIFI\u2019s branch in \nNew York will attract a zero per cent risk weight,  irrespective of the rating of the claim, if the \ninvestment is funded from out of the USD denominated resources of the AIFI\u2019s branch in New York. In \ncase the AIFI\u2019s branch in New York, did not have any USD denominated resources, the risk weight \nwill be det ermined by the rating assigned to the Treasury Bills as indicated in Table 2 above.   \n34 (i) Investments in capital instruments  of banks where the investing AIFI holds not \nmore tha n 10% of the issued common shares of the investee banks, subject to the following \nconditions:  \n(a) Aggregate of these investments, together with investments in the capital \ninstruments in insurance and other financial entities, do not exceed 10% of Common \nEquity  of the investing AIFI;

However, this Table above will become applicable to them, if in future they \nissue any capital instruments where other banks / AIFIs  are eligible to invest.     \n \n8.6.3  The claims on foreign banks will be risk weighted as under as per the ratings \nassigned by international rating agencies.  \nTable 5: Claims on Foreign Banks \u2013 Risk Weights  \nS &P / Fitch ratings  AAA to AA  A BBB  BB to B  Below B  Unrated  \nMoody\u2019s  ratings  Aaa to Aa  A Baa Ba to B  Below B  Unrated  \nRisk weight  (%) 20  50  50 100 150 50  \nIf the AIFI reckons the exposure on the original counterparty, it shall attract the risk weight as \nper Table 5, if the counterparty is a person resident in India, or 150%38 if the counterparty is \na person resident outside India.  \n8.6.4  However, the claims on a bank which are denominated in 'domestic39' foreign \ncurrency met out of the resources in the same currency raised in that jurisdiction will be risk \nweighted at 20 per cent  provided the bank complies with the minimum CRAR prescribed by \nthe concerned bank regulator(s).  \n \n8.6.5  However, in case a Host Supervisor requires a more conservative treatment for such \nclaims in the books of the foreign branches of the AIFIs , they should adop t the requirements \nprescribed by the Host Supervisor for computing capital adequacy.  \n \n8.7 Claims on Primary Dealers  \nClaims on Primary Dealers shall be risk weighted in a manner similar to claims on \ncorporates.  \n \n8.8 Claims on Corporates  and NBFCs  \n8.8.1  Claims on corporat es40 and exposures to all NBFCs41 (excluding Core Investment \n                                            \n38 Please refer to Chapter  III of these Directions  \n39 For example: A Euro denominated claim on BNP Paribas, Paris which is funded from out of the \nEuro denominated deposit s of the AIFI in  Paris will attract a 20 per cent risk weight irrespective of the \nrating of the claim, provided BNP Paribas complies with the minimum CRAR stipulated by its \nregulator/supervisor in France.

Claims included in this portfolio shall be \nassigned a risk -weight of 75 per cent, except as provided in section  8.12 below for non-\nperforming  assets.   \n \n8.9.2  The following claims, both fund based and non -fund based, shall be excluded from \nthe regulatory retail portfolio:  \n(i) Exposures by way of investments in securities (such as bonds and equities), whether \nlisted or not;  \n(ii) Mortgage Loans to the extent that they qualify for treatment as claims secured by \nresidential property42 or claims sec ured by commercial real estate43;  \n(iii) Loans and Advances to AIFI\u2019s  own staff which are fully covered by superannuation \nbenefits and / or mortgage of flat/ house;  \n(iv) Consumer Credit, including Personal Loans and credit card receivables;  \n(v) Capital Market Exposures;  \n(vi) Alternative Investment Funds . \n8.9.3  Qualifying Criteria  \n(i) Orientation Criterion  - The exposure (both fund -based and non fund -based) is to an \nindividual person or persons or to a small business; Person under this clause would mean \nany legal person capable of enterin g into contracts and would include but not be restricted to \nindividual  and HUF; small business would include  partnership firm, trust, private limited \ncompanies, public limited companies, co -operative societies etc. Small business is one \nwhere the total ave rage annual turnover is less than \u20b950 crore. The turnover criterion will be \nlinked to the average of the last three years in the case of existing entities; projected \nturnover in the case of new entities; and both actual and projected turnover for entities  which \nare yet to complete three years.  \n                                            \n42  Mortgage loans qualifying for treatment as \u2018claims secured by residential property\u2019 are defined in \nsection 8 .10. \n43  As defined in section 8 .11.1.   \n39 (ii) Product Criterion  - The exposure (both fund -based and non-fund-based) takes the \nform of any of the following: revolving credits and lines of credit (including overdrafts), term \nloans and leases (e.g. , installment  loans and leases, student and educational loans) and \nsmall business facilities and commitments.   \n(iii) Granularity Criterion  - AIFIs shall ensure that the regulatory retail portfolio is \nsufficiently diversified to a degree that reduces the risks in the portfolio , warranting the 75 \nper cent risk weight. One way of achieving this is that no aggregate exposure to one \ncounterpart should exceed 0. 2 per cent of the overall regulatory retail portfolio. \u2018 Aggregate \nexposure \u2019 means gross amount (i.e. , not taking any benefi t for credit risk mitigation into \naccount) of all forms of debt exposures (e.g. loans or commitments) that individually satisfy \nthe three other criteria. In addition, \u2018 one counterpart \u2019 means one or several entities that may \nbe considered as a single benefi ciary (e.g. , in the case of a small business that is affiliated to \nanother small business, the limit would apply to the AIFI\u2019s  aggregated exposure on both \nbusinesses). While AIFIs  may appropriately use the group exposure concept for computing \naggregate exp osures, they should evolve adequate systems to ensure strict adherence with \nthis criterion. NPAs under retail loans are to be excluded from the overall regulatory retail \nportfolio when assessing the granularity criterion for risk -weighting purposes.  \n(iv) Low v alue of individual exposures  - The maximum aggregated retail exposure to \none counterpart should not exceed the absolute threshold limit of \u20b97.5 crore.  \n8.9.4  For the purpose of ascertaining compliance with the absolute threshold, exposure \nwould mean sanctioned limit or the actual outstanding, whichever is higher, for all fund \nbased and non -fund based facilities, including all forms of off -balance sheet exposures. In \nthe case of term loans and EMI based facilities, where there is no scope for redrawing any \nportio n of the sanctioned amounts, exposure shall mean the actual outstanding.  \n8.9.5  The Reserve Bank  would evaluate at periodic intervals the risk weight assigned to \nthe regulatory  retail portfolio with reference to the default experience for these exposures. As \npart of the supervisory review process, the Reserve Bank  would also consider whether the \ncredit quality of regulatory retail claims held by an AIFI should warrant a standard risk weight \nhigher than 75 per cent.  \n8.10 Claims secured by Residential Property  \n8.10.1  Lending  to individuals meant for acquiring residential property which are fully secured \nby mortgages on the residential property that is or will be occupied by the borrower, or that is \nrented, shall be risk weighted as indicated as per Table 7 B below, based on Bo ard approved \nvaluation policy. LTV ratio should be computed as a percentage with total outstanding in the \naccount (viz. \u201cprincipal + accrued interest + other charges pertaining to the loan\u201d without any \nnetting) in the numerator and the realisable value of the residential property mortgaged to \nthe AIFI in the denominator.   \nTable 7 B: Claims Secured by Residential Property \u2013 Risk Weights44 \nCategory of loan  LTV ratio (%)  Risk Weight(%)  \n(a) Individual Housing Loans    \n(i) Upto  \u20b9.30 lakh  < 80 35 \n> 80 and  < 90 50 \n(ii) Above  \u20b9. 30 lakh and upto  \u20b9.75 lakh  < 80 35 \n(iv) Above  \u20b9.75 lakh  < 75 50 \n                                            \n44 Please refer to the circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.104/08.12.0 15/2012 -13 dated June 21, 2013  on \nHousing Sector:  New sub -sector CRE (Residential Housing) within CRE & Rationalisation of \nprovisioning, risk -weight and LTV ratios , DBR.BP.BC.No.44/08.12.015/2015 -16 dated October 8, \n2015  and DBR.BP.BC.No.72/08.12.015/2016 -17 dated June 7, 2017  on Individual Housing Loans: \nRationalisation of Risk Weights and LTV Ratios addressed to banks.   \n40 (b) Commercial Real Estate \u2013 Residential \nHousing (CRE -RH)  N A 75 \n(c) Commercial Real Estate (CRE)  N A 100 \nNote s: \n1.

Hence, other \nforms of collateral like land, buildings, plant,  machinery, current assets, etc. , will not be \nreckoned while computing the secured portion of NPAs for capital adequacy purposes.  \n \n8.12.4  In addition to the above, where a NPA is fully secured by the following forms of \ncollateral that are not recognised for credi t risk mitigation purposes, either independently or \nalong with other eligible collateral a 100 per cent risk weight may apply, net of specific \nprovisions, when provisions reach 15 per cent of the outstanding amount:   \n(i) Land and building which are valued by an expert valuer and where the valuation is \nnot more than three years old, and  \n(ii) Plant and machinery in good working condition at a value not higher than the \ndepreciated value as reflected in the audited balance sheet of the borrower, which is not \nolder than  eighteen months.  \n \n8.12.5  The above collaterals (mentioned in section  8.12.4) will be recognized only where the \nAIFI is having clear title to realize the sale proceeds thereof and can appropriate the same \ntowards the amounts due to the AIFI. The AIFI\u2019s  title to t he collateral should be well \ndocumented. These forms of collaterals are not recognised anywhere else under the \nstandardised approach.  \n \n8.12.6  Claims secured by residential property, as defined in section  8.10.1, which are NPA \nwill be risk weighted at 100 per cent  net of specific provisions. If the specific provisions in \nsuch loans are at least 20 per cent but less than 50 per cent of the outstanding amount, the \nrisk weight applicable to the loan net of specific provisions will be 75 per cent. If the specific \nprovi sions are 50 per cent or more the applicable risk weight will be 50 per cent.   \n \n8.13 Specified  Categories  \n8.13.1  Fund based and non -fund based claims on Alternative Investment  Funds, which are \nconsidered as high risk exposures, will attract a higher risk weight of 15 0 per cent45. \n \n8.13.2  The Reserve Bank may, in due course, decide to apply a 150 per cent or higher risk \nweight reflecting the higher risks associated with any other claim that may be identified as a \nhigh risk exposure.  \n \n \n                                            \n45 SIDBI's investment limit in MSME -dedicated VCFs without the prior approval of the  Reserve  Bank \nshall be 20% subject to the proviso that SIDBI will maintain a capital charge of 175%. For specific risk \nwhere SIDBI's CME is between 20% and 30%, the capital charge will be at 200% and for CME above \n30% and upto 40% the capital charge on specific risk will be 225%.   \n42 8.13.3  Consumer  credit, including personal loans  will attract a risk weight of 100 per cent . \nAs gold and gold jewellery are eligible financial collateral, the counterparty exposure in \nrespect of personal loans secured by gold and gold jewellery will be worked out under the \ncomprehensive approach as per section  10.3.4. The \u2018exposure value after risk mitigation\u2019 \nshall attract the risk weight of 1 25 per cent.  \n \n8.13.4  Advances classified as \u2018Capital market exposures\u2019 will attract a 125 per cent risk \nweight or risk weight warranted by external rating (or lack of it) o f the counterparty, \nwhichever is higher. These  risk weights will also be applicable to all banking book \nexposures, which are exempted from capital market exposure ceilings for direct investments \n/ total capital market exposures46.  \n \n8.13.5  The exposure to capital instruments issued by NBFCs which are not deducted and \nare required to be risk weighted in terms of section  7.5.2(B) would be risk weighted at 125% \nor as per the external ratings, whichever is higher. The exposure to equity instruments \nissued by NBFCs whic h are not deducted and are required to be risk weighted in terms of \nsection  7.5.2(C) would be risk weighted at 250%.  \n \n8.13.6  All investments made by the AIFIs in the paid -up equity of non -financial entities \n(other than subsidiaries)  made under their statutory ma ndate  which exceed 49%47 of the \nissued common share capital of the issuing entity or where the entity is an unconsolidated \naffiliate as defined in section 7.5.2(C)(i) shall receive a risk weight of 1250%. Equity \ninvestments equal to or below 49%48 paid-up eq uity of such investee companies shall be \nassigned a 125% risk weight or the risk weight as warranted by rating or lack of it, whichever \nhigher.  \n \n8.13.7  The exposure to capital instruments issued by financial entities (other than banks and \nNBFCs) which are not ded ucted and are required to be risk weighted in terms of section \n7.5.2(B) would be risk weighted at 125% or as per the external ratings whichever is higher. \nThe exposure to equity instruments issued by financial entities (other than banks and \nNBFCs) which ar e not deducted and are required to be risk weighted in terms of section \n7.5.2(C) would be risk weighted at 250%.  \n8.13.8  AIFI\u2019s  investments in the non -equity capital eligible instruments of banks should be \nrisk weighted as prescribed in section  8.6.1. \n \n8.14 Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure49  \nIf the extent of unhedged foreign currency exposures of entities50  is significant , this can \nincrease the probability of default in times of high currency volatility. Therefore, the \nincremental capital requirements for AIFIs\u2019 exposures to entities with unhedged foreign \ncurrency exposures  (i.e., over and above the present capital requirements) shall be  as \nunder:  \n                                            \n46 The applicable risk weight f or banking book exposure / capital charge for market risk exposure for \nan AIFI\u2019s  equity investments in banks/financial institutions etc. , are covered under section 8  and 11 \nrespectively. These risk weights / capital charge will also apply to exposures whic h are exempt from \n\u2018capital market exposure\u2019 limit.  \n47 For investments not made under the AIFI\u2019s statutory mandate, this limit would be 10%.  \n48 Please refer to footnote 47 above  \n49 Please refer to the Reserve Bank of India (Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022 \nissued vide DOR.MRG.REC.76/00 -00-007/2022 -23 dated October 11, 2022 . \n50 In this context, \u2018entities\u2019 means those entities which have borrowed from AIFIs  including borrowing \nin INR and other currencies .  \n43  \n8.15 Other Assets  \n8.15.1  Loans and advances to AIFI\u2019s  own staff which are fully covered by superannuation \nbenefits and/or mortgage of flat/ house will attract a 20 per cent risk weight. Since flat / \nhouse is not an eligible collateral and since AIFIs  normally recover the dues by adjusting the \nsuperannuation benefits only at the time of cessation from service, the concessional risk \nweight shall be applied without any adjustment of the outstanding amount. In case a n AIFI is \nholding eligib le collateral in respect of amounts due from a staff member, the outstanding \namount in respect of that staff member may be adjusted to the extent permissible, as \nindicated in section  10 below.  \n \n8.15.2  Other loans and advances to AIFI\u2019s  own staff will be eligible for inclusion under \nregulatory retail portfolio and will therefore attract a 75 per cent risk weight.  \n \n8.15.3  All other assets will attract a uniform risk weight of 100 per cent.       \n \n8.16 Off-Balance Sheet Items  \n8.16.1  General  \n(i) The total risk weighted off -balance sheet cr edit exposure is calculated as the sum of \nthe risk -weighted amount of the market related and non -market related off -balance \nsheet items. The risk -weighted amount of an off -balance sheet item that gives rise to \ncredit exposure is generally calculated by mea ns of a two -step process:  \n(a) the notional amount of the transaction is converted into a credit equivalent \namount, by multiplying the amount by the specified credit conversion factor or by \napplying the current exposure method ; and \n \n(b) the resulting credit equival ent amount is multiplied by the risk weight \napplicable to the counterparty or to the purpose for which the AIFI has extended \nfinance or the type of asset, whichever is higher.  \n \n(ii) Where the off -balance sheet item is secured by eligible collateral or guarante e, the \ncredit risk mitigation guidelines detailed in section 10 may be applied.  \n \n8.16.2  Non-market -related Off Balance Sheet Items52 \n(i) The credit equivalent amount in relation to a non -market related off -balance sheet \nitem like, direct credit substitutes, trade and performance related contingent items \nand commitments with certain drawdown, other commitments, etc. , will be \ndetermined by multiplying the contracted amount of that particular transaction by the \nrelevant credit conversion factor (CCF).  \n \n                                            \n51 For example: for an entity which othe rwise attracts a risk weight of 50 per cent, the applicable risk \nweight would become 75 per cent.  \n52 The aggregate  capital required to be maintained by the AIFIs providing Partial Credit Enhancement \nwill be computed as provided in circular DBR.BP.BC.No.40/2 1.04.142/2015 -16 dated September 24, \n2015  addressed to banks , as amended from time to time.  Potential  Loss/EBID (%)  Incremental Capital Requirement  \nUp to 75 per cent  0 \nMore than 75 per cent  25 per cent age point51 increase in the risk weight   \n44 (ii) Where the non -marke t related off -balance sheet item is an undrawn or partially \nundrawn fund -based facility53, the amount of undrawn commitment to be included in \ncalculating the off -balance sheet non -market related credit exposures is the \nmaximum unused portion of the commitme nt that could be drawn during the \nremaining period to maturity. Any drawn portion of a commitment forms a part of \nAIFI\u2019s  on-balance sheet credit exposure.  \n(iii) In the case of irrevocable commitments to provide off -balance sheet facilities, the \noriginal maturi ty will be measured from the commencement of the commitment until \nthe time the associated facility expires. For example an irrevocable commitment with \nan original maturity of 12 months, to issue a 6 month documentary letter of credit, is \ndeemed to have an original maturity of 18 months. Irrevocable commitments to \nprovide off -balance sheet facilities should be assigned the lower of the two applicable \ncredit conversion factors. For example, an irrevocable commitment with an original \nmaturity of 15 months (50 per cent \u2013 CCF) to issue a six month documentary letter of \ncredit (20 per cent \u2013 CCF) would attract the lower of the CCF i.e., the CCF applicable \nto the documentary letter of credit , viz., 20 per cent.  \n(iv) The credit conversion factors for non -market related off-balance sheet transactions \nare as under:  \nTable 8: Credit Conversion Factors \u2013 Non-market related  Off-Balance Sheet Items  \nSr. \nNo. Instruments  Credit \nConversion \nFactor (%)  \n1. Direct credit substitutes e.g. , general guarantees of indebtedness (including \nstandby L/Cs serving as financial guarantees for loans and securities, credit \nenhancements, liquidity facilities for securitisation transactions), and \nacceptances (including endorsements with the character of acceptance).  \n(i.e., the risk of loss depends on  the credit worthiness of the counterparty or \nthe party against whom a potential claim is acquired)  100 \n2. Certain transaction -related contingent items (e.g. , performance bonds, bid \nbonds, warranties, indemnities and standby letters of credit related to \nparticular transaction).  50 \n3. Short -term self -liquidating trade letters of credit arising from the movement \nof goods (e.g. , documentary credits collateralised by the underlying \nshipment) for both issuing and confirming financial entity . 20 \n4. Sale and re purchase agreement and asset sales with recourse, where the \ncredit risk remains with the AIFI.  \n(These items are to be risk weighted according to the type of asset and not \naccording to the type of counterparty with whom the transaction has been \nentered int o.) 100 \n                                            \n53  For example: (a) In the case of a cash credit facility for Rs.100 lakh (which is not unconditionally \ncancellable) where the drawn portion is \u20b960 lakh, the undrawn portion of  \u20b940 lakh will attract a CCF of \n20 per cent (since the CC facility is subject to review / renewal normally once a year). The credit \nequivalent amount of \u20b98 lakh (20% of \u20b940 lakh) will be assigned the appropriate risk wei ght as \napplicable to the counterparty / rating to arrive at the risk weighted asset for the undrawn portion. The \ndrawn portion ( \u20b960 lakh) will attract a risk weight as applicable to the counterparty / rating.  \n(b) A TL of \u20b9700 cr is sanctioned for a larg e project which can be drawn down in stages over a three \nyear period. The terms of sanction allow draw down in three stages \u2013 \u20b9150 cr in Stage I, \u20b9200 cr in \nStage II and \u20b9350 cr in Stage III, where the borrower needs the AIFI\u2019s explicit approval for dra w down \nunder Stages II and III after completion of certain formalities. If the borrower has drawn already \u20b950 cr \nunder Stage I, then the undrawn portion would be computed with reference to Stage I alone i.e., it will \nbe \u20b9100 cr. If Stage I is scheduled t o be completed within one year, the CCF will be 20  per cent  and if \nit is more than one year then the applicable CCF will be 50 per cent.   \n45 Sr. \nNo. Instruments  Credit \nConversion \nFactor (%)  \n5. Forward asset purchases, forward deposits and partly paid shares and \nsecurities, which represent commitments with certain drawdown.   \n(These items are to be risk weighted according to the type of asset and not \naccording to the type of counterpar ty with whom the transaction has been \nentered into.)  100 \n6 Lending of securities or posting of securities as collateral by AIFIs , including \ninstances where these arise out of repo style transactions (i.e., repurchase / \nreverse repurchase and securities le nding / securities borrowing \ntransactions)  100 \n7.

If they are satisfied that the exposure is on the other bank they \nmay assign these exposures the risk weight applicable to banks as detailed in \nsection  8.6. \n(vi) Issue of Irrevocable Payment Commitment by AIFIs  to various Stock Exchanges on \nbehalf of Mutual Funds and FIIs is a financial guarantee with a Credit Conversion  \nFactor (CCF) of 100  per cent . However, capital will have to be maintained only on \nexposure which is reckoned as CME , i.e., 50% of the amount,  because the rest of the \nexposure is deemed to have been covered by cash/securities which are admissible \nrisk miti gants as per capital adequacy framework . Thus , capital is to be maintained \non the amount taken for CME and the risk weight would be 125% thereon.  \n(vii) For c lassification of AIFI\u2019s  guarantees55 viz. direct credit substitutes and transaction -\nrelated contingent ite ms etc. (Sr. No. 1 and 2 of Table 8 above) , the following \nprinciples should be kept in view for the application of CCFs:  \n                                            \n54 However, this will be subject to AIFIs  demonstrating that they are actually able to cancel any \nundrawn commitments in  case of deterioration in a borrower\u2019s credit worthiness failing which the \ncredit conversion factor applicable to such facilities which are not cancellable will apply. AIFIs\u2019  \ncompliance to these guidelines will be assessed under Annual Financial Inspection  / Supervisory \nReview and Evaluation Process under Pillar 2 of the Reserve Bank .  \n55 Please refer to the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.89 /21.04.009 /2012 -13 dated April 02, 2013  on \u2018New \nCapital Adequacy Framework - Non-market related Off Balanc e Sheet Items - Bank Guarantees\u2019 \naddressed to banks.   \n46 (a) Financial guarantees are direct credit substitutes wherein a n AIFI irrevocably \nundertakes to guarantee the repayment of a contractu al financial obligation. Financial \nguarantees essentially carry the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit i.e., \nthe risk of loss is directly linked to the creditworthiness of the counterparty against \nwhom a potential claim is acquired. An indica tive list of financial guarantees, \nattracting a C CF of 100 per cent is as under:  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees for credit facilities;  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees in lieu of repayment of financial securities;  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees in lieu of margin requirements of exchanges;  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees for mobilisation advance, advance money before the \ncommencement of a project and for money to be received in various stages of \nproject implementation;  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees towards revenue dues, taxes, duties, levies etc. , in favour of Tax/ \nCustoms / Port / Excise Authorities and for  disputed liabilities for litigation \npending at courts;  \n\uf0b7 Credit Enhancements;  \n\uf0b7 Liquidity facilities for securitisation transactions;  \n\uf0b7 Acceptances (including endorsements with the character of acceptance);  \n\uf0b7 Deferred payment guarantees.  \n \n \n(b) Performance guarant ees are essentially transaction -related contingencies that \ninvolve an irrevocable undertaking to pay a third party in the event the counterparty \nfails to fulfil or perform a contractual non -financial obligation. In such transactions, the \nrisk of loss depen ds on the event which need not necessarily be related to the \ncreditworthiness of the counterparty involved. An indicative list of performance \nguarantees, attracting a CCF of 50 per cent is as under:  \n\uf0b7 Bid bonds;  \n\uf0b7 Performance bonds and export performance guara ntees;  \n\uf0b7 Guarantees in lieu of security deposits / earnest money deposits (EMD) for \nparticipating in tenders;  \n\uf0b7 Retention money guarantees;  \n\uf0b7 Warranties, indemnities and standby letters of credit related to particular \ntransaction.  \n \n8.16.3  Treatment of Total Counterpart y Credit Risk  \n8.16.3.1  The total capital charge for counterparty credit risk will cover the default risk as \nwell as credit migration risk of the counterparty reflected in mark -to-market losses on the \nexpected counterparty risk (such losses being known as credit val ue adjustments, CVA). \nCounterparty risk may arise in the context of OTC derivatives and Securities Financing \nTransactions. Such instruments generally exhibit the following abstract characteristics:  \n(i) The transactions generate a current exposure or market val ue. \n(ii) The transactions have an associated random future market value based on market \nvariables.  \n(iii) The transactions generate an exchange of payments or an exchange of a financial \ninstrument against payment.  \n(iv) Collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and i s inherent in the nature of some \ntransactions.  \n(v) Short -term financing may be a primary objective in that the transactions mostly consist \nof an exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a relatively short \nperiod of time, usually for the busin ess purpose of financing. The two sides of the \ntransactions are not the result of separate decisions but form an indivisible whole to \naccomplish a defined objective.   \n47 (vi) Netting may be used to mitigate the risk . \n(vii) Positions are frequently valued (most commonly o n a daily basis), according to market \nvariables.  \n(viii) Remargining may be employed.  \nThe \u2018 capital charge for default risk\u2019  will be calculated using Current Exposure Method  as \nexplained in  section  8.16.3.3. The \u2018 capital charge for CVA risk\u2019  will be calculated as \nexplained in section  8.16.3.4. The Current Exposure method is applicable only to OTC \nderivatives. The counterparty risk on account of Securities Financing Transactions is \ncovered in section  10.3.8  of this Chapter .  \n \n \n8.16.3.2  When entering into bilateral OTC derivat ive transactions, AIFIs  are required to \nhold capital to protect against the risk that the counterparty defaults and for credit valuation \nadjustment (CVA) risk. The CVA charge is introduced as part of the Basel III framework as \nexplained in the sections  below. \n \n8.16.3.3  Default Risk Capital Charge for CCR  \nThe exposure amount for the purpose of computing for default risk capital charge for \ncounterparty credit risk will be calculated using the Current Exposure Method (CEM)  \ndescribed as under:  \n(i) The credit equivalent amo unt of a market related off -balance sheet transaction \ncalculated using the current exposure method is the sum of current credit exposure and \npotential future credit exposure of these contracts. For this purpose, credit equivalent \namount will be adjusted fo r legally valid eligible financial collaterals in accordance with \nsection  10.3 \u2013 Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques \u2013 Collateralised Transactions and the \nprovisions held by the AIFI for CVA losses.  \n(ii) The CVA loss will be calculated as a prudent valuation adj ustment as per prudent \nvaluation guidance contained in section  11.8.1, without taking into account any offsetting \ndebit valuation adjustments (DVA) which have been deducted from capital (please see \nsection  7.4.5). The CVA loss deduc ted from exposures to de termine outstanding EAD is the \nCVA loss gross of all DVA which have been separately deducted from capital. To the extent \nDVA has not been separately deducted from a n AIFI\u2019s  capital, the CVA loss used to \ndetermine outstanding EAD will be net of such DVA. Ri sk Weighted Assets for a given OTC \nderivative counterparty may be calculated as the applicable risk weight under the \nStandardised or IRB approach multiplied by the outstanding EAD of the counterparty. This \nreduction of EAD by CVA losses does not apply to t he determination of the CVA risk capital \ncharge as per formula given in section  8.16.3.4 (ii). \n(iii) While computing the credit exposure AIFIs  may exclude \u2018 sold options\u2019  that are \noutside netting and margin agreements , provided the entire premium / fee or any oth er form \nof income is received / realised.  \n(iv) Current credit exposure is defined as the sum of the positive mark -to-market value of \nthese contracts. The Current Exposure Method requires periodical calculation of the current \ncredit exposure by marking these co ntracts to market , thus capturing the current credit \nexposure.      \n(v) Potential future credit exposure is determined by multiplying the notional principal \namount of each of these contracts irrespective of whether the contract has a zero, positive or \nnegative  mark -to-market value by the relevant add -on factor indicated below according to \nthe nature and residual maturity of the instrument.  \n  \n48 Table  9: Credit Conversion Factors for Market -Related Off -Balance Sheet Items56 \n Credit Conversion Factors (%)  \nInterest R ate Contracts  Exchange Rate \nContracts and Gold  \nOne year or less  0.50 2.00 \nOver one year to five \nyears  1.00 10.00  \nOver five years  3.00 15.00  \nNotes:  \n(a) For contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the add -on factors are to be \nmultiplied by the numbe r of remaining payments in the contract.   \n(b) For contracts that are structured to settle outstanding exposure following specified \npayment dates and where the terms are reset such that the market value of the \ncontract is zero on these specified dates, the res idual maturity would be set equal to \nthe time until the next reset date. However, in the case of interest rate contracts \nwhich have residual maturities of more than one year and meet the above criteria, \nthe CCF or add -on factor is subject to a floor of 1.0 %.   \n(c) No potential future credit exposure would be calculated for single currency floating / \nfloating interest rate swaps; the credit exposure on these contracts would be \nevaluated solely on the basis of their mark -to-market value.  \n(d) Potential future exposur es should be based on \u2018effective\u2019 rather than \u2019apparent \nnotional amounts\u2019. In the event that the \u2018stated notional amount\u2019 is leveraged or \nenhanced by the structure of the transaction, AIFIs  shall use the \u2018effective notional \namount\u2019 when determining potenti al future exposure. For example, a stated notional \namount of USD 1 million with payments based on an internal rate of two times the \nPrime Lending Rate ( PLR)/Base Rate  would have an effective notional amount of \nUSD 2 million.  \n(vi) When effective bilateral nettin g contracts as spe cified in Annex 17 (part B)  are in \nplace, RC will be the net replacement cost and the add -on will be A Net as calculated below:  \n(a) Credit exposure on bilaterally netted forward transactions will be calculated as \nthe sum of the net mark -to-market replacement cost, if positive, plus an add -on \nbased on the notional underlying principal. The add -on for netted transactions (A Net) \nwill equal the weighted average of the gross add -on (A Gross) and the gross add -on \nadjusted by the ratio of net current replacement cost to gross current replacement \ncost (NGR). This is expressed through the following formula:  \nANet = 0.4 \u00b7 A Gross + 0.6 \u00b7 NGR \u00b7 A Gross \nwhere:  \nNGR = level of net replacement cost/level of gross replacement cost for \ntransactions subject to legally enforceable netting agreements57 \nAGross = sum of individual add -on amounts (calculated by multiplying the \nnotional principal amount by the appropriate add -on factors set out in Table 9 \n                                            \n56 Please refer to section  11.6.3 for credit default  swaps.  \n57 AIFIs must calculate NGR on a counterparty by counterparty basis for all transactions that are \nsubject to legally enforceable netting agreements   \n49 of section  8.16.3.3 and Tables 2 0 & 21 of section  11.6.3) of all transactions \nsubject to legally enforceable netting agreements with one counterparty.  \n(b) For the purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure to a netting \ncounterparty for forward foreign exchange contracts and other simila r contracts in \nwhich the notional principal amount is equivalent to cash flows, the notional principal \nis defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency. The \nreason for this is that offsetting contracts in the same currency mat uring on the same \ndate will have lower potential future exposure as well as lower current exposure.  \nNote: For any clarifications regarding Bilateral Netting, AIFIs may refer to Annex 2 3 of \nMaster Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations dated May 12, 2023  addressed to banks.  \n8.16.3.4  Capitalisation of mark -to-market counterparty risk losses (CVA capital \ncharge)  \n(i) In addition to the default risk capital requir ement for counterparty credit risk, AIFIs  are \nalso required to compute an additional capital charge to cover the risk of mark -to-market \nlosses on the expected counterparty risk (such losses being known as credit value \nadjustments, CVA) to OTC derivatives. The CVA capital charge will be calculated in the \nmanner indicated below in clause  (ii). AIFIs  are not required to include in this capital charge \n(a) transactions with a central counterparty (CCP); and (b) securities financing transactions \n(SFTs).  \n(ii) AIFIs should use the following formula to calculate a portfolio capital charge for \nCVA risk for their counterparties:  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhere;  \n\uf0b7 h is the one -year risk horizon (in units of a year), h = 1.  \n\uf0b7 wi is the weight applicable to counterparty \u2018i\u2019. Counterparty \u2018i\u2019 shall be mapped to one \nof the seven weights wi based on its external rating as shown in the Table  below . \nRating  Wi \nAAA 0.7%  \nAA 0.7%  \nA 0.8%  \nBBB 1.0%  \nBB 2.0%  \nB and unrated  3.0%  \nCCC  10.0%58 \n \n\uf0b7 EAD itotal is the exposure at default of counterparty \u2018i\u2019  (sum med across its netting sets)  \nincluding the effect of collateral as per the existing Current Exposure Method (CEM) \nas applicable to the calculation of counterparty risk capital charges for such \ncounterparty by the AIFI. The exposure should be discounted by applying the factor \n(1-exp(-0.05*M i))/(0.05*M i).  \n \n                                            \n58 Please refer to the revised version of Basel III capital rules (bcbs189.doc) issued by the BCBS vide \npress release on June 1, 2011.  \n \n50 \uf0b7 Bi is the notional of purchased single name CDS hedges (summed if more than one \nposition) referencing counterparty \u2018i\u2019  and used to hedge CVA risk. This notional \namount should be discounted by applying the factor (1 -exp(-0.05*M ihedge))/(0.05* \nMihedge).  \n \n\uf0b7 Bind is the full notional of one or more index CDS of purchased protection, used to \nhedge CVA risk. This notional amount should be discounted by applying the factor \n(1-exp(-0.05*M ind))/(0.05* M ind).  \n \n\uf0b7 wind is the weight applicable to index hedges. The AIFI shall map indices to one of \nthe seven weights w i based on the average spread of index \u2018ind\u2019.  \n \n\uf0b7 Mi is the effective maturity of the transactions with counterparty \u2018i\u2019. Mi is the notional \nweighted average mat urity of all the contracts with counterparty \u2018i\u2019.  \n \n\uf0b7 Mihedge is the maturity of the hedge instrument with notional B i (the quantities M ihedge. \nBi are to be summed if these are several positions).  \n \n\uf0b7 Mind is the maturity of the index hedge \u2018ind\u2019. In case of mo re than one index hedge \nposition, it is the notional weighted average maturity.  \n \n\uf0b7 For any counterparty that is also a constituent of an index on which a CDS is used for \nhedging counterparty credit risk, the notional amount attributable to that single name \n(as per its reference entity weight) may be subtracted from the index CDS notional \namount and treated as a single name hedge (Bi) of the individual counterparty with \nmaturity based on the maturity of the index.  \n\uf0b7 In cases where the unrated counterparty is a  scheduled commercial bank, AIFIs may \nuse the following Table to arrive at the implied ratings of the counterparty -bank and \nconsequently, the W i  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\uf0b7 AIFIs  will have to continuously monitor the capital adequacy position of their \ncounterparty banks so that the effect of any change in the implied ratings is \nadequately reflected in CVA cap ital charge calculations.  \nAn illustration of CVA risk capital charge has been furnished  in Annex 11 . \n \n8.16.3.5  Calculation of the Aggregate CCR and CVA Risk Capital Charges  \nThe total CCR capital charge for the AIFI is determined as the  sum of the following two \ncomponents:  \n(i) The sum over all counterparties of the CEM based capital charge determined as per \nsection  8.16.3.3; and  \n \n(ii) The standardised CVA risk capital charge determined as per section  8.16.3.4  \n Applicable Risk weight of \nthe Counterparty -bank \naccording to Table 4 of \nsection  8.6  Implied \nratings  Wi \n20 AAA/AA  0.7%  \n50 A 0.8%  \n100 BBB 1% \n150 BB 2% \n625 CCC  10%  \n51 8.16.3.6  Capital requirement  for exposures  to Central Counterparties (CCPs) Scope \nof Application    \n(i) Exposures to central counterparties arising from OTC derivatives transactions, \nexchange traded derivatives transactions and securities financing transactions (SFTs) \nwill be subject to the counterpart y credit risk treatment as indic ated in this section  \nbelow.  \n(ii) Exposures arising from the settlement of cash transactions (equities, fixed income, spot \nFX, commodity etc.) are not subject to this treatment. The settlement of cash \ntransactions remains subject  to the treatment described in section  8.16.4 of this \nChapter .   \n(iii) When the clearing member -to-client leg of an exchange traded derivatives transaction is \nconducted under a bilateral agreement, both the client bank and the clearing member \nare to capitalise t hat transaction as an OTC derivative.  \n(iv) For the purpose of capital adequacy framework, CCPs will be considered as financial \ninstitution. Accordingly, a n AIFI\u2019s investments in the capital of CCPs will be guided in \nterms of section  7.5.2  of this Chapter .  \n \n(v) Capital requirements will be dependent on the nature of CCPs viz. Qualifying CCPs \n(QCCPs) and non -Qualifying CCPs.  \n(a) Regardless of whether a CCP is classified as a QCCP or not, a n AIFI retains the \nresponsibility to ensure that it maintains adequate capital for  its exposures. Under Pillar \n2, an AIFI should consider whether it might need to hold capital in excess of the \nminimum capital requirements if, for example, (i) its dealings with a CCP give rise to \nmore risky exposures or (ii) where, given the context of t hat AIFI\u2019s dealings, it is unclear \nthat the CCP meets the definition of a QCCP.  \n(b) AIFIs  may be required to hold additional capital against their exposures to QCCPs \nvia Pillar 2, if in the opinion of the Reserve Bank , it is necessary to do so. This might be \nconsidered appropriate where, for example, an external assessment such as an \nFinancial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) of International Monetary Fund / World \nBank has found material shortcomings in the CCP or the regulation of CCPs, and the \nCCP and / or t he CCP regulator have not since publicly addressed the issues identified.  \n(c) Where the AIFI is acting as a clearing member, the AIFI should assess through \nappropriate scenario analysis and stress testing whether the level of capital held against \nexposures to  a CCP adequately addresses the inherent risks of those transactions. This \nassessment will include potential future or contingent exposures resulting from future \ndrawings on default fund commitments, and/or from secondary commitments to take \nover or replac e offsetting transactions from clients of another clearing member in case \nof this clearing member defaulting or becoming insolvent.  \n(d) An AIFI shall monitor and report to senior management and the appropriate \ncommittee of the Board (e.g. , Risk Management Comm ittee) on a regular basis \n(quarterly or at more frequent intervals) all of its exposures to CCPs, including \nexposures arising from trading through a CCP and exposures arising from CCP \nmembership obligations such as default fund contributions.  \n(e) Unless Reser ve Bank  (DOR)  requires otherwise, the trades with a former QCCP \nmay continue to be capitalised as though they are with a QCCP for a period not \nexceeding three months from the date it ceases to qualify as a QCCP. After that time, \nthe AIFI\u2019s  exposures with s uch a central counterparty shall be capitalised according to \nrules applicable for non -QCCP.   \n52  \n8.16.3.7  Exposures to Qualifying CCPs (QCCPs)  \n(A) Trade exposures  \n(i) Clearing member exposures  to QCCPs  \n(a) Where a n AIFI acts as a clearing member of a QCCP for its own purposes, a risk \nweight of 2% shall be applied to the AIFI\u2019s trade exposure to the QCCP in respect of OTC \nderivatives transactions, exchange traded derivatives transactions and SFTs.  \n(b) The exposure amount for such trade exposure will be calculated in accordance with \nthe Current Exposure Method (CEM) for derivatives and rules as applicable for capital \nadequacy for Repo / Reverse Repo -style transactions59. \n(c) Where settlement is legally enforceable on a net basis in an event of default and \nregardless of whether the counterpa rty is insolvent or bankrupt, the total replacement cost of \nall contracts relevant to the trade exposure determination can be calculated as a net \nreplacement cost if the applicable close -out netting sets meet the requirements set out \nin Annex 17  of these guidelines.  \n(d) AIFIs will have to demonstrate that the conditions men tioned in  Annex 17  are fulfilled \non a regular basis by obtaining independent and reasoned legal opinion as regards legal \ncertainty of  netting of exposures to QCCPs. AIFIs may also obtain from the QCCPs, the \nlegal opinion taken by the respective QCCPs on the legal certainty of their major activities \nsuch as settlement finality, netting, collateral arrangements (including margin arrangeme nts); \ndefault procedures etc.  \n \n \n(ii) Client AIFI exposures to clearing member  \n(a) Where a n AIFI is a client of the clearing member, and enters into a transaction with \nthe clearing member acting as a financial intermediary (i.e. , the clearing member completes \nan of fsetting transaction with a QCCP), the client\u2019s exposures to the clearing member will \nreceive the treatment  prescribed in clause (i) above provided  the following conditions are \nmet:  \n\uf0d8 The offsetting transactions are identified by the QCCP as client transact ions and \ncollateral to support them is held by the QCCP and / or the clearing member, as applicable, \nunder arrangements that prevent any losses to the client due to:  \n\uf0b7 the default or insolvency of the clearing member;  \n\uf0b7 the default or insolvency of the clear ing member\u2019s other clients; and  \n\uf0b7 the joint default or insolvency of the clearing member and any of its other clients.  \nThe client AIFI shall obtain an independent, written and reasoned legal opinion that \nconcludes that, in the event of legal challenge, the  relevant courts and administrative \nauthorities would find that the client would bear no losses on account of the insolvency of an \nintermediary under the relevant law, including:  \n\uf0b7 the law(s) applicable to client AIFI, clearing member and QCCP;  \n\uf0b7 the law of the jurisdiction(s) of the foreign countries in which the client AIFI, \nclearing member or QCCP are located  \n\uf0b7 the law that governs the individual transactions and collateral; and  \n\uf0b7 the law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to meet this conditio n.  \n\uf0d8 Relevant laws, regulations, rules, contractual, or administrative arrangements \nprovide that the offsetting transactions with the defaulted or insolvent clearing member are \nhighly likely to continue to be indirectly transacted through the QCCP, or by th e QCCP, \n                                            \n59 Please refer to paragraph 10.3.8 of this Master Direction   \n53 should the clearing member default or become insolvent. In such circumstances, the client \npositions and collateral with the QCCP will be transferred at the market value unless the \nclient requests to close out the position at the market value. In th is context, it may be \nclarified that if relevant laws, regulations, rules, contractual or administrative agreements \nprovide that trades are highly likely to be ported, this condition can be considered to be met. \nIf there is a clear precedent for transactio ns being ported at a QCCP and intention of the \nparticipants is to continue this practice, then these factors should be considered while \nassessing if trades are highly likely to be ported. The fact that QCCP documentation does \nnot prohibit client trades fro m being ported is not sufficient to conclude that they are highly \nlikely to be ported. Other evidence such as the criteria mentioned in this section  is \nnecessary to make this claim.   \n(b) Where a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearin g member and \nanother client of the clearing member jointly default or become jointly insolvent, but all other \nconditions mentioned above are met and the concerned CCP is a QCCP, a risk weight of \n4% will apply to the client\u2019s exposure to the clearing member .  \n(c) Where the client AIFI does not meet the requirements in the above section s, the AIFI \nwill be required to capitalize its exposure (including potential CVA risk exposure) to the \nclearing member as a bilateral trade.  \n(d) Under situations in which a client ent ers into a transaction with the QCCP with a \nclearing member guaranteeing its performance, the capital requirements will be based on \nsection 8  of this Chapter .  \n(iii) Treatment of posted collateral  \n(a) In all cases, any assets or collateral posted shall, from the pe rspective of the AIFI \nposting such collateral, receive the risk weights that otherwise applies to such assets or \ncollateral under the capital adequacy framework, regardless of the fact that such assets \nhave been posted as collateral. Thus , collateral poste d from Banking Book will receive \nBanking Book treatment and collateral posted from Trading Book will receive Trading Book \ntreatment. Where assets or collateral of a clearing member or client are posted with a QCCP \nor a clearing member and are not held in a  bankruptcy remote manner, the AIFI posting \nsuch assets or collateral shall also recognise credit risk based upon the assets or collateral \nbeing exposed to risk of loss based on the creditworthiness of the entity60 holding such \nassets or collateral.  \n(b) Collate ral posted by the clearing member (including cash, securities, other pledged \nassets, and excess initial or variation margin, also called over -collateralisation), that is held \nby a custodian61, and is bankruptcy remote from the QCCP, is not subject to a capi tal \nrequirement for counterparty credit risk exposure to such bankruptcy remote custodian.  \n(c) Collateral posted by a client, that is held by a custodian, and is bankruptcy remote \nfrom the QCCP, the clearing member and other clients, is not subject to a capita l \nrequirement for counterparty credit risk. If the collateral is held at the QCCP on a client \u2019s \nbehalf and is not held on a bankruptcy remote basis, a 2% risk weight will be applied to the \ncollateral if the conditions established in the section  on \u201cclient AIFI exposures to clearing \nmember \u201d of this section are met (mentioned above). A risk weight of 4% will be made \napplicable if a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearing member and \n                                            \n60 Where the entity holding such assets or collateral is the QCCP, a risk -weight  of 2% applies to \ncollateral included in the definition of trade exposures. The relevant risk -weight of the QCCP will apply \nto assets or collateral posted for other purposes.   \n61  In this section , the word \u201ccustodian\u201d may include a trustee, agent, pledgee,  secured creditor or any \nother person that holds property in a way that does not give such person a beneficial interest in such \nproperty and will not result in such property being subject to legally -enforceable claims by such \npersons, creditors, or to a co urt-ordered stay of the return of such property, should such person \nbecome insolvent or bankrupt.    \n54 another client of the clearing member jointly defaul t or become jointly insolvent, but all other \nconditions mentioned in the section  on \u201cclient AIFI exposures to clearing members \u201d of this \nsection are met.  \n(d) If a clearing member collects collateral from a client for client cleared trades and this \ncollateral is  passed on to the QCCP, the clearing member may recognize this collateral for \nboth the QCCP - clearing member leg and the clearing member - client leg of the client \ncleared trade. Therefore, initial margins (IMs) as posted by clients to clearing members \nmitigate the exposure the clearing member has against these clients.  \n(B) Default Fund Exposures to QCCPs  \n(i) Where a default fund is shared between products or types of business with \nsettlement risk only (e.g. , equities and bonds) and products or types of business which give \nrise to counterparty credit risk , i.e., OTC derivatives, exchange traded derivatives or SFTs, \nall of the default fund contributions will receive the risk weight determined according to the \nformulae and methodology set forth below, without apport ioning to different classes or types \nof business or products.  \n(ii) However, where the default fund contributions from clearing members are \nsegregated by product types and only accessible for specific product types, the capital \nrequirements for those default fu nd exposures determined according to the formulae and \nmethodology set forth below shall be calculated for each specific product giving rise to \ncounterparty credit risk. In case the QCCP \u2019s prefunded own resources are shared among \nproduct types, the QCCP wil l have to allocate those funds to each of the calculations, in \nproportion to the respective product specific exposure , i.e., EAD.  \n(iii) Clearing member AIFIs are required to capitalise their exposures arising from default \nfund contributions to a qualifying CCP by applying the following formula:  \n\uf0b7 Clearing member AIFIs may apply a risk -weight of 1250% to their default fund \nexposures to the qualifying CCP, subject to an overall cap on the risk -weighted \nassets from all its exposures to the QCCP (i.e., including trade  exposures) equal \nto 20% of the trade exposures to the QCCP. More specifically, the Risk Weighted  \nAssets (RWA) for both AIFI i\u2019s trade and default fund exposures to each QCCP \nare equal to62: \nMin {(2% * TE i + 1250% * DF i); (20% * TE i)} \nWhere;  \nTEi is AIFI i\u2019s trade exposure to the QCCP;  and \nDF i is AIFI i's pre -funded contribution to the QCCP's default fund.  \n8.16.3.8  Exposures to Non -qualifying CCPs  \n(a) AIFIs  shall apply the Standardised Approach for credit risk according to the category \nof the counterparty, to their trade  exposure to a non -qualifying CCP63.  \n(b) AIFIs  shall apply a risk weight of 1250 % to their default fund contributions to a non -\nqualifying CCP.  \n(c) For the purposes of this section , the default fund contributions of such AIFIs  will \ninclude both the funded and the unfunded contributions which are liable to be paid should \nthe CCP so require. Where there is a liability for unfunded contributions (i.e. , unlimited \nbinding commitments) the Reserve Bank will determine in its Pillar 2 assessments the \namount of unfunded com mitments to which 1250 % risk weight should apply.  \n                                            \n62 The 2% risk weight on trade exposures does not apply additionally, as it is included in the equation.  \n63  In cases where a CCP is to be considered as non -QCCP and the exposure is to be reckoned on \nCCP, the applicable risk weight will be according to the ratings assigned to the CCPs.    \n55 8.16.4  Failed Transactions  \n(a) With regard to unsettled securities and foreign exchange transactions, AIFIs  are \nexposed to counterparty credit risk from trade date, irrespective of the booking or the \naccounting of the  transaction. AIFIs  are encouraged to develop, implement and improve \nsystems for tracking and monitoring the credit risk exposure arising from unsettled \ntransactions as appropriate for producing management information that facili tates action on \na timely ba sis. \n(b) AIFIs  shall closely monitor securities and foreign exchange transactions that have \nfailed, starting from the day they fail for producing management information that facilitates \naction on a timely basis.  Failed transactions give rise to risk of delaye d settlement or \ndelivery.  \n(c) Failure of transactions settled through a delivery -versus -payment system (DvP), \nproviding simultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose AIFIs  to a risk of loss on \nthe difference between the transaction valued at the agree d settlement price and the \ntransaction valued at current market price (i.e. , positive current exposure). Failed \ntransactions where cash is paid without receipt of the corresponding receivable (securities, \nforeign currencies, or gold,) or, conversely, deliv erables were delivered without receipt of the \ncorresponding cash payment (non -DvP, or free delivery) expose AIFIs  to a risk of loss on \nthe full amount of cash paid or deliverables delivered. Therefore, a capital charge is required \nfor failed transactions a nd shall be calculated as under. The following capital treatment is \napplicable to all failed transactions, including transactions through recognised clearing \nhouses and Central Counterparties. Repurchase and reverse -repurchase agreements as \nwell as securit ies lending and borrowing that have failed to settle are excluded from this \ncapital treatment.  \n(d) For DvP Transactions  \u2013 If the payments have not yet taken place five business \ndays after the settlement date, AIFIs are required to calculate a capital charge  by \nmultiplying the positive current exposure of the transaction by the appropriate factor as \nunder. In order to capture the information, AIFIs will need to upgrade their information \nsystems in order to track the number of days after the agreed settlement da te and calculate \nthe corresponding capital charge.  \nNumber of working days after the \nagreed settlement date  Corresponding risk multiplier  \n(in %) \nFrom 5 to 15  9 \nFrom 16 to 30  50 \nFrom 31 to 45  75 \n46 or more  100 \n \n(e)    For non -DvP transactions (free deliveri es) after the first contractual payment / \ndelivery leg, the AIFI that has made the payment will treat its exposure as a loan if the \nsecond leg has not been received by the end of the business day. If the dates when two \npayment legs are made are the same ac cording to the time zones where each payment is \nmade, it is deemed that they are settled on the same day. For example, if a bank in Tokyo \ntransfers Yen on day X (Japan Standard Time) and receives corresponding US Dollar via \nCHIPS on day X (US Eastern Stand ard Time), the settlement is deemed to take place on the \nsame value date. AIFIs  shall compute the capital requirement using the counterparty risk \nweights prescribed in these guidelines. However, if five business days after the second \ncontractual payment / delivery date the second leg has not yet effectively taken place, the \nAIFI that has made the first payment leg will receive a risk weight of 1250 % on the full \namount of the value transferred plus replacement cost, if any. This treatment will apply until \nthe second payment / delivery leg is effectively made.  \n \n8.17 Securitisation Exposures  \nThe treatment  of securitisation exposures for capital adequacy shall be as  specified in the  \n56 Master Direction  \u2013 Reserve Bank of India (Securitisation of Standard Assets) Directio ns, \n2021  dated September 24, 202164. As specified under clause 4 of Master Direction ibid, \nthese directions, including those under chapter VI ibid, will be applicable to securitisation \ntransactions undertaken subsequent to the issue of these directions . For transactions \nundertaken before issuance of the aforementioned directions, i.e., prior to September 24, \n2021, the treatment of securitisation exposures for capital adequacy would be  as per the \nguidelines issued vide circular no.DBOD.NO.BP.BC.60/21.04.048/2 005-06 dated  February \n1, 2006 , as amended from time to time, and as consolidated in para 5.16 of Master Circular \nno.DBR.No.BP.BC.1/21.06.201/2015 -16 on Basel III Capital Regulations dated July 1, 2015.  \n \n8.18 Capital Adequacy  Requirement for Credit Default Swap (CDS ) Positions in the \nBanking Book  \n8.18.1  Recognition  of External / Third -party CDS Hedges  \n(i) In case of Banking Book positions hedged by bought CDS positions, no exposure will \nbe reckoned against the reference entity / underlying asset in respect of the hedged \nexposure, and exposure  will be deemed to have been substituted by the protection seller, if \nthe following conditions are satisfied:  \n(a) Operational requirements mentioned in paragraph 4 of circular \nDBOD.BP.BC.No.61/21.06.203/2011 -12 dated November 30, 2011  (as am ended from time \nto time)  addressed to banks  on Prudential Guidelines on Credit Default Swaps (CDS)  are \nmet (refer to Annex 6 of these guidelines ); \n(b) The risk weight applicable to the protection seller under the Standardised Approa ch \nfor credit risk is lower than that of the underlying asset; and  \n(c) There is no maturity mismatch between the underlying asset and the reference / \ndeliverable obligation. If this condition is not satisfied, then the amount of credit protection to \nbe recogni sed should be computed as indicated in section 8.18.3 (ii)  below.  \n \n8.18.2  If the conditions (a) and (b) above are not satisfied or the AIFI breaches  any of these \nconditions subsequently, the AIFI shall reckon the exposure on the underlying asset; and the \nCDS position will be transferred to Trading Book where it will be subject to specific risk, \ncounterparty credit risk and general market risk (whereve r applicable) capital requirements \nas applicable to Trading Book.  \n8.18.3  The unprotected portion of the underlying exposure should be risk -weighted as \napplicable under the Standardised Approach  for credit risk . The amount of credit protection \nshall be adjusted i f there are any mismatches between the underlying asset/ obligation and \nthe reference / deliverable asset / obligation with regard to asset or maturity. These are dealt \nwith in detail in the following sections . \n(i) Asset Mismatches : Asset mismatch will ari se if the underlying asset is different from \nthe reference asset or deliverable obligation. Protection will be reckoned as available by the \nprotection buyer only if the mismatched assets meet the requirements that (1) the reference \nobligation or deliverabl e obligation ranks pari passu with or is junior to the underlying \nobligation, and (2) the underlying obligation and reference obligation or deliverable obligation \nshare the same obligor (i.e. , the same legal entity) and legally enforceable cross -default or  \ncross -acceleration clauses are in place.  \n(ii) Maturity Mismatches : The protection buyer would be eligible to reckon the amount \nof protection if the maturity of the credit derivative contract were to be equal or more than the \nmaturity of the underlying ass et. If, however, the maturity of the CDS contract is less than \nthe maturity of the underlying asset, then it would be construed as a maturity mismatch. In \ncase of maturity mismatch the amount of protection will be determined in the following \nmanner:  \n                                            \n64 Master Direction no. DOR.STR.REC.53/21.04.177/2021 -22 dated September 24, 2021   \n57 (a) If the  residual maturity of the credit derivative product is less than three months  no \nprotection will be recognized.  \n(b) If the residual maturity of the credit derivative contract is three months  or more \nprotection proportional to the period for which it is availab le will be recognised.  \nWhen there is a maturity mismatch the following adjustment will be applied.  \n \nPa = P x (t - 0.25) \u00f7 (T - 0.25)  \n \nWhere:  \nPa = value of the credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch  \nP = credit protection  \nt = min (T, residual matur ity of the credit protection arrangement) expressed \nin years  \nT = min (5, residual maturity of the underlying exposure) expressed in years  \n \nExample:  Suppose the underlying asset is a corporate bond of Face Value of \nRs.100 where the residual maturity is of 5  years and the residual maturity of \nthe CDS is 4 years. The amount of credit protection is computed as under:  \n100 * {(4 - 0.25) \u00f7 (5 - 0.25)} = 100*(3.75\u00f7 4.75) = 78.95  \n \n(c) Once the residual maturity of the CDS contract reaches three months , protection \nceases  to be recognised.  \n \n8.18.4  Internal Hedges  \nAIFIs can use CDS contracts to hedge against the credit risk in their existing corporate \nbonds portfolios. A n AIFI  can hedge a Banking Book credit risk exposure either by an \ninternal hedge (the protection purchased from the trading desk of the AIFI and held in the \nTrading Book) or an external hedge (protection purchased from an eligible third party \nprotection provider). When a n AIFI hedges a Banking Book credit risk exposure (corporate \nbonds) using a CDS booked in its Tra ding Book (i.e. , using an internal hedge), the Banking \nBook exposure is not deemed to be hedged for capital purposes unless the AIFI transfers \nthe credit risk from the Trading Book to an eligible third party protection provider through a \nCDS meeting the re quirements of section  8.18 vis-\u00e0-vis the Banking Book exposure. Where \nsuch third party protection is purchased and is recognised as a hedge of a Banking Book \nexposure for regulatory capital purposes, no capital is required to be maintained on internal \nand external CDS hedge. In such cases, the external CDS will act as indirect hedge for the \nBanking Book exposure and the capital adequacy in terms of section 8.18 , as applicable for \nexternal/ third party hedges, will be applicable.  \n \n9. External Credit Assessments  \n9.1 Eligible  Credit Rating Agencies  \n9.1.1  The Reserve  Bank has undertaken the detailed process of identifying the eligible \ncredit  rating agencies, whose ratings may be used by AIFIs for assigning risk weights for \ncredit risk. In line with the provisions of the Revi sed Framework65, where the facility provided \nby the AIFIs possesses rating assigned by an eligible credit rating agency, the risk weight of \nthe claim will be based on this rating.  \n9.1.2  AIFIs may use the ratings of the following domestic credit rating agencies (arranged \nin alphabetical order) for the purposes of risk weighting their claims for capital adequacy \npurposes:  \n                                            \n65 Please refer to the Document \u2018 Internationa l Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital \nStandards \u2019 (June 2006) released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.   \n58 (a) ACUITE Ratings & Research Ltd. ( Acuit\u00e9 ) \n(b) Credit Analysis and Research Limited  (CARE) ; \n(c) CRISIL  Ratings  Limited;  \n(d) ICRA Limited ;  \n(e) India Ratings and Re search Private Limited (India Ratings);  and  \n(f) INFOMERICS Valuation and Rating Pvt Ltd. (INFOMERICS)  \n \n9.1.3  The Reserve Bank  has decided that AIFIs may use the ratings of the following \ninternational credit rating agencies (arranged in alphabetical order) for the p urposes of risk \nweighting their claims for capital adequacy purposes where specified:  \n(a)     Fitch;  \n(b)     Moody 's; and  \n(c)     Standard & Poor\u2019s  \n \n9.2 Scope of Application of External Ratings  \n9.2.1  AIFIs should use the chosen credit rating agencies and their ratings consisten tly for \neach type of claim, for both risk weighting and risk management purposes. AIFIs will not be \nallowed to \u201ccherry pick\u201d the assessments provided by different credit rating agencies and to \narbitrarily change the use of credit rating agencies. If a n AIFI has decided to use the ratings \nof some of the chosen credit rating agencies for a given type of claim, it can use only the \nratings of those credit rating agencies, despite the fact that some of these claims may be \nrated by other chosen credit rating agen cies whose ratings the AIFI has decided not to use. \nAIFI shall not use one agency\u2019s rating for one corporate bond, while using another agency\u2019s \nrating for anoth er exposure to the same counter party, unless the respective exposures are \nrated by only one of t he chosen credit rating agencies, whose ratings the AIFI has decided to \nuse. External assessments for one entity within a corporate group cannot be used to risk \nweight other entities within the same group . \n \n9.2.2  AIFIs shall disclose the names of the credit rati ng agencies that they use for the risk \nweighting of their assets, the risk weights associated with the particular rating grades as \ndetermined by Reserve Bank through the mapping process for each eligible credit rating \nagency as well as the aggregated risk weighted assets as required vid e Table DF -4 of \nAnnex 16 .  \n \n9.2.3  To be eligible for risk -weighting purposes, the external credit assessment shall take \ninto account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure the AIFI has with regard to \nall payments owed to it. For example, if a n AIFI is owed both principal and interest, the \nassessment shall fully take into account and reflect the credit risk associated with timely \nrepayment of both principal and interest.  \n \n9.2.4  To be eligible  for risk weighting purposes, the rating should be in force and confirmed \nfrom the monthly bulletin of the concerned rating agency. The rating agency should have \nreviewed the rating at least once during the previous 15 months.  \n \n9.2.5  An eligible credit assessmen t shall be publicly available. In other words, a rating shall \nbe published in an accessible form and included in the external credit rating agency\u2019s \ntransition matrix. Consequently, ratings that are made available only to the parties to a \ntransaction do no t satisfy this requirement.  \n \n9.2.6  For assets in the AIFI\u2019s portfolio that have contractual maturity less than or equal to \none year, short term ratings accorded by the chosen credit rating agencies would be \nrelevant. For other assets which have a contractual mat urity of more than one year, long \nterm ratings accorded by the chosen credit rating agencies would be relevant.  \n \n9.2.7  Cash credit exposures tend to be generally rolled over and also tend to be drawn on  \n59 an average for a major portion of the sanctioned limits. H ence, even though a cash credit \nexposure may be sanctioned for period of one year or less, these exposures should be \nreckoned as long term exposures and accordingly the long term ratings accorded by the \nchosen credit rating agencies will be relevant. Simil arly, AIFIs (if permitted to extend  cash \ncredit facility) may use long -term ratings of a counterparty as a proxy for an unrated short - \nterm exposure on the same counterparty subject to strict compliance with the requirements \nfor use of multiple rating asse ssments and applicability of issue rating to issuer / other claims \nas indicated in sections  9.4, 9.5, 9.7 and 9.8 below.  \n \n9.3 Mapping Process  \n9.3.1  This Capital Framework recommends development of a mapping process to assign \nthe ratings issued by eligible credit rat ing agencies to the risk weights available under the \nStandardised risk weighting framework. The mapping process is required to result in a risk \nweight assignment consistent with that of the level of credit risk. A mapping of the credit \nratings awarded by t he chosen domestic credit rating agencies has been furnished below in \nsection s 9.4.1 and 9.5.4, which should be used by AIFIs in assigning risk weights to the \nvarious exposures.  \n \n9.4 Long Term Ratings  \n9.4.1  On the basis of the above factors as well as the data made  available by the rating \nagencies, the ratings issued by the chosen domestic credit rating agencies have been \nmapped to the appropriate risk weights applicable as per the Standardised approach. The \nrating -risk weight mapping furnished in the Table  10 below  shall be adopted by all AIFIs in \nIndia:  \n \nTable 1 0: Risk Weight Mapping of Long Term Ratings of the chosen Domestic Rating \nAgencies  \nCARE  CRISIL \nRatings \nLimited  India \nRatings \nand \nResearc\nh Private \nLimited \n(India \nRatings)  ICRA   ACUITE \nRatings & \nResearch \nLtd.

For example, A+ or A - would be considered to be in the \nA rati ng category and assigned 50 per cent risk weight.  \n9.4.3  If an issuer has a long -term exposure with an external long term rating that warrants \na risk weight of 150 per cent, all unrated claims on the same counter -party, whether short -\nterm or long -term, should als o receive a 150 per cent risk weight, unless the AIFI uses \nrecognised credit risk mitigation techniques for such claims.  \n \n9.5 Short Term Ratings  \n9.5.1  For risk -weighting purposes, short -term ratings are deemed to be issue -specific. \nThey can only be used to derive ri sk weights for claims arising from the rated facility. They \ncannot be generalised to other short -term claims. In no event can a short -term rating be \nused to support a risk weight for an unrated long -term claim. Short -term assessments may \nonly be used for s hort-term claims against banks and corporates.  \n9.5.2  Notwithstanding the above restriction on using an issue specific short term rating for \nother short term exposures, the following broad principles will apply. The unrated short term \nclaim on counterparty will a ttract a risk weight of at least one level higher than the risk weight \napplicable to the rated short term claim on that counter -party. If a short -term rated facility to \ncounterparty attracts a 20 per cent or a 50 per cent risk -weight, unrated short -term cl aims to \nthe same counter -party cannot attract a risk weight lower than 30 per cent or 100 per cent \nrespectively.  \n9.5.3  Similarly, if an issuer has a short -term exposure with an external short term rating \nthat warrants a risk weight of 150 per cent, all unrated c laims on the same counter -party, \nwhether long -term or short -term, should also receive a 150 per cent risk weight, unless the \nAIFI uses recognised credit risk mitigation techniques for such claims.  \n \n9.5.4  In respect of the issue specific short term ratings the fo llowing risk weight mapping \nshall be adopted by AIFIs : \nTable 1 1: Risk Weight Mapping of Short Term  Ratings of  \nDomestic Rating Agencies  \n \nCARE  CRISIL \nRatings \nLimited  India \nRatings \nand \nResearch \nPrivate \nLimited \n(India \nRatings)  ICRA  ACUITE \nRatings & \nResearch \nLtd.

For \nexample, A2+ or A2- would be considered to be in the A2 rating category and assigned 50 \nper cent risk weight.  \n  \n61 9.5.6  The above risk weight mapping of both long term and short  term ratings of the \nchosen domestic rating agencies would be reviewed annually by the Reserve Bank.  \n \n9.6 Use of Unsolicited Ratings  \nA rating would be treated as solicited only if the issuer of the instrument has requested the \ncredit rating agency for the rati ng and has accepted the rating assigned by the agency. As a \ngeneral rule, AIFIs should use only solicited rating from the chosen credit rating \nagencies. No ratings issued by the credit rating agencies on an unsolicited basis should be \nconsidered for risk w eight calculation as per the Standardised Approach.  \n \n9.7 Use of Multiple Rating Assessments  \nAIFIs shall be guided by the following in respect of exposures / obligors having multiple \nratings from the chosen credit rating agencies chosen by the AIFI for the pur pose of risk \nweight calculation:  \n(i) If there is only one rating by a chosen credit rating agency for a particular claim, that \nrating would be used to determine the risk weight of the claim.  \n \n(ii) If there are two ratings accorded by chosen credit rating agencies t hat map into \ndifferent risk weights, the higher risk weight should be applied.  \n \n(iii) If there are three or more ratings accorded by chosen credit rating agencies with \ndifferent risk weights, the ratings corresponding to the two lowest risk weights should be \nreferred to and the higher of those two risk weights should be applied. i.e., the second lowest \nrisk weight.  \n \n9.8 Applicability of \u2018Issue Rating \u2019 to issuer/ other claims  \n9.8.1  Where a n AIFI invests in a particular issue that has an issue specific rating by a \nchosen cr edit rating agency the risk weight of the claim will be based on this assessment. \nWhere the AIFI\u2019s claim is not an investment in a specific assessed issue, the following  \ngeneral principles will apply:  \n(i) In circumstances where the borrower has a specific asse ssment for an issued debt - \nbut the AIFI\u2019s claim is not an investment in this particular debt - the rating applicable to the \nspecific debt (where the rating maps into a risk weight lower than that which applies to an \nunrated claim) may be applied to the AIFI\u2019s unassessed claim only if this claim ranks pari \npassu or senior to the specific rated debt in all respects and the maturity of the unassessed \nclaim is not later than the maturity of the rated claim,66 except where the rated claim is a \nshort term obligat ion as specified in section  9.5.2. If not, the rating applicable to the specific \ndebt cannot be used and the unassessed claim will receive the risk weight for unrated \nclaims. Here, it may be noted that the Reserve Bank had advised the E xternal Credit \nAssessment Institution s (ECAIs)  vide letter dated June 4, 2021 to disclose the name of the \nbanks and the corresponding credit facilities rated by them in the PRs issued on rating \nactions, after obtaining requisite consent from the borrowers.  It is advised that a loan rating67 \n                                            \n66 In a case where a short term claim on a counterparty is rated as A1+ and a long term claim on the \nsame counterparty is rated a s AAA, then a n AIFI may assign a 30 per cent risk weight to an unrated \nshort term claim and 20 per cent risk weight to an unrated long term claim on that counterparty where \nthe seniority of the claim ranks pari -passu with the rated claims and the maturity of the unrated claim \nis not later than the rated claim.  In a similar case where a short term claim is rated A1+ and a long \nterm claim is rated A, the AIFI may assign 50 per cent risk weight to an unrated short term or long \nterm claim . \n67 Please refer to circular No. DOR.STR.REC.71/21.06.201/2022 -23 on Review of Prudential Norms \u2013 \nRisk Weights for Exposures to Corporates and NBFCs  dated October 1 0, 2022.   \n62 without the above disclosure by the ECAI shall not be eligible for being reckoned for capital \ncomputation by banks. AIFIs  shall treat such exposures as unrated and assign applicable \nrisk weights in terms of section 8 .8.1 of th is Chapter68. \n \n(ii) In circumstances where the borrower has an issuer assessment, this assessment \ntypically applies to senior unsecured claims on that issuer. Consequently, only senior claims \non that issuer will benefit from a high quality issuer assessment. Other unassessed c laims of \na highly assessed issuer will be treated as unrated. If either the issuer or a single issue has \na low quality assessment (mapping into a risk weight equal to or higher than that which \napplies to unrated claims), an unassessed claim on the same cou nterparty that ranks pari -\npassu or is subordinated to either the senior unsecured issuer assessment or the exposure \nassessment will be assigned the same risk weight as is applicable to the low q uality \nassessment.   \n \n(iii) Where a n AIFI intends to extend an issuer  or an issue specific rating assigned by a \nchosen credit rating agency to any other exposure which the AIFI has on the same \ncounterparty and which meets the above criterion, it should be extended to the entire \namount of credit risk exposure the AIFI has wi th regard to that exposure i.e., both principal \nand interest.  \n \n(iv) With a view to avoiding any double counting of credit enhancement factors, no \nrecognition of credit risk mitigation techniques should be taken into account if the credit \nenhancement is already  reflected in the issue specific rating accorded by a chosen credit \nrating agency relied upon by the AIFI. \n \n(v) Where unrated exposures are risk weighted based on the rating of an equivalent \nexposure to that borrower, the general rule is that foreign currency ratings would be used \nonly for exposures in foreign currency.  \n10. Credit Risk Mitigation  \n10.1 General Principles  \n10.1.1  AIFIs use a number of techniques to mitigate the credit risks to which they are \nexposed. For example, exposures may be collateralised in whole or in pa rt by cash or \nsecurities, deposits from the same counterparty, guarantee of a third party, etc. Credit risk \nmitigation approach as detailed in this section is applicable to the banking book exposures. \nThis will also be applicable for calculation of the cou nterparty risk charges for OTC \nderivatives and repo -style transactions booked in the trading book.  \n \n10.1.2  The general principles applicable to use of credit risk mitigation techniques are as \nunder:  \n(i) No transaction in which Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) techniques  are used should \nreceive a higher capital requirement than an otherwise identical transaction where such \ntechniques are not used.  \n(ii) The effects of CRM will not be double counted. Therefore, no additional supervisory \nrecognition of CRM for regulatory capital  purposes will be granted on claims for which an \nissue -specific rating is used that already reflects that CRM.  \n                                            \n68 Illustratively, a scenario may be assumed, where a borrower has availed credit facilities from Banks \nA and B and  AIFI C and external rating from an ECAI is obtained only in respect of the credit facility \nextended by Bank A. If the ECAI has disclosed the name of Bank A and the corresponding credit \nfacility rated by it, then Bank A can reckon the said rating f or risk weighting purpose. AIFI C is \npermitted to derive risk weights for its respective unrated credit facilities subject to conditions stated in \nsection  9.8.1 (i). In the event of ECAI not making the above disclosure, none of the  financial  institution  \nshall reckon the said rating, and therefore shall apply risk weights of 100 percent or 150 percent as \napplicable in terms of extant instructions.   \n63  \n(iii) Principal -only ratings will not be allowed within the CRM framework.  \n  \n(iv) While the use of CRM techniques reduces or transfers credit risk, it sim ultaneously \nmay increase other risks (residual risks). Residual risks include legal, operational, liquidity \nand market risks. Therefore, it is imperative that AIFIs employ robust procedures and \nprocesses to control these risks, including strategy; consider ation of the underlying credit; \nvaluation; policies and procedures; systems; control of roll -off risks; and management of \nconcentration risk arising from the AIFI\u2019s use of CRM techniques and its interaction with the \nAIFI\u2019s overall credit risk profile. Wher e these risks are not adequately controlled, the Reserve \nBank may impose additional capital charges or take other supervisory actions. The \ndisclosure requirements prescribed in  Table DF -5 of Annex 16  shall also be obs erved for \nAIFIs to obtain capital relief in respect of any CRM techniques.  \n \n10.2 Legal Certainty  \n(i) In order for AIFIs to obtain capital relief for any use of CRM techniques, the following \nminimum standards for legal documentation shall be met. All documentation u sed in \ncollateralised transactions and guarantees shall be binding on all parties and legally \nenforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. AIFIs shall have conducted sufficient legal review, \nwhich should be well documented, to verify this  requirement . Such v erification should have a \nwell-founded legal basis for reaching the conclusion about the binding nature and \nenforceability of the documents. AIFIs should also undertake such further review as \nnecessary to ensure continuing enforceability.  \n \n10.3 Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques - Collateralised Transactions  \n10.3.1  A Collateralised Transaction is one in which:  \n(i) AIFIs have a credit exposure and that credit exposure is hedged in whole or in part \nby collateral posted by a counterparty or by a third party on behalf of the c ounterparty. Here, \n\u201ccounterparty\u201d is used to denote a party to whom a n AIFI has an on - or off -balance sheet \ncredit exposure.  \n \n(ii) AIFIs have a specific lien on the collateral and the requirements of legal certainty are \nmet. \n \n10.3.2  Overall framework and minimum cond itions  \nThe framework allows AIFIs adopt ion of  either the simple approach, which, similar to the \n1988 Accord, substitutes the risk weighting of the collateral for the risk weighting of the \ncounterparty for the collateralised portion of the exposure (general ly subject to a 20 per cent \nfloor), or the comprehensive approach, which allows fuller offset of collateral against \nexposures, by effectively reducing the exposure amount by the value ascribed to the \ncollateral. AIFIs shall adopt the Comprehensive Approach , which allows fuller offset of \ncollateral against exposures, by effectively reducing the exposure amount by the value \nascribed to the collateral. Under this approach, AIFIs , which take eligible financial collateral \n(e.g., cash or securities, more specific ally defined below), are allowed to reduce their credit \nexposure to a counterparty when calculating their capital requirements to take account of the \nrisk mitigating effect of the collateral.  Credit risk mitigation is allowed only on an account -by-\naccount  basis, even within regulatory retail portfolio. However, before capital relief will be \ngranted the standards set out below shall be met:   \n(i) In addition to the general requirements for legal certainty, the legal mechanism by \nwhich collateral is pledged or t ransferred shall ensure that the AIFI has the right to liquidate \nor take legal possession of it, in a timely manner, in the event of the default, insolvency or \nbankruptcy (or one or more otherwise -defined credit events set out in the transaction \ndocumentat ion) of the counterparty (and, where applicable, of the custodian holding the \ncollateral). Furthermore , AIFIs shall take all steps necessary to fulfill those requirements  \n64 under the law applicable to the AIFI\u2019s interest in the collateral for obtaining and m aintaining \nenforceable security interest, e.g. , by registering it with a registrar.  \n \n(ii) In order for collateral to provide protection, the credit quality of the counterparty and \nthe value of the collateral shall not have a material positive correlation. For e xample, \nsecurities issued by the counterparty - or by any related group entity - would provide little \nprotection and so would be ineligible.  \n \n(iii) AIFIs shall have clear and robust procedures for the timely liquidation of collateral to \nensure that any legal co nditions required for declaring the default of the counterparty and \nliquidating the collateral are observed, and that collateral can be liquidated promptly.  \n \n(iv) Where the collateral is held by a custodian, AIFIs shall take reasonable steps to \nensure that the custodian segregates the collateral from its own assets.  \n \n(v) AIFIs shall ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to the orderly operation of \nmargin agreements with OTC derivative and securities -financing counterparties, as \nmeasured by the timeliness and accuracy of its outgoing calls and response time to \nincoming calls. AIFIs shall have collateral management policies in place to control, monitor \nand report the following to the Board or one of its Committees:  \na) the risk to which margin agreements exposes the m (such as the volatility and \nliquidity of the securities exchanged as collateral),  \nb) the concentration risk to particular types of collateral,  \nc) the reuse of collateral (both cash and non -cash) including the potential \nliquidity shortfalls resulting from the  reuse of collateral received from counterparties, \nand  \nd) the surrender of rights on collateral posted to counterparties.  \n \n10.3.3  A capital requirement will be applied to a n AIFI on either side of the collateralised \ntransaction: for example, both repos and reverse repos will be subject to capital \nrequirements. Likewise, both sides of securities lending and borrowing transactions will be \nsubject to explicit capital charges, as will the posting of securities in connection with a \nderivative exposure or other borrowing.  \n \n10.3.4  The Comprehensive Approach  \n(i) In the comprehensive approach, when taking collateral, AIFIs will need to calculate \ntheir adjusted exposure to a counterparty for capital adequacy purposes in order to take \naccount of the effects of that collateral. AIFIs are r equired to adjust both the amount of the \nexposure to the counterparty and the value of any collateral received in support of that \ncounterparty to take account of possible future fluctuations in the value of either, occasioned \nby market movements. These adj ustments are referred to as \u2018haircuts\u2019. The application of \nhaircuts will produce volatility adjusted amounts for both exposure and collateral. The \nvolatility adjusted amount for the exposure will be higher than the exposure and the volatility \nadjusted amou nt for the collateral will be lower than the collateral, unless either side of the \ntransaction is cash. In other words, the \u2018haircut\u2019 for the exposure will be a premium factor \nand the \u2018haircut\u2019 for the collateral will be a discount factor.  It may be noted  that the purpose \nunderlying the application of haircut is to capture the market -related volatility inherent in the \nvalue of exposures as well as of the eligible financial collaterals. Since the value of credit \nexposures acquired by AIFIs in the course of their operations, would not be subject to \nmarket volatility, (since the loan disbursal / investment would be a \u201ccash\u201d transaction) though \nthe value of eligible financial collateral would be, the haircut stipulated in Table -12 (section  \n10.3.7) would apply i n respect of credit transactions only to the eligible collateral but not to \nthe credit exposure of the AIFI.  On the other hand, exposures of AIFIs , arising out of repo -\nstyle transactions would require upward adjustment for volatility, as the value of secu rity  \n65 sold/lent/pledged in the repo transaction, would be subject to market volatility. Hence, such \nexposures shall attract haircut.   \n \n(ii) Additionally where the exposure and collateral are held in different currencies an \nadditional downwards adjustment shall be made to the volatility adjusted collateral amount to \ntake account of possible future fluctuations in exchange rates.  \n \n(iii) Where the volatility -adjusted exposure amount is greater than the volatility -adjusted \ncollateral amount (including any further adjustme nt for foreign exchange risk), AIFIs shall \ncalculate their risk -weighted assets as the difference between the two multiplied by the risk \nweight of the counterparty. The framework for performing calculations of capital requirement \nis indicated in section  10.3.6. \n \n10.3.5  Eligible Financial Collateral  \nThe following collateral instruments are eligible for recognition in the comprehensive \napproach:  \n(i) Cash  (as well as certificates of deposit or comparable instruments, including fixed \ndeposit receipts, issued by the lendin g AIFI) on deposit with the AIFI which is \nincurring the counterparty exposure.  \n(ii) Gold : Gold would include both bullion and jewellery. However, the value of the \ncollateralised jewellery should be arrived at after notionally converting these to 99.99 \npurity.  \n(iii) Securities  issued by Central and State Governments  \n(iv) Kisan Vikas Patra  and National Savings Certificates provided no lock -in period is \noperational and if they can be encashed within the holding period.  \n(v) Life insurance  policies with a declared surrender value of an insurance company \nwhich is regulated by an insurance sector regulator.  \n(vi) Debt securities  rated by a chosen Credit Rating Agency in respect of which AIFIs \nshould be sufficiently confident about the market liquidity69 where these are either:  \n(a) Attracting 1 00 per cent or lesser risk weight i.e., rated at least BBB( -) when \nissued by public sector entities and other entities (including banks and Primary \nDealers); or  \n \n(b) Attracting 100 per cent or lesser risk weight i.e., rated at least CARE A3 / \nCRISIL A3/  India R atings and Research Private Limited (India Ratings)  A3/ICRA A3/  \nAcuit\u00e9  A3/IVR A3 for short -term debt instruments . \n \n(vii) Debt Securities not rated by a chosen Credit Rating Agency in respect of which AIFIs \nshould be sufficiently confident about the market liquid ity where these are:  \n(a) issued by a bank; and  \n \n(b) listed on a recognised exchange; and  \n \n(c) classified as senior debt; and  \n \n(d) all rated issues of the same seniority by the issuing bank are rated at least \n                                            \n69 A debenture would meet the test of liquidity if it is traded on a recognised stock exchange(s) on at \nleast 90 per cent of the trading days during the preceding 365 days. Further, liquidity can be \nevidenced in the trading during the previous one month in the recognised stock exchange if there are \na minimum of 25  trades of marketable lots in securities of each issue r.  \n66 BBB( -) or CARE A3/ CRISIL A3/  India Ratings and Research Private  Limited (India \nRatings)  A3/ICRA A3/ Acuit\u00e9  A3 /IVR A3 by a chosen Credit Rating Agency; and  \n \n(e) the AIFI holding the securities as collateral has no information to suggest that \nthe issue justifies a rating below BBB( -) or CARE A3/ CRISIL A3/  India Ratings an d \nResearch Private Limited (India Ratings)  A3/ICRA A3/ Acuit\u00e9  A3 /I VR A3(as \napplicable) and;  \n \n(f) AIFIs should be sufficiently confident about the market liquidity of the security.  \n \n(viii) Units of Mutual Funds regulated by the securities regulator of the jurisdiction  of the \nAIFI\u2019s operation mutual funds where:  \n(a) a price for the units is publicly quoted daily i.e., where the daily NAV is \navailable in public domain; and  \n(b) Mutual fund is limited to investing in the instruments listed in this section . \n \n10.3.6  Calculation of capital requirement  \nFor a collateralised transaction, the exposure amount after risk mitigation is calculated as \nfollows:  \nE* =  max {0, [E x (1 + H e) - C x (1 - Hc - Hfx)]} \n                 \nwhere:  \nE* = the exposure value after risk mitigation  \nE  =  current value o f the exposure for which the collateral qualifies as a risk  \nmitigant  \nHe = haircut appropriate to the exposure  \nC =  the current value of the collateral received  \nHc =  haircut appropriate to the collateral  \nHfx = haircut appropriate for currency mismatch betw een the collateral and  \nexposure  \n \nThe exposure amount after risk mitigation (i.e., E*) will be multiplied by the risk weight of the \ncounterparty to obtain the risk -weighted asset amount for the collateralised transaction. \nIllustrative examples calculating t he effect of Credit Risk Mitigation is f urnished in Annex  7. \n \n10.3.7  Haircuts  \n(i) In principle, AIFIs have two ways of calculating the haircuts: (i) standard supervisory  \nhaircuts, using parameters set by the Basel Committee, and (ii) own -estimate haircuts, using \nAIFIs\u2019 own internal estimates of market price volatility. AIFIs in India shall use only the \nstandard supervisory haircuts for both the exposure as well as the collateral.   \n \n(ii) The Standard Supervisory Haircuts (assuming daily mark -to-market, daily re -\nmargining and a 10 business -day h olding period)70, expressed as percentages, would be as \nfurnished in Table 1 2.  \n \n(iii) The ratings indicated in Table 1 2 represent the ratings assigned by the domestic \nrating agencies. In the case of exposures towa rd debt securities issued by foreign Central \nGovernments and foreign corporates, the haircut may be based on ratings of the \ninternational rating agencies, as indicated in Table 1 3. \n                                            \n70 Holding period will be the time normally required by the AIFI to realise the value of the collateral.   \n67  \n(iv) Sovereign will include the Reserve Bank  and DICGC  which are eligible for z ero per \ncent risk weight . Guarantees issued by  CGT MSE, CRGFTLIH  and individual schemes under \nNCGTC shall also be included under Sovereign.  \n \n(v) AIFIs may apply a zero haircut for eligible collateral where it is a National Savings \nCertificate , Kisan Vikas Patra s, surrender value of insurance policies and AIFIs\u2019 own \ndeposits.  \n \n(vi) The standard supervisory haircut for currency risk where exposure and collateral are \ndenominated in different currencies is eight per cent (also based on a 10 -business day \nholding period an d daily mark -to-market) . \nTable 1 2: Standard Supervisory Haircuts for Sovereign and other securities which \nconstitute Exposure and Collateral  \nSl.

(Since, at present, the repos are allowed only in the case of \nGovernment securities, AIFIs are not likely to have any exposure which will attract the \nprovisions of this c lause. However, this would be relevant, if in future, repos/security lending \ntransactions are permitted in the case of unrated corporate securities).  \n \n(viii) Where the collateral is a basket of assets, the haircut on the basket will be,  \niiHa H\ni\uf0e5\uf03d\n \nwhere a i is the weight of the asset (as measured by the amount/value of the asset in units of \ncurrency) in the basket and Hi , the haircut applicable to that asset.  \n \n(ix) Adjustment  for different holding periods :  \nFor some transactions, depending on the nature and  frequency of the revaluation and \nremargining provisions, different holding periods (other than 10 business -days) are \nappropriate. The framework for collateral haircuts distinguishes between repo -style \ntransactions (i.e. , repo/reverse repos and securities lending/borrowing), \u201cother capital -\nmarket -driven transactions\u201d (i.e. OTC derivatives transactions and margin lending) and \nsecured lending. In capital -market -driven transactions and repo -style transactions, the \ndocumentation contains remargining clauses; in  secured lending transactions, it generally \ndoes not. In view of different holding periods, in the case of these transactions, the minimum \nholding period shall be taken as indicated below:  \n \nTransaction type  Minimum holding  Period  Condition  \nRepo -style tra nsaction  five business days  daily remargining  \nOther capital market \ntransactions  ten business days  daily remargining  \nSecured lending  twenty business days  daily revaluation  \n \nThe haircut for the transactions with other than 10 business -days minimum holding  period, \nas indicated above, will have to be adjusted by scaling up/down the haircut for 10 business \u2013\ndays indicated in the Table  12, as per the formula given in section  10.3.7 (xi) below.  \n \n \n  \n69 (x) Adjustment  for non -daily mark -to-market or remargining : \nIn case a t ransaction has margining frequency different from daily margining  assumed, the \napplicable haircut for the transaction will also need to be adjusted by using the formula given \nin section  10.3.7 (xi) below.  \n \n(xi) Formula  for adjustment for different holding perio ds and / or non -daily mark -to-\nmarket or remargining :  \nAdjustment for the variation in holdi ng period and margining / mark -to-market, as indicated in \nclauses  (ix) and (x) above will be done as per the following formula:  \n   \n10)1 (\n10\uf02d\uf02b\uf03dM RTNHH  \nWhere;  \nH      = haircut  \nH10    = 10-business -day standard supervisory haircut for instrument  \nNR   = actual number of business days between remargining for capital market  \ntransactions or revaluation for secured transactions.  \nTM       = minimum holding period for the t ype of transaction  \n \n10.3.8  Capital Adequacy  Framework for Repo -/Reverse Repo -style transactions.  \n10.3.8.1  The repo -style transactions also attract capital charge for Counterparty credit \nrisk (CCR), in addition to the credit risk and market risk.  The CCR is defined as the  risk of \ndefault by the counterparty in a repo -style transaction, resulting in non -delivery of the \nsecurity lent/pledged/sold or non -repayment of the cash.  \n(i) Treatment in the books of the borrower of funds : \n(a) Where a n AIFI has borrowed funds by selling / lendi ng or posting, as collateral, of \nsecurities, the \u2018Exposure\u2019 will be an off -balance sheet exposure equal to the 'market value' of \nthe securities sold/lent as scaled up after applying appropriate haircut. For the purpose, the \nhaircut as per Table 1 2 would be  used as the basis which should be applied by using the \nformula in section  10.3.7 (xi), to reflect minimum (prescribed) holding period of five business -\ndays for repo -style transactions and the variations, if any, in the frequency of re -margining, \nfrom the daily margining assumed for the standard supervisory haircut. The 'off -balance \nsheet exposure' will be converted into \u2018balance sheet' equivalent by applying a credit \nconversion factor of 100 per cent, as per item 5 in Table 8  (section  8.16).  \n \n(b) The amount o f money received will be treated as collateral for the securities \nlent/sold/pledged. Since the collateral is cash, the haircut for it would be zero.  \n \n(c) The credit equivalent amount arrived at (i) above, net of amount of cash collateral, \nwill attract a risk w eight as applicable to the counterparty.  \n \n(d) As the securities will come back to the books of the borrowing AIFI after the repo \nperiod, it will continue to maintain the capital for the credit risk in the securities in the cases \nwhere the securities involved in repo are held under HTM category, and capital for market \nrisk in cases where the securities are held under AFS/HFT categories. The capital charge for \ncredit risk / specific risk would be determined according to the credit rating of the issuer of \nthe sec urity. In the case of Government securities, the capital charge for credit / specific risk \nwill be 'zero'.  \n \n(ii) Treatment in the books of the AIFI of funds : \n(a) The amount lent will be treated as on -balance sheet/funded exposure on the counter \nparty, collateralis ed by the securities accepted under the repo.  \n  \n70 (b) The exposure, being cash, will receive a zero haircut.  \n \n(c) The collateral will be adjusted downwards/marked down as per applicable haircut.   \n \n(d) The amount of exposure reduced by the adjusted amount of collateral , will receive a \nrisk weight as applicable to the counterparty, as it is an on - balance sheet exposure.  \n \n(e) The lending AIFI will not maintain any capital charge for the security received by it as \ncollateral during the repo period, since such collateral does  not enter its balance sheet but is \nonly held as a bailee.  \n \n10.3.8.2  The formula in section 10.3.6 will be adapted as follows to calculate the \ncapital requirements for transactions with bilateral netting agreements. The bilateral netting \nagreements shall meet the r equirements  set out in Annex 17  (part A) of these guidelines.  \nE* = max {0, [(\u03a3(E) \u2013 \u03a3(C)) + \u03a3 (Es x Hs) +\u03a3 (Efx x Hfx)]}  \nwhere:  \nE* = the exposure value after risk mitigation  \nE = current value of the exposure  \nC = the value of the collateral received  \nEs = absolute value of the net position in a given security  \nHs = hair cut appropriate to Es  \nEfx = absolute value of the net position in a currency different from the \nsettlement currency  \nHfx = haircut appropriate for currency mismatch  \nThe intention here is to obtain a net exposure amount after netting of the exposures and \ncollateral and have an add -on amount reflecting possible price changes for the securities \ninvolved in the transactions and for foreign exchange risk if any. The net long or short \nposition of each security included in the netting agreement will be multiplied b y the \nappropriate haircut. All other rules regarding the calculation of haircuts stated in sections \n10.3.7 equivalently apply for AIFIs using bilateral netting agreements for repo -style \ntransactions.  \n \n10.3.9  Collateralised OTC derivatives transactions  \nThe calcula tion of the counterparty credit risk charge for an individual contract will be as \nfollows:  \ncounterparty charge = [(RC + add -on) \u2013 CA] x r x 9%  \nwhere:  \nRC = the replacement cost,  \nadd-on = the amount for potential future exposure calculated according to section \n8.16.3.3, \nCA = the volatility adjusted collateral amount under the comprehensive approach \nprescribed in section s 10.3.6-10.3.7 or zero if no eligible collateral is applied to the \ntransaction, and  \nr = the risk weight of the counterparty.  \nWhen effective b ilateral netting contracts are in place, RC will be the net replacement cost \nand the add -on will be A Net as calculated accordin g to Annex 17  (part B) a nd section   \n71 8.16.3.43. The haircut for currency risk (Hfx) should be applied when there is a mismatch \nbetween the collateral currency and the settlement currency. Even in the case where there \nare more than two currencies involved in the exposure, collateral and settlement currency, a \nsingle haircut assuming a 10 -business day holdin g period scaled up as necessary \ndepending on the frequency of mark -to-market will be applied.  \n \n10.4 Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques \u2013 On-Balance Sheet Netting  \nOn-balance sheet netting is confined to loans/advances and deposits, where AIFIs have \nlegally enforc eable netting arrangements, involving specific lien with proof of documentation. \nThey may calculate capital requirements on the basis of net credit exposures subject to the \nfollowing conditions:  \nWhere a n AIFI, \n(a) has a well -founded legal basis for concluding that the netting or offsetting  agreement \nis enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction regardless of whether the counterparty is \ninsolvent or bankrupt;  \n(b) is able at any time to determine the loans/advances and deposits with the same \ncounterparty that are sub ject to the netting agreement;  \n(c) monitors and controls the relevant exposures on a net basis ; and \n(d) monitors and controls its roll -off risks . \n \nit may use the net exposure of loans/advances and deposits as the basis for its capital \nadequacy calculation in accor dance with the formula in section  10.3.6. Loans/advances are \ntreated as exposure and deposits as collateral. The haircuts will be zero except when a \ncurrency mismatch exists. All the requirements contained in section s 10.3.6 and 10.6 will \nalso apply.  \n \n10.5 Cred it Risk Mitigation Techniques  - Guarantees  \n10.5.1  Where guarantees are direct, explicit, irrevocable and unconditional AIFIs may take \naccount of such credit protection in calculating capital requirements.   \n \n10.5.2  A range of guarantors are recognised  and a substitution  approach shall be applied . \nThus, o nly guarantees issued by entities with a lower risk weight than the counterparty will \nlead to reduced capital charges since the protected portion of the counterparty exposure is \nassigned the risk weight of the guarantor, whereas the uncovered portion retains the risk \nweight of the underlying counterparty.  \n \n10.5.3  Operational requirements for guarantees  eligible for being treated as a CRM  \n(i) A guarantee (counter -guarantee) shall represent a direct claim on the protection \nprovider and  shall be explicitly referenced to specific exposures or a pool of exposures, so \nthat the extent of the cover is clearly defined and incontrovertible. The guarantee shall be \nirrevocable; there shall be no clause in the contract that would allow the protect ion provider \nunilaterally to cancel the cover or that would increase the effective cost of cover as a result \nof deteriorating credit quality in the guaranteed exposure. The guarantee shall also be \nunconditional; there should be no clause in the guarantee o utside the direct control of the \nAIFI that could prevent the protection provider from being obliged to pay out in a timely \nmanner in the event that the original counterparty fails to make the payment(s) due.  \n \n(ii) All exposures will be risk weighted after takin g into account risk mitigation available in \nthe form of guarantees. When a guaranteed exposure is classified as non -performing, the \nguarantee will cease to be a credit risk mitigant and no adjustment would be permissible on  \n72 account of credit risk mitigatio n in the form of guarantees. The entire outstanding, net of \nspecific provision and net of realisable value of eligible collaterals / credit risk mitigants, will \nattract the appropriate risk weight.  \n \n10.5.4  Additional  operational requirements for guarantees  eligib le for being treated as \na CRM  \nIn addition to the legal certainty requirements in section  10.2 above, in order for a guarantee \nto be recognised, the following conditions shall be satisfied:  \n(i) On the qualifying default/no n-payment of the counterparty, the AIFI is able in a timely \nmanner to pursue the guarantor for any monies outstanding under the documentation \ngoverning the transaction. The guarantor may make one lump sum payment of all monies \nunder such documentation to t he AIFI, or the guarantor may assume the future payment \nobligations of the counterparty covered by the guarantee. The AIFI must have the right to \nreceive any such payments from the guarantor without first having to take legal actions in \norder to pursue the  counterparty for payment.  \n \n(ii) The guarantee is an explicitly documented obligation assumed by the guarantor.  \n \n(iii) Except as noted in the following sentence, the guarantee covers all types of \npayments the underlying obligor is expected to make under the documenta tion governing the \ntransaction, for example notional amount, margin payments etc. Where a guarantee covers \npayment of principal only, interests and other uncovered payments should be treated as an \nunsecured amount  in accordance with section 10.5.7 .  \n \n10.5.5  Range  of Eligible  Guarantors ( Counter -Guarantors)  \nCredit protection given by the following entities will be recognised:  \n(i) Sovereigns, sovereign entities (including BIS, IMF, European Central Bank and \nEuropean Community as well as those MDBs referred to in section  8.5, ECGC and \nCGTMSE , CRGFTLIH ), individual schemes under NCGTC which are backed by explicit \nCentral Government Guarantee,  banks and primary dealers with a lower risk weight than the \ncounterparty .  \n(ii) Other entities that are externally rated except when cred it protection is provided to a \nsecuritisation exposure. This would include credit protection provided by parent, subsidiary \nand affiliate companies when they have a lower risk weight than the obligor.  \n(iii) When credit protection is provided to a securitisation  exposure, other entities that \ncurrently are externally rated BBB - or better and that were externally rated A - or better at the \ntime the credit protection was provided. This would include credit protection provided by \nparent, subsidiary and affiliate compa nies when they have a lower risk weight than the \nobligor.  \n(iv) In case of securitisation transactions, SPEs cannot be recognised as eligible \nguarantors.  \n \n10.5.6  Risk Weights  \n10.5.6.1  The protected portion is assigned the risk weight of the protection provider. \nExposures cover ed by State Government guarantees will attract a risk weight of 20 per cent. \nThe uncovered portion of the exposure is assigned the risk weight of the underlying \ncounterparty.  \nProvided that  any CRM instrument from which CRM benefits like shifting of exposur e/ risk \nweights etc. , are not derived may not be counted as an exposure on the CRM provider.  \n \n  \n73 10.5.6.2  In case of non -fund based credit facilities provided to a person resident \noutside India where CRM benefits are not derived and the exposure is shifted to the non -\nresident person, such exposures to the non -resident person shall attract a minimum risk \nweight of 150%.   \n \n10.5.7  Proportional Cover  \nWhere the amount guaranteed, or against which credit protection is held, is less than the \namount of the exposure, and the secured a nd unsecured portions are of equal seniority, i.e. , \nthe AIFI and the guarantor share losses on a pro -rata basis capital relief will be afforded on a \nproportional basis: i.e. the protected portion of the exposure will receive the treatment \napplicable to eli gible guarantees, with the remainder treated as unsecured.  \n \n10.5.8  Currency Mismatches  \nWhere the credit protection is denominated in a currency different from that in which the \nexposure is denominated \u2013 i.e., there is a currency mismatch \u2013 the amount of the expos ure \ndeemed to be protected will be reduced by the application of a haircut H FX, i.e.,  \n                                 \n  GA    =    G x (1 - HFX) \nWhere;  \n \nG      =    nominal amount of the credit protection  \nHFX   =     haircut appropriate for currency mismat ch between the credit \nprotection and underlying obligation.  \n \nAIFIs using the supervisory haircuts will apply a haircut of eight per cent for currency \nmismatch.  \n \n10.5.9  Sovereign Guarantees and Counter -Guarantees  \nA claim may be covered by a guarantee that is indi rectly counter -guaranteed by a sovereign. \nSuch a claim may be treated as covered by a sovereign guarantee provided that:  \n(i) the sovereign counter -guarantee covers all credit risk elements of the claim;  \n(ii) both the original guarantee and the counter -guarantee me et all operational requirements \nfor guarantees, except that the counter -guarantee need not be direct and explicit to the \noriginal claim; and \n(iii) the cover should be robust and no historical evidence suggests that the coverage of the \ncounter -guarantee is les s than effectively equivalent to that of a direct sovereign \nguarantee.  \n \n10.5.10  ECGC Guaranteed Exposures:  \nUnder the Export Credit insurance on Whole Turnover Basis, the guarantee/insurance cover \ngiven by ECGC for export credit exposures ranges between 50% and 75 % for pre -shipment \ncredit and 50% to 85% in case of post -shipment credit. However, the ECGC\u2019s total liability \non account of default by the exporters is capped by an amount specified as Maximum \nLiability (ML). In this context, it is clarified that risk weig ht (as given in section  8.2.3 of this \nChapter ) applicable to the claims on ECGC should be capped to the ML amount specified in \nthe whole turnover policy of the ECGC. The AIFIs are required to proportionately distribute \nthe ECGC maximum liability amount to all individual export credits that are covered by the \nECGC Policy. For the covered portion of individual export credits, the AIFIs may apply the \nrisk weight applicable to claims on ECGC. For the remaining portion of individual export \ncredit, the AIFIs may apply the risk weight as per the rating of the counter -party. The Risk \nWeighted Assets computation can be mathematically represented as under:   \n74  \nSize of individual export credit exposure i                 Ai \nSize of individual covered export credit exposure i               Bi \nSum of individual covered export credit exposures  \n   \n \nWhere:  \n \n i = 1 to n, if total number of exposures is n  \nMaximum Liability Amount      ML \nRisk Weight of counter party for exposure i                           RW i \nRWA for ECG C Guaranteed Export Credit : \n \n \n \n \n10.6 Maturity Mismatch  \n10.6.1  For the purpose of calculating risk -weighted assets, a maturity mismatch occurs \nwhen the residual maturity of collateral is less than that of the underlying exposure. Where \nthere is a maturity mismatch an d the CRM has an original maturity of less than one year, the \nCRM is not recognised for capital purposes. In other cases where there is a maturity \nmismatch, partial recognition is given to the CRM for regulatory capital purposes as detailed \nbelow in sectio ns 10.6.2 to 10.6.4. In case of loans collateralised by the AIFI\u2019s own deposits, \neven if the tenor of such deposits is less than three months or deposits have maturity \nmismatch vis -\u00e0-vis the tenor of the loan, the provisions of section  10.6.1 regarding \nderecognition of collateral would not be attracted provided an explicit consent of the \ndepositor has been  obtained from the depositor (i.e ., borrower) for adjusting  the maturity \nproceeds of such deposits against the outstanding loan or for renewal of such d eposits till \nthe full repayment of the underlying loan.  \n10.6.2  Definition of Maturity  \nThe maturity of the underlying exposure and the maturity of the collateral should both be \ndefined conservatively. The effective maturity of the underlying should be gauged as th e \nlongest possible remaining time before the counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its obligation, \ntaking into account any applicable grace period. For the collateral, embedded options which \nmay reduce the term of the collateral should be taken into account so that the shortest \npossible effective maturity is used. The maturity relevant here is the residual maturity.  \n \n10.6.3  Risk Weights for Maturity Mismatches  \nAs outlined in section 10 .6.1, collateral with maturity mismatches are only recognised when \ntheir original  maturities are greater than or equal to one year. As a result, the maturity of \ncollateral for exposures with original maturities of less than one year shall be matched to be \nrecognised. In all cases, collateral with maturity mismatches will no longer be r ecognised \nwhen they have a residual maturity of three months or less.  \n \n10.6.4  When there is a maturity mismatch with recognised credit risk mitigants (collateral, \non-balance sheet netting and guarantees) the following adj ustment will be applied:   \n75  \nPa   =   P x ( t - 0.25 ) \u00f7 ( T - 0.25)  \nwhere:  \nPa    =   value of the credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch  \n \nP      =   credit protection (e.g. collateral amount, guarantee amount)   \nadjusted for any haircuts  \n \nt       =    min (T, residual maturity of the credit  protection arrangement) \nexpressed in years  \n \nT      =    min (5, residual maturity of the exposure) expressed in years  \n \n10.7 Treatment of pools of CRM Techniques  \nIn the case where a AIFI has multiple CRM techniques covering a single exposure (e.g. , an \nAIFI has both collateral and guarantee partially covering an exposure), the AIFI will be \nrequired to subdivide the exposure into portions covered by each type of CRM technique \n(e.g., portion covered by collateral, portion covered by guarantee) and the risk -weighted  \nassets of each portion shall be calculated separately. When credit protection provided by a \nsingle protection provider has differing maturities, they shall be subdivided into separate \nprotection as well.  \n11. Capital  Charge for Market Risk   \n11.1 Introduction  \nMarket  risk is defined as the risk of losses in on -balance sheet and off -balance sheet \npositions arising from movements in market prices. The market risk positions subject to \ncapital charge requirement are:  \n(i) The risks pertaining to interest rate related instrumen ts and equities in the trading \nbook; and  \n \n(ii) Foreign exchange risk (including open position in precious metals) throughout the \nAIFI (both banking and trading books).  \n \n11.2 Scope and Coverage of Capital Charge for Market Risks \n11.2.1  These guidelines seek to address the issues involved in computing capital charges \nfor interest rate related instruments in the trading book, equities in the trading book and \nforeign exchange risk (including gold and other precious metals) in both trading and banking \nbooks. Trading book for th e purpose of capital adequacy will include:  \n(i) Securities included under the Held for Trading category  \n(ii) Securities included under the Available for Sale category  \n(iii) Open gold position limits  \n(iv) Open foreign exchange position limits  \n(v) Trading positions in derivatives, and  \n(vi) Derivatives entered into for hedging trading book exposures.  \n \n11.2.2  AIFIs are required to manage the market risks in their books on an ongoing basis and \nensure that the capital requirements for market risks are being maintained on a continuous \nbasis, i.e. , at the close of each business day. AIFIs are also required to maintain strict risk \nmanagement systems to monitor and control intra -day exposures to market risks.  \n \n11.2.3  Capital for market risk would not be relevant for securities, which have already \nmatured and  remain unpaid. These securities will attract capital only for credit risk. On  \n76 completion of 90 days delinquency, these will be treated on par with NPAs for deciding the \nappropriate risk weights for credit risk.  \n \n11.3 Measurement of Capital Charge for Interest Rate Risk \n11.3.1  This section describes the framework for measuring the risk of holding or taking \npositions in debt securities and other interest rate related instruments in the trading book.  \n \n11.3.2  The capital charge for interest rate related instruments would apply t o current market \nvalue of these items in AIFI's trading book. Since it is necessary to  maintain capital for \nmarket risks on an ongoing basis, the trading position should be marked to market on a daily \nbasis . The current market value will be determined as p er extant the Reserve Bank  \nguidelines on valuation of investments.  \n11.3.3  The minimum capital requirement is expressed in terms of two separately calculated \ncharges, (i) \"specific risk\" charge for each security, which is designed to protect against an \nadverse mov ement in the price of an individual security owing to factors related to the \nindividual issuer, both for short (short position is not allowed in India except in derivatives  \nand Central Government Securities ) and long positions, and (ii) \"general market ris k\" charge \ntowards interest rate risk in the portfolio, where long and short positions (which is not \nallowed in India except in derivatives  and Central Government Securities ) in different \nsecurities or instruments can be offset.  \n11.3.4  For the debt securities held  under AFS category, in view of the possible longer \nholding period and attendant higher specific risk, the AIFIs shall hold total capital charge for \nmarket risk equal to greater of (a) or (b) below:  \n(a) Specific risk capital charge, computed notionally for the  AFS securities treating them \nas held under HFT category (as computed according to Table 1 4: Part A  / C / E(i) / F / G, as \napplicable) plus the General Market Risk Capital Charge.  \n \n(b) Alternative total capital charge for the AFS category computed notionally t reating \nthem as held in the banking book (as computed in accordance with Table 1 4: Part B  / D / \nE(ii) / F / H, as applicable)  \n11.3.5  Specific Risk   \n11.3.5.1  The capital charge for specific risk is designed to protect against an adverse \nmovement in the price of an individu al security owing to factors related to the individual \nissuer.

In case, it is not found feasible to compute applicable Common \nEquity Tier 1 and capital conservation buffer on  such notional basis, the specific risk capital \ncharge of 31.5 % or 56.25 %, as per the risk perception of the investing AIFI, should be \napplied uniformly to the investing AIFI\u2019s entire exposure.   \n \n(ii) In case of banks where capital adequacy norms are not applicable at present, the \nmatter of investments in their capital -eligible in struments would not arise for now.

The capital charge is the sum of \nfour components:  \n(i) the net short (short position is not allowed in India except in derivatives  and Central \nGovernment Securities ) or long position in the  whole trading book;  \n(ii) a small proportion of the matched positions in each time -band (the \u201cvertical \ndisallowance\u201d);  \n(iii) a larger proportion of the matched positions across different time -bands (the \u201chorizontal \ndisallowance\u201d), and  \n(iv) a net charge for positions in op tions, where appropriate.  \n \n11.3.6.2  Separate maturity ladders should be used for each currency and capital \ncharges should be calculated for each currency separately and then summed with no \noffsetting between positions of opposite sign.  In the case of those currenc ies in which \nbusiness is insignificant (where the turnover in the respective currency is less than 5 per \ncent of overall foreign exchange turnover), separate calculations for each currency are not \nrequired.  The AIFI may, instead, slot within each appropri ate time -band, the net long or \nshort position for each currency. However, these individual net positions are to be summed \nwithin each time -band, irrespective of whether they are long or short positions, to produce a \ngross position figure. The gross positio ns in each time -band will be subject to the assumed \nchange in yield set out in Table -15 with no further offsets.  \n11.3.6.3  The Base l Committee has suggested two broad methodologies for \ncomputation of capital charge for market risks. One is the standardised method and the \nother is the internal risk management models method.  To start with, AIFIs may adopt the \nstandardised method. Under the standardised method there are two principal methods of \nmeasuring market risk, a \u201cmaturity\u201d method and a \u201cduration\u201d method. As \u201cdu ration\u201d method is \na more accurate method of measuring interest rate risk, it has been decided to adopt \nstandardised duration method to arrive at the capital charge. Accordingly, AIFIs are required \nto measure the general market risk charge by calculating th e price sensitivity (modified \nduration) of each position separately. Under this method, the mechanics are as follows:  \n(i) first calculate the price sensitivity (modified duration) of each instrument;  \n \n(ii) next apply the assumed change in yield to the modified dura tion of each instrument \nbetween 0.6 and 1.0 percentage points depending on the maturity of the instrument \n(see Table 1 5);  Specific risk capital charge (%)  \n Investments in non - common equity capital \ninstruments of financial ent ities other than banks \nreferred to in section  8.6.1(i) \n1 2 \nSpecific risk charge  11.25   \n84 (iii) slot the resulting capital charge measures into a maturity ladder with the fifteen time \nbands as set out in Table 1 5; \n \n(iv) subject long a nd short positions (short position is not allowed in India except in \nderivatives  and Central Government Securities ) in each time band to a 5 per cent vertical \ndisallowance designed to capture basis risk; and  \n \n(v) carry forward the net positions in each time -band for horizontal offsetting subject to \nthe disallowances set out in Table 1 6. \n \nTable \u201315 - Duration Method \u2013 Time Bands and Assumed changes in Yield \n \nTime Bands  Assumed Change \nin Yield   Time Bands  Assumed Change \nin Yield  \nZone 1   Zone 3   \n1 month or less  1.00 3.6 to 4.3 years  0.75 \n1 to 3 months  1.00 4.3 to 5.7 years  0.70 \n3 to 6 months  1.00 5.7 to 7.3 years  0.65 \n6 to 12 months  1.00 7.3 to 9.3 years  0.60 \nZone 2   9.3 to 10.6 years  0.60 \n1.0 to 1.9 years  0.90 10.6 to 12 years  0.60 \n1.9 to 2. 8 years   0.80 12 to 20 years  0.60 \n2.8 to 3.6 years  0.75 over 20 years  0.60 \n \nTable \u201316 - Horizontal Disallowances  \n \nZones  Time band  Within the \nzones  Between \nadjacent zones  Between zones \n1 and 3  \nZone 1  1 month or less  \n40%  \n \n40% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n40%  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n100% 1 to 3 months  \n3 to 6 months  \n6 to 12 months  \nZone 2  1.0 to 1.9 years  \n30% 1.9 to 2.8 years  \n2.8 to 3.6 years  \nZone 3  3.6 to 4.3 years  \n30% 4.3 to 5.7 years  \n5.7 to 7.3 years  \n7.3 to 9.3 years  \n9.3 to 10.6 years  \n10.6 to 12 years  \n12 to 20 years  \nover 20 years  \n \n11.3.6.4  The measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and off \nbalance -sheet instruments in the trading book which react to changes in interest rates, (e.g. , \nforward rate agreements  (FRAs), other forward contracts, bond futures, interest rate and \ncross -currency swaps and forward foreign exchange positions). Options can be treated in a \nvariety of ways as described i n Annex 8. \n \n  \n85 11.4 Measurement of Capital Charge for Equity Risk \n11.4.1  The capital charge for equities would apply on their current market value in AIFI\u2019s \ntrading book . Minimum capital requirement to cover the risk of holding or taking positions in \nequities in the trading book is set out below. This is applied  to all instruments that exhibit \nmarket behaviour similar to equities but not to non -convertible preference shares (which are \ncovered by the interest rate risk requirements described earlier). The instruments covered \ninclude equity shares, whether voting o r non -voting, convertible securities that behave like \nequities, for example: units of mutual funds  (other than debt mutual funds/ETFs mentioned in \nsection 11.3.5) , and commitments to buy or sell equity.  \n \nSpecific and General Market Risk \n11.4.2  Capital charge for  specific risk (akin to credit risk) will be 11.25 per cent or capital \ncharge in accordance with the risk warranted by external rating (or lack of it) of the \ncounterparty, whichever is higher and specific risk is computed on A\u2019FIs\u2019 gross equity \npositions ( i.e., the sum of all long equity positions and of all short equity positions \u2013 short \nequity position is, however, not allowed for AIFIs). In addition, the general market risk charge \nwill also be 9 per cent on the gross equity positions. These capital charg es will also be \napplicable to all trading book exposures, which are exempted from capital market exposure \nceilings for direct investments.  \n \n11.4.3  Specific Risk Capital Charge for investment in Security Receipts will be 13.5 per cent \n(equivalent to 150 per cent risk weight). Since the Security Receipts are by and large illiquid \nand not traded in the secondary market, there will be no General Market Risk Capital Charge \non the m.  \n \n11.4.4  The specific risk charge for AIFI\u2019s  investments in the equity of other banks  / other \nfinancial entities  / non -financial entities  will be as under:  \n \nTable 1 7 \u2013 Part A: Specific risk charge for AIFI\u2019s  investments in the equity of banks  \nheld in HFT and AFS portfolios  \n \nLevel of Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital (CET1) including applicable \ncapital conservation buffer (CCB) \n(%) of the investee bank under \nBasel III/Total Capital for other \nbanks (where applicable)  All Scheduled Banks  \n(Commercial  Banks , \nRegional Rural Banks, \nLocal Area Banks and Co -\noperative Banks)  All Non -scheduled Banks  \n(Commercial  Banks, Local \nArea Banks and Co -\noperative Banks)  (in %)  \nEquity investments in \nbanks referred to in:  Equity investments in banks \nreferred to in:  \nsection \n8.6.1(i)  section \n8.6.1(ii)  section \n8.6.1(i)  section \n8.6.1(ii)  \nFor banks which are under Basel III Capi tal Regulations  \nApplicable Minimum CET1 + \nApplicable CCB and above  11.25  22.5 11.25  27 \nApplicable Minimum CET1 + CCB = \n75% and <100% of applicable CCB  13.5 27 22.5 31.5 \nApplicable Minimum CET1 + CCB = \n50% and <75% of applicable CCB  22.5 31.5 31.5 40.5 \nApplicable Minimum CET1 + CCB = \n0% and <50% of applicable CCB  31.5 40.5 56.25  Full \ndeduction*  \nMinimum CET1 less than applicable 50 Full Full Full  \n86 Level of Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital (CET1) including applicable \ncapital conservation buffer (CCB) \n(%) of the investee bank under \nBasel III/Total Capital for other \nbanks (where applicable)  All Scheduled Banks  \n(Commercial  Banks , \nRegional Rural Banks, \nLocal Area Banks and Co -\noperative Banks)  All Non -scheduled Banks  \n(Commercial  Banks, Local \nArea Banks and Co -\noperative Banks)  (in %)  \nminimum  deduction*  deduction*  deduction*  \nFor banks which are not under Basel III Capital Regulations  \n9 and above  11.25  22.5 11.25  27 \n6 to < 9  13.5 27 22.5 31.5 \n3 to < 6  22.5 31.5 31.5 40.5 \n0 to < 3  31.5 40.5 56.25  Full \ndeduction*  \nNegative  50 Full \ndeduction*  Full \ndeduction*  Full \ndeduction*  \n* Full deduction should be made from Common Equity Tier 1 capital   \n \nTable 1 7 \u2013 Part B: Specific risk charge for AIFI\u2019s investments in the equity of  \nfinancial entities other than banks   \n Equity investments in financial entities other than banks referred to in:  \n section  8.6.1(i)  Section 8 .6.1(ii)  \nSpecific risk charge  (%) 11.25  22.5 \n \nTable 1 7 \u2013 Part C: Specific risk charge for AIFI\u2019s investments in the equity of  \nnon-financial (commercial) entities  \n Equity investments in non -financial entities  \n where a n AIFI does not \nown more than 10% of \nthe equity capital of \ninvestee  companies   which are more than 10% of the equity \ncapital of investee companies or which are \naffiliates of the AIFI (these exposures need \nnot attract general market risk charge)  \nSpecific risk charge  (%) 11.25  100 \n \n11.5 Measurement of Capital Charge for Foreig n Exchange Risk  \nThe AIFI\u2019s net open position in each currency should be calculated by summing:  \n(i) The net spot position (i.e. , all asset items less all liability items, including accrued \ninterest, denominated in the currency in question);  \n(ii) The net forward po sition (i.e. , all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid \nunder forward foreign exchange transactions, including currency futures and the \nprincipal on currency swaps not included in the spot position);  \n(iii) Guarantees (and similar instruments) that are certain to be called and are likely to be \nirrecoverable;  \n(iv) Net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged (at the discretion \nof the reporting AIFI); \n(v) Depending on particular accounting conventions in different countries, any other i tem \nrepresenting a profit or loss in foreign currencies;  \n(vi) The net delta -based equivalent of the total book of foreign currency options  \n \nForeign exchange open positions and gold open positions are at present risk -weighted at \n100 per cent. Thus, capital char ge for market risks in foreign exchange and gold open  \n87 position is 9 per cent. These open positions, limits or actual whichever is higher, would \ncontinue to attract capital charge at 9 per cent. This capital charge is in addition to the capital \ncharge for c redit risk on the on -balance sheet and off -balance sheet items pertaining to \nforeign exchange and gold transactions.  \n \n11.6 Measurement of Capital Charge  for C redit Default Swap (CDS) in the Trading  \nBook  \n11.6.1  General  Market Risk  \nA credit default swap does not normall y create a position for general market risk for either \nthe protection buyer or protection seller. However, the present value of premium payable / \nreceivable is sensitive to changes in the interest rates. In order to measure the interest rate \nrisk in premiu m receivable / payable, the present value of the premium can be treated as a \nnotional position in Government securities of relevant maturity. These positions will attract \nappropriate capital charge for general market risk. The protection buyer / seller wil l treat the \npresent value of the premium payable / receivable equivalent to a short / long notional \nposition in Government securities of relevant maturity.  \n \n11.6.2  Specific  Risk for Exposure to Reference Entity  \n11.6.2.1  A CDS creates a notional long / short position for s pecific risk in the reference \nasset / obligation for protection seller / protection buyer. For calculating specific risk capital \ncharge, the notional amount of the CDS and its maturity should be used. The specific risk \ncapital charge for CDS positions will  be as per Tables  below.  \nTable 18: Specific Risk Capital Charges for bought and  \nsold CDS positions in the Trading Book: Exposures to entities  \nother than Commercial Real Estate Companies  \nUpto 90 days  After 90 days  \nRatings by \nthe ECAI* Residual Maturity of the \ninstrument  Capital \ncharge  Ratings by \nthe ECAI* Capital \ncharge  \nAAA to BBB  6 months or less  0.28 %  AAA 1.8 %  \nGreater than 6 months and up \nto and including 24 months  1.14%  AA 2.7%  \nExceeding 24 months  1.80%  A 4.5%  \nBBB 9.0%  \nBB and below  All maturities  13.5%  BB and \nbelow  13.5%  \nUnrated  \n(if permitted)  All maturities  9.0%  Unrated  \n(if permitted)  9.0%  \n* These ratings indicate the ratings a ssigned by Indian rating agencies / ECAIs or foreign \nrating agencies.

This would be the case when the two legs consist of completely identical \nCDS . In these cases, no specific risk capital requirement applies to both sides of the CDS \npositions.  \n \n(ii) AIFIs may offset 80 per cent of the specific risk capital charges when the value of two \nlegs (i.e. , long and short) always moves in the opposite direction but not broadly to the same \nextent. Thi s would be the case when a long cash position is hedged by a credit default swap \nand there is an exact match in terms of the reference / deliverable obligation, and the \nmaturity of both the reference / deliverable obligation and the CDS. In addition, key f eatures \nof the CDS (e.g. , credit event definitions, settlement mechanisms) should not cause the price \nmovement of the CDS to materially deviate from the price movements of the cash position. \nTo the extent that the transaction transfers risk, an 80% specifi c risk offset will be applied to \nthe side of the transaction with the higher capital charge, while the specific risk requirement \non the other side will be zero.  \n \n(iii) AIFIs may offset partially the specific risk capital charges when the value of the two \nlegs (i.e. long and short) usually moves in the opposite direction. This would be the case in \nthe following situations:  \n \n(a) The position is captured in section 11 .6.2.2(ii) but there is an asset mismatch \nbetween the cash position and the CDS. However, the underlying asset is included in \nthe (reference / deliverable) obligations in the CDS documentation and meets the \nrequirements in section 8 .18.3(i) above.  \n \n(b) The position is captured in section 11 .6.2.2(ii) but there is maturity mismatch \nbetween credit protection and the underlying asset. However, the underlying asset is \nincluded in the (reference/ deliverable) obligations in the CDS documenta tion. \n \n(c) In each of the cases in clauses  (a) and (b) above, rather than applying \nspecific risk capital requirements on each side of the transaction (i.e. , the credit \nprotection and the underlying asset), only higher of the two capital requirements will \napply.  \n \n11.6.2.3  Specific Risk Charge in CDS Positions which are not meant for Hedging  \nIn cases not captured in section  11.6.2.2, a specific risk capital charge will be assessed \nagainst both sides of the positions.  \n                                            \n73 Please refer to paragraph 6.2 of Annex 6  of these guidelines for details .  \n89  \n11.6.3  Capital Charge for Counterparty Credit Risk  \nThe cr edit exposure for the purpose of counterparty credit risk on account of CDS \ntransactions in the Trading Book will be calculated according to the Current Exposure \nMethod74. \n \n11.6.3.1  Protection  Seller  \nA protection seller will have exposure to the protection buyer onl y if the fee/premia is \noutstanding. In such cases, the counterparty credit risk charge for all single name long CDS \npositions in the Trading Book will be calculated as the sum of the current marked -to-market \nvalue, if positive (zero, if marked -to-market va lue is negative) and the potential future \nexposure add -on factors based on table given below. However, for protection seller where \nthe CDS positions are outside netting and margin agreements, the add -on will be capped to \nthe amount of unpaid premia.  AIFIs  have the option to remove such CDS positions from their \nlegal netting sets and treat them as individual unmargined transactions in order to apply the \ncap. \n \nTable 2 0: Add-on Factors for Protection Sellers  \n(As % of Notional Principal of CDS)  \nType of Refere nce Obligation  Add-on Factor  \nObligations rated BBB - and above  10% \nBelow BBB - and unrated  20% \n \n11.6.3.2  Protection Buyer  \nA CDS contract creates a counterparty exposure on the protection seller on account of the \ncredit event payment. The counterparty credit risk c harge for all short CDS positions in the \nTrading Book will be calculated as the sum of the current marked -to-market value, if positive \n(zero, if marked -to-market value is negative) and the potential future exposure add -on \nfactors based on table given below : \n \nTable 2 1: Add-on Factors for Protection Buyers  \n(As % of Notional Principal of CDS)  \nType of Reference Obligation  Add-on Factor  \nObligations rated BBB - and above  10% \nBelow BBB - and unrated  20% \n                                            \n74 A CDS contract, which is required to be marked -to-market, creates bilateral exposure for the parties \nto the contract.  The mark -to-market value of a CDS contract is the difference between the default -\nadjusted present value of protection payment (called \u201cprotection leg\u201d / \u201ccredit leg\u201d) and the present \nvalue of premium payable called (\u201cpremium leg\u201d). If the value of credit leg is less than the value of the \npremium leg, then the marked -to-market value for the protection seller in positive. Therefore, the \nprotection seller will have exposure to the counterparty (protection buyer) if the value of premium leg \nis more than the va lue of credit leg. In case, no premium is outstanding, the value of premium leg will \nbe zero and the mark -to-market value of the CDS contract will always be negative for the protection \nseller and therefore, protection seller will not have any exposure to t he protection buyer. In no case, \nthe protection seller\u2019s exposure on protection buyer can exceed the amount of the premium unpaid. \nFor the purpose of capital adequacy as well as exposure norms, the measure of counterparty \nexposures in case of CDS transacti on held in Trading Book is the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) \nwhich is measured and recognised as per Current Exposure Method.   \n  \n90  \n11.6.3.3  Capital Charge for Counterparty Risk for Collateralised T ransactions in CDS  \nAs mentioned in paragraph 3.3  of the circular IDMD.PCD.No.10/14.03.04/2012 -13 dated \nJanuary 7, 2013 , collaterals and margins would be maintained by the individual market \nparticipants. The counterparty exposure for CDS traded in the OTC market will be calculated \nas per the Current Exposure Method. Under this method, the calculation of the counterparty \ncredit risk charge for an in dividual contract, taking into account the collateral, will be as \nfollows:  \n \nCounterparty risk capital charge = [(RC + add -on) \u2013 CA] x r x 9%  \nWhere;  \n \nRC = the replacement cost,  \n \nadd-on = the amount for potential future exposure calculated according to section  \n11.6.3 above.  \n \nCA = the volatility adjusted amount of eligible collateral under the comprehensive \napproach prescribed in section  10.3 on \"Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques - \nCollateralised Transactions\" of these guidelines , or zero if no eligible collateral is \napplied to the transaction , and  \n \nr = the risk weight of the counterparty.  \n \n11.6.4  Treatment of Exposures below Materiality Thresholds of CDS  \nMateriality thresholds on payments below which no payment is made in the event of loss are \nequivalent to retained first loss positions and should be  assigned risk weight of 1250 per \ncent for capital adequacy purpose by the protection buyer.  \n \n11.7 Aggregation  of the capital charge for Market Risks \nAs explained earlier capital charges for specific risk and general market risk are to be \ncomputed separately be fore aggregation. For computing the total capital charge and Risk \nWeighted Assets  for market risks, the calculations may be plotted in the following table : \n \nProforma  \n        (\u20b9. in crore)  \nRisk Category  Capital charge  Risk Weighted \nAssets (RWA)  \nI.

Total capital charge  and RWA for \nmarket risks  (I+II+III)     \n91  \n11.8 Treatment for Illiquid  Positions  \n11.8.1  Prudent  Valuation Guidance  \n(i) This section provides AIFIs with guidance on prudent valuation for positions that are \naccounted for at fair value . This guidance would be applicable to all positions enumerated in \nsection  11.2.1 above. It is especially important for positions without actua l market prices or \nobservable inputs to valuation, as well as less liquid positions which raise supervisory \nconcerns about prudent valuation. The valuation guidance set forth below is not intended to \nrequire AIFIs to change valuation procedures for financi al reporting purposes.  \n \n(ii) A framework for prudent valuation practices should at a minimum include the \nfollowing:  \n \n11.8.1.1  Systems and Controls : \nAIFIs shall establish and maintain adequate systems and controls sufficient to give \nmanagement and supervisors the confid ence that their valuation estimates are prudent and \nreliable. These systems shall be integrated with other risk management systems within the \norganisation (such as credit analysis). Such systems shall include:  \n(i) Documented policies and procedures for the pro cess of valuation. This includes \nclearly defined responsibilities of the various areas involved in the determination of the \nvaluation, sources of market information and review of their appropriateness, guidelines for \nthe use of unobservable inputs reflecti ng the AIFI\u2019s assumptions of what market participants \nwould use in pricing the position, frequency of independent valuation, timing of closing \nprices, procedures for adjusting valuations, end of the month and ad -hoc verification \nprocedures; and  \n \n(ii) Clear and independent (i .e., independent of front office) reporting lines for the \ndepartment accountable for the valuation process.  \n \n11.8.1.2  Valuation Methodologies : \n(i) Marking to Market  \n(a) Marking -to-market is at least the daily valuation of positions at readily available close  \nout prices in orderly transactions that are sourced independently. Examples of readily \navailable close out prices include exchange prices, screen prices, or quotes from several \nindependent reputable brokers.  \n \n(b) AIFIs shall mark -to-market as much as possible . The more prudent side of bid/offer \nshould be used unless the institution is a significant market maker in a particular position \ntype and it can close out at mid -market. AIFIs should maximise the use of relevant \nobservable inputs and minimise the use of u nobservable inputs when estimating fair value \nusing a valuation technique. However, observable inputs or transactions may not be \nrelevant, such as in a forced liquidation or distressed sale, or transactions may not be \nobservable, such as when markets are i nactive. In such cases, the observable data should \nbe considered, but may not be determinative.  \n \n(ii) Marking to Model \n(a) Marking -to model is defined as any valuation which has to be benchmarked, \nextrapolated or otherwise calculated from a market input. Where mark ing-to-market is not \npossible, AIFIs should follow Reserve Bank\u2019s extant  guidelines on valuation of investments  \nprescribed in Chapter V of these Directions . For investment and derivative positions other \nthan those covered in the Reserve Bank\u2019s  instructions , the valuation model used by AIFIs  \n92 shall be demonstrated to be prudent. When marking to valuation model other than that \nprescribed in the Reserve Bank  / FIMMDA guidelines, an extra degree of conservatism is \nappropriate. the Reserve Bank  will consider the following in assessing whether a mark -to-\nmodel valuation is prudent:  \n\uf0b7 Senior management should be aware of the elements of the trading book or of \nother fair -valued positions which are subject to mark to model and should understand  \nthe materiality of the unc ertainty this creates in the reporting of the risk/performance \nof the business.  \n \n\uf0b7 Market inputs should be sourced, to the extent possible, in line with market \nprices (as discussed above). The appropriateness of the market inputs for the \nparticular position being valued should be reviewed regularly.  \n \n\uf0b7 Where available, generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular \nproducts should be used as far as possible.  \n \n\uf0b7 Where the model is developed by the institution itself, it should be based on \nappropriate as sumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably \nqualified parties independent of the development process. The model should be \ndeveloped or approved independently of the front office. It should be independently \ntested. This includes validatin g the mathematics, the assumptions and the software \nimplementation.  \n \n\uf0b7 There should be formal change control procedures in place and a secure copy of \nthe model should be held and periodically used to check valuations.  \n \n\uf0b7 Risk management function/ department  should be aware of the weaknesses of \nthe models used and how best to reflect those in the valuation output.  \n \n\uf0b7 The model should be subject to periodic review to determine the accuracy of its \nperformance (e .g., assessing continued appropriateness of the assumpt ions, analysis \nof P&L versus risk factors, comparison of actual close out values to model outputs).  \n \n\uf0b7 Valuation adjustments should be made as appropriate, for example, to cover the \nuncertainty of the model valuation (see also valuation adjustments in sectio ns \n11.8.1.2 ( iv) and 11.8.2.1 to 11.8.2.4.)  \n \n(iii) Independent Price Verification  \n(a) Independent price verification is distinct from daily mark -to-market. It is the process \nby which market prices or model inputs are regularly verified for accuracy. While daily \nmarking-to-market may be performed by dealers, verification of market prices or model \ninputs should be performed by a unit independent of the dealing room, at least monthly (or, \ndepending on the nature of the market/trading activity, more frequently). It need  not be \nperformed as frequently as daily mark -to-market, since the objective, i.e ., independent, \nmarking of positions should reveal any error or bias in pricing, which should result in the \nelimination of inaccurate daily marks.  \n \n(b) Independent price verificat ion entails a higher standard of accuracy in that the market \nprices  or model inputs are used to determine profit and loss figures, whereas daily mark et \nprice s are used primarily for management reporting in between reporting dates. For \nindependent price ver ification, where pricing sources are more subjective, e .g., only one \navailable broker quote, prudent measures such as valuation adjustments may be \nappropriate.  \n  \n93 (iv) Valuation Adjustments   \n(a) As part of their procedures for marking to market, AIFIs shall establish  and maintain \nprocedures for considering valuation adjustments. the Reserve Bank  would particularly \nexpect AIFIs using third -party valuations to consider whether valuation adjustments are \nnecessary. Such considerations are also necessary when marking to mo del. \n \n(b) At a minimum, AIFIs should consider the following valuation adjustments while \nvaluing their derivatives portfolios:  \n\uf0b7 incurred CVA losses75, \n\uf0b7 closeout costs,  \n\uf0b7 operational risks,  \n\uf0b7 early termination, investing and funding costs, and  \n\uf0b7 future administrative cos ts and,  \n\uf0b7 where appropriate, model risk.  \n \nAIFIs may follow any recognised method/model to compute the above adjustments except \nprovisions against incurred CVA losses. However, AIFIs may use the following formula to \ncalculate incurred CVA loss on derivatives transactions:  \n       \n          ICVAL t = Max [0,{(EE t *RP t) - (EE 0 *RP 0)}] \n \nWhere ;  \n      \nICVAL t = Cumulative Incurred CVA loss at time \u2018t\u2019.   \n \nEE t       = Value of counterparty exposure projected after one year from \u2018t\u2019 and \ndiscounted back to \u2018t\u2019 using CEM  and a risk free discount rate for one year  \nEE 0  =  Counterparty exposure estimated at time \u20180\u2019 using CEM  \n \nRP t   =  Credit spread of the counterparty as reflected in the CDS or bond prices.  \n \nIn cases where market  based credit spreads are not available, r isk premium \napplicable to the counterparty according to its credit grade as per the internal credit \nrating system of the AIFI used for pricing/loan approval purposes at time \u2018t\u2019 may be \nused.  \n \nRP 0   = Credit spread of the counterparty as reflected in the CD S or bond prices.  \n \nIn cases where market based credit spreads are not available, risk premium \napplicable to the counterparty according to its credit grade as per the internal credit \nrating system of the AIFI used for pricing  / loan approval purposes at ti me \u20180\u2019 i.e. , the \ndate of the transaction.  \n \nNote: Some of other terms used above are explained below:  \n \nClose -out costs  \nClose -out costs adjustment factors in the cost of eliminating the market risk of the portfolio.  \n \n                                            \n75 Provisions against incurred CVA losses are akin to specific provisions required on impaired assets \nand depreciation in case  of investments held in the trading book. These provisions will be in addition \nto the general provisions @ 0.4% required on the positive MTM values. The provisions against \nincurred CVA losses may be netted off from the exposure value while calculating capi tal charge for \ndefault risk under the Current Exposure Method as required in terms of section  8.16.3.3 (ii).          \n94 Investing and Funding costs  \nThe \"investin g and funding costs adjustment\" relating to the cost of funding and investing \ncash flow mismatches at rates different from the rate which models typically assume.  \n \n \nAdministrative costs adjustment  \nAdministrative costs adjustment relates to the costs that w ill be incurred to administer the \nportfolio . \n \n11.8.2  Adjustment  to the current valuation of less  liquid positions for regulatory \ncapital purposes : \n11.8.2.1  AIFIs shall establish and maintain procedures for judging the necessity of and \ncalculating an adjustment to the curr ent valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory \ncapital purposes. This adjustment may be in addition to any changes to the value of the \nposition required for financial reporting purposes and should be designed to reflect the \nilliquidity of the positi on. An adjustment to a position\u2019s valuation to reflect current illiquidity \nshould be considered whether the position is marked to market using market prices or \nobservable inputs, third -party valuations or marked to model.  \n \n11.8.2.2  Bearing in mind that the assumpti ons made about liquidity in the market risk \ncapital charge may not be consistent with the AIFI\u2019s ability to sell or hedge out less liquid \npositions where appropriate, AIFIs shall take an adjustment to the current valuation of these \npositions, and review th eir continued appropriateness on an on -going basis. Reduced \nliquidity may have arisen from market events. Additionally, close -out prices for concentrated \npositions and/or stale positions should be considered in establishing the adjustment. The \nReserve Bank  has not prescribed any particular methodology for calculating the amount of \nvaluation adjustment on account of illiquid positions. AIFIs shall consider all relevant factors \nwhen determining the appropriateness of the adjustment for less liquid positions. These \nfactors may include, but are not limited to, the amount of time it would take to hedge out the \nposition/risks within the position, the average volatility of bid/offer spreads, the availability of \nindependent market quotes (number and identity of mark et makers), the average and \nvolatility of trading volumes (including trading volumes during periods of market stress), \nmarket concentrations, the ag eing of positions, the extent to which valuation relies on \nmarking -to-model, and the impact of other model r isks not included in section  11.8.2.2. The \nvaluation adjustment on account of illiquidity should be considered irrespective of whether \nthe guidelines issued by FIMMDA  have taken into account the illiquidity premium or not, \nwhile fixing YTM/spreads for the purpose of valuation.  \n \n11.8.2.3  For complex products including, but not limited to, securitisation exposures, AIFIs \nshall explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments to reflect two forms of model risk:  \n(i) the model risk associated with using a possibly incor rect valuation methodology; and  \n  \n(ii) the risk associated with using unobservable (and possibly incorrect) calibration \nparameters in the valuation model.  \n \n11.8.2.4  The adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions made under section  \n11.8.2.2 will not be debited to P&L Account, but will be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital while computing CRAR of the AIFI. The adjustment may exceed those valuation \nadjustments made under financial reporting/accounting standards and section s 11.8.1.2 (i v). \n \n11.8.2.5  In calcu lating the eligible capital for market risk, it will be necessary first to \ncalculate the AIFIs\u2019 minimum capital requirement for credit and operational risk and only  \n95 afterwards its market risk requirement to establish how much component of capital is \navaila ble to support market risk . \n \n12. Capital Charge for Operational Risk  \n12.1 Definition  of Operational Risk \nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal \nprocesses, people and systems or from external events. This defini tion includes legal risk, \nbut excludes strategic and reputational risk. Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, \nexposure to fines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting from supervisory actions, as well \nas private settlements.  \n \n12.2 The Measurement Metho dologies  \n12.2.1   There are  three methods for calculating operational risk capital charges in a \ncontinuum of increasing sophistication and risk sensitivity: (i) the Basic Indicator Approach \n(BIA); (ii) the Standardised Approach (TSA); and (iii) Advanced Measuremen t Approaches \n(AMA).  \n \n12.2.2  The AIFIs shall adopt the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for calculating the \nOperational Risk capital charge.  \n \n12.2.3  The Reserve Bank will review the capital requirement produced by the Basic \nIndicator Approach for general credibility and in  the event that credibility is lacking, \nappropriate supervisory action under Pillar 2 will be considered.  \n \n12.3 The Basic Indicator Approach  \n12.3.1  Under the Basic Indicator Approach, AIFIs  shall hold capital for operational risk equal \nto the average over the previous  three years of a fixed percentage (denoted as alpha) of \npositive annual gross income. Figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative \nor zero should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the \naverage. If negativ e gross income distorts a n AIFI\u2019s  Pillar 1 capital charge, the Reserve \nBank will consider appropriate supervisory action under Pillar 2. The charge may be \nexpressed as follows:  \nKBIA = [  \u2211 (GI 1\u2026n x \u03b1 \n)]/n \n       Where:  \nKBIA =  the capital charge under the Basic Indicator Approach  \nGI      =  annual gross income, where positive, over the previous three years  \nn        =   number of the previous three years for which gross income is \npositive  \n\u03b1        =  15 per cent, which is set by the BCBS , relating the industry wide \nlevel of required capital to the industry wide level of the indicator.  \n \n12.3.2  Gross income is defined as \u201cNet interest income\u201d plus \u201cnet non -interest income\u201d. It is \nintended that thi s measure should:  \n(i) be gross of any provisions (e.g. , for unpaid interest) and write -offs made during the \nyear;  \n(ii) be gross of operating expenses, including fees paid to outsourcing service providers, \nin addition to fees paid for services that are outsourced, fees received by AIFIs that \nprovide outsourcing services shall be included in the definition of gross income;   \n(iii) exclude reversal during the year in respect of provisions and write -offs made during  \n96 the previous year(s);  \n(iv) exclude income recognised from the dis posal of items of movable and immovable \nproperty;  \n(v) exclude realised profits/losses from the sale of securities in the \u201cheld to maturity\u201d \ncategory ;  \n(vi) exclude income from legal settlements in favour of the AIFI; \n(vii) exclude other extraordinary or irregular items of income and expenditure; and  \n(viii) exclude income derived from insurance activities (i.e. income derived by writing \ninsurance policies) and insurance claims in favour of the AIFI.  \n \n \n12.3.3  AIFIs  are advised to compute capital charge for operational risk under the Ba sic \nIndicator Approach as follows:  \n(i) Average of [Gross Income * alpha  (\u03b1)] for each of the last three financial years, \nexcluding years of negative or zero gross income  as mentioned in section 12.3.1 \nabove.  \n(ii) Gross income = Net profit (+) Provisions & contingen cies ( +) operating expenses \n(Schedule 16) ( \u2013) items (iii) to (viii) of section  12.3.2. \n(iii) Alpha (\u03b1) = 15 per cent  \n \n12.3.4  As a point of entry for capital calculation, no specific criteria for use of the Basic \nIndicator Approach are set out in the se guidelines. Never theless, AIFIs  using this approach \nare encouraged to comply with the Basel Committee\u2019s guidance on \u2018Revisions to Principles \nfor the Sound Management of Operational Ris k\u2019 dated  March 31, 2021  and the  risk \nmanagement g uidelines  prescribed  for AIFIs.  \n \n12.3.5  Once th e AIFI has calculated the capital charge for operational risk under the Basic \nIndicator Approach , it has to multiply this with 12.5 and arrive at the notional risk weighted \nasset (RWA) for operational risk.  \n  \n97 Part B: Supervisory Review and Evaluation Proc ess (SREP)  \n \n13. Introduction to the SREP under Pillar 2  \n13.1 The Capital Adequacy Framework rests on t hree components or three Pillars. Pillar 1 \nis the Minimum Capital Ratio while Pillar 2 and Pillar 3 are the Supervisory Review Process \n(SRP) and Market Discipline , respectively.  The guidelines in regard to the SRP and the \nICAAP are furnished in this Section . An illustrative outline of the format of the ICAAP \ndocument, to be subm itted to the Reserve Bank , by AIFIs, is furnished at Annex 1 3.  \n \n13.2 The objective of the SRP is to ensure that AIFIs have adequate capital to support all \nthe risks in their business as also to encourage them to develop and use better risk \nmanagement techniques for monitoring and managing their risks. This in turn wou ld require \na well -defined internal assessment process within AIFIs through which they assure the \nReserve Bank  that adequate capital is indeed  held towards the various risks to which they \nare exposed  to. The process of assurance could also involve an active  dialogue between the \nAIFI and the Reserve Bank  so that, when warranted, appropriate intervention could be made \nto either reduce the risk exposure of the AIFI or augment / restore its capital. Thus, ICAAP is \nan important component of the SRP.  \n \n13.3 The main as pects to be addressed under the SRP, and therefore, under the ICAAP, \nwould include:  \n(i) the risks that are not fully captured by the minimum capital ratio prescribed  under \nPillar 1;  \n(ii) the risks that are not at all taken into account by the Pillar 1; and  \n(iii) the fac tors external to the AIFI.  \n \nSince the capital adequacy ratio prescribed by the Reserve Bank  under the Pillar 1 of the \nFramework is only the regulatory minimum  level, addressing only the three specified risks \n(viz., credit, market and operational risks), h olding additional capital might be necessary for \nAIFIs, on account of both \u2013 the possibility of some under -estimation of risks under the Pillar \n1 and the actual risk exposure of a n AIFI vis-\u00e0-vis the quality of its risk management \narchitecture. Illustrativ ely, some of the risks that the AIFIs are generally exposed to but \nwhich are not captured or not fully captured in the regulatory CRAR would include:  \n(i) Interest rate risk in the banking book;  \n(ii) Credit concentration risk;  \n(iii) Liquidity risk;  \n(iv) Settlement risk;  \n(v) Reputational risk;  \n(vi) Strategic risk;  \n(vii) Risk of under -estimation of credit risk under the Standardised  approach;  \n(viii) Model risk i.e., the risk of under -estimation of credit risk under the IRB approaches;  \n(ix) Risk of weakness in the credit -risk mitigants;  \n(x) Residual r isk of securitisation ;  \n(xi) Cyber security/IT infrastructure risk;  \n(xii) Human capital risk;  \n(xiii) Group risk;  \n(xiv) Outsourcing / vendor management risk;  \n(xv) Collateral risk  \n \nThe quantification of currency induced credit risk will form a part of AIFIs\u2019 Internal Capital \nAdequacy As sessment Programme (ICAAP) and AIFIs are expected to address this risk in a  \n98 comprehensive manner. The ICAAP should measure the extent of currency induced credit \nrisk76 the AIFI is exposed to and also concentration of such exposures. AIFIs may also like to \nperform stress tests under various extreme but plausible exchange rate scenarios under \nICAAP. Outcome of ICAAP may lead a n AIFI to take appropriate risk management actions \nlike risk reduction, maintenance of more capital or provision, etc.  \n \nIt is, therefore , only appropriate that the AIFIs make their own assessment of their various \nrisk exposures, through a well -defined internal process, and maintain an adequate capital \ncushion for such risks.  \n \n13.4 It is recognised that there is no one single approach for condu cting the ICAAP and \nthe market consensus in regard to the best practice for undertaking ICAAP is yet to emerge. \nThe methodologies and techniques are still evolving particularly in regard to measurement of \nnon-quantifiable risks, such as reputational and st rategic risks. These guidelines, therefore, \nseek to provide only broad principles to be followed by AIFIs in developing their ICAAP.  \n \n13.5 AIFIs are advised to develop and put in place, with the approval of their Boards, an \nICAAP commensurate with their size, level of complexity, risk profile and scope of \noperations.  The ICAAP shall be in addition to an AIFI\u2019s calculation of regulatory capital \nrequirements under Pillar 1.  \n \n13.6 The ICAAP document should, inter alia , include the capital adequacy assessment \nand projec tions of capital requirement for the ensuing year, along with the plans and \nstrategies for meeting the capital requirement. An illustrative outline of a format of the ICAAP \ndocument is furnish ed at Annex 13 , for guidance of the  AIFIs though the ICAAP documents \nof the AIFIs could vary in length and format, in tune with their size, level of complexity, risk \nprofile and scope of operations.  \n \n14. Need for Improved Risk Management  \n14.1 While financial institutions have faced difficulties ove r the years for a multitude of \nreasons, the major causes of serious banking problems continue to be lax credit standards \nfor borrowers and counterparties, poor portfolio risk management, and a lack of attention to \nchanges in economic or other circumstances  that can lead to a deterioration in the credit \nstanding of a n AIFI's counterparties.  \n \n14.2 The financial market crisis of 2007 -08 has underscored the critical importance of \neffective credit risk management to the long -term success of any financial institution  and as \na key component of  financial stability. It has provided a stark reminder of the need for AIFIs \nto effectively identify, measure, monitor and control credit risk, as well as to understand how \ncredit risk interacts with other types of risk (including  market, liquidity and reputational risk). \nThe essential elements of a comprehensive credit risk management programme include (i) \nestablishing an appropriate credit risk environment; (ii) operating under a sound credit \ngranting process; (iii) maintaining a n appropriate credit administration, measurement and \nmonitoring process; and (iv) ensuring adequate controls over credit risk as elaborated in  the \nrisk management g uidelines  prescribed  for AIFIs . \n \n14.3 The Global Financial C risis has emphasised the importance o f effective capital \nplanning and long -term capital maintenance. A n AIFI\u2019s ability to withstand uncertain market \nconditions is bolstered by maintaining a strong capital position that accounts for potential \n                                            \n76 Please refer to circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.85/21.06.200/2013 -14 and DBOD.No.BP.BC.116/ \n21.06.200/2013 -14 dated January 15, 2014 and June 3, 2 014 addressed to banks , respectively .  \n99 changes in the AIFI\u2019s strategy and volatility in ma rket conditions over time. AIFIs should \nfocus on effective and efficient capital planning, as well as long -term capital maintenance. \nAn effective capital planning process requires an AIFI to assess both the risks to which it is \nexposed and the risk managem ent processes in place to manage and mitigate those risks; \nevaluate its capital adequacy relative to its risks; and consider the potential impact on \nearnings and capital from economic downturns. An AIFI\u2019s capital planning process should \nincorporate rigorou s, forward  looking stress testing, as discussed below in section  15.10. \n15. Guidelines  for the SREP of the Reserve Bank  and the ICAAP of AIFIs \n15.1 Background  \n15.1.1  The Basel capital adequacy framework rests on the following three mutually - \nreinforcing pillars:  \nPillar 1 : Minimum Capital Requirements - which prescribes a risk -sensitive calculation of \ncapital requirements that, for the first time, explicitly includes operational risk in addition to \nmarket and credit risk.  \n \nPillar 2:  Supervisory Review Process (SRP) - which  envisages the establishment of suitable \nrisk management systems in AIFIs and their review by the supervisory authority.  \n \nPillar 3:  Market Discipline - which seeks to achieve increased transparency through \nexpanded disclosure requirements for AIFIs. \n  \n15.1.2  Following  are the  four key principles  in regard to the SRP envisaged under Pillar 2:  \nPrinciple 1 : AIFIs should have a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in \nrelation to their risk profile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels.  \n \nPrinciple 2 : Supervisors should review and evaluate  AIFIs\u2019 internal capital adequacy \nassessments and strategies, as well as their ability to monitor and ensure their compliance \nwith the regulatory capital ratios. Supervisors should take appropriate supervi sory action if \nthey are not satisfied with the result of this process.   \n \nPrinciple 3 : Supervisors should expect AIFIs to operate above the minimum regulatory \ncapital ratios and should have the ability to require AIFIs to hold capital in excess of the \nminim um.  \n \nPrinciple 4 : Supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from \nfalling below the minimum levels required to support the risk characteristics of a particular \nAIFI and should require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or restored.  \n \n15.1.3  It would be seen that the principles 1 and 3 relate to the supervisory expectations \nfrom AIFIs while the principles 2 and 4 deal with the role of the supervisors under Pillar 2. \nPillar 2 (Supervisory Review Process - SRP) requires AIFIs to implement an internal \nprocess, called the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), for assessing \ntheir capital adequacy in relation to their risk profiles as well as a strategy for maintaining \ntheir capital levels. Pillar 2 also requi res the supervisory authorities to subject all AIFIs to an \nevaluation process, hereafter called Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), \nand to initiate such supervisory measures on that basis, as might be considered necessary. \nAn analysis of the foregoing principles indicates that the following broad responsibilities have \nbeen cast on AIFIs and the supervisors:  \nAIFIs\u2019 responsibilities:  \n(i) AIFIs should have in place a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in \nrelation to their risk prof ile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels (Principle 1)  \n(ii) AIFIs should operate above the minimum regulatory capital ratios (Principle 3)   \n100  \nSupervisors\u2019 responsibilities  \n(i) Supervisors should review and evaluate a n AIFI\u2019s ICAAP. (Principle 2)  \n(ii) Superv isors should take appropriate action if they are not satisfied with the results of \nthis process. (Principle 2)  \n(iii) Supervisors should review and evaluate a n AIFI\u2019s compliance with the regulatory capital \nratios. (Principle 2)  \n(iv) Supervisors should have the ability  to require AIFIs to hold capital in excess of the \nminimum. (Principle 3)  \n(v) Supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from falling \nbelow the minimum levels. (Principle 4)  \n(vi) Supervisors should require rapid remedial action if cap ital is not maintained or restored. \n(Principle 4)  \n \n15.1.4  Thus, the ICAAP and SREP are the two important components of Pillar 2 and could \nbe broadly defined as follows:   \n(i) The ICAAP comprises an AIFI\u2019s procedures and measures designed to ensure the \nfollowing:  \n(a) An appropriate identification and measurement of risks;  \n(b) An appropriate level of internal capital in relation to the AIFI\u2019s risk profile; and  \n(c) Application and further development of suitable risk management systems . \n \n(ii) The SREP consists of a review and evaluation  process adopted by the supervisor, \nwhich covers all the processes and measures defined in the principles listed above. \nEssentially, these include the review and evaluation of the AIFI\u2019s ICAAP, conducting an \nindependent assessment of the AIFI\u2019s risk profil e, and if necessary, taking appropriate \nprudential measures and other supervisory actions.  \n \n15.1.5  These guidelines  seek to provide broad guidance to AIFIs by outlining the manner in \nwhich the SREP would be carried out by the Reserve Bank , the expected scope and design \nof their ICAAP, and the expectations of the Reserve Bank  from AIFIs in regard to \nimplementation of the ICAAP.  \n \n15.2 Conduct of the SREP by the Reserve Bank  \n15.2.1  Capital helps protect individual financial entities , such as  banks and AIFIs  from \ninsolvency, ther eby promoting safety and soundness in the overall financial system. \nMinimum regulatory capital requirements under Pillar 1 establish a threshold below which a \nsound AIFI\u2019s regulatory capital must not fall. Regulatory capital ratios permit some \ncomparative analysis of capital adequacy across regulated entities because they are based \non certain common methodology / assumptions. However, supervisors need to perform a \nmore comprehensive assessment of capital adequacy that considers risks specific to an \nAIFI, conducting analyses that go beyond minimum regulatory capital requirements.  \n \n15.2.2  The Reserve Bank  expects AIFIs to hold capital above their minimum regulatory \ncapital levels, commensurate with their individual risk profiles, to account for all material \nrisks. Un der the SREP, the Reserve Bank  will assess the overall capital adequacy of an AIFI \nthrough a comprehensive evaluation that takes into account all relevant available \ninformation. In determining the extent to which AIFIs should hold capital in excess of the  \n101 regulatory minimum, the Reserve Bank  would take into account the combined implications of \nan AIFI\u2019s compliance with regulatory minimum capital requirements, the quality and results \nof an AIFI\u2019s ICAAP, and supervisory assessment of the AIFI\u2019s risk managemen t processes, \ncontrol systems and other relevant information relating to the AIFI\u2019s risk profile and capital \nposition.  \n \n15.2.3  The SREP of AIFIs would, thus, be conducted as part of the  Reserve Bank \u2019s \ninspection  of AIFIs and in the light of the data in the off -site returns received from AIFIs in \nthe Reserve Bank , in conjunction with the ICAAP document, which is required to be \nsubmitted every year by AIFIs to the Reserve Bank  (refer to section  15.3.3.7 below). \nThrough the SREP, the Reserve Bank  would evaluate the a dequacy and efficacy of the \nICAAP of AIFIs and the capital requirements derived by them therefrom. While in the course \nof evaluation, there would be no attempt to reconcile the difference between the regulatory \nminimum CRAR and the outcome of the ICAAP of an AIFI (as the risks covered under the \ntwo processes are different), AIFIs would be expected to demonstrate to the Reserve Bank  \nthat the ICAAP adopted by them is fully responsive to their size, level of complexity, scope \nand scale of operations and the re sultant risk profile / exposures, and adequately captures \ntheir capital requirements. Such an evaluation of the effectiveness of the ICAAP would help \nthe Reserve Bank  in understanding the capital management processes and strategies \nadopted by AIFIs. If con sidered necessary, the SREP could also involve a dialogue between \nthe AIFI\u2019s top management and the Reserve Bank  from time to time. In addition to the \nperiodic reviews, independent external experts may also be commissioned by the Reserve \nBank , if deemed ne cessary, to perform ad hoc reviews and comment on specific aspects of \nthe ICAAP process of an AIFI; the nature and extent of such a review shall be determined by \nthe Reserve Bank .   \n \n15.2.4  Pillar 1 capital requirements will include a buffer for uncertainties sur rounding the \nPillar 1 regime that affect the financial entities as a whole. AIFI-specific uncertainties will be \ntreated under Pillar 277. It is anticipated that such buffers under Pillar 1 will be set to provide \nreasonable assurance that a n AIFI with good i nternal systems and controls, a well -diversified \nrisk profile and a business profile well covered by the Pillar 1 regime, and which operates \nwith capital equal to Pillar 1 requirements, will meet the minimum goals for soundness \nembodied in Pillar 1. Howeve r, the Reserve Bank  may require particular AIFIs to operate \nwith a buffer, over and above the Pillar 1 standard. AIFIs should maintain this buffer for a \ncombination of the following:  \n(i) Pillar 1 minimums are anticipated to be set to achieve a level of AIFI creditworthiness \nin markets that is below the level of creditworthiness sought by many AIFIs for their own \nreasons. For example, most international financial  institutions appear to prefer to be highly \nrated by internationally recognised rating agencies. Thus , AIFIs are likely to choose to \noperate above Pillar 1 minimums for competitive reasons.  \n \n(ii) In the normal course of business, the type and volume of activities will change, as will \nthe different risk exposures, causing fluctuations in the overall capital ra tio.  \n \n(iii) It may be costly for AIFIs to raise additional capital, especially if this needs to be \ndone quickly or at a time when market conditions are unfavourable.    \n \n(iv) For AIFIs to fall below minimum regulatory capital requirements is a serious matter. It \nmay place AIFIs in breach of the provisions of the Reserve Bank  regulations  and / or attract  \ncorrective action on the part of the Reserve Bank .    \n                                            \n77 Annex 3 of the Guidelines on Implementation of Basel I II Capital Regulations in India issued vide \ncircular DBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -2012 dated May 2, 2012 .  \n102  \n(v) There may be risks, either specific to individual AIFIs, or more generally to the \neconomy at large, that are no t taken into account in Pillar 1.78   \n  \nAs a part of SREP under Pillar 2, the Reserve Bank  may review the risk management \nmeasures taken by the AIFI and its adequacy to manage currency induced credit risk79, \nespecially if exposure to such risks is assessed t o be on higher side.  \n \nUnder the SREP, the Reserve Bank  would make an assessment as to whether the AIFI \nmaintains adequate capital cushion to take care of the above situations. Such cushion would \ngenerally be reflected in more than minimum capital adequacy ratio maintained by the AIFI.  \n \nUnder the SREP, the Reserve Bank  would also seek to determine whether an AIFI\u2019s overall \ncapital remains adequate as the underlying conditions change. Generally, material increases \nin risk that are not otherwise mitigated shou ld be accompanied by commensurate increases \nin capital. Conversely, reductions in overall capital (to a level still above regulatory minima) \nmay be appropriate if the Reserve Bank \u2019s supervisory assessment leads it to a conclusion \nthat risk has materially d eclined or that it has been appropriately mitigated. Based on such \nassessment, the Reserve Bank  could consider initiating appropriate supervisory measures to \naddress its supervisory concerns. The measures could include requiring a modification or \nenhanceme nt of the risk management and internal control processes of a n AIFI, a reduction \nin risk exposures, or any other action as deemed necessary to address the identified \nsupervisory concerns. These measures could also include the stipulation of a n AIFI-specifi c \nadditional capital requirement over and above what has been determined under Pillar 1.  \n \n15.2.5  As and when the advanced approaches envisaged in the Basel capital adequacy \nframework are permitted to be adopted in India, the SREP would also assess the ongoing \ncompliance by AIFIs with the eligibility criteria for adopting the advanced approaches.  \n \n15.3 The Structural Aspects of the ICAAP  \n15.3.1  This section outlines the broad parameters of the ICAAP that AIFIs shall comply with \nin designing  and implementing their ICAAP.  \n \n15.3.2  Every AIFI to have an ICAAP  \nThe ICAAP sh all be prepared, on a solo basis, at every tier for each entity within the group, \nas also at the level of the consolidated AIFI (i.e., a group of entities where the AIFI is the \ncontrolling entity).  \n \n15.3.3  ICAAP to encompass institution -wide risk profile  \n15.3.3.1  General firm -wide risk management  principles :  \nSenior management should understand the importance of taking an integrated, firm -wide \nperspective of a n AIFI\u2019s risk exposure, in order to support its ability to identify and react  to \nemerging and growing risks in a timely and effective manner. The purpose of this guidance \nis the need to enhance firm -wide oversight, risk management and controls around AIFIs\u2019 \ncapital markets activities, including securitisation, off -balance sheet exp osures, structured \ncredit and complex trading activities.  \n \n                                            \n78 If an AIFI has identified some capital add -on to ta ke care of an identified Pillar 2 risk or inadequately \ncapitalised Pillar 1 risk, that add -on can be translated into risk weighted assets as indicated in this \nsection  below, which should be added to the total risk weighted assets of the AIFI. No additional  Pillar \n2 buffer need be maintained for such identified risks.  \n79 Please refer to circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.85/21.06.200/2013 -14 and DBOD.No.BP.BC.116/ \n21.06.200/2013 -14 dated January 15, 2014 and June 3, 2014  addressed to banks , respectively.   \n103 A sound risk management system should have the following key features:  \n(i) Active  Board and senior management oversight;  \n(ii) Appropriate policies, procedures and limits;  \n(iii) Comprehensive and timely identifica tion, measurement, mitigation, controlling, \nmonitoring and reporting of risks;  \n(iv) Appropriate management information systems (MIS) at the business and firm -wide level; \nand \n(v) Comprehensive internal controls.  \n \n15.3.3.2  Board and Senior Management Oversight : \nThe ultimate r esponsibility for designing and implementation of the ICAAP lies with the AIFI\u2019s \nBoard. It is the responsibility of the Board and senior management to define the institution\u2019s \nrisk appetite and to ensure that the AIFI\u2019s risk management framework includes d etailed \npolicies that set specific firm -wide prudential limits on the AIFI\u2019s activities, which are \nconsistent with its risk -taking appetite and capacity. In order to determine the overall risk \nappetite, the Board and senior management must first have an un derstanding of risk \nexposures on a firm -wide basis. To achieve this understanding, the appropriate members of \nsenior management shall bring together the perspectives of the key business and control \nfunctions. In order to develop an integrated institution -wide perspective on risk, senior \nmanagement must overcome organisational silos between business lines and share \ninformation on market developments, risks and risk mitigation techniques. Senior \nmanagement should establish a risk management process that is no t limited to credit, \nmarket, liquidity and operational risks, but incorporates all material risks. This includes \nreputational  and strategic risks, as well as risks that do not appear to be significant in \nisolation, but when combined with other risks could lead to material losses.  \n \n15.3.3.3  The Board and senior management should possess sufficient knowledge of all \nmajor business lines to ensure that appropriate policies, controls and risk monitoring \nsystems are effective. They should have the necessary expertise to u nderstand the capital \nmarkets activities in which the AIFI is involved \u2013 such as securitisation and off -balance sheet \nactivities \u2013 and the associated risks. The Board and senior management should remain \ninformed on an on -going basis about these risks as fi nancial markets, risk management \npractices and the AIFI\u2019s activities evolve. In addition, the Board and senior management \nshould ensure that accountability and lines of authority are clearly delineated. With respect \nto new or complex products and activitie s, senior management should understand the \nunderlying assumptions regarding business models, valuation and risk management \npractices. In addition, senior management should evaluate the potential risk exposure if \nthose assumptions fail.  Before embarking on  new activities or introducing products new to \nthe institution, the Board  and senior management should identify and review the changes in \nfirm-wide risks arising from these potential new products or activities and ensure that the \ninfrastructure and interna l controls necessary to manage the related risks are in place. In this \nreview, a n AIFI should also consider the possible difficulty in valuing the new products and \nhow they might perform in a stressed economic environment. The Board should ensure that \nthe senior management of the AIFI: \n(i) establishes a risk framework in order to assess and appropriately manage the various \nrisk exposures of the AIFI; \n(ii) develops a system to monitor the AIFI's risk exposures and to relate them to the AIFI's \ncapital and reserve fund s; \n(iii) establishes a method to monitor the AIFI's compliance with internal policies, particularly \nin regard to risk management; and  \n(iv) effectively communicates all relevant policies and procedures throughout the AIFI. \n \nAn AIFI\u2019s risk function and its chief risk o fficer (CRO) or equivalent position should be \nindependent of the individual business lines and report directly to the chief executive officer  \n104 (CEO)  / Managing Director and the institution\u2019s Board. In addition, the risk function should \nhighlight to senior m anagement and the Board  risk management concerns, such as risk \nconcentrations and violations of risk appetite limits.  AIFIs may refer to circular no. \nDBR.BP.BC.No.65/21.04.103/2016 -17 dated April 27, 2017  on \u201cRisk Management Systems \n\u2013 Role of the Chief Ris k Officer (CRO) \u201d addressed to banks , as amended from time to time, \nfor, inter alia, the guidelines on the Role of CRO.  \n \n15.3.3.4  Policies, procedures, limits and controls : \nThe structure, design and contents of a n AIFI's ICAAP should be approved by the Board to \nensu re that the ICAAP forms an integral part of the management process and decision \nmaking culture of the AIFI. Institution -wide risk management programmes should include \ndetailed policies that set specific institution -wide prudential limits on the principal r isks \nrelevant to a n AIFI\u2019s activities. A n AIFI\u2019s policies and procedures should provide specific \nguidance for the implementation of broad business strategies and should establish, where \nappropriate, internal limits for the various types of risk s to which t he AIFI may be exposed. \nThese limits should consider the AIFI\u2019s role in the financial system and be defined in relation \nto the AIFI\u2019s capital, total assets, earnings or, where adequate measures exist, its overall risk \nlevel.  An AIFI\u2019s policies, procedures and limits should:  \n(i) Provide for adequate and timely identification, measurement, monitoring, control and \nmitigation of the risks posed by its lending, investing, trading, securitisation, off -\nbalance sheet, fiduciary and other significant activities at the b usiness line and \ninstitution -wide levels;  \n \n(ii) Ensure that the economic substance of a n AIFI\u2019s risk exposures, including reputational \nrisk and valuation uncertainty, are fully recognised and incorporated into the AIFI\u2019s risk \nmanagement processes;  \n \n(iii) Be consisten t with the AIFI\u2019s stated goals and objectives, as well as its overall financial \nstrength;  \n \n(iv) Clearly delineate accountability and lines of authority across the AIFI\u2019s various \nbusiness activities, and ensure  that there is a clear separation between business l ines \nand the risk function;  \n \n(v) Escalate and address breaches of internal position limits;  \n \n(vi) Provide for the review of new businesses and products by bringing together all \nrelevant risk management, control and business lines to ensure that the AIFI is able to \nmanage and control the activity prior to it being initiated; and  \n \n(vii) Include a schedule and process for reviewing the policies, procedures and limits and \nfor updating them as appropriate.  \n \n15.3.3.5  Identifying, measuring, monitoring and reporting of risk : \n(i) An AIFI\u2019s MI S should provide the Board  and senior management in a clear and \nconcise manner with timely and relevant information concerning their institutions\u2019 risk profile. \nThis information should include all risk exposures, including those that are off -balance sheet.  \nManagement should understand the assumptions behind and limitations inherent in specific \nrisk measures.  \n \n(ii) The key elements necessary for the aggregation of risks are an appropriate \ninfrastructure and MIS that (i) allow for the aggregation of exposures and risk measures \nacross business lines and (ii) support customised identification of concentrations and \nemerging risks. MIS developed to achieve this objective should support the ability to  \n105 evaluate the impact of various types of economic and financial shocks  that affect the whole \nof the financial institution. Further, a n AIFI\u2019s systems should be flexible enough to \nincorporate hedging and other risk mitigation actions to be carried out on a firm -wide basis \nwhile taking into account the various related basis ri sks. \n \n(iii) To enable proactive management of risk, the Board  and senior management need to \nensure that MIS is capable of providing regular, accurate and timely information on the AIFI\u2019s \naggregate risk profile, as well as the main assumptions used for risk aggre gation. MIS \nshould be adaptable and responsive to changes in the AIFI\u2019s underlying risk assumptions \nand should incorporate multiple perspectives of risk exposure to account for uncertainties in \nrisk measurement. In addition, it should be sufficiently flexi ble so that the institution can \ngenerate forward -looking AIFI-wide scenario analyses that capture management\u2019s \ninterpretation of evolving market conditions and stressed conditions. Third -party inputs or \nother tools used within MIS (e .g., credit ratings, ri sk measures, models) should be subject to \ninitial and ongoing validation.  \n \n(iv) An AIFI\u2019s MIS should be capable of capturing limit breaches and there should be \nprocedures in place to promptly report such breaches to senior management, as well as to \nensure that appropriate follow -up actions are taken. For instance, similar exposures should \nbe aggregated across business platforms (including the banking and trading books) to \ndetermine whether there is a concentration or a breach of an internal position limit.  \n \n15.3.3.6  Internal controls : \nRisk management processes should be frequently monitored and tested by independent \ncontrol areas and internal, as well as external, auditors. The aim is to ensure that the \ninformation on which decisions are based is accurate so that processe s fully reflect \nmanagement policies and that regular reporting, including the reporting of limit breaches and \nother exception -based reporting, is undertaken effectively. The risk management function of \nAIFIs shall be independent of the business lines in or der to ensure an adequate separation \nof duties and to avoid conflicts of interest.  \n \nSince a sound risk management process provides the basis for ensuring that a n AIFI \nmaintains adequate capital, the Board of a n AIFI shall set the tolerance level for risk.  \n \n15.3.3.7  Submission of the outcome of the ICAAP to the Board and the Reserve Bank  \nAs the ICAAP is an ongoing process, a written record on th e outcome of the ICAAP should  \nbe periodically submitted by AIFIs to their Board . Such written record of the internal \nassessm ent of its capital adequacy should include, inter alia , the risks identified, the manner \nin which those risks are monitored and managed, the impact of the AIFI\u2019s changing risk \nprofile on its capital position, details of stress tests/scenario analysis condu cted and the \nresultant capital requirements. The reports shall be sufficiently detailed to allow the Board to \nevaluate the level and trend of material risk exposures, whether the AIFI maintains adequate \ncapital against the risk exposures and in case of add itional capital being needed, the plan for \naugmenting capital. The Board would be expected make timely adjustments to the strategic \nplan, as necessary.  \n \nBased on the outcome of the ICAAP as submitted to and approved by the Board, the ICAAP \nDocument, in the  format furnished  at Annex 13 , shoul d be furnished to the Reserve Bank  \n(i.e., to the CGM -in-Charge, Department of Supervision, Central Office, Mumbai  with a copy \naddressed to Senior Supervisory Manager of the AIFI ). The documen t should reach the \nReserve Bank  latest by end of the first quarter (i.e ., April-June) of the relevant financial year .  \n \n15.4 Review of the ICAAP Outcomes  \nThe Board shall, at least once a year, assess and document whether the processes relating  \n106 to the ICAAP imp lemented by the AIFI successfully achieve the objectives envisaged by the \nBoard . The senior management should also receive and review the reports regularly to \nevaluate the sensitivity of the key assumptions and to assess the validity of the AIFI\u2019s \nestimate d future capital requirements. In the light of such an assessment, appropriate \nchanges in the ICAAP should be instituted to ensure that the underlying objectives are \neffectively achieved.  \n \n15.5 ICAAP to be an Integral part of the Management and Decision -making  Culture  \nThe ICAAP should fo rm an integral part of the management and decision -making culture of \nan AIFI. This integration could range from using the ICAAP to internally allocate capital to \nvarious business units, to having it play a role in the individua l credit decision process and \npricing of products or more general business decisions such as expansion plans and \nbudgets. The integration would also mean that ICAAP should enable the AIFI management \nto assess, on an ongoing basis, the risks that are inhere nt in their activities and material to \nthe institution.  \n \n15.6 The Principle of Proportionality  \nThe implementation of ICAAP should be guided by the principle of proportionality. Though \nAIFIs are encouraged to migrate to and adopt progressively sophisticated appr oaches in \ndesigning their ICAAP, the Reserve Bank  expect s the degree of sophistication adopted in \nthe ICAAP in regard to risk measurement and management to be commensurate with the \nnature, scope, scale and the degree of complexity in the AIFI\u2019s business op erations. The \nfollowing section s illustratively  enumerate the broad approach which could be considered \nby AIFIs with varying levels of complexity in their operations, in formulating their ICAAP.  \n \n15.6.1  In relation to a n AIFI that defines its activities and risk  management practices as \nsimple, in carrying out its ICAAP, that AIFI could:  \n(a) identify and consider that AIFI\u2019s largest losses over the last 3 to 5 years and whether \nthose losses are likely to recur;  \n(b) prepare a short list of the most significant risks to whi ch that AIFI is exposed;  \n(c) consider how that AIFI would act, and the amount of capital that would be absorbed \nin the event that each of the risks identified were to materialise;  \n(d) consider how that AIFI\u2019s capital requirement  might alter under the scenarios in (c) \nand how its capital requirement  might alter in line with its business plans for the next \n3 to 5 years; and  \n(e) document the ranges of capital required in the scenarios identified above and form an \noverall view on the amount and quality of capital which tha t AIFI should hold, \nensuring that its senior management is involved in arriving at that view.  \n \n15.6.2  In relation to a n AIFI that define s its activities and risk management practices as \nmoderately complex, in carrying out its ICAAP, that AIFI could:  \n(a) having consul ted the operational management in each major business line, prepare a \ncomprehensive list of the major risks to which the business is exposed;  \n(b) estimate, with the aid of historical data, where available, the range and distribution of \npossible losses which mi ght arise from each of those risks and consider using shock \nstress tests to provide risk estimates;  \n(c) consider the extent to which that AIFI\u2019s capital requirement adequately captures the \nrisks identified in (a) and (b) above;  \n(d) for areas in which the capital r equirement is either inadequate or does not address a \nrisk, estimate the additional capital needed to protect that AIFI and its customers, in \naddition to any other risk mitigation action that AIFI plans to take;   \n107 (e) consider the risk that the AIFI\u2019s own analys es of capital adequacy may be inaccurate \nand that it may suffer from management weaknesses which affect the effectiveness \nof its risk management and mitigation;  \n(f) project that AIFI\u2019s business activities forward in detail for one year and in less detail \nfor the next 3 to 5 years, and estimate how that AIFI\u2019s capital and capital requirement \nwould alter, assuming that business develops as expected;  \n(g) assume that business does not develop as expected and consider how that AIFI\u2019s \ncapital and capital requirement woul d alter and what that AIFI\u2019s reaction to a range of \nadverse economic scenarios might be;  \n(h) document the results obtained from the analyses in (b), (d), (f), and (g) above in a \ndetailed report for that AIFI\u2019s top management / Board; and  \n(i) ensure that systems an d processes are in place to review the accuracy of the \nestimates made in (b), (d), (f) and (g) (i.e., systems for back testing) vis -\u00e0-vis the \nperformance / actuals.  \n \n15.6.3  In relation to a n AIFI that define s its activities and risk management practices as \ncomple x, in carrying out its ICAAP, that AIFI could follow a proportional approach to that \nAIFI\u2019s ICAAP  which should cover the issues identified at (a) to (d) in section  15.6.2  above, \nbut is likely also to involve the use of models, most of which will be integra ted into its day -to-\nday management and operations.  \nModels of the kind referred to above may be linked so as to generate an overall estimate of \nthe amount of capital that a n AIFI considers appropriate to hold for its business needs. A n \nAIFI may also link s uch models to generate information on the economic capital considered \ndesirable for that AIFI. A model which a n AIFI uses to generate its target amount of \neconomic capital is known as an economic capital model (ECM). Economic capital is the \ntarget amount o f capital which optimises the return for a n AIFI\u2019s stakeholders for a desired \nlevel of risk. For example, a n AIFI is likely to use value -at-risk (VaR) models for  market risk, \nadvanced modelling approaches for credit risk and, possibly, advanced measurement  \napproaches for operational risk. A n AIFI might also use economic scenario generators to \nmodel stochastically its business forecasts and risks. However, AIFIs would need prior \napproval of the Reserve Bank  for migrating to the advanced approaches  envisaged in the \nBasel Capital Framework . \n \n15.7 Regular I ndependent Review and Validation  \nThe ICAAP should be subject to regular and independent review through an internal or \nexternal audit process, separately from the SREP conducted by the Reserve Bank , to \nensure that t he ICAAP is comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scope, scale and \nlevel of complexity of the AIFI\u2019s activities so that it accurately reflects the major sources of \nrisk that the AIFI is exposed to. A n AIFI shall ensure appropriate and effective in ternal \ncontrol structures, particularly in regard to the risk management processes, in order to \nmonitor the AIFI\u2019s continued compliance with internal policies and procedures. As a \nminimum, a n AIFI shall conduct periodic reviews of its risk management proce sses, which \nshould ensure:  \n(i) the integrity, accuracy, and reasonableness of the processes;  \n(ii) the appropriateness of the AIFI\u2019s capital assessment process based on the  nature, \nscope, scale and complexity of the AIFI\u2019s activities;  \n(iii) the timely identification of an y concentration risk;  \n(iv) the accuracy and completeness of any data inputs into the AIFI\u2019s capital  assessment \nprocess;   \n(v) the reasonableness and validity of any assumptions and scenarios used in the capital \nassessment process;  and \n(vi) that the AIFI conducts appropri ate stress testing;   \n108  \n15.8 ICAAP to be a Forward -looking Process  \nThe ICAAP should be forward looking in nature, and thus, should take into account the \nexpected / estimated future developments such as strategic plans, macro -economic  factors, \netc., including the l ikely future constraints in the availability and use of capital. A t a minimum, \nthe management of a n AIFI shall develop and maintain an appropriate strategy that would \nensure that the AIFI maintains adequate capital commensurate with the nature, scope, \nscale, complexity and risks inherent in the AIFI\u2019s on -balance -sheet and off -balance -sheet \nactivities, and should demonstrate as to how the strategy dovetails with the macro -economic \nfactors.  \n \nThus, AIFIs shall have an explicit, Board -approved capital plan whic h should spell out the \ninstitution's objectives in regard to level of capital, the time horizon for achieving those \nobjectives, and in broad terms, the capital planning process and the n allocate responsibilities \nfor that process.  \n \n15.9 ICAAP to be a Risk-based Process  \nThe adequacy of a n AIFI\u2019s capital is a function of its risk profile. AIFIs shall, therefore, set \ntheir capital targets which are consistent with their risk profile and operating environment. A t \na minimum, a n AIFI shall have in place a sound ICAAP, which shall include all material  risk \nexposures incurred by the AIFI. There are some types of risks (such as reputation risk and \nstrategic risk) which are less readily quantifiable; for such risks, the focus of the ICAAP \nshould be more on qualitative asses sment, risk management and mitigation than on \nquantification of such risks.  AIFIs\u2019 ICAAP document shall clearly indicate for which risks a \nquantitative measure is considered warranted, and for which risks a qualitative measure is \nconsidered to be the corre ct approach.  \n \n15.10  ICAAP to Include Stress Tests and Scenario Analyses  \nAs part of the ICAAP, the management of a n AIFI shall, a t a minimum, conduct relevant \nstress tests periodically, particularly in respect of the AIFI\u2019s material risk exposures, in order \nto evaluate the potential vulnerability of the AIFI to some unlikely but plausible events or \nmovements in the market conditions that could have an adverse impact on the AIFI. The use \nof stress testing framework can provide a n AIFI\u2019s management a better underst anding of the \nAIFI\u2019s likely exposure in extreme circumstances. In this context, the  attention is also invited \nto the risk management g uidelines applicable to the AIFIs. The AIFIs are urged to take \nnecessary measures for implementing an appropriate formal s tress testing framework which \nwould also meet the stress testing requirements under the ICAAP of the AIFIs.  \n \n15.11  Use of Capital Models for ICAAP   \nWhile there is no single prescribed approach as to how a n AIFI should develop its capital \nmodel, a n AIFI adoptin g a model -based approach to its ICAAP shall be able to, inter alia,  \ndemonstrate:  \n(a) Well documented model specifications, including the methodology / mechanics and \nthe assumptions underpinning the working of the model;  \n(b) The extent of reliance on the historical  data in the model and the system of back \ntesting to be carried out to assess the validity of the outputs of the model vis -\u00e0-vis the \nactual outcomes;  \n(c) A robust system for independent validation of the model inputs and outputs;  \n(d) A system of stress testing the  model to establish that the model remains valid even \nunder extreme conditions / assumptions;  \n(e) The level of confidence assigned to the model outputs and its linkage to the AIFI\u2019s \nbusiness strategy;   \n109 (f) The adequacy of the requisite skills and resources within t he AIFIs to operate, \nmaintain and develop the model.  \n16. Select Operational Aspects of the ICAAP  \nThis Section outlines in somewhat greater detail the scope of the risk universe expected to \nbe normally captured by the AIFIs in their ICAAP.  \n \n16.1 Identifying  and Measuring Material Risks in ICAAP  \n(i) The first objective of an ICAAP is to identify all material risks. Risks that can be \nreliably measured and quantified should be treated as rigorously as data and methods allow. \nThe appropriate means and methods to measure and quantify those material risks are likely \nto vary across AIFIs. \n  \n(ii) Some of the risks to which AIFIs are exposed include credit risk, market risk, \noperational risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, credit concentration risk and liquidity \nrisk (as briefly outlined below). The Reserve Bank  has issued guidelines to the AIFIs on \nvarious risk management areas from time to time. A n AIFI\u2019s risk management processes, \nincluding its ICAAP, should, therefore, be consistent with this existing body of guida nce. \nHowever, certain other risks, such as reputational risk and business or strategic risk, may be \nequally important for a n AIFI and, in such cases, should be given same consideration as the \nmore formally defined risk types. For example, a n AIFI may be en gaged in businesses for \nwhich periodic fluctuations in activity levels, combined with relatively high fixed costs, have \nthe potential to create unanticipated losses that must  be supported by adequate capital. \nAdditionally, a n AIFI might be involved in stra tegic activities (such as expanding business \nlines or engaging in acquisitions) that introduce significant elements of risk and for which \nadditional capital would be appropriate.   \n \n(iii) Additionally, if AIFIs employ risk mitigation techniques, they should  understand the \nrisk to be mitigated and the potential effects of that mitigation, reckoning its enforceability \nand effectiveness, on the risk profile of the AIFI. \n \n16.2 Credit  Risk80 \n16.2.1  AIFIs should have methodologies that enable them to assess the credit risk inv olved \nin exposures to individual borrowers or counterparties as well as at the portfolio level. AIFIs \nshould be particularly attentive to identifying credit risk concentrations and ensuring that their \neffects are adequately assessed. This should include co nsideration of various types of \ndependence among exposures, incorporating the credit risk effects of extreme outcomes, \nstress events, and shocks to the assumptions made about the portfolio and exposure \nbehaviour. AIFIs should also carefully assess concentr ations in counterparty credit \nexposures, including counterparty credit risk exposures emanating from trading in less liquid \nmarkets, and determine the effect that these might have on the AIFI\u2019s capital adequacy.  \n \n16.2.2  AIFIs should assess exposures, regardless o f whether they are rated or unrated81, \nand determine whether the risk weights applied to such exposures, under the Standardised \nApproach, are appropriate for their inherent risk. In those instances where a n AIFI \ndetermines that the inherent risk of such an exposure, particularly if it is unrated, is \n                                            \n80 Annex 3 of th e Guidelines on Implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India issued vide \ncircular DBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -2012 dated May 2, 2012 . \n81 In such cases it would be in order for AIFIs to derive notional external ratings of the unrated \nexposure  by mapping their internal credit risk ratings / grades of the exposure used for pricing \npurposes with the external ratings scale.  \n  \n110 significantly higher than that implied by the risk weight to which it is assigned, the AIFI \nshould consider the higher degree of credit risk in the evaluation of its overall capital \nadequacy. For more sophisticat ed AIFIs, the credit review assessment of capital adequacy, \nat a minimum, should cover four areas: risk rating systems, portfolio analysis/aggregation, \nsecuritisation/complex credit derivatives, and large exposures and risk concentrations.  \n \n16.2.3  Counterparty credit risk (CCR)   \n(i) The AIFIs shall have counterparty credit risk management policies, processes and \nsystems that are conceptually sound and implemented with integrity relative to the \nsophistication and complexity of a n AIFI\u2019s holdings of exposures that give rise to \ncounterparty credit risk (CCR). A sound counterparty credit risk management framework \nshall include the identification, measurement, management, approval and internal reporting \nof CCR.  \n \n(ii) The AIFI\u2019s risk management policies shall take account of the market, liquidity, and \noperational risks that can be associated with CCR and, to the extent practicable, \ninterrelationships among those risks. The AIFIs shall not undertake business with a \ncounterparty without assessing its creditworthiness and shall take due account of both \nsettlement and pre -settlement credit risk. These risks shall be managed as comprehensively \nas practicable at the counterparty level (aggregating counterparty exposures with other \ncredit exposures) and at the enterprise -wide level.  \n \n(iii) The Board and senior management shall be actively involved in the CCR control \nprocess and shall regard this as an essential aspect of the business to which significant \nresources need to be devoted. The daily reports prepared on a firm\u2019s exposures to CCR \nshall be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce \nboth reductions of positions taken by individual credit managers or traders and reductions in \nthe AIFI\u2019s overall CCR exposure.  \n \n(iv) The AIFI\u2019s CCR management system shall be used in conjunction with internal credit \nand trading limits.  \n \n(v) The measurement of CCR shall include monitoring daily and intra -day usage of credit \nlines. The AIFI shall measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held where such \nmeasures are app ropriate and meaningful (e.g. , OTC derivatives, margin lending, etc.). \nMeasuring and monitoring peak exposure or potential future exposure (PFE), both the \nportfolio and counterparty levels is one element of a robust limit monitoring system. AIFIs \nshall take account of large or concentrated positions, including concentrations by groups of \nrelated counterparties, by industry, by market, customer investment strategies, etc.  \n \n(vi) The AIFI shall have an appropriate stress testing methodology in place to assess the \nimpact on the counterparty credit risk of abnormal volatilities in market variables driving the \ncounterparty exposures and changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparty. The results \nof this stress testing shall be reviewed periodically by senior manag ement and shall be \nreflected in the CCR policies and limits set by management and the Board. Where stress \ntests reveal particular vulnerability to a given set of circumstances, management should \nexplicitly consider appropriate risk management strategies (e .g., by hedging against that \noutcome, or reducing the size of the firm\u2019s exposures).  \n \n(vii) The AIFI shall have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a documented set of \ninternal policies, controls and procedures concerning the operation of the CCR man agement \nsystem. The firm\u2019s CCR management system shall be well documented, for example, \nthrough a risk management manual that describes the basic principles of the risk \nmanagement system and that provides an explanation of the empirical techniques used to \nmeasure CCR.   \n111  \n(viii) The AIFI shall conduct an independent review of the CCR management system \nregularly through its own internal auditing process. This review shall include both the \nactivities of the business credit and trading units and of the independent CCR c ontrol unit. A \nreview of the overall CCR management process shall take place at regular intervals (ideally \nnot less than once a year) and shall specifically address, at a minimum:  \n \n(a) the adequacy of the documentation of the CCR management system and process;  \n \n(b) the organisation of the collateral management unit;  \n \n(c) the organisation of the CCR control unit;  \n \n(d) the integration of CCR measures into daily risk management;  \n \n(e) the approval process for risk pricing models and valuation systems used by front and \nback - office  personnel;  \n \n(f) the validation of any significant change in the CCR measurement process;  \n \n(g) the scope of counterparty credit risks captured by the risk measurement model;  \n \n(h) the integrity of the management information system;  \n \n(i) the accuracy and completeness of CCR  data;  \n \n(j) the accurate reflection of legal terms in collateral and netting agreements into exposure \nmeasurements; the verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data \nsources used to run internal models, including the independence of such data sources;  \n \n(k) the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions;  \n \n(l) the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations; and  \n \n(m) the verification of the model\u2019s accuracy through frequent back -testing.  \n \n(ix) AIFIs should make an a ssessment as part of their ICAAP as to whether the AIFI\u2019s \nevaluation of the risks contained in the transactions that give rise to CCR and the AIFI\u2019s \nassessment of whether the Current Exposure Method (CEM) captures those risks \nappropriately and satisfactori ly. In cases where, under SREP, it is determined that CEM \ndoes not capture the risk inherent in the AIFI\u2019s relevant transactions (as could be the case \nwith structured, more complex OTC derivatives), the Reserve Bank  may require the AIFI to \napply the CEM on  a transaction -by-transaction basis (i.e. , no netting will be recognized even \nif it is permissible legally).  \n \n16.3 Market Risk \nAn AIFI should be able to identify risks in trading activities resulting from a movement in \nmarket prices. This determination should c onsider factors such as illiquidity of instruments, \nconcentrated positions, one -way markets, non -linear/deep out -of-the money positions, and \nthe potential for significant shifts in correlations. Exercises that incorporate extreme events \nand shocks should a lso be tailored to capture key portfolio vulnerabilities to the relevant \nmarket developments.   \n \n \n  \n112 16.4 Operational Risk \nAn AIFI should be able to assess the potential risks resulting from inadequate or failed \ninternal processes, people, and systems, as well as fr om events external to the AIFI. This \nassessment should include the effects of extreme events and shocks relating to operational \nrisk. Events could include a sudden increase in failed processes across business units or a \nsignificant incidence of failed inte rnal controls.  \n \n16.5 Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)  \nAn AIFI should identify the risks associated with the changing interest rates on its on -\nbalance sheet and off -balance sheet exposures in the banking book from both, a short -term \nand long -term p erspective. This might include the impact of changes due to parallel shocks, \nyield curve twists, yield curve inversions, changes in the relationships of rates (basis risk), \nand other relevant scenarios. The AIFI should be able to support its assumptions ab out the \nbehavioural  characteristics of its non -maturity deposits and other assets and liabilities, \nespecially those exposures characterised by embedded optionality. Given the uncertainty in \nsuch assumptions, stress testing and scenario analysis should be u sed in the analysis of \ninterest rate risks. While there could be several approaches to measurement of IRRBB, an \nillustrative approach for measurement of IRRBB is furn ished at Annex 9. The AIFIs would, \nhowever, be free to adopt any other variant of these approaches or entirely different \nmethodology for computing / quantifying the IRRBB provided the technique is based on \nobjective, verifiable and transparent methodology and criteria.  \nReference is also invited to the updated guidel ines on IRRBB issued vide circular no. \nDOR.MRG.REC.102/00 -00-009/2022 -23 dated February 17, 2023  on \u2018Governance, \nmeasurement and management of Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book\u2019. As mentioned in the \ncircular ibid, the date for implementation will be commu nicated in due course. AIFIs  are \nadvised to be in preparedness for measuring, monitoring, and disclosing their exposure to \ninterest rate risk in the banking book in terms of the circular ibid. Meanwhile, AIFIs  shall \nsubmit the disclosures as advised in the  circular ibid. \n \n \n16.6 Credit Concentration Risk \nA risk concentration is any single exposure or a group of exposures with the potential to \nproduce losses large enough (relative to a n AIFI\u2019s capital, total assets, or overall risk level) \nto threaten a n AIFI\u2019s hea lth or ability to maintain its core operations. Risk concentrations \nhave arguably been the single most important cause of major problems in financial systems . \nConcentration risk resulting from concentrated portfolios could be significant for AIFIs as \nwell. \nThe following qualitative criteria  could be adopted by AIFIs to demonstrate that the credit \nconcentration risk is being adequately addressed:  \n(i) While assessing the exposure to concentration risk, a n AIFI should keep in view that \nthe calculations of Basel capital adequacy framework are based on the assumption that a n \nAIFI is well diversified.  \n(ii) Typically, the AIFIs are sector -specific institutions and have a relatively limited scope \nfor diversifying their assets portfoli o. As a result, as compared to  banks,  these institutions \nhave higher credit concentration risk. The ICAAPs prepared by these institutions shall \naddress this risk. One way to reduce overall credit concentration risk faced by the AIFIs is to \nlimit their single name concentration by choosing to ado pt lower large exposure limits. In \naddition, the AIFIs could consider diversifying their credit portfolios , inter -alia, along the \nfollowing dimensions:  \n(a) Geographical spread within the country  \n(b) Domestic/ International/ across countries (e.g. , in case of EXIM Bank)  \n(c) Industry segment  \n(d) Direct Lending/ Refinance   \n113 (e) Production Credit/ Marketing Credit/ Investment Credit (e.g. , in case of \nNABARD)  \n(f) Microfinance/ SMEs/ Mid -corporate/ Large Corporates  \n(g) Public Sector/ Private Sector Borrowers  \n(h) Financial sector entities - Publi c Sector Banks/ Private Sector Banks/ RRBs/ \nCooperative Banks, etc.  \n(i) Residential/ Commercial Real Estate (e.g. , in case of NHB)  \n \nThe sectoral concentration risk and the risk arising from the above mentioned dimensions of \ncredit concentration of the individu al AIFI will be specifically evaluated under SREP and the \nAIFI may be required to hold additional capital to mitigate this risk . \n(iii) While the AIFIs\u2019 single borrower exposures, the group borrower exposures and \ncapital market exposures are regulated by the expo sure norms prescribed by the Reserve \nBank  in Chapter I II of these Directions , there could be concentrations in these portfolios as \nwell. In assessing the degree of credit concentration, therefore, a n AIFI shall consider not \nonly the foregoing exposures but  also consider the degree of credit concentration in a \nparticular economic sector or geographical area. AIFIs with operational concentration in a \nfew geographical regions, shall also consider the impact of adverse economic developments \nin that region, and their impact on the asset quality.  \n(iv) The performance of specialised portfolios may, in some instances, also depend on \nkey individuals / employees of the AIFI. Such a situation could exacerbate the concentration \nrisk because the skills of those individuals, i n part, limit the risk arising from a concentrated \nportfolio. The impact of such key employees / individuals on the concentration risk is likely to \nbe correspondingly greater in smaller AIFIs. In developing its stress tests and scenario \nanalyses, an AIFI  shall, therefore, also consider the impact of losing key personnel on its \nability to operate normally, as well as the direct impact on its revenues.   \nAs regards the quantitative criteria  to be used to ensure that credit concentration risk is \nbeing adequatel y addressed, the credit concentration risk calculations shall be performed at \nthe counterparty level (i.e., large exposures), at the portfolio level (i.e., sectoral and \ngeographical concentrations) and at the asset class level (i.e., liability and assets \nconcentrations).   \nThere could be several approaches to the measurement of credit concentration  of the AIFIs\u2019 \nportfolio. One of the approaches commonly used for the purpose involves computation of \nHerfindahl -Hirshman Index (HHI). It may please be noted that the HHI as a measure of \nconcentration risk is only one of the possible methods and the AIFIs would be free to adopt \nany other appropriate method for the purpose, which has objective and transparent criteria \nfor such measurement.    \n \nRisk concentrations sho uld be analysed on both solo and consolidated basis.82 Risk \nconcentrations should be viewed in the context of a single or a set of closely related risk -\ndrivers that may have different impacts on a n AIFI. These concentrations should be \nintegrated when assess ing a n AIFI\u2019s overall risk exposure. A n AIFI should consider \nconcentrations that are based on common or correlated risk factors that reflect more subtle \nor more situation -specific factors than traditional concentrations, such as correlations \nbetween market , credit risks and liquidity risk.  \n \nThe growth of market -based intermediation has increased the possibility that different areas \nof an AIFI are exposed to a common set of products, risk factors or counterparties. This has \ncreated new challenges for risk ag gregation and concentration management. Through its \n                                            \n82 Master Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.73/21.06.001/2009 -10 dated Feb 8, 2010  addressed to banks.   \n114 risk management processes and MIS, a n AIFI should be able to identify and aggregate \nsimilar risk exposures across the firm, including across legal entities, asset types (e .g., \nloans, derivatives and struc tured products), risk areas (e .g. the trading book) and geographic \nregions. In addition to the situations described in section  16.6 (ii) above , risk  concentrations \ncan arise include:  \n(a) exposures to a single counterparty, or group of connected counterparties;  \n(b) exposures to both regulated and non -regulated financial institutions such as hedge \nfunds and private equity firms;  \n(c) trading exposures/market risk;  \n\uf0b7 exposures to counterparties (e.g. , hedge funds and hedge counterparties) through \nthe execution or processing of transactions (either product or service);  \n\uf0b7 funding sources;  \n\uf0b7 assets that are held in the banking book or trading book, such as loans, \nderivatives and structured products; and  \n\uf0b7 off-balance sheet exposures, including guarantees, liquidity lines and other \ncommitments.  \n \nRisk concentrations can also arise through a combination of exposures across these broad \ncategories. A n AIFI should have an understanding of its institution -wide risk concentrations \nresulting from similar exposures across its different business lines. Examples of such \nbusiness lines include subprime exposure in lending books; counterparty exposures; conduit \nexposures and SIVs; contractual and non -contractual exposures; trading activities; and \nunderwriting pipelines.  \n \nProcedures should be in plac e to communicate risk concentrations to the Board and senior \nmanagement in a manner that clearly indicates where in the organisation each segment of a \nrisk concentration resides. A n AIFI should have credible risk mitigation strategies in place \nthat have se nior management approval. This may include altering business strategies, \nreducing limits or increasing capital buffers in line with the desired risk profile. While it \nimplements risk mitigation strategies, the AIFI should be aware of possible concentration s \nthat might arise as a result of employing risk mitigation techniques.  \n \nAIFIs should employ a number of techniques, as appropriate, to measure risk \nconcentrations. These techniques include shocks to various risk factors; use of business \nlevel and institut ion-wide scenarios; and the use of integrated stress testing and economic \ncapital models. Identified concentrations should be measured in a number of ways, including \nfor example consideration of gross versus net exposures, use of notional amounts, and \nanalysis of exposures with and without counterparty hedges. A n AIFI should establish \ninternal position limits for concentrations to which it may be exposed. When conducting \nperiodic stress tests a n AIFI should incorporate all major risk concentrations and iden tify and \nrespond to potential changes in market conditions that could adversely impact their \nperformance and capital adequacy.  \n \nThe assessment of such risks under a n AIFI\u2019s ICAAP and the supervisory review process \nshould not be a mechanical process, but on e in which each AIFI determines, depending on \nits business model, its own specific vulnerabilities. An appropriate level of capital for risk \nconcentrations should be incorporated in a n AIFI\u2019s ICAAP, as well as in Pillar 2 \nassessments. Each AIFI should disc uss such issues with its supervisor.  \n \nAn AIFI should have in place effective internal policies, systems and controls to identify, \nmeasure, monitor, manage, control and mitigate its risk concentrations in a timely manner. \nNot only should normal market condi tions be considered, but also the potential build -up of \nconcentrations under stressed market conditions, economic downturns and periods of \ngeneral market illiquidity. In addition, the AIFI should assess scenarios that consider \npossible concentrations arisi ng from contractual and non -contractual contingent claims. The  \n115 scenarios should also combine the potential build -up of pipeline exposures together with the \nloss of market liquidity and a significant decline in asset values.  \n \n16.7 Liquidity Risk \nAn AIFI should u nderstand the risks resulting from its inability to meet its obligations as they \ncome due, because of difficulty in liquidating assets (market liquidity risk) or in obtaining \nadequate funding (funding liquidity risk). This assessment should include analysi s of sources \nand uses of funds, an understanding of the funding markets in which the AIFI operates, and \nan assessment of the efficacy of a contingency funding plan for events that could arise.  \n \nThe financial market crisis underscores the importance of asse ssing the potential impact of \nliquidity risk on capital adequacy in a n AIFI\u2019s ICAAP. Senior management should consider \nthe relationship between liquidity and capital since liquidity risk can impact capital adequacy \nwhich, in turn, can aggravate a n AIFI\u2019s liquidity profile.  \n \nA key element in the management of liquidity risk is the need for strong governance of \nliquidity risk, including the setting of a liquidity risk tolerance by the Board . The risk tolerance \nshould be communicated throughout the AIFI and re flected in the strategy and policies that \nsenior management set to manage liquidity risk. Another facet of liquidity risk management \nis that a n AIFI should appropriately price the costs, benefits and risks of liquidity into the \ninternal pricing, performanc e measurement, and new product approval process of all \nsignificant business activities.  \n \nAn AIFI is expected to be able to thoroughly identify, measure and control liquidity risks, \nespecially with regard to complex products and contingent commitments (both  contractual \nand non -contractual). This process should involve the ability to project cash flows arising \nfrom assets, liabilities and off -balance sheet items over various time horizons, and should \nensure diversification in both the tenor and source of fund ing. A n AIFI should utilise early \nwarning indicators to identify the emergence of increased risk or vulnerabilities in its liquidity \nposition or funding needs. It should have the ability to control liquidity risk exposure and \nfunding needs, regardless of i ts organisation structure, within and across legal entities, \nbusiness lines, and currencies, taking into account any legal, regulatory and operational \nlimitations to the transferability of liquidity.  \n \nWhile AIFIs typically manage liquidity under \u201cnormal\u201d c ircumstances, they should also be \nprepared to manage liquidity under \u201cstressed\u201d conditions. A n AIFI should perform stress \ntests or scenario analyses on a regular basis in order to identify and quantify their exposures \nto possible future liquidity stresses,  analysing possible impacts on the institutions\u2019 cash \nflows, liquidity positions, profitability, and solvency. The results of these stress tests should \nbe discussed thoroughly by management, and based on this discussion, should form the \nbasis for taking re medial or mitigating actions to limit the AIFI\u2019s exposures, build up a \nliquidity cushion, and adjust its liquidity profile to fit its risk tolerance. The results of stress \ntests should also play a key role in shaping the AIFI\u2019s contingency funding planning , which \nshould outline policies for managing a range of stress events and clearly sets out strategies \nfor addressing liquidity shortfalls in emergency situations.  \n \nAs public disclosure increases certainty in the market, improves transparency, facilitates \nvaluation, and strengthens market discipline, it is important that AIFIs publicly disclose \ninformation on a regular basis that enables market participants to make informed decisions \nabout the soundness of their liquidity risk management framework and liquid ity position.  \n \n16.8 Off-Balance Sheet Exposures and Securitisation Risk  \nIn light of the wide range of risks arising from securitisation activities, which can be \ncompounded by rapid innovation in securitisation techniques and instruments, minimum \ncapital requir ements calculated under Pillar 1 are often insufficient. All risks arising from  \n116 securitisation, particularly those that are not fully captured under Pillar 1, should be \naddressed in a n AIFI\u2019s ICAAP. These risks include:  \n(i) Credit, market, liquidity and reputa tional risk of each exposure;  \n(ii) Potential delinquencies and losses on the underlying securitised exposures;  \n(iii) Exposures from credit lines or liquidity facilities to special purpose entities;  \n(iv) Exposures from guarantees provided by monolines and other third part ies. \nSecuritisation exposures should be included in the AIFI\u2019s MIS to help ensure that senior \nmanagement understands the implications of such exposures for liquidity, earnings, risk \nconcentration and capital. More specifically, a n AIFI should have the nece ssary processes in \nplace to capture in a timely manner , updated information on securitisation transactions \nincluding market data, if available, and updated performance data from the securitisation \ntrustee or servicer.  \n \n16.9 Reputational Risk and Implicit Suppor t83  \n16.9.1  Provision of Implicit Support for Securiti sation Transactions  \n(i) Provision of implicit support to a transaction, whether contractual (i.e. credit \nenhancements provided at the inception of a securitised transaction) or non -contractual \n(implicit support) ca n take numerous forms. For instance, contractual support can include \nover collateralisation, credit derivatives, spread accounts, contractual recourse obligations, \nsubordinated notes, credit risk mitigants provided to a specific tranche, the subordination of \nfee or interest income or the deferral of margin income, and clean -up calls that exceed 10 \nper cent of the initial issuance. Examples of implicit support include the purchase of \ndeteriorating credit risk exposures from the underlying pool, the sale of d iscounted credit risk \nexposures into the pool of securitised credit risk exposures, the purchase of underlying \nexposures at above market price or an increase in the first loss position according to the \ndeterioration of the underlying exposures.  \n \n(ii) The provi sion of implicit (or non -contractual) support, as opposed to contractual \ncredit support (i.e. , credit enhancements), raises significant supervisory concerns. For \ntraditional securitisation structures the provision of implicit support undermines the clean \nbreak criteria, which when satisfied would allow AIFIs to exclude the securitised assets from \nregulatory capital calculations. By providing implicit support, AIFIs signal to the market that \nthe risk is still with the AIFI and has not in effect been transfer red. The institution\u2019s capital \ncalculation therefore understates the true risk. Accordingly, national supervisors are \nexpected to take appropriate action when a financial entity provides implicit support.  \n \n(iii) When a n AIFI has been found to provide implicit s upport to a securitisation, it will be \nrequired to hold capital against all of the underlying exposures associated with the structure \nas if they had not been securitised. It will also be required to disclose publicly that it was \nfound to have provided non -contractual support, as well as the resulting increase in the \ncapital charge (as noted above). The aim is to require AIFIs to hold capital against \nexposures for which they assume the credit risk, and to discourage them from providing non -\ncontractual suppor t.  \n \n(iv) If an AIFI is found to have provided implicit support on more than one occasion, the \nAIFI is required to disclose its transgression publicly and the Reserve Bank will take \nappropriate action that may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following:  \n(a) The AIFI may be prevented from gaining favourable capital treatment on \n                                            \n83 Annex 3 of the Guidelines on I mplementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India issued vide \ncircular DBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -2012 dated May 2, 2012  addressed to banks.   \n117 securitised assets for a period of time to be determined by the Reserve Bank;  \n(b) The AIFI may be required to hold capital against all securitised assets as \nthough the AIFI had c reated a commitment to them, by applying a conversion factor \nto the risk weight of the underlying assets;  \n(c) For purposes of capital calculations, the AIFI be required to treat all \nsecuritised assets as if they remained on the balance sheet; and \n(d) The AIFI may be required by the Reserve Bank to hold regulatory capital in \nexcess of the minimum risk -based capital ratios.  \n(v) During the SREP, Reserve Bank will determine implicit support and may take \nappropriate supervisory action to mitigate the effects. Pending any investigation, the AIFI \nmay be prohibited from any capital relief for planned securitisation transactions \n(moratorium). The action of Reserve Bank will be aimed at changing the AIFI\u2019s behaviour \nwith regard to the provision of implicit support, and to corre ct market perception as to the \nwillingness of the AIFI to provide future recourse beyond contractual obligations.  \n \n16.9.2  Reputational Risk on Account of Implicit Support  \n(i) Reputational risk can be defined as the risk arising from negative perception on the \npart o f customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors, debt -holders, market analysts, \nother relevant parties or regulators that can adversely affect a n AIFI's ability to maintain \nexisting, or establish new, business relationships and continued access to sou rces of \nfunding (e .g., through the interbank or securitisation markets). Reputational risk is \nmultidimensional and reflects the perception of other market participants. Furthermore, it \nexists throughout the organisation and exposure to reputational risk is  essentially a function \nof the adequacy of the AIFI's internal risk management processes, as well as the manner \nand efficiency with which management responds to external influences on AIFI -related \ntransactions.  \n(ii) In general, the AIFIs do not engage in the st ructuring and sale of highly innovative \nfinancial products that may raise reputational risk concerns due to possible mis -selling to \nclients. However, the AIFIs that have subsidiaries may be called upon to provide unexpected \ncapital or liquidity support to them in case the latter face financial/ liquidity stress. All the \nAIFIs are statutory organisations owned by government and public sector entities  (except  \nIDBI which has shareholding in SIDBI) . Owing to such ownership structure, the AIFIs\u2019 \nactivities could  potentially have implications for the reputation of the Government . The AIFIs \nneed to take into account these factors while conducting their affairs.  \n(iii) Reputational risk can lead to the provision of implicit support, which may give rise to \ncredit, liquidity , market and legal risk - all of which can have a negative impact on a n AIFI's \nearnings, liquidity and capital position. A n AIFI should identify potential sources of \nreputational risk to which it is exposed. These include the AIFI's business lines, liabili ties, \naffiliated operations, off -balance sheet vehicles and the markets in which it operates. The \nrisks that arise should be incorporated into the AIFI's risk management processes and \nappropriately addressed in its ICAAP and liquidity contingency plans.  \n(iv) Reputational risk also may affect a n AIFI's liabilities, since market confidence and a n \nAIFI's ability to fund its business are closely related to its reputation. For instance, to avoid \ndamaging its reputation, a n AIFI may call its liabilities even though th is might negatively \naffect its liquidity profile. This is particularly true for liabilities that are components of \nregulatory capital, such as hybrid / subordinated debt. In such cases, a n AIFI's capital \nposition is likely to suffer.  \n(v) AIFI management should  have appropriate policies in place to identify sources of \nreputational risk when entering new markets, products or lines of activities. In addition, a n  \n118 AIFI's stress testing procedures should take account of reputational risk so management has \na firm unde rstanding of the consequences and second round effects of reputational risk.  \n(vi) Once a n AIFI identifies potential exposures arising from reputational concerns, it \nshould measure the amount of support it might have to provide (including implicit support of \nsecuritisations) or losses it might experience under adverse market conditions. In particular, \nin order to avoid reputational damages and to maintain market confidence, a n AIFI should \ndevelop methodologies to measure as precisely as possible the effect of rep utational risk in \nterms of other risk types (eg credit, liquidity, market or operational risk) to which it may be \nexposed. This could be accomplished by including reputational risk scenarios in regular \nstress tests. For instance, non -contractual off -balanc e sheet exposures could be included in \nthe stress tests to determine the effect on a n AIFI's credit, market and liquidity risk profiles. \nMethodologies also could include comparing the actual amount of exposure carried on the \nbalance sheet versus the maximu m exposure amount held off -balance sheet, that is, the \npotential amount to which the AIFI could be exposed.  \n(vii) An AIFI should pay particular attention to the effects of reputational risk on its overall \nliquidity position, taking into account both possible inc reases in the asset side of the balance \nsheet and possible restrictions on funding, should the loss of reputation result in various \ncounterparties' loss of confidence.  \n(viii) In contrast to contractual credit exposures, such as guarantees, implicit support is a \nmore subtle form of exposure. Implicit support arises when a n AIFI provides post -sale \nsupport to a securitisation transaction in excess of any contractual obligation. Implicit support \nmay include any letter of comfort provided by the originator in respect o f the present or future \nliabilities of the SPV. Such non -contractual support exposes a n AIFI to the risk of loss, such \nas loss arising from deterioration in the credit quality of the securitisation's underlying assets.  \n \n(ix) By providing implicit support, a n AIFI signals to the market that all of the risks \ninherent in the securitised assets are still held by the organisation and, in effect, had not \nbeen transferred. Since the risk arising from the potential provision of implicit support is not \ncaptured ex ante u nder Pillar 1, it shall be considered as part of the Pillar 2 process. In \naddition, the processes for approving new products or strategic initiatives should consider \nthe potential provision of implicit support and should be incorporated in a n AIFI's ICAAP.  \n16.10  Risk Evaluation  and Management  \nAn AIFI should conduct analyses of the underlying risks when investing in the structured \nproducts (permitted by the Reserve Bank ) and shall not solely rely on the external credit \nratings assigned to securitisation exposures by the credit rating agencies. A n AIFI should be \naware that external ratings are a useful starting point for credit analysis, but are no substitute \nfor full and proper understanding of the underlying risk, especially where ratings for certain \nasset classes  have a short history or have been shown to be volatile. Moreover, a n AIFI also \nshould conduct credit analysis of the securitisation exposure at acquisition and on an \nongoing basis. It should also have in place the necessary quantitative tools, valuation \nmodels and stress tests of sufficient sophistication to reliably assess all relevant risks.  \n \nWhen assessing securitisation exposures, a n AIFI should ensure that it fully understands the \ncredit quality and risk characteristics of the underlying exposures in structured credit \ntransactions, including any risk concentrations. In addition, a n AIFI should review the \nmaturity of the exposures underlying structured credit transactions relative to the issued \nliabilities in order to assess potential maturity mismatche s. \n \nAn AIFI should track credit risk in securitisation exposures at the transaction level and \nacross securitisation exposures within each business line and across business lines. It  \n119 should produce reliable measures of aggregate risk. A n AIFI also should tr ack all meaningful \nconcentrations in securitisation exposures, such as name, product or sector concentrations, \nand feed this information to firm -wide risk aggregation systems that track, for example, credit \nexposure to a particular obligor.  \n \nAn AIFI\u2019s own assessment of risk needs to be based on a comprehensive understanding of \nthe structure of the securitisation transaction. It should identify the various types of triggers, \ncredit events and other legal provisions that may affect the performance of its on - and off -\nbalance sheet exposures and integrate these triggers and provisions into its funding/liquidity, \ncredit and balance sheet management. The impact of the events or triggers on a n AIFI\u2019s \nliquidity and capital position should also be considered.  \n \nAn AIF I should consider scenarios which may prevent it from securitising its assets as part of \nits stress testing and identify the potential effect of such exposures on its liquidity, earnings \nand capital adequacy.  \n \nAn AIFI should develop prudent contingency pla ns specifying how it would respond to \nfunding, capital and other pressures that arise when access to securitisation markets is \nreduced. The contingency plans should also address how the AIFI would address valuation \nchallenges for potentially illiquid posit ions held for sale or for trading. The risk measures, \nstress testing results and contingency plans should be incorporated into the AIFI\u2019s risk \nmanagement processes and its ICAAP, and should result in an appropriate level of capital \nunder Pillar 2 in excess  of the minimum requirements.  \n \nAn AIFI that employs risk mitigation techniques should fully understand the risks to be \nmitigated, the potential effects of that mitigation and whether or not the mitigation is fully \neffective. This is to help ensure that the  AIFI does not understate the true risk in its \nassessment of capital. In particular, it should consider whether it would provide support to \nthe securitisation structures in stressed scenarios due to the reliance on securitisation as a \nfunding tool.  \n \n16.11  Valuat ion Practices  \nThe characteristics of complex structured products, including securitisation transactions, \nmake their valuation inherently difficult due, in part, to the absence of active and liquid \nmarkets, the complexity and uniqueness of the cash waterfa lls, and the links between \nvaluations and underlying risk factors. The absence of a transparent price from a liquid \nmarket means that the valuation shall rely on models or proxy -pricing methodologies, as well \nas on expert judgment. The outputs of such mode ls and processes are highly sensitive to \nthe inputs and parameter assumptions adopted, which may themselves be subject to \nestimation error and uncertainty. Moreover, calibration of the valuation methodologies is \noften complicated by the lack of readily ava ilable benchmarks. Therefore, a n AIFI is \nexpected to have adequate governance structures and control processes for fair valuing \nexposures for risk management and financial reporting purposes. The valuation governance \nstructures and related processes should  be embedded in the overall governance structure of \nthe AIFI, and consistent for both risk management and reporting purposes. The governance \nstructures and processes are expected to explicitly cover the role of the Board  and senior \nmanagement. In addition,  the Board  should receive reports from senior management on the \nvaluation oversight and valuation model performance issues that are brought to senior \nmanagement for resolution, as well as all significant changes to valuation policies.  \n \n An AIFI should also  have clear and robust governance structures for the production, \nassignment and verification of financial instrument valuations. Policies should ensure that \nthe approvals of all valuation methodologies are well documented. In addition, policies and \nprocedu res should set forth the range of acceptable practices for the initial pricing, marking -\nto-market/model, valuation adjustments and periodic independent revaluation. New product  \n120 approval processes should include all internal stakeholders relevant to risk me asurement, \nrisk control, and the assignment and verification of valuations of financial instruments.  \n \nAn AIFI\u2019s control processes for measuring and reporting valuations should be consistently \napplied across the firm and integrated with risk measurement and  management processes. \nIn particular, valuation controls should be applied consistently across similar instruments \n(risks) and consistent across business lines (books). These controls should be subject to \ninternal audit. Regardless of the booking location of a new product, reviews and approval of \nvaluation methodologies shall be guided by a minimum set of considerations. Furthermore, \nthe valuation/new product approval process should be supported by a transparent, well -\ndocumented inventory of acceptable valu ation methodologies that are specific to products \nand businesses.  \n \nIn order to establish and verify valuations for instruments and transactions in which it \nengages, a n AIFI shall have adequate capacity, including during periods of stress. This \ncapacity sho uld be commensurate with the importance, riskiness and size of these \nexposures in the context of the business profile of the institution. In addition, for those \nexposures that represent material risk, a n AIFI is expected to have the capacity to produce \nvaluations using alternative methods in the event that primary inputs and approaches \nbecome unreliable, unavailable or not relevant due to market discontinuities or illiquidity. A n \nAIFI shall test and review the performance of its models under stress conditio ns so that it \nunderstands the limitations of the models under stress conditions.  \n \nThe relevance and reliability of valuations is directly related to the quality and reliability of the \ninputs. A n AIFI is expected to apply the accounting guidance provided to  determine the \nrelevant market information and other factors likely to have a material effect on an \ninstrument's fair value when selecting the appropriate inputs to use in the valuation process. \nWhere values are determined to be in an active market, a n AIFI should maximise the use of \nrelevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs when estimating fair \nvalue using a valuation technique. However, where a market is deemed inactive, observable \ninputs or transactions may not be relevant, s uch as in a forced liquidation or distress sale, or \ntransactions may not be observable, such as when markets are inactive. In such cases, \naccounting fair value guidance provides assistance on what should be considered, but may \nnot be determinative. In asse ssing whether a source is reliable and relevant, a n AIFI should \nconsider, among other things:  \n(i) the frequency and availability of the prices/quotes;  \n(ii) whether those prices represent actual regularly occurring transactions on an   arm's \nlength basis;  \n(iii) the breadt h of the distribution of the data and whether it is generally available to the \nrelevant participants in the market;  \n(iv) the timeliness of the information relative to the frequency of valuations;  \n(v) the number of independent sources that produce the quotes/prices;  \n(vi) whether the quotes/prices are supported by actual transactions;  \n(vii) the maturity of the market; and  \n(viii) the similarity  between the financial instrument sold in a transaction and the \ninstrument held by the institution.  \nAn AIFI\u2019s external reporting should provide t imely, relevant, reliable and decision useful \ninformation that promotes transparency. Senior management should consider whether \ndisclosures around valuation uncertainty can be made more meaningful. For instance, the \nAIFI may describe the modelling techniqu es and the instruments to which they are applied; \nthe sensitivity of fair values to modelling inputs and assumptions; and the impact of stress  \n121 scenarios on valuations. A n AIFI should regularly review its disclosure policies to ensure that \nthe information d isclosed continues to be relevant to its business model and products and to \ncurrent market conditions.  \n \n16.12  Sound Stress Testing Practices  \nStress testing is an important tool that is used by AIFIs as part of their internal risk \nmanagement that alerts AIFI management to adverse unexpected outcomes related to a \nbroad variety of risks  and provides an indication to AIFIs of how much capital might be \nneeded to absorb losses should large shocks occur. Moreover, stress testing supplements \nother risk management approa ches and measures. It plays a particularly important role in:  \n(i) providing forward looking assessments of risk,  \n(ii) overcoming limitations of models and historical data,  \n(iii) supporting internal and external communication,  \n(iv) feeding into capital and liquidity planning p rocedures,  \n(v) informing the setting of a AIFIs\u2019 risk tolerance,  \n(vi) addressing existing or potential, firm -wide risk concentrations, and  \n(vii) facilitating the development of risk mitigation or contingency plans across a range of \nstressed conditions.  \nStress testing is especially important after long periods of benign risk, when the fading \nmemory of negative economic conditions can lead to complacency and the underpricing of \nrisk, and when innovation leads to the rapid growth of new products for which there is limited \nor no loss data.  \n \nIt should be recognised that improvements in stress testing alone cannot address all risk \nmanagement weaknesses, but as part of a comprehensive approach, stress testing has a \nleading role to play in strengthening corporate governance and th e resilience of individual \nAIFIs and the financial system.  \n \nStress testing should form an integral part of the overall governance and risk management \nculture of the AIFI. Board and senior management involvement in setting stress testing \nobjectives, definin g scenarios, discussing the results of stress tests, assessing potential \nactions and decision making is critical in ensuring the appropriate use of stress testing in \nAIFIs\u2019 risk governance and capital planning. Senior management should take an active \ninterest in the development , and operation of, stress testing. The results of stress tests \nshould contribute to strategic decision making and foster internal debate regarding \nassumptions, such as the cost, risk and speed with which new capital could be raised or \nwhat positions could be hedged or sold. Board and senior management involvement in the \nstress testing program is essential for its effective operation.  \n \nAn AIFI\u2019s capital planning process should incorporate rigorous; forward looking stress testing \nthat identifies possible events or changes in market conditions that could adversely impact \nthe AIFI. AIFIs, under their ICAAPs should examine future capital resources and capital \nrequirements under adverse scenarios. In particular, the results of forward -looking stress \ntesting should be considered when evaluating the adequacy of a n AIFI\u2019s capital buffer. \nCapital adequacy should be assessed under stressed conditions against a variety of capital \nratios, including regulatory ratios, as well as ratios based on the AIFI\u2019s internal definition of \ncapital resources. In addition, the possibility that a crisis impairs the ability of even a healthy \nfinancial entity  to raise funds at reasonable cost should be considered.  \n \nAn AIFI should develop methodologies to measure the effect of reputational risk in terms of \nother risk types, namely credit, liquidity, market and other risks that they may be exposed to  \n122 in order to avoid reputational damages and in order to maintain market confidence. This \ncould be done by including reputa tional risk scenarios in regular stress tests. For instance, \nincluding non -contractual off -balance sheet exposures in the stress tests to determine the \neffect on a n AIFI\u2019s credit, market and liquidity risk profiles.  \n \n An AIFI should carefully assess the r isks with respect to commitments to off -balance sheet \nvehicles and third -party firms related to structured credit securities and the possibility that \nassets will need to be taken on balance sheet for reputational reasons. Therefore, in its \nstress testing p rogramme, a n AIFI should include scenarios assessing the size and \nsoundness of such vehicles and firms relative to its own financial, liquidity and regulatory \ncapital positions. This analysis should include structural, solvency, liquidity and other risk \nissues, including the effects of covenants and triggers.  \n \n16.13  Compensation Practices  \nRisk management shall be embedded in the culture of an AIFI. It should be a critical focus of \nthe CEO/Managing Director, Chief Risk Officer (CRO), senior management, trading des k \nand other business line heads and employees in making strategic and day -to-day decisions. \nFor a broad and deep risk management culture to develop and be maintained over time, \ncompensation policies shall not be unduly linked to short term accounting profi t generation. \nCompensation policies should be linked to longer term capital preservation and the financial \nstrength of the firm and should consider risk -adjusted performance measures. In addition, a n \nAIFI should provide adequate disclosure regarding its co mpensation policies to \nstakeholders. Each AIFI\u2019s board of directors and senior management have the responsibility \nto mitigate the risks arising from remuneration policies in order to ensure effective firm -wide \nrisk management.   \nCompensation practices at la rge financial institutions are one factor among many that \ncontributed to the financial crisis that began in 2007. High short -term profits led to generous \nbonus payments to employees without adequate regard to the longer -term risks they \nimposed on their fir ms. These incentives amplified the excessive risk  taking that has \nthreatened the global financial system and left firms with fewer resources to absorb losses \nas risks materialised. The lack of attention to risk also contributed to the large, in some \ncases extreme absolute level of compensation in the industry. As a result, to improve \ncompensation practices and strengthen supervision in this area, particularly for systemically \nimportant firms, the Financial Stability Board (formerly the Financial Stability F orum) \npublished its Principles for Sound Compensation Practices in April 2009.  \nAn AIFI\u2019s Board shall actively oversee the compensation system\u2019s design and operation, \nwhich should not be controlled primarily by the chief executive officer and management \nteam. Relevant board members and employees shall have independence and expertise in \nrisk management and compensation. In addition, the Board  shall monitor and review the \ncompensation system to ensure the system includes adequate controls and operates as \nintended. The practical operation of the system should be regularly reviewed to ensure \ncompliance with policies and procedures. Compensation outcomes, risk measurements, and \nrisk outcomes should be regularly reviewed f or consistency with intentions.  \nStaff that  are engaged in the financial and risk control areas shall be independent, have \nappropriate authority, and be compensated in a manner that is independent of the business \nareas they oversee and commensurate with their key role in the firm. Effective indepen dence \nand appropriate authority of such staff is necessary to preserve the integrity of financial and \nrisk management\u2019s influ ence on incentive compensation.  \nCompensation shall be adjusted for all types of risk so that remuneration is balanced \nbetween the p rofit earned and the degree of risk assumed in generating the profit. In \ngeneral, both quantitative measures and human judgment should play a role in determining \nthe appropriate risk adjustments, including those that are difficult to measure such as \nliquidity risk and reputation risk.   \n123 Compensation outcomes shall be symmetric with risk outcomes and compensation systems \nshould link the size of the bonus pool to the overall performance of the firm. Employees\u2019 \nincentive payments should be linked to the contribu tion of the individual and business to the \nfirm\u2019s overall performance.  \nCompensation payout schedules shall be sensitive to the time horizon of risks. Profits and \nlosses of different activities of a financial firm are realised over different periods of tim e. \nVariable compensation payments should be deferred accordingly. Payments should not be \nfinalised over short periods where risks are realised over long periods. Management should \nquestion payouts for income that cannot be realised or whose likelihood of r ealisation \nremains uncertain at the time of payout.  \nThe mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation shall be consistent with risk \nalignment. The mix will vary depending on the employee\u2019s position and role. The firm should \nbe able to explain the ra tionale for its mix.  \nThe Reserve Bank  will review compensation practices in a rigorous and sustained manner \nand deficiencies, if any, will be addressed promptly with the appropriate supervisory action.  \n \nThe risk factors discussed above shall not be consid ered an exhaustive list  of those affecting \nany given AIFI. All relevant factors that present a material source of risk to capital should be \nincorporated in a well -developed ICAAP. Furthermore, AIFIs should be mindful of the capital \nadequacy effects of conc entrations that may arise within each risk type.  \n \n16.14  Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches in ICAAP  \n(i) All measurements of risk incorporate both quantitative and qualitative elements, but \nto the extent possible, a quantitative approach should form the foundati on of a n AIFI\u2019s \nmeasurement framework. In some cases, quantitative tools can include the use of large \nhistorical databases; when data are more scarce, a n AIFI may choose to rely more heavily \non the use of stress testing and scenario analyses. AIFIs should understand when \nmeasuring risks that measurement error always exists, and in many cases the error is itself \ndifficult to quantify. In general, an increase in uncertainty related to modeling and business \ncomplexity should result in a larger capital cushion.  \n(ii) Quantitative approaches that focus on most likely outcomes for budgeting, \nforecasting, or performance measurement purposes may not be fully applicable for capital \nadequacy because the ICAAP should also take less likely events into account. Stress testing \nand scenario analysis can be effective in gauging the consequences of outcomes that are \nunlikely but would have a considerable impact on safety and soundness.  \n(iii) To the extent that risks cannot be reliably measured with quantitative tools \u2013 for \nexample, where  measurements of risk are based on scarce data or unproven quantitative \nmethods \u2013 qualitative tools, including experience and judgment, may be more heavily \nutilised. AIFIs should be cognisant that qualitative approaches have their own inherent \nbiases and a ssumptions that affect risk assessment; accordingly, AIFIs should recognise the \nbiases and assumptions embedded in, and the limitations of, the qualitative approaches \nused.  \n \n16.15  Risk Aggregation and Diversification Effects  \n(i) An effective ICAAP should assess the  risks across the entire AIFI. An AIFI choosing \nto conduct risk aggregation among various risk types or business lines should understand \nthe challenges in such aggregation. In addition, when aggregating risks, AIFIs should ensure \nthat any potential concent rations across more than one risk dimension are addressed, \nrecognising that losses could arise in several risk dimensions at the same time, stemming \nfrom the same event or a common set of factors. For example, a localised natural disaster \ncould generate lo sses from credit, market, and operational risks at the same time.   \n124  \n(ii) In considering the possible effects of diversification, management should be \nsystematic and rigorous in documenting decisions, and in identifying assumptions used in \neach level of risk aggr egation. Assumptions about diversification should be supported by \nanalysis and evidence. The AIFI should have systems capable of aggregating risks based on \nthe AIFI\u2019s selected framework. For example, a n AIFI calculating correlations within or among \nrisk ty pes should consider data quality and consistency, and the volatility of correlations over \ntime and under stressed market conditions.  \n \n(iii) AIFIs may undertake new activities including the ones which are only indirectly \nrelated to their statutory mandates. Norma lly AIFIs would not have prior expertise in these \nareas. Due care needs to be taken to identify and manage the strategic risks arising from \ntaking new initiatives , e.g., expanding the scope of their refinance activities to  a new set of \ninstitutions  and des igning new refinance products, new investment/ financial products, \nentering into partnership with banks to introduce new products , etc. \n  \n125 Part C: Market Discipline  \n17. Guidelines on Market Discipline  \n17.1 General  \n17.1.1  The purpose of Market discipline is to complement th e minimum capital requirements \n(detailed under Pillar 1) and the supervisory review process (detailed under Pillar 2). The \naim is to encourage market discipline by developing a set of disclosure requirements which \nwill allow market participants to assess k ey pieces of information on the scope of application, \ncapital, risk exposures, risk assessment processes and hence , the capital adequacy of the \ninstitution.  \n \n17.1.2  In principle, AIFI\u2019s disclosures should be consistent with how senior management \nand the Board ass ess and manage the risks of the AIFI. Under Pillar 1, AIFIs use specified \napproaches  / methodologies for measuring the various risks they face and the resulting \ncapital requirements. It is believed that providing disclosures that are based on a common \nframework is an effective means of informing the market about a n AIFI\u2019s exposure to those \nrisks and provides a consistent and comprehensive disclosure framework that enhances \ncomparability . \n \n17.2 Achieving Appropriate Disclosure  \n17.2.1  Market discipline can contribute to a safe and sound banking /financial sector \nenvironment. Hence, non -compliance with the prescribed disclosure requirements would \nattract a penalty, including financial penalty. However, it is not intended that direct additional \ncapital requirements would be a response to non -disclosure, except as indicated below.  \n \n17.2.2  In addition to the general intervention measures, the Basel Capital Adequacy \nFramework also anticipates a role for specific measures. Where disclosure is a qualifying \ncriterion under Pillar 1 to obt ain lower risk weightings and/or to apply specific methodologies, \nthere would be a direct sanction (not being allowed to apply the lower risk weighting or the \nspecific methodology).  \n \n17.3 Interaction with Accounting Disclosures   \nIt is recognised that the Pillar  3 disclosure framework does not conflict with requirements \nunder accounting standards, which are broader in scope. The BCBS has taken considerable \nefforts to see that the narrower focus of Pillar 3, which is aimed at disclosure of AIFI capital \nadequacy, d oes not conflict with the broader accounting requirements. The Reserve Bank \nwill consider future modifications to the Market Discipline disclosures as necessary in light of \nits ongoing monitoring of this area and industry developments.  \n \n17.4 Validation  \nThe disc losures in this manner should be subjected to adequate validation. For example, \nsince information in the annual financial statements would generally be audited, the \nadditional material published with such statements shall be consistent with the audited \nstatements. In addition, supplementary material (such as Management\u2019s Discussion and \nAnalysis) that is published should also be subjected to sufficient scrutiny (e.g. , internal \ncontrol assessments, etc.) to satisfy the validation issue. If material is not pub lished under a \nvalidation regime, for instance in a stand -alone report or as a section on a website, then \nmanagement should ensure that appropriate verification of the information takes place, in \naccordance with the general disclosure principle set out bel ow. In the light of the above, \nPillar 3 disclosures will not be required to be audited by an external auditor, unless specified.  \n \n  \n126  \n17.5 Materiality  \nAn AIFI should decide which disclosures are relevant for it based on the materiality concept. \nInformation would be regarded as material if its omission or misstatement could change or \ninfluence the assessment or decision of a user relying on that information for the purpose of \nmaking economic decisions. This definition is consistent with International Accounting \nStandards and with the national accounting framework. The Reserve Bank recognises the \nneed for a qualitative judgment of whether, in light of the particular circumstances, a user of \nfinancial information would consider the item to be material (user test). The  Reserve Bank \ndoes not consider it necessary to set specific thresholds for disclosure as the user test is a \nuseful benchmark for achieving sufficient disclosure. However, with a view to facilitate \nsmooth transition to greater disclosures as well as to pro mote greater comparability among \nthe AIFIs\u2019 Pillar 3 disclosures, the materiality thresholds have been prescribed for certain \nlimited disclosures. Notwithstanding the above, AIFIs are encouraged to apply the user test \nto these specific disclosures and wher e considered necessary make disclosures below the \nspecified thresholds also.  \n \n17.6 Proprietary and Confidential Information  \nProprietary information encompasses information (for example on products or systems), that \nif shared with competitors would render a n AIFI\u2019s investment in these products/systems less \nvaluable, and hence would undermine its competitive position. Information about customers \nis often confidential, in that it is provided under the terms of a legal agreement or \ncounterparty relationship. This h as an impact on what AIFIs should reveal in terms of \ninformation about their customer base, as well as details on their internal arrangements, for \ninstance methodologies used, parameter estimates, data etc. The Reserve Bank believes \nthat the requirements s et out below strike an appropriate balance between the need for \nmeaningful disclosure and the protection of proprietary and confidential information.  \n \n17.7 General Disclosure Principle  \nAIFIs should have a formal disclosure policy approved by the Board that add resses the \nAIFI\u2019s approach for determining what disclosures it will make and the internal controls over \nthe disclosure process. In addition, AIFIs should implement a process for assessing the \nappropriateness of their disclosures, including validation and f requency.  \n \n17.8 Implementation  Date  \nThe AIFIs shall make their first set of disclosures under Basel III with reference to the \nposition as of June 30 , 2024 (September 30 , 2024 in case of NHB).  \n \n17.9 Scope and Frequency of Disclosures  \n17.9.1  Pillar 3 applies at the top cons olidated level of the group  to which the Capital \nAdequacy Framework applies .  \n17.9.2  AIFIs are required to make Pillar 3  disclosure s84 at least on a half yearly basis, \nirrespective of whether financial statements are audited, with the exception of following \ndisclo sures:  \n(i) Table DF -2: Capital Adequacy;  \n(ii) Table DF -3: Credit Risk: General Disclosures for All AIFIs; and  \n(iii) Table DF -4: Credit Risk: Disclosures for Portfolios subject to the Standardised \nApproach.  \nThe disclosures as indicated at (i), (ii) and (iii) above will  be made at least on a quarterly \nbasis by AIFIs.  \n                                            \n84 Please refer to Annex 16  for detailed Pillar 3 disclosure templates.   \n127 17.9.3  All disclosures shall either be included in a n AIFI\u2019s published financial results / \nstatements or, at a minimum, shall be disclosed on AIFI\u2019s website. If a n AIFI finds it \noperationally inconvenient to make these disclosures along with published financial results / \nstatements, the AIFI shall provide in these financial results / statements , a direct link to \nwhere the Pillar 3 disclosures can be found on the AIFI\u2019s website. The Pillar 3 disclosures \nshould be ma de concurrent with publication of financial results / statements.  \n \n17.9.4  However, AIFIs may note that in the case of main features template (as indicated in \nsection  17.13.7) and provision of the full terms and conditions of capital instruments (as \nindicated in section  17.13.8), AIFIs are required to update these disclosures concurrently \nwhenever a new capital instrument is issued and included in capital or whenever there is a \nredemption, conversion / write -down or other material change in the nature of an existin g \ncapital instrument.  \n \n17.10  Regulatory Disclosure Section  \n17.10.1  AIFIs are required to make disclosures in the format as specified  in Annex 16  of \nthis Chapter . AIFIs have to maintain a \u2018Regulatory Disclosures Section\u2019 on their websites, \nwhere all the information relating to disclosure s will be made availabl e to the market \nparticipants. The direct link to this page should be prominently provided on the home page of \nan AIFI\u2019s website and it should be easily accessible. This requirement is ess entially to \nensure that the relevance / benefit of Pillar 3 disclosures is not diminished by the challenge \nof finding the disclosure in the first place.  \n \n17.10.2  An archive for at least three years of all templates relating to prior reporting \nperiods should be mad e available by AIFIs on their websites.  \n \n17.11  Pillar  3 under Basel III Framework   \n17.11.1  The Pillar 3 disclosure requirements under Basel III Framework are set out in the \nform of following templates:  \n17.11.1.1  Disclosure Template  \nA common template which will be used by AIFIs to report the details of their regulatory \ncapital. It is designed to meet the Basel III requirement to disclose all regulatory \nadjustments. The template enhances consistency and comparability in the disclosure of the \nelements of capital between AIFIs and ac ross jurisdictions.  \n \n17.11.1.2  Reconciliation Requirements  \nIn order to meet the reconciliation requirements as envisaged under Basel III, a three -step \napproach has been devised. This step -by-step approach to reconciliation ensures that the \nBasel III requirement to provide a full reconciliation of all regulatory capital elements back to \nthe published financial statements is met  in a consistent manner . \n \n17.11.1.3  Main Features Template  \nA common template has been designed to capture the main features of all regulatory capital \ninstruments issued by a n AIFI at one place. This disclosure requirement is intended to meet \nthe Basel III requirement to provide a description of the main f eatures of capital instruments.  \n \n17.11.1.4  Other Disclosure Requirements  \nThis disclosure enables AIFIs in meetin g the Basel III requirement to provide the full terms \nand conditions of capital instruments on their websites.  \n17.11.1.5  Pillar 3 disclosure requirements also include  certain aspects that are not  \n128 specifically required to compute capital requirements under Pillar 1. It may be noted that \nbeyond disclosure requirements as set forth in these guidelines, AIFIs are responsible for \nconveying their actual risk profile to market participants. The information AIFIs disclose shall \nbe adequate to fulfill this objective. In addit ion to the specific disclosure requirements as set \nout in the guidelines, AIFIs should also make additional disclosures in the following areas:  \n(i) Securitisation exposures in the trading book;  \n(ii) Sponsorship of off -balance sheet vehicles;  \n(iii) Valuation with regard t o securitisation ex posures; and  \n(iv) Pipeline and warehousing risks with regard to securitisation exposures.  \n \n17.12  Disclosure Template  \n17.12.1  The common template which AIFIs should use is set out in Table DF-11 of Annex \n16, along with expla nations. The template is designed to capture the capital positions of \nAIFIs.  \n17.12.2  It may be noted that AIFIs should not add or delete any rows / columns from the \ncommon reporting template. This is essential to ensure that there is no divergence in  \nreporting templates across financial entities falling under the Basel III framework  across \njurisdictions which could undermine the objectives of consistency and comparability of their \nregulatory capital.  \n17.12.3  The Basel Committee has suggested that in cases whe re the national \nimplementation of Basel III rules85 applies a more conservative definition of an element (e.g. , \ncomponents and criteria of regulatory capital, regulatory adjustments etc.), national \nauthorities may choose between one of the two approaches li sted below for the purpose of \ndisclosure:  \nApproach 1:  In the national version of the template, AIFIs are required to maintain the same \ndefinitions86 of all rows. Further, AIFIs will have to report the impact of the more conservative \nnational definition in t he rows exclusively designated for national specific adjustments.  \nApproach 2:  In the national version of the template, AIFIs are required to use the definitions \nof elements as implemented in that jurisdiction87, clearly labelling them as being different \nfrom the Basel III minimum definition88, and AIFIs are required to separately disclose the \nimpact of each of these different definitions in the notes to the template.  \n17.12.4  The aim of both the approaches is to provide all the information necessary to \nenable market  participants to calculate the capital of AIFIs on a common basis. In the Indian \ncontext, Approach 2 appears to be more practical and less burdensome for AIFIs than the \nApproach 1. Under the Approach 2, AIFIs have to furnish data based on the definition of  \ncapital / regulatory adjustments as implemented in India. The difference with the Basel III \nminimum can be separately disclosed and explained in notes to the templates. This way of \ndisclosure will be more relevant and comprehensible to a larger number of users of \ndisclosures more specifically, the domestic users. At the same time, information provided in \nthe notes to the templates to indicate differences from Basel III minimum will help facilitate \ncross -jurisdictional comparison of AIFIs\u2019 capital, should u sers desire. Accordingly, the \ndisclosure templates have been customised, keeping in view the consistency and \ncomparability of disclosures.  \n                                            \n85 As defined in the DBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -12 dated May 2, 2012  addressed to banks  \non Guidelines on Implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India.  \n86 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems, Dece mber \n2010 (rev June 2011) .  \n87As defined in the DBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -12 dated May 2, 2012  addressed to banks  \non Guidelines on Implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India.  \n88Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient b anks and banking systems, December \n2010 (rev June 2011) .    \n129  \n17.13  Reconciliation Requirements  \n17.13.1  AIFIs will be required to disclose a full reconciliation of all regulatory capital \neleme nts back to the balance sheet in the audited (or unaudited) financial statements. This \nrequirement aims to address disconnect, if any, present in a n AIFI\u2019s disclosure between the \nnumbers used for the calculation of regulatory capital and the numbers used i n the balance \nsheet.   \n17.13.2  AIFIs will have to follow a three  step approach to show the link between their \nbalance sheet and the numbers which are used in the composition of capital disclosure \ntemplate set o ut in Annex  16 (Table DF-11). The three steps are explained below and also \nillustrated in Table DF-12 of Annex 16 : \nStep 1:  AIFIs are required to disclose the reported balance sheet under the regulatory scope \nof consolidat ion89 (Table DF-12 of Annex 16 ); \nStep 2:  AIFIs will have to expand the lines of the balance sheet under regulatory scope of \nconsolidatio n (Table DF-12 of Annex 16 ) to display all components which are used in the \ncomposition of capital disclosure template ( Table DF-11 of Annex 16 ); and  \n \nStep 3:  Finally, AIFIs will have to map each of the components that are disclosed in Step 2  \nto the composition of capital disclosure templa te set out in Table DF-11 of Annex 16 . \n \n17.13.3  Step 1: Disclose  the reported balance sheet under the regulatory scope of \nconsolidation  \n(i) The scope of consolidation for acco unting purposes is often different from that \napplied for the regulatory purposes. Usually, there will be difference between the \nfinancial statements of a n AIFI specifically, the AIFI\u2019s balance sheet in published \nfinancial statements and the balance sheet c onsidered for the calculation of \nregulatory capital. Therefore, the reconciliation process involves disclosing how the \nbalance sheet changes when the regulatory scope of consolidation is applied for the \npurpose of calculation of regulatory capital on a con solidated basis.  \n \n(ii) Accordingly, AIFIs are required to disclose the list of the legal entities which have \nbeen included within accounting scope of consolidation but excluded from the \nregulatory scope of consolidation. This is intended to enable market parti cipants and \nsupervisors to investigate the risks posed by unconsolidated entities (e.g. , \nunconsolidated subsidiaries). Similarly, AIFIs are required to list the legal entities \nwhich have been included in the regulatory consolidation but not in the accounti ng \nscope of consolidation. Finally, it is possible that some entities are included in both \nthe regulatory scope of consolidation and accounting scope of consolidation, but the \nmethod of consolidation differs between these two scopes. In such cases, AIFIs are \nrequired to list these legal entities and explain the differences in the consolidation \nmethods.  \n \n(iii) If the scope of regulatory consolidation and accounting consolidation is identical for a \nparticular group, it would not be required to undertake Step 1. Th e group would state \nthat there is no difference between the regulatory consolidation and the accounting \nconsolidation and move to Step 2.  \n \n                                            \n89 Regulatory scope of consolidation is explained in section 6  of this Chapter .  \n  \n130 (iv) In addition to the above requirements, AIFIs shall disclose for each legal entity, its \ntotal balance sheet assets, t otal balance sheet equity (as stated on the accounting \nbalance sheet of the legal entity), method of consolidation and a description of the \nprinciple activities of the entity. These disclosures are required to be made as \nindicated in the revised templates namely Table DF -1: Scope of Application of Annex \n16.   \n \n17.13.4  Step 2: Expand the lines of the regulatory balance sheet to display all of the \ncomponents used in the definition of capital disclosure template ( Table DF -11 of \nAnnex 16 ) \n \n(i) Many of the elements used in the calculation of regulatory capital may not be readily \nidentified from the face of the balance sheet. This requires that AIFIs should expand the \nrows of the balance sh eet under regulatory scope  of consolidation such that all the \ncomponents used in the definition of capital disclosure template ( Table DF -11 of Annex 16 ) \nare displayed separately.  \n \n(ii) For example, paid -up share  capital may be reported as one line on the balance \nsheet. However, some elements of this may meet the requirements for inclusion in Common \nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) capital and other elements may only meet the requirements for \nAdditional Tier 1 (AT1) or Tier 2  (T2) capital, or may not meet the requirements for inclusion \nin regulatory capital at all. Therefore, if a n AIFI has some amount of paid -up capital which \ngoes into the calculation of CET1 and some amount which goes into the calculation of AT1, \nit should e xpand the \u2018paid -up share capital\u2019 line of the balance sheet in the following way:  \n \nPaid-up share capital   Ref \n    of which amount eligible for CET1   e \n    of which amount eligible for AT1   f \n \n(iii) In addition, as illustrated above, each element of th e expanded balance sheet shall \nbe given a reference number / letter for use in Step 3.  \n \n(iv) Another example is regulatory adjustments of the deduction of intangible assets. \nFirstly, there could be a possibility that the intangible assets may not be readil y identifiable in \nthe balance sheet. There is a possibility that the amount on the balance sheet may combine \ngoodwill and other intangibles. Secondly,  the amount to be deducted is net of any related \ndeferred tax liability. This deferred tax liability is li kely to be reported in combination with \nother deferred tax liabilities which have no relation to goodwill or intangibles. Therefore, the \nAIFI should expand the balance sheet in the following way:  \n \nGoodwill and intangible assets   Ref \n   of which goodwill   a \n   of which other intangibles   b \n \nCurrent and deferred tax liabilities (DTLs)   Ref \n     of which DTLs related to goodwill   c \n     of which DTLs related to other  intangible                         \nassets   d \n \n(v) AIFIs will need to expand elemen ts of the balance sheet only to the extent required to \nreach the components which are used in the definition of capital disclosure template. For \nexample, if entire paid -up capital of the AIFI met the requirements to be included in CET1, \nthe AIFI would not need to expand this line.  \n \n  \n131 17.13.5  Step 3: Map each of the components that are disclosed in Step 2 to the \ncomposition of capital disclosure templates  \n(i) When reporting the disclosure templa te (i.e. , Table DF -11 of Anne x 16), an AIFI is \nrequired to use the reference numbers / letters from Step 2 to show the source of every \ninput.  \n \n(ii) For example, if the composition of capital disclosure te mplate ( Table DF -11 of Annex \n16) includes the line \u2018goodwill net  of related deferred tax liability\u2019, then next to this item the \nAIFI should put \u2018a - c\u2019. This is required to illustrate that how these components of the balance \nsheet under the regulatory scope of consolidation have been used to calculate this item in \nthe disclosure template.  \n  \n17.13.6  The three step approach is flexible and offers the following benefits:  \n(i) the level of disclosure is proportionate, varying with the complexity of the balance \nsheet of the reporting AIFI (i.e., AIFIs are n ot subject to a fixed template . An AIFI may skip a \nstep if there is no further information added by that step ); \n \n(ii) supervisors and market participants can trace the origin of the elements of the \nregulatory capital back to their exact location on the balance sheet under the regulatory \nscope of consolidation; and   \n \n(iii) the approach is flexible enough to be used under any accounting standards. AIFIs \nare required to map all the components of the regulatory capital disclosure templates back to \nthe balance sheet under  the regulatory scope of consolidation, regardless of where the \naccounting standards require the source to be reported on the balance sheet.  \n \n17.13.7  Main Features Template  \n17.13.7.1  AIFIs are required to complete a \u2018main features template\u2019 to ensure \nconsistency and compar ability of disclosures of the main features of capital instruments.  \nAIFIs are required to disclose a description of the main features of capital instruments issued \nby them. Besides, AIFIs will also be required to make available the full terms and condition s \nof their capital instruments ( section  17.13.8 below). The requirement of separately disclosing \nmain features of capital instruments is intended to provide an overview of the capital \nstructure. Many times, it may not be possible for the users to extract k ey features of capital \ninstruments with ease from the full disclosure of terms and conditions of capital instruments.  \n \n17.13.7.2  This template represents the minimum level of summary disclosure which are \nrequired to be report ed in respect of each regulatory capital  instrument issued. The main \nfeature disclosure template is set out in Table DF-13 of Annex 16  along with a description of \neach of the items to be reported.  Some of the key aspects of the \u2018M ain Features Template\u2019 \nare as under : \n(i) it is designed to be completed by AIFIs from when the Basel III capital regulations \ncome into effect . \n \n(ii) AIFIs are required to report each capital instrument (including common shares) in a \nseparate column of the template, such that the completed tem plate would provide a \u2018main \nfeatures report\u2019 that summarises all of the regulatory capital instruments of the group.  \n \n17.13.7.3  AIFIs are required to keep the completed main features report up -to-date. \nAIFIs should ensure that the report is updated and made publicly  available, whenever a \ncapital instrument  is issued or repaid  and whenever there is redemption, conversion / write -\ndown or other material change in the nature of an existing capital instrument.  \n  \n132 17.13.8  Other Disclosure Requirements  \nIn addition to the disclosure requirements set out in above section s, AIFIs are required to \nmake the following disclosure in respect of the composition of capital:  \n \n(i) Full Terms and Conditions : AIFIs are required to make available on their websites90 \nthe full terms and conditions of all i nstruments included in regulatory capital. The \nrequirement for AIFIs to make available the full terms and conditions of instruments on their \nwebsites will allow supervisors and market participants to investigate the specific features of \nindividual capital instruments.  \n \n(ii) AIFIs are required to keep the terms and conditions of all capital instruments up -to-\ndate (Table DF -14 of Annex 16 ). Whenever there is a change in the terms a nd conditions of \na capital instrument, AIFIs should update them promptly and make publicly available such \nupdated disclosure.  \n \n17.14  The Disclosure Templates  \nAll Pi llar 3 disclosure templates as set out in these guidelines are furnished in tabular form in \nAnnex 16 . Additional relevant definitions and explanations are also provided for the Pillar 3 \ndisclosures.  \n \n                                            \n90 Please refer to section 17.10  of this Chapter .   \n133  \nPart D: Leverage Ratio  Framework91 \n18. Leverage Ratio   \n18.1 Rationale and Objective  \nAn underlying cause of the global financial crisis was the build -up of excessive on - and off -\nbalance sheet leverage in the banking system. In many cases, banks built up excessive \nleverage while apparently maintaining strong risk -based capital ratios. During the most \nsevere part of the crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its leverage \nin a manner that amplified downward pressure on asset prices. This deleveraging process \nexacerbated the feedback loop between losses, falling bank capital and contraction in credit \navailability. Therefore, under Basel III, a simple, transparen t, non -risk based leverage ratio \nhas been introduced. The leverage ratio is calibrated to act as a credible supplementary \nmeasure to the risk based capital requirements and is intended to achieve the following \nobjectives:  \n(i) constrain the build -up of leverag e in the banking sector to avoid destabilising \ndeleveraging processes which can damage the broader financial system and the economy; \nand  \n \n(ii) reinforce the risk -based requirements with a simple, non -risk based \u201cbackstop\u201d \nmeasure.  \n \n18.2 Definition , Minimum Require ment and Scope of Application of the Leverage \nRatio  \n18.2.1  Definition and minimum  requirement  \n(i) The Basel III leverage ratio is defined as the capital measure (the numerator) divided \nby the exposure measure (the denominator), with this ratio expressed as a percen tage \n \n \n \n(ii) AIFIs shall  maintain  minimum  leverage rat io of 4%. Both the capital measure and the \nexposure measure along with Leverage Ratio are to be disclosed on a quarter -end basis. \nHowever, AIFIs must meet the minimum Leverage Ratio requirement at all times  (on an \nongoing basis) . \n \n18.2.2  Scope of consolidation  \n(i) The Basel III leverage ratio framework follows the same scope of regulatory \nconsolidation as is used for the risk -based capital framework92. \n \n(ii) Treatment of investments in the capital of banking, financial, insu rance and \ncommercial entities that are outside the regulatory scope of consolidation : in cases where a \nbanking , financial, insurance or commercial entity is outside the scope of regulatory \nconsolidation, only the investment in the capital of such entities (i.e., only the carrying value \n                                            \n91 Please refer to Annex 5 of Guidelines on Implementation of Basel  III Capital Regulations in India \nissued vide circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.98/21.06.201/2011 -12 dated May 2, 2012  addresses to banks . \n92 Please refer to section 6 : Scope of Application of Capital Adequacy Framework .

However, investments in the \ncapital of such entities that are deducted from  Tier 1 capital (i.e. , either deduction from \nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital or deduction from Additional Tier 1 capital following \ncorresponding deduction approach) as set out in section  7.5 \u2013 Regulatory Adjustments / \nDeductions93 of this Chapter  may be exclud ed from the leverage ratio exposure measure.  \n \n18.3 Capital  Measure  \nThe capital measure for the leverage ratio is the Tier 1 capital of the risk -based capital \nframework94, taking into account various regulatory adjustments / deductions and the \ntransitional arrang ements. In other words, the capital measure used for the leverage ratio at \nany particular point in time is the Tier 1 capital measure applying at that time under the risk -\nbased framework.  \n \n18.4 Exposure Measure   \n18.4.1  General Measurement Principles  \n(i) The exposure meas ure for the leverage ratio should generally follow the accounting \nvalue, subject to the following:  \n(ii) On-balance sheet, non -derivative exposures are included in the exposure measure  \nnet  of specific provisions or accounting valuation adjustments (e.g. , accou nting credit \nvaluation adjustments,  prudent valuation adjustments for AFS and HFT positions);  \n(iii) netting of loans and deposits is not allowed.  \n(iv) Unless specified differently below, AIFIs shall not take account of physical or \nfinancial collateral, guarantees or  other credit risk mitigation techniques to reduce the \nexposure measure.  \n(v) An AIFI\u2019s total exposure measure is the sum of the following exposures:  \n(a) on-balance sheet exposures;  \n(b) derivative exposures;  \n(c) securities financing transaction (SFT) exposures; and  \n(d) off- balance sheet (OBS) items.  \nThe specific treatments for these four main exposure types are defined in section s 18.4.2 to \n18.4.5 below.  \n \n18.4.2  On-balance sheet exposures  \n18.4.2.1  AIFIs shall include all balance sheet assets in their exposure measure, \nincluding on -balance sheet  derivatives collateral and collateral for SFTs, with the exception \nof on -balance sheet derivative and SFT assets that are covered in sections  18.4.3 and \n18.4.4 below95. \n \n18.4.2.2  However, to ensure consistency, balance sheet assets deducted from Tier 1 \ncapital  as set out in section 7 .4 - Regulatory Adjustments / Deductions may be deducted \n                                            \n93 Regulatory adjustments / deductions as indicated in section 7 .5.  \n94 Tier 1 capital as defined in section  7: Composition of regulatory capital .  \n95 Where  an AIFI according  to its operative  accounting  framework  recognises  fiduciary  assets  on the \nbalance  sheet,  these  assets  can be excluded  from the leverage ratio exposure  measure provided  that \nthe assets meet the IFRS 9  criteria for  derecognition  and, where  applicable,  IFRS  10 for \ndeconsolidation.  When  disclosing  the leverage  ratio,  AIFIs must  also disclose  the extent  of such de-\nrecognised fiduciary  items.   \n135 from the exposure measure. For example, wh ere a banking, financial or insurance entity is \nnot included in the regulatory scope of consolidation (as set out in section  18.2.2), the \namount of any investment in the capital of that entity that is totally or partially deducted from \nCET1 capital or from Additional Tier 1 capital of the AIFI (in terms of section s 6.2.2 and \n7.5.2(C) of th is Chapter ) may also be deducted from the exposu re measure.  \n \n18.4.2.3  Liability items shall not be deducted from the exposure measure. For \nexample, gains/losses on fair valued liabilities or accounting value adjustments on derivative \nliabilities due to changes in the AIFI\u2019s own credit risk as described in sectio n 7.4.5 shall not \nbe deducted from the exposure measure.  \n \n18.4.3  Derivative exposures  \n18.4.3.1  Treatment of derivatives : Derivatives create two types of exposure:  \n(i) an exposure arising from the underlying of the derivative contract; and  \n(ii) a counterparty credit risk (CCR) ex posure.  \n \nThe leverage ratio framework uses the method set out below to capture both of these \nexposure types.  \n \n18.4.3.2  AIFIs shall calculate their derivative exposures96, including where a n AIFI sells \nprotection using a credit derivative, as the replacement cost (R C)97 for the current exposure \nplus an add -on for potential  future exposure (PFE), as described in section  18.4.3.3 below. If \nthe derivative exposure is covered by an eligible bilateral netting contract as spe cified in the \nAnnex 1 7 (part B) , an alternative treatment as indicated in section  18.4.3.4 below may be \napplied98. Written c redit derivatives are subject to an additional treatment, as set out in \nsection s 18.4.3.1 0 to 18.4.3.1 2 below.  \n \n18.4.3.3  For a single derivative contract,  not cov ered by an eligible bilateral netting contract \nas specified i n Annex 17  (part B),  the amoun t to be included in the exposure measure is \ndetermined as follows:  \nexposure measure = replacement cost (RC) + add -on \nwhere ; \nRC = the r eplacement cost of the contract (obtained by marking to market), where \nthe contract has a positive value.  \n \nadd-on = an amount for PFE over the remaining life of the contract calculated by \napplying an add -on factor to the notional principal amount of the de rivative. The \nadd-on factors are given in Table 9 of section  8.16.3.3 and Tables 2 0 & 21 of \nsection  11.6.3.  \n                                            \n96 This approach makes reference to the Current Exposure Metho d (CEM) to calculate CCR exposure \namounts associated with derivative exposures . AIFIs operating in India may continue to use CEM until \nadvised otherwise by the Reserve Bank.  \n97 If, under the relevant accounting standards, there is no accounting measure of exposure for  certain \nderivative instruments because they are held (completely) off -balance sheet, the AIFI must use the \nsum of positive fair values of these derivatives as the replacement cost.  \n98 These netting rules are with the exception of cross -product netting i .e. cross -product netting is not \npermitted in determining the leverage ratio exposure measure.  However, where a n AIFI has a cross -\nproduct netting agreement in place that meets the eligibility  criteria of Annex 17  (part B) it may choose \nto perform netting separately in each product category provided that all other conditions for netting in \nthis product category that are applicable to the Basel III leverage ratio are met.   \n136  \n18.4.3.4  Bilateral netting : when an eligible bilateral netting contract is in place as specified \nin Annex 17  (part B), the RC  for the set of derivative exposures covered by the contract will \nbe the sum of net replacement cost and the add -on factors as described in section 18.4.3.3 \nabove  will be A Net as calculated below:  \n(a) Credit exposure on bilaterally netted forward transactions w ill be calculated as \nthe sum of the net mark -to-market replacement cost, if positive, plus an add -on \nbased on the notional underlying principal. The add -on for netted transactions \n(ANet) will equal the weighted average of the gross add -on (A Gross) and the gross \nadd-on adjusted by the ratio of net current replacement cost to gross current \nreplacement cost (NGR). This is expressed through the following formula:  \nANet = 0.4 \u00b7 A Gross + 0.6 \u00b7 NGR \u00b7 A Gross \nwhere:  \nNGR = level of net replacement cost/level of gross replacement cost for \ntransactions subject to legally enforceable netting agreements99 \nAGross = sum of individual add -on amounts (calculated by multiplying the notional \nprincipal amount by the appropriate add -on factors set out in Table 9 of section  \n8.16.3.3 and Tables 2 0 & 21 of section 11 .6.3) of all transactions subject to legally \nenforceable netting agreements with one counterparty.  \n(b) For the purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure to a netting \ncounterparty for forward foreign exchange cont racts and other similar contracts in \nwhich the notional principal amount is equivalent to cash flows, the notional \nprincipal is defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each \ncurrency. The reason for this is that offsetting contracts in  the same currency \nmaturing on the same date will have lower potential future exposure as well as \nlower current exposure.  \n \n18.4.3.5  Treatment of related collateral:  collateral received in connection with derivative \ncontracts has two countervailing effects on levera ge: \n(i) it reduces counterparty exposure; but  \n(ii) it can also increase the economic resources at the disposal of the AIFI, as the \nAIFI can use the collateral to leverage itself.  \n \n18.4.3.6  Collateral received in connection with derivative contracts does not necessarily \nreduce the leverage inherent in a n AIFI\u2019s derivatives position, which is generally the case if \nthe settlement exposure arising from the underlying derivative contract is not reduced. As a \ngeneral rule, collateral received may not be netted against derivative e xposures whether or \nnot netting is permitted under the AIFI\u2019s operative accounting or risk -based framework. \nTherefore, it is advised that when calculating the exposure amount by applying sections  \n18.4.3.2 to 1 8.4.3.4 above, a n AIFI shall not reduce the exp osure amount by any collateral \nreceived from the counterparty.  \n \n18.4.3.7  Similarly, with regard to collateral provided, AIFIs shall gross up their exposure \nmeasure by the amount of any derivatives collateral provided where the effect of providing \ncollateral has red uced the value of their balance sheet assets under their operative \naccounting framework.  \n                                            \n99 AIFIs must calculate NGR on a counterparty by co unterparty basis for all transactions that are \nsubject to legally enforceable netting agreements   \n137  \n18.4.3.8  Treatment of cash variation margin:  in the treatment of derivative exposures for \nthe purpose of the leverage ratio, the cash portion of variation margin exchanged bet ween \ncounterparties may be viewed as a form of pre -settlement payment, if the following \nconditions are met:  \n(i) For trades not cleared through a qualifying central counterparty (QCCP), the cash \nreceived by the recipient counterparty is not segregated100.  \n(ii) Varia tion margin is calculated and exchanged on a daily basis based on mark -to-market \nvaluation of derivatives positions101.  \n(iii) The cash variation margin is received in the same currency as the currency of settlement \nof the derivative contract102.  \n(iv) Variation margin  exchanged is the full amount that would be necessary to fully extinguish \nthe mark -to-market exposure of the derivative subject to the threshold and minimum \ntransfer amounts applicable to the counterparty103.  \n(v) Derivatives transactions and variation margins are covered by a single master netting \nagreement (MNA)104,105 between the legal entities that are the counterparties in the \nderivatives transaction. The MNA shall explicitly stipulate that the counterparties agree to \nsettle net any payment obligations covered by such a netting agreement, taking into \naccount any variation margin received or provided if a credit event occurs involving either \ncounterparty. The MNA shall be legally enforceable and effective106 in all relevant \njurisdictions, including in the event of default and bankruptcy or insolvency.  \n \n18.4.3.9  If the conditions in section  18.4.3.8 are met, the cash portion of variation margin \nreceived may be used to reduce the replacement cost portion of the leverage ratio exposure \nmeasure, and the receivables assets from c ash variation margin provided may be deducted \nfrom the leverage ratio exposure measure as follows:  \n(i) In the case of cash variation margin received, the receiving AIFI may reduce the \nreplacement cost (but not the add -on portion) of the exposure amount of the derivative asset \nby the amount of cash received if the positive mark -to-market value of the derivative \ncontract(s) has not already been reduced by the same amount of cash variation margin \nreceived under the AIFI\u2019s operative accounting standard.  \n \n \n                                            \n100 Cash variation margin would satisfy the non -segregation criterion if the recipient counterparty has \nno restrictions on the ability to use the cash received ( i.e. the cash variation margin received is used \nas its own cash).  Further, this criterion would be met if the cash received by the recipient counterparty \nis not required to be segregated by law, regulation, or any agreement with the counterparty.  \n101 To meet  this criterion, derivative positions must be valued daily and cash variation margin must be \ntransferred daily to the counterparty or to the counterparty\u2019s account, as appropriate.   \n102 For this paragraph , currency of settlement means any currency of settlem ent specified in the \nderivative contract, governing qualifying master netting agreement (MNA), or the credit support annex \n(CSA) to the qualifying MNA.   \n103 Cash variation margin exchanged on the morning of the subsequent trading day based on the \nprevious, e nd-of-day market values would meet this criterion, provided that the variation margin \nexchanged is the full amount that would be necessary to fully extinguish the mark -to-market exposure \nof the derivative subject to applicable threshold and minimum transfe r amounts.  \n104 A Master MNA may be deemed to be a single MNA for this purpose.  \n105 To the extent that the criteria in this section  include the term \u201cmaster netting agreement\u201d, this term \nshould be read as including any \u201cnetting agreement\u201d that provides legally enforceable rights of offsets. \nThis is to take account of the fact that no standardisation has currently emerged for nett ing \nagreements employed by CCPs.  \n106 A master netting agreement (MNA) is deemed to meet this criterion if it satisfies the conditions as \nspecif ied in Annex 17  (part B) .  \n138 (ii) In the ca se of cash variation margin provided to a counterparty, the posting AIFI may \ndeduct the resulting receivable from its leverage ratio exposure measure, where the cash \nvariation margin has been recognised as an asset under the AIFI\u2019s operative accounting \nframework.  \n \nCash variation margin may not be used to reduce the PFE amount  (including the calculation \nof the net -to-gross ratio (NGR) as defined in 1 8.4.3.4).  \n \n18.4.3.10  Additional treatment  for written credit derivatives:  in addition to the CCR \nexposure arising from t he fair value of the contracts, written credit derivatives create a \nnotional credit exposure arising from the creditworthiness of the reference entity. It is \ntherefore appropriate to treat written credit derivatives consistently with cash instruments \n(e.g., loans, bonds) for the purposes of the exposure measure.  \n \n18.4.3.11  In order to capture the credit exposure to the underlying reference entity, in \naddition to the above CCR treatment for derivatives and related collateral, the effective \nnotional amount107 referenced  by a written credit derivative is to be included in the exposure \nmeasure. The effective notional amount of a written credit derivative may be reduced by any \nnegative change in fair value amount that has been incorporated into the calculation of Tier 1 \ncapital with respect to the written credit derivative108. The resulting amount may be further \nreduced by the effective notional amount of a purchased credit derivative on the same \nreference name109,110 provided:  \n(i) the credit protection purchased is on a reference obl igation which ranks pari passu  \nwith or is junior to the underlying reference obligation of the written credit derivative in the \ncase of single name credit derivatives111; and  \n \n(ii) the remaining maturity of the credit protection purchased is equal to or greater t han \nthe remaining maturity of the written credit derivative.  \n \n18.4.3.12  Since written credit derivatives are included in the exposure measure at their \neffective notional amounts, and are also subject to add -on amounts for PFE, the exposure \nmeasure for written credit  derivatives may be overstated. AIFIs may therefore choose to \n                                            \n107 The effective  notional  amount  is obtained  by adjusting  the notional  amount  to reflect  the true \nexposure  of contracts  that are leveraged  or otherwise  enhanced  by the structure  of the transaction . \n108 A negative change in fair value is meant to refer to a negative fair value of a credit derivative that is \nrecognised in Tier 1 capital . This treatment is consistent with the rationale that the effective notional  \namounts included in the exposure measure  may be capped at the level of the maximum potential \nloss, which means the maximum potential loss at the reporting date is the notional amount of the \ncredit derivative minus any negative fair value that has already reduced Tier 1 capital.  For example, if \na written credit derivative had a positive fair value of 20 on one date and has a negative fair value of \n10 on a subsequent reporting date, the effective notional amount of the credit derivative may be \nreduced by 10. The effective notional amount cannot be reduced by 30. However, if at the subsequent \nreporting date the credit derivative has a positive fair value of 5, the effective notional amount cannot \nbe reduced at all.  \n109 Two reference  names  are considered  identical  only if they refer to the same  legal entity. For \nsingle -name  credit  derivatives,  protection  purchased  that references  a subordinated  position  may \noffset  protection  sold on a more  senior  position  of the same  reference  entity  as long as a credit  \nevent  on the senior  reference  asset  would  result  in a credit  event  on the subordinated  reference  \nasset.    \n110 The effective  notional  amount  of a written  credit  derivative  may be reduced  by any negative  change  \nin fair value  reflected  in the AIFI\u2019s Tier 1 capital  provided  the effective  notional  amount  of the offsetting  \npurchased  credit  protection  is also reduced  by any resulting  positive  change  in fair value  reflected  in \nTier 1 capital.   \n111 For tranched  products if applicable,  the purchased protection  must  be on a reference obligation with  \nthe same level  of seniority.  \n139 deduct the individual PFE add -on amount relating to a written credit derivative (which is not \noffset according to section  18.4.3.1 1 and whose effective notional amount is included in the \nexposur e measure) from their gross add -on in section s 18.4.3.2 to 1 8.4.3.4112. \n \n18.4.4  Securities financing transaction exposures  \n18.4.4.1  SFTs113 are included in the exposure measure according to the treatment \ndescribed in the following section s. The treatment recognises that secur ed lending and \nborrowing in the form of SFTs is an important source of leverage, and ensures consistent \ninternational implementation by providing a common measure for dealing with the main \ndifferences in the operative accounting frameworks.  \n \n18.4.4.2  General treatm ent ( AIFI acting as principal) : the sum of the amounts in clauses  \n(i) and ( ii) below are to be included in the leverage ratio exposure measure:  \n(i) Gross SFT assets114 recognised for accounting purposes (i.e. , with no recognition of \naccounting netting),115 adjuste d as follows:  \n \n(a) excluding from the exposure measure the value of any securities received \nunder an SFT, where the AIFI has recognised the securities as an asset on its \nbalance sheet116; and  \n(b) cash payables and cash receivables in SFTs with the same counterparty may \nbe measured net if all the following criteria are met:  \n\u2012 Transactions have the same explicit final settlement date;  \n \n\u2012 The right to set off the amount owed to the counterparty with the \namount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable both currently i n the \nnormal course of business and in the event of: (i) default; (ii) insolvency; and \n(iii) bankruptcy; and  \n \n\u2012 The counterparties intend to settle net, settle simultaneously, or the \ntransactions are subject to a settlement mechanism that results in the \nfunctional equivalent of net settlement, that is, the cash flows of the \ntransactions are equivalent, in effect, to a single net amount on the settlement \ndate. To achieve such equivalence, both transactions are settled through the \n                                            \n112 In these cases, where effective bilateral netting contracts are in place, and when calculating A Net = \n0.4\u00b7A Gross+ 0.6\u00b7NGR\u00b7A Gross as per section s 18.4.3.2 to 1 8.4.3.4, A Gross may be reduced by the \nindividual add -on amounts (i .e. notionals multiplie d by the appropriate add -on factors) which relate to \nwritten credit derivatives whose notional amounts are included in the leverage ratio exposure \nmeasure. However, no adjustments must be made to NGR. Where effective bilateral netting contracts \nare not in place,  the PFE add -on may be set to zero in order to avoid the double -counting described in \nthis section . \n113 SFTs are transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security \nlending and borrowing, and margin lending transactions,  where the value of the transactions depends \non market valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements.  \n114 For SFT assets  subject  to novation  and cleared  through  QCCPs,  \u201cgross  SFT assets  recognised  \nfor accounting  purposes\u201d  are replace d by the final contractual  exposure,  given  that pre-existing  \ncontracts  have  been  replaced  by new legal obligations  through the novation  process.  \n115 Gross  SFT assets  recognised  for accounting  purposes  must  not recognise  any accounting  netting  \nof cash  payable s against  cash  receivables  (e.g. as currently  permitted  under  the IFRS  and US \nGAAP  accounting  frameworks).  This regulatory  treatment  has the benefit of avoiding  inconsistencies  \nfrom netting  which may  arise  across  different  accounting  regimes.  \n116 This may apply, for example,  under  US GAAP  where  securities  received  under  an SFT may be \nrecognised  as assets  if the recipient has  the right to  rehypothecate but  has not done so.   \n140 same settlement system and the  settlement arrangements are supported by \ncash and/or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that settlement of both \ntransactions will occur by the end of the business day and the linkages to \ncollateral flows do not result in the unwinding of net ca sh settlement117,118. \n \n(ii) A measure of CCR calculated as the current exposure without an add -on for PFE, \ncalculated as follows:  \n(a) Where a qualifying MNA119 is in place, the current exposure (E*) is the greater \nof zero and the total fair value of securities and cash l ent to a counterparty for all \ntransactions included in the qualifying MNA (\u2211E i), less the total fair value of cash and \nsecurities received from the counterparty for those transactions (\u2211C i). This is \nillustrated in the following formula:  \n \nE* = max {0, [\u2211E i \u2013 \u2211C i]} \n \n(b) Where no qualifying MNA is in place, the current exposure for transactions \nwith a counterparty shall be calculated on a transaction by transaction basis: that is, \neach transaction is treated as its own netting set, as shown in the following formul a: \n \nEi* = max {0, [E i \u2013 Ci]} \n \n18.4.4.3  Sale accounting transactions:  leverage may remain with the AIFI of the security \nin an SFT whether or not sale accounting is achieved under the operative accounting \nframework. As such, where sale accounting is achieved for an S FT under the AIFI\u2019s \noperative accounting framework, the AIFI shall reverse all sales -related accounting entries, \nand then calculate its exposure as if the SFT had been treated as a financing transaction \nunder the operative accounting framework (i.e. , the AIFI shall include the sum of amounts in \nsub-clause s (i) and ( ii) of section  18.4.4.2 for such an SFT) for the purposes of determining \nits exposure measure.  \n18.4.4.4  AIFI acting as agent:  an AIFI acting as agent in an SFT generally provides an \nindemnity or guarante e to only one of the two parties involved, and only for the difference \nbetween the value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the value of collateral the \nborrower has provided. In this situation, the AIFI is exposed to the counterparty of its \ncustomer for the difference in values rather than to the full exposure to the underlying \nsecurity or cash of the transaction (as is the case where the AIFI is one of the principals in \nthe transaction). Where the AIFI does not own/control the underlying cas h or security \nresource, that resource cannot be leveraged by the AIFI. \n                                            \n117 This latter  condition  ensures  that any issues  arising  from the securities  leg of the SFTs do not \ninterfere  with the completion  of the net settlement of the cash receivables  and payables . \n118 To achieve functional equivalence, all transactions must be settled through the same settlement \nmechanism. The failure of any single securities transacti on in the settlement mechanism should delay \nsettlement of only the matching cash leg or create an obligation to the settlement mechanism, \nsupported by an associated credit facility.  Further, if there is a failure of the securities leg of a \ntransaction in s uch a mechanism at the end of the window for settlement in the settlement \nmechanism, then this transaction and its matching cash leg must be split out from the netting set and \ntreated gross for the purposes of the Basel III leverage ratio exposure measure.  Specifically, the \ncriteria in this section  are not intended to preclude a Delivery -versus -Payment (DVP) settlement \nmechanism or other type of settlement mechanism, provided that the settlement mechanism meets \nthe functional requirements set out in this se ction . For example, a settlement mechanism may meet \nthese functional requirements if any failed transaction (that is, the securities that failed to transfer and \nthe related cash receivable or payable) can be re -entered in the settlement mechanism until the y are \nsettled.  \n119 A \u201cqualifying\u201d  MNA  is one that meets the requirements under  Annex 17  part A.   \n141  \n18.4.4.5  Where a n AIFI acting as agent in an SFT provides an indemnity or guarantee to a \ncustomer or counterparty for any difference between the value of the security or cash the \ncustomer has l ent and the value of collateral the borrower has provided, then the AIFI will be \nrequired to calculate its exposure measure by applying only clause  (ii) of section  18.4.4.2120. \n \n18.4.4.6  An AIFI acting as agent in an SFT and providing an indemnity or guarantee to a \ncustomer or counterparty will be considered eligible for the exceptional treatment set out in \nsection  18.4.4.5 only if the AIFI\u2019s exposure to the transaction is limited to the guaranteed \ndifference between the value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the value of \nthe collateral the borrower has provided. In situations where the AIFI is further economically \nexposed (i.e. , beyond the guarantee for the difference) to the underlying security or cash in \nthe transaction121, a further exposure equal to  the full amount of the security or cash shall be \nincluded in the exposure measure.  \n \n18.4.4.7  An illustrative example of exposure measure for SFT transactions are furnished in \nAnnex 12 .  \n \n18.4.5  Off-balance sheet items  \n18.4.5.1  This section  explains th e treatment of off -balance sheet (OBS) items into the \nleverage ratio exposure measure. OBS items include commitments (including liquidity \nfacilities), whether or not unconditionally cancellable, direct credit substitutes, acceptances, \nstandby letters of cr edit, trade letters of credit, etc.  \n \n18.4.5.2  In the risk -based capital framework, OBS items are converted under the \nstandardised approach into credit exposure equivalents through the use of credit conversion \nfactors (CCFs)122. For the purpose of determining the expo sure amount of OBS items for the \nleverage ratio, the CCFs set out in the following sections  shall be applied to the notional \namount123. \n(i) Commitments other than securitisation liquidity facilities with an original maturity up \nto one year and commitments with a n original maturity over one year will receive a CCF of \n20% and 50%, respectively. However, any commitments that are unconditionally \ncancellable at any time by the AIFI without prior notice, or that effectively provide for \nautomatic cancellation due to det erioration in a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness, will receive a \n10% CCF.  \n(ii) Direct credit substitutes, e.g. , general guarantees of indebtedness (including \nstandby letters of credit serving as financial guarantees for loans and securities) and \n                                            \n120 Where,  in addition  to the conditions  in section s 18.4.4.4 to 1 8.4.4.6,  an AIFI acting  as an agent  \nin an SFT does  not provide  an indemnity  or guarantee  to any of the involved  parties,  the AIFI is not \nexposed  to the SFT and therefore  need  not recognise  those SFTs  in its exposure measure.  \n121 For example,  due to the AIFI managing  collateral  received  in the AIFI\u2019s name  or on its own \naccount  rather  than on the customer\u2019s  or borrower\u2019s  account (e .g., by on-lending or  managing  \nunsegregated collateral,  cash or  securities).  \n122 Please refer to section 8.16 .2.  \n123 These correspond  to the CCFs  of the standardised  approach  for credit risk under section  8.16. 2 \n(including Table 8), subject to a floor of 10%. The floor of 10% will affect commitments that are \nunconditionally cancellable at any time by the AIFI without prior notice , or that effectively  provide  for \nautomatic  cancellation  due to deterioration  in a borrower\u2019s  creditworthiness.  These  may receive  a 0% \nCCF under  the risk-based  capital  framework.  For any OBS item not specifically mentioned under \nsection 18.4.5.2 , the applicable CCF for that item will be as indicated in the section 8.16.2 above.    \n142 acceptances (inclu ding endorsements with the character of acceptances) will receive a \nCCF of 100%.  \n(iii) Forward asset purchases, forward deposits and partly paid shares and securities, \nwhich represent commitments with certain drawdown, will receive a CCF of 100%.  \n(iv) Certain transa ction -related contingent items (e.g. , performance bonds, bid bonds, \nwarranties and standby letters of credit related to particular transactions) will receive a CCF \nof 50%.  \n(v) Note issuance facilities (NIFs) and revolving underwriting facilities (RUFs) will \nreceive a CCF of 50%.  \n(vi) For short -term self -liquidating trade letters of credit arising from the movement of \ngoods (e.g. , documentary credits collateralised by the underlying shipment), a 20% CCF \nwill be applied to both issuing and confirming AIFIs. \n(vii) Where ther e is an undertaking to provide a commitment on an OBS item, AIFIs \nshould apply the lower of the two applicable CCFs.  \n(viii) All off -balance  sheet securitisation exposures will receive a CCF of 100% \nconversion factor.  \n \n18.5 Disclosure  and Reporting  requirements  \n18.5.1  AIFIs are required to publicly disclose their Basel III leverage ratio on a \nconsolidated basis  and also report their leverage ratio to the Reserve Bank  (Department of \nSupervision) along with detailed calculations of capital and exposure measures on a \nquarterly ba sis. \n  \n18.5.2  To enable market participants to reconcile leverage ratio disclosures with AIFIs\u2019 \npublished financial statements from period to period, and to compare the capital adequacy of \nAIFIs, it is important that AIFIs adopt a consistent and common disclosure  of the main \ncomponents of the leverage ratio, while also reconciling these disclosures with their \npublished financial statements.  \n \n18.5.3  To facilitate consistency and ease of use of disclosures relating to the composition \nof the leverage ratio, and to mitigate the risk of inconsistent formats undermining the \nobjective of enhanced disclosure, AIFIs should publish their leverage ratio according to a \ncommon set of templates.  \n \n18.5.4  The public disclosure requirements include:  \n(i) a summary comparison table that provides a co mparison of AIFIs\u2019 total \naccounting assets amounts and leverage ratio exposures;  \n(ii) a common disclosure template that provides a breakdown of the main  leverage \nratio regulatory elements;  \n(iii) a reconciliation requirement that details the source(s) of material dif ferences \nbetween AIFIs\u2019 total balance sheet assets in their financial statements and on -balance \nsheet exposures in the common disclosure template; and  \n(iv) other disclosures as set out below.  \n \n18.5.5  AIFIs shall also report their leverage ratio to the R eserve Bank  (Department of \nSupervision) along with detailed calculations of capital and exposure measures on a \nquarterly basis.  \n  \n143 18.5.6  Implementation date, frequency and location of disclosure  \n18.5.6.1  AIFIs are required to make disclosure of the leverage ratio and its components \nfrom the date of publication of their first set of financial statements / results on or after April \n1, 2024 (July 1, 2024 for NHB) . Accordingly, the first such disclosure should be made for the \nquarter ending June 30, 2024 (September 30, 2024 for NHB) . \n \n18.5.6.2  With th e exception of the mandatory quarterly frequency requirement in  section  \n18.5.6.3 below, detailed disclosures required according to section  18.6 shall be made by \nAIFIs, irrespective of whether financial statements are audited, at least on a half yearly basi s \n(i.e., as on September 30 and March 31 of a financial year), along with other Pillar 3 \ndisclosures as required in terms of section  17.9.  \n \n18.5.6.3  As the leverage ratio is an important supplementary measure to the risk -based \ncapital requirements, the same Pillar  3 disclosure requirement also applies to the leverage \nratio. Therefore, AIFIs, at a minimum, shall disclose the following three items on a quarterly \nbasis, irrespective of whether financial statements are audited:  \n(i) Tier 1 capital (as per section  18.3);  \n(ii) Exposure measure (as per section  18.4); and  \n(iii) Leverage ratio (as per section  18.2).  \n \nAt a minimum, these disclosures should be made on a quarter -end basis (i.e. , as on June \n30, September 30, December 31 and March 31 of a financial year), along  with the figures of \nthe prior three quarter -ends.  \n \n18.5.6.4  The location of leverage ratio disclosures should be as stipulated for Pillar 3 \ndisclosures in terms of section s 17.9.3 and 1 7.10. However, specific to leverage ratio \ndisclosures, AIFIs have to make avail able on their websites, an ongoing archive of all \nreconciliation templates, disclosure templates and explanatory tables relating to prior \nreporting periods, instead of an archive for at least three years as required in case of Pillar 3 \ndisclosures.   \n \n18.6 Discl osure templates  \nThe summary comparison table  (Table: DF -16), common disclosure template (Table: DF -\n17) and explanatory table, qualitative reconciliation and other requirements are s et out in \nthe Annex 16 : Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.  Together, these ensure transparency \nbetween the values used for the calculation of the Basel III leverage ratio and the values \nused in AIFIs\u2019 published financial stateme nts.  \n144  \nAnnex  1  \n[section  7.2.3] \n \nCriteria for Classification as Common Shares (Paid -up Equity Capital) for Regulatory \nPurposes \u2013AIFIs  \n \n1. All common shares should ideally be the voting shares. However, in rare cases, \nwhere AIFIs need to issue non -voting commo n shares as part of Common Equity Tier \n1 capital, they must be identical to voting common shares of the issuing AIFI in all \nrespects except the absence of voting rights. Limit on voting rights will be applicable \nbased on the provisions of respective statut es governing individual AIFIs.  \n \n2. Represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the AIFI. \n \n3. Entitled to a claim on the residual assets which is proportional to its share of paid up \ncapital, after all senior claims have been repaid in liquidation (i .e. has an unlimited \nand variable claim, not a fixed or capped claim).  \n \n4. Principal is perpetual and never repaid outside of liquidation (except discretionary \nrepurchases / buy backs or other means of effectively reducing capital in a \ndiscretionary manner t hat is allowable under relevant law as well as guidelines, if \nany, issued by the Reserve Bank  in the matter).  \n \n5. The AIFI does nothing to create an expectation at issuance that the instrument will be \nbought back, redeemed or cancelled nor do the statutory o r contractual terms provide \nany feature which might give rise to such an expectation.  \n \n6. Distributions are paid out of distributable items. The level of distributions is not in any \nway tied or linked to the amount paid up at issuance and is not subject to a  \ncontractual cap (except to the extent that an AIFI  is unable to pay distributions that \nexceed the level of distributable items). As regards \u2018distributable items\u2019, it is clarified \nthat t he dividend on common shares will be paid out of current year\u2019s profit  only.  \n \n7. There are no circumstances under which the distributions are obligatory. Non -\npayment is therefore not an event of default.  \n \n8. Distributions are paid only after all legal and contractual obligations have been met \nand payments on more senior capital instruments have been made. This means that \nthere are no preferential distributions, including in respect of other elements \nclassified as the highest quality issued capital.  \n \n9. It is the paid up capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest shar e of any \nlosses as they occur124. Within the highest quality capital, each instrument absorbs \nlosses on a going concern basis proportionately and pari passu with all the others.  \n \n10. The paid up amount is classified as equity capital (i.e. not recognised as a l iability) for \ndetermining balance sheet insolvency.  \n \n11. The paid up amount is classified as equity under the relevant accounting standards.  \n                                            \n124 In cases where capital instruments have a permanent write -down feature, this criterion is still \ndeemed to be met by common shares .  \n145  \n12. It is directly issued and paid up and the AIFI cannot directly or indirectly have funded \nthe purchase of the instrume nt. AIFIs  should also not extend loans against their own \nshares  as this would be construed as indirect funding of its own capital . \n \n13. The paid up amount is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer or \nrelated entity125 nor subject to any other a rrangement that legally or economically \nenhances the seniority of the claim.  \n \n14. Paid up capital is only issued with the approval of the owners of the issuing AIFI, \neither given directly by the owners or, if permitted by applicable law, given by the \nBoard or  by other persons duly authorised by the owners.  \n \n15. Paid up capital is clearly and separately disclosed in the AIFI\u2019s  balance sheet.  \n                                            \n125 A related entity can include a parent company, a sister company, a subsidiary or any other affiliate. \nA holding company is a related entity irrespective of whether it forms part of the consolidated AIFI .  \n146  \nAnnex 2  \n[section 7 .2.4] \n \nCriteria for Inclusion of Perpetual Non -cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) in \nAdditional Tier 1  Capital  \n \nThe PNCPS will be issued subject to extant legal provisions only in Indian rupees and \nshould meet the following terms and conditions to qualify for inclusion in Additional Tier 1 \nCapital for capital adequacy purposes:  \n \n1. Terms of Issue of Instru ments  \n1.1 Paid up Status  \nThe instruments should be issued by the AIFI (i.e. , not by any \u2018SPV\u2019 etc. set up by the AIFI \nfor this purpose) and fully paid up.   \n \n1.2 Amount  \nThe amount of PNCPS to be raised may be decided by the Board of AIFIs.  \n \n1.3 Limits  \nWhile complying with minimum Tier 1 of 7% of risk weighted assets, an AIFI cannot admit, \nPerpetual Non -Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) together with Perpetual Debt \nInstruments (PDI) in Additional Tier 1 Capital, more than 1.5% of risk weighted assets. \nHowever, once t his minimum total Tier 1 capital has been complied with, any additional \nPNCPS and PDI issued by the AIFI can be included in Total Tier 1 capital reported. Excess \nPNCPS and PDI can be reckoned to comply with Tier 2 capital if the latter is less than 2% of \nRWAs i.e. , while complying with minimum Total Capital of 9% of risk weighted assets.  \n \n1.4 Maturity Period  \nThe PNCPS shall be perpetual i.e. , there is no maturity date and there are no step -ups or \nother incentives to redeem.  \n \n1.5 Rate of Dividend  \nThe rate of dividen d payable to the investors may be either a fixed rate or a floating rate \nreferenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate.  \n \n1.6 Optionality  \nPNCPS shall not be issued with a 'put option'. However, AIFIs may issue the instruments \nwith a call optio n at a particular date subject to following conditions:  \n(a) The call option on the instrument is permissible after the instrument has run \nfor at least five years;  \n \n(b) To exercise a call option an AIFI must receive prior approval of the Reserve \nBank  (Department o f Regulation); and  \n \n  \n147 (c) An AIFI shall not do anything which creates an expectation that the call will be \nexercised126. For example, to preclude such expectation of the instrument \nbeing called, the dividend / coupon reset date need not be co -terminus with \nthe cal l date. AIFIs may, at their discretion, consider having an appropriate \ngap between dividend / coupon reset date and call date ; and  \n \n(d) AIFIs shall not exercise a call unless:  \n(i) They replace the called instrument with capital of the same or better \nquality and the replacement of this capital is done at conditions which \nare sustainable for the income capacity of the AIFI127; or  \n(ii) The AIFI demonstrates that its capital position is well above the \nminimum capital requirements after the call option is exercised.128 \n \nThe u se of tax event and regulatory event calls may be permitted. However, exercise of the \ncalls on account of these events is subject to the requirements set out in points (b) to (d) of \ncriterion 1.6. The Reserve Bank  will permit the AIFI to exercise the call only if the Reserve \nBank  is convinced that the AIFI was not in a position to anticipate these events at the time of \nissuance of PNCPS.  \n \nTo illustrate, if there is a change in tax treatment which makes the capital instrument with tax \ndeductible coupons into  an instrument with non -tax deductible coupons, then the AIFI would \nhave the option (not obligation) to repurchase the instrument. In such a situation, an AIFI \nmay be allowed to replace the capital instrument with another capital instrument that \nperhaps do es have tax deductible coupons. Similarly, if there is a downgrade of the \ninstrument in regulatory classification (e.g. , if it is decided by the Reserve Bank  to exclude \nan instrument from regulatory capital) the AIFI has the option to call the instrument a nd \nreplace it with an instrument with a better regulatory classification, or a lower coupon with \nthe same regulatory classification with prior approval of the Reserve Bank . However, AIFIs \nmay not create an expectation / signal an early redemption / maturit y of the regulatory capital \ninstrument.  \n \n1.7 Repurchase / Buy -back / Redemption  \n(i) Principal of the instruments may be repaid (e.g. , through repurchase or redemption) \nonly  with prior approval of the Reserve Bank  and AIFIs should not assume or \ncreate market expe ctations that supervisory approval will be given ( this \nrepurchase / buy -back /redemption of the principal is in a situation other than in \nthe event of exercise of call option by the AIFI. One of the major differences is that \nin the case of the former, the  option to offer the instrument for repayment on \nannouncement of the decision to repurchase / buy -back /redeem the instrument, \nwould lie with the investors whereas, in case of the latter, it lies with the AIFI).   \n \n(ii) AIFIs may repurchase / buy -back / redeem the instruments only if:  \n(a) They replace such instrument with capital of the same or better quality and \nthe replacement of this capital is done at conditions which are sustainable \nfor the income capacity of the AIFI; or  \n                                            \n126  If an AIFI were to call a capital instrument and replace it with an instrument that is more costly \n(e.g., has a higher credit spread) this might create an expectation that the AIFI will exercise calls on \nits other capital instruments. Therefore, AIFI may not be permitted to call an instrument if the AIFI \nintends to replace it with an instrument issued at a higher credit spread. This is applicable in cases of \nall Additional T ier 1 and Tier 2 instruments.  \n127  Replacement issues can be concurrent with but not after the instrument is called.  \n128 Here, minimum refers to Common Equity Tier 1 of 5.5% of RWAs and Total Capital of 9.0% of \nRWAs including any additional capital requiremen t identified under Pillar 2 .  \n148  \n(b) The AIFI demonstrates that its capit al position is well above the minimum \ncapital requirements after the repurchase / buy -back / redemption.  \n \n1.8  Dividend Discretion   \n(i) The AIFI must have full discretion at all times to cancel distributions/payments;129 \n \n(ii) Cancellation of discretionary payments mus t not be an event of default;  \n \n(iii) AIFIs must have full access to cancelled payments to meet obligations as they fall \ndue; \n \n(iv) Cancellation of distributions/payments must not impose restrictions on the AIFI \nexcept in relation to distributions to common stakehold ers; and  \n \n(v) Dividends must be paid out of distributable items. As regards \u2018distributable items\u2019, it is \nclarified that t he dividend on perpetual non -cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) \nwill be paid out of current year\u2019s profit only.  \n \n(vii) The dividend shal l not be cumulative. i.e., dividend missed in a year will not be paid \nin future years, even if adequate profit is available and the level of CRAR conforms to the \nregulatory minimum. When dividend is paid at a rate lesser than the prescribed rate, the \nunpai d amount will not be paid in future years, even if adequate profit is available and \nthe level of CRAR conforms to the regulatory minimum.  \n \n(viii) The instrument cannot have a credit sensitive coupon feature, i.e. , a dividend that is \nreset periodically base d in whole or in part on the AIFI\u2019s credit standing. For this \npurpose, any reference rate including a broad index which is sensitive to changes to the \nAIFI\u2019s own creditworthiness and / or to changes in the credit worthiness of the wider \nfinancial sector wi ll be treated as a credit sensitive reference rate. AIFIs desirous of \noffering floating reference rate may take prior approval of the Reserve Bank  (DoR) as \nregard permissibility of such reference rates.  \n \n(ix) In general, it may be in order for AIFIs to ha ve dividend stopper arrangement that \nstop dividend payments on common shares in the event the holders of AT1 instruments \nare not paid dividend/coupon. However, dividend stoppers must not impede the full \ndiscretion that AIFI must have at all times to cancel  distributions/payments on the \nAdditional Tier 1 instrument, nor must they act in a way that could hinder the re -\ncapitalisation of the AIFI. For example, it would not be permitted for a stopper on an \nAdditional Tier 1 instrument to:  \n\uf0b7 attempt to stop paymen t on another instrument where the payments on this other \ninstrument were not also fully discretionary;  \n\uf0b7 prevent distributions to shareholders for a period that extends beyond the point in \ntime that dividends/coupons on the Additional Tier 1 instrument are  resumed;  \n\uf0b7 impede the normal operation of the AIFI or any restructuring activity (including \nacquisitions/disposals).  \n \n                                            \n129 Consequence of full discretion at all times to cancel distributions  / payments is that \u201cdividend \npushers\u201d are prohibited. An instrument with a dividend pusher obliges the issuing AIFI to make a \ndividend/coupon payment on the instrument if it has made a payment on another (typically more \njunior) capital instrument or share. This obligation is inconsistent with the requirement for full \ndiscretion at all times. Furthermore, the term \u201ccancel distributions/payments\u201d means extinguis h these \npayments. It does not permit features that require the AIFI to make distributions/payments in kind.   \n149 A stopper may act to prohibit actions that are equivalent to the payment of a dividend, such \nas the AIFI undertaking discretionary share  buybacks, if otherwise permitted . \n   \n1.9  Treatment in Insolvency  \nThe instrument cannot contribute to liabilities exceeding assets if such a balance sheet test \nforms part of a requirement to prove insolvency under any law or otherwise.  \n \n1.10 Loss Absorption Featu res \nPNCPS should have principal loss absorption through either (i) conversion to common \nshares at an objective pre -specified trigger point or (ii) a write -down mechanism which \nallocates losses to the instrument at a pre -specified trigger point. The write -down will have \nthe following effects:  \n(a) Reduce the claim of the instrument in liquidation;  \n(b) Reduce the amount re -paid when a call is exercised; and  \n(c) Partially or fully reduce dividend payments on the instrument.  \n \nVarious criteria for loss absorption through conversion / write -down / write -off on breach of \npre-specified trigger and at the point of non -viability are f urnished in Annex 14 . \n  \n1.11 Prohibition on Purchase / Funding of PNCPS  \nNeither the AIFI nor a related party over which th e AIFI exercises control or significant \ninfluence (as defined under relevant Accounting Standards) should purchase PNCPS, nor \ncan the AIFI directly or indirectly should fund the purchase of the instrument. AIFI should \nalso not grant advances against the se curity of PNCPS issued by them.  \n \n1.12 Re-capitalisation  \nThe instrument cannot have any features that hinder re -capitalisation, such as provisions \nwhich require the issuer to compensate investors if a new instrument is issued at a lower \nprice during a specified time frame.  \n \n1.13 Reporting of Non -payment of Dividends  \nAll instances of non -payment of dividends should be notified by the issuing AIFI to the Chief \nGeneral Managers -in-Charge of Department of Regulation and Department of Supervision of \nthe Reserve Bank , Mumba i. \n \n1.14 Seniority of Claim  \nThe claims of the investors in instruments shall be  \n(i) Superior to the claims of investors in equity shares;  \n \n(ii) Subordinated to the claims of PDIs, all Tier 2 regulatory capital instruments, \ndepositors and general creditors of the AIFI; and  \n \n(iii) is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer nor related entity \nor other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of \nthe claim vis -\u00e0-vis AIFI creditors.  \n \n1.15 Investment in Instrum ents Raised in Indian Rupees by Fore ign Entities/  NRIs  \n(i) Investment by FIIs and NRIs shall be within an overall limit of 49% and 24% of the \nissue respectively, subject to the investment by each FII not exceeding 10% of the \nissue, and investment by each NRI not exceeding 5% of the issue. Invest ment by FIIs  \n150 in these instruments shall be outside the ECB limit for rupee -denominated corporate \ndebt, as fixed by Government of India from time to time. The overall non -resident \nholding of Preference Shares and equity shares in AIFIs  will be subject to th e \nstatutory / regulatory limit.  \n \n(ii) AIFIs should comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by SEBI / other \nregulatory authorities in regard to issue of the instruments.  \n \n1.16 Reporting of Issuances  \n(i) AIFIs issuing PNCPS shall submit a report to the C hief General Manager -in-charge, \nDepartment of Regulation,  Central Office,  Reserve Bank , Mumbai giving details of \nthe debt raised as per the format prescribed below duly certified by the compliance \nofficer of the AIFI , soon after the issue is completed .  \n \nFormat - Reporting of Capital Issuances  \nIssuer    \nIssue Size    \nInstrument    \nDeemed Date of Allotment    \nCoupon    \nTenor    \nCredit Rating    \nPut Option    \nCall Option    \nRedemption/Maturity    \nWhether Private Placement or otherwise    \n \n(ii) The issue -wise deta ils of amount raised as PNCPS qualifying for Additional Tier 1 \ncapital by the AIFIs from FIIs / NRIs are required to be reported within 30 days of the \nissue to the Chief General Manager, Reserve Bank , Foreign Exchange Department, \nForeign Investment Divisio n, Central Office, Mumbai in the proforma given at the \nend of this Annex .

Terms of Issue of Instruments Denominated in Indian Rupees  \n1.1 Paid -in Status  \nThe instruments should be issued by the AIFI (i.e. , not by any \u2018SPV\u2019 etc. set up by the AIFI \nfor this purpose) and fully paid -in.   \n \n1.2 Amo unt \nThe amount of PDI to be raised may be decided by the Board of AIFIs.  \n \n1.3 Limits  \nWhile complying with minimum Tier 1 of 7% of risk weighted assets, an AIFI cannot admit, \nPerpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) together with Perpetual Non -Cumulative Preference \nShares (PNCPS) in Additional Tier 1 Capital, more than 1.5% of risk weighted assets. \nHowever, once this minimum total Tier 1 capital has been complied with, any additional \nPNCPS and PDI issued by the AIFI can be included in Total Tier 1 capital reported.  Exc ess \nPNCPS and PDI can be reckoned to comply with Tier 2 capital if the latter is less than 2% of \nRWAs i.e. , while complying with minimum Total Capital of 9% of risk weighted assets.  \n \n1.4 Maturity Period  \nThe PDIs shall be perpetual i.e. , there is no maturity d ate and there are no step -ups or other \nincentives to redeem.  \n \n1.5 Rate of Interest  \nThe interest payable to the investors may be either at a fixed rate or at a floating rate \nreferenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate.   \n \n1.6 Optionality  \nPDIs sh all not have any \u2018put option\u2019. However, AIFIs may issue the instruments with a call \noption at a particular date subject to following conditions:  \n \na. The call option on the instrument is permissible after the instrument has run for at \nleast five years;  \n \nb. To exe rcise a call option an AIFI must receive prior approval of the Reserve Bank  \n(Department of Regulation);  \n   \nc. An AIFI shall not do anything which creates an expectation that the call will be \nexercised. For example, to preclude such expectation of the instrume nt being called, \nthe dividend / coupon reset date need not be co -terminus with the call date. AIFIs \nmay, at their discretion, consider having an appropriate gap between dividend / \ncoupon reset date and call date ; and  \n \n \n  \n153 d. AIFIs shall not exercise a call unles s: \n  \n(i) They replace the called instrument with capital of the same or better quality \nand the replacement of this capital is done at conditions which are \nsustainable for the income capacity of the AIFI131; or  \n \n(ii) The AIFI demonstrates that its capital position is  well above the minimum \ncapital requirements after the call option is exercised.132 \n \nThe use of tax event and regulatory event calls may be permitted. However, exercise of the \ncalls on account of these events is subject to the requirements set out in points (b) to (d) of \ncriterion 1.6. The Reserve Bank  will permit the AIFI to exercise the call only if the Reserve \nBank  is convinced that the AIFI was not in a position to anticipate these events at the time of \nissuance of PDIs.  \n \nTo illustrate, if there is a chan ge in tax treatment which makes the capital instrument with tax \ndeductible coupons into an instrument with non -tax deductible coupons, then the AIFI would \nhave the option (not obligation) to repurchase the instrument. In such a situation, an AIFI \nmay be al lowed to replace the capital instrument with another capital instrument that \nperhaps does have tax deductible coupons. Similarly, if there is a downgrade of the \ninstrument in regulatory classification (e.g. , if it is decided by the Reserve Bank  to exclude \nan instrument from regulatory capital) the AIFI has the option to call the instrument and \nreplace it with an instrument with a better regulatory classification, or a lower coupon with \nthe same regulatory classification with prior approval of the Reserve Ba nk. However, AIFIs \nmay not create an expectation / signal an early redemption / maturity of the regulatory capital \ninstrument.  \n \n1.7 Repurchase / Buy -back / Redemption  \n(i) Principal of the instruments may be repaid (e.g. , through repurchase or redemption) \nonly wit h prior approval of the Reserve Bank  and AIFIs should not assume or create \nmarket expectations that supervisory approval will be given (this repurchase / buy -\nback /redemption of the principal is in a situation other than in the event of exercise of \ncall op tion by the AIFI. One of the major differences is that in the case of the former, \nthe option to offer the instrument for repayment on announcement of the decision to \nrepurchase / buy -back /redeem the instrument, would lie with the investors whereas, \nin cas e of the latter, it lies with the AIFI).   \n \n(ii)   AIFIs may repurchase / buy -back / redemption only if:  \n(a) They replace such instrument with capital of the same or better quality and the \nreplacement of this capital is done at conditions which are sustainable for  the \nincome capacity of the AIFI; or  \n \n(b) The AIFI demonstrates that its capital position is well above the minimum \ncapital requirements after the repurchase / buy -back / redemption.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n131 Replacement issues can be concurrent with but not after the instrument is called.  \n132 Minimum refers to Common Equity Tier 1 of 5.5% of RWAs and Total capital of 9.0% of RWAs \nincluding additional capital requirements identifi ed under Pillar 2.   \n154 1.8  Coupon Discretion  \n(i) The AIFI must have full discretion at all times to canc el distributions/payments133 \n \n(ii) Cancellation of discretionary payments must not be an event of default  \n \n(iii) AIFIs must have full access to cancelled payments to meet obligations as they fall \ndue  \n \n(iv) Cancellation of distributions/payments must not impose restriction s on the AIFI \nexcept in relation to distributions to common stakeholders.  \n \n(v) Coupons  must be paid out of \u2018distributable items\u2019. In this context, coupon may be \npaid out of current year profits. However, if current year profits are not sufficient, \ncoupon may b e paid subject to availability of:  \n(i) Profits brought forward from previous years, and/or  \n(ii) Reserves representing appropriation of net profits, including statutory reserves, \nand excluding share premium, revaluation reserve, foreign currency translation  \nreserve, investment reserve and reserves created on amalgamation.  \nThe accumulated losses and deferred revenue expenditure, if any, shall be netted off \nfrom (i) and (ii) to arrive at the available balances for payment of coupon.  \nIf the aggregate of: (a) pr ofits in the current year; (b) profits brought forward from the \nprevious years and (c) permissible reserves as at (ii) above, excluding statutory \nreserves, net of accumulated losses and deferred revenue expenditure are less than \nthe amount of coupon, only then the AIFI shall make appropriation from the statutory \nreserves. In such cases, AIFI s are required to report to the Reserve Bank within \ntwenty -one days from the date of such appropriation.  \nHowever, payment of coupons on PDIs from the reserves is subject  to the issuing \nAIFI meeting minimum regulatory requirements for CET1, Tier 1 and Total Capital \nratios.  \nIn order to meet the eligibility criteria for perpetual debt instruments, AIFIs shall \nensure and indicate in their offer documents that they have full d iscretion at all times \nto cancel distributions / payments.  \n(vi) the interest shall not be cumulative.  \n \n(vii) The instrument cannot have a credit sensitive coupon feature, i.e. , a dividend that is \nreset periodically based in whole or in part on the AIFIs\u2019 credit stan ding. For this \npurpose, any reference rate including a broad index which is sensitive to changes to \nthe AIFI\u2019s own creditworthiness and / or to changes in the credit worthiness of the \nwider financial sector will be treated as a credit sensitive reference r ate. AIFIs \ndesirous of offering floating reference rate may take prior approval of the Reserve \nBank  (DOR) as regard s permissibility of such reference rates.  \n \n(viii)  In general, it may be in order for AIFIs to have dividend stopper arrangement that \nstop dividend p ayments on common shares in the event the holders of AT1 \ninstruments are not paid dividend/coupon. However, dividend stoppers must not \n                                            \n133 Consequence of full discretion at all times to cancel distributions/payments is that \u201cdividend \npushers\u201d are prohibited. An instrument with a dividend pusher obliges the issuing AIFI to make a \ndividend/coupon payment on the instrument i f it has made a payment on another (typically more \njunior) capital instrument or share. This obligation is inconsistent with the requirement for full \ndiscretion at all times. Furthermore, the term \u201ccancel distributions/payments\u201d means extinguish these \npaym ents. It does not permit features that require the AIFI to make distributions/payments in kind.   \n155 impede the full discretion that AIFI must have at all times to cancel \ndistributions/payments on the Additional Tier 1 ins trument, nor must they act in a way \nthat could hinder the re -capitalisation of the AIFI. For example, it would not be \npermitted for a stopper on an Additional Tier 1 instrument to:  \n\uf0b7 attempt to stop payment on another instrument where the payments on this o ther \ninstrument were not also fully discretionary;  \n \n\uf0b7 prevent distributions to shareholders for a period that extends beyond the point in \ntime that dividends/coupons on the Additional Tier 1 instrument are resumed;  \n \n\uf0b7 impede the normal operation of the AIFI or any restructuring activity (including \nacquisitions/disposals).  \n \nA stopper may act to prohibit actions that are equivalent to the payment of a dividend, such \nas the AIFI undertaking discretionary share buybacks, if otherwise permitted . \n \n1.9  Treatment in In solvency  \nThe instrument cannot contribute to liabilities exceeding assets if such a balance sheet test \nforms part of a requirement to prove insolvency under any law or otherwise.  \n \n1.10 Loss Absorption Features  \nPDIs may be classified as liabilities for accounti ng purposes (not for the purpose of \ninsolvency as indicated in paragraph 1.9 above). In such cases, these instruments must \nhave principal loss absorption through either (i) conversion to common shares at an \nobjective pre -specified trigger point or (ii) a w rite-down mechanism which allocates losses to \nthe instrument at a pre -specified trigger point. The write -down will have the following effects:  \n(a) Reduce the claim of the instrument in liquidation;  \n(b) Reduce the amount re -paid when a call is exercised; and  \n(c) Partially or fully reduce coupon payments on the instrument.  \n \nVarious criteria for loss absorption through conversion / write -down / write -off on breach of \npre-specified trigger and at the point of non -viability are furnished i n Annex 14 .  \n \n1.11 Prohibition on Purchase / Funding of Instruments  \nNeither the AIFI nor a related party over which the AIFI exercises control or significant \ninfluence (as defined under relevant Accounting Standards) should purchase the instrument, \nnor can the AIF I directly or indirectly fund the purchase of the instrument. AIFIs should also \nnot grant advances against the security of the debt instruments issued by them.  \n \n1.12 Re-capitalisation  \nThe instrument cannot have any features that hinder re -capitalisation, such a s provisions \nwhich require the issuer to compensate investors if a new instrument is issued at a lower \nprice during a specified time frame.  \n \n1.13 Reporting of Non -payment of Coupons  \nAll instances of non -payment of coupon should be notified by the issuing AIFIs  to the Chief \nGeneral Managers -in-Charge of Department of Regulation and Department of Supervision of  \nReserve Bank , Mumbai.  \n \n \n  \n156  \n \n1.14 Seniority of Claim  \nThe claims of the inv estors in instruments shall be  \n \n(i) superior to the claims of investors in equity shares and p erpetual non -cumulative \npreference shares;  \n(ii) subordinated to the claims of depositors, general creditors and subordinated debt of \nthe AIFI;  \n(iii) is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer nor related entity or other \narrangement that legally or  economically enhances the seniority of the claim vis -\u00e0-vis \nAIFI creditors.  \n  \n1.15  Investment in Instruments Raised in Indian Rupees by Foreign Entities/NRIs  \n(i) Investment by FIIs in instruments raised in Indian Rupees shall be outside the ECB \nlimit for rupee den ominated corporate debt, as fixed by the Govt. of India from time to \ntime, for investment by FIIs in corporate debt instruments. Investment in these \ninstruments by FIIs and NRIs shall be within an overall limit of 49% and 24% of the \nissue, respectively, su bject to the investment by each FII not exceeding 10% of the \nissue and investment by each NRI not exceeding 5% of the issue.  \n \n(ii) AIFIs should comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by SEBI / other \nregulatory authorities in regard to issue of  the instruments.  \n \n1.16 Terms of Issue of Instruments Denominated in Foreign Currency  / Rupee \nDenominated Bonds Overseas  \n \nAIFIs may augment their capital funds through the issue of PDIs in foreign currency  / rupee \ndenominated bonds overseas without seeking the p rior approval of the Reserve Bank , \nsubject to compliance with the  applicable FEMA guidelines and  requirements mentioned \nbelow:  \n(i) The i nstruments shall comply with all terms and conditions as applicable to the \ninstruments issued in Indian Rupees.  \n \n(ii) Not more than 49% of the eligible amount can be issued in foreign currency and/or in \nrupee denominated bonds overseas (Illustration given in the below table). \u201cEligible \namount\u201d in this context shall mean the higher of:  \n(a) 1.5% of RWA or \n(b) Total Additional Tier 1 capital  \nas on March 31 of the previous financial year  \n \nIllustration on the \u201celigible amount\u201d that can be raised  \nConsidering that the AIFI has RWAs of \u20b9.1000 crore as on March 31 of previous financial \nyear \n \n Scenario  Maximum amount of AT1 bonds \nthat can be raised overseas (in \nforeign currency and/or in rupee \ndenominated bonds overseas)  \nCase I  The AIFI had AT1 capita l of less than or \nequal to 1.5% of RWAs as on March 31 of \nthe previous financial year.

Introduction  \nAIFIs can undertake transactions in CDS  in terms of Master Direction \u2013 Reserve Bank of \nIndia (Credit Derivatives) Directions, 2022 . As users, AIFIs can buy CDS to hedge a Banking \nBook or Trading Book exposure. The prudential guidelines dealing with CDS are dea lt with in \nthe following paragraphs.  \n \n2. Definitions  \nThe expressions/definitions unless defined in this Master Direction  shall have the same \nmeaning as have been assigned to them under Master Direction \u2013 Reserve Bank of India \n(Credit Derivatives) Directio ns, 2022 .  \n \n3. Classification of CDS into Trading Book and Banking Book  Positions   \nFor the purpose of capital adequacy for CDS transactions, Trading Book would comprise \nHeld for Trading  positions and Banking Book would comprise Held to Maturity  and Availab le \nfor Sale  positions. A CDS being a financial derivative will be classified in the Trading Book \nexcept when it is contracted and designated as a hedge for a Banking Book exposure. Thus, \nthe CDS positions held in the Trading Book would include positions wh ich:  \n(a) are meant for hedging the exposures in the Trading Book;  \n(b) are held for short -term resale; and  \n(c) are taken by the AIFI with the intention of benefiting in the short -term from the actual and \n/ or expected differences between their buying and selling prices  \nCDS positions meant for hedging Banking Book exposures will be classified in the Banking \nBook. However, all CDS positions, either in Banking Book or Trading Book, should be \nmarked -to-market. All CDS positions should meet the operational req uirements indicated in \nparagraph 4 below.  \n \n4. Operational requirements for CDS to be recognised as eligible External / Third -party \nhedges for Trading Book and Banking Book  \n(a) A CDS contract should represent a direct claim on the protection provider and s hould be \nexplicitly referenced to specific exposure, so that the extent of the cover is clearly defined \nand incontrovertible.  \n  \n(b) Other than non -payment by a protection purchaser of premium in respect of the credit \nprotection contract it should be irrevo cable.  \n \n(c) There should be no clause in the contract that would allow the protection provider \nunilaterally to cancel the credit cover or that would increase the effective cost of cover as a \nresult of deteriorating credit quality in the hedged exposure.  \n \n(d) The CDS contract should be unconditional; there should be no clause in the protection \ncontract outside the direct control of the AIFI (protection buyer) that could prevent the \nprotection provider from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the \noriginal counterparty fails to make the payment(s) due.   \n169  \n(e) The credit events specified by the contracting parties should at a minimum cover:  \n \n(i) failure to pay the amounts due under terms of the underlying obligation that are in effect at  \nthe time of such failure (with a grace period that is closely in line with the grace period in the \nunderlying obligation);  \n \n(ii) bankruptcy, insolvency or inability of the obligor to pay its debts, or its failure or admission \nin writing of its inability g enerally to pay its debts as they become due, and analogous \nevents; and  \n \n(iii) restructuring of the underlying obligation involving forgiveness or postponement of \nprincipal, interest or fees that results in a credit loss event (i.e. , charge -off, specific p rovision \nor other similar debit to the profit and loss account);  \n \n(iv) when the restructuring of the underlying obligation is not covered by the CDS, but the \nother requirements in paragraph 4  are met, partial recognition of the CDS will be allowed. If \nthe amount of the CDS is less than or equal to the amount of the underlying obligation, 60% \nof the amount of the hedge can be recognised as covered. If the amount of the CDS is larger \nthan that of the underlying obligation, then the amount of eligible hedge is  capped at 60% of \nthe amount of the underlying obligation . \n \n(f) If the CDS specifies deliverable obligations that are different from the underlying \nobligation, the resultant asset mismatch will be governed under paragraph (k) below.  \n \n(g) The CDS shall not terminate prior to expiration of any grace period required for a default \non the underlying obligation to occur as a result of a failure to pay145. \n \n(h) The CDS allowing for cash settlement are recognised for capital purposes insofar as a \nrobust valuation pro cess is in place in order to estimate loss reliably. There should be a \nclearly specified period for obtaining post -credit event valuations of the underlying obligation. \nIf the reference obligation specified in the CDS for purposes of cash settlement is dif ferent \nthan the underlying obligation, the resultant asset mismatch will be governed under \nparagraph (k) below.  \n(i) If the protection purchaser\u2019s right/ability to transfer the underlying obligation to the \nprotection provider is required for settlement, th e terms of the underlying obligation should \nprovide that any required consent to such transfer may not be unreasonably withheld.  \n(j) The identity of the parties responsible for determining whether a credit event has occurred \nshould be clearly defined. Thi s determination should not be the sole responsibility of the \nprotection seller. The protection buyer should have the right/ability to inform the protection \nprovider of the occurrence of a credit event.  \n(k) A mismatch between the underlying obligation and the reference obligation or deliverable \nobligation under the CDS (i.e. , the obligation used for purposes of determining cash \nsettlement value or the deliverable obligation) is permissible if (1) the reference obligation or \ndeliverable obligation ranks pari passu  with or is junior to the underlying obligation, and (2) \nthe underlying obligation and reference obligation or deliverable obligation share the same \nobligor (i.e. , the same legal entity) and legally enforceable cross -default or cross -\nacceleration cla uses are in place.  \n \n                                            \n145 The maturity of the underlying exposure and the maturity of  the hedge should be defined \nconservatively. The effective maturity of the underlying should be gauged as the longest possible \nremaining time before the counterparty is scheduled to fulfill its obligation, taking into account any \napplicable grace period.   \n170 (l) A mismatch between the underlying obligation and the obligation used for purposes of \ndetermining whether a credit event has occurred is permissible if (1) the latter obligation \nranks pari passu  with or is junior to the underlying ob ligation, and (2) the underlying \nobligation and reference obligation share the same obligor (i.e. , the same legal entity) and \nlegally enforceable cross -default or cross acceleration clauses are in place.  \n \n5. Capital Adequacy Requirement for CDS Positions i n the Banking Book  \n5.1 Recognition of External/Third -party CDS Hedges  \n5.1.1  In case of Banking Book positions  hedged  by bought CDS positions, no exposure will \nbe reckoned against the reference entity / underlying asset in respect of the hedged \nexposure, a nd exposure will be deemed to have been substituted by the protection seller, if \nthe following conditions are satisfied:  \n(a)  Operational requirements mentioned in paragraph 4 are met;  \n \n(b)  The risk weight applicable to the protection seller under the St andardised Approach for \ncredit risk is lower than that of the underlying asset; and  \n \n(c) There is no maturity mismatch between the underlying asset and the reference / \ndeliverable obligation. If this condition is not satisfied, then the amount of credit \nprotection to be recognised should be computed as indicated in paragraph 5.1.3 (ii) \nbelow.  \n \n5.1.2  If the conditions (a) and (b) above are not satisfied or the AIFI breaches any of these \ncondit ions subsequently, the AIFI shall reckon the exposure on the unde rlying asset; and the \nCDS position will be transferred to Trading Book where it will be subject to specific risk, \ncounterparty credit risk and general market risk (wherever applicable) capital requirements \nas applicable to Trading Book.  \n \n5.1.3   The unprot ected portion of the underlying exposure should be risk -weighted as \napplicable under Basel II framework. The amount of credit protection shall be adjusted if \nthere are any mismatches between the underlying asset/ obligation and the reference / \ndeliverable asset / obligation with regard to asset or maturity . These are dealt with in detail in \nthe following paragraphs.  \n \n(i)  Asset mismatches  \nAsset mismatch will arise if the underlying asset is different from the reference asset or \ndeliverable obligation. Prote ction will be reckoned as available by the protection buyer only if \nthe mismatched assets meet the requirements specified in paragraph 4 (k) above.  \n \n(ii)  Maturity mismatches  \nThe protection buyer would be eligible to reckon the amount of protection if the maturity of \nthe credit derivative contract were to be equal or more than the maturity of the underlying \nasset. If, however, the maturity of the CDS contract is less than the maturity of the \nunderlying asset, then it would be construed as a maturity mismatc h. In case of maturity \nmismatch the amount of protection will be determined in the following manner:  \n \na. If the residual maturity of the credit derivative product is less than three months \nno protection will be recognized.  \n \nb. If the residual maturity of the cr edit derivative contract is three months or more \nprotection proportional to the period for which it is available will be recognised. When there \nis a maturity mismatch the following adjustment will be applied.   \n171  \nPa = P x (t - .25) \u00f7 (T - .25) \nWhere:  \n \nPa =  value of the credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch  \nP  =  credit protection  \nt  = min (T, residual maturity of the credit protection arrangement) expressed in years  \nT = min (5, residual maturity of the underlying exposure) expressed in years  \n \nExample : Suppose the underlying asset is a corporate bond of Face Value of Rs. 100 where \nthe residual maturity is of 5 years and the residual maturity of the CDS is 4 years. The \namount of credit protection is computed as under:  \n \n                100 * {(4 -.25) \u00f7 ( 5-.25)} = 100*(3.75\u00f7 4.75) = 78.95  \n \nc. Once the residual maturity of the CDS contract reaches three months , \nprotection ceases to be recognised.  \n \n5.2 Internal  Hedges  \nAIFIs can use CDS contracts to hedge against the credit risk in their existing corporate \nbonds  portfolios. An AIFI can hedge a Banking Book credit risk exposure either by an \ninternal hedge (the protection purchased from the trading desk of the AIFI and held in the \nTrading Book) or an external hedge (protection purchased from an eligible third party  \nprotection provider). When an AIFI hedges a Banking Book credit risk exposure (corporate \nbonds) using a CDS booked in its Trading Book (i.e. , using an internal hedge), the Banking \nBook exposure is not deemed to be hedged for capital purposes unless the AI FI transfers \nthe credit risk from the Trading Book to  an eligible third party protection provider through a \nCDS meeting the requirements of paragraph 5.1 vis-\u00e0-vis the Banking Book exposure. \nWhere such third party protection is purchased and is recognised as a hedge of a Banking \nBook exposure for regulatory capital purposes, no capital is required to be maintained on \ninternal and external CDS hedge. In such cases, the external CDS will act as indirect hedge \nfor the Banking Book exposure and the capital adeq uacy in terms of paragraph 5.1, as \napplicable for external / third party hedges, will be applicable.  \n \n6. Capital Adequacy for CDS in the Trading Book  \n6.1 General Market Risk   \nA credit default swap does not normally create a position for general market ris k for either \nthe protection buyer or protection seller. However, the present value of premium payable / \nreceivable is sensitive to changes in the interest rates. In order to measure the interest rate \nrisk in premium receivable/payable, the present value of  the premium can be treated as a \nnotional position in Government securities of relevant maturity. These positions will attract \nappropriate capital charge for general market risk. The protection buyer / seller will treat the \npresent value of the premium pay able / receivable equivalent to a short / long notional \nposition in Government securities of relevant maturity.  \n \n6.2 Specific Risk for Exposure to Reference Entity  \nA CDS creates a notional long / short position for specific risk in the reference asset / \nobligation for protection seller / protection buyer. For calculating specific risk capital charge, \nthe notional amount of the CDS and its maturity should be used.

In the case of foreign ECAIs, the rating symbols used here \ncorrespond to Standard and Poor. The modifiers \u201c+\u201d or \u201c -\u201c have been subsu med \nwithin the main category.  \n \n \n \n  \n173 6.2.1   Specific Risk Capital Charges for Positions Hedged by CDS146  \n(i) AIFIs may fully offset the specific risk capital charges when the values of two legs (i.e. , \nlong and short in CDS positions) always move in the oppos ite direction and broadly to the \nsame extent. This would be the case when the two legs consist of completely identical \nCDS . In these cases, no specific risk capital requirement applies to both sides of the CDS \npositions.  \n(ii) AIFIs may offset 80 per cent  of the specific risk capital charges when the value of two \nlegs (i.e. , long and short) always moves in the opposite direction but not broadly to the same \nextent147. This would be the case when a long cash position is hedged by a credit default \nswap and ther e is an exact match in terms of the reference / deliverable obligation, and the \nmaturity of both the reference / deliverable obligation and the CDS. In addition, key features \nof the CDS (e.g. , credit event definitions, settlement mechanisms) should not cau se the price \nmovement of the CDS to materially deviate from the price movements of the cash position. \nTo the extent that the transaction transfers risk, an 80% specific risk offset will be applied to \nthe side of the transaction with the higher capital char ge, while the specific risk requirement \non the other side will be zero148.  \n(iii) AIFIs may offset partially the specific risk capital charges when the value of the two \nlegs (i.e. , long and short) usually moves in the opposite direction. This would be the c ase in \nthe following situations:  \n(a) The position is captured in paragraph 6.2.1 (ii) but there is an asset mismatch \nbetween the cash position and the CDS. However, the underlying asset is included in the \n(reference / deliverable) obligations in the CDS documentation and meets the requirements \nof paragraph 4 (k).  \n(b) The position is captured in paragraph 6.2.1 (ii) but there is maturity mismatch \nbetween credit  protection and the underlying asset. However, the underlying asset is \nincluded in the (referen ce / deliverable) obligations in the CDS documentation.  \n(c) In each of the cases in paragraph (a) and (b) above, rather than applying specific risk \ncapital  requirements on each side of the transaction (i.e. , the credit protection and the \nunderlying asset) , only higher of the two capital requirements will apply.  \n \n6.2.2  Specific Risk Charge  in CDS Positions which are not meant for Hedging  \nIn cases not captured in paragraph 6.2.1, a specific risk capital charge will be assessed \nagainst both sides of the posi tions.  \n \n \n \n                                            \n146 This paragraph will be applicable only in those cases where a CDS position is explicitly meant for \nhedging a Trading Book exposure. In other words, a n AIFI cannot treat a CDS position as a hedge \nagainst any other Trading Book exposure if it was not intend ed to be as such ab initio.  \n147 A cash position in corporate bond in Trading Book hedged by a CDS position, even where the \nreference obligation and the underlying bonds are the same, will not qualify for 100% offset because a \nCDS cannot guarantee a 100% matc h between the market value of CDS and the appreciation / \ndepreciation in the underlying bond at all times. This paragraph will apply only when two legs consist \nof completely identical CDS instruments.  \n148 For example, if specific risk charge on long position  (corporate bond) comes to Rs.1000 and that \non the short position (credit protection bought through CDS) comes to Rs.700, there will be no capital \nchange on the short position and the long position will attract specific risk capital charge of Rs.200 \n(1000 -80% of 1000). AIFIs will not be allowed to offset specific risk charges between two opposite \nCDS positions which are not completely identical.   \n174  \n7.   Capital Charge for Counterparty Credit Risk  \nThe credit exposure for the purpose of counterparty credit risk on account of CDS  \ntransactions in the Trading Book will be calculated according to the Current Exposure \nMethod149 under Basel framework.  \n \n7.1 Protection Seller  \nA protection seller will have exposure to the protection buyer only if the fee / premia are \noutstanding. In such cases, t he counterparty credit risk charge for all single name long CDS \npositions in the Trading Book will be calculate d as the sum of the current marked -to-market \nvalue, if positive (zero, if marked -to-market value is negative) and the potential future \nexposure add -on factors based on Table 3  given below. However , for protection seller where \nthe CDS positions are outside netting and margin agreements , the add -on will be capped to \nthe amount of unpaid premia.  AIFIs have the option to remove such CDS positions from their \nlegal netting sets and treat them as individual unmargined transactions in order to apply the \ncap. \nTable  3: Add -on factors for Protection sellers  \n(As % of Notional Principal of CDS)  \nType of Reference Obligation150 Add-on factor  \nObligations rated BBB - and above  10% \nBelow BBB - and unrated  20% \n  \n7.2 Protection Buyer   \nA CDS contract creates a counterparty expo sure on the protection seller on account of the \ncredit event payment. T he counterparty credit risk charge for all short CDS positions in the \nTrading Book will be calculated as the sum of the current marked -to-market value, if positive \n(zero, if marked -to-market value is negative) and the potential future exposure add -on \nfactors based on Table 4 given below:  \n \n \n \n                                            \n149  A CDS contract, which is required to be marked -to-market, creates bilateral exposure for the \nparties to the c ontract. The mark -to-market value of a CDS contract is the difference between the \ndefault -adjusted present value of protection payment (called \u201cprotection leg\u201d / \u201ccredit leg\u201d) and the \npresent value of premium payable called (\u201cpremium leg\u201d). If the value of  credit leg is less than the \nvalue of the premium leg, then the marked -to-market value for the protection seller in positive. \nTherefore, the protection seller will have exposure to the counterparty (protection buyer) if the value of \npremium leg is more tha n the value of credit leg. In case, no premium is outstanding, the value of \npremium leg will be zero and the mark -to-market value of the CDS contract will always be negative for \nthe protection seller and therefore, protection seller will not have any expos ure to the protection \nbuyer. In no case, the protection seller\u2019s exposure on protection buyer can exceed the amount of the \npremium unpaid. For the purpose of capital adequacy as well as exposure norms, the measure of \ncounterparty exposures in case of CDS t ransaction held in Trading Book is the   Potential Future \nExposure (PFE) which is measured and recognised as per Current Exposure Method.  \n150 The add -on factors will be the same regardless of maturity of the reference obligations or CDS \ncontract.   \n175 Table 4: Add -on factors for Protection Buyers  \n(As % of Notional Principal of CDS)  \nType of Reference Obligation151 Add-on factor  \nObligations rated BBB - and above  10% \nBelow BBB - and unrated  20% \n \n7.3 Capital Charge for Counterparty risk for Collateralised Transactions in CDS  \nThe counterparty exposure for CDS traded in the OTC market will be calculated as per the \nCurrent Exposure Method. Under this method,  the calculation of the counterparty credit risk \ncharge for an individual contract, taking into account the collateral, will be as follows:  \n \nCounterparty risk capital charge = [(RC + add -on) \u2013 CA] x r x 9%  \nwhere:  \n \nRC = the replacement cost,  \n \nadd-on = the a mount for potential future exposure calculated according to  \nparagraph 7 above.  \n \nCA = the volatility adjusted amount of eligible collateral under the comprehensive  \napproach prescribed in section 10 .3 \u201cCredit Risk Mitigation Techniques - Collateralised \nTransa ctions\u201d of these guidelines, or zero if no eligible collateral is applied to the transaction, \nand \n \nr = the risk weight of the counterparty.  \n \n8. Treatment of Exposures Below Materiality Thresholds   \nMateriality thresholds on payments below which no payment i s made in the event of loss are \nequivalent to retained first loss positions and should be assigned risk weight of 1250% for \ncapital adequacy purpose by the protection buyer.   \n \n9.     General Provisions Requirements  \nAt present, general provisions (standard  asset provisions) are required only for Loans and \nAdvances and the positive marked -to-market values of derivatives contracts. For all CDS \npositions including the hedged positions, both in the Banking Book and Trading Book, AIFIs \nshould hold general provis ions for gross positive marked -to-market values of the CDS \ncontracts.  \n \n10. Prudential Treatment Post -Credit Event   \n10.1  Protection Buyer  \nIn case the credit event payment is not received within the period as stipulated in the CDS \ncontract, the protection b uyer shall ignore the credit protection of the CDS and reckon the \ncredit exposure on the underlying asset and maintain appropriate level of capital and \nprovisions as warranted for the exposure. On receipt of the credit event payment, (a) the \n                                            \n151 The add -on factors will be the same regardless of maturity of the reference obligations or CDS \ncontract.  \n  \n176 underlying ass et shall be removed from the books if it has been delivered to the protection \nseller or (b) the book value of the underlying asset shall be reduced to the extent of credit \nevent payment received if the credit event payment does not fully cover the book val ue of \nthe underlying asset and appropriate provisions shall be maintained for the reduced value.  \n \n10.2 Protection Seller  \n10.2.1  From the date of credit event and until the credit event payment in accordance with \nthe CDS contract, the protection seller sha ll debit the Profit and Loss account and recognise \na liability to pay to the protection buyer, for an amount equal to fair value of the contract \n(notional of credit protection less expected recovery value). In case, the fair value of the \ndeliverable obliga tion (in case of physical settlement) / reference obligation (in case of cash \nsettlement) is not available after the date of the credit event, then until the time that value is \navailable, the protection seller should debit the Profit and Loss account for t he full amount of \nthe protection sold and recognise a liability to pay to the protection buyer equal to that \namount.  \n \n10.2.2  In case of physical settlement, after the credit event payment, the protection seller \nshall recognise the assets received, if any,  from the protection buyer at the fair value. These \ninvestments will be classified as non -performing investments and valued in terms of \n\u201cPrudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio \u201d \nprescribed in Chapter V of these Directions.  Thereafter, the protection seller shall subject \nthese assets to the appropriate prudential treatment as applicable to corporate bonds.   \n \n11. Exposure Norms  \n11.1 For the present, the CDS is primarily intended to provide an avenue to investors for \nhedging credit risk in the corporate bonds, after they have invested in the bonds. It should, \ntherefore, not be used as a substitute for a guarantee. Accordingly, an AIFI should not sell \ncredit protection by writing a CDS on a corporate bond on the dat e of its issuance in the \nprimary market  or undertake, before or at the time of issuance of the bonds, to write such \nprotection in future152. \n \n11.2 Exposure on account of all CDS contracts will be aggregated and combined with \nother on -balance sheet and off -balance sheet exposures against the reference entity for the \npurpose of complying with the exposure norms.  \n \n11.3 Protection Seller  \n(i)  A protection seller will recognise an exposure to the reference entity of the CDS \ncontract equal to the amount of credit p rotection sold, subject to paragraph (ii) below.  \n \n(ii)  If a market maker has two completely identical opposite positions in CDS forming a \nhedged position which qualifies for capital adequacy treatment in terms of paragraph 6.2.1(i), \nno exposure would be reckoned against the reference entity.  \n \n(iii) Protection seller will also recognise an exposure to the counterparty equal to the total \ncredit exposure calculated under Current Exposure Method as prescribed in Basel II \nframework in the case of all CDS posit ions held in the Trading Book.  \n                                            \n152 As per extant instructions issued by the Reserve Bank , banks are not permitted to guarantee the \nrepayment of principal and/or interest due on corporate bonds . Considering this restriction, AIFIs\u2019 \nwriting credit protection through CDS on a corporate bond on the date of its issuance or undertaking, \nbefore or at the time of issuance, to write such protection in future, will be deemed to be a violation of \nthe said  instructions.   \n177  \n11.4 Protection Buyer  \n(i) In respect of obligations hedged in the Banking Book as indicated in paragraph 5.1 \nand Trading Book as indicated in paragraph 6.2.1 (ii), the protection buyer will not reckon \nany exposure on the re ference entity. The exposure will be deemed to have been transferred \non the protection seller to the extent of protection available.  \n \n(ii) In all other cases where the obligations in Banking Book or Trading Book are hedged \nby CDS positions, the protection  buyer will continue to reckon the exposure on the reference \nentity equal to the outstanding position of the underlying asset.  \n \n(iii) For all bought CDS positions (hedged and un -hedged) held in Trading Book, the \nprotection buyer will also reckon exposure o n the counterparties to the CDS contracts as \nmeasured by the Current Exposure Method.  \n \n(iv)  The protection buyer needs to adhere to all the criteria required for transferring the \nexposures fully to the protection seller in terms of paragraph (i) above on an on -going basis \nso as to qualify for exposure relief on the underlying asset. In case any of these criteria are \nnot met subsequently, the AIFI will have to reckon the exposure on the underlying asset. \nTherefore, AIFIs should restrict the total exposure t o an obligor including that covered by \nway of various unfunded credit protections (guarantees, LCs, standby LCs, CDS, etc.) within \nan internal exposure ceiling considered appropriate by the Board of the AIFI in such a way \nthat it does not breach the single  / group borrower exposure limit prescribed by the Reserve \nBank . In case of the event of any breach in the single / group borrower exposure limit, the \nentire exposure in excess of the limit will be risk weighted at 1250%. In order to ensure that \nconsequent  upon such a treatment, the AIFI does not breach the minimum capital \nrequirement prescribed by the Reserve Bank , it should keep sufficient cushion in capital in \ncase it assumes exposures in excess of normal exposure limit.  \n \n(v) In respect of bought CDS po sitions held in Trading Book which are not meant for \nhedging, the protection buyer will not reckon any exposure against the reference entity153.  \n \n12.  Reporting Requirements  \nAIFIs should report \u201ctotal exposure\u201d in all cases where they have assumed exposures  \nagainst borrowers in excess of the normal single / group exposure limits due to the credit \nprotections obtained by them through CDS, guarantees or any other instruments of credit \nrisk transfer, to the Department of Supervision (D OS) on a quarterly basis.  \n                                            \n153 In a CDS transaction, the protection buyer does not suffer a loss when reference entity defaults; it \nrather gains in such a situation.   \n178 Annex 7  \n(section  10.3.6) \nPart \u2013 A \nIllustrations on Credit Risk Mitigation (Loan - Exposures)  \nCalculation of Exposure amount for collateralised transactions  \nE * = Max { 0, [ E x (1 + H e ) \u2013 C x ( 1 \u2013 Hc \u2013 HFX ) ] } \nWhere,  \nE*    =   Exposure value after risk  mitigation  \nE      =  Current value of the exposure  \nHe    =  Haircut appropriate to the exposure  \nC      =  Current value of the collateral received  \nHc    =  Haircut appropriate to the collateral  \nHFX = Haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the c ollateral and      \nexposure  \nSly.  \nNo. Particulars  Case \nI Case 2  Case 3  Case 4  Case 5  \n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) \n1 Exposure  100 100 100 100 100 \n2 Maturity of the \nexposure  2 3 6 3 3 \n3 Nature of the \nexposure  Corporate \nLoan  Corporate \nLoan  Corporate \nLoan  Corporate \nLoan  Corporate \nLoan  \n4 Currency  INR INR USD  INR INR \n5 Exposure in \nrupees  100 100 4000  \n(Row 1 x \nexch. \nrate##)  100 100 \n6 Rating of \nexposure  BB A BBB- AA B- \nApplicable Risk \nweight  150 50 100@  30 150 \n7 Haircut for \nexposure*  0 0 0 0 0 \n8 Collatera l 100 100 4000  2 100 \n9 Currency  INR INR INR USD  INR \n10 Collateral in Rs.  \n 100 100 4000  80 \n(Row 1 x \nExch. \nRate ) 100 \n11 Residual maturity \nof collateral \n(years)  2 3 6 3 5 \n12 Nature of \ncollateral  Sovereign \n(GoI) \nSecurity  Bank \nBonds  Corporate \nBonds  Foreign \nCorporate \nBonds  Units of \nMutual \nFunds  \n13 Rating of \nCollateral  NA Unrated  BBB AAA (S & \nP) AA  \n179 14 Haircut for \ncollateral  \n(%) 0.02 0.06 0.12 0.04 0.08 \n15 Haircut for \ncurrency \nmismatches ( %) \n[section 10 .3.7 (vi) \nof circular]  0 0 0.08 0.08 0 \n16 Total Hairc ut on \ncollateral  \n[Row 10 x (row \n14+15)]  2 6 800 9.6 8.0 \n17 Collateral after \nhaircut  \n( Row 10 -  Row \n16) 98 94 3200  70.4 92 \n18 Net Exposure  \n(Row 5 \u2013 Row 17 ) 2 6 800 29.6 8 \n19 Risk weight  \n( %) 150 50 100@  30 150 \n20 RWA  \n(Row 18 x 19)  3 3 800 8.88 12 \n \n \n##       Exchange rate assumed to be 1 USD = Rs.40  \n#         Not applicable  \n@       In case of long term ratings, as per section 9 .4.2 of the Chapter , where \u201c+\u201d \nor \u201c-\u201c notation is attached to the rating, the corresponding main rating \ncategory risk weight i s to be  used.

Interest Rate Derivatives  \nThe measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and off -balance -sheet \ninstruments in the trading book, which react to changes in interest rates, (e.g. , forward rate \nagreemen ts (FRAs), other forward contracts, bond futures, interest rate and cross -currency \nswaps and forward foreign exchange positions). Options can be treated in a variety of ways \nas described in para B.1 below. A summary of the rules for dealing with interest r ate \nderivatives is set out in the Table at the end of this section.  \n \n1. Calculation of positions  \nThe derivatives should be converted into positions in the relevant underlying and be \nsubjected to specific and general market risk charges as described in the  guidelines. In order \nto calculate the capital charge, the amounts reported should be the market value of the \nprincipal amount of the underlying or of the notional underlying. For instruments where the \napparent notional amount differs from the effective no tional amount, AIFIs shall use the \neffective notional amount.  \n \n(a) Futures and Forward Contracts, including Forward Rate Agreements  \nThese instruments are treated as a combination of a long and a short position in a notional \ngovernment security. The maturit y of a future or a FRA will be the period until delivery or \nexercise of the contract, plus - where applicable - the life of the underlying instrument. For \nexample, a long position in a June three -month interest rate future (taken in April) is to be \nreporte d as a long position in a government security with a maturity of five months and a \nshort position in a government security with a maturity of two months.  Where a range of \ndeliverable instruments may be delivered to fulfill the contract, the AIFI has flexib ility to elect \nwhich deliverable security goes into the duration ladder but should take account of any \nconversion factor defined by the exchange.  \n \n(b) Swaps  \nSwaps will be treated as two notional positions in government securities with relevant \nmaturities.  For example, an interest rate swap under which an AIFI is receiving floating rate \ninterest and paying fixed will be treated as a long position in a floating rate instrument of \nmaturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short po sition in a fixed -\nrate instrument of maturity equivalent to the residual life of the swap.  For swaps that pay or \nreceive a fixed or floating interest rate against some other reference price, e.g. , a stock \nindex, the interest rate component should be slotte d into the appropriate repricing maturity \ncategory, with the equity component being included in the equity framework.  \nSeparate legs of cross -currency swaps are to be reported in the relevant maturity ladders for \nthe currencies concerned.  \n \n2.  Calculation of capital charges for derivatives under the Standardised Methodology  \n(a) Allowable offsetting of Matched Positions  \nThe following may be excluded from the interest rate maturity framework altogether (for both \nspecific and general market risk);  \n \n\uf0b7 Long and s hort positions (both actual and notional) in identical instruments with \nexactly the same issuer, coupon, currency and maturity.   \n183  \n\uf0b7 A matched position in a future or forward and its corresponding underlying may also \nbe fully offset, (the leg representing the  time to expiry of the future should however \nbe reported) and thus excluded from the calculation.  \n \nWhen the future or the forward comprises a range of deliverable instruments, offsetting of \npositions in the future or forward contract and its underlying is  only permissible in cases \nwhere there is a readily identifiable underlying security which is most profitable for the trader \nwith a short position to deliver. The price of this security, sometimes called the \"cheapest -to-\ndeliver\", and the price of the futu re or forward contract should in such cases move in close \nalignment.  \n \nNo offsetting will be allowed between positions in different currencies; the separate legs of \ncross -currency swaps or forward foreign exchange deals are to be treated as notional \npositi ons in the relevant instruments and included in the appropriate calculation for each \ncurrency.  \n \nIn addition, opposite positions in the same category of instruments can in certain \ncircumstances be regarded as matched and allowed to offset fully. To qualify for this \ntreatment the positions must relate to the same underlying instruments, be of the same \nnominal value and be denominated in the same currency. In addition:  \n \n\uf0b7 for Futures : offsetting positions in the notional or underlying instruments to which the \nfutures contract relates must be for identical products and mature within seven days \nof each other;  \n \n\uf0b7 for Swaps and FRAs : the reference rate (for floating rate positions) must be identical \nand the coupon closely matched (i.e. , within 15 basis points); and  \n \n\uf0b7 for Swaps, FRAs and Forwards : the next interest fixing date or, for fixed coupon \npositions or forwards, the residual maturity must correspond within the following \nlimits:  \n \no less than one month hence: same day;  \no between one month and one year hence: within seve n days;  \no over one year hence: within thirty days.  \n \nAIFIs with large swap books may use alternative formulae for these swaps to calculate the \npositions to be included in the duration ladder. The method would be to calculate the \nsensitivity of the net present  value implied by the change in yield used in the duration \nmethod and allocate these sensitivities into the time -bands set out in Table 15 in section  \n11.3.6.3 of this Chapter.  \n \n (b) Specific Risk  \nInterest rate and currency swaps, FRAs, forward foreign exch ange contracts and interest \nrate futures will not be subject to a specific risk charge. This exemption also applies to \nfutures on an interest rate index. However, in the case of futures contracts where the \nunderlying is a debt security, or an index represe nting a basket of debt securities, a specific \nrisk charge will apply according to the credit risk of the issuer as set out in paragraphs \nabove.  \n \n(c) General Market Risk  \nGeneral market risk applies to positions in all derivative products in the same manner as for \ncash positions, subject only to an exemption for fully or very closely matched positions in  \n184 identical instruments as defined in paragraphs above. The various categories of instruments \nshould be slotted into the maturity ladder and treated according to the rules identified earlier.  \n \n \nTable  A - Summary of Treatment of Interest Rate Derivatives  \n \nInstrument  Specific \nrisk \ncharge  General Market risk \ncharge  \nExchange -traded Future  \n- Government debt security  \n- Corporate debt security  \n- Index on interest rat es \n  \nNo \nYes \nNo  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nOTC Forward  \n- Government debt security  \n- Corporate debt security  \n- Index on interest rates  \n  \nNo \nYes \nNo  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nYes, as two positions  \nFRAs, Swaps  No Yes, as two positions  \nForward Foreign Exchange  No Yes, as one position in \neach currency  \nOptions  \n- Government debt security  \n- Corporate debt security  \n- Index on interest rates  \n- FRAs, Swaps   \nNo \nYes \nNo \nNo  \n \nB. Treatment of Options  \n1. Alternat ive approaches  for measuring price risk for options  are permissible as under:  \n \n\uf0b7 those AIFIs which solely use purchased options154 will be free to use the simplified \napproach described in Section I below;  \n\uf0b7 those AIFIs which also write options will be expected t o use one of the intermediate \napproaches as set out in Section II below.  \n \n2. In the simplified approach , the positions for the options and the associated underlying, \ncash or forward, are not subject to the standardised methodology but rather are \"carved -out\" \nand subject to separately calculated capital charges that incorporate both general market \nrisk and specific risk. The risk numbers thus generated are then added to the capital charges \nfor the relevant category, i.e. , interest rate related instruments, e quities, and foreign \nexchange as described in sections  11.3 to 11.5 of this Chapter. The delta -plus method uses \nthe sensitivity parameters or \"Greek letters\" associated with options to measure their market \nrisk and capital requirements. Under this method, the delta -equivalent position of each \noption becomes part of the standardised methodology set out in sections  11.3 to 11.5 of this \nChapter  with the delta -equivalent amount subject to the applicable general market risk \ncharges. Separate capital charges are then applied to the gamma and Vega risks of the \noption positions. The scenario approach  uses simulation techniques to calculate changes \nin the value of an options portfolio for changes in the level and volatility of its associated \nunderlyings. Under this a pproach, the general market risk charge is determined by the \n                                            \n154 Unless all their written option positions are hedged by perfectly matched long positions in exactly \nthe same options, in which case no capital charge for market risk is required   \n185 scenario \"grid\" (i.e. , the specified combination of underlying and volatility changes) that \nproduces the largest loss. For the delta -plus method and the scenario approach the specific \nrisk capita l charges are determined separately by multiplying the delta -equivalent of each \noption by the specific risk weights set out in sections  11.3 to 11.4 of this Chapter . \nI. Simplified Approach  \n3. AIFIs which handle a limited range of purchased options only wil l be free to use the \nsimplified approach set out in Table B below, for particular trades. As an example of how the \ncalculation would work, if a holder of 100 shares currently valued at Rs.10 each holds an \nequivalent put option with a strike price of Rs.11,  the capital charge would be: Rs.1,000 x 18 \nper cent (i.e. , 9 per cent specific plus 9 per cent general market risk) = Rs.180, less the \namount the option is in the money (Rs.11 \u2013 Rs.10) x 100 = Rs.100, i.e. , the capital charge \nwould be Rs.80. A similar met hodology applies for options whose underlying is a foreign \ncurrency or an interest rate related instrument.  \n \nTable B - Simplified approach: capital charges  \nPosition  Treatment  \nLong cash and Long put  \nOr \nShort cash and Long call  The capital charge will be t he market value of the \nunderlying security155  multiplied by the sum of \nspecific and general market risk charges156 for the \nunderlying less the amount the option is in the money \n(if any) bounded at zero157  \nLong call  \nOr \nLong put  The capital charge will be the l esser of:  \n(i) the market value of the underlying security \nmultiplied by the sum of specific and general market \nrisk charges3 for the underlying  \n(ii) the market value of the option158 \n \nII. Intermediate Approaches  \n(a) Delta -plus Method  \n4.     AIFIs which wri te options will be allowed to include delta -weighted options positions \nwithin the standardised methodology set out in section  11.3 to 11.5 of this Chapter . Such \noptions should be reported as a position equal to the market value of the underlying \nmultiplied  by the delta.  \n \nHowever, since delta does not sufficiently cover the risks associated with options positions, \nAIFIs will also be required to measure gamma (which measures the rate of change of delta) \nand Vega (which measures the sensitivity of the value of  an option with respect to a change \n                                            \n155 In some cases such as foreign exchange, it may be unclear which side is the \"underlying security\"; \nthis should be taken to be the asset which would be received if the option wer e exercised. In addition \nthe nominal value should be used for items where the market value of the underlying instrument could \nbe zero, e.g. , caps and floors, swaptions etc.  \n156 Some options (e.g. , where the underlying is an interest rate or a currency) bear no specific risk, but \nspecific risk will be present in the case of options on certain interest rate -related instruments (e.g. , \noptions on a corporate debt security or corporate bond index; see Section B for the relevant capital \ncharges) and for options on equities and stock indices (see Section C). The charge under this \nmeasure for currency options will be 9 per cent.  \n157 For options with a residual maturity of more than six months, the strike price should be compared \nwith the forward, not current, price. A n AIFI unable to do this must take the in -the-money amount to \nbe zero.  \n158 Where the position does not fall within the trading book (i.e. , options on certain foreign exchange \nor commodities positions not belonging to the trading book), it may be acceptable  to use the book \nvalue instead.   \n186 in volatility) sensitivities in order to calculate the total capital charge. These sensitivities will \nbe calculated according to an approved exchange model or to the AIFI\u2019s proprietary options \npricing model subject to ov ersight by the Reserve Bank159. \n5. Delta -weighted positions with debt securities or interest rates as the underlying will be \nslotted into the interest rate time -bands, as set out in Table 1 5 of section  11.3 of this \nChapter , under the following procedure. A t wo-legged approach should be used as for other \nderivatives, requiring one entry at the time the underlying contract takes effect and a second \nat the time the underlying contract matures. For instance, a bought call option on a June \nthree -month interest -rate future will in April be considered, on the basis of its delta -\nequivalent value, to be a long position with a maturity of five months and a short position with \na maturity of two months160. The written option will be similarly slotted as a long position with  \na maturity of two months and a short position with a maturity of five months. Floating rate \ninstruments with caps or floors will be treated as a combination of floating rate securities and \na series of European -style options. For example, the holder of a t hree-year floating rate bond \nindexed to  a six month reference rate  with a cap of 15 per cent will treat it as:  \n(i) a debt security that reprices in six months; and  \n(ii) a series of five written call options on a FRA with a reference rate of 15 per cent, \neach with a negative sign at the time the underlying FRA takes effect and a positive \nsign at the time the underlying FRA matures161. \n \n6. The capital charge for options with equities as the underlying will also be based on the \ndelta -weighted positions which wil l be incorporated in the measure of market risk described \nin section 11 .4 of this Chapter . For purposes of this calculation each national market is to be \ntreated as a separate underlying. The capital charge for options on foreign exchange and \ngold position s will be based on the method set out in section 11 .5 of this Chapter . For delta \nrisk, the net delta -based equivalent of the foreign currency and gold options will be \nincorporated into the measurement of the exposure for the respective currency (or gold) \nposition.  \n \n7. In addition to the above capital charges arising from delta risk, there will be further \ncapital charges for gamma and for Vega risk. AIFIs using the delta -plus method will be \nrequired to calculate the gamma and Vega for each option position ( including hedge \npositions) separately. The capital charges should be calculated in the following way:  \n(i) for each individual option a \"gamma impact\" should be calculated according to a \nTaylor series expansion as:  \nGamma impact = \u00bd x Gamma x VU\u00b2  \nwhere VU = Variation of the underlying of the option.  \n \n(ii) VU will be calculated  as follows:  \n\uf0b7 for interest rate options if the underlying is a bond, the price sensitivity should \nbe worked out as explained. An equivalent calculation should be carried out \nwhere the und erlying is an interest rate.  \n\uf0b7 for options on equities and equity indices; which are not permitted at present, \n                                            \n159 The Reserve Bank  may wish to require AIFIs doing business in certain classes of exotic options \n(e.g., barriers, digitals) or in options \"at -the-money\" that are close to expiry to use either the scenario \napproach or the intern al models alternative, both of which can accommodate more detailed \nrevaluation approaches.  \n160 Two-months call option on a bond future, where delivery of the bond takes place in September, \nwould be considered in April as being long the bond and short a five -month deposit, both positions \nbeing delta -weighted.  \n161 The rules applying to closely -matched positions set out in paragraph 2 (a) of this Annex will also \napply in this respect.   \n187 the market value of the underlying should be multiplied by 9 per cent162; \n\uf0b7 for foreign exchange and gold options: the market value of the underlying \nshould be multiplied by 9 per cent;  \n \n(iii) For the purpose  of this calculation the following positions should be treated as the \nsame underlyin g: \n\uf0b7 for interest rates,163 each time -band as set out in Table 1 5 of this Chapter ;164 \n\uf0b7 for equities and stock indices, ea ch national market;  \n\uf0b7 for foreign currencies and gold, each currency pair and gold;  \n \n(iv) Each option  on the same underlying will have a gamma impact that is either \npositive or negative. These individual gamma impacts will be summed, resulting in a \nnet gamma  impact for each underlying that is either positive or negative. Only those \nnet gamma impacts that are negative will be included in the capital calculation.  \n \n(v) The total gamma capital charge will be the sum of the absolute value of the net  \nnegative gam ma impacts as calculated above.  \n \n(vi) For volatility risk,  AIFIs will be required to calculate the capital charges by \nmultiplying the sum of the Vegas for all options on the same underlying, as defined \nabove, by a proportional shift in volatility of \u00b1 25 p er cent.  \n \n(vii) The total capital charge for Vega risk will be the sum of the absolute value of the \nindividual capital charges that have been calculated for Vega risk.  \n \n(b)   Scenario Approach  \n8. More sophisticated AIFIs will also have the right to base th e market risk capital charge \nfor options portfolios and associated hedging positions on scenario matrix analysi s. This will \nbe accomplished by specifying a fixed range of changes in the option portfolio\u2019s risk factors \nand calculating changes in the value o f the option portfolio at various points along this \"grid\". \nFor the purpose of calculating the capital charge, the AIFI will revalue the option portfolio \nusing matrices for simultaneous changes in the option\u2019s underlying rate or price and in the \nvolatility  of that rate or price. A different matrix will be set up for each individual underlying as \ndefined in paragraph 7 above. As an alternative, at the discretion of each national authority, \nAIFIs which are significant traders in options for interest rate opti ons will be permitted to \nbase the calculation on a minimum of six sets of time -bands. When using this method, not \nmore than three of the time -bands as defined in section 11 .3 of this Chapter  should be \ncombined into any one set.  \n \n9. The options and related hedging positions will be evaluated over a specified range \nabove and below the current value of the underlying. The range for interest rates is \nconsistent with the assumed changes in yield in Table - 15 of section 11 .3 of this Chapter .   \nThose AIFIs using the alternative method for interest rate options set out in paragraph 8 \nabove should use, for each set of time -bands, the highest of the assumed changes in yield \napplicable to the group to which the time -bands belong.165 The other ranges are \u00b19 per cent \n                                            \n162 The basic rules set out here for interest rate and equity options do not attem pt to capture specific \nrisk when calculating gamma capital charges. However, the Reserve Bank may require specific AIFIs \nto do so.  \n163 Positions have to be slotted into separate maturity ladders by currency.  \n164 AIFIs using the duration method should use the t ime-bands as set out in Table 1 6 of this Chapter . \n165 If, for example, the time -bands 3 to 4 years, 4 to 5 years and 5 to 7 years are combined, the \nhighest assumed change in yield of these three bands would be 0.75.  \n  \n188 for equities and \u00b19 per cent for foreign exchange and gold. For all risk categories, at least \nseven observations (including the current observation) should be used to divide the range \ninto equally spaced intervals.  \n \n10. The second dimension of the matrix entai ls a change in the volatility of the underlying \nrate or price. A single change in the volatility of the underlying rate or price equal to a shift in \nvolatility of + 25 per cent and - 25 per cent is expected to be sufficient in most cases. As \ncircumstances warrant, however, the Reserve Bank may choose to require that a different \nchange in volatility be used and / or that intermediate points on the grid be calculated.  \n \n11. After calculating the matrix, each cell contains the net profit or loss of the option a nd \nthe underlying hedge instrument. The capital charge for each underlying will then be \ncalculated as the largest loss contained in the matrix.  \n \n12. In drawing up these intermediate approaches it has been sought to cover the major \nrisks associated with opt ions. In doing so, it is conscious that so far as specific risk is \nconcerned, only the delta -related elements are captured; to capture other risks would \nnecessitate a much more complex regime. On the other hand, in other areas the simplifying \nassumptions u sed have resulted in a relatively conservative treatment of certain options \npositions.  \n \n13. Besides the options risks mentioned above, the Reserve Bank  is conscious of the \nother risks also associated with options, e.g. , rho (rate of change of the value of  the option \nwith respect to the interest rate) and theta (rate of change of the value of the option with \nrespect to time). While not proposing a measurement system for those risks at present, it \nexpects AIFIs undertaking significant options business at the  very least to monitor such risks \nclosely. Additionally, AIFIs will be permitted to incorporate rho into their capital calculations \nfor interest rate risk, if they wish to do so.   \n189 Annex 9  \n                    (section 16.5) \n \nAn Illustrative Approach for Me asurement of  \nInterest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) under Pillar 2 \nThe AIFIs are required  to measure the interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) and \nhold capital commensurate with it. If supervisors determine that AIFIs are not holding capi tal \ncommensurate with the level of interest rate risk, they must require the AIFI to reduce its \nrisk, to hold a specific additional amount of capital or some combination of the two. To \ncomply with the requirements of Pillar 2 relating to IRRBB, the guideli nes on Pillar 2 issued \nby many regulators contain definite provisions indicating the approach adopted by the \nsupervisors to assess the level of interest rate risk in the banking book and the action to be \ntaken in case the level of interest rate risk found is significant.  \n \n2. The approach prescribed in the BCBS Paper on \u201c Principles for the  \nManagement and Supervision of Interest Rate Risk \u201d \nThe main components of the approach prescribed in the above mentioned supporting \ndocument are as under:  \na) The assessment s hould take into account both the earnings perspective and \neconomic value perspective of interest rate risk.  \n \nb) The impact on income or the economic value of equity should be calculated by \napplying a notional interest rate shock of 200 basis points.  \n \nc) The usua l methods followed in measuring the interest rate risk are:  \na) Earnings perspective  \nGap Analysis, simulation techniques and Internal Models based on VaR  \n \nb) Economic perspective  \nGap analysis combined with duration gap analysis, simulation techniques and \nInternal  Models based on VaR  \n \n3. Methods for measurement of the IRRBB  \n3.1 Impact on Earnings  \nThe major methods used for computing the impact on earnings are the Gap Analysis, \nSimulations and VaR based Techniques. AIFIs may  use the Gap Reports to assess the \nimpact  of adverse movements in the interest rate on income through gap method. \nHowever, the AIFIs may use the simulations also. The AIFIs may calculate the impact on \nthe earnings by gap analysis or any other method with the assumed change in yield on \n200 bps ove r one year. However, no capital needs to be allocated for the impact on the \nearnings.    \n3.2.1  Method indicated in the BCBS Paper on \u201cPrinciples for the Management and \nSupervision of Interest Rate Risk \u201d \nThe following steps are involved in this approach:  \na) The variables such as maturity/re -pricing date, coupon rate, frequency, \nprincipal amount for each item of asset/liability (for each category of asset / \nliability) are generated.  \n \nb) The longs and shorts in each time band are offset.   \n190  \nc) The resulting short and long positions are weighted by a factor that is \ndesigned to reflect the sensitivity of the positions in the different time bands to \nan assumed change in interest rates. These factors are based on an \nassumed parallel shift of 200 basis points throughout the  time spectrum, and \non a proxy of modified duration of positions situated at the middle of each \ntime band and yielding 5 per cent.  \n \nd) The resulting weighted positions are summed up, offsetting longs and shorts, \nleading to the net short - or long -weighted posi tion.  \n \ne) The weighted position is seen in relation to capital.  \n \nFor details AIFIs may refer to the Annex 3 and 4  of captioned paper issued by the BCBS166.  \n \n3.2.2  Other techniques for Interest rate risk measurement  \nThe AIFIs can also follow different versio ns / variations of the above techniques or entirely \ndifferent techniques to measure the IRRBB if they find them conceptually sound. In this \ncontext, Annex 1 and 2 of the BCBS paper referred to above provide broad details of \ninterest rate risk measurement t echniques and overview of some of the factors which the \nsupervisory authorities might consider in obtaining and analysing the information on \nindividual AIFI\u2019s exposures to interest rate risk.  \n \n4. Suggested approach for measuring the impact of IRRBB on cap ital  \n \n4.1 If the supervisor feels that the AIFI is not holding capital commensurate with the level \nof IRRBB, it may either require the AIFI to reduce the risk or allocate additional capital or a \ncombination of the two.  \n \n4.2 The AIFIs can decide, with the  approval of the Board, on the appropriate level of \ninterest rate risk in the banking book which they would like to carry keeping in view their \ncapital level, interest rate management skills and the ability to re -balance the banking book \nportfolios quickly  in case of adverse movement in the interest rates. The AIFIs may be \nrequired to hold additional capital if the level of interest rate risk is considered, by the \nReserve Bank , to be high in relation to their capital level or the quality of interest rate r isk \nmanagement framework obtaining in the AIFI. While the AIFIs may on their own decide to \nhold additional capital towards IRRBB keeping in view the IRR management skills and the \nability to re -balance the portfolios quickly in case of adverse movement in t he interest rates, \nthe amount of exact capital add -on, if considered necessary, will be decided by the Reserve \nBank  as part of the SREP, in consultation with the AIFI.  \n \n5. Limit setting  \nThe AIFIs would be well advised to consider setting the internal limi ts for controlling their \nIRRBB. The following are some of the indicative ways for setting the limits:  \na) Internal limits could be fixed in terms of the maximum decline in earnings (as \na percentage of the base -scenario income) or decline in capital (as a \nperce ntage of the base -scenario capital position) as a result of 200 or 300 \nbasis point interest -rate shock.  \nb) The limits could also be placed in terms of PV01 value (present value of a \nbasis point) of the net position of the AIFI as a percentage of net worth/cap ital \nof the AIFI. \n                                            \n166 Principles for the Management and Super vision of Interest Rate Risk (July 2004) .  \n191 Annex 10  \n (section  7.5.2) \n \nInvestments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities which are \nOutside the Scope of Regulatory Consolidation  \n \nPART A: Details of Regulatory Capital Structure of a n AIFI \n(Rs.

What is an ICAAP document?  \nThe ICAAP Document would be a comprehensive Paper furnishin g detailed \ninformation on the ongoing assessment of the AIFI\u2019s entire spectrum of risks, how the AIFI \nintends to mitigate those risks and how much current and future capital is necessary for the \nAIFI, reckoning other mitigating factors. The purpose of the ICAAP document is to apprise \nthe Board of the AIFI on these aspects as also to explain to the Reserve Bank  the AIFI\u2019s \ninternal capital adequacy assessment process and the AIFIs\u2019 approach to capital \nmanagement. The ICAAP could also be based on the existing internal documentation of the \nAIFI. \nThe ICAAP document submitted to the Reserve Bank  should be formally approved \nby the AIFI\u2019s Board. It is expected that the document would be prepared in a format that \nwould be easily understood at the senior levels of man agement and would contain all the \nrelevant information necessary for the AIFI and the Reserve Bank  to make an informed \njudgment as to the appropriate capital level of the AIFI and its risk management approach. \nWhere appropriate, technical information on ri sk measurement methodologies, capital \nmodels, if any, used and all other work carried out to validate the approach (e.g. , Board  \npapers and minutes, internal or external reviews) could be furnished to the Reserve Bank  as \nappendices to the ICAAP Document.  \n \n2. Contents  \nThe ICAAP Document should contain the following sections:  \nI. Executive Summary  \nII. Background  \nIII. Summary of current and projected financial and capital positions   \nIV. Capital Adequacy  \nV. Key sensitivities and future scenarios  \nVI. Aggregation and diversification   \nVII. Testing and adoption of the ICAAP  \nVIII. Use of the ICAAP within the AIFI \n  \nI. Executive Summary  \nThe purpose of the Executive Summary is to present an overview of the ICAAP methodology \nand results. This overview would typically include:  \na) the purpose of the repo rt and the regulated entities within a group that are \ncovered by the ICAAP;  \nb) the main findings of the ICAAP analysis:  \ni. how much and what composition of internal capital the AIFI considers it \nshould hold as compared with the minimum CRAR requirement (CRAR) \nunder \u2018Pillar 1\u2019 calculation, and  \nii. the adequacy of the AIFI\u2019s risk management processes;  \nc) a summary of the financial position of the AIFI, including the strategic position \nof the AIFI, its balance sheet strength, and future profitability;  \nd) brief descriptions of  the capital raising and dividend plan including how the \nAIFI intends to manage its capital in the days ahead and for what purposes;   \n199 e) commentary on the most material risks to which the AIFI is exposed, why the \nlevel of risk is considered acceptable or, if i t is not, what mitigating actions are \nplanned;  \nf) commentary on major issues where further analysis and decisions are \nrequired; and  \ng) who has carried out the assessment, how it has been challenged / validated / \nstress tested, and who has approved it.  \n \nII. Backg round  \nThis section would cover the relevant organisational and historical financial data for the AIFI. \ne.g., group structure (legal and operational), operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, \ndividends, shareholders\u2019  funds, capital funds held  vis-\u00e0-vis the regulatory requirements, \ncustomer deposits, deposits by AIFIs, total assets, and any conclusions that can be drawn \nfrom trends in the data which may have implications for the AIFI\u2019s future.  \n \nIII. Summary of current and projected financial an d capital positions  \nThis section would explain the present financial position of the AIFI and expected changes to \nthe current business profile, the environment in which it expects to operate, its projected \nbusiness plans (by appropriate lines of business),  projected financial position, and future \nplanned sources of capital.  \nThe starting balance sheet used as reference and date as of which the assessment is \ncarried out should be indicated.  \nThe projected financial position could reckon both the projected capi tal available and \nprojected capital requirements based on envisaged business plans. These might then \nprovide a basis against which adverse scenarios might be compared.  \n \nIV. Capital Adequacy  \nThis section might start with a description of the AIFI\u2019s risk app etite, in quantitative terms, as \napproved by the AIFI\u2019s Board and used in the ICAAP. It would be necessary to clearly spell \nout in the document whether what is being presented represents the AIFI\u2019s view of the \namount of capital required to meet minimum regulatory needs  or whether represents the \namount of capital that a n AIFI believes it would need to meet its business plans . For \ninstance, it should be clearly brought out whether the capital required is based on a \nparticular credit rating desired by the AIFI or includes buffers for strategic purposes or seeks \nto minimise the chance of breaching regulatory requirements. Where economic capital \nmodels are used for internal capital assessment, the confidence level, time horizon, and \ndescription of the event to wh ich the confidence level relates, should also be enumerated.  \nWhere scenario analyses or other means are used for capital assessment, then the basis / \nrationale for selecting the chosen severity of scenarios used, should also be included.  \nThe section would  then include a detailed review of the capital adequacy of the AIFI. \nThe information provided would include the following elements:  \nIV.1 Timing  \n\uf0b7 the effective date of the ICAAP calculations together with details of any events \nbetween this date and the date of submission to the Board / the Reserve Bank  which \nwould materially impact the ICAAP calculations together with their effects; and  \n\uf0b7 details of, and rationale for, the time period selected for which capital requirement \nhas been assessed.  \n \n \n \n  \n200 IV.2 Risks Analyse d \n\uf0b7 an identification of the major risks faced by the AIFI in each of the following \ncategories:  \na) credit risk  \nb) market risk  \nc) operational risk  \nd) liquidity risk  \ne) concentration risk  \nf) interest rate risk in the banking book  \ng) residual risk  of securitisation  \nh) strategic risk  \ni) business risk  \nj) reputation risk  \nk) group risk  \nl) pension obligation risk  \nm) other residual risk; and  \nn) any other risks that might have been identified  \n\uf0b7 for each of these risks, an explanation of how the risk has been assessed and to the \nextent possible, the quantitati ve results  of that assessment;  \n\uf0b7 where some of these risks have been highlighted in the report of the Reserve Bank \u2019s \non-site inspection of the AIFI, an explanation of how the AIFI has mitigated these;  \n\uf0b7 where relevant, a comparison of the Reserve Bank -assessed  CRAR during on -site \ninspection with the results of the CRAR calculations of the AIFI under the ICAAP;  \n\uf0b7 a clear articulation of the AIFI\u2019s risk appetite, in quantitative terms, by risk category \nand the extent of its consistency (its \u2018fit\u2019) with the overall assessment of AIFI\u2019s various \nrisks; and  \n\uf0b7 where relevant, an explanation of any other methods, apart from capital, used by the \nAIFI to mitigate the risks.  \nIV.3 Methodology and Assumptions  \nA description of how assessments for each of the major risks have been  approached and the \nmain assumptions made.  \nFor instance, AIFIs may choose to base their ICAAP on the results of the CRAR calculation \nwith the capital for additional risks (e.g. , concentration risk, interest rate risk in the banking \nbook, etc.) assessed se parately and added to the Pillar 1 computations. Alternatively, AIFIs \ncould choose to base their ICAAP on internal models for all risks, including those covered \nunder the CRAR (i.e. , Credit, Market and Operational Risks).  \nThe description here would make cl ear which risks are covered by which modelling or \ncalculation approach. This would include details of the methodology and process used to \ncalculate risks in each of the categories identified and reason for choosing the method used \nin each case.  \nWhere the AIFI uses an internal model for the quantification of its risks, this section should \nexplain for each of those models:  \n\uf0b7 the key assumptions and parameters within the capital modelling work and \nbackground information on the derivation of any key assumptions;  \n\uf0b7 how parameters have been chosen, including the historical period used and the \ncalibration process;  \n\uf0b7 the limitations of the model;   \n201 \uf0b7 the sensitivity of the model to changes in those key assumptions or parameters \nchosen; and  \n\uf0b7 the validation work undertaken to en sure the continuing adequacy of the model.  \nWhere stress tests or scenario analyses have been used to validate, supplement, or probe \nthe results of other modelling approaches, then this section should provide:  \n\uf0b7 details of simulations to capture risks not wel l estimated by the AIFI\u2019s internal \ncapital model (e.g. , non-linear products, concentrations, illiquidity and shifts in \ncorrelations in a crisis period);  \n\uf0b7 details of the quantitative results of stress tests and scenario analyses the AIFI \ncarried out and the confidence levels and key assumptions behind those \nanalyses, including, the distribution of outcomes obtained for the main individual \nrisk factors;  \n\uf0b7 details of the range of combined adverse scenarios which have been applied, \nhow these were derived and the r esulting capital requirements; and  \n\uf0b7 where applicable, details of any additional business -unit-specific or business -\nplan-specific stress tests selected.  \nIV.4 Capital Transferability  \nIn case of AIFIs with conglomerate structure, details of any restrictions on  the management\u2019s \nability to transfer capital into or out of the business(es) arising from, for example, by \ncontractual, commercial, regulatory or statutory constraints that apply, should be furnished. \nAny restrictions applicable and flexibilities availabl e for distribution of dividend by the entities \nin the Group could also be enumerated. In case of overseas subsidiaries of the AIFIs, the \nregulatory restrictions would include the minimum regulatory capital level acceptable to the \nhost-country regulator of the subsidiary, after declaration of dividend.  \n \nV. Firm -wide risk oversight and specific  aspects of risk management 167 \nV.1 Risk Management System in the AIFI \nThis section would describe the risk management infrastructure within the AIFI along \nthe following lines:  \n\u2022 The oversight of Board  and senior management  \n\u2022 Policies, Procedures and Limits  \n\u2022 Identification,  measurement, mitigation, controlling and reporting of risks  \n\u2022 MIS at the firm wide level  \n\u2022 Internal controls  \n \nV.2 Off-balance Sheet Exposures with a focus on Securitisation  \nThis section woul d comprehensively discuss and analyse underlying risks inherent in \nthe off -balance sheet exposures particularly its investment in structured products. \nWhen assessing securitisation exposures, AIFI should thoroughly analyse th e credit \nquality and risk characteristics of the underlying exposures. This section should also \ncomprehensively explain the maturity of the exposures underlying securitisation \ntransactions relative to issued liabilities in order to assess potential maturit y \nmismatches.  \n \n \n \n                                            \n167 Master Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.73/21.06.001/2009 -10 dated Feb 8, 2010  addressed to banks .  \n202 V.3 Assessment of Reputational Risk and Implicit Support  \nThis section should discuss the possibilities of reputational risk leading to provision of \nimplicit support, which might give rise to credit, market and legal risks. This section \nshoul d thoroughly discuss potential sources of reputational risk to the AIFI. \n \nV. 4   Assessment of valuation  and Liquidity Risk \nThis section would describe the governance structures and control processes for \nvaluing exposures for risk management and financial reporting purposes, with a \nspecial focus on valuation of illiquid positions. This section will have relevant details \nleading to establishment and verification of valuations for instruments and transactions \nin which it engages.  \n \nV. 5 Stress Testing practice s \nThis section would explain the role of Board  and senior management in setting stress \ntesting objectives, defining scenarios, discussing the results of stress tests, assessing \npotential actions and decision making on the basis of results of stress tests. This \nsection would also describe the rigorous and forward looking stress testing that \nidentifies possible events or changes in market conditions that could adversely the \nAIFI. The Reserve Bank  would assess the effectiveness of AIFIs\u2019 stress testing \nprogram me in identifying relevant vulnerabilities.  \n \nV. 6 Sound compensation practices  \nThis section should describe the compensation practices followed by the AIFI and how \nfar the compensation practices are linked to long -term capital preservation and the \nfinancia l strength of the firm. The calculation of risk -adjusted performance measure for \nthe employees and its link, if any, with the compensation should clearly be disclosed in \nthis section . \n \nVI. Key sensitivities and future scenarios  \nThis section would explain how a n AIFI would be affected by an economic recession or \ndownswings in the business cycle or markets relevant to its activities. The Reserve Bank  \nwould like to be apprised as to how a n AIFI would manage its business and capital so as to \nsurvive a recessio n while meeting the minimum regulatory standards. The analysis would \ninclude future financial projections for, say, three to five years based on business plans and \nsolvency calculations.  \nFor the purpose of this analysis, the severity of the recession recko ned should typically be \none that occurs only once in a 25 year period. The time horizon would be from the day of the \nICAAP calculation to at least the deepest part of the recession envisaged.  \n \nTypical scenarios would include:  \n\uf0b7  how an economic downturn woul d affect:  \n\uf0a7 the AIFI\u2019s capital funds and future earnings; and  \n\uf0a7 the AIFI\u2019s CRAR taking into account future changes in its projected \nbalance sheet.  \n\uf0b7 In both cases, it would be helpful if these projections show separately the effects of \nmanagement actions to chan ge the AIFI\u2019s business strategy and the implementation \nof contingency plans.  \n  \n203 \uf0b7 projections of the future CRAR would include the effect of changes in the credit \nquality of the AIFI\u2019s credit risk counterparties (including migration in their ratings \nduring a r ecession) and the AIFI\u2019s capital and its credit risk capital requirement;  \n\uf0b7 an assessment by the AIFI of any other capital planning actions to enable it to \ncontinue to meet its regulatory capital requirements throughout a recession such as \nnew capital inject ions from related companies or new share issues;  \n\uf0b7 This section would also explain which key macroeconomic factors are being \nstressed, and how those have been identified as drivers of the AIFI\u2019s earnings. The \nAIFI would also explain how the macroeconomic fac tors affect the key parameters of \nthe internal model by demonstrating, for instance, how the relationship between the \ntwo has been established.  \n \n \nVII. Management  Actions  \nThis section would elaborate on the management actions assumed in deriving the ICAAP, in \nparticular:  \n\uf0b7 the quantitative impact of management actions \u2013 sensitivity testing of key \nmanagement actions and revised ICAAP figures with management actions excluded.  \n\uf0b7 evidence of management actions implemented in the past during similar periods of \neconom ic stress.  \n \nVII. Aggregation and Diversification  \nThis section would describe how the results of the various separate risk assessments are \nbrought together and an overall view taken on capital adequacy.  At a technical level, this \nwould, therefore, require some method to be used to combine the various risks using some \nappropriate quantitative techniques. At the broader level, the overall reasonableness of the \ndetailed quantification approaches might be compared with the results of an analysis of \ncapital plan ning and a view taken by senior management as to the overall level of capital \nthat is considered appropriate.  \n\uf0b7 In enumerating the process of technical aggregation, the following aspects could be \ncovered:  \ni) any allowance made for diversification, including any  assumed correlations \nwithin risks and between risks and how such correlations have been \nassessed, including in stressed conditions;  \n \nii) the justification for any credit taken for diversification benefits between legal \nentities, and the justification for the free movement of capital, if any assumed, \nbetween them in times of financial stress;  \n \niii) the impact of diversification benefits with management actions excluded. It \nmight be helpful to work out revised ICAAP figures with all correlations set to \n\u20181\u2019 i.e., no d iversification; and similar figures with all correlations set to \u20180\u2019 i.e. , \nassuming all risks are independent i.e., full diversification.  \n\uf0b7 As regards the overall assessment, this should describe how the AIFI has arrived at \nits overall assessment of the capi tal it needs taking into account such matters as:  \ni) the inherent uncertainty in any modelling approach;  \nii) weaknesses in the AIFI\u2019s risk management procedures, systems or controls;  \niii) the differences between regulatory capital and internal capital; and   \n204 iv) the differi ng purposes that capital serves: shareholder returns, rating \nobjectives for the AIFI as a whole or for certain debt instruments the AIFI has \nissued, avoidance of regulatory intervention, protection against uncertain \nevents, depositor protection, working ca pital, capital held for strategic \nacquisitions, etc.  \n \nVIII. Testing and Adoption of the ICAAP  \nThis section would describe the extent of challenging and testing that the ICAAP has been \nsubjected to. It would thus include the testing and control processes ap plied to the ICAAP \nmodels and calculations. It should also describe the process of review of the test results by \nthe senior management or the Board and the approval of the results by them.  A copy of any \nrelevant report placed before the senior management or the Board of the AIFI in this regard, \nalong with their response, could be attached to the ICAAP Document sent to the Reserve \nBank . \n \nDetails of the reliance placed on any external service providers or consultants in the testing \nprocess, for instance, for  generating economic scenarios, could also be detailed here.  \n \nIn addition, a copy of any report obtained from an external reviewer or internal audit should \nalso be sent to the Reserve Bank . \n \nIX. Use of the ICAAP within the AIFI \nThis section would contain i nformation to demonstrate the extent to which the concept of \ncapital management is embedded within the AIFI, including the extent and use of capital \nmodelling or scenario analyses and stress testing within the AIFI\u2019s capital management \npolicy. For instance , use of ICAAP in setting pricing and charges and the level and nature of \nfuture business, could be an indicator in this regard.  \n \nThis section could also include a statement of the AIFI\u2019s actual operating philosophy on \ncapital management and how this fits in to the ICAAP Document submitted. For instance, \ndifferences in risk appetite used in preparing the ICAAP Document vis -\u00e0-vis that used for \nbusiness decisions might be discussed.    \nLastly, the AIFIs may also furnish the details of any anticipated future r efinements envisaged \nin the ICAAP (highlighting those aspects which are work -in-progress) apart from any other \ninformation that the AIFI believes would be helpful to the Reserve Bank  in reviewing the \nICAAP Document.   \n205  \nAnnex 14  \n(section  7.2.4) \n \nMinimum Requ irements to Ensure Loss Absorbency of Additional Tier 1 Instruments \nat Pre -specified Trigger and of All Non -equity Regulatory Capital Instruments at the \nPoint of Non -viability168 \n \n1. Introduction  \n1.1 As indicated in section 7 .2.4 of this Chapter , under Basel  III non -common equity \nelements to be included in Tier 1 capital should absorb losses while the AIFI remains a going \nconcern. Towards this end, one of the important criteria for Additional Tier 1 instruments is \nthat these instruments should have principal loss absorption through either (i) conversion \ninto common shares or (ii) a write -down mechanism, which allocates losses to the \ninstrument at an objective pre -specified trigger point.  \n1.2 During the financial crisis a number of distressed banks were rescue d by the public \nsector injecting funds in the form of common equity and other forms of Tier 1 capital. While \nthis had the effect of supporting depositors it also meant that Tier 2 capital instruments \n(mainly subordinated debt), and in some cases Tier 1 ins truments, did not absorb losses \nincurred by certain large internationally -active banks that would have failed had the public \nsector not provided support. Therefore, Basel III requires that the terms and conditions of all \nnon-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 capita l instruments issued by a n AIFI must have a provision \nthat requires such instruments, at the option of the relevant authority, to either be written off \nor converted into common equity upon the occurrence of the trigger event.  \n1.3 Therefore, in order for an instrument issued by a n AIFI to be included in Additional \n(i.e., non-common) Tier 1 or in Tier 2 capital, in addition to criteria for individual types of non -\nequity regulatory capital instruments mentioned  in Annex 2, 3, 4 and 5, it must also meet or \nexceed minimum requirements set out in the following paragraphs.  \n \n2. Loss Absorption of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Instruments at the Pre -specified  \nTrigger   \nI. Loss Absorption Features  \n2.1 One of the criteria for AT1 capital instruments169 requires that these instruments \nshould have principal loss absorption at an objective pre -specified trigger point through \neither:  \n(i) conversion to common shares, or  \n \n(ii) a write -down mechanism which allocates losses to the instrument.  \n \nThe write -down will have the following effects:  \n(a) reduce the claim of the instrument in liquidation;  \n(b) reduce the amount re -paid when a call is exercised; and  \n(c) partially or fu lly reduce coupon/dividend payments on the instrument.  \n                                            \n168 Please refer to paragraph 2 of the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.38/21.06.201/2014 -15 dated \nSeptember 1, 2014  addressed to banks  on Implementation of Basel III  Capital Regulations in India -\nAmendments . \n169 Please refer to the Appendices 4 & 5 of the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.98 /21.06.201/2011 -12 dated \nMay 2, 2012  addressed to banks  on \u2018Guidelines on Implementation of Basel III Capital R egulations in \nIndia\u2019.   \n206  \n2.2 Accordingly, AIFIs may issue AT1 instruments with either conversion170 or write -down \n(temporary or permanent)171 mechanism.  \n \nII. Level  of Pre -specified Trigger and Amount of Equity to be Created by \nConve rsion / Write -down  \n2.3 The pre -specified trigger for loss absorption through conversion / write -down of \nAdditional Tier 1 instruments (PNCPS and PDI) must be at least Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital of 6.125% of RWAs.  The write-down of any Common Equity Tier  1 capital shall not \nbe required before a write -down of any Additional Tier 1 capital instrument.  \n \n2.4 The conversion / write -down mechanism (temporary or permanent) which allocates \nlosses to the Additional Tier 1 instruments ( AT1) instruments must generat e Common Equity \nTier 1 ( CET1) under applicable Indian Accounting Standards. The instrument will receive \nrecognition in AT1 capital only upto the extent of minimum level of CET1 generated (i.e. , net \nof contingent liability recognised under the Indian Accoun ting Standards, potential tax \nliabilities, etc., if any) by a full write -down / conversion of the instrument.  \n \n2.5 AIFIs shall obtain  and keep on their records  a certificate from the statutory auditors \nclearly stating that the conversion / write -down mecha nism chosen by the AIFI for a \nparticular AT1 issuance is able to generate CET1 under the prevailing accounting \nstandards172. Further, AIFIs shall also obtain  and keep on their records  an external legal \nopinion confirming that the conversion or write -down of Additional Tier 1 capital instrument at \nthe pre -specified trigger by the issuing AIFI is legally enforceable.  \n \n2.6 The aggregate amount to be written -down / converted for all AT1 instruments on \nbreaching the trigger level must be at least the amount needed  to immediately return the \nAIFI\u2019s CET1 ratio to the trigger level or, if this is not possible, the full principal value of the \ninstruments. Further, the issuer should have full discretion to determine the amount of AT1 \ninstruments to be converted / written -down subject to the amount of conversion/write -down \nnot exceeding the amount which would be required to bring the CET1 ratio to 5.5% of \nRWAs.   \n \n2.7 The conversion / write -down may be allowed more than once in case a n AIFI hits the \npre-specified trigger l evel subsequent to the first conversion / write -down which was partial.  \n \n2.8 The conversion / write -down of AT1 instruments are primarily intended to replenish \nthe equity in the event it is depleted by losses. Therefore, AIFIs should not use conversion / \nwrite-down of AT1 instruments to support expansion of balance sheet by incurring further \nobligations / booking assets. Accordingly, a n AIFI whose Common Equity ratio slips below \n8% due to losses and is still above 6.125% i.e. , trigger point, should seek to expand its \nbalance sheet further only by raising fresh equity from its existing shareholders or market \n                                            \n170 Conversion means conversion to common shares.  \n171 When a paid -up instrument is fully and permanently written -down, it ceases to exist resulting in \nextinguishment of a liability of a n AIFI (a non -common equity instrument) and creates C ET1. A \ntemporary write -down is different from a conversion and a permanent write -down i.e. , the original \ninstrument may not be fully extinguished. Generally, the par value of the instrument is written -down \n(decrease) on the occurrence of the trigger event and which may be written -up (increase) back to its \noriginal value in future depending upon the conditions prescribed in the terms and conditions of the \ninstrument. The amount shown on the balance sheet subsequent to temporary write -down may \ndepend on the p recise features of the instrument and the prevailing accounting standards.  \n172 Auditors certificate would be required not only at the time of issuance of the instruments, but also \nwhenever there is a change in accounting norms / standards which may affect th e ability of the loss \nabsorbency mechanism of the instrument to create CET1)   \n207 and the internal accruals. However, fresh exposures can be taken to the extent of \namortization of the existing ones. If any expansion in exposures, such as due to draw down \nof sanctioned borrowing limits, is inevitable, this should be compensated within the shortest \npossible time by reducing other exposures173. The AIFI should maintain proper records to \nfacilitate verification of these transactions by its in ternal auditors, statutory auditors and \nInspecting Officers of the Reserve Bank .  \n \nIII. Treatment of AT1 Instruments in the event of Winding -Up, Amalgamation, \nAcquisition, Re -Constitution etc. of the AIFI \n2.9 If an AIFI goes into liquidation before the AT1 inst ruments have been written -down/ \nconverted, these instruments will absorb losses in accordance with the order of seniority \nindicated in the offer document and as per usual legal provisions governing priority of \ncharges.  \n \n2.10 If an AIFI goes into liquidati on after the AT1 instruments have been written -down, the \nholders of these instruments will have no claim on the proceeds of liquidation.  \n \n2.11 If an AIFI is amalgamated with any other institution before the AT1 instruments have \nbeen written -down/converted , these instruments will become part of the corresponding \ncategories of regulatory capital of the new institutions emerging after the merger.   \n \n2.12 If an AIFI is amalgamated with any other institution after the AT1 instruments have \nbeen written -down temp orarily, the amalgamated entity can write -up these instruments as \nper its discretion.  \n \n2.13 If an AIFI is amalgamated with any other institution after the non -equity regulatory \ncapital instruments have been written -down permanently, these cannot be written -up by the \namalgamated entity.  \n \n2.14 If the relevant authorities decide to reconstitute a n AIFI or amalgamate a n AIFI with \nany other institution , such a n AIFI will be deemed as non -viable or approaching non -viability \nand both the pre -specified trigger and the trigger at the point of non -viability174 for conversion \n/ write -down of AT1 instruments will be activated. Accordingly, the AT1 instruments will be \nfully converted / written -down permanently before amalgamation / reconstitution in \naccordance with these r ules.  \n \nIV. Fixation of Conversion Price, Capping of Number of Shares / Voting Rights  \n2.15 AIFIs may issue AT1 instruments with conversion features either based on price fixed \nat the time of issuance or based on the market price prevailing at the time of conver sion175. \n \n2.16 There will be possibility of the debt holders receiving a large number of shares in the \nevent the share price is very low at the time of conversion. Thus, debt holders will end up \nholding the number of shares and attached voting rights exceedi ng the legally permissible \nlimits. AIFIs should therefore, always keep sufficient headroom to accommodate the \nadditional equity due to conversion without breaching any of the statutory / regulatory \n                                            \n173  For the purpose of determination of breach of trigger, the fresh equity, if any, raised after slippage \nof CET1 below 8% will not be subtracted. In other words, if CET1 of the AIFI now is above the trigger \nlevel though it would have been below the trigger had it not raised the fresh equity which it did, the \ntrigger will not be treated as breached.  \n174 As described in subsequent paragraph 3 of this Annex.  \n175 Market price here does n ot mean the price prevailing on the date of conversion; AIFIs can use any \npricing formula such as weighted average price of shares during a particular period before \nconversion.   \n208 ceilings especially that for maximum private shareholdings  and maximum voting rights per \ninvestors / group of related investors. In order to achieve this, AIFIs should cap the number \nof shares and / or voting rights in accordance with relevant laws and regulations on \nOwnership and Governance of AIFIs. AIFIs shoul d adequately incorporate these features in \nthe terms and conditions of the instruments in the offer document. In exceptional \ncircumstances, if the breach is inevitable, the AIFI should immediately inform the Reserve \nBank  (Department of Regulation ) about it . The investors will be required to bring the \nshareholdings below the statutory / regulatory ceilings within the specific time frame as \ndetermined by the Reserve Bank . \n \n2.17 In the case of unlisted AIFIs, the conversion price should be determined based on \nthe fair value of the AIFI\u2019s common shares to be estimated according to a mutually \nacceptable methodology which should be in conformity with the standard market practice for \nvaluation of shares of unlisted companies.   \n \n2.18 In order to ensure the criteria  that the issuing AIFI must maintain at all times all prior \nauthorisation necessary to immediately issue the relevant number of shares specified in the \ninstrument's terms and conditions should the trigger event occur, the capital clause of each \nAIFI will h ave to be suitably modified to take care of conversion aspects.  \n \nV. Order of Conversion / Write -down of Various Types of AT1 Instruments  \n2.19 AIFIs should clearly indicate in the offer document, the order of conversion / write -\ndown of the instrument in quest ion vis -\u00e0-vis other capital instruments which the AIFI has \nalready issued or may issue in future, based on the advice of its legal counsels.  \n \n3. Minimum Requirements to Ensure Loss Absorbency of Non -equity Regulatory \nCapital Instruments at the Point of No n-Viability  \nI. Mode of Loss Absorption and Trigger Event  \n3.1 The terms and conditions of all non -common equity Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital \ninstruments issued by AIFIs in India must have a provision that requires such instruments, at \nthe option of the Reserve Bank , to either be written off or converted into common equity \nupon the occurrence of the trigger event, called the \u2018Point of Non -Viability (PONV) Trigger\u2019 \nstipulated below:   \n(i) The PONV Trigger event is the earlier of:  \na. a decision that a conversion176 or write -off177, without which the firm would \nbecome non -viable, is necessary, as determined by the Reserve Bank ; and  \n \nb. the decision to make a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, \nwithout which the firm would have become non -viable, as determined by the \nrelevant authority.  \n \nThe Write -off of any Common Equity Tier 1 capital shall not be required before the write -off \nof any Non -equity (Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2) regulatory capital instrument.  \n \n(ii) Such a decision would invariably imply that the  write -off or issuance of any new \nshares as a result of conversion consequent upon the trigger event must occur prior to any \npublic sector injection of capital so that the capital provided by the public sector is not \ndiluted. As such, the contractual terms  and conditions of an instrument must not provide for \nany residual claims on the issuer which are senior to ordinary shares of the AIFI (or group \n                                            \n176 Conversion means full conversion to common shares.  \n177 Write -off means fully an d permanently write -off.  \n209 entity where applicable), following a trigger event and when conversion or write -off is \nundertaken.  \n \n(iii) Any compensation paid to the instrument holders as a result of the write -off178 must \nbe paid immediately in the form of common shares.  \n \n(iv) The issuing AIFI must maintain at all times all prior authorisation necessary to \nimmediately issue the relevant number of shares specified in the instrument\u2019s terms and \nconditions should the trigger event occur.  \n \n (v) In order to ensure that these requirements are met, AIFIs shall obtain and keep on \ntheir records an external legal opinion confirming that the conversion or  write -off feature of \nnon-equity capital instruments (Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2) by the Reserve Bank  at the point \nof non -viability is legally enforceable. Further, the legal opinion should also confirm that there \nare no legal impediments to the conversio n of the instrument into ordinary shares of the AIFI \n(or a group entity, where applicable) or write -off upon a trigger event. The Reserve Bank  \nmay also require the AIFI to submit additional information in order to ensure that such \ninstruments are eligible for inclusion into regulatory capital.  \n \nII. A Non -viable AIFI \n3.2 For the purpose of these guidelines, a non -viable AIFI will be:  \nAn AIFI which, owing to its financial and other difficulties, may no longer remain a going \nconcern on its own in the opinion of the Re serve Bank unless appropriate measures are \ntaken to revive its operations and thus, enable it to continue as a going concern. The \ndifficulties faced by a n AIFI should be such that these are likely to result in financial losses \nand raising the Common Equity  Tier 1 capital of the AIFI should be considered as the most \nappropriate way to prevent the AIFI from turning non -viable. Such measures would include \nwrite -off / conversion of non -equity regulatory capital into common shares in combination \nwith or without other measures as considered appropriate by the Reserve Bank179.  \nIII. Restoring Viability  \n3.3 An AIFI facing financial difficulties and approaching a PONV will be deemed to \nachieve viability if within a reasonable time in the opinion of the Reserve Bank, it will be able \nto come out of the present difficulties if appropriate measures are taken to revive it. The \nmeasures including augmentation of equity capital through write -off/conversion/public sector \ninjection of funds are likely to:  \na. Restore depositors\u2019/investors\u2019 confidence;  \nb. Improve rating /creditworthiness of the AIFI and thereby improve its borrowing \ncapacity and liquidity and reduce cost of funds; and  \nc. Augment the resource base to fund balance sheet growth in the case of fresh \ninjection of funds.  \n                                            \n178 Compensation in the form of common shares may be viewed as the simultaneous occurrence of \n(a) permanent write -off of the original instrument; and (b) creation of new common shares issued in \nlieu of non -equity capital instrument w hich is written -off, as compensation for its extinguishment. The \nprecise mechanism may vary under the accounting standards. No compensation (i.e. , zero common \nshares) is paid in case of full and permanent write -off. \n179 In rare situations, a n AIFI may also b ecome non -viable due to non -financial problems, such as \nconduct of affairs of the AIFI in a manner which is detrimental to the interest of depositors, serious \ncorporate governance issues, etc. In such situations raising capital is not considered a part of the \nsolution and  therefore, may not attract provisions of this framework.  \n  \n210  \nIV. Other Requirem ents to be met by the Non -common Equity                                                 \nCapital Instruments so as to Absorb Losses at the PONV  \n3.4 Instruments may be issued with either of the following feature s: \na. conversion; or  \n \nb. permanent write -off    \n3.5 The amou nt of non -equity capital to be converted / written -off will be determined by \nthe Reserve Bank .  \n \n3.6 The provisions regarding treatment of AT1 instruments in the event of                       \nwinding -up, amalgamation, acquisition, re -constitution etc. of th e AIFI as given in paragraphs \n2.10 to 2.15 will also be applicable to all non -common equity capital instruments (AT1 and \nTier 2 capital instruments) when these events take place after conversion/write -off at the \nPONV.  \n \n3.7 The provisions regarding fixation of conversion price, capping of                                                                             \nnumber of shares/voting rights applicable to AT1 instruments in terms of paragraphs 2.16 to \n2.19 above will also be applicable for conversion of all no n-common equity capital \ninstruments (AT1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) at the PONV.  \n \n3.8  The provisions regarding order of conversion/write -down of AT1 instruments as \ngiven in paragraph 2.20 above will also be applicable for conversion/ write -off of all non -\ncommon equity capital instruments (AT1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) at the PONV.  \n \nV. Criteria to Determine the PONV  \n3.9 The above framework will be invoked when a n AIFI is adjudged by the Reserve Bank  \nto be approaching the point of non -viability, or has alrea dy reached the point of non -viability, \nbut in the views of the Reserve Bank :  \na) there is a possibility that a timely intervention in form of capital support, with or \nwithout other supporting interventions, is likely to rescue the AIFI; and   \nb) if left unattend ed, the weaknesses would inflict financial losses on the AIFI \nand, thus, cause decline in its common equity level.  \n \n3.10 The purpose of write -off and / or conversion of non -equity regulatory capital elements \nwill be to shore up the capital level of the AIFI. The Reserve Bank  would follow a two -stage \napproach to determine the non -viability of a n AIFI. The Stage 1  assessment would consist of \npurely objective and quantifiable criteria to indicate that there is a prima facie  case of a n AIFI \napproaching non -viability  and, therefore, a closer examination of the AIFI\u2019s financial situation \nis warranted. The Stage 2  assessment would consist of supplementary subjective criteria \nwhich, in conjunction with the Stage 1 information, would help in determining whether the \nAIFI is about to become non -viable. These criteria would be evaluated together and not in \nisolation.  \n \n3.11 Once the PONV is confirmed, the next step would be to decide whether rescue of the \nAIFI would be through write -off/conversion alone or write -off/conversion in conjunction with a \npublic sector injection of funds.  \n \n3.12  The trigger at PONV will be evaluated both at consolidated and solo level and \nbreach at either level will trigger conversion / write -off. \n \n  \n211 3.13  As the capital adequacy  is applicable both at solo and consol idated levels, the \nminority interests  in respect of capital instruments issued by subsidiaries of AIFIs including \noverseas subsidiaries , if any,  can be included in the consolidated capital of the group only if \nthese instruments have pre -specified triggers (in case of AT1 capital instruments) / loss \nabsorbency at the PONV180 (for all non -common equity capital instruments). In addition, \nwhere a n AIFI wishes the instrument issued by its subsidiary to be included in the \nconsolidated group\u2019s capital in addition to  its solo capital, the terms and conditions of that \ninstrument must specify an additional trigger event.  \nThis additional trigger event is the earlier of:  \n(1) a decision that a conversion or write -off, without which the AIFI or the subsidiary \nwould become non-viable, is necessary, as determined by the Reserve Bank ; and  \n(2) the decision to make a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, \nwithout which the AIFI or the subsidiary would have become non -viable, as \ndetermined by the Reserve Bank . Such a decision would invariably imply that the \nwrite -off or issuance of any new shares as a result of conversion consequent upon \nthe trigger event must occur prior to any public sector injection of capital so that the \ncapital provided by the public secto r is not diluted.   \n \n3.14 In such  cases, the subsidiary should obtain its regulator\u2019s approval/no -objection for \nallowing the capital instrument to be converted/written -off at the additional trigger point \nreferred to in paragraph 3.1 3 above.  \n \n3.15 Any common shares p aid as compensation to the holders of the instrument must be \ncommon shares of either the issuing subsidiary or the parent AIFI (including any successor \nin resolution).  \n \n                                            \n180  The cost to the parent of its investment in each subsidiary and the parent\u2019s portion of equity of \neach subsidiary, at the date on which investment in each subsidiary is made, is eliminated as per AS -\n21. S o, in case of wholly -owned subsidiaries, it would not matter whether or not it has same \ncharacteristics as the AIFI\u2019s capital. However, in the case of less than wholly owned subsidiaries  (or in \nthe case of non -equity regulatory ca pital of the wholly owned subsidiaries , if issued to the third \nparties ), minority interests constitute additional capital for the banking group over and above what is \ncounted at solo level; therefore, it should be admitted only when it (and consequently th e entire capital \nin that category) has the same characteristics as the AIFI\u2019s capital.    \n212 Annex 15  \n(section 7 .3.5) \n \nCalculation of Minority Interest - Illustrative Example  \nThis Annex illustrates the treatment of minority interest and other capital issued out of \nsubsidiaries to third parties, which is set out in section 7 .3 of this Chapter . \n  \nA group for this purpose consists of two legal entities that are both banks. Bank P is the \nparent and Bank S is the subsidiary and their unconsolidated balance sheets are set out \nbelow:  \n \nBank P Balance Sheet  Bank S Balance Sheet  \nAssets    Assets    \nLoans to customers  100 Loans to customers  150 \nInvestment in CET1 of Bank S  7   \nInvest ment in the AT1 of Bank S  4   \nInvestment in the T2 of Bank S  2   \nTotal  113 Total  150 \nLiabilities and equity   Liabilities and equity   \nDepositors  70 Depositors  127 \nTier 2  10 Tier 2  8 \nAdditional Tier 1  7 Additional Tier 1  5 \nCommon equity  26 Common equity  10 \nTotal  113 Total  150 \n \nThe balance sheet of Bank P shows that in addition to its loans to customers, it owns 70% of \nthe common shares of Bank S, 80% of the Additional Tier 1 of Bank S and 25% of the Tier 2 \ncapital of Bank S.  \n \nThe owner ship of the capital of Bank S is therefore as follows:  \n \nCapital issued by Bank S  \n Amount issued to \nparent  \n(Bank P)  Amount \nissued to \nthird parties  Total  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 \n(CET1)  7  3  10  \nAdditional Tier 1 (AT1)  4  1  5  \nTier 1 (T1)  11  4  15  \nTier 2 (T2)  2  6  8  \nTotal capital (TC)  13  10  23  \n  \n213  \n \nConsolidated Balance Sheet  \nAssets    Remarks  \nLoans to customers  250 Investments of P in S aggregating \nRs.13 will be cancelled during \naccounting consolidation.  \nLiabilities and equity     \nDepositors  197  \nTier 2 issued by subsidiary to third \nparties  6 (8-2) \nTier 2 issued by parent  10  \nAdditional Tier 1 issued by subsidiary \nto third parties  1 (5-4) \nAdditional Tier 1 issued by parent  7  \nCommon equity issued by subsidiary \nto third parti es (i.e. , minority interest)  3 (10-7) \nCommon equity issued by parent  26  \nTotal  250  \n \nFor illustrative purposes Bank S is assumed to have risk weighted assets of 100 against the \nactual value of assets of 150. In this example, the minimum capital requi rements of Bank S \nand the subsidiary\u2019s contribution to the consolidated requirements are the same. This means \nthat it is subject to the following minimum plus capital conservation buffer requirements and \nhas the following surplus capital:  \n \nMinimum and surp lus capital of Bank S  \n Minimum plus capital \nconservation buffer \nrequired181 Actual \ncapital \navailable  Surplus  \n(3-2) \n1 2 3 4 \nCommon Equity \nTier 1capital  7.0  \n(= 7.0% of 100)  10 3.0  \n \nTier 1 capital  8.5  \n(= 8.5% of 100)  15 \n(10+5)  6.5  \n \nTotal capital  10.5  \n(= 10.5% of 100)  23 \n(10+5+8)  12.5  \n \n \nThe following table illustrates how to calculate the amount of capital issued by Bank S to \ninclude in consolidated capital, following the calculation procedure set out in section 7 .3.4 of \nthis Chapter :  \n                                            \n181 Illustration is based on Basel III minima as indicated in the BCBS document \u2018Basel III: A global \nregulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems  issued in  December 2010 (rev \nJune 2011)\u2019  The Common Equity Tier 1 in the example should be read to include issued common \nshares plus retained earnings and reserves in Bank S.  \n  \n214  \nBank S: A mount of capital issued to third parties included in consolidated capital  \n Total \namount \nissued \n(a)  Amount \nissued \nto third \nparties  \n(b)  Surplus  \n(c)  Surplus attributable to \nthird parties (i.e. , \namount excluded from \nconsolidated capital)  \n(d) =  (c) * (b )/(a)  Amount \nincluded in \nconsolidated \ncapital  \n(e) = (b) \u2013 (d)  \nCommon \nEquity \nTier 1 \ncapital  10  3  3.0  0.90  2.10  \nTier 1 \ncapital  15  4  6.5  1.73  2.27  \nTotal \ncapital  23  10  12.5  5.43  4.57  \n \nThe following table summarises the components of capita l for the consolidated group based \non the amounts calculated in the table above.

Risk exposure and assessment  \nThe risks to which AIFIs are exposed and the techniques that AIFIs use to identify, measure, \nmonitor and control those risks are important factors market participants consider in their \nassessment of an institution. In this section, several key risks are considered: credit risk, \nmarket risk, and inter est rate risk in the banking book and operational risk. Also included in \nthis section are disclosures relating to credit risk mitigation and asset securitisation, both of \nwhich alter the risk profile of the institution. Where applicable, separate disclosur es are set \nout for AIFIs using different approaches to the assessment of regulatory capital.  \n \n2.1   General qualitative disclosure requirement  \nFor each separate risk area (e.g. , credit, market, operational, banking book interest rate risk) \nAIFIs must descr ibe their risk management objectives and policies, including:  \n(i) strategies and processes;  \n(ii) the structure and organisation of the relevant risk management function;  \n(iii) the scope and nature of risk reporting and/or measurement systems;  \n(iv) policies for hedging and/or  mitigating risk and strategies and processes for \nmonitoring the continuing effectiveness of hedges/mitigants.  \n \nCredit risk  \nGeneral disclosures of credit risk provide market participants with a range of information \nabout overall credit exposure and need no t necessarily be based on information prepared for \nregulatory purposes. Disclosures on the capital assessment techniques give information on \nthe specific nature of the exposures, the means of capital assessment and data to assess \nthe reliability of the inf ormation disclosed.  \nTable DF -3:  Credit Risk: General Disclosures for All AIFIs \nQualitative Disclosures  \n(a) The general qualitative disclosure requirement with respect to credit risk, including:  \n\uf0b7 Definitions of past due and impaired (for accounting purposes ); \n\uf0b7 Discussion of the AIFI\u2019s credit risk management policy;  \nQuantitative Disclosures   \n(b) Total gross credit risk exposures185, Fund based and Non -fund based separately.  \n(c) Geographic distribution of exposures186, Fund based and Non -fund based separately  \n\uf0b7 Overseas  \n\uf0b7 Domestic  \n(d) Industry187  type distribution of exposures, fund based and non -fund based separately  \n                                            \n185 That is after accounting offsets in accordance with the applicable accounting regime and without \ntaking into account the effects of credit risk mitigation techniques, e.g. , collateral and netting.  \n186 That is, on the same basis as adopted for Segment Reporting adopted for compliance with AS 17.  \n187 The industries break -up may be provided on the same lines as prescribed for DSB returns  of \nbanks .

Leverage Ratio Disclosures  \n(i) The scope of consolidation of the Basel III leverage ratio as set out i n section  18.2.2 \nmay be different from the scope of consolidation of the published financial statements. Also, \nthere may be differences between the measurement criteria of assets on the accounting \nbalance sheet in the published financial statements relativ e to measurement criteria of the \nleverage ratio (e.g. , due to differences of eligible hedges, netting or the recognition of credit \nrisk mitigation). Further, in order to adequately capture embedded leverage, the framework \nincorporates both on - and off -balance sheet exposures.  \n \n(ii) The templates set out below are designed to be flexible enough to be used under \nany accounting standard, and are consistent yet proportionate, varying with the complexity \nof the balance sheet of the reporting AIFI205. \n \n4.1 Summary comparison table  \n4.1.1  Applying values at the end of period (e.g. , quarter -end), AIFIs must report a \nreconciliation of their balance sheet assets from their published financial statements with \nthe leverage ratio exposure measure as shown in Table DF-17 below. Specifically:  \n\uf0b7 line 1 should show the AIFI\u2019s total consolidated assets as per published financial \nstatements;  \n\uf0b7 line 2 should show adjustments related to investments in banking, financial, \ninsurance or commercial entities that are consolidated for accoun ting purposes, but outside \nthe scope of regulatory consolidation as set out in section s 18.2.2  and 18.4.2.2 ; \n\uf0b7 line 3 should show adjustments related to any fiduciary assets recognised on the \nbalance sheet pursuant to the AIFI\u2019s operative accounting framewor k but excluded from the \nleverage ratio exposure measure, as described in footnote 112 of this Chapter ; \n                                            \n203 Unrealised gains (losses) recognised in the balance sheet but not through the profit and loss \naccount.  \n204 Unrealised gains (losses) not recognised either in the balance sheet or throu gh the profit and loss \naccount.  \n205 Specifically,  a common  template  is set out. However,  with respect  to reconciliation,  AIFIs are to \nqualitatively  reconcile  any material  difference  between  total balance  sheet  assets  in their reported  \nfinancial  statements  and on-balance  sheet  exposures  as prescribed  in the leverage ratio.   \n241 \uf0b7 lines 4 and 5 should show adjustments related to derivative financial instruments \nand securities financing transactions (i.e. , repos and other similar se cured lending), \nrespectively;  \n\uf0b7 line 6 should show the credit equivalent amount of OBS items, as determined under \nsection  18.4.5.2;  \n\uf0b7 line 7 should show any other adjustments; and  \n\uf0b7 line 8 should show the leverage ratio exposure, which should be the sum of the \nprevious items. This should also be consistent with line 22 of Table DF-18 below .  \nTable DF -17- Summary comparison of accounting assets vs. leverage ratio \nexposure measure  \n \n4.2  Common disclosure template and explanatory table, reconciliation and other \nrequirements  \n4.2.1 AIFIs must report, in accordance with Table  DF-18 below, and applying values at \nthe end of period (e.g. , quarter -end), a breakdown of the following exposures under the \nleverage ratio framework: (i) on -balance sheet exposures; (ii) deriva tive exposures; (iii) SFT \nexposures; and (iv) OBS items.

This will prevent a \ndivergence of tables and templates that could undermine the objectives  of consistency and \ncomparability.    \n245 Annex 17  \n(section  8.16.3. 7) \nRequirements for Recognition of Net Replacement Cost  \nin Close -out Netting Sets  \nA. For repo -style transactions  \nThe effects of bilateral netting agreements covering repo -style transactions will b e \nrecognised on a counterparty -by-counterparty basis if the agreements are legally enforceable \nin each relevant jurisdiction upon the occurrence of an event of default and regardless of \nwhether the counterparty is insolvent or bankrupt. In addition, nettin g agreements must:  \na) provide the non -defaulting party the right to terminate and close -out in a timely \nmanner all transactions under the agreement upon an event of default, including in the event \nof insolvency or bankruptcy of the counterparty;  \nb) provide for  the netting of gains and losses on transactions (including the value of any \ncollateral) terminated and closed out under it so that a single net amount is owed by one \nparty to the other;  \nc) allow for the prompt liquidation or setoff of collateral upon the ev ent of default; and  \nd) be, together with the rights arising from the provisions required in (a) to (c) above, \nlegally enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction upon the occurrence of an event of default \nand regardless of the counterparty's insolvency or bankr uptcy.  \n \ne) Netting across positions in the banking and trading book will only be recognised when \nthe netted transactions fulfil the following conditions:  \n(i) All transactions are marked to market daily206; and  \n(ii) The collateral instruments used in the transactions are  recognised as eligible \nfinancial collateral in the banking book.  \n \nB. For Derivatives transactions  \n(a) AIFIs may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligation between \nan AIFI and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically \namalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and  value date, legally \nsubstituting one single amount for the previous gross obligations.  \n(b) AIFIs may also net transactions subject to any legally valid form of bilater al netting not \ncovered in (a), including other forms of novation.  \n(c) In both cases (a) and (b), a n AIFI will need to satisfy that it has:  \n(i) A netting contract or agreement with the counterparty which creates a single legal \nobligation, covering all inc luded transactions, such that the AIFI would have either a \nclaim to receive or obligation to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative \nmark -to-market values of included individual transactions in the event a counterparty \nfails to perform due to any  of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar \ncircumstances;   \n(ii) Written and reasoned legal opinions that, in the event of a legal challenge, the \nrelevant courts and administrative authorities would find the AIFI's exposure to be \nsuch a net amount under:   \n\uf0b7 The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if the \nforeign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction \nin which the branch is located;  \n                                            \n206 The holding period for the haircuts will depend as in other repo -style transactions on the frequency \nof margining.   \n246 \uf0b7 The law that governs the individu al transactions; and  \n\uf0b7 The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the netting.  \n(iii) Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting \narrangements are kept under review in the light of possible changes in relev ant law.  \n(d) Contracts containing walkaway clauses will not be eligible for netting for the purpose \nof calculating capital requirements under these guidelines. A walkaway clause is a provision \nwhich permits a non -defaulting counterparty to make only limite d payments or no payment at \nall, to the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter is a net creditor.   \n247  \nChapter III \u2013 Exposure Norms  \nPart A \u2013 Large Exposure s Framework  \n \nExposure limits is one of the tools  deployed by regulators and financial  entities  to manage \nconcentration risk. The instructions contained in th is Chapter  cover the prudential norms on \ncredit as well as capital market exposures of the AIFIs.  \n \n19. Scope and Applicability  \n19.1 AIFIs shall apply the exposure norms  on an ongoing basis and  in the same m anner  \nas applied for  the risk -based capital requirements, i.e. (a) consolidated (Group207) level and \n(b) solo level.  These norms deal with only t he counterparty  exposures but not with the sector \n/ industry exposures.  \n \n19.2 Exemptions  \n19.2.1  An AIFI\u2019s exposure to all its  counterparties shall be subject to the exposure limits \nexcept for those listed below:  \n(i) The refinance portfolios of AIFIs.  \nProvided that  the AIFIs shall frame a policy approved by its Board to determine credit \nexposure limits in respect of their refinancing  portfolio . The policy framed and assessments \nmade under such a policy shall be subject to supervisory scrutiny.  \n(ii) Exposures to the Government  of India and State Governments which are eligible for \nzero per cent risk weight under Chapter II of these Directio ns \n(iii) Exposures to the Reserve Bank  \n(iv) Exposures where principal and interest are fully guaranteed by the Government of \nIndia  \n(v) Exposures secured by financial instruments issued by the Government of India, to the \nextent that the eligibility criteria for recognitio n of the credit risk mitigation (CRM) are met in \nterms of section 22 of this Chapter  \n(vi) Intra-day e xposures to banks  \n(vii) AIFIs\u2019 clearing activities related exposures to QCCPs as detailed in section 24 of \nthese Directions  \n \n19.2.2  Where two (or more) entities falling outs ide the scope of the sovereign exemption are \ncontrolled by or are economically dependent on an entity that falls within the scope of the \nsovereign exemption { section  19.2.1 (ii) and (iii)}, and are otherwise not connected, those \nentities will not be deemed  to constitute a group of connected counterparties.  \n \n20. Exposure Ceilings  \n20.1 Single Counterparty : The sum of all the exposure values of an AIFI to a single \ncounterparty must not be higher than 20 per  cent of the AIFI\u2019s available eligible capital base \nat all tim es. \nProvided that  Board of the AIFI may allow additional 5 per  cent exposure beyond 20 per  \ncent but at no time higher than 25  per cent  of the AIFI\u2019s eligible capital base, subject to the \nfollowing conditions:  \n                                            \n207 This requires that AIFIs shall apply LE framework at the consolidated group level, after \nconsolidating the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries / joint ventures / associates (including \noverseas operations through AIFI\u2019s branches) etc., except those engaged in insurance and any non -\nfinancial activities .  \n248 (i) AIFIs shall put in  place a specific Board appro ved policy  setting out conditions \nunder which exposure beyond 20  per cent  may be considered; and  \n(ii) AIFI shall record in writing the exceptional reasons for which exposure beyond \n20 per cent  is being allowed for each  specific case.  \nProvided further that an A IFI may exceed the exposure limit by 5 per  cent of its Tier I \ncapital for exposure to a single counterparty, if the additional exposure is on account of \ninfrastructure \u2018loan and/ or investment\u2019.  \nProvided further that  single counterparty limit shall not exc eed 25  per cent  in any case for  \nthe AIFI.  \n \n20.2 Group of Connected Counterparties : The sum of all exposure values  of an AIFI  to \na group of connected counterparties  shall not be higher than  25 per cent of  the AIFI\u2019s \navailable  eligible capital base  at all times . \nProvided that  an AIFI may exceed the exposure limit by 10 per  cent of its Tier I capital for \nexposure to a group of connected counterparties, if the additional exposure is on account of \ninfrastructure \u2018loan and/ or investment\u2019.  \n \n20.3 The eligible capital base f or the purpose s under this Chapter  is the effective amount \nof Tier 1 capital fulfilling the criteria defined under  Chapter II of these Directions  as per the \nlast audited balance sheet.  \n \n20.4 The infusion of capital after the published balance sheet date may als o be taken into \naccount for the purpose of exposure norms . Further, profits accrued during the year will be \nreckoned as Tier I capital for the purpose after making necessary adjustments as prescribed \nunder Chapter II of these Directions.  \nProvided that  AIFIs shall obtain an external auditor\u2019s certificate on completion of the infus ion \nof capital and submit the same to the Reserve Bank  (Department of Supervision) before \nreckoning the additions to eligible capital base . \n \n21. Definition  of connected counterparties  \n21.1 In some  cases, a n AIFI  may have exposures to a group of counterparties with specific \nrelationships or dependencies such that, were one of the counterparties to fail, all of the \ncounterparties would very likely fail.  Such a  group of connected counterparties  shall be \ntreated as a single counterparty.  The sum of the AIFI\u2019s exposure to all the individual entities \nincluded within a group of connected counterparties shall be  subject to the exposure limit s, \nas mentioned at section 2 0.1 above, and to the regulatory  reporting requirements . \n \n21.2 Two or more natural or legal persons shall be deemed to be a group of connected \ncounterparties if at least one of the following criteria is satisfied:  \n(i) Control relationship:  one of the counterparties, directly or indirectly, has c ontrol over \nthe other(s) or the counterparties are, directly or indirectly, controlled by a third party ( AIFI \nmay or may not have exposure towards this third party). In case of financial problems of the \ncontrolling entity, it is highly likely that the cont rolling entity could make use of its ability to \nextract capital and/or liquidity from the controlled entity, thereby weakening the financial \nposition of the latter. Financial problems could be transferred to the controlled entity, with the \nresult that both  the controlling entity and the controlled entity would experience financial \nproblems (domino effect). From  the prudential perspective, these types of clients (connected \nby control)  form a single risk.  \n(ii) Economic interdependence:  if one of the counterpartie s were to experience financial \nproblems, in particular funding or repayment difficulties, the other(s), as a result, would also \nbe likely to encounter funding or repayment difficulties.  \nProvided that  in order to avoid cases where a thorough investigation o f economic \ninterdependencies will not be proportionate to the size of the exposures, AIFIs shall identify \npossible connected counterparties on the basis of economic interdependence in all cases  \n249 where the sum of all exposures to one individual counterparty exceeds 5  per cent  of the \neligible capital base , and not in other cases.  \n21.3 In order to establish the existence of a group of connected counterparties , AIFIs shall \nassess the relationship amongst counterparties with reference to ( i) and ( ii) above.  \nProvided t hat if one entity owns more than 50 percent of the voting rights of the other entity , \nAIFIs shall automatically consider that the control relationship criterion ( section  21.2(i) above) \nis satisfied.  \nProvided further that  AIFIs shall  assess connectedness be tween counterparties based on \n\u201ccontrol \u201d using the following evidences:  \n(i) Voting agreements (e.g., control of a majority of voting rights pursuant to an \nagreement with other shareholders);  \n(ii) Significant influence on the appointment or dismissal of an entity\u2019s  administrative, \nmanagement or supervisory body, such as the right to appoint or remove a majority of \nmembers in those bodies, or the fact that a majority of members have been appointed solely \nas a result of the exercise of an individual entity\u2019s voting ri ghts;  \n(iii) Significant influence on senior management, e.g., an entity has the power, pursuant \nto a contract or otherwise, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or \npolicies of another entity (e.g., through consent rights over key decisions, t o decide on the \nstrategy or direct the activities of an entity, to decide on crucial transactions such as transfer \nof profit or loss);  \n(iv) AIFIs shall also assess t he above criteria with respect to a common third party (such \nas holding company), irrespective of whether the AIFI has exposure to that entity or not . \n21.4 AIFIs shall also  refer to criteria specified in the extant accounting standards for further \nqualitative guidance when determining control.  \n21.5 While determining control relationship, AIFIs shall also exa mine cases where clients \nhave common owners, shareholders or managers; for example, horizontal groups where an \nundertaking is related to one or more other undertakings because they all have the same \nshareholder structure without a single controlling shareh older or because they are managed \non a unified basis. This management may be pursuant to a contract concluded between the \nundertakings, or to provisions in the memoranda or articles of association of those \nundertakings, or if the administrative management or supervisory bodies of the undertaking \nand of one or more other undertakings consist, for the major part, of the same persons.  \n21.6 Where control has been established based on any of the above criteria,  in \nexceptional cases,  AIFIs shall have an option to  demonstrate to the Reserve Bank  (e.g., \nexistence of control between counterparties due to specific circumstances and corporate \ngovernance safeguards) that such control does not necessarily result in the entities \nconcerned constituting a group of connected cou nterparties. For example, in specific cases \nwhere a special purpose entity (SPE) that is controlled by another client (e.g. , an originator) \nis fully ring -fenced and bankruptcy remote (i .e., arrangements exist to the effect that assets \nof SPE are not availa ble to lenders of parent undertaking in the event of insolvency of the \nparent undertaking) \u2013 so that there is no possible channel of contagion. Hence no single risk \nexists between the special purpose entity and the controlling parent entity.  \n21.7 In establishi ng connectedness based on economic interdependence, AIFIs shall \nconsider, at a minimum, the following criteria:  \n(i) Where 50  per cent  or more of one counterparty's gross receipts or gross expenditures \n(on an annual basis) is derived from transactions with the  other counterparty;  \n(ii) Where one counterparty has fully or partly guaranteed the exposure of the other \ncounterparty, or is liable by other means, and the exposure is so significant that the \nguarantor is likely to default if a claim occurs;   \n250 (iii) Where a significa nt part of one counterparty\u2019s production/output is sold to another \ncounterparty, which cannot easily be replaced by other customers;  \n(iv) When the expected source of funds to repay the loans of both counterparties is the \nsame and neither counterparty has anoth er independent source of income from which the \nloan may be serviced and fully repaid;  \n(v) Where it is likely that the financial problems of one counterparty would cause \ndifficulties for the other counterparties in terms of full and timely repayment of liabili ties;  \n(vi) Where the insolvency or default of one counterparty is likely to be associated with the \ninsolvency or default of the other(s);  \n(vii) When two or more counterparties rely on the same source for the majority of their \nfunding and, in the event of the common  provider\u2019s default, an alternative provider cannot be \nfound - in this case, the funding problems of one counterparty are likely to spread to another \ndue to a one -way or two -way dependence on the same main funding source.  \nIllustrations are provided  in Annex 18.  \n21.8 However , it is possible that there shall be circumstances where some of these criteria \ndo not automatically imply an economic dependence that results in two or more \ncounterparties being connected.  In such a scenario, th e AIFI shall not be required  to combine \nthese counterparties to form a group of connected counterparties.  \nProvided that  the AIFI can demonstrate that a counterparty which is economically closely \nrelated to another counterparty shall be able to  overcome fin ancial difficulties, or even the \nsecond counterparty\u2019s default, by finding alternative business partners or funding sources \nwithin an appropriate time period . \n21.9 Relation between interconnectedness through control and interconnectedness \nthrough economic depen dency:  Group of counterparties based on control and economic \ninterdependence are to be assessed separately. However, there may be situations where the \ntwo types of dependencies are interlinked and could therefore exist within one group of \nconnected counter parties in such a way that all relevant clients constitute a single risk. Risk \nof contagion is present irrespective of type of connectedness (i.e. , control or economic \ninterdependence) between counterparties. The chain of contagion leading to possible defa ult \nof all entities concerned is the relevant factor for the grouping and needs to be assessed in \neach individual case. Illustrations are  given in  Annex 19 . \n21.10  AIFIs  shall frame Board approved policies for determining connectednes s among \ncounterparties  using the criteria mentioned above. The policies are subject to supervisory \nscrutiny.  \n22. Values  of Exposure  \n22.1 An exposure to a counterparty shall constitute both on and off -balance sheet \nexposures which shall be calculated according to th e method prescribed for capital \ncomputation under Chapter II of th ese Direction s. The exposures shall be permitted to be \noffset with credit risk mitigation techniques permitted as at section 10 in Chapter II of these \nDirections. Off -balance sheet items sha ll be converted into credit exposure equivalents \nthrough the use of credit conversion factors (CCFs) by applying the CCFs set out in section \n8.16 in Chapter II of these Directions, with a floor of 10 percent.  \n22.2 Recognition of exposures to CRM providers  \n(i) Where  an AIFI  reduces its exposure to the original counterparty on account of an \neligible CRM instrument provided by another counterparty (CRM provider) with respect to \nthat exposure, it must also recognise an exposure to the CRM provider. The amount \nassigned t o the CRM provider will be the amount by which the exposure to the original \ncounterparty is reduced (except in the cases defined in clause (ii)  below).  \n  \n251 (ii) When the credit protection takes the form of a credit default swap (CDS) and either \nthe CDS provider or  the referenced entity is not a financial entity, the amount to be assigned \nto the credit protection provider is not the amount by which the exposure to the original \ncounterparty is reduced but will be equal to the counterparty credit risk exposure value \ncalculated as per the  the extant method prescribed for the counterparty credit risk in Chapter \nII of these Directions.  \nNote:  For the purpose of this paragraph, financial entities comprise:  \n(a) Regulated financial institutions, defined as a parent and its subsid iaries where \nany substantial legal entity in the consolidated group is supervised by a regulator that \nimposes prudential requirements consistent with international norms. These include, \nbut are not limited to, prudentially regulated insurance companies, br oker/dealers, \nbanks; and  \n(b) Unregulated financial institutions, defined as legal entities whose main \nbusiness includes: the management of financial assets, lending, factoring, leasing, \nprovision of credit enhancements, securitisation, investments, financial c ustody, \ncentral counterparty services, proprietary trading and other financial services activities \nidentified by supervisors.  \n22.3 Exposures to banks  \nThe exposures to banks  (excluding  refinance exposure) , except intra -day exposures, shall be \nsubject to the larg e exposure limit of 25  per cent  of an AIFI\u2019s  Tier 1 capital.  \n22.4 Collective Investment Undertakings (CIUs), securitisation vehicles and other \nstructures - adoption of \u201cLook Through Approach\u201d (LTA)  \n22.4.1  There are cases when a structure lies between the AIFI and its exposures, that is, the \nAIFI invests in structures which themselves have exposures to assets underlying the \nstructures (hereafter referred to as the \u201cunderlying assets\u201d). Such structures include funds208, \nsecuritisations and other structures209 with underlying  assets. AIFIs shall assign such \nexposure amount to specific counterparties of the underlying assets following the LTA \ndescribed below. Illustrative examp le is provided in Annex 20. \n22.4.2  An AIFI  shall be permitted to  assign the expo sure amount to the structure itself, \ndefined as a distinct counterparty   \nProvided that  it can demonstrate that the AIFI\u2019s exposure amount to each underlying asset \nof the structure is smaller than 0.25% of its eligible capital base , considering only those \nexposure to underlying assets that result from the investment in the structure itself and using \nthe exposure value calculated according to section  22.4.7 and 2 2.4.8. In this case, a n AIFI is \nnot required to look through the structure to identify the underly ing assets.  \n22.4.3  An AIFI shall look through the structure  and in the case of  underlying assets for which \nthe underlying exposure value is equal to or above 0.25% of its eligible capital base , the \ncounterparty corresponding to each of the underlying assets shall be identified so that these \nunderlying exposures can be added to any other direct or indirect exposure to the same \ncounterparty.  The AIFI\u2019s exposure amount to the underlying assets that are below 0.25  per \ncent of the AIFI\u2019s eligible capital base shall be assigned to the structure itself (ie., partial look -\nthrough is permitted).  \n \n \n \n                                            \n208 such as mutual funds, alternative investment fu nds \n209 such as investment in security receipts, real estate investment trusts, infrastructure investment \ntrusts   \n252 22.4.4  If an AIFI is unable to identify the underlying assets of a structure:  \n(i) where the total amount of a n AIFI\u2019s exposures to a structure does not exceed 0.25 \nper cent of its eligible c apital base , it shall assign the total exposure amount to the structure \nitself, as a distinct counterparty.  \n(ii) Otherwise (i.e. , if the exposure to the structure equals or exceeds 0.25 per cent of its \neligible capital base ), it shall assign this total exposure  amount to the \u2018unknown client\u2019.  \nProvided that  the exposure limit s shall apply on the aggregate of all such exposures to \n\u2018unknown clients\u2019 as if they are a single counterparty.  \n22.4.5  Where the LTA is not required ( section  22.4.2 above), a n AIFI shall demonstrate  that \nregulatory arbitrage considerations have not influenced the decision whether to look through \nor not \u2013 e.g. that the AIFI has not circumvented the exposure limit s by investing in several \nindividually immaterial transactions with identical underlying a ssets.  \n22.4.6  If LTA need not be applied, a n AIFI\u2019s exposure to the structure shall be the nominal \namount it invests in the structure.  \n22.4.7  Any structure where all investors rank pari passu (e.g., CIU)  - When the LTA is \nrequired according to the section s above, the ex posure value assigned to a counterparty is \nequal to the pro rata share that the AIFI holds in the structure multiplied by the value of the \nunderlying asset in the structure. Thus, an AIFI  holding a \u20b91 investment in a structure, which \ninvests in 20 assets each with a value of \u20b95, shall assign an exposure of \u20b90.05 to each of the \ncounterparties. An exposure to such counterparty shall be added to any other direct or \nindirect exposures the AIFI has to that counterparty.  \n22.4.8  Any structure with different seniority levels among investors (e.g. , securitisation \nvehicles)  - When the LTA (in terms of section s above) is required for an investment in a \nstructure with different levels of seniority, the exposu re value to a counterparty sh all be \nmeasured for each tranche within the structure, assuming a pro rata distribution of losses \namongst investors in a single tranche. To compute the exposure value to the underlying \nasset, a n AIFI shall: \n(i) first, consider the lower of the value of the tranche in which the AIFI has invested  and \nthe nominal value of each underlying asset included in the underlying portfolio of assets  \n(ii) second, apply the pro rata share of the AIFI\u2019s investment in the tranche to the value \ndetermined in the first step above.  \n22.4.9  Identification of additional risks  \n(i) While taking exposures to structures, AIFIs shall identify such third parties which may \nconstitute an additional risk factor,  and which are inherent in the structure itself rather than in \nthe unde rlying assets. Such a third party could be a risk factor for more than one structure \nthat a n AIFI  invests in. Examples of roles played by third parties include originator, fund \nmanager, liquidity provider and credit protection provider. The Reserve Bank  as a part of its \nPillar 2 supervisory review and evaluation process will look into this aspect and if required \nspecify a specific course of action which may either include reduction in exposure or raising \nof additional capital.  \n(ii) It is conceivable that a n AIFI may consider multiple third parties to be potential drivers \nof additional risk. In this case, the AIFI shall assign the exposure resulting from the \ninvestment in the relevant structures to each of the third parties.  \n23. Exposures to NBFCs  \n23.1 AIFIs\u2019 exposures to  NBFCs (excluding refinance exposure) shall be subject  to the \nsingle and group of connected counterparty limits prescribed under  section 2 0 above.  \n \n \n  \n253 23.2 AIFls shall not  be permitted to  provide finance to NBFCs for the following activities:  \n(a) Bills discounted / re discounted by NBFCs except those arising from sale of commercial \nvehicles including light commercial vehicles subject to normal lending safeguards;  \n(b) Investments made by NBFCs in shares, debentures, etc., of a current nature (i.e. , \nstock -in-trade);  \n(c) Investmen ts of NBFCs in and advances to subsidiaries, group companies or other \nentities; and  \n(d) Investments of NBFCs in, and inter -corporate loans / deposits to / in other companies.  \n(e) Bridge loans in any form to any category of NBFCs ( including RNBCs)  \n \n24. Exposures to Cen tral Counterparties  \n24.1 AIFIs\u2019 clearing exposure to QCCPs shall be exempt from the large exposure \nframework . However, these exposures shall be subject to the regulatory reporting \nrequirements as prescribed in section 25. \n \n24.2 In the case of non -QCCPs, AIFIs shall measure their exposure as a sum of both the \nclearing exposures describ ed in section  24.4 and the non -clearing exposures described in \nsection 24.5, and the same shall be subject to the large exposure limit  of 25 per cent of the \neligible capital base . \n \n24.3 The c oncept of connected counterparties described in section 2 1 does not apply in \nthe context of exposures to CCPs that are specifically related to clearing activities.  \n \n24.4 Calculation of exposures related to clearing activities:  AIFIs must identify \nexposures to a  CCP related to clearing activities and sum together these exposures. The \nAIFI must determine the counterparty to which exposures must be assigned by applying the \nprovisions of the risk -based capital requirements.  Exposures related to clearing activities a re \nlisted in the table below together with the exposure value to be used:  \nTrade exposures  The exposure value of trade exposures shall be \ncalculated using the exposure measures prescribed in \nother parts of this framework for the respective type of \nexposure s.  \nSegregated initial margin  The exposure value is 0210.  \nNon-segregated initial \nmargin  The exposure value is the nominal amount of initial \nmargin posted.  \nPre-funded default fund \ncontributions  Nominal amount of the funded contribution  \nUnfunded defa ult fund \ncontributions  The exposure value is 0  \n \n24.5 Other exposures:  Other types of exposures that are not directly related to clearing \nservices provided by the CCP, such as equity stake211, funding facilities, credit facilities, \nguarantees etc., must be measu red according to the rules set out in this framework, as for \nany other type of counterparty. These exposures will be added together and be subjected to \nthe large exposure  limit of 25 per cent of the eligible capital base . \n \n                                            \n210 When the initial margin (IM) posted is bankruptcy -remote from the CCP \u2013 in the sense that it is \nsegregated from the CCP\u2019s own accounts, e .g., when the IM is held by a third -party custodian \u2013 this \namount cannot be lost by the AIFI if the CCP defaults; therefore, the IM posted by the AIFI can be \nexempted from the large exposure limit.  \n211 If equity stakes in a CCP are deducted from the capital on whi ch the large exposure limit is based, \nthese must not be included as exposure to the CCP.   \n254 25. Reporting System and Disclosures  \n25.1 AIFIs shall undertake  an annual review of the implementation of exposure \nmanagement measures and place the same before their Boards by the end of June \n(September in the case of NHB). A copy of the review report shall be forwarded to the \nconcerned office of  Department of Supervision.  \n \n25.2 Breach  \n25.2.1  Breach of exposure limits, if any, shall be under exceptional conditions beyond the \ncontrol of AIFI, and needs to be rectified immediately. The breaches  shall be reported to RBI \n(Department of Supervision, Central Offic e) immediately.   \n \n25.2.2  AIFI, if under breach of exposure limits , cannot undertake any further exposure (at \nthe entity or group level, as the case may be) until it is brought down within the limit.  \n \n25.2.3  Failure to comply with the exposure limit may lead to impositio n of penalties on the \nAIFIs by the supervisor.  \n \n25.3 Regulatory reporting  \n25.3.1  AIFIs shall report their Large  Exposures to the Reserve Bank (Department of \nSupervision, Central Office) as per the reporting template  given in Annex 2 1 on a monthly \nbasis. The reporting shall cover the following:  \n(a) All exposures, meeting the definition of large exposure;  \n(b) All other exposures , measured without offsetting exposure value with credit \nrisk mitigation  instruments, meeting the definition of large exposu re; \n(c) All the exempted exposures meeting the definition of large exposure ; \n(d) 20 largest exposures included in the scope of application, irrespective of the \nvalues of these exposures relative to the AIFI\u2019s eligible capital base.  \n \nPart B \u2013 Permitted exposures an d other prudential exposure limit s \n \n26. Permitted exposures and limits  \nFor sector and industry exposures the AIFIs shall fix internal limits for aggregate \ncommitments to specific sectors e.g., textiles, chemicals, engineering, etc. , so that the \nexposures are e venly spread over various sectors.  \nProvided that  these limits shall be fixed having regard to the perceived risks and \nperformance of different sectors and the limits so fixed shall be reviewed periodically.  \n \n27.

Exposures permissible with prior approval of RBI  \n28.1 Working Capital Finance  \nAIFIs shall not be permitted to extend working capital finance, unless specifically permitted \nby the Reserve Bank.  \nProvided that  AIFIs shall be permitted to extend working capital when banks are not in a \nposition to meet the credit requirements of the counterparty concerned on account of \ntemporary liquidity constraints.  \nProvided further that  in case of a counterparty whos e working capital is financed under a \nmultiple banking arrangement, the AIFI shall obtain an auditor's certificate indicating the \nextent of funds already borrowed, before considering the request for further working capital \nfinance.  \n \n29. Exposures  not permissib le \n29.1 Revolving Underwriting Facility  \nAIFIs shall not be permitted to extend Revolving Underwriting Facility to Short Term Floating \nRate Notes / Bonds or Debentures issued by companies. \n258  \nAnnex 18  \n(section 2 1.7) \nIllustrative examples of Economic Interdependenc e Criteria  \nRequirement: Both A and B are customers of the AIFI and the exposure of the AIFI to each \nof them is more than 5% of its eligible capital base .  \n(i) Where 50% or more of one counterparty's gross receipts or gross expenditures (on \nan annual basis) is derived from transactions with the other counterparty  \nIllustrative Example:  \nCompany A is a commercial space provider and company B utilises a major portion of \nthis space and accounts for more than 50% of gross receipts for Counterparty A.  \n(ii) Where one coun terparty has fully or partly guaranteed the exposure of the other \ncounterparty, or is liable by other means, and the exposure is so significant that the \nguarantor is likely to default if a claim occurs;  \nIllustrative Example:  \nCompany A fully or partly gua rantees the loans undertaken by company B and the \nguarantee is so large that it could result in default in payments for A if it is invoked. \nAIFIs may consider parameters like networth, EBITDA, liquid assets, etc to assess \nwhether the guarantor will be in a  position to honour the claim on an on -going basis.  \n(iii) Where a significant part of one counterparty\u2019s production/output is sold to another \ncounterparty, which cannot easily be replaced by other customers;  \nIllustrative Example:  \nWhen a significant part of pr oduct/output/services of Company A is sold to Company \nB and there are no alternate buyers who can be approached if B fails to buy, in such \na case goods may remain unsold and could lead to default in loan repayment by A. \nAn auto part supplier and auto manuf acturing firm could be part of the same \neconomically dependent group based on this criteria. For deciding if the criteria would \nbe applicable to the counterparties  under consideration, AIFIs may use financial \ncriteria like unsold inventory leading to opera ting loss/default in repayment as well as \nsubjective criteria like ability of the seller to find alternate buyer/ market, R&D \ncapability of the seller, etc.  \n \n(iv) When the expected source of funds to repay the loans of both counterparties is the \nsame and neithe r counterparty has another independent source of income from which the \nloan may be serviced and fully repaid;  \nIllustrative Example:  \nTwo auto component manufacturers i.e. , company A and company B are suppliers to \na commercial vehicle manufacturer i.e. , company C. Source of funds for repayment of \nloans taken by A and B is dependent on sales to C. In this case, A and B are \nconnected to each other based on the criteria of economic interdependence. \nImportant factors to consider would be extent of dependence of  A and B on C, ability \nof A and B to find another buyer, etc.  \n(v) Where it is likely that the financial problems of one counterparty would cause \ndifficulties for the other counterparties in terms of full and timely repayment of liabilities;  \nIllustrative Exam ple: \nCompany A supplies intermediate goods to Company C. Company C processes \nthese goods and then sells it to company B. In such cases, difficulties at A could lead \nto difficulties for B. In such cases A and B are economically dependent. AIFIs may \nconsider  factors like financial strength of counterparty B to withstand the shock, its  \n259 ability to find alternate supplier in place of C, etc. to decide on applicability of the \ncriteria.  \n(vi) Where the insolvency or default of one counterparty is likely to be associate d with the \ninsolvency or default of the other(s);  \nIllustrative Example:  \nExamples would include all such cases where insolvency or default of one company \nmay lead to the insolvency or default of the other companies. AIFIs may use criteria \nsuch as intercor porate liabilities, significant trade receivables, etc. to decide on \napplicability of the criteria.  \n(vii) When two or more counterparties rely on the same source for the majority of their \nfunding and, in the event of the common provider\u2019s default, an alternative  provider cannot be \nfound - in this case, the funding problems of one counterparty are likely to spread to another \ndue to a one -way or two -way dependence on the same main funding source.  \nIllustrative Example:  \nCompany A and Company B rely on the same non -AIFI source for their funding \nrequirements and may not have access to alternative sources of funds. In such \ncases, difficulties at common source could lead to difficulties at both the companies \nand thus these companies are interconnected based on economic interdependence. \nImportant factors to consider would be strength of A and B to decide alternate source \nof funds, likelihood of failure of the non -AIFI source, etc.  \nEconomic interdependence with two different entities  \nIf an entity (C) is economically depen dent on two (or more) other entities (A and B) then \npayment difficulty of any one of the entities (A or B) may cause payment difficulties to \ndependent entity (C). Thus, C needs to be added in two different groups (A and C; B and C).  \n \n                                                              Grouping requirement  \n                         \n \n \nSince exposure to C is considered as single risk for two separate groups, it does not amount \nto double counting  of exposure of C.  \n   \n   \n \n260  \nAnnex 19  \n(section 2 1.9) \nRelation between interconnectedness through control and interconnectedness \nthrough economic dependency and illustration of grouping requirements  \nFollowing examples provide illustrations for formulation of group s in case of one -way \ndependency and two -way dependencies.  \n(a) For example, consider A controls A1 and A2, and B controls B1, and B1 is \neconomically dependent on A2 (one -way dependency only i.e. , financial difficulties at A2 \ncould impact B1 but not vice versa) . In this case, B1 should be part of two separate groups of \nA and B.  \n \na) For example, consider A controls A1 and A2, and B controls B1, and B1 is  \neconomically dependent on A2 (one -way dependency only i.e. financial difficulties at  \nA2 could impact B1 but not vice versa). In this case, B1 should be part of two  separate  \ngroups of  A and B.  \nGrouping  requirements:  \n  B \n \n B1 A \nA1 A2  B1  \n \n \nA1 B1 B \nA2 A \n \n \nThree different groups of i) A, A1, A2, ii) B, B1, iii) A2, B1, may not be sufficient as financial \ndifficulties of A2 is likely to cause difficulties for B1 also which is economically  dependent on \nA2 (which in turn is dependent on A).  \n(b) In above example, consider that A2 and B1 have two -way economic dependency  \ni.e., both are economically dependent on each other, which means that financial difficulty at \neither entity could impact the othe r entity.  \n \n \nGrouping  requirements:  A1 B1 B \nA2 A \nA \n A1  A2   B1  \n \n A2 B1 B \n \nDownstream Contagion   \n261 Downstream contagion should be assumed when an entity is economically dependent on \nanother entity and is itself the head of a \u2018control group\u2019. If the other entity is part of a group of \nconnected clients, the control group o f the economically dependent entity should then be \nincluded in the group of connected counterparties to which the economic dependency \nrelationship exists. To overcome its own pending payment difficulties, the economically \ndependent entity is likely to with draw resources from controlled entities, thus extending the \nrisk of contagion downstream.  \nFor example, consider A controls A1 and A2, and B controls B1, and B1 controls B2 and B3. \nFurther, consider B1 has one -way economic dependency on A2. If A2 faces fina ncial \ndifficulty, it may impact B1 adversely, which then is likely to withdraw resources from its \ncontrolled entities B2 and B3.  \n \n \n   A  \n A1  A2  B \nB1 \nB2 B3 \n \nGrouping  requirements:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A \nA1 A2 B1 \nB2 B3 \nB \nB1 \nB2 B3  \n262  \nUpstream Contagion  \nOn the other hand, upstream contagion of entities that control the economically dependent \nentity shoul d be assumed only when the controlling entity is also economically dependent on \nthe entity that constitutes the economic link between the two controlling groups.  \nFor instance , in the above example of downstream contagion, if B1 is so important to B that \nin a sense B is also dependent on B1, then contagion at A could also spread to B, through \nA\u2192A2\u2192B1\u2192B and all these entities would form a single group.  \n B \nA1 A2 B1 \nB2 B3 A \n \n \nLimitations in formulating groups of connected counterparties  \nIf an AIFI is not having exposure to all t he entities, it may be difficult to accurately form group \nof connected counterparties. Such groups shall be formed on best efforts basis and AIFIs \nshall take reasonable steps to collect and use relevant information; this includes publicly \navailable informa tion (e.g. , annual financial statements), information beyond institutions\u2019 \nclients and also soft information that typically exists at the level of individual loan officers and \nrelationship managers. If there are interconnections among entities that are not  clients of the \nAIFI, it may be difficult to formulate correct groupings. However, the AIFI shall incorporate \nany information that may be available to it publicly or through other clients or entities outside \nits clientele.  \nFor instance, in illustration sh own below, if AIFI has exposure to A and B5 only, then it may \nbe difficult to formulate correct groupings.  \n \n  \n263  \nAnnex 20  \n(section 22.4.1) \nLook -Through Approach - a flow chart  \n \n \n Whether the AIFI is able to \nidentify the underlying \ncounterparties in the structure?  \nWhether the AIFI can \ndemonstrate that all underlying \nexposures are less than 0.25% \nof eligible capital base ?

The fair value / market value of these securities shall be arrived on the \nbasis of the prices / YTM of similar tenor Central Government securities put out b y Financial \nBenchmarks India Pvt. Ltd.

Accounting and Provisioning  \n43.1 Income recognition  \n(i) AIFIs shall recognize income on accrual basis for the following:  \n(a) securities of corporate bodies/public sector undertakings in respect of which the \npayment of i nterest and repayment of principal have been guaranteed by the Central \nGovernment or a State Government, provided interest is serviced regularly and as such \nis not in arrears.  \n(b) shares of corporate bodies provided dividend has been declared by the corporate \nbody in its Annual General Meeting and the owner's right to receive payment is \nestablished.  \n(c) Government securities and bonds and debentures of corporate bodies, where \ninterest rates on these instruments are predetermined and provided interest is serviced \nregularly and is not in arrears.  \n(ii) Income from units of mutual funds shall be recognized on cash basis.   \n284  \n43.2 Accounting for Broken Period Interest  \nAIFIs shall not capitalize the broken period interest paid to the seller as part of cost and treat \nit as an item of e xpenditure under Profit & Loss Account in respect of investments in \ngovernment securities220. \n \n43.3 Investment Reserve  Account (IRA)  \n(i) In the event, provisions created on account of depreciation in the \u2018AFS\u2019 or \u2018HFT\u2019 \ncategories are found to be in excess of the requ ired amount in any year, the excess shall be \ncredited to the Profit & Loss Account and an equivalent amount (net of taxes, if any and net \nof transfer to Statutory Reserves as applicable to such excess provision) shall be \nappropriated to an IRA Account in S chedule \u2013 \u201cReserves & Surplus\u201d under the head \u201cOther \nReserves\u201d.  \n \n(ii) IRA shall be eligible for inclusion under Tier 2 within the overall ceiling of 1.25 per \ncent of total Risk Weighted Assets prescribed for General Provisions/ Loss Reserves.  \n \n(iii) The amount drawn down from the IRA shall not be available to an AIFI for payment of \ndivided.  \n \n(iv) The balance in the IRA transferred \u2018below the line\u2019 in the Profit and Loss \nAppropriation Account to Statutory Reserve, General Reserve or balance of Profit & Loss \nAccount is eligi ble to be reckoned as Tier I capital.  \n \n(v) AIFIs shall have the freedom to utilise IRA as follows:  \n(a) The provisions required to be created on account of depreciation in the AFS \nand HFT categories shall be debited to the Profit & Loss Account and an equivalent \namount (net of tax benefit, if any, and net of consequent reduction in the transfer to \nStatutory Reserve), shall be transferred from the IRA to the Profit & Loss Account221. \n(b) The amounts debited to the Profit & Loss Account for provision shall be \ndebited under the head \u2018 Other Income\u2019 . \n(c) The amount transferred from the IRA to the Profit & Loss Account, shall be \nshown as \u2018below the line\u2019 item in the Profit and Loss Appropriation Account, after \ndetermining the profit for the year.  \n(d) Provision towards any erosion in the  value of an asset is an item of charge on \nthe profit and loss account, and hence shall appear in that account before arriving at \nthe profit for the accounting period.  \n(e) Adoption of the following shall not only be adoption of a wrong accounting \nprinciple but  would, also result in a wrong statement of the profit for the accounting \nperiod and AIFIs shall not make the following entries:  \ni. the provision is allowed to be adjusted directly against an item of \nReserves without being shown in the profit and loss account , OR \n                                            \n220 This accounting treatment does not take into account the tax imp lications and AIFIs shall comply with the requirements of \nIncome Tax Authorities as prescribed   \n221 Illustratively, AIFIs  shall have the option to draw down from the IRA to the extent of provision made during the year towards \ndepreciation in investment in A FS and HFT categories (net of taxes, if any, and net of transfer to Statutory Reserves as \napplicable to such excess provision). In other words, a n AIFI  which pays a tax of 30 per cent and should appropriate 25 per cent \nof the net profits to Statutory Reser ves, can draw down \u20b9.52.50 from the IRA, if the provision made for depreciation in \ninvestments included in the AFS and HFT categories is \u20b9.100.    \n285 ii. an AIFI is allowed to draw down from the IRA before arriving at the profit \nfor the accounting period (i.e., above the line), OR  \niii. an AIFI is allowed to make provision for depreciation on investment as a \nbelow the line item, after arriving at the profit for the period.  \n \n43.4 Non-Performing Investments (NPI)  \n(i) AIFIs shall not reckon income on the securities and shall also make appropriate \nprovisions for the depreciation in the value of the investment in respect of securities included \nin any of the three categorie s of investments where interest/ principal is in arrears. AIFIs shall \nnot set -off the depreciation requirement in respect of these non -performing securities against \nthe appreciation in respect of other performing securities.  \n \n(ii) The criterion used to classify  an asset as Non -Performing Asset (NPA) shall be used \nto classify an investment as Non -Performing Investment (NPI) i.e., an NPI is one where \ninterest/ installment (including maturity proceeds) is due and remains unpaid for more than \n90 days.  \n \n(iii) The above sha ll apply, mutatis -mutandis , to preference shares where the fixed \ndividend is not paid. If the dividend on preference shares (cumulative or non -cumulative) is \nnot declared/paid in any year it shall be treated as due/unpaid in arrears and the date of \nbalance  sheet of the issuer for that particular year shall be reckoned as due date for the \npurpose of asset classification.  \n \n(iv) In the case of equity shares, in the event the investment in the shares of any \ncompany is valued at Re.1 per company on account of the non -availability of the latest \nbalance sheet in accordance with section  36.4.2.8 of these Directions, those equity shares \nshall be reckoned as NPI.  \n \n(v) If any credit facility availed by the issuer is NPA in the books of the AIFI, investment in \nany of the securit ies, including preference shares issued by the same issuer shall also be \ntreated as NPI and vice versa.  \nProvided that  this stipulation shall not be applicable in cases where only the preference \nshares are classified as NPI, and in such cases, the investmen t in any of the other \nperforming securities issued by the same issuer need not be classified as NPI and any \nperforming credit facilities granted to that borrower need not be treated as NPA.  \n \n(vi) In case of conversion of principal and/or interest into equity, d ebentures, bonds, etc., \nsuch instruments shall be treated as NPA ab initio in the same asset classification category \nas the loan, if the loan's classification is substandard or doubtful on implementation of the \nrestructuring package and provision shall be made as per the norms.  \n \n(vii) Government guaranteed investments  \n(a) Investment in State Government Guaranteed securities, shall attract prudential norms \nfor identification of NPI and provisioning, when interest/ instalment of principal (including \nmaturity proceeds) or any other amount due to the AIFI remains unpaid for more than 90 \ndays.  \n(b) AIFI\u2019s investments in bonds guaranteed by Central Government shall not be classified \nas NPI until the Central Government has repudiated the guarantee when invoked. However, \nthis exem ption from classification as NPI shall not be available  for the purpose of recognition \nof income.   \n286 Annex 2 2 \n(section 37.4) \nSeparate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities (STRIPS)  - \nAccounting and Valuation  \n1. STRIPS shall be valued and accounted for as zero coupon bonds and in the manner \nprescribed in in these Directions.  \n2. The discount rates used for valuation of STRIPS at inception shall be market -based. \nHowever, in case traded zero -coupon rates are not available, the zero coupon yie lds \npublished by FBIL shall be used instead.  \n3. Accounting entries in the SGL accounts as a consequence of stripping/reconstitution, shall \nbe passed at the face value. SGL account of participant placing request for stripping shall be \ndebited by the face v alue of the Government Security, and shall be simultaneously credited \nwith the aggregate face value of Coupon STRIPS (equal to the aggregate coupon amounts) \nas well as the face value of Principal STRIPS (equal to the face value of the government \nsecurity)222.  \n4. On the day of stripping, the STRIPS shall be recognised in the books of account of the \nparticipant at their discounted value and at the same time, the Government Security in \nquestion shall be derecognised. The accounting treatment for reconstitution shall be exactly \nthe opposite of stripping. The detailed procedure for accounting of STRIPS is given below.  \n4.1 The stripping/reconstitution shall not result in any profit or loss. The present value of the \nSTRIPS (coupon as well as principal) discounted u sing the Zero Coupon Yield Curve (ZCYC) \nshall be normalized using a factor that will be the ratio of the book value or market value of \nthe security (whichever is lower) to the sum total of the market value of all STRIPS created \nout of the security223. \n4.2 AI FIs can strip eligible Government Securities held under the AFS/HFT category of their \ninvestment portfolio.  \n4.3 In case STRIPS are created from securities held in the HTM portfolio, the securities shall \nbe transferred from the HTM category to the AFS/HFT c ategory as per these Directions. \nThereafter, the lower of the book value/market value shall be used for normalizing the market \nvalue of individual STRIPS to the book value/market value. Post - stripping, the book \nvalue/market value of the existing securitie s shall be derecognized and replaced by the \nnormalized value of STRIPS whose sum total shall exactly equal the book value/market \nvalue of the extinguished security (thereby ensuring that there is no profit or loss on account \n                                            \n222 Reference is invited to illustration given in Annex 3 of circular no.

Any appreciation , arising due to the shifting of the security from HTM shall be \nignored. The same methodology shall be followed for securities that are stripped from the \nAFS/HFT portfolio.  \n4.4 Before a security is stripped, it shall be marked to market. Appreciation, if a ny, shall be \nignored and depreciation, if any, shall be recognised, if the market value is lower than the \nbook value. Such depreciation shall not be aggregated for the purpose of arriving at net \ndepreciation/appreciation of investment under the AFS/HFT cat egory. The book value/ \nmarket value of the security, whichever is lower, shall be used to normalise the STRIPS.  \n4.5 The Normalisation principle, on stripping/reconstitution shall be applied on the clean price \nof the security (without considering the accrue d interest) as the accrued interest is booked as \nincome/expenditure.  \n4.6 Normalisation shall also be applied in the case of reconstitution (even when STRIPS are \nacquired from the market).  \n4.7 The book value of the STRIPS (ZCBs) shall be valued and marked t o market as per \nthese Directions. Accordingly, the book value of the STRIPS shall be marked up to the extent \nof accrued interest before MTM.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n288 Annex 2 3 \n(Section 38.10 (iv)(b))  \nFormat for Disclosure in the \"Notes on Accounts\" in the Published F inancial \nStatements in respect of Non-Government investment portfolio  \n \nA.

However, this \nstipulation shall not be applicable in cases where only the preference \nshares are classified as NPI, and in suc h cases, the investment in any of \nthe other performing securities issued by the same issuer need not be \nclassified as NPI and any performing credit facilities granted to that \nborrower need not be treated as NPA.  \n(v) In case of conversion of principal and / or interest into equity, debentures, \nbonds, etc., such instruments shall be classified in the same asset \nclassification category as the loan  and provision shall be made as per the \nnorms.  In case of post conversion,  if the classification is standard or is \nsubsequently upgraded to standard as per IRACP norms, the investment \nshall be categorised in HTM, AFS or FVTPL  (including HFT)  as per the \nrequirements of Chapter III above.  \n(b) Once an investment is classified as an NPI, it should be segregated from \nrest of th e portfolio and not considered for netting valuation gains and \nlosses.  \n(c) Banks shall not accrue any income on NPIs.

No. 1: Whether similar securities can be classified under different categories  \n(viz. HTM, AFS or HFT)  - for example, with respect to a debt security fulfilling the \nSolely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria, whether the quantity/lot \nacquired at one point in time can be classified in the HTM  category while another  \nlot acquired subsequently is classified under different category?  \n(Refer Clause 6 of Directions)  \nAns:  A bank may have different objectives with which it invests in securities. For \ninstance, a bank may hold a portfolio of debt securities that it manages in order to \ncollect contractual cash flows and another portfolio of similar debt securities that it \nacqu ired with the purpose of trading (HFT) or for liquidity purposes (AFS). Therefore, \nsimilar securities, even if acquired at the same point of time or in the same lot, can be \nclassified under different categories if acquired with different objectives.  Howev er, the \nobjective with which the securities are being acquired should be clearly established \nand documented before  or at the time of  acquisition.    \nQ. No. 2: In which  category would securities acquired/ held for SLR purposes \nbe classified?  \n (Refer Clause 6 of Directions)  \nAns:  The classification principles outlined in the Reserve Bank of India (Classification, \nValuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, \n2023 , are not based on criteria used for differentiating between the SLR and non -SLR \nsecurities. Accounting classification is based on the objective with which the security \nwas acquired and the SPPI criterion. Therefore, SLR and non -SLR securities  that meet \nSPPI criteria  can be classified under HTM, AFS  or HFT depending upon the objective \nwith which they have been acquired.   Securities that do not meet SPPI criteria would  \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-65- \n \nneed to be classified under FVTPL ( including under HFT  sub-category  if acquired for \ntradin g). \nQ.No. 3: Whether the SLR securities used for purposes such as liquidity or \ninterest rate risk management can qualify for HTM category?   \n(Refer Clause 6.2 of Directions)  \nAns: The bank would need to determine whether the objective with which it acquires \na security would allow it to hold the security to maturity  (HTM)  or whether it would \nrequire flexibility to routinely sell those securities before maturity  (AFS) .  Illustratively, \nif the objective with which a security is acquired is to manage everyday liq uidity needs , \nthe bank would need the flexibility to routinely sell those securities before maturity.  In \nsuch cases, assuming the security meets the SPPI criteria, it should be classified \nunder AFS  rather than HTM .  On the other hand, a security acquired for meeting the \nHQLA requirements of the LCR framework need not necessarily be classified under \nAFS, if the bank does not intend to routinely sell the security before maturity and \ninstead intends to liquidate such an investment before maturity only when fa cing a \nliquidity stress.  \nQ.No. 4: As per extant norms banks are required to maintain L CR\u2019, which inter -\nalia requires the maintenance of adequate level of HQLA that can be converted \ninto cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day horizon. The extant \nregulations require that HQLA should be free of any encumbrance (legal, \nregulatory or operational) and capa ble of being readily sold or used as collateral \nto obtain funds in a range of stress scenarios. One of the key regulatory \nrequirements is that banks should periodically monetize a proportion of assets \nthrough repo or outright sale to test the saleability o f these assets and to \nminimize the risk of negative signalling during period of stress.  Whether \nsecurities  held to comply with LCR qualif y for classification  under HTM ? \n(Refer Clause 6.1(a)(i) of Directions)  \nAns:  It may be noted that the regulatory objective of periodic monetisation of assets \ncan also be met through repo. Repo of securities shall not be inconsistent with the  \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-66- \n \nHTM classification.  On the other hand, if the bank intends to sell securities to meet \nthe regulatory objective and the value of the securities to be sold is significant (i.e. \nmore than five per cent of the opening carrying value of the HTM portfolio), such \nsecurities would  not meet the criteria to be categorised under HTM.  \nQ.No.5: What are the general aspects that can be considered for SPPI criterion ?  \n(Refer Clause s 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b), 6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nCertain general aspects with respect to the solely payment of principal and interest \n(\u2018SPPI\u2019) criteria are as under:  \n(i) Securities with c ontractual cash flow s that meet \u2018SPPI criterion\u2019 are consistent \nwith a \u2018basic lending arrangement \u2019.  In a basic lending arrangement, time \nvalue of money and credit risk are the most significant element s of the interest  \ncomponent . However, interest could also include consideration for other basic \nlending risks (for example, liquidity risk) and costs (for example, administrative \ncosts) associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time  \nas well as a profit margin.  \n(ii) Contractual terms that introduce exposure to risk or volatility in contractual cash \nflows that is unrelated with a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to \nchange in equity price or commodity price, do not give rise to contractual cash \nflow that are consistent with the SPPI  criterion .  \n(iii) In respect of foreign currency denominated securitie s, banks shall assess \nwhether contractual cash flows meet SPPI criterion for the currency in which \nthe investment is denominated  rather than making such determination after \ntranslating to Indian Rupee . \nSecurities that meet the SPPI criteria would inter-alia include debt instruments with a \nspecified maturity/call date such as Government Securities (including non -interest -\nbearing recapitalisation bonds) and non -convertible Corporate Bonds, perpetual \ninstruments (without contractual loss absorbency features su ch as discretionary \ncoupons/ dividends and contingent write -off/ conversion to equity).   \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-67- \n \nQ.No. 6: In cases where the interest rates are regulated, would interest charged \nmeet the criteria of time value of money for evaluating SPPI criterion?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b),  6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns:   Regulated interest rate shall be considered as a proxy for the time value of \nmoney element for the purpose of assessing SPPI criterion.  \nQ.No. 7: As part of Basel III Capital Regulations in India, banks are permitted to \ninclude Perpetual Non -Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) and Perpetual \nDebt Instruments (PDI) issued by them subject to certain conditions as part of \nAdditional Tier 1 (AT1) capit al.  These conditions inter -alia include loss \nabsorption features that entail a write down/ conversion to equity at certain pre -\nspecified triggers.  In order to be eligible for inclusion in AT 1 these features \nhave to be contractually included. Similarly, with respect to debt instruments \nqualifying for Tier 2 capital under Basel III, certain loss absorbency features \nsuch as Point of Non -Viability (PONV) trigger are required to be contractually \nincluded. The issue arises as to whether investments in such AT1  and Tier 2 \ninstruments would be eligible for HTM or AFS classification?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b),  6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns.  The contractual cash flows would not meet SPPI criterion if the contractual terms \nof the securities permit or require the issuer (or another entity ) to impose losses on the \nholder (for example, by writing down the par value or by converting the instrument into \na fixed number of the issuer\u2019s ordinary shares).  They would not meet SPPI even if the \nprobability is remote that such a loss will be imposed. Thus, Basel III compliant AT 1 \nand Tier 2 instruments would not meet SPPI criterion and cannot be classified  under \nHTM or AFS.  \nQ.No.8: Whether inflation indexed bond s meet the SPPI criterion. The inflation \nindexed bonds have stated maturity date and payments of principal and interest \non the principal amount outstanding are linked to an inflation index of the  \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-68- \n \ncurrency in which the instrument is issued. The inflation link is not leveraged, \nand the principal is protected.  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b),  6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns:  Linking payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding \nto an unleveraged44 inflation index resets the time value of money to a current level. \nIn other words, the interest rate on the instrument reflects \u2018real\u2019 interest. Thus, the \ninterest amounts are consideration for the time value of money on the principal amount \noutstanding.  Therefore, the contractual cash flows could be considered to meet SPPI \ncriterion.  \nQ.No. 9: Whether securities with step -up and step -down interest rate feature s \nmeet SPPI criterion?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b),  6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns. Securities with step -up and step -down interest rate shall meet SPPI criterion \nwhere interest represents consideration only for the time value of money, the credit \nrisk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time, \nother basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin.  If interest rate chan ges \nbased on certain event, banks need to assess the nature of any contingent event (i.e., \nthe trigger) that would change the timing or amount of the contractual cash flows.  For \nexample, a security with an interest rate that is reset to a higher rate if t he debtor \nmisses a particular number of payments is likely to meet SPPI criterion because of the \nrelationship between missed payments and an increase in credit risk. On the other \nhand, a security with an interest rate that is reset to a higher rate if a sp ecified equity \nindex reaches a particular level shall not meet SPPI criterion.  \n                                                            \n44 Leverage is a contractual cash flow characteristic of some financial instruments. In the general sense a leveraged \nfinancial product allows an investor  to take exposure higher than his investment into that product. In this specific \ncontext, it refers to a payment that is a multiple of the index. It may be noted that leveraged financial products \nincluding derivatives would not meet the SPPI criteria.   \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-69- \n \nQ.No. 10 : Do subordinated securities meet SPPI criterion?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b),  6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns. A security that is subordinated to other securities may have contractual cash \nflows that meet SPPI criterion if the debtor\u2019s non -payment is a breach of contract, and \nthe holder has a contractual right to unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the \nprincipal amount outstanding even in the event of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy, albeit after \nall the senior creditors are first paid -off.  In general, subordinated bonds/debentures \ncarry higher interest rates - such higher rates may generally be attributable to the  \nadditional credit risk borne by the holders. Therefore, such bonds may not necessarily \nfail the SPPI criteria.  \nQ.No. 11 : Whether a security that pays an inverse floating interest rate (i.e., the \ninterest rate has an inverse relationship to market interest rates) meet SPPI \ncriterion?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b),  6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns. The contractual  cash flows of such securities shall not meet SPPI criterion. The \ninterest amounts are not consideration for the time value of money on the principal \namount outstanding.  \nQ.No.12 : A security is a perpetual instrument, but the issuer may call the \ninstrument at any point and pay the holder the par amount plus accrued interest \ndue. This security pays a market interest rate, but payment of interest cannot be \nmade unless the issuer is able to remain solvent immediately afterwards. \nDeferred interest does not accru e additional interest.  Would this security be \nconsidered as meeting the SPPI criterion?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b), 6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns. The fact that security is perpetual does not in itself mean that the contractual \ncash flows do not meet SPPI criterion. In effect, a perpetual instrument has continuous \n(multiple) extension options. Such options may result in contractual cash flows that  \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-70- \n \nmeet SPPI criterion if interest payments are mandatory and must be paid in perpetuity. \nAlso, the fact that security is callable does not mean that the contractual cash flows \ndo not meet SPPI criterion unless it is callable at an amount that does not substant ially \nreflect payment of outstanding principal and interest on that principal amount \noutstanding. Even if the callable amount includes an amount that reasonably \ncompensates the holder for the early termination of the instrument, the contractual \ncash flows could meet SPPI criterion.  \nIn the given case, the contractual terms provide for deferment of interest wherein \nadditional interest does not accrue.  Consequently, interest amounts are not \nconsideration for the time value of money on the principal amount out standing. \nTherefore, contractual cash flows do not meet SPPI criterion.  \nQ.No. 13 : Will investment in units of investment funds  (like mutual funds, AIFs, \netc.) meet SPPI criterion?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b), 6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns.  Contractual cash flow in case of investment funds (like mutual fund) is mostly \nthrough redemption of units  or dividends on such units . This may include fair value \nchange of underlying assets in which the fund has invested. Therefore, the contractual \ncash flow from units of investment funds such as Mutual Funds, Alternative Investment \nFunds, etc. generally  do not  meet the SPPI criterion.   No look through approach is \nenvisaged in such cases.  \nQ.No.14 : Whether investment in Security Receipts (SR) / Pass Throug h \nCertificates (PTCs)/ other securities issued by Asset Reconstruction Companies \npredicated on recovery from underlying securities meet SPPI criterion?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b), 6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns. The contractual cash flow in SR, PTC or other securities issue d by ARCs \npredicated on recoveries from the underlying asset  may not strictly represent payment \nof principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Therefore, such \ninvestment s shall not meet the SPPI criterion .  \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-71- \n \nQ.No.15: A bank has invested in a financial asset with an embedded derivative.  \nShould the asset be tested for SPPI criterion separately and the embedded \nderivative accounted for separately?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b), 6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns. Where a bank has invested in a hybrid financial asset with an embedded \nderivative, it should test the instrument in its entirety for SPPI criterion and classify \naccordingly rather than separating the embedded derivative from the instrument .  \nQ.No.16: Whether securities otherwise fulfilling the criteria for HTM \nclassification but hedged with an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) as under be \ncontinued to be classified under HTM?  \n(a) Can a floating rate note swapped to fixed yield using IRS be held under HTM?  \n(b) Can a fixed rate bond where a fixed to floating swap has been entered into \nbe kept under HTM?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b), 6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3(a) of Directions)  \nAns. In both cases, the derivative is a separate transaction from the hedge d item.  The \nhedged item will be classified as per the requirements of the directions.  Therefore, if \nthe bank intends to hold the instrument to maturity and the instrument meets the SPPI \ncriterion, it can be classified under HTM.  The derivative on the ot her hand, shall be \naccounted for as per the ICAI\u2019s Guidance Note on Accounting for Derivative Contracts.  \nSubject to the bank complying with the hedge accounting requirements of the said \nGuidance note, it may make changes in the carrying value of the hedge d instruments \nas specified in the said Guidance Note.  \n  \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-72- \n \nQ.No.17: In the case of an investment in a securitisation tranche, how will a bank \ndetermine if the credit risk of the tranche is equal to or lower than the credit risk \nof the combined underlying pool of assets?  \n(Refer Clauses 6.1(a)(ii), 6.1(b), 6.2(a)(ii) and 6.3 (a) of Directions)  \nAns.   In some cases, it might be possible to compare the credit rating allocated to the \ntranche as compared with that (or the average of those) for the underlying pool of \nfinancial instruments, if they are all rated. Also, for the more s enior and junior tranches, \nit may be obvious, with relatively little analysis, whether the tranche is less or more \nrisky than the underlying assets. However, in some circumstances involving complex \nsecuritisation structures, a detailed assessment may be re quired.   Where such an \nassessment cannot be made easily, the investment in the tranche shall be treated as \nnot meeting the SPPI criterion.  \nChapter \u2013 IV Initial recognition  \nQ.No.1 8: What is the fair value of a security at initial recognition?  Do we need \nto compare the transaction price with the end -of-day price?  \n(Refer Clause 7 of Directions)  \nAns.  The transaction price at initial recognition shall be presumed to be the fair value.  \nGenerally, this presumption need not even be tested especially in an arms\u2019 length \ntransaction between unrelated parties in an active market.  Where securities are \nacquired th rough an auction such as a corporate bond  being acquired through bidding \non an electronic bidding platform (EBP) on a recognised stock exchange and in \ncompliance with extant SEBI regulations,  the presumption that the bid price is the fair \nvalue generally h olds.  Accordingly, there is no need to compare market transactions \nwith the end -of-day price in most situations. However, in certain situations such as \ntransactions between related parties, coupons/ yield not in consonance with prevailing \nmarket yields, etc. this presumption needs to be tested.   \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-73- \n \nQ.No.1 9: At what value will special securities received from Government of India \ntowards a bank\u2019s recapitalisation requirement be recognised ?  \n(Refer Clause 7 of Directions)  \nAns.  Special securities received from the Government of India towards \nrecapitalisation  of banks  shall be initially recognised at the ir fair value as determined \nunder Clause 2 5 of these Directions  i.e.  the fair value of these securities shall be \narrived on the basis of the prices / YTM of similar tenor Central Government securities \nput out by FBIL.   Any difference between the acquisition cost and fair value so arrived \nshall be immediately recognized in the Profit and Loss Account.  \nQ.No. 20: An equity share which is acquired in satisfaction of a debt is listed and \nactively traded on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE. How should it \nbe recognised? What if the share is not listed?  \n(Refer Clause 7 and 2 6.3 of Directions)  \nAns.  As the transaction has taken place outside the principal market for the equity \nshares it should be recognised at its fair value.  The fair value shall be determined in \nterms of Chapter VIII of these Directions . Thus, where the share is listed its fair val ue \nshall be the quoted price on NSE/ BSE.  Where the share is unlisted, the fair value for \nthe purpose of these Directions shall be the break -up value.  \nChapter \u2013 VI Reclassifications between categories  \nQ.No.21: When is the reclassification recorded in the books of the bank?  \n(Refer Chapter -VI of Directions)  \nAns.   If a bank is permitted  to reclassify its investment portfolio, it shall apply the \nreclassification prospectively from the reclassification date. The entity shall not restate \nany previously recognised gains, losses or interest. The reclassification date shall be \nthe first day of  the first reporting period following the supervisory permission allowing \nreclassification of financial asset. For example, an entity with a reporting year -end of \n31st March might get permission to reclassify its investment portfolio in August. If the  \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-74- \n \nbank  prepares and publishes quarterly re sults, it should apply the old classification up \nto 30th September and, as of 1st October  (\u2018reclassification date\u2019) , reclassify all affected \ninvestment and apply the new classification prospectively from that date.  \nChapter \u2013 VII Sale of investments from HTM  \nQ.No.22: Will securities sold under repo from HTM category considered as sale \nfrom HTM?  \n(Refer Chapter -VII of Directions)  \nAns.   In terms of Annex I  to Repurchase Transactions (Repo) (Reserve Bank) \nDirections, 2018 , repo transactions are accounted for as a collateralised lending and \nborrowing transaction with an agreement t o repurchase, on the agreed terms.  \nTherefore, repo of securities from HTM category, compliant with the said directions, \nshall not be considered as sale from HTM.  \nChapter -VIII- Fair Value of Investments  \nQ.No.2 3: Under which level of the fair value hierar chy would investments in \nunits of a mutual fund be categorised?  \n(Refer C lause 2 7 of Directions)  \nAns.   The regulatory intent behind requiring the disclosure of fair value hierarchy is to \nindicate the level of reliability of the fair value measurement.  Therefore, where the \ninvestment is in an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) which is actively traded on a \nrecognis ed stock exchange, the fair valuation of such units based on unadjusted \nquoted prices of the ETF shall be categorised as Level 1.  In the case of non -ETF open \nended Mutual Fund s, where redemptions and subscriptions are taking place at the \ndisclosed Net Asset Value on a daily basis with sufficient volume to be considered an \nactive market, the investment may be classified as Level 1.    \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-75- \n \nQ.No.2 4: Under which level of the fair value hierarchy would investments in \nunits of an Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) b e categorised?  \n(Refer C lause 2 7 of Directions)  \nAns.  If the units of the AIF are not actively traded nor are there any subscriptions and \nredemptions at a daily published NAV, the valuation shall be classified as Level  3.  \n \n  \n-76- Guidance on journal entries  \nNote: The guidance on journal entries is prepared for illustrative purposes only to aid banks in their understanding of  the Directions.   Banks \nmay modify them suitably for their accounting systems while ensuring compliance with the Directions.  For simplicity, while preparing \nillustrations, straight line amortisation of discount has been assumed and the effect of taxation or standard asse t provisioning has been \nignored.  \nDay 1 Loss in HTM and amortisation of discount  \nQ.No.25: A bank has acquired a debt security  with the objective to hold till maturity ( HTM). The security meets the SPPI criteria  \nwith following particulars:  \n\uf0b7 Face Value: \u20b9 100, coupon: 5%, Residual tenor: 5 years  \n\uf0b7 Acquisition cost: \u20b9 95, Fair Value at time of acquisition: \u20b9 75 \nHow is the discount on a debt security determined?  How will the discount be amortised over the remaining tenor?   \n(Refer Clause 9 and 1 2(b) of Directions)  \nAns: At initial recognition, there is a Day 1 loss of \u20b9 20 which needs to be recognised immediately.  Consequently, the value at which the \nsecurity is recognised is \u20b9 75. The accounting entries on the date of acquisition would be as under:  \n Particulars  Debit ( \u20b9) Credit ( \u20b9) \nAt initial recognition  Investment                 Dr.  \nDay 1 Loss (P&L)      Dr.  \nTo Cash/ Bank  \n(Being acquisition of security of face value \u20b9100 and fair value \u20b975 for \u20b995.) 75 \n20  \n \n95 \n  \n \nReserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of  \nInvestment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 202 3 \n \n \n-77- \n \nThe discount (i.e., difference between Face Value and amount initially recognised in the books) is \u20b9  25.

The revised regulatory framework for IDF-NBFCs  is provided in the Annex.  These\nguidelines shall come into effect from the date of this circular .\nYours faithfully,  \n(J.P. S\nharma)  \nChief General Manager   \n2 \n Annex  \nAn IDF is set up either as a trust or as a company. A trust based IDF is registered as an \nIDF-Mutual Fund (IDF -MF) and is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of \nIndia ( SEBI ) whereas a company based IDF is registered as an IDF- NBFC and is \nregulated by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI).  \n2. Definition  \nAn IDF -NBFC means a non- deposit taking NBFC which is permitted to \u2013 (i) refinance post \ncommencement operations date (COD)  infrastructure projects that have completed at \nleast one year of satisfactory commercial operations ; and (ii) finance toll operate transfer \n(TOT) projects  as the direct  lender . \n3. Net owned funds (NOF) and r egulatory capital  \nAn IDF -NBFC shall be required to have an NOF of at least \u20b9300 crore and capital -to-risk \nweighted assets ratio (CRAR) of minimum 15 per cent (with minimum Tier 1 capital of 10 \nper cent).  \n4. Raising of funds \n(i) IDF-NBF C shall raise funds  through issue of either rupee or dollar denominated bonds \nof minimum five -year maturity. With a view to facilitate better asset -liability \nmanagement (ALM), IDF- NBFCs can raise funds through shorter tenor bonds and \ncommercial papers (CPs) from the domestic  market to the extent of up to 10 per cent \nof their total outstanding borrowings.  \n(ii) In addition to the bond route, IDF -NBFCs can also raise funds through loan route \nunder external commercial borrowings (ECBs). However, such borrowings shall be \nsubject to mi nimum tenor of five years and the ECB loans should not be sourced from \nforeign branches of Indian banks . \n(iii) Regarding ECBs, IDF- NBFCs shall also be required to adhere to the guidelines issued \nby the Foreign Exchange Department of the RBI.  \n  \n3 \n 5. Exposure limits   \nThe exposure limits for IDF -NBFCs shall be  30% of their  Tier 1 capital for single borrower/ \nparty and 50% of their  Tier 1 capital for single group of borrowers/ parties . \n6. Risk weights \nFor computing CRAR of the IDF- NBFCs, their assets shall be risk -weigh ted as per risk -\nweights applicable to NBFC -Investment and Credit Companies (NBFC -ICCs).  \n7. Requirements of a sponsor and tripartite agreement  \n7.1 Under the earlier guidelines, an IDF- NBFC was required to be sponsored by a bank \nor an NBFC- Infrastructure Finance Company (NBFC -IFC). The requirement of a sponsor \nfor an IDF- NBFC has now been withdrawn  and shareholders of IDF- NBFCs shall be \nsubjected to scrutiny as applicable to other NBFCs, including NBFC -IFCs.  \n7.2 Earlier, IDF -NBFCs were required to enter into a tripartite agreement with the \nconcessionaire and the project authority for investments in the Public Private Partnership \n(PPP)  infrastructure projects having a project authority.

Under the extant \nguidelines , lending institutions  have the operational autonomy to formulate Board \napproved policy for levy of penal rates of interest . It has been observed that many REs \nuse p enal rate s of interest, over and above the applicable  interest rates, in case of  \ndefaults /  non-compliance by the borrower with the terms on which credit facilities were \nsanctioned .  \n2. The intent of levying penal interest /charges  is essentially to inculcate a sense of credit \ndiscipline and such charges are not meant to be used as a revenue enhancement tool \nover and above the contracted  rate of interest . However, supervisory reviews have \nindicated divergent practices amongst the REs with regard to levy of penal \ninterest /charges  leading to customer  grievances and disputes .   \n3. On a review  of the practices followed by REs for charging penal interest /charges  on \nloans , the following instructions are issued for adoption.  \n(i) Penalty, if charged, for non -compliance of material  terms and conditions of loan \ncontract by the borrower shall be treated as \u2018penal charges\u2019 and shall not be levied in the \nform of \u2018penal interest\u2019 that is added to the rate of interest charged on the advances. \nThere shall be no capitalisation of penal char ges i.e., no further interest computed on  \n2 \n such charges. However, this will not affect the normal procedures for compounding of \ninterest in the loan account.  \n(ii) The REs shall not introduce any additional component to the rate of interest  and \nensure compli ance to these guidelines in both letter and spirit . \n(iii) The REs shall formulate a Board approved policy on penal charges or similar charges  \non loans , by whatever name called.   \n(iv) The quantum of penal charges shall be reasonable and commensurate with the non-\ncompliance of material  terms and conditions of loan contract without being discriminat ory \nwithin  a particular loan / product category.  \n(v) The penal charges in case of  loans sanctioned to \u2018individual borrowers , for purposes \nother than business \u2019, shall not be higher than the penal charges applicable to non -\nindividual borrowers  for similar non -compliance of material terms and conditions . \n(vi) The quantum and reason for p enal charges shall be clearly disclosed by REs to the \ncustomers in the loan agre ement and most important terms & conditions  / Key Fact \nStatement ( KFS) as applicable,  in addition to being displayed on REs  website under \nInterest rates and Service Charges.  \n(vii) Whenever reminders for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of loan are \nsent to borrowers , the applicable penal charges  shall be communicated . Further, any \ninstance of levy of penal charges and the reason therefor shall also be communicated.  \n(viii) These instructions  shall come into effect from January 1, 2024 . REs may carry out \nappropriate revision s in their policy framework and ensure implementation of the \ninstructions in respect of all the fresh loans availed/ renewed from the effective date . In \nthe case of existing loans, the switchover to new penal charges regime shall be ensured \non next review or renewal date or six months from the effective date of th is circular, \nwhichever is earlier.  \n4.

Introduction \nPrimary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are expected to lay down, with the approval of their boards, \ntransparent policies and guidelines for credit dispensation, in respect of each broad category of economic \nactivity, keeping in view the credit exposure norms and various other guidelines issued by the Reserve \nBank of India from time to time. \nIn order to ensure that the loan policy of the bank reflects approved internal risk appetite and remains in \nalignment with the extant regulations, it shall be reviewed by the Board at least once in a financial year. \n2. Working Capital Requirements \n2.1 The assessment of working capital requirement of borrowers, other than micro and small enterprises , \nrequiring fund based working capital limits up to \u20b91 crore and micro and small enterprises  requiring fund \nbased working capital limits up to \u20b95 crore from the banking system may be made on the basis of their \nprojected annual turnover. \n2.2 In accordance with these guidelines, the working capital requirement is to be assessed at 25% of the \nprojected turnover to be shared between the borrower and the bank, viz. borrower contributing 5% of the turnover as Net Working Capital (NWC) and bank providing finance at a minimum of 20% of the turnover. \nProjected turnover may be interpreted as 'Gross Sales' including excise duty. \n2.3 The banks may, at their discretion, carry out the assessment based on projected turnover basis or the \ntraditional method. If the credit requirement based on traditional production / processing cycle is higher \nthan the one assessed on projected turnover basis, the same may be sanctioned, as borrower must be \nfinanced up to the extent of minimum 20 per cent of their projected annual turnover. The projected annual \nturnover would be estimated on the basis of annual statements of accounts or other documents such as \nreturns filed with sales -tax / revenue authorities. Actual drawals may be allowed on the basis of drawing \npower to be determined by UCBs after excluding unpaid stocks.  \n2.4 Drawals against the limits should be allowed against the usual safeguards including drawing power and it is to be ensured that the same are used for the purpose intended. Banks will have to ensure regular \nand timely submission of monthly statements of stocks, receivables, etc., by the borrowers and also \nperiodical verification of such statements vis -\u00e0-vis physical stocks by their officials.  \n2.5 In respect of borrowers other than m icro and s mall enterpr ises, requiring working capital limits above \n\u20b91 crore and for m icro and small enterprises/ units requiring fund based working capital limits above \u20b95 \ncrore, UCBs may determine the working capital requirements according to their perception of the credit \nneeds of borrowers. UCBs may adopt turnover method or cash budgeting method or any other method \nas considered necessary. However, UCBs may ensure that the book -debt finance does not exceed 75% \nof the limits sanctioned to borrowers for financing inland credit sales. The remaining 25% of the credit \nsales may be financed through bills to ensure greater use of bills for financing sales.  \n3. Loan System for Delivery of Bank Credit  \n3.1 In the case of borrowers enjoying wor king capital credit limits of \u20b910 crore and above from the banking \nsystem, the loan component should normally be 80% and the remaining Cash Credit component. UCBs \nhave been given freedom to change the composition of working capital by increasing the cash credit \ncomponent beyond 20 per cent or incr ease the loan component beyond 80 per cent, as the case may be, \nif they so desire. UCBs are expected to appropriately price each of the two components of working capital \nfinance, taking into account the impact of such decisions on their cash and liquidity management. \n3.2 In the case of borrowers with working capital (fund based) credit limit of less than \u20b910 crore, banks \nmay persuade them to go in for the Loan System by offering an incentive in the form of lower rate of interest on the 'loan component' as c ompared to the 'cash credit component' The actual percentage of \n'loan component' in these cases may be settled by the bank with its borrower clients.  \n  \n4 \n 3.3 Ad hoc Credit Limit \nThe release of ad hoc / additional credit for meeting temporary requirements may be considered by the \nfinancing bank only after the borrower has fully utilised / exhausted the existing limit. As certain concerns \nwere observed with regard to practices followed by banks in this regard, it has been reiterated vide circular  \nDoS.CO.PPG.BC.1/11.01.005/2020-21 dated August 21, 2020 , that bank s are expected to have a \ndetailed Board approved policy on methodology and periodicity for review/renewal of credit facilities within \nthe overall regulatory guidelines and adhere to the same strictly. Further, timely and comprehensive \nreview/renewal of credit facilities should be an integral part of the Board approved loan policy and credit \nrisk management framework, and banks should avoid frequent and repeated ad-hoc  / short \nreview/renewal of credit facilities without justifiable reasons. Banks are also advised to capture all the data \nrelating to regular as well as ad- hoc/short review/renewal of credit facilities in their core banking \nsystems/management information systems and make the same available for scrutiny as and when \nrequired by any audit or inspection by Auditors/RBI. Moreover, the processes governing review/renewal \nof credit facilities should be brought under the scope of concurrent/internal audit/internal control \nmechanism of banks with immediate effect. \n3.4 Sharing of Working Capital Finance \nIn respect of consortium lending, the level of individual bank's share in Cash Credit and Loan Component \nshall be governed by the norm for single / group borrowers\u2019 credit exposure. \n3.5 Rate of Interest  \nUCBs are allowed to fix separate lending rates for 'loan component' and 'cash credit component'. \n3.6 Period of Loan \nThe minimum period of the loan for working capital purposes may be fixed by banks in consultation with \nborrowers. Banks may decide to split the loan component according to the need of the borrower with different maturity bases for each segment and allow roll over. \n3.7 Export Credit \nIn respect of borrowers enjoying export credit limit, the bifurcation of the working capital limit into loan and \ncash credit components, would be effected after excluding the export credit limits (pre-shipment and post-shipment). \n3.8 Bills Limit  \n3.8.1 Bills limit for inland sales may be fully carved out of the 'loan component'. Bills limit also includes \nlimits for purchase of third party (outstation) cheques / bank drafts. Banks must satisfy themselves that \nthe bills limit is not mis -utilised.  \n3.8.2 UCBs may lay do wn policy guidelines for periodic review of the working capital limit and the same \nmay be scrupulously adhered to. \n4. Credit Administration \n4.1 Rate of Interest  \nUCBs are permitted to determine their lending rates taking into account their cost of funds, transaction \ncosts etc . with the approval of their Board. However, banks are advised to ensure that the interest rates \ncharged by them are transparent and known to all customers. Banks are also required to publish the minimum and maximum interest rates charged on advances and display the information in every branch. Though interest rates have been deregulated, rates of interest beyond a certain level may be seen to be usurious and can neither be sustainable nor be conforming to normal banking practice. Boards of banks have to lay down appropriate internal principles and procedures in this regard. In laying down such  \n5 \n principles and procedures in respect of small value loans, particularly, personal loans and such other \nloans of similar nature, banks may take into account, inter -alia, the following broad guidelines:  \n(i) An appropriate prior -approval process should be prescribed for sanctioning such loans, which \nshould take into account, among others, the cash flows of the prospective borrower. \n(ii) Interest rates charged by banks, inter -alia, should incorporate risk premium as considered \nreasonable and justified having regard to the internal rating of the borrower. Further, in considering \nthe question of risk, the presence or absence of security and the value thereof shoul d be taken \ninto account. \n(iii) The total cost to the borrower, including interest and all other charges levied on a loan, should be justifiable having regard to the total cost incurred by the bank in extending the loan, which is sought to be defrayed and the extent of return that could be reasonably expected from the transaction.  \n(iv) In the case of loans to borrowers under priority sector, no penal interest should be charged for \nloans up to \u20b925,000. Penal interest may be levied for reasons such as default in repayment, non-\nsubmission of financial statements, etc. However, the policy on penal interest should be governed \nby well -accepted principles of transparency, fairness, incentive to service the debt and due regard \nto genuine difficulties of customers.  \n(v) Banks should ensure that the total interest debited to an account should not exceed the principal \namount in respect of short term advances granted to small and marginal farmers. The small and \nmarginal farmers for the purpose shall include those with land holding of 5 acres and less.  \n(vi) An appropriate ceiling may be fixed on the interest, including processing and other charges that \ncould be levied on such loans, which may be suitably publicised. \n(vii) Foreclosure Charges / Prepayment Penalty  - With effect from June 26, 2014,  it has been decided \nthat UCBs will not be permitted to charge foreclosure charges / prepayment penalties on all floating \nrate term loans sanctioned to individual borrowers. \n4.2 No Objection Certificate \n UCBs should not finance a borrower already availing credi t facility from another bank without obtaining a \n'No Objection Certificate' from the existing financing bank.  \n4.3 Opening of Current Accounts  \n4.3.1 Keeping in view the importance of credit discipline, at the time of opening of current accounts, banks \nshoul d: \n(i) insist on a declaration from the account holder to the effect that he is not enjoying any credit facility \nwith any other commercial bank or obtain a declaration giving particulars of credit facilities enjoyed \nby him with any other commercial bank/s.  \n(ii) ascertain whether he / she is a member of any other co-operative society / bank; if so, the full \ndetails thereof such as name of the society / bank, number of shares held, details of credit facilities, \nsuch as nature, quantum, outstanding, due dates etc . shou ld be obtained. \n4.3.2 In case t he borrower  is already enjoying any credit facility from any other commercial / co-operative \nbank, the bank opening a current account should duly inform the lending bank(s) concerned and also \nspecifically insist on obtaining a \"No Objection Certificate\" from them. In case of a prospective customer \nwho is a corporate or large borrower enjoying credit facilities from more than one bank, the banks may inform the consortium leader, if under consortium, and the banks concerned, if under multiple banking \narrangement. In cas e a facility has been availed from a co-operative bank / society, it is essential for the \nbank to comply with the requirements of the Co-operative Societies Act / Rules of the state concerned in \nregard to membership and borrowings. \n4.3.3 Banks may open current accounts of prospective customers in case no response is received from \nthe existing bankers after a minimum waiting period of a fortnight. If a response is received within a \nfortnight, banks should assess the situation with reference to information provided on the prospective \ncustomer by the bank concerned and are not required to solicit a formal no objection, consistent with true \nfreedom to the customer of banks as well as needed due diligence on the customer by the bank. \n  \n6 \n 4.4 Certification of Accounts of Non-Corporate Borrowers by Chartered Accountants  \nAs per the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing of audited balance sheet and Profit & Loss Account is mandatory \nfor certain types of non-corporate entities. Therefore, the banks must ins ist on the audited financial \nstatements from the borrowers enjoying large limits; since such borrowers would, in any case, be submitting audit certificate to the income-tax authorities, based on audit of their books of accounts by a \nChartered Accountant.  \n4.5 Defaults in Payment of Statutory Dues by Borrowers  \nUCBs may ensure that borrowers enjoying credit facilities, pay the provident fund payments and similar \nother statutory dues promptly. The non-payment of statutory dues by the borrowers is one of the \nsymptoms of incipient sickness of an industrial unit. Therefore, it is in the interest of both the lender and \nborrower to give high priority to the clearance of these dues. Apart from insisting on the borrowers to indicate a definite programme for clearance of arrears, banks may consider suitable restrictions on the \noutflow of funds. UCBs may incorporate an appropriate declaration in their application forms for grant / \nrenewal / enhancement of credit facilities so as to ensure that the position regarding the s tatutory dues is \ndisclosed therein. In respect of the corporate borrowers and non-corporate borrowers, the amount of \nstatutory dues should normally be reflected in their audited annual accounts. In case audited accounts do \nnot indicate the position clearly , a certificate may be obtained from the Chartered Accountant for this \npurpose.  \n4.6 Sanction of Advances  \n4.6.1 Irregularities / Deficiencies in Credit Sanction \nBanks should take suitable precautions to avoid irregular practices such as sanctioning advances  beyond \ndiscretionary powers and / or without proper credit appraisal in order to minimise chances of frauds. \n4.6.2 Delegation of Powers  \n(i) The Board of Directors should delegate specific powers to the Branch Managers and other \nfunctionaries at the Head Office level as also to the Chairman in the matter of sanction of advances \nand expenditure. A system should also be introduced to ensure that powers are exercised within the limits prescribed and any transgressions are immediately reported to Head Office. \n(ii) The internal inspectors should examine during the course of inspection of branches whether powers have been exercised properly and any unauthorised exercise of powers should \nimmediately be brought to the notice of Head Office. Similarly, sanctions beyond discretionary \npowers by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and other executives at the Head Office should \nalso be reported to the Board of Directors.  \n4.6.3 Oral Sanction  \nThe higher authorities at various levels should desist from the unhealthy practice o f conveying sanction \nof advances orally or on telephone.  \n4.6.4 Proper Record of Deviations  \n4.6.4.1 Only in exigencies, where sanctions are made on telephone / oral instructions of higher \nfunctionaries or sanctions beyond discretionary powers have to be res orted to, the following steps should \nbe taken:  \n(i) Record of such instructions / sanctions should be maintained by the sanctioning / disbursing \nauthorities explaining the circumstances under which sanctions were made. \n(ii) Written confirmation of the competent sanc tioning authority should be obtained by the disbursing \nauthority / official within a week / fortnight.  \n(iii) Sanctions within discretionary powers should also be reported to Head Office within a stipulated time and Head Office should meticulously follow up recei pt of such returns.  \n7 \n (iv) Head Office should diligently scrutinise the statements / returns and should initiate stringent ac tion \nagainst erring functionary (s) if he is / they are / found to have indulged in unauthorised sanctioning. \n4.6.4.2 Officials should exer cise powers delegated to them judiciously and should not exceed their \ndiscretionary powers for granting loans and advances. Violations, if any, in this regard should be viewed \nseriously and the guilty should be punished suitably. \n4.7 Monitoring Operations in Loan Accounts  \n4.7.1 Post-Sanction Monitoring  \n4.7.1.1 It is the primary responsibility of banks to be vigilant and ensure proper end use of bank funds / \nmonitor the funds flow. It is, therefore, necessary for banks to evolve such arrangements as may be \nconsidered necessary to ensure that drawals from cash credit / overdraft accounts are strictly for the \npurpose for which the credit limits are sanctioned by them.  \n4.7.1.2  Post sanction follow -up of loans and advances should be effective so as to ensure that the security \nobtained from borrowers by way of hypothecation, pledge, etc. are not tampered with in any manner and \nare adequate. \n4.7.1.3 Accounts showing sign of turning into NPAs  \nBanks may put in place more stringent safeguards, especially where accounts show  sign of turning into \nNPAs. In such cases banks may strengthen their monitoring system by resorting to more frequent \ninspections of borrowers' godowns, ensuring that sale proceeds are routed through the borrower's \naccounts maintained with the bank a nd insisting on pledge of the stock in place of hypothecation.  \n4.7.1.4 Drawals against clearing cheques should be sanctioned only in respect of first class customers \nand even in such cases the extent of limits and the need therefore should be subjected to thorough \nscrutiny and periodic review. Banks should not issue banker's cheques / pay orders / demand drafts \nagainst instruments presented for clearing, (unless the proceeds thereof are collected and credited to the \naccount of the party) or to borrowers whose accounts are already overdrawn or likely to be overdrawn \nwith the issue of such instruments. \n4.7.1.5  Drawals against clearing instruments should be normally confined to bank drafts and Government \ncheques and only to a limited extent against third party  cheques. \n4.7.1.6 Cheques against which drawals are allowed, should represent genuine trade transactions and \nstrict vigilance should be observed against assisting kite-flying operations. \n4.7.2 Responsibility  \n4.7.2.1 The primary responsibility for preventing misuse of funds rests with the management of banks. \nUCBs should, therefore, take appropriate steps to review and tighten their internal administration and \ncontrol measures so as to eliminate the scope for misuse / diversion of funds and malpractices.  \n4.7.2.2 Banks should take serious view of instances of misuse of power, corruption and other malpractices \nindulged by the members of staff and erring staff members should be given punishments befitting the \nseriousness of the irregularity. Quick disposal of enquiries by the banks and award of deterrent \npunishment would be necessary in all such cases. \n4.8 Annual Review of Advances  \nFor an effective monitoring of the advances, it is imperative for the banks to undertake an exercise for \nreview of the advances on a regular basis. Apart from the usual objective of such a review of assessing \nthe quality of operation, safety of funds, etc. the review should specifically attempt to make an assessment \nof the working capital requirements of the borrower based on the latest data available, whether limits \ncontinue to be within the need-based requirements and according to the bank's prescribed lending norms.   \n8 \n 4.9 Valuation of properties -empanelment of valuers  \nThe issue of correct and realistic valuation of fixed assets  owned by banks and that accepted by them as \ncollateral for a sizable portion of their advances portfolio assumes significance in view of its implications \nfor correct measurement of capital adequacy position of banks. UCBs are, therefore, advised to put in  \nplace a system / procedure for realistic valuation of fixed assets and also for empanelment of valuers for \nthe purpose as per guidelines given at Annex -1. \n4.10 Diversion of Funds  \nUCBs should have a mechanism for proper monitoring of the end use of funds. Wherever diversion is \nobserved, they should take appropriate action including recalling the loans, reduction of sanctioned limits, charging penal interest etc. to protect the bank's interest. UCBs should keep a proper vigil ov er requests \nof their clients for cash withdrawals from their accounts for large amounts. Whenever stocks under hypothecation to cash credit and other loan accounts are found to have been sold but the proceeds thereof not credited to the loan account, such action should normally be treated as a fraud. In such cases, banks may take immediate steps to secure the remaining stock so as to prevent further erosion in the value of \nthe available security as also other action as warranted. \n4.11 Diversion of funds would be construed to include any one of the under -noted occurrences:  \n(i) U tilisation of short-term working capital funds for long-term purposes not in conformity with the \nterms of sanctions;  \n(ii) deploying borrowed funds for purposes / activities or creation of assets other than those for which \nthe loan was sanctioned; \n(iii) transferring funds to the subsidiaries / group companies or other corporates by whatever \nmodalities;  \n(iv) routing of funds through any bank other than the lender bank or members of consortium without prior permission of the lender; \n(v) investment in other companies by way of acquiring equities / debt instruments without approval of \nlenders;  \n(vi) shortfall in deployment of funds vis-\u00e0-vis  the amounts disbursed / drawn, and the difference not \nbeing accounted for. \n4.12 Siphoning of funds should be construed to have occurred if any funds borrowed are utilised for \npurposes unrelated to the operations of the borrower, to the detriment of the financial health of the entity or of the lender. The decision as to whether a particular instance amounts to siphoning of funds would \nhave to be a judgement of the lenders based on objective facts and circumstances of the case.  \n4.13 End-use of Funds  \nIn cases of project financing, banks should seek to ensure end use of funds by, inter alia, obtaining \ncertification from the Chartered Accountants for the purpose. In case of short-term corporate / clean loans, such an approach ought to be supplemented by 'due diligence' on the part of lenders themselves, and to \nthe extent possible, such loans should be limited to only those borrowers whose integrity and reliability \nwere above board. UCBs, therefore, should not depend entirely on the certificates issued by the Chartered Accountants but strengthen their internal controls and the credit risk management system to enhance the quality of their loan portfolio. Needless to say, ensuring end-use of funds by banks should form a part of \ntheir loan policy document for which appropriate measures should be put in place.  \n4.14 The following are the illustrative measures that could be taken by the lenders for monitoring and ensuring end-use of funds: \n(i) Meaningful scrutiny of quarterly progress reports / operating statements / balance sheets of the \nborrowers; \n(ii) Regular inspection of borrowers' assets charged to the lenders as security; \n(iii) Periodic scrutiny of borrowers' books of accounts and the no -lien accounts maintained with other \nbanks;  \n(iv) Periodic visits to the assisted units;   \n9 \n (v) System of periodical stock audit, in case of working capital finance;  \n(vi) Periodic comprehensive management audit of the 'Credit' function of the lenders, so as to identify \nthe systemic weaknesses in the credit-administration. \n5. Exchange of Credit Information \n5.1 Membership of Credit Information Companies (CICs)  \n5.1.1 With effect from January 29, 2015, it has been decided to mandate all UCBs to become member/s \nof all CICs and moderate the membership and annual fees suitably. In this regard, UCBs have been \nadvised to comply with the directive DBR.No.CID.BC.59/20.16.056/2014 -15 dated January 15, 2015  and \nbecome member of all CICs and submit data (including historical data) to them. \n5.1.2 Data Format for furnishing of credit information to CICs and other Regulatory measures  \nIt has been decided to implement with modifications , certain recommendations of the Committee to \nRecommend Data Format for furnishing of Credit Information to CICs (Chairman: Shri. Aditya Pur i) as \ngiven in Annex -2.  Further, in view of the Resolution Framework for COVID -19 related stress, Uniform \nCredit Reporting Format for Consumer Bureau and Commercial Bureau, as contained in Appendix -A (of \nAnnex -2) has been modified vide DoR.FIN.REC.46/20.16.056/2020-21 dated March 12, 2021 , as under: \n(i) Consumer Bureau: The label  of the field \u2018Written off and Settled status\u2019 is modified as \u2018Credit Facility \nStatus\u2019 and it will also have a new catalogue value, viz., \u2018Restructured due to COVID -19\u2019. \n(ii) Commercial Bureau: The existing field \u2018Major reasons for restructuring\u2019 will have a new catalogue \nvalue, viz., \u2018Restructured due to COVID -19\u2019. \nCases admitted with National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)/National Company Law Appellate Tribunal \n(NCLAT) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 are also required to be reported to CICs under \nthe suit-filed cases.  \n5.1.3 Credit information reporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) members  \nUCBs shall be guided by instructions contained in the circular D C BR.BPD.Cir.No.17/16.74.000/2015-16 \ndated May 26, 2016  on the matter. The instructions are also given as Annex -3 of this circular for ready \nreference.  \n5.2 Exchange of information - Lending under Consortium Arrangement / Multiple Banking Arrangements  \n5.2.1 UCBs need to strengthen their information back -up about the borrowers enjoying credit facilities \nfrom multiple banks.  \n(i) At the time of granting fresh facilities, banks may obtain declaration from the borrowers about the credit facilities already enjoyed by them from other banks. In the case of existing lenders, all the banks may seek a declaration from their existing borrow ers availing sanctioned limits of \u20b95 crore and above \nor wherever, it is in their knowledge that their borrowers are availing credit facilities from other banks, and introduce a system of exchange of information with other banks as indicated above.  \n(ii) Subsequently, banks should exchange information about the conduct of the borrowers' accounts with other banks at least at quarterly intervals. \n(iii) Obtain regular certification by a professional, preferably a Company Secretary / Cost Accountant / Chartered Accountant regarding compliance of various statutory prescriptions that are in vogue. \n(iv) Make greater use of credit reports available from Credit Information Companies [Credit Information \nBureau (India) Limited (CIBIL), M/s Experian Credit Information Company of India Private Ltd., Equifax \nCredit Information Services Pvt. Ltd. and High Mark Credit Information Services Pvt. Ltd.]. \n(v) The banks should incorporate suitable clauses in the loan agreements in future (at the time of next renewal in the case of existing facilities) regarding exchange of credit information so as to address \nconfidentiality issues.   \n10 \n 5.2.2 Setting up of Central Electronic Registry under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial \nAssets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 \nGove rnment of India has set up the Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security \nInterest of India (CERSAI) under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, with the objective of \npreventing frauds in loan s involving multiple lending from different banks on the same immovable property. \nUCBs, accordingly were advised vide circular U BD.BPD.(PCB) Cir No. 27/13.04.002/2012-13 dated \nDecember 14, 2012  to v oluntarily file with CERSAI, in their own interest, records of equitable mortgages \ncreated by them. Pursuant to this, Government issued a Gazette Notification dated January 22, 2016 for \nfiling of the following types of security interest on the CERSAI portal:  \n(i) Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in immovable property by \nmortgage other than mortgage by deposit of title deeds. \n(ii) Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in hypothecation of p lant and \nmachinery, stocks, debts including book debts or receivables, whether existing or future. \n(iii) Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in intangible assets, being know \nhow, patent, copyright, trademark, licence, franchise or any other business or commercial right of \nsimilar nature. \n(iv) Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in any \u2018under construction\u2019 \nresidential or commercial or a part thereof by an agreement or instrument other than mortgage. \nIn this regard, instructions on Filing of Security Interest relating to Immovable (other than equitable \nmortgage), Movable and Intangible Assets in CERSAI, issued vide circular \nDBR.Leg.No.BC.15/09.08.020/2018 -19 dated December 27, 2018  have been made applicable to UCBs. \nAccordingly, UCBs were advised to complete filing the charges pertaining to subsisting transactions with \nCERSAI by March 31, 2019. It has also been advised to file the charges relating to all current transactions \nwith CERSAI on an ongoing basis   \n5.3 Disclosure of Information and Monitoring of Defaulting Borrowers  \n5.3.1 Scheduled UCBs are required to submit to the Reserve Bank of India as at the end of September \nand March every year, the details of the borrowal accounts which have been classified as doubtful, loss or suit filed with outstanding (both under funded and non-funded limits) aggregating \u20b91 crore and above \nas per the format given in Annex -4\n. \n5.3.2 The Reserve Bank of India is circulating to the banks and financial institutions the information on the \ndefaulters (i.e., advances classified as doubtful and loss). The banks and financial institutions may make use of the information while considering the merits of the requests for new or additional credit limits by \nexisting and new constituents.  \n5.3.3 All UCBs are required to submit the quarterly list of suit filed accounts of \u20b91 crore and above, \nclassified as doubtful or loss, to CIBIL and / or any other credit information company which has obtained \nCertificate of Registration ( CoR) from RBI and of which the UCB is a member.  \n5.3.4 All UCBs are required to submit the list of suit filed accounts of wilful defaulters of \u20b925 lakh and \nabove as at the end of quarter March, June, September and December to CIBIL and / or any other credit \ninformation company which has obtained CoR from RBI and of which the UCB is a member.  \n5.3.5 The data on borrowal accounts against which suits have been filed for recovery of advances \n(outstanding aggregating \u20b91 crore and above) and suit filed accounts of wilful defaulters with outstanding balance of \u20b925 lakh and above, based on information furnished by scheduled commercial banks and \nfinancial insti tutions is available at www.cibil.com\n. \n5.3.6 UCBs can verify the lists to ensure that the defaulting borrowing units as also their proprietors / \npartners / directors etc. named in the list of suit-filed accounts, either in their own names or in the names of other units with which they are associated, are not extended further credit facilities.  \n11 \n 5.3.7 The banks may make enquiry, if any, about the defaulters from the reporting bank / financial \ninstitution.  \n5.4 Collection and dissemination of information on cases of wilful default of \u20b925 lakh and above \n5.4.1 Scheduled UCBs are required to report on a quarterly basis, all cases of wilful defaults, which \noccurred, or are detected after March 31, 1999 in the proforma given in Annex -4. All non-performing \nborrowal accounts with outstanding (funded facilities and such non-funded facilities which are converted \ninto funded facilities) aggregating to \u20b9 25 lakh and above are to be reported. \n5.4.2 A wilful default would be deemed to have occurred if any of the following events is noted: \n(i) The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligations to the lender even when it has \nthe capacity to honour the said obligation.  \n(ii) The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligation to the lender and has not utilized the finance from the lender for the specific purposes for which finance was availed of but has diverted \nthe funds for other purposes.  \n(iii) The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligations to the lender and has siphoned \noff the fund so that the funds have not been utilized for the specific purpose for which finance was \navailed of, nor are the funds available with the unit in the form of other assets.  \n(iv) The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligation to the lender and has also disposed of or removed the movable fixed assets or immovable property given by it for the purpose of securing a term loan, without the knowledge of the bank / lender. \n5.4.3 Cut-off limits  \nWhile the penal measures would normally be attracted by all the borrowers identified as wilful defaulters \nor the promoters involved in diversion / siphoning of funds, keeping in view the present limit of \u20b925 lakh \nfixed by the Central Vigilance Commission for reporting of cases of wilful default by scheduled banks to \nReserve Bank of India, any wilful defaulter w ith an outstanding balance of \u20b925 lakh or more would attract \nthe penal measures stipulated in the paragraph below. The limit of \u20b925 lakh may also be applied for the \npurpose of taking cognisance of the instances of 'siphoning' / 'diversion' of funds.  \n5.4.4 Penal measures  \nIn order to prevent access to the capital markets by the wilful defaulters, a copy of the list of wilful defaulters is forwarded by Reserve Bank of India to Securities and Exchange Board of India as well. It \nhas also been decided that the following measures should be initiated by scheduled UCBs against the wilful defaulters: \n(i) No additional facilities be granted to the listed wilful defaulters. In addition, the entrepreneurs / \npromoters of companies where banks have identified siphoning / diversion of funds, misrepresentation, \nfalsification of accounts and fraudulent transactions should be debarred from institutional finance for floating new ventures for a period of 5 years from the date the name of the wilful defaulter is published in \nthe list of wilful defaulters by the Reserve Bank of India.  \n(ii) The legal process, where warranted, against the borrowers / guarantors and foreclosure of loans \nshould be initiated expeditiously. The lenders may also initiate criminal proceedings against wilful defaulters, wherever necessary. \n(iii) Wherever possible, the banks should adopt a proactive approach for a change of Management of th e \nwilfully defaulting borrower unit. It would be imperative on the part of the banks to put in place a transparent \nmechanism for the entire process so that the penal provisions are not misused and the scope of such \ndiscretionary powers is kept to the barest minimum. It should be ensured that a solitary or isolated instance \nis not made the basis for imposing penal measures. \n  \n12 \n 5.4.5 Treatment of Group \nWhile dealing with wilful default of a single borrowing company in a group, the banks should consider the \ntrack record of the individual company, with reference to its repayment performance to its lenders. However, in cases where a letter of comfort and / or the guarantees furnished by the companies within the group on behalf of the wilfully defaulting units are not honoured when invoked by scheduled banks, \nsuch group companies should also be reckoned as wilful defaulters.  \n5.4.6 Role of Auditors  \n5.4.6.1 In case any falsification of accounts on the part of the borrowers is observed by banks, they should \nlodge a formal complaint against the auditors of the borrowers, with Institute of Chartered Accountant of \nIndia (ICAI) if it is observed that the auditors were negligent or deficient in conducting the audit to enable the ICAI to examine and fix accountability of the auditors.  \n5.4.6.2 With a view to monitoring the end-use of funds, if the lenders desire a specific certification from \nborrowers' auditors regarding diversion / siphoning of funds by the borrower, the lender should award a separate mandate to the auditor s for the purpose. To facilitate such certification by the auditors scheduled \nUCBs will also need to ensure that appropriate covenants in the loan agreements are incorporated to \nenable award of such a mandate by the lenders to the borrowers / auditors. \n5.4.7 Filing of Suits to Recover Dues from Wilful Defaulters   \nScheduled UCBs should examine al l cases of wilful defaults of \u20b91 crore and above and file suits in such \ncases UCBs should also examine whether in such cases of wilful defaults, there are instances of cheating \n/ fraud by the defaulting borrowers and if so, they should also file criminal cases against those borrowers. In other cases involving amounts below \u20b91 crore, banks should take appropriate action, including legal \naction, against the defaulting borrowers. \n6. Prudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances \n6.1 General Principles  \nThe basic objective of restructuring is to preserve economic value of units and not evergreening of problem \naccounts. This can be achieved by banks and the borrowers by careful assessment of the viability, quick detection of weaknesses in accounts and a time-bound implementation of restructuring packages. The \nprudential guidelines will be applicable to all categories of debt restructuring other than those restructured \non account of natural calamities, which will continue to be governed by the extant guidelines. The principles and prudential norms laid down are applicable to all advances , including borrowers who are \neligible for special regulatory treatment for asset classification as detailed in the prudential guideline on \nrestructuring of advances in Master Circular- Income Recognition, Asset Classification, Provisioning and \nOther Related Matters \u2013 UCBs dated April 1 , 2021, as amended from time to time. The revised definition \nof micro, s mall and m edium enterprises has been given in Annex-5\n1.  \n6.2. Eligibility Criteria for Restructuring of Advances  \n6.2.1 Banks  may restructure the accounts classified under 'standard', 'sub-standard' and 'doubtful' \ncategories.  \n6.2.2 Banks cannot reschedule / restructure / renegotiate borrowal accounts with retrospective effect. \nWhile a restructuring proposal is under consideration, the usual asset classification norms would continue to apply. The process of re-classification of an asset should not stop merely because restructuring proposal is under consideration. The asset classification status as on the date of approval of the restructured package by the competent authority would be relevant to decide the asset classification \n                                                            \n1 Government of India (GoI),  Gazette Notification S.O. 2119 (E) dated June 26, 2020 and RBI circular FIDD.MSME & \nNFS.BC.No.3/06.02.31/2020-21 dated July 2, 2020  may be referred. \n  \n13 \n status of the account after restructuring / rescheduling / renegotiation. In case there is undue delay in \nsanctioning a restructuring package and in the meantime the asset classification status of the account \nundergoes deterioration, it would be a matter of supervisory concer n. \n6.2.3 Normally, restructuring cannot take place unless alteration / changes in the original loan agreement \nare made with the formal consent / application of the debtor. However, the process of restructuring can \nbe initiated by the bank in deserving cases subject to customer agreeing to the terms and conditions. \n6.2.4 No account will be taken up for restructuring by the banks unless the financial viability is established \nand there is a reasonable certainty of repayment from the borrower, as per the terms of restructuring package. The viability should be determined by the banks based on the acceptable viability benchmarks \ndetermined by them, which may be applied on a case-by -case basis, depending on merits of each case. \nIllustratively, the parameters may include the Return on Capital Employed, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, \nGap between the Internal Rate of Return and Cost of Funds and the amount of provision required in lieu of the diminution in the fair value of the restructured advance. The accounts not considered viable should not be restructured and banks should accelerate the recovery measures in respect of such accounts. Any \nrestructuring done without looking into cash flows of the borrower and assessing the viability of the projects \n/ activity financed by banks would be treated as an attempt at ever greening a weak credit facility and \nwould invite supervisory concerns / action.  \n6.2.5 The borrowers indulging in frauds and malfeasance will continue to remain ineligible for restructuring. \n6.3 Compromise settlements and technical write-offs  \nUCBs  shall adhere to the instructions contained in the \ncircular DOR.STR.REC.20/21.04.048/2023-24 \ndated June 8, 2023  r egarding framework for compromise settlements and technical write-offs.  \n7. Specific Lending Activities \n7.1 Bridge Loans / Interim Finance 7.1.1 The grant of bridge loan / interim finance by UCBs to any company (including finance companies) \nis totally prohibited.  \n7.1.2 The ban on sanction of bridge loans / interim finance is also applicable in respect of Euro issues.  \n7.1.3 The banks should not circumvent these instructions by purport and / or intent by sanction of credit \nunder a different nomenclature like unsecured negotiable notes, floating rate interest bonds, etc. as also \nshort-term loans, the repayment of which is proposed / expected to be made out of funds to be or likely to be mobilised from external / other sources and not out of the surplus generated by the use of the \nasset(s). \n7.1.4 If any bank has sanctioned and disbursed any bridge loan / interim finance, it should report the same \nto the Regional Office concerned of the Urban Banks Department with full particulars and certifying that the loans are utilised strictly for the purpose for which the public issue and / or market borrowing was intended. Thereafter, the banks concerned should immediately take steps to ensure timely repayment of \nsuch bridge loans / interim finance already sanctioned and disbursed and under no circumstances, should \nthe banks allow extension of time for repayment of existing bridge loans / interim finance. \n7.1.5 These instructions are issued by the Reserve Bank of India in exercise of powers conferred by the \nSections 21 and 35A read with section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. \n7.2 Advances to Real Estate and Commercial Real Estate Sector  \nUCBs should frame comprehensive prudential norms relating to the ceiling on the total amount of real \nestate loans, single / aggregate exposure limit for such loans, margins, security, repayment schedule and availability of supplementary finance taking into account guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India and  \n14 \n the policy should be approved by the banks' Board. Exposure to builders and contractors for commercial \nreal estate will include fund based and non-fund based exposures secured by mortgages on commercial real estates (office buildings, retail space, multi -purpose commercial premises, multi -family residential \nbuildings, multi -tenanted commercial premises, industrial or warehouse space, hotels etc). Further, while \nframing the policy, the banks may also consider for inclusion the National Building Code framed by Bureau \nof Indian Standards (BIS). For detailed information the website of Bureau of Indian Standards \n(www.bis.gov.in\n) can be accessed.  \n7.3 Financing of Leasing / Hire Purchase Companies  \n7.3.1 Enrolment of Financial Companies as Members  \n7.3.1.1 UCBs are normally not expected to enrol  non-banking financial institutions like investment and \nfinancial companies as their members since it would be in contravention of the State Co-operative \nSocieties Act concerned and will also not be in conformity with the provisions of model bye-law No.9 \nrecommended for adoption, by all banks.  \n7.3.1.2 Therefore, the UCBs are not permitted to finance non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), other \nthan those engaged in hire purchase / leasing.  \n7.3.2 Norms for financing  \n7.3.2.1  As in the case of finance and investment companies, admission of NBFCs which are not engaged \nexclusively in leasing / hire purchase business as members may be contrary to the provisions contained \nin the State Co-operative Societies Act concerned and model bye-law No.9 referred to above. It will, therefore, be necessary for banks to obtain prior approval of the Registrar of Co- operative Societies \nconcerned before admitting them as members.  \n7.3.2.2  Even financing the Companies involved in l easing and hire purchase business  by UCBs on a \nlarge scale is not favoured by the Reserve Bank of India, since the banks are basically required to cater to the credit needs of the people of small means. \n7.3.2.3  Presently banks with working capital funds aggregating to \u20b925 crore and above only are perm itted \nto take up the financing of Companies involved in l easing and hire purchase business  and that too, only \nin consortium with other scheduled commercial banks. The banks should observe the following norms, \nwhile financing such companies: \n(i) The level of finance to Companies involved in leasing and hire purchase business  depends on the net \nowned funds of the companies, subject to the overall ceiling on their borrowings upto ten times of their \nowned funds. \n(ii) Bank credit to companies engaged in equipment leasing and hire purchases (i.e., at least 75 per cent \nof assets are in equipment leasing / hire purchase and 75 per cent of their gross income is derived \nfrom these two types of activities as per their last audited balance sheet) may be extended within the \nceiling of three times of the net owned funds within the overall ceiling of their borrowings upto ten times of net owned funds. \n(iii) In the case of other equipment leasing / hire purchases companies (i.e. , companies whose assets in \nequipment leasing / hire purchase business are less than 75 per cent and whose gross income derived \nfrom these two types of activities as per the last audited balance sheet is less than 75 per cent of its gross income), the credit limit has to be within two times of their net owned funds from the present \nlevel of four times. \n7.4 Working Capital Finance to Information Technology and Software Industry  \n7.4.1 In order to bring about uniformity in approach, Reserve Bank of India has formulated guidelines for \ninformation of banks, on various aspects of lending to information technology and software industry to facilitate free flow of credit. The same were enclosed to our circular UBD.No. DS.SUB.No.4/13.05.00/98-\n99 dated 5 October 1998, addressed to scheduled UCBs. Banks are, however, free to modify the  \n15 \n guidelines based on their own experience without reference to Reserve Bank of India to achieve the \npurpose of the guidelines in letter and spirit.  \n7.4.2 These guidelines have been framed based on the recommendations made by the study group \nappointed by Reserve Bank of India to study the modalities of credit extension to software industry as also taking into account the suggestions made by the industry associations. \n7.4.3 UCBs may take adequate steps to develop expertise in this area by  training staff in project appraisal \nin the area of activity. It has to be ensured that the staff concerned is well aware of the requirements of \nthe industry and remain in tune with the latest developments so that the higher standards of project appraisal can be maintained before extending the working capital finance to Information Technology and \nsoftware industries.  \n7.5 Advances against pledge of Gold / Silver Ornaments  \n7.5.1 In order to mitigate the inherent risks attached to sanction of loans and advances against gold / silver ornaments, UCBs are advised to observe the safeguards as detailed in Annex -6\n. \n7.5.2 Bullet Repayment \nWith effect from October 30, 2014 the quantum of loans against gold ornaments that could be granted under the bullet repayment scheme with the approval of their bank\u2019s  Board has been enhanced from \u20b91 \nlakh to \u20b92 lakh subject to the following guidelines: \n(i) The amount of loan sanctioned should not exceed \u20b92 lakh at any point of time. \n(ii) The period of the loan shall not exceed 12 months from the date of sanction.  \n(iii) Interest will be charged to the account at monthly rests but will become due for payment along with \nprincipal only at the end of 12 months from the date of sanction. \n(iv) Banks should maintain a Loan to Value (LTV) ratio of 75% on the outstanding amount of loan including \nthe interest on an ongoing basis, failing which the loan will be treated as Non Performing Asset (NPA).  \n(v) Such loans shall be governed by the extant income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms which shall be applicable once the principal and interest become overdue. \n7.5.3 Crop loans sanctioned against the collateral security of gold ornaments shall continue to be \ngoverned by the extant income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms for such loans.  \n7.5.4 Hallmarking of gold jewellery ensures the quality of gold used in the jewellery as to caratage, \nfineness and purity. Banks would find granting of advances against the security of such hallmarked \njewellery safer and easier. Preferential treatment of hallmarked jewellery is likely to encourage practice of \nhallmarking which will be in the long-term interest of consumers, lenders and the industry. Therefore, banks while considering granting advances against jewellery may keep in view the advantages of \nhallmarked jewellery and decide on the margin and rates of interest thereon. \n7.5.5 In view of the concerns arising out of the significant rise in import of gold in recent years, UCBs were \nadvised not to grant any advance for purchase of gold in any form, including primary gold, gold bullion, \ngold jewellery, gold coins, units of gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) and units of gold Mutual Funds. \n7.5.6 As a prudential measure, it has been decided to  prescribe a Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio of not \nexceeding 75 per cent for UCBs\u2019 lending against gold jewellery (including bullet repayment loans against \npledge of gold jewellery). Further, in order to standardize the valuation and make it more transparent to  \nthe borrower, it has been decided that gold jewellery accepted as security/collateral will have to be valued at the average of the closing price of 22 carat gold for the preceding 30 days as quoted by the India Bullion \nand Jewellers Association Ltd. [Formerly known as the Bombay Bullion Association Ltd. (BBA)]. In terms \nof circular DCBR.BPD. (PCB/RCB). Cir. No. 3/13.05.001/2015-16 dated October 15, 2015 , UCBs may  \n16 \n also use the historical spot gold price data of the preceding 30 days publicly disseminated by a Commodity \nExchange regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. If the gold is of purity less than 22 \ncarats, the bank should translate the collateral into 22 carat and value the exact grams of the collateral. \nIn other words, jewellery of lower purity of gold shall be valued proportionately. \n7.6 Grant of Loans for Acquisition of / Investing in Small Savings Instruments including Kisan Vikas Patras \n(KVP) \nGrant of loans for acquiring / investing in KVPs does not promote fresh savings and, rather, channelise \nthe existing savings in the form of bank deposits to small savings instruments and thereby defeat the very \npurpose of such schemes. Banks may therefore ensure that no loans are sanctioned for acquisition of / \ninvesting in small savings instruments including KVPs. \n7.7 Lending to Public Sector Undertakings \nUCBs are advised, as a matter of principle, generally not to grant large value loans to Public Sector / \nGovernment Undertakings. \n8. Discounting / Rediscounting of Bills by Banks \nUCBs may adhere to the following guidelines while purchasing / discounting / negotiating / rediscounting \nof genuine commercial / trade bills:  \n8.1 Since banks have already been given freedom to decide their own guidelines for assessing / sanctioning working capital limits of borrowers, they may sanction working capital limit as also bills limit to borrowers after proper appraisal of their credit needs and in accordance with the loan policy as approved \nby their Board of Directors. \n8.2 Banks should clearly lay down a bill discounting policy approved by their Board of Directors, which \nshould be consistent with their policy of sanctioning of working capital limits. In this case, the procedure \nfor Board approval should include banks' core operating process from the time the bills are tendered till these are realised. Banks may review their core operating processes and simplify the procedure in respect \nof bills financing. In order to address the problem of delay in realisation of bills, banks may take advantage \nof improved computer / communication network like Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS), \nwherever available, and adopt the system of 'value dating' of their clients' accounts.  \n8.3 Banks should open letters of credit (LCs) and purchase / discount / negotiate bills under LCs only in \nrespect of genuine commercial and trade transactions of their borrower constituents who have been \nsanctioned regular credit facilities by the banks. Banks should not, therefore, extend fund based (including bills financing) or non-fund based facilities like opening of LCs, providing guarantees and acceptances to \nnon-constituent borrower or / and non-constituent member of a consortium / multiple banking \narrangement. \n8.4 With effect from March 30, 2012, in case of bills drawn under LCs restricted to a particular UCB, and \nthe beneficiary of the LC is not a borrower who has been granted regular credit facility by that UCB, the UCB concerned may, as per their discretion and based on their perception about the credit worthiness of the LC issuing bank, negotiate such LCs, subject to the condition that the proceeds will be remitted to the regular banker of the beneficiary of the LC. However, the prohibition regarding negotiation of unrestricted LCs for borrowers who have not been sanctioned regular credit facilities will continue to be in force. \n8.5 UCBs negotiating bills as above, under restricted LCs, would have to adhere to the instructions of the \nReserve Bank / RCS or CRCS regarding share linking to borrowing and provisions of Co-operative \nSocieties Act on membership.  \n8.6 For the purpose of credit exposure, bills purchased / discounted / negotiated under LC (where the \npayment to the beneficiary is not made 'under  reserve') will be treated as an exposure on the LC issuing \nbank and not on the borrower. All clean negotiations as indicated above will be assigned the risk weight \nas is normally applicable to inter -bank exposures, for capital adequacy purposes. In the case of  \n17 \n negotiations 'under reserve' the exposure should be treated as on the borrower and risk weight assigned \naccordingly.  \n8.7 While purchasing / discounting / negotiating bills under LCs or otherwise, banks should establish \ngenuineness of underlying trans actions / documents.  \n8.8 Banks should ensure that blank LC forms are kept in safe custody as in case of security items like \nblank cheques, demand drafts etc. and verified / balanced on daily basis. LC forms should be issued to customers under joint signatures of the bank's authorised officials.  \n8.9 The practice of drawing bills of exchange claused 'without recourse' and issuing letters of credit \nbearing the legend 'without recourse' should be discouraged because such notations deprive the \nnegotiating bank of the right of recourse it has against the drawer under the Negotiable Instruments Act. \nBanks should not, therefore, open LCs and purchase / discount / negotiate bills bearing the 'without \nrecourse' clause.  \n8.10 Accommodation bills should not be purchased / discounted / negotiated by banks. The underlying \ntrade transactions should be clearly identified,  and a proper record thereof maintained at the branches \nconducting the bills business.  \n8.11 Banks should be circumspect while discounting bills drawn by front finance companies set up by \nlarge industrial groups on other group companies. \n8.12 Bills rediscounts should be restricted to usance bills held by other banks. Banks should not rediscount \nbills earlier discounted by NBFCs except in respect of bills arising from sale of light commercial vehicles \nand two / three wheelers. 8.13 Banks may exercise their commercial judgment in discounting of bills of services sector. However, \nwhile discounting such bills, banks should ensure that actual services are rendered, and accommodation \nbills are not discounted. Services sector bills should not be eligible for rediscounting. Further, providing \nfinance against discounting of services sector bills may be treated as unsecured advance and therefore, \nshould be within the limit s prescribed by Urban Banks Department for sanction of unsecured advances.  \n8.14 In order to promote payment discipline which would to a certain extent encourage acceptance of \nbills, all corporate and other constituent borrowers having turnover above threshold level as fixed by the \nbank's Board of Directors should be mandated to disclose 'aging schedule' of their overdue payables in \ntheir periodical returns submitted to banks.  \n8.15 Banks should not enter into Repo transactions using bills discounted / redisc ounted as collateral. \n8.16 Any violation of these instructions will be viewed seriously and invite penal action from Reserve Bank \nof India.  \n9. Loans to Self Help Groups (SHGs) / Joint Liability Groups (JLGs)  \nUCBs may lend to SHGs and JLGs as per their Boar d approved policy framed in this regard, according \nto the guidelines prescribed below: \n9.1 Lending Policy  \nLending to SHGs / JLGs would be considered as normal business activity of the bank. UCBs will be \nrequired to frame, with the approval of their Board, a comprehensive policy on lending to SHGs / JLGs. \nThis policy, including the maximum amount of loan, interest rate chargeable on loans etc. should form \npart of overall credit policy of the bank. \n \n  \n18 \n 9.2 Method of Lending  \nUCBs may follow the method of lending directly to SHGs / JLGs. Lending through intermediaries will not \nbe permitted. \n9.3 Enrolment of SHG / JLG as Member  \n9.3.1 SHGs are small groups, formal / informal, of individuals promoting savings habit among members. \nThese savings are then lent by the group to the members for income generating purposes. On the other \nhand, JLG is an informal group of individuals coming together for the purpose of availing of bank loan either singly or through the group mechanism against mutual guarantee in order to engage in similar type \nof economic activities.  \n9.3.2 The SHG would normally consist of 10 to 20 members whereas a JLG would normally have between \n4 and 10 members. Membership matters are governed by the byelaws adopted by the bank and provisions \nof respective State Co-operative Societies Acts or the Multi State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002. UCBs \nwould, therefore, be required to be guided by the provisions contained in the respective Act and take prior \napproval of the RCS / CRCS, wherever required, while enrolling such members and granting loans to \nSHGs / JLGs. The byelaws of UCBs also need to provide for such lending. \n9.4 Share Linking Norms  \nThe extant instructions on share linking to borrowing would apply for lending to SHGs / JLGs. \n9.5 Nature of Loan - Secured or Unsecured \nThe extant limits (individual and total) on grant of unsecured loans and advances will not apply to loans \ngranted to SHGs. However, loans granted by UCBs to JLGs, to the extent not backed by tangible security, \nwill be treated as unsecured and will be subject to the extant limits on unsecured loans and advances.  \n9.6 Nature of Exposure  \nIndividual or Group: Loans granted to SHGs / JLGs would be governed by the extant guidelines on \nindividual exposure limits. \n9.7 Amount of Loan \nThe maximum  amount of loan to SHGs should not exceed four times of the savings of the group. The limit \nmay be exceeded in case of well managed SHGs subject to a ceiling of ten times of savings of the group. \nThe groups may be rated on the basis of certain objective parameters such as proven track record, \nsavings pattern, recovery rate, housekeeping etc. JLGs are not obliged to keep deposits with the bank and hence the amount of loan granted to JLGs would be based on the credit needs of the JLG and the \nbank's assessment of the credit requirement. \n9.8 Margin and Security for the Loan \nMargin / security requirement will be as per Board approved policy of the UCB concerned. \n9.9 Documentation  \nUCBs may prescribe simple documentation for loans to be granted to SHGs / JLGs keeping in view the \npurpose of the loan and the status of the borrower. \n9.10 Priority Sector \nUCBs shall be guided by instructions contained at paras 8.1, 15.1, 15.2, 16.1 (v i) of the \nMaster Direction \nFIDD.CO.Plan.BC.5/04.09.01/2020-21 dated September 04, 2020 , amended from time to tim e.   \n19 \n 9.11 Opening of Savings Bank Account \nThe SHGs / JLGs would be eligible to open Savings Bank account with UCBs. \n9.12 KYC Norms  \nKYC verification of all the members of SHG need not be done while opening the savings bank account of \nthe SHG and KYC verification of all the office bearers would suffice. As regards KYC verification at the \ntime of credit linking of SHGs, as KYC would have already been verified while opening the savings bank \naccount and the account continues to be in operation and is to be used for credit linkage, no separate \nKYC verification of the members  or office bearers is necessary.  \n10 Revival of the Interest Tax Act 1974 - Collection from  Borrowers  \n10.1 The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its Judgment dated April 16, 2004 has ordered that excess interest \ncollected by the banks from the borrowers through rounding off the applicable interest rate should be \nrecovered from the banks and credited to a Trust to be created for the benefit of disadvantaged people. The Hon'ble Court had also directed that each concerned bank shal l contribute to the extent of \u20b950 lakh \nto the said Fund. Accordingly, UCBs are advised that excess amount realised, if any, from their borrowers \ntowards interest tax by way of rounding off, may be deposited with the above referred Trust Fund. The \nMinistry of Social Justice and Empowerment has opened SB A/c No.65012067356 with the State Bank of India (erstwhile State Bank of Patiala), Shastri Bhavan Branch, New Delhi in the name of the Trust. UCBs, \nwhich have realised excess amount from the borrowers, towards interest tax by way of rounding off to the next higher 0.25% are liable to deposit the said amount to the Trust Fund. As regards contribution of \u20b950 \nlakh to the Trust Fund, it is for the UCBs concerned which have collected excess amount, to decide \ndepending upon the facts and circumstances of the case.  \n10.2 Supreme Court in its Order dated February 21, 2014 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.301 of 2005 ordered \nthat credit institutions which were in existence between October 1991 and March 1997 but were merged \nwith another bank / financial institution prior to the date of the Supreme Court Order in April 2004 or merged subsequently, the transferee banks are liable to contribute to the extent of 50 lakh each as also deposit the excess amount collected by way of rounding off the interest tax on the interest income on loans and advances by the transferor banks, to the Trust Fund. In view of this all UCBs were advised to \ntake suitable action in accordance with the Order dated February 21, 2014 of the Supreme Court and \nreport status to the concerned Regional Office of RBI. \n11. Guidelines on Relief Measures to be Extended by Banks in Areas Affected by Natural \nCalamities \n11.1 UCBs are expected to provide relief and rehabilitation assistance, in their area of operation to people \naffected by natural calamities such as droughts, floods, cyclones, etc. The guidelines are given in \nAnnex - \n7. \n11.2 In order to avoid delay in taking relief measures on the occurrence of natural calamity, banks should evolve a suitable policy framework with the approval of the Board of Directors. An element of flexibility may be provided in the measures so as to synchronise the same with the measures which could be \nappropriate in a given situation.  \n11.3 Banks should get the documentation settled as per revised guidelines in consultation with their legal \ndepartments, taking into account the relevant provisions of the Contract Act and the Limitations Act and \nmay issue appropriate instructions to their offices in respect of documentation in relation to cases covered \nby these guidelines.  \n   \n20 \n Annex \u2013 1 \nGuidelines on Valuation of Properties \u2013  \nEmpanelment of Valuers (Paragraph No. 4.9)  \nBanks may be guided by the following aspects while formulating a policy on valuation of properties and \nappointment of valuers: \na) Policy for Valuation of Properties \ni) Banks should have a Board approved policy in place for valuation of properties including collaterals \naccepted for their exposures. \nii) The valuation should be done by professionally qualified independent valuers i.e., the valuer should \nnot have a direct or indirect interest.  \niii) The banks should obtain minimum two Independent Valuation Reports for properties valued at \u20b950 \ncrore or above.  \nThe revaluation policy of fixed assets should, inter alia, cover procedure for identification of assets for \nrevaluation, maintenance of separate set of records for such assets, the frequency of revaluation, \ndepreciation policy for such assets, policy for sale of such revalued assets, etc. The policy should also \ncover the disc losure required to be made in the 'Notes on Account' regarding the details of revaluation \nsuch as the original cost of the fixed assets subject to revaluation and accounting treatment for appreciation / depreciation etc. As the revaluation should reflect the change in the fair value of the fixed \nasset, the frequency of revaluation should be determined based on the observed volatility in the prices of \nthe assets in the past. Further, any change in the method of depreciation should reflect the change in the \nexpected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits of the assets. The banks should adhere \nto these principles meticulously while changing the frequency of revaluation / method of depreciation for a particular class of asset and should make proper disclosures in this regard. \nb) Policy for Empanelment of Independent Valuers \ni) Banks should have a procedure for empanelment of professional valuers and maintain a register of \n'approved list of valuers'. \nii) Banks may prescribe a minimum qualification for empanelment of valuers. Different qualifications may \nbe prescribed for different classes of assets ( e.g. land & building, plant & machinery, agricultural land, \netc). While prescribing the qualification, banks may take into consideration the qualificati ons prescribed \nunder Section 34AB (Rule 8A) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957. 2. Banks may also be guided by the relevant Accounting Standard issued by the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants of India.  \n   \n21 \n Annex - 2 \n[vide paragraph 5.1.2]  \ni. Credit Information Reports (CIRs) / Credit Bureau Usage in all Lending Decisions and Account \nOpening:  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) should include in their credit appraisal processes / loan \npolicies, suitable provisions for obtaining CIRs from one or more Credit Information Companies (CICs) so \nthat the credit decisions are based on information available in the system.  \nii. Populating Commercial Data Records in Databases of all CICs:  A roadmap in regard to CICs \npopulating their databases in respect to corporate borrowers is required to be laid out. For this purpose, \nUCBs are advised to report data in respect of their corporate borrowers to the CICs in a timely manner \nwith immediate effect. After a period of six months, UCBs should start using data available with the CICs \nin respect of commercial / corporate borrowers, under a Board approved policy. \niii. Standardisation of Data Format:  With a view to streamlining the process of data submission by UCBs \nto CICs, it has been decided to standardise the formats for data submission by the UCBs to the CICs. The \ndata format as per  Appendix - A should be taken as the base for standardisation of data format for \nconsumer and commercial borrowers. The data format would be a non- proprietary reporting format and \nhenceforth would be known as \"Uniform Credit Reporting Format\". The segment viz. consumer and \ncommercial will be denoted appropriately in parentheses, for example, \"Uniform Credit Reporting Format \n(Consumer)\". These should be uniformly adopted by the UCBs. \niv. Technical Working Group:  It has been decided to constitute a Technical Working Group comprising \nof representatives from Scheduled Commercial Banks (a member each from a Public Sector Bank, a Private Sector Bank and a Foreign Bank), Urban Cooperative Banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), All \nIndia Notified Financial Institutions, CICs, NBFCs, HFCs, IBA and MFIN to institutionalise a continuing \nmechanism for reviewing and making changes where necessary to the data formats. The data formats \nafter finalisation by the Group will be submitted to RBI for approval. The Working Group should also \nincorporate the additional fields as detailed in Appendix - B\n. \nv. Rectification of Rejected Data:  CICs are required to share with UCBs the logic and validation \nprocesses involved in data acceptance so that instances of data rejection can be minimised. The reasons \nfor rejection need to be parameterised and circulated among the UCBs concerned. Rejection reports \nshould be made simple and understandable so that they can be used for fixing reporting and data level \nissues. UCBs should rectify the rejected data and upload the same with the CICs within seven days of receipt of such rejection report. \nvi. Data Quality Index: A common Data Quality Index  would assist UCBs in determining the gaps in their \ndata and also move towards improving their performance over a period of time. In addition, they would \nalso be able to rank their own performance against that of their peers and identify their relative pos ition. \nUCBs may adopt this Data Quality Index for assessing the quality of data submissions and make efforts towards improving data quality and minimising data rejections, within a time period of six months. \nvii. Best Practices for UCBs: Every UCB should take into account the best practices as detailed \nin Appendix - C\n while formulating or reviewing the policy and procedure under the Credit Information \nCompanies (Regulation) Act, 2005 (CICRA) with the approval of their Board of Directors. \n   \n22 \n Appendix - A \nUniform Credit Reporting Format for Consumer and Commercial Borrowers  \nA.

To start with, the Working \nGroup may take up on priority basis changes required in the commercial segment and also in the following \nareas: \ni. Additional Fields in Data Format:  Annex 5 of the Report contains certain additional fields for inclusion \nin data format (field names and their benefits). Accordingly, except for priority sector indicator field, other \nfields may be incorporated in the consumer data format. For vehicles, only vehicle make and registration \nnumber would be compulsory and not the chassis number. The registration number of property registered \nwith Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India (CERSAI) needs \nto be added by the CICs.  [Recommendation 8.10 (b)] \nii. Compromise Settlements:  Data formats should include cases where compromise settlements have \ntaken place and the reason for such compromise settlements. [Recommendation 8.10 (c)] \niii. Detailed Product Classification:   UCBs should report detailed product classification to the CICs, e.g., \ncar loans, commercial vehicles and construction equipment vehicles, under auto loans. CICs should also \ninclude the same in their reports to the UCBs. [Recommendation 8.10 (d)] \niv. Information Regarding Relationship / Guarantor:  UCBs should capture certain information \npertaining to relationship / guarantor fields of the Corporates viz. the Business category / type, Mobile / \nTelephone number, State / PIN -code / Country in their Core Banking Solutions / System and report the \nsame to the commercial bureau of the CICs. [Recommendation 8.10 (e)] \nv. Members of Self Help Groups (SHG):  Credit information on individual members of SHGs is critical to \nestablish their credit history which would in turn foster growth of credit to the sector and promote financial \ninclusion. Therefore, UCBs may obtain data on individual members of SH Gs and start reporting the same \nto CICs within six months. [Recommendation 8.10 (f)] \nvi. Cross Reporting:  Guidelines for cross reporting, e.g., where individual is borrower and corporate is \nco-borrower, or vice versa , should be clearly intimated by CICs. The formats have fields to incorporate \nthe data where consumer data will be reported in the consumer bureau and co-borrower will be reported \nin commercial bureau. [Recommendation 8.10 (h)] \nvii. Reporting Days Past Due:  UCBs are mandated to report Days Past Due (DPD), for the credit facilities \nextended by them to consumers and corporates, while reporting to the CICs. [Recommendation 8.10 (i)] \nviii. Treatment of Part Instalment Due:  UCBs are required to submit data as it is while qualitative \ninformation on what filters to apply based on amount and period could be done by the specified users and \nothers who make use of the data. [Recommendation 8.10 (j)]  \nix. Income Data: Income data of the borrowers under the consumer bureau may continue to be reported \nby the UCB s to the CICs. [Recommendation 8.10 (k)] \nx. Identification Numbers:  In the commercial segment, corporate identification number (CIN) and credit \nhistory of the directors of the company (based on DIN number) should be reported by the UCBs to the \nCICs and inc luded by the CICs in their reports. [Recommendation 8.10 (l)] \nxi. Software for Reporting:  RBI is generally in agreement that there should be only one format for \nuploading and reverting reject data from the CIC as conversions / reconversions between formats  like \nExcel / TUDF / Notepad, etc., during the process of furnishing data create validation issues. However, the \nTechnical Working Group [please see paragraph 2 (iv) of the circular] of banks, CICs, NBFCs, etc. may \nfurther deliberate on this issue and make suitable suggestions, if considered necessary to RBI in this \nregard. [Recommendation 8.10 (m)]  \n27 \n xii. Written-off and Settled Status of Accounts:  While reporting their credit data, UCBs should use \n'settled' status for denoting only specific situations where due to financial inability to repay as per original \nterms and conditions, either a principal or an interest waiver or both is provided to the customer. UCBs \nneed to be aware of such a situation prior to extending fresh credit to such a customer. Cases of wrong \ndebits or contested charges should not be reported by UCBs as 'settled' but as 'disputed' as per the new field suggested for inclusion in the data format at Annex 5 of the Report. [Recommendation 8.12 (b)] \nxiii. Major Reasons for Restructuring:  This field in the commercial data format helps in understanding \nwhether the restructuring of loan of the borrower was due to external/extraneous factors such as external \nenvironment, general downturn in economy, etc., or company / borrower specific issues such as change \nin management, performance of promoters, etc. [Recommendation 8.13 (c)] \nxiv. Minimum of One Identifier Field in Data:  Data submitted by UCBs should be populated with at least \none of the identifier fields, viz., PAN Card No., Passport No., Driving Licence No., Voter ID Card No., \nAadhaar No., Telephone number, etc. [Recommendation 8.15]   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n 28 Appendix - C \nBest P ractices for U rban Cooperative Banks\nEvery U CB should tak e the following bes t practices i nto ac count while formulating or reviewing the policy  \nand procedure under the CICRA with the approval of their B oard of Directors: \ni. U\nCBs should ensure that the records submitted to CICs are updated regularly and that no instances of\nrepayment, including that of the last instalment, are left unreported.\nii.\nInstances of non-updation of repayment information could be avoided by centralising the issue of NOCs\nand providing information to CICs.iii\n. A\nll UCBs should have nodal officers for dealing with CICs.\niv.\nCustomer grievance redressal s hould be given top priority especially in respect of complaints relating\nto updation/alteration of credit information.v\n.\nGrievance redressal in respect of credit information should be integrated with the existing systems for\ngrievance redressal. Aspects relating to customer grievances pertaining to credit information may also be\nan integral part of customer service policy of UCBs.\nvi. U\nCBs should abide by the period stipulated under CICRA and the Rules and Regulations fram ed\nher\neunder in respect of updation, alteration of credit information, resolving disputes, etc. Procedur e\npr\nescribed under Rule 20 and 21 of the Credit Information Companies Rules, 2006 in this regard should\nbe adhered to. Deviations from stipulated time limits should be monitored and commented upon in the\nperiodical reports/reviews put up to the Board/Committees of Board on customer service.\nvii.\nUpdation of credit information should take place on a monthly basis or at such shorter intervals as may\nbe mutually agreed upon between the UCB and the CIC.viii\n. A\nll UCBs should give full customer information to the CICs. For instance, identifier information like\nPAN No., Aadhaar No., Voters ID Card No., etc., is not provided by UCBs for all records.ix\n. U\nCBs should mandate the usage of CIRs in their credit appraisal process.\nx. Fi\nrst time borrowers\u2019 loan applications should not be rejected just because they have no credit history.\nxi.\nUCBs and CICs should ensure that the credit records of borrowers are regularly updated by UCBs and\nthat issues s uch as where repayment of the last instalment of a loan does not get reported does not arise.\n[Recommendation 8.31]xii\n.\nWith a view to decreasing court cases involving UCBs and CICs, complaints need to be addressed by\nthem on an urgent basis. UCBs and CICs should have a structured process of complaint redressal for\nwhich a Consumer Protection Committee under the Board should be constituted. [Recommendation 8.34] \n29 \n Annex \u2013 3 \n[vide paragraph 5.1.3]  \nCredit information reporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) members \nI. Structure of credit information collection and reporting \n1. The structure of the credit information in respect of SHG members to be collected and reported by \nbanks to the CICs is set out below. \n1 Information to be collected by banks from in dividual SHG \nmembers where the total amount of loan to be attributed to or to \nbe availed by the SHG member exceeds \u20b9 30,000/- Table 1  \n2 Information to be collected by banks from individual SHG \nmembers where the total amount of loan to be attributed to or to \nbe availed by the SHG member is upto \u20b9 30,000/ - Table 2  \n3 Information on all individual SHG members to be reported by \nbanks to CICs  Table 3  \n4 Information on individual SHG members to be collected by banks \nat the time of opening of new Savings Bank Accounts of the SHG  Table 4  \n \n2. The data tables are given in the Appendix D . As indicated above, banks shall collect information from \nall SHG members in Tables 1 and 2 and report it to the CICs as set out in Table 3. The tables have been \ndesigned based on the following considerations:  \n(i) Some of the information (Item number 17 of Tables 1 and 2) is related to the existing exposures of the \nSHG members including that of the SHG groups with whom they might have been previously associated. \nThis is intended to help banks make informed credit decisions with regard to the SHG members. This \ninformation may be collected by banks directly from the CICs based on lead information provided by the \nSHG members. Hence, there would be no need for banks to include this information in the dataset \nreported to the CICs as per Table 3.  \n(ii) The information requirements will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will commence from \n1 July 2016 and last for one year. The depth of the credit-related information to be collected would increase \nin Phase II to be implemented from 1 July 2017. Additions/modifications to be effected during Phase II \nare indicated in the last column of Tables 1 and 2. \n(iii) The collection and reporting of credit information in respect of SHG members will be restricted to the \nmembers of those SHGs that take bank loans exceeding \u20b91,00,000/-. However, the members of all SHGs, \nregardless of the amount of group loan, shall report the non-credit information to banks through the SHG Group at the time when the SHG approaches the bank for a loan. \n(iv) Subject to (iii) above, the credit information requirements for SHG members having a share above \n\u20b930,000 or more in the SHG loan is more detailed than that in respect of those upto \u20b9 30,000. The \ndifference will be reduced, though not totally eliminated, as some more details are added to the latter in Phase II. \n(v) Th e non- credit information requirements have been designed both from the perspective of identification \nof the individual borrowers and supplementing the information requirements of banks, regulatory and \ngovernment development agencies for the purpose of evaluating the flow of credit to various sub-\nsegments of the SHG members and designing suitable credit penetration strategies keeping in view the \nsocio -economic profile of the sub-segments. The information shall be reported by banks to the CICs in a \nmanner that allows the CICs to identify all members associated with a particular SHG and a particular person to be identified with all SHGs with whom he/she is/was associated.  \n3. Banks shall put in place necessary systems and procedures including making necessary changes to \ntheir system software so as to be able to begin collection of the relevant information from the SHG  \n30 \n members and reporting the required information to the CICs from 1 July 2016 (Phase I) and 1 July 2017 \n(Phase II). \n4. Banks have the option to collect and report the SHG member level data either themselves or by \noutsourcing it to other entities. However, banks shall follow all general instructions on outsourcing set out \nin DOR.ORG.REC.27/21.04.158/2021-22 dated June 28, 2021  as amended from time to time to the \nextent applicable and shall continue to be responsible for the correctness of the data submitted by the outsourced agencies to the CICs. Banks must put in place appropriate controls to ensure the correctness \nof the data submitted by the entities to which it is outsourced.  \n5. Banks shall immediately start monitoring the NPA levels in the SHG segment on an ongoing basis, if \nnot being already done, and collect detailed information from SHG members availing of loans exceeding \na lower threshold of \u20b920,000, if the gross NPA in the SHG segment exceeds 10% or is higher than the \ntotal gross NPA of the bank by 5 percentage points.  \n6. Non-adherence to the above instructions by Urban Cooperative Banks shall result in exclusion of non-\ncompliant SHG loan accounts from the loan portfolios eligible to be reckoned for the purpose of complying \nwith the Priority Sector Loan (PSL) targets. The determination with regard to loans qualifying for PSL \nbenefit would be made at the end of each phase, based on a review of the compliance with the credit and \nnon-credit information requirements as applicable to that phase. \nII. Other operational instructions \n7. At this stage, it is envisaged to capture details of only the credit facilities availed of by the SHG member \nfrom the banks and MFIs. Therefore, any information relating to inter -loaning among the SHG members \nout of their own savings will not be covered. However, in order to know the overall  indebtedness of a SHG \nmember it may be necessary to know their exposures to the SHGs with regard to inter -loaning as well. As \npart of the continued endeavour to improve the quality of information of a SHG member, the need for capturing the inter -loaning would be reviewed after stabilisation of Phase II. \n8. Given significant challenges in monitoring and reporting the performance of individual loans availed by the SHG members out of the amounts lent by banks to the SHGs, it is also not envisaged to extend the credit reporting system to the monitoring of repayment and recovery of these loans. However, this will \nalso be considered after Phase II has taken ground. \n9. With a view to building up the adequate information base of the potential SHG member borrowers and \nexpediting the process of collection and reporting of KYC compliant information relating to the members \nof the SHGs when the SHGs are credit-linked, banks are encouraged to offer Small Accounts/ Basic \nSavings Bank Deposit Account to the SHG members when  an SHG approaches them for opening its \nSavings Account. In cases where the SHG members agree to open such accounts, the information in Table 4 may be collected and kept on record to be used at the time when the SHG approaches the bank \nfor a loan. However, it must not be made a pre-condition for opening the Savings Account of the SHG.  \n10. None of the data requirements specified in this circular should be made a pre-condition for extending \nloans to the SHGs, though banks must make sincere efforts to comply with these requirements. \n11. Banks may encourage the SHGs to keep written records of loans distributed to their members out of \nthe bank loan including the digitization scheme for SHGs of NABARD, where applicable, and may consider \nintroducing appropriate inc entives in this regard.  \n12. Banks shall develop appropriate policies to deal with applications for credit facilities from members of SHGs/SHGs on whom default is reported by the CICs. Care needs to be taken that the SHGs/individual \nmembers are not denied loans merely because of such defaults and banks should appropriately evaluate \nthe credit history of the members themselves and take into account the economic viability of their \nactivity/ies and the Groups\u2019 capacity to service the loan proposed to be taken by considering their loan \napplications.  \n13. The credit information relating to individual SHG members shall be collected, reported and \ndisseminated as per the provisions of the Credit Information Companies (Regulations) Act, 2005 and the \nextant RBI directions on credit information reporting by banks and MFIs.  \n31 \n  \n \nIII. Specific instructions to the CICs \n14. The CICs shall make the necessary changes in their systems and procedures to implement the above \ndirections as per the timelines indicated above. \n15. CICs shall formulate appropriate policies with the approval of their Boards to share the credit \ninformation relating to SHGs or SHG members, on an aggregate basis with the Government agencies, \nNABARD, banks and MFIs for the purpose of credit planning and resear ch. In accordance with their board \napproved policies, the CICs could also share the aggregate information with other parties for the purpose \nof undertaking research that could potentially benefit the SHG segment. The aggregate information shall \nbe shared i n a manner that is non- discriminatory and respects the confidentiality of the individual SHG \ngroups and the SHG members as per the relevant laws of the country. \n   \n32 \n Appendix D2 \nInformation to be collected by banks \nTable 1: Information to be collected from individual SHG members where the total amount of \nloan to be attributed to or to be availed by the SHG member exceeds \u20b9 30,0003 \n \nParticulars required  Particulars provided  Basis  Modifications \nduring Phase II  \nI.

With the approval of their boards, the banks with Gross NPA ratio exceeding 10% in the SHG loan segment may fix a lower \nthreshold for collecting the information/data indicated in this Table and the next one. This amount will not include any subsidy or margin out of \nthe member\u2019s own savings that goes towards funding the activity or the purpose for which the loan is taken (both either back end or front end). \n4 The banks may specifically see if any of the SHG members would fall within the purview of DBR circular DBR.

Non- adherence to this condition may be taken into account while extending \nfurther loan to the SHG or renewing its cash credit limit next time. The banks need to incorporate suitable clauses in the loan agreements relating \nto penal provisions for providing wrong information regarding the amount of loans taken out of the group loans. Depending upon their experience, \nbanks may also insist on maintenance of verifiable record of the amounts distri buted out of bank loans in cases where the average amount of \nloan availed by the SHG  per member exceeds \u20b920,000/- .  \n35 \n 19.

For \ndetails please refer to circular FIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.3/06.02.31/2020 -21 dated July 2, 2020 . \nThe new criteria will come into effect from July 1, 2020 and an enterprise shall be classified as a \nmicro, small or m edium enterprise on the basis of the following criteria, namely:  \ni. a micro enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not \nexceed one crore rupees and turnover does not exceed five crore rupees; \nii. a small enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not exceed ten crore rupees and turnover does not exceed fifty crore rupees; and  \niii. a medium enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does \nnot exceed fifty crore rupees and turnover does not exceed two hundred and fifty crore \nrupees . \n \n \n     \n \n     \n \n  \n \n   \n45 \n Annex - 6 \nSafeguards to be observed Advances against Pledge of Gold / Silver Ornaments \n(vide paragraph 7.5.1)  \ni) Ownership of Ornaments \nIt is advisable that the advances are made to persons properly introduced to the bank. The bank \nshould satisfy itself about the ownership of the gold ornaments etc. before accepting them for \npledge. The bank should obtain a declaration from the borrower that the ornaments are his own \nproperty and that he has the fullest right to pledge them to the bank. Taking of ornaments for \npledge and release thereof to the parties concerned after repayment of the bank's dues should \nbe done strictly in the authorised official's room to avoid any risk.  \nii) Appraiser  \nThe bank should appoint an approved jeweller or shroff as an appraiser for valuation of the gold ornaments proposed to be pledged to the bank and obtain adequate security from him in the form \nof cash and indemnity bond. Valuation and appraisal of the ornaments in the bank's premises itself would be ideal but when these are not possible, the bank should take sui table precautions \nagainst their loss while in transit. The bank should send the ornaments to the appraiser in a locked box, one key of which should be kept with the appraiser and the other with the bank. The box \nshould be sent through a responsible member of the staff along with the prospective borrower. \nThe placing of ornaments in the box at both the ends should be done in the presence of the \nemployee carrying the ornaments to the appraiser and the borrower. The bank should take a \nsuitable insurance cover for loss of the ornaments while in transit.  \niii) Valuation Report  \na. The valuation certificate of the appraiser should clearly indicate the description of the \nornaments, their fitness, gross weight of the ornaments, net weight of the gold content \nexclusive of stones, lac, alloy, strings, fastenings and the value of the gold at the prevailing \nmarket price. The valuation report should be duly signed by the appraiser and kept along \nwith the loan documents by the bank. \nb. In order to standardize the valuation and mak e it more transparent to the borrower, it has \nbeen decided that gold jewellery accepted as security/collateral will have to be valued at \nthe average of the closing price of 22 carat gold for the preceding 30 days as quoted by \nthe India Bullion and Jeweller s Association Ltd. [Formerly known as the Bombay Bullion \nAssociation Ltd. (BBA)]. If the gold is of purity less than 22 carats, the bank should translate the collateral into 22 carat and value the exact grams of the collateral. In other \nwords, jewellery of lower purity of gold shall be valued proportionately  \niv) Record of Security  \nThe full name of the borrower, his residential address, date of advance, amount and description \nof the ornaments in detail should be recorded in the gold ornaments register which should be \nchecked / initialled by the Manager. \n \n  \n46 \n v) Custody of Ornaments \nThe ornaments belonging to each borrower (or articles of each loan) together with a list indicating \nthe description of ornaments, gold loan account number , name of party, etc. should be kept \nseparately in small cloth bags. A tag indicating loan account number and name of the party should \nbe tied to the bag to facilitate identification. The bags should be arranged in trays according to \nloan account numbers and kept in the strong room or  fire proof safes under joint custody.  \nvi) Period \nThe period of advance against gold ornaments should be generally restricted to 6 months or 1 \nyear.  \nvii) Margin  \nAs a prudential measure, it has been decided to prescribe a Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio of not exceeding 75 per cent for UCBs\u2019 lending against gold jewellery (including bullet repayment loans \nagainst pledge of gold jewellery).  The bank should collect interest on advances promptly. In no \ncircumstances should it allow to water down the margin by debiti ng the interest accrued to the \nloan account. \nviii) Return of Ornaments \nOn repayment of the loan together with the interest payable in the account, the ornaments should \nbe returned to the borrower and his receipt obtained in token of having received the ornaments. \nix) Part Release \nWhile allowing part release of the ornaments against part repayment of the loan, care should be \ntaken to ensure that the value of the left-over ornaments is sufficient to cover outstanding balance \nwith the margin prescribed in the a/c. \nx) Delivery to Third Parties \nWhen the ornaments are delivered to third parties, a letter of authority from the borrower and \nsubsequent confirmation of the borrower should be obtained. The letter of authority should contain \nan undertaking by the borrow er, absolving the bank of any responsibility in the event of dispute \nor loss arising from the delivery of the ornaments to the party named therein. The receipt of the third party should be obtained on the letter of authority as well as in the gold loan led ger. \nxi) Default  \nWhen the borrower fails to repay the loan on the due date, a notice calling upon him to repay the \nloan within a specified time should be given and if no response is received, a reminder should be \nsent by registered post informing the borrower that the ornaments would be auctioned and after \nadjusting the sale proceeds against the outstanding dues to the bank, the balance, if any, would \nbe paid to the borrower against his receipt.  \nxii) Re-pledge of Ornaments \nIt is not advisable for UCBs to make advances against re-pledge of ornaments as this facility is \nlikely to be misused for financing moneylenders, which is not a desirable activity. \n  \n47 \n  \nxiii) Insurance \nThe jewels pledged to the bank should be insured for the appraised value against the risk  of \nburglary. If banks store the pledged jewels in fire-proof strong rooms, insuring them against fire \nmay not be necessary. Banks may take blanket insurance policy covering cash, jewels and other \nvaluables and also covering all types of risks.  \nxiv) Verification \nSurprise verification of the packets containing gold / silver ornaments by an officer other than the \njoint custodian be undertaken and should be recorded in a separate register with necessary \ndetails.  \n \n   \n48 \n Annex - 7 \nGuidelines for Relief Measures by B anks in Areas Affected by Natural Calamities \n[Vide paragraph 11.1] \n1. Periodic but frequent occurrence of droughts, floods, cyclones, tidal waves and other natural \ncalamities cause heavy toll of human life and wide spread damage to economic pursuits of hum an \nbeings in one area or the other of the country. The devastation caused by such natural calamities \ncall for massive rehabilitation efforts by all agencies. The State and local authorities draw \nprogrammes for economic rehabilitation of the affected people. The developmental role assigned \nto the commercial banks and co-operative banks, warrants their active support in revival of the \neconomic activities.  \n2. Since the area and time of occurrence and intensity of natural calamities cannot be anticipated, it is imperative that the banks have a blue-print of action in such eventualities so that the required \nrelief and assistance is provided with the utmost speed and without any loss of time. This presupposes that all the branches of urban cooperative banks will have a set of standing \ninstructions spelling out the action that the branches will have to initiate in the calamity affected \nareas immediately after the requisite declaration by the district / State authorities. It is necessary \nthat these instructions shoul d also be available with the State Government authorities and all the \nDistrict Collectors so that all concerned are clear as to the action that would be taken by the banks' branches in the affected areas. \n3. The precise details in regard to the provision of credit assistance by the commercial banks, will \ndepend on the requirements of the situation, their own operational capabilities and the actual \nneeds of the borrowers. This can be decided by them in consultation with the district authorities.  \n4. Neverthel ess, to enable banks to take uniform and concerted action expeditiously, particularly \nto provide the financial assistance to agriculturist, small scale industrial units, artisan, small \nbusiness and trading establishments affected by natural calamities, the following guidelines are \ncommended. \n5. To facilitate co-ordination and expeditious action by the financing institutions, the convenors of \nthe concerned District Consultative Committee (DCC) of the affected districts should convene a \nmeeting immediately after the occurrence of natural calamities. In the event of the calamity \ncovering a larger part of the State, the convenors of the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) \nwill also convene a meeting immediately to evolve a co -ordinated programme of action for \nimplementation of the programme in collaboration with the State / district authorities while determining the quantum of assistance required by a person affected by the natural calamity, the \nbanks may take into consideration the assistance / subsidy received by him from the State \nGovernment and / or other agencies.  \n6. Regional / Zonal heads of UCBs should be vested with certain discretionary powers so that they do not have to seek fresh approvals from their Central Offices to the line of action agreed to \nby the District / State Level Bankers' Committees. For example, such discretionary power would \nbe necessary in respect of adoption of scale of finance, extension of loan periods, sanction of \nnew loans, keeping in view the total liability of the borrower (i.e. arising out of the old loan where \nthe assets financed are damaged or lost on account of natural calamity as well as the new loan for creation / repair of such assets, margin, security, etc.).  \n49 \n 7. Identification of the Beneficiaries \nThe bank branches should obtain from the concerned Government authorities list of affected \nvillages within their area of operation. From among the identified persons, assessment of loss \nsustained by the existing constituents of the banks would be easier. In the case of fresh borr owers, \nhowever, discreet enquiries should be made in this regard and assistance of the Government. \nauthorities should be sought wherever available for ascertaining genuineness of their \nrequirements. For providing conversion facilities in respect of crop loans, procedure for \nidentification of areas where such facilities have to be provided has been indicated under crop \nloans in paragraph 12 below. \n8. Coverage \nEach branch will provide credit assistance not only to its existing borrowers but also to other \neligible persons within its command area provided they are not covered by any other financial \nagency. \n9. Priorities  \nImmediate assistance including finances would be needed for protecting and rejuvenating \nstanding crops / orchards / plantations etc. Equally important will be repair and protection of \nlivestock sheds, grains and fodder storage / structures, drainage, pumping, and other measures \nand operations to repair pump-sets, motors, engines and other necessary implements. Subject to \nseasonal requirements, nex t crop financing would be taken up. \n10. Agricultural Loans \ni) The bank assistance in relation to agriculture would be needed in the form of short-term loans \nfor the purpose of raising crops and term loans for purchase of milch / draught animals, repairs of  \nexisting tube-wells and pump-sets, digging of new tube-wells and installation of new pump-sets, land reclamation, silt / sand removal, protection and rejuvenation of standing crops / orchard / \nplantations, etc., repairs and protection of livestock sheds, grain and fodder storage structures, \netc. \nii) Crop Loans: In the case of natural calamities, such as droughts, floods etc., Government \nauthorities would have declared annewari  to indicate the extent to which the crops are damaged. \nHowever, where such declaration has not been made banks should not delay in providing \nconversion facilities, and the District Collector's certificate that crop yield is below 50 percent of \nthe normal yield supported by the views of the DCC in the matter (for which a special meeting \nmay have to be convened) should be sufficient for invoking quick relief arrangements. The \ncertificate of the Collector should be issued crop -wise covering all crops, including food-grains. \nIssuing of such certificates in respect of cash crops, may, however, be left to the discretion of the \nCollector.  \niii) To be effective, the assistance to farmers will have to be disbursed with utmost speed. For this \npurpose the lead bank and the district authorities concerned should evolve a procedure whereby \nidentifica tion of borrowers, issuance of certificates regarding Government / co-operative / bank \ndues, title of the applicant to land etc. is secured simultaneously. \niv) Possibilities of organising credit camps, where Block Development and Revenue officials, Co-\noperative Inspectors, Panchayat Pradhans etc. could help finalise the applications on the spot,  \n50 \n could be explored in consultation with the district authorities where such credit camps are being \norganised. The State Government will also arrange with the Collectors to issue an executive order \nfor the following officers or their authorised representatives to assume respective duties and \nresponsibilities as envisaged under implementation of credit camps programme:  \n\u2022 Block Development Officer  \n\u2022 Co-operative Inspector  \n\u2022 Revenue Authority / Village Revenue Assistant  \n\u2022 Bank official operating in the area \n\u2022 PACS / LAMPS / FSS  \n\u2022 Gram Panchayat Pradhan \nIn order to avoid delay, the forms in which the State Government Officers have to give certificates at the Credit Camps may be got printed in sufficient numbers by the respective District \nMagistrates.  \nv) In considering loan applications for the ensuing crop season the current dues of the applicants \nto the State Government may be ignored, provided the State Government declare a moratori um \nfor a sufficiently long period on all amounts due to the government as on the date of occurrence of the natural calamity. \n11. Consumption Loans \nAs per extant instructions, loans up to \u20b9250/- could be sanctioned to existing borrowers for general \nconsumption purposes and the limit  could be enhanced to \u20b9 1,000/- in the States where the State \nGovernments have constituted risk funds for such lending. The present limit may be enhanced to \n\u20b95,000/- without any collateral and such loans may be provided even if no risk fund has been \nconstituted.  \n12. Fresh Loans \n12. Timely fresh financial assistance to resume productive activities may be provided not only to \nthe existing borrowers, but also to other eligible borrowers. Notwithstanding the status of the \nexisti ng account, fresh loans granted to the borrowers will be treated as current dues. \n13. Restructuring of existing Loans \na. As the repaying capacity of the people affected by natural calamities gets severely impaired \ndue to the damage to the economic pursuits  and loss of economic assets, relief in repayment of \nloans becomes necessary in areas affected by natural calamity and hence, restructuring of the \nexisting loans will be required. The principal amount outstanding in the crop loans and agriculture \nterm loans as well as accrued interest thereon may be converted into term loans. \nb. The repayment period of restructured term loans may vary depending on the severity of \ncalamity and its recurrence, the extent of loss of economic assets and distress caused. General ly, \nthe restructured period for repayment may be 3 to 5 years. However, where the damage arising out of the calamity is very severe, banks may, at their discretion, extend the period of repayment \nranging up to 7 years and in extreme cases of hardship, the repayment period may be prolonged  \n51 \n up to a maximum period of 10 years. In all cases of restructuring, moratorium period of at least \none year should be considered. Further, the banks should not insist for additional collateral \nsecurity for such restructured loans. The asset classification status of the restructured term loan \nand other dues will be as under:  \nc. The restructured crop loans may be treated as current dues and need not be classified as NPA. The asset classification of the restructured term loans would thereafter be governed by the revised \nterms and conditions and would be treated as NPA if interest and / or instalment of principal \nremain overdue for two crop seasons for short duration crops and for one crop season for long \nduration crops. Depending upon the duration of crops raised by an agriculturist, the above norms \nwould also be made applicable to the restructured agricultural term loans. \nd. The above norms will be applicable to all direct agricultural advances as listed at Annex I of \nMaster Circular No. UBD.PCB.MC.No.10/09.14.000/2007-08 dated July 4, 2007\n on prudential \nnorms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to advances. \ne. Additional finance, if any, may be treated as \u201cstandard asset\u201d and its future asset classification \nwill be governed by the terms and conditions of its sanction.  \nf. The asset classification as on the date of natural calamity will continue, if the restructuring is completed within a period of three months from the date of natural calamity. The restructured \naccounts would, otherwise, be governed by provisions of circular UBD.BPD.No.30/09.09.001/05 -\n06 dated March 9, 2006. Further, the guidelines applicable to sub-standard accounts, will apply, mutatis mutandis to doubtful accounts. \ng. In retail or consumer loans segment, the banks may restructure the loans in a manner suitable \nto the borrowers on a case-to-case basis.  \n14. Scale of Finance \nScale of finance in respect of different crops will be uniform in a district. The scales will be fixed \ntaking into account the prevailing conditions and norms presently adopted by different lending \nagencies. In fixing the scales, minimum consumption needs of borrowers will be taken into account. The concerned District Magistrate and Managers of branches of banks operating in the \ndistrict would be advised to adopt the scales so laid down. \n15. Development Loans - Investment Costs \ni) The existing term loan instalments will have to be rescheduled / postponed keeping in view the \nrepaying capacity of the borrowers and the nature of natural calamity viz., \na) Droughts, floods or cyclones etc. where only crop for that year is damaged and productive \nassets are not damaged. \nb) Floods or cyclones where the productive assets are partially or totally damaged and borrowers \nare in need of a new loan. \nii) In regard to natural calamity under category (a), the banks may postpone the payment of \ninstalment during the year of natural calamity and extend the loan period by one year except \n(subject to the following exceptions) -  \n52 \n a) Those cultivators who had not effected the development or investment for which the loan was \nobtained or had disposed of the equipment or machinery purchased out of the loan.  \nb) Those who are income tax payers. \nc) In the case of drought, those who are having perennial sources of irrigation except where water \nsupply was not released from canals or irrigation facility was not available from other perennial \nsources.  \nd) Tractor owner s, except in genuine case where there is loss of income and consequential \nimpairment of their repaying capacity.  \niii) Under this arrangement the instalments defaulted wilfully in earlier years will not be eligible for \nrescheduling. The banks may have to postpone payment of interest by borrowers. While fixing \nextension of period the commitment towards interest may also be taken into account.  \niv) In regard to category (i)(b) above, i.e., where the borrower's assets are totally damaged, the \nrescheduling by way  of extension of loan period may be determined on the basis of overall \nrepaying capacity of the borrower including his repayment commitment on the old term loans and towards the conversion loan (medium term loan) on account of postponing of repayment of short -\nterm loans and the fresh crop loan. In such cases, the repayment period of total loan (including interest liability) less the subsidies received from the Government agencies, compensation \navailable under the insurance schemes, etc. may be fixed having regard to the repaying capacity \nof the borrower subject to a maximum of 15 years, depending upon the type of investment as well \nas the economic (useful) life of the new asset financed, except in cases where loans relate to land \nshaping, silt removal, soil conservation etc. Thus , in the case of loans for agricultural machineries, \nviz. pump-sets and tractors, it should be ensured that the total loan period does not generally \nexceed 9 years from the date of advance.  \n16. Apart from rescheduling existing term loans, banks will provide to affected farmers diverse \ntype of term loans for developmental purposes, such as:  \ni) Minor Irrigation \nTerm loans for repairs to wells, pump-sets, etc. which are to be quantified after assessing the \nextent of damage and estimated c ost of repairs.  \nii) Bullocks \nWhere the drought animals have been washed away, requests for fresh loans for a new pair of \nbullocks / he-buffaloes may be considered. Where loans are given for purchase of new cattle or \nwhere farmers have bought milch cattle, reasonable credit may be given for purchase of fodder \nor feed. \niii) Milch Cattle \nTerm loan for milch cattle will be considered depending upon breed, milk yield, etc., the loan \namount will include repairs to shelters, purchase of equipment and feed.  \niv) Insurance \nConsidering the proneness of areas to cyclones and other natural calamities, the cattle should be \ninsured instead of Risk -cum-Mortality Fund established for similar purpose in other safe areas.  \n53 \n Milch animals / draught cattle should be branded for identification as also to serve as safeguard \nagainst their re-sale by the beneficiaries.  \nv) Poultry and Piggery  \nFor poultry, piggery and rearing of goats, loans will be considered as per norms of different banks. \nvi) Fisheries \nIn the case of borrowers who have lost their boats, nets and other equipment, re-phasing of \npayment of existing dues may be allowed on merits. Fresh loans may be granted to them with \nloan maturity of 3/4 years. Loans for repairs to boats of the existing borrowers may also be \nconsidered. In cases where subsidy is available, the quantum of loan should be reduced to that \nextent. In States where substantial subsidy towards cost of boats, nets, etc. is likely to be \navailable, proper co-ordination with the State Government Department concerned in this regard \nmust be ensured. Apart from complying with other norms and conditions for grant of advances, \nassistance may be sought from the Department of Fisheries, which may be expected to take \nmeasures which would enable banks to proceed with financin g for this purpose. The boats should \nbe comprehensively insured against all risks including natural calamities as far as possible.  \n17. Land Reclamation \ni) It is likely that financial assistance will be required for reclamation of lands covered by sand \ncasting. Normally, sand / silt deposits upto 3 inches will either be ploughed back into the soil or \nremoved by the farmers without any need for financial assistance. Loan applications will, however, \nbe considered in cases where immediate cultivation is possibl e and reclamation (removal of sand) \nis necessary. Wherever reclamation finance for saline lands is warranted, the cost of reclamation \nnot exceeding 25 percent of the scale allowed for crop loan may be advanced along with the crop \nloan. \nii) For other activates like Sericulture, Horticulture, Floriculture, Betel vine growing etc., banks will \nadvance loans for investment and working capital under their existing schemes and follow usual \nprocedures laid down by them. The working capital finance may be provided until such period the income from the plantation is adequate to take care of such expenditure. \niii). However, additional need based crop loans, if necessary, would be given for revitalisation / \nrejuvenation of standing crop / orchards based on individual as sessment. \niv) The question relating to procurement and proper arrangement for supply of adequate quantity \nof seeds and various types of fertilisers will have to be discussed with the State Government and \nDistrict Administration in each district. Similarly, for the purpose of ensuring adequate irrigation \nfacilities, the State Government will undertake repairs to Government owned shallow and deep tube-wells and River Lift Irrigation System damaged by floods and other natural calamities. As for \nfisheries, the fisheries department of the State Government will make arrangement to obtain \nfingerlings / and supply them to those who wish to revive tank fishing with bank finance. \nv) The State Government will have to consider preparation of schemes which would enable \ncommercial banks to obtain refinance at NABARD rates for amounts advanced by banks for the \nsaid purpose. \n  \n54 \n 18. Artisans and Self -Employed  \ni) For all categories of rural artisans and self employed persons including handloom weavers, \nloans will be needed for r epairs of sheds, replacement of implements and purchase of raw \nmaterials and stores. In sanctioning the loan, due allowance will be made for subsidy / assistance \navailable from the State Government concerned.  \nii) There may be many artisans, traders and sel f-employed who may not have any banking \narrangement or facility with any bank, but will now need financial assistance for rehabilitation. Such categories will be eligible for assistance from banks' branches in whose command areas \nthey reside or carry on their profession / business. Where such a person / party falls under the \ncommand area of more than one bank, the banks concerned will meet together and sort out his \nproblem. \n19. Small Scale and Tiny Units  \ni) Rehabilitation of units under village and cottage industry sector, small scale industrial units as \nalso smaller of the medium industrial sector damaged, will also need attention. Term loans for \nrepairs to and renovation of factory buildings / sheds and machinery as also for replacement of \ndamaged parts and working capital for purchase of raw materials and stores will need to be \nprovided urgently. \nii) Where the raw materials or finished goods have been washed away or ruined or damaged, \nbanks security for working capital will naturally be eroded and the work ing capital account (Cash \nCredit or Loan) will be out of order. In such cases, banks will convert drawings in excess of the \nvalue of security into a term loan and also provide further working capital to the borrower. \niii) Depending on the damage suffered and time needed for rehabilitation and restarting production \nand sales, term loan instalments will have to be suitably rescheduled keeping in view the income \ngenerating capacity of the unit. Shortfall in margins will have to be condoned or even waived and \nborrower should be allowed time to build up margin gradually from his future cash generation. \nWherever State Government or any agency has formulated special scheme for providing grants / subsidy / seed money, suitable margin may be stipulated to the extent of such grants / subsidy \n/ seed money.  \niv) The primary consideration before the banks in extending credit to a small / tiny unit for its \nrehabilitation should be the viability of the venture after the rehabilitation programme is \nimplemented. \n20. Terms and Conditions \nThe terms and conditions governing relief loans will be flexible as to security, margin, etc. In the \ncase of small loans covered by guarantee of Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee \nCorporation, personal guarantees will not be insisted upon. In any case, credit should not be \ndenied for want of personal guarantees. \n21. Security \nWhere the bank's existing security has been eroded because of damage or destruction by floods, \nassistance will not be denied merely for want of additional fresh security . The fresh loan may be \ngranted even if the value of security (existing as well as the asset to be acquired from the new loan) is less than the loan amount. For fresh loans sympathetic view will have to be taken:  \n55 \n a) Where the crop loan (which has been conv erted into term loan) was earlier given against \npersonal security / hypothecation of crop which would be the case for c rop loans upto \u20b95,000/- \nand the borrower is not able to offer charge / mortgage of land as security for the converted loan, \nhe should not be denied conversion facility merely on the ground of his inability to furnish land as \nsecurity. \nb) If the borrower has already taken a term loan against mortgage / charge on land, the bank \nshould be content with a second charge for the converted term loan. \nc) Banks should not insist on third party guarantees for providing conversion facilities. d) In the case of term loans for replacement of equipment, repairs, etc. and for working capital \nfinance to artisans and self-employed persons or for crop loans, usual security may be obtained. \nWhere land is taken as security in the absence of original Title Records, a Certificate issued by \nthe Revenue Department Officials may be accepted for financing farmers who have lost proof of \ntheir titles i.e.,  in the form of deeds, as also the registration certificates issued to registered share-\ncroppers.  \ne) As per the recommendations of the Reserve Bank of India's report on Customer Service, banks \nwill finance the bor rowers who require loans upto \u20b9500/- without insisting either on collateral \nsecurity or guarantee for any type of economic activity. \n22. Margin  \nMargin requirements be waived or the grants / subsidy given by the concerned State Government \nmay be considered as margin. \n23. Interest  \nThe rates of interest will be in accordance with the directives of the Reserve Bank of India. Within \nthe areas of their discretion, however, banks are expected to take a sympathetic view of the \ndifficulties of the borrowers and extend a concessional treatment to calamity -affected people.  \ni) Those meeting the eligibility criteria under the scheme of Differential Rate of Interest should be \nprovided credit in accordance with the provision of the scheme.  \nii) In respect of current dues in default, no penal interest will be charged. The banks should also suitably defer the compounding of interest charges. \n24. Other Issues \ni) Business Continuity Planning (BCP)  \nIn the backdrop of increased leveraging of technology in banking system, BCP has become a key \npre-requisite for minimizing business disrupti on and system failures. As a BCP strategy, banks \nmay identify alternate branches for branches located in areas prone to natural calamities. Banks may therefore formulate full -fledged comprehensive BCP along with Disaster -Recovery (DR) \narrangements. The banks may also focus on keeping the DR site current, to test them \ncomprehensively and synchronize the data between the primary and secondary sites. \n \n  \n56 \n ii) Access to Customers to their Bank Accounts \na) In areas where the bank branches are affected by natural calamity and are unable to function \nnormally, banks may operate from temporary premises, under advice to Reserve Bank of India. \nFor continuing the temporary premises beyond 30 days, specific approval may be obtained from \nthe Regional Office (RO) concerned of Reserve Bank of India. Banks may also ensure rendering \nof banking services to the affected areas by setting up satellite offices, extension counters or mobile banking facilities under intimation to RO of Reserve Bank of India.  \nb) To satisfy customer's imm ediate cash requirements, banks could consider waiving the \npenalties related to accessing accounts such as fixed deposits  \nc) Restoration of the functioning of ATMs at the earliest or making alternate arrangements for providing such facilities may be given due importance. Banks may consider putting in place \narrangements for allowing their customers to access other ATM networks, Mobile ATMs, etc. \niii) Currency Management  \nBanks / branches affected by natural calamity, if required, may contact other banks maintaining \nits current accounts or the currency chest branch to which it is linked in order to ensure that supply \nof currency is maintained to its customers. \niv) KYC Norms  \nTo facilitate opening of new accounts by persons affected by natural calamities especial ly for \navailing various relief's given by Government / other agencies, banks may open accounts with -  \na) introduction from another account holder who has undergone full KYC procedure, or  \nb) documents of identity such as Voter's Identity Card or a driving l icense, identity card issued by \nan office, company, school, college, etc. along with a document indicating the address such as \nElectricity Bill, Ration Card etc. or  \nc) introduction by two neighbou rs who have the documents as indicated in paragraph (b) abov e \nor \nd) in the absence of the above, any other evidence to the satisfaction of the bank.  \ne) The above instructions will be applicable to cases where the balance i n the account does not \nexceed \u20b950,000/- or the amount of relief granted (if higher) and the total credit in the account does \nnot exceed \u20b91,00,000/- or the amount of relief granted, (if higher) in a year. \nv) Clearing and Settlement Systems \nTo ensure continuity in clearing service, Reserve Bank of India has advised the banks for 'on-city \nback -up centres' in 20 large cities and effective low -cost settlement solution for the remaining \ncities. The banks in a clearing area could meet with a view to providing flexible clearing services \nwhere normal clearing services are disrupted. However, notwithstanding these arrangements, \nbanks may also consider discounting cheques for higher amounts to meet customers' requirement \nof funds. Banks could also consider waiver fees for EFT, ECS  or mail services so as to facilitate \ninward transfer of funds to accounts of pers ons affected by a natural calamity  \n  \n57 \n 25. Applicability of the Guidelines in the case of Trade and Industry  \nInstructions on moratorium, maximum repayment period, additional collateral for restructured \nloans and asset classification in respect of fresh financ e will be applicable to all affected \nrestructured borrowal accounts, including accounts of industries and trade, besides agriculture  \n26. Applicability of the Guidelines in the case of Riots and Disturbances \nWhenever Reserve Bank of India advises the banks to extend rehabilitation assistance to the riot \n/ disturbance affected persons, the aforesaid guidelines may broadly be followed by banks for the \npurpose. It should, however, be ensured that only genuine persons, duly identified by the State \nGovernment agencies as having been affected by the riots, etc., are extended rehabilitation / \nassistance.  \ni) With a view to ensuring quick relief to the affected persons, the District Collector, on occurrence of the riot / disturbances, may ask the Lead Bank Officer to convene a meeting of the DCC, if \nnecessary, and submit a report to the DCC on the extent of damage caused to the life and property \nin the area affected by riots / disturbances. If the DCC is satisfied that there has been extensive \nloss to life and property , the relief, as per aforesaid guidelines, may be extended to the people \naffected by riots / disturbances. In certain centres where there are no DCCs, the District Collector may request the Convener SLBC of the State to convene a meeting of the bankers to consider \nextension of relief to the affected persons. The report submitted by the Collector and the decision thereon of DCC / SLBC may be recorded and should form a part of the minutes of the meeting. A \ncopy of the proceedings of the meeting may be forwarded to the concerned Regional Office of \nthe Reserve Bank of India. \nii) It should be ensured that only genuine persons duly identified by the State Administration, as \nhaving been affected by the riots / disturbances are provided the assistance. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n58 \n Appendix  \nA.

Components of Basel III Standardised  Approach  (Basel III S A) \n5.1 Basel III SA calculation methodology is based on the following components:  \n5.1.1  the Business Indicator (BI) , which is a f inancial -statement -based proxy for \noperational risk;  \n5.1.2  the Business Indicator Component (BIC ), which is calculated by multiplying \nthe BI by a set of marginal coefficients ( \u03b1i); and  \n5.1.3  the Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM),  which is a scaling factor that is based on a \nbank\u2019s average historical losses and the BIC.  \n5.2 Business Indicator (BI)  \nThe BI shall be the summation of the following three constituents ,  \nBI = ILDC+SC+FC  \nWhere,  \nILDC is the Interest, Lea se and Dividend Component;  \n           SC is the Services Component ; and  \nFC is the Financial Component . \n \n \n \n                                                            \n3 Examples of recoveries are payments received from insurers , repayments received from perpetrators of \nfraud, and recoveries of misdirected transfers.   4 \n 5.3 Computation of ILDC, SC and FC  \nThe ILDC, SC and FC shall be computed as per  the formula below, where a bar \nabove a term ind icates that it is calculated as the average over three years4: t, t-1 \nand t-2, and:  \n\uf0d8 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc36=\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b   \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60  \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52                                                          ;2.25% \u00d7\n\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60                                    + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52                         \n\uf0d8 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc36=\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65  \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52                                  ;\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52                                      +\n \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65  \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52                 ;\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52                      \n\uf0d8 \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36= \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60  \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc43&\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc58                                        +\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc43&\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc58                                       ) \n \nWhere,  \nMax=Maximum,  \nMin=Minimum, and  \nAbs= Absolute value of sub -components irrespective of their signs (+ or -) \nThe description  for each of the se constituents  of the BI  is provided in Annex 1 .   \n5.4 Business Indicator Component (BIC)  \nThe BIC shall be  calculated  by multiplying the BI with the marginal coefficients ( \u03b1i), \n(which  increase with the size of the BI ) as shown in Table 1  below .  \nBI ranges and marginal coefficient s                                                           Table 1  \nBucket  BI Range (in \u20b9 crore)  BI Marginal Coefficients ( \u03b1i) \n1 \u22648000  12% \n2 8000<BI\u2264240000  15% \n3 >240000  18% \n \n                                                            \n4 BI components considered in the ORC calculations should be higher of those calculated on  a (i) rolling quarter \nbasis, and (ii) financial year (FY) basis . \nExample: Suppose a bank is calculating the ORC requirements for November 2022. It has higher BI on an FY \nbasis considering financials of FY22, FY21, and FY20 than on a rolling quarter basis considering financials for the \n12 month s period each ending Sep 22, Sep 21, and Sep 20. The bank should hold ORC requirements considering  \nthe financials of FY22, FY21, and  FY20 for BI computation.   5 \n 5.5 Internal Loss Multiplier  (ILM)  \n5.5.1 A bank\u2019s internal operational risk l oss experience affects the calculation of ORC  \nthrough the ILM . The ILM shall be calculated as given below,  \n \nWhere the Loss Component (LC) is equal to 15 times average annual operational risk \nlosses  as mentioned in paragraph 5.5.2 . \n5.5.2 The calculation o f average losses in the LC shall be based on 10 years of high -\nquality operational risk annual loss data. However , banks that do not have 10 years \nof high -quality loss data  but have five years  and above  of high -quality loss data shall \nmake use of such avail able high -quality loss data of five years and above to calculate \nthe LC. \n5.6 Operational Risk Capital  \n5.6.1  For b anks in (a) bucket 1, and (b) buckets 2 and 3 that do not have 5 years \nof high -quality operational risk annual loss data  \nThe ORC requirement s shall be  equal to  BIC, as defined in paragraph 5.4:  \n \nThe Reserve Bank (Department of Supervision)  may however require  bank s in \nbuckets 2 and 3 to calculate ORC requirement s using fewer than fi ve years of loss \ndata if the ILM is greater than 1 and  the supervisor believe s that  these losses are \nrepresentative of the bank\u2019s operational risk  exposure.  In such cases, ORC \nrequirement s shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph 5.6.2 . \n5.6.2  For b anks  in buckets 2 and 3 having 5 years  and above of high -quali ty \noperational risk annual loss data  \nThe ORC requirement s shall be  calculated  by multiplying the BI C (as defined in \nparagraph 5. 4) by the ILM (as defined in paragraph 5. 5):  \n \n \n ORC = BIC   6 \n  \nBanks in buckets 2 and 3  which do not meet the five years of high -quality loss data \ncriteria shall be required to hold ORC at a minimum equal to the BIC  (as defined in \nparagraph 5. 4). The Reserve Bank (Department of Supervision) may however require \nthe bank to apply an ILM which is greater than 1 to calculate ORC requirements. The \nexclusion of loss  data due to non -compliance with the  high-quality  loss data criteria , \nand the application of  any resulting multipliers, shall be publicly disclosed in \naccordance with the Pillar  3 requirements.  \n5.7  Risk -Weighted Assets  \nThe risk-weighted as sets (RWA) for operational risk shall be  calculated by multiplying \nthe ORC by 12.5 . \n6. Calculation of ORC  within  a banking group   \n6.1  At the consolidated level, the ORC  calculations shall be based on fully \nconsolidated BI figures , which net all the intragroup  income and expenses.  \n6.2  The ORC calculations at a sub -consolidated level shall be based on  BI figures for \nthe banks consolidated at that particular sub -level.  \n6.3  The ORC calculations at the subsidiary level shall be based on BI figures  from \nthe subsidiary.  \n6.4  A sub -consolidated bank or a subsidiary  of the  bank shall use only the losses it \nhas incurred at that particular sub -consolidated or subsidiary level for the ORC \ncalculations . \n6.5  When BI figures for sub -consolidated or subsidiary level reach bucket 2, bank s \nshall use loss experience in the ORC calculations as mentioned in paragraph  \n5.6.2. \n6.6  In case a subsidiary of a bank belonging to bucket 2 or higher does not meet the \nhigh-quality loss data criteria (as given in paragraph  9 of Part A ) or does not have \nfive years and above of high -quality operational risk annual loss data, the \nsubsidiary shall calculate the ORC requirements as mentioned in paragraph  5.6.2 \nor paragraph 5.6.1 as the case may be .  7 \n 7. Inclusion of BI items related to acquisitions  and mergers  \nBI items from acquired businesses or  merged entiti es over the three year s period  \nprior to the date of acquisition /merger  shall be included in the calculation of BI \ncomponent for ORC immediately after the acquisition /merger5 and shall be publicly \ndisclosed in accordance with  the Pillar 3  requirements .  \n8. Exclusion of divested activities from the BI  \nDivested activities shall be excluded from the calculation of the BI used for th e \ncalculation of ORC  only after the Reserve Bank \u2019s (Department of Supervision)  \napproval.  Such exclusions shall be publicly disclosed in accordance with  the Pillar 3  \nrequirements . \n9. High -quality l oss data identification, collection, and treatment for banks in \nbuckets 2 and 3 \n9.1 Identification and collection of the operational risk loss data shall be guided by \nthe criteria provided in  paragraph  1 of Anne x 2.  \n9.2 Inclusion of losses related to acquisitions  and mergers  \nOperational risk losses  of acquired businesses or merged entiti es over the ten years  \nperiod  prior to the acquisition /merg er shall  be included in the calculation of LC \ncomponent of ILM for ORC , immediately after the acquisition/merger and shall be \npublicly disclosed in accordance with the Pillar 3  requirements . \n9.3 Exclusion of losses  \n9.3.1 Losses  shall be excluded from the calculation of the ILM used for th e \ncalculation of ORC  only after the Reserve Bank \u2019s (Department of Supervision)  \napproval.   Banks  may request the Reserve Bank (Department of Supervision) to  \nexclude6 certain operational loss events that are no longer releva nt to their risk \n                                                            \n5 For example : Suppose bank A is merged with bank B with effect from July 1, 2021, BI for bank B calculated in \nJuly 2021 shall also include the financials of bank A (merged entity) for the (i) FY21, FY20, and FY19, or (ii) 12 \nmonth period each ending June 2021, June 2020, an d June 2019, whichever is higher.  \n6 For example : Banks may suffer operational risk losses related to the reform of benchmark reference rates, \nparticularly if they do not adequately prepare for the transition to the new rates. Losses may be incurred over  8 \n profiles. The exclusio n of loss events shall  be rare and supported by strong \njustification.  In evaluating the relevance of operational loss events to the  bank's risk \nprofile , the Reserve Bank (Department of Supervision) will evaluat e wheth er the \ncause of the loss event could o ccur in other areas of the bank\u2019 s operations. Taking \nsettled legal exposures and divested businesses a s examples, the Reserve Bank \nexpects the bank\u2019s  analysis to demonstrate that there is no similar or residual legal \nexposure and that the excluded loss experience has no relevance to other continuing \nactivities or products.  \n9.3.2 Exclusion of losses shall be  subject to a materiality threshold ( i.e., the excluded \nloss event shall  be greater than 5% of the bank\u2019s average losses ). In addition, losses \ncan only be excluded after being included in the bank\u2019s  operational risk loss \ndatabase for a minimum period ( i.e., three years ). Losses related to divested \nactivities shall not be subject ed to such minimum operational risk loss  database \nretention period.  \n9.3.3 The total loss amount and number of exclusions shall be publicly disclosed in \naccordance with the Pillar 3  requirements  with appropriate narratives, including total \nloss amount and number of exclusions.   \n10. Disclosure   \n10.1 All the BI sub -items for each of the three years of the BI component calculation \nwindow  shall be disclosed  in accordance with the Pillar 3 requirements.  \n10.2 For banks in buckets 2 and 3, annual loss data for each of the last ten years or \neach of the ye ars for which annual loss data  is available , shall be disclosed in \naccordance with the Pillar 3 requirements . Loss data shall be reported net of \nrecoveries , both before  and after loss exclusions.   \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nan extended period of time if banks fail to identify and remediate relevant legacy contracts prior to the \ndiscontinuation of a benchmark reference rate. To minimise the risk of operational risk losses, banks should \nconsider the effects of a benchmark rate re form on their businesses in a timely manner and make necessary \npreparations for the transition to alternative  reference  rates. In doing so, they should maintain a close dialogue \nwith the Reserve Bank (Department of Supervision) regarding their plans and tr ansition progress, including any \nidentified impediments.   9 \n 10.3 The disclosures on general qualitative information on a bank\u2019s operational risk \nframework and quantitative information on BI sub -items and  its sub -components as \nalso loss data shall be made as prescribed  in Anne x 3. \n11. Timelines for Compliance  \nBanks shall comply with the instructions contained in these Direc tions with effect from \nthe date, which will be communicated by the Reserve Bank of India, separately .  \n12. Repeal Provisions  \n12.1 With the coming into effect o f these Directions, the instructions/guidelines \ncontained in the following circulars issued by th e Reserve Bank stand repealed:  \n12.2 Notwithstanding the repeal unde r paragraph 12.1 of the repealed provisions, \nanything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken, or any \ndirection given or any proceeding taken or any penalty or fine imposed under the \nrepealed enactments shall, insofar as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of \nthese Directions , be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding \nprovisions of these Master Directions.

What shall be the criteria for identification and collection of the operational risk \nloss data  (high -quality loss data) ? \nThere shall be general criteria and specific criteria for identification and collection of the \noperational risk loss data as delineated below : \n1.1 General c riteria  on loss data identificati on, collection and treatment  \n1.1.1  Internal loss data are most relevant when clearly linked to a bank\u2019s current \nbusiness activities,  risk management procedures, and technological processes. \nTherefore, a bank shall document procedures and processes for the \nidenti fication, collection, and treatment of internal loss data . Such procedures \nand processes shall be subjected to validation  before the use of the loss data in \nthe operational risk capital measurement  methodology  and independent reviews, \nby internal  and/or external auditors  (at least annually)  as per the board -approved \npolicy of the bank . \n1.1.2  For risk management purposes, and to assist in supervisory validation and/or \nreview, Reserve Bank (Department of Supervision)  may require  a bank to map its \nhistorical interna l loss data into the relevant Level 1 and 2 supervisory categories \nas defined in Annex 4 and to provide this data to Reserve Bank (Department of \nSupervision) . The criteria for allocating losses to the specified event types  shall \nbe documented . \n1.1.3  A bank\u2019s int ernal loss data shall be comprehensive and capture all activities and \nexposures from all appropriate subsystems and geographic locations. Such loss \ndata shall also include the operational risk -related losses emanating from \noutsourced activities8. The minim um threshold for including a loss event in the \ndata set is set at \u20b91, 00,0009.  \n                                                            \n8 e.g. Operational risk -related losses emanating from Direct Sales Agents/ Direct Marketing Agents , Business \nCorrespondents , etc.  appointed by the bank.  \n9 Some operational loss events result in multiple accounting impacts, which can be loss impacts or recoveries. To \ndetermine whether an operational loss event sh ould be included in the Loss Component calculation dataset, the \nnet loss amount of the event shall be calculated by summing all the loss impacts and subtracting all recoveries \npertaining to the event, inside the ten -year calculation window. The accounting date of the impacts is used to  \n 14 \n 1.1.4  In addition to the information on gross loss amounts, the bank shall collect \ninformation about the reference dates of operational risk events, including the \ndate when the event happened (\u201cdate of occurrence\u201d), where available; the date \non which the bank became aware of the event (\u201cdate of discovery\u201d); and the date \n(or dates) when a loss event results in a loss, reserve or provision against a loss \nbeing recognised in the bank\u2019s pr ofit and loss (P&L) accounts (\u201cdate of \naccounting\u201d). The bank shall also collect information on recoveries of gross loss \namounts as well as descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the loss \nevent10. The details of  any descriptive information s hall be commensurate with \nthe size of the gross loss amount.  \n1.1.5  While building a loss data set from a foreign subsidiary of a bank, loss impacts \ndenominated in a foreign currency shall be converted using the same exchange \nrate that is used to convert them in the bank\u2019s financial statements of the period \nin which the loss impacts are accounted for.  \n1.1.6  Operational loss events related to credit risk and that are accounted for in credit \nRWA shall not be included in the operational loss data set. Operational loss \nevents that relate to credit risk but are not accounted for in credit RWA shall be \nincluded in the operational loss data set.  \n1.1.7  Operational risk losses related to market risk shall be included in the operational \nloss data set.  Few examples of such losses are risk posed due to fat - finger \nerror11, the crash of algorithm in algorithmic trading , unauthorised trading \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \ndetermine whether they are inside the ten -year calculation window. If the event\u2019s net total loss amount is equal to  \nor above \u20b91,00,000, the loss event shall be included in the calculation dataset. Note that a loss event may not \nresu lt in a net loss amount above \u20b9 1,00,000 in any individual year and still have to be included in the loss dataset \nas long as the cumulative impact of the loss event in the ten-year window is equal to or above \u20b9 1,00,000.  \nFor e xample , for a ten-year  period (2012 to 2021) window, suppose one loss even t results in a loss impact of \n\u20b996,000 in 2012 and \u20b9 7,000 in 2013. This loss event shall be includ ed in the calculation dataset because its total \nimpact ins ide the calculation window is \u20b9 1,03,000. On the other hand, a loss event that  resulted in a loss impact of \n\u20b910,00,000 in 2010 (outside of the ten y ear window), a loss impact of \u20b9 300,000 in 2013 (ins ide the calculati on \nwindow), and a recovery of \u20b9 5,00,000 in 2015 (inside the calculation window) shall not be included in the loss \ndataset.  \n10 Tax effects (e.g. reductions in corporate income tax liability due to operational losses) shall not be treated as \nrecoveries.  \n11 An error caused by a human, as opposed to a computer, in which the wrong information is inputted   \n 15 \n activities , frequent breaches in trading limit , unauthorised remote access for \nsettling the positions , etc.  \n1.1.8  Banks shall  have processes to independently review the accuracy and \ncomprehensiveness of loss data.  \n1.2 Specific criteria on loss data identification, collection and treatment   \n1.2.1 Building loss data set  \nBuilding an acceptable loss data set from the available internal data requires that the \nbank develops policies and procedures to address several features, including gross loss \ndefinition, reference date and grouped losses.  \n1.2.2 Gross loss, net loss, and recovery  \n1.2.2.1 Banks shall identify the gross loss amounts, non -insurance recoveries, and \ninsurance recoveries for all operational loss events. Banks shall use losses net of \nrecoveries (including insurance recoveries) in the loss dataset. However, recoveries can \nbe used to reduce losses only after the bank receives payment. Receivables do not \ncount as recoveries. The data and evidence  on recoveries  used  to net off losses shall \nbe provided to the Reserve Bank  (Department of Supervision) upon request .   \n1.2.2.2 The following items shall be included in the gross loss computation of the loss \ndata se t:  \n(a) Direct charges, including impairments and settlements, to the bank\u2019s P&L accounts \nand write -downs due to the operational risk event;  \n(b) Costs incurred as a consequence of the event including external expenses with a \ndirect link to the operational risk ev ent (e .g. legal expenses directly related to the \nevent and fees paid to advisors, attorneys or suppliers) and costs of repair or \nreplacement, incurred to restore the position that was prevailing before the \noperational risk event  (without considering recove ry, depreciation , and provision );   \n 16 \n (c) Provisions12 or reserves accounted for in the P&L against the potential operational \nloss impact;  \n(d) Losses stemming from operational risk events with a definitive financial impact, \nwhich are temporarily booked in transitory or suspense accounts and are not yet \nreflected in the P&L (\u201c Pending losses\u201d). Pending losses of \u20b91,00,000 and above  \nshall be included in the loss data set within a time period commensurate with the \nage of the pending item; and \n(e) Negative economic impacts booked in a financial accounting period, due to \noperational risk events impacting the cash flows  or financial statements of previous \nfinancial accounting periods (\u201c Timing losses\u201d).13 Timing losses  of \u20b91,00,000 and \n                                                            \n12 When a bank makes a provision due to an operational loss event, such provision shall  be considered  as an \noperational loss immediately. When a charge -off (such as a settlement) eventually takes place later, only the \ndifference between the initial provision and the charge -off (if any) shall  be added to the operational loss \ncalculation.  \nExample  1, if a bank makes a provision of \u20b9 1 crore for a leg al event in FY 2017-18 and then settles the legal event \nfor \u20b9 1.20 crore in FY 2018 -19, it shall include the provision of \u20b9 1 crore in the operational loss data of  FY 2017 -18 \nand the additional \u20b9 20 lakh in the operational loss data of FY 2018-19 (equal to  the \u20b9 1.20 crore settlement in FY \n2018 -19 minus the \u20b9 1 crore provision in FY 2017 -18). There shall be no double counting of the same financial \nimpacts in the calculation of operational losses.  \nExample 2 , If a bank provided \u20b9 2,00,000 for the operational r isk loss in FY 2014 -15 and the same is included in the \nloss data set of the year.  \n(i) Scenario 1  \nIf recovery of \u20b950 ,000 happens in FY 201 6-17, the bank has to include \u20b9 50,000 as a recovery in FY 2016 -17. Thus, \nloss data is updated without changing the los s originally reported in FY 2014 -15. \n(ii) Scenario 2  \nEven i f recovery of \u20b9 2,50,000 happens in FY 2016 -17, th e bank has to include \u20b9 2,00,000 only  as a recovery in FY \n2016 -17. Thus, loss data is updated without changing the loss originally reported in FY 201 4-15. \nHowever, in both scenarios (i) and (ii), the bank cannot include recoveries made against the loss that does not \nfeature in 10 years window i.e. the bank cannot use recoveries of \u20b9 50,000 (scenario 1) and \u20b9 250000 (scenario 2) \nfrom FY 2025 -26 onwards as  the originally reported loss of \u20b92 ,00,000 falls out of 10 years window from FY 2025 -26 \nonwards.  \n13 Timing impacts typically relate to the occurrence of operational risk events that result in the temporary \ndistortion of an ins titution\u2019s financial accounts ( e.g. revenue overstatement, accounting errors and mark -to-market \nerrors). While these events do not represent a true financial impact on the institution (net impact over time is \nzero), if the error continues across more than one financial year , it may repr esent a material misrepresentation of \nthe institution\u2019s financial statements.   \nExample 1  - when a bank refunds a client that was overbilled due to an operational failure, if the refund is \nprovided in the same financial accounting period as the overbilling  took place and thus no misrepresentation of \nthe institution\u2019s financial statements occurs, there is no operational loss. If the refund occurs in a subsequent \nfinancial accounting period to the overbilling, it is a timing loss; any operational loss event t hat exceeds the  \n 17 \n above  shall be included in the loss data set when they are due to operational risk \nevents that span more than one financial accounting peri od.  \n1.2.2.3 The following items shall be excluded from the gross loss computation of the \nloss data set:  \n(a) Costs of general maintenance contracts on property, plant or equipment;  \n(b) Internal or external expenditures to enhance the business after the operational  risk \nlosses: upgrades, improvements, risk assessment initiatives and enhancements; \nand \n(c) Insurance premiums.  \n1.2.2.4 Banks shall use the date of accounting for building the loss data set including \nlosses related to legal events. For legal loss events, the d ate of accounting is the date \nwhen a legal reserve is established for the probable estimated loss in the P&L.  \n1.2.2. 5 Losses caused by a common operational risk event14 or by related operational \nrisk events13 which occur over time, but posted to the acc ounts over several years, shall  \nbe allocated to the corresponding years of the loss database, in line with their \naccounting treatment.  \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nthreshold of \u20b91,00,000 shall  be included in the loss data  set. In this case, the prior overbilling shall  not be \nconsidered as a recovery.  \nExample 2 - An excess processing fee of \u20b91,20,000 charged to a customer in February 2022 and refunded in April \n2022 will result in a material misrepresentation of the bank\u2019s financial statements and should be  included in the \nloss data set  of FY 2021 -22. \n14 All operational losses caused by a common underlying trigger or root cause shall be grouped into one \noperational loss event in a bank\u2019s operational loss event dataset. Two examples of losses with a common \nunderlying trigger or root cause, which should be grouped into a single loss event:  \n(i) A natural disaster causes losses in multiple locations or across an e xtended time period.  \n(ii) A breach of a bank\u2019s information security results in the disclosure of confidential customer information. As a \nresult, multiple customers incur fraud -related losses that the bank must reimburse. This is sometimes \naccompanied by remedia tion expenses such as credit card re -issue or credit history monitoring services.  \nBanks shall have a clear, well -documented policy for determining the criteria for multiple losses to be grouped into \nan operational loss event. In addition, processes shall b e in place to ensure that there is a firm -wide understanding \nof the loss event grouping policy, that there is appropriate sharing of loss event data across businesses to \nimplement the policy effectively and that there are adequate controls (including indep endent review) to assess \nongoing compliance with the policy.   \n 18 \n Annex  3 \n \nDisclosure requirements for operational risk  \nTemplate ORA: General Qualitative information on a bank\u2019s operationa l risk \nframework15 \nFrequency of disclosure - Annual  \nBanks shall describe:  \n1. Their policies, frameworks and guidelines for the management of operational risk.  \n2. The structure and organisation of their operational risk management and control \nfunction.  \n3. Their operat ional risk measurement system (i .e. the systems and data used to \nmeasure operational risk in order to estimate the operational risk capital charge).  \n4. The scope and main context of their reporting framework on operational risk to \nexecutive management and to the Board of Directors . \n5. The risk mitigation and risk transfer used in the management of operational risk. This \nincludes mitigation by policy (such as the policies on risk culture, risk appetite, and \noutsourcing), by divesting from high -risk businesses, and  by the establishment of \ncontrols. The remaining exposure can then be absorbed by the bank or transferred. \nFor instance, the impact of operational losses can be mitigated with insurance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n15 Refer to Part B of these Directions .  \n 19 \n Template OR 116: Historical losses  \nFrequency of disclosure: A nnual  \nMinimum t hreshold for collection of loss data : \u20b91,00,000 \nBanks are expected to supplement the template with narrative commentary explaining \nthe rationale in aggregate, for new loss exclusions since the previous disclosure.

The banks are encouraged to comply with the:  \n1.1 \u2018Guidance Note on Management of Operational Risk \u2019 issued by t he Reserve Bank in \nOctober 2005;   \n1.2 \u2018Revisions to the Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk \u2019 issued \nby the Basel Com mittee on Banking Supervision  (BCBS)  in March 2021 ; and \n1.3 \u2018Principles for Operational Resilience\u2019 issued by the BCBS in March 2021 . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n 27 \n Part C  \nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  \n1. Whether banks are required to undertake a parallel run with res pect to Basel III \nSA? (Para graph  2.2 of Part A ) \nNo.  \n2. What should be the ORC requirements in case the ORC calculated under Basel \nIII SA is lesser than those calculated under Basic Indicator Approach (BIA)? \n(Paragraphs  2.2 and 2.3 of Part A ) \nAll the exist ing operational risk approaches would be  replaced by Basel III SA  with \ncoming into effect of the Directions contained in Part A . Hence, a comparison of ORC \nrequirements calculated using Basel III SA and the discontinued approaches including \nBIA shall not b e required. Hence, banks shall calculate ORC requirements using Basel \nIII SA only.  \n3. How the ILM should be calculated when a bank does not have ten years of \nhigh -quality loss data but has such data for six years? (Para graph  5.5.2  of Part A ) \nIf a bank has six years of high -quality loss data, it shall make use of such six years of \ndata for ILM calculation provided such loss data meet s the criteria delineated in \nparagraph  9 of Part A . In the following year (7th year), the bank shall make use of seven \nyears of  high-quality loss data and would do so for the subsequent three years i.e., up \nto ten years (subject to meeting the abovementioned criteria) for ILM calculation. \nThereafter, it shall use the high -quality loss data for the past ten years.  \n4. What should th e marginal coefficient (\u03b1i) be when a sub -consolidated bank or \nsubsidiary bank falling in bucket 2 on a standalone basis migrates to bucket 3 on \na group basis?  (Para graph 6.5  of Part A ) \nIf a sub -consolidated bank or subsidiary bank falling in bucket 2 on a standalone basis \nmigra tes to bucket 3 on a group basis, it shall use marginal coefficient ( \u03b1i) as applicable  \n 28 \n for bucket 2 at that sub -consolidated or subsidiary level, and bucket 3 at the \nconsolidated/ group level.  \n5. Whether the Income and expenses arising from brokering of i nsurance \nproducts should be included in the BI of a bank? (Note  to Annex 1  and Para graph  \n1.2.2.3 (c), Annex 2  of Part A ) \nWhen a bank acts as an intermediary that brokers insurance products, it shall include \nthe income and expenses attributable to such brok erage into its BI.  \n6. What is the example of operational loss events related to credit risk and \naccounted for in credit RWA which does not form part of the operational loss data \nset? (Para graph  1.1.6, Annex 2  of Part A ) \nCredit -related losses owing to any operational risk event such as fraud in an account \nshould not be included in the operational risk loss data set provided that such losses \nhave been provided for or considered in credit RWA as per extant instructions.  \nHowever, when a bank securitises its as sets i.e. assets that are not on its books, it is \nstill exposed to operational risk due to the presence of clauses such as representations \nand warranties, clean -up calls in the securitisation agreement , etc.  If such losses are \ncrystallised, the bank shall include them in the operational loss data set if they are \nneither provided f or nor considered in credit RWA.  \n7. How an eligible loss event missed out earlier but identified in subsequent years \nshould be included in the loss data set?  (Para graph  1.2.1 and 1 .2.2.5 , Annex 2  of \nPart A ) \nThe Reserve Bank expects that a bank\u2019s data collection and reporting procedures and \nprocesses capture all operational risk losses over  the threshold of \u20b91,00,000. However, \nif a bank excludes any eligible loss data event due to commission or omission errors or \nany other reason, it shall include such missed out data in the loss data set in the \nsubsequent year by making necessary correction s for the relevant year. Such data shall \nbe included in the loss data set from the year to which it pertains till ten years from the \nyear of detection of such missed out event.   \n 29 \n For example, suppose a bank missed out on an eligible operational risk event of \u20b915 \nlakh that occurred in the financial year (FY) 2014 -15 from inclusion in the loss data set \nof the year. Subsequently, it detected such a loss event in FY 2018 -19. The bank, in its \nloss data for FY 2018 -19 (as per the table given below), shall include  such a loss event \nfrom FY 2014 -15 onwards.  \n                  (Amount in \u20b9 lakh)  \nFinancial Year  Loss data for FY \n2018 -19 before \nmissed out event  Missed out event \nof FY 2014 -15 \ndetected in FY \n2018 -19 Loss data for FY \n2018 -19 \nconsidering \nmissed out event  \n2009 -10 50 - 50 \n2010 -11 70 - 70 \n2011 -12 80 - 80 \n2012 -13 60 - 60 \n2013 -14 120 - 120 \n2014 -15 130 15 145 \n2015 -16 140 15 155 \n2016 -17  110 15 125 \n2017 -18  150 15 165 \n2018 -19  100 15 115 \nThe bank shall include such a loss event of \u20b915 lakh in the loss d ata till FY 2027 -28 (i.e. \n10 years from the year of detection) even though it falls beyond 10 -year window (till FY \n2023 -24) from the year of the missed -out event (FY2014 -15).   \n \nThese FAQs are not to be construed as a legal advice or as enforceable and are \nissued for information and general guidance purposes only. The Reserve Bank  of \nIndia  will not be held responsible for actions taken and/or decisions made based \non the se FAQs . For clarifications or interpretations, if any, one may be guided by \nthe relevant  circulars and notifications issued from time to time by the Reserve \nBank  of India .  \n \n  \n 30 \n Part D  \nIllustrations  \n1. How  items of  BI-sub components shall be averaged over three years?  \n(Para graph  5.3 of Part A)  \nThe absolute value of net items (e.g. interest incom e \u2013 interest expense) shall be \ncalculated first year -by-year. Only after this  year-by-year calculation should  the average \nof the three years be calculated.  This has been explained in the illustration given below  \nIllustration -I \nSuppose, for a particular ban k the values of items of BI sub -components for three years \nperiod are as given below:  \n(Amount in  \u20b9 crore)  \nYear  Interest \nIncome  Interest \nExpense  Abs (Interest Income -\nInterest Expense)  \nJan 2018 - Dec 2018  3,000 3,500 500 \nJan 2019 - Dec 2019  3,500 3,200 300 \nJan 2020 - Dec 2020  4,000 3,600 400 \nThe average of absolute value of the above item of BI sub -component shall be \u20b9400 \ncrore ((500+300+400)/3)  \n2. How the BIC shall be calculated? (Para graph  5.4 of Part A)  \nFor banks in the first bucket (i.e. with a BI less t han or equal to \u20b98,000 crore), the BIC \nshall be  equal to BI x 12%. The marginal increase in the BIC resulting from a one -unit \nincrease in the BI is 12% in bucket 1, 15% in bucket 2 and 18% in bucket 3.  This has \nbeen explained in the illustration given belo w \n \n  \n 31 \n Illustration -II \nIf for a particular bank, BI = \u20b93 ,50,000 crore, then BIC shall be calculated as given \nbelow  \nBIC = (8,000 x 12%) + (2 ,40,000-8,000) x 15% + (3 ,50,000-2,40,000) x 18%  \n         = \u20b955,560 crore. \n \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/103MDCAPITALREQUIREMENTS50C9076B7D494F259CC908D618297293.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 23, 2023", "info": "\ufffd\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940\u092f  \u092c\u093e\u095b\u093e\u0930  \ufffd\u0935\ufffd\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928  \ufffd\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 ,\u0915\ufffd \u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd \u092f  \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928 , \u0928\u094c\u0935\u0940\u0902 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932, \u0936\u0939\ufffd\u0926  \u092d\u0917\u0924  \ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908\u2013400001. \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924  \n\u092b\u094b\u0928: (91-22) 2260 1000 ,\u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938: (91-22) 22702290 \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932: cgmfmrd@rbi.org.in  \nFinancial Markets Regulation Department, Central Office Building, 9th Floor, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort, Mumbai \u2013 400001.

With a \nview to provide further impetus to resolution of stressed assets in the system  as well as  to \nrationalise and harmonise the instructions across  all REs, as announced in the Statement on \nDevelopmental and Regulatory Policies released on June 8, 2023, it has been decided to \nissue  a comprehensive regulatory framework governing compromise settlements  and \ntechnical write -offs covering all the REs , as detailed in the Annex .  \n2. The provisions of this framework shall be applicable to all REs to which this circular is \naddressed and shall be without prejudice to the provisions of the Prudential Framework, or \nany other guidelines applicable to the REs on resolution of stressed assets.  \n3. These instructions on operationalising the framework have been issued in exercise of the \npowers conferred by the Sections 21 and 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 read with \nSection 56 of the Banking Regulation Ac t, 1949; Chapter IIIB of the Reserve Bank of India \nAct, 1934 and Sections 30A, 32 and 33 of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987. They  shall \ncome into force with immediate effect and REs shall take necessary steps to ensure \ncompliance with these instructi ons. \nYours faithfully, \n \n(Manoranjan Mishra)  \nChief General Manager  \n \nAnnex \nFramework for Compromise Settlements and Technical Write-offs  \nBoard -approved policy  \n1. Regulated Entities (REs)  shall put in place Board-approved policies for undertaking  \ncompromise settlements  with the borrowers  as well as for technical write- offs.  \nCompromise settlement for this purpose shall refer to any negotiated \narrangement with the borrower  to fully1 settle the claims  of the RE  against the \nborrower in cash; it may entail some sacrifice of the amount due from the \nborrower  on the part of the REs with corresponding waiver of  claims of the RE \nagainst the borrower  to that extent.   \nTechnical write-off for this purpose shall refer to cases where the non-\nperforming assets remain outstanding at borrowers\u2019 loan account level , but are \nwritten-off (fully or partially) by the RE only for accounting purposes, without \ninvolv ing any waiver of claim s against the borrower , and without prejudice to \nthe recovery of the same.  \n \n2. The Board approved policy shall  comprehensively lay down the process to be followed \nfor all compromise settlements and technical write -offs, with specific guidance on the \nnecessary conditions precedent such as minimum ageing, deterioration in collateral \nvalue etc. The policies shall also put in place a  graded framework for examination of \nstaff accountability in such cases  with reasonable thresholds and timelines as may be \ndecided by the Board.  \n \n3. In respect of compromise settlements , the poli cy shall inter alia contain provisions \nrelating to permissible sacrifice for various categ ories of exposures  while arriving at \nthe settlement amount, after prudently reckoning the current realisable value of \nsecurity/collateral, where available.  The methodology for arriving at the realisable \nvalue of the security shall also form part of the policy. The objective shall be to \nmaximise the possible recovery from a distressed borrower at minimum expense, in \nthe best interest of the RE .  \n \n4. The compromise settlements and technical write-offs shall be without prejudice to any \nmutually agreed contractual provisions  between the RE and the borrower relating to \nfuture contingent realizations  or recovery by the RE, subject to such claims not being \n                                                            \n1 Any arrangement involving part settlement with the borrower shall fall under the definition of \nrestructuring, as defined in the Prudential Framework  and shall be governed by the provisions \napplicable thereto.  \n recognised in any manner on the balance sheet of REs at the time of the settlement or \nsubsequently till actual realization of such receivables . Any such claims recognised on \nthe balance sheet of the RE shall render the arr angement to be treated as restructuring \nin terms of paragraph 7  of this circular.  \n \nDelegation of Power  \n5. The aforesaid policy shall also cover the delegation of powers for approval/sanction of \ncompromise settlements and technical write-offs.   \n \n6. In respect of compromise settlements, it shall be ensured that: \n(i) delegation of power for such approvals rests with an authority (individual or \ncommittee, as the case may be) which is at least one level higher in hierarchy \nthan the authority vested with power to sanction the credit / investment exposure.  \nProvided that any  official who was part of  sanctioning  the loan (as \nindividual or part of a committee) shall not be part of the approving the \nproposal for compromise settlement of the same loan account, in any \ncapacity . \n \n(ii) proposals for compromise settlements in respect of debtors classified as fraud \nor wilful defaulter, as permitted in terms of clause 13 of this Annex, shall require \napproval of the Board in all cases.  \n \nPrudential treatment  \n7. Compromise settlements where the time for payment of the agreed settlement amount \nexceeds three months  shall be treated as restructuring as defined in terms of the  \nPrudential framework on Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7, 2019.  \n \n8. In case of partial technical write-offs, the prudential requirements in respect of residual exposure, including provisioning and asset classification, shall be with reference to the  \noriginal exposure,  \nProvided that the amount of provision including the amount representing partial \ntechnical write-off shall meet the extant provisioning requirements, as computed on the gross value of the asset.  \n \nReporting Mechanism  \n9. There shall be a reporting mechanism to the next higher authority, at least on a \nquarterly basis, with respect to compromise settlements  and technical  write offs \napproved by a particular authority. Compromise settlements and technical  write -offs \napproved by the MD & CEO / Board Level Committee would be reported to the Board.  \n Oversight by the Board \n10. The Board shall mandate a suitable reporting format so as to ensure adequate \ncoverage of the following aspects at the minimum: (i) trend in number of accounts and \namounts subjected to compromise settlement and/or technical  write -off (q-o-q and y -\no-y); (ii) out of (i) above, separate breakup of accounts classified as f raud, red-Flagged, \nwilful default and q uick mortality  accounts ; (iii) amount-wise ,  sanctioning authority -\nwise, and business segment / asset -class wise grouping of such accounts ; (iv) extent \nof recovery in technically written-off accounts .  \n \n Cooling Period \n11. In respect of borrowers subject to compromise settlements , there shall be a cooling \nperiod as determined by the respective Board approved policies before the REs can \nassume fresh exposures  to such borrowers .  \nProvided that:  \n(i) The cooling period in respect of exposures other than farm credit exposures \nshall be  subject to a floor of 12 months . REs are free to stipulate higher cooling \nperiods in terms of their Board approved policies.  \n(ii) The cooling period for farm credit exposures shall be determined by the REs \nas per their respective Board approved policies.  \n \nFarm credit for the above purpose shall refer to credit extended to agricultural activities \nas listed in Annex 2 to the Master Circular - Prudential norms on Income Recognition, \nAsset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances  as amended from time to \ntime. \n \n12. The cooling period to be adopted in respect of exposures subjected to technical write-\noffs shall be as per the Board approved policies  of the REs . \n \nTreatment of accounts categorized as fraud and wilful default er \n13. REs may undertake compromise settlements  or technical write-offs in respect of \naccounts categorised as wilful defaulters  or fraud without prejudice to the criminal \nproceeding underway against such debtors .  \n \nOther legal provisions \n14. The compromise settlements  with the borrowers under the above framework shall be \nwithout prejudice to the provisions of any other statute in force.  \n \n15. Further, w herever REs had commenced recovery proceedings under a judicial forum  \nand the same is pending before such judicial forum , any settlement arrived at with the \nborrower  shall be subject to obtaining a consent decree from the concerned judicial \nauthorities.   \n \n \n                         L ist of circulars that stand repealed with immediate effect  \nSl. \nNo Circular Number  Date of \nIssue Subject  \n1 DBOD.No.BP.BC.81/21.01.040/\n95 (excluding Paragraph 2)  28.07.1995  Compromise or Negotiated \nSettlements of Non-Performing \nAssets (NPAs)  \n2 DBOD.BP.BC.55/21.04.117/ \n2007-08 30.11.2007  Guidelines on Settlement of \nNon-Performing Assets \u2013  \nObtaining Consent Decree from \nCourt  \n3 DBOD.BP.BC.No.112/ \n21.04.048/2009-10 21.06.2010  Compromise/Negotiated/One \nTime settlement of Non -\nPerforming  Assets  \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/FRAMEWORKCOMPROMISE97202CBAA1374268BA9AAA616D239890.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 08, 2023", "info": "_____________________________________________________________________________________  \n\ufffd\u0935\ufffd\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928  \ufffd\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917,\u0915\ufffd\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f ,\u0915\ufffd\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f  \u092d\u0935\u0928,12\u0935\u0940\u0902/13\u0935\u0940\u0902 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u095b\u0932,\u0936\u0939\ufffd\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d,\u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d,\u092e\u0941\u092c\u0908 -  400001  \n\u091f\u0947\u0932\ufffd\u092b\u094b\u0928/ Tel No: 22661602, 22601000 \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938 / Fax No: 022- 2270 5691  \nDepartment of Regulation,  Central Office, Central Office Building, 12th/ 13th Floor, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort,  \nMumbai \u2013 400001  \n\ufffd\u0939\u0902\u0926\ufffd \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928  \u0939\u0948, \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e  \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u094b\u0917  \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0907\u090f   \n  \n  \nRBI/202 3-24/ 39 \nDOR.REG.No. 19/07.01.000/2023-24                       June 08, 2023 \nManaging Director / Chief Executive Officer  \nAll Primary  (Urban) Co- operative Banks (except Salary Earners\u2019 Banks)  \nMadam / Dear Sir \nRationalization of Branch Authorisation Policy for  Urban Co- operative Banks \n(UCBs)  \nA reference is made to the circular on the revised criteria for classifying a UCB as \nFinancially Sound and Well Managed (FSWM) issued by RBI vide  circular \nDOR.REG.No.85/07.0 1.000/2022 -23 dated December 01, 2022 on  \u201cReview of norms for \nclassification of Urban Co- operative Banks (UCBs) as Financially Sound and Well \nManaged (FSWM) \u201d. \n2.  In order to rationalise the process of branch opening and to enable the UCBs to tap \ngrowth opportunities in the sector, it has been decided to grant general permission for \nbranch expansion in the approved area of operation to financially strong UCBs. This is  as \nper the  Revised Regulatory Framework for Urban Co- operative Banks (UCBs) released \nby RBI on July 19, 2022  based on the recommendation of the Expert Committee on \nPrimary (Urban) Co -operative Banks . The details of the scheme are provided in Annex -I. \n3.  In addition to the general permission, the branch expansion under the prior  approval \nroute as per the existing framework will also continue, as hitherto, for other eligible UCBs. \nHowe ver, the process has been simplified to reduce the time taken for granting approvals \nfor opening new branches, the details of which are provided in Annex -II.  \n \n2 \n  \n  Commencement  \n4. The revised instructions shall come into force with immediate effect.  \nApplicability  \n5. This circular is applicable to all Primary (Urban) Co -operative Banks  (except Salary \nEarners\u2019 Banks) . \n \n \n(Prakash Baliarsingh)   \nChief General Manager  \n  3 \n Annex-I \n \nBranch Authorization Policy for Urban Co- operative Banks (UCBs) \u2013 General \nPermission \nThe general permission of branch expansion in the approved area of operation will be \navailable to UCBs in all Tiers (except Salary Earners\u2019 Banks)  which comply with \napplicable Financial ly Sound and Well Managed ( FSWM ) criteria.  \n2. The eligible  FSWM UCBs shall put in place a policy, approved by their Board of \nDirectors  for opening branches . The policy should be formulated keeping in view the \nfinancial health of the bank, viability study of the new branches  and customer service and \nmust be updated periodically to keep it aligned with revised RBI guidelines. The eligible  \nUCBs are permitted to open new branches up t o 10 per cent of the number of full-fledged  \nbranches (at the end of previous financial year) in a financial year, subject to a maximum \nof five branches  without having the need to take permission from Reserve Bank of India. \nHowever, if the total number of full -fledged branches (at the end of previous financial \nyear) is less than 10, the bank will be eligible  to open at least  one branch.  Further, the \nUCBs shall ensure that the proposal for opening of such branches  in a particular financial \nyear,  based on their policy , is duly approved by their Board of Directors . It is clarified that \nthe banks have the liberty to either open a new branch or upgrade an Extension Counter , \nwhich has been in operation for more than three years,  to a full -fledged branch, within the \noverall limit of 10 percent. Opening of Extension counters, Controlling Offices (Regional/ \nZonal/ Administrative Office),  ATMs etc. is not covered under this route and they  will \ncontinue to be governed by extant guidel ines.   \n3. UCBs shall report to concerned Regional Office of Department of Supervision (Central \nOffice, in case of UCBs under jurisdiction of Mumbai office) of the Reserve Bank, immediately and in any case not later than 15 calendar  days,  after opening of the branch \ncomplying with all the rules,  as per the format given in Annex -III\n. The UCBs shall also \nsubmit the details on the Central Information System for Banking Infrastructure (CISBI) \nportal as per extant instructions.  \n  4 \n Annex- II \nBranch Authorization  Policy for Urban Co -operative Banks (UCBs) \u2013 Timelines for \nAnnual Business Plan (ABP)  under Prior Approval Route  \nAs per  Master Circular  RBI/2015- 16/62 DCBR.LS.(PCB)MC.No.16/07.01.000/2015- 16 \ndated July 1, 2015 e l igible UCBs  have been advised to prepare an Annual Business Plan \n(ABP) for opening of branches (including extension counters and up- gradation of \nextension counters into full -fledged branches ), in their existing area of operation, for the \nnext financial year, with the approval of their Board of Directors and submit the ABP to \nthe respective Regional Offices of the Reserve Bank of India, preferably by end of \nDecember of the previous financial year. In order to reduce the time taken for opening \nnew branches, the following revised timelines must be ensured.  \nSl.No . Activity  Timeline  \n1. Submission of ABP by \nUCBs  ABP may be submitted preferably by November of \nprevious financial year and in any case, not later \nthan 15th December of previous financial year.  \n2. Allocation of Centres by \nRBI RBI will allocate centres  within 90 calendar days  of \nreceipt of complete ABP. \n3. Application for \nAuthorization The bank must approach RBI within 90 calendar \ndays from date of allocation of centre in the \nprescribed Form V, indicating the exact postal \naddress of the place where the branch is to be \nopened,  to obtain valid authorization.  \n4. Authorization provided \nby RBI RBI will provide authorization  for new branches \nwithin 30 calendar days  of receipt of complete \napplication.  \n5. Validity of Authorization  The authorization will be valid for 180 calendar days \nfrom date of issue or 360 calendar  days from date \nof allocation of centre, whichever is earlier.  \n 5 \n 2. While there is no requirement of submission of exact location of branch at the time of \nsubmission of ABP, UCBs should try to firm up their plans for opening branches at  the \nrequested cent res well in advance to quicken the process of opening the branches. The \nbanks may, at their discretion, include the address of their proposed branch in ABP.

The \nguidelines allow financing / discounting of MSME receivables on \u201cwithout recourse\u201d basis by permitted financiers. Currently , three entities operate TReDS platforms  in the country ; one more \nentity has also been given in-principl e authorisation to operate such platform . \n \n2. Based on the experience gained, and as  announced in the Statement on Developmental  \nand Regulatory Policies dated February 8, 2023 , it has been dec ided to make the following \nenhancements to the TReDS guidelines  : \n \na) Facilitate  insurance for transactions  : Financiers place their bids on the TReDS platforms \nkeeping in view the credit rating of buyers. They  are generally not inclined to bid for payables \nof low rated buyers. To overcome this, insurance  facility is being permitted for TReDS \ntransactions , which would aid financiers to hedge default risks, subject to the following:  \ni. Apart from MSME sellers, buyers and financiers, insurance companies are permitted \nto participate as \u201cfourth participant\u201d in TReDS.  \nii. In their business / operational rules, the TReDS platform operators  may specify the \nstage at which insurance facility can be availed. \niii. Premium for insurance shall not be levied on the MSME seller.   \n iv. Collection of premium and related activities  could be enabled through National \nAutomated Clearing House (NACH) system used for settlement of TReDS transactions. \nv. Based on consent received from financiers and insurance companies, TReDS \nplatforms could facilitate automated processing of insurance claims  and s pecify \ntimelines for their settlement  through the NACH system.  \nvi. As of now, the credit insurance shall not be treated as a C redit Risk Mitigant (CRM) to \navail any prudential benefits.  \n \nb) Expand the pool of financiers  : TReDS  transactions fall under the ambit of \u201cfactoring \nbusiness\u201d, and banks, NBFC -Factors and other financial institutions (as permitted by RBI) \ncan presently participate as financiers in TReDS. The Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 (FRA) \nallows certain other entities / institutions to undertake factoring transactions. Accordingly, all entities / institutions allowed to undertake factoring business under FRA and the rules / regulations made thereunder, are now permitted to participate as financiers in TReDS. This \nwould augment availability of financiers on TReDS platforms.   \n \nc) Enable secondary market for Factoring Units ( FUs) : TReDS guidelines provide for the \ndiscounted / financed FUs  to have a secondary market, which is, however, not introduced \nyet. Given the experience gained, TReDS platform operators may, at their discretion, enable \na secondary market for transfer of FUs  within the same TReDS platform . Such transfers \nshall, however, be subject to the applicable provisions of RBI\u2019s \u2018 Master Direction \u2013 R eserve \nBank of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021\u2019 dated September 24, 2021  \n(as updated from time to time), including the eligibility of transferor  / tran sferee as specified \nin paragraph 3 of the said Master Direction.  \n \nd) Settlement of FUs not discounted / financed : O n an average, 17% of FUs uploaded on \nTReDS platforms are not discounted / financed; f or such FUs, TReDS guidelines require \nbuyers to pay MSME sellers outsi de the system .  To overcome the inconvenience caused \nto MSME sellers and buyers as well as  for better reconcil iation , TReDS platform  operator s \nshall now be permitted to undertake settlement of all FUs \u2013 financed / discounted or \notherwise \u2013 using the NACH mechanism used for TReDS . Timeline for funds settlement \nshall be subject to the provisions of TReDS guidelines (under reference) as well as other \nrelevant statutes like the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006. \n \ne) Display of bids  : TReDS platforms facilitate transparent and competitive bidding by  the \nfinanciers.  To make the process more transparent, the platforms may  display details of bids \nplaced for an FU to other bidders ; name of the bidder shall, however, not be revealed.   \n  \n3. This directive is iss ued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of the Payment and \nSettlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).  \n \nYours faithfully , \n \n \n \n(P.
