As banks are aware, in terms of paragraph 12 of our above directive dat ed 25 June 1987, in case \nof premature closure of a term deposit, a deposit in the form of daily deposit or recurring deposit \nfor reinvestment in term deposit interest will be payable without reducing ra te by one per cent by \nway of penalty provided the deposit after reinvest ment shall remain with the bank for a period \nlonger than the remaining period of the original c ontract. However, in terms of paragraph 11 ibid if \npayment under a term deposit is made before t he completion of the period of deposit agreed \nupon at the time of making the deposit, the rate of  interest payable in respect of such term \ndeposit shall be the one applicable to the period for which the deposit remained with the bank \nless one per cent penalty for premature withdrawal. In  this connection, it is clarified that if the \ndeposit after reinvestment is withdrawn before the expiry of the period of original contract, the \npenalty of one per cent is to be levied from t he date of original cont ract upto the date of \npremature withdrawal after reinvestment. If the premature withdrawal is made after the due date \nof the original contract, then the penalty is to be levied from the date of reinvestment to the date \nof premature withdrawal after reinvestment. T he position is explained by giving an illustration in \nthe Annexure. \nYours faithfully \n(N.T.Hariramani) \nChief Officer \n Annexure \nIllustration giving how penalty of 1% is to he levied by primary (urban) \nco-operative banks in case of premature withdrawal of term deposit etc.  \n  \nTo illustrate, a depositor had invested a sum of Rs . 10,000/- in term deposit on 1 June 1991 for a period \nof 36 months i.e. upto and inclusive of 31 May 1994. In the wake of revision in interest rates on deposits \neffective from 24 July 1991, he applied on 1 December 1991 (i. e. on completion of a period of 6 months) \nfor premature closure of the original term deposit for the purpose of reinvestment for a period of 36 \nmonths. \nCase I: When depositor requests for premat ure withdrawal of deposit on 1 October 1992 \nThe deposit after premature renewal on 1 December 1991 had remained with the bank only for 10 \nmonths (1 December 1991 to 30 September 1992). As this period was less than the remaining period of \noriginal contract upto 31 May 1994, it amounts to a premature withdrawal of original term deposit and \ninterest in such case should be paid as under: \nFrom 1.6.1991 to 30.11.1991 1% below the rate applicable for term \ndeposit for 6 months as on 1.6.1991. \nFrom 1.12.1991 to 30.09.1992 1% below the rate applicable for term \ndeposit of 10 months as on 1.12.1991. \nCase II : When depositor requests for premature withdrawal of deposit on 1 July 1994 \nIn this case, the deposit after premature renewal on 1 December 1991 has remained with the bank upto I \nJuly 1994 i.e. after expiry of t he original contract upto 31 May 1994.  The penalty of 1% reduction in \ninterest will therefore be levied from 1 December 1991, i. e. the date of reinvestment.

A report on the progress made by your ba nk in implementing the recommendations may \nplease be sent to our concerned Re gional Office on a quarterly basis. \n4. Please acknowledge receipt of the letter. \nYours faithfully, \nSd/- \n(S.D. Kadam)  \nDeputy Chief Officer \n------------------------------------------------ ------------ \n \n \n \n \n \n Annexure \nSr. \nNo. Recommen- \ndation No. Recommendations  \n1. 3.1 Service at the counters - Business and working hours  \nThe employees are expected to be at  their seats at the commencement of \nthe business hours and atte nd to all the customers who are in the branch \nprior to the close of business hours.  In practice, however, in many \nbranches, banks' employees take their own time to open the counters and \nalso do not attend to customers who are in the queue at the close of \nbusiness hours. Some banks, with a vi ew of ensuring that the service to \ncustomers is made available exactly at the commencement of the business \nhours, fix the working hours of staff to commence 15 minutes before the start of business hours. This arrangement can be made by all the banks at their branches in urban centres. \n2. 3.2 There are complaints that counters ar e closed at the end of business hours, \nwithout disposing of customers. Banks may issue instructi ons that all the \ncustomers who enter banking hall befo re the close of business hours should \nbe attended to. \n3. 3.4 Uninterrupted Service  \nBanks may devise appropriate proce dures to ensure that no counter \nremains unattended during the business hours and uninterrupted service is \nrendered to the customers by making adequate relief arrangements as may be necessary.  \n4. 3.5 Guidance to Customers \nAll branches except very small ones should have \"Enquiry\" or \"May I help \nyou\" counters. Such counters may exclusively attend to enquiries or may \nbe combined with other functions de pending upon the requirement. As far \nas possible, such counters should be near the entry point to the banking \nhall.  \n5. 3.13 Deposit and Other Accounts - Nomination facilities  \nBanks may get the account opening form s amended to incorporate a space \nto mention the name and address of the Nominee; statutorily prescribed \nnomination forms may be obtained and preserved with the account opening forms. Availability of nomination facili ty needs to be widely publicised by \nprinting compatible messages on cheque books/pass books and any other literature reaching the customers. \n6. 3.14 Nomination should be a rule (rather than an ex ception) and banks should \nendeavor to cover all accounts, exis ting as well as new, under nomination, \nexception being the ones where the cust omer himself would prefer not to \nnominate; this fact may be recorded rather than left to the conjecture of non-compliance. \n7. 3.15 Nomination facilities are available not only for deposit accounts but also \nfor safe custody articles and safe deposit lockers. As nomination facility \nfor deposit accounts is more known to customers, compared to the one available for safe custody articles and safe deposit lock ers, publicising \navailability of the facility for these two services also may be effectively \ndone. \n8. 3.17 Savings bank passbooks/Statements of Accounts  \nBanks may devise controls to ensure  that the passbooks are updated on an \nongoing basis, and complete and correct particulars are written in a legible \nhand. \n9. 3.18 Customers also need to be educated to submit the passbooks regularly for \nupdating. Banks may take the following steps to provide customer \nsatisfaction in these areas : \na) Customer education drives ma y be launched to bring home the \nadvantages of getting the passbooks  updated regularly/periodically. \nb) Employees may be exhorted to at tach importance to this area to \nprovide customer satisfaction, \nc) As a rule, passbooks may be upda ted immediately on submission. If \nupdating is not possible immediately due  to a large number of entries, \nthen paper tokens be issued for collection of passbooks on the next day. \n10. 3.20 Term Deposits \nBanks have made considerable innova tions in the -area of term deposits. \nVarious innovative schemes have b een introduced to suit customer \nrequirements. However, customer awar eness of the different schemes and \nfacilities thereunder is ac tually lacking, Banks should, therefore, ensure \nthat various term deposit scheme s are made known to the customers \nthrough proper publicity and advice. The customers need also be informed \nspecifically of the provisions of monthly interest on term deposits at a \ndiscounted rate and the facility of safe custody of term deposit receipts. \n11. 3.21 Term deposit application forms may be so devised as to contain a direction \nfor disposal of deposits an maturit y. In those cases where the customer \ndoes not indicate the course of action by the bank on maturity of deposits, \nbanks may as a rule send intimation of impending due date of the deposit well in advance. \n12. 3.24 Steps may be taken to ensure earl y communication of changes in interest \nrates to their various offices/branc hes by fastest mode of communication \nsuch as telex/ telephone/fax etc. up to the grass root level. During the \nintervening period, till such time the written communication of change in \nrate of interest is received, bank branches may accept term deposits \nshowing provisional rate of interest. Such provisional rate of interest may \nbe confirmed upon receipt of official communication. \n13. 3.25 Advisory Services on deposit schemes \nThere is room for providing Customer  satisfaction by assisting customers \nin taking proper decisions for inve stment in various deposit schemes \nhaving regard to their particular n eeds and expectations. The banks should provide assistance/guidance to custom ers in the area of investment of \nfunds in the various deposit scheme s vis-a-vis the requirements of the \ncustomers. \n14. 3.26 Brochures/pamphlets for guidance of customers \nBanks may make available to the customers brochures/pamphlets in \nregional language/Hindi/English gi ving details of various schemes \navailable and terms and conditions th ereof. Such brochures may also \ncontain, among others, do's and don'ts for smooth handling of day-today \nbanking transactions, e.g. updating of passbooks. Preferably in the leaner \nweeks of the month, say month, say third/fourth week, advantages of maintaining joint accounts and nom ination, keeping the banks with \ninstructions for disposal on maturity, etc. \n15. 3.28 Safe deposit lockers  \nBanks should provide more and more locker facilities, especially in residential areas having regard  to commercial viability.  \n16. 3.34 Bills  \nWhile the time taken for collection of bill proceeds largely depend upon the time taken by the drawee to retire  the bill, the delay can also be \nattributed to despatch of bills in pr esenting the bill to the drawee or in \ncrediting the proceeds after the paymen t is made by the drawee. In such \ncircumstances the lodger's bank should pa y interest to the lodger for the \ndelayed period at the rate of 2% p.a. above the savings bank rate. The \ndelayed period should be reckoned after making allowance for normal \ntransit period and a time frame of 2 days each for :  \n1) Despatch of bills \n2) Presentation of bills to drawees 3) Remittance of proceeds to the lodger's bank \n4) Crediting the proceeds to drawer's a/c. \nTo the extent the delay is attributab le to the drawee's bank, the lodger's \nbank may recover interest for such delay from that bank. Banks may \nsuitably revise the format of their payment advances to incorporate the \nabove information \n17. 3.36 Dishonored instruments, Banks may en sure that dishonored instrument is \nreturned/despatched to the customer promptly without delay, in any case \nwithin 24 hours. \n18. 3.38 Reimbursement of interest by payi ng bank While in terms of extant \ninstructions, interest for delayed cr edit is to be paid and borne by the \ncollecting bank alone. It is a fact  that on many occasions delay in \ncollection of cheques takes place due to the neglect on the part of the paying bank. It is only fair that when such delays can be attributed to the \npaying bank, it compensates the collecting bank by reimbursing the \namount. For this purpose, delay beyond two days on the part of paying bank in despatching the proceeds to th e collecting bank may be treated as \ndelay attributable to that bank. Responsib ility for payment of interest to the lodger of the cheque, however, should continue to remain that of the \ncollecting bank. \n19. 3.39 Valuedating of Telegraphic Transf ers (TTs) and Mail Transfers (MTs) \nTelegraphic Transfers (TTs)  \nTelex/Telegraphic transfer  should be paid latest on the third working day \nfrom the receipt of customers' instructions at the remitting office assuming all along, normal postal service. In th e event of delayed payment not owing \nto the postal delay, the beneficiary should be reimbursed with loss of \ninterest from the third day onw ards. The Goiporia Committee has \nrecommended valuedating of of amounts from the third day in respect of Telegraphic Transfers issued from a nd payable at State Capital and area I \ncentres (centres with population of  12,00,000 and above). For other centres \nincluding the state capitals and area 1 centres in North Eastern state and \nSikkim credit should be afforded imme diately on receipt of telegram or \nconfirmation copy of the telegram whic hever is earlier. In case of any \ndelay bank should pay interest at 2%  p.a. above the savings bank rate. \n20. 3.40 Mail Transfers  \nBanks have to afford credit of mail transfers to clients accounts within a \nperiod of 7 days (10 days in the case of North Eastern States and Sikkim) \nfrom the date of deposit of funds for M.T.s. Incase of delay the banks are \nrequired to pay interest for the delayed period @ 2% p.a. above the rate \napplicable to savings bank accounts. The interest for delay should be \nautomatically paid if it amounts to Rs. 5/- or more. \n21. 3.52 Work culture, Discipline and Attitude - Identity Badges  \nEach employee may wear on his pers on, identity badge with photograph \nand name prominently displayed on it. Subordinate staff should wear \nbadges over the uniforms provided by th e banks. Besides giving an official \ntouch, it will create a better rapport with the customers. \n22. 3.53 Job enrichment  \nMuch of the indifference and casual approach towards customer service \ncan be attributed to j ob monotony and the work environment. In order to \npromote greater involvement of employ ees in their work and to prevent \nalienation, job enrichment in the form  of periodic change of department \nand allocation of jobs carrying high er responsibilities is necessary. \nElementary checking functions such as authentication of passbooks/issuance of receipts for ch eques deposited for credit to the \ncustomers account etc; would not only make useful contribution towards \ncustomer service but also would give a boost to the morale and self-image \nemployees. \n23. 3.54 Training  \nIt is essential to align the training programmes to the needs in various areas with an eye on customer service. The employees should be trained to \ndevelop the right kind of aptitude to wards customer service, and sympathy \ntowards customer needs and expectati ons, Training programmes may be so \ndevised as to bring about positive attitudinal changes compatible to customer orientation. \n24. 3.55 Induction training to new recruits sh ould be a precursor to other follow up \ntraining programmes. All new recruits i.e.; clerks/officers should be \nnecessarily exposed to inducti on programme immediately after \nrecruitment. A co-ordinated approach  amongst banks is required in this \nregard. \n25. 3.60 Reward and recognition  \nGood work must be rewarded. The system of reward/recognition should be such that it puts an indifferent employee to a considerable disadvantage-psychologically, and even financially. Only if the reward scheme is objectively enunciated will employees be motivated to perform better. \nIndifferent and casual approach to wo rk (customer service) should not go \nunnoticed, giving such employees wrong signals. It is but proper that \ndisservice to customers is treated as delinquency. Banks  should evolve a \nfair system whereby employees are gauge d or rated in the area of customer \nservice and good work is rewarded. Any system that is evolved should necessarily be objective a nd no room should be left to subjectivity of any \nkind. Any reward/recognition scheme of incentive will need to be tailored, with an eye on the ultimate goal of customer service. \n26. 3.65 Systems and procedures \nSystems and procedures are necessary to  assist banks in functioning in an \neffective and efficient manner and to ensure safety of customers money. \nBanks may keep their system and procedures in trim, by a continuous \nprocess of introduction of new proce dures that may be required and by \ndoing away with unwanted ones \n27. 3.66 Customer service audit \nVarious facets of servic e to the customers need review and introduction of \nmore avenues has to be identified. Banks may subject themselves to an \naudit approach towards their customer service points at grassroots levels \nand also at policy prescription and macr o levels in the matter of extension \nof customer service. \n28. 3.67 In addition to Complaint-cum-Suggestion Box, every bank branch may \nmaintain a Complaint Book with adequa te number of perforated copies in \neach set so designed as to instantly  provide the complainant with an \nacknowledged copy of the complaint. \n29. 3.71 Inspection/audit reports The internal inspectors/auditors in cluding audit firms engaged for the \npurpose during the course of their in spection/audit of branches should \nexamine the various customers service aspects including the efficacy of the \ncomplaints handling and grievance re dressal machinery; and, based on \ntheir observations, record the improve ments and deficiencies in various \nareas. \n30. 3.76 Complaint prone employees \nComplaint prone employees need proper counselling. Placement of \nemployees in customer contact slots should be on a selective basis. By imaginative and innovative approaches , enough number of employees can \nbe brought up by training. Recognition a nd reward can act as examples in \nspreading customer service culture. Cases of deliberate recalcitrance and \ndisregard of customer service spirit should be taken note of and kept in \nconcerned employees service records ap art from taking other action against \nsuch employees. \n31. 3.77 Periodical visits by senior officials \nSenior officials while visiting the branch es should also give priority to the \ncustomers service aspects. It will be of  great advantage if senior official \ncounter-checks the actual \"branch atmo sphere\" by having in hand a report \non customer service submitted by the branch. \n32. 3.80 Infrastructure provision  \nBanks may bestow attention to providi ng adequate space, proper furniture, \ndrinking water facilities, clean enviro nment, (which includes keeping the \nwalls free of posters) etc; in their premises to enable conduct of banking \ntransactions smoothly and more comfortably. \n33. 3.86 Customer education Customer education both in regard to  rights and responsib ilities in dealing \nwith banks should be viewed as a fundamental issue in any attempt to \nimprove customer service. \nCustomer should be made aware not onl y of various schemes and services \noffered by banks, but also about, schemes and formalities, procedures, \nlegal requirements and limitations in the matter of providing services by \nthe banks, through a proper mix of ad vertisement, literature, interfaces, \nseminars, etc. Banks should involve their employees in all customer education programmes. \n34. 3.88 Security arrangements \nIn view of the recent incidents invol ving terrorists/dacoits, banks should \nreview and improve upon the existing securi ty system in branches so as to \ninstill confidence amongst the em ployees and the public. Regular \ndrill/training to the secur ity staff should be ensured. \n35. 3.96 Display of time norms Time norms for specified business transactions should be displayed \nprominently in the banking hall so that  it attracts the customers 'attention \nas well as that of the employees for adherence. \n\u00a0", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/CIRCUS12051993.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 11, 1993", "info": "RPCD.No.BC.110/07.38.01-92/93                                                                            May 11, 1993\nAll State and Central Co-operative Banks\nDear Sir,\nCustomer Service - Implementation of Recommendations of the Goiporia Committee\nAs you are aware a committee under the Chairmanship of Shri M. N. Goiporia was set up in September\n1990 to make suitable recommendations for improvement in the customer service in banks. Based on the\nrecommendations of the committee it has been decided that State Co-operative Banks/District Central\nCo-operative Banks (SCBs/CCBs) should implement the following recommendations:\n(1)Immediate credit of outstation cheques upto Rs. 5,000/-\nThe facility of immediate credit against outstation cheques upto As. 2500/- tendered by\nindividual account holders for collection has been in vogue since 1989 vide our Circular\nRPCD.No.RF.DIR.BC.65/D.1-88/89 dated 16 January 1989. In partial modification of these\ninstructions, it has been decided that the ceiling for immediate credit may be enchanced to\nRs. 5,000/- for out station cheques tendered by individual account holders subject to the\nrecovery of usual collection charges and the bank is satisfied about the proper conduct of\nthe account and the customer desires the facility. In the event of the cheque returned\nunpaid, the bank may recover normal rate of interest for the period it is out of funds. For this\npurpose, banks may consider introducing different pay-in slips superimposing a notice to the\neffect that in the event of dishonour of the cheque, customer will be subject to payment of\nnormal rate of interest for the period till the bank was out of funds.\n(2)Delay in collection of outstation cheques/instruments\nAs per the extant instructions, banks are required to pay interest at savings bank rate for\ndelayed collection of outstation cheques/instruments drawn either on their own outstation\nbranches or on outstation branches of other (drawee) banks and sent for collection, if the\nproceeds are not realised/credited to the customer's accounts or the unpaid instruments are\nnot returned to the customers within a period of 14 days from the date of their lodgment (c.f.\nRPCD.No.RF.BC.91/D.1/89/90 dated 24 March 1990). We have been receiving complaints\nregarding undue delay in collection of outstation cheques/instruments despite various\nmeasures adopted for improvement in the service. With a view to creating greater\nawareness among banks to further improve the customer service, it has been decided that if\nthe delay in collection of outstation cheques/instruments is beyond 10 days in the case of\ncheques lodged at and drawn on State Headquarters except the State Capitals of North\nEastern Region and Sikkim and beyond 14 days in all other cases, banks should pay\ninterest @ 2% p.a. over savings bank rate Interest payable should be paid/credited to all\ntypes of accounts of the customer without the customer having to claim it. Such interest\nmay, however, be paid only when the amount is Rs. 5/- or more.\n(Also Refer RPCD.No.BC.35/07.38.01/93-94 dt 10-09-93)2.
