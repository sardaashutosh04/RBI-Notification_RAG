As regards the settlement mechanism fo r the IRF contracts, it has been decided \nthat all entities having shor t (sold) position in the IR F contracts and required to \ndeliver securities on the appointed date will move these securities from their \nrespective Subsidiary General Ledger/C onstituents' Subsidiary General Ledger \n(SGL/CSGL) accounts with the RBI to a special \"Settlement\" SGL account of the \nrespective Clearing Corpor ations of the Exchange s [Exchange Clearing House \n(ECH) / Exchange Clearing Corporation (ECC)] authoris ed to deal in IRF. The \nECH/ECC will in turn deliver the securities to the SGL/CSGL accounts of the entities \nhaving long (bought) position a fter ensuring that the settl ement of funds has been \ncompleted through the designa ted clearing banks. Thus, t he clearing and settlement \nwill essentially be the responsib ility of the ECH/EC C. RBI will provide the facility for \ntransfer of Government securities to facilit ate completion of the securities leg of the \nsettlement. \n \n3. Operational guidelines:  \n \na) Each ECH/ECC will have to open a Se ttlement SGL account and a Proprietary \nSGL account for which they have to apply to the Public Debt Office (PDO), Mumbai with relevant documents. \nUrban Banks Department, Central Office, 1 Floor, Garment House, Worli, Mumbai - 400 018 \nPhone: 022 - 2493 9930 - 49, Fax: 022 - 2497 4030 / 2492 0231, Email: cgmincubd@rbi.org.in  \n \n 2 \n \nb) Upon the opening of such  accounts, each ECH/ECC will be provided with the \nNegotiated Dealing System (NDS) and t he Indian Financial Network (INFINET) \nconnectivity. \n \nc) Since the IRF contracts will be traded on the authorised exchanges the \nsettlement details will be arrived at by the respective Exchanges and the details \nof the settlement will be communicate d by the ECH/ECC to the parties \nconcerned who are required to either deliv er or to receive the securities. The \nholder of the security (transfe ror) who has to deliver the securities will initiate the \ntransfer to the Settlement SGL Account  of the ECH/ECC in the NDS. The \nECH/ECC will authorise each such transfer after which the security will move \ninto their Settlement SGL account. The ECH/ECC in turn will transfer the \nsecurities to different trans ferees who are eligible to receive the securities. All \nthe above transfers in respect of  IRF settlements would be effected \nelectronically with digital signatures in  terms of Regulation 4 (2) of the \nGovernment Securities Regulations, 2007. The above procedure will be applicable only where it involves transfer of securities between two SGL/CSGL \naccounts or between the tw o depositories, i. e. NSDL and CDSL, while the \ntransfer of securities between demat  accounts maintained with the same \ndepository will be settled thr ough the depository itself. \n \nd) As only the settlement of securities arising out of oblig ations under IRF will take \nplace under the above mode, it would be the responsibi lity of the ECH/ECC to \nensure the settlement of t he funds leg of the transac tion through the designated \nclearing banks. \n \ne) The ECH/ECC will ensure that only securi ties eligible under IRF are transferred \nto their Settlement SGL account. \n \nf) The Settlement SGL account will be onl y for the limited purpose of enabling pay-\nins and pay-outs of the Government se curities to be delivered for the IRF \nsettlement on the settlement date. As this account is for the limited purpose of \nholding securities between pay-in and pay-o ut while the ECH/ ECC ensures that \nthe funds leg has been settled, this Se ttlement SGL Account must have a zero \nbalance at the end of the day. \nUrban Banks Department, Central Office, 1 Floor, Garment House, Worli, Mumbai - 400 018 \nPhone: 022 - 2493 9930 - 49, Fax: 022 - 2497 4030 / 2492 0231, Email: cgmincubd@rbi.org.in  \n \n 3 \n \ng) The ECH/ECC will give a onetime mandate to the PDO, Mumbai that any \nleftover security in the settlement SGL acc ount (arising out of securities blocked \ndue to defaults in funds settlement or fo r any other reason) gets automatically \ntransferred to the Proprietary SGL accoun t of the ECH/ECC at the end of the \nday. Any such incident of transfer to t he Proprietary SGL account will result in \nissue of notification message to the Fi nancial Markets Department, RBI, CO, \nMumbai & the PDO, Mumbai and the concerned ECH/ECC. \n \nh) In case of default in delivery of securi ties by the SGL account  holders, it will be \ntreated as \"bouncing\" and cu rrent penalties in respect of SGL bouncing would \napply. In case of default in delivery of security by the CSGL account holders, \narising out of the actions of the individual Gilt Account Holders (GAH), it will be \nthe responsibility of the CSGL acc ount holders to suitably deal with the \nconcerned GAH to prevent recurrence of such defaults. The ECH/ECC will \ninform the PDO, Mumbai about any such  default by the SGL/CSGL account \nholders on the same day.   \n \ni) Individual ECH/ECC may decide upon the time frame for the settlement. \nHowever, the pay-out of t he securities for settlement of IRF contracts should be \ncompleted latest by 2.30 PM. \n \nj) Any misuse of the SGL/CSGL facili ty or the IRF settlement mechanism may \nresult in action in terms of section 27,  29 and 30 of the Government Securities \nAct, 2006 (38 of 2006). \n \n4.

It has been brought to the notice of the Reserve Bank that certain \nscheduled commercial banks are exte nding short-term loans of tenure \nranging from six months to one year to Housing Finance Companies (HFCs), \nand classifying the same as priority sector advances. Since the housing loans are generally medium to long-term loans taken by the individuals, the short- term loans with tenor of six months to one year granted by banks to HFCs \nfor on-lending purposes would not be co-terminus with the loans taken by \nindividuals.  \n \n3. On examination, it has been decide d that the banks should link the tenor \nof loans granted by them to HFCs in line with the average portfolio maturity \nof housing loans, up to Rs. 20 lakh, gr anted by the HFCs to the individual \nborrowers. The banks should accordingly no te that if the tenor of such loans \ngranted by them to HFCs is not co-ter minus with the on-len ding of HFCs, as \nindicated above, they will not be eligible for classification under priority sector. \n \n4. The banks should also ensure the end use of the funds strictly as per the guidelines on lending to priority sector. \n \n5. The above instructions may please be  advised to your controlling offices \nand branches for immediate implementation. \n \n6. Please acknowledge receipt. \n \nYours faithfully, \n \n  \n(B. P.

If the asset is sold for Rs 70,000, there will be a \nloss of Rs 30,000, which will be adjusted against the provision of Rs 50,000 leaving  \n \n \n- 2 - an excess provision of Rs 20,000 on accoun t of the sale of t he NPA. Such excess \nprovisions should continue to be shown un der \u2018provisions\u2019 and would be considered \nas Tier II capital subject to the overall ceiling of 1.25% of risk weighed assets. \n(iii)    Provisions for dimi nution of fair value  \nIn terms of paragraph 5.1 of circular UBD.PCB.BPD.No. 53  dated March 6, 2009, \nbanks were advised that they should hold provisions for restructured advances as \nper the extant provisioning norms.  In addition to such provisions, banks were \nadvised to make provisions to cover the economic loss to the bank due to reduction \nin the rate of interest or reschedulement of repayment of principal amount of loan \nrestructured.  Such additional provisions made for diminution in the fair value of \nrestructured advances, both in respect of standard assets and NPAs, are permitted \nto be netted from the relative loan asset.   \n \nYours faithfully \n \n(A.K.

In terms of \nSection 15(1)  of the Act, every credit institution has to become member of at least \none credit information company within a period of three months from \ncommencement of the Act or any extended time allowed by the Reserve Bank on \napplication. \n \n2.        The Government had in  exercise of powers conferred by Section 35  of the \nAct issued (Removal of Difficulties)  Order, 2008 dated January 24, 2008 extending \nthe last date for taking membership of at  least one credit information company by \ncredit institutions to December 31, 2008.  A copy of captioned Notification dated \nJanuary 24, 2008 is enclosed  for information and necessary action. Further \nextension of time is under consideration. \n \n3.        In this connection it is advised that as per the provisions of sub section (1)  of \nSection 21 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005, \"any person, who applies for grant or sanction of cr edit facility, from any credit institution, \nmay request such institution to furnish him a copy of the credit information obtained by such institution from the cr edit information company\". Further, \nsub-section (2)  of \nthe said Section also specif ies that every credit inst itution shall on receipt of  \n  \n - 2 -request, as indicated in sub-section (1), fu rnish to such person a copy of the credit \ninformation subject to payment of char ges specified by the bank under the \nRegulations.     You might be aware that Reserve Bank, in Credit Information \nCompanies Regulations, 2006 , framed under the Act, has already prescribed in \nRegulation 12(3) a maximum fees of Rs. 50/- (Rupees fifty only) for the purpose. \n \n4.   As the Urban Co operative Banks fall under the categor y of credit institutions as \ndefined in sub-section (f) of Section 2 of the Act, they would be required to take \nmembership of at least one credit info rmation company and provide credit data \n(positive as well as negative) to the credit information co mpany in the format \nprescribed by the credit information company. The success of credit information \ncollection and dissemination system depends on the data supplied by banks to the credit information companies. Therefore it is desirable that t he Urban Cooperative \nBanks should be in readiness to supply da ta to credit information companies as \nand when they become operational. In view  of this, Urban Coo perative Banks are \nadvised to initiate steps to build up dat abase and be in readiness for effective \nexchange of credit information. \n \nYours faithfully \n \n(A.K.

Opening of branches by domestic scheduled commercial banks (other than \nRRBs)  in Tier 1 and Tier 2 centres (centre s with population of 50,000 and above as \nper 2001 Census) will continue to require prior permission of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia, except in the case of North Ea stern States and Sikk im where the general \npermission would cover semi-urban and urban centres also.  The number of \nbranches which would be autho rized by the Reserve Bank  of India based on such \napplications would depend, inte r alia, upon various aspects , including a requirement \nthat banks may plan their annual branch expans ion in such a manner , that at least \none-third of total number of br anches opened in a financial y ear in Tier 3 to Tier 6 \ncentres  are in underbanked districts of underbanked States ( as per Annex III ), as \nalso upon a critical assessment  of the bank\u2019s performance in financial inclusion, \npriority sector lending, customer service etc. \n5.   Banks are also free to convert t heir general banking branches into Specialised \nbranches subject to the condition that the bank should continue to serve the existing \ncustomers of the general banking branches, which ar e being converted into \nspecialized branches. \n \n6.  The general permissions referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 above would be \nsubject to regulatory/supervisory comfort in respect of the bank concerned and RBI \nwould have the option to withhold the gene ral permissions now being granted, on a \ncase-to-case basis, taking into account a ll relevant factors.           \n \n7.

As announced in  the Annual Policy Statement of April 2009, a Working \nGroup (Chairman: Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar) was constituted to review the extant branch authorisation policy with a view to providing greater flexibility  to banks for \nopening branches to enhance banking penetrat ion and promote financ ial inclusion. \nThe Group has since submitted its Report.  Taking into consideration the Group\u2019s \nrecommendations, it is proposed  to liberalise the extant Branch Authoris ation Policy \nfor domestic scheduled commercial banks (other than RRBs)  as under: \n \u2022   Domestic scheduled commercial banks (other than RRBs) will now be free to \nopen branches in Tier 3 to Tier 6 centre s as identified in t he Census 2001 (with \npopulation up to 50,000) under  general permission.  \n \n\u2022   Opening of branches by domestic scheduled commercial banks (other than \nRRBs)  in Tier 1 and Tier 2 centres (wit h population over 50,000) will continue to \nrequire prior authorisation. \n \u2022   Banks may plan their branch expansion in  Tier 3 to Tier 6 centres in such a \nmanner that at least one-third of such branches are in the underbanked districts of \nunderbanked States as will be not ified separately by the Reserve Bank. This would \nbe one of the criteria in the Reserve Bank\u2019s considerati on of proposals by domestic \nscheduled commercial banks (other than RRBs)  to open branches in Tier 1 and \nTier 2 centres.  In considering such propos als, the Reserve Bank would, in addition, \ntake into account banks\u2019 performance in financ ial inclusion, priority sector lending \nand level of customer service, among others. \n  \nAnnex II \nDetails of tier-wise classificatio n of centres based on population   \n \n \n(i) Classification of centres(ti er-wise)           Population(as per 2001 Census) \n \nTier 1 -                                 1,00,000 and above \nTier 2-                                     50,000 to 99,999 \nTier 3-                                     20,000 to 49,999 \nTier 4-                                                10,000 to 19,999 \nTier 5-                                        5,000 to   9,999 \nTier 6-                                                   Less than 5000  \n \n(ii) Population-group wise classification of centres  \n \nRural Centre                                                             Population upto 9,999 \nSemi-urban centre                                                    from 10,000 to 99,999 \nUrban centre                                                             from 1,00 ,000 to 9,99,999 \nMetropolitan centre                                                   10,00,000 and above    \n                                 \n                                     \n                                    \n                                                \n                                        \n                                                     \n \n \n \n                                                              \n                                                   \n                                                       \n                                                     \n \n  \nAnnex III \nList of Underbanked Districts in Underbanked States (based on 2001 \nPopulation census) \n \n ARUNACHAL \nRADESH P  BIHAR \n1.

In terms of Section \n15(1) of the Act, every credit institution has to become member of at least one \ncredit information company within a period of three months from commencement \nof the Act or any extended time allowed by the Reserve Bank on application. \n \n2.  As Co-operative Banks fall under credit institutions as defined in sub-section \n(f) of Section 2 of the Act, they would be required to take  membership of at least \none credit information company and provi de credit data (positive as well as \nnegative) to the credit information company in  the format prescribed by the credit \ninformation company. The success of credit information collection and dissemination system depends on the data supplied by banks to the credit information companies. Therefore, it is desirable that all State and Central Co-\noperative Banks should be in readiness to supply data to credit information \ncompanies as and when they become operational. In view of this, they are 2 \n \nadvised to urgently initiate steps to build up database and be in readiness for \neffective exchange of credit information without any loss of time. \n \n3.  In this connection we also invite your  attention to the provisions of sub section \n(1) of Section 21 of the Credit Informa tion Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005, \nwhich provides \"any person, who applies fo r grant or sanction of credit facility, \nfrom any credit institution, may request to su ch institution to fu rnish him a copy of \nthe credit information obtained by such in stitution from the credit information \ncompany\".  \nFurther, sub-section (2) of the said Sect ion also specifies that every credit \ninstitution shall on receipt of  request, as indicated in sub-section (1), furnish to \nsuch person a copy of the credit info rmation subject to payment of charges \nspecified by the Reserve B ank under the Regulations.  \n \n4.  You might be aware that Reserve Bank, in Credit Information Companies Regulations, 2006, framed und er the Act, has already prescribed in Regulation \n12(3) a maximum fee of Rs. 50/- (R upees fifty only) for the purpose. \n \n5. State and Central Co-operative Banks are, therefor e, advised to ensure strict \ncompliance with the provisions of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) \nAct, 2005 as well as the rules and  regulations framed thereunder. \n \n Yours faithfully, \n  (R.C.Sarangi) Chief General Manager \n \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/CICA0112009.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Dec 01, 2009", "info": "RBI/2009-10/239 \nDNBS.PD/ CC.No.165/03.05. 002/2009-10                  December 1, 2009 \nAll  NBFC\ns  \nDear Sir, \nCapital Adequacy - Risk w\neightage on Lending through Collateralized \nBorrowing  and Lending Obligation (CBLO)   \nInvesting by NBFC\ns in instruments lik e Collateralized Borrowing and Lending \nObligations (CBLOs) results in their expos ure to Central Counter Parties (CCPs) \nlike Clearing Corporation of India Ltd.

The Working Group has submitted its \nreport which has been placed  on the Bank\u2019s website on August 19, 2009. The \nrecommendations of the working group have since been accepted by Reserve Bank \nof India with slight modifications. Accordingly, banks are advised to take necessary \naction for implementing the various recommendations of the Working Group as indicated in the Annex.   \n \n2.  Banks are permitted to appoint the following entities as BCs, in addition to the \nentities presently permitted: (i) Individual ki rana/medical /fair price shop owners (ii) \nIndividual Public Call Office (PCO) operators (iii) Agents of  Small Savings schemes of \nGovernment of India/Insurance Companies (i v) Individuals who own Petrol Pumps (v) \nRetired teachers and (vi) Au thorised functionaries of we ll run Self Help Groups \n(SHGs) linked to banks.   \n \n3. With a view to ensuring the viability of the BC model, banks (and not BCs) are permitted to collect reasonable service char ges from the customer, in a transparent   \n-2- \nmanner under a Board-appr oved policy. Consider ing the profile of the  clientele to \nwhom banking services are being delivered through t he BC model, banks should \nensure that the service charges/fees coll ected from the customer for delivery of \nbanking services through the BC model is not only fair and reasonable but also seen \nto be so. A copy of the Board-approved poli cy in this regard may be forwarded to us \n(The Chief General Manager-in-charge, Reserve Bank of  India, Department of \nBanking Operations and Deve lopment, Central Office, Worl d Trade Centre, Centre -1, \nCuffe Parade, Colaba, Mum bai \u2013 400 005 in the case  of Scheduled Commercial \nBanks and LABs and The Chief General Manager, Reserve Bank of India, Rural \nPlanning and Credit Department, Central Office, Central Office Building, 10th Floor, \nShahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Mum bai \u2013 400 001 in the case of  RRBs). Banks should in \nparticular ensure that there are no compla ints from the custom er about the charges \nbeing non-transparent/not reason able. Any unfair practices adopted by banks in this \nregard would be viewed seriously by Reserve Bank of India. \n \n4. With the inclusion of the above entities, it is estimated that there will be substantial \naddition to the available universe of BCs.  Keeping in view the operational and other \nrisks implied, banks are advised to ensure that  they carry out suit able due diligence in \nrespect of the entities proposed to be appointed as BCs and also institute additional \nsafeguards as may be considered appropria te to minimise the agency risks. ICT \nsolutions that ensure proper authentication and other security measures may be \nadopted to minimise the risk while upscaling the model as already advised.  Further, \nbanks may ensure that while ap pointing the above entities as BCs, the fundamental \nprinciple that the individuals are residents of the area in which they propose to \noperate as BCs, stands fulfilled.  \n \n5. As regards the North Eastern Region,  it has been decided to implement the \nrecommendation made by the Committee on Fi nancial Sector Plan (CFSP) for the \nNorth Eastern Region(Chair person: Smt. Usha Thorat) regarding the entities which \ncan be appointed as BCs in the North Easter n Region.  Accordingly, where a local \norganization/association not falling under any of the forms of  organizations listed in \nthe Reserve Bank guidelines is proposed to be appointed by a bank as Business  \n  \n-3- \nCorrespondent after due diligence and is recommended by the DCC for being \napproved as Business Correspondent, the sa me would be considered by the \nRegional Office of the Reserve Bank fo r granting suitable exemption from the \nReserve Bank guidelines for appointing such entit ies as BCs.  Banks may therefore \napproach the Regional Director of the Reserve Bank at Guwahati for the  purpose.   \n \n6.  Further, banks are also permitted to al low, with suitable and adequate safeguards, \nthe BCs in the North Eastern Region to a ccount for the transactions in the bank\u2019s \nbooks latest by the end of the second working day from the date of the transaction.   \n \n7. Regarding cases referred to DCCs for re laxation of criteria in respect of the \nmaximum distance between the place of busi ness of the BC and the base branch,  \nthe DCCs  may give their decis ion at the earliest, and in any case within a period of \nthree months, from the date of reference to them.  In case no decision is conveyed by \nDCCs within this period,  the banks are permitted to treat it as a \u2018no objection\u2019 for \nrelaxation of the distan ce criterion.    \n \nYours faithfully \n \n(P.Vijaya Bhaskar) \nChief General Manager-in-charge \nEncl: as stated above Annex \nAction required to be taken by banks based on the recommendations of the \nWorking Group  to Review the Business Correspondent Model \n \nSl. \nNo. Recommendation of the Working Group Action required to be taken by banks \n1 Realising the full potential of the \nBC model \nGiven the right impetus, the BC \nmodel has the potential to speed up \nthe process of financial inclusion in \nthe country and bring the vast \nmajority of population within the banking fold. The Group recognises \nthe fact that the process of financial \ninclusion involves the three critical aspects of (a) access to banking \nmarkets, (b) access to credit \nmarkets and (c) financial education. \nThe BC model should, therefore, \nencompass each of the above three \naspects in order to be able to address the issue of financial \ninclusion in a holistic manner. The \nfull scope of the model can be realised not just by opening no-frills \naccounts but by synthesising the \nabove three aspects as integral components of the model. Towards \nthis end, there should be proper \nunderstanding and appreciation of \nthe BC model by all stakeholders, in \nparticular, by banks.  Banks need to appreciate the benefits arising out \nof adopting the \u2018branchless\u2019 BC \nmodel and implement the same with missionary zeal so as to achieve \nthe ultimate goal of financial \ninclusion.   (Paragraph 3.20)  \n  \n \nBanks to implement the Business \nCorrespondent model to achieve greater \npenetration of banking services.  \n2 Cash handling   \nBanks could think in terms of streamlining cash management by adopting \u2018Cash Routes\u2019 (linking \nvarious BCs which are in close \nproximity to each other to a base branch) wherever warranted with \nsuitable cash transit insurance  to \nbe borne by the banks. (Paragraph 3.22)  \n  \nFor streamlining cash management, banks \nmay consider adopting \u2018Cash Routes\u2019 linking \nvarious BCs which are in close proximity to each other to a base branch) wherever \nwarranted with suitable cash transit \ninsurance.  \n \n3 Financial Education and Consumer Protection  \n \n(i) Banks need to scale up their efforts substantially towards educating the clientele in their \nrespective vernacular languages \nregarding the benefits of banking habit.  For this purpose, extending \nnecessary financial support from \nthe Financial Inclusion Fund  \n \n \n(i) Banks may scale up their efforts substantially towards educating their clientele in their respective vernacular languages \nregarding the benefits of banking habit.   \n \n \n \n administered by NABARD may be \nconsidered. (Paragraph 3.23)     \n(ii) Information regarding BCs engaged by banks may be placed on the banks\u2019 websites.  The \nAnnual Reports of banks should \nalso include the progress in respect of extending banking services \nthrough the BC model and the \ninitiatives taken by banks in this regard. Banks may also use print \nand electronic media (including in \nthe vernacular language) to give \nwide publicity about implementation \nof BC model by them. (Paragraph 3.24) \n(iii) The banks may educate their customers  through various means \u2013 print, electronic, etc. -   the role of \nthe BC and their obligation towards \nthe customers, in the vernacular language. (Paragraph 3.25) \n \n(iv) The banks need to ensure the preservation and protection of the \nsecurity and confidentiality of \ncustomer information in the custody or possession of the BCs. \n(Paragraph 3.26) \n \n(v) Banks may put in an appropriate grievance redressal mechanism, \nwhich should be widely publicised \nand also placed in public domain. \nThe details of the grievance redressal officer should be \ndisplayed at the premises of the BC \nas also at the base branch and made available by the bank/BC at \nthe request of the \ncustomer.(Paragraph 3.27) \n  \n \n(ii) Information regarding BCs engaged by \nbanks may be placed on the respective banks\u2019 websites.  The Annual Report of the \nbanks should also incl ude the progress in \nrespect of extending banking services \nthrough the BC model and the initiatives \ntaken by banks in this regard.  Banks may \nalso use print and electronic media(including in the vernacular language) to give wide \npublicity about implementation of the BC \nmodel by them.   \n \n \n \n(iii) Banks may educate their customers through various means \u2013 print, electronic etc., - the role of the BC and their obligation \ntowards the customers, in the vernacular \nlanguage. \n \n \n(iv) Banks should ensure the preservation and protection of the security and \nconfidentiality of the customer information in \nthe custody or possession of the BCs.   \n \n \n \n(v) Banks may put in place an appropriate \ngrievance redressal mechanism, which \nshould be widely publicised and also placed \nin public domain. The details of the grievance \nredressal officer should be displayed at the premises of the BC as also at the base \nbranch and made available by the bank/BC \nat the request of the customer. \n \n4 Ensuring viability of BC model \n(i) The BC model can succeed  only if the banks own up the BCs as their agents. Banks may need to have a \nrelook at the compensation \nstructure for BCs.  (Paragraph 3.28) \n \n(ii)The  range of services to be delivered through the BC should be ramped up to include suitable small \nsavings, micro-credit, micro-\ninsurance, small value remittances \netc. (Paragraph 3.29)   \n \n(iii) Banks may be permitted to collect reasonable service charges \nfrom the customer, in a transparent manner, for delivering services \nthrough the BC model. Suitable \nguidelines may be issued by RBI in this regard, especially keeping in  \n(i) Banks may have a relook at the compensation structure for BCs to effectively ramp up the use of the BC scheme for \nbanking penetration.  \n \n \n(ii) Banks may ramp up the range of services \nto be delivered through the BC model to include suitable small savings, micro-credit, \nmicro-insurance, small value remittances \netc.,   \n \n \nPlease see paragraph 3 of the Circular.  \n \n \n \n \n \n view the profile of customers using \nthese services. (Paragraph 3.30). \n \n \n \n \n \n(iv)  Banks may bear the initial set \nup cost of the BCs and extend a \nhandholding support to the BCs, at least during the initial stages. Banks \nmay also need to bear the costs \nrelating to transit insurance of the \ncash handled by BCs. (Paragraph \n3.31)  \n \n(v) In order to improve the viability of the BC model, banks may consider providing reasonable \ntemporary overdrafts to the BCs \nfree of interest charges. (Paragraph 3.32) \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(iv) Banks may consider bearing the initial set \nup cost and other costs of the BCs and \nextend a handholding support to the BCs, at least during the initial stages.  \n \n \n \n \n \n(v) Banks may consider providing reasonable temporary overdrafts to the BCs. \n5 Risk Mitigation Measures  \nTo address the various risks involved in rendering banking services through the BC model, \nbanks need to put in place suitable \nand adequate risk mitigation measures. Further , banks may be \nguided by the instructions contained in the guidelines on \u2018 Outsourcing of \nFinancial Services\u2019 issued by RBI \non November 3, 2006, as relevant,  \nwhile implementing the BC model.  \n(Paragraph 3.35) \n  \nBanks may put in place suitable and \nadequate risk mitigation measures to address the various risks involved in \nrendering banking services through the BC \nmodel.  Banks may also be guided by the instructions contained in the guidelines on \n\u2018Outsourcing of Financial Services\u2019 issued by \nRBI on November 3, 2006, as relevant while \nimplementing the BC model. \n6 Adoption of appropriate \ntechnology \nBanks may adhere to the RBI guidelines on adoption of appropriate technology while \nimplementing the BC model. \n(Paragraph 3.37) \n  \n \nBanks may adhere to the extant RBI guidelines on adoption of appropriate technology as contained in the circular  \nDBOD.No.Leg.BC./94/ 09.07.005/2006-07 \ndated May 7, 2007,  while implementing the BC model. \n7 Training  for the BCs \nBanks may also develop suitable training modules in the local language/s, in order to provide \nproper attitudinal orientation and \nskills to the BCs. Indian Institute of \nBanking & Finance(IIBF)has \nalready developed training modules for BCs.  These modules may be \ntranslated in vernacular languages \nand leveraged extensively so as to \nreach a wider group. (Paragraph \n3.38) \n  \nBanks may develop suitable training modules in the local language/s, in order to provide \nproper attitudinal orientation and skills to the BCs.  \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/IBC301109FV.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 30, 2009", "info": " \n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f  \u093f\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \nwww.rbi.org.in \n \n \n\u0938\u0942\u091a\u0928\u093e \u0942\u094c\u0926\u094d\u092f\u094b\u093f\u0917\u0915\u0940  \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , \u0915\u0947\u0902\u093f\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, 14\u0935\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932 , \u0915\u0947\u0902\u093f\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928 ,\u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926  \u092d\u0917\u0924  \u093f\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0908 - 400001 \n\u0153\u00b8\u20ac\u00b8\u00bd\u203a\u00b8 Tel: (91-22) 2264 4995;  \u0153\u00b8\u00be\u20ac\u00c6\u00ac\u00b8 Fax: (91-22) 22691557;   \u0192\u00c4-\u0178\u00b8\u00bd\u00a5\u00b8 e-mail :   cgmincditco@rbi.org.in  \nDepartment of Information Technology, Central Office, 14th Floor, Central Office Building, Shahi d Bhagat Singh Road, Fort, Mumbai - 400001 \n\u093f\u0939\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940  \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928  \u0939\u0948, \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e  \u0942\u092f\u094b\u0917  \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0907\u090f \n \n RBI/2009-10/237 \nDIT(CO) Circular NO. 6/09.61.002/2009-10    November 30, 2009  \n \n \nTo All NDS Members  \n \n \nDear Sir,  \n \nUp-gradation of the PDO-NDS application to Windows 2008  \n \nAs you are aware that t he PDO NDS application is presently running on Windows \n2000 advanced server with Oracle Version 9i and IBM Websphere MQ series 5.3. \n \n2.

Introduction \n \nThe offence of Money Laundering has  been defined in Section 3 of the \nPrevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) as \"whosoever directly or \nindirectly attempts to indu lge or knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or is \nactually involved in any process or activity connect ed with the proceeds of crime \nand projecting it as untai nted property shall be guilt y of offence of money \nlaundering\". Money Laundering can be called a process by which money or other \nassets obtained as proceeds  of crime are ex changed for \"clean money\" or other \nassets with no obvious link to their criminal origins. \n \nThere are three stages of money l aundering during which there may be \nnumerous transactions made by launderers that could alert an  institution to \ncriminal activity :- \n \nPlacement - the physical disposal of cash pr oceeds derived from illegal activity. \n \nLayering - separating illicit proceeds from their source by creating complex \nlayers of financial transactions designed to disguise the audit trail and provide \nanonymity. \n \nIntegration  - the provision of apparent legitimacy to criminally derived wealth. If \nthe layering process has succeeded, in tegration schemes place the laundered \nproceeds back into the economy in such a way that they re-enter the financial system appearing to be normal business funds. \n \n2.  The objective \n \nThe objective of prescribi ng KYC/AML/CFT guidelines is to prevent the system of \ncross border inward money transfer into India from all over the world under the 2 \n \nMTSS from being used, intent ionally or unintentionally, by criminal elements for \nmoney laundering or terrorist financing ac tivities. KYC procedures also enable \nAuthorised Persons, who ar e Indian Agents under MTSS [r eferred as APs (Indian \nAgents) hereinafter] to know/understand  their customers and their financial \ndealings better, which in turn help them manage their risks prudently. \n \n3.   Money Transfer Service Scheme \n \n3.1 (a)  Money Transfer Service Scheme (MT SS) is a quick and easy way of \ntransferring personal remittances from abr oad to beneficiaries in India. Only \npersonal remittances such as remittanc es towards family maintenance and \nremittances favouring foreign tourists vi siting India are permissible. The system \nenvisages a tie-up bet ween reputed money trans fer companies abroad \n(Overseas Principals) and APs (Indian Agents) who would disburse the funds to \nthe beneficiaries at ongoing exchange ra tes. The system does not permit any \noutward remittance.  \n \nb) The salient features of a tr ansaction under MTSS are as under: \n \ni) Receipt of cross-border inward remi ttance under MTSS is a transaction carried \nout on behalf of a remitter through an Over seas Principal located overseas by \nelectronic means with a view to maki ng an amount of money  available to a \nbeneficiary person at any of the outlets  of APs (Indian Agents) and their Sub-\nagents in India. The remitter and the beneficiary may be the same person. \n \nii) The remitter overseas places the order with the Overseas Principal to perform \nthe remittance under MTSS.  \n \nc)  MTSS is an instantaneous and one of t he routes for cross-border inward \ntransfer of funds from ac ross the globe and hence, ther e is a need for preventing \nterrorists and other criminals from havi ng unfettered access to this channel for \nmoving their funds and for detecting any misuse when it occurs. This can be achieved if basic information on the re mitter is immediately available to \nappropriate law enforce ment and/or prosecutorial author ities in order to assist \nthem in detecting, invest igating, prosecuting terrorists or other criminals and \ntracing their assets. The information can be used by Financial Intelligence Unit - 3 \n \nIndia (FIU-IND) for analysing suspicious or unusual activity and disseminating it \nas necessary. The remitter information can also be put to use by the APs (Indian \nAgents) to facilitate identif ication and reporting of suspic ious transactions to the \nFIU-IND. Owing to the potential terrorist financing threat posed by  small transfers, \nthe objective is to be in a position to trace all inward remittances under MTSS. \nAccordingly, APs (Indian Agents) must ensure that all remittances under MTSS \nare accompanied by the following information: \n \n\u201cAll cross-border inward remittances under MTSS must be accompanied by \naccurate and meaningful remitter info rmation (name, address and unique \nidentification number of each remittance like, MTCN) on funds transfer and \nrelated messages that are sent and t he information should remain with the \ntransfer or related message through the payment chain. A unique reference \nnumber, as prevalent in the country  concerned, must be included.\u201d \n \n3.2  Role of Overseas Principals and Indian Agents\n \n(a)  Overseas Principal \n \nAn Overseas Principal is the one that or iginates a cross-border inward remittance \ninto India as per the order placed by t he remitter. The Overseas Principal must \nensure that all inward remittances cont ain complete remitte r information. The \nOverseas Principal must also verify and preserve the information at least for a period of ten years. \n \n(b) Indian Agents \n \nIndian Agents should have effective risk- based procedures in place to identify \ncross-border inward remittances lacking co mplete remitter information. The lack \nof complete remitter info rmation may be considered as a factor in assessing \nwhether a cross-border inward remittance or related transactions are suspicious and whether they should be reported to the FIU-IND. The Indian Agent should \nalso take up the matter with the Overs eas Principal if a remittance is not \naccompanied by detailed information of  the fund remitter. If the Overseas \nPrincipal fails to furnish information on  the remitter, the Indian Agent should \nconsider restricting inward remittances or even terminating its business relationship with the Overseas Principal.  4 \n \nIndian Agents should, in relation to tie-up arrangement under MTSS, in addition \nto performing normal due diligence measures: \n \ni) Gather sufficient information about an Ov erseas Principal to understand fully \nthe nature of their business and to determi ne from publicly available information \nthe reputation of the institut ion and the quality of supervi sion, including whether it \nhas been subject to a money laundering or terrorist fi nancing investigation or \nregulatory action. \n \nii) Gather relevant docum ents and assess the Overseas  Principal\u2019s anti-money \nlaundering and terrorist financing controls. \n \niii) Obtain approval from senior management bef ore entering into a tie-up with an \nOverseas Principal. \n \niv) Document the respective respons ibilities of eac h institution. \n \n4.   Definition of Customer\n \nFor the purpose of KYC policy, a \u2018Customer\u2019 is defined as : \n \n\u0083 a person who receives occasional/  regular cross border inward \nremittances under MTSS;  \n\u0083 one on whose behalf a cross border inward remittance under MTSS is \nreceived (i.e. the beneficial owner).  \n \n5. Guidelines  \n \n5.1 General \n \nAPs (Indian Agents) should keep in mind that the information collected from the \ncustomer while making payme nt of cross border inward remittances is to be \ntreated as confidential and details thereof are not to be divulged for cross selling \nor any other like purposes. APs (Indian Agent s) should, therefore, ensure that \ninformation sought from the customer is relevant to the perceived risk, is not \nintrusive, and is in conformity with the gui delines issued in this regard. Any other \ninformation from the customer, wherever necessary, should be sought separately \nwith his/her consent. 5 \n \n \n5.2 KYC Policy \n \nAPs (Indian Agents) should frame their KYC policies incorpor ating the following \nfour key elements: \n \na) Customer Acceptance Policy; \n \nb) Customer Identific ation Procedures; \n \nc) Monitoring of Transactions; and \n \nd) Risk Management. \n \n5.3 Customer Acceptance Policy (CAP)\n \na) Every AP (Indian Agent) should develop a clear Customer Acceptance Policy \nlaying down explicit criteria for a cceptance of customers. The Customer \nAcceptance Policy must ensure that exp licit guidelines are in place on the \nfollowing aspects of customer rela tionship in the AP (Indian Agent). \n \ni) No remittance is received in anony mous or fictitious/benami name(s). \n \nii) Parameters of risk perception are clear ly defined in terms of the nature of \nbusiness activity, location of customer  and his clients, mode of payments, \nvolume of turnover, social and financial status, etc. to enabl e categorisation of \ncustomers into low, medium and high risk (APs may choose any suitable \nnomenclature viz. level I, level II and leve l III). Customers requiring very high \nlevel of monitoring, e.g. Politically Ex posed Persons (PEPs) may, if considered \nnecessary, be categorised even higher. \n \niii) Documentation requirements and other information to be collected in respect \nof different categories of customers depending on perceived risk and keeping in \nmind the requirements of Prevention of Money Launderi ng Act, (PMLA), 2002, as \namended by Prevention of Money Lau ndering (Amendment) Act, 2009, \nPrevention of Money-Launderin g (Maintenance of Records of the Nature and \nValue of Transactions, the Procedure and Manner of Maintaining and Time for \nFurnishing Information and Verification and Maintenance of Records of the 6 \n \nIdentity of the Clients of the Banking Companies, Financial Institutions and \nIntermediaries) Rules, 2005, as amended from time to time, as well as  \ninstructions / guidelines issued by t he Reserve Bank, from time to time. \n \niv)  Not to make payment of any remi ttance where the AP (Indian Agent) is \nunable to apply appropriate customer due diligence measures i.e. AP (Indian \nAgent) is unable to verify the identity and /or obtain documents required as per \nthe risk categorisation due to non-cooperation of t he customer or non reliability of \nthe data/information furnished to the AP (Indian Agent). It is, however, necessary \nto have suitable built in safeguards to  avoid harassment of the customer. \n \nv) Circumstances, in which a customer is permitted to act on behalf of another \nperson/entity, should be clearly spelt out, the beneficial owner should be \nidentified and all reasonable steps should be  taken to verify his identity.  \n \nb) APs (Indian Agents) should prepare a profile for each ne w customer, where \nregular cross-border inward remittances are/ expected to be received, based on \nrisk categorisation. The customer profile  may contain information relating to \ncustomer\u2019s identity, social / financial status, etc. The nature and extent of due diligence will depend on the risk perceived by the AP (Indian Agent). However, \nwhile preparing customer profile, APs (I ndian Agents) should take care to seek \nonly such information from the customer, which is relevant to the risk category \nand is not intrusive. The cu stomer profile is a confi dential document and details \ncontained therein should not be divulged for cross selling or any other purposes. \n \nc) For the purpose of risk cat egorisation, individuals (o ther than High Net Worth) \nand entities whose identities and sources of wealth can be easily identified and \ntransactions by whom by and large co nform to the know n profile, may be \ncategorised as low risk. Customers that are likely to pose a higher than average risk should be categorised as medium or high risk depending on customer's background, nature and location of activity , country of origin, sources of funds \nand his client profile, et c. APs should apply enhance d due diligence measures \nbased on the risk assessment, thereby requi ring intensive \u2018due diligence\u2019 for \nhigher risk customers, especially those for whom the sources of funds are not \nclear. Examples of customers requiri ng enhanced due diligence include (a) non-7 \n \nresident customers; (b)  cu stomers from countries that do not or insufficiently \napply  the FATF standards;  (c) high net wort h individuals; (d) politically exposed \npersons (PEPs); (e) non-face to face customers; and (f) those with dubious \nreputation as per public info rmation available, etc.  \n \nd) It is important  to bear in mind that  the adoption of cu stomer acceptance  policy \nand its implementation should not become t oo restrictive and must not result in \ndenial of cross border inward remi ttance facilities to general public. \n \n5.4 Customer Identification Procedure (CIP) \n \na) The policy approved by the Board of APs (Indian Agents) should clearly spell \nout the Customer Identifi cation Procedure while making payment to a beneficiary \nor when the AP has a doubt about the authenticity/veracity  or the adequacy of the \npreviously obtained customer  identification data. Cust omer identification means \nidentifying the customer and verifying his/her identity by using reliable, \nindependent source documents,  data or information. APs (Indian Agents) need to \nobtain sufficient information necessary to establish, to their satisfaction, the \nidentity of each new custom er, whether regular or o ccasional. Being satisfied \nmeans that the AP must be able to sa tisfy the competent authorities that due \ndiligence was observed based on the risk pr ofile of the customer in compliance \nwith the extant guidelines in place. Such risk based approach is considered \nnecessary to avoid disproportionate cost to APs (Indian Agents) and a \nburdensome regime for the customers. The APs (Indian Agents) should obtain \nsufficient identification dat a to verify the identity of the customer and his \naddress/location. For customers that are natural persons, the APs (Indian Agents) should obtain sufficient  identification document /s to verify the identity of \nthe customer and his address/ location. For customers that are legal persons, the \nAP (Indian Agent) should (i) verify the le gal status of the legal person through \nproper and relevant documents; (ii) verify that any person purporting to act on behalf of the legal person is  so authorised and identify and verify the identity of \nthat person; and (iii) underst and the ownership and c ontrol structure of the \ncustomer and determine who are the natural  persons who ultimately control the \nlegal person. Customer ident ification requirements in respect of a few typical \ncases, especially, legal persons requiring an  extra element of caution are given in 8 \n \nparagraph 5.5 below for guidance of APs (Indian Agents). APs (Indian Agents) \nmay, however, frame their own internal guidelines based on their experience of dealing with such persons, their normal prudence and the legal requirements as \nper established practices. If the AP (Indi an Agent) decides to undertake such \ntransactions in terms of the Custom er Acceptance Poli cy, the AP (Indian \nAgent) should take reasonable measures to identify the beneficial owner(s) and \ntake all reasonable steps to  verify his identity.  \n \nb)  Some  close relatives, e.g. wife, son, daughter and parents, etc. who live with \ntheir husband, father / mot her and son / daughter, as the case may be, may find it \ndifficult to undertake transactions with APs (Indian Agents) as the utility bills \nrequired for address verification are not in t heir name. It is clarified, that in such \ncases, APs (Indian Agents) can obtain an identity document and a utility bill of the \nrelative with whom the prospective cust omer is living along with a declaration \nfrom the relative that the said person (prospective customer) wanting to \nundertake a transaction is a relative and is staying with him/her. APs (Indian \nAgents) can use any supplementary evidence such as a letter received through \npost for further verification of the address.  While issuing operat ional instructions \nto the branches on the subject, APs (Indian Agents) should keep in mind the spirit \nof instructions issued by the Rese rve Bank and avoid undue hardships to \nindividuals who are, otherwise, cl assified as low risk customers. \n \nc)  APs (Indian Agents)  should introduce a system of periodical updation of \ncustomer identification dat a, if there is a cont inuing relationship.  \n \nd)  An indicative list of the type of documents / information that may be relied \nupon for customer identification is given in Annex-II to this  Circular. It is clarified \nthat permanent correct address, as referre d to in Annex-II, means the address at \nwhich a person usually resides and can be taken as the address as mentioned in \na utility bill or any other  document accepted by the AP for verification of the \naddress of the customer.  \n \n \n \n \n 9 \n \ne) Payment to Beneficiaries \n \ni) For payment to beneficiaries in Indian  Rupees, the identific ation documents, as \nmentioned at Annex-II of this circular, should be verified and a copy retained.  \n \nii) A cap of USD 2500 has been placed on individual remittances under the \nscheme. Amounts up to Rs. 50,000 may be paid in cash. Any amount exceeding \nthis limit shall be paid only by means of cheque/D.D./P.O. etc. or  credited directly \nto the beneficiary's bank account. Howeve r, in exceptional circumstances, where \nthe beneficiary is a foreign tourist, hi gher amounts may be disbursed in cash. \nOnly 12 remittances can be received by a single individual during a calendar \nyear. \n \n5.5 Customer Identification Requirements \u2013 Transactions by Politically \nExposed Persons (PEPs)- Indicative Guidelines  \n \nPolitically exposed persons are individual s who are or have been entrusted with \nprominent public functions in a foreign country, e.g., Heads of States or of \nGovernments, senior politicians, senior  government/judicial/ military officers, \nsenior executives of state- owned corporations, important political party officials, \netc. APs (Indian Agents) should gat her sufficient information on any \nperson/customer of this category int ending to undertake a transaction and check \nall the information availabl e on the person in the pub lic domain. APs (Indian \nAgents) should verify the identity of the person and seek information about the \nsource /s of wealth and source /s of funds before accepting the PEP as a \ncustomer. The decision to undertake a transaction with a PEP should be taken at \na senior level which should be clearly s pelt out in Customer Acceptance Policy. \nAPs (Indian Agents) should also subject such transactions to enhanced \nmonitoring on an ongoing basis. The above norms may also be applied to transactions with the family members or  close relatives of PEPs. The above \nnorms may also be applied to custom ers who become PEPs subsequent to \nestablishment of the business relationship. \n \n5.6   Monitoring of Transactions\n \nOngoing monitoring is an essential elem ent of effective KYC procedures. APs \n(Indian Agents) can effectivel y control and reduce their ri sk only if they have an 10 \n \nunderstanding of the normal and reasonable receipt of remittances of the \nbeneficiary so that they have the means of identifying rece ipts that fall outside the \nregular pattern of activity. However, t he extent of monitori ng will depend on the \nrisk sensitivity of the remittance. APs (Indian Agents) should pay  special attention \nto all complex, unusually large receipts and all unusual patterns which have no \napparent economic or visible lawful purpose. APs (Indian Agents) may prescribe \nthreshold limits for a particular category of  receipts and pay particular attention to \nthe receipts which exceed these limits. High-risk receipts have to be subjected to intense monitoring. Every AP (India n Agent) should set key indicators for such \nreceipts, taking note of the background of the customer, such as the country of \norigin, sources of funds, the type of transactions involved and other risk factors. \nAPs (Indian Agents) should put in place a system of periodical review of risk categorization of custom ers and the need for applyi ng enhanced due diligence \nmeasures. Such review of risk categoris ation of customers should be carried out \nperiodically. \n \n5.7   Attempted transactions  \n \nWhere the AP (Indian Agent) is unable to apply appropriate KYC measures due \nto non-furnishing of information and /or non-cooperation by the customer, the AP \nshould not undertake the transaction. Un der these circumstances, APs should \nmake a suspicious transactions report to  FIU-IND in relati on to the customer, \neven if the transaction is not put through. \n \n5.8    Risk Management \n \na)  The Board of Directors of the AP (I ndian Agent) should ensure that an \neffective KYC programme is put in place by establishing appropriate procedures and ensuring effective implementation. It should cover proper management \noversight, systems and contro ls, segregation of duties, training and other related \nmatters. Responsibility should be explicitly  allocated within t he AP (Indian Agent) \nfor ensuring that the APs\u2019 policies and pr ocedures are implemented effectively. \nAPs (Indian Agents) should, in consultati on with their Boards, devise procedures \nfor creating risk profiles of their exis ting and new customer s and apply various 11 \n \nanti money laundering measures keeping  in view the risks involved in a \ntransaction. \n \nb) APs\u2019 (Indian Agents) internal audit and compliance functions have an \nimportant role in eval uating and ensuring adherence to the KYC policies and \nprocedures. As a general rule, the compliance function should provide an \nindependent evaluation of the AP\u2019s (Indian Agent\u2019s) ow n policies and procedures, \nincluding legal and regulatory requirement s. APs (Indian Agents) should ensure \nthat their audit machinery is staffed adequately with individuals who are well-\nversed in such policies and procedures. The concurrent au ditors should check all \ncross border inward remittance transactions  under MTSS to verify that they have \nbeen undertaken in compli ance with the anti-money laundering guidelines and \nhave been reported whenever required to the concerned authorities. Compliance \non the lapses, if any, recorded by the conc urrent auditors should be put up to the \nBoard. A certificate from  the Statutory Auditors on the compliance with KYC / \nAML / CFT guidelines should be obtained at t he time of preparation of the Annual \nReport and kept on record.  \n \n5.9 Introduction of New Technologies \n \nAPs (Indian Agents) should pay special a ttention to any money laundering threats \nthat may arise from new or develop ing technologies including transactions \nthrough internet that might favour anonymity and take measures, to prevent their use for money laundering purposes and fi nancing of terrorism activities.  \n \n5.10 Combating Financing of Terrorism \n \na)   In  terms of  PML  Rules,  suspic ious  transaction  should  include inter alia \ntransactions which give rise to a reas onable ground of suspicion that these may \ninvolve the proceeds of an offence m entioned in the Schedule to the PMLA, \nregardless of the value invo lved. APs (Indian Agents) s hould, therefore, develop \nsuitable mechanism through appropriate  policy framework for enhanced \nmonitoring of transactions suspected of having terrorist links and swift identification of the transactions and maki ng suitable reports to the FIU-IND on \npriority. \n 12 \n \nb)  APs (Indian Agents) are advised to ta ke into account risks arising from the \ndeficiencies in AML/CFT regime of certai n jurisdictions viz. Iran, Uzbekistan, \nPakistan, Turkmenistan, Sao Tome and Prin cipe, as identified in FATF Statement \n(www.fatf-gafi.org ) issued from time to time, whil e dealing with individuals from \nthese jurisdictions. \n \n5.11   Principal Officer \n \n(a) APs (Indian Agents) should appoint a senior management officer to be \ndesignated as Principal Officer. Principal Officer shall be located at the \nhead/corporate office of the AP and sha ll be responsible for monitoring and \nreporting of all transactions and sharing of  information as required under the law. \nThe Principal Officer should also be re sponsible for developing appropriate \ncompliance management arrangements acro ss the full range of  AML/CFT areas \n(e.g. CDD, record keeping, etc.). He will maintain close liaison with enforcement \nagencies, APs (Indian Agents) and any other institution which are involved in the \nfight against money launderin g and combating financing of terrorism. To enable \nthe Principal Officer to discharge his respons ibilities, it is advis ed that that the \nPrincipal Officer and other appropriate staff should have timely access to \ncustomer identification data and other CDD information, transaction records and other relevant information. Further, banks should ensure that the Principal Officer is able to act independently and report directly to the senior management or to the Board of Directors. \n \n(b) The Principal Officer will be responsible for timely submission of CTR and \nSTR to the FIU-IND. \n \n5.12 Maintenance of records of transactions/Information to be \npreserved/Maintenance and preservation of  records/Cash and Suspicious \nTransactions Reporting to Financial Intelligence Uni t- India (FIU-IND)   \n \nSection 12 of the Prevention of  Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 , as \namended by Prevention of Money La undering (Amendment) Act, 2009, casts \ncertain obligations on the APs (Indian Ag ents) in regard to preservation and \nreporting of transaction information. APs (I ndian Agents) are, therefore, advised \nto go through the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, (PMLA), \n2002, as amended by Prevention of M oney Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2009 13 \n \nand the Rules notified there under and take  all steps considered necessary to \nensure compliance with the requirement s of Section 12 of the Act ibid .  \n \n(i) Maintenance of records of transactions \n \nAPs (Indian Agents) should introduce a system of maintaining proper record of \ntransactions prescribed under Ru le 3, as mentioned below: \n \na) all cash transactions of the value of more than Rupees Ten Lakh or its \nequivalent in foreign currency; \n \nb) all series of cash transactions integr ally connected to each other which have \nbeen valued below Rupees Ten Lakh or its equivalent in fore ign currency, where \nsuch series of transactions hav e taken place within a month ; and \n \nc) all suspicious transactions whether or  not made in cash and by way of as \nmentioned in the Rules.  \n \n(ii) Information to be preserved\n \nAPs (Indian Agents) are required to mainta in the following information in respect \nof transactions referred to in Rule 3: \n \na) the nature of the transaction; \nb) the amount of the transaction and t he currency in which it was  \ndenominated;  \nc) the date on which the transaction was conducted; and \nd) the parties to the transaction. \n \n(iii) Maintenance and Preservation of Record \n \na) APs (Indian Agents) are required to maintain the records containing \ninformation in respect of transactions re ferred to in Rule 3 above. APs (Indian \nAgents) should take appropriate steps to  evolve a system for proper maintenance \nand preservation of transaction information in  a manner that allows data to be \nretrieved easily and quickly whenever required or when requested by the \ncompetent authorities. Furt her, APs (Indian Agents) should maintain for at least \nten years  from the date of tr ansaction between the AP and the client, all 14 \n \nnecessary records of transactions, bot h with residents and non-residents, which \nwill permit reconstruction of  individual transactions (including the amounts and \ntypes of currency involved, if any) so as  to provide, if necessary, evidence for \nprosecution of persons involved in criminal activity. \n \nb) APs (Indian Agents) should ensure that records pertaining to the identification \nof the customer and his ad dress (e.g. copies of documents like passport, driving \nlicense, PAN card, voter identity card issued by the Election Commission, utility \nbills, etc.) obtained while undertaking the transaction, ar e properly preserved for \nat least ten years from the date of cessation of the business relationship. The \nidentification records and transaction dat a should be made available to the \ncompetent authorit ies upon request. \n \nc)  In paragraph 5.6 of this Circular, APs  (Indian Agents) have been advised to \npay special attention to all complex, unus ual large transactions and all unusual \npatterns of transactions, which have no apparent economic or  visible lawful \npurpose. It is further clarif ied that the background includi ng all documents/office \nrecords / memoranda pertaining to such tr ansactions and purpose thereof should, \nas far as possible, be examined and the fi ndings at branch as well as Principal \nOfficer\u2019s level should be properly recor ded. Such records and related documents \nshould be made available to hel p auditors in their day-to -day work relating to \nscrutiny of transactions and also to Reserve Bank/other relevant authorities. These records are required to be preserv ed for ten years as is required under \nPrevention of Money Laundering Act, (PML A), 2002, as amended by Prevention \nof Money Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2009 and Prevention of Money-\nLaundering (Maintenance of Records of the Nature and Value of Transactions, \nthe Procedure and Manner of Maintaining and Time for Furnishing Information \nand Verification and Maintenance of Records of the Identity of the Clients of the \nBanking Companies, Financial Institutions  and Intermediaries) Rules, 2005, as \namended from time to time. \n \n(iv)   Reporting to Financ ial Intelligence Unit \u2013 India \n \na)  In terms of the PML rules, APs (Indian Agents) are required to report \ninformation relating to cash and suspicious  transactions to the Director, Financial 15 \n \nIntelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) in respect of transactions referred to in Rule 3 at \nthe following address: \n \nThe Director,  \nFinancial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND), \n6th Floor, Hotel Samrat, \nChanakyapuri, New Delhi-110021 . \nWebsite - http://fiuindia.gov.in/\n \nb)  APs (Indian Agents) should carefully go through all the reporting formats. \nThere are altogether four r eporting formats, as detailed in  Annex III, viz. i) Cash \nTransactions Report (CTR); ii) Electronic File Structure-CTR; iii) Suspicious \nTransactions Report (STR); and iv) Electronic File Structure-STR. The reporting \nformats contain detailed guidelines on the compilation and manner/procedure of submission of the reports to FIU-IND.  It would be necessary for APs (Indian \nAgents) to initiate urgent steps to ensure electronic filing of all types of reports to \nFIU-IND. The related hardwar e and technical requirement for preparing reports in \nan electronic format, the related data files and data structures thereof are \nfurnished in the instructions part of the formats concerned. \n \nc)  In terms of instructions contained in paragraph 5.3(b) of this Circular, APs \n(Indian Agents) are required to  prepare a profile for each  customer based on risk \ncategorisation. Further, vi de paragraph 5.6, the need for per iodical review of risk \ncategorisation has been emphasized. It is, t herefore, reiterated that APs (Indian \nAgents), as a part of transaction monitoring mechanism, are required to put in place an appropriate software application to throw alerts when the transactions \nare inconsistent with risk categorization and updated profile of customers. It is \nneedless to add that a robust software throwing alerts is essential for effective identification and reporting of  suspicious transactions. \n \n5.13   Cash and Suspicious Transaction Reports \n \nA) Cash Transaction Report (CTR) \n \nWhile detailed instructions for filing a ll types of reports are given in the \ninstructions part of the related formats, APs (Indian Agents) should scrupulously adhere to the following: 16 \n \n \ni)  The Cash Transaction Report (CTR) fo r each month should be submitted to \nthe FIU-IND by 15th of the succeeding m onth. Cash transaction reporting by \nbranches to their controlling offices should,  therefore, invariably be submitted on \na monthly  basis and APs (Indian Agents) should ensure to submit CTR for every \nmonth to FIU-IND within t he prescribed time schedule. \n \nii) While filing CTR, details of individual  transactions below Rs.50,000 need not \nbe furnished. \n \niii) CTR should contain only the transactions  carried out by the AP on behalf of \ntheir customers excluding transactions bet ween the internal accounts of the AP.   \n \niv)  A cash transaction report for the AP as a whole should be compiled by the \nPrincipal Officer of the AP  every month in physical form as per the format \nspecified. The report should be signed by  the Principal Officer and submitted to \nthe FIU-IND. \n \nv) In case of Cash Transaction Reports (CTR) compiled centrally by APs (Indian \nAgents) for the branches at their central data centre level, APs (Indian Agents) \nmay generate centralised Cash Transac tion Reports (CTR) in respect of \nbranches under central computerized en vironment at one point for onward \ntransmission to FIU-IND, provided: \n \na) The CTR is generated in the format pre scribed by Reserve Bank in Para \n5.12(iv)(b) of this Circular. \n \nb)  A copy of the monthly CTR submitted on its behalf to  the FIU-IND is available \nat the branch concerned for production to  auditors/inspectors, when asked for. \n \nc) The instruction on \u2018Maintenance of record s of transactions\u2019, \u2018Information to be \npreserved\u2019 and  \u2018Maintenance an d Preservation of records\u2019 as contained above in \nthis circular at Para 5.12 (i), (ii) and ( iii) respectively are scrupulously followed by \nthe branch. \n 17 \n \nHowever, in respect of branches not un der central computer ized environment, \nthe monthly CTR should be compiled and forwarded by the branch to the \nPrincipal Officer for onward transmission to the FIU-IND. \n \nB) Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) \n \ni) While determining suspicious transac tions, APs (Indian Agents) should be \nguided by definition of suspicious tr ansaction contained in PML Rules, as \namended from time to time. \n \nii) It is likely that in some cases,  transactions are abandoned/ aborted by \ncustomers on being asked to give some det ails or to provide documents. It is \nclarified that APs (Indian A gents) should report all such attempted transactions in \nSTRs, even if not completed by customers, irrespective of the amount of the transaction. \n \niii) APs (Indian Agents) should make STRs if they have reasonable ground to \nbelieve that the transaction, including an attempted transaction, involves proceeds of crime generally irrespective of the amount of transaction and/or the \nthreshold limit envisaged for predicate offences in part B of Schedule of \nPrevention of Money Laundering Act, (PML A), 2002, as amended by Prevention \nof Money Laundering (A mendment) Act, 2009. \n \niv) The Suspicious Transaction Report (S TR) should be furnished within 7 days \nof arriving at a conclusion that any transaction, including an attempted \ntransaction, whether cash or non-cash, or a series of transactions integrally connected are of suspicious nature. The Principal Officer should record his reasons for treating any transaction or a se ries of transactions as suspicious. It \nshould be ensured that there is no undue delay in arrivi ng at such a conclusion \nonce a suspicious transaction report is re ceived from a branch or any other office. \nSuch report should be made available to  the competent aut horities on request. \n \nv) In the context of creating KYC/ AML awareness among the staff and for \ngenerating alerts for suspicious transactions, APs (Indian Agents) may consider the following indicative list of suspicious activities. \n 18 \n \nSome possible suspicious activity  indicators are given below: \n\u0083 Customer is reluctant to provide det ails / documents on frivolous grounds.  \n\u0083 The transaction is undertaken by one or  more intermediaries to protect the \nidentity of the beneficiary or  hide their involvement.  \n\u0083 Large amount of remittances.  \n\u0083 Size and frequency of transactions is high considering the normal \nbusiness of the customer.  \n \nThe above list is only indicative and not exhaustive.  \n \nvi) APs (Indian Agents) should not pu t any restrictions on payment to \nbeneficiaries where an STR has been made.  Moreover, it should be ensured that \nemployees of APs shall keep the fact of furnishing such information as strictly \nconfidential and there is no tipping off to the customer at any level.  \n \n5.14   Customer Education/Employ ees\u2019 Training/Employees\u2019 Hiring  \n \na) Customer Education  \n \nImplementation of KYC procedures r equires APs (Indian Agents) to demand \ncertain information from customers which may be of personal nature or which has \nhitherto never been called for. This can so metimes lead to a lot of questioning by \nthe customer as to the motive and purpos e of collecting such information. There \nis, therefore, a need for APs (Indian Agent s) to prepare specific literature/ \npamphlets, etc. so as to educate the customer of the objec tives of the KYC \nprogramme. The front desk staff needs to  be specially trained to handle such \nsituations while dealing with customers. \n \nb) Employees\u2019 Training  \n \nAPs (Indian Agents) must have an ongoing employee training programme so that \nthe members of the staff are adequately trained to be aware of the policies and \nprocedures relating to prevention of money  laundering, provisions of the PMLA \nand the need to monitor all tr ansactions to ensure that no suspicious activity is \nbeing undertaken under the guise of remi ttances. Training requirements should \nhave different focuses for frontline staff,  compliance staff and staff dealing with \nnew customers. It is crucial that all those concerned fully under stand the rationale 19 \n \nbehind the KYC policies and implement them consistently. The steps to be taken \nwhen the staff come across any suspic ious transactions (such as asking \nquestions about the source of funds, ch ecking the identification documents \ncarefully, reporting immediately to the Prin cipal Officer, etc.) should be carefully \nformulated by the APs (Indian Agents)  and suitable procedure laid down. The \nAPs (Indian Agents) should have an ongoing training programme for consistent \nimplementation of the AML measures. \n \nc) Hiring of Employees \n \nIt may be appreciated that KYC norms/A ML standards/CFT measures have been \nprescribed to ensure that criminals are not allowed to misuse the system of \nmoney transfer under MTSS. It would, therefore, be  necessary that adequate \nscreening mechanism is put in place by APs (Indian Agents) as an integral part of \ntheir recruitment/hiring process of personnel to ensure high standards.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 \n \nAnnex-II  \n \n[Annex to A.P.

Introduction \nThe offence of Money Laundering has  been defined in Section 3 of the \nPrevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) as \"whosoever directly or \nindirectly attempts to indu lge or knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or is \nactually involved in any process or activity connect ed with the proceeds of crime \nand projecting it as untai nted property shall be guilt y of offence of money \nlaundering\". Money Laundering can be called a process by which money or other \nassets obtained as proceeds  of crime are exchanged fo r \"clean money\" or other \nassets with no obvious link to their criminal origins. \n \nThere are three stages of money l aundering during which there may be \nnumerous transactions made by launderers that could alert an  institution to \ncriminal activity \u2013 \n\u2022 Placement - the physical disposal of cash  proceeds derived from illegal \nactivity. \n\u2022 Layering - separating illicit proceeds fr om their source by creating \ncomplex layers of financial transactions  designed to disguise the audit trail \nand provide anonymity. \n\u2022 Integration  - the provision of apparent legi timacy to criminally derived \nwealth. If the layering process has succeeded, integration schemes place \nthe laundered proceeds back into the econom y in such a way that they re-\nenter the financial system appeari ng to be normal business funds. \n 2 \n \n2.  The objective \n \nThe objective of prescribi ng KYC/AML/CFT guidelines is to prevent the system of \npurchase and / or sale of foreign curre ncy notes / Travellers' Cheques by \nAuthorised Persons (referr ed as APs hereinafter) from being used, intentionally \nor unintentionally, by crimi nal elements for money launder ing or terrorist financing \nactivities. KYC procedures also enable AP s to know / understand their customers \nand their financial dealings better whic h in turn help them manage their risks \nprudently. \n \n3.   Definition of Customer\n \nFor the purpose of KYC policy, a \u2018Customer\u2019 is defined as : \n\u2022 a person who undertakes occasional/regular transactions;  \n\u2022 an entity that has a business relationship with the AP;  \n\u2022 one on whose behalf the transaction is made (i.e. the beneficial owner).  \n4. Guidelines  \n \n4.1 General \nAPs should keep in mind that the informa tion collected from the customer while \nundertaking transactions is to be treated as confidential and details thereof are \nnot to be divulged for cross selling or  any other like purposes. APs should, \ntherefore, ensure that information sought from the custom er is relevant to the \nperceived risk, is not intrusive, and is in conformity with the guidelines issued in \nthis regard. Any other information from  the customer, wherever necessary, \nshould be sought separately with his/her consent. \n \n4.2 KYC Policy \n \nAPs should frame their KYC policies in corporating the following four key \nelements: \n a) Customer Acceptance Policy; \nb) Customer Identific ation Procedures; \nc) Monitoring of Transactions; and \nd) Risk Management. 3 \n \n4.3 Customer Acceptance Policy (CAP)\n \na) Every AP should develop a clear Cust omer Acceptance Policy laying down \nexplicit criteria for acceptance of customers. The Customer  Acceptance Policy \nmust ensure that explicit guidelines are in place on the following aspects of \ncustomer relationship in the AP: \n \ni) No transaction is conducted in anony mous or fictitious/benami name(s). \n \nii) Parameters of risk perception are clear ly defined in terms of the nature of \nbusiness activity, location of customer  and his clients, mode of payments, \nvolume of turnover, social and financial status, etc. to enabl e categorisation of \ncustomers into low, medium and high risk (APs may choose any suitable \nnomenclature viz. level I, level II and leve l III). Customers requiring very high \nlevel of monitoring, e.g. Politically Ex posed Persons (PEPs) may, if considered \nnecessary, be categorised even higher. \n \niii) Documentation requirements and other information to be collected in respect \nof different categories of customers depending on perceived risk and keeping in \nmind the requirements of Prevention of Money Launderi ng Act, (PMLA), 2002, as \namended by Prevention of Money Lau ndering (Amendment) Act, 2009,  \nPrevention of Money-Launderin g (Maintenance of Records of the Nature and \nValue of Transactions, the Procedure and Manner of Maintaining and Time for \nFurnishing Information and Verification and Maintenance of Records of the Identity of the Clients of the Banking Companies, Financial Institutions and Intermediaries) Rules, 2005 \nas well as  instructions/guidelines issued by the \nReserve Bank, from time to time. \n \niv) Not to undertake any transaction wher e the AP is unable to apply appropriate \ncustomer due diligence measures i.e. AP is unable to verify the identity and /or \nobtain documents required as per the risk categorisation due to non cooperation \nof the customer or non re liability of the data/information furnished to the AP. It is, \nhowever, necessary to have suitable built in safeguards to avoid harassment of \nthe customer.  4 \n \nv) Circumstances, in which a customer is permitted to act on behalf of another \nperson/entity, should be clearly spelt out, the beneficial owner should be \nidentified and all reasonable steps should be taken to verify his identity. \n \nb) APs should prepare a profile for each customer, where a business relationship \nis established, based on risk categorisati on. The customer profile may contain \ninformation relating to customer\u2019s identity,  his sources of funds, social/financial \nstatus, nature of business activity, info rmation about his clients\u2019 business and \ntheir location, etc. The natur e and extent of due diligence will depend on the risk \nperceived by the AP. Howeve r, while preparing customer  profile, APs should take \ncare to seek only such information from the customer, which is relevant to the risk \ncategory. The customer prof ile is a confidential docu ment and details contained \ntherein should not be divulged for cross selling or any other purposes. \n \nc) For the purpose of risk cat egorisation, individuals (ot her than High Net Worth) \nand entities whose identities and sources of wealth can be easily identified and \ntransactions by whom by and large co nform to the know n profile, may be \ncategorised as low risk. Customers that are likely to pose a higher than average \nrisk should be categorised as medium or high risk depending on customer's \nbackground, nature and location of activity , country of origin, sources of funds \nand his client profile etc. APs shoul d apply enhanced due diligence measures \nbased on the risk assessment, thereby requi ring intensive \u2018due diligence\u2019 for \nhigher risk customers, especially those for whom the sources of funds are not \nclear.  Examples of customers requiri ng enhanced due diligence include (a) non-\nresident customers; (b)  cu stomers from countries that do not or insufficiently \napply  the FATF standards;  (c ) high net worth individuals ; (d) trusts, charities, \nNGOs and organizations receiving donations ; (e) companies having close family \nshareholding  or  beneficial  ownership; (f )  firms with  ' sleeping partners'; (g) \npolitically exposed persons (PEPs); (h) non- face to face customers; and (i) those \nwith dubious reputation as pe r public information available etc. However, only \nNPOs/NGOs promoted by United Nations or its agencies may be classified as low risk customer.  5 \n \nd) It is important  to bear in mind that  the adoption of cu stomer acceptance  policy \nand its implementation should not become t oo restrictive and must not result in \ndenial of money changing services to general public. \n \n4.4 Customer Identification Procedure (CIP) \n \na) The policy approved by the Board of APs  should clearly spe ll out the Customer \nIdentification Procedur e to be carried out at different stages i.e. while establishing \na business relationship; carrying out a financial transaction or when the AP has a \ndoubt about the authenticity/veracity or  the adequacy of the previously obtained \ncustomer identification dat a. Customer identificatio n means identifying the \ncustomer and verifying his/ her identity by using reli able, independent source \ndocuments, data or information. APs need to obtain sufficient information necessary to establish, to their satisf action, the identity of  each new customer, \nwhether occasional or business relations hip, and the purpose of the intended \nnature of relationship. Being satisfied m eans that the AP must  be able to satisfy \nthe competent authorities that due dili gence was observed based on the risk \nprofile of the customer in  compliance with the extant guidelines in place. Such \nrisk based approach is considered necessary  to avoid disproportionate cost to \nAPs and a burdensome regime for the custom ers. Besides risk perception, the \nnature of information/documents requir ed would also depend on the type of \ncustomer (individual, corporat e, etc.). For customers th at are natural persons, the \nAPs should obtain sufficient identification  doc ument /s to verify the identity of the \ncustomer and his address/location. For customers that are legal persons or entities, the AP should (i) verify the le gal status of the legal person / entity \nthrough proper and relevant docu ments; (ii) verify that any person purporting to \nact on behalf of the legal person/entity is so authorised and identify and verify the \nidentity of that person; and (iii) understand the ownership  and control structure of \nthe customer and determine who are the natural persons who ultimately control the legal person. Customer identification requirements in respect of a few typical \ncases, especially, legal persons requiring an  extra element of caution are given in \nparagraph 4.5 below for guidance of APs. APs may, however, frame their own \ninternal guidelines based on their exper ience of dealing wit h such persons / \nentities, their normal prudence and the legal requirements as  per established \npractices. If the AP decides to undertake such transactions in terms of the 6 \n \nCustomer Acceptance Policy, the AP should take reasonable measures to \nidentify the beneficial owner(s) and take all r easonable steps to ve rify his identity. \n \nb)  Some  close relatives, e.g. wife, son, daughter and parents, etc. who live with \ntheir husband, father/mother and son, as the case may be, may find it difficult to \nundertake transactions with APs as t he utility bills required for address \nverification are not in their nam e. It is clarified, that in such cases, APs can obtain \nan identity document and a util ity bill of the relative with whom the prospective \ncustomer is living along with a declaratio n from the relative that the said person \n(prospective customer) wanting to undertake a transaction is a relative and is \nstaying with him/her. APs can use any su pplementary evidence such as a letter \nreceived through post for further verifi cation of the address. While issuing \noperational instructions to the branches on the subject, APs should keep in mind \nthe spirit of instructions issued by t he Reserve Bank and avoid undue hardships \nto individuals who are, otherwise, classified as low risk customers. \n \nc)  APs should introduce a system of periodic updation of customer identification \ndata (including photograph/s) if there is a continuing business relationship.  \n \nd)  An indicative list of the nature and type of documents/information that may be \nrelied upon for customer identification is  given in (F-Part-II ) annexed to this \nCircular. It is clarified that correct permanent address, as referred to in (F-Part-II) annexed, means the address at  which a person usually resides and can be taken \nas the address as mentioned in  a utility bill or any other document accepted by \nthe AP for verification of t he address of the customer.  \n \ne) Purchase of foreign exchange from customers \n \ni) For purchase of foreign currency notes  and/ or Travellers\u2019 Cheques from \ncustomers for any amount less than US $ 200 or its equivalen t, photocopies of \nthe identification document need not be obtained. However, full details of the identification document should be maintained. \n \nii) For purchase of foreign currency notes  and/ or Travelle rs\u2019 Cheques from \ncustomers for any amount in  excess of US $ 200 or  its equivalent, the  7 \n \nidentification documents, as mentioned at (F-Part-II) annexed to this Circular, \nshould be verified and a copy retained.  \n \niii) (a) Requests for payment in cash in Indian Rupees to resident customers \ntowards purchase of foreign currency not es and/ or Travellers\u2019 Cheques from \nthem may be acceded to the extent of only US $ 1000 or its equivalent per \ntransaction.  \n \n(b) Requests for payment in cash by fore ign visitors / Non-Re sident Indians may \nbe acceded to the extent of onl y US $ 3000 or its equivalent.  \n \n(c) All purchases within one month may be treated as single transaction for the \nabove purpose and also for reporting purposes.  \n \n(d) In all other cases, APs should ma ke payment by way of 'Account Payee' \ncheque / demand draft only.  \n \nv) Where the amount of forex tendered for encashment by a non-resident or a \nperson returning from abroad exceeds  the limits prescribed for Currency \nDeclaration Form (CDF), the AP should in variably insist for production of the \ndeclaration in CDF.  \n \nvi)  In case of any suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, \nirrespective of the amount involved,  enhanced Customer Due Diligence (CDD) \nshould be applied. \n \nf) Sale of foreign exchange to customers \n \n(i) In all cases of sale of foreign exch ange, irrespective of the amount \ninvolved, for identification purpose the pass port of the customer should be \ninsisted upon and sale of foreign exch ange should be made only on personal \napplication and after verification of the identification document. A copy of the \nidentification document shoul d be retained by the AP.  \n \n(ii) Payment in excess of Rs. 50,000 toward s sale of foreign exchange should be \nreceived only by crossed cheque drawn on  the bank account of the applicant\u2019s \nfirm / company sponsoring the visit of  the applicant / Banker\u2019s cheque / Pay 8 \n \nOrder / Demand Draft.  Su ch payment can also be received through debit cards / \ncredit cards / prepaid cards provided (a) KYC/ AML guidelines are complied with, \n(b) sale of foreign currency / issue of Foreign Currency Travellers\u2019 cheques is \nwithin the limits (credit / prepaid cards) prescribed by the bank, (c) the purchaser \nof foreign currency / Foreign Currency Travellers\u2019 Cheque and the credit / debit / \nprepaid card holder is one and the same person. \n \n(iii) All purchases made by a person wit hin one month may be treated as single \ntransaction for the above purpose and also for reporting purposes.  \n \n(iv) Encashment Certificate, wherever required, should also be insisted upon.  \n \ng) Establishment of business relationship \n \nRelationship with a business entity like a company / fi rm/ trusts and foundations \nshould be established only after conducting due diligence by obtaining and verifying suitable documents, as mentioned at (F-Part-II ) annexed to this Circular. \nCopies of all documents called for verification should be kept on record. APs should obtain information on the purpose and intended nature of the business \nrelationship. APs should exercise ongo ing due diligence with  respect to the \nbusiness relationship with every client and  closely examine the transactions in \norder to ensure that they are consistent  with their knowledge of the customer, its \nbusiness and risk profile.  APs should ensur e that documents, data or information \ncollected under the Cu stomer Due Diligence proce ss is kept up-to-date and \nrelevant by undertaking reviews of existing records, particularly for higher risk categories of customers or business relationships. When a business relationship is already in existence and it is not po ssible to perform cust omer due diligence on \nthe customer  in respect of business relationship, APs should terminate the business relationship and make a Suspic ious Transaction Report to FIU-IND. \n \n4.5 Customer Identification Requi rements \u2013 Indicative Guidelines \n \ni) Transactions by Trust/Nominee or Fiduciary Customers\n \nThere exists the possibility that trust/nominee or fiduciary relationship can be \nused to circumvent the customer identif ication procedures. APs should determine \nwhether the customer is acting on behalf  of another person as trustee/nominee or 9 \n \nany other intermediary. If so, APs should  insist on receipt of satisfactory \ndocument of  identity of the intermediaries and of t he persons on whose behalf \nthey are acting, as also obtain details of the natur e of the trust or other \narrangements in place. While undertaking a transaction for a trust, APs should \ntake reasonable precautions to verify the identity of the trust ees and the settlers \nof trust (including any person settling assets  into the trust), grantors, protectors, \nbeneficiaries and signatories. In all cases beneficiaries shou ld be identified with \nreference to necessary documents. In the case of a 'foundation', steps should be \ntaken to verify the founder manager s/ directors and the beneficiaries. \n \nii) Transactions by companies and firms\n \nAPs need to be vigilant against business entities bein g used by individuals as a \n\u2018front\u2019 for undertaking transactions with APs. APs should examine the control \nstructure of the entity, determine the source of f unds and identify the natural \npersons who have a controlling interest and who comprise the management. \nThese requirements may be moderated according to the risk perception e.g. in the case of a company that is listed on a recognized stock exchange, it will not be \nnecessary to identify all the shareholders. \n \niii)  Transactions by Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) \n \nPolitically exposed persons are individual s who are or have been entrusted with \nprominent public functions in a foreign country, e.g., Heads of States or of Governments, senior politicians, senior  government/judicial/ military officers, \nsenior executives of state- owned corporations, important political party officials, \netc. APs should gather sufficient info rmation on any person/customer of this \ncategory intending to undertake  a transaction or establish a business relationship \nand check all the information available on  the person in the public domain. APs \nshould verify the identity of the person and seek information about the source of wealth and source of funds before accepting the PEP as a customer. The \ndecision to undertake a transaction with a PEP should be taken at a senior level \nwhich should be clearly spelt out in Customer Acceptance Policy. APs should \nalso subject such transactions to enhanced monitoring on an ongoing basis. The above norms may also be applied to transa ctions with the family members or 10 \n \nclose relatives of PEPs. The above norms may also be applied to customers who \nbecome PEPs subsequent to establishm ent of the business relationship. \nWhere a customer subsequent ly becomes a PEP after a business relationship \nhas already been established, enhanced  CDD should be performed on such \ncustomers and decision to continue busines s relationship with the PEP should be \ntaken at a sufficiently senior level.   \n4.6   Monitoring of Transactions\n \nOngoing monitoring is an essential elem ent of effective KYC procedures. APs \ncan effectively control and reduce their ri sk only if they have an understanding of \nthe normal and reasonable activi ty of the customer so t hat they have the means \nof identifying transactions that fall outside the regular pattern of activity. However, \nthe extent of monitoring wi ll depend on the risk sensitivity of the transaction. APs \nshould pay special attention to all comp lex, unusually large transactions and all \nunusual patterns which have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose. \nAPs may prescribe threshold limits for a particular category of transaction and \npay particular attention to the transacti ons which exceed these limits. High-risk \ntransactions have to be subjected to in tensified monitoring. Every AP should set \nkey indicators for such transactions, taking note of the background of the customer, such as the country of origin, s ources of funds, the type of transactions \ninvolved and other risk factors. APs shoul d put in place a system of periodical \nreview of risk categorization of cust omers and the need for applying enhanced \ndue diligence measures. Such  review of risk categoris ation of customers should \nbe carried out periodically. \n \n4.7   Attempted transactions \n \nWhere the AP is unable to apply appropriate KYC measures due to non-\nfurnishing of information and /or non-cooper ation by the customer, the AP should \nnot undertake the transaction.  Under these circumstances, APs should make a suspicious transactions repor t to FIU-IND in relation to  the customer, even if the \ntransaction is not put through. \n \n \n 11 \n \n4.8    Risk Management \n \na)  The Board of Directors of the AP should ensure that an effective KYC \nprogramme is put in place by establis hing appropriate pr ocedures and ensuring \neffective implementation. It should cove r proper management oversight, systems \nand controls, segregation of duties, training and other related matters. \nResponsibility should be explicitly alloca ted within the AP for ensuring that the \nAPs\u2019 policies and procedures are implem ented effectively. APs should, in \nconsultation with their boards, devise proc edures for creating ri sk profiles of their \nexisting and new customers and apply vari ous anti money laund ering measures \nkeeping in view the risks involved in a transaction or business relationship. \n \nb) APs\u2019 internal audit and co mpliance functions have an important role in \nevaluating and ensuring adherence to t he KYC policies and procedures. As a \ngeneral rule, the compliance function sh ould provide an independent evaluation \nof the AP\u2019s own policies and procedures, including le gal and regulatory \nrequirements. APs should ensure that their audit machinery is staffed adequately with individuals who are well-versed in such policies and procedures. The concurrent auditors should check all transac tions to verify that they have been \nundertaken in compliance with the anti-m oney laundering guidelines and have \nbeen reported whenever required to the c oncerned authorities. Compliance on \nthe lapses, if any, recorded by the concurrent auditors should be put up to the Board. A certificate from  the Statutory Auditors on the compliance with KYC / \nAML / CFT guidelines should be obtained at the time of preparat ion of the Annual \nReport and kept on record.  \n \n4.9 Introduction of New Technologies- Pre-paid Cards\n \nAPs should pay special attention to any money laundering threats that may arise \nfrom new or developing technologies, t hat might favour anonymity and take \nmeasures, to prevent their use for money  laundering purposes. Certain AD Cat-I \nbanks are engaged in issuance of Forei gn currency denominated pre-paid cards \nto travelers going abroad. While issuing these pre-paid cards, it should be \nensured that all the KYC / AML/ CFT Guideli nes are fully complied with. It is also \ndesirable that, certain APs, who are not e ligible to issue such cards but are 12 \n \ninvolved in marketing these cards on behalf of  the card issuing banks, as well as \ntheir customers, are also s ubjected to KYC measures.  \n \n4.10 Combating  Financ ing  of  Terrorism \n \na)   In  terms of  PML  Rules,  suspic ious  transaction  should  include, inter alia \ntransactions which give rise to a reas onable ground of susp icion that it may \ninvolve the proceeds of an offence m entioned in the Schedule to the PMLA, \nregardless of the value involved. APs should, therefore, develop suitable \nmechanism through appropriate policy fram ework for enhanced monitoring of \ntransactions suspected of having terrorist  links and swift identification of the \ntransactions and making suitable reports to the Financial Intelligence Unit \u2013 India \n(FIU-IND) on priority. \n \nb)  APs are advised to take into account  risks arising from the deficiencies in \nAML/CFT regime of certain jurisdicti ons viz. Iran, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, \nTurkmenistan, Sao Tome and Principe,  as identified in  FATF Statement \n(www.fatf-gafi.org ), issued from time to time, while dealing with individuals or \nbusinesses from these jurisdications. \n \n4.11   Applicability to branches and subsidiaries outside India\n \nThe guidelines contained in this Circular sh all apply to the branches and majority \nowned subsidiaries located abroad, espe cially, in countries which do not or \ninsufficiently apply the FATF Recommendations, to the extent local laws permit. \nWhen local applicable laws and regulatio ns prohibit implementation of these \nguidelines, the same should be brought to the notice of the Reserve Bank. In case there is a variance in KYC / AML / CFT standards prescribed by the \nReserve Bank and the host country regulators, branches/overseas subsidiaries of APs are required to adopt the more stringent regulatio n of the two. \n \n4.12   Principal Officer \n \na) APs should appoint a senior management officer to be designated as Principal \nOfficer. Principal Officer shall be located at the head/corporate office of the AP \nand shall be responsible for monitoring a nd reporting of all transactions and \nsharing of information as required under the law. The Principal Officer should 13 \n \nalso be responsible for developing appropriate compliance management \narrangements across the full range of AML/CFT areas (e.g. CDD, record \nkeeping, etc.). He will maintain close liaison with enforcement  agencies, APs and \nany other institution which are involved in the fight against money laundering and \ncombating financing of terrorism. With a view to enable the Principal Officer to \ndischarge his responsibilities,  it is advised that that  the Principal Officer and \nother appropriate staff should have timely access to customer identification data \nand other CDD information, transaction re cords and other relevant information. \nFurther, banks should ensure that the Principal Officer is able to act \nindependently and report directly to the se nior management or to the Board of \nDirectors.  \n \nb) The Principal Officer will be responsible  for timely submission of CTR and STR \nto the FIU-IND. \n \n4.13 Maintenance of records of transactions/Information to be \npreserved/Maintenance and preservation of  records/Cash and Suspicious  \nTransactions Reporting to Financial Intelligence Uni t- India (FIU-IND)   \n \nSection 12 of the Prevention of  Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 , as \namended by Prevention of Money La undering (Amendment) Act, 2009, casts \ncertain obligations on the APs in regard to preservation and reporting of \ntransaction information. APs are, therefor e, advised to go through the provisions \nof Prevention of Money Laundering Ac t, (PMLA), 2002, as amended by \nPrevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2009 and the Rules notified \nthere under and take all steps consider ed necessary to ensure compliance with \nthe requirements of Sect ion 12 of the Act ibid .  \n \n(i) Maintenance of records of transactions \n \nAPs should introduce a system of mainta ining proper record of transactions \nprescribed under Rule 3,  as mentioned below: \n \na) all cash transactions of the value of more than Rupees Ten Lakh or its \nequivalent in foreign currency; \n 14 \n \nb) all series of cash transactions int egrally connected to each other which have \nbeen valued below Rupees Ten Lakh or its equivalent in  foreign currency where \nsuch series of transactions have taken place within a month; and  \n \nc) all suspicious transactions whether or  not made in cash and by way of as \nmentioned in the Rules.  \n \n(ii) Information to be preserved\n \nAPs are required to maintain the following  information in respect of transactions \nreferred to in Rule 3: \n \na) the nature of the transactions; \nb) the amount of the transaction and th e currency in which it was  \ndenominated;  \nc) the date on which the transaction was conducted; and \nd) the parties to the transaction \n(iii) Maintenance and Preservation of Record \n \na) APs are required to maintain the reco rds containing information in respect of \ntransactions referred to in Rule 3 above.  APs should take appropriate steps to \nevolve a system for proper  maintenance and preserva tion of transaction \ninformation in a manner that allows data to be retrieved easily and quickly \nwhenever required or when r equested by the competent authorities. Further, APs \nshould maintain for at least ten years from the date of tr ansaction between the \nAP and the client, all necessary record s of transactions, both with residents and \nnon-residents, which will permit recons truction of individual transactions \n(including the amounts and types of currency in volved, if any) so as to provide, if \nnecessary, evidence for prosecution of per sons involved in criminal activity. \n \nb) APs should ensure that record s pertaining to the identi fication of the customer \nand his address (e.g. copies of docum ents like passport, driving license, PAN \ncard, voter identity card issued by t he Election Commission, utility bills, etc.) \nobtained while undertaking the transacti on and during the course of business \nrelationship, are properly preserved for at least ten years  from the date of 15 \n \ncessation of the transaction / business rela tionship. The identification records and \ntransaction data should be made available to the competent authorities upon \nrequest. \n \nc)  In paragraph 4.6 of this Circular, APs  have been advised to pay special \nattention to all complex, unusual large transactions and all unusual patterns of \ntransactions, which have no apparent econom ic or visible lawful purpose. It is \nfurther clarified that the background incl uding all documents/office records / \nmemoranda pertaining to such transactions and purpose thereof should, as far as \npossible, be examined and th e findings at branch as we ll as Principal Officer\u2019s \nlevel should be properly recorded. Such  records and related documents should \nbe made available to help auditor s in their day-to-day work relating to scrutiny of \ntransactions and also to Reserve Bank/ot her relevant authorities. These records \nare required to be preserved for ten years  as is required under PMLA, 2002  \nPrevention of Money Laundering Act, (PML A), 2002, as amended by Prevention \nof Money Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2009 and Prevention of Money-\nLaundering (Maintenance of Records of the Nature and Value of Transactions, \nthe Procedure and Manner of Maintaining and Time for Furnishing Information \nand Verification and Maintenance of Records of the Identity of the Clients of the \nBanking Companies, Financial Institutions  and Intermediaries) Rules, 2005 as \namended from time to time. \n \n(iv)   Reporting to Financ ial Intelligence Unit \u2013 India \n \na)  In terms of the PML rules, APs are required to report information relating to \ncash and suspicious transactions to the Dir ector, Financial Intelligence Unit-India \n(FIU-IND) in respect of transactions referr ed to in Rule 3 at the following address: \n \nThe Director, \nFinancial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) \n6th Floor, Hotel Samrat, \nChanakyapuri, New Delhi-110021 . \nWebsite - http://fiuindia.gov.in/\n \nb)  APs should carefully go through all the reporting formats. There are altogether \nfour reporting formats, as detailed in (F-Par t-III) annexed to this circular, viz. i) \nCash Transactions Report (CTR); ii) Electr onic File Structure-CTR; iii) Suspicious 16 \n \nTransactions Report (STR); iv) Electroni c File Structure-STR. The reporting \nformats contain detailed guidelines on the compilation and manner/procedure of \nsubmission of the reports to  FIU-IND. It would be nece ssary for APs to initiate \nurgent steps to ensure electronic filing of  all types of reports  to FIU-IND. The \nrelated hardware and technical requirement  for preparing reports in an electronic \nformat, the related data files and data st ructures thereof are furnished in the \ninstructions part of the formats concerned. \n \nc)  In terms of instructions contained in par agraph 4.3(b) of this Circular, APs are \nrequired to prepare a profile for each cu stomer based on risk categorisation. \nFurther, vide paragraph 4.6, the need for peri odical review of risk categorisation \nhas been emphasized. It is, therefore, reiter ated that APs, as a part of transaction \nmonitoring mechanism, are required to put in place an appropriate software \napplication to throw alerts when the transactions are inconsistent with risk categorization and updated prof ile of customers. It is  needless to add that a \nrobust software throwing alerts is essential for effective identification and reporting of suspicious transactions. \n \n4.14   Cash and Suspicious Transaction Reports \n \nA) Cash Transaction Report ( CTR ) \n \nWhile detailed instructions for filing a ll types of reports are given in the \ninstructions part of the related formats , APs should scrupulously adhere to the \nfollowing: \n \ni)  The Cash Transaction Report (CTR) fo r each month should be submitted to \nthe FIU-IND by 15th of the succeeding m onth. Cash transaction reporting by \nbranches to their controlling offices should,  therefore, invariably be submitted on \na monthly basis and APs shoul d ensure to submit CTR for every month to FIU-\nIND within the prescribed time schedule. \nii) While filing CTR, details of individual  transactions below Rs.50,000 need not \nbe furnished. \niii) CTR should contain only the transactions  carried out by the AP on behalf of \ntheir customers excluding transactions bet ween the internal accounts of the AP.   \n 17 \n \niv)  A cash transaction report for the AP as a whole should be compiled by the \nPrincipal Officer of the AP  every month in physical form as per the format \nspecified. The report should be signed by  the Principal Officer and submitted to \nthe FIU-India. \n \nv) In case of Cash Transaction Reports (CTR) compiled centrally by APs for the \nbranches at their central data centre level, APs may generate centralised Cash \nTransaction Reports (CTR) in respect of branches under central computerized \nenvironment at one point for onward tr ansmission to FIU-IND, provided:  \n \na) The CTR is generated in the format pre scribed by Reserve Bank in Para \n4.13(iv)(b) of this Circular. \n \nb)  A copy of the monthly CTR submi tted on its behalf to the FIU-India is \navailable at the concerned branch for production to auditors/inspectors, when \nasked for. \n \nc) The instruction on \u2018Maintenance of reco rds of transactions\u2019; \u2018Information to be \npreserved\u2019 and  \u2018Maintenance and Preservation of records\u2019 as contained above in \nthis Circular at Para 4.13 (i), (ii) and ( iii) respectively are scrupulously followed by \nthe branch. \n \nHowever, in respect of branches not un der central computer ized environment, \nthe monthly CTR should continue to be compiled and forwarded by the branch to \nthe Principal Officer for onward transmission to the FIU-IND. \n \nB) Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) \n \ni) While determining suspicious transactions, APs should be guided by definition \nof suspicious transaction contained in PM L Rules, as amended from time to time. \nii) It is likely that in some case s transactions are abandoned/aborted by \ncustomers on being asked to give some det ails or to provide documents. It is \nclarified that APs should report all such attempted transactions in STRs, even if \nnot completed by customers, irrespecti ve of the amount of  the transaction. \niii) APs should make STRs if they have reasonable ground to believe that the \ntransaction, including an attempted trans action, involves proceeds of crime 18 \n \nirrespective of the amount of transaction and/or the th reshold limit envisaged for \npredicate offences in part B of Schedule of Prevention of M oney Laundering Act, \n(PMLA), 2002, as amended by Prevention of Money Launder ing (Amendment) \nAct, 2009 . \niv) The Suspicious Transaction Report (S TR) should be furnished within 7 days \nof arriving at a conclusion that any transaction, including an attempted \ntransaction, whether cash or non-cash, or a series of transactions integrally \nconnected are of suspicious nature. The Principal Officer should record his reasons for treating any transaction or a se ries of transactions as suspicious. It \nshould be ensured that there is no undue delay in arrivi ng at such a conclusion \nonce a suspicious transaction report is re ceived from a branch or any other office. \nSuch report should be made available to  the competent aut horities on request. \n \nv) In the context of creating KYC/ AML awareness among the staff and for \ngenerating alerts for suspicious transac tions, APs may consider the following \nindicative list of suspicious activities. \n \nSome possible suspicious activity  indicators are given below: \n\u2022 Customer is reluctant to provide det ails / documents on frivolous grounds.  \n\u2022 The transaction is undertaken by one or more intermediaries to protect the \nidentity of the beneficiary or  hide their involvement.  \n\u2022 Size and frequency of transactions is high considering the normal \nbusiness of the customer.  \n\u2022 Change in the pattern of transactions.  \n \nThe above list is only indicative and not exhaustive.  \nvi) APs should not put any restrictions on  transactions where an STR has been \nmade. Moreover, it should be ensured that employees of APs shall keep the fact of furnishing such information as st rictly confidentia l and there is no  tipping off \nto the customer at any level.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 19 \n \n4.15   Customer Education/Employ ees\u2019 Training/Employees\u2019 Hiring  \n \na) Customer Education  \n \nImplementation of KYC proc edures requires APs to demand certain information \nfrom customers which may be of personal nat ure or which has hitherto never \nbeen called for. This can sometimes lead to a lot of questioning by the customer \nas to the motive and purpose of collecting such information. There is, therefore, a \nneed for APs to prepare specific literature / pamphlets, etc. so as to educate the \ncustomer of the objectives of the KYC programme. The front desk staff needs to be specially trained to handle such situat ions while dealing with customers. \n \nb) Employees\u2019 Training  \n \nAPs must have an ongoing employee training programme so that the members of \nthe staff are adequately trained to be aware of the policies and procedures relating to prevention of m oney laundering, provisions of the PMLA and the need \nto monitor all transactions to ensure t hat no suspicious activity is being \nundertaken under the guise of money changing. Training requirements should have different focuses for frontline staff,  compliance staff and staff dealing with \nnew customers. It is crucial that all those concerned fully under stand the rationale \nbehind the KYC policies and implement them consistently. The steps to be taken when the staff come across any suspic ious transactions (such as asking \nquestions about the source of funds, ch ecking the identification documents \ncarefully, reporting immediately to the Prin cipal Officer, etc.) should be carefully \nformulated by the AP and su itable procedure laid down. The APs should have an \nongoing training programme for consistent  implementation of the AML measures. \n \nc) Hiring of Employees \n \nIt may be appreciated that KYC norms/A ML standards/CFT measures have been \nprescribed to ensure that cr iminals are not allowed to misuse the system of APs. \nIt would, therefore, be necessary t hat adequate screening mechanism is put in \nplace by APs as an integral part of thei r recruitment/hiring process of personnel \nto ensure high standards.  20 \n \n(F-Part-II)  \n \n[Annex to A.P.

Accordingly, following di rections are being issued under Section 18 \nof the Payment and Settlement Syst ems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).  \n \n \nYours faithfully \n \n \n \n(G.Padmanabhan) \nChief General Manager \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Directions for opening and operation of A ccounts and settlement of payments for \nelectronic payment transactions  involving intermediaries \n \n1. Introduction \n \n1.1 The use of Electronic/Online Payment modes for payments to merchants for goods \nand services like bill payments, online sho pping etc. has been gaini ng popularity in the \ncountry. The increased facilitation by bank s and prepaid payment in strument issuers of \nthe use of electronic modes by  customers for payments to me rchants generally involves \nthe use of intermediaries like aggregators and payment gat eway service providers. \nFurther, Electronic Commerce and Mobile Commerce (e-commerce and m-commerce) \nservice providers have also been acting as intermediaries by providing platforms for \nfacilitating such payments. \n \n1.2 In most existing arrangements involving such intermediaries, the payments  made \nby customers (for settlement of e-comme rce/m-commerce/bill payment transactions), \nare credited to the accounts of these intermediaries, before the f unds are transferred to \nthe accounts of the merchants in final se ttlement of the obligat ions of the paying \ncustomers. Any delay in the transfer of the funds by the intermediar ies to the merchants \naccount will not only entail risks to the cust omers and the merchants but also impact the \npayment system.  \n \n1.3 With a view to safeguard the interests of the customers and to ensure that the \npayments made by them are duly accounted fo r by the intermediaries receiving such \npayments and remitted to the accounts of t he merchants who have supplied the goods \nand services without undue delay, it  is considered necessary to    frame these directions \nfor the safe and orderly conduct of these trans actions. Accordingly, following directions \nare being issued under Secti on 18 of the Payment and Se ttlement Systems Act, 2007 \n(Act 51 of 2007).  \n \n \n2. Definitions \n \n2.1 Intermediaries:  Intermediaries would include all entities that collect monies \nreceived from customers for payment to me rchants using any electronic/online payment \nmode, for goods and services availed by them and subsequently facilitate the transfer of \nthese monies to the merchants in final se ttlement of the obligat ions of the paying \ncustomers. \n \nExplanation: For the purpose of these dire ctions, all intermediaries who facilitate \ndelivery of goods/services immediately/simult aneously (e.g. Travel tickets/movie tickets \netc) on the completion of payment by the cu stomer shall not fall wit hin the definition of \nthe expression \u201cintermediaries\u201d.  These transac tions which are akin to a Delivery versus \nPayment (DvP) arrangement will continue to be facilitated as per the contracts between the merchants and the intermediaries as hit herto and banks shall satisfy themselves that such intermediaries do not fall within the definition of the \u201cinte rmediaries\u201d when they \nopen accounts other than internal accounts.  \n \n2.2 Merchants : For the purpose of these directions, merchants shall include all \nElectronic commerce/Mobile commerce servic e providers and other persons (including \nbut not limited to utility service providers)  who accept payments for goods and service \nprovided by them, through Electr onic/Online Payment modes.  \n \n3. Maintaining of accounts for collection of payments \n \n3.1 All accounts opened and ma intained by banks for facilita ting collection of payments \nby intermediaries from custom ers of merchants, shall be tr eated as internal accounts of \nthe banks. While it is left to the banks to decide on the exact nomenclature of such \naccounts it shall be ensured that such a ccounts are not maintained or operated by the \nintermediaries.  \n \n3.2 Banks shall ensure that the process of converting all the existing accounts \nmaintained and operated by intermediaries for the purpose covered in  these directions \nshall be completed within three months  of issuance of these directions. \n \n3.3 For the sake of further clarity, the permi tted credits/debits in these accounts are set \nout below: \n \ni. Credits \n \na) Payments from various persons towards purchase of goods/services. \nb) Transfers from other banks as per  pre-determined agreement into the \naccount, if this account is the nodal bank account for the intermediary.  \nc) Transfers representing refunds for failed/disputed transactions. \n \nii. Debits \n \na) Payments to various merchants/service providers. \nb) Transfers to other banks as per pre- determined agreement into the account, if \nthat account is the nodal bank account for the intermediary. \nc) Transfers representing refunds for failed/disputed transactions. \nd) Commissions to the intermediarie s. These amounts shall be at pre-\ndetermined rates/frequency.  \n \nNote : No payment other than the co mmissions at the pre-determined \nrates/frequency shall be payable to the inte rmediaries. Such transfers shall only \nbe effected to a bank account intimated to the bank by the intermediary during \nthe agreement.  \n 3.4 Pending conversion of the existing ac counts to internal accounts, banks shall \nensure that only transactions as stated at paragraph 3.3 are permitted in these \naccounts. This process shall be implemente d with immediate effect.  \n \n4. Settlement  \n  \n4.1 The final settlements of funds to the merchants are presently guided by business \npractices followed by the intermediaries/merchants. In order to increase the efficiency of \nthe payment process, it is necessary th at banks transfer funds to the ultimate \nbeneficiaries with minimum time delay. It is therefore mandat ed that banks shall \nimplement the following settlement cycle for a ll final settlements to merchants. This \nsettlement arrangement shall be implemented within three months of issuance of this \ncircular:- \n \ni. All payments to merchants which do not  involve transfer of funds to nodal banks \nshall be effected within a maximum of T+ 2 settlement cycle (where T is defined \nas the day of intimation regarding  the completion of transaction). \n \nii. All payments to merchants involving nodal banks shall be effected within a \nmaximum of T+3 settlement cycle. \n \n5. Treatment of balances by banks \n \n5.1 As the funds held in the accounts as indicated in paragraph 3.1 would be in the \nnature of outside liability of the bank, the balances in t hese accounts shall be reckoned \nas such for the purpose of computation of Net Demand and Time Liabilities of the bank. \n \n6. Concurrent Audit \n \n6.1 Banks shall subject these accounts to conc urrent audit and a certificate to the effect \nthat these accounts are operated in accordance with these directions shall be submitted \nto Department of Payment and Settlement S ystem, Reserve Bank of India, on a \nquarterly basis.   \n \n7. Instruction applicable to other payment system operators \n \n7.1 All persons authorized to operate payment system for issuance of prepaid payment \ninstruments and card schemes shall facilit ate compliance with these directions.  \n \n \n******************** ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/DOIPS241109.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 23, 2009", "info": " \n\u017e\u00b8\u00b8\u00a3\u00f7\u00b8\u00fa\u00a1\u00b8 \u00b9\u00a3 \u008f\u00b8\u00f6\u00a8\u00b8\u00c4 \u009d\u00b8\u00bf\u00bf\u00be\u02c6\u00c5 \nRESERVE BANK OF INDIA \nwww.rbi.org.in \n \n \n\u00ac\u00b8\u00bb\u008d\u00b8\u203a\u00b8\u00b8 \u0153\u00cf\u00b8\u00be\u00d4\u00b8\u00b8\u00bd\u00b9\u0160\u00b8\u02c6\u00c5\u00fa \u00b9\u00a8\u00b8\u017e\u00b8\u00b8\u0160\u00b8, \u02c6\u00bf\u00bd\u00c5\u203a\u00cd\u00fa\u00a1\u00b8 \u02c6\u00c5\u00b8\u00a1\u00b8\u00b8\u00c4\u00a5\u00b8\u00a1\u00b8, 14\u00a8\u00b8\u00fa \u0178\u00b8\u00bf\u00b9 \u008f\u00b8\u00a5\u00b8, \u02c6\u00bd\u00bf\u00c5\u00cd\u00fa\u00a1\u00b8 \u02c6\u00c5\u00b8\u00a1\u00b8\u00b8\u00c4\u00a5\u00b8\u00a1\u00b8 \u017e\u00b8\u00a8\u00b8\u203a\u00b8,\u00a9\u00b8 \u2212\u00fa\u2122 \u017e\u00b8\u0160\u00b8\u00f7\u00b8 \u00eb\u00ac\u00b8 \u2212 \u0178\u00b8\u00b8\u0160\u00b8\u00c4, \u00fb\u00c5\u00b8\u00bd\u2019\u00c4, \u0178\u00b8\u00ba\u0178 \u009d\u00b8\u0192\u00c4 - 400 001 \n\u0153\u00b8\u20ac\u00b8\u00bd\u203a\u00b8 : (91-22) 2264 4995  \u0153\u00b8\u00be\u20ac\u00c6\u00ac\u00b8 : (91-22) 22691557   \u0192\u00c4-\u0178\u00b8\u00bd\u00a5\u00b8 :  cgmincditco@rbi.org.in  \nDepartment of Information Te chnology, Central Office, 14th Floor, Central Office Build ing, Shahid Bhagat Singh \nRoad, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 \nTel : (91-22) 2264 4995, Fax.: (91-22)  2269 1557   e-mail : cgmincditco@rbi.org.in  \n\u00b9\u2212\u203a\u2122\u00fa \u201a\u00b8\u00ac\u00b8\u00b8\u203a\u00b8 \u2212\u00be, \u0192\u00ac\u00b8\u02c6\u00c5\u00b8 \u0153\u00cf\u00a1\u00b8\u00b8\u00bd\u0160\u00b8 \u009d\u00b8\u0081\u00f5\u00b8\u0192\u2021 \n RBI/2009-10/230 \nDIT (CO) Circular No. 5 /09.63.08/2009-10      November 23, 2009 \n \n \nTo All RTGS Members \n  \nDear Sir, \n \nUp-gradation of RTGS System to Windows 2008  \n \nAs you are aware that RTGS system is presently running on Windows 2000 advanced \nserver with Oracle version 9i and IBM Websphere MQ series 5.3.  \n2.

It is observed that of late, \ncertain banks have been accepting receipts to Government accounts through RTGS. \nHowever, banks are not following a uniform practice while facilitating such transactions. On the basis of discussions with various major RTGS participant banks, it has been decided as \nunder: \nAs per the extant Government rules, only accredited banks are permitted to receive \npayments to Government and every credit to the Government account needs to be supported by a Challan. The RTGS message transfer platform is designed to carry only \nfunds transfer messages and not challan. The receiving bank therefore is not in a position to \nafford credit to the Government account in the absence of the challan accompanying the message in RTGS. This often results in transactions getting returned. \nIn order to facilitate Government receipts through RTGS it has been decided that participants originating Government transactions in RTGS can do so only when the receiving bank is in agreement with the sending bank to receive funds.
