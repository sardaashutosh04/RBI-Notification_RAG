Series) Circular No .7 dated March 6, 1998 permitting the nominated agencies / \nbanks to import gold on loan basis for a maximum period of 180 days. With a view to mobilising and recycling the \ngold stocks available in the country, the banks were also recently advised to formulate the Gold Deposit Scheme \nwhich entailed acceptance of physical deposits of gold. \n2.        We have been receiving requests form banks to pe rmit them to extend gold loans to jewellery industry. It has \nbeen decided to permit nomin ated agencies to grant gold (metal) loans as per Export Import Policy 1997-2002 and \nthe Hand Book of Procedures of the Exim Policy subject to the following conditions: \n(i)    The banks should ensure strict compliance with the terms and conditions contained in Chapter 8 of both the \nExport Import Policy - and Hand Book of Procedures. The policy requires that the ex porter who has obtained the \ngold, has to complete the exports within a maximum peri od of 120 days from the date of release of gold on loan \nbasis. The period of such loan shall therefore not exceed 120 days. The nominated banks will have to obtain necessary proof of exports from the expo rter as stipulated in the policy and fu rnish them to the Revenue authorities. \nIn the event of default on the part of the exporter to complete the exports within the stipulated period, the nominated \nagencies will have to bear the duty amount and the rela tive local taxes. Therefore, nominated banks may obtain \nsufficient additional security so as to meet the duty / tax requirements in the event of default. The guidelines issued \nby the Revenue authorities including those regarding b onded vault, maintenance of records, obtaining one time \nregistration certificate of the exporters, reporting cases of failure on the part of exporter and deposit of the duty amount in case of default should be meticulously observed. \n(ii)    The loans should be given only to jewellery exporters. Interest charged to the borrowers should be linked to the international gold  interest rate. \n(iii)    The gold borrowings in terms of ECD circular dat ed March 6, 1998 referred to above and gold deposits will be \nsubject to normal reserve requirements.  Valuation of the gold for the purpose of maintaining reserves will be based \non the London morining fix rate on reporting Friday crossed with closing dollar rupee spot rate on the reporting \nFriday. The same rate may be applied for translating gold loans to rupees for capital adequacy and balance sheet \npurposes. \n(iv)    The loan to the jewellery exporters in Indi a will be subject to capital adequacy and other prudential \nrequirements. \n(v)    Any mismatch arising out of the gold borrowings and lendings should be within the prudential risk limits \napproved by the bank's Board. \n3.   The gold borrowed from abroad / mobilised in the dom estic market and lent to jewellery exporters may be \nreported in the statement being submitt ed to DBOD by the nominated banks. \n4.   The banks should recognise the overall risks in granting gold loans and lay down an appropriate risk \nmanagement and lending policy. The policy should among others lay down a limit on the quant ity of gold that may be \nsupplied per exporter as also the total quantity of such  loans that may be outstanding at any point of time. \n Yours faithfully, \nSd/- \nDevaki Muthukrishnan  \nGeneral Manager ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/CDBGL201112.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Dec 24, 1998", "info": "1Summary of Recommendations\nof the\nTask Force on NBFCs\n1. Diversification of financial markets is an important component of financial sector\nreforms. In this environment, NBFCs have flourished and have become prominent in a\nwide range of activities like hire purchase finance, housing finance, equipment leasing\nfinance, loans and investments.\n2. It is recognised that the existing legislative and regulatory framework requires further\nrefinement and improvement because of the rising number of defaulting NBFCs and the\nneed for an efficient and quick system for redressal of grievances of individual depositors.\nThe procedure for taking over the assets and liquidation of defaulting and insolvent\nNBFCs remains deficient and is neither able to effectively prevent assets stripping nor\ndoes it enable quick disposal of assets for the benefit of all creditors whether secured or\nunsecured. There is also the perception that the regulatory regime in some respects is over\nrestrictive and has constrained the growth of well performing healthy NBFCs.\n3. The three year period for attaining minimum NOF of Rs.25 lakh would expire in\nJanuary, 2000.  Any extension granted by the RBI should be made conditional upon the\nconcerned NBFC having taken adequate steps to increase NOF in the initial three year\nperiod and satisfactory arrangements to attain the minimum capital requirement as may be\napplicable at that point of time within the extended period. Further, the present minimum\ncapital requirement of Rs.25 lakhs itself may have to be reviewed upward keeping in view\nthe need to impart greater financial soundness and achieve economies of scale in terms of\nefficiency of operations and higher managerial skills.\n4. It would be necessary for the RBI to draw up a time bound programme for disposal of\napplications for registration as an NBFC.  Given the fact that the operations of NBFCs are\noften concentrated in far flung areas, the RBI may apprise the State Governments of the\ncompanies which have been granted registration as well as the companies whose\napplications have been rejected.\n5. Given  the relatively higher risk involved in NBFCs' operations, a higher level of CRAR\n(Capital to Risk Assets Ratio) compared to banks is essential.  While the present\nstipulation of 12% of CRAR for all rated NBFCs may continue, the RBI may prescribe a\nhigher CRAR of say 15% for those NBFCs which seek public deposit without credit\nrating.\n6. It is also necessary that the prudential norms be reviewed by the RBI, taking into\naccount the international norms, and the norms applicable to the commercial banks in India\nas also the general economic climate in the country.  The RBI should prescribe ceilings for\nexposure to the real estate sector and also investment in capital markets specially unquoted\nshares.  The norms for exposures to connected companies need to be tightened.  These2measures are essential to prevent deployment of public deposits in high risk and\nspeculative avenues.  The RBI may stipulate that the NBFCs should invest at least 25% of\ntheir reserves in marketable securities apart from the SLR securities already held by the\nNBFCs.\n7. The need for regulations on the deposit taking activities of NBFCs has basically arisen\nbecause of the information asymmetry that exists between an uninformed depositor and the\nNBFC.  Further, deposits raised from the public are more likely to be of short term\nduration, resulting in maturity mismatches between asset and liability and the attendant\nrisks.  Linking of the quantum of public deposits with credit rating, however, presents a\ndifferent set of issues.  Apart from having the effect of conferring regulatory functions on\nthe rating agencies, it also exposes the NBFCs to frequent asset liability mismatches\narising out of changes in credit rating.  In view of the additional level of comfort provided\nby a credit rating, it is appropriate for the RBI to stipulate a higher ceiling for public\ndeposit for those companies which have obtained rating for their instruments.  However,\nfor reasons mentioned above, it may not be necessary to link the quantum of deposit to the\nrating per-se provided the rating is above the minimum investment grade.  In summary, the\nproposed ceiling could be as under :\nType of Company Limit of public Deposits\nNBFC with NOF less than\nRs.25 lakhsNo access to public deposits\nEquipment Leasing/Hire\nPurchase (EL/HP) company\nwithout credit rating1.5 times NOF or Rs.10 crore\nwhichever is lower. ( higher\nCRAR of 15%).\nEL/HP company with\ninvestment grade credit\nrating or above4 times NOF\nLoan/Investment companies\nwith investment grade\ncredit rating or above.1.5 times NOF (higher CRAR of 15%)\n8. The RBI should consider measures for easing the flow of credit from banks to NBFCs\nand then consider prescribing a suitable ratio as between secured and unsecured deposits\nfor NBFCs.\n9. The liquid asset ratio should be increased to 25% of public deposit from the present\nlevel in a phased manner.  By a suitable statutory provision, the unsecured depositors may\nbe given a first charge on these liquid assets so that an unsecured  depositor  is  at least\nassured  of  a  return of one-out-of-every-four rupees deposited by him.\n10. The RBI can be statutorily empowered to appoint depositors' grievance redressal\nauthorities with specified territorial jurisdiction.  The office of the Banking Ombudsman,\ncould be a viable option for such appointments.  This will also entail amendments in the\nRBI Act.311. If  the depositor's grievance is a one off problem, a fraction of the deposit equivalent to\nratio of the liquid assets to the total public deposits may be paid to the depositor directly\nunder the orders of this authority.  As regards the balance payment, this authority may pass\na suitable order.\n12. To provide legal strength to the order of such authority, the order could be transmitted\nby this authority to the principal civil court of the District in which the registered office of\nthe company is situated or to such competent principal civil court as desired by the\ndepositor and such an order would be enforceable as a decree of such principal court.\n13. Till such time as the amendments for setting up depositors' grievances redressal\nauthorities are carried out, it is essential that the Company Law Board (CLB) tightens its\nprocedures for dealing with complaints of depositors and puts in place a mechanism for\nspeedy disposal of these complaints.  The regional offices of the RBI and the regional\noffices of the CLB should set up a coordination mechanism to ensure that defaulting\ncompanies are speedily dealt with for violation of any regulatory/statutory requirements.\n14 State Governments may set up cells at the state and district level to help disseminate\ninformation relating to procedure for redressal of depositors' grievances.\n15. The procedure for the liquidation of NBFCs should be substantially on line with those\navailable for banks, so that these proceedings can quickly be brought to completion and the\nclaims of various depositors and other creditors are settled as early as possible.\n16. There is an imperative need for reviewing the particulars given in advertisements.\nDues from the group companies, the business ventures in which the directors are interested\nand the amount of exposure including the non-fund based facilities provided to such\nentities should also be included in the advertisement.\n17. There is a need for the RBI to continue to take more intensive measures for a sustained\ndepositors' awareness campaign. These publicity campaigns should be through print and\nelectronic media ,  seminars, conferences, etc.  Associations of NBFCs and various\ninvestors' fora such as Consumers' Education Research Centre, Investors' Grievances\nForum, Depositors' Associations, etc. should also be actively involved in these campaigns.\n18. It would not be judicious to introduce a deposit insurance scheme for the depositors in\nNBFCs because of the moral hazard issues, likelihood of asset stripping and the likely\nnegative impact on the growth of a healthy NBFC Sector.\n19. A separate instrumentality for regulation and supervision of NBFCs under the aegis of\nthe RBI should be set up.  It should have representation of experts and other professionals\nand should help the overall supervisory policies of the RBI.  Rules and regulations for the\nnew instrumentality should provide enough flexibility for induction of specialists and\nexperts with requisite supervisory skills.  The RBI should have a separate Executive\nDirector for this purpose, supervised by a Deputy Governor, so that there is greater focus\nin regulation and supervision of the NBFC sector.420. RBI could use the services of chartered accountants with suitable experience and\ncapabilities to carry out inspections of the smaller NBFCs.\n21. The offsite surveillance mechanism should pick up any significant spurt in NPAs and\nany bunching of repayment of deposits.\n22. It is important to have a very sensitive market intelligence system which could trigger\nonsite inspections followed by appropriate regulatory responses.\n23. The RBI should be vested with powers to direct a particular NBFC or a class of\nNBFCs to seek prior approval of the RBI before appointing its statutory auditors.\n24. Wherever the RBI has reasons to believe that the management of an NBFC is likely to\nindulge in fraudulent activities to the detriment of the company or its depositors ,  the RBI\nmay notify such company and on notification, the assets of the company shall stand\nattached and the management of the assets be vested with a custodian to be appointed by\nthe RBI.  The assets may then be disposed off under the orders of a special court or of a\nHigh Court to be notified as a special court for this purpose.  Suitable amendments may be\nmade in the RBI Act to put in place such an arrangement.\n25. The amendment to the RBI Act in 1997 is a step in the right direction and allowing\naccess to deposits from individuals to such entities exposes the depositors to grave risks.\nHowever, there is a case for allowing them to have access to loans other than public\ndeposits.  They could be permitted to access loans from bodies with a corporate identity,\nincluding NBFCs.\n26. Deposit taking by unregistered NBFCs or NBFCs whose applications for certificate of\nregistration have been rejected or whose registration has been cancelled or who have been\nprohibited from accepting deposits should be made a cognizable offence.  State\nGovernments should set up special investigation wings for enforcing these provisions.\n27. The offence of unauthorised deposit taking by unincorporated financial intermediaries\nshould be made cognizable.  State Governments should also expeditiously consider\nenacting legislation on the lines of the legislation enacted by Tamilnadu Legislature on this\nissue.\n28. There should be a ban on issue of advertisements soliciting deposits by all\nunincorporated bodies.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/4609.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Dec 24, 1998", "info": "RESERVE BANK OF INDIA\nDepartment of  Non- Banking Supervision,\nCentral Office, Centre 1, Cuffe Parade, Colaba, Mumbai, 400005Fax: 022 2150540\nTelephone 2188122\nTelex 011 86135\nRBI  IN\nTelegram :\nPARYAVEKSHAN\nRef DNBS. No. CC. 07/02.01/98-99\nDecember 18, 1998\nTo all Non-Banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs)\n and Residuary Non-Banking Companies ( RNBCs)\nDear Sir,\nNon-Banking Financial Companies \u2013\nAmendments to Directions\n-----------------------------------------------\nPlease refer to ( i)  Non-Banking Financial Companies Acceptance of Public Deposits\n(Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998 contained in Notification No.DFC.118/ DG (SPT)-98\ndated January 31, 1998, (NBFC Directions on Acceptance of Public Deposits) (ii) Non-\nBanking Financial Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998\ncontained in Notification No.DFC.119/ DG (SPT)/98 dated January 31, 1998, (NBFC\nDirections on Prudential Norms) (iii) Non-Banking  Financial Companies Auditor\u2019s\nReport (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998 contained in Notification No.DFC.\n117/DG(SPT)-98 dated January 2, 1998 RBI (Directions to Auditors) and,  (IV) Reserve\nBank of India (Non-Banking Financial Companies) Returns Specifications 1997\ncontained in Notification No. DFC(COC) No.108/ED(JRP)-97 dated April 30, 1997 (RBI\nDirections on Return for Liquid Assets).\n2. In terms of NBFC Directions on Acceptance of Public Deposits it was mandatory\nfor an NBFC to obtain minimum investment grade credit rating for fixed deposits for\nacceptance of public deposits and the quantum of public deposit was linked to the level of\ncredit rating from an approved agency for this purpose, with an objective to enable the\ndepositor to make  an informed decision. Credit rating based on the principle of\nNeutrality of Assessment and  reflecting the financial and operational strength of the\nrated company was considered as an appropriate tool for indirect supervision and\nmonitoring the NBFCs. It was felt that confidence of the depositors could be sustained\nonly by continued good performance and compliance with prudential norms by an NBFC\nas reflected in the credit rating enjoyed by it. The NBFCs were encouraged to broad-base\ntheir resources by resorting to borrowings from banks and financial institutions, inter-\ncorporate deposits/loans, secured debentures/bonds etc. which were exempted from the\ndefinition of \u201cpublic deposit\u2019.\n3. NBFCs, their Associations and the apex trade bodies had, however, in their\nrepresentations to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Government of India brought2\nto focus  that frequent downgrading of the credit ratings and consequent requirement\nof downward adjustment of quantum of public deposits caused asset liability mismatches\nfor the NBFCs. It was also suggested that smaller NBFCs could be exempted from the\nrequirement of credit rating for having public deposits up to a particular limit, and that\nlarger NBFCs be allowed higher limits of public deposits subject to their obtaining\nminimum investment grade credit rating and complying with the higher capital adequacy\nrequirements.\n4. Government of India appointed a Task Force on NBFCs under the Chairmanship\nof Shri C.M. Vasudev, Special Secretary (Banking) where RBI was also represented.\nThe Task Force, in its report dated October 28, 1988, has recommended rationalisation of\nregulations for NBFCs, improvement of  the legislative framework for protecting the\ninterests of depositors and development of  NBFCs sector on sound and healthy lines. A\nsummary of recommendations is enclosed for your information. The recommendations of\nthe Task Force have been broadly accepted by the Government and RBI.\n5. The regulatory framework has been modified in tune with the recommendations\nof the Task Force, with immediate effect. The significant changes are discussed below.\nA.Amendments to  Directions\n1.Entitlement of public deposit and\nRequirement of credit rating\n(A) NBFCs having Net Owned Fund below  Rs 25 lakh cannot access any public\ndeposits .\n(B) The entitlement for quantum of public deposits vis-a-vis the credit rating\nwould be as follows .\nQuantum of deposits for Net owned fund (NOF)\nEquipment Leasing/ Hire\nPurchase Finance\nCompaniesLoan Companies/\nInvestment Companies\nBelow Rs.25 lakh with or\nwithout credit ratingNil Nil\nRs.25 lakh and above\nwithout credit rating as\ncredit rating less than the\nminimum investment gradePublic deposits not\nexceeding 1.5 times of NOF\nor public deposit or Rs.10\ncrore whichever is less\nprovided the company has\nCRAR of 15% or above\nwith immediate effectNil\nRs.25 lakh and above with\nminimum investment grade\ncredit rating4 times of NOF with CRAR\nof not less than\n10% as on 31.3.1998 and\nshall have CRAR of not less\nthan 12% as on 31.3.1999Public deposits not\nexceeding 1.5 times of\nNOF provided the\ncompany has CRAR of\n15% or above with\nimmediate effect.3\nNote : 1.The stipulations regarding ceiling on rate of interest, payment of brokerage,\nperiod of deposit ,  compulsory compliance with prudential norms,  etc.\nremain unchanged.\n2.CRAR  shall  be reckoned with reference to the last audited balance sheet.\n2. Equipment leasing and hire purchase finance companies\n(i) The NBFCs in this category\n(a)not having CRAR of 15 percent or  above  or\n(b)not having minimum investment grade credit rating\nirrespective of their compliance with the prudential norms are\nnot entitled to accept public deposits, as hitherto.\n(ii) The unrated and underrated companies having rating below the minimum\ninvestment grade have been allowed to accept public deposits upto 1.5 times of\ntheir NOF or public deposits upto  Rs.10 crore whichever is less provided their\nCRAR is 15 percent  or above  as per their last audited balance sheet.\n(iii) NBFCs ,\n(a)having CRAR of 10 percent  or above as on March 31, 1998 and\nattaining CRAR of 12 percent as on March 31,1999.\n(b)complying with all other prudential norms; and\n(c)having minimum investment grade credit rating  may accept public\ndeposits up to four times their NOF.\nThe Bank intends to increase the CRAR to 15 percent over a period of time for\nall NBFCs  including those having a minimum investment grade rating. The\ncompanies should, therefore ,  endeavour to increase their CRAR as early as\npossible.\n3. Loan and investment companies\n(i)The unrated and underrated  companies irrespective of their CRAR, are\nnot entitled to accept public deposits, as hitherto.\n(ii)Companies having both, a minimum investment grade credit rating\nand CRAR of 15 per cent  or above may accept public deposits  upto 1.5\ntimes of the NOF.\n(iii)The loan/investment companies not having minimum CRAR of 15\npercent as  on date but otherwise complying with all the prudential norms\nand\n(a)having credit rating of AAA may accept or renew  public deposits up to\nthe level outstanding as at the close of business on December 18, 1998 or\n1.5 times of the NOF whichever is more, subject to the condition that\nthey should attain CRAR of 15 per cent  by March 31, 2000 and bring\ndown the excess public deposits, if any,  by December 31, 2001.\n(Note: The loan / investment companies having credit rating of AAA and\nCRAR of 15 percent and above, and complying with all the prudential\nnorms should bring down the quantum of excess deposits by December\n31, 2001 in manner as shown above.)\n(b)having credit rating of AA / A may  accept or renew public deposits as4\nper the existing provisions of Directions i.e. up to 0.5/1.0 time of their\nNOF but they should attain the minimum CRAR of 15% on or before\nMarch 31, 2000 as per their audited balance sheet, failing which they\nshould regularise their position by repayment or otherwise by December\n31, 2001.\nThis benefit will, however, not be available to those companies whose CRAR is\npresently 15 percent or above but slips down below the minimum level of 15\npercent subsequently.\n4. Downgrading of credit rating and holding\nof excess deposits \u2013 Regularisation\n(i) It has come to our notice some NBFCs were repaying only a part (say 1/3rd) of\nthe maturing deposit by misinterpreting RBI\u2019s direction that the excess deposits\nare to be reduced by at least 1/3rd of the excess at the end of each year. This is\ntantamount to forcing the depositors to renew their deposit and is violative of\nthe provisions of Section 45QA(1) of the RBI Act. RBI would view such\nviolations seriously . Deposits must be repaid on maturity. Further, it is clarified\nthat deposits can be renewed at the sole discretion and violation of the\ndepositors for which a fresh application form should be obtained from them.\n(ii) In order to mitigate the genuine liquidity problems faced by NBFCs in reducing\ntheir excess deposits in compliance with the existing repayment stipulations, the\nexcess deposits arising out of  downgrading of the credit rating as also due to\nregulatory ceilings have been allowed to be repaid at the time of maturity of\nsuch deposits. The NBFCs   should not accept fresh public deposits until the\nquantum of such deposits held by them is within the ceilings permissible as per\nnew directions.  During the interregnum, they may renew such deposits.\nHowever, only AAA rated loan / investment companies may accept fresh\ndeposits or renew maturing deposits as stated in paragraph 3(iii)(a) above even\nif they are holding excess public deposit.\n(iii) The auditors of the NBFCs are specifically being advised  to report to the RBI\nthe steps taken by the companies to regularise the excess deposits.\n5. Disclosure norms for acceptance\nof public deposits by NBFCs\nThe disclosure norms for the NBFCs accepting public deposits have been widened so as\nto enable depositors to make an informed decision.\n(i) Status of rating and quantum of deposit\nThe unrated and under-rated equipment leasing and hire purchase finance\ncompanies accepting public deposits are required to disclose in their application\nforms and advertisements issued, if any ,  for soliciting deposits that the\ncompany is unrated or if it is rated, the latest rating even if it is below the\ninvestment grade along with name of the rating agency. Equipment Leasing and\nHire Purchase Companies having 15 percent CRAR soliciting public deposit\nwithout any rating shall also have to disclose in their application forms that\nquantum of public deposit held, if any, is less than one and one-half times of the\nNOF or Rs.10 crore, whichever is less.5\n(ii) Exposure to Group/connected companies\nAn NBFC soliciting public deposit, shall also disclose in the application form\nand advertisement, if any, its total exposure (including the non-fund based\nfacilities) to companies in the same group, subsidiaries, and other entities as\nalso  business ventures in which directors as well as the NBFC is holding\nsubstantial interest as defined in the Non-Banking Financial Companies\nPrudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998.\n6. Prudential Norms\n(i) Investments in land and building\nand unquoted shares\nNBFCs are directed to restrict their investment in land and building to not more\nthan 10 percent of their owned fund, except for their own use. The ceiling on\ninvestments in unquoted shares of companies other than those in the same group\nand their subsidiaries has been fixed at 10 percent of the owned fund for\nequipment leasing / hire purchase finance companies and 20 percent of owned\nfund for the loan / investment companies. A period of three years has been\nallowed for disposal of the excess holdings of such assets. The  assets acquired\nby the company in satisfaction of its debts should be disposed off within three\nyears from the date of their acquisition.  RBI may consider granting extension\nof time for disposal of such assets on merits of each case.\n(ii) The  NBFC Directions on  Prudential  Norms and the Half-Yearly return on\nPrudential Norms have been amended to include the above changes .\n7. Maintenance of registers of deposits at branches\nAvoidable inconvenience was caused to depositors by some NBFCs in repayment of their\ndeposits at their branches on the plea that deposit records were held at the registered\noffice as per the requirements of RBI. To remove any scope for such a plea, henceforth,\nthe companies are required to maintain register of deposits in respect of the deposit\naccounts opened at any branch at that branch, apart from maintaining a consolidated\nregister of deposits for all the branches at the registered office of the company.\n8. Custody of Liquid Asset Securities\nIn addition to scheduled commercial banks, the Stock Holding Corporation of India Ltd.\n(SHCIL) has also been permitted to act as custodian of securities for liquid assets to be\nmaintained by NBFCs for compliance with the provisions of paragraph 6 of the NBFC\nDirections on acceptance of public deposits. NBFCs desirous of availing of such services\nof SHCIL should obtain prior approval of the concerned Regional Office of RBI.\n9. Maintenance of liquid assets\nThe requirement of maintenance of liquid assets which is presently 12.5 percent of the\npublic deposits will be 15 percent of such deposits on and from April 1, 1999 as already\nnotified vide our Notification No.122 of January 31, 1998. The recommendations of the\nTask force to increase the liquid assets ratio to 25 percent will, however, be implemented\nover a period of time.\nB. Strengthening of Supervisory Mechanism\nThe Reserve Bank of India has instituted a comprehensive supervisory mechanism over\nNBFCs comprising of on-site inspections, off-site surveillance ,  Market Intelligence and\nenlarged role of statutory auditors.6\n(i) On-site Inspection\nThe On-site inspection process structured on the CAMELS ( Capital Adequacy,\nAsset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Systems and Procedure)\npattern aims at ascertaining the level and quality of adherence by the NBFCs to\nthe regulatory norms prescribed by RBI in this regard.\n(ii) Off-site Surveillance system.\nPerformance of companies will be monitored through Off-site Surveillance\ninvolving scrutiny of Statutory Returns, Balance Sheets, Profit & Loss Account,\nAuditors\u2019 Reports etc.  The statutory returns will be analysed using\nsophisticated software for determining the quality of company\u2019s performance\nand adherence to regulatory standards prescribed by the Bank. Supervisory\naction will be triggered against the non-compliant NBFCs.\n(iii) Market Intelligence\nMarket intelligence system has been strengthened with a view to using it as an\nimportant tool of effective supervision and for  picking up early warning signals\nof aberrations in the NBFC sector, which may call for supervisory intervention.\n(iv) Role of Auditors \u2013 Responsibility to report\nto RBI to be included in Appointment letter\nAs you are aware, in terms of RBI Directions to Auditors, the statutory auditors\nare required to report to RBI  by exception, the violations or irregularities, if\nany, noticed by them in the course of audit of an NBFC. NBFCs are advised to\ninclude this requirement of compliance by auditors with  the above directions in\nthe appointment letter to be issued  by them to the auditors so as to ensure that\nthey are aware of  their obligations.\nC. Responsibility of the NBFC for\nsubmission of returns to  RBI\n(i) NBFCs not accepting public deposits are not required to submit periodical\nreturns. However, they are required to obtain registration under the provisions\nof Section 45IA of the RBI Act and furnish information  as  per  paragraph 8(4)\nof the NBFC Directions on Acceptance of Public Deposits. The compliance of\nthe regulations by such companies will be monitored on the basis of exception\nreports received from the auditors and market intelligence system.\n(ii) The NBFCs accepting/holding public deposits are required to furnish to the RBI\nthe following returns :\n(a)Quarterly returns on liquid assets;\n(b)Half-yearly returns on prudential norms;\n(c)Annual returns on deposits; and\n(d)Information as per paragraph 8(4) of the NBFC Directions on Acceptance\nof Public Deposit.\n(iii) Companies having assets of Rs.100 crore and above have been directed to\nfurnish detailed operational data for the last three years.\n(iv) Some companies holding public deposits as on date, have not submitted the\nreturns on liquid assets and prudential norms. This has been viewed seriously\nby the Bank. It may be noted that non-compliance with the directions and\nregulations of the Bank attracts penal provisions of section 58B(5) of RBI Act\ncalling for imprisonment for a term upto three years and fine upto twice the\namount of the deposit received besides the cancellation of certificate of\nregistration issued to the company  or rejection of its application.7\n6.

It was also indicated that the October review would generally be in\nthe nature of a mid-term review of monetary developments during the year,\nand will not necessarily involve changes in credit policy measures.\n2.This statement consists of three parts: ( i) Mid-term review of Macro-\nEconomic and Monetary Developments in 1998-99, (ii) Stance of Monetary\nPolicy for the second half of 1998-99, and (iii) Monetary and Financial Sector\nReforms. No changes in short-term measures such as the Bank Rate, CRR,\nRepo rate are being announced at this point of time. As pointed out in the\nApril Statement, these credit and regulatory measures will continue to be\nsubject to change at short notice in the light of actual domestic developments\nand emerging external market conditions.\n3.The Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (Narasimham Committee),\nwhich submitted its report earlier this year , has made certain far-reaching\nrecommendations. The detailed recommendations of the Committee have\nnow been considered in consultation with the Government of India, and\ndecisions in regard to several of them are being announced in this statement.\n4.In order to deliberate on i ssues relating to harmonising the operations\nof banks and financial institutions, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had, in\nDecember 1997, set up a Working Group comprising Chairmen of some\ncommercial banks and development financial institutions under the2Chairmanship of Shri S.H.Khan, the then Chairman of the Industrial\nDevelopment Bank of India. The Group submitted its full report in May, 1998.\nAs announced in the April Monetary and Credit Policy Statement, a\n\u201cDiscussion Paper\u201d is under preparation, which would contain Reserve\nBank\u2019s views on the Working Group\u2019s recommendations/suggestions. This\npaper will be circulated for discussion shortly. The final decision on the\nissues raised in this paper will be taken in the light of the\nsuggestions/comments received on it.\nMid-term Review of Macro-economic and\nMonetary Developments in 1998-99.\ni) Domestic Developments\n5.Monsoon has been good this year, and it is expected that agriculture\nwill bounce back from a negative growth in 1997-98 to a positive one in 1998-\n99. However, at present, there is some uncertainty about the extent of likely\nincrease in agricultural production during the year as some parts of the\ncountry have been affected by floods and late rains. Taking this factor into\naccount, a rate of growth of 3 per cent in agricultural production over the\ndepressed level of 1997-98 seems a reasonable estimate at this point of time,\npending further confirmation about the effect of late rains. As regards\nindustrial growth, although there are some incipient signs of recovery, it is not\nyet clear whether the rate of growth in industrial output will be substantially\nhigher than last year\u2019s growth of 6.5 per cent. Allowing for the turnaround in\nagriculture and some recovery in industrial production, at present the best\nestimate for GDP growth for 1998-99 is in the region of 6 per cent (as\ncompared with 5.1 per cent in 1997-98). In view of the global slow-down in\neconomic activity, this order of growth will place India as one of the very few\ncountries, developed or developing, which will show a relatively high positive\nrate of growth during the current year.\n6.The rate of inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index on a\npoint-to-point basis, is currently ruling at over 8 per cent, which is significantly3higher than the rate which, as pointed out in the April Statement, should not\nexceed 5 to 6 per cent per annum. So far, the increase in the rate of inflation\nis concentrated in a few primary commodities, particularly fruits and\nvegetables and edible oils. Hopefully, with the arrival of the new crop, and the\nbeginning of the period of seasonal decline in prices, the annual rate of\ninflation would decelerate in the next three - four months. However, recent\ntrends in inflation are a matter of concern, and there can be no room for\ncomplacency on this account.\n7.The rate of growth of Money Supply (M 3) during the current financial\nyear upto October 9, 1998 has been 10.1 per cent compared with 7.3 per\ncent in the corresponding period of the previous year, partly due to inflows of\nreceipts on account of Resurgent India Bonds (RIBs). If RIB inflows are\nexcluded, M 3 expansion during the current financial year so far would be\naround 7.9 per cent. On a year-on-year basis, M 3 growth (October 9, 1998\nover October 10, 1997) was 20.6 per cent (and excluding RIB receipts, 18.3\nper cent) as against 16.8 per cent in the comparable period of the preceding\nyear. Thus, even if the impact of RIB inflows is excluded, there has been a\nstrong growth in money supply during the current financial year so far. The\ncurrent year\u2019s M 3 expansion is mainly reflective of the sharp increase in\naggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks which showed an\nincrease of Rs.66 ,563 crore (11.0 per cent) as compared with Rs.37,687\ncrore (7.5 per cent). Time deposits have increased by Rs.68 ,480 crore (13.6\nper cent) as compared with Rs.42,824 crore (10.3 per cent) last year. Thus,\nthe increase in aggregate deposits is attributable to growth in time deposits\nwhich was even higher than the increase in aggregate deposits.\n8.Reserve money which essentially represents liquid cash balances in\nthe economy rose by Rs.8 ,343 crore (3.7 per cent) in the current financial\nyear upto October 9, 1998, as compared with Rs.5,640 crore (2.8 per cent) in\nthe corresponding period of the previous financial year. With net foreign\nexchange assets of the Reserve Bank growing by a lower amount in the\ncurrent financial year upto October 9, 1998 (Rs.8 ,967 crore as against4Rs.13,337 crore last year), net RBI credit to Government had assumed\nsignificance in the reserve money creation, having gone up by Rs.11,010\ncrore in contrast to a decline of Rs.8,947 crore in the same period of last\nyear.\n9.The Budget for 1998-99, presented to Parliament on June 1, 1998\nprojected a fiscal deficit of 5.6 per cent of GDP. Accordingly, the gross\nborrowing requirement of Central Government for the year is placed at\nRs.79,376 crore. Net borrowing requirements were placed at Rs.48 ,326\ncrore. The corresponding actuals for 1997-98 were Rs.59 ,637 crore and\nRs.40,494 crore, respectively. The borrowing requirements estimated for\n1998-99 are undoubtedly high and account for a substantial portion of the\nincremental deposits in the banking system. In order to minimise the impact\nof such high borrowing requirements on the interest rate outlook, the Reserve\nBank had indicated on June 11, 1998, its intention to accept private\nplacement of securities from time to time (in the event of market bids being at\nrelatively high levels due to uncertainties in the market) and then release\nthem to the market as conditions improve.\n10.This approach has worked reasonably well. As on October 29, 1998,\nnearly 84.9 per cent of the gross and 93.0 per cent of the net borrowing\nprogramme has been completed. Despite a steep hike in the repo rate of 300\nbasis points on August 20, 1998 and an increase in cash reserve ratio (CRR)\nby 1 percentage point effective the fortnight beginning August 29, 1998, the\nyields on primary auctions of longer term Central Government papers issued\nin September 1998 have increased by only three basis points each for 6-year\nsecurity and 10-year security over the yields on issues of same tenor made\nearlier in July 1998. The Reserve Bank has also taken measures to minimise\nthe impact of RIB inflows on money markets by offering special repo and\nother facilities for temporary parking of excess liquid funds with banks.\n11.Despite some additional pressures on the fiscal position, the\nGovernment has announced its firm intention to contain the fiscal deficit, and\nits borrowing requirements, to the levels announced in the Budget for 1998-599. This is a welcome development, as the importance of containing fiscal\ndeficit to budgeted levels in the current year cannot be over-emphasised. The\ncurrent inflation rate is a matter of concern and the outlook for industrial\ngrowth continues to be uncertain. The external environment is also highly\nunfavourable. In this situation, any increase in the fiscal deficit during the\nyear would put further pressure on the outlook for medium and long-term\ninterest rates, besides adding to the already high rate of monetary growth.\nLooking beyond the current year, it is becoming increasingly evident that a\nsignificant reduction in fiscal deficit over the next 2 to 3 years is now a high\nnational priority. Beyond a point, it is simply not feasible for banks and\nfinancial institutions to increase the share of Government securities in their\noverall asset portfolio without affecting their own viability - and indeed the\nviability of the productive sectors of the economy.\n12.There was a substantial increase in food credit extended by scheduled\ncommercial banks. Food credit has expanded by Rs.3 ,464 crore (upto\nOctober 9, 1998) as against Rs.1,455 crore in the corresponding period of\nlast year, reflecting in part the increase in food procurement operations and\nthe build-up of buffer stocks of foodgrains. Non-food credit has also shown a\nsubstantial increase during the current year. Most of the increase has taken\nplace in the last two fortnights (upto October 9, 1998). The increase in non-\nfood credit to the commercial sector by scheduled commercial banks was of\nthe order of Rs.6 ,972 crore (2.2 per cent) in the current financial year upto\nOctober 9, 1998 as against Rs.4,686 crore (1.7 per cent) in the\ncorresponding period of last year. The total resources flow to commercial\nsector including banks\u2019 investments in shares and debentures, capital issues,\nborrowings from financial institutions, etc., have shown a sharper increase.\nScheduled commercial banks\u2019 investments in commercial paper, shares,\ndebentures, etc., increased by Rs.8 ,787 crore in the current financial year so\nfar as compared with Rs.8,506 crore in the comparable period of last year.\nTogether with such investments, the total flow of resources from the\nscheduled commercial banks to the commercial sector went up by Rs.15 ,759\ncrore (4.6 per cent) compared with Rs.13,192 crore (4.5 per cent) in the6corresponding period of 1997-98. The total resources flow to commercial\nsector including capital issues, GDRs and borrowings from financial\ninstitutions was much higher at Rs.41 ,792 crore upto October 9, 1998 as\nagainst Rs.34,645 crore in the corresponding period of last year.\n13.It will be recalled that, following the April 1998 monetary and credit\npolicy, there was some disappointment that, in the absence of a CRR cut,\nthere could be a shortage of liquidity resulting in substantially higher interest\nrates. At that time, the Reserve Bank had drawn attention to the prevailing\neasy liquidity conditions and had given an assurance that CRR would be\nreduced in case there was any evidence of tight liquidity conditions. As it\nhappened, liquidity conditions eased further during the period May to August\n1998. Outstanding amounts of repos on a daily basis during this period\naveraged Rs.5 ,064 crore. In retrospect, it is clear that the decision not to cut\nthe CRR at that time proved to be the correct one. In view of subsequent\ndevelopments, it is arguable that CRR should have in fact been raised in April\nitself. However, given the state of market expectations at that time, such a\nmove could have been highly destabilising, possibly resulting in a sharp jump\nin interest rates. The events of the last few months illustrate the delicate\nbalance that has to be struck between conflicting considerations in deciding\non changes in monetary policy measures in the short-term.  Monetary policy\nhas to facilitate growth while at the same time maintaining external and\ninternal stability. In the long run, these objectives are mutually reinforcing;\nhowever, in the very short run, they may point in different directions.\n(ii) External Developments\n14.The period since the April monetary and credit policy was announced\nhas presented major challenges for management of the external sector. The\nEast Asian economic crisis, which appeared to be coming under control\nduring the earlier part of the year, continues to remain serious. The contagion\nspread to Russia in August and could affect some Latin American countries\nas well. The economic outlook in Japan appears uncertain. Equity, bond and7forex markets in the United States and Europe have also been affected.\nAlthough there has been some upward movement in global stock markets in\nthe past fortnight, the world economy, as a whole, continues to be faced with\nconsiderable uncertainty. In addition to the unfavourable external situation,\nIndia was also confronted with certain other developments after the Pokhran\ntest. Among these developments were the economic sanctions imposed by\ncertain industrial countries, the suspension of fresh multilateral lending\n(except for some sectors), the downgrade by rating agencies, and the\nreduction in net investment of foreign institutional investors.\n15.Viewed against the above background, developments in respect of\nIndia\u2019s foreign exchange market have been orderly and generally satisfactory.\nA major positive development has been the success of the Resurgent India\nBonds (RIBs) floated by the State Bank of India. Foreign currency resources\namounting to US $ 4.2 billion were raised under the RIB scheme. India\u2019s\npresent foreign currency assets are higher than at the beginning of January\n1998 in both gross and net terms (i.e., after excluding forward liabilities).\nConsidering the unfavourable international environment, this is a matter of\nsome satisfaction. The level of reserves also substantially exceeds the total\nstock of short-term debt and portfolio flows. As a matter of cautious policy,\nIndia has kept its short-term as well as forward liabilities at a low level in\nrelation to the size of its reserves.\n16.In the earlier part of the year, there was considerable discussion on\nmovements in the Real Effective Exchange Rate of the rupee (REER). As\npointed out in the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s statement on June 11, 1998, the\nRBI does not consider REER to be an effective tool for management of short-\nterm movements in the exchange rate. REER movements are subject to\nvarious influences, including capital flows, and the estimation of REER raises\nseveral methodological issues, e.g., the choice of a basket of currencies, the\nchoice of the base period, the choice of trade-based weights, and the choice\nof a price index. Nevertheless, in view of the interest in this measure, the\nReserve Bank has been publishing movements in the REER of the rupee8using trade based weights for 36 countries. In order to make this data more\nup-to-date, in the last few months, the Reserve Bank has also been releasing\nsupplemental information on REER based on 5-country trade based weights\nwith more recent base years. The latest statistics, since June 1998, in regard\nto the market rate of the rupee (i.e., RBI Reference Rate) and the imputed\nREER, with the base year 1993-94, are given below for information. It is,\nhowever, reiterated that while these data have some information content, the\nReserve Bank does not use short-term movements in REER as indicator of\nappropriateness or otherwise of exchange rate movements.\nMonth & Year               RBI Reference Rate        Imputed value of Rupee\n                                                                                                               Based on REER\n                                                                                (Base 1993-94=100)\n                                                         (Rupees per US dollar)\nJune, 1998      42.25 42.05\nJuly, 1998      42.51 42.55\nAugust, 1998      42.75 43.04\nSeptember, 1998      42.52 42.11\nOctober 29, 1998      42.29 41.12\n17.The primary objective of the Reserve Bank and the Government in\nmanagement of the exchange rate is to maintain orderly conditions in the\nforeign exchange market, and to prevent the emergence of destabilising\nspeculative activities. To this end, as in the past, the Reserve Bank will\ncontinue to closely monitor developments in the financial markets at home\nand abroad, and take such monetary and administrative actions as may be\nconsidered necessary from time to time. The Reserve Bank will not hesitate\nto use its reserves, when warranted, to meet sharp day-to-day supply-\ndemand imbalances in the market. As before, it will ensure that lumpy and\nuneven demand, particularly for oil imports and debt servicing obligations of\nGovernment, does not cause any disturbance in the orderly functioning of\nforeign exchange market.918.A reduction in interest rates for pre-shipment and post-shipment credit\nto exporters by 2 percentage points (from the prevailing levels) was\nannounced by Government in August 1998, to be effective upto the end of\nMarch 1999. Thus, for most categories of export credit, the interest rate is 9\nper cent per annum. In order to facilitate the implementation of this decision,\nthe Reserve Bank announced a corresponding reduction of 2 percentage\npoints in the refinance rate available to banks for export credit (to 7 per cent\nfrom 9 per cent per annum). The average utilisation of export credit refinance\nduring the fortnight ended October 9, 1998 was Rs.4 ,838 crore as compared\nwith Rs.24 crore during the corresponding fortnight last year, which has\nadded to the growth of liquidity in the system. While the importance of\naccelerating the rate of growth of exports can hardly be over-emphasised, it\nmust be stressed that provision of rupee export credit at present rates is not\nsustainable in the long run. As already announced, these rates will revert to\nearlier levels after March 1999. In order to ensure internationally competitive\ninterest cost for exporters, on June 11, 1998, the Reserve Bank had advised\nbanks to charge a spread of not more than 1.5 percentage points over LIBOR\non foreign currency loans (as against 2.0/2.5 percentage points over LIBOR\nprior to this date). Such foreign currency loans can be serviced out of foreign\ncurrency export receipts. Exporters are advised to make maximum use of this\nfacility. Banks are also requested to make this facility easily accessible\nwithout any procedural hassles.\n19.In order to create an exporter-friend ly environment and to simplify\nprocedures for delivery of credit to exporters, the Reserve Bank will be\nsetting up a Working Group of bankers. This group of officials will interact\nwith exporters as well as local bank officials by visiting bank branches in\nsome of the major exporting centres especially where small and medium size\nexporters are located. On the basis of such interactions, the Working Group\nwill suggest changes designed to reduce repetitive documentation\nrequirements and improve the quality and reduce cost of non-fund based\nservices to exporters. The objective would be to make available export credit\n\u201con line\u201d, including foreign currency loans mentioned above, on the basis of10performance with minimum paper work, and provide related services\nefficiently.\n20.Exporters currently enjoy a facility to retain a portion of their earnings\nrepatriated to India to be utilised for certain purposes under the scheme of\nExchange Earners Foreign Currency (EEFC) accounts. Over a period,\nimprovements have been made in the EEFC scheme by enhancing the\nretention percentage as also purposes for which the balances in the account\ncan be utilised. Presently, the entitlement is 50 per cent for all foreign\nexchange earners and 70 per cent for exporters coming under the categories\nof export oriented units (EOUs) or of those who operate in export processing\nzones, etc. The balances can be presently utilised for all trade related\nexpenses outside India as also for payment to residents in foreign exchange\nin consideration of supply of goods and services, and approved capital\naccount transactions. The Working Group of bankers being constituted to\nsimplify procedures for credit delivery to exporters will also review the\noperation of the EEFC scheme with a view to suggesting improvements in the\nscheme and making it more exporter friendly.\nStance of Monetary Policy for\nOctober 1998 - March 1999\n21.As the preceding review has brought out, there are several areas of\nconcern in respect of current monetary trends in the economy. Money supply\ngrowth, attributable largely to growth in the banking sector\u2019s credit to\nGovernment, is too high in relation to the expected growth of the real sector\nof the economy. The rate of inflation is also higher than the initial projections.\nAlthough the price rise during the current financial year so far is largely\nconcentrated on a few food items (e.g., fruits and vegetables and edible oils),\nthere is no denying the fact that such a high rate of monetary growth is\ninconsistent with the objective of maintenance of general price stability. In\nthis situation, a case could be made out for monetary tightening through\nmeasures, such as, increasing the interest rates or a further increase in the\nCRR.1122.However, it has to be recognised that industrial slow down is still\npersisting, and as far as possible nothing should be done to dampen\nemerging signs of incipient recovery in the real sector. This view is reinforced\nby the fact that growth of bank credit to the commercial sector has not been a\nprimary cause of expansion in money supply in the current year. These\nconflicting considerations, viz., the need to reduce monetary expansion while\nat the same time nurturing real growth, starkly illustrate the monetary policy\ndilemma that the RBI faces at the present juncture.\n23.On balance of considerations, for the time being, it is not proposed to\nchange the CRR or interest rates. RBI will continue to manage liquidity\nthrough Open Market Operations and repo operations. The Reserve Bank will\nnot hesitate to resort to further monetary tightening if inflationary pressures\nincrease or if external developments so warrant.\n24.In the past year, as indicated in the April Statement, there has been a\npro-active management of liquidity in the system through open market\noperations and more frequent variations in the repo rate. Fixed rate repos\nwere first introduced as a regular monetary policy instrument on November\n29, 1997 at the rate of 4.5 per cent. In view of excess liquidity in the system\nand forex market developments, the repo rate was raised in three stages to 9\nper cent on January 16, 1998. After the return of stability in the forex market,\nthe repo rate was reduced in stages to 5 per cent by June 1998. On August\n20, 1998, however, in response to external market developments and\nanticipated large inflows of additional liquidity on account of RIB funds, the\nrepo rate was increased to 8 per cent. As a consequence, the outstanding\nrepo of RBI averaged Rs.6 ,329 crore per day in September, 1998. The repo\nrate, has thus, served as a reference point for market expectations about the\nmovement in short-term interest rates. This is reflected in the fact that the\ninter-bank call rates have generally tracked above the fixed rate repo in\nrecent months. Since April 1997, the Bank Rate has also been used flexibly,\nalthough less frequently. It is proposed to continue with the policy of flexible12use of interest rate instruments to signal RBI\u2019s stance regarding monetary\nconditions and management of the flow of liquidity in the system.\nMonetary and Financial Sector Reforms\n25.The financial crisis in South-East Asia and Japan has brought to the\nfore the problems that weak and fragile domestic financial sector can pose for\nthe real economy. It is now established beyond reasonable doubt that while a\npersistent and unexpected downturn in the real economy creates difficult\nproblems for the financial sector, a fragile financial sector can deepen the\nreal economy crisis and impose heavy social costs. It is, therefore, of utmost\nimportance to strengthen capital adequacy, income recognition and\nprovisioning norms for banks as well as other financial institutions and to\nmove towards full disclosure and transparency in banking operations in line\nwith international best practices. \n26.As a part of economic reforms, since the early nineties, the capital\nadequacy and other prudential norms of banks have been strengthened and\ncurrently are close to the international standards. The quality and standards\nof supervision have also been upgraded substantially under the direction of a\nseparate Board for Financial Supervision under the aegis of the Reserve\nBank of India. Barring the performance of a select few weak banks, whose\nproblems are being addressed separately, the improvement in the banking\nsector as a whole is impressive. In terms of inherent robustness, it is well\nrecognised that the Indian banking system\u2019s exposure to real estate or shares\nis negligible, while open foreign currency exposure limits are severely\nrestricted. Their off-balance sheet liabilities are also very small due to\nregulatory restrictions and a relatively large part of banking system\u2019s assets\nare in secure investments particularly in Government and approved\nsecurities. These features of the Indian banking system are important\nstrengths and contribute to their long-term financial viability.\n27. While substantial progress has already been made as a result of\nimplementation of several recommendations made by the first Narasimham13Committee Report (i.e., the Report of the Committee on Financial System), it\nis now necessary to go further. The second Narasimham Committee Report,\nsubmitted to Government earlier this year, provides the basis for doing so.\n(i) Narasimham Committee II\n28.In consultation with the Government of India, the Rese rve Bank has\nfinalised its views on a large number of specific recommendations, which are\nwithin its purview. The aspects on which decisions taken by RBI along with a\nbrief summary of the Committee\u2019s recommendations are given separately as\na part of this statement (Annexure). Some of the important decisions, which\nwill be implemented in phases over a period of time, are as follows:\n\u2022 In line with the international best practices, the minimum capital to risk\nasset ratio is being raised from the existing 8 per cent to 9 percent which\nwould take effect from the year ending March 31, 2000.\n\u2022 With a view to further improving the quality of asset portfolio and\nenhancing the financial soundness of banks, income recognition and\nprovisioning norms on Government guaranteed advances are being\nbrought on par with those on other advances with effect from the financial\nyear 2000-2001. Provisions on existing and old government guaranteed\nadvances which would consequently become NPA are to be fully provided\nfor over a period of four years beginning March 31, 1999.\n\u2022 For enhancing the inherent strength of banks\u2019 balance sheets, provisioning\nrequirements are being introduced for standard assets with effect from\nfinancial year ending March 31, 2000. The time frame for categorising an\nadvance as doubtful debt is being shortened. The banks would be\npermitted to achieve the said provisioning norms in two phases, during the\nyears 2000-2001 and 2001-2002.\n\u2022 By the year ending March 31, 2000, Government/approved securities will\nhave to be provided for a risk weight of 2.5 per cent. The balance of 2.514per cent risk weight on Government/approved securities will be announced\nat a later date. Going a step beyond the recommendations of the Second\nNarasimham Committee on introduction of market risk on Government and\napproved securities, an additional risk weight of 20 per cent on\ninvestments in the government guaranteed securities of Government\nundertakings which do not form part of the market borrowing programme is\nalso being introduced. In order to provide sufficient time to banks to make\nthis provision, this requirement will come into effect year after next, i.e.,\nfinancial year 2000-2001. In respect of the outstanding stock of such\nsecurities in the portfolio as on March 31, 2000, banks will implement this\ndecision in two phases of 10 per cent each in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003.\n\u2022 The risk weight for Government guaranteed advances which go into\ndefault is being introduced with effect from the year ending March 31,\n2000. (Please see Annexure for details).\n\u2022 Foreign exchange open positions will carry 100 per cent risk weight with\neffect from March 31, 1999.\n\u2022 Banks are advised to introduce effective risk management systems to\ncover credit risk, market risk and operational risk on a priority basis. To\nthis end, a comprehensive risk measurement approach should be adopted\nand a detailed structure of operating limits, guidelines and other\nparameters should be put in place. Banks have also been advised recently\nto address market risks in a structured manner by adopting a more\ncomprehensive Asset-Liability Management Practices with effect from April\n1, 1999. Guidelines on management of credit risk, market risk, operational\nrisk, etc., will be issued soon.\n\u2022 Banks are being requested to ensure a loan review mechanism for larger\nadvances soon after its sanction and monitor any weakness that may\ndevelop in such accounts for initiating timely corrective action.1529.In implementing the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee,\ncare has been taken to phase them in a manner that reduces the risk\nexposures of banks, strengthens financial soundness and contributes to\nimproved profitability outlook. RBI recognises that strengthening of capital\nadequacy and prudential norms could pose some immediate resource\nmanagement problems, in particular for some public sector banks which are\nconstrained by legislation in their ability to raise further capital from the\nmarket. The issue of capital support from Government and enhancing public\nsector banks\u2019 ability to access the capital market to meet their capital\nrequirements deserves to be debated and resolved at an early date as it is\ncentral to ensuring the future financial viability of the banking sector.\n30.The Narasimham Committee had also made certain important\nrecommendations regarding reduction in Government/RBI shareholding in\npublic sector banks and on some other matters on which final decisions have\nto be taken by Government of India. Decisions on these as well as certain\nother recommendations would, however, entail amendments to the existing\nStatutes/Acts.\n(ii) Risk Weights and Exposure Norms on\n     Securities of Public Financial Institutions\n31.While investments in bonds/securities of some of the Public Financial\nInstitutions (PFIs) carry zero risk weight due to their status as `Approved\nSecurities\u2019 under the special statutes governing them, investments in\nbonds/debentures of certain other PFIs carry 100 per cent risk weight as the\nrelevant Act/Statute does not confer the status of an `Approved Security\u2019.\nWith a view to removing this anomaly, risk weights on investments in\nbonds/debentures of PFIs as defined under Section 4A of the Companies Act,\n1956 (and certain other FIs notified by RBI) are being given a uniform risk\nweight of 20 per cent.\n32.Investments in Centr al/State Government securities or in securities\nguaranteed by them have hitherto been assigned zero risk weight. It is now16proposed to assign a risk weight of 2.5 per cent on account of market risk, as\nstated earlier by March 31, 2000. However, in case of advances guaranteed\nby the Government, non payment of guaranteed amount or a default in\ninterest/principal would attract risk weights as given in Annexure.\n33.It has also been decided that henceforth investments by banks in\nbonds or debentures of a corporate guaranteed by a PFI will be treated as an\nexposure by banks on the PFI and not on the corporate as is the practice at\npresent. Consequently, for the purpose of calculation of exposure norms, the\nexposure of the bank on the PFI guaranteeing the bond or debenture issued\nby corporates will be 100 per cent, whereas the exposure by the PFI on the\ncorporate will be to the extent of 50 per cent.\n(iii) Payment and Settlement System\n34.For improving the conduct of monetary policy in the context of finan cial\nmarket reforms and opening up of the economy, it is necessary to set in place\na robust integrated payment and settlement system. It is essential to\neliminate the costs to the financial system presently in existence due to\npayment system floats, and large delays in processing and settling systems\nand legal hurdles in settlements. The objective should be to bring about\noperational efficiency, speed, better accuracy and timeliness of payment\ntransactions as also to contain financial risks in the national payments\nsystem. For attaining this objective, the Reserve Bank has gone in for a\nreliable communication backbone through the establishment of VSAT-\nnetwork. This network will expand in phases and over time, encompass the\nentire financial sector. The setting up of this network provides us with an\nopportunity as well as a challenge to carefully plan and design a strategy to\nmove towards real time gross settlement (RTGS) system which is adopted by\nmany major countries in the world. The RTGS system would cover all the\nbanking and financial market transactions, reduce transaction costs, and17improve efficiency in the transmission of channels of monetary policy. The\nReserve Bank has already instituted a Payment System Group (PSG) and a\nVSAT user Group to deal with issues relating to RTGS system. Successful\nimplementation of RTGS system will, however, require active co-operation of\nall the market participants, including commercial banks. The Reserve Bank\nwill take major initiatives in establishing such a system under the guidance of\na high level National Payments Council which will be set up soon.\n(iv) Money and Government\n      Securities Markets\nMoney Market\n35.Development of an efficient and vibrant money market is an integral\npart of financial liberalisation and often considered a pre-requisite for efficient\ntransmission of monetary policy. As development of instruments, institutions\nand operating procedures form a vital part of money market development, the\nReserve Bank had taken a series of measures in recent years, which include\nintroduction of new instruments like the Certificates of Deposit (CDs),\nCommercial Paper (CP) and inter-bank participations (IBPs), widening the\nscope of participation and strengthening the institutional infrastructure.  With\na view to providing an additional short-term avenue to investors, the scheme\nof Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs) was introduced. Measures have\nalso been taken to increase the instruments and investor base in the Repo\nmarket and to develop a term money market. The participants in the\ncall/notice money, bills rediscounting market and MMMFs have also been\nincreased.\n36.Measures relating to money market announced in the April 1998\nstatement, viz., reduction in the minimum size of operation per transaction\nfrom Rs.5 crore to Rs.3 crore for entities routing their call money transactions\nthrough primary dealers, and reduction from 30 days to 15 days in the\nminimum lock-in period for Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs) and in the18period for transferability of Certificates of Deposit (CDs) have already been\nimplemented.\n37.The Narasimham Committee II had made some specific suggestions\nrelating to money market in order to facilitate an efficient integration of\nfinancial markets.\n\u2022 The Committee\u2019s suggestions that the minimum period of fixed deposits\ncould be reduced to 15 days and all money market instruments should\nlike-wise have a similar duration have already been implemented.\n\u2022 The Committee has observed that the call money market in India, unlike in\nmost well developed markets, is not strictly an inter-bank market and\nsince non-bank participants are not subjected to reserve requirements,\nthe market is often subject to volatility. In this context, the Committee has\nrecommended that the call/notice money market and term money market\nshould be strictly restricted to banks and primary dealers. In the\nCommittee\u2019s view, non-bank parties can be provided free access to other\nmoney market instruments like Commercial Paper (CP), CDs, bills\nrediscounts, Treasury bills and MMMFs. The Reserve Bank concurs, in\nprinciple, with the Committee on this matter, and aims to ultimately move\ntowards a pure inter-bank call/notice/term-money market including\nprimary dealers. This will be implemented in a manner that the existing\nlenders in the market will have operational flexibility to adjust their asset-\nliability structure. Simultaneously, measures will be taken to widen the\nrepo market and improve non-bank participation in a variety of other\ninstruments.\n\u2022 The RBI also agrees with the Committee\u2019s suggestion that there must be\nclearly defined prudent limits for banks\u2019 reliance on the call money market.\nIt is expected that the Asset-Liability Management guidelines would\nenable banks to organise their treasury operations without placing heavy\nreliance on call money borrowings.19\u2022 The RBI broadly agrees with the Committee\u2019s suggestion that the RBI\nsupport to the market should be through a Liquidity Adjustment Facility\n(LAF) operated by way of repo providing a reasonable corridor for market\nplay. While it is recognised that the repo is technically an efficient route\nfor LAF, in view of certain procedural and technological constraints in\ntransfer and settlement of securities, it may not be possible to introduce a\nscheme of LAF immediately. However, it has been decided to take all\nactions that will enable, in due course, to replace the present general\nrefinance facility. The export credit refinance will continue as a separate\nscheme and reviewed independently. Besides, collateralised intra-\nday/over-night facility with adequate margin is also being considered to\nfacilitate smooth operation of payment and settlement system to be placed\neventually on real time gross settlements (RTGS) basis.\n\u2022 In line with the Committee\u2019s view that the money market lacks a well\ndefined yield curve for short-term to long-term maturity and that an inter-\nbank reference rate like a LIBOR has to emerge, RBI has taken initiatives\nin the recent past to develop a term money market as also to evolve a\nreference rate. The most important of them is the initiative taken in April\n1997 whereby inter-bank liabilities were exempted from the maintenance\nof reserve requirements . It is expected that term money market will\ndevelop once banks put in place proper ALM systems. A reassuring\nfeature has been that some agencies have already developed call money\nlinked reference rates.\n38.It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had placed a\nrestriction of a minimum period of 3 days for ready-forward (repo)\ntransactions effective September 30, 1995. In the backdrop of the inter-bank\nliabilities having been exempted from the requirements of maintenance of\nCRR (except for the statutory minimum requirement of 3 per cent) and with a\nview to enabling banks and other participants in the repo market to adjust\ntheir liquidity in a more flexible manner, it has been decided to withdraw the20restriction of the minimum period for ready-forward (repo) transactions\neffective from October 31, 1998.\n39.Product development is an integral part of improving market  efficiency.\nSome banks have proposed that interest rate swaps may be permitted with a\nview to enabling them to hedge against interest rate risk arising out of asset-\nliability mismatches.  With a view to further deepen the money market as also\nto enable banks, primary dealers and all-India financial institutions to hedge\ninterest rate risks, the Reserve Bank has decided, in principle, to create an\nenvironment that would facilitate introduction of interest rate swaps. Those\nwho participate in the call/notice money market either as direct lenders or\nborrowers are proposed to be permitted to undertake interest rate swaps. RBI\nwill examine, in consultation with market participants, relevant aspects such\nas standard documentation, the back-up by underlying transactions between\nparties, the bench-mark rate and maturity, and prudential prescriptions before\nallowing the product in the market.\nGovernment Securities Market\n40.The Government securities market constitutes the principal segment of\nthe debt market and serves as the benchmark for pricing corporate papers of\nvarying maturities.  With the objectives of broadening the market with a\ndiversified investor base and imparting greater liquidity and turnover,\nconcerted efforts have been made by Government of India and the Reserve\nBank in the direction of instrument development, institutional development\nand towards improving market efficiency and transparency. The most\nsignificant steps were the introduction of the auction system and of innovative\nproducts as well as the setting up of a system of primary and satellite dealers.\n41.Some of the policy measures implemented since April 1997 include,\nexpansion of instruments eligible for repo/reverse repo transactions,\npermitting a number of non-bank entities to enter into reverse repo\ntransactions, introduction of 14 day Treasury Bills, notifying of amounts in the\ncase of all the auctions, keeping \u201cnon-competitive\u201d bids outside the notified21amount and entry of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in the government\nsecurities market. A few announcements, such as, the introduction of 28 day\nTreasury Bills, reintroduction of 182 day Treasury Bills and changes in\nfrequency of Treasury Bills auctions had to be put on hold since there was\nreduced investor interest in Treasury Bills due to unprecedented market\ndevelopments. With the continuous availability of fixed rate repos for\nabsorption of liquidity, the proposal to use one day repos/reverse repos for\nliquidity adjustment has also been deferred.\n42.The other recent ini tiatives for developing the Government securities\nmarket include the move towards repeal of the Public Debt Act, 1944 and its\nreplacement by the Government Securities Act. The revised Bill has already\nbeen approved by the Cabinet and is awaiting Parliament Clearance. Further,\nthe proposed changes in the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 will\npave way for a more active repos market and introduction of new market\nfeatures like when issued trading. It is also proposed to introduce a uniform\nprice auction method in respect of 91 day Treasury Bill auctions.\n(v) Regulation of Non-banking\n     Financial Companies (NBFCs)\n43.Pursuant to the amendment to the RBI Act 1934 by Parliament, RBI\nhad instituted a comprehensive regulatory framework for NBFCs in January\n1998 in respect of their deposit acceptance activities, prudential norms on\nincome recognition, accounting standard, asset classification, provisioning for\nbad and doubtful debts, capital adequacy, credit and investment\nconcentration. In order to ensure that only the financially sound and well run\nNBFCs could mobilise public deposits, obtaining of minimum investment\ngrade credit rating from one of the credit rating agencies was made\nmandatory and ceilings on the quantum of public deposits were correlated to\nthe level of their credit rating. Of about 9,000 applications of NBFCs found to\nbe eligible for registration on the basis of minimum Net Owned Fund (NOF) of\nRs.25 lakh, RBI has already decided on the applications of 7,300 companies.22The entire process of registration is expected to be completed by the end of\nDecember, 1998.\n44.The appropriate regulation of NBFCs is a complex task in view of the\nlarge number of NBFCs which are spread all over the country. NBFCs\nperform an important financing role in the economy particularly in respect of\nsmall scale and decentralised sector and provide important employment and\nentrepreneurial opportunities at the ground level. However, prevalence of\nunethical financial practices as well as lack of transparency in operations\nhave also been marked in the case of some sections of the NBFC sector.\nThese have resulted in widespread complaints from depositors about their\nfunctioning. Taking into account both the positive as well as the negative\naspects of the NBFC sector, RBI and Government have been open to\nsuggestions and advice from experts and market participants to further refine\nthe regulatory framework for NBFCs, develop self-regulatory mechanism for\nsmaller NBFCs, and improve operational effectiveness.\n45.In order to undertake a comprehensive examination of the regulatory\nexperience so far and the problems that have arisen on the ground, the\ngovernment had set up a Task Force to make further recommendations for\neffective regulation of the NBFC sector. RBI was closely associated with the\nwork of the Task Force. Proposals of the Task Force are now under\nconsideration of the Government. RBI will make appropriate changes in the\nregulatory framework as soon as decisions of the Government, including any\nlegislative changes that may be required to give effect to Task Force\nrecommendations become available. Until then, NBFCs are advised to strictly\nadhere to the current regulations in force.\n46. An investors\u2019 information programme is also being carried out by RBI\nto ensure that investors are fully aware of the prescribed ceiling on interest\nrates, disclosure requirements, unsecured nature of deposits and other\nfeatures of NBFC operations.23Mumbai,\nOctober 30, 1998\n.ANNEXURE\nRecommendations of the Committee on\nBanking Sector Reforms\n             Recommendations                                    Decisions taken\n(i) 5 per cent weight for market\nrisk for Government/approved\nsecurities\n(Para  No.3.11)To be implemented in phases:\n2.5 per cent risk weight by the year\nending March 31, 2000.

BC. 94/ 21. 04. 098/ 98\nSeptember 10, 1998\nTo\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(excluding Regional Rural Banks)\nDear Sir,\nAsset - Liability Management (ALM) System\nAs you are aware, the RBI has decided to introduce the Asset- Liability Management (ALM) System, as a\npart of the Risk Management and control Systems in banks. We forward herewith broad Draft guidelines\nfor measurement of liquidity risk and interest rate risk for putting in place the ALM System. The guidelines\nsent with this letter are intended to form the basis for initiating measures for collection, compilation and\nanalysis of data required to support the ALM System. You may study the guidelines and forward to us\nyour suggestions and difficulties, if any, that may be encountered in implementation of the system.\n2. You will observe that the banks will have to analyse the past data for studying their behavioural and\nseasonal pattern and fix the benchmarks required for preparing maturity profile of various components of\nAssets and Libilities including Off-Balance Sheet Items. The guidelines would serve as a benchmark for\nthose banks which lack a formal ALM System. Banks which have already adopted more sophisticated\nsystems may continue their existing systems but they should fine-tune their Information and Reporting\nSystems. The banks shall also have to take views on the interest rate movements and fix prudential limits\non the Gaps. The exercise will require constant review and updating. We therefore, suggest that banks\nmay immediately set up a small Group under the charge of the General Manager (Funds\nManagement/Treasury) with senior officers drawn from Investments, Foreign Exchange, Credit and\nManagement Information departments/areas and entrust them with the tasks of preparing the ground\nwork for implementation of the ALM System.\n3. The General Manager in-charge of Funds Management/Treasury may be designated as the 'Nodal\nOfficer' who should be in touch with the RBI (viz. for the present Shri Salim Gangadharan, Deputy\nGeneral Manager, Central DBOD - Telephone Number is 2184936) for clarifications, if any, required in\nregard to the proposed ALM System and guidelines. The name, address and Telephone Number (also\nTelex/Fax Number) of the Nodal Officer may be advised to us immediately.\n4. In order to disseminate and impart knowledge on the subject, it has been decided to hold 2/3 days'\nseminars in Bankers Training College, Mumbai in November 1998 to enable banks to overcome initial\ndifficulties and to implement the system smoothly.\n5. Banks should introduce the proposed ALM System positively from April 1, 1999. We shall be glad to\nreceive feed-back from you on the subject before October 15, 1998. A formal Circular will be issued to\nbanks on the subject some time in January 1999.6. Papers on \"Principles for the Management of Interest Rate Risk\" and \"A Framework for Measuring and\nManaging Liquidity\" issued by the Basle committee on Banking supervision, are enclosed for information\nand guidance of banks.\nYours faithfully,\n(A. Ghosh)\nChief General ManagerASSET - LIABILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN BANKS - GUIDELINES\nOver the last few years the Indian financial markets have witnessed wide ranging changes at fast pace.\nIntense competition for business involving both the assets and liabilities, together with increasing volatility\nin the domestic interest rates as well as foreign exchange rates, has brought pressure on the mangement\nof banks to maintain a good balance among spreads, profitability and long-term viability. These pressures\ncall for structured and comprehensive measures and not just ad hoc action.\nThe Management of banks has to base their business decisions on a dynamic and integrated risk\nmanagement system and process, driven by corporate strategy. Banks are exposed to several major risks\nin the course of their business - credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity/commodity\nprice risk, liquidity risk and operational risks.\n2. This note lays down broad guidelines in respect of interest rate and liquidity risks management\nsystems in banks which form part of the Asset-Liability Management (ALM) function. The initial focus of\nthe ALM function would be to enforce the risk management discipline viz. managing business after\nassessing the risks involved. The objective of good risk management programmes should be that these\nprogrammes will evolve into a strategic tool for bank management.\n3. The ALM process rests on three pillars:\nALM information systems\nManagement Information Systems\nInformation availability, accuracy, adequacy and expediency\nALM organisation\nStructure and responsibilities\nLevel of top management involvement\nALM process\nRisk parameters\nRisk identification\nRisk measurement\nRisk management\nRisk policies and tolerance levels.\n4. ALM Information systems\nInformation is the key to the ALM process. Considering the large network of branches and the lack of an\nadequate system to collect information required for ALM which analyses information on the basis of\nresidual maturity and behavioural pattern it will take time for banks in the present state to get the requisite\ninformation . The problem of ALM needs to be addressed by following an ABC approach i.e. analysing the\nbehaviour of asset and liability products in the top branches accounting for significant busines and then\nmaking rational assumptions about the way in which assets and liabilities would behave in other\nbranches. In respect of foreign exchange, investment portfolio and money market operations, in view of\nthe centralised nature of the fuctions, it would be much easier to collect reliable information. The data and\nassumptions can then be refined over time as the bank management gain experience of conducting\nbusiness within an ALM framework. The spread of computerisation will also help banks in accessing data.5. ALM organisation\n5.1 a) The Board should have overall responsibility for management of risks and should decide the risk\nmanagement policy of the bank and set limits for liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity price\nrisks.\nb) The Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO) consisting of the bank's senior management including CEO\nshould be responsible for ensuring adherence to the limits set by the Board as well as for deciding the\nbusiness strategy of the bank (on the assets and liabilities sides) in line with the bank's budget and\ndecided risk management objectives.\nc) The ALM desk consisting of operating staff should be responsible for analysing, monitoring and\nreporting the risk profiles to the ALCO. The staff should also prepare forecasts (simulations) showing the\neffects of various possible changes in market conditions related to the balance sheet and recommend the\naction needed to adhere to bank's internal limits.\n5.2 The ALCO is a decision making unit responsible for balance sheet planning from risk-return\nperspective including the strategic management of interest rate and liquidity risks. Each bank will have to\ndecide on the role of its ALCO, its responsibility as also the decisions to be taken by it. the business and\nrisk management strategy of the bank should ensure that the bank operates within the limits/parameters\nset by the Board. The business issues that an ALCO would consider, inter alia, will include product pricing\nfor both deposits and advances, desired maturity profile of the incremental assets and liabilities, etc. In\naddition to monitoring the risk levels of the bank, the ALCO should review the results of and progress in\nimplementation of the decisions made in the previous meetings. The ALCO would also articulate the\ncurrent interest rate view of the bank and base its decisions for future business stragtegy on this view. In\nrespect of the funding policy, for instance, its responsibility would be to decide on source and mix of\nliabilities or sale of assets. Towards this end, it will have to develop a view on future direction of interest\nrate movements and decide on a funding mix between fixed vs floating rate funds, wholesale vs retail\ndeposits, money market vs capital market funding, domestic vs foreign currency funding, etc. Individual\nbanks will have to decide the frequency for holding their ALCO meetings.\nTop Management, the CEO/CMD or ED should head the Committee. The Chiefs of Investment, Credit,\nFunds Management/Treasury (forex and domestic), International banking and Economic Research can\nbe members of the Committee. In addition the Head of the Information Technology Division should also\nbe an invitee for building up of MIS and related computerisation. some banks may even have sub-\ncommittees.\n5.4 Committee of Directors\nBanks should also constitute a professional managerial and Supervisory Committee consisting of three to\nfour directors which will oversee the implementation of the system and review its functioning periodically.5.5 ALM process:\nThe scope of ALM function can be described as follows:\nl Liquidity risk management\nl Management of market risks (including Interest Rate Risk)\nl Funding and capital planning\nl Profit planning and growth projection\nl Trading risk management\nThe guidelines given in this note mainly address Liquidity and Interest Rate risks.\n6. Liquidity Risk Management\n6.1 Measuring and managing liquidity needs are vital activities of commercial banks. By assuring a bank's\nability to meet its liabilities as they become due, liquidity management can reduce the probability of an\nadverse situation developing. The importance of liquidity transcends individual institutions, as liquidity\nshortfall in one institution can have repercussions on the entire system. bank management should\nmeasure not only the liquidity positions of banks on an ongoing basis but also examine how liquidity\nrequirements are likely to evolve under crisis scenarios. Experience shows that assets commonly\nconsidered as liquid like Government securities and other money market instruments could also become\nilliquid when the market and players are unidirectional. Therefore liquidity has to be tracked through\nmaturity or cash flow mismatches. For measuring and managing net funding requirements, the use of a\nmaturity ladder and calculation of cumulative surplus or deficit of funds at selected maturity dates is\nadopted as a standard tool. The format of the Statement of Structural Liquidity is given in Annexure I.\n6.2 The Maturity Profile as given in Appendix I could be used for measuring the future cash flows of\nbanks in different time buckets. The time buckets given the Statutory Reserve cycle of 14 days may be\ndistributed as under:\ni) 1 to 14 days\nii) 15 to 28 days\niii) 29 days and upto 3 months\niv) Over 3 months and upto 6 months\nv) Over 6 months and upto 12 months\nvi) Over 1 year and upto 2 years\nvii) Over 2 years and upto 5 years\nviii) Over 5 years\n6.3 Within each time bucket there could be mismatches depending on cash inflows and outflows. While\nthe\n5.3 Composition of ALCO\nThe size (number of members) of ALCO would depend on the size of each institution, business mix and\norganisational complexity. To ensure commitment of the\nmismatches upto one year would be relevant since these provide early warning signals of impending\nliquidity problems, the main focus should be on the short-term mismatches viz., 1-14 days and 15-28\ndays. banks, however, are expected to monitor their cumulative mismatches (running total) across all time\nbuckets by establishing internal prudential limits with the approval of the Board/Management Committee.The mismatch during 1-14 days and 15-28 days should not in any case exced 20% of the cash outflows\nin each time bucket. If a bank in view of its asset - liability profile needs higher tolerance level, it could\noperate with higher limit sanctioned by its Board/Management Committee giving reasons on the need for\nsuch higher limit. A copy of the note approved by Board/Management Committee may be forwarded to\nthe Department of Banking Supervision, RBI. The discretion to allow a higher tolerance level is intended\nfor a temporary period, till the system stabilises and the bank is able to restructure its asset-liability\npattern.\n6.4 The Statement of Structural Liquidity (Annexure I) may be prepared by aplacing all cash inflows and\noutflows in the maturity ladder according to the expected timing of cash flows. A maturing liability will be a\ncash outflow while a maturing asset will be a cash inflow. It would be necessary to take into account the\nrupee inflows and outflows on account of forex operations including the readily available forex resources\n(FCNR (B) funds, etc.) which can be deployed for augmenting rupee resources. While determining the\nlikely cash inflows/outflows, banks have to make a number of assumptions according to their asset -\nliability profiles. For instance, Indian banks with large branch network can (on the stability of their deposit\nbase as most deposits are renewed) afford to have larger tolerance levels in mismatches if their term\ndeposit base is quite high. While determining the tolerance levels the banks may take into account all\nrelevant factors based on their asset-liability base, nature of business, future strategy etc. The RBI is\ninterested in ensuring that the tolerance levels are determined keeping all necessary factors in view and\nfurther refined with experience gained in Liquidity Management.\n6.5 In order to enable the banks to monitor their short-term liquidity on a dynamic basis over a time\nhorizon spanning from 1-90 days, banks may estimate their short-term liquidity profiles on the basis of\nbusiness projections and other commitments. An indicative format (Annexure III) for estimating Short-term\ndynamic Liquidity is enclosed.\n7. Currency Risk\n7.1 Floating exchange rate arrangement has brought in its wake pronounced volatility adding a new\ndimension to the risk profile of banks balance sheets. The increased capital flows across free economies\nfollowing deregulation have contributed to increase in the volume of transactions. Large cross border\nflows together with the volatility has rendered the banks balance sheets vulnerable to exchange rate\nmovements.\n7.2 Dealing in different currencies brings opportunities as also risks. If the liabilities in one currency\nexceed the level of assets in the same currency, then the currency mismatch can add value or erode\nvalue depending upon the currency movements. The simplest way to avoid currency risk is to ensure that\nmismatches, if any, are reduced to zero or near zero. Banks undertake operations in foreign exchange\nlike accepting deposits, making loans and advances and quoting prices for foreign exchange\ntransactions. Irrespective of the strategies adopted, it may not be possible to eliminate currency\nmismatches altogether. Besides, some of the institutions may take proprietary trading positions as a\nconscious business strategy.7.3 Managing Currency risk is one more dimension of Asset - Liability Management. Mismatched\ncurrency position besides exposing the balance sheet to movements in exchange rate also exposes it to\ncountry risk and settlement risk. Ever since the RBI (Exchange Control Department) introduced the\nconcept of end of the day near square position in 1978, banks have been setting up overnight limits and\nselectively undertaking active day time trading. Following the introduction of \"Guidelines for Internal\nControl over Foreign Exchange Business\" in 1981, maturity mismatches (gaps) are also subject to\ncontrol. Following the recommendations of Expert Group on Foreign Exchange Markets in India (Sodhani\nCommittee) the calculation of exchange position has been redefined and banks have been given the\ndiscretion to set up overnight limits linked to maintenance of additional Tier I capital to the extent of 5 per\ncent of open position limit.\n7.4 Presently, the banks are also free to set gap limits with RBI's approval byut are required to adopt\nValue at Risk (VaR) approach to measure the risk associated with forward exposures. Thus the open\nposition limits together with the gap limits form the risk management approach to forex operations. For\nmonitoring such risks banks should follow the instructions contained in Circular A.D (M.A. Series) No. 52\ndated December 27, 1997 issued by the Exchange Control Department.\n8. Interest Rate Risk (IRR)\n8.1 The phased deregulation of interest rates and the operational flexibility given to banks in pricing most\nof the assets and liabilities have exposed the banking system to Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is\nthe risk where changes in market interest rates might adversely affect a bank's financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates affect both the current earnings (earnings perspective) as also the net worth of\nthe bank (economic value perspective). The risk from the earnings perspective can be measured as\nchanges in the Net Interest Income (NII) or Net Interest Margin (NIM). In the context of poor MIS, slow\npace of computerisation in banks and the absence of total deregulation, the traditional Gap analysis is\nconsidered as a suitable method to measure the Interest Rate Risk. It is the intention of RBI to move over\nto modern techniques of Interest Rate Risk measurement like Duration Gap Analysis, simulation and\nValue at Risk at a later date when banks acquire sufficient expertise and sophistication in MIS. The Gap\nor Mismatch risk can be measured by calculating Gaps over different time intervals as at a given date.\nGap analysis measures mismatches between rate sensitive liabilities and rate sensitive assets (including\noff-balance sheet positons).\nii) Over one month and upto 3 months\niii) Over 3 months and upto 6 months\niv) Over 6 months and upto 12 months\nv) Over 1 year and upto 3 years\nvi) Over 3 years and upto 5 years\nvii) Over 5 years\nviii) Non-sensitiveThe various items of rate sensitive assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet may be classified as\nexplained in Appendix-II and the Reporting Format for interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities is given\nin Annexure II.\n8.3 The Gap is the difference between Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) and Rate Sensitive Liabilities (RSL)\nfor each time bucket. The positive Gap indicates that it has more RSAs than RSLs whereas the negative\nGap indicates that it has more RSLs. The Gap reports indicate whether the institution is in a position to\nbenefit from rising interest rates by having a positive Gap (RSA > RSL) or whether it is in a position to\nbenefit from declining interest rates by a negative Gap (RSL > RSA). The Gap can, therefore, be used as\na measure of interest rate sensitivity.\n8.4 Each bank should set prudential limits on individual Gaps with the approval of the Board/Management\nCommittee. The prudential limits should have a bearing on the total assets, earning assets or equity. The\nbanks may work out earnings at risk, based on their views on interest rate movements and fix a prudent\nlevel with the approval of the Board/Management Committee.\n8.5 RBI will also introduce capital adequacy for market risks in due course.\n9. The classification of various components of assets and liabilities into different time buckets for\npreparation of Gap reports (Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity) as indicated in Appendices I & II is the\nbenchmark. Banks which are better equipped to reasonably estimate the behavioural pattern, embedded\noptions, rolls-in and rolls-out, etc. of various components of assets and liabilities on the basis of past\ndata/empirical studies could classify them in the appropriate time buckets, subject to approval from the\nALCO/Board.
