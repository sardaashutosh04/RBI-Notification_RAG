During last two years, the\nhousing sector has emerged as one of the sectors attracting a large quantum of bank\nfinance.  The current focus of RBI's regulation is to ensure orderly growth of housing loan\nportfolio of banks\n2.  DIRECT HOUSING FINANCE\n2.1 Direct Housing Finance refers to the finance provided to individuals or groups of\nindividuals including co-operative societies.\n2.2 Banks are free to evolve their own guidelines with the approval of their Boards on\naspects such as security, margin, age of dwelling units, repayment schedule, etc.\n2.3 Other Guidelines\nThe following types of bank finance may be included under Direct Housing Finance:\n(i) Bank finance extended to a person who is already owning a house in\ntown/village where he resides, for buying/ constructing a second house in\nthe same or other town/ village for the purpose of self occupation.\n(ii) Bank finance extended for purchase of a house by a borrower who proposes\nto let it out on rental basis on account of his posting outside the\nheadquarters or because he has been provided accommodation by his\nemployer.\n(iii) Bank finance extended to a person who proposes to buy an old house where\nhe is presently residing as a tenant.\n(iv) Bank finance granted only for purchase of a plot, provided a declaration is\nobtained from the borrower that he intends to construct a house on the said\nplot, with the help of bank finance or otherwise, within a period of two\nyears from the availment of the said finance.\n(v) Supplementary finance\n(a)Banks may consider requests for additional finance within the overall\nceiling for carrying out alterations/ additions/repairs to the house/flat\nalready financed by them.\n(b)In the case of individuals who might have raised funds for construction/\nacquisition of accommodation from other sources and need\nsupplementary finance, banks may extend such finance after obtaining\npari passu  or second mortgage charge over the property mortgaged in\nfavour of other lenders and/or against such other security, as they may\ndeem appropriate.\n13.INDIRECT HOUSING FINANCE\n3.1 General\nBanks should ensure that their indirect housing finance is channelled by way of term\nloans to housing finance institutions, housing boards, other public housing agencies,\netc., primarily for augmenting the supply of serviced land and constructed units. It\nshould also be ensured that the supply of plots/houses is time bound and public agencies\ndo not utilise the bank loans merely for acquisition of land. Similarly, serviced plots\nshould be sold by these agencies to co-operative societies, professional developers and\nindividuals with a stipulation that the houses should be constructed thereon within a\nreasonable time, not exceeding three years. For this purpose, the banks may take\nadvantage of various guidelines issued by NHB for augmenting the supply of serviced\nland and constructed units.\n3.2 Lending to Housing Intermediary Agencies\n3.2.1 Lending to Housing Finance Institutions\n(i) Banks may grant term loans to housing finance institutions taking in to\naccount(long-term) debt-equity ratio, track record, recovery performance\nand other relevant factors.\n(ii) In terms of NHB guidelines, housing finance companies\u2019 total borrowings,\nwhether by way of deposits, issue of debentures/ bonds, loans and advances\nfrom banks or from financial institutions including any loans obtained from\nNHB, should not exceed 16 times of their net owned funds (i.e. paid-up\ncapital and free reserves less accumulated balance of loss, deferred revenue\nexpenditure and intangible assets).\n(iii) All housing finance companies registered with NHB are eligible to apply\nfor refinance from NHB and will be eligible subject to the refinance policy.\nThe quantum of term loan to be sanctioned to them will not be linked to net\nowned fund as NHB has already prescribed the above referred ceiling on\ntotal borrowing of housing finance companies.  A list of housing finance\ncompanies registered with NHB may be obtained by the banks directly from\nNHB or download from www.nhb.org.in.\n3.2.2 Lending to Housing Boards and Other Agencies\nBanks may extend term loans to state level housing boards and other public\nagencies. However, in order to develop a healthy housing finance system, while\ndoing so, the banks must not only keep in view the past performance of these\nagencies in the matter of recovery from the beneficiaries but they should also\nstipulate that the Boards will ensure prompt and regular recovery of loan\ninstalments from the beneficiaries.\n23.2.3 Financing of Land Acquisition\nIn view of the need to increase the availability of land and house sites for\nincreasing the housing stock in the country, banks may extend finance to public\nagencies for acquisition and development of land, provided it is a part of the\ncomplete project, including development of infrastructure such as water systems,\ndrainage, roads, provision of electricity, etc. Such credit may be extended by way\nof term loans. The project should be completed as early as possible and, in any\ncase, within three years, so as to ensure quick re-cycling of bank funds for\noptimum results. If the project covers construction of houses, credit extended\ntherefor in respect of individual beneficiaries should be on the same terms and\nconditions as stipulated for direct finance.\n3.2.4 Terms and Conditions for Lending to Housing Intermediary Agencies\n(i) In order to enhance the flow of resources to housing sector, term loans may\nbe granted by banks to housing intermediary agencies against the direct\nloans sanctioned/ proposed to be sanctioned by the latter, irrespective of the\nper borrower size of the loan extended by these agencies and such term\nloans would be reckoned for the purpose of achievement of their housing\nfinance allocation.\n(ii) Banks can grant term loans to housing intermediary agencies against the\ndirect loans sanctioned/proposed to be sanctioned by them to Non-Resident\nIndians also. However, banks should ensure that housing finance\nintermediary agencies being financed by them, are authorised by RBI to\ngrant housing loans to NRIs as all housing finance intermediaries are not\nauthorised by RBI to provide housing finance to NRIs. Further, such\nfinance granted by banks to housing finance intermediary agencies against\nthe latters\u2019 on-lending to NRIs will not be treated as housing finance for the\npurpose of scheme of yearly allocation of housing finance applicable to\nbanks.\n(iii) Banks have freedom to charge interest rates to housing intermediary\nagencies without reference to Prime Lending Rate (PLR).\n33.3 Term Loans to Private Builders\nIn view of the important role played by professional builders as providers of\nconstruction services in the housing field, especially where land is acquired and\ndeveloped by State Housing Boards and other public agencies, commercial banks may\nextend credit to private builders on commercial terms by way of loans linked to each\nspecific project. The period of credit for loans extended by banks to private builders\nmay be decided by banks themselves based on their commercial judgement subject to\nusual safeguards and after obtaining such security as banks may deem appropriate. Such\ncredit may be extended to builders of repute, employing professionally qualified\npersonnel. It should be ensured, through close monitoring, that no part of such funds is\nused for any speculation in land. Care should also be taken to see that prices charged\nfrom the ultimate beneficiaries do not include any speculative element, that is, prices\nshould be based only on the documented price of land, the actual cost of construction\nand a reasonable profit margin.\n4.HOUSING LOANS UNDER PRIORITY SECTOR\n4.1 The following housing finance limits will be considered as Priority Sector Advances:\n4.1.1 Direct Finance\n(i) Loans up to Rs. 10 lakh in rural, semi-urban, urban and metropolitan areas\nfor construction of houses by individuals, with the approval of their Boards.\n(ii) Loans up to Rs.1 lakh in rural and semi urban areas and Rs. 2 lakhs in urban\nareas for repairs to damaged houses by individuals.\n4.1.2 Indirect Finance\n(i) Assistance given to any governmental agency for construction of houses, or\nfor slum clearance and rehabilitation of slum dwellers, subject to a ceiling\nof Rs. 5 lakh of loan amount per housing unit.\n(ii) Assistance given to a non-governmental agency approved by the National\nHousing Bank for the purpose of refinance for construction of houses or for\nslum clearance and rehabilitation of slum dwellers, subject to a ceiling of\nRs. 5 lakh of loan amount per housing unit.\n4.1.3 Investments in Bonds\nInvestment by banks in bonds issued by NHB/HUDCO exclusively for financing\nof housing, irrespective of the loan size per dwelling unit will be reckoned for\ninclusion under priority sector advances.\n5.RBI REFINANCE\nFinance provided by the banks would not be eligible for refinance from Reserve Bank.\n46. CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR BANK CREDIT\n6.1Banks should not grant finance for construction of buildings meant purely for\nGovernment/Semi-Government offices, including Municipal and Panchayat offices.\nHowever, banks may grant loans for activities, which will be refinanced by institutions like\nNABARD.\n6.2Projects undertaken by public sector entities which are not corporate bodies (i.e. public\nsector undertakings which are not registered under Companies Act or which are not\ncorporations established under the relevant statute) may not be financed by banks. Even in\nrespect of projects undertaken by corporate bodies, as defined above, banks should satisfy\nthemselves that the project is run on commercial lines and that bank finance is not in lieu of\nor to substitute budgetary resources envisaged for the project. The loan could, however,\nsupplement budgetary resources if such supplementing was contemplated in the project\ndesign. Thus, in the case of a housing project, where the project is run on commercial lines,\nand the Government is interested in promoting the project either for the benefit of the weaker\nsections of the society or otherwise, and a part of the project cost is met by the Government\nthrough subsidies made available and/or contributions to the capital of the institutions taking\nup the project, the bank finance should be restricted to an amount arrived at after reducing\nfrom the total project cost the amount of subsidy/capital contribution receivable from the\nGovernment and any other resources proposed to be made available by the Government\n6.3Banks had, in the past, sanctioned term loans to corporations set up by Government like State\nPolice Housing Corporation, for construction of residential quarters for allotment to\nemployees where the loans were envisaged to be repaid out of budgetary allocations. As\nthese projects cannot be considered to be run on commercial lines, it would not be in order\nfor banks to grant loans to such projects\n7.REPORTING\n7.1 Banks should compile the data relating to Housing Finance at half-yearly intervals on the\nlines of format given in Annexure 1  and keep it ready for being made available to the\nbank\u2019s internal inspectors/RBI\u2019s inspectors.\n7.2 For the purpose of monitoring the macro-level performance of the commercial banks in\ndisbursement of housing finance banks should submit, on a quarterly basis, details of\ndisbursements made by them towards housing finance, as per the format given in Annexure\n2 within 20 days from the close of the respective quarter.\n7.3 Housing loans taken over from other banks should not be included in the quarterly\nstatement as disbursements.\n58.OPENING OF SPECIALISED HOUSING FINANCE BRANCHES\n8.1 In view of the priority accorded to the development of housing as also to achieve\ngreater professionalism, there is a need for establishment of specialised branches at\ncertain centres exclusively to cater to housing finance. It is the intention that a housing\nfinance branch should be established in each district. But this can be brought about\ngradually based on the policies and perceptions for greater involvement of commercial\nbanks in the housing sector.\n8.2 Since the housing finance is a new concept to banks, initially the opening of such\nspecialised branches may be restricted to semi-urban/urban areas and the number of\nsuch branches to be allowed will depend on the size and spread of the bank. Requests\nfor this kind of branch in rural area will also be considered where there is a clear need\nand assured viability. While formulating their proposals, banks may, therefore, keep in\nview the following aspects for consideration:\n8.2.1 The housing finance branch of a bank should be in any of the districts for which\nthe bank has lead responsibility or, in the case of banks having very nominal lead\nresponsibility, in districts where they have a large presence.\n8.2.2 Banks should avoid opening of such housing finance branches at metropolitan\ncentres which are served by quite a few specialised housing finance companies\nlike HDFC or housing finance subsidiaries of the commercial banks.\n8.2.3 The housing finance branches may be set up in areas where there is a\nconcentration of branches of the same bank designated to handle housing finance\nbusiness so that the expertise available in the specialised branch could be used\nfor servicing the other designated branches.\n8.2.4 While formulating their proposals, banks should, as far as possible, give\npreference to smaller urban and semi-urban centres where there is enough\npotential for opening of such branches.\n8.2.5 The proposals should cover all the states to ensure a wider geographical\ndispersion of housing finance branches.\n8.2.6 The applicant bank should also explore the feasibility of converting any of its\nloss-making branches at the centre into a proposed housing finance branch. Apart\nfrom this, banks could designate one of their branches in each district for the\npurpose of housing finance in addition to their normal banking functions. The\navailability of housing finance services at specialised branches should also be\nwidely publicised.\n8.2.7 In the interest of effecting economy in expenditure, the proposed housing finance\nbranches, as far as possible, may be accommodated in any of the existing\npremises of the bank at the centre.\n8.2.8 Banks may also indicate the existing construction activities, likely development\nin the business, their involvement in financing such projects/ construction work\n(whether in consortium or individual basis) at the centre.\n8.2.9 National Housing Bank will be prepared to take up the task of training the staff\nto be posted in the specialised housing finance branches so that they are equipped\nwith the necessary skills for the work.\n68.3 Banks should send to Reserve Bank (Department of Banking Operations and\nDevelopment), a list of centres where they would like to open specialised branches\nindicating the order of preference along with information in the proforma given in\nAnnexure 3 .\n9.HOME LOAN ACCOUNT SCHEME (HLAS) OF NHB\n9.1 Foreclosure of Loans Obtained from Other Sources\n9.1.1 Under the HLAS, a member of HLAS is eligible for a loan after subscription to\nthe scheme for a minimum period of 5 years. The member has to declare while\njoining the scheme/availing loan that he/ she does not own a house/flat.\nHowever, a member may acquire a house or a flat from a public agency/co-\noperative/ private builder by obtaining a loan from a bank at the normal rate of\ninterest or from friends and relatives or through a hire-purchase scheme of\nHousing Board/ Development Authority. Thereafter, when the member becomes\neligible for a loan under HLAS, he/she may approach the bank for such a loan to\nrepay the loan(s) raised earlier from other sources.\n9.1.2 There is no objection to bank loans under HLAS being utilised for foreclosing\nloans secured earlier from other sources, as a special case.\n9.2 Classification of Deposits/Loans under HLAS\nUnder HLAS, the participating bank is required to accept deposits on behalf of NHB\nand make use of these deposits by way of refinance under any scheme approved by\nNHB from time to time. The surplus funds, if any, not so utilised (i.e. excess of deposits\nover refinance) can either be remitted by the participating bank to NHB or retained by\nit, subject to compliance with the statutory reserve requirements as under:\n(i) The deposits under the HLA Scheme are on a recurring basis; and they\nshould be treated as \u2018time\u2019 liabilities, subject to reserve requirements under\nSection 42(1) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 as also under Section\n24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and included under item II (a) (ii)\nof Form \u2018A\u2019.\n(ii) In terms of sub-clause (ii) of clause (c) of the Explanation to Sub-Section\n(1) of Section 42 of the RBI Act, as amended by clause 3 of the Second\nSchedule to the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, \u2018liabilities\u2019 will not\ninclude any loan taken from NHB. Hence, the deposits utilised as refinance\nfrom NHB should be deducted from the total deposits received under the\nHLA Scheme while including the amount under item II (a) (ii) of Form \u2018A\u2019.\n710.RISK WEIGHT ON HOUSING FINANCE\nWith a view to further improve the flow of credit to the housing sector it has been decided to\nliberalise the prudential requirement on risk weight for housing finance by banks and\nencourage investments by banks in Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) of Housing Finance\nCompanies (HFCs) which are registered and supervised by NHB. Accordingly, banks\nextending housing loans to individuals against the mortgage of residential housing properties\nwould be permitted to assign risk weight of 50% instead of the existing 100%. Loans against\nthe security of commercial real estate would continue to attract 100% risk weight as hitherto.\nThe investments in MBS of residential assets of HFCs would be eligible for risk weight of\n50% for the purpose of Capital Adequacy.\n11.TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR BANKS\u2019 INVESTMENT IN MORTGAGE\nBACKED SECURITIES (MBS)\n11.1 Banks\u2019 investments in MBS should satisfy the following terms and conditions:\n(a) The right, title, and interest of an HFC in securitised housing loans and receivables\nthere under should irrevocably be assigned in favour of a Special Purpose Vehicle\n(SPV) / Trust.\n(b) Mortgaged securities underlying the securitised housing loans should be held\nexclusively on behalf of and for the benefit of the investors by the SPV/Trust.\n(c) The SPV or Trust should be entitled to the receivables under the securitised loans with\nan arrangement for distribution of the same to the investors as per the terms of the issue\nof MBS. Such an arrangement may provide for appointment of the originating HFC as\nthe servicing and paying agent. However, the originating HFC participating in a\nsecuritisation transaction as a seller, manager, servicer or provider of credit\nenhancement of liquidity facilities.\n(i) shall not own any share capital in the SPV or be the beneficiary of the Trust used\nas a vehicle for the purchase and securitisation of assets. Share capital for this\npurpose shall include all classes of common and preferred share capital.\n(ii) Shall not name the SPV in such manner as to imply any connection with the\nbank.\n(iii) Shall not have any directors, officers, or employees on the board of the SPV\nunless the board is made of at least three members and where there is a majority\nof independent directors. In addition, the official (s) representing the bank will\nnot have veto powers.\n(iv) Shall not directly or indirectly control the SPV, or\n(v) Shall not support any losses arising from the securitisation transaction or by\ninvestors involved in it or bear any of the recurring expenses of the transaction.\n(d) The loans to be securitised should be loans advanced to individuals for acquiring\n/constructing residential houses which should have been mortgaged to the HFC by way\nof exclusive first charge.\n8(e) The loans to be securitised should be accorded an investment grade credit rating by any\nof the credit rating agencies at the time of assignment to the SPV.\n(f) The investors should be entitled to call upon the issuer-SPV-to take steps for recovery\nin the event of default and distribute the net proceeds to the investors as per the terms of\nissue of MBS.\n(g) The SPV undertaking the issue of MBS should not be engaged in any business other\nthan the business of issue and administration of MBS of individual housing loans.\n(h) The SPV or Trustees appointed to manage the issue of MBS should have to be\ngoverned by the provisions of Indian Trust Act, 1882.\n11.2 If the issue of MBS is in accordance with the terms and conditions stated in above\nparagraph and includes irrevocable transfer of risk and reward of housing loan assets to\nthe Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) / Trust, investment in such MBS by any bank would\nnot be reckoned as an exposure on the HFC originating the securitised housing loan.\nHowever, it would be treated as an exposure on the underlying assets of the SPV/ Trust.\n9Annexure 1\nMaster Circular\nHOUSING FINANCE\n(Vide paragraph 7.1)\nFinancial assistance granted by scheduled commercial banks under the\ncategory 'Housing Finance' as on September 30,        /March 31,_____\nFor use of RBI\n1.

The total investments of a co-operative bank in the shares of co-operative institutions,\nother than those falling under any of the categories stated at paras 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 above,\nshall not exceed 2 per cent of its owned funds (paid-up share capital and reserves).\n1.2.2 The investment of a bank in the shares of any one co-operative institution coming under\npara 1.2.1 above shall not exceed 5 per cent of the subscribed capital of that institution.\nNote: When more than one co-operative bank contributes to the shares in a co-operative\nsociety falling under category under para 1.2.1, the limit of 5 per cent of the subscribed capital\nindicated above should apply not in respect of the investment of each of the banks but in respect\nof the investment of all the banks taken together. In other words, the total investment of all the co-\noperative banks should be limited to 5 per cent of the subscribed capital of the enterprise\nconcerned.\nA co-operative bank should offer to make its contribution to the shares of a co-operative society\ncoming under para 1.2.1 above only if the by-laws of the recipient society provide for the\nretirement of share capital contributed by it.\n1.2.3 The retirement of the share capital contributed by a bank to the shares of any society\ncoming under para 1.2.1 above should be completed in 10 equal annual instalments commencingfrom the co-operative year immediately following the year in which the concern commences\nbusiness or production.\n1.2.4 A co-operative bank should not, except with the permission of the Reserve Bank, contribute\nto the share capital of a society coming under category para 1.2.1 above, if it is situated outside\nits area of operation.\n1.2.5 Provided that the above restrictions will not apply to holdings by co-operative banks of\nshares in non-profit making co-operative societies such as those formed for the protection of\nmutual interests, (e.g. co-operative banks' association) or for the promotion of co-operative\neducation etc. (e.g. state co-operative union), or housing co-operatives for the purpose of\nacquiring premises on ownership basis, etc.\n2. MANDATORY INVESTMENTS\n2.1 Need for Mandatory Investments\n2.1.1 In terms of provisions of Section 24 of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, (As applicable to\nco-operative societies), every primary (urban) co-operative bank is required to maintain liquid\nassets which at the close of business on any day should not be less than 25 percent of its time\nand demand liabilities in India (in addition to the minimum cash reserves requirement).\n2.1.2 The banks may hold such liquid assets in the form of cash, gold or unencumbered approved\nsecurities.\n2.1.3 \u2018approved securities\u2019 as defined by Section 5(a) (i) & (ii) of the Banking Regulation Act,\n1949 (AACS) mean -\n i.

Scheduled banks 25%\n2. Non-Scheduled banks\na) with NDTL of Rs.25 crore &\nabove\n1. b) with\nNDTL of\nless\nthan\nRs.25\ncrore \n15%\n\u2022  \u2022  10%\n2.2 Manner of Holding Mandatory Investments\n2.2.1 The Securities may be held in either of the three forms viz: (a) Physical scrip form, (b)\nSubsidiary General Ledger (SGL) Account. In respect of securities with SGL facility, the SGL\naccount can be maintained in the bank's own name directly with the Reserve Bank of India, or in\na Constituents SGL Account opened with any scheduled commercial bank/state co-operative\nbank/primary dealer (PD) or Stock holding Corporation of India Ltd. (SHCIL), or (c) in a\ndematerialised account with depositories (NSDL/CDSL, NSCCL).\n2.2.2 Both scheduled & non-scheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks with NDTL of Rs.25\ncrores & above are required to maintain investments in government securities only in SGLAccounts with Reserve Bank of India or in Constituent SGL Accounts with PDs, scheduled\ncommercial banks, state co-operative banks, depositories and SHCIL.\n3 INVESTMENT POLICY\n3.1 Keeping in view the various regulatory/statutory and the bank's own internal requirements,\nprimary (urban) co-operative banks should lay down, with the approval of their Board of Directors,\nthe broad Investment Policy and objectives to be achieved while undertaking investment\ntransactions. The investment policy should be reviewed each year. The Board/Committee/Top\nManagement should actively oversee investment transactions. Banks should not undertake any\ntransactions on behalf of Portfolio Management Scheme (PMS) clients in their fiduciary capacity,\nand on behalf of other clients, either as custodians of their investments or purely as their agents.\n3.2 The bank\u2019s investment policy should clearly -\n3.2.1 define the authority to put through deals,\n3.2.2 procedure to be followed for obtaining sanction of the appropriate authority,\n3.2.3 procedure to be followed while putting through deals,\n3.2.4 various prudential exposure limits, and\n3.2.5 reporting system.\n3.3 The investment policy of the bank should include guidelines on the quantity (ceiling) and\nquality of each type of security to be held on its own investment account. Bank should clearly\nindicate the authority to put through investment deals and the reporting system to be adopted. It\nshould be prepared strictly observing the instructions issued by the Registrar of Co-operative\nSocieties and the Reserve Bank of India from time to time and clearly spell out the internal control\nmechanism, accounting standards, audit, review and reporting system to be evolved.\n3.4 All the transactions should be clearly recorded indicating full details. The top management\nshould undertake a periodical review of investment transactions in a critical manner and put up\nlarge transactions to the Board, for information.\n3.5 A copy of the internal investment policy guidelines framed by the banks with the approval of\ntheir Boards should be forwarded to the concerned Regional Office of the RBI, certifying that the\npolicy is in accordance with the prescribed guidelines and the same has been put in place.\nSubsequent changes, if any, in the Investment Policy should also be advised to the Regional\nOffice of the RBI.\n4 GENERAL GUIDELINES/PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED WHILE UNDERTAKING\nSECURITY TRANSACTIONS\n4.1 Primary (urban) co-operative banks should not undertake any purchase/sale transactions with\nbroking firms or other intermediaries on principal to principal basis.\n4.2 Banks should seek a scheduled commercial bank, a primary dealer, a financial institution,\nanother primary (urban) co-operative bank, insurance company, mutual funds or provident fund,\nas a counter-party for their transactions. Preference should be given for direct deals with such\ncounter parties. It will be desirable to check prices from the other banks or PDs with whom the\nprimary (urban) co-operative bank may be maintaining constituent SGL Account (CSGL). The\nprices of all trades done in government securities, including those traded through Negotiated\nDealing System, are also available at RBI website (www.rbi.org.in).\n4.3 Banks may take advantage of the non-competitive bidding facility in the auction of\nGovernment of India dated securities, provided by RBI. Under this scheme, primary (urban) co-\noperative banks may bid upto Rs.two crore (face value) in any auction of Government of India\ndated securities, either directly or through a bank or through a primary dealer. For availing this\nfacility, no bidding skill is required, as allotment upto Rs. two crores (face value) is made at the\nweighted average cut-off rate which emerges in the auction. Primary (urban) co-operative banks\nmay also participate directly or through a bank or a primary dealer in the auctions of state\ndevelopment loans, where coupon is mostly fixed in advance and notified by RBI. An\nadvertisement in leading newspapers is issued 4-5 days in advance of the date of auction. Half\nyearly auction calendar of Government of India securities is also issued by RBI.\n4.4 CSGL Accounts should be used for holding the securities and such accounts should be\nmaintained in the same bank with whom the cash account is maintained. For all transactions\ndelivery versus payment must be insisted upon by the banks\n4.5 In case CSGL account is opened with any of the non-banking institutions indicated above, the\nparticulars of the designated funds account (with a bank) should be intimated to that institution.4.6 All transactions must be monitored to see that delivery takes place on settlement day. The\nfund account and investment account should be reconciled on the same day before close of\nbusiness.\n4.7 Officials deciding about purchase and sale transactions should be separate from those\nresponsible for settlement and accounting.\n4.8 All investment transactions should be perused by the Board at least once a month.\n4.9 The banks may keep a proper record of the SGL forms received/issued to facilitate counter-\nchecking by their internal control systems/RBI inspectors/other auditors.\n4.10 All purchase/sale transactions in Government securities by the primary (urban) co-operative\nbanks should necessarily be through SGL account (with RBI) or constituent SGL account (with a\nscheduled commercial bank/state co-operative bank/primary dealer/Stock Holding Corporation of\nIndia) or in a dematerialised account with depositories (NSDL/CDSL/NSCCL).\n4.11 No transactions in Government securities by a primary (urban) co-operative bank should be\nundertaken in physical form with any broker.\n4.12 In addition to one SGL/CSGL Account, banks may also open a demat account with a bank\ndepository participant of NSDL/CDSL or with SHCIL for holding PSU Bonds.\n4.13 The entities maintaining the CSGL/designated funds accounts are required to ensure\navailability of clear funds in the designated funds accounts for purchases and of sufficient\nsecurities in the CSGL account for sales before putting through the transactions.\n14. The security dealings of banks generally being for large values, it may be necessary to\nensure, before concluding the deal, the ability of the counter-party to fulfil the contract,\nparticularly where the counter-party is not a bank.\n15. While buying securities for SLR purposes, the bank should ensure from the counter\nparties that the bonds it intend to purchase is and would continue to have SLR status.\nThe bank should also verify this from independent sources in case of doubt.\n16. While investing in long term debt instruments, the banks should thoroughly satisfy\nthemselves about the terms & conditions of issue, namely payment of interest and\nrepayment of principal, and ensure that there are no clauses permitting the issuer for\nrescheduling such repayments.\n17. In order to avoid concentration of risk, the banks should have a fairly diversified\ninvestment portfolio. Smaller investment portfolios should preferably be restricted to\nsecurities with high safety and liquidity such as Government security.\n4.18 The primary (urban) co-operative banks may seek the guidance of Primary Dealer's\nAssociation of India/Fixed Income and Money Market Dealers' Association (FIMMDA) on\ninvestment in Government Securities.\n5. NON-SLR INVESTMENTS\n5.1 Holding Shares & Debentures in Private Sector Companies or Institutions other than\nCo-operative Sector\nThe primary (urban) co-operative banks should not  subscribe to the initial or subsequent issue of\nshares/debentures of private sector companies or bodies or organisations other than in co-\noperative sector unless specifically permitted by the Reserve Bank.\n5.2 Deposits with other institutions and other primary (urban) co-operative banks\n5.2.1 Primary (urban) co-operative banks should not park their funds as deposits with other\ninstitutions/companies/corporations etc. Keeping of term deposits with other\ninstitutions/companies amounts to granting of unsecured advances to such institutions, thereby,\nattracting the provisions of directives on maximum limits on advances/exposure norms.\n5.2.2 A scheduled primary (urban) co-operative bank should not place deposits with any other\nprimary (urban) co-operative bank.\n5.2.3 Non-scheduled primary (urban)co-operative banks may place deposits with strong\nscheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks, fulfilling following norms:\n i. The bank is complying with the prescribed level of CRAR. ii. Net NPAs of the bank is less than 7%\n iii. The bank has not defaulted in the maintenance of CRR/SLR requirements for the last two\nyears.\n iv. The bank has declared net profits for the last three consecutive years.\n v. The bank has earned \u2018A\u2019 rating from Co-operative Auditors for the last three consecutive\nyears.\n vi. The bank is complying with prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification\nand provisioning, exposure ceilings and loans & advances to directors.\n5.2.4 Acceptance of deposits from non-scheduled banks by the schedule banks will be subject to\nthe following conditions:\n i. The total of all such deposits accepted by a scheduled bank should not exceed 10% of its\ndeposit liabilities as on 31 March of the previous financial year.\n ii. The rate of interest offered on such deposits should be market related.\n iii. The total amount of deposits placed by a non-scheduled primary (urban) co-operative\nbank with a scheduled bank should not exceed 20% of its capital funds so as to be in\nconsonance with the extant exposure norms. Capital funds for this purpose would\ncomprise of paid up capital and free reserves as per audited accounts. Reserves, if any,\ncreated out of revaluation of fixed assets or those created to meet outside liabilities\nshould not be included in the capital funds. While free reserves may include \u2018building\nfund\u2019, it shall exclude all reserves/provisions, which are created to meet anticipated loan\nlosses, losses on account of frauds etc., depreciation in investments and other assets\nand outside liabilities.\n5.2.5 Primary (urban) co-operative banks may, however, maintain balances in the current\naccounts with other banks for meeting their clearing and remittance requirements.\n5.3 Investment of Funds in Public Sector Undertakings/Companies\n5.3.1 Normally the deposit resources of the co-operative sector should remain within the co-\noperative fold. However, the primary (urban) co-operative banks are allowed to invest their\nsurplus funds up to 10% of their deposits in:-\n1. Bonds of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs),\n2. Infrastructure bonds floated by the financial institutions, such as, IDBI, LIC, GIC etc.\n3. Unsecured redeemable bonds floated by the nationalised banks,\n4. Equity/Bonds of all India financial institutions.\n5. Units of UTI upto 5% of their incremental deposits of the previous year but within the\noverall ceiling of 10% of their deposits.\n5.3.2 These investments may be made subject to the following conditions/safety measures:\n5.3.2.1 A provision should exist for such investments in respective State Co-operative Societies\nAct/Multi State Co-operative Societies Act and a general or specific permission should be\nobtained from the Registrar of Co-operative Societies of the concerned State.\n2. Banks should comply with the instructions regarding investment policy and the dealings\nin securities transactions.\n5.3.2.3 There should be no default by the banks in maintenance of statutory cash reserve and\nliquid assets requirements as prescribed by the Reserve Bank Act, 1934/Banking Regulation Act,\n1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies).4. Banks should have achieved the targets fixed by the Reserve Bank from time to time for\nlending to priority sectors/weaker sections.\n5.3.2.5 Overdues of banks should not be more than 15% of their outstanding loans and\nadvances.\n5.3.2.6 Banks should comply with the Reserve Bank instructions regarding non-performing\nassets, income recognition, assets classification and provisioning.\n7. Banks should formulate Investment Policy, as approved by their Board of Directors, for\ninvestments in PSUs bonds including norms to ensure that there is no excessive\ninvestment in one or two public sector bonds and that such investments are well spread.\nThe banks should assess the soundness of the investment relative to pricing, maturity\nrate, security, liquidity and yield, etc. while investing in PSUs bonds. The banks should\nalso keep in mind that necessary depreciation will have to be fully provided for in the\nInvestment Depreciation Reserve against the erosion of value.\n8. While investing in non SLR securities, the banks should take abundant precaution to\nsatisfy themselves about the financial position of the entity issuing the securities. The\nbanks may take a decision regarding investments, keeping in view the audited balance\nsheet of the issuer, the rating accorded to it by a recognised credit rating agency etc.\n5.4 Investment in Certificates of Deposits (CDs)\n5.4.1 Primary (urban) co-operative banks are permitted to make investments in CDs issued by\nscheduled commercial banks and other financial institutions approved by the Reserve Bank,\nsubject to fulfilment of the following conditions:\n2. The banks should have reached the level stipulated by the Reserve Bank for lendings to\npriority sector at the time of making investment in CDs.\n3. The banks should, with the approval of their Board of Directors, evolve policy guidelines\ngoverning their investments and obtain the approval of their Boards for placing funds in\nCDs.\n4. The investments in CDs should not result in resource crunch necessitating borrowings\nfrom higher financing agencies. In other words, the banks should not resort to borrowings\nfrom higher financing agencies while making investments in CDs, excepting for\ntemporary periods to meet exigencies. It should, however, be ensured that the\nborrowings are need-based and cost-effective.\n5. The banks should have achieved the requisite level of investments in Government and\nother approved securities.\n6 INVESTMENT TRADING ACTIVITIES\n6.1 Dealing through Brokers\n6.1.1 The inter-bank securities transactions should be undertaken directly between banks and no\nbank should engage the services of any broker in such transactions. Banks may, however,\nundertake securities transactions among themselves or with non-bank clients through members\nof the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE)/OTC Exchange\nwherein the transactions are transparent. In case any transactions in securities are not\nundertaken on NSE, OTC Exchange of India or the Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE), the same\nshould be undertaken by the banks directly without the use of brokers.\n2. Purchase of permissible shares and PSU bonds in the secondary market (other than\ninter-bank transactions) should be only through recognised stock exchanges and\nregistered stock brokers.\n6.1.3 The Discount and Finance House of India Ltd. (DFHI) has been permitted to operate as a\nbroker in the inter-bank participation market. This would enable the banks to seek intermediation\nof DFHI for borrowing/lending, if required. However, the banks shall be free to settle transactions\nin the inter-bank participations market directly, if so desired.4. It should be ensured that the applications of the banks in respect of their own\nsubscription to Central/State Government loans are submitted directly to the receiving\noffices of the RBI/State Bank of India and intermediaries or brokers should not be used\nfor the purpose.\n5. Similarly, where the investments are made by the banks on account of their clients, the\nrelative applications bearing the bank\u2019s own stamps should be tendered direct to the\nreceiving offices.\n6.1.6 If a deal is put through with the help of a broker, the role of the broker should be restricted\nto that of bringing the two parties to the deal together.\n6.1.7 Disclosure of counter party should be insisted upon on conclusion of the deal put through\nbrokers.\n8. Contract confirmation from the counter party should be insisted upon.\n9. The brokers should not be involved in settlement process at all i.e. both the fund\nsettlement and delivery of security should be done with the counter party directly.\n6.2 Empanelment of Brokers\n6.2.1 The banks should prepare a panel of brokers with the approval of their Board of Directors.\n2. Brokers should be empanelled after verifying their credentials e.g. :\n1. SEBI registration\n2. Membership of BSE/NSE/OTCEI for debt market.\n6.2.2.3 Market turnover in the preceding year as certified by the Exchange/s.\n6.2.2.4 Market reputation etc.\n6.2.3 The bank should check websites of SEBI/respective exchanges, to ensure that the broker\nhas not been put in the banned list.\n6.3 Broker Limits\n6.3.1 A disproportionate part of the business should not be transacted through only one or a few\nbrokers. Banks should consider fixing aggregate contract limits for each of the approved brokers,\nand ensure that these limits are not exceeded. A record of broker-wise details of deals put\nthrough and brokerage paid should be maintained.\n2. A limit of 5% of total transactions (both purchases and sales) entered into by the banks\nduring a year should be treated as the aggregate upper contract limit for each of the\napproved brokers.\n3. This limit should cover both the business initiated by the bank and the business\noffered/brought to the bank by a broker.\n4. For fixing broker limits, financial year should be preferred. However, the banks may follow\ncalendar year or any other period of 12 months, provided it is consistently followed in\nfuture.\n5. The limit should be observed with reference to the year under review. While operating the\nlimit, the banks should keep in view the expected turnover of the current year which may\nbe based on turnover of the previous year and anticipated rise or fall in the volume of\nbusiness in the current year.\n6. To arrive at total transactions of the year, the transactions entered into directly with\ncounter-parties i.e. where no brokers are involved should not be taken into account.\n7. In case of ready-forward deals, both the legs of the deals i.e. purchase as well as sale\nshould be included to arrive at the volume of total transactions.8. Central loan/State loan/treasury bills, etc. purchased through direct subscriptions/auction\nshould not be included in the volume of total transactions.\n9. Transactions conducted on behalf of the clients should also be included in the total\ntransactions of the year, if they are conducted through the brokers.\n10. It should be ensured that the transactions entered through individual brokers during a\nyear normally do not exceed the prescribed limit. However, if it becomes necessary to\nexceed the aggregate limit for any broker, the specific reasons, therefor, should be\nrecorded in writing by the authority empowered to put through the deals. In such cases,\npost-facto approval of the Board may be obtained after explaining the circumstances in\nwhich the limit was exceeded.\n11. It may be desirable to have periodical review of broker\u2019s performance and relationships,\nnot to allow direct settlements by the dealers with the counter-party/banks.\n7 SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS\n7.1 SGL Account\n7.1.1 Transfers through SGL accounts by the banks having SGL facility can be made only if they\nmaintain a regular current account with the Reserve Bank. All transactions in Government\nsecurities for which SGL facility is available, should be put through SGL accounts only.\n7.1.2 Before issue of SGL transfer forms covering the sale transactions, banks should ensure that\nthey have sufficient balance in the respective SGL accounts. Under no circumstances, an SGL\ntransfer form issued by a bank in favour of another bank should bounce for want of sufficient\nbalance in the SGL account. The purchasing bank should issue the cheques only after receipt of\nthe SGL transfer forms from the selling bank.\n3. If the SGL transfer form bounces for want of sufficient balance in the SGL Account, the\nbank which has issued the form will be liable for the following penal action:\n7.1.3.1 The amount of SGL form (cost of purchase paid by the purchaser of the security) will be\ndebited immediately to the current account of the selling bank with the Reserve Bank.\n7.1.3.2 In the event of an overdraft arising in the current account following such a debit, penal\ninterest will be charged by the Reserve Bank on the amount of the overdraft at a rate 3% points\nabove the Discount and Finance House of India\u2019s call money lending rate on the day in question.\n7.1.3.3 If the bouncing of the SGL form occurs thrice, the bank will be debarred from trading with\nthe use of the SGL facility for a period of 6 months from the date of occurrence of the third\nbouncing. If after restoration of the facility, any SGL form of the bank bounces again, the bank will\nbe permanently debarred from the use of the SGL facility in all the PDOs of the Reserve Bank.\n7.2 SGL Forms\n1. The SGL transfer forms should be in the standard format prescribed by the Reserve Bank\nand printed on semi-security paper of uniform size. These should be serially numbered\nand there should be a control system in place to account for each SGL form.\n2. SGL transfer forms should be signed by two authorised officials of the bank whose\nsignatures should be recorded with the respective Public Debt Office (PDO) of Reserve\nBank and other banks.\n3. The SGL transfer form received by the purchasing bank should be deposited in its SGL\naccount immediately. No sale should be effected by way of return of SGL transfer form\nheld by the bank.\n4. Any bouncing of SGL transfer forms issued by selling bank in favour of the buying bank\nshould immediately be brought to the notice of the Reserve Bank by the buying bank.\n7.3 Control, Violation and Penalty Provisions\n7.3.1 Record of SGL transfer forms issued/received should be maintained. Balances as per the\nbank\u2019s books in respect of SGL accounts should be reconciled with the balances in the books ofPDOs. The concerned PDO will forward a monthly statement of balances of SGL/CSGL account\nto all account holders. Primary (urban) co-operative banks having SGL/CSGL accounts with\nPDOs may use these statements for the purpose of monthly reconciliation of their SGL/CSGL\nbalances as per their books and the position in this regard should be placed before the Audit\nCommittee of the Board. This reconciliation should also be periodically checked by the internal\naudit department. A system for verification of the authenticity of the SGL transfer forms received\nfrom other banks and confirmation of authorised signatories should be put in place.\n2. Banks should also forward a quarterly certificate to the concerned PDO, indicating that\nthe balances held in the SGL accounts with the PDO have been reconciled and that it\nhas been placed before the Audit Committee of the Board. A copy thereof should be sent\nto the concerned Regional Office of the Urban Banks Department.\n3. Banks should put in place a system to report to the top management on a monthly basis\nthe details of transactions in securities, details of bouncing of SGL transfer forms issued\nby other banks and review of investment transactions undertaken during the period.\n4. All promissory notes, debentures, shares, bonds, etc. should be properly recorded and\nheld under joint custody. A separate register may be maintained to record the particulars\nof securities taken out/re-lodged. These should be subjected to periodical verification say\nonce in a quarter or half-year, by persons unconnected with their custody.\n7.3.5 Certificates should be obtained at quarterly/half-yearly intervals in respect of securities\nlodged with other institutions. Similarly, it is necessary to reconcile the outstanding BRs with the\ncounter-party at monthly intervals and reconciliation of SGL Account balance with the PDO at\nmonthly intervals.\n7.3.6 The internal inspectors and concurrent auditors should peruse the transactions to ensure\nthat the deals have been undertaken in the best interest of the bank. The Vigilance Cell should\nalso make surprise sample checks of large transactions.\n7.3.7 The concurrent auditors should certify that investments held by the bank, as on the last\nreporting Friday of each quarter and as reported to RBI, are actually owned/held by it as\nevidenced by the physical securities or the outstandings statement. Such a certificate should be\nsubmitted to the Regional Office of Urban Banks Department having jurisdiction over the bank,\nwithin 30 days from the end of the relative quarter.\n7.4 Settlement in respect of Government Securities Transactions \u2013 Compulsory settlement\nthrough Clearing Corporation of India Ltd .\n7.4.1 Reserve Bank of India has extended to all market participants the facility of settlement in\nGovernment Securities transactions over NDS - CCIL System besides the settlement under\nDelivery vs. Payment system. With effect from 1st April, 2003, all Government Securities\ntransactions (both outright and Repo) are being settled compulsorily  through Clearing Corporation\nof India Ltd. (CCIL) only. Any transactions in Govt. Securities for settlement by the banks outside\nthe NDS-CCIL system are not being entertained by Reserve Bank of India since that date.\n7.4.2 Primary (urban) co-operative banks which are not a member of NDS-CCIL system, should\nundertake their transactions in Government securities through gilt account/demat account\nmaintained with a Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) member.\n7.5 Bank Receipts (BRs)\n7.5.1  When to use BRs\n7.5.1.1 No BR should be issued under any circumstances in respect of transactions in\nGovernment securities for which SGL facility is available.\n2. Even in the case of other securities, BR may be issued for ready transactions only, under\nthe following circumstances:\n(a) The scrips are yet to be issued by the issuer and the bank is holding the allotment\nadvice.\n(b) The security is physically held at a different centre and the bank is in a position to\nphysically transfer the security and give delivery thereof, within a short period.(c) The security has been lodged for transfer/interest payment and the bank is holding\nnecessary records of such lodgements and will be in a position to give physical delivery\nof the security within a short period.\n3. No BR should be issued on the basis of a BR held by the bank and no transaction should\ntake place on the basis of mere exchange of BRs held by the bank.\n4. BRs may be issued covering transactions relating to bank\u2019s own Investment Accounts\nonly, and no BR should be issued by bank covering transactions relating to either the\nAccounts of Portfolio Management Scheme Clients or Other Constituents\u2019 Account\nincluding brokers.\n7.5.2  BR Form Issue, Custody, Record\n7.5.2.1 BRs should be issued on semi-security paper, in the standard format (prescribed by IBA),\nserially numbered, and signed by two authorised officials of the bank, whose signatures are\nrecorded with other banks. As in the case of SGL forms, there should be control system in place\nto account for each BR form.\n2. There should be a proper system for the custody of unused BR forms and their utilisation.\n3. Separate registers of BRs issued and BRs received should be maintained, and\narrangements should be put in place to ensure that these are systematically followed-up\nand liquidated within the stipulated time limit.\n4. A system for verification of the authenticity of the BRs received from other banks and\nconfirmation of authorised signatures should be put in place.\n7.5.3  Settlement through BRs\n7.5.3.1 No BR should remain outstanding for more than 15 days.\n7.5.3.2 A BR should be redeemed only by actual delivery of scrips and not by cancellation of the\ntransaction/set-off against another transaction. If a BR is not redeemed by delivery of scrips\nwithin the validity period of 15 days, the BR should be deemed as dishonoured and the bank\nwhich has issued the BR should refer the case to Reserve Bank explaining the reasons under\nwhich the scrips could not be delivered within the stipulated period and the proposed manner of\nsettlement of the transactions.\n7.5.4  Control, Violation and Penalty Provisions\n7.5.4.1 The existence and operation of controls at the concerned offices should be reviewed,\namong others, by the statutory auditors and a certificate to this effect may be forwarded to\nReserve Bank of India, Urban Banks Department, Central Office, Mumbai 400 018 every year.\n7.5.4.2The violation of the instructions relating to the BRs would invite penal action which could\ninclude raising of reserve requirements, withdrawal of refinance from the RBI and denial of\naccess to money markets. The RBI may also levy such other penalty as it may deem fit in\naccordance with the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS).\n7.5.4.3 The reconciliation should be periodically checked by the internal audit department.\n7.6 Accounting for the Deals\n7.6.1 For every transaction entered into, a deal slip should be prepared which should contain\ndetails relating to name of the counter-party, whether it is direct deal or through a broker, and if\nthrough a broker, details of security, amount, price, contract date and time. For each deal, there\nmust be a system of issue of confirmation to the counter-party.\n7.6.2 The Deal Slips should be serially numbered and controlled separately to ensure that each\ndeal slip has been properly accounted for.\n7.6.3 On the basis of vouchers passed after verification of actual contract notes received from the\nbroker/counter-party and confirmation of the deal by the counter-party the Accounts Section\nshould independently write the books of accounts.\n7.6.4 A record of broker-wise details of deals put through and brokerage paid, should be\nmaintained.7.6.5 The Internal Audit Department should audit the transactions in securities on an ongoing\nbasis and monitor compliance with the laid down management policies and prescribed\nprocedures and report the deficiencies directly to the management of the bank.\n8 READY FORWARD CONTRACTS IN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES\n8.1 Primary (urban) co-operative banks are permitted to undertake ready forward contracts\n(including reverse ready forward contracts), subject to undernoted terms and conditions:\n1. Ready forward contracts  should be undertaken only in Treasury Bills and dated  securities\nof all maturities issued by the Government of India and State Governments.\n8.1.2 Ready forward contracts  in the securities specified at paragraph 8.1.1 above may be\nentered into by a banking company, a co-operative bank, or any person maintaining a Subsidiary\nGeneral Ledger Account with Reserve Bank, Mumbai.\n3. Such ready forward contracts  shall be settled through the SGL Accounts of the\nparticipants with Reserve Bank or through the SGL Accounts of the Clearing Corporation\nof India Ltd. with Reserve Bank.\n4. No sale transaction should be put through without actually holding the securities in the\nportfolio.\n5. The banks should comply with all other instructions on securities transactions issued from\ntime to time.\n8. UNIFORM ACCOUNTING FOR REPO/REVERSEREPO TRANSACTION\n9. In order to ensure uniform accounting treatment for repo/reverse repo transactions and to\nimpart an element of transparency, the banks should follow the uniform accounting\nprinciples detailed below:\n9.2 The uniform accounting principles will be applicable from the financial year 2003-04. On\nimplementation, market participants may undertake repos from any of the three categories of\ninvestments, viz. Held for Trading, Available for Sale and Held to Maturity.\n9.3 The legal character of repo under the current law, viz. as outright purchase and outright sale\ntransactions will be kept intact by ensuring that the securities sold under repo (the entity selling\nreferred to as \"seller\") are excluded from the Investment Account of the seller of securities and\nthe securities bought under reverse repo (the entity buying referred to as \"buyer\") are included in\nthe Investment Account of the buyer of securities. Further, the buyer can reckon the approved\nsecurities acquired under reverse repo transaction for the purpose of Statutory Liquidity Ratio\n(SLR) during the period of the repo.\n9.4 At present, repo transactions are permitted in Central Government securities including\nTreasury Bills and dated State Government securities. Since the buyer of the securities will not\nhold it till maturity, the securities purchased under reverse repo by banks should not be classified\nunder Held to Maturity category. The first leg of the repo should be contracted at prevailing\nmarket rates. Further, the accrued interest received/paid in a repo/reverse repo transaction and\nthe clean price (i.e. total cash consideration less accrued interest) should be accounted for\nseparately and distinctly.\n9.5 The other accounting principles to be followed while accounting for repos/reverse repos will\nbe as under:\n9.5.1 Coupon\nIn case the interest payment date of the security offered under repo falls within the repo period,\nthe coupons received by the buyer of the security should be passed on to the seller on the date of\nreceipt as the cash consideration payable by the seller in the second leg does not include any\nintervening cash flows. While the buyer will book the coupon during the period of the repo, the\nseller will not accrue the coupon during the period of the repo. In the case of discounted\ninstruments like Treasury Bills, since there is no coupon, the seller will continue to accrue the\ndiscount at the original discount rate during the period of the repo. The buyer will not, therefore,\naccrue the discount during the period of the repo.\n9.5.2  Repo Interest Income/ExpenditureAfter the second leg of the repo/reverse repo transaction is over,\n9.5.2.1 the difference in the clean price of the security between the first leg and the second leg\nshould be reckoned as Repo Interest Income/Expenditure in the books of the buyer/seller\nrespectively;\n9.5.2.2 the difference between the accrued interest paid between the two legs of the transaction\nshould be shown as Repo Interest Income/Expenditure account, as the case may be; and\n9.5.2.3 the balance outstanding in the Repo Interest Income/Expenditure account should be\ntransferred to the Profit and Loss account as an income or an expenditure. As regards\nrepo/reverse repo transactions outstanding on the balance sheet date, only the accrued\nincome/expenditure till the balance sheet date should be taken to the Profit and Loss account.\nAny repo income/expenditure for the subsequent period in respect of the outstanding transactions\nshould be reckoned for the next accounting period.\n9.5.3 Marking to Market\nThe buyer will mark to market the securities acquired under reverse repo transactions as per the\ninvestment classification of the security. To illustrate, for banks, in case the securities acquired\nunder reverse repo transactions have been classified under Available for Sale category, then the\nmark to market valuation for such securities should be done at least once a quarter. For entities\nwho do not follow any investment classification norms, the valuation for securities acquired under\nreverse repo transactions may be in accordance with the valuation norms followed by them in\nrespect of securities of similar nature.\n9.5.3.1 In respect of the repo transactions outstanding as on the balance sheet date:- the buyer\nwill mark to market the securities on the balance sheet date and will account for the same as laid\ndown in the extant valuation guidelines issued by the RBI.\n9.5.3.2 the seller will provide for the price difference in the Profit & Loss account and show this\ndifference under \"Other Assets\" in the balance sheet if the sale price of the security offered under\nrepo is lower than the book value.\n9.5.3.3 the seller will ignore the price difference for the purpose of Profit & Loss account but show\nthe difference under \"Other Liabilities\" in the balance sheet if the sale price of the security offered\nunder repo is higher than the book value; and\n9.5.3.4 similarly the accrued interest paid/received in the repo/reverse repo transactions\noutstanding on balance sheet dates should be shown as \"Other Assets\" or \"Other Liabilities\" in\nthe balance sheet.\n9.5.3.5  Book value on re-purchase\nThe seller shall debit the repo account with the original book value (as existing in the books on\nthe date of the first leg) on buying back the securities in the second leg.\n9.5.3.6  Disclosure\nThe following disclosures should be made by banks in the \"Notes on Accounts\" to the Balance\nSheet.\n(Rs. in crores)\nParticulars Minimum\noutstanding\nduring the yearMaximum\noutstanding\nduring the\nyearDaily Average\noutstanding\nduring the yearAs on March 31\nSecurities sold\nunder repos    \nSecurities\npurchased\nunder reverse\nrepos    \n \n9.5.3.7  Accounting methodologyThe accounting methodology to be followed along with illustrations are given in the Annexure I\nand II (enclosed to our circular UBD.BPD.PCB. Cir.44/09.80.00/2002-03 dated May 12, 2003).\nWhile market participants, having different accounting systems, may use accounting heads\ndifferent from those used in the illustration, there should not be any deviation from the accounting\nprinciples enunciated above. Further, to obviate disputes arising out of repo transactions, the\nparticipants may consider entering into bilateral Master Repo Agreement as per the\ndocumentation finalised by FIMMDA.\n10 TRADING OF GOVERNMENT SECURITIES ON\nSTOCK EXCHANGES\n10.1 With a view to encouraging wider participation of all classes of investors, including retail, in\ngovernment securities, it has been decided to introduce trading in government securities through\na nation-wide anonymous, order driven, screen-based trading system of the stock exchanges, in\nthe same manner in which trading takes place in equities. This facility of trading of government\nsecurities on the stock exchanges, in the dematerialized mode  only, would be available to banks\nin addition to the present NDS of the Reserve Bank, which will continue to remain in place.\n10.2 The primary (urban) co-operative banks have the option to undertake transactions in dated\nGovernment of India (GOI) securities in dematerialized form on automated order driven system of\nthe National Stock Exchange (NSE), The Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE) and Over the Counter\nExchange of India (OTCEI) in addition to the existing mode of dealing through SGL accounts with\nReserve Bank of India or Constituent SGL accounts with the designated entities such as\nScheduled Commercial Bank/Primary Dealer/State Cooperative Bank etc.\n10.3 As the trading facility on the above stock exchanges will operate in parallel to the present\nsystem of trading in government securities, the trades concluded on the exchanges will be\ncleared by their respective clearing corporations/clearing houses. However, trading members of\nthe stock exchanges shall not be involved in the, settlement process for any RBI regulated entity.\nAll stock exchange trades of banks have to be settled either directly with clearing\ncorporation/clearing house (in case they are clearing members) or else through a clearing\nmember custodian.\n10.4 Banks, as institutional investors on the stock exchanges, can undertake transactions only on\nthe basis of giving and taking delivery of securities. In other words, short selling of government\nsecurities, even on an intra-day basis, is not permissible.\n10.5 With a view to facilitating participation on the stock exchanges within the regulations\nprescribed by RBI, SEBI and the exchanges, banks are being extended the following facilities:\n10.5.1 Open demat accounts with a bank depository participant (DP) of NSDL/CDSL or with\nSHCIL in addition to their SGL/CSGL accounts with RBI.\n10.5.2 Value free transfer of securities between SGL/CSGL and demat Accounts is being enabled\nat Public Debt Office (PDO), Mumbai, subject to operational guidelines issued separately by our\nDepartment of Government and Bank Accounts (DGBA) to all SGL account holders.\n10.6 The balances in government securities maintained by the banks in the depositories will be\nincluded for SLR purpose. Also, any shortfall in maintenance of CRR/SLR resulting from\nsettlement failure (on either the NDS-OTC market or the stock exchanges) will attract the usual\npenalties.\n10.7 The Boards of primary (urban) co-operative banks may take a conscious decision in regard\nto using the stock exchange platform for making investments in government securities in addition\nto the existing NDS-OTC market and the direct bidding facility. As regulations of SEBI will also\napply in so far as trading of government securities is concerned, the Board should frame and\nimplement a suitable policy to ensure that operations are conducted in accordance with the\nnorms laid down by RBI/SEBI and the respective stock exchange. Prior to commencing\noperations, the dealing officials should also familiarise themselves with the basic operating\nprocedures of the stock exchanges.\n10.8 Operational Guidelines relating to trading of Govt. Securities on Stock Exchanges\nBanks should also put in place appropriate internal control systems catering to stock exchange\ntrading and settlement before commencing operations on the exchanges. The back office\narrangement should be such that trading on the NDS/OTC market and on the stock exchanges\ncan be tracked easily for settlement, reconciliation and management reporting. Banks should,\ntherefore, install enabling IT infrastructure and adequate risk management systems.10.9 Only SEBI registered brokers who are authorized by the permitted exchanges (NSE, BSE or\nOTCEI) to undertake transactions in government securities can be used for placing buy/sell\norders. A valid contract note indicating the time of execution must be obtained from the broker at\nend of day.\n10.10 The dealing officials should independently check prices in the market or on the stock\nexchange screens before placing their orders with the brokers. The decision-making processes\ncannot be delegated to brokers by the banks.\n10.11 The transactions done through any broker will be subjected to the current guidelines on\ntransactions done through brokers.\n10.12 Brokers/trading members shall not be involved in the settlement process; all trades have to\nbe settled through clearing member custodians. Hence, it will be necessary for primary (urban)\nco-operative banks to enter into a bilateral clearing agreement with such service providers\nbeforehand.\n10.13 All transactions must be monitored with a view to ensuring timely receipt of funds and\nsecurities. Any delay or failure should be promptly taken up with the concerned\nexchange/authorities.\n10.14 At the time of trade, securities must be available with the banks either in their SGL or in the\ndemat account with depositories.\n10.15 Any settlement failure on account of non-delivery of securities/non-availability of clear funds\nwill be treated as SGL bouncing and the current penalties in respect of SGL bouncing will be\napplicable. The stock exchanges will report such failures to the respective Public Debt Offices.\n10.16 For the limited purpose of dealing through the Screen based trading system of the stock\nexchanges the condition that a primary (urban) co-operative bank should seek a scheduled\ncommercial bank, a primary dealer, a financial institution, another primary (urban) co-operative\nbank, insurance company, mutual fund or provident fund as a counter party while undertaking\ntransactions in Government securities will not apply.\n10.17 Banks should report on weekly basis to their Audit Committee of the Board, giving the\ndetails of trades on aggregate basis done on the stock exchanges and details of any \"closed-out\"\ntransactions on the exchanges.\n10.18 The banks should take all necessary precautions and strictly adhere to all\ninstructions/guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank relating to transaction in Government\nsecurities as hitherto.\n11 Investment Accounting & Internal Controls\n11.1 Accounting Standards\nIn order to bring about uniform accounting practice among banks in booking of income on units of\nUTI and equity of All-India Financial Institutions, as a prudent practice, such income should be\nbooked on cash basis and not on accrual basis. However, in respect of income from Government\nsecurities/bonds of public sector undertakings and All-India Financial Institutions, where interest\nrates on the instruments are predetermined, income may be booked on accrual basis, provided\ninterest is serviced regularly and is not in arrears.\n11.2 Broken Period Interest - Government and Other Approved Securities\n11.2.1 With a view to bringing about uniformity in the accounting treatment of broken period\ninterest on Government securities paid at the time of acquisition and to comply with the\nAccounting Standards prescribed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the bank\nshould not  capitalise the broken period interest paid to seller as part of cost, but treat it as an item\nof expenditure under Profit & Loss Account.\n2. It is to be noted that the above accounting treatment does not take into account taxation\nimplications and hence the bank should comply with the requirements of income tax\nauthorities in the manner prescribed by them.\n12 INTERNAL CONTROL - RECOMMENDATIONS BY\nGHOSH COMMITTEE\nThe following recommendations made by the Ghosh Committee should be implemented by the\nbanks to prevent frauds and malpractices:\n12.1 Concurrent Audit12.1.1 In view of the possibility of abuse, treasury functions viz. investments, funds management\nincluding inter-bank borrowings, bills rediscounting, etc. should be subjected to concurrent audit\nand the results of audit should be placed before the Chairman and Managing Director of the bank\nat prescribed intervals.\n12.1.2 It is the primary responsibility of the banks to ensure that there are adequate audit\nprocedures for ensuring proper compliance of the instructions in regard to the conduct of\ninvestment portfolio.\n12.1.3 The concurrent audit should cover the following aspects:\n12.1.3.1 Ensure that in respect of purchase and sale of securities the concerned department has\nacted within its delegated powers.\n2. Ensure that the securities other than those in SGL and in demat form, as shown in the\nbooks, are physically held.\n3. Ensure that the Accounting Unit is complying with the guidelines regarding BRs, SGL\nforms, delivery of scrips, documentation and accounting.\n4. Ensure that the sale or purchase transactions are done at rates beneficial to the bank.\n5. Scrutinise conformity with broker limits and include excesses observed in their periodical\nreports.\n6. Banks should formulate internal control guidelines for acquisition of permissible shares,\ndebentures and PSU bonds in the secondary market duly approved by their Boards.\n12.2 Internal Audit\nIn view of the possibility of abuse, purchase and sale of government securities etc. should be\nseparately subjected to audit by internal auditors (and in the absence of internal auditors by\nChartered Accountants out of the panel maintained by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies)\nand the results of their audit should be placed before the Board of Directors once in every\nquarter. These audit reports should be sent to the concerned Regional Office of the Urban Banks\nDepartment, Reserve Bank of India, at half-yearly intervals i.e. for half-year ended 30th\nSeptember and 31st March.\n12.3 Review\nBanks should undertake a half-yearly review (as of 31st March and 30th September) of their\ninvestment portfolio, which should, apart from other operational aspects of investment portfolio,\nclearly indicate and certify adherence to the laid down internal investment policy and procedures\nand RBI guidelines, and put up the same before the Board within a month.\n12.4 Penalties for Violation\nBanks should scrupulously follow the above instructions. Any violation of these instructions will\ninvite penal action against defaulting banks which could include raising of reserve requirements,\nwithdrawal of refinance from the Reserve Bank, denial of access to money markets, denial of new\nbranches/extension counters and advising the President of Clearing House to take appropriate\naction including suspension of membership of the Clearing House.\n13 Categorisation of Investments\n13.1 Primary (urban) co-operative banks are required to classify their entire investment portfolio\n(including SLR and non-SLR securities) under three categories viz. -\n1. Held to Maturity (HTM)\n2. Available for Sale (AFS)\n3. Held for Trading (HFT)\nbanks should decide the category of the investment at the time of acquisition and the decision\nshould be recorded on the investment proposals.\n13.2 Held to Maturity\n13.2.1 Securities acquired by the banks with the intention to hold them up to maturity will be\nclassified under \"Held to Maturity\" category.2. The investments included under \"Held to Maturity\" category should not exceed 25 per\ncent of the bank's total investments.\n3. Primary (urban) co-operative banks are not permitted to invest in bonds and debentures\nof private sector companies. Their investments in bonds of PSUs and shares (as\npermitted by RBI) should be classified under 'Held to Maturity' category but these will not\nbe counted for the purpose of ceiling of 25% specified for this category.\n2. Held for Trading\n13.3.1 Securities acquired by the banks with the intention to trade by taking advantage of the\nshort-term price/interest rate movements will be classified under \u2018Held for Trading\u2019 category.\n13.3.2 If banks are not able to sell the security within 90 days due to exceptional circumstances\nsuch as tight liquidity conditions, or extreme volatility, or market becoming unidirectional, the\nsecurity should be shifted to the \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 category, subject to conditions stipulated in\nparagraphs 13.5.3 and 13.5.4 below.\n13.4 Available for Sale\n13.4.1 Securities which do not fall within the above two categories will be classified under\n\u2018Available for Sale\u2019 category.\n13.4.2 Banks have the freedom to decide on the extent of holdings under \u2018Available for Sale\u2019\ncategory. This may be decided by them considering various aspects such as basis of intent,\ntrading strategies, risk management capabilities, tax planning, manpower skills, capital position,\netc.\n13.5 Shifting of investments\n13.5.1 Banks may shift investments to/from \u2018Held to Maturity\u2019 category with the approval of the\nBoard of Directors once in a year. Such shifting will normally be allowed at the beginning of the\naccounting year. No further shifting to/from this category will be allowed during the remaining part\nof that accounting year.\n2. Banks may shift investments from \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 category to \u2018Held for Trading\u2019\ncategory with the approval of their Board of Directors. In case of exigencies, such shifting\nmay be done with the approval of the Chief Executive of the Bank, but should be ratified\nby the Board of Directors.\n3. Shifting of investments from \u2018Held for Trading\u2019 category to \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 category is\ngenerally not allowed. However, it will be permitted only under exceptional circumstances\nsuch as mentioned in paragraph 13.3.2 above, subject to depreciation, if any, applicable\non the date of transfer, with the approval of the Board of Directors/Investment Committee.\n4. Transfer of scrips from one category to another, under all circumstances, should be done\nat the acquisition cost/book value/market value on the date of transfer, whichever is the\nleast, and the depreciation, if any, on such transfer should be fully provided for.\n13.6 Classification of Investments in the Balance Sheet\nFor the purpose of Balance Sheet, the investments should continue to be classified in the\nfollowing categories:\n1. Government securities\n2. Other approved securities\n3. Shares\n4. Bonds of PSUs\n5. Others\n13.7 Investment Fluctuation Reserve1. Banks should build up Investment Fluctuation Reserve (IFR) out of realised gains on sale\nof investments, and subject to available net profit, of a minimum of 5 per cent of the\ninvestment portfolio within a period of 5 years. This minimum requirement should be\ncomputed with reference to investments in two categories, viz., \u2018Held for Trading (HFT)\u2019\nand \u2018Available for Sale (AFS)\u2019. It will not be necessary to include investment under \u2018Held\nto Maturity\u2019 category for the purpose. However, banks are free to build up a higher\npercentage of IFR up to 10 per cent of the portfolio depending on the size and\ncomposition of their portfolio, with the approval of their Board of Directors.\n2. Banks should transfer maximum amount of the gains realised on sale of investment in\nsecurities to the IFR. Transfer to IFR shall be as an appropriation of net profit after\nappropriation to Statutory Reserve.\n3. The IFR, consisting of realised gains from the sale of investments from the two\ncategories, viz., \u2018Held for Trading\u2019 and \u2018Available for Sale\u2019, would be eligible for inclusion\nin Tier II capital.\n4. Transfer from IFR to the Profit & Loss Account to meet depreciation requirement on\ninvestments would be a \u2018below the line\u2019 extraordinary item.\n5. Banks should ensure that the unrealised gains on valuation of the investment portfolio\nare not taken to the Income Account or to the IFR.\n6. Banks may utilise the amount held in IFR to meet, in future, the depreciation requirement\non investment in securities.\n7. Creation of IFR as per the above guidelines is mandatory for primary (urban) co-\noperative banks having aggregate Demand and Time Liabilities of Rs. 100 crore and\nabove, and optional for smaller banks.\n8. It may be noted that Investment Fluctuation Reserve (IFR) is the realised profit out of sale\nof investments held under \u2018HFT\u2019 or \u2018AFS\u2019 category, and qualifies as Tier II capital,\nwhereas Investment Depreciation Reserve (IDR) is a provision created by charging\ndiminution in investment value to Profit & Loss Account.\n14 Investment Valuation\n14.1 Valuation Standards\n14.1.1 Investments classified under 'Held to Maturity' category need not be marked to market and\nwill be carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the face value, in which case the premium\nshould be amortised over the period remaining to maturity.\n2. The individual scrip in the \u2018Available for Sale\u2019 category will be marked to market at the\nyear-end or at more frequent intervals. While the net depreciation under each\nclassification i.e. HTM, AFS, or HFT should be recognised and fully provided for the net\nappreciation should be ignored. The book value of the individual securities would not\nundergo any change after the revaluation.\nNote: Securities under this category shall be valued scrip-wise and\ndepreciation/appreciation shall be aggregated for each classifications viz.\nHTM, AFS or HFT. Net depreciation, if any, shall be provided for. Net\nappreciation, if any, should be ignored. Net depreciation required to be\nprovided for in any one classification should not be reduced on account of\nnet appreciation in any other classification.\n3. Investment Depreciation Reserve required to be created on account of depreciation in\nvalue of investments held under \u2018AFS\u2019 or \u2018HFT\u2019 categories in any year should be debited\nto the Profit & Loss Account and an equivalent amount (net of tax benefit, if any, and netof consequent reduction in the transfer to Statutory Reserve) or the balance available in\nthe Investment Fluctuation Reserve Account, whichever is less, shall be transferred from\nthe Investment Fluctuation Reserve Account to the Profit & Loss Account.\n4. In the event, investment depreciation reserve created on account of depreciation in\ninvestments is found to be in excess of the required amount in any year, the excess\nshould be credited to the Profit & Loss Account and an equivalent amount (net of taxes, if\nany, and net of transfer to Statutory Reserves as applicable to such excess provision)\nshould be appropriated to the Investment Fluctuation Reserve Account to be utilised to\nmeet future depreciation requirement for investments. The amounts debited to the Profit\n& Loss Account for depreciation provision and the amount credited to the Profit & Loss\nAccount for reversal of excess provision should be debited and credited respectively\nunder the head \"Expenditure - Provisions & Contingencies\".The amounts appropriated\nfrom Profit & Loss Account and the amount transferred from IFR to the Profit & Loss\nAccount should be shown as \u2018below the line\u2019 items after determining the profit for the\nyear.\n5. The individual scrip in the \"Held for Trading\" category will be marked to market at monthly\nor at more frequent intervals, the book value of individual securities in this category would\nnot undergo any change after marking to market i.e. while the net depreciation in the\nvalue of investments, if any, shall be provided for, net appreciation, if any, should be\nignored. Net depreciation required to be provided for any one category should not be\nnetted with net appreciation in any other category.\n6. In respect of securities included in any of the three categories where interest/principal is\nin arrears, the banks should not reckon income on the securities and should also make\nappropriate provisions for the depreciation in the value of the investment. The banks\nshould not set-off the depreciation requirement in respect of these non-performing\nsecurities against the appreciation in respect of other performing securities.\n1. Market Value\n14.2.1 Quoted Securities\nThe 'market value' for the purpose of periodical valuation of investments included in the\n\"Available for Sale\" and the \"Held for Trading\" categories would be the market price of\nthe scrip as available from the trades/quotes on the stock exchanges, SGL account\ntransactions, price list of RBI, prices declared by Primary Dealers Association of India\n(PDAI) jointly with the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India\n(FIMMDA) periodically.\n2. Unquoted SLR Securities\nIn respect of unquoted securities, the procedure as detailed below should be adopted.\n(i) Central Government Securities\na. The Reserve Bank of India will not announce the YTM rates for unquoted Government\nsecurities, for the purpose of valuation of investments by banks. The banks should value\nthe unquoted Central Government securities on the basis of the prices/YTM rates put out\nby the PDAI/FIMMDA at periodical intervals.\nb. The 6.00 per cent Capital Indexed Bonds may be valued at \"cost\" which may be\nreckoned by using the index ratio calculated by taking the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)\nwith a three months' lag. For example, the WPI for the month of November 1997 may be\nused to calculate the index ratio for month of March 1998. An illustrative example is given\nbelow:The bonds were issued in December 1997 at par. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for\nAugust 1997 was taken as the Base WPI. Similarly, the Reference WPI for payment of\nredemption value in December 2002, is taken as the WPI for August 2002. Thus, a clear\n3 months' lag is followed for indexation of capital. The same principle can be applied for\narriving at 'Cost' for the purpose of valuation of Capital Indexed Bonds. If the valuation of\nthe bond is to be done in March 1998, the index ratio can be calculated by taking the WPI\nfor November 1997 as the Reference WPI. While thus for every quarter ending March of\na year, the numerator will take WPI of November of the previous year, for other quarters\nending in months viz. June, September and December, every year, the index ratio will\ntake in the numerator WPI for February, May and August of the respective years.\nAssuming that the Monthly Average Index of Wholesale Prices (1981 - 82 = 100) for\nNovember 1997 is 329.90. The Reference WPI is 329.90. The base WPI, i.e. the WPI for\nAugust 1997 is 326.00. The calculation of 'Cost' of Capital Indexed Bonds is illustrated\nbelow:\n  \n WPI for November 1997\n=------------------------------------\n Base WPI\n  Index Ratio for\nMarch 1998\n=329.9\n-------- = 1.01196 or 1.01 (rounded to two decimal\nplaces)\n326.00\nCost of the bonds for valuation as on 31 March 1998 Rs. 100 x 1.01 = Rs. 101.00.\n\u2022  It is clarified that the reckoning of number of years for the purpose of deciding upon appropriate\nYTM Rate be done by rounding off the fractional period of a year to the nearest completed year.\n\u2022  As regards valuation of other unquoted securities including PSU bonds, banks should uniformly\nfollow \u2018Yield to Maturity\u2019 method for arriving at valuation of unquoted securities.\n(ii) Treasury Bills should be valued at carrying cost.\n(iii) State Government Securities\nState Government securities will be valued applying the YTM method by marking it up by 25\nbasis points above the yields of the Central Government Securities of equivalent maturity put out\nby PDAI/FIMMDA periodically.\n(iv) Other Approved Securities\nOther approved securities will be valued applying the YTM method by marking it up by 25 basis\npoints above the yields of the Central Government Securities of equivalent maturity put out by\nPDAI/FIMMDA periodically.\n2. Unquoted non-SLR securities\n(i) Debentures/Bonds of AIFIs and PSUs\nAll debentures/bonds other than debentures/bonds which are in the nature of advance should be\nvalued on the YTM basis. Such debentures/bonds may be of different ratings. These will be\nvalued with appropriate mark-up over the YTM rates for Central Government securities as put out\nby PDAI/FIMMDA periodically. The mark-up will be graded according to the ratings assigned to\nthe debentures/bonds by the rating agencies subject to the following:\n(a) The rate used for the YTM for rated debentures/bonds should be at least 50 basis points\nabove the rate applicable to a Government of India loan of equivalent maturity,(b) The rate used for the YTM for unrated debentures/ bonds should not be less than the rate\napplicable to rated debentures/bonds of equivalent maturity. The mark-up for the unrated\ndebentures/bonds should appropriately reflect the credit risk borne by the bank.\n(c) Where interest/principal on the debenture/bonds is in arrears, the provision should be made\nfor the debentures as in the case of debentures/bonds treated as advances. The\ndepreciation/provision requirement towards debentures where the interest is in arrears or\nprincipal is not paid as per due date, shall not be allowed to be set-off against appreciation\nagainst other debentures/bonds.\n(ii) Where the debentures/bond is quoted and there have been transactions within 15 days prior\nto the valuation date, the value adopted should not be higher than the rate at which the\ntransaction is recorded on the stock exchange.\n(iii) Shares of Co-operative Institutions\nIf primary (urban) co-operative banks have regularly received dividends from co-operative\ninstitutions, then their shares should be valued at face value. In a number of cases, the co-\noperative institutions in whose shares the primary (urban) co-operative banks have made\ninvestments have either gone into liquidation or have not declared dividend at all. In such cases,\nthe banks should make full provision in respect of their investments in shares of such co-\noperative institutions. In cases where the financial position of co-operative institutions in whose\nshares banks have made investments is not available, the shares have to be taken at Re. 1/- per\nco-operative institution.\n14.2.4 Shares of All India Financial Institutions\nPrimary (urban) co-operative banks are allowed to invest in the shares of all India Financial\nInstitutions.\nWhere stock exchange quotations are available, the shares should be valued accordingly. Equity\nshares for which current quotations are not available or where the shares are not quoted on the\nstock exchanges, should be valued at break-up value (without considering 'revaluation reserves',\nif any) which is to be ascertained from the company's latest balance sheet (which should not be\nmore than one year prior to the date of valuation). In case the latest balance sheet is not\navailable, the shares are to be valued at Re. 1 per company.\n(i) Units of UTI\n(a) Investments in quoted Mutual Fund Units should be valued as per stock exchange quotations.\nInvestments in non-quoted Mutual Funds Units are to be valued on the basis of the latest re-\npurchase price declared by the Mutual Funds in respect of each particular Scheme. In case of\nfunds with a lock-in period, or where repurchase price/market quote is not available, Units could\nbe valued at NAV. If NAV is not available, then these could be valued at cost, till the end of the\nlock-in period.\n(ii) Commercial Paper\n(a) Commercial paper should be valued at the carrying cost.\n15 REPORTING\nScheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks are required to submit a statement containing\ninformation on their investments in approved securities and money market instruments, etc. on\nquarterly basis. The statement as at the end of each calendar quarter should reach RBI, Central\nOffice, Urban Banks Department within 10 days from the close of the quarter.\nAppendix\nMaster Circular on Investments by Primary (urban) Co-op.

Banks may form a subsidiary company for\nundertaking the types of business which a banking company is otherwise permitted to undertake,\nwith prior approval of Reserve Bank of India. The instructions issued by Reserve Bank of India\nto   banks for undertaking certain financial services or para-banking activities as permitted by\nRBI  have been compiled in this Master Circular.\n1.2   Subsidiary Companies\nUnder the provisions of Section 19(1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 ,  banks may form\nsubsidiary companies for undertaking types of banking business which they are otherwise\npermitted to undertake [under clauses (a) to (o) of sub-section 1 of Section 6 of the Banking\nRegulation Act, 1949],  carrying on the business of banking exclusively outside India and for\nsuch other business purposes as may be approved by the Central Government.  Prior approval of\nthe Reserve Bank of India should be taken by a bank to set up a subsidiary company.\n1.3   Investment ceiling in financial services companies, etc.\nUnder the provisions of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, a banking company\ncannot hold shares in any company whether as pledgee  or mortgagee or absolute owner of an\namount exceeding 30 per cent of the paid-up share capital of that company or 30 per cent of its\nown paid-up share capital and reserves, whichever is less.   Besides, the investment by a bank in\na subsidiary company, financial services company, financial institution, stock and other\nexchanges should not exceed 10 per cent of the bank\u2019s paid-up capital and reserves and the\ninvestments in all such companies, financial institutions, stock and other exchanges put together\nshould not exceed 20 per cent of the bank\u2019s paid-up capital and reserves.  Banks cannot,\nhowever, participate in the equity of  financial services ventures including stock exchanges,\ndepositories, etc. without obtaining the prior specific approval of the Reserve Bank of India2\nnotwithstanding the fact that such investments may be within the ceiling prescribed under\nSection 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act.\n1.4  Equipment leasing, Hire purchase business and Factoring services\n With the prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India, banks can  form subsidiary companies for\nundertaking equipment leasing, hire purchase business and factoring services.  The subsidiaries\nformed should primarily be engaged in any of these activities and such other activities as are\nincidental to equipment leasing, hire purchase business and factoring services.  In other words,\nthey should not engage themselves in direct lending or carrying on of activities which are not\napproved by the Reserve Bank and financing of other companies or concerns engaged in\nequipment leasing, hire purchase business and factoring services.\n1.5 Equipment leasing, Hire purchase and Factoring services as\n departmental activities\nBanks can also undertake equipment leasing, hire purchase and factoring services\ndepartmentally. Prior approval of the RBI is not necessary for undertaking these activities\ndepartmentally. The banks should, however, report to the RBI about the nature of these activities\ntogether with the names of the branches from where these activities are taken up. The banks\nshould comply with the following prudential guidelines when they undertake these activities\ndepartmentally:\ni) As activities like equipment leasing and factoring services require skilled\npersonnel and adequate infrastructural facilities, they should be undertaken only\nby certain select branches of banks.\nii) These activit ies should be treated on par with loans and advances and should\naccordingly be given risk weight of 100 per cent for calculation of capital to risk\nasset ratio. Further, the extant guidelines on income recognition, asset\nclassification and provisioning would also be applicable to them.\niii) The facilities extended by way of equipment leasing, hire purchase finance and\nfactoring services would be covered within the exposure ceilings with regard to\nsingle borrower (15% of the bank's capital funds; 20 % provided the additional\ncredit exposure is on account of extension of credit to infrastructure projects) and\nborrower group (40% of the bank's capital funds; 50% provided the additional\ncredit exposure is on account of extension of credit to infrastructure projects).\niv) Banks should maintain a balanced portfolio of equipment leasing, hire purchase\nand factoring services vis-\u00e0-vis the aggregate credit. Their exposure to each of\nthese activities should not exceed 10 per cent of total advances.3\nv) Banks are require d to frame an appropriate policy on leasing business with the\napproval of the Boards and  evolve safeguards to avoid possible asset liability\nmismatch. While banks are free to fix the period of lease finance in accordance\nwith such policy framed by them, full depreciation should be provided for during\nthe primary lease period of the asset.\n(vi) Banks undertaking equipment leasing departmentally should follow prudential\naccounting standards. The entire lease rental should not be taken to the bank's income\naccount. The lease rentals comprise two elements - a finance charge (i.e. interest charge)\nand a charge towards recovery of the cost of the asset. The interest component alone\nshould be taken to the income account. The component representing the replacement cost\nof the asset should be carried to the balance sheet in the form of a provision for\ndepreciation.\n(vii) The net lease rentals (finance charge) on the leased asset accrued and credited to\nincome account before the asset became non-performing, and remaining unrealised,\nshould be reversed or provided for in the current accounting period.\nThe term 'net lease rentals' would mean the amount of finance charge taken to the\ncredit of P&L account and would be worked out as gross lease rentals adjusted by\namount of statutory depreciation and lease equalisation account.\nviii) Any changes brought about in respect of guidelines in asset classification, income\nrecognition and provisioning for loans/advances and other credit facilities would\nalso be applicable to leased assets of banks undertaking leasing activity\ndepartmentally.\nix) Banks should not enter into leasing agreement with equipment leasing companies\nand other non-banking finance companies engaged in equipment leasing.\nx) Lease rental receivables arising out  of sub-lease of an asset by a Non-banking\nFinancial Company undertaking leasing should not be included for the purpose of\ncomputation of bank finance for such company.\nxi) Banks undertaking factoring services departmentally should carefully assess the\nclient's working capital needs taking into account the invoices purchased.\nFactoring services should be extended only in respect of those invoices which\nrepresent genuine trade transactions. Banks should take particular care to ensure\nthat by extending factoring services, the client is not overfinanced.\n1.6  Mutual Fund business\ni) Prior approval of the RBI should be obtained by banks before undertaking mutual\nfund business. Bank-sponsored mutual funds should comply with guidelines\nissued by SEBI from time to time.\nii) The bank-sponsored mutual funds should not use the name of the sponsoring bank\nas part of their name. Where a bank's name has been associated with a mutual\nfund, a suitable disclaimer clause should be inserted while publicising new\nschemes that the bank is not liable or responsible for any loss or shortfall resulting\nfrom the operations of the scheme.4\n1.7 Relationship with the subsidiaries\nThe sponsor bank is required to maintain an \"arms length\" relationship from the\nsubsidiary/mutual fund sponsored by it in regard to business parameters such as, taking undue\nadvantage in borrowing/lending funds, transferring/selling/buying of securities at rates other than\nmarket rates, giving special consideration for securities transactions, overindulgence in\nsupporting/financing the subsidiary, financing the bank's clients through them when the bank\nitself is not able or is not permitted to do so, etc. Supervision by the parent bank should not,\nhowever, result in interference in the day-to-day management of the affairs of the\nsubsidiary/mutual fund. Banks should evolve appropriate strategies such as:\ni) The Board of Directors of the parent/sponsor bank may review the working of\nsubsidiaries/mutual fund at periodical intervals (say once in six months) covering\nthe major aspects relating to their functioning and give proper\nguidelines/suggestions for improvement, wherever considered necessary.\nii) The parent bank may cause inspection/audit of the books and accounts of the\nsubsidiaries/mutual fund at periodical intervals, as appropriate, and ensure that the\ndeficiencies noticed are rectified without lapse of time. If the bank's own\ninspection staff is not adequately equipped to undertake the inspection/audit, the\ntask may be entrusted to outside agencies like firms of Chartered Accountants. In\ncase there is technical difficulty for causing inspection/audit (e.g. on account of\nnon-existence of an enabling clause in the Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation of the subsidiary or Asset Management Company), steps should be\ntaken to amend the same suitably.\niii) Where banks have equity participation by way of portfolio investment in\ncompanies offering financial services, they may review the working of the latter at\nleast on an annual basis.\n1.8   Credit Card and Smart/Debit Card Business\n1.8.1 Credit Cards\nBanks can undertake credit card business either departmentally or through a subsidiary company\nset up for the purpose. They could also undertake domestic credit card business by entering into\ntie-up arrangement with one of the banks already having arrangements for issue of credit cards.\nPrior approval of the Reserve Bank  is not necessary for banks desirous of undertaking credit\ncard business either independently or in tie-up arrangement with other card issuing banks. Banks\ncan do so with the approval of their Boards.  However, only banks with networth of Rs.100 crore\nand above  should undertake  credit card business. Banks desirous of setting up  separate\nsubsidiaries for undertaking credit card business would, however, require prior approval of the\nReserve Bank.5\nBanks should adopt the following safeguards to ensure that their credit card operations are run on\nsound, prudent and profitable lines:\n(a)  Issue of cards\nBanks should be selective in issuing credit cards and proper appraisal should be made taking into\naccount the income, repaying capacity of the applicant and other relevant criteria before issuing\ncredit cards.\n(b) Recovery of overdues\n(i)   Banks should take immediate steps to reduce the incidence of default in credit card business\nand put in place appropriate mechanism for speedy recovery of dues from card holders.  Banks\nshould also closely monitor the recovery of credit card outstandings.\n(ii)  Banks may formulate specific Action Plans to this effect with the approval of their Boards of\nDirectors.\n(iii)  Banks should also observe the code of ethics formulated by the Indian Banks\u2019 Association\nwhile engaging recovery agents for collection of credit card overdues.\n(c)   Review of credit card business\nBanks engaged in credit card business should place before their Boards of Directors/Managing\nCommittees of the Boards a comprehensive review report on half yearly basis, which should\ncover essential data on credit card business such as category and number of cards issued and\namount outstanding, number of active cards, average turnover per card, number of\nestablishments covered, average time taken for recovery of dues from the cardholders, debts\nclassified as NPAs  and provisions held thereagainst , or amounts written off, details of frauds on\ncredit cards, steps taken to recover the dues, profitability analysis of the business, etc.\n(d) Sharing of information on credit card holders\nBanks should become members of one or more Credit Information Bureaus in order to maintain\nthe selectivity of customers in their credit card business.  Banks should also take advantage of\nthe existing negative file projects to guard against defaults in this business.\n(e) Fraud Control\nBanks should set up internal control systems to combat frauds. Banks should actively participate\nin fraud prevention committees/task forces which formulate laws to prevent frauds and take\nproactive fraud control and enforcement measures.\n(f)  Processing\nIn order to provide efficient back-office solution to the cards management process and in the\nareas of accounts receivables, billing, settlement and other related services it is necessary that\nbanks have in place a proper processing solution.  Banks should make use of developments in\nthis area to ensure better operating controls.\n(g) Fees/Charges on credit cards\n Banks should clearly spell out fees/charges to the cardholder at the time of their applying for\ncredit card.  In particular, banks should bring to the notice of the cardholder the rates of interest\nto be charged in case of delays and default in payments, besides the membership/renewal fees.6\n1.8.2  Smart/Debit Cards\nBanks can introduce smart/on-line debit cards  with the approval of their Boards, keeping in view\nthe Guidelines contained in Annexure I .  While banks need not obtain the prior approval of the\nReserve Bank of India, the details of smart/on-line debit cards introduced may be advised to the\nReserve Bank of India together with a copy each of the agenda note put up to their Boards and\nthe resolution passed thereon. In the case of debit cards where authorization  and settlement are\noff-line or where either authorization  or settlement is off-line, banks should obtain prior approval\nof the Reserve Bank of India for introduction of the same after submitting the details on mode of\nauthorization  and settlement, authentication method employed, technology used, tie-ups with\nother agencies/service providers (if any), together with Board note/Resolution.  However, only\nbanks with networth of Rs.100 crore and above should undertake issue of off-line debit cards.\nBanks cannot issue smart/debit cards in tie-up with other non-bank entities. Banks should review\noperations of smart/debit cards and put up review notes to their Boards at half-yearly intervals,\nsay at the end of March and September, every year.\nA report on the operations of smart/debit cards issued by banks should be forwarded to the\nDepartment of Information Technology with a copy to the concerned regional office of\nDepartment of Banking Supervision on a half yearly basis, say at the end of March and\nSeptember, every year, incorporating information as indicated in Annexure II.\n1.9   Money Market Mutual Funds ( MMMFs)\nMMMFs would come under the purview of SEBI regulations. Banks and Financial Institutions\ndesirous of setting up MMMFs would however have to seek necessary clearance from RBI for\nundertaking this additional activity before approaching SEBI for registration.\n1.10   'Cheque Writing' Facility for investors of Money Market Mutual Funds ( MMMFs)\nBanks are permitted to tie-up with MMMFs as also with MFs in respect of Gilt Funds and Liquid\nIncome Schemes which predominantly invest in money market instruments (not less than 80 per\ncent of the corpus) to offer cheque writing facilities to investors subject to the following\nsafeguards.\n(i) In the case of a MMMF set up by a bank, the tie-up arrangement should be with the sponsor\nbank.  In other cases, the tie-up should be with a designated bank.  The name of the bank should\nbe clearly indicated in the Offer Document of the Scheme.7\n(ii) The Offer Document should clearly indicate that the tie-up to offer \u2018cheque writing\u2019 facility\nis purely a commercial arrangement between the MMMF /MF and the designated bank, and as\nsuch, the servicing of the units of MMMF /MF will not in any way be the direct obligation of the\nbank concerned.  This should be clearly stated in all public announcements and communications\nto individual investors.\n(iii) The facility to any single investor in the MMMF/ MF can be permitted at the   investor\u2019s\noption, in only one of the branches of the designated bank.\n(iv) It should be in the nature of a drawing account, distinct from any other account, with clear\nlimits for drawals, the number of cheques that can be drawn, etc, as prescribed by MMMF/ MF.\nIt should not however be used as a regular bank account and cheques drawn on this account\nshould only be in favour of the investor himself (as part of redemption) and not in favour of third\nparties.  No deposits can be made in the account.  Each drawal made by the investor under the\nfacility should be consistent with the terms prescribed by the MMMF/ MF and treated as\nredemption of the holdings in the MMMF/ MF to that extent.\n(v) The facility can be availed of by investors only after the minimum lock-in period of 15 days\nfor investments in MMMFs  (not applicable in the case of eligible Gilt Funds and Liquid Income\nSchemes of Mutual Funds and any prescription of lock-in-period in such cases will be governed\nby SEBI  Regulations).\n(vi) The bank should ensure pre-funding of the drawing account by the MMMF/ MF at all times\nand review the funds position on a daily basis.\n(vii) Such other measures as may be considered necessary by the bank.\n1.11   Entry of banks into Insurance business\nWith the issuance of Government of India Notification dated August 3, 2000, specifying\n\u2018Insurance\u2019 as a permissible form of business that could be undertaken by banks under Section\n6(1)(o) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, banks were advised that any bank intending to\nundertake insurance business as per the guidelines set out in the Annexure III  should obtain prior\napproval of Reserve Bank of India before engaging in such business.  Banks may, therefore,\nsubmit necessary applications to RBI furnishing full details in respect of the parameters as\nspecified in the above guidelines, details of equity contribution proposed in the joint\nventure/strategic investment, the name of the company with whom the bank would have tie-up\narrangements in any manner in insurance business, etc.  The relative Board note and Resolution\npassed thereon approving the bank\u2019s proposal together with viability report prepared in this\nregard may also be forwarded to Reserve Bank. However, insurance business will not be\npermitted to be undertaken departmentally by the banks.  Further, banks need not obtain prior\napproval of the RBI for engaging in insurance agency business or referral arrangement without\nany risk participation, subject to certain conditions( Annexure IV).8\n1.12.1 Underwriting of Corporate Shares and Debentures\nGenerally, there are demands on the banks for underwriting the issues of shares and debentures.\nIn order to ensure that there is no overexposure to underwriting commitments, the guidelines\ndetailed below should be strictly adhered to.\n(i) The statutory provision contained in Section 19(2) & (3) of the Banking Regulation Act,\n1949 regarding holding of shares in any company as pledgee / mortgagee or absolute owner,\nshould be strictly adhered to;\n(ii) The banks have to ensure that the shares/debentures including PSU equities and shares of\nother banks, Mutual Funds (the corpus of which is not exclusively invested in corporate debt\ninstruments), the units of UTI subscribed and/or devolving on them as a part of their\nunderwriting obligations in any particular year comply with the ceiling prescribed for the banks\u2019\nexposure to the capital markets.\na. It may be noted that the limit placed is on the shares and debentures, that may be\nheld in the banks own portfolio as a result of devolvement and not on the amount\nof underwriting that the banks may engage in. Normally, the amount of\nunderwriting is a multiple of the amount which devolves finally.\nb. The underwriting exposure to any company which will include other funded and\nnon-funded credit limits should not exceed 15 percent ( upto 20 percent provided\nadditional credit exposure is on account of infrastructure project) of capital funds\nof the banks in the case of a single company and 40 percent (up to 50 percent,\nprovided the additional credit exposure is on account of extension of credit to\ninfrastructure project) in the case of group of companies.\nc. While taking up underwriting commitments, banks or their subsidiaries, should\nensure that the aggregate of such commitments are included in the exposure limits\nfixed by the Reserve Bank.\nd. In the case of underwriting, the commitments under a single obligation should be\nfixed taking into account the owned funds of banks and the capacity to meet the\ncommitments that may devolve and should not in any case exceed 15 percent of\nan issue.\ne. Banks could consider sub-underwriting for every underwritten issue so as to\nminimise chances of devolution on their own account. This is not mandatory. The\nneed for and extent of such sub-underwriting is a matter of bank\u2019s discretion.\nf. While taking up underwriting obligations, banks should carefully evaluate the\nproposals so as to ensure that the issues will have adequate public response and\nthe prospect of devolution of such shares/debentures on the underwriting banks\nwill be minimal.\ng. Banks should ensure that the portfolio is diversified and that no unduly large\nunderwriting obligations are taken up in the shares and debentures of a company9\nor a group of companies. Banks should make enquiries regarding the other\nunderwriters and their capacity to fulfil the obligations.\nBanks should formulate within the above parameters, their own internal\nguidelines as approved by their Boards of Directors on investments in corporate\nshares/debentures of companies or group of companies including norms to ensure\nthat excessive investment in any single company is avoided and that due attention\nis given to the maturity structure and quality of such investments.\niii) Banks should not underwrite issue of Commercial Paper by any Company or Primary\nDealer.\niv) Banks should not extend Revolving Underwriting Facility to short-term Floating Rate\nNotes/Bonds or debentures issued by corporate entities.\nv) An annual review covering the underwriting operations taken up during the year, with\ncompany-wise details of such operations, the shares/debentures devolved on the banks, the loss\n(or expected loss) from unloading the devolved shares/debentures indicating the face-value and\nmarket value thereof, the commission earned, etc. may be placed before their Boards of\nDirectors within 2 months of the close of the fiscal year.\nvi) Banks/ merchant banking subsidiaries of banks - undertaking underwriting activities- are\nalso required to comply with the guidelines contained in the SEBI (Underwriters) Rules and\nRegulations, 1993, and those issued from time to time.\n1.12.2 Underwriting of bonds of Public Sector Undertakings\nThe banks can play a useful role in relation to issue of bonds by Public Sector Undertakings\n(PSUs) by underwriting a part of these issues. Banks should subject the proposals for\nunderwriting to proper scrutiny having regard to all the relevant factors and accept such\ncommitments only on well-reasoned commercial considerations with the approval of the\nappropriate authority.\nThe banks should formulate their own internal guidelines as approved by their Boards of\nDirectors on investments in and underwriting of PSU bonds, including norms to ensure that\nexcessive investment in any single PSU is avoided and that due attention is given to the maturity\nstructure of such investments. Banks would also need to take into account that such investments\nare subject to risk weight and necessary depreciation has to be fully provided for. Such\ninvestments in PSU bonds including shares and debentures and subscription to Commercial\nPapers of PSUs should be reckoned for the purpose of arriving at prudential norms of credit\nexposure for single borrower and group of borrowers.\nBanks should undertake an annual review of the underwriting operations relating to bonds of the\npublic sector undertakings, with PSU-wise details of such operations, bonds devolved on the\nbanks, the loss (or expected loss) from unloading the devolved bonds indicating the face-value10\nand market value thereof, the commission earned, etc. and place the same before their Boards of\nDirectors within two months from the close of the fiscal year.\nWith a view to enabling the banks to deploy their surplus funds more remuneratively, the banks\nwill have the freedom to acquire PSU bonds including through underwriting devolvements\nwithout any ceiling.\n1.12.3  'Safety Net' Schemes\nReserve Bank had observed that some banks/their subsidiaries were providing buy-back facilities\nunder the name of \u2018Safety Net\u2019 Schemes in respect of certain public issues as part of their\nmerchant banking activities. Under such schemes, large exposures are assumed by way of\ncommitments to buy the relative securities from the original investors at any time during a\nstipulated period at a price determined at the time of issue, irrespective of the prevailing market\nprice. In some cases, such schemes were offered suo motto  without any request from the\ncompany whose issues are supported under the schemes. Apparently, there was no undertaking\nin such cases from the issuers to buy the securities. There is also no income commensurate with\nthe risk of loss built into these schemes, as the investor will take recourse to the facilities offered\nunder the schemes only when the market value of the securities falls below the pre-determined\nprice.  Banks/their subsidiaries have therefore been advised that they should refrain from offering\nsuch \u2018Safety Net\u2019 facilities by whatever name called.\n1.13 Annexure - I\n[Paragraph 1.8.2]\nThe guidelines for the Issue of the Smart Cards/Debit Cards by banks\n1 Coverage:\nThe guidelines apply to the smart cards/cards encompassing all or any of the following\noperations \u2013\n\u00d8 Electronic payment involving the use of card, in particular at point of sale and such other\nplaces where a terminal/device for the use/access of the card is placed.\n\u00d8 The withdrawing of bank notes, the depositing of bank notes and cheques and connected\noperations in electronic devices such as cash dispensing machines and ATMs.\n\u00d8 Any card or a function of a card which contains real value in the form of electronic\nmoney which someone has paid for in advance, some of which can be reloaded with\nfurther funds or one which can connect to the cardholder\u2019s bank account (on-line) for\npayment through such account and which can be used for a range of purposes.11\n2.  Cash Withdrawals\nNo cash transaction, that is, cash withdrawals or deposits should be offered at the Point of Sale,\nwith the smart/debit cards under any facility, without prior authorization of RBI under Section 23\nof the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n3.  Eligibility of Customers:\nThe banks can issue smart (both on-line and off-line)/on-line debit cards to select customers with\ngood financial standing even if they have maintained the accounts with the banks for less than\nsix months subject to their ensuring the implementation of 'Know Your Customer' concept as\nstipulated in para 9.2 of the Report of the Study Group on Large Value Bank Frauds forwarded\nvide circular No.DBS . FGV.BC.56/23.04.001/98-99 dated 21st June 1999. However, banks\nintroducing off-line mode of operation of debit cards should adhere to the minimum period of\nsatisfactory maintenance of accounts for six months. Banks can extend the smart card/ debit card\nfacility to those having saving bank account/current account/fixed deposit accounts with built-in\nliquidity features maintained by individuals, corporate bodies and firms.  Smart card/debit card\nfacility should not be extended to cash credit/loan account holders. The banks can, however,\nissue on-line debit cards against personal loan accounts, where operations through cheques are\npermitted.\n4.  Treatment of Liability:\nThe outstanding balances/unspent balances stored on the smart/debit cards shall be subject to the\ncomputation for the purpose of maintenance of reserve requirements.  This position will be\ncomputed on the basis of the balances appearing in the books of the bank as on the date of\nreporting.\n5.  Payment of Interest:\nIn case of smart cards having stored value (as in case of the off-line mode of operation of the\nsmart card), no interest may be paid on the balances transferred to the smart cards.  In case of\ndebit cards or on line smart cards, the payment of interest should be in accordance with the\ninterest rate directives issued to banks from time to time under Sections 21 and 35A of the\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949.\n6.  Security and other aspects:\n(a) The bank shall ensure full security of the smart card.  The security of the smart card shall\nbe the responsibility of the bank and the losses incurred by any party on account of breach of\nsecurity , failure of the security mechanism shall be borne by the bank.\n(b) No bank shall despatch a card to a customer unsolicited, except in the case where the card\nis a replacement for a card already held by the customer.12\n(c) Banks shall keep for a sufficient period of time, internal records to enable operations to\nbe traced and errors to be rectified (taking into account the law of limitation for the time barred\ncases).\n(d) The cardholder shall b e provided with a written record of the transaction after he has\ncompleted it, either immediately in the form of receipt or within a reasonable period of time in\nanother form such as the customary bank statement.\n(e) The cardholder shall bear the loss sus tained up to the time of notification to the bank of\nany loss, theft or copying of the card but only up to a certain limit (of fixed amount or a\npercentage of the transaction agreed upon in advance between the cardholder and the bank),\nexcept where the cardholder acted fraudulently, knowingly or with extreme negligence.\n(f) Each bank shall provide means whereby his customers may at any time of the day or\nnight notify the loss, theft or copying of their payment devices.\n(g) On receipt of notification of the  loss, theft or copying of the card, the bank shall take all\naction open to it to stop any further use of the card.\n7.  Terms and Conditions for issue:\nThe relationship between the bank and the card holder shall be contractual.  In case of\ncontractual relationship between the cardholder and the bank:\na) Each bank shall make available to the cardholders in writing, a set of contractual terms\nand conditions governing the issue and use of such a card.  These terms shall maintain a fair\nbalance between the interests of the parties concerned.\nb) The terms shall be expressed clearly.\nc) The terms shall specify the basis of any charges, but not necessarily the amount of\ncharges at any point of time.\nd) The terms shall specify the period within which the cardholde r\u2019s account would normally\nbe debited.\ne) The terms may be altered by the bank, but sufficient notice of the change shall be given\nto the cardholder to enable him to withdraw if he so chooses.  A period shall be specified after\nwhich time the cardholder would be deemed to have accepted the terms if he had not withdrawn\nduring the specified period.\nf)  (i)The terms shall put the cardholder under an obligation to take all appropriate steps to\nkeep safe the card and the means (such as PIN or code) which enable it to be used.\n   (ii) The terms shall put the cardholder under an obligation not to record the PIN or code, in\nany form that would be intelligible or otherwise accessible to any third party if access is gained\nto such a record, either honestly or dishonestly.\n   (iii) The terms shall put the cardholder under an obligation to notify the bank immediately\nafter becoming aware:\n\u2022 of the loss or theft or copying of the card or the means which enable it to be used;\n\u2022 of the recording on the cardholder\u2019s account of any unauthorised transaction;\n\u2022 of any error or other irregularity in the maintaining of that account by the bank.\n(iv) The terms shall specify a contact point to which such notification can be made. Such\nnotification can be made at any time of the day or night.\n(v) The terms shall put the cardholder under an obligation not to countermand an order which\nhe has given by means of his card.13\ng) The terms shall specify that the bank shall exercise care when issuing PINs or codes and\nshall be under an obligation not to disclose the cardholder\u2019s PIN or code, except to the\ncardholders.\nh) The terms shall specify that the bank shall be responsible for direct losses incurred by a\ncardholder due to a system malfunction directly within the bank\u2019s control.  However, the bank\nshall not be held liable for any loss caused by a technical breakdown of the payment system if\nthe breakdown of the system was recognizable for the cardholder by a message on the display of\nthe device or otherwise known.  The responsibility of the bank for the non-execution or defective\nexecution of the transaction is limited to the principal sum and the loss of interest subject to the\nprovisions of the law governing the terms. \nAnnexure \u2013II\n[Paragraph 1.8.2]\nReporting format for the issue and operations of the Smart Cards/Debit Cards:\n1.

Any scheduled commercial bank would be permitted to undertake insurance business as agent\nof insurance companies on fee basis, without any risk participation.  The subsidiaries of banks\nwill also be allowed to undertake distribution of insurance product on agency basis.\n2.  Banks which satisfy the eligibility criteria given below will be permitted to set up a joint\nventure company for undertaking insurance business with risk participation, subject to\nsafeguards.  The maximum equity contribution such a bank can hold in the joint venture\ncompany will normally be 50 per cent of the paid-up capital of the insurance company.  On a\nselective basis the Reserve Bank of India may permit a higher equity contribution by a promoter\nbank initially, pending divestment of equity within the prescribed period (see Note 1 below).\nThe eligibility criteria for joint venture participant are as under:\n(i) The net worth of the bank should not be less than Rs.500 crore;\n(ii) The CRAR of the bank should not be less than 10 per cent;\n(iii) The level of non-performing assets should be reasonable;\n(iv) The bank should have net profit for the last three consecutive years;\n(v) The track record of the performance of the subsidiaries, if any, of the concerned\nbank should be satisfactory.\n3.   In cases where a foreign partner contributes 26 per cent of the equity with the approval of\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority/Foreign Investment Promotion Board, more\nthan one public sector bank or private sector bank may be allowed to participate in the equity of\nthe insurance joint venture.  As such participants will also assume insurance risk, only those\nbanks which satisfy the criteria given in paragraph 2 above, would be eligible.15\n4.    A subsidiary of a bank or of another bank will not normally be allowed to join the insurance\ncompany on risk participation basis.  Subsidiaries would include bank subsidiaries undertaking\nmerchant banking, securities, mutual fund, leasing finance, housing finance business, etc.\n5.     Banks which are not eligible as joint venture participant as above, can make investments up\nto 10% of the networth of the bank or Rs.50 crore, whichever is lower, in the insurance company\nfor providing infrastructure and services support.  Such participation shall be treated as an\ninvestment and should be without any contingent liability for the bank.\nThe eligibility criteria for these banks will be as under:\n(i) The CRAR of the bank should not be less than 10%;\n(ii) The level of NPAs should be reasonable;\n(iii) The bank should have net profit for the last three consecutive years.\n6.   All banks entering into insurance business will be required to obtain prior approval of the\nReserve Bank. The Reserve Bank will give permission to banks on case to case basis keeping in\nview all relevant factors including the position in regard to the level of non-performing assets of\nthe applicant bank so as to ensure that non-performing assets do not pose any future threat to the\nbank in its present or the proposed line of activity, viz., insurance business. It should be ensured\nthat risks involved in insurance business do not get transferred to the bank and that the banking\nbusiness does not get contaminated by any risks which may arise from insurance business.  There\nshould be \u2018arms length\u2019 relationship between the bank and the insurance outfit.\nNotes: -\n1.  Holding of equity by a promoter bank in an insurance company or participation in any form in\ninsurance business will be subject to compliance with any rules and regulations laid down by the\nIRDA/Central Government.  This will include compliance with Section 6AA of the Insurance\nAct as amended by the IRDA Act, 1999, for divestment of equity in excess of 26 per cent of the\npaid up capital within a prescribed period of time.\n2.   Latest audited balance sheet will be considered for reckoning the eligibility criteria.\n3.

Meeting the legitimate\naspirations of its customers will enable the bank to maintain its image, create\nconfidence and attract funds comparatively at low cost in a competitive\nenvironment.  Ensuring improvement in the customer service rendered by the\nbanks has been the constant endeavour of RBI.  RBI had set up in 1990 a\nCommittee headed by Shri M.N.Goiporia, the then Chairman of SBI. The\nCommittee had made various recommendations to ensure improvement in the\ncustomer service in the banks. In addition, RBI has also issued various\nguidelines on the subject in general and on such specific aspects relating to\nimmediate credit for the outstation instruments sent for collection, payment of\ninterest for delay in collection of instrument, adherence of time schedule in\nsuch matters as payment to customers, issue of DDs/TTs, issue of cheque\nbooks, etc. Various instructions  issued in this  regard may be summed up as\nunder :\n(i) Instructions issued on the basis of the Goiporia Committee\n(ii) Instructions relating to collection of local / outstation instruments\n(iii) Other instructions\n2 Recommendations of the Goiporia Committee\nThe recommendations of the Committee which are required to be\nimplemented by the primary (urban) co-operative banks are as under :\n2.1    Service at the Counters\n2.1.1 Business and working hours\nThe employees are expected to be at their seats at the commencement of the\nbusiness hours and attend to all the customers who are in the branch prior to\nthe close of business hours. In practice, however, in many branches of banks,\nemployees take their own time to open the counters and also do not attend to\ncustomers who are in the queue at the close of business hours. Some banks\nwith a view to ensuring that the service to customers is made available exactly\nat the commencement of business hours fix the working hours of the staff 15\nminutes before the start of business hours. This arrangement can be made by\nall the banks at their branches in metropolitan and urban centres.\n2.1.2 There are complaints that counters are closed at the end business hours,\nwithout disposing of customers. Banks may issue instructions that all\ncustomers who enter the banking hall before the close of business hours may\nbe attended to.22.2 Extension of business hours for non cash transactions:  Staff at the counters\nmay undertake the following transactions during   the extended business hours\n(branches to indicate the timings)\n(a)     non-voucher generating transactions:\n(i) issue of passbook/statement of accounts\n(ii)    issue of cheque book\n(iii)   delivery of term deposit receipts/drafts\n(iv)   acceptance of share application form; and\n(v)    acceptance of clearing cheques/bills for collection\n      (b )     voucher generating transactions:\n(i) issue of term deposit receipts ( TDR)\n(ii) acceptance of cheques for locker rent due;\n(iii) issue of travellers cheques\n(iv) issue of gift cheques\n(v)    acceptance of individual cheques for transfer credit\n2.3 Uninterrupted Service\nBanks may devise appropriate procedures to ensure that no counter remains\nunattended during the business hours and uninterrupted service is rendered to\nthe customers by making adequate relief arrangements as may be necessary.\n2.4       Guidance to Customers\nAll branches, except very small ones, should have \" Enquiry\" or \"May I help\nyou\" counters. Such counters may exclusively attend to enquiries or may be\ncombined with other functions depending upon the requirement. As far as\npossible, such counters should be near the entry point to the banking hall.\n2.5 Deposit and other Accounts\n2.5.1 Nomination facilities\nBanks may get the account opening forms amended to incorporate a space to\nmention the name and address of the nominee and statutorily prescribed\nnomination forms may be obtained and preserved with the account opening\nforms. Availability of nomination facility needs to be widely publicised by\nprinting compatible messages on cheque books/pass books and any other\nliterature reaching the customers.\nNomination should be a rule (rather than an exception) and banks should\nendeavor to cover all accounts, existing as well as new, under nomination,\nexception being the ones where the customer himself would prefer not to3nominate; this fact may be recorded rather than left to the conjecture of non-\ncompliance\n2.5.2 Nomination facilities are available not only for deposit accounts but also for\nsafe custody articles and safe deposit lockers. As nomination facility for\ndeposit accounts is more known to the customers, compared to the one\navailable for safe custody articles and safe deposit lockers, publicising\navailability of the facility for these two services also may be effectively done.\n2.5.3 Savings bank passbooks/statement of accounts\n(a) Banks may devise controls to ensure that the passbooks are updated on\nan ongoing basis, and complete and correct particulars are written in a\nlegible    hand\n(b) Customers also need to be educated to submit the passbooks regularly\nfor  updating\n(c) Banks may take the following steps to provide customer satisfaction in\nthese areas :\n(i)  Customer education drives may be launched to bring home the\nadvantages of getting the passbooks updated regularly /\nperiodically.\n (ii)  Employees may be exhorted to attach importance to this area to\nprovide customer satisfaction.\n(iii)   As a rule, passbooks may be updated immediately on submission.\nIf updating is not possible immediately due to a large number of\nentries, then paper tokens be issued for collection of passbooks on\nthe next day.\n2.5.4 Term deposits\n (a) Banks have made considerable innovations in the area of term deposits.\nVarious innovative schemes have been introduced to suit customer\nrequirements. However, customer awareness of the different schemes and\nfacilities thereunder is actually lacking. Banks should therefore ensure that\nvarious term deposit schemes are made known to the customers through\nproper publicity and advice. The customers need also be informed specifically\nof the provision of monthly interest on term deposits at a discounted rate and\nthe facility of safe custody of term deposit receipts.\n(b) Term deposit application forms may be so devised as to contain a direction\nfor disposal of deposits on maturity. In those cases where the customer does\nnot indicate the course of action by the bank on maturity of deposits, banks4may as a rule send intimation of impending due date of the deposit well in\nadvance.\n2.5.5     Advisory Services on deposit schemes\nThere is room for providing customer satisfaction by assisting customers in\ntaking proper decisions for investment in various deposit schemes having\nregard to their particular needs and expectations. The banks should provide\nassistance/guidance to customers in the area of investment of funds in the\nvarious deposit schemes vis-\u00e0-vis the requirement of the customers.\n2.5.6 Brochures/pamphlets for guidance of customers\nBanks may make available to the customers brochures/pamphlets in regional\nlanguage/Hindi /English giving details of various schemes available and terms\nand conditions thereof. Such brochures may also contain, among others, do's\nand don'ts for smooth handling of day-to-day banking transactions, e.g.\nupdating of passbooks, preferably in the leaner weeks of the month, say,\nthird/fourth week, advantages of maintaining joint accounts and nomination,\nkeeping the term deposit receipts in safe custody with the banks with\ninstructions for disposal on maturity etc\n2.6 Safe deposit lockers\nBanks should provide more and more locker facilities, especially in residential\nareas, having regard to commercial viability.\n2.7 Dishonoured instruments\nBanks may ensure that dishonoured instrument is returned/ despatched to the\ncustomer promptly without delay on the same day but in any case within 24\nhours.\n2.8 Reimbursement of interest by paying bank\nWhile in terms of extant instructions, interest for delayed credit is to be paid\nand borne by collecting bank alone, it is a fact that on many occasions delay in\ncollection of cheques takes place due to the neglect on the part of the paying\nbank. It is only fair that when such delays can be attributed to the paying\nbank, it compensates the collecting bank by reimbursing the amount. For this\npurpose, delay beyond two days on the part of paying bank in despatching the\nproceeds to the collecting bank may be treated as delay attributable to that\nbank. Responsibility for payment of interest to the lodger of the cheque,\nhowever, should continue to remain that of the collecting bank.\nWork  Culture, Discipline and Attitude\n2.9 Identity ba dges\nEach employee may wear on his person, identity badge with photograph and\nname prominently displayed on it. Besides giving an official touch, it will\ncreate a better rapport with the customers.52.10 Job enrichment\nMuch of the indifference and casual approach towards customer service can\nbe attributed to job monotony and the work environment. In order to promote\ngreater involvement of employees in their work and to prevent alienation, job\nenrichment in the form of periodic change of department and allocation of\njobs carrying higher responsibilities is necessary. Elementary checking\nfunctions such as authentication of pass books/ issuance of receipts for\ncheques deposited for credit to the customers' accounts etc., would not only\nmake useful contribution towards customer service but also would give a\nboost to the morale and self image of the employees.\n2.11.   Training\n    It is essential to align the training programmes to the needs in various areas\nwith an eye on customer service. The employees should be trained to develop\nthe right kind of attitude towards customer service, and empathy towards\ncustomer needs and expectations. Training programmes may be so devised as\nto bring about positive attitudinal changes compatible to customer orientation.\n2.12 Induction training\nTraining to new recruits should be a precursor to other follow - up training\nprogrammes. All new recruits, i.e. clerks/officers should be necessarily\nexposed to induction programme immediately after recruitment. A co-\nordinated approach amongst banks is required in this regard.\n2.13 Reward and recognition\nGood work must be rewarded. The system of reward/recognition should be\nsuch that it puts an indifferent employee to a considerable disadvantage -\npsychologically and even financially. Only if the reward scheme is objectively\nenunciated, employees will be motivated to perform better. Indifferent and\ncasual approach to work (customer service) should not go unnoticed, giving\nsuch employees wrong signals. It is but proper that disservice to customers is\ntreated as delinquency. Banks should evolve a fair system whereby employees\nare gauged or rated in the area of customer service and good work is\nrewarded. Any system that is evolved should necessarily be objective and no\nroom should be left to subjectivity of any kind. Any reward/recognition\nscheme of incentive will need to be tailored, with an eye on the ultimate goal\nof customer service.\n2.14 Systems and procedures\nSystems and procedures are necessary to assist banks in functioning in an\neffective and efficient manner and to ensure safety of customer's money.\nBanks may keep their systems and procedures in trim, by a continuous process6of introduction of new procedures that may be required and by doing away\nwith unwanted ones.\n2.15 Customer service audit\nVarious facets of service to the customers need review and introduction of\nmore avenues has to be identified. Banks may subject themselves to an audit\napproach towards their customer service points at grassroot levels and also at\npolicy prescription and macro levels in the matter of extension of customer\nservice.\n2.16 Complaint book\nA Complaint cum Suggestion Box may be kept in the bank premises at a\nprominent place. Every bank branch may also maintain a Complaint Book\nwith adequate number of perforated copies in each set, so designed as to\ninstantly provide the complainant with an acknowledged copy of the\ncomplaint.\n2.17 Inspection/Audit reports\nThe internal inspectors/auditors including audit firms engaged for the purpose\nduring the course of their inspection/audit of branches should examine the\nvarious customer service aspects including the efficacy of the complaints\nhandling and grievance redressal  machinery; and based on their observations,\nrecord the improvements and deficiencies in various areas\n2.18 Complaint prone employees\nPlacement of employees in customer contact slots should be on a selective\nbasis. By imaginative and innovative approaches, enough number of\nemployees can be brought-up by training. Cases of deliberate recalcitrance\nand disregard of customer service spirit should be taken note of and kept in\nconcerned employees' service records apart from taking other action against\nsuch employees.\n2.19 Periodical visits by senior officials\nSenior officials while visiting the branches should also give priority to the\ncustomer service aspects. It will be great advantage if senior official counter\nchecks the actual \"branch atmosphere\" by having in hand a report on customer\nservice submitted by the branch.\n2.20 Infrastructure provision\nBanks may bestow attention to providing adequate space, proper furniture,\ndrinking water facilities, clean environment, (which include keeping the walls\nfree of posters) etc, in their premises to enable conduct of banking\ntransactions smoothly and more comfortably.\n2.21 Customer education7Customer education both in regard to rights and responsibilities in dealing\nwith banks should be viewed as a fundamental issue in any attempt to improve\ncustomer service. Customer should be made aware not only of the various\nschemes and services offered by banks, but also about the formalities,\nprocedures, legal requirements and limitations in the matter of providing\nservices by the banks, through a proper mix of advertisements, literature,\ninterface, seminars, etc. Banks should involve their employees in all customer\neducation programmes.\n2.22 Security arrangements\nIn view of the incidents involving terrorists/ decoits, banks should review and\nimprove upon the existing security system in branches so as to instil\nconfidence amongst the employees and the public. Regular drill/ training to\nthe security staff should be ensured.\n2.23 Display of time norms\nTime norms for specified business transactions should be displayed\nprominently in the banking hall so that it attracts the customers' attention as\nwell as that of the employees for adherence.\n3 Immediate Credit of Local/Outstation Cheques\n3.1.      Local/Outstation Cheques upto Rs. 5,000\nAll primary (urban) co-operative banks should afford immediate credit for all\nlocal/outstation cheques upto the value of Rs. 5,000 tendered by individual\naccount holders, provided they are satisfied about proper conduct of the\naccounts. These arrangements should be scrupulously followed. The banks\nshould not wait for customers' requests for the facility but should, as a matter\nof normal course, provide this service. However, in respect of local cheques,\nthe banks may extend the facility of affording immediate credit upto Rs. 5,000\nto customers who wish to avail of the facility and are prepared to bear charges\nof Rs. 5 per instrument.  In respect of outstation cheques the banks may\nrecover usual collection charges in respect of outstation cheques.\nIn case the cheques are returned unpaid, the bank can recover normal rate of\ninterest at the Minimum Lending Rate for the period it is out of funds, For this\npurpose, banks may consider introducing pay-in-slips superimposing a notice\nto the effect that in the event of dishonour of the cheque, customer will be\nsubject to payment of normal rate of interest for the period till the bank was\nout of funds.\nScheduled UCBs may afford immediate credit for all local/outstation cheques\nupto the value of Rs. 7,500 tendered by individual account holders provided8they are satisfied about proper conduct of the accounts and subject to\ncompliance with other conditions mentioned above.\n3.2      Other Outstation Cheques upto Rs. 10,000\n3.2.1 In the four metropolitan centres having MICR  cheque clearing system,\nproceeds of a cheque drawn on a bank located at any of the other three\nmetropolitan centres and presented for collection on any day in a week should\nbe credited latest on the same day in the following week (for example,\nMonday to next Monday). Such a facility should be extended to the customers\neven if the collection advices are not received from the drawee centres.\n3.2.2 In respect of State Capital centres and at other centres with more than 100\nbank offices, credit to the customer's account should be given within 10 days\nwith full freedom to the customer to withdraw the amounts. This facility\nshould also be extended to the customers, even if the collection advices are\nnot received from the drawee centres.\n3.2.3 Further, there should be no additional charge for such time bound\ncollection/payment schedules. In case the cheques are returned unpaid, the\nbanks could charge interest at the commercial rate on the overdrawn amounts\nfrom the date of allowing the withdrawal till the amounts are reimbursed.\n3.2.4   In order to limit the risks involved, the facility of giving credit to the accounts\nfor outstation cheques may be extended to satisfactorily operated accounts\nupto a maximum amount of Rs. 10,000. Where more than one cheque and/or\ncheques of the value of more than Rs. 10,000 are deposited for collection in a\nday or on subsequent days, withdrawal as per above instructions may be\nallowed upto a maximum of Rs. 10,000/- so that at any point of time, the\ncollecting bank will have an exposure for amount not exceeding Rs. 10,000\nagainst any individual customer. It may, however, be mentioned that in\nrespect of instruments of the value of more than Rs.10 ,000, it should be\nensured that these are collected with least delay and the branches take prompt\naction for their despatch and realisation.\n3.3     Local Cheques\nThe customers' accounts in the normal course should be credited and they\nshould be allowed use of funds latest on the third working day from the date\nof acceptance of the cheques at the counters.\n3.4  Implementation and Accountability\n3.4.1   In order to ensure that the above time schedule is scrupulously followed by\nthe branches, there needs to be a clear-cut staff accountability for the delay.9For this purpose, special register may be introduced to record the delayed\ncollections for necessary action.\n3.4.2  Further, it should be ensured that where delays occur, the account holders are\npaid penal interest without their making requests therefor. Necessary instructions may\nbe issued to the branches with a view to ensuring strict compliance of these\ninstructions for automatic credit of interest in respect of delayed collection of\noutstation cheques so as to avoid any room for representations/ complaints from\npublic.\n3.5      Payment of Interest for Delay in collection\n            of Outstation Cheques / Instruments\n3.5.1 In all cases of delay in collection of outstation cheques and other instruments,\nthe banks are required to pay interest at savings bank rate for delayed\ncollection of outstation cheques/instruments drawn either on their own\noutstation branches or on outstation branches of other ( drawee ) banks and sent\nfor collection, if the proceeds are not realised/credited to the customers'\naccounts or the unpaid instruments are not returned to customers within a\nperiod of 14 days from the date of their lodgement.\n3.5.2 If the delay in collection of outstation cheques/instruments is beyond 10 days\nin the case of cheques lodged at and drawn on State Head Quarters except the\nState Capitals of North Eastern Region and Sikkim  and beyond 14 days in all\nother cases, banks should pay interest @ 2% p.a. over savings bank rate.\n3.5.3 Interest payable should be paid/credited to all types of accounts of the\ncustomers without the customers having to claim it. Such interest may,\nhowever, be paid only when the amount is Rs. 5 or more.\n3.5.4 However, where the proceeds of instruments are to be credited to the cash\ncredit, overdraft or loan accounts, with a view to compensating such\ncustomers equitably, the banks should pay interest at the Minimum Lending\nRate stipulated by the banks, from time to time, for the period of delay in\ncollection of outstation instruments beyond the normal period indicated above.\nSince the proceeds of outstation instruments are for credit to borrowal\naccounts, loss of interest to them for the delayed remittance is at the rate\nstipulated by the banks for such accounts.\n3.6      Additional Measures for Quicker\n           Collection of Outstation Instruments\n3.6.1 Primary (urban) co-operative banks should initiate the following additional\nmeasures to reduce the time taken for realisation of cheques:103.6.2 Cheques drawn on MICR centres should invariably be presented through\nNational Clearing Cell.\n3.6.3 Extensive use should be made of modern telecommunication technology for\nnetworking service branches in important centres and between service\nbranches and other branches within a particular centre.\n3.6.4 The concept of Quick/Fast collection service for collection of outstation\ninstruments should be streamlined.\n3.6.5 Separate registers should be mainta ined for local cheques and outstation\ncheques to enable the branch managers to exercise better supervision and\nremedial measures should be initiated to speed up the collection of outstation\ninstruments.\n3.6.6 With a view to closely monitoring the implem entation of these instructions,\nInternal Inspection Teams may be advised to verify these aspects during\nInspection of the branches, as this is a singular feature having a direct bearing\non rendering improved customer service.\n3.6.7    It is also necessary to make customers aware of the above facilities. The banks\nmay, therefore, make arrangements to display information about the facilities\navailable at the branches, for customers' knowledge.\n4 Other instructions\n4.1 Issue of Cheque Books\nBanks should en sure that their cheque books are printed with due care and the\nperforation in the cheque leaves as also binding of cheque books are upto the\nmark so as to avoid any inconvenience to the customers.\n4.2 Term Deposit Maturity Intimation in Advance\n4.2.1 Banks are required to include in the term deposit application form, a  direction\nfor payment of deposits on maturity.\n4.4.2 In addition to the above, the banks should also ensure to send, as a rule, an\nintimation for maturity dates of term deposits well in advance to their\ndepositors in order to extend better customer service.\n4.3 Maintenance of Complaint Book\nIn terms of recommendation 3.67 of the Goiporia Committee, banks are\nrequired to maintain a Complaint Book with adequate number of perforated\ncopies so as to instantly provide the complainant with an acknowledgement11copy.

The matter has been reexamined by us keeping in view the\ndefinition of residential status in terms of Section 2(v)( i) of Foreign Exchange\nManagement Act ( FEMA ). Under Section 2(v)( i) of the FEMA, \u201c\u2019person resident in\nIndia\u2019  means- ( i)  a person residing in India for more than one hundred and eighty-\ntwo days during the course of the preceding financial year but does not include \u2013\n(A) a person who has gone out of India or who stays outside India, in either case \u2013\n(a) for or on taking up employment outside India, or\n(b) for carrying on outside India a business or vocation outside India, or\n(c) for any other purpose, in such circumstances as would indicate his\nintention to stay outside India for an uncertain period;\u201d\n2. It is obs erved from the representations that when students leave India for\nprosecuting a course of specified duration, such stay outside India exceeds the period\nofficially intended for various reasons.  While taking up studies, or further advance\ncourses, students may have to take up job or seek scholarships to supplement income\nto meet their financial requirements abroad.  As they have to earn and learn, their stay\nfor educational purposes gets prolonged than what is intended while leaving India.\n3. Furthermore,  the purport of their argument is that though they are students,\nthey are, in reality, not dependent for a dominant part of their expenses on remittances2\nfrom their households in India. Often they are permitted to work and have to\nundertake certain related financial transactions.  They urge, therefore, that the\ndefinition needs to be revised.\n4. Having regard to the circumstances stated above, it is clear that on both counts\nviz. their stay abroad for more than 182 days in the preceding financial year and their\nintention to stay outside India for an uncertain period when they go abroad for their\nstudies, they can be treated as Non-Resident Indians ( NRIs ).\n5. As non-residents, they will in any case be eligible for receiving remittances\nfrom India ,  as follows : ( i) up to USD 100,000 from close relatives from India on\nself-declaration towards maintenance, which could include remittances towards their\nstudies also, (ii)  up to USD 1 million out of sale proceeds/balances in their account\nmaintained with an AD in India, (iii) all other facilities available to NRIs under\nFEMA, (iv) educational and other loans availed of by students as resident in India\nwhich can be allowed to continue as per provisions of Notification No. 4/2000-RB\ndated May 3, 2000.\n6.       It is clarified that these instructions do not dilute in any way the utilisation of\nthe existing foreign exchange remittance facilities to students in regard to their\nacademic pursuits.\n7 Necessary amendments to the Foreign Exchange Management Regulations,\n2000 are being issued separately.\n8.

With a view t o simplifying and liberalising the procedure, providing full flexibility to all\nexporters and reducing the paper work associated with seeking extension of time or reduction in\ninvoice value or write-off, it has been decided to allow all exporters (including Status Holder)\nto : -\n(i) write-off (including reduction in invoice value) outstanding export dues, and\n(ii) extend the prescribed  period of realisation beyond 180 days or further period as\napplicable,\nprovided , the aggregate value of such export bills written-off (including reduction in invoice\nvalue) and bills extended for realisation does not exceed 10 per cent of the export proceeds due\nduring the calendar year and such export bills are not a subject of investigation by Enforcement\nDirectorate / Central Bureau of Investigation or any other Investigating Agencies. This facility\nwill be available in respect of export proceeds falling due from January 1, 2004.  In other\nwords, the new facility will be available for exports made after July 1, 2003 and proceeds due\nfor realisation on January 1, 2004 ( ie., within the prescribed period of 180 days).  In the case of\nexports where Reserve Bank has prescribed longer period of realisation ,  the said facility would\nbe available for exports made prior to July 2003,  but proceeds of which are  due for realisation\nwithin the prescribed period of one year.\n3. Exporters dealing with more than one Authorised Dealer can avail of this facility through\neach AD, i..e., the limit of 10 per cent for self write-off (including reduction in invoice value)\nand extension of time for realisation of export proceeds would be applicable for export bills\nlodged for realisation with that Authorised Dealer. However, exporters operating under a\nconsortium of banks or with multiple banks will also have the option of computing the 10 per\ncent limit on an aggregate basis with all the banks, provided the lead bank of the consortium or2\nin case of multiple banking, a nodal bank   undertakes to verify the exporters\u2019 annual\nperformance on behalf of all the banks.\n4. Within a month from the close of the calendar year, exporters should submit a statement,\nas per enclosed format, giving details of export proceeds due ,  realised and   not realised to the\nconcerned Authorised Dealer.  Export bills due in the year 2004, for which exporter has extended\nthe period  of realisation on his own (within the 10 per cent limit) or sought extension of time\nfrom the Authorised Dealer but unrealised as at the end of calendar year 2004, will be computed\nfor export proceeds due in the following year.  The Authorised  Dealer will be required to verify\nthe statement with his records and review the export performance of the exporter during the\ncalendar year to ascertain that in cases where the 10 per cent limit of self extension, write-off\n(including reduction in invoice value) and non- realisation  has been breached, exporter has sought\nnecessary approval for write-off, reduction in invoice value or extension of time, as the case may\nbe, for the excess over the 10 per cent limit before the end of the calendar year.  In cases where\nexporters have failed to comply with this requirement, Authorised  Dealers may promptly advise\nthe said exporter to seek extension of time/reduction in invoice value/write-off in respect of non-\nrealisation  in excess of the 10 per cent limit, failing which, the Authorised  Dealers may inform\nthe exporter about the withdrawal of this facility of self write-off / extension of time, within a\nmonth , under advice to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank.\n5. Requests received from exporters in terms of Paragraph 4 above may be dealt with by the\nAuthorised Dealers as per the existing instructions relating to extension of time for realisation of\nexport proceeds, reduction in invoice value and write-off issued by the Reserve Bank.\n6. Regarding disposal of GR/SOFTEX /SDF/PP forms under the above facility, Authorised\nDealers may release the respective forms relating to the write-off (including reduction in invoice\nvalue) by the exporter himself, provided the exporter submits evidence to the Authorised\nDealer  for surrender of export  incentives  availed of, if any, along with the annual statement.\nIn the case of export bills extended for realisation by the exporter within the 10 per cent limit,\nAuthorised Dealers may report such bills as outstanding in the  XOS statement with the remark\n\"extended by the exporter\".\n7.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of\nGovernment securities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d\nbasis in select  auctions of dated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-\ncompetitive bids up to 5 percent  of the notified amount will be accepted in the\nauctions of dated securities. The reserved amount will be within the notified\namount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated\nGOI securities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL)\naccount with the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions:  Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks shall be\ncovered under this Scheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single bid for an amount not more than Rs. two crore (face value) per\nauction\n3.  submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks that   maintain\nSGL account and current account with the Reserve Bank of India shall be eligible to\nsubmit their non competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI.\nThe minimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in\nmultiples in Rs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent\nsubsidiary general ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they\nwish to participate. However, an investor can make only a single bid under thisscheme. An undertaking to the effect that the investor is making only a single bid will\nhave to be obtained and kept on record by the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for\nthe aggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz.\nname, amount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at\nthe weighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of\nthe competitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against\npayment on the date of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received\npayment from their clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of\nnotified amount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it\nwill be the responsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their\nclients in a transparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount,\nthe shortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either\nthe main SGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them.\nThe facility for affording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of\nservicing investors who are not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would\nhave to indicate clearly at the time of tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts\n(face value ) to be credited to their SGL account and the CSGL account. Delivery in\nphysical form from the main SGL account is permissible at the instance of the investor\nsubsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to\ntheir clients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the\nclients shall be completed within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such\ncosts may be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case\nthe transfer of securities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the\nconsideration amount payable by the client to the bank or PD would also include\naccrued interest from the date of issue.9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities,\naccrued interest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may\nbe worked out by the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that\nno other costs such as funding costs should be built into the price or recovered from\nthe client.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to operations\nunder the Scheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for from time\nto time within the time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and accordingly,\nif and when considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/40466.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Dec 02, 2003", "info": "Tender for Non-competitive Bids\n(Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding Facility in Auctions of Government\nSecurities)\n                                                         Annexure I (a)\n                                                         For office use only\nThe Regional Director,                     |------------------|\nReserve Bank of India,                     | Regn no.          |\nPublic Debt Office,                        |                  |\nFort,                                      |------------------|\nMumbai - 400 001.\nDear Sir,\nTender for Non-competitive Bids for \u201c6.01 per cent Government\nStock 2028\u201d for an aggregate amount of Rs.250 crore: Auction to\nbe held on December 4, 2003.\n    \n        Pursuant to Government of India, Ministry of Finance,\nDepartment of Economic Affairs Notification No F.No.4(8)\nW&M/2003 dated December 2, 2003 and the tender notice issued by\nyou, I/we, the undersigned hereby submit an aggregated bid on\nbehalf of the non-competitive bidders as per the enclosed list\nin pursuance of the \u2018 Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding\nFacility in the Auctions of Government Securities\u2019 at the\nauction to be held by you on the captioned date as set out\nbelow:\ni)   Name  of the Bank/Primary Dealer  /-------------------\\\nii)   Address                          /-------------------\\\niii)  Telephone No.                    \\-------------------/\niv)\nUnde\nrtak\ning\n1. \nO\nn\n your acceptance of my/our bid,\ni) I/we agree/undertake to immediately collect the letter of\nacceptance from your office and to deposit the requisite\namount at Reserve Bank of India, Fort, Mumbai on the\nday/time as indicated therein.\nii) I/We authorise you to debit my/our Current account\nmaintained with Reserve Bank of India with the requisite\namount.\n2.

As you are aware, State Co-operative Banks and\nDistrict Central Co-operative Banks are permitted to invest their genuine non- SLR surplus funds\nin  certain avenues subject to the terms and  conditions laid down from time to time. Paragraph\n133 of the Statement on Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2002- 03  emphasized that banks\nshould observe further prudence in order to contain the risk arising out of non- SLR investment\nportfolio of banks.\n2. SEBI has since advised the guidelines required to be complied with by listed companies\nmaking issue of debt securities on a private placement basis and listed on al stock exchange vide\ncircular SEBI/MRD/SE/AT/36/2003/30/9 dated September 30, 2003.\n3. In order to contain the risks arising out of non- SLR investment portfolio of banks, in particular\nthrough private placement, we enclose in the Annex  the draft guidelines proposed to be issued by\nthe Reserve Bank on banks\u2019 investment in non- SLR debt securities which, inter alia, covering\nthe following:\ni) the need for strengthening the internal rating systems,\nii) fixing prudential limits,\niii) review by the Board, and\niv) disclosures in \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 to the balance sheet.2\n4. A copy of the draft guidelines are also placed on the Reserve Bank website ( www.rbi.org.in ).\nYou may please furnish your feedback on the above draft guidelines within a week from the date\nof this letter to enable us to finalise the proposed guidelines.\nYours faithfully,\n(C.S. Murhty)\nChief General Manager In-charge\nAnnex\nGuidelines on investments by SCBs and DCCBs\nin Non- SLR Debt Securities\nCoverage\n1. These guidelines cover banks\u2019 investments in Non- SLR debt instruments / securities issued by\ncorporates, banks, All India Financial Institutions  and State and Central Government sponsored\ninstitutions,  etc. The guidelines will apply to investments both in the primary market as well as\nthe secondary market. It may be noted that banks should not invest in Non- SLR debt securities of\noriginal maturity of less than one-year other than  Certificates of Deposits which are covered\nunder RBI guidelines .\n2. Definitions of a few terms used in these guidelines have been furnished in Appendix I  with a\nview to ensure uniformity in approach while implementing the guidelines.\nRegulatory requirements\n3. Banks should undertake usual due diligence in respect of investments in non- SLR securities.\nPresent RBI regulations preclude banks from extending credit facilities for certain purposes.\nBanks should ensure that such activities are not financed by way of funds raised through the non-\nSLR securities.\n4. Banks must not invest in unrated debt securities and unlisted shares of All India financial\nInstitutions.\n5. The Securities Exchange Board of India ( SEBI) vide their circular dated September 30, 2003\nhave stipulated requirements that listed companies are required to comply with for making issue\nof debt securities on a private placement basis and listed on a stock exchange. According to this\ncircular any listed company, making issue of debt securities on a private placement basis and\nlisted on a stock exchange, has to make full disclosures (initial and continuing) in the manner\nprescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act 1956, SEBI  (Disclosure and Investor Protection)\nGuidelines, 2000 and the Listing Agreement with the exchanges. Furthermore, the debt securities\nshall carry a credit rating of not less than investment grade from a Credit Rating Agency\nregistered with the SEBI.   Banks should ensure that they make all fresh Non- SLR debt3\ninvestments only in listed debt securities of public sector undertakings  which comply with the\nrequirements of the SEBI circular dated September 30, 2003.\nInternal assessments\n6.  Since non- SLR securities are mostly in the form of credit substitutes, banks are  advised  to ( i)\nsubject all their investment proposals relating to non- SLR securities to credit appraisal on par\nwith their credit proposals, irrespective of the fact that the proposed investments may be in rated\nsecurities, (ii) make their own internal credit analysis and rating even in respect of rated issues\nand that they should not entirely rely on the ratings of external agencies, and (iii) strengthen their\ninternal rating systems which should also include building up of a system of regular (quarterly or\nhalf-yearly) tracking of the financial position of the issuer with a view to ensuring continuous\nmonitoring of the rating migration of the issuers/issues.\nFixing of prudential limits\n7.  The Board of Directors of banks should fix a prudential limit for their total investment in non- SLR\nsecurities subject to existing limits prescribed by RRBI and sub-limits for the following debt\nsecurities:\na) bonds of public sector undertakings\nb) bonds / equity of All India Financial Institutions( AFIs)\nThe total investment in (a) and (b) above should not exceed 10 per cent of the banks total\ndeposits  as on March 31, of the previous year, with a sub-ceiling of 5 per cent for investments\ncovered under (a).\n8. Banks which have exposure to investments in non- SLR securities in excess of the prudential limit\nprescribed above as on 31st March 2003 should not make any fresh investment in such securities\ntill they ensure compliance with the above prudential limit.\n9. As a matter of prudence, banks should stipulate entry-level minimum rating s/ quality standards\nand industry-wise, maturity-wise, duration-wise, issuer-wise etc. limits to mitigate the adverse\nimpacts of concentration and the risk of illiquidity.\nRole of Boards\n10. Banks should ensure that their investment policies duly approved  by the Board of Directors are\nformulated after taking into account all the relevant issues specified in these guidelines on non-\nSLR investment. Banks should put in place proper risk management systems for capturing and\nanalysing the risk in respect of non- SLR investment and taking remedial measures in time.\nBanks should also put in place appropriate systems to ensure that investment in privately placed\ninstruments is made in accordance with the systems and procedures prescribed under respective\nbank\u2019s investment policy.\n11. The Board should devise a system to ensure that the limits prescribed in paragraphs 8 and 9\nabove are scrupulously complied.  The Boards should appropriately address the issue of ensuring\ncompliance with the prudential limits on an ongoing basis, including breaches, if any, due to\nrating migration.4\n12. Boards of banks should review the following aspects of non- SLR investment twice a year:\na) Total business (investment and divestment) during the reporting period\nb) Compliance with the prudential limits prescribed by the Board for non- SLR\ninvestment\nc) Rating migration of the issuers/ issues held in the bank\u2019s books and consequent\ndiminution in the portfolio quality\nd) Extent of non performing investments in the non- SLR category\nDisclosures\n13. In order to help in the creation of a central database on private placement of debt, a copy of all\noffer documents should be filed with the Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd. ( CIBIL ) by the\ninvesting banks. When banks themselves raise debt through private placement, they should also\nfile a copy of the offer document with CIBIL.  \n14. Banks should disclose the details of the issuer composition of non- SLR investments and the non-\nperforming non- SLR investments in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 of the balance sheet, as indicated in\nAppendix II.\nDemat form\n SCBs/ DCCBs should make investments in non- SLR securities in dematerialised form only.\nTrading and settlement in debt securities\n15. As per the SEBI guidelines, all trades with the exception of the spot transactions, in a listed debt\nsecurity, shall be executed only on the trading platform of a stock exchange. In addition to\ncomplying with the SEBI guidelines, banks should ensure that all spot transactions in listed and\nunlisted debt securities are reported on the NDS and settled through the CCIL from a date to be\nnotified by RBI.\nAppendix I\nGuidelines on investments by banks in non- SLR investment portfolio\nby banks \u2013 Definitions\n(Vide para 2 of the Guidelines)\n1. With a view to i mparting clarity and to ensure that there is no divergence in the implementation\nof the guidelines, some of the terms used in the guidelines are defined below.5\n2. A security will be treated as rated if it is subjected to a detailed rating exercise by an  external\nrating agency in India which is registered with SEBI and is carrying a current or valid rating. The\nrating relied upon will be deemed to be current or valid if\ni) The credit rating letter relied upon is not more than one month old on the date of\nopening of the issue, and\nii) The rating rationale from the rating agency is not more than one year old on the date\nof opening of the issue, and\niii) The rating letter and the rating rationale is a part of the offer document.\niv) In the case of secondary market acquisition, the credit rating of the issue should be in\nforce and confirmed from the monthly bulletin published by the respective rating\nagency.\nSecurities which do not have a current or valid rating by an external rating agency would be\ndeemed as unrated securities .\n3. The investment grade ratings  awarded by each of the external rating agencies operating in\nIndia would be identified by the IBA/ FIMMDA. These would also be reviewed by IBA/\nFIMMDA at least once a year.\n4. A \u2018listed\u2019 debt security is a security which is listed in a stock exchange.  If not so, it is an\n\u2018unlisted\u2019 debt security.\n5. A non performing investment  (NPI), similar to a non performing advance ( NPA), is one where\ni) Interest/ instalment (including maturity proceeds) is due and remains unpaid for\nmore than 180 days. The delinquency period would become 90 days with effect\nfrom 31st March 2004.\nii) The above would apply mutatis-mutandis to preference shares where the fixed\ndividend is not paid.\niii) In the case of equity shares, in the event the investment in the shares of any\ncompany is valued at Re.1 per company on account of the non availability of the\nlatest balance sheet , those equity shares would also be reckoned as NPI.\niv) If any credit facility availed by the issuer is NPA in the books of the bank,\ninvestment in any of the securities issued by the same issuer would also be treated\nas NPI.\nAppendix II\nPrudential guidelines on management of the non- SLR investment\nportfolio by banks \u2013 Disclosures requirements6\n(vide para 15 of the Guidelines)\nBanks should make the following disclosures in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 of the balance sheet in\nrespect of their non- SLR investment portfolio, with effect from the financial year ending 31\nMarch 2004.\ni) Issuer composition of Non SLR investments\n(Rs. in crore)\nNo.\n(1)Issuer\n(2)Amount\n(3)Extent of\nprivate\nplacement\n(4)Extent of\n\u2018below\ninvestment\ngrade\u2019\nSecurities\nalready\ninvested\n(5)Extent of\n\u2018unrated\u2019\nsecurities,\nalready\ninvested\n(6)Extent of\n\u2018unlisted\u2019\nsecurities\n(7)\n1 PSUs\n2 FIs\n3 Banks\n4 Private corporates\n5 Subsidiaries/ Joint ventures\n6 Others\n7 Provision held towards\ndepreciationX X X X X X X X X X X X\nTotal  *\nNOTE:  1.  * Total under column 3 should tally with the total of investments included\nunder the following categories in  the balance sheet:\na.

You may please furnish your feedback on the above draft guidelines within\na week from the date of this letter to enable us to finalise the proposed guidelines.\nYours faithfully,\n(C.S. Murhty)\nChief General Manager In-charge\nANNEX\nGuidelines on investments by RRBs in Non- SLR Debt Securities2\nCoverage\n1. These guidelines cover banks\u2019 investments in Non- SLR debt instruments / securities\nissued by corporates, banks, All India Financial Institutions and State and Central\nGovernment sponsored institutions, etc. The guidelines will apply to investments both in\nthe primary market as well as the secondary market. It may be noted that banks should not\ninvest in Non- SLR debt securities of original maturity of less than one-year other than\nCommercial Paper and Certificates of Deposits which are covered under RBI guidelines .\n2. Definitions of a few terms used in these guidelines have been furnished in Appendix I\nwith a view to ensure uniformity in approach while implementing the guidelines.\nRegulatory requirements\n3. Banks should undertake usual due diligence in respect of investments in non- SLR\nsecurities. Present RBI regulations preclude banks from extending credit facilities for\ncertain purposes.  Banks should ensure that such activities are not financed by way of\nfunds raised through the non- SLR securities.\n4. Banks must not invest in unrated debt securities, unlisted securities and unlisted shares of\nAll India Financial Institutions( AFIs)\n5. The Securities Exchange Board of India ( SEBI) vide their circular dated September 30,\n2003 have stipulated requirements that listed companies are required to comply with for\nmaking issue of debt securities on a private placement basis and listed on a stock\nexchange. According to this circular any listed company, making issue of debt securities\non a private placement basis and listed on a stock exchange, has to make full disclosures\n(initial and continuing) in the manner prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act\n1956, SEBI  (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 and the Listing\nAgreement with the exchanges. Furthermore, the debt securities shall carry a credit rating\nof not less than investment grade from a Credit Rating Agency registered with the SEBI.\nBanks should ensure that they make all fresh Non- SLR debt investments only in listed\ndebt securities of companies which comply with the requirements of the SEBI circular\ndated September 30, 2003.\nInternal assessments\n6. Since non- SLR securities are mostly in the form of credit substitutes, banks are  advised\nto (i) subject all their investment proposals relating to non- SLR securities to credit\nappraisal on par with their credit proposals, irrespective of the fact that the proposed\ninvestments may be in rated securities, (ii) make their own internal credit analysis and\nrating even in respect of rated issues and that they should not entirely rely on the ratings\nof external agencies, and (iii) strengthen their internal rating systems which should also\ninclude building up of a system of regular (quarterly or half-yearly) tracking of the\nfinancial position of the issuer with a view to ensuring continuous monitoring of the rating\nmigration of the issuers/issues.\nFixing of prudential limits\n7. The Board of Directors of banks should fix a prudential limit for their total investment in\nnon-SLR securities subject to existing limits prescribed by RBI and sub-limits for the\nfollowing debt securities:\na) bonds of public sector undertakings\nb) bonds / equity of All India Financial Institutions3\nc) unsecured redeemable bonds floated by nationlised banks\nd) infrastructure bonds floated by All India financial Institutions\ne) units of UTI\nThe total investments in (a) to (d) above should not exceed 10 per cent of the banks total\ndeposits as on March 31, of the previous year, with a sub-ceiling of 5 per cent of incremental\ndeposits for investments  covered under (e).\n8. Banks which have exposure to investments in non- SLR securities in excess of the\nprudential limit prescribed above as on 31st March 2003 should not make any fresh\ninvestment in such securities till they ensure compliance with the above prudential limit.\n9.As a matter of prudence, banks should stipulate entry-level minimum ratings/ quality\nstandards and industry-wise, maturity-wise, duration-wise, issuer-wise etc. limits to\nmitigate the adverse impacts of concentration and the risk of illiquidity.\nRole of Boards\n10.Banks should ensure that their investment policies duly approved by the Board of\nDirectors are formulated after taking into account all the relevant issues specified in these\nguidelines on non- SLR investment. Banks should put in place proper risk management\nsystems for capturing and analysing the risk in respect of non- SLR investment and taking\nremedial measures in time. Banks should also put in place appropriate systems to ensure\nthat investment in privately placed instruments is made in accordance with the systems\nand procedures prescribed under respective bank\u2019s investment policy.\n11.The Board should devise a system to ensure that the limits prescribed in paragraphs 7\nabove are scrupulously complied.  The Boards should appropriately address the issue of\nensuring compliance with the prudential limits on an ongoing basis, including breaches, if\nany, due to rating migration.\n12. Boards of banks should review the following aspects of non- SLR investment twice a\nyear:\na) Total business (investment and divestment) during the reporting period\nb) Compliance with the prudential limits prescribed by the Board for non- SLR\ninvestment\nc) Rating migration of the issuers/ issues held in the bank\u2019s books and consequent\ndiminution in the portfolio quality\nd) Extent of non performing investments in the non- SLR category\nDisclosures\n13. In order to help in the creation of a central database on private placement of debt, a copy\nof all offer documents should be filed with the Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd.\n(CIBIL ) by the investing banks. When banks themselves raise debt through private\nplacement, they should also file a copy of the offer document with CIBIL.\n14. Banks should disclose the details of the issuer composition of non- SLR investments and\nthe non-performing non- SLR investments in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 of the balance\nsheet, as indicated in Appendix II .\nDemat Form\n15. RRBs should make investment in non- SLR securities in dematerialised form only.4\nTrading and settlement in debt securities\n16. As per the SEBI guidelines, all trades with the exception of the spot transactions, in a\nlisted debt security, shall be executed only on the trading platform of a stock exchange. In\naddition to complying with the SEBI guidelines, banks should ensure that all spot\ntransactions in listed and unlisted debt securities are reported on the NDS and settled\nthrough the CCIL from a date to be notified by RBI.\nAppendix I\nGuidelines on investments by RRBs   in non- SLR investment portfolio  \u2013 Definitions\n(Vide para 2 of the Guidelines)\n1.

During the meeting, MOS (EB&I) expressed concern over the\npoor performance of the banks in implementation of the scheme particularly in the North India.\nThe following action points were decided during the meeting.\n(i). There is  need to advise the middle and lower level functionaries in the banks to give extra\nattention for proper implementation of the scheme. The fora like SLBCs and DLRCs, where\npeople\u2019s representatives take part, should be used for effectively monitoring the performance of\nthe scheme .The other issues raised during the meeting are indicated below.\n1. Delay in opening of bank accounts\n2. Pendency of loan applications\n3. Under-financing of the beneficiaries\n4. Delay in receipt of subsidy under the Scheme.\n5. Complex documentation process, which resulted in tardy implementation of the Scheme.\n6. Bunching of applications and their submission at the last quarter of the financial year.\n7. Gap in sanction and disbursement of loans\n8. Charging of high interest rates by the banks, which are not in tune with the declining\ntrend of rate of interest in the economy.\n9. Problems in marketing the produce by the beneficiaries and infrastructure deficienciesA reference is also invited to the minutes of the meeting circulated by Ministry of\nFinance vide their letter F.N. 3-46/2003-AC dated October 24, 2003 addressed to the\nChief Executives of Public Sector Banks.\nIn this connection we reiterate our instructions issued vide our circulars RPCD\nSP.BC.06/09.01.01/2003-04dated July 4, 2003, RPCD SP.BC.68/09.01.01/2002-03 dated\nJanuary 29, 2003 that banks should dispose of the applications within the prescribed time\nlimit of 15 days, that there is no inordinate delay/ gap between sanction and disbursement\nof loans under the scheme and to ensure that instructions issued by us percolate to the\nfield level functionaries/ bank branches. Further, banks are advised to ensure\nsimplification of documentation.\n2. It is reiterated that a greater co-ordination of work at the block level between bankers\nand Government functionaries is called for to avoid pendency of loan applications and\navoid under-financing under any circumstance as stipulated in our circular RPCD\nSP.BC.113/09.01.01/2002-03 dated July 4, 2002. As advised earlier banks should\nemphasise the need for conducting sensitisation programmes for bankers as well as for\nblock level officers, involved in the implementation of the scheme, for improving their\nperformance under the scheme. You may advise your branches/controlling offices that\nmiddle and lower level functionaries pay extra attention for proper implementation of the\nscheme and that there is no delay in opening the accounts of the beneficiaries.\n3.

LEGAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe opening of branches by banks is governed by the provisions of Section 23 of the Banking\nRegulation Act, 1949 (the Act). In terms of these provisions, banks without the prior approval\nof the RBI, cannot open a new place of business in India or abroad or change otherwise than\nwithin the same city, town or village, the location of the existing place of business.  Thus it is\nmandatory for banks to seek prior approval/ licence from RBI before opening of\nbranches/offices \u2013 Commercial banks from Department of Banking Operations and\nDevelopment, Urban Co-operative Banks from Urban Banks Department, Regional Rural\nBanks and Local Area Banks from Rural Planning and Credit Department.\n1.1   General policy on Branch Licensing  relating to Indian Scheduled Commercial\nBanks.\nThe Board of Directors of banks are required to decide on the policy and strategy for setting\nup new branches taking into account the yearly business plan, potential for business at the\nnew centres for opening of branches, profitability of the proposed branches, the efficacy of\nthe internal control system, redeployment of staff where surplus manpower has been\nidentified and for extending prompt and cost-effective customer service to the clientele.\nBanks should obtain prior approval of their Board/Committee of Directors before opening,\nshifting or closing of offices/branches etc. The proposal for opening/shifting of branches is to\nbe submitted along with the prescribed application in Form VI (Rule 12) of Banking\nRegulation (Companies Rules), 1949  to Reserve Bank of India for approval/licence.\n(Annexure I)\nRequests received from banks for opening of branches are considered by Reserve Bank of\nIndia on merits of each case and taking into consideration overall financial position of the\nbank, quality of its management, efficacy of the internal control system, profitability and\nother relevant factors.\nAfter the receipt of authorisations from Reserve Bank of India, the banks should finalise\npremises and infrastructure etc. and approach the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank\nof India for the actual licence for opening of the branch. Further, if the branch proposes to\nundertake government business it would require prior approval of concerned Government\nauthority as also of RBI, Central Office, Department of Government & Bank Accounts. The\nbranch should be opened only after obtaining a licence from Reserve Bank of India. There\nshould not be inordinate delay by banks in utilisation of authorisations / licences for opening\nof branches.\n2. OPENING OF  BRANCHES.\n2.1      General branches.32.1.1   At Rural centres.\nIt is left to the judgement of the individual banks to assess the need for opening additional\nbranches at rural centres (population less than ten thousand) within their Service Area.  The\nbanks' proposals for opening branches at rural centres are to be approved by concerned\nDistrict Consultative Committee ( DCC) and submitted to the Central Office of Department of\nBanking Operations and Development ( DBOD) for prior approval through the concerned\nState Government (Directorate of Institutional Finance). However, new private sector banks\nmay forward their proposals directly to Reserve Bank of India since these banks are required\nto open a minimum of 25% of their total branches in Rural/ Semi  Urban areas as a condition\nof the licence issued to them under Section 22 of the B.R.Act , 1949. The rural branches of\nthese banks have to accept the allocation under the Annual Credit Plan, if allocated to them\nby the respective District Consultative Committee.\n2.1.2   At Hilly and Tribal Areas.\nHaving regard to the peculiar topography in hilly/tribal areas and sparsely populated regions\nthere could still exist need for additional bank branches in such areas. Also, in States like\nBihar and North Eastern States viz Assam, Manipur, Tripura etc, the Average Population Per\nBank Office is comparatively higher and hence such areas and States should be given\npreference in opening new bank branches.\n2.1.3   At Semi-urban/Urban and Metropolitan Centres.\nThe banks can identify Semi -Urban centres (population more than ten thousand but less than\none lakh), Urban centres (population more than one lakh but less than ten lakh) and\nMetropolitan centres (population more than ten lakh) for opening of branches depending\nupon the business potential and profitability of the proposed branches. They should forward\nthe proposals together with relative Board Resolutions to Central Office of DBOD for prior\napproval. Requests from the banks for opening branches at these centres will be considered\non merits of each case.\nNote: Population criteria mentioned above will be as per latest census report figures of the\ncentre (revenue unit and not locality).\n2.2   Specialised branches.\nBanks can open the following categories of Specialised branches without prior approval but\nonly after obtaining a licence from the concerned Regional Office of RBI prior to the opening\nof these branches.\n(a) Industrial Finance branches\n(b) Overseas branches\n(c) SIB/SSI branches\n(d) Treasury branches, and\n(e) NRI branches\nThe banks should ensure that the specialised branches opened do not adversely affect the\nviability of other branches of the bank in the area. ( cf. para 3(vii) of circular DBOD\nNo.BL.BC.132/22.01.001/92 dated 20.05.1992).\nFor opening of all other categories of specialised branches, such as personal banking\nbranches, merchant banking branches, asset recovery branches etc., banks are required to4seek the prior approval of Central Office of Department of Banking Operations and\nDevelopment. ( cf. para. II of circular DBOD No.BL.BC.41 /22.01.001/92 dated 9.10.1992)\nFurther, banks have been permitted to categorise their general banking branches having 60%\nor more of their advances to SSI sector as specialised SSI branches. However, banks should\nensure that after their classification as Specialised SSI branches, non- SSI Clientele of SSI\nbranches are not put to inconvenience / deprived of banking facilities. ( cf. Circular DBOD.\nNo. BL.BC.74/22.01.001/2002 dated 11 March 2002)\nBanks are required to obtain necessary amendment to the licences from the concerned\nRegional Office immediately on classification of these branches as Specialised SSI branches.\n2.3   Housing Finance branches\nThe banks should designate one of their specific branches in each district for the purpose of\nhousing finance.  The housing finance branch so designated could also undertake other\nnormal banking functions. Banks are however required to obtain prior amendment to the\nlicence from the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India. ( para 3(VII) of circular\nDBOD No.BL.BC.132/22.01.001/92 dated 20.05.1992).\n2.4   Industrial/Project Area Branches\nProject sites, industrial areas/estates promoted by the State Governments and new markets are\nexpected to require additional bank branches. In considering these requirements, the existing\nbanking arrangements of such projects/industrial areas are to be taken into account. While\napplying for opening of branches at such centres banks are required to provide the following\ninformation:\n(a) Project description together with the estimated outlay thereon;\n(b) Stage of implementation of the project;\n(c) Deficiencies in the existing banking arrangements and whether arrangements could be\nworked out for the purpose with a nearby bank branch functioning at/near such\nproject centre;\n(d) Whether the project place falls in an existing service area; if so, the bank whose\nbranch is servicing such area;\n(e) The involvement of the banks, if any, in financing such projects;\n(f) Existing branches, if any, and the viability of the proposed branch.\n(cf para 3(iii)of circular  DBOD.No.BL.BC.16/C.168(64D)-90 dated 12-9-1990)\n2.5. Opening of Satellite Offices.\nWhere the banks do not find it viable to open branches in rural areas, they may open satellite\noffices after obtaining approval of concerned District Consultative Committee and\nDirectorate of Institutional Finance of the concerned State Government. The application for\nopening of the satellite office along with relative Board approval should be forwarded to the\nCentral Office of Department of Banking Operations and Development for prior approval.\nThe following guidelines may be followed by the banks for establishing Satellite Offices:5a) The Satellite Offices should be established at fixed premises in the surrounding villages\nand should be controlled and operated from a base branch located at a Central\nVillage/Block Head Quarters.\nb) Each Satellite Office should function on a few specified days(at least twice) in a week at\nspecified hours.\nc) All types of banking transactions may be conducted at these offices.\nd) The customers of the Satellite Offices may be permitted to transact business at the base\nbranch on non-operating days of such offices.\ne) While separate ledgers/registers/scrolls may be maintained for each Satellite Office, all\nthe transactions carried out at these offices should be incorporated in the books of account\nof the base branch.\nf) The staff attached to the base branch, preferably consisting of a member of supervisory\nstaff, a cashier-cum-clerk and an armed guard, may be deputed to the Satellite Offices.\ng) Adequate arrangements for insurance of furniture, cash-in-transit, etc. may be made.\n(cf.  circular  DBOD.No.BL.BC.72/C-168(64-D)-87 dated 14.12.1987 )\n2.6.  Service branches\nThe banks can open, without the  approval of Reserve Bank of India, Service\nbranches/Regional Collection Centres for facilitating clearing and allied work at large\ncentres. However, banks are required to obtain a licence from the concerned Regional Office\nof RBI prior to the functioning of these branches. Similarly, banks can shift or close these\noffices at their discretion without approval of RBI. In case of shifting, banks are required to\nobtain necessary amendment to the licence from the Regional Office of RBI under whose\njurisdiction the proposed location for shifting falls before the shifting of the office. In case of\nclosure of such offices, the licence has to be surrendered to the concerned Regional Office of\nRBI for cancellation immediately after the closure of the office under advice to Department\nof Statistical Analysis and Computer Services ( DESACS) of RBI. ( cf. para 3(VI) of circular\nDBOD No.BL.BC.132/22.01.001/92 dated 20.05.1992)\n2.7  Regional/Administrative/ Zonal/Controlling Offices.\nBanks may at their discretion open Regional/ Administrative/ Zonal/ Controlling offices\nwhich are not permitted to transact any banking business. However banks are required to\nobtain a licence from the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India before\nfunctioning/opening of these offices. Banks can also shift or close these offices at their\ndiscretion without approval of RBI. In case of shifting, banks are required to obtain necessary\namendment to the licence from the Regional Office of RBI under whose jurisdiction the\nproposed location for shifting falls before shifting of the concerned offices. In case of closure\nof such offices, the licence has to be surrendered to the concerned Regional Office of RBI for\ncancellation immediately after the closure of the office under advice to DESACS of RBI. ( cf.\npara 3(V) of circular DBOD No.BL.BC.132/ 22.01.001/ 92 dated 20.05.1992)\n3.  SHIFTING OF GENERAL AND SPECIALISED BRANCHES.\n3.1    At Rural Centres.\n3.1.1   Within the Block and Service Area.\nThe shifting of branches in rural centres may be effected by banks themselves without\nobtaining the approval of RBI subject to their complying with the following conditions:6 -  Both the existing and proposed  centres should be within the same Block and Service Area\nof the branch.\n - It should be ensured that the relocated branch would be able to cater adequately to the\nbanking needs of the villages allocated under Service Area Approach.\n(cf. para 3(I) of circular DBOD No.BL.BC.132/22.01.001/92 dated 20.05.1992)\nHowever, banks need to obtain amendment in the licence from the concerned Regional Office\nof RBI before effecting the shifting.\n3.1.2   Outside the Block/Service Area\nShifting of rural branches outside the Block/Service Area is allowed without insisting on the\napproval of District Consultative Committee (DCC) and State Government  at centres which\nare served by more than one commercial bank branch (excluding Regional Rural Bank\nbranch) subject to the following conditions:\na) Branches being shifted are in existence for five years or more and are incurring losses\nconsecutively for the last three years.\nb) Branches located at centres suffering from certain natural risks beyond the control of the\nbank, such as, those which are prone to floods, landslides or likely to be submerged due to\nconstruction of dams or affected by natural calamities etc.\nc) Branches functioning in places where law and order problem or terrorists\u2019 activities posing\nthreats to bank personnel and property.\nd) Branches where the premises occupied by the bank are in a dilapidated condition or\nburnt/destroyed and no suitable premises are available at the Centre/Block/Service Area.\nThe permission for shifting of loss-making rural branches as at above will be given by the\nconcerned Regional Office of RBI. Accordingly, banks are advised to submit their proposals\nin this regard, duly approved by their Board of Directors, to the concerned Regional Office of\nRBI under whose jurisdiction the centre falls, for approval. In case of branches falling under\nthe jurisdiction of Mumbai  Regional Office the proposals should be forwarded to Central\nOffice of DBOD. (cf. circular DBOD No.BL.BC.74 /22.01.001/98 dated 29.07.1998 and\ncircular DBOD No.BL.BC.23 /22.01.001/2000-01 dated 12.09.2000 )\n3.1.3  Sole Branch functioning at a Rural Centre.\nA branch which is the only bank branch functioning at a rural centre should not be  shifted /\nclosed/ merged outside the service area as this would render the relative area unbanked.\nHowever, under exceptional / unforeseen circumstances banks may approach Central Office\nof DBOD, RBI for permission after taking the approval of DCC / DIF in the matter.(cf. para 2\nof circular DBOD No.BL.BC.23 /22.01.001/2000-01 dated 12.09.2000)\n3.2  At Semi-urban Centres.\nIn case the semi-urban branches of banks have been allocated service area, the same norms\nfor shifting of branches  in rural centres would also be applicable for semi-urban centres. (cf.\npara 3(I) of circular DBOD No.BL.BC.132/22.01.001/92 dated 20.05.1992)7Where no service area has been allotted, banks may shift their branches at semi-urban centres\nwithin the same locality/municipal ward without the approval of Reserve Bank of India.\nHowever, they have to obtain an amendment to the licence from the concerned Regional\nOffice of Reserve Bank of India before shifting. Regarding shifting of branches outside the\nlocality/municipal ward, banks have to obtain approval of the concerned Regional Office of\nDBOD. Banks should, however, ensure that the locality/ward is not rendered unbanked due to\nthe shifting.\n3.3  At Urban/Metropolitan Centres.\nThe banks may shift their branches in urban/metropolitan centres within the same\nlocality/municipal ward without the approval of Reserve Bank of India. However, they have\nto obtain an amendment to the licence before the shifting so as to comply with the terms of\nthe licence issued to them under section 23 of BR Act 1949. Regarding shifting of branches\noutside the locality/municipal ward, banks have to obtain  approval of the concerned\nRegional Office of DBOD. Banks should ensure that the locality/ward is not rendered\nunbanked due to the shifting. (cf. para 3(II) of circular DBOD No.BL.BC.132/22.01.001/92\ndated 20.05.1992)\n4.  CLOSURE OF BRANCHES.\n4.1  Rural Centres\nClosure of rural branches would require the prior permission of the Reserve Bank of India.\nFurther, while closure of the loss making branches at rural centres having a single\ncommercial bank branch is not permitted, at centres served by more than one commercial\nbank branches (excluding that of RRBs) the decision for closure of one of the branches may\nbe taken by the concerned banks by mutual consultation without involving State Government\nand DCC. Matters, such as, transfer of all assets and liabilities of the branch proposed to be\nclosed, to another branch of the same or different bank, reallocation of villages under the\nService Area Approach, redeployment of staff, etc. should be sorted out by the banks\nthemselves. Due notice has to be given to the constituents of the branches which are proposed\nto be closed. Accordingly, banks are advised to submit their proposals for closure of rural\nbranch (other than single bank branch) duly approved by their Board of Directors, to the\nconcerned Regional Office of RBI under whose jurisdiction the centre falls, for approval. In\ncase of branches falling under the jurisdiction of Mumbai Regional Office the proposals may\nbe forwarded to Central Office of DBOD. In exceptional cases of closure of loss-making\nsingle rural branch, the proposal should be submitted to Central Office, Department of\nBanking Operations and Development, after getting the approval of District Consultative\nCommittee and Directorate of Institutional Finance of the concerned State Government. (cf.\npara 2 of circular DBOD. No.BL.BC.74 /22.01.001-98 dated 29.7.1998 and circular DBOD.\nNo.BL.BC.23 /22.01.001-2000-01 dated 12.09.2000)\n4.2  Semi-urban Centres.\nWherever the semi urban branches have been allocated service area, the same norms as for\nclosure of branches in rural centres will also be applicable for semi urban centres.\nWhere no service area has been allotted, banks may close their branches at semi-urban\ncentres (excluding SSI/SIB and Agicultural Development Branch) without the  approval of\nReserve Bank of India. However, they have to surrender the licence to the concerned\nRegional office of RBI immediately after closure. Banks should ensure that the locality/ward\nis not rendered unbanked due to the closure.84.3  Urban and Metropolitan Centres.\nBanks can close down their unremunerative branches in urban and metropolitan\ncentres(excluding SSI/SIB and Agicultural Development Branch)  without approval of\nReserve Bank of India. Immediately after the closure of the branch the banks are required to\nsurrender the relative licence to the concerned Regional Office of RBI for cancellation under\nadvice to DESACS, Mumbai. Banks should ensure that the locality/ward is not rendered\nunbanked due to the closure. (cf. para 2 of circular  DBOD No.BL.BC.81/C 168(64D)-91\ndated 16.02.1991).\n5.  SPLITTING OR PART SHIFTING OF BRANCHES WITHIN THE SAME\nCENTRE.\nThe banks can, without the approval of RBI, effect splitting of branches or part shifting of\nsome of the departments of the parent branch to nearby locations due to space constraints, for\nbetter customer service, etc. but they cannot conduct identical business from both the\npremises. They are, however, required to obtain necessary amendment to the licence from the\nconcerned Regional Office of RBI before the splitting/ part shifting of these branches. (cf.\npara 3(III) of circular DBOD No.BL.BC.132/ 22.01.001/92 dated 20.05.1992)\n6.  SPINNING-OFF OF BUSINESS.\nThe banks may resort to spin-off of business such as, government business, small-scale\nindustry business, etc. from an existing branch, and open a new specialised branch (out of the\nfive types mentioned at paragraph 2.2) at their discretion without the  approval of RBI.\nHowever banks are required to obtain a licence from the concerned Regional Office of\nReserve Bank of India before opening of these branches.  Spinning off of business to open\nany type of specialised branch other than the five categories mentioned above, would require\nprior approval of Central office of DBOD. ( cf. para 3(IV) of circular DBOD\nNo.BL.BC.132/22.01.001/92 dated 20.05.1992)\n7.  SWAPPING AND TAKE OVER OF BANK BRANCHES.\n7.1 SWAPPING OF BRANCHES.\nBanks can swap their stray/ unremunerative branches or those in remote areas with other\nbanks. Decision to swap branches may be taken by the concerned banks by mutual\nconsultation. Matters, such as, transfer of all assets and liabilities etc. of the branches\nproposed to be swapped should be sorted out by the banks themselves. In case any agreement\nis reached in this regard, the bank may forward the licences to the concerned Regional Office\nof RBI for amendment, before the swap. Due notice has to be given to the constituents of the\nbranches, which are proposed to be swapped. ( cf. para 3(IX) of circular DBOD\nNo.BL.BC.132/22.01.001/92 dated 20.05.1992 .)\n7.2 TAKE OVER OF BANK BRANCHES.\nBanks can take over branches at rural and semi urban centres from another bank  by mutual\nagreement. All issues connected with transfer of assets and liabilities, staff etc. of the\nbranches proposed to be transferred should be sorted out by the banks themselves on\nmutually agreed terms and conditions, subject to adherence of RBI guidelines wherever\napplicable.  Due publicity should be given to the constituents of the branch by the existing\nbank as well as the bank taking over the branch.9The transfer of a branch from one bank to another would lead to transfer of deposit accounts\nfrom one bank to another. Such deposits will continue to be governed by the terms of contract\nagreed to between the customer and the bank branch that is being taken over. Accordingly,\nthe same rate of interest will be payable till maturity on such transferred deposits, as was\npayable at the time of takeover of the branch. In that event the directive with regard to rate of\ninterest vide paragraph 22 (c) of our Master Circular DBOD.Dir.BC.12/13.03.00/2002-2003\ndated 31st July 2002 will not apply till the maturity of such deposits. The existing depositors\nof the branch being taken over may be allowed premature withdrawal of deposit, consequent\nto the transfer of business to another bank, without imposing any penalty.\nAfter a detailed agreement is reached on transfer, the bank taking over the branch may\nforward the licence to the concerned Regional Office of RBI for cancellation and obtain a\nfresh licence prior to transfer.\nIn cases where a rural branch of another bank being taken over, is the only branch\nfunctioning in the village/town, the bank taking over the branch will not be permitted to\nmerge it with any other of its existing branch in rural/ semi- urban area (with service area\nobligation), as it would render the area unbanked . (cf. Circular DBOD.BL.BC. 13\n/22.01.001/2003 dated 18.8.2003)\n8.  CONVERSION OF BRANCHES.\n8.1  Conversion of General/Specialised branches\nConversion of branches from General to Specialised and vice versa would require the\napproval of Central Office of DBOD of Reserve Bank of India.\n8.2.  Conversion of Full-fledged Rural branches into Satellite Offices.\nThe banks may themselves decide the need for conversion of their existing loss making\nbranches at rural centres into Satellite Offices keeping in view the cost-benefit aspect, the\nlikely inconvenience that may be caused to the existing clientele, the effect of the conversion\non the performance in the preparation of District Credit Plan and priority sector lending. The\nfinal decision with regard to conversion of rural branches should, however, be taken in\nconsultation with District Administration/State Government.\nThe same guidelines as given at para 2.5 may be followed by the banks for establishing\nSatellite Offices.\nBanks are required to obtain necessary amendment to the licences from the concerned\nRegional Office of RBI before conversion of  rural branches into Satellite Offices . (cf. para\n1of circular  DBOD.No.BL.BC.72/C-168(64-D)-87 dated 14.12.1987 and para V of circular\nDBOD No.BL.BC.41/22.01.001/92 dated 9.10.1992)\nConversion of branches into satellite offices at centres other than rural is not permissible .\n9.  MOBILE OFFICES.\nWhere the banks do not find it economical to open full-fledged branches or Satellite Offices\nat rural centres, they may open Mobile Offices. They are, however required to obtain\nnecessary licence from the concerned Regional Office of RBI before opening of such offices.\nThe scheme of Mobile Offices envisages the extension of banking facilities through a well\nprotected van with arrangements for two or three officials of the bank sitting in it with books,10safe containing cash, etc. The mobile unit would visit the places proposed to be served by it\non certain specified days/hours. The mobile office would be attached to a branch of the bank.\nThe mobile offices should not visit rural places which are served by co-operative banks and\nplaces served by regular offices of commercial banks.\n(cf. circulars  DBOD No.BL99/C.168-68 dated 19-1-1968 and  DBOD.No.BL.BC.72/C-\n168(64-D)-87 dated 14.12.1987 )\n10.  OPENING OF EXTENSION COUNTERS .\n10.1 The banks can open Extension Counters at the premises of the institutions of which they\nare the principal bankers after obtaining licence from the concerned Regional Office of\nReserve Bank of India for the purpose.  Extension Counters can be opened within the\npremises of big offices/factories, hospitals, military units, educational institutions, etc. where\nthere is a large complement of staff/workers, students, who because of their identical working\nhours and non-availability of banking facilities at a reasonable distance find it difficult to\ncarry out their banking transactions. The Extension Counters should carry out limited type of\nbanking business, such as,\n\u2022 deposit / withdrawal transactions,\n\u2022 issuing and encashment of drafts and mail transfers,\n\u2022 issue and encashment of travellers cheques,\n\u2022 sale of gift cheques,\n\u2022 collection of bills,\n\u2022 advances against fixed deposits of their customers (within the sanctioning power of\nthe concerned officials at the Extension Counter),\n\u2022 facility of safe deposit locker (provided adequate security arrangements are made).\n\u2022 Depository services to its customers, provided the bank is registered with SEBI as\nDepository Participant. EC should not extend credit facility against pledge of\ndematerialised securities or facilitate Securities Lending and Borrowing thereat.\n(circular DBOD.No.BL.BC.23/22.01.001/2003 dated 11.9.2003)\nFurther, if the extension counter proposes to undertake government business it would\nrequire prior approval of concerned Government authority as also of RBI, Central Office,\nDepartment of Government & Bank Accounts.\n Extension Counters are not allowed to be opened at residential colonies, shopping\ncomplexes, market places and places of worship, etc.\n10.2 Banks should furnish particulars of the proposed Extension Counters in Parts I and II\nof the format given in the Annexure II, to the concerned Regional Offices of Department of\nBanking Operations and Development, while applying for licence before opening of EC.\n(para III of circular DBOD No.BL.BC.41/22.01.001/92 dated 9.10.1992)1111. UPGRADATION  OF EXTENSION COUNTERS INTO FULL-FLEDGED\nBRANCHES.\n11.1 The banks should obtain approval of Reserve Bank of India for upgrading Extension\nCounters into full-fledged branches. The proposals are considered by the Regional Offices\nof DBOD if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\u2022 the Extension Counter has been functioning for a minimum period of five years,\n\u2022 the number of deposit accounts exceeded 2,000 during the last one year,\n\u2022 the average deposits (i.e. on a monthly basis ) for the last three years are more than\nRs.3 crore for Metropolitan centres and Rs.2 crore for other centres.\n11.2 The proposals wherein any of the above conditions are not fulfilled entirely, but\notherwise the concerned extension counters are grown to the extent of converting into a\nbranch, such cases are considered on merits of each case.\n12.   AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES ( ATMS ).\n12.1 The banks need not obtain permission of the Reserve Bank of India for installation of\nATMs at branches and Extension Counters (ECs) for which they hold licences issued by the\nReserve Bank. The banks should, however, report to the Central Office of DBOD, the\nconcerned Regional Offices of DBOD and DESACS as and when the ATM is installed at a\nbranch or an Extension Counter. (cf. circular DBOD No.BP.BC.152/21.03.051-94 dated\n29.12.1994)\n12.2 In addition to the installation of ATMs at branches and Extension Counters, banks may\ninstall off-site ATMs at other places identified by them without approval of RBI, but they\nshould obtain a licence from the concerned Regional Office of DBOD before  operationalising\nthe ATM so as to be in conformity with Section 23 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\nBanks can also shift or close these off-site ATMs at their discretion without approval of RBI.\nIn case of shifting, banks are required to obtain necessary amendment to the licence from the\nRegional Office of RBI under whose jurisdiction the proposed location for shifting falls,\nbefore the shifting of the concerned off-site ATM. In case of closure of off-site ATMs, the\nlicence has to be surrendered to the concerned Regional Office of RBI for cancellation\nimmediately after the closure of the off-site ATM under advice to central office of DBOD.\n12.3 The following functions may be provided at ATMs:\n\u2022 Deposits/ Withdrawal\n\u2022 Personal Identification Number (PIN) changes\n\u2022 Requisition for cheque books\n\u2022 Statement of accounts\n\u2022 Balance enquiry and\n\u2022 Inter account transfer - restricted to accounts of the same customer or different\ncustomers of the bank, at same centre or different centres within the country.\n\u2022 Telephone communications between the \u201cstand-alone\u201d ATMs with branch ATMs and\nShared Payment Network System ( SPNS) can be provided.\n\u2022  Mail Facility for sending written communication to the bank (similar to cheque\ndeposit facility)12\u2022 Utility payment like Eletricity bill, Telephone bill etc.\n\u2022 Product Information\nNo person other than security guard should be posted at such \u201cnon-branch\u201d / \u201cstand-alone\u201d\nATM centres. (cf.  circular DBOD No.BP.BC. 60/ 21.03.051/ 96 dated 16 May 1996 and\ncircular DBOD No.BL.BC. 5/ 22.01.001/ 2003 dated 23 July 2003)\nBanks are not permitted to display products and services of other manufacturers /dealers\n/vendors on their ATM screens for a fee which amounts to advertising and is not a permitted\nactivity in which a bank can engage under Section 6(1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\nHowever, banks can utilise the ATM screens for displaying their own products. (Circular\nDBOD.No.BL.BC.62/22.01.001/2002 dated 28 January 2002.)\n13.  VALIDITY OF AUTHORISATIONS AND LICENCES.\n13.1 Presently authorisations are issued to banks for opening of branches based on the\nrequests received from them, on the merits of each case. With a view to ensuring expeditious\nutilisation of authorisations and actual establishment of the branch, it has been decided to\nlimit the validity of authorisation to a maximum period of two years.\nBanks are required to obtain necessary licence prior to the opening of an office/branch from\nthe concerned Regional Office of RBI under whose jurisdiction the centre falls. It is observed\nthat some banks obtain a licence and do not open the branch for a considerable period of time\nand approach the Regional Offices for revalidation of licences time and again. Banks should\ntherefore, approach the Regional Office for licence only after the infrastructure is ready for\nopening of the office/ branch.\n13.2 Further, banks often approach for approval for change in name of a branch due to\nchange in name of the locality or street/road where the branch is located. Since there is no\nchange in location of the branch, banks need not seek approval or approach for amendment to\nlicence in the matter but intimate the change to the concerned Regional Office of RBI and\nDESACS, Mumbai. Changes may also take place due to change in name of taluk/district or\nreorganisation of districts or formation of new states.

Where the banks are not\nable to give such declaration, the licences will be issued only on submission of NOC from\nDDA. (cf. cirrcular DBOD No.BL.BC.64/22.01.003/97 dated 5.06.1997)\n15.  OPENING BRANCHES IN HARYANA.\nWhile applying for licences for opening branches/offices in Haryana, the banks have to\nensure that they are located in conforming areas approved for commercial use by Haryana\nUrban Development Authority. A no objection certificate from Haryana Urban Development\nAuthority should be furnished in this regard.\n16.  CLASSIFICATION / RE-CLASSIFICATION OF CENTRES.\nBanks are advised to ascertain the population group classification of the centres of which they\nare not sure, from Department of Statistical Analysis & Computer Services ( DESACS), RBI,\nBanking Statistics Division, C-8/9, Bandra-Kurla Complex, Mumbai-400051, before\napproaching DBOD for opening of new branches.

(cf. para.6 of circular DBOD.BC.No.127/ 12.05.005/99-2000 dated 30.11.1999).\n\u2018Nil' statement must be submitted in case there is nothing to report.\n(iii) In terms of Rule 13 of the Banking Regulations (Companies) Rules, 1949 banks are\nrequired to submit a list relating to its offices in India in Form VII within a period of one\nmonth from the close of every quarter  to the office of RBI situated in the state in which their\nRegistered/Head Office is located.\n18. FOREIGN BANKS.\n18.1 Foreign banks entry into India.\nForeign banks are allowed to operate in India through branches only. A foreign bank desirous\nof opening its maiden branch in India may apply to RBI giving relevant information about the\nbank, its major shareholders, financial position, etc. Request from banks will be examined,\nkeeping in view i) the financial soundness of the bank ii) international and home country\nranking iii) rating iv) international presence v) economic and political relations between the14two countries (in particular the home country of the bank should not discriminate against\nIndian banks). The bank should be under consolidated supervision of the home country\nregulator.\nA new foreign bank is required to bring in assigned minimum capital of US $ 25 million, of\nwhich   US$ 10 mio shall be brought in at the time of opening each of the first two branches\nand the balance of US$ 5 mio. at the time of opening the third or more branches. Permission\nto open the second and subsequent branch will be granted taking into account, inter- alia, the\npolicy prevailing at the relevant time and the performance of the first branch.\nThe assigned capital has to be maintained unimpaired, on an ongoing basis and in case of any\nloss, which results in erosion/impairment thereof, the difference should be brought in\nimmediately as capital funds from the Head Office. Further, the Indian entity is required to\nmaintain the required percentage of Capital to Risk-weighted Assets of its Indian operations.\nExisting foreign banks desirous of opening branches may approach the International Banking\nSection in the DBOD with their specific requests.\n18.2 CLOSURE OF BRANCHES.\nIt has been observed that foreign banks close their branches without giving adequate notice of\nsuch closure to their depositors, borrowers and other customers thereby causing avoidable\ninconvenience to all concerned. It is expected that due notice of such closure be given to their\ncustomers and others to ensure that the customers are not put to any inconvenience.\nForeign banks operating in India are therefore advised that they should invariably inform the\nReserve Bank, well in advance , of their intention of closing of any of their branches including\nthose in metropolitan areas. They should also furnish a detailed plan of closure to ensure that\ntheir customers' interest and convenience are addressed adequately(circular DBOD.IBS.BC.\n32/23.03.001/2002-03 dated October 17,2002).\n18.3  CREDIT CARD CENTRES.\n(DBOD No. IBS.BC.130/23.31.006/99-2000 dated 24  December 1999.)\nForeign Banks may freely  set up  centres to support  the following activities relating to credit\ncards.\ni) Attending to the request for and issue of credit cards\nii) Processing of credit cards\niii) Acceptance of credit card payment by cheques\niv) Marketing credit cards to prospective customers\nv) Utilisation of services  of agent at centres (where the bank has no presence) to carry out\ncredit card related activities.\nvi) Maintenance of cash balances for meeting expenses of the centre and not for payment to\ncredit card holders.\nHowever, before the centres commence operations , a licence under Section 23 of the B.R.\nAct, 1949 should be obtained from the concerned Regional Office of the RBI.15Appendix\nList of Circulars consolidated by the Master Circular\nNo. Circular No. Date Subject\n1.

In respect of financing of\nprojects backed by state Government guarantees also, banks/Financial Institutions should\nexercise due diligence on the viability of the projects and State Government guarantees\nshould not be taken as a substitute for satisfactory credit appraisal. Banks have been advised\nto ensure that the individual components of financing and returns on the project are well\ndefined and assessed and appraisal requirements are not diluted on other considerations. In\nthis connection we invite your attention to paragraph (4) of Annexure to our circular\nDBOD.No. BP. BC. 67/21.04.048/2002-2003 dated February 4, 2003, wherein the banks\nwere advised in detail to adhere to the above norm while extending infrastructure finance to\nGovernment owned entities.\n2. It has again been reported that requests for credit facilities to SPVs/ Public Sector units,\nEWS housing and urban infrastructure etc. backed by State Government guarantees received\nby banks/ FIs are sometimes approved in order to meet social lending targets and solely based\non the strength of State Government guarantees. The Government of India has expressed its\nconcern over the incidence of such practices by banks/ FIs, which result in build-up of State\nGovernment guarantees beyond sustainable levels of debt. A Committee constituted by\nGovernment of India to assess the fiscal impact of the State Government guarantees given in\nrecent past has viewed unfavourably, the tendency of banks/ FIs rolling over their defaults to\nunbankable  projects on the strength of guarantees and has recommended that the banks/ FIs\nshould eschew such practices. The Government has accepted the recommendation of the\nCommittee.\n3. We, therefore, reiterate that that banks/ FIs should appraise credit proposals received from\nSPVs / Public Sector units, EWS  housing and urban infrastructure etc. on commercial basis\nwith respect to viability and in accordance with the credit policy laid down by the Board\ninstead of relying solely on the strength of State Government guarantees.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(C.

PCB. Cir.   25  / 16.20.00/ 2003-04\nNovember 17, 2003\nCEOs  of  Select  Primary  (Urban ) Co-operative Banks\nDear  Sir,\nDraft prudential guidelines on investment in non- SLR   debt securities\n by urban co-operative banks\nIn order to contain the risks arising out of non- SLR investment portfolio of urban co-\noperative banks, guidelines as indicated in the Annexure, are proposed to be issued by the\nReserve Bank to all urban co-operative banks, which interalia, cover the following:\ni) the need  for strengthening  the internal rating systems\nii) fixing  of prudential limits\niii) review  of the   bank\u2019s  non- SLR  investments by the Board\niv) disclosures  in  \u2018Notes  on Accounts\u2019  to the balance sheet\nA copy of the draft guidelines are placed on the Reserve Bank website ( www.rbi.org.in). You\nmay please furnish your feedback on the above draft guidelines within a fortnight from the\ndate of this letter to enable us to finalise the proposed guidelines\nYours faithfully,\n(sd)\u2026..\n( S. Karuppasamy )\nChief  General  Manager In-charge\nAnnexure\nGuidelines on investments by urban co-operative\nbanks in Non- SLR Debt Securities\nCoverage\n1. These guidelines cover investments by urban co-operative banks in the bonds issued by\npublic sector  undertakings, unsecured redeemable bonds floated by nationalised  banks,\nbonds / shares issued by All India  Financial Institutions and units of Unit Trust  of  India.\nThe guidelines will apply to investments both in the primary market as well as the\nsecondary market. It may be noted that banks should not invest in Non- SLR debt\nsecurities of original maturity of less than one-year other than  Certificates of Deposits\nwhich are covered under RBI guidelines .\n2. Definitions of a few terms used in these guidelines have been furnished in Appendix I\nwith a view to ensure uniformity in approach while implementing the guidelines.\nRegulatory requirements2\n3. Banks should undertake usual due diligence in respect of investments in non- SLR\nsecurities. Present RBI regulations preclude banks from extending credit facilities for\ncertain purposes.  Banks should ensure that such activities are not financed by way of\nfunds raised through the non- SLR securities.\n4. Banks must not invest in unrated debt securities, unlisted securities and unlisted   shares\nof All India Financial  Institutions .\n5. The debt securities shall carry a credit rating of not less than investment grade from a\nCredit Rating Agency registered with the SEBI.   Banks should ensure that they make all\nfresh Non- SLR debt investments only in listed debt securities of public sector\nundertakings  which comply with the requirements of the SEBI circular dated September\n30, 2003.\nInternal assessments\n6. Since non- SLR securities are mostly in the form of credit substitutes, banks are advised\nto (i) subject all their investment proposals relating to the above securities to credit\nappraisal on par with their credit proposals, irrespective of the fact that the proposed\ninvestments may be in rated securities, (ii) make their own internal credit analysis and\nrating even in respect of rated issues and that they should not entirely rely on the ratings\nof external agencies, and (iii) strengthen their internal rating systems which should also\ninclude building up of a system of regular (quarterly or half-yearly) tracking of the\nfinancial position of the issuer with a view to ensuring continuous monitoring of the\nrating migration of the issuers/issues.\nFixing of prudential limits\n7. The Board of Directors of banks should fix a prudential limit for their total investment in\nnon-SLR securities and sub-limits for the following debt securities:\na) bonds  of public sector undertakings,\nb) bonds /equity  of   All  India Financial Institutions listed in Appendix - II,\nc) infrastructure bonds floated  by All India  Financial  Institutions,\nd) unsecured redeemable  bonds floated by nationalised banks,\ne) units of UTI  and,\nf) certificate  of deposits issued by scheduled commercial  banks and other financial\ninstitutions  approved by  RBI.\nThe total investment in (a) to (f) above should not exceed 10 per cent of the banks\u2019 total\ndeposits as on March 31 of the previous year, with a sub-ceiling of  5 per cent of incremental\ndeposits of the previous year for investments covered under (e).\n8. Banks which have exposure to investments in non- SLR securities in excess of the\nprudential limit prescribed above as on 31st March 2003 should not make any fresh\ninvestment in such securities till they ensure compliance with the above prudential limit.\n9. As a matter of prudence, banks should stipulate entry-level minimum ratings/ quality\nstandards and industry-wise, maturity-wise, duration-wise, issuer-wise etc. limits to\nmitigate the adverse impacts of concentration and the risk of illiquidity.3\nRole of Boards\n10. Banks should ensure that their investment policies duly approved by the Board of\nDirectors are formulated after taking into account all the relevant issues specified in these\nguidelines on non- SLR investment. Banks should put in place proper risk management\nsystems for capturing and analysing the risk in respect of non- SLR investment and taking\nremedial measures in time. Banks should also put in place appropriate systems to ensure\nthat investment in privately placed instruments is made in accordance with the systems\nand procedures prescribed under respective bank\u2019s investment policy.\n11. The Board should devise a system to ensure that the limits prescribed in paragraph  7\nabove are scrupulously complied.  The Boards should appropriately address the issue of\nensuring compliance with the prudential limits on an ongoing basis, including breaches, if\nany, due to rating migration.\n12. Boards of banks should review the following aspects of non- SLR investment twice a\nyear:\na) Total business (investment and divestment) during the reporting period\nb) Compliance with the prudential limits prescribed by the Board for non- SLR investment\nc) Rating migration of the issuers/ issues held in the bank\u2019s books and consequent\ndiminution in the portfolio quality\nd) Extent of non performing investments in the non- SLR category\nDisclosures\n13. In order to help in the creation of a central database on private placement of debt, a copy\nof all offer documents should be filed with the Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd.\n(CIBIL ) by the investing banks.\n14. Banks should disclose the details of the issuer composition of non- SLR investments and\nthe non-performing non- SLR investments in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 of the balance\nsheet, as indicated in Appendix III.\nDemat   form\n15. Urban co-operative banks should make investments in non- SLR securities in\ndematerialised form only.\nTrading and settlement in debt securities\n16. As per the SEBI guidelines, all trades with the exception of the spot transactions, in a\nlisted debt security, shall be executed only on the trading platform of a stock exchange. In\naddition to complying with the SEBI guidelines, banks should ensure that all spot\ntransactions in listed securities are reported on the NDS and settled through the CCIL\nfrom a date to be notified by RBI.\nAppendix I\nGuidelines on non - SLR investment  by urban\nco-operative  banks  - Definitions\n(Vide para 2 of the Guidelines)4\n1. With a view to imparting clarity and to ensure that there is no divergence in the\nimplementation of the guidelines, some of the terms used in the guidelines are defined\nbelow.\n2. A security will be treated as rated if it is subjected to a detailed rating exercise by an\nexternal rating agency in India which is registered with SEBI and is carrying a current or\nvalid rating. The rating relied upon will be deemed to be current or valid if\ni) The credit rating letter relied upon is not more than one month old on the date of\nopening of the issue, and\nii) The rating rationale from the rating agency is not more than one year old on the\ndate of opening of the issue, and\niii) The rating letter and the rating rationale is a part of the offer document.\niv) In the case of secondary market acquisition, the credit rating of the issue should be\nin force and confirmed from the monthly bulletin published by the respective\nrating agency.\nSecurities which do not have a current or valid rating by an external rating agency would be\ndeemed as unrated securities .\n3. The investment grade ratings  awarded by each of the external rating agencies operating in\nIndia would be identified by the IBA/ FIMMDA. These would also be reviewed by IBA/\nFIMMDA at least once a year.\n4. A \u2018listed\u2019 debt security is a security which is listed in a stock exchange. If not so, it is an\n\u2018unlisted\u2019 debt security.\n5. A non performing investment  (NPI), similar to a non performing advance ( NPA), is one\nwhere\ni) Interest/ instalment (including maturity proceeds) is due and remains unpaid\nfor more than 180 days. The delinquency period would become 90 days with\neffect from 31st March 2004.\nii) any credit facility availed by the issuer is NPA in the books of the bank,\ninvestment in any of the securities issued by the same issuer would also be\ntreated as NPI.\nAppendix II\nList  of All India Financial  Institutions\n1) Industrial  Development  Bank  of India  ( IDBI )\n2) Industrial   Finance  Corporation  of  India ( IFCI )\n3) Export - Import  Bank  of India ( Exim  Bank )\n4) Industrial  Reconstruction  Bank of India ( IRBI )\n5) National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and Rural  Development  ( NABARD )\n6) Small  Industries  Development  Bank of India ( SIDBI )\n7) National  Housing  Bank ( NHB )\n8) Unit  Trust  of India ( UTI )\n9) Life Insurance Corporation of India ( LIC )\n10) General Insurance Corporation of India ( GIC )5\n11) Risk  Capital  and Technology  Finance Corporation Ltd.

In this context, attention is invited to paragraph 74 of the Governor\u2019s Statement on\nMid-Term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2003-04 (reproduced in the\nAnnex) announced on November 3, 2003.

As regards\nthe additional provision arising as on March 31, 2006 on account of the modification in the\nnorms, the FIs would have the option to phase out the required provisioning over a period of\nthree years beginning from the year ending March 31, 2006, subject to at least one fourth of\nthe additional required provision being made in each year.

Venugopal Reddy, Governor,\nReserve Bank of India on Mid-term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy\n For the year 2003-04\n\u201c  (b) Prudential Norms for FIs\n74. As indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2001, with effect from the year\nended March 2002, assets of financial institutions ( FIs) are treated as non-performing, if the\ninterest and/or principal instalment remain overdue for a period of more than 180 days.\nHowever, in the case of banks, 90 days norm for recognition of loan impairment would be\nadopted from the year ending March 2004. In order to bring in convergence between the asset\nclassification norms of FIs and banks, in line with international norms, it is proposed:\u2022 To adopt the 90 days norm for recognition of loan impairment for FIs with effect from\nthe year ending March 31, 2006.  However, in order to mitigate the burden of\nadditional provisioning arising out of adoption of the revised norm, FIs are permitted\nto phase out the required provisioning over a period of three years beginning from the\nyear ending March 31, 2006, with a minimum of one-fourth of the additional\nprovisioning being made each year. \u201d", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/40085.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 15, 2003", "info": "Permission to open Project Office in India and Remittance of Assets - Project Office\nA.P.(DIR Series) Circular No. 37 (Nov 15, 2003)\nReserve Bank of India\nExchange Control Department\nCentral Office\nMumbai 400 001\nA.P.(DIR Series) Circular No. 37\nNovember 15 ,  2003\nTo\nAll Authorised Dealers in Foreign Exchange\nMadam / Sirs,\nPermission to open Project Office in India\nand Remittance of Assets - Project Office\nAttention of Authorised Dealers is invited to Notification No. FEMA 22/2000-RB dated\nMay 3, 2000 [Foreign Exchange Management (Establishment in India of Branch or Office or\nother Place of Business)  Regulations, 2000] regarding establishment in India of a branch or\noffice or other place of business by a person resident outside India and Notification No. FEMA\n13/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000 [Foreign Exchange Management (Remittance of Assets)\nRegulations, 2000] regarding remittance outside India by a person whether resident in India or\nnot, of assets in India.

R. Muralidharan)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nANNEX\nGuidelines on investments by banks\nin non- SLR Securities\nCoverage\n1. These guidelines cover banks\u2019 investments in non- SLR securities issued by corporates,\nbanks, FIs and State and Central Government sponsored institutions, SPVs etc. These guidelines\nwill, however, not be applicable to investments in securities issued directly by the Central and\nState Governments, which are not reckoned for SLR purpose, and investments in equity shares.\nThe guidelines will apply to investments both in the primary market as well as the secondary\nmarket.\n2. Definitions of a few terms used in these guidelines have been furnished in Appendix I\nwith a view to ensure uniformity in approach while implementing the guidelines.\nRegulatory requirements\n3. Banks should not invest in Non- SLR securities of original maturity of less than one-year,\nother than Commercial Paper and Certificates of Deposits which are covered under RBI\nguidelines .\n4. Banks should undertake usual due diligence in respect of investments in non- SLR\nsecurities. Present RBI regulations preclude banks from extending credit facilities for certain\npurposes.  Banks should ensure that such activities are not financed by way of funds raised\nthrough the non- SLR securities.\nListing and rating requirements\n5. Banks must not invest in unrated non- SLR securities.\n6. The Securities Exchange Board of India ( SEBI) vide their circular dated September 30,\n2003 have stipulated requirements that listed companies are required to comply with, for making\nissue of debt securities on a private placement basis and listed on a stock exchange. According to\nthis circular any listed company, making issue of debt securities on a private placement basis and\nlisted on a stock exchange, has to make full disclosures (initial and continuing) in the manner\nprescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act 1956, SEBI  (Disclosure and Investor Protection)3\nGuidelines, 2000 and the Listing Agreement with the exchanges. Furthermore, the debt securities\nshall carry a credit rating of not less than investment grade from a Credit Rating Agency\nregistered with the SEBI.\nAccordingly, while making fresh investments in non- SLR debt securities, banks should ensure\nthat such investment are made only in listed debt securities of companies which comply with the\nrequirements of the SEBI circular dated September 30, 2003, except to the extent indicated in\nparagraphs 7 and 8 below.\nFixing of prudential limits\n7. Bank\u2019s investment in unlisted non- SLR securities should not exceed 10 per cent of its\ntotal investment in non- SLR securities as on March 31, of the previous year. The unlisted non-\nSLR securities in which banks may invest up to the limits specified above, should comply with\nthe disclosure requirements as prescribed by the SEBI for listed companies.\n8. Bank\u2019s investment in unlisted non- SLR securities may exceed the limit of 10 per cent, by\nan additional 10 per cent, provided the investment is on account of investment in securities\nissued by SPVs  for Mortgage Backed Securities ( MBS ), securitisation  papers issued for\ninfrastructure projects, and bonds/debentures/Security Receipts/Pass Through Certificates issued\nby Securitisation  Companies and Reconstruction Companies set up under the Securitisation  and\nReconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 and\nregistered with RBI. In other words investment exclusively in securities specified in this\nparagraph could be up to the maximum permitted limit of 20 per cent of non- SLR investment.\n9. Banks which have exposure to investments in unlisted non- SLR securities in excess of\nthe prudential limit prescribed above as on March 31, 2003 should not make any fresh\ninvestment in such securities till they ensure compliance with the above prudential limit.\n  Internal assessment\n10.  Since non- SLR securities are mostly in the form of credit substitutes, banks were advised in\nJune 2001 to ( i) subject all their investment proposals relating to non- SLR securities to credit\nappraisal on par with their credit proposals, irrespective of the fact that the proposed investments\nmay be in rated securities, (ii) make their own internal credit analysis and rating even in respect of\nrated issues and that they should not entirely rely on the ratings of external agencies, and (iii)\nstrengthen their internal rating systems which should also include building up of a system of regular\n(quarterly or half-yearly) tracking of the financial position of the issuer with a view to ensuring\ncontinuous monitoring of the rating migration of the issuers/issues.\nRole of Boards\n11. Banks should ensure that their investment policies duly approved by the Board of Directors are\nformulated after taking into account all the relevant issues specified in these guidelines on\ninvestment in non- SLR securities.  Banks should put in place proper risk management systems\nfor capturing and analysing the risk in respect of non- SLR investment and taking remedial\nmeasures in time. Banks should also put in place appropriate systems to ensure that investment in\nprivately placed instruments is made in accordance with the systems and procedures prescribed\nunder respective bank\u2019s investment policy.4\n12. Boards of banks should review the following aspects of non- SLR investment at least at quarterly\nintervals:\na) Total business (investment and divestment) during the reporting period.\nb) Compliance with the prudential limits prescribed by the Board for non- SLR\ninvestment.\nc) Compliance with the prudential guidelines on non- SLR securities prescribed in\nparagraphs 7 to 9 above.\nd) Rating migration of the issuers/ issues held in the bank\u2019s books and consequent\ndiminution in the portfolio quality.\ne) Extent of non performing investments in the non- SLR category.\nDisclosures\n13.  In order to help in the creation of a central database on private placement of debt, a copy of all\noffer documents should be filed with the Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd. ( CIBIL ) by the\ninvesting banks. Further, any default relating to interest/ instalment in respect of any privately\nplaced debt should also be reported to CIBIL  by the investing banks along with a copy of the\noffer document.\n14. Banks should disclose the details of the issuer composition of non- SLR investments and the non-\nperforming non- SLR investments in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 of the balance sheet, as indicated in\nAppendix II.\n Trading and settlement in debt securities\n15. As per the SEBI guidelines, all trades with the exception of the spot transactions, in a listed debt\nsecurity, shall be executed only on the trading platform of a stock exchange. In addition to\ncomplying with the SEBI guidelines, banks should ensure that all spot transactions in listed and\nunlisted debt securities are reported on the NDS and settled through the CCIL from a date to be\nnotified by RBI.5\nAppendix I\nGuidelines on investments by banks in non- SLR investment portfolio\nby banks \u2013 Definitions\n(Vide paragraph 2 of the Guidelines)\n1.

A security will be treated as rated if it is subjected to a detailed rating exercise by an external\nrating agency in India which is registered with SEBI and is carrying a current or valid rating. The\nrating relied upon will be deemed to be current or valid if\ni) The credit rating letter relied upon is not more than one month old on the date of\nopening of the issue, and\nii) The rating rationale from the rating agency is not more than one year old on the date\nof opening of the issue, and\niii) The rating letter and the rating rationale is a part of the offer document.\niv) In the case of secondary market acquisition, the credit rating of the issue should be in\nforce and confirmed from the monthly bulletin published by the respective rating\nagency.\nSecurities which do not have a current or valid rating by an external rating agency would be\ndeemed as unrated securities .\n3. The investment grade ratings  awarded by each of the external rating agencies operating in\nIndia would be identified by the IBA/ FIMMDA. These would also be reviewed by IBA/\nFIMMDA at least once a year.\n4. A \u2018listed\u2019 security is a security which is listed in a stock exchange.  If not so, it is an\n\u2018unlisted\u2019 security.\n5. A non performing investment  (NPI), similar to a non performing advance ( NPA), is one where\ni) Interest/ instalment (including maturity proceeds) is due and remains unpaid for\nmore than 180 days. The delinquency period would become 90 days with effect\nfrom 31st March 2004.\nii) The above would apply mutatis-mutandis to preference shares where the fixed\ndividend is not paid.\niii) In the case of equity shares, in the event the investment in the shares of any\ncompany is valued at Re.1 per company on account of the non availability of the\nlatest balance sheet in accordance with the instructions contained in para 28 of the6\nAnnexure  to circular DBOD.BP.BC.32/ 21.04.048/ 2000-01 dated October 16,\n2000, those equity shares would also be reckoned as NPI.\niv) If any credit facility availed by the issuer is NPA in the books of the bank,\ninvestment in any of the securities issued by the same issuer would also be treated\nas NPI.\nAppendix II\nPrudential guidelines on management of the non- SLR investment\nportfolio by banks \u2013 Disclosures requirements\n(vide paragraph 14 of the Guidelines)\nBanks should make the following disclosures in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 of the balance sheet in\nrespect of their non- SLR investment portfolio, with effect from the financial year ending 31\nMarch 2004.\ni) Issuer composition of Non SLR investments\n(Rs. in crore)\nNo. Issuer Amount Extent of\nprivate\nplacementExtent of\n\u2018below\ninvestment\ngrade\u2019\nsecuritiesExtent of\n\u2018unrated\u2019\nSecuritiesExtent of\n\u2018unlisted\u2019\nsecurities\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)\n1 PSUs\n2 FIs\n3 Banks\n4 Private corporates\n5 Subsidiaries/ Joint ventures\n6 Others\n7 Provision held towards\ndepreciationX X X X X X X X X X X X\nTotal  *7\nNOTE:  1.  * Total under column 3 should tally with the total of investments included\nunder the following categories in Schedule 8 to the balance sheet:\na.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of Government\nsecurities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d basis in select  auctions of\ndated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-competitive bids up to 5 percent  of\nthe notified amount will be accepted in the auctions of dated securities. The reserved amount\nwill be within the notified amount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated GOI\nsecurities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL) account\nwith the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions:  Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks shall be covered\nunder this Scheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single bid for an amount not more than Rs. two crore (face value) per auction\n3.  submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks that   maintain\nSGL account and current account with the Reserve Bank of India shall be eligible to\nsubmit their non competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI. The\nminimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in multiples in\nRs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent subsidiary\ngeneral ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish to participate.\nHowever, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An undertaking to the\neffect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be obtained and kept on record\nby the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name,\namount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on the\ndate of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from their clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of notified\namount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be theresponsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a\ntransparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the\nshortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the main\nSGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The facility for\naffording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing investors who\nare not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate clearly at the time\nof tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be credited to their SGL\naccount and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the main SGL account is\npermissible at the instance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to their\nclients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients shall be\ncompleted within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such costs\nmay be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case the transfer of\nsecurities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the consideration amount\npayable by the client to the bank or PD would also include accrued interest from the date of\nissue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities, accrued\ninterest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be worked out\nby the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that no other costs such\nas funding costs should be built into the price or recovered from the client.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to operations under the\nScheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for from time to time within\nthe time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and accordingly, if and\nwhen considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/39926.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 05, 2003", "info": "Tender for Non-competitive Bids\n(Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding Facility in Auctions of Government Securities)\n                                                         Annexure I (a)\n                                                         For office use only\nThe Regional Director,                     |------------------|\nReserve Bank of India,                     | Regn no.          |\nPublic Debt Office,                        |                  |\nFort,                                      |------------------|\nMumbai - 400 001.\nDear Sir,\nTender for Non-competitive Bids for \u201cFloating Rate Bonds, 2012\u201d\nfor an aggregate amount of Rs.250 crore: Auction to be held on\nNovember 7, 2003.\n    \n        Pursuant to Government of India, Ministry of Finance,\nDepartment of Economic Affairs Notification No F.No.4(8)\nW&M/2003 dated November 5, 2003 and the tender notice issued by\nyou, I/we, the undersigned hereby submit an aggregate bid on\nbehalf of the non-competitive bidders as per the enclosed list\nin pursuance of the \u2018 Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding\nFacility in the Auctions of Government Securities\u2019 at the\nauction to be held by you on the captioned date as set out\nbelow:\ni)   Name  of the Bank/Primary Dealer  /-------------------\\\nii)   Address                          /-------------------\\\niii)  Telephone No.                    \\-------------------/\niv)\nUnde\nrtak\ning\n1. \nO\nn\n your acceptance of my/our bid,\ni) I/we agree/undertake to immediately collect the letter of\nacceptance from your office and to deposit the requisite\namount at Reserve Bank of India, Fort, Mumbai on the\nday/time as indicated therein.\nii) I/We authorise you to debit my/our Current account\nmaintained with Reserve Bank of India with the requisite\namount.\n2.

The rating relied upon will be deemed to be current or valid if:\ni) The credit rating letter relied upon is not more than one month old on the date of\nopening of the issue, and\nii) The rating rationale from the rating agency is not more than one year old on the\ndate of opening of the issue, and\niii) The rating letter and the rating rationale are a part of the offer document.4\niv) In the case of secondary market acquisition, the credit rating of the issue should be\nin force and confirmed from the monthly bulletin published by the respective rating\nagency.\n2.2 Unrated security : Securities which do not have a current or valid rating by an external\nrating agency would be deemed as unrated securities.\n2.3 Listed debt security : It is a security, which is listed on a stock exchange.  If not so\nlisted, it is an \u2018unlisted\u2019 debt security.\n2.4 Non performing investment  (NPI): For the limited purpose of these guidelines, an\nNPI (similar to a non performing advance ( NPA) is one where:\ni) In respect of fixed / predetermined income securities, interest / principal / fixed\ndividend on preference shares (including maturity proceeds) is due and remains\nunpaid for more than 180 days.\nii) The equity shares of a company have been valued at Re. 1/- per company, on\naccount of the non-availability of the latest balance sheet (as per the instructions\ncontained in para 26 of the Annexure to circular DBS.FID. No.C-9/01.02.00/\n2000-01 dated November 9, 2000)\niii) If any credit facility availed by the issuer of the security is classified as NPA in the\nbooks of the FI, investment in any of the securities issued by the same issuer\nwould also be treated as NPI.\n3. Regulatory requirements\n3.1 The FIs must not invest in unrated debt securities but only in rated ones, which carry a\nminimum investment grade rating  from a credit rating agency registered with SEBI.\n3.2 The investment grade rating should have been awarded by an external rating agency,\noperating in India, as identified by the IBA/ FIMMDA. The list of such agencies would also\nbe reviewed by IBA / FIMMDA at least once a year.\n3.3 The FIs should not invest in debt securities of original maturity  of less than one-year\nother than Commercial Paper and Certificates of Deposits, which are covered under the RBI\nguidelines.    \n3.4 The FIs should undertake usual due diligence  in respect of investments in debt\nsecurities.\n3.5 The FIs should ensure that all fresh investments in debt securities are made only in\nlisted debt securities  of companies, which comply with the requirements of the SEBI circular\nNo. SEBI/MRD/SE/AT/36/2003/30/9 dated September 30, 2003, except to the extent indicated\nin paragraph 3.5 below.\n3.6 The unlisted debt securities  in which the FIs may invest up to the limits specified in\nparagraph 5 below, should be rated and disclosure requirements as prescribed by the SEBI for\nlisted companies should be followed by the issuer company.5\n4. Internal assessments\nSince the debt securities are very often a credit substitute, the FIs would be well advised to:\n(i) subject all their investment proposals relating to debt securities to the same\nstandards of credit appraisal as for their credit proposals, irrespective of the fact\nthat the proposed investments may be in rated securities;\n(ii) make their own internal credit analysis and assign internal rating even in\nrespect of externally rated issues and not to rely solely on the ratings of external\nrating agencies; and\n(iii) strengthen their internal rating systems which should also include building up\nof a system of regular (quarterly or half-yearly) tracking of the financial\nposition of the issuer with a view to ensuring continuous monitoring of the\nrating migration of the issuers / issues.\n5. Fixing of prudential limits\n5.1 The Board of Directors of the FIs should fix a prudential limit for their total investment\nin debt securities (other than government securities and those in the nature of advance) and\nsub-limits for the following categories of debt securities:\na) unlisted securities; and\nb) Mortgage Backed Securities ( MBS) and securitisation papers issued by the\nSPVs for infrastructure projects.\nThe total investment in (a) and (b) above should not exceed 20 per cent  of the FIs\u2019 total\ninvestment in debt securities (other than government securities and those in the nature of\nadvance )  as on March 31(June 30 in case of NHB), of the previous year, with a sub-ceiling of\n10 per cent  for investments covered under (a) above.\n5.2 The FIs which have exposure to investments in debt securities in excess of the\nprudential limit prescribed at para 5.1 above as on March 31, 2003 (June 30, 2003 in case of\nNHB ) should not make any fresh investment in such securities till they ensure compliance\nwith the above prudential limit.\n5.3 As a matter of prudence, the FIs should stipulate, with the approval of the Board,\nminimum ratings / quality standards for acquiring exposure in debt securities (other than\ngovernment securities and those in the nature of advance) and industry-wise, maturity-wise,\nduration-wise, issuer-wise, etc., exposure limits to address the concentration risk and the risk\nof illiquidity .\n6. Role of the Boards of Directors\n6.1 The FIs should ensure that their investment policies, duly approved by the Board of\nDirectors, are formulated duly taking into account all the relevant aspects specified in these\nguidelines. The FIs should put in place proper risk management systems for capturing and\nanalysing the risk in respect of investment in debt securities and for taking timely remedial\nmeasures. The FIs should also put in place appropriate systems to ensure that investment in6\nprivately placed instruments is made in accordance with the systems and procedures\nprescribed under the FI\u2019s investment policy.\n6.2 The Board should put in place a monitoring system to ensure that the prudential limits\nprescribed in paragraphs 5 above are scrupulously complied with, including the system for\naddressing the breaches, if any, due to rating migration.\n6.3 Boards of the FIs should review the following aspects of investment in debt securities,\ntwice a year:\na) Total turnover (investment and divestment) during the reporting period;\nb) Compliance with the prudential limits prescribed by the Board for such\ninvestments;\nc) Rating migration of the issuers / securities held in the books of the FIs and\nconsequent diminution in the portfolio quality; and\nd) Extent of non-performing investments in the fixed income category.\n7 Reporting requirements\n7.1 In order to help  in the creation of a central database on private placement of debt, the\ninvesting FIs should file a copy of all offer documents with the Credit Information Bureau\n(India) Ltd. ( CIBIL). When the FIs themselves raise debt through private placement, they\nshould also file a copy of the offer document with CIBIL.\n7.2 Any default relating to payment of interest / repayment of instalment in respect of any\nprivately placed debt should also be reported to CIBIL by the investing FIs along with a copy\nof the offer document.\n8. Disclosures\nThe FIs should disclose the details of the issuer composition of investments made through\nprivate placement and the non-performing investments in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 of the\nbalance sheet, with effect from the year ending March 31, 2004 (June 30, 2004 in case of\nNHB ) in the format furnished in the Appendix .\n9. Trading and settlement in debt securities\nAs per the SEBI guidelines, all trades, with the exception of the spot transactions, in a listed\ndebt security, shall be executed only on the trading platform of a stock exchange. In addition\nto complying with the SEBI guidelines, the FIs should ensure that all spot transactions in listed\nand unlisted debt securities are reported on the NDS and settled through the Clearing\nCorporation of India Limited ( CCIL) from a date to be notified by RBI.\n*********\nAPPENDIX\nFormat for disclosure in the \u201cnotes on accounts\u201d in the Annual published reports7\nA.

Venugopal Reddy, Governor,\nReserve Bank of India on Mid-term Review of\nMonetary and Credit Policy for the year 2003-04\nThe Statement on Mid-term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy consists of three\nparts: I. Mid-term Review of Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments in 2003-04 ; II.\nStance of Monetary Policy for the Second Half of 2003-04; and III. Financial Sector Reforms\nand Monetary Policy Measures.\n2. This Statement follows the pattern already set in the previous years \u2013  both in outline and\nin substance.  As has been the practice in the past, and as emphasised by my predecessor, Dr.\nBimal Jalan, monetary measures have to be taken promptly and effectively, to respond to the\nrapid developments in both the domestic and global markets.  At the same time, the Annual\nMonetary and Credit Policy announced in April/May and the Mid-term Review in October/\nNovember serve several purposes: as a framework for or supplement to the monetary and other\nrelevant measures that are taken from time to time to capture events affecting macroeconomic\nassessments, in particular relating to fiscal management as well as seasonal factors; and to set out\nthe logic, intentions and actions related to the structural and prudential aspects of the financial\nsector in our country.  Further, the biannual Statements add to greater transparency, better\ncommunication and contribute to an effective consultation process.\nI. Mid-term Review of Macroeconomic and\nMonetary Developments in 2003-04\nDomestic Developments\n3. The a nnual Statement on monetary and credit policy released on April 29, 2003 projected\nGDP  growth of about 6.0 per cent for the year 2003-04, based on the assumption of rainfall at\naround 96 per cent of its long period average, recovery in agricultural output by over 3.1 per cent\ncoupled with continuance of the upturn in the industrial sector.  There have been a number of\ndevelopments since then that are likely to have a positive impact on the growth rate. First,\naccording to the India Meteorological Department ( IMD), the South-West monsoon this year has\nbeen widespread and better than that anticipated earlier. Second, industrial growth continues to\nremain satisfactory.  Third, export growth appears to have been sustained, although at a rate\nlower than the high rate of last year; however, improved prospects for global recovery should\nprovide fresh impetus to export growth.  It is noteworthy that non-oil imports have increased\nreflecting strengthening of domestic demand.  Fourth, business expectations are positive. In\naddition, the underlying financial conditions of inflation, interest rates and liquidity, supported\nby the current policy stance, are expected to provide a favourable environment for higher growth.\n4. The official estimate of the Central Stati stical Organisation ( CSO) for GDP growth\navailable for the first quarter of 2003-04 (5.7 per cent) is marginally higher than that in the\ncorresponding quarter of the previous year (5.3 per cent).  The behaviour of the South-West\nmonsoon this year was better than that in the last four years: cumulative rainfall was 102 per cent\nof normal and spatial distribution showed that 33 out of 36 meteorological sub-divisions received\nnormal or excess rainfall.  Taking into account the performance of the South-West monsoon, it is\nexpected that agricultural GDP during the current year would exhibit a high growth after the\ndecline of 3.2 per cent last year.  During April-August 2003, the Index of Industrial Production2\n(IIP) increased by 5.6 per cent, which is higher than 5.2 per cent recorded in the corresponding\nperiod of the previous year.  There are indications of sustained growth in the production of basic\ngoods, capital goods and consumer goods.  During April-September 2003, while growth in\nexports at 10.0 per cent in US dollar terms was lower than 18.0 per cent in the corresponding\nperiod of the previous year, growth in imports was higher at 21.4 per cent as against 9.2 per cent\nin the corresponding period of the previous year.\n5. On current reckoning, based on the g rowth prospects across the sectors of the economy,\nand assuming the continuance of good performance in industry and some acceleration in exports\nreflecting the anticipated global economic recovery, it is reasonable to expect an overall GDP\ngrowth of 6.5 to 7.0 per cent, with an upward bias, for the year 2003-04, as compared with the\nearlier projection of around 6.0 per cent.\n6. Scheduled commercial banks\u2019 credit increased by 3.2 per cent  (Rs.23 ,196 crore) up to\nOctober 17, 2003 as compared with an increase of  6.5 per cent (Rs.38,571 crore),  net of\nmergers, in the corresponding period of last year.  Food credit declined by Rs.15 ,328 crore as\ncompared with a decline of Rs.1,273 crore in the previous year.  Non-food credit increased by\n5.7 per cent (Rs.38 ,524 crore) as compared with  an increase of 7.4 per cent (Rs.39,844 crore),\nnet of mergers, in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Some new trends in the credit\nmarket are noteworthy. In recent years, retail credit has grown significantly, particularly to the\nhousing sector. The Reserve Bank has also recently removed the interest rate restriction of the\nprime lending rate (PLR) being the floor rate for loans to the retail and personal segment. This\nmeasure should provide further impetus to retail lending. Nevertheless, keeping in view the\nintense competition in this sector, banks need to sharpen their risk assessment techniques so as to\nguard against any adverse impact on credit quality.\n7. As regards industrial credit, the feedba ck on industry-wise credit flows received from\nbanks for April-September 2003 reveals that, at a disaggregated level, there was a discernible\nincrease in credit to tea, jute textiles, gems & jewellery, computer software and infrastructure.\nOn the other hand, decline in credit was observed in coal, petroleum, iron & steel, mining, rubber\nand rubber products, automobiles and food processing.\n8. Scheduled commercial banks\u2019 investments in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector\nundertakings and private corporate sector, commercial paper ( CP) etc., declined by 2.6 per cent\n(Rs.2 ,432 crore) up to October 17, 2003 as compared with an increase of 10.6 per cent (Rs.8,561\ncrore) in the corresponding period of the previous year. Together with such investments, the total\nflow of resources from scheduled commercial banks to the commercial sector increased by 4.7\nper cent (Rs.36 ,631 crore) as against a higher increase of 7.8 per cent (Rs.48,071 crore), net of\nmergers, in the corresponding period of the previous year. The year-on-year growth in resource\nflow was also lower at 13.9 per cent as against 16.0 per cent, net of mergers, a year ago.\nScheduled commercial banks\u2019 investments in instruments issued by financial institutions and\nmutual funds this year (up to October 17, 2003) increased by Rs.6 ,423 crore as compared with a\nlower increase of Rs.4,626 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  At Rs.55 ,045\ncrore, the total resource flow to the commercial sector including capital issues, Global\nDepository Receipts  (GDRs)/American Depository Receipts ( ADRs)  and borrowings from\nfinancial institutions during the financial year so far (up to October 17, 2003) is comparable with\nincrease of Rs.55,697 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.3\n9. In the current financial year up to October 17, 2003, money supply (M 3) increased by 7.4\nper cent (Rs.1 ,27,747 crore) as compared with 8.1 per cent (Rs.1,21,384 crore) in the\ncorresponding period of the previous year, after adjusting for mergers. On an annual basis,\ngrowth in M 3 at 11.9 per cent was within the projected level, but lower than that of 14.0 per cent\nin the previous year. The aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks rose by 8.2 per cent\n(Rs.1 ,04,988 crore) as compared with an increase of 9.1 per cent (Rs.1,00,635 crore) in the\ncorresponding period of the previous year. On an annual basis, growth in aggregate deposits at\n11.7 per cent was lower than that of 14.5 per cent a year ago. Overall, the growth in M 3 and\ndeposits has been within the projected level envisaged at the beginning of the year in the annual\npolicy Statement.\n10. RBI\u2019s net foreign currency assets (adjusted for revaluation), increased significantly by\nRs.63 ,873 crore up to October 24, 2003,  a figure much higher than the increase of Rs.38,452\ncrore during the corresponding period of the previous year. Despite such large inflows, reserve\nmoney increased by only 3.5 per cent (Rs.12 ,762 crore)  in this year so far, as against an increase\nof 0.4 per cent (Rs.1,191 crore) in the corresponding period of the previous year. This was\nmainly due to substantial open market operations ( OMO) by the Reserve Bank. Consequently,\nthe net RBI credit to the Central Government showed a larger decline of 41.0 per cent (Rs.46 ,300\ncrore) than the decline of 15.7 per cent (Rs.22,219 crore) in the corresponding period of the\nprevious year.  RBI\u2019s credit to banks and commercial sector also declined due to their reduced\nreliance on the standing facilities emanating from comfortable liquidity conditions.\n11. As regards the components of reserve money, bankers\u2019 deposits with RBI decreased by\n13.4 per cent (Rs.11 ,160 crore) up to October 24, 2003 as compared with a decline of 14.2 per\ncent (Rs.11,956 crore) in the corresponding period of the previous year reflecting the impact of\nreduction in cash reserve ratio ( CRR). Currency in circulation increased by 8.1 per cent\n(Rs.22 ,893 crore), a rate higher than the 5.1 per cent (Rs.12,688 crore) in the previous year.\n12. It may be recalled that the annual policy Statement had projected, for policy purposes, the\ninflation rate to be in the range of 5.0-5.5 per cent, on a point-to-point basis, at the end of 2003-\n04.  This projection was made at a time when inflation was accelerating and had touched 6.7 per\ncent during the first week of April 2003.  Moreover, there were considerable uncertainties over\nthe movements of international oil prices in the aftermath of the Iraq war, and the behaviour of\nthe South-West monsoon was unclear. Notwithstanding these concerns, the Reserve Bank had\nassessed that the inflation rate would moderate.  Accordingly, the Reserve Bank had proposed to\ncontinue with the policy stance of maintaining adequate liquidity in the system and a soft interest\nrate environment.  On the price scenario, the developments have been in the direction visualised\nthrough a forward-looking approach by the Reserve Bank in April 2003.\n13. The annual rate of inflation as measured by variations in the wholesale price index\n(WPI), on a point-to-point basis, remained high in the range of 6.3-6.9 per cent during the first\ntwo months of this year.  Thereafter, it has declined to 5.0 per cent by October 18, 2003.  Annual\ninflation for \u2018fuel, power, light and lubricants\u2019 group (weight: 14.2 per cent)  at 4.8 per cent this\nyear was similar to last year.  Prices of primary articles (weight: 22.0 per cent) increased by 5.1\nper cent as against 2.5 per cent last year. Among primary articles, the increase in prices was\nmainly observed in non-food articles such as oilseeds and fibres. Prices of manufactured\nproducts (weight: 63.7 per cent) increased by 5.1 per cent as compared with 2.7 per cent last\nyear. Among manufactured products, increase in prices was observed in edible oils, tea & coffee,\ncotton textiles, basic metals and alloys.4\n14. The annual policy Statement had identified certain commodities  (weight :15.4 per cent)\nwhere prices were affected by either drought conditions or external supply shocks.  Excluding\nthe price increases due to such items (mineral oils, oilseeds, edible oils, oil cakes and fibres)\nfrom the WPI basket, the inflation rate worked out to 4.3 per cent as on October 18, 2003 as\nagainst 2.9 per cent at end-March 2003.  Annual inflation, as measured by variations in the\nConsumer Price Index ( CPI) for industrial workers, on a point-to-point basis, has remained\nmoderate at 2.9 per cent in September 2003 as against 4.3 per cent a year ago.\n15. On an annual average basis, WPI inflation was 4.9 per cent as on October 18, 2003 as\nagainst 2.3 per cent a year ago.  The annual average CPI inflation was 3.9 per cent by September\n2003 as against 4.6 per cent a year ago.\n16. The probability of emergence of any undue pressure on prices during this year appears to\nbe low on current indications. First, the good monsoon and expected recovery of agricultural\nproduction would have a favourable impact on prices of agricultural commodities. Second, the\ncomfortable stocks of foodgrains and foreign exchange reserves would facilitate better supply\nmanagement in the unlikely event of price pressures in agricultural commodities. Third, the\nprices of \u2018fuel, power, light and lubricants\u2019 so far have remained moderate in the absence of any\nrenewed pressure on international oil prices, particularly in the wake of reduction in geopolitical\ntensions in the Middle-East. Fourth, both M 3 and reserve money growth have remained subdued.\nOn the basis of the above and in the absence of any serious adverse shocks, especially on the oil\nfront, the inflation rate may turn out to be lower than the range of 5.0 to 5.5 per cent envisaged in\nthe annual policy Statement. It is reasonable, therefore, to project for policy purposes the point-\nto-point annual rate of inflation by end 2003-04 to be in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent, with a\npossible downward bias. The Reserve Bank would continue to closely monitor the price\nbehaviour leaving no room for complacency on the inflation front.\n17. The Union Budget for 2003-04 placed the net and gross  market borrowings of the Central\nGovernment at Rs.1 ,07,194 crore and Rs.1,66,230 crore, respectively. The Central Government\ncompleted net market borrowings of Rs.67 ,317 crore (62.8 per cent of the budgeted amount) and\ngross borrowings of Rs.1,01,035 crore  (60.8 per cent of the budgeted amount) up to end-October\n2003.  Further, an amount of Rs.14 ,434 crore was raised in lieu of the securities bought back\nunder the buyback auction of high-coupon government securities.  Taking into account the\namount of Rs.32 ,602 crore received from States under the debt-swap scheme, the market\nborrowing programme as per the indicative calendar of the Central Government for the second\nhalf of 2003-04 has been reduced. Prevailing liquidity conditions facilitated the Government to\nborrow at a substantially lower cost during  2003-04 than in the previous year. The weighted\naverage yield on government borrowings through dated securities at 5.87 per cent this year, so\nfar, has been significantly lower than 7.34 per cent last year by 147 basis points. As part of the\ndebt management strategy, RBI combined auction issues with acceptance by private placement\nof dated securities consistent with market conditions.\n18. The gross fiscal deficit of the Central Government at Rs.81 ,014 crore up to September\n2003 was higher by about 40.3 per cent over the corresponding period of last year and\nconstituted 52.7 per cent of the budget estimate for the current year.  Revenue deficit of the\nCentral Government at Rs.65 ,427 crore up to September 2003 was higher by about 37.4 per cent\nover the corresponding period of last year and accounted for about 58.3 per cent of the budget\nestimate for the whole year. The state governments have prepaid Rs.32 ,602 crore of central\ngovernment debt by borrowing from the market (Rs.22,089 crore) and also utilising a part of the5\nadditional receipts under small savings (Rs.10,513  crore).  Such market borrowings by the state\ngovernments were in addition to the normal market borrowings of Rs.16 ,663 crore (up to end-\nOctober 2003). The persistence of large aggregate borrowing of the Central and state\ngovernments continues to be a matter of concern. Such concerns arise both out of a possible\nadverse impact on the desired acceleration in growth that is consistent with stability, and also\nfrom possible implications for efficient monetary and debt management.  It is, therefore,\nessential to pursue, promptly and with resolve, fiscal consolidation from a medium-term\nperspective.  There is need for efforts in the direction of widening the revenue base,\nrationalisation of expenditures, and above all enhancing productivity of public investments,\nalready made or to be made, in both commercial and social sectors. In this regard, the highest\npriority being accorded to eliminate revenue deficits at the Centre and States is welcome.\n19. Scheduled commercial banks\u2019 investment in government and other approved securities at\nRs.87 ,754 crore this year (up to October 17, 2003) has been higher than Rs.72,110 crore, net of\nmergers, in the corresponding period of the previous year. Commercial banks hold government\nand other approved securities much in excess of the prescribed statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR).\nThe excess holding of SLR securities at Rs.2 ,53,474 crore, constitutes 16.6 per cent of net\ndemand and time liabilities ( NDTL) of banks.  Thus, for the banking system as a whole, the\neffective SLR investment at 41.6 per cent of NDTL is much higher relative to the statutory\nminimum of 25 per cent.\n20. During 2003-04 so far, financial markets have remained generally stable and interest\nrates have softened further with liquidity in the system. First, average daily absorption through\nrepo transactions under LAF during the year (up to end-October 2003) was higher at Rs.29 ,310\ncrore as against  Rs.13,836 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Second, the\naverage call money rate moved down from 5.86 per cent in March 2003 to 4.64 per cent by\nOctober 2003.  Third, the 91-day and the 364-day Treasury Bill rates have declined from 5.89\nper cent each to 4.94 and 4.72 per cent, respectively.  Fourth, the yield on government securities\nwith 10-year residual maturity declined from 6.21 per cent to 5.11 per cent.  Fifth, the public\nsector banks have reduced their deposit rates over one year from a range of 5.25-7.00 per cent in\nMarch 2003 to 5.0-6.0 per cent by October 2003.  However, while lending rates for prime\ncorporates and activities like housing have declined significantly, noticeable reduction is yet to\ntake place in regard to other segments.\n21. As indicated in the annual poli cy Statement of April 2002, in order to have greater degree\nof transparency in regard to actual lending rates, banks were advised to provide information on\nmaximum and minimum interest rates charged to their borrowers.  According to the information\nsupplied by the banks and placed on the RBI website, the median lending rates on demand and\nterm loans levied by public sector banks remained unchanged in a range of  11.5-14.0 per cent\nbetween March and June 2003.  The range of prime lending rates ( PLRs) of public sector banks\nremained unchanged at 9.0-12.25 per cent although 14 public sector banks have lowered their\nPLRs by 25-75 basis points between March and October 2003.\n22. The risk premium on private sector bonds, as measured by the yield spread b etween\nhighly rated corporate paper and government securities, has declined.  For example, the spread\nbetween AAA-rated corporate bonds of 5 years and the yield on government securities of similar\nmaturity narrowed from 87 basis points in March 2003 to 65 basis points by October 2003.6\n23. The Reserve Bank will continue to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained in the\nsystem so that all legitimate requirements for credit are met consistent with the objective of price\nstability.  Towards this end, RBI will continue with its policy of active demand management of\nliquidity through open market operations ( OMO) as well as liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF),\nand using the policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants.\nExternal Developments\n24. The prospects for the world economy have improved since April 2003 when the annual\npolicy Statement was presented.  Several uncertainties relating to the Iraq war, impact of SARS,\nand volatility in oil prices have turned out to be short-lived. Reflecting these developments, oil\nprices reverted to lower levels although they have recovered somewhat thereafter.  Financial\nmarkets, which were in a state of flux, especially equity markets, have also rebounded in many\ncountries.  Interest rates in several countries have continued to decline to historically low levels.\nWhile the outlook on Euro area remains flat, there are signs of pick up in growth in the US and\nrecovery in Japan.  Emerging markets in Asia are staging a strong recovery and both India and\nChina are expected to record large expansion in output.  Some acceleration in growth is also\nanticipated for Africa and Latin America.  Notwithstanding these favourable developments, the\nworld economic outlook continues to face some downside risks. While uncertainties in the world\neconomy have persisted for some time now, the Indian economy in recent times has not only\nshowed considerable resilience to shocks but also demonstrated good economic performance on\nthe domestic and external fronts.\n25. The Indian forex market generally witnessed orderly conditions during the current\nfinancial year (April-October 2003).  The exchange rate of the rupee which was Rs. 47.50 per\nUS dollar at end-March 2003 appreciated by 4.8 per cent to Rs.45.32 per US dollar by end-\nOctober 2003 but depreciated by 2.3 per cent against Euro, 2.5 per cent against Pound sterling\nand 4.2 per cent against Japanese yen during the period.  Foreign exchange reserves increased by\nUS $ 17.2 billion from US $ 75.4 billion in end-March 2003 to US $ 92.6 billion by end-October\n2003.\n26. In recent years, the annual policy Statements as well as mid-term Reviews have\nattempted to bring into sharper focus the main lessons emerging from our experience in\nmanaging the external sector during periods of external and domestic uncertainties.  The broad\nprinciples that have guided exchange rate management are:\n\u00b7 Careful monitoring and management of exchange rates without  a fixed target or a pre-\nannounced target or a band.  Flexibility in the exchange rate together with ability to\nintervene, if and when necessary.\n\u00b7 A policy to build a higher level of foreign exchange reserves which takes into account\nnot only anticipated current account deficits but also \u201cliquidity at risk\u201d arising from\nunanticipated capital movements.\n\u00b7 A judicious policy for management of capital account.\n27. As pointed out in the recent policy Statements, the overall approach to the management\nof India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves in recent years has reflected the changing composition of7\nthe balance of payments, and has endeavoured to reflect the \u201cliquidity risks\u201d associated with\ndifferent types of flows and other requirements.  The policy for reserve management is thus\njudiciously built upon a host of identifiable factors and other contingencies.  Taking these factors\ninto account, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are at present comfortable and consistent with the\nrate of growth, the share of the external sector in the economy and the size of risk-adjusted\ncapital flows.\n28. During t his period, the payments obligation on account of redemption of Resurgent India\nBonds ( RIBs) of US $ 5.5 billion was discharged without any adverse impact either on Indian\nfinancial market or on reserves. The management of RIB redemption was carefully weaved into\nIndia\u2019s reserve management policy in close co-ordination with the State Bank of India ( SBI).\nAccordingly, redemption of these bonds was carried out smoothly on October 1, 2003 without\ncausing any stress on domestic liquidity, interest rates and exchange rate.  While RBI made\navailable the foreign currency requirements of SBI on the date of redemption, SBI had built up\nadequate amount of rupee resources to fund foreign currency purchases from RBI.  In order to\nsmoothen the impact of the redemption over time , RBI had contracted forward foreign currency\nassets which took care of a major portion of the requirements. The balance requirements were\nmet out of the foreign exchange reserves.  Overall, although RIB redemption was large in\nmagnitude, it had little impact on the reserves as well as domestic markets including money,\nforeign exchange and securities markets.\n29. India\u2019s exports during the first half of the current financial year increased by 10.0 per\ncent in US dollar terms as compared with 18.0 per cent in the corresponding period of the\nprevious year. During the same period, imports rose faster by 21.4 per cent as against an increase\nof 9.2 per cent in the corresponding period of last year. Oil imports increased by 6.3 per cent in\nUS dollar terms as compared with 12.6 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.\nNon-oil imports increased by 28.0 per cent as against an increase of 7.8 per cent in the\ncorresponding period of the previous year.   As a result,  the overall trade deficit at US $ 7.1\nbillion during April-September 2003 was higher than the deficit of US $ 3.5 billion in the\ncorresponding period of the previous year.  The higher trade deficit this year, in substantial part,\nreflects growth in import demand emanating from a pick-up in economic activity as reflected in\nhigher capital goods imports.\n30. The current account of the balance of payments, which had remained  in surplus\nconsecutively in the previous six quarters, showed a deficit of US $ 1.2 billion during April-June\n2003. The trade deficit (on payment basis )  of US $ 5.9 billion was offset to a large extent by\nprivate transfers of  US $ 4.2 billion. In addition, there was a significant increase of US $ 6.4\nbillion in net capital inflows comprising mainly foreign investment  (US $ 2.8 billion), NRI\ndeposits (US $ 1.7 billion) and external loans (US $ 1.2 billion).  As a result, the net accretion to\nforeign exchange reserves, including valuation change, amounted to US $ 6.7 billion during the\nfirst quarter of 2003-04.  While for  well-known reasons it is difficult to anticipate the behaviour\nof capital flows, the positive sentiment on India should augur well for continued buoyancy, but\nsome moderation should not be ruled out if the stance of monetary policies in leading industrial\neconomies were to transit from soft or neutral to a relatively tighter regime.\n31. Some adjustments have been made in the recent past regarding policies relating to\ninterest rates on non-resident deposits in response to changing conditions in the financial\nmarkets.  A ceiling of 250 basis points above the corresponding US dollar LIBOR /Swap rates\nwas placed on the interest rates on fresh non-resident external ( NRE ) deposits effective July 17,8\n2003 which was reduced to 100 basis points on September 15, 2003 and further to 25 basis\npoints on October 18, 2003.  In addition, after a review of the investment activities of Overseas\nCorporate Bodies ( OCBs), in consultation with Government of India, they were derecognised as\na distinct eligible class of investors in India with effect from September 16, 2003. They will now\nbe treated on par with any other foreign investors.  Consistent with the objectives of Offshore\nBanking Units ( OBUs ) located in Special Economic Zones ( SEZs ), their exposure to the\nDomestic Tariff Area ( DTA ) has been restricted to a limit of 25 per cent of their previous\nworking day\u2019s total liabilities only, under the scheme of External Commercial Borrowings\n(ECBs ), subject to FEMA  regulations.  Further, a bank cannot borrow from its OBU.  These\nguidelines were put into effect on October 10, 2003.\nOverall Assessment\n32. In sum, from an overall policy perspective and in qualitative terms,  the major\ndevelopments since April 2003 and consequently the areas that may need further attention for\npolicy purposes can be as follows:\n(a) The macroeconomic environment has improved during the year with a positive\noutlook on both the domestic and external fronts. The growth prospects are better, the inflation\noutlook remains benign, the interest rates and foreign exchange reserves are at comfortable levels\nand there is adequate liquidity in the system.  This optimism is also reflected in business\nconfidence surveys conducted by various agencies including RBI\u2019s own internal assessment.\nFurther, the strengthening of business fundamentals is being reinforced by upgrades in corporate\ncredit ratings. The assessment of the international community, including rating agencies, on\nIndia\u2019s growth prospects has turned more positive.\n(b) The point-to-point WPI inflation is expected to moderate by the end of the year.\nHowever, annual inflation as measured by the WPI, has been higher this year so far than the\ncorresponding period last year both on an overall basis and excluding the commodities affected\nby either drought conditions or external supply shocks (mineral oils, oilseeds, edible oils, oil\ncakes and fibres).  While the economy has resources as well as resilience to withstand supply\nshocks, the possible consequences of continued abundance of liquidity need to be monitored\ncarefully.  The gains obtained in recent years from the reining in of inflationary expectations\nneed to be consolidated and reinforced.  It is important to appreciate that sustained efforts over\ntime helped to build confidence in price stability and that inflationary expectations can turn\nadverse in a relatively short time if noticeable adverse movements in prices take place. Hence, a\ncontinued emphasis on vigil on the price level is essential.\n(c) The investment climate has improved during the year which is reflected in the\nfunctioning of various segments of the financial market. With comfortable liquidity, the call and\nterm money market rates have hovered around the repo rate.  The yield curve which has been\nflattening for most part of the year, steepened somewhat following the repo rate cut on August\n25, 2003.  The foreign exchange market remained stable. While the rupee appreciated against the\nUS dollar, it depreciated against other major currencies.  The capital market has also  experienced\nheightened activity for several reasons such as abundant global and domestic liquidity, general\nupward trend in stock prices worldwide and  attractiveness of valuations of stocks in India. It is\nreported that large-scale corporate restructuring has already taken place and productivity gains\nharnessed to a significant degree out of investments made in the restructuring of industry, and in\nthis light there could be a revival of investment demand at this juncture.9\n(d) Financial market sentiments are stronger now compared to the beginning of the year.\nHowever, there is need for continuous and careful monitoring since in the upturn of the business\ncycle there could be overshooting of markets. It is important for the financial intermediaries to\nnote the cautionary views expressed in the previous policy Statements that, in case the present\nmarket conditions change, it may be appropriate to take monetary measures that may not be in\nconsonance with the present easy conditions.  Keeping these realities in view, it is particularly\nimportant for banks and financial institutions to make adequate allowance for unforeseen\ncontingencies in their business plans, and to take full account of the implications on their\noperations of possible changes in the monetary and external environment.\n(e) The health of the financial sector continued to improve during the period. The\nReserve Bank\u2019s sustained efforts in implementing prudential norms in a phased manner and in\nstrengthening the supervision and monitoring of banks in line with international best practices,\nhave enhanced the outlook of the financial sector. Improvements have taken place in asset\nquality, profitability, capital adequacy and efficiency of banks, and financial institutions ( FIs) are\nbeing strengthened.  While concerns still remain with regard to the functioning of a segment of\nthe financial sector comprising co-operative banks and NBFCs, the overall resilience of the\nbanking and financial sector is encouraging.   \n(f) Whereas credit growth remained subdued till August 2003, there are since some signs\nof pick-up in non-food credit.  On the supply side, RBI has been pursuing policies to ensure the\navailability of adequate credit to productive sectors, besides maintaining a soft interest rate\nstance so as to support investment demand. On the demand side, the financing requirement of\nlarge corporates has eased because of financial restructuring, improvements in productivity,\noptimisation of inventory cycles, better cash flow management, access to alternative sources of\nfunds such as external commercial borrowings and a higher dependence on internal resources.\nAs growth in large corporates usually provides spin-offs for small and medium enterprises\n(SMEs), including ancillary units, the credit requirement of this sector may be expected to\nincrease gradually now.  Banks can also tap the large demand for funds arising from  the capital\nrequirements of the infrastructure sector \u2013 especially power, ports and roads \u2013 provided the\nregulatory and other institutional factors ensure cost recovery. Similarly, credit demand from the\nagricultural sector may also rise with increasing commercialisation, provided the domestic\ntrading environment as well as relevant transport, storage facilities etc., are improved\nexpeditiously.  To fully exploit the emerging opportunities, there is a need to further improve\ninstitutional as well as incentive  mechanisms in banks to strengthen credit delivery to SMEs,\ninfrastructure and agriculture. In this regard, it is imperative that a conducive credit culture is\nnurtured among financial intermediaries, corporates and households.\n(g) Apart from subdued credit growth, which will continue to cause concern unless the\nanticipated pick-up materialises, the fact of overall rigidity in the downward movement of\nlending rates as well as inadequacy in quality of service to some sections coupled with reduction\nin deposit rates requires  introspection and immediate action on the part of all financial\nintermediaries.  Trends in the flow and composition of savings as well as availability of credit to\nsome highly productive and socially critical sectors should be a matter of importance to all in the\nfinancial system. While credible actions, particularly by the commercial banks, would be\nessential, innovative measures by all concerned may have to be considered in due course if\nadequate progress in credit delivery accompanied by appropriate transparency in credit pricing is\nnot observed soon.10\n(h) It is necessary to appreciate that with continued positive developments in the external\nsector during the year over the significant progress made in recent years, substantial strength has\nbeen imparted to  the economic management of our country by the virtual elimination of the\nbinding forex constraints experienced since 1956. The strong  external sector performance of\nIndia is reflected not only in the comfortable level of reserves but also in the quality emanating\nfrom non-debt creating flows. The more competitive external orientation of the economy adds to\nfurther strength.  These positive developments in the external sector, accompanied by price\nstability and stable financial markets accord comfort to the conduct of public policies.\nII. Stance of Monetary Policy for\nthe Second Half of 2003-04\n33. The annual policy Statement of April 2003 had indicated that, according to the present\nassessment and barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in the\nvarious sectors of the economy, the overall stance of monetary policy for 2003-04 will be:\n\u2022 Provision of adequate liquidity to meet credit growth and support investment demand in\nthe economy while continuing a vigil on movements in the price level.\n\u2022 In line with the above, to continue with the present stance of preference for a soft and\nflexible interest rate environment within the framework of macroeconomic stability.\n34. Monetary management in the first half of 2003-04 was largely in conformity with the\nmonetary policy stance announced in the annual policy Statement.  A steady increase in net\nforeign currency assets of RBI in the face of subdued credit demand created a situation of excess\nliquidity throughout the first-half of the year posing a major challenge for liquidity management.\nThe Reserve Bank, therefore, had to manage liquidity actively through open market operations\n(OMO) and through the liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF) in order to maintain a stable interest\nrate environment. The average daily absorption through repo transactions under LAF during the\nyear so far (up to end-October 2003) amounted to Rs.29 ,310 crore as against an average of\nRs.13,836 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The interest rates in money\nmarket and  government securities market ruled lower than at the beginning of the financial year.\nMore than 60 per cent of the market borrowing programme of the Government could be\ncompleted at a much lower cost, with longer maturities and without any adverse impact on the\ngeneral interest rate structure.  In tandem with market trends and with the anticipation of better\ngrowth and inflation prospects, the LAF repo rate was reduced from 5.0 per cent to 4.5 per cent\non August 25, 2003. Notwithstanding the comfortable liquidity position emanating from the\nforeign exchange build up, RBI made further progress towards its medium-term objective of\nreduction in the cash reserve ratio ( CRR). The CRR was reduced from 4.75 per cent to 4.5 per\ncent in June 2003 augmenting the lendable resources of banks by about Rs.3 ,500 crore.\n35. In the Part I of this  Review, detailed discussions on the likely levels of major monetary\naggregates have been presented after assessing the relevant factors. In the light of the discussion,\nfor the purpose of monetary management, ( i) GDP growth in 2003-04 is placed at 6.5 to 7.0 per\ncent, with an upward bias, as against 6.0 per cent envisaged earlier; (ii) inflation, on a point-to-\npoint basis could be in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent, with a downward bias,  as against 5.0 to 5.511\nper cent projected earlier; (iii) expansion in M 3 would be around 14.0 per cent as projected\nearlier; (iv) growth in aggregate deposits would be Rs.1 ,79,000 crore as projected earlier; and (v)\nnon-food bank credit including investments in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector\nundertakings and private corporate sector, commercial paper ( CP) etc., is expected to increase by\nabout 15.5 -16.0 per cent, as projected earlier.\n36. Since announcement of the annual policy Statement in April 2003, the world economic\noutlook has improved; GDP  growth is placed higher; the outlook for inflation is more benign;\nexpansion in money supply is within the trajectory; and financial markets, especially forex\nmarkets, are stable though they displayed more than usual activity.  The flow of credit has been\nless than anticipated so far though more recent indications point towards improvement in the\nremaining part of the year.  While capital flows are stronger, current account is possibly turning\nto deficit. Consistent with these developments, it is proposed to continue with the overall stance\nof monetary policy announced in the annual policy Statement for the remaining half of the\ncurrent year.\nIII. Financial Sector Reforms and\n Monetary Policy Measures\n37. The annual policy Statements as well as mid-term Reviews of RBI have been focusing on\nthe structural and regulatory measures to strengthen the financial system.  These measures have\nbeen guided by the objectives of increasing operational efficacy of monetary policy, redefining\nthe regulatory role of the Reserve Bank, strengthening prudential norms, and developing\ntechnological and institutional infrastructure.  This section reviews the progress of\nimplementation of the measures initiated so far and proposes some further measures to meet the\nemerging challenges in the financial sector.\n38. The emphasis at this stage is on continuance of measures already taken with an accent on\nimplementation, facilitating ease of transactions by the common person, further broadening of\nthe consultative process and continued emphasis on institutional capacity to support growth\nconsistent with stability in a medium-term perspective. It is also proposed to consider\nstrengthening of the credit delivery system within the existing institutional framework so that\nfinancing gaps do not seriously constrain the desired acceleration in growth.\nMonetary Measures\n(a) Bank Rate\n39. In the annual policy Statement of April 2003, the Bank Rate was reduced from 6.25 per\ncent to 6.0 per cent with effect from the close of business on April 29, 2003.  It was also\nindicated that unless the domestic and international circumstances change, the policy bias in\nregard to the Bank Rate is to keep it stable until the mid-term Review of 2003-04.\n40. On a review of the macroeconomic developments, it is considered desirable to lea ve the\nBank Rate unchanged (at 6.0 per cent) at present.\n(b) Cash Reserve Ratio12\n41. In the annual policy Statement of April 2003, the cash reserve ratio ( CRR) was reduced\nfrom 4.75 per cent to 4.50 per cent effective fortnight beginning June 14, 2003.\n42. While the Reserve Bank continues to pursue its medium-term objective of reducing the\nCRR to the statutory minimum level of 3.0 per cent, on a review of the current liquidity situation,\nit is felt desirable to keep the present level of CRR (4.50 per cent) unchanged.\n(c) Review of Liquidity Adjustment Facility\n43. Pursuant to the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector\nReforms (1998), the liquidity adjustment facility  (LAF) was operationalised on June 5, 2000\nfollowing its announcement in the annual policy Statement of April 2000.  It was envisaged at\nthat time that the LAF would help the short-term money market interest rates to move within a\ncorridor and impart stability, facilitating emergence of a short-term rupee yield curve.  It was\nalso indicated therein that the LAF would be reviewed in the light of actual experience.\n44. Keeping in view subsequent developments in the financial market as also in technology,\nan Internal Group reviewed the operations of LAF in a cross-country perspective.  The draft\nReport of the Internal Group was discussed in the Technical Advisory Committee on Money and\nGovernment Securities Markets ( TAC) recently and has been revised in the light of discussions.\nIn view of the fact that LAF has emerged as a monetary policy instrument of RBI for modulating\nsystem liquidity, the \u201cReport of the Internal Group on Liquidity Adjustment Facility\u201d is being\nplaced on the RBI website www.rbi.org.in  for wider dissemination and comments. The\nguidelines on LAF will be finalised taking into account the suggestions received on the Report.\nInterest Rate Policy\nPrime Lending Rate and Spread\n45. In the annual policy Statement of April 2003, banks were advised to announce a\nbenchmark PLR with the approval of their Boards, taking into consideration: ( i) actual cost of\nfunds, (ii) operating expenses and (iii) a minimum margin to cover regulatory requirements of\nprovisioning and capital charge, and profit margin. It was also indicated that the system of\ndetermination of benchmark PLR by banks and the actual prevailing spreads around the\nbenchmark PLR would be reviewed in September 2003.\n46. Accordingly, the issues relating to the implementation of the system of benchmark PLR\nwere discussed with select banks and the Indian Banks Association ( IBA). The IBA has made\nthe following suggestions: ( i) permitting separate PLRs  for working capital and term loans, (ii)\ncontinuation of the practice of multiple PLRs , (iii) flexibility in offering fixed or floating rate\nloans based on time-varying term premia  and market benchmarks, (iv) flexibility in pricing of\nconsumer loans, and (v) accounting for transaction costs for different types of loans.\n47. It is clarified that since lending rates for working capital and term loans can be\ndetermined with reference to the benchmark PLR by taking into account term premia and/or risk\npremia, a need for multiple PLRs may not be compelling.  It is also clarified that banks have the\nfreedom to price their loan products based on time-varying term premia and relevant transaction13\ncosts.  Banks may price floating rate products by using market benchmarks in a transparent\nmanner.\n48. As IBA has indicated broad agreement with the approach proposed for the benchmark\nPLR, IBA may advise its members suitably, keeping in view the operational requirements.\nCredit Delivery Mechanism\n49. In continuation of several initiatives taken, and keeping in view the recent developments\nin credit flows to different sectors, some specific measures are proposed as under:\n(a) Priority Sector Lending\n(i) Credit Facilities for Small Scale Industries\n50. In the annual policy Statement of April 2002, the loan limit for dispensation of collateral\nrequirement was increased from Rs.5 lakh to Rs.15 lakh.  In order to further improve the flow of\ncredit to small scale industries ( SSIs), it is proposed that:\n\u2022 Banks may, on the basis of good track record and the financial position of the SSI units,\nincrease the loan limit from Rs.15 lakh up to Rs.25 lakh (with the approval of their\nBoards) for dispensation of collateral requirement.\n(ii) Deposits of Foreign Banks with SIDBI\n51. At present, foreign banks are required to deposit an amount equivalent to the shortfall in\ntheir priority sector target with Small Industries Development Bank of India ( SIDBI) at an\ninterest rate of 6.75 per cent. In order to increase the flow of credit to SSIs and to rationalise the\ninterest rates, it is proposed that:\n\u2022 The interest rate on the deposits of foreign banks placed with SIDBI towards their\npriority sector shortfall will be at the Bank Rate.\n\u2022 SIDBI will take appropriate steps to ensure that priority sector funds are utilised\nexpeditiously and benefits of reductions in interest rates passed on to the borrowers.\n(iii)  Lending by Banks to NBFCs\n52. As indicated in the annual  policy Statements of April 1999 and 2000, bank loans to non-\nbanking financial companies ( NBFCs) for the purpose of  on-lending to agriculture, tiny sector\nand small road and water transport operators are reckoned under priority sector lending. On a\nsuggestion from a Chamber of Commerce, and with a view to further enhancing the credit flow\nto SSI sector, it is proposed that:\n\u2022 All new loans granted by banks to NBFCs for the purpose of on-lending to SSI sector\nwould also be reckoned under priority sector lending.14\n(b) Advisory Committee on Flow of Credit to Agriculture and Related Activities\n53. It has been the endeavour of RBI to improve the agricultural credit delivery mechanism\nby simplifying procedures, encouraging decentralised decision-making and enhancing\ncompetition.  In order to progress further in meeting the credit needs of the agricultural sector, it\nis proposed to constitute an Advisory Committee to suggest short-term and medium-term\nmeasures to enhance credit flow to this sector.  While assessing the progress made in\nimplementation of Vyas  Committee, the Committee would, inter alia, look into the role of\nNational Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development ( NABARD ) in the development of the\nsector; the present structure and deployment of rural infrastructure development fund ( RIDF );\nrole of RRBs ; and incentive and attitudinal aspects of credit delivery.  It would suggest\nappropriate changes in the institutional and procedural arrangements for the smooth flow of\ncredit to agriculture.  The Committee is expected to address the issue of credit delivery to\nfarmers, especially small farmers, tenants, labourers, supplies of inputs to agriculture and\npurchases of output.  The Committee would explore the scope for involving innovative location-\nspecific catalytic agents to bridge the gap between banking institutions and the demand for\ntimely credit in rural areas, for investment in working capital and consumption smoothing. The\nCommittee is also expected to help in capturing new technological developments in the cause of\nimproving credit delivery.\n(c) Working Group on Flow of Credit to SSI Sector\n54. The small scale industries ( SSI) sector occupies an important position in the Indian\neconomy and provides employment and income generation.  Keeping in view the credit needs of\nthis sector, it is proposed to constitute a Working Group to assess the progress made in\nimplementation of Kapur  Committee and Gupta  Committee recommendations and suggest ways\nto improve credit flow considering, in particular, the backward and forward linkages of this\nsector with large corporates .  The Group will also look into methods of utilisation of priority\nsector shortfall deposits with SIDBI and suggest appropriate institutional arrangement for\nenhancing the credit delivery on a timely basis and in adequate measure to SSIs.\n(d) Micro-finance\n55. As indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2003, RBI constituted four informal\ngroups to examine various issues concerning micro-finance delivery.  On the basis of the\nrecommendations of the groups, it is proposed that: ( i) banks should provide adequate incentives\nto their branches in financing the self help groups ( SHGs ) and establish linkages with them\nmaking the procedures absolutely simple and easy while providing for total flexibility in such\nprocedures to suit local conditions; (ii) the group dynamics of working of the SHGs  may be left\nto themselves and need neither be regulated nor formal structures imposed or insisted upon; (iii)\nthe approach to micro-financing of SHGs  should be totally hassle-free and may include\nconsumption expenditures to enable smoothing of consumptions  as needed relative to time-\nprofile of income flows; (iv) NABARD  should reinforce its commitment to maintaining and\nenhancing the flow to micro-finance while simplifying the process; and  (v) NABARD  should\ndevise mechanisms to ensure sharing of experiences among the bank branches that are closely\ninvolved in extending micro-finance.\n(e) Survey on Kisan Credit Card ( KCC)15\n56. As indicated in the annu al policy Statement of April 2003, the survey for assessing the\nimpact of the Kisan Credit Card ( KCC) scheme was awarded to the National Council of Applied\nEconomic Research ( NCAER), New Delhi.  The NCAER has since launched the survey and the\nreport is expected by December 2003.\n(f) Infrastructure Financing\n57. As indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2003, on account of the high priority\naccorded by the Government to the infrastructure sector, RBI has taken a number of measures\nwith a view to providing incentives to banks to increase their credit flow to the infrastructure\nsector. These measures have given the initial impetus to the infrastructure sector as evident from\na sharp increase in flow of bank credit to this sector during this year. Though financing\nrequirement is large, the long-term potential for larger investments and better credit-recycling\nwould, no doubt, depend on commercial viability based on assured systems of cost recovery.\nMoney Market\n58. A number of money market reforms we re undertaken in recent years to preserve the\nintegrity of the financial market and to enable a balanced development of various segments of\nthe financial market.  Some further steps in the implementation of measures already announced\nare now proposed:\n(a) Moving towards Pure Inter-bank Call/Notice Money Market\n59. Following the recommendations of Narasimham Committee II, in the annual policy\nStatement of April 2001, the intention to move towards a pure inter-bank call/notice money\nmarket by gradually phasing out the non-bank participation was announced. In the annual policy\nStatement of April 2003, daily lending of non-bank participants in call/notice money market was\nreduced from 85 per cent to 75 per cent.  In view of further market developments as also to move\ntowards a pure inter-bank call/notice money market, it is proposed that:\n\u2022 With effect from the fortnight beginning December 27, 2003, non-bank participants\nwould be allowed to lend, on average  in a reporting fortnight, up to 60 per cent of their\naverage daily lending in call/notice money market during 2000-01.  The time-table for\nfurther phasing out of non-bank participation will be announced in consultation with\nmarket participants.\n60. In case a particular non-bank institution has genuine d ifficulty in developing proper\nalternative avenues for deployment of excess liquidity because of its size, RBI may consider\nproviding temporary permission to lend a higher amount in call/notice money market for a\nspecific period on a  case-by-case basis.\n(b) Rationalisation of Standing Facilities\n61. Banks are eligible for standing facility (export credit eligible for refinance) and PDs are\neligible for collateralised liquidity support from RBI subject to certain limits.  These limits are\nsplit into \u201cnormal\u201d facility and \u201cback-stop\u201d facility. With the emergence of the liquidity\nadjustment facility ( LAF) as an effective instrument in modulating system liquidity, in the mid-16\nterm Review of October 2002, the apportionment between \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cback-stop\u201d facilities\nwas changed to one-half each.  In view of current liquidity conditions, the utilisation of these\nfacilities by banks and PDs has been negligible.  In order to move further towards phasing out\nsector-specific standing facilities as also to rationalise the rates at which liquidity is injected into\nthe system, it is proposed that:\n\u2022 The \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cback-stop\u201d standing facilities will be available in a ratio of one-third\nto two-thirds (33:67) from the fortnight beginning December 27, 2003.\n(c) Primary Dealers\u2019 Access to Call/Notice Money Market\n62. Following the annual policy Statement of April 2002, it was announced in July 2002 that\naccess of PDs to borrow in call/notice money market would be gradually reduced in two stages\nsubject to certain market developments.  With a view to develop further the repo market as also\nto ensure a balanced development of various segments of money market, it is proposed that:\n\u2022 With effect from February 7, 2004 PDs will be allowed to borrow ,  on average basis  in a\nreporting fortnight, upto 200 per cent of their net owned funds (NOF) as at end-March of\npreceding financial year.\n63. Any PD which has genuine difficulties in adhering to the above schedule may approach\nRBI for appropriate reasonable dispensation with full justification for extension of period of\ncompliance sought.\n(d) Reporting of Call/Notice Money Market Transactions on NDS Platform\n64. As indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2003, it is mandatory for all NDS\nmembers to report all their call/notice money market deals on NDS. Deals done outside NDS\nshould also be reported within 15 minutes of the deal irrespective of the size of the deal or\nwhether the counterparty is a member of the NDS or not.  In order to facilitate the NDS members\nto report their deals among the NDS members and with non- NDS members, RBI has amended\nthe software incorporating the necessary changes and distributed it amongst NDS members in\nJuly 2003.  As a result of this, there has been significant increase in the reporting of deals.\nComplete dissemination of trade information relating to money, government securities and\nforeign exchange markets will improve transparency and strengthen efficiency in the market.  In\nthis direction, all NDS members should report their deals as soon as the deals are concluded.\nForeign Exchange Market\n(a) Unhedged Forex Exposures of Corporates\n65. As indicated in the mid-term Reviews of October 2001 and 2002 and reiterated in the\nannual policy Statement of April 2003, RBI has been expressing concern over unhedged foreign\ncurrency borrowings by corporates. However, it is noticed that despite such exhortations,\nhedging has not been ensured.  This may entail significant but avoidable risks to some corporate\nbalance sheets, possibly impacting the quality of banks\u2019 assets in some cases.  In view of this it\nhas been decided that, henceforth, all foreign currency loans by banks above US $ 10 million,17\ncan be extended only on the basis of a well laid out policy of the Board to ensure hedging, except\nin following cases:\n\u2022 Where forex loans are extended to finance exports, banks may not insist on hedging but\nassure themselves that such customers have uncovered receivables to cover the loan\namount.\n\u2022 Where the forex loans are extended for meeting forex expenditure.\n(b) Export Follow-up\n66. Exporters are normally required to realise the full value of export proceeds within 180\ndays of shipment. For exporters who are unable to realise the outstanding export dues, powers\nhave been delegated to authorised dealers ( ADs) to permit write-off up to 10 per cent of the total\nexport proceeds realised by the concerned exporter during the preceding calendar year subject to\ncertain conditions.  Further, Status Holder exporters are permitted, on their own, to write off\noutstanding export proceeds up to an annual limit of 5 per cent of their average annual realisation\nduring the preceding three years.  To provide full flexibility to all exporters, it has been decided\nthat:\n\u00b7 Beginning January 1, 2004, all exporters may write off outstanding export dues on their\nown and may also extend the normal period of realisation beyond 180 days on their own\nprovided the aggregate value of such write-off and delay in realisation does not exceed 10\nper cent of their export proceeds in a calendar year.\n67. It may be noted that all other existing procedures in regard to GR forms, export credit and\nexport incentives will remain unchanged.  Any exporter who expects to exceed the 10 per cent\nlimit for the calendar year as a whole should obtain authorisation as per existing practice to the\nextent of excess over 10 per cent before the end of calendar year.  Where multiple banking\nfacilities are utilised by exporters, the computation for the limit of 10 per cent would apply in\nrespect of each AD.  If any exporter exceeds the limit of 10 per cent by the end of the year,\nwithout prior authorisation, this facility will be denied after giving due notice.\n(c) Issue of Units of Mutual Funds \u2013 General Permission\n68. At present, Indian Asset Management Companies ( AMCs) who launch off-shore funds\nabroad have to obtain SEBI\u2019s approval for such schemes.  They are also required to obtain\nRBI\u2019s prior approval for issue of units, remittance of dividend and redemption of units.  In order\nto provide single window clearance, in consultation with SEBI, it is proposed:\n\u2022 To accord general permission to AMCs to issue units, remit dividend and redeem the\nunits issued, once SEBI\u2019s approval is obtained for launching off-shore funds, subject to\nreporting requirements.18\nGovernment Securities Market\n69. The Reserve Bank has taken a number of measures in close consultation with market\nparticipants to further develop and deepen the government securities market. These include\npermission to gilt account holders to participate in repo market, issuance of guidelines for\nuniform accounting norms for repo and reverse repo transactions, facility for trading in the\nanonymous screen-based order driven system of stock exchanges and introduction of exchange-\ntraded interest rate derivatives on the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ). With regard to\noperationalisation of STRIPS, RBI is in the process of drawing up the detailed specifications\nrequired for the development of software for stripping/reconstitution.  In order to further develop\nthe repo market and facilitate introduction of DVP III as preferred mode of settlement, the issue\nrelating to roll-over of repos was discussed in the TAC recently. In this direction, the following\nfurther measure is proposed:\nSale of Government Securities \u2013 Relaxation\n70. At present,  no sale transaction in a government security is permitted without the seller\nactually holding the security in its portfolio.  The Reserve Bank has received frequent\nrepresentations proposing that the extant stipulations may be relaxed which will help further\ndevelopment of the government securities market.  Institutional development has also reduced\nsettlement risk as most of the government securities transactions are now settled through\nClearing Corporation of India Limited ( CCIL) which guarantees the settlement. In order to\nfacilitate deepening of the government securities market, it is proposed that:\n\u2022 Sale of a government security, already contracted for purchase, would be permitted,\nprovided, such purchase contract was either guaranteed by an approved central\ncounterparty like CCIL or the counterparty thereof was RBI.\nTo facilitate operationalisation of the proposal, the settlement of government securities\ntransactions would be switched over to the DVP III mode. It is proposed to review the working\nof above arrangements every month to consider modifications and continuance, as appropriate.\nSupervision and Monitoring\n71. Considerable progress has been made since April 2003 in enhancing the supervision and\nmonitoring system of banks.  First, pilot implementation of risk based supervision ( RBS) process\nhas been initiated in select banks.  Further enhancement and refinement to the RBS approach\nwould be considered, in consultation with banks after taking into account the results of the pilot\nexercise.  Second, consequent to the switchover to consolidated accounting and supervision,\nconsolidated prudential reports ( CPRs) have been introduced on a half-yearly basis and the input\nmodule for off-site monitoring and surveillance system ( OSMOS) has suitably been modified to\nincorporate CPRs.  Third, a computerised fraud reporting and monitoring system ( FRMS) has\nbeen introduced.  Fourth, in order to comply with the review mandated by SEBI in respect of all\nlisted companies including commercial banks , public sector banks have been advised to prepare\nquarterly reviews of accounts. Fifth, an informal RBI- SEBI Joint Group suggested methods for\nintegrated system of alerts which would piece together disparate signals from different segments\nof the market to draw special attention to any unusual activity.  The recommendations of the\nGroup are under examination.19\nPrudential Measures\n72. As part of the ongoing process of reforms, RBI has taken a number of proactive and\nforward looking steps to strengthen the prudential framework and oversight functions. Preparing\nbanks to adopt the New Basel Capital Accord is a major challenge in a series of such important\nsteps. In this regard, seven banks participated in the Quantitative Impact Study ( QIS 3)\nconducted by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( BCBS) to assess the impact of the New\nCapital Accord.  Taking into account the results of QIS 3, BCBS has released the third\nConsultative Paper (CP3) in April 2003.  The Reserve Bank while forwarding its comments on\nCP3, has sought greater flexibility to national supervisors to implement the New Accord,\nkeeping in view the different levels of preparedness of the banking system across the countries to\nadopt the New Accord.  Further measures proposed in this area are as under:\n(a) Investment Fluctuation Reserve\n73. As indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2002, with a view to building up\nadequate reserves to guard against possible reversal of the interest rate environment in future due\nto unexpected developments, banks were advised to build up an investment fluctuation reserve\n(IFR) of a minimum 5.0 per cent of their investments in the categories \u201cHeld for Trading\u201d ( HFT)\nand \u201cAvailable for Sale\u201d ( AFS) within a period 5 years.  As the risk perceptions of individual\nbanks could differ in accordance with their portfolio composition, banks were also encouraged to\nbuild IFR up to a maximum of 10 per cent of their relevant portfolio, with the approval of their\nBoards.  As at end-June 2003, total IFR amounted to only about Rs.10 ,000 crore and constituted\n1.7 per cent of investments under relevant categories and 1.4 per cent of the total investments.\nWhile 12 banks are yet to make any provisions for IFR, 20 banks have built IFR up to 1.0 per\ncent and only 65 banks have IFR exceeding 1.0 per cent. Although, banks have time to achieve\nthe stipulated 5.0 per cent, they are urged to quickly build up IFR so that they are better\npositioned to meet interest rate risks.\n(b) Prudential Norms for FIs\n74. As indicated in the annual policy Statement  of April 2001, with effect from the year\nended March 2002, assets of financial institutions ( FIs) are treated as non-performing, if the\ninterest and/or principal instalment remain overdue for a period of more than 180 days.\nHowever, in the case of banks, 90 days norm for recognition of loan impairment would be\nadopted from the year ending March 2004. In order to bring in convergence between the asset\nclassification norms of FIs and banks, in line with international norms, it is proposed:\n\u2022 To adopt the 90 days norm for recognition of loan impairment for FIs with effect from\nthe year ending March 31, 2006.  However, in order to mitigate the burden of additional\nprovisioning arising out of adoption of the revised norm, FIs are permitted to phase out\nthe required provisioning over a period of three years beginning from the year ending\nMarch 31, 2006, with a minimum of one-fourth of the additional provisioning being\nmade each year.\n(c) Standing Technical Advisory Committee on  Financial Regulation\n75. In recent y ears, a number of steps have been taken to strengthen the regulation of banks\nand non-bank financial entities, in consultation with banks and other market20\nparticipants/regulators of financial markets. The financial sector now faces increasing challenges\nand complexities in the context of globalisation and risk management.  In order to strengthen the\nconsultative process and to place such a process on a continuing basis, it is proposed to constitute\na Standing Technical Advisory Committee on Financial Regulation on similar lines as the RBI\nTechnical Advisory Committee on Money and Government Securities Markets ( TAC). The\nCommittee would consist of experts drawn from academia, financial markets, banks, non-bank\nfinancial institutions and credit rating agencies. The Committee would examine the issues\nreferred to it and advise RBI on regulations on an on-going basis covering banks and non-bank\nfinancial institutions and other market participants, in addition to the existing channels of\nconsultations.\n(d) Monitoring of Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries ( SIFIs)\n76. In consultation with the Chairman, SEBI and Chairman, IRDA, it has been decided to\nestablish a special monitoring system for Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries\n(SIFIs). With increasing integration of financial markets, restructuring and consolidation in the\nfinancial sector, inter-linkages with subsidiaries and growing overlap of banking and non-\nbanking activities of financial institutions, issues of systemic stability have acquired new\ndimensions that require a proactive stance so that the gains on financial stability are further\nstrengthened. Hence, it has become necessary to set up a monitoring system in respect of SIFIs\nthat would encompass: ( i) a reporting system for SIFIs  on financial matters of common interest\nto RBI, SEBI  and IRDA ; (ii) the reporting of intra-group transactions of SIFIs ; and (iii) the\nexchange of relevant information among RBI, SEBI  and IRDA . It has been agreed that, after co-\nopting a member from IRDA, the present RBI- SEBI Technical Committee, would propose a list\nof SIFIs and advise on a reporting system in a time-bound manner over the next three months.\n(e) Standing Committee on Procedures and Performance Audit on Public Services\n77. The Reserve Ba nk renders services to the public in areas such as distribution and\nexchange of currency and coins; issuance, redemption and servicing of government securities\nand relief bonds; payments/receipts related to government transactions, etc.  It has been the\ncontinuous endeavour of RBI to improve the quality of its public services to the common persons\nand reduce transaction costs as well as time both for RBI and the citizens/organisations\nconcerned. With the setting up of a Regulations Review Authority ( RRA) and Grievances\nRedressal Cells at Regional Offices of RBI, there has been considerable improvement in this\nregard.  In order to benchmark the current level of service, review the progress periodically,\nenhance the timeliness and quality, rationalise the processes taking account of technological\ndevelopments, and suggest appropriate incentives to facilitate change on an ongoing basis, it is\nnow proposed to set up a Standing Committee. The Standing Committee will have two functions:\n(i) to undertake procedure and performance audit on public services and regulatory clearances in\nRBI as described above, and (ii) advise and co-ordinate with the Ad hoc Committees on\nCustomer Services proposed below to be set up by banks for rationalisation of instructions on\nprocedures prescribed by RBI that impinge on the customer services of banks. The Standing\nCommittee will submit an annual report to RBI on its work to be placed before the Board of RBI.\n(f) Ad hoc Committees on Procedures and Performance Audit on Customer Services in Banks\n78. In order to support broad-based improvement in customer services in relation to various\nbanking services, each commercial bank is advised to constitute an Ad hoc Committee to\nundertake procedures and performance audit on public services rendered by the bank. The\nCommittees would look into simplification of procedures and practices with a view to\nsafeguarding the interests of common persons, be they current or savings account holders,21\ndepositors or borrowers, from any unfair procedural practices by banks, e.g., delayed credit of\ninterest, handling of deceased accounts, release of mortgage documents, reversal of erroneous\nentries in credit cards, updation  of passbooks, transparency of charges levied on customers,\nunilateral debits in the customer accounts, foreign exchange transactions, etc. The Committees\nwould also review service to the customers in respect of: ( i) meeting their demands for\nfresh/good notes and coins of all denominations, (ii) exchanging soiled notes, (iii) adjudicating\nmutilated notes, and (iv) accepting coins and notes either for transactions or in exchange.\nFurther, the Committees would look into regulations and procedures prescribed by RBI that\nimpinge on customer service of banks and make suitable recommendations for\nelimination/rationalisation and interact with the RBI Standing Committee on Procedures and\nPerformance Audit on Public Services keeping in view the need to drastically reduce the cost and\nimprove the ease of conducting transactions both for banks and customers.  Each Ad hoc\nCommittee is expected to complete its work in six months from the date of constitution.\n(g) Working Group on Development Finance Institutions\n79. Pursuant to the recommendation of the Narasimham  Committee II, and the RBI\nDiscussion Paper on \u201cHarmonising the Role and Operations of Development Financial\nInstitutions and Banks\u201d released in January 1999 for wider public debate, the regulatory\napproach to Development Finance Institutions ( DFIs ) was spelt out in the annual policy\nStatement of April 2000. The approach so finalised, suggested that any DFI intending to\ntransform into a bank, could approach RBI or convert itself into an NBFC. Since then, ICICI has\ncompleted the process of transition to a bank and IDBI is in the process of doing so. In order to\naddress the regulatory and supervisory issues relating to remaining term lending institutions and\nrefinancing institutions and for improving the flow of resources to them, it is proposed to set up a\nWorking Group on Development Finance Institutions. The Group would examine, within the\nbroader framework of regulation of NBFCs, various regulatory and supervisory aspects,\nincluding access to short-term resources for the DFIs as a separate category, and submit its report\nin four months.\n(h) Corporate Governance\n80. As indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002, the Consultative Group of\nDirectors of Banks and FIs (Chairman: Dr. A.S. Ganguly) had made several recommendations\ncovering constitution and functioning of Boards, access to information to Board members, audit\ncommittees, internal control and financial reporting. Similar recommendations have also been\nmade by the SEBI  Committee for banks listed in stock exchanges. It is proposed, through a\nconsultative process, to: ( i) harmonise the approaches suggested by the Ganguly Committee and\nthe SEBI Committee in regard to banks, and (ii) extend the above principles of good corporate\ngovernance practices to PDs, NBFCs and other financial institutions, as appropriate.\nUrban Co-operative Banks\n81. As indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2003, following the\nrecommendations of the Committee set up by the Government (Chairman: Hon. Shri Anant\nGeete ), relaxation for classification of NPAs  was given to urban co-operative banks ( UCBs ) in\nrespect of gold loans and small loans, placement of investments with other scheduled UCBs  and\nlimits on unsecured advances. Further, in pursuance to the Joint Parliamentary Committee ( JPC)22\nrecommendations, guidelines were issued for timely compliance with inspection reports,\nmandatory concurrent audit and sanction of loans and advances by UCBs to their Directors.\nTechnology Upgradation\n82. The Reserve Bank has been playing a pivotal role in the upgradation of technology in the\nbanking sector with the objective of putting in place a safe, secure, robust, efficient and\nintegrated payment and settlement system that will function on-line in a real-time environment.\nThe National Payment Council ( NPC) with representation from the industry is an important part\nof this process. The Reserve Bank has also been making sustained efforts to implement an\nintegrated and efficient payment system through: ( i) integration of financial entities through the\nINFINET ; (ii) encouraging retail electronic mode of payment including implementation of\nelectronic funds transfer ( EFT) system; (iii) establishing the negotiated dealing system ( NDS )\nand (iv) introduction of real time gross settlement ( RTGS ) system. In addition, the funds transfer\nmodule of centralised fund management system ( CFMS) would be implemented by December\n2003.  The national settlement system ( NSS) is expected to be operational by June 2004 which\nwould integrate the segmented clearing and settlement infrastructure in the country and enable\nmore effective funds management by banks.  Further measures in this direction are given below:\n(a)  Implementation of RTGS\n83. As indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2003, RBI has commenced\nimplementation of a RTGS system in a phased manner.  As a first stage, a demonstrable version\nof the RTGS system was implemented in June 2003, and hands-on practice was given to the\nofficials of 104 banks.  In the next stage, after acceptance testing and trial run, the standalone\nRTGS system is scheduled to be operationalised by January 2004. In  the final stage,  a fully\nfunctional RTGS system is expected to be made operational by June 2004. This system would be\nfully integrated with the integrated accounting system of RBI. Banks and PDs are required to\nensure complete readiness in terms of infrastructure, systems and procedures, and adequate\ntrained manpower to effectively participate in the RTGS system.  As RTGS services are to be\noffered by banks through their branch network, it is essential that banks should put in place\nnecessary connectivity between their branches and the payment system gateway through which\nbanks will interact with the RTGS system.\n(b) Intra-day Liquidity under RTGS\n84. With the commencement of RTGS, the likely increase in requirement of intra-day funds\nwould necessitate provision of intra-day liquidity ( IDL) to participants for a smooth and timely\nsettlement process. The Reserve Bank would be providing collateralised intra-day liquidity\nsupport to the participants. In this context, RBI had a number of consultations with market\nparticipants in respect of criteria for fixation of limits for IDL, eligible collateral and other\nrelated issues. In order to facilitate smooth transition to RTGS environment, market participants\nare advised to devise strategies for efficient cash flow management.\nCentral Database Management System\n85. The Reserve Bank has established a central database management system ( CDBMS), an\nenterprise wide data warehouse, built around an integrated repository of current and historical23\ndata which serves as a state-of-the-art decision support system within RBI. The system is web-\nbased and has been available for access and analysis to users in RBI since December 2002.  It is\nproposed to place the relevant data in CDBMS in public domain for the convenience of\nresearchers and other users.  Accordingly, an Expert Group is being constituted to guide this\nprocess, particularly through an assessment of user requirements. It is expected that these data\nwould become available on-line by end-June 2004.\nConduct of Government Business\n(a) Enhancement in Agency Arrangement\n86. Hitherto, public sector banks were authorised to undertake government business as agents\nof RBI.  In order to provide a wider network for public convenience and timely conduct of\ngovernment business, four private sector banks, viz. HDFC  Bank, UTI Bank, ICICI  Bank and\nIDBI  Bank were authorised to handle government transactions such as revenue collection,\npension payments and expenditure related functions of all Central Government\nMinistries/Departments with effect from October 1, 2003.  It is proposed to carefully review the\nefficiency and dependability of services being rendered by all the banks concerned, and also\nreset the commission payable capturing the economies of scale afforded by new technologies as\nwell as greater competition.\n(b) On-line Tax Administration System\n87. At the request of the Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT), RBI has constituted a High\nPowered Committee for operationalising an On-line Tax Administration System ( OLTAS).\nUnder the OLTAS, tax collection by banks would be credited on-line to government account by\nthe next day.  Corresponding tax information would also flow on-line to the Income Tax data\nbase.  Successful pilot studies have already been conducted in eight major centres in respect of\ncorporate tax assessees.  The scope of the pilot studies will be widened progressively to cover\nindividual assessees and more centres.\n88. A decision has also been taken to pay tax refunds through the electronic clearing services\n(ECS) to assessees in select cities where banks presently offer this facility.  To begin with, as a\npilot project, tax refunds up to Rs.25 ,000 are proposed to be made through the ECS to the\nbeneficiaries in these select cities.\nDevelopments in Currency Management\n89. As indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2003, the Clean Note Policy adopted\nby RBI was further facilitated by special measures and mechanisation of note processing activity\nin all the Issue Offices of RBI.  In order to support the system for handling notes in a de-stapled\ncondition, banks were advised to provide necessary infrastructure like note banding machines\nand note counting/sorting machines.  While most of the currency chests have de-stapled the stock\nof stapled notes, a number of banks have given wide publicity regarding non-stapling of note\npackets.  In order to expand distribution channels for fresh notes and coins and withdraw soiled\nnotes from circulation, banks were also advised to increase the number of currency chests and\nsmall coin depots, accept soiled notes and coins in exchange, offer facilities for adjudication of\nmutilated notes and stock their ATMs  adequately.  In addition, RBI has also adopted an24\ninnovative procedure of using Post Offices for distribution of coins. The Reserve Bank accords a\nvery high value to the convenience of common persons and while the phenomenal progress made\nin the recent period by banks is appreciated, further progress in this regard is urged, as a\ncollaborative effort between RBI and banks.\nDeposit Insurance\n90. It was indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002 that a joint team of officials\nfrom the Government, RBI and Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation ( DICGC )\nstudied the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) model and other regulatory and\nsupervisory agencies in the US in order to evolve a suitable system for India for converting\nDICGC  into the Bank Deposit Insurance Corporation ( BDIC ) as announced in the Union Budget\n2002-03. Based on the team\u2019s report, a draft outline of the BDIC Bill 2003 to replace the DICGC\nAct 1961 was submitted for consideration of the Government.\nAnnexes\n91. The movement of cross-border capital flows, especially in the areas of outward foreign\ndirect investment, inward direct and portfolio investment, non-resident deposits and external\ncommercial borrowing were liberalised further. A list of measures relating to current and capital\naccounts announced subsequent to the presentation of annual policy Statement of April 2003 is\ngiven in Annex I .\n92. In recent years, the Reserve Bank has been undertaking extensive consultations with\nbanks, market participants and experts before deciding on major policy issues relating to the\nfinancial sector.  In addition, several Working Groups were set up to consider proposed new\nmeasures that were likely to have significant impact on the financial sector and to examine\nvarious policy issues.  Where necessary, the reports of the Working Groups were also put on the\nRBI website for wider dissemination and for inviting comments.  The details of the progress\nmade in respect of certain Working Groups constituted recently are given in Annex II.\n93. The sweeping changes in the financial sector and the innovations in information\ntechnology have underpinned the need for corresponding changes in the legal structure.  The\nReserve Bank in co-ordination with the Government has taken necessary initiatives in this\ndirection and the progress made so far is given in Annex III.\nMumbai\nNovember 3, 2003\nAnnexes\nI.

PRE-SHIPMENT EXPORT CREDIT\n1.1 Rupee Pre-shipment Credit/Packing Credit\n1.1.1 Definition\n'Pre-shipment/Packing Credit'  means any loan or advance granted\nor any other credit provided by a bank to an exporter for financing the\npurchase, processing, manufacturing  or packing of goods  prior to\nshipment, on the basis of letter of credit opened in his favour or in\nfavour of some other person, by an overseas buyer or a confirmed and\nirrevocable order for the export of goods from India or any other\nevidence of an order for export from India having been placed on the\nexporter or some other person, unless lodgement  of export orders or\nletter of credit with the bank has been waived .\n1.1.2 Period of Advance\n(i) The period for which a packing credit advance may be given by\na bank will depend upon the circumstances of the individual\ncase, such as the time required for procuring, manufacturing or\nprocessing (where necessary) and shipping the relative goods. It\nis primarily for the banks to decide the period for which a\npacking credit advance may be given having regard to the\nvarious relevant factors so that the period is sufficient to\nenable the exporter to ship the goods .\n(ii) If pre-shipment advances are not adjusted by submission of\nexport documents within 360 days from the date of advance, the\nadvances will cease to qualify for concessive rate of interest to\nthe exporter ab initio .\n(iii) RBI would provide refinance only for a period not exceeding\n180 days.\n1.1.3 Disbursement of Packing Credit\n(i) Ordinarily, each packing credit sanctioned should be maintained\nas separate account for the purpose of monitoring period of\nsanction and end-use of funds.\n(ii) Banks may release the packing credit in one lumpsum or in\nstages as per the requirement for executing the orders/LC.\n(iii) Banks may also maintain different accounts at various stages of\nprocessing, manufacturing, etc. depending on the types of goods\nto be exported, e.g. hypothecation, pledge, etc., accounts and\nmay ensure that the outstanding balance in accounts are adjusted\nby transfer from one account to the other and finally by proceeds\nof relative export documents on purchase, discount, etc.(iv) Banks should continue to keep a close watch on the end-use of\nthe funds and ensure that credit at lower rates of interest is used\nfor genuine requirements of exports. Banks should also monitor\nthe progress made by the exporters in timely fulfilment of\nexport orders.\n1.1.4 Liquidation of Packing Credit\n(i) General\nThe packing credit /pre-shipment credit granted to an exporter\nmay be liquidated out of proceeds of bills drawn for the\nexported commodities on its purchase, discount etc. thereby\nconverting pre-shipment credit into post-shipment credit.\nFurther, subject to mutual agreement between the exporter and\nthe banker it can also be repaid/prepaid out of balances in\nExchange Earners Foreign Currency A/c ( EEFC A/c ) as also\nfrom rupee resources of the exporter to the extent exports have\nactually taken place. If not so liquidated /repaid, banks should\ncharge the rate of interest for ECNOS- pre-shipment as\nindicated in paragraph 5.2.1(4) from the date of advance.\n(ii) Packing credit in excess of export value\n(a) Where by-product can be exported\nWhere the exporter is unable to tender export bills of\nequivalent value for liquidating the packing credit due to\nthe shortfall on account of wastage involved in the\nprocessing of agro products like raw cashew nuts, etc.,\nbanks may allow exporters, inter alia, to extinguish the\nexcess packing credit by export bills drawn in respect of\nby-product like cashew shell oil, etc.\n(b) Where partial domestic sale is involved\nHowever, in respect of export of agro-based products like\ntobacco, pepper, cardamom, cashew nuts, etc., the exporter\nhas necessarily to purchase a somewhat larger quantity of\nthe raw agricultural produce and grade it into exportable\nand non-exportable varieties and only the former is\nexported. The non-exportable balance is necessarily sold\ndomestically. For the packing credit covering such non-\nexportable portion, banks are required to charge\ncommercial rate of interest applicable to the domestic\nadvance from the date of advance of packing credit and\nthat portion of the packing credit would not be eligible for\nany refinance from RBI.\n(c) Export of deoiled/defatted cakes\nBanks are permitted to grant packing credit advance to\nexporters of HPS ground nut and deoiled/defatted cakes to\nthe extent of the value of raw materials required even though\nthe value thereof exceeds the value of the export order. The\nadvance in excess of the export order is required to beadjusted either in cash or by sale of residual by-product oil\nwithin a period not exceeding 30 days from the date of\nadvance to be eligible for concessional rate of interest.\n(iii) Banks have, however, operational flexibility  to extend the\nfollowing relaxations to their exporter clients who have a good\ntrack  record :\n(a) Repayment/liquidation of packing credit with proceeds of\nexport documents will continue; however, this could be\nwith export documents relating to any other order\ncovering the same or any other commodity exported by\nthe exporter . While allowing substitution of contract in\nthis way, banks should ensure that it is commercially\nnecessary and unavoidable. Banks should also satisfy\nabout the valid reasons as to why packing credit extended\nfor shipment of a particular commodity cannot be\nliquidated in the normal method. As far as possible, the\nsubstitution of contract should be allowed if the exporter\nmaintains account with the same bank or it has the\napproval of the members of the consortium, if any.\n(b) The existing packing credit may also be marked-off with\nproceeds of export documents against which no packing\ncredit has been drawn by the exporter. However, it is\npossible that the exporter might avail of EPC with one\nbank and submit the documents to another bank. In view of\nthis possibility, banks may extend such facility after\nensuring that the exporter has not availed of packing credit\nfrom another bank against the documents submitted.\n(c) These relaxations should not be extended  to transactions\nof sister/associate/group concerns.\n1.1.5 'Running Account' Facility\n(i) As stated above, pre-shipment credit to exporters is normally\nprovided on lodgement of L/Cs or firm export orders. It is\nobserved that the availability of raw materials is seasonal in\nsome cases. In some other cases, the time taken for manufacture\nand shipment of goods is more than the delivery schedule as per\nexport contracts. In many cases, the exporters have to procure\nraw material, manufacture the export product and keep the same\nready for shipment, in anticipation of receipt of letters of\ncredit/firm export orders from the overseas buyers. Having\nregard to difficulties being faced by the exporters in availing of\nadequate pre-shipment credit in such cases, banks have been\nauthorised to extend Pre-shipment Credit \u2018Running Account\u2019\nfacility in respect of any commodity , without insisting on prior\nlodgement of letters of credit/firm export orders, depending on\nthe bank\u2019s judgement regarding the need to extend such a\nfacility and subject to the following conditions:(a) Banks may extend the \u2018Running Account\u2019 facility only to those\nexporters whose track record  has been good  as also Export Oriented\nUnits ( EOUs)/Units in Free Trade Zones/ Export Processing Zones ( EPZs)\nand Special Economic Zones ( SEZs).\n(b) In all cases where Pre-shipment Credit \u2018Running Account\u2019 facility has\nbeen extended, letters of credit/firm orders should be produced within a\nreasonable period of time to be decided by the banks.\n(c) Banks should mark off individual export bills, as and when they are\nreceived for negotiation/collection, against the earliest outstanding pre-\nshipment credit on 'First In First Out' (FIFO) basis. Needless to add that,\nwhile marking off the pre-shipment credit in the manner indicated above,\nbanks should ensure that concessive credit available in respect of\nindividual pre-shipment credit does not go beyond the period of sanction\nor 360 days from the date of advance, whichever is earlier.\n(d) Packing credit can also be marked-off with proceeds of export\ndocuments against which no packing credit has been drawn by the\nexporter.\n(ii) If it is noticed that the exporter is found to be abusing the facility, the facility\nshould be withdrawn forthwith.\n(iii) In cases where exporters have not complied with the terms and conditions,\nthe advance will attract commercial lending rate ab initio . In such cases, banks\nwill be required to pay higher rate of interest on the portion of refinance availed\nof by them from the RBI in respect of the relative pre-shipment credit. All such\ncases should be reported to the Monetary Policy Department, Reserve Bank of\nIndia, Central Office, Mumbai 400 001 which will decide the rate of interest to\nbe charged on the refinance amount.\n(iv) Running account facility should not be granted to sub-suppliers .\n1.1.6 Interest on Packing Credit\nInterest rate structure and instructions in regard thereto are detailed in paragraph\n5.\n1.1.7 Export Credit against Proceeds of Cheques, Drafts, etc. Representing Advance\nPayment for Exports\n(i) Where exporters receive direct remittances from abroad by means of cheques,\ndrafts, etc. in payment for exports, banks may grant export credit at concessive\ninterest rate to exporters of good track record till the realisation of proceeds of\nthe cheque, draft etc. received from abroad, after satisfying themselves that it is\nagainst an export order, is as per trade practices in respect of the goods in\nquestion and is an approved method of realisation of export proceeds as per\nextant rules.(ii) If, pending compliance with the above conditions, an exporter has been\ngranted accommodation at normal commercial interest rate, banks may give\neffect to concessive export credit rate retrospectively once the aforesaid\nconditions have been complied with and refund the difference to the exporter.\n1.2 Rupee Pre-shipment Credit to Specific Sectors/Segments\n1.2.1 Rupee Export Packing Credit to Manufacturer Suppliers for Exports Routed\nthrough STC/MMTC/Other Export Houses, Agencies, etc.\n(i) Banks may grant export packing credit to manufacturer suppliers who do not\nhave export orders/letters of credit in their own name, and goods are exported\nthrough the State Trading Corporation/Minerals and Metal Trading Corporation\nor other export houses, agencies, etc.\n(ii) Such advances will be eligible for refinance, provided the following\nrequirements are complied with apart from the usual stipulations:\n(a) Banks should obtain from the export house a letter setting out the\ndetails of the export order and the portion thereof to be executed by the\nsupplier and also certifying that the export house has not obtained and will\nnot ask for packing credit in respect of such portion of the order as is to be\nexecuted by the supplier.\n(b) Banks should, after mutual consultations and taking into account the\nexport requirements of the two parties, apportion between the two i.e. the\nExport House and the Supplier, the period of packing credit for which the\nconcessionary rate of interest is to be charged. The concessionary rates of\ninterest on the pre-shipment credit will be available upto the stipulated\nperiods in respect of the export house/agency and the supplier put\ntogether.\n(c) The export house should open inland L/Cs in favour of the supplier\ngiving relevant particulars of the export L/Cs or orders and the\noutstandings in the packing credit account should be extinguished by\nnegotiation of bills under such inland L/Cs. If it is inconvenient for the\nexport house to open such inland L/Cs in favour of the supplier, the latter\nshould draw bills on the export house in respect of the goods supplied for\nexport and adjust packing credit advances from the proceeds of such bills.\nIn case the bills drawn under such arrangement are not accompanied by\nbills of lading or other export documents, the bank should obtain through\nthe supplier a certificate from the export house at the end of every quarter\nthat the goods supplied under this arrangement have in fact been exported.\nThe certificate should give particulars of the relative bills such as date,\namount and the name of the bank through which the bills have been\nnegotiated.(d) Banks should obtain an undertaking from the supplier that\nthe advance payment, if any, received from the export\nhouse against the export order would be credited to the\npacking credit account.\n1.2.2 Rupee Export Packing Credit to Sub-Suppliers\n(i) Packing credit can be shared between an Export Order Holder\n(EOH) and sub-supplier of raw materials, components, etc. of\nthe exported goods as in the case of EOH and manufacturer\nsuppliers, subject to the following:\n(a) Running Account facility is not contemplated under the\nscheme. The scheme will cover the L/C or export order\nreceived in favour of Export Houses/Trading Houses/Star\nTrading Houses, etc. or manufacturer exporters only. The\nscheme should be made available to the exporters with\ngood track record.\n(b) Bankers to an EOH will open an inland L/C specifying the\ngoods to be supplied by the sub-supplier to the EOH\nagainst the export order or L/C received by him as a part of\nthe export transaction. On the basis of such a L/C, the sub-\nsupplier's banker will grant EPC as working capital to\nenable the sub-supplier to manufacture the components\nrequired for the goods to be exported. On supplying the\ngoods, the L/C opening bank will pay to the sub-supplier's\nbanker against the inland documents received on the basis\nof inland L/C. Such payments will thereafter become the\nEPC of the EOH.\n(c) It is upto the EOH to open any number of L/Cs for the\nvarious components required with the approval of his\nbanker/leader of consortium of banks within the overall\nvalue limit of the order or L/C received by him. Taking\ninto account the operational convenience, it is for the L/C\nopening bank to fix the minimum amount for opening such\nL/Cs. The total period of packing credit availed by the sub-\nsupplier(s), individually or severally and the EOH should\nbe within normal cycle of production required for the\nexported goods. Normally, the total period will be\ncomputed from the date of first drawal of packing credit by\nany one of the sub-suppliers to the date of submission of\nexport documents by EOH.\n(d) The EOH will be responsible for exporting the goods as\nper export order or overseas L/C and any delay in the\nprocess will subject him to the penal provisions issued\nfrom time to time. Once the sub-supplier makes available\nthe goods as per inland L/C terms to the EOH, his\nobligation of performance under the scheme will be treated\nas complied with and the penal provisions will not be\napplicable to him for delay by EOH, if any.(e) The scheme is an additional window besides the existing\nsystem of sharing of packing credit between EOH and\nmanufacturer in respect of exported goods as detailed in\nparagraph 1.2.1 above. The scheme will cover only the\nfirst stage of production cycle . For example , a\nmanufacturer exporter will be allowed to open domestic\nL/C in favour of his immediate suppliers of components\netc. that are required for manufacture of exportable goods.\nThe scheme will not be extended to cover suppliers of raw\nmaterials/components, etc. to such immediate suppliers. In\ncase the EOH is merely a trading house, the facility will be\navailable commencing from the manufacturer to whom the\norder has been passed on by the Trading House.\n(f) EOUs/EPZ/SEZ units supplying goods to another\nEOU/EPZ/SEZ unit for export purposes are also eligible\nfor rupee pre-shipment export credit under this scheme.\nHowever, the supplier EOU/EPZ/SEZ unit will not be\neligible for any post-shipment facility as the scheme does\nnot cover sale of goods on credit terms.\n(g) The scheme does not envisage any change in the total\nquantum of advance or period. Accordingly, the credit\nextended under the system will be treated as export credit\nfrom the date of advance to the sub-supplier to the date of\nliquidation by EOH under the inland export L/C system\nand upto the date of liquidation of packing credit by\nshipment of goods by EOH and will be eligible for\nrefinance from RBI by the respective banks for the\nappropriate periods. It has to be ensured that no double\nfinancing of the same leg of the transaction is involved.\n(h) Banks may approach the ECGC for availing suitable cover\nin respect of such advances.\n(i) The scheme does not envisage extending credit by a sub-\nsupplier to the EOH/manufacturer and thus, the payment to\nsub-suppliers has to be made against submission of\ndocuments by L/C opening bank treating the payment as\nEPC of the EOH.\n1.2.3 Rupee Pre-shipment Credit to Construction Contractors\n(i) The packing credit advances to the construction contractors to\nmeet their initial working capital requirements for execution of\ncontracts abroad may be made on the basis of a firm contract\nsecured from abroad, in a separate account, on an undertaking\nobtained from them that the finance is required by them for\nincurring preliminary expenses in connection with the execution\nof the contract e.g., for transporting the necessary technical staff\nand purchase of consumable articles for the purpose of\nexecuting the contract abroad, etc..(ii) The advances should be adjusted within 180 days of the date of\nadvance by negotiation of bills relating to the contract or by\nremittances received from abroad in respect of the contract\nexecuted abroad. To the extent the outstandings in the account\nare not adjusted in the stipulated manner, banks may charge\nnormal rate of interest on such advance.\n(iii) The exporters undertaking project export contracts including\nexport of services may comply with the guidelines/instructions\nissued by Reserve Bank of India, Exchange Control\nDepartment, Central Office, Mumbai from time to time.\n1.2.4 Export of Consultancy Services\n(i) Some of the Indian consultancy firms have taken up export of\nconsultancy services in connection with the setting up of\nindustrial and other projects in foreign countries. Where such\nconsultancy services form part of turnkey projects or joint\nventures set up abroad, banks are considering suitable credit\nfacilities at the pre-shipment and post-shipment stages. The\nexporters may need financial assistance from banks even in\ncases where consultancy services alone are exported,\nparticularly, if no advance payments are received.\n(ii) Banks may consider granting suitable pre-shipment credit\nfacilities against consultancy agreements to consultancy firms\nfor meeting the expenses of the technical and other staff\nemployed for the project and purchase of any materials required\nfor the purpose as well as for export of computer software, both\nstandard and custom built software programs, subject to the\nusual conditions of packing credit scheme.\n(iii) While deciding the pre-shipment facilities, advance payments\nreceived against the contract must be taken into account.\n(iv) Banks may consider issuing suitable guarantees to exporters of\nconsultancy services of high value with large advance payment,\ntaking into account the competence of the firm to undertake the\nassignment in question and other related aspects.\n1.2.5 Export of IT Service and software\nPre-shipment or post-shipment finance can be provided to exporters\nof IT and software services in case of specific orders from abroad.\" IT\nservice\" is defined as any service which results from the use of any IT\nsoftware over a system of IT products for realising value addition.\nVarious segments of Information Technology and Software Industry\ncould be broadly classified into four categories.(ii) The advances should be adjusted within 180 days of the date of\nadvance by negotiation of bills relating to the contract or by\nremittances received from abroad in respect of the contract\nexecuted abroad. To the extent the outstandings in the account\nare not adjusted in the stipulated manner, banks may charge\nnormal rate of interest on such advance.\n(iii) The exporters undertaking project export contracts including\nexport of services may comply with the guidelines/instructions\nissued by Reserve Bank of India, Exchange Control\nDepartment, Central Office, Mumbai from time to time.\n1.2.4 Export of Consultancy Services\n(i) Some of the Indian consultancy firms have taken up export of\nconsultancy services in connection with the setting up of\nindustrial and other projects in foreign countries. Where such\nconsultancy services form part of turnkey projects or joint\nventures set up abroad, banks are considering suitable credit\nfacilities at the pre-shipment and post-shipment stages. The\nexporters may need financial assistance from banks even in\ncases where consultancy services alone are exported,\nparticularly, if no advance payments are received.\n(ii) Banks may consider granting suitable pre-shipment credit\nfacilities against consultancy agreements to consultancy firms\nfor meeting the expenses of the technical and other staff\nemployed for the project and purchase of any materials required\nfor the purpose as well as for export of computer software, both\nstandard and custom built software programs, subject to the\nusual conditions of packing credit scheme.\n(iii) While deciding the pre-shipment facilities, advance payments\nreceived against the contract must be taken into account.\n(iv) Banks may consider issuing suitable guarantees to exporters of\nconsultancy services of high value with large advance payment,\ntaking into account the competence of the firm to undertake the\nassignment in question and other related aspects.\n1.2.5 Export of IT Service and software\nPre-shipment or post-shipment finance can be provided to exporters\nof IT and software services in case of specific orders from abroad.\" IT\nservice\" is defined as any service which results from the use of any IT\nsoftware over a system of IT products for realising value addition.\nVarious segments of Information Technology and Software Industry\ncould be broadly classified into four categories.growing of flowers, grapes, etc., provided banks are in a\nposition to clearly identify such activities as export-related and\nsatisfy themselves of the export potential thereof, and the\nactivities are not covered by direct/indirect finance schemes of\nNABARD or any other agency, subject to the normal terms &\nconditions relating to packing credit such as period, quantum,\nliquidation, etc.\n(iii) Export credit should not be extended for investments, such as,\nimport of foreign technology, equipment, land development, etc.\nor any other item which cannot be regarded as working capital.\n1.2.7 Export Credit to Processors/Exporters- Agri-Export Zones\n(i) Government of India have set up Agri- Export Zones  in the\ncountry to promote Agri Exports. Agri- Export Oriented Units\n(processing) are set up in Agri- Export zones as well as outside\nthe zones and to promote such units, production and processing\nare to be integrated. The producer has to enter into contract\nfarming with farmers and has to ensure supply of quality seeds,\npesticides, micro-nutrients and other material to the group of\nfarmers from whom  the exporter would be purchasing the\nproducts as raw material for production of the final products for\nexport. The Government, therefore, suggested that such export\nprocessing units may be provided packing credit under the\nextant guidelines for the purpose of procuring and supplying\ninputs to the farmers so that quality inputs are available to them\nwhich in turn will ensure that only good quality crops are raised.\nThe exporters will be able to purchase/import such inputs in\nbulk which will have the advantages of economies of scale.\n(ii) Banks may treat the inputs supplied to farmers by exporters\nas raw material for export and consider sanctioning the lines of\ncredit/export credit to processors/exporters to cover the cost of\nsuch inputs required by farmers to cultivate such crops to\npromote export of agri products. The processor units would be\nable to effect bulk purchases of the inputs and supply the same\nto the farmers as per a pre-determined arrangement.\n(iii) Banks have to  ensure  that the exporters  have made the\nrequired arrangements with the farmers and overseas buyers in\nrespect of crops to be purchased and products to be exported\nrespectively.  The financing banks will also appraise the\nprojects in agri export zones and ensure that the tie-up\narrangements are feasible and projects would take off within a\nreasonable period of time.\n(iv) They  have also to monitor the end-use of  funds, viz.\ndistribution of the inputs by the exporters to the farmers for\nraising the crops as per arrangements made by the\nexporter/main processor units.(v) They have to further ensure that the final products are exported\nby the processors/exporters as per the terms and conditions of\nthe sanction in order to liquidate the pre-shipment credit as per\nextant instructions.\n2. POST-SHIPMENT EXPORT CREDIT\n2.1 'Post-shipment Credit' means any loan or advance granted or any other credit\nprovided by a bank to an exporter of goods from India from the date of\nextending credit after shipment of goods to the date of realisation of export\nproceeds and includes any loan or advance granted to an exporter, in\nconsideration of, or on the security of any duty drawback allowed by the\nGovernment from time to time.\n2.2 Post-shipment advance can mainly take the form of -\n(i) Export bills purchased/discounted/negotiated.\n(ii) Advances against bills for collection.\n(iii) Advances against duty drawback receivcable from Government.\n2.3 Post-shipment credit is to be liquidated by the proceeds of export bills received\nfrom abroad in respect of goods exported.\n2.4 Rupee Post-shipment Export Credit\n2.4.1 Period\n(i) In the case of demand bills , the period of advance shall be the\nNormal Transit Period  (NTP)  as specified by FEDAI.\n(ii) In case of usance bills , credit can be granted for a maximum\nduration of 180 days  from date of shipment inclusive of\nNormal Transit Period (NTP) and grace period, if any.\nHowever, banks should closely monitor the need for extending\npost-shipment credit upto the permissible period of 180 days\nand they should influence the exporters to realise the export\nproceeds within a shorter period.\n(iii) 'Normal transit period'  means the average period normally\ninvolved from the date of negotiation/purchase/discount till the\nreceipt of bill proceeds in the Nostro account of the bank\nconcerned, as prescribed by FEDAI from time to time. It is not\nto be confused with the time taken for the arrival of goods at\noverseas destination.(iv) An overdue bill  -\n(a) in the case of a demand bill, is a bill which is not paid\nbefore the expiry of the normal transit period, and\n(b) in the case of a usance bill, is a bill which is not paid on\nthe due date.\n2.4.2 Interest Rate Structure\nInterest rate structure on post-shipment credit and instructions in\nregard thereto are detailed in paragraph 5.\n2.4.3 Advances against Undrawn Balances on Export Bills\nIn export of certain commodities where exporters are required to draw\nthe bills on the overseas buyer upto 90 to 98 percent of the FOB value\nof the contract, the residuary amount being ' undrawn balance' is\npayable by the overseas buyer after satisfying himself about the\nquality/ quantity of goods. Payment of undrawn balance is contingent\nin nature. Banks may consider granting advances against undrawn\nbalances at concessional rate of interest based on their commercial\njudgement and the track record of the buyer. Such advances are,\nhowever, eligible for concessional rate of interest for a maximum\nperiod of 90 days only to the extent these are repaid by actual\nremittances from abroad and provided such remittances are received\nwithin 180 days after the expiry of NTP in the case of demand bills and\ndue date in the case of usance bills. For the period beyond 90 days, the\nrate of interest specified for the category 'ECNOS' at post-shipment\nstage may be charged.\n2.4.4 Advances against Retention Money\n(i) In the case of turnkey projects/construction contracts,\nprogressive payments are made by the overseas employer in\nrespect of services segment of the contract, retaining a small\npercentage of the progressive payments as retention money\nwhich is payable after expiry of the stipulated period from the\ndate of the completion of the contract, subject to obtention of\ncertificate(s) from the specified authority.\n(ii) Retention money may also be sometimes stipulated against the\nsupplies portion in the case of turn-key projects. It may like-\nwise arise in the case of sub-contracts. The payment of retention\nmoney is contingent in nature as it is a defect liability.\n(iii) The following guidelines should be followed in regard to grant\nof advances against retention money:\n(a) No advances may be granted against retention money\nrelating to services portion  of the contract.\n(b) Exporters may be advised to arrange, as far as possible,\nprovision of suitable guarantees, instead of retention\nmoney.(iv) An overdue bill  -\n(a) in the case of a demand bill, is a bill which is not paid\nbefore the expiry of the normal transit period, and\n(b) in the case of a usance bill, is a bill which is not paid on\nthe due date.\n2.4.2 Interest Rate Structure\nInterest rate structure on post-shipment credit and instructions in\nregard thereto are detailed in paragraph 5.\n2.4.3 Advances against Undrawn Balances on Export Bills\nIn export of certain commodities where exporters are required to draw\nthe bills on the overseas buyer upto 90 to 98 percent of the FOB value\nof the contract, the residuary amount being ' undrawn balance' is\npayable by the overseas buyer after satisfying himself about the\nquality/ quantity of goods. Payment of undrawn balance is contingent\nin nature. Banks may consider granting advances against undrawn\nbalances at concessional rate of interest based on their commercial\njudgement and the track record of the buyer. Such advances are,\nhowever, eligible for concessional rate of interest for a maximum\nperiod of 90 days only to the extent these are repaid by actual\nremittances from abroad and provided such remittances are received\nwithin 180 days after the expiry of NTP in the case of demand bills and\ndue date in the case of usance bills. For the period beyond 90 days, the\nrate of interest specified for the category 'ECNOS' at post-shipment\nstage may be charged.\n2.4.4 Advances against Retention Money\n(i) In the case of turnkey projects/construction contracts,\nprogressive payments are made by the overseas employer in\nrespect of services segment of the contract, retaining a small\npercentage of the progressive payments as retention money\nwhich is payable after expiry of the stipulated period from the\ndate of the completion of the contract, subject to obtention of\ncertificate(s) from the specified authority.\n(ii) Retention money may also be sometimes stipulated against the\nsupplies portion in the case of turn-key projects. It may like-\nwise arise in the case of sub-contracts. The payment of retention\nmoney is contingent in nature as it is a defect liability.\n(iii) The following guidelines should be followed in regard to grant\nof advances against retention money:\n(a) No advances may be granted against retention money\nrelating to services portion  of the contract.\n(b) Exporters may be advised to arrange, as far as possible,\nprovision of suitable guarantees, instead of retention\nmoney.(c) Banks may consider, on a selective basis, granting of\nadvances against retention money relating to the supplies\nportion  of the contract taking into account, among others,\nthe size of the retention money accumulated, its impact on\nthe liquid funds position of the exporter and the past\nperformance regarding the timely receipt of retention\nmoney.\n(d) The payment of retention money may be secured by L/C or\nBank Guarantee where possible.\n(e) Where the retention money is payable within a period of\none year from the date of shipment, according to the terms\nof the contract, banks should charge prescribed concessive\nrate of interest upto a maximum period of 90 days. The\nrate of interest prescribed for the category 'ECNOS' at\npost-shipment stage may be charged for the period beyond\n90 days.\n(f) Where the retention money is payable after a period of one\nyear from the date of shipment, according to the terms of\nthe contract and the corresponding advance is extended for\na period exceeding one year, it will be treated as post-\nshipment credit given on deferred payment terms\nexceeding one year, and the rate of interest for that\ncategory will apply.\n(g) Advances against retention money will be eligible for\nconcessional rate of interest only to the extent the advances\nare actually repaid by remittances received from abroad\nrelating to the retention money and provided such\npayments are received within 180 days from the due date\nof payment of the retention money, according to the terms\nof the contract.\n2.4.5 Export on Consignment Basis\n(i) General\n(a) Export on consignment basis lends scope for a lot of\nmisuse in the matter of repatriation of export proceeds.\n(b) Therefore, export on consignment basis should be at par\nwith exports on outright sale basis on cash terms in matters\nregarding the rate of interest to be charged by banks on\npost-shipment credit. Thus, in the case of exports on\nconsignment basis, even if extension in the period beyond\n180 days is granted by the Exchange Control Department\nfor repatriation of export proceeds, banks will charge\nappropriate concessive rate of interest only upto the\nnotional due date (depending upon the tenor of the bills),\nsubject to a maximum of 180 days.(ii) Export of precious and semi-precious stones\nPrecious and semi-precious stones, etc. are exported mostly on\nconsignment basis and the exporters are not in a position to\nliquidate pre-shipment credit account with remittances received\nfrom abroad within a period of 180 days from the date of\nadvance. Banks may, therefore, adjust packing credit advances\nin the case of consignment exports, as soon as export takes\nplace, by transfer of the outstanding balance to a special (post-\nshipment) account which in turn, should be adjusted as soon as\nthe relative proceeds are received from abroad but not later than\n180 days from the date of export or such extended period as\nmay be permitted by Exchange Control Department, Reserve\nBank of India. Balance in the special (post-shipment) account\nwill not be eligible for refinance from RBI.\n(iii) Consignment exports to CIS and East European Countries\n(a) RBI (ECD) is allowing in deserving cases, on application\nby individual exporters with satisfactory track record, a\nlonger period of upto 12 months for realisation of proceeds\nof export on consignment basis in convertible currencies to\nCIS (former USSR) and East European Countries. Banks\nmay extend post-shipment credit to such exporters for a\nlonger period ab initio . Accordingly, the interest rate\napplicable will be as follows:\nPeriod of Post-shipment Credit\nRate of Interest\nUpto 90 days from the date\nThe rate applicable for\nof advance\nusance bills for period\nupto 90 days\nBeyond 90 days and upto\nThe rate applicable for\n12 months from the date of\nusance bills beyond 90\nshipment\ndays and upto 6 months\nfrom the date of shipment(b) It is expected that sale proceeds of goods exported on\nconsignment basis to the above countries would be realised\nwithin the permitted period of upto 12 months and post-\nshipment credit liquidated. In case the sale proceeds are\nnot realised within the said period, the higher rate of\ninterest as applicable for bills realised beyond 6 months\nfrom the date of shipment i.e. ECNOS - Post-shipment will\napply for the entire period beyond 6 months.\n(c) Refinance to banks against export credit would, however,\nbe available from RBI upto a period of 180 days only each\nat pre-shipment and post-shipment stages.(iv) Consignment exports to Russian Federation against\nrepayment of State Credit in rupees\n(a) RBI (ECD) is allowing on application, Export Houses/\nTrading Houses/Star Trading Houses/Super Star Trading\nHouses with satisfactory track record, a longer period of\nupto 360 days from the date of shipment for realisation of\nproceeds of exports of permitted goods as announced by\nthem from time to time to the Russian Federation on\nconsignment basis against repayment of State Credits in\nrupees. For the procedure to be followed, reference may be\nmade to AD(GP Series) Circular No. 5 dated May 31, 1999\nand subsequent instructions, if any, issued in this regard by\nExchange Control Department, Reserve Bank of India.\nBanks may extend post-shipment credit to such exporters\nfor a longer period ab initio . Accordingly, the interest rate\napplicable will be as follows:\nPeriod of Post-shipment Credit\nRate of Interest\nUpto 90 days from the date\nThe rate applicable for\nof advance\nusance bills for period\nupto 90 days\nBeyond 90 days and upto\nThe rate applicable for\n360 days from the date of\nusance bills beyond 90\nshipment\ndays and upto 6 months\nfrom the date of shipment\n(b) In case, sale proceeds are not realised within the said\nperiod, the higher rate of interest as applicable for bills\nrealised beyond 6 months from the date of shipment will\napply for the entire period beyond 6 months.\n(c) The refinance to banks against export credit would,however, be available from RBI upto a period of 180 days\nonly each at pre and post shipment stages.\n2.4.6 Exports through the Warehouse-cum-Display Centres Abroad\n(i) Some Indian organisations/exporters are permitted by RBI (ECD)\nto establish warehouses abroad for storing the goods exported\nfrom India to enable them to arrange off-the-shelf sales for\nachieving greater penetration in the overseas markets. Since\nexports to these warehouses are in anticipation of orders from the\nbuyers overseas, the prescribed period of realisation of proceeds\nof such export has been fixed upto fifteen months from the date\nof shipment as against the normal period of six months in other\ncases.\n(ii) In view of longer period of realisation permitted, ab initio , the\ninterest rates on the post-shipment credit in rupee against\nexports through approved warehouses are as follows:\nPeriod of Post-shipment Credit\nRate of Interest\nUpto 90 days from the date of\nThe rate applicable for\nadvance\nusance bills for period upto\n90 days\nBeyond 90 days and upto 15\nThe rate applicable for\nmonths from the date of\nusance bills beyond 90 days\nshipment\nand upto 6 months from the\ndate of shipment\n(iii) In case sale proceeds are not realised within the said period, the\nhigher rate of interest as applicable for bills realised beyond 6\nmonths from the date of shipment i.e. ECNOS - Post-shipment\nwill apply for the entire period beyond 6 months.\n(iv) Refinance to the bank against export credit would be available\nfrom RBI upto a period of 180 days only each at pre-shipment\nand post-shipment stages.2.4.7 Export of Goods for Exhibition and Sale\nBanks may provide finance to exporters against goods sent for\nexhibition and sale abroad in the normal course in the first instance,\nand after the sale is completed, allow the benefit of the concessive rate\nof interest on such advances, both at the pre-shipment stage and at the\npost-shipment stage, upto the stipulated periods, by way of a rebate.\nSuch advances should be given in separate accounts.\n2.4.8 Post-shipment Credit on Deferred Payment Terms\nBanks may grant post-shipment credit on deferred payment terms for a\nperiod exceeding one year, in respect of export of capital and producer\ngoods as specified by RBI (ECD) from time to time.\n2.5 Post-shipment Advances against Duty Drawback Entitlements\n2.5.1 Banks may grant post-shipment advances to exporters against their\nduty drawback entitlements as provisionally certified by Customs\nAuthorities pending final sanction and payment.\n2.5.2 The advance against duty drawback receivables can also be made\navailable to exporters against export promotion copy of the shipping\nbill containing the EGM Number issued by the Customs Department.\nWhere necessary, the financing bank may have its lien noted with the\ndesignated bank and arrangements may be made with the designated\nbank to transfer funds to the financing bank as and when duty\ndrawback is credited by the Customs.\n2.5.3 These advances granted against duty drawback entitlements would be\neligible for concessional rate of interest and refinance from RBI upto a\nmaximum period of 90 days from the date of advance.2.6 ECGC Whole Turnover Post-shipment Guarantee Scheme\n2.6.1 The Whole Turnover Post-shipment Guarantee Scheme of the Export\nCredit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. (ECGC) provides\nprotection to banks against non-payment of post-shipment credit by\nexporters. Banks may, in the interest of export promotion, consider\nopting for the Whole Turnover Post-shipment Policy. The salient\nfeatures of the scheme may be obtained from ECGC.\n2.6.2 As the post-shipment guarantee is mainly intended to benefit the\nbanks, the cost of premium in respect of the Whole Turnover Post-\nshipment Guarantee taken out by banks may be absorbed by the banks\nand not passed on to the exporters.\n2.6.3 Where the risks are covered by the ECGC, banks should not slacken\ntheir efforts towards realisation of their dues against long outstanding\nexport bills.\n3. DEEMED EXPORTS - CONCESSIVE RUPEE EXPORT CREDIT\n3.1 Banks are permitted to extend rupee pre-shipment and post-supply rupee export\ncredit at concessional rate of interest to parties against orders for supplies in\nrespect of projects aided/financed by bilateral or multilateral agencies/funds\n(including World Bank, IBRD, IDA), as notified from time to time by\nDepartment of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance under the Chapter\n\"Deemed Exports\" in Exim Policy, which are eligible for grant of normal export\nbenefits by Government of India.\n3.2 Packing Credit provided should be adjusted from free foreign exchange\nrepresenting payment for the suppliers of goods to these agencies. It can also be\nrepaid/prepaid out of balances in Exchange Earners Foreign Currency account\n(EEFC A/c), as also from the rupee resources of the exporter to the extent\nsupplies have actually been made.\n3.3 Banks may also extend rupee\n(i) pre-shipment credit, and\n(ii) post-supply credit (for a maximum period of 30 days or upto the actual\ndate of payment by the receiver of goods, whichever is earlier).\nto other categories of supply of goods specified as 'Deemed Exports' under the\nsame Chapter of Exim Policy from time to time.\n3.4 The post-supply advances would be treated as overdue after the period of 30\ndays. In cases where such overdue credits are liquidated within a period of 180\ndays from the notional due date (i.e. before 210 days from the date of advance),\nthe banks are required to charge, for such extended period, interest prescribed\nfor the category 'ECNOS' at post-shipment stage. If the bills are not paid within\nthe aforesaid period of 210 days, banks should charge from the date of advance,\nthe rate prescribed for 'ECNOS' - Post-shipment.\n3.5 Banks would be eligible for refinance from RBI for such rupee export credits\nextended both at pre-shipment and post-supply stages.4. SPECIAL FINANCIAL PACKAGE FOR LARGE VALUE EXPORTS -\nRUPEE CREDIT INTEREST RATES\n4.1 A special financial package has been drawn in consultation with the\nGovernment\nofIndia, for large value exports of select products, which are\ninternationally competitive and have high value addition. The details\nofthe\nfinancial package are furnished below:\n(i)The products eligible for export under special financial package\nare:\n(a) pharmaceuticals (including drugs, fine chemicals),\n(b) agro-chemicals (including inorganic and organic chemicals),\n(c) transport equipment (including commercial vehicles,\ntwoand\nthree wheelers, tractors, railway wagons, locomotives),\n(d) cement (including glass, glassware, ceramics and refractories),\n(e) iron and steel (including iron & steel bars/rods and primary and\nsemi-finished iron & steel),\n(f) electrical machinery (including transmission line towers,\nswitch gear, transformers).\n(g) leather and leather goods.\n(h) textiles\n(i) products of aluminium\n(j) petroleum products\n(k) sugar\n(l) foodgrains\n(ii) Exporters of above products with export contracts of Rs. 100 crore and\nabove in value terms in one year will be eligible for the special financial\npackage.\n(iii) Validity period of the financial package will be upto September\n30, 2004.\n(iv) Exporters covered under the special financial package will be extended\ncredit for an extended period upto 365 days at pre as well as post\nshipment stages. However, the rate of interest for pre-shipment credit\nbeyond 180 days and for post-shipment credit beyond 90 days are to be\ndecided by banks taking into account their PLR and spread guidelines.\n4.2 A monthly statement of credit extended at both pre and post-shipment stages\nunder the above financial package may be forwarded to RBI, IECD.5. INTEREST ON EXPORT CREDIT\n5.1 General\nA ceiling rate has been prescribed for rupee export credit linked to Prime Lending\nRates ( PLRs) of individual banks available to their domestic borrowers. Banks have,\ntherefore, freedom to decide the actual rates to be charged within the specified\nceilings. Further, the ceiling interest rates for different time buckets under any\ncategory of  export credit should be on the basis of the PLR relevant for the entire\ntenor of export credit.\n5.2 Interest Rate on Rupee Export Credit\n5.2.1 Interest Rate Structure\nThe interest rate structure for rupee export credit applicable for the period\nupto 30.4.2005:\nType of Credit Interest Rate @\n1. Pre-shipment Credit\n(from the date of advance)\n(i) (a) Upto 180 days Not exceeding BPLR\nminus 2.5 percentage\npoints\n(b) Beyond 180 days and upto Free*\n270 days\n(ii) Against incentives receivable Not exceeding BPLR\nfrom Government (covered by minus 2.5 percentage\nECGC Guarantee) upto 90 days points\n2.

Deferred Credit\nDeferred credit for the period beyond Free *\n90 days\n4. Export Credit Not Otherwise\nSpecified (ECNOS)\n(i) Pre-shipment credit Free*\n(ii) Post-shipment credit Free*\n^ upto notional due date or actual due date, whichever is earlier.\n+ Interest rate for credit beyond 90 days from the date of advance has to\nbe charged slab-wise (1-90 days and 91-180 days).\n@ Since these are ceiling rates, banks would be free to charge any rate\nbelow the ceiling rates.*Banks are free to decide the rate of interest, keeping in view the PLR\nand spread guidelines.\n5.2.2 Application of Interest Rates\nThe revision in interest rates made from time to time is made applicable to fresh\nadvances as also  to the existing advances for the remaining period of credit.\n5.2.3 Interest on Pre-shipment Credit\ni) Banks should charge interest on pre-shipment credit upto 180 days at the rate\nto be decided by the bank within the ceiling rate arrived at on the basis of PLR\nrelevant for the entire tenor of the export credit under the category. The period of\ncredit is to be reckoned from the date of advance.ii) If pre-shipment advances are not liquidated from proceeds of\nbills on purchase, discount, etc. on submission of export\ndocuments within 360 days from the date of advance, the\nadvances will cease to qualify for concessive rate of interest ab\ninitio .\niii) In cases where packing credit is not extended beyond the original\nperiod of sanction and exports take place after the expiry of\nsanctioned period but within a period of 360 days from the date\nof advance, exporter would be eligible for concessional credit\nonly upto the sanctioned period. For the balance period, interest\nrate prescribed for ECNOS at pre-shipment stage will apply.\nFurther, the reasons for non-extension of the period need to be\nadvised by banks to the exporter.\niv) In cases where exports do not take place within 360 days from\nthe date of pre-shipment advance, such credits will be termed as\n\u2018Export Credit Not Otherwise Specified\u2019 (ECNOS) and banks\nmay charge interest rate prescribed for \u2018ECNOS \u2013 pre-shipment\u2019\nfrom the very first day of the advance.\nv) If exports do not materialise at all, banks should charge on\nrelative packing credit domestic lending rate plus penal rate of\ninterest, if any, to be decided by the banks on the basis of a\ntransparent policy approved by their Board.\n5.2.4 Interest on Post-shipment Credit\n(i) Early payment of export bills\n(a) In the case of advances against demand bills, if the bills\nare realised before the expiry of the normal transit period\n(NTP), interest at the concessive rate shall be charged\nfrom the date of advance till the date of realisation of such\nbills. The date of realisation of demand bills for this\npurpose would be the date on which the proceeds get\ncredited to the banks' Nostro accounts.\n(b) In the case of advance/credit against usance export bills,\ninterest at concessive rate may be charged only upto the\nnotional/actual due date or the date on which export\nproceeds get credited to the bank\u2019s Nostro account abroad,\nwhichever is earlier, irrespective of the date of credit to\nthe borrower's/exporter's account in India. In cases where\nthe correct due date can be established before/immediately\nafter availment of credit due to acceptance by overseas\nbuyer or otherwise, concessive interest can be applied\nonly upto the actual due date, irrespective of whatever\nmay be the notional due date arrived at, provided the\nactual due date falls before the notional due date.\n(c) Where interest for the entire NTP in the case of demand\nbills or upto notional/actual due date in the case of usance\nbills as stated at (b) above, has been collected at the timeof negotiation/purchase/discount of bills, the excess\ninterest collected for the period from the date of\nrealisation to the last date of NTP/notional due date/actual\ndue date should be refunded to the borrowers.\n5.2.5 Overdue Export Bills\n(i) In case of export bills, the rate of interest decided by the bank\nwithin the ceiling rate stipulated by RBI will apply upto the due\ndate of the bill ( upto NTP in case of demand bill and specified\nperiod in case of usance bills).\n(ii) For the period beyond the due date viz. for the overdue period,\nthe rate fixed for \u2018Export Credit Not Otherwise Specified\u2019\n(ECNOS)  at post-shipment stage  will apply and no penal\ninterest should be charged additionally.\n(iii) Banks should ensure that the additional interest by way of\noverdue interest (ECNOS) should not be levied where there has\nbeen no advance (pre or post shipment) taken by the exporter.\n5.2.6 Interest on Post-shipment Credit Adjusted from Rupee Resources\nBanks should adopt the following guidelines to ensure uniformity in\ncharging interest on post-shipment advances which are not adjusted in\nan approved manner due to non-accrual of foreign exchange and\nadvances have to be adjusted out of the funds received from the Export\nCredit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. (ECGC) in settlement of\nclaims preferred on them on account of the relevant export consignment:\n(a) In case of exports to certain countries, exporters are unable to\nrealise export proceeds due to non-expatriation of the foreign\nexchange by the Governments/Central Banking Authorities of\nthe countries concerned as a result of their balance of payment\nproblems even though payments have been made locally by the\nbuyers. In these cases ECGC offer cover to exporters for transfer\ndelays. Where ECGC have admitted the claims and paid the\namount for transfer delay, banks may charge interest as\napplicable to \u2018ECNOS - Post-shipment\u2019 even if the post-\nshipment advance may be outstanding beyond six months from\nthe date of shipment. Such interest would be applicable on the\nfull amount of advance irrespective of the fact that the ECGC\nadmit the claims to the extent of 90 percent/75 percent and the\nexporters have to bring the balance 10 percent/25 percent from\ntheir own rupee resources.\n(b) In a case where interest has been charged at commercial rate or\nECNOS if export proceeds are realised in an approved manner\nsubsequently, the bank may refund to the borrower the excess\namount representing difference between the quantum of interest\nalready charged and interest that is chargeable taking into\naccount the said realisation after ensuring the fact of suchrealisation with satisfactory evidence. While making adjustments\nof accounts it would be better if the possibility of refund of\nexcess interest is brought to the notice of the borrower.\n5.2.7 Change of Tenor of Bill\n(i) In terms of  para C.14 of the AP DIR series Circular No. 12\nFEMA Notification issued by RBI (ECD), banks have been\npermitted, on request from exporters, to allow change of the\ntenor of the original buyer/ consignee, provided inter alia, the\nrevised due date of payment does not fall beyond six months\nfrom the date of shipment.\n(ii) In such cases as well as where change of tenor upto six months\nfrom the date of shipment has been allowed, it would be in order\nfor banks to extend the concessional rate of interest upto the\nrevised notional due date, subject to the interest rates Directive\nissued by RBI.\nNote:\n(Ceilings rates of interest on credit extended to exporters as prescribed\nin the circular are lower than the maximum lending rates normally\ncharged to other borrowers and are, therefore, indicated as concessive\nin this sense).Appendix\nMaster Circular\nRUPEE EXPORT CREDIT\nList of Circulars consolidated by the Master Circular\nNo. Circular No. Date Subject\n1.

PRE-SHIPMENT EXPORT CREDIT\n1.1 Pre-shipment Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC)\n1.1.1 Definition\n'Pre-shipment credit'  means any loan or advance granted or any other credit provided by a bank to an\nexporter for financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing  or packing of goods  prior to shipment, on\nthe basis of letter of credit opened in his favour or in favour of some other person, by an overseas buyer or a\nconfirmed and irrevocable order for the export of goods from India or any other evidence of an order for\nexport from India having been placed on the exporter or some other person, unless lodgement  of export\norders or letter of credit with the bank has been waived .\n1.1.2 General\nWith a view to making credit available to exporters at internationally competitive rates, authorised dealers\nhave been permitted to extend Pre-shipment Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC) to exporters for domestic and\nimported inputs of exported goods at LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR related rates of interest as detailed\nbelow.\n1.1.3 Scheme\n(i) The scheme is an additional window for providing pre-shipment credit to Indian exporters at\ninternationally competitive rates of interest. It will be applicable to only cash exports.\n(ii) The exporter will have the following options to avail of export finance:\n(a) to avail of pre-shipment credit in rupees and then the post-shipment credit either in rupees or\ndiscounting/ rediscounting of export bills under EBR Scheme mentioned in paragraph 2.2.\n(b) to avail of pre-shipment credit in foreign currency and discount/rediscounting of the export bills in\nforeign currency under EBR Scheme.\n(c) to avail of pre-shipment credit in rupees and then convert drawals into PCFC at the discretion of the\nbank.\n(iii) Choice of currency\n(a) The facility may be extended in one of the convertible currencies viz. US Dollars, Pound Sterling,\nJapanese Yen, Euro, etc.\n(b) To enable the exporters to have operational flexibility, it will be in order for banks to extend PCFC\nin one convertible currency in respect of an export order invoiced in another convertible currency. For\nexample , an exporter\ncan avail of PCFC in US Dollar against an export order invoiced in Euro.  The risk and cost of cross\ncurrency transaction will be that of the exporter.(iv) Banks are permitted to extend PCFC for exports to ACU countries.\n(v) The applicable benefit to the exporters will accrue only after the realisation of the export bills or when the\nresultant export bills are rediscounted on \u2018without recourse\u2019 basis.\n1.1.4 Source of Funds for Banks\n(i) The foreign currency balances available with the bank in Exchange Earners Foreign Currency (EEFC) Accounts,\nResident Foreign Currency Accounts RFC(D) and Foreign Currency (Non-Resident) Accounts (Banks) Scheme\ncould be utilised for financing the pre-shipment credit in foreign currency.\n(ii) Banks are also permitted to utilise the foreign currency balances available under Escrow Accounts and\nExporters Foreign Currency Accounts for the purpose, subject to ensuring that the requirements of funds by the\naccount holders for permissible transactions are met and the limit prescribed for maintaining maximum balance in\nthe account under broad based facility is not exceeded.\n(iii) Foreign currency lines of credit\n(a) In addition, banks may arrange for \u2018lines of credit\u2019  from abroad. Banks may negotiate lines of credit with\noverseas banks for the purpose of grant of PCFC to exporters without the prior approval of the RBI, provided\nthe rate of interest on the line of credit does not exceed 0.75 percent over six months LIBOR/EURO\nLIBOR/EURIBOR.\n(b) Banks should draw on the line of credit arranged only to the extent of loans granted by them to the\nexporters under the PCFC. However, where the overseas bank making available the line of credit stipulates a\nminimum amount for drawals which should not be very large, the small unutilised portion may be managed\nby the bank within its foreign exchange position and Aggregate Gap Limit (AGL) limit. Similarly, any pre-\npayment by the exporter may also be taken within the foreign exchange position and AGL limits.\n(c) Banks may avail of lines of credit from other banks in India  if they are not in a position to raise loans\nfrom abroad on their own, subject to the condition that ultimate cost to the exporter should not exceed 0.75\npercent above LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR, provided the bankdoes not have a branch abroad. The spread between the borrowing and lending bank is left to the\ndiscretion of the banks concerned.\n(iv) In case the exporters have arranged for the suppliers\u2019 credit for procuring imported inputs, the PCFC facility\nmay be extended by the banks only for the purpose of financing domestic inputs for exports.\n(v) Banks are also permitted to use foreign currency funds borrowed in terms of para 4.2( i) of Notification  No.\nFEMA.3/2000 RB dated May 3, 2000 as also foreign currency funds generated through buy-sell swaps in the\ndomestic forex market for granting Pre-shipment Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC) subject to adherance to\nAggregate Gap Limit (AGL) approved by RBI ( ECD).\n1.1.5 Spread\n(i) The spread for pre-shipment credit in foreign currency will be related to the international reference rate such as\nLIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR (6 months).\n(ii) The lending rate to the exporter should not exceed 0.75 percent over LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR,\nexcluding withholding tax.\n(iii) LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR rates are normally available for standard period of 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months.\nBanks may quote rates on the basis of standard period if PCFC is required for periods less than 6 months. However,\nwhile quoting rates for non-standard period, banks should ensure that the rate quoted is below the next upper\nstandard period rate.\n(iv) Banks may collect interest on PCFC at quarterly intervals against sale of foreign currency or out of balances in\nEEFC accounts or out of discounted value of the export bills if PCFC is liquidated within the quarterly rest for\ncollection of interest.\n1.1.6 Period of Credit\n(i) The PCFC will be available as in the case of rupee credit initially for a maximum period of 180 days; any\nextension of the credit will be subject to the same terms and conditions as applicable for extension of rupee packing\ncredit and it will also have additional interest cost of 2 percent above the rate for the initial period of 180 days\nprevailing at the time of extension.\n(ii) Further extension will be subject to the terms and conditions fixed by the bank concerned and if no export takes\nplace within 360 days, the PCFC will be adjusted at T.T. selling rate for the currency concerned. In such cases,\nbanks can arrange to remit foreign exchange to repay the loan or line of credit raised abroad and interest without\nprior permission of RBI.(iii) For extension of PCFC within 180 days, banks are permitted to extend on a fixed roll over basis of the principal\namount at the applicable LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR rate for extended period plus permitted margin (0.75\npercent over LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR).\n1.1.7 Disbursement of PCFC\n(i) In case, full amount of PCFC or part thereof is utilised to finance domestic input, banks may apply appropriate\nspot rate for the transaction.\n(ii) As regards the minimum lots of transactions, it is left to the operational convenience of banks to stipulate the\nminimum lots taking into account the availability of their own resources. However, while fixing the minimum lot,\nbanks may take into account the needs of their small customers also.\n(iii) Banks should take steps to streamline their procedures so that no separate sanction is needed for PCFC once the\npacking credit limit has been authorised and the disbursement is not delayed at the branches.\n1.1.8 Liquidation of PCFC Account\n(i) General\nPCFC can be liquidated out of proceeds of export documents on their submission for\ndiscounting/rediscounting under the EBR Scheme detailed in para 2.2 or by grant of foreign currency loans\n(DP Bills). Subject to mutual agreement between the exporter and the banker it can also be repaid / prepaid\nout of balances in EEFC A/c as also from rupee resources of the exporter to the extent exports have actually\ntaken place.\n(ii) Packing credit in excess of F.O.B. value\nIn certain cases, (viz. agro based products like HPS Groundnut, defatted & deoiled cakes, tobacco, pepper,\ncardamom, cashew nuts, etc.) where packing credit required is in excess of FOB value, PCFC would be\navailable only for exportable portion of the produce.\n(iii) Substitution of order/commodity\nRepayment/liquidation of PCFC could be with export documents relating to any other order covering the\nsame or any other commodity exported by the exporter . While allowing substitution of contract in this\nway, banks should ensure that it is commercially necessary and unavoidable. Banks should also satisfy about\nthe valid reasons as to why PCFC extended for shipment of a particular commodity cannot be liquidated in\nthe normal method. As far as possible, thesubstitution of contract should be allowed if the exporter maintains account with the same bank or it has the\napproval of the members of the consortium, if any.\n1.1.9 Cancellation/Non-execution of Export Order\n(i) In case of cancellation of the export order for which the PCFC was availed of by the exporter from the bank, or if\nthe exporter is unable to execute the export order for any reason, it will be in order for the exporter to repay the loan\ntogether with accrued interest thereon, by purchasing foreign exchange (principal + interest) from domestic market\nthrough the bank.  In such cases, interest will be payable on the rupee equivalent of principal amount at the rate\napplicable to 'Export Credit Not Otherwise Specified'  (ECNOS)  at pre-shipment stage plus a penal rate of\ninterest to be decided by the bank from the date of advance after adjustment of interest of PCFC already recovered.\nBanks are free to decide the rate of interest for ECNOS at pre-shipment stage, subject to PLR and spread guidelines.\n(ii) It will also be in order for the banks to remit the amount to the overseas bank, provided the PCFC was made\navailable to exporter from the line of credit obtained from that bank.\n(iii) Banks may extend PCFC to such exporters subsequently, after ensuring that the earlier cancellation of PCFC\nwas due to genuine reasons.\n1.1.10 Running Account Facility for All Commodities\n(i) Banks are permitted to extend the \u2018Running Account\u2019 facility under the PCFC Scheme to exporters for all\ncommodities, on the lines of the facility available under rupee credit, subject to the following conditions:\n(a) The facility may be extended provided the need for \u2018Running Account\u2019 facility has been established by\nthe exporters to the satisfaction of the bank.\n(b) Banks may extend the facility only to those exporters whose track record has been good.\n(c) In all cases, where Pre-shipment Credit \u2018Running Account\u2019 facility has been extended, the L/Cs or firm\norders should be produced within a reasonable period of time.\n(d) The PCFC will be marked-off on the \u2018First-in-First-out\u2019 basis.\n(e) PCFC can also be marked-off with proceeds of export documents against which no PCFC has been drawn\nby the exporter.(ii) Banks should closely monitor the production of firm order or L/C subsequently by exporters and also the end-\nuse of funds. It has to be ensured that no diversion of funds is made for domestic use. In case of non- utilisation of\nPCFC drawals for export purposes, the penal provisions stated above should be made applicable and the \u2018Running\nAccount\u2019 facility should be withdrawn for the concerned exporter.\n(iii) Banks are required to take any prepayment by the exporter under PCFC scheme within their foreign exchange\nposition and Aggregate Gap Limit (AGL) as indicated in paragraph 1.1.4 (iii) (b) above. With the extension of\n\u2018Running Account\u2019 facility, mismatches are likely to occur for a longer period involving cost to the banks. Banks\nmay charge the exporters the funding cost, if any, involved in absorbing mismatches in respect of the prepayment\nbeyond one month period.\n1.1.11 Forward Contracts\n(i) In terms of paragraph 1.1.3 (iii) above, PCFC can be extended in any of the convertible currencies in respect of\nan export order invoiced in another convertible currency. Banks are also permitted to allow an exporter to book\nforward contract on the basis of confirmed export order prior to availing of PCFC and cancel the contract (for\nportion of drawal used for imported inputs) at prevailing market rates on availing of PCFC.\n(ii) Banks are permitted to allow customers to seek cover in any permitted currency of their choice which is actively\ntraded in the market, subject to ensuring that the customer is exposed to exchange risk in a permitted currency in the\nunderlying transaction.\n(iii) While allowing forward contracts under the scheme, banks may ensure compliance of the basic Exchange\nControl requirement are that the customer is exposed to an exchange risk in the underlying transaction at different\nstages of the export finance.\n1.1.12 Sharing of EPC under PCFC\n(i) The rupee export packing credit is allowed to be shared between an export order holder and the manufacturer of\nthe goods to be exported.\n(ii) Similarly, banks may extend PCFC also to the manufacturer on the basis of the disclaimer from the export order\nholder through his bank. PCFC granted to the manufacturer can be repaid by transfer of foreign currency from the\nexport order holder by availing of PCFC or by discounting of bills. Banks should ensure that no double financing is\ninvolved in the transaction(ii) Banks should closely monitor the production of firm order or L/C subsequently by exporters and also the end-\nuse of funds. It has to be ensured that no diversion of funds is made for domestic use. In case of non- utilisation of\nPCFC drawals for export purposes, the penal provisions stated above should be made applicable and the \u2018Running\nAccount\u2019 facility should be withdrawn for the concerned exporter.\n(iii) Banks are required to take any prepayment by the exporter under PCFC scheme within their foreign exchange\nposition and Aggregate Gap Limit (AGL) as indicated in paragraph 1.1.4 (iii) (b) above.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SIMPLIFICATION OF PROCEDURES \n1.1 Customer Service  \n1.1.1 General \n(i) Banks may provide timely and adequate credit and also render \nessential customer services/guidance in regard to procedural \nformalities and export opportunities to their exporter clients. \n(ii) Banks should open Export Counsel Offices to guide exporters \nparticularly the small ones and those taking up non-traditional exports. \n1.1.2 Delay in Crediting the Proceeds of Export Bills Drawn in Foreign \nCurrency  \nDelays are observed in passing on the credit of export bills drawn in \nforeign currency to the exporters after the foreign currency amounts are credited to the \u2018Nostro\u2019 accounts of the banks. Although there are \ninstructions that the concessional post-shipment interest rate will cease from the date of credit to the 'Nostro' account, the credit limits enjoyed \nby the exporters remain frozen till the actual date of credit of rupee \nequivalent to the account of the customer. There is, therefore, need to \npromptly restore the limit of the exporters on realisation of bills and \npass on the rupee credit to the customer. \n1.1.3 Payment of Compensation to Exporters for Delayed Credit of Export \nBills \n(i) In respect of the delay in affording credit in respect of credit \nadvices complete in all respects, the compensation stipulated by \nFEDAI should be paid to the exporter client, without waiting for a demand from the exporter. \n(ii) Banks should devise a system to monitor timely credit of the \nexport proceeds to the exporters\u2019 account and payment of \ncompensation as per FEDAI rules. \n(iii) The internal audit and inspection teams of the banks should \nspecifically comment on these aspects in the reports. \n1.2   Sanction of Export Credit Proposals \n1.2.1 Time Limit for Sanction \n(i) The sanction of fresh/enhanced export credit limits should be \nmade within 45 days from the date of receipt of credit limit \napplication with the required details/information supported by \nrequisite financial/operating statements. In case of renewal of \nlimits and sanction of ad hoc credit facilities, the time taken by banks should not exceed  30 days and 15 days respectively. \n   2 \n1.2.2 Ad hoc Limit  \n(i) At times, exporters require ad hoc limits to take care of large \nexport orders which were not foreseen earlier. Banks should \nrespond to such situations promptly. Apart from this, banks \nshould adopt a flexible approach in respect of exporters, who for \ngenuine reasons are unable to bring in corresponding additional \ncontribution in respect of higher credit limits sought for specific \norders. No additional interest is to be charged in respect of \nad hoc limits granted by way of pre-shipment/post-shipment \nexport credit. \n(ii) In cases where the export credit limits are utilised fully, banks \nmay adopt a flexible approach in negotiating the bills drawn \nagainst L/Cs and consider in such cases delegating \ndiscretionary/higher sanctioning powers to branch managers to \nmeet the credit requirements of the exporters. Similarly \nbranches may also be authorised to disburse a certain percentage \nof the enhanced/ad hoc limits, pending sanction by the higher authorities/board/committee who had originally accorded \nsanctions, to enable the exporters to execute urgent export \norders in time. \n1.2.3. Other Requirements  \n(i) All rejections of export credit proposals should be brought to the \nnotice of the Chief Executives of the banks explaining the reasons for rejection. \n(ii) The internal audit and inspection teams of the banks should \ncomment specifically on the timely sanction of export credit \nlimits within the time schedule prescribed by RBI. \n(iii) The export credit limits should be excluded for bifurcation of \nthe working capital limit into loan and cash credit components. \n(iv) Banks should nominate suitable officers as compliance officers \nin their foreign departments/specialised branches to ensure \nprompt and timely disposal of cases pertaining to exporters. \n(v) It is necessary to submit a review note at quarterly intervals to \nthe Board on the position of sanction of credit limits to \nexporters. The note may cover among other things, number of \napplications (with quantum of credit) sanctioned within the \nprescribed time-frame, number of cases sanctioned with delay \nand pending sanction explaining reasons therefor.  31.3 Simplification of Procedure for Delivery of Export Credit in Foreign  \n           Currency and in Rupees \n1.3.1 General \nWith a view to ensuring timely delivery of credit to exporters \nand removing  procedural  hassles, the following guidelines may \nbe brought into effect. These guidelines are applicable to Rupee \nexport credit as well as export credit in foreign currency . \n1.3.2 Guidelines  \n(i) Simplification of procedures  \n(a) Banks should simplify the application form and reduce \ndata requirements from exporters for assessment of their \ncredit needs, so that exporters do not have to seek outside professional help to fill in the application form or to \nfurnish data required by the banks. \n(b) Banks should adopt any of the methods, viz. Projected \nBalance Sheet method, Turnover method or Cash Budget \nmethod, for assessment of working capital requirements of \ntheir exporter-customers, whichever is most suitable and \nappropriate to their business operations. \n(c) In the case of consortium finance, once the consortium has \napproved the assessment, member banks should \nsimultaneously initiate their respective sanction processes. \n(ii) 'On Line' credit to exporters\n \n \n(a) Banks provide 'Line of Credit' normally for one year which \nis reviewed annually. In case of delay in renewal, the \nsanctioned limits should be allowed to continue uninterrupted and urgent requirements of exporters should \nbe met on ad hoc basis. \n(b) In case of established exporters having satisfactory track \nrecord, banks should consider sanctioning a 'Line of Credit' \nfor a longer period, say, 3 years, with in-built flexibility to \nstep-up/step-down the quantum of limits within the overall \nouter limits assessed. The step-up limits will become operative on attainment of pre-determined performance \nparameters by the exporters. Banks should obtain security \ndocuments covering the outer limit sanctioned to the \nexporters for such longer period.   \n \n   4(c) In case of export of seasonal commodities, agro-based \nproducts etc., banks should sanction Peak/Non-peak credit \nfacilities to exporters. \n(d) Banks should permit interchangeability of pre-shipment \nand post- shipment credit limits. \n(e) Term Loan requirements for expansion of capacity, \nmodernisation of machinery and upgradation of technology \nshould also be met by banks at their normal rate of interest. \n(f) Assessment of export credit limits should be 'need based' \nand not directly linked to the availability of collateral \nsecurity. As long as the requirement of credit limit is justified on the basis of the exporter's performance and \ntrack record, the credit should not be denied merely on the \ngrounds of non-availability of collateral security. \n(iii) Waiver of submission of orders or L/Cs for availing pre-\nshipment credit  \n(a) Banks should not insist on submission of export order or \nL/C for every disbursement of pre-shipment credit, from \nexporters with consistently good track-record. Instead, a system of periodical submission of a Statement of L/Cs or \nexport orders in hand, should be introduced. \n(b) Banks may waive, ab initio, submission of order/LC in \nrespect of exporters with good track record and put in \nplace the system of obtaining periodical statement of \noutstanding orders/LCs on hand. However, the same may \nbe incorporated in the sanction proposals as well as in the sanction letters issued to exporters and appropriately \nbrought to the notice of ECGC. Further, if such waivers are \npermitted at a time subsequent to sanction of export credit \nlimits with the approval of the appropriate authority, the \nsame may be incorporated in the terms of sanction by way of amendments and communicated to ECGC. \n(iv) Handling of export documents\n \nBanks are required to obtain, among others, original sale \ncontract/confirmed order/proforma invoice countersigned by \noverseas buyer/indent from authorised agent of overseas buyer \nfor handling the export documents as per Exchange Control regulations. Submission of such documents need not be insisted \nupon at the time of handling the export documents, since the \ngoods have already been valued and cleared by the Customs \nauthorities, except in the case of transactions with Letters of \nCredit (L/C) where the terms of L/C require submission of the sale contract/other alternative documents.  5(v) Fast track clearance of export credit  \n(a) At specialised branches and branches having sizeable \nexport business, a facilitation mechanism for assisting \nexporter-customers should be put in place for quick initial scrutiny of credit application and for discussions for \nseeking additional information or clarifications. \n(b) Banks should streamline their internal systems and \nprocedures to comply with the stipulated time limits for \ndisposal of export credit proposals and also endeavour to \ndispose of export credit proposals ahead of the prescribed \ntime schedule. A flow chart indicating chronological movement of credit application from the date of receipt till \nthe date of sanction, should also accompany credit \nproposals. \n(c) Banks should delegate higher sanctioning powers to their \nbranches for export credit. \n(d) Banks should consider reducing at least some of the \nintervening layers in the sanctioning process. It would be \ndesirable to ensure that the total number of layers involved in decision-making in regard to export finance does not \nexceed three. \n(e) Banks should introduce a system of 'Joint Appraisal' by \nofficials at branches and administrative offices, to facilitate \nquicker processing of export credit proposals. \n(f) Where feasible, banks should set up a 'Credit Committee' at \nspecialised branches and at administrative offices, for \nsanctioning working capital facilities to exporters. The \n'Credit Committee' should have sufficiently higher \nsanctioning powers. \n(vi) Publicity and training\n \n(a) Generally, export credit at internationally competitive rates \nis made available in foreign currency at select branches  of \nbanks.  In order to make the scheme more popular and \nconsidering the competitive interest rate on foreign \ncurrency loans and to mitigate any possible exchange risk, exporters needs to be encouraged to make maximum use of \nexport credit in foreign currency.  Banks located in areas \nwith concentration of exporters should, therefore, give wide \npublicity to this important facility and make it easily \naccessible to all exporters including small exporters and ensure that more number of branches are designated for \nmaking available export credit in foreign currency. \n(b) Banks may also arrange to publicise widely the \nconcessionality available in the interest rates for deemed \nexports and ensure that operating staff are adequately \nsensitised in this regard.  6(c) Officers at operating level should be provided with \nadequate training.  In the matter of transfer of officials from \ncritical branches dealing in export credit, banks should \nensure that the new incumbents posted possess adequate \nknowledge/exposure in the areas of forex as well as export \ncredit to avoid delays in processing/sanctioning of export credit limits and subjecting exporters to the risk of \ncancellation of export orders. \n(vii) Customer Education\n \n(a) Banks should bring out a Hand Book containing salient \nfeatures of the simplified procedures for sanction of Export \nCredit in Foreign Currency at internationally competitive rates as well as in rupees for the benefit of their exporter-\nclients. \n(b) To facilitate interaction between banks and exporters, \nbanks should periodically organise Exporters' Meet at \ncentres with concentration of exporters \n1.3.3    Monitoring Implementation of Guidelines  \n(i) Banks should ensure that exporters \u2019 credit requirements are met \nin full and promptly at competitive rates. The above referred \nguidelines must be implemented, both in letter and spirit, so as \nto bring about a perceptible improvement in credit delivery and \nrelated banking services to export sector. Banks should also address the deficiencies, if any, in the mechanism of deployment \nof staff in their organisations to eliminate the bottlenecks in the \nflow of credit to the export sector. \n(ii) Banks should set up an internal team to visit branches \nperiodically, say, once in two months to gauge the extent of \nimplementation of the Guidelines. \n2. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS \n2.1 Export Credit Performance Indicator for Banks  \n2.1.1 Banks are required to reach a level of outstanding export credit \nequivalent of 12% of each bank's net bank credit. Accordingly, the performance of banks is being reviewed by the RBI, IECD at quarterly \nintervals. The performance of the banks in extending export credit will \nbe assessed on the basis of the average export credit outstanding \nreported in the fortnightly statement of Export Credit Refinance Limits \nsubmitted on reporting Fridays to RBI, MPD, Central Office, Mumbai.  \n2.1.2 Banks should endeavour to reach a level of export credit equivalent to \n12 percent of the bank \u2019s net bank credit. Where banks have already \nprovided export credit to the extent of 12 percent, endeavour should be \nmade to increase the same to a higher level and ensure that there is no  7fall in the ratio. No worthwhile export order should be denied export \ncredit from the banks. \n2.1.3 Failure to achieve the stipulated level of export credit and or failure to \nshow a distinct improvement in export credit performance could invite bank-specific policy responses which could include raising of reserve \nrequirements and withdrawal of refinance facilities. The Industrial & \nExport Credit Department of the Reserve Bank of India would closely monitor the export credit performance of the banks. \n2.2 Quarterly Data of Export Credit Disbursements  \nBanks should submit the export credit disbursement data on a quarterly basis in \nthe format given in Annexure 1 . Banks should ensure that the statement reaches \nReserve Bank of India, Industrial & Export Credit Department, Central Office, \nMumbai positively by the end of the month following the quarter to which it relates. \n2.3 Pre-shipment credit to Diamond Exporters - Conflict Diamonds - \nImplementation of Kimberley process Certification Scheme( KPCS)  \nTrading in conflict diamonds has been banned by U. N.  Resolutions  Nos. \n1173 and 1176 as the conflict diamonds play a large role in funding the rebels in \nthe civil torn areas of Sierra Leone. There is also a Prohibition  on the direct / \nindirect import of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone and Liberia in terms of UN Resolution No. 1306(2000) and 1343(2001) respectively. India, among \nother countries, has adopted a UN mandated new Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme to ensure that no rough diamonds mined and illegally \ntraded enter the country. Therefore, import of diamonds into India should be \naccompanied by Kimberley Process Certificate(KPC).

Export of engineering goods on deferred payment terms and execution of turnkey\nprojects and civil construction contracts abroad are collectively referred to as \u2018Project\nExports\u2019.  Project export contracts are generally of high value and exporters undertaking\nthem are required to offer competitive credit terms to be able to secure orders from foreign\nbuyers in the face of stiff international competition.  Indian exporters offering deferred\npayment terms to overseas buyers in respect of export of goods and those who have been\nawarded turnkey, civil construction contracts by overseas parties have to secure prior\napproval at post award stage from various institutions such as Authorised Dealer /Exim\nBank / Working Group/Reserve Bank of India as the case may be   for credit terms to be\noffered, third country imports etc.  Regulations relating to Project Exports and Service\nExports are laid down in this Memorandum which is divided into the following parts:\nPART  A  - General\nPART B  -  Project Exports\nPART C  -  Export of Services\nPART D  -  Other matters connected with Project\n        Exports & Service Exports\nScope of Memorandum\n2. (I) This memorandum contains directions to be observed by the exporters\nengaged in project exports and service exports as also Export Import Bank of India and\nauthorised dealers  while dealing with cases of project/service exports.\n(ii) Directions contained in t his Memorandum have been issued under Section\n10(4) and Section 11(1) of Foreign Exchange Management Act ,  1999 (42 of 1999).6PART  A  -  GENERAL\nConstitution of Working Group\nA.1 (I) Exporters who have secured orders for undertaking supply contracts o n\ndeferred payment terms or those who have secured turnkey/civil construction contracts\nabroad require approval/assistance of different institutions like Reserve Bank  (ECD),\nExim Bank and ECGC besides their own bankers.  With a view to obviating the need for\nexporters to approach each institution separately for such approvals and to avoid delays, a\nWorking Group has been constituted with representation from Reserve Bank (ECD), Exim\nBank and ECGC for the purpose of giving package approval for proposals submitted by\nexporters who have secured orders for execution of overseas contracts.  In case of\ncontracts of high value, representatives of Government of India are also invited to\nparticipate in the meetings of the Working Group.  In order to obtain immediate\nclarifications for speedy clearance of proposals by the Working Group, the concerned\nexporters and their bankers are also associated with the meetings.  With the same\nobjective, participation of the main sub-suppliers, sub-contractors or other associates and\ntheir bankers in such meetings is also encouraged, particularly in respect  of proposals for\nhigh value contracts.\n(ii) The Working Group also considers proposals for export of services in the\narea of management, technical consultancy, etc. where execution of the contracts involves\ngrant of fund-based and/or non-fund-based facilities from the Indian banking system or\nwhere deferred payment terms are to be offered.\nCriteria for consideration of\nProposals by Working Group\nA.2 (i) The Working Group will mainly examine, among others, the following aspects\nwhile considering grant of package approval for proposals for export of engineering goods\non deferred payment terms or for undertaking turnkey/construction contracts abroad:\n \n(a) Period of deferred credit offered vis-a-vis foreign competition, moratorium, rate of\ninterest, adequacy of advance and down payment provided for as well as\nrequirement of foreign exchange for execution of contract (viz. imports from third\ncountries, agency commission, freight, etc.) and overall economics of the proposal.\n \n(b) Nature of security obtainable from the foreign buyers against payments due and\nnature and extent of various bonds/guarantees required to be offered by the\nexporter (including those for procuring third country supplies).7 \n(c) Nature of escalation, force majeure and arbitration clauses provided in the contract\nand penalty/damages payment provisions.\n \n(d) Extent of fund-based and non-fund-based facilities required in India including pre-\nshipment and post-shipment credit and/or bridge finance requirement.\n \n(e) In case of turnkey contracts, economic and technical viability thereof as well as\nspecial features relating to erection, supervision and commissioning of the contract.\n(ii) As regards civil construction contracts, the Working G roup will consider\nproposals only from contractors who are on the approved list of Ministry of Commerce and\nIndustry, Government of India in order to ensure that only contractors having the necessary\ncompetence and capability undertake overseas construction contracts.    While\nconsidering proposals, the Working Group will endeavour to promote, wherever possible,\nthe idea of high value construction contracts being undertaken on a consortium basis.\nApart from examination of special features relevant to the proposal under consideration\nand the factors enumerated in sub-paragraph (i) above, the Working Group will also take\ninto account the following aspects while considering grant of package approval for\nconstruction contracts abroad:\n(a) Availability of infrastructural facilities in the importer country like transport, water,\nconstruction material, skilled/unskilled labour, etc. and nature of laws governing civil\nmatters, labour usages, etc.\n \n(b) Estimated monthly/quarterly cash flows for the entire duration of the contract and\narrangements between prime contractor and associate/sub-contractors for timely\nexecution of the contract in case of consortium arrangement.\n \n(c) Whether the contract would need any bridge finance facility abroad to meet\ntemporary cash flow deficits in working capital, if so, the manner of raising the\nbridge finance and its full repayment with interest.\n(iii) In regard to service contracts, the Working Group will, inter alia, take into\naccount relevant factors like size of the contract, nature of services to be rendered, overall\neconomic condition of the importer country, extent of international competition and potential\nand prospects for further export of services, goods or turnkey projects from India.\n(iv) The Working Group may suitably relax the above criteria at its discretion\nwhere warranted by merits of the proposal.  While considering proposals, the Working\nGroup may also make such suggestions or tender such advice as may be necessary to\navoid inter se competition and to promote, as far as possible, exports in such a way that\nthe foreign exchange benefit for the country is maximised.8Procedure for Clearance of Proposals\nA.3 (i) All applications to the Working Group are required to be submitted by the\nexporters through their bankers (who must be authorised dealers in foreign exchange) in\nthe prescribed form in the required number of copies sufficiently in advance to enable the\nWorking Group to hold a meeting of its members for consideration of the proposal.  When\na proposal is approved by the Working Group, a package clearance is granted by Exim\nBank, on behalf of all the members of the Working Group and conveyed to the exporters\u2019\nbankers through whom the proposal was received.  The Working Group\u2019s clearance will\nordinarily be given within a period of seven days from the date of receipt of the application,\nprovided it is complete in all respects.\n(ii) Exporters desiring to submit bids for execution of projects abroad including\nservice contracts will not be required to obtain clearance for submission of bids from the\nauthorised dealer /Exim Bank/ Working Group.  However, exporters in such cases are\nrequired to ensure that the conditions as laid down in the Memo PEM are complied with.\n(iii) On the basis of experience gained over the years and in or der to enable the\nexporters to expeditiously obtain clearance for contracts for supply of engineering goods\non deferred payment terms, turnkey contracts and civil construction contracts, powers have\nbeen delegated to authorised dealers and Exim Bank to grant post-award clearances in\ncases where the contract value does not exceed U.S. Dollar 100 Million.  Proposals for\nundertaking such export contracts up to the value of U.S. Dollar 100 Million will, therefore,\nbe cleared by authorised dealers / Exim Bank .  Proposals for undertaking such contracts\nexceeding U.S. Dollar 100 Million in value will need to be cleared by the Working Group.\n(iv) In the case of contracts for export of services on cash payment terms\nrequiring fund-based and/or non-fund based facilities, as also those involving deferred\npayment terms, authorised dealers and Exim Bank have been empowered to grant\nclearance upto the value of U.S. Dollar 100 Million.  Proposals for undertaking such export\ncontracts will, therefore, be cleared by authorised dealers/Exim Bank upto the value of U.S.\nDollar 100 Million.  Proposals for undertaking such contracts exceeding U.S. Dollar 100\nMillion in value will need to be cleared by the Working Group.\n(v) Proposals for deferred payment export or turnkey proje cts against Buyers\u2019\nCredits as well as for export of managerial / technical consultancy services  on deferred\npayment terms as also those on cash payment terms involving grant of any fund-based9and/or non-fund based facilities in excess of the monetary limits mentioned in sub-\nparagraph (iv) above will need the prior approval of the Working Group.\nDeclaration of the Exports and Handling of GR/SDF/PP Forms\nA.4 (i) The regulations notified under Notification No.FEMA 23/2000-RB dated 3rd\nMay 2000 and the directions issued vide A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 12 dated 9th\nSeptember 2000 relating to declaration of export of goods on GR/SDF/PP forms and other\nmatters apply mutatis mutandis, to project exports.  In order to facilitate maintenance of\nproper record of exports made on deferred payment terms, exporters should prominently\nsuperscribe both copies of relative GR/SDF/PP forms with the name of export contract for\nwhich supplies are being made and the number and date of the approval granted by the\napproving authority (viz. Authorised Dealer, Exim Bank and Working Group) noted on the\nGR/SDF/PP Form in the space provided therefor.  The duplicate copies of the forms\nshould be retained by authorised dealers duly certified after realisation of the last\ninstalment together with interest from overseas buyers.  Similar procedure should be\nfollowed by sub-suppliers also while declaring their exports on GR/SDF/PP forms.\n(ii) In connection with execution of projects, exporters may sometime be\nrequired to export \u2018consumables\u2019 such as tools, tackles, machinery spares etc. for which\nseparate payments will not be made by the overseas buyers.  Such consumables will have\nalso to be declared on GR/SDF/PP forms in the same manner as exports of machinery,\nmaterials, etc. which are separately paid for.  In such cases, authorised dealer may, on\napplication, permit exporters to raise invoices against their own site offices abroad, send\nthe shipping documents direct to those offices and realise the value due thereon in\nconvenient instalments out of the progress payments for the contracts.  The application to\nauthorised dealer may be accompanied by a declaration by the exporter that the\nconsumables are being exported for execution of the project export contract which has\nbeen approved by the authorised dealer / Exim Bank / Working Group as the case may be.\nThe number and the date of approval for the project export contract granted by the\napproving authority may be indicated on GR / SDF / PP Form.10PART  B  -  PROJECT EXPORTS\nExtension of deferred payment Terms\nB.1 Contracts for export of goods against payment to be received partly or fully beyond\nthe period statutorily prescribed for realisation of export proceeds are treated as deferred\npayment exports.  Ordinarily, contracts providing for deferred payment terms will be\nallowed only for export of engineering goods (capital goods and consumer durables).\nTurnkey projects involve rendering of services like designing, civil construction and erection\nand commissioning of plant / factory along with supply of machinery, equipment and\nmaterials.    Execution of civil construction contracts abroad involves mainly erection and\ncivil construction work and supply of  construction materials and equipment going into the\ncivil works.  Payment in respect of goods supplied under both turnkey and civil construction\ncontracts may be received on \u2018cash\u2019 basis but sometimes exporters are required to offer\ndeferred payment terms in respect of such supplies depending on the nature and size of\nthe project.  The terms and conditions governing extension of deferred credit terms are set\nout in the following paragraphs.\nNature of Credit\nB.2 Contracts for export of goods on deferred payment terms may be financed either\nunder supplier\u2019s credit or buyer\u2019s credit.  Under supplier\u2019s credit the exporter extends credit\ndirectly to the overseas buyer.  Buyer\u2019s credits are credits extended to the foreign buyers\nby authorised dealers or financial institutions in India (including a consortium of authorised\ndealers or financial institutions in India) and the exporters realise the export value in Indian\nrupees from the institution/s concerned straightaway.  As repayments under deferred\npayment arrangements are spread over a long period of time, exporters extending\nsupplier\u2019s credit as well as those desiring to undertake exports to be financed under\nbuyer\u2019s credit may seek the advice of Exim Bank or ECGC in regard to various risks\ninherent in extension of such long-term credits and ways and means of protecting\nthemselves against these risks.\nEligible Goods\nB.3 An illustrative List (in two parts, A and B) of engineering goods in respect of which\ncommercial export credit may be offered by exporters to prospective buyers abroad is\ngiven in Annexure I.  The list is subject to revision from time to time.  Inclusion11of goods in the lists does not imply that their exports may be made only on deferred\npayment terms.  Exporters should always endeavour to secure the best possible terms\nfrom their buyers so that foreign exchange accrues to the country as early as possible.  The\ndiscretion to include new items in or exclude the existing items from the list is vested in the\nWorking Group on Project Exports functioning with Exim Bank as the nodal agency.\nPeriod of Deferred Credit\nB.4 The periods for which credit may be offered for export of goods, consumer\ndurables, turnkey contracts and civil construction contracts will depend on merits of\nindividual case and may be determined by the exporter and his banker in mutual\nconsultation on the basis of commercial judgement.  However, consumer durables and\nmiscellaneous engineering goods (Part B of List) should ordinarily be exported on cash\nterms.  Four major factors viz. anticipated life of the goods to be exported, extent of foreign\ncompetition, nature of the foreign market and the contract value constitute the criteria for\ndetermining the overall terms of credit.\nConditions necessary for Clearance of\nproposals by Authorised Dealers / Exim Bank\nB.5 While it is not necessary for exporters to o btain prior approval for submission of\nbids/offers for execution of contracts, authorised dealer / Exim Bank should, while granting\npost-award clearance, ensure that the export proposals satisfy, inter-alia, the following\nconditions:\n(a) Moratorium or grace period applicable to repayment of principal (and not to\npayment of interest) should not exceed one year in respect of export of capital or\nproducer goods.  In the case of turnkey contracts, the moratorium should not exceed\ntwo years.  No moratorium should be permitted in respect of export of consumer\ndurables.  Interest should be payable even during the period of moratorium.\n \n(b) In case of supply contracts, deferred receivables should be received in equal half-\nyearly instalments over the agreed period with relation to mean date of shipment\n(i.e. the date by which 50 per cent supplies in terms of value will be completed) or\nthe date of respective shipment.  In case of turnkey projects, instalments should be\nrelated to either date of contract or the mean date of shipment or commissioning as\nagreed upon between the parties.\n \n(c) The rate of interest on deferred receivables should be such that taking into account\nthe cost of deferred credit in India the overall profitability is ensured.\n(d) Ordinarily, down payment together with advance  payment or mobilisation advance\nshould not be less than 15 per cent of the contract value.  In exceptional cases, this12may be reduced to 5 per cent of the contract value.  In the case of civil construction\ncontracts, it should not ordinarily be less than 5 per cent.\n(e) Down payments and deferred instalments receivable should be secured by a letter\nof credit/acceptable bank guarantee.  In case the overseas importer/project\nauthority is a Government department or a public sector undertaking, a guarantee\nfrom the foreign Government and /or a promissory note from the foreign Government\n/public sector undertaking will suffice.\n \n(f) As far as possible, turnkey projects and civil construction contracts should be self-\nfinancing.  However, bridge finance required for meeting temporary shortfalls in\nworking capital should not normally exceed 25 per cent of the contract value.\nHowever, authorised dealer / Exim Bank / Working Group may clear proposals\ninvolving bridge finance in excess of 25% of contract value also wherever they are\nsatisfied that such finance is necessary.\n \n(g) Ordinarily, deferred payment terms in respect of the services segment of a turnkey\ncontract may be offered only if the competitors of the exporter from other countries\nare known to have offered similar terms.  In such cases, other terms for the deferred\nreceivables towards services like period of credit, rate of interest and security\nshould be the same as offered for the supply portion of the contract.\nNote : Authorised dealer / Exim Bank  may relax conditions at (d) and (e) above, if\nnecessary, based on their commercial judgement.\nB.6 Cases where exporters desire to offer, due to local conditions, commercial credit\nnot exceeding one year in respect of goods specified in Annexure I may be considered by\nthe authorised dealers / Exim Bank as per powers delegated to them.\nPost-award Clearance of Proposals\nB.7 (i) Within fifteen days of entering into contract, the exporter should submit to his\nbankers an application in form DPX-1 (in respect of turnkey and deferred payment supply\ncontracts) or in form PEX-1 (in respect of civil construction contracts), as the case may be,\nin six copies along with six copies of the contract.  Authorised Dealers should deal\nexpeditiously with all applications made by exporters in connection with project exports. In\ncases where the proposal is within the powers delegated to him, authorised dealer may\ngrant post-award approval for the terms and conditions of the contract, provided the\ncontract basically satisfies the conditions laid down in para B.5. Copies of the approval\nletter along with copies of the application and the contract  may  be forwarded by the\nauthorised dealer to the office of the Reserve Bank of India (Exchange Control\nDepartment) within whose jurisdiction the Head Office of the exporter is situate, as also to\nECGC, Mumbai and Exim Bank where their participatory interest by way of funded / non-\nfunded facilities, insurance / risk cover, etc. is involved.13(ii) Authorised dealers / Exim Bank may grant post-award clearance to the\nproject proposal provided the value of the contract does not exceed U.S. Dollar 100 Million.\nIf the authorised dealer desires participation of Exim Bank in the financial arrangements\nand /or guarantee facilities, concurrence of Exim Bank should be obtained before granting\npost award clearance.  In case, the authorised dealer is unable for any reason to grant post\naward clearance, he should forward four copies of the application to Exim Bank for\nconsideration within two days indicating, inter alia, the extent upto which his bank would be\nprepared to take a share in the fund-based and /or non-fund based facilities required by\nthe exporter for execution of the overseas contract.  Exim Bank will consider project\nproposals for post-award clearance where the value of contract is upto U.S. Dollar 100\nMillion or such proposals as referred by authorised dealer.   Exim Bank may also receive\ndirectly applications for project export proposals of the value upto U.S. Dollar 100 Million,\nwithout being routed through an authorised dealer provided ( i) all facilities required for\nexecution of the project are being extended by Exim Bank, (ii) Exim Bank makes\nnecessary arrangement with an authorised dealer to handle exchange control matters like\nGR formality, etc. in connection with execution of the project and the details of the\narrangement  made in this regard are advised to the concerned Regional Office of\nExchange Control Department and (iii) Exim Bank monitors such projects cleared by them\ntill their completion and ensures compliance with the requirements of completed projects\nas per paragraph B.10 of Memorandum PEM.  In approved cases, Exim Bank will forward\na copy of its approval to the Regional Office of Exchange Control Department under whose\njurisdiction the applicant is functioning.  Proposals exceeding U.S. Dollar 100 Million in\nvalue will need to be considered by the Working Group.\n(iii) In all cases mentioned at (ii) above, authorised dealers/ Exim Bank have to\nconsult ECGC in advance if counter-guarantees of the Corporation are required and/or\ninsurance cover is desired to be obtained from it.  In cases where ECGC agrees to extend\ncounter-guarantees /insurance cover, the authorised dealer / Exim Bank should, while\ngranting clearance, advise the exporter that they will become effective only after the\nguarantee commission/ deposit premium as prescribed by the Corporation is paid to it.\n(iv) While according package approval, authorised dealers / Exim Bank should\nspecifically indicate in the approval letter, the terms of clearance giving, inter alia, the\nbreak-up of  contract value with details of Indian, third country and local supplies and\nservices, payment terms, currency of payment, rate of agency commission, amount of14overseas borrowings, funded and non-funded facilities with respective shares of different\nagencies therein, the value of plant, machinery, equipment etc. to be exported on reimport\nbasis and the extent of ECGC cover guarantee.\n(v) If there are any Indian sub-contractors, they should be advised by the prime\ncontractor to submit similar applications to the bankers of the prime contractor for\nobtaining approval for the portion of the contract entrusted to each sub-contractor. The\ninstitution which will consider the application of the prime contractor at the post-award\nstage will also clear applications of all the sub-contractors.\n(vi) In cases where the value of the contract proposal exceeds U.S. Dollar 100\nMillion, the authorised dealer should immediately forward copies of the application\ntogether with copies of the contract and Banker\u2019s comments in Form DPX 2/PEX 2 as the\ncase may be, to various institutions listed in paragraph B.7(i) as also to Central Office of\nReserve Bank of India, Exchange Control Department, Mumbai.  Exim Bank will convene a\nmeeting of the Working Group within a week of the receipt of the application to consider\nthe final terms and conditions of the contract and to grant a package post-award clearance\nfor the contract.  Copies of the letter of approval issued by Exim Bank will be forwarded to\nall members of the Working Group, concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India\nand exporter's bankers for necessary action.\n      (vii)    Payment terms approval to be conveyed will form part of package of approval\ngranted for the proposal by authorised dealer / Exim Bank /Working Group as the case\nmay be.\n(viii) Export of Goods (Pure Supply Contracts)\nThe procedure outlined in the preceding sub-paragraphs for post-award clearance will not\napply to exports of goods (pure supply contracts) where at least 90% of the export value will\nbe realised within the prescribed period i.e. six months from the date of export and the\nbalance amount within a maximum period of  two years from the date of export, provided\nthe exporter does not require/ avail of any funded or non-funded facility for such exports,\nfrom authorised dealers.\nAppointment of Sub-contractors\nB.8 In the case of large value contracts, applicant firms/companies normally take the\nassistance of other contractors.  In such cases the applicant firm/company will be treated\nas the prime contractor while other contractors will be treated as sub-contractors.  The15prime contractor will be accountable to the various authorities in India for compliance with\nthe requirements laid down by them and will at the same time be equally responsible to the\noverseas buyer for proper and timely completion of the contract.  The prime contractor\nshould accordingly enter into suitable inter se arrangement with the sub-contractors after\nsatisfying himself about the capacity and competence of the latter.  Credit reports on sub-\ncontractors and confirmation of financial arrangement proposed to be made by them in\nrespect of their portion of the contract should be obtained by the prime contractor from their\nbankers and furnished along with the application.  Overseas financial requirements of the\nsub-contractors will have to be met by the prime contractor.  Appointment of all sub-\ncontractors and / or any subsequent change in sub-contractors will require prior clearance\nof the concerned approving authority.\nFollow-up of Turnkey / Construction Contracts\nB.9 Exporters and all their Indian sub-contractors executing turnkey contracts or civil\nconstruction contracts abroad should furnish progress reports in form DPX 3 on a half-\nyearly basis (June and December )  to concerned approving authority viz. authorised dealer\n/ Exim Bank / Working Group as the case may be, and the concerned Regional Office of\nthe Reserve Bank through their bankers within one month from the date of expiry of the\nrelative half-year.  Copy of the report may however invariably be sent to ECGC / Exim Bank\nin all cases where their risk / guarantee cover participation in the funded / non-funded\nfacilities has been obtained.  However, in the case of project export proposals approved at\nthe level of the Working Group, report in Form DPX 3 may be sent to Exim Bank / ECGC\nand the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank.   The final Report  in Form DPX 3\nshould clearly indicate the fact of completion of the project and full compliance with the\nrequirements relating to completed projects as laid down in paragraph B.10.\nRequirements relating to Completed Projects\nB.10 (i) Exporters executing turnkey/construction contracts abroad should take the\nfollowing steps after completion of the  contracts:\n(a) close the foreign currency accounts and transfer the balances to India;\n \n(b) wind up site and liaison offices opened abroad;\n \n(c) ensure that the guarantees for performance of the contract and other guarantees\nissued are cancelled and returned to exporters;\n \n(d) liquidate fully overseas borrowings/overdrafts obtained, if any and cancel\ncounter-guarantees;\n \n(e) make suitable provision for payment of taxes, customs and other statutory\nobligations in the country of project;16(f) dispose of the equipment, machinery, vehicles, etc. purchased abroad and/or to\narrange their import into India.  [ In case the machinery etc. is to be used for\nanother overseas project, the market value (not less than book value) should be\nrecovered from the project to which equipment/machinery has been transferred ]\n \n(g) recover funds, if any, transferred to other overseas project/s and repatriate them\nto India.\n(ii) A report giving full account of the various steps taken should be sent by the\nexporter through his bankers to the concerned authorised dealer / Exim Bank as the case\nmay be depending upon the authority, which had granted post-award approval for the\nproject contract within one month from the completion of the project.  Such report should\nalso invariably be sent to Exim Bank / ECGC where their participation in funded / non-\nfunded facilities, risk sharing is involved.  Where the project export proposal was approved\nat the level of the Working Group, the report may be sent to Exim Bank and ECGC.  The\nfollowing documents should also be forwarded alongwith such report:\n(a) A completion or final handing over certificate\n \n(b) A certificate from the overseas bank regarding closure of the account held with\nit.\n(c) A statement of remittances made to India.  Bank certificates about repatriation\nof funds to India should be enclosed.\n \n(d) Tax clearance certificate/No tax liability certificate about the overseas project.\n \n(e) Bills of Entry for re-import of machinery, etc.\n \n(f) Statements of income and expenditure and profit and loss account of the project\nduly certified by a Chartered Accountant/Project Manager.\nBuyer\u2019s Credit Scheme of Exim Bank\nB.11 (i) Buyer\u2019s credit is extended under a scheme by Exim Bank known as \u2018Buyer\u2019s\nCredit Scheme\u2019 which envisages grant of credit by Exim Bank in participation with\ncommercial banks in India to foreign buyers in connection with export of capital goods and\nturnkey projects from India.  The Scheme provides for payments being made to exporters\nout of buyer\u2019s credit on a non-recourse basis on their fulfilling the commercial terms of the\nexport contracts to be financed under the Scheme.  All offers for deferred payment exports\nor turnkey projects against buyer\u2019s credit require specific prior approval of the Exim\nBank/Working Group.  Exim Bank has been authorised to extend Buyer\u2019s Credit under the\nScheme upto the limit of U.S. Dollar 20 Million and proposals exceeding this limit will be17considered by the Working Group.  The procedure for clearance of proposals as set out in\nparagraph  B.7 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to such proposals.  Exporters should not\nordinarily negotiate with overseas buyers credit terms requiring financing against buyer\u2019s\ncredits without prior consultation with their bankers and Exim Bank.  To assist Indian\nexporters in carrying out negotiations with importers, Exim Bank will be prepared to\nindicate its willingness, in principle, in suitable cases, to provide the credit.  The following\nprincipal factors will weigh with Exim Bank while considering proposals under the Buyer\u2019s\nCredit Scheme:\na) Competence and capability of the exporter in executing the proposed contract.\nb) Commercial justification for the contract\nc) Economic viability of the overseas project for which the credit is required to be\noffered.\nd) Creditworthiness, standing and financial position of foreign borrower and general\neconomic conditions of buyer\u2019s country.\n(ii) Since payments to exporters in India in respect of exports financed under\nbuyer\u2019s credit will be made on behalf of non-resident buyers, permission of Reserve Bank\nunder  Regulation 3 of Notification No. FEMA 3/2000-RB dated 3rd May 2000 [Foreign\nExchange Management (Borrowing or Lending in Foreign Exchange) Regulations, 2000 ]\nshould be obtained by banks in India before agreeing to extend buyer\u2019s credit to importers\nabroad.  The necessary applications for the purpose should be made by authorised\ndealers to Reserve Bank in form DPX 4 after the proposal is cleared in principle by the\nWorking Group.  Where two or more authorised dealers are participating with Exim Bank,\nthe application should be made by the principal participating bank (Process Agent).   The\nbanks are also required to comply with the instructions issued by Department of Banking\nOperations and Development, Reserve Bank of India in this regard from time to time.\n(iii) Since exporter will be receiving payments for the goods and services on a\nnon-recourse basis from the financing institutions in India, the exchange risk will fall on the\ninstitutions extending the credit.  To meet the situation, the exporter will either have to\nprovide in the contract itself for the exchange fluctuation risk to be borne by the importer or\nto bear the cost of the appropriate exchange risk cover to be taken by the financing\ninstitutions in India.  It will, however, be the responsibility of the financing bank to receive\nthe repayments of the loan and interest thereon from the overseas buyer.  The lending\ninstitution (Process Agent in the case of consortium credits) should, therefore, take\nnecessary steps to realise the instalments on due dates.  If for any reason, instalments are\nnot received on due dates, the institution concerned should promptly bring the matter to the18notice of Reserve Bank and Exim Bank indicating steps, if any, taken or proposed to be\ntaken to recover the instalments.19PART  C  -  EXPORT OF SERVICES\nGeneral\nC.1 (i) Contracts for export of consultancy, technical and other services by Indian\ncompanies/firms generally fall in the following categories:\n(a) Preparation of project/feasibility reports, drawings, designs, etc.\n(b) Supply of technical know-how/engineering services in different fields.\n(c) Operation, maintenance and supervision of manufacturing plants, buildings and\nstructures, etc.\n(d) Management contracts for commercial concerns.\nExport of services may also involve supply of some associated mechanical\nwherewithals, consumables and spares e.g. contractors may generally have to procure\ntools and instruments for their own personnel for performing their jobs.  They may\nsometimes be called upon to give performance guarantees but the scope of such\nguarantees would be limited to their own work, i.e. satisfactory performance of the\npersonnel provided and/or technical etc. services rendered.\n(ii) Indian exporters of services have normally to undertake overseas co ntracts\non \u201ccash\u201d terms.  Overseas service contracts undertaken on \u201ccash\u201d terms do not require\nprior clearance of Reserve Bank or the Working Group if no facilities are required.\nResident individuals, firms and companies may, therefore, freely provide\nconsultancy/technical/management services to overseas clients subject to the condition\nthat the income earned abroad minus expenses will be promptly repatriated to India\nthrough normal banking channels.  Individuals/firms/companies executing service contract\nin computer software should, however, repatriate to India income equivalent to atleast 30%\nof contract value and the balance income upto 70% of contract value could be retained for\nmeeting contract-related expenses abroad.  Indian companies/firms executing service\ncontracts abroad, requiring facilities like opening of foreign currency bank accounts and\nsite offices abroad, etc. will need approval from Authorised Dealer/Exim Bank/Working\nGroup at the post-award stage.  In the case of exporters executing software service\ncontracts abroad, authorised dealers may permit remittances towards maintenance\nexpenses of the persons deputed abroad to execute such contracts, out of receipts of\nadvance/down payments in respect of the contract from the overseas client and on\nsubmission of a declaration by the exporter that the aggregate exchange facilities already\navailed of / to be availed of for execution of the contract would be within the overall ceiling\nof project related expenses viz. 70% of the contract value.20Service Contracts Requiring Authorised Dealers\u2019/\nExim Bank\u2019s/Working Group\u2019s Approval\nC.2 In some cases service contractors may be required to furnish a performance\nguarantee to the overseas employer in respect of the project as a whole especially for\ncontracts in the field of erection/installation of plant and machinery as well as services like\nelectrical or air-conditioning installations associated with civil construction work.  Such\nservice contracts often involve high contract values and some are as complex in character\nas contracts for turnkey or civil construction projects.  They also involve direct and indirect\nforeign exchange liabilities by way of execution of performance/advance payments\nguarantees, counter-guarantees for loans/overdrafts raised from banks abroad and even\nconsiderable expenditure in foreign exchange on purchase of instruments/equipment of\nthird country origin, which necessitates recourse to fund-based and/or non-fund-based\nfacilities from Indian commercial banks, Exim Bank and ECGC apart from a variety of\nExchange Control approvals.  Such contracts are treated on par with turnkey/construction\nprojects and therefore require clearance at post-award stage of authorised dealers/Exim\nBank/Working Group depending on the value of contracts.  All Service contracts involving\ndeferred payment (DP) terms also require post-award clearance of authorised\ndealers/Exim Bank/Working Group depending on the value of the contract.\nPre-requisites for Consideration of Proposals of\nService Contracts Involving Cash Payment Terms\nC.3 Before granting clearance to the exporters who have secured Service Contracts\nabroad, authorised dealers/Exim Bank should ensure that the proposals satisfy, inter alia,\nthe following broad guidelines/conditions:\n(a) Contract should be technically feasible and economically viable.\n(b) Ordinarily, exporters should secure mobilisation advance to the extent of 15 per cent\nof the contract value.  Exporters should not undertake any responsibility for\norganising supplies of machinery/equipment and/or materials going into the project.\nIn case, contracts involve purchase of materials/machinery/equipments from third\ncountries, such purchases should be financed directly by employers.\n(c) ECGC may be consulted in advance for its commercial and/or political risk\ncover/guarantees etc., if required.\n(d) Ratio of the currencies of payment for the contract should be appropriately\nstipulated in order to avoid a surplus being generated in a non-repatriable local\ncurrency.21Note : Condition at (b) above regarding mobilisation advance may be relaxed by\nauthorised dealer / Exim Bank on merits of each case on the basis of their\ncommercial judgement.\nPre-requisites for consideration of proposals\nof Service Contracts on DP terms\nC.4 The periods for which credit may be offe red in respect of a service contract will\ndepend on merits of each individual case and may be determined by the exporter and his\nbanker in mutual consultation on the basis of commercial judgement.  The moratorium will\nbe available only for the principal amount and not interest and should not exceed one year.\nThe authorised dealers/ Exim Bank/Working Group will consider proposals for clearance of\nservice contracts abroad on DP terms at post-award stage subject, inter alia, to the\nfulfillment of the following conditions in addition to those at paragraph C.3(a), (c) & (d).\na) The rate of interest on deferred receivables should cover fully the cost to the exporter\nof export credit to be availed of from the Indian banking system.  Periodicity of\nrepayment of principal and payment of interest should not exceed half-yearly\nintervals.\n \nb) Ordinarily, payment terms should provide for advance payment upto 25 per cent of\nthe contract value.  In exceptional cases, the advance payment may be reduced to 5\nper cent of the contract value.  In any case advance/progress payment should cover\nfully the foreign exchange outgo as well as wages and salaries of personnel\nemployed on the project.\nc) Payment of instalments should be secured by letters of credit and/or acceptable\nbank guarantees.  In case the overseas employer is a Government department or a\npublic sector undertaking, a guarantee from the Government and/or promissory\nnotes from the Government or public sector undertaking concerned may be\naccepted.  An undertaking from the Central Bank of the importer country indicating\nthat necessary foreign exchange would be made available on due dates for\npayment of instalments including interest should be obtained, where stipulated by\nthe Working Group.\nd) If services of an agent are considered necessary for ensuring smooth execution of\nthe contract every effort should be made to keep the rate of agency commission as\nlow as possible.\nNote : Authorised dealer / Exim Bank may relax conditions at (b) and (c) above, if\nnecessary, based on their commercial judgement.22Clearance of Proposals at\nPost-award Stages\nC.5 (i) Within 15 days of entering into contract for rendering managerial, technical,\nconsultancy services to overseas employers ,  the exporter  should  submit to his bankers\nan application in form TCS 1  in six copies alongwith six copies of contract for necessary\npost-award clearance.  Where value of the contract is U.S. Dollar 100 Million or less\nauthorised dealers / Exim Bank should examine the proposals in the light of nature and\nscope of the services to be rendered, terms of payment, period available for completion of\nthe project/assignment, penalty provisions, etc. and grant clearance provided the proposal\nsatisfies the conditions listed in paragraphs C.3 / C.4.\n(ii) Exim Bank may also receive directly applications for export of services of the\nvalue upto U.S. Dollar 100 Million, without being routed through an authorised dealer\nprovided (i) all facilities required for execution of the contract are being extended by Exim\nBank, (ii) Exim Bank makes necessary arrangement with an authorised dealer to handle\nexchange control matters like GR formality, etc. in connection with execution of the contract\nand the details of the arrangement made in this regard are advised to the concerned\nRegional Office of Exchange Control Department and (iii) Exim Bank monitors such\ncontracts cleared by them till their completion and ensures compliance with the\nrequirements of completed contracts as per paragraph B.10 of Memorandum PEM.  In\napproved cases, Exim Bank will forward a copy of its approval to the Regional Office of\nExchange Control Department under whose jurisdiction the applicant is functioning.\n(iii) Proposals for values in excess of U.S. Dollar 100 Million are required to be\nreferred to the Working Group for clearance.  In the case of proposals exceeding the value\nof U.S. Dollar 100 Million, detailed comments and recommendations on the proposals may\nbe communicated by authorised dealers in form TCS 2 to Exim Bank.\n(iv) The procedure outli ned in paragraph B.7 in respect of project export\nproposals should be followed, mutatis mutandis, by authorised dealer/Exim Bank while\ngranting post-award clearance/ referring the proposals to Exim Bank/Working Group.\nFollow-up of Service Contracts23C.6 Exporters executing service contracts abroad should furnish progress reports at half\nyearly intervals ending June and December of each year  to institutions concerned in the\nsame manner as stated in paragraph B.9 through their bankers.\nRequirements relating to\nCompleted Projects\nC.7 Exporters should comply with the requirements laid down in paragraph B.10 in\nregard to submission of reports, statements and documentary evidence after completion of\nthe service contracts abroad.24PART  D   - OTHER MATTE RS CONNECTED WITH PROJECT\nEXPORTS AND SERVICE  EXPORTS\nForeign Currency Accounts/Site Offices Abroad/\nAgency Commission/Financial Requirements\nD.1 (i) Project/ Service exporters may avail of facilities such as opening of foreign\ncurrency accounts, temporary site offices, payment of agency commission and availing of\ntemporary overseas borrowings subject to the conditions as may be stipulated by the Exim\nBank on behalf of the Working Group on project exports or Exim Bank/authorised dealer\nunder the powers delegated to them.   The project exporters may also be permitted to open\ntemporary liaison offices overseas in connection with the execution of the contract abroad\nby the authority approving the relative project export proposal subject to the conditions as\nmay be specified by the said authority.  Exim Bank/authorised dealers may convey to the\nexporters, at the post-award stage, the detailed conditions subject to which the various\nfacilities have been granted by the authority  which grants the post award approval.  A set\nof standard conditions are given in Annexure II.  In the case of pure supply contracts on\ndeferred payment terms where the exporter does not maintain any foreign currency account\nabroad, authorised dealers may remit commission in accordance with the terms and\nconditions set out in the letter of approval issued by them/ Exim Bank at the post award\nstage subject to the conditions stipulated in Annexure III.  The exporter, if he so desires,\nmay maintain a single foreign currency account for more than one project being executed in\nthe same country subject to the conditions as may be stipulated by the authorised\ndealer/Exim Bank/Working Group.  It will, however, be necessary in such cases, for the\nexporter to submit project-wise statement of accounts duly certified by a Chartered\nAccountant to the project monitoring authority / authorised dealer.  Conditions mentioned at\nA(i) in Annexure II may be suitably amended by Authorised Dealer / Exim Bank in case the\nexporter desires to maintain a single foreign currency account for more than one project\nbeing executed in the same country.  It may be noted that even if the exporter opts for\nmaintaining a single foreign currency account for more than one project it will be necessary\nfor the exporter to comply with the instructions on inter-project transfer of funds.\nIt will be in order for the approving authority of the overseas contract i.e. Authorised Dealer\n/ Exim Bank / Working Group as the case may be, to approve, the proposal of exporter, to\nopen, hold and maintain foreign currency account in India subject to terms and conditions25indicated at A(ii) in the Annexure II.  The following will however need to be noted in this\nregard by the concerned Authorised dealer:\na) Exporter will have to open, hold and maintain separate foreign currency account\nfor each project under execution abroad.\nb) Authorised dealers shall not avail of rupee loan against the security of balances\nheld in such account and no overdraft in the account shall be permitted.\nc) The balance in the account will be subject to SLR / CRR requirement as\nprescribed by Reserve Bank ( DBOD) from time to time.\nApproving authority may on request allow such of the project / service exporters, as have\nbeen permitted to open foreign currency account in India, to pay their Indian suppliers /\nservice providers in foreign currency from foreign currency account subject to the following\nconditions :\na) Project / service exporter should not claim export benefit on the payment made\nto Indian supplier / service provider.\nb) Indian supplier of goods / services should comply with export procedure as per\nprovisions / requirements of Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.\n       (ii)    In cases where adequate advance payment or an overdraft/loan abroad cannot be\narranged, authorised dealer monitoring the project  on an application by the project\nexporter, may allow remittance from India provided such remittance has been approved by\nthe authorised dealer / Exim Bank / Working Group granting clearance to the project export\nproposal at the post award stage.  Authorised dealer may allow such remittances after\nobtaining an undertaking from the project exporter that the amount remitted will be\nrepatriated to India within a period stipulated by the authorised dealer / Exim Bank /\nWorking Group.  Compliance of the condition regarding repatriation of the funds so\nremitted within the period determined by the approving authority should be monitored by\nthe concerned authorised dealer who allows remittance and who is also required to\nmonitor the project.\n     It will be in order for authorised dealer / Exim Bank / Working Group while considering\nproposals at post award stage, against an undertaking to repatriate the amount of\nremittance, to approve initial remittance upto a limit deemed necessary on the basis of\ninflow / outflow of payments concerning the project, where adequate advance payment or\nan overdraft / loan abroad can not be arranged by the exporter.  The period of repatriation26of the amount sought to be remitted may also be determined by the authorised dealer /\nExim Bank / Working Group as the case may be.\nThird Country Purchases\nD.2 (i)  While granting package approval for turnkey/civil construction contracts involving\npurchase of machinery/equipment/materials from third country sources, the authorised\ndealer or Exim Bank will indicate the extent upto which such purchases may be made.\nOrdinarily, the third country purchases should be paid for separately by the overseas\nproject authority or by the Indian exporter out of advance/down payment received from the\nproject authority. Where the payments for the contract are receivable on deferred payment\nbasis, the exporter should, as far as possible, try to secure matching deferred payment\nterms in respect of third country purchases required for the project to avoid a net outlay of\nfunds in foreign exchange. Authorised dealers may, however, as far as possible open\nletters of credit in such cases in favour of the third country suppliers on a back-to-back\nbasis, provided the amount for which the credit is to be opened from India in favour of the\nthird country supplier does not exceed the amount for which a credit has been opened by\nthe project authority in favour of the Indian exporter.  Where however, the exporter is unable\nto provide security of a letter of credit opened by buyer, authorised dealer may open a\nletter of credit in favour of third country suppliers even if it is not on a back-to-back basis\nprovided the amount of such letter of credit does not exceed the value of third country\nimports approved by the approving authority while according post-award clearance to the\nproject export proposal and payments  under such letters of credits are made out of project\nreceipts.\n   (ii)   In respect of third country purchases by the exporter for execution of the project /\nservice contract abroad, which are directly transported by the overseas supplier to the\nproject site and for which payment is proposed to be made under letter of credit opened\nwith banks in India, authorised dealer on an application made by the exporter, may grant\nwaiver for submission of the exchange control copy of the bill of entry subject to the\nconditions that (a) the third country purchases have been approved by the concerned\napproving authority while according post-award approval to the project / service export\nproposal and (b) the exporter submits the invoice raised on him by the overseas supplier in\nrespect of the goods supplied by him direct to the project site as also documentary\nevidence for having received the goods at the project site.\nInter-project transfer of funds27D.3 Requests from the project exporters executing turn-key/construction/service\ncontracts abroad for temporary  inter-project transfer of funds to meet cash flow deficits\nshould be submitted to the exporter\u2019s banker monitoring the project, together with the cash-\nflow statements in respect of the borrowing and lending projects.  The authorised dealer\nmay consider the application on merits taking into account the overall funds-flow position of\nboth the projects and permit such temporary transfers.  In case the banker to the lending\nproject is other than the banker of the borrowing project, consent of the former should be\nobtained.  The exporter should be advised to retransfer the funds to the lending project as\nsoon as the funds-flow position of the borrowing project improves.  The transfer of surplus\nfunds of completed overseas project to another ongoing project of the same project\nexporter is not permitted since such surplus becomes repatriable to India as soon as the\nproject is completed and provisional completion certificate is issued.\nCopies of such applications, together with the approval accorded by the authorised\ndealer, should be forwarded to the approving authority which had cleared the project export\ncontract and the banker of the lending project.  Copies may also be forwarded to Exim\nBank / ECGC in all cases where their participation in funded / non-funded facilities, risk\nsharing is involved in the concerned project export contracts.  However, in the case of\nproject export proposals approved by the Working Group, copies of the application, etc.\nmay be forwarded to Exim Bank / ECGC.\nConstruction etc. Equipment\nD.4 (I) Exporters executing turnkey/ construction/ service contracts abroad should\nnormally take from India construction and other equipment required for performance of the\ncontracts.  Authorised dealer may permit, on application, export of equipment from India on\nthe condition that it will be re-imported into India on completion of the contract and if let out\n/sold, the full hire charges/sale proceeds will be promptly repatriated to India.  Applications\nmay be made to the authorised dealer by letter citing a reference to the post-award\npackage approval granted by authorised dealer/Exim Bank/Working Group and enclosing\na set of GR forms duly completed for the export together with an undertaking in form PEX-3\nregarding re-import of such equipment into India.  Requisite GR / SDF Form approval may\nbe granted by authorised dealer.  Authorised dealer will need to monitor the compliance of\nthe undertaking furnished by the exporter to him.28(ii) Exporters will also be permitted to purchase construction etc. equipment\nabroad, where necessary.  Approval will be given by approving authority, provided the\nequipment will be paid for fully out of payments to be received for the services segment of\nthe contract.  Full details of such purchases should be reported in the half-yearly statements\nof foreign currency accounts supported by documentary evidence.  Similarly, some\nexporters may be required to purchase abroad motor vehicles necessary for execution of\ntheir contract.  Requests for permission to purchase vehicles abroad will be considered by\nthe approving authority  on merits of each case.\n(iii) Exporters may also o btain construction etc. equipment abroad on hire\nagainst payment of hire charges out of foreign currency receipts in respect of service\nsegments of their contracts.\n(iv) Exporters may freely use the equipment for performing any other contract\nsecured by them in the same or any nearby country.  They may, if they so wish, also sell the\nequipment or give it on hire to other contractors abroad, provided the full amount of sale\nproceeds or hire charges, as the case may be, is repatriated to India promptly through\nnormal banking channels.  Documentary evidence showing repatriation of full amount\nrealised should be produced to the authorised dealer monitoring the project.\nImport of Equipment/Machinery/Motor\nVehicles Purchased Abroad\nD.5 Exporters may sometimes de sire to import the used equipment/machinery or motor\nvehicles into India after completion of the overseas contract unless they are disposed of\nabroad.  Import of such items into India will be governed by the prevailing Import Policy of\nGovernment of India.\nForeign Travel in connection with\nExecution of Contracts Abroad\nD.6 Firms/companies executing turnkey/construction/service contracts abroad have to\ndepute their technical and managerial personnel abroad for supervising construction,\nerection, commissioning of the projects, etc. Expenses of such personnel should ordinarily\nbe met out of payments receivable towards erection and commissioning services which\nare retained abroad in foreign currency accounts opened with permission of Authorised\nDealer/Exim Bank/Working Group, unless such expenses are to be met by the overseas\nemployers in terms of the contract.  Passage fares for sending such personnel abroad will\nalso have to be met in a similar manner.  Accordingly, wherever such fares are paid in India29in rupees, an equivalent amount in foreign exchange should be repatriated to India\npromptly.\nBid Bonds and Guarantees\nagainst Project Exports\nD.7 (i) Authorised dealers may consider and furnish, without prior permission of\nReserve Bank, all types of guarantees required to be furnished in connection with\nexecution of project/contract abroad, in cases where they have been authorised to approve\nproposals  of exporters to undertake contracts abroad.  Authorised dealer may also\nconsider/furnish bid bonds/tender guarantees in connection with bids/offers being\nsubmitted by exporters for execution of contracts abroad.  Authorised dealers should\nsatisfy themselves before furnishing the bond/ guarantee that the exporter is in a position to\nfulfil his contractual obligations and the bid/ contract satisfies the conditions stipulated in\nparagraph B.5/C.3/C.4. In other cases, authorised dealers should issue the guarantees\nafter package approval has been secured from Exim Bank either under powers delegated\nto it in this behalf or on behalf of the Working Group.\n        (ii)     Exporters desiring to submit bids for execution of projects abroad including\nservice contract may furnish their own Corporate Guarantee in lieu of Bid Bond Guarantee,\nif they so desire, subject to the condition that the amount of such guarantee shall not\nexceed 5% of the contract value.  Exporters, however, have to ensure that provisions\ncontained in Memorandum PEM and other instructions issued by Reserve Bank from time\nto time for submission of bids are complied with.\n(iii) In terms of Reserve Bank Notification No.FEMA 8/2000-RB dated 3rd\nMay 2000, project/service exporters, have been granted general permission to furnish their\nown Corporate guarantees for performance of the contract or for availing of fund-based\nand/or non-fund based facilities from banks/financial institutions abroad for the purpose of\nexecution of projects abroad subject to approval of approving authority at post award\nstage.   The details of guarantee/s issued as above should be reported by the project/\nservice exporters to the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank (ECD) as also to the\nconcerned authorised dealer/Exim Bank who had cleared the proposal and to all the\nmembers of the Working Group, where the proposal was cleared by Working Group, within\n15 days from the issue of such guarantee/s.\nGuarantees for Borrowings Abroad30D.8 In all cases where exporters executing turnkey/civil construction/service contracts\nabroad are granted an approval by the approving authority to raise foreign currency\nloans/overdrafts abroad against counter guarantees of their bankers in India, for bridging\ntemporary short-falls in the cash-flows, the authorised dealer concerned may issue the\nrequisite guarantee in favour of the overseas bank from which the loan/overdraft is to be\nraised.\nProject Exports to Nepal/Bhutan\nD.9 All project export proposals to Nepal and Bhutan require the clearance of the\nconcerned authorities like the authorised dealer /Exim Bank/Working Group on Project\nExports depending upon the value and other terms and conditions of the contract at post-\naward stage.  Provisions of para. D1( i ) regarding opening of foreign currency bank\naccount, temporary site office, liaison office and availing of temporary overseas\nborrowings etc.are applicable, mutatis mutandis, in respect of project exports to Nepal and\nBhutan.31ANNEXURE  -  I\n(Paragraph B.3)\nLIST OF GOODS IN RESPECT OF WHICH COMMERCIAL EXPORT CREDIT\nMAY BE OFFERED BY INDIAN EXPORTER\nA  - CAPITAL AND PRODUCER GOODS\n1.

Foreign Exchange Management (Export of Goods and\nServices) Regulations, 2000 in terms of which export of goods or services on deferred payment\nterms or in execution of a turnkey project or a civil construction contract requires prior approval\nof the approving authority, which shall consider the proposal in accordance with the guidelines\nissued by Reserve Bank from time to time.\n2.   With a view to simplifying and rationalising procedures, the Memorandum of Instructions on\nProject and Service Exports ( PEM) has been  revised.  A copy of the revised Memorandum is\nenclosed. The major changes incorporated in the revised Memorandum  are annexed .\n3.   Authorised Dealers may bring the revised guidelines in the Memorandum to the notice of\ntheir constituents concerned.\n4.   The directions c ontained in the Memorandum have been issued under Section 10(4) and\nSection 11(1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999).\nYours faithfully,\nGrace Koshie\nChief General Manager\nANNEXURE\n (A.P.(DIR Series) Circular No.32\ndated  October 28, 2003)\nMajor Changes incorporated in the Revised Memorandum of Instructions on Project and\nService Exports ( PEM)\nSr.N\no.Subject Matter Changes1. Limits for Clearance of\nProposals(i) Monetary limits for clearance of project\nexport contracts by the approving authority\nhave been denominated in USD. Uniform\nmonetary limit of USD 100 million has been\nprescribed for authorised dealers and Exim\nBank.  Project export contracts exceeding\nUSD 100 million will need to be cleared by\nthe Working Group.  Prior to this change,\nthese limits were Rs.50 crore for authorised\ndealers and Rs.200 crore for Exim Bank.\nProposals in excess of Rs.200 crore in value\nwere required to be cleared by the Working\nGroup.\n     (ii )    Monetary limits for clearance of service export\ncontracts have also been revised from Rs.5\ncrore for authorised dealers and Rs.10 crore\nfor Exim Bank to USD 100 million uniformly\nfor authorised dealers and Exim Bank.\nService export contracts exceeding USD 100\nmillion (revised from the present limit of\nRs.10 crore) will need to be cleared by the\nWorking Group.\n2. Buyer's Credit Scheme\nof Exim BankAuthorisation granted to Exim Bank to extend Buyer's\ncredit under its Buyer's Credit Scheme has been revised\nfrom Rs.50 crore to USD 20 million.\n3. Periods of Deferred\nCreditPeriod for which deferred credit may be offered by the\nexporter was linked to the value and type of the contract.\nThe period of deferred credit can now be determined by\nthe exporter and his banker in mutual consultation on\nmerits of each case and on the basis of their commercial\njudgement.  However, consumer durables and\nmiscellaneous engineering goods (Part B of the list in\nAnnexure I) should ordinarily continue to be exported on\n\"cash\" terms.\n4. Conditions necessary for\nclearance of proposals\nby authorised dealers /\nExim Bank.At present, proposals which deviate from the stipulated\nconditions regarding advance / down payment, type of\nsecurity for the contract etc. are referred to Exim Bank\nby authorised dealers and where necessary ,  by Exim\nBank to the Working Group.  Authorised dealers / Exim\nBank may now relax these conditions based on their\ncommercial judgement.\nProposals involving Bridge Finance in excess of 25 per\ncent of contract value can also be considered by the\napproving authority (viz. authorised dealer/ Exim\nBank/Working Group). Exporters were earlier required to\napproach Reserve Bank for approval in such cases.5. Export of Consumables Powers to grant permission to project exporters to export\nconsumables and raise invoices on their own site offices\nhave been delegated to authorised dealers subject to\ncertain conditions.  Hitherto, exporters were required to\napproach Reserve Bank for such permission.\n6. Liaison Office At present, number of liaison offices which can be\nopened by the exporter is restricted to one in a country\nwhere more than one project export contract is executed.\nThis restriction has been removed. Exporters can now be\npermitted by the approving authority viz. authorised\ndealer/ Exim Bank/Working Group to open more than one\nliaison office in one country, if required.\n7. Initial Remittance Remittance for meeting initial / mobilisation  expenses\nfrom India in the absence of adequate advance payment\nor an overdraft / loan arrangement abroad by the exporter\nrequired approval of Reserve Bank where the amount of\nremittance exceeded 5 per cent of contract value and / or\nperiod of repatriation of such amount to India exceeded\none year from the date of such remittance.\nApproving authority viz. authorised dealer/ Exim\nBank/Working Group can now allow such remittance\neven if it exceeds 5 per cent of the contract value on the\nbasis of cash flow position of the project / service export\nproposal.  The period of repatriation can also be\ndetermined by the approving authority.  Concerned\nexporter will however, be required to submit an\nundertaking to the authorised dealer to repatriate the\namount within the period determined by the approving\nauthority.  Fulfilment of the undertaking by the exporter\nwill need to be monitored by the authorised dealer who\nallows remittance and he is also required to monitor the\nproject.\n8. Third Country Purchases Authorised dealers could open letters of credit in India in\nfavour of third country suppliers provided they were on\nback-to-back basis.  Availability of letters of credit\nopened by foreign client in favour of the Indian exporters\nwith similar terms and conditions need not be insisted\nupon.  However, the amount of such letter of credit\nshould not exceed the value of third country imports\napproved by the approving authority while according\npost award clearance to the project export proposal and\npayment under such letters of credit should be made from\nout of the project receipts.\nAuthorised dealers can now grant waiver for submission\nof the exchange control copy of the bill of entry subject\nto certain conditions where third country purchases are\ndirectly transported by the overseas supplier to theproject site and for which payment is made under letter\nof credit opened in India. Exporters were earlier required\nto approach Reserve Bank for grant of such waiver.\n9. Export of Equipment on\nRe-import BasisExport of equipment on re-import basis was being\nallowed by Reserve Bank and necessary GR approval\nwas being accorded.  Exporter was required to submit an\nundertaking that he will re-import the equipment or if\nsold abroad, repatriate the sale proceeds.  The exporter\nwill now be required to make an application to the\nauthorised dealer for permission, citing a reference to the\npost award approval granted by the approving authority.\nHe will submit the undertaking to the authorised dealer.\nRequisite GR/SDF Form approval may be granted by\nauthorised dealer.  Fulfilment of the undertaking by the\nexporter will need to be monitored by the authorised\ndealer.\n10. Intimation Regarding\nApproval of the ContractCopies of approval letters in respect of Project and\nService Export contracts cleared by authorised dealers\nwere required to be forwarded by the concerned\nauthorised dealer to the concerned Regional Office of\nReserve Bank and all the members of the Working\nGroup.\nCopies of such approvals may henceforth be sent to the\nRegional Office of Reserve Bank and in addition, to\nExim Bank and ECGC only if their participatory interest\nby way of funded / non-funded facilities, insurance / risk\ncover, etc. is involved.\n11.

Such report may now be sent to the authority\napproving the project export contract and the concerned\nRegional Office of Reserve Bank.  It will however, be\nnecessary to forward the report  to Exim Bank / ECGC\nalso in all cases where their financial / non-financial\nassistance / risk cover has been obtained.

These guidelines cover banks\u2019 investments in Non- SLR debt instruments /\nsecurities issued by corporates, banks, FIs and State and Central Government\nsponsored institutions, SPVs etc. The guidelines will apply to investments both in\nthe primary market as well as the secondary market.  It may be noted that banks\nshould not invest in Non-SLR debt securities of original maturity of less than one-\nyear other than Commercial Paper and Certificates of Deposits which are covered\nunder RBI guidelines .\n2. Definitions of a few terms used in these guidelines have been furnished in\nAppendix I with a view to ensure uniformity in approach while implementing the\nguidelines.\nRegulatory requirements\n3. Banks should undertake usual due diligence in respect of investments in non-SLR\nsecurities. Present RBI regulations preclude banks from extending credit facilities\nfor certain purposes.  Banks should ensure that such activities are not financed by\nway of funds raised through the non-SLR securities.\n4. Banks must not invest in unrated debt securities.\n5. The Securities Exchange Board of India ( SEBI) vide their circular dated\nSeptember 30, 2003 have stipulated requirements that listed companies are\nrequired to comply with for making issue of debt securities on a private placement\nbasis and listed on a stock exchange. According to this circular any listed\ncompany, making issue of debt securities on a private placement basis and listed\non a stock exchange, has to make full disclosures (initial and continuing) in the\nmanner prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act 1956, SEBI (Disclosure\nand Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 and the Listing Agreement with the\nexchanges. Furthermore, the debt securities shall carry a credit rating of not less\nthan investment grade from a Credit Rating Agency registered with the SEBI.\nBanks should ensure that they make all fresh Non-SLR debt investments only in2\nlisted debt securities of companies which comply with the requirements of the\nSEBI circular dated September 30, 2003, except to the extent indicated in\nparagraph 6 below.\n6. The unlisted non- SLR debt securities in which banks may invest up to the limits\nspecified in paragraph 8 below, should be rated and disclosure requirements as\nprescribed by the SEBI for listed companies should be followed by the issuer\ncompany.\nInternal assessments\n7.  Since non- SLR securities are mostly in the form of credit substitutes, banks were\nadvised in June 2001 to ( i) subject all their investment proposals relating to non-\nSLR securities to credit appraisal on par with their credit proposals, irrespective of\nthe fact that the proposed investments may be in rated securities, (ii) make their\nown internal credit analysis and rating even in respect of rated issues and that\nthey should not entirely rely on the ratings of external agencies, and (iii)\nstrengthen their internal rating systems which should also include building up of a\nsystem of regular (quarterly or half-yearly) tracking of the financial position of the\nissuer with a view to ensuring continuous monitoring of the rating migration of the\nissuers/issues.\nFixing of prudential limits\n8.  The Board of Directors of banks should fix a prudential limit for their total investment\nin non- SLR securities and sub-limits for the following debt securities:\na) unlisted securities and\nb) securities issued by SPVs for Mortgage Backed Securities ( MBS) and\nsecuritisation papers issued for infrastructure projects.\nThe total investment in (a) and (b) above should not exceed 20 per cent of the\nbanks total non-SLR investment as on March 31, of the previous year, with a sub-\nceiling of 10 per cent for investments covered under (a).\n9. Banks which have exposure to investments in non-SLR securities in excess of the\nprudential limit prescribed above as on 31st March 2003 should not make any3\nfresh investment in such securities till they ensure compliance with the above\nprudential limit.\n10.As a matter of prudence, banks should stipulate entry-level minimum ratings/\nquality standards and industry-wise, maturity-wise, duration-wise, issuer-wise etc.\nlimits to mitigate the adverse impacts of concentration and the risk of illiquidity.\nRole of Boards\n11.Banks should ensure that their investment policies duly approved by the Board of\nDirectors are formulated after taking into account all the relevant issues specified\nin these guidelines on non-SLR investment. Banks should put in place proper risk\nmanagement systems for capturing and analysing the risk in respect of non-SLR\ninvestment and taking remedial measures in time. Banks should also put in place\nappropriate systems to ensure that investment in privately placed instruments is\nmade in accordance with the systems and procedures prescribed under respective\nbank\u2019s investment policy.\n12.The Board should devise a system to ensure that the limits prescribed in\nparagraphs 8 and 9 above are scrupulously complied.  The Boards should\nappropriately address the issue of ensuring compliance with the prudential limits\non an ongoing basis, including breaches, if any, due to rating migration.\n13. Boards of banks should review the following aspects of non-SLR investment twice\na year:\na) Total business (investment and divestment) during the reporting period\nb) Compliance with the prudential limits prescribed by the Board for non-SLR\ninvestment\nc) Rating migration of the issuers/ issues held in the bank\u2019s books and\nconsequent diminution in the portfolio quality\nd) Extent of non performing investments in the non-SLR category\nDisclosures\n14. In order to help in the creation of a central database on private placement of debt,\na copy of all offer documents should be filed with the Credit Information Bureau\n(India) Ltd. ( CIBIL) by the investing banks. When banks themselves raise debt4\nthrough private placement, they should also file a copy of the offer document with\nCIBIL. Further, any default relating to interest/ instalment in respect of any\nprivately placed debt should also be reported to CIBIL by the investing banks\nalong with a copy of the offer document.\n15. Banks should disclose the details of the issuer composition of non-SLR\ninvestments and the non-performing non-SLR investments in the \u2018Notes on\nAccounts\u2019 of the balance sheet, as indicated in Appendix II.\nTrading and settlement in debt securities\n16. As per the SEBI guidelines, all trades with the exception of the spot transactions, in\na listed debt security, shall be executed only on the trading platform of a stock\nexchange. In addition to complying with the SEBI guidelines, banks should ensure\nthat all spot transactions in listed and unlisted debt securities are reported on the\nNDS and settled through the CCIL from a date to be notified by RBI.\n*********Appendix I\nGuidelines on investments by banks in non- SLR\ninvestment portfolio by banks \u2013 Definitions\n(Vide para 2 of the Guidelines)\n1.

The investment grade ratings  awarded by each of the external rating\nagencies operating in India would be identified by the IBA/ FIMMDA. These would\nalso be reviewed by IBA/ FIMMDA at least once a year.\n4. A \u2018listed\u2019 debt security is a security which is listed in a stock exchange.  If not\nso, it is an \u2018unlisted\u2019 debt security.2\n5. A non performing investment  (NPI), similar to a non performing advance\n(NPA), is one where\ni) Interest/ instalment (including maturity proceeds) is due and remains\nunpaid for more than 180 days. The delinquency period would\nbecome 90 days with effect from 31st March 2004.\nii) The above would apply mutatis-mutandis to preference shares\nwhere the fixed dividend is not paid.\niii) In the case of equity shares, in the event the investment in the\nshares of any company is valued at Re.1 per company on account of\nthe non availability of the latest balance sheet in accordance with the\ninstructions contained in para 28 of the Annexure to circular\nDBOD.BP.BC.32/ 21.04.048/ 2000-01 dated October 16, 2000,\nthose equity shares would also be reckoned as NPI.\niv) If any credit facility availed by the issuer is NPA in the books of the\nbank, investment in any of the securities issued by the same issuer\nwould also be treated as NPI.3\nAppendix II\nPrudential guidelines on management of the non-SLR\ninvestment portfolio by banks \u2013 Disclosures requirements\n(vide para 15 of the Guidelines)\nBanks should make the following disclosures in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 of the\nbalance sheet in respect of their non-SLR investment portfolio, with effect from the\nfinancial year ending 31 March 2004.\ni) Issuer composition of Non SLR investments\n(Rs. in crore)\nNo.\n(1)Issuer\n(2)Amount\n(3)Extent of\nprivate\nplacement\n(4)Extent of\n\u2018below\ninvestment\ngrade\u2019\nSecurities\nalready\ninvested\n(5)Extent of\n\u2018unrated\u2019\nsecurities,\nalready\ninvested\n(6)Extent of\n\u2018unlisted\u2019\nsecurities\n(7)\n1 PSUs\n2 FIs\n3 Banks\n4 Private corporates\n5 Subsidiaries/ Joint ventures\n6 Others\n7 Provision held towards\ndepreciationX X X X X X X X X X X X\nTotal  *\nNOTE:  1.  * Total under column 3 should tally with the total of investments\nincluded under the following categories in Schedule 8 to the balance\nsheet:\na.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of Government\nsecurities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d basis in select  auctions of\ndated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-competitive bids up to 5 percent  of\nthe notified amount will be accepted in the auctions of dated securities. The reserved amount\nwill be within the notified amount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated GOI\nsecurities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL) account\nwith the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions:  Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks shall be covered under\nthis Scheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single bid for an amount not more than Rs. two crore (face value) per auction\n3. submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks that   maintain SGL\naccount and current account with the Reserve Bank of India shall be eligible to submit their\nnon competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI. The\nminimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in multiples in\nRs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent subsidiary\ngeneral ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish to participate.\nHowever, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An undertaking to the\neffect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be obtained and kept on record\nby the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name,\namount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on the\ndate of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from their clients.4. In case the aggregate amount of bid i s more than the reserved amount (5% of notified\namount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be the\nresponsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a\ntransparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the\nshortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the main\nSGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The facility for\naffording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing investors who\nare not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate clearly at the time\nof tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be credited to their SGL\naccount and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the main SGL account is\npermissible at the instance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the ban k or the PD to pass on the securities to their\nclients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients shall be\ncompleted within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such costs\nmay be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case the transfer of\nsecurities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the consideration amount\npayable by the client to the bank or PD would also include accrued interest from the date of\nissue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities, accrued\ninterest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be worked out\nby the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that no other costs such\nas funding costs should be built into the price or recovered from the client.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to operations under the\nScheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for from time to time within\nthe time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the B ank and accordingly, if and\nwhen considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/39541.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 14, 2003", "info": "Tender for Non-competitive Bids\n(Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding Facility in Auctions of Government Securities)\n                                                         Annexure I (a)\n                                                         For office use only\nThe Regional Director,                     |------------------|\nReserve Bank of India,                     | Regn no.          |\nPublic Debt Office,                        |                  |\nFort,                                      |------------------|\nMumbai - 400 001.\nDear Sir,\nTender for Non-competitive Bids for \u201c5.69 per cent Government\nStock 2018\u201d for an aggregate amount of Rs.250 crore: Auction to\nbe held on October 21, 2003.\n    \n        Pursuant to Government of India, Ministry of Finance,\nDepartment of Economic Affairs Notification No F.No.4(8)\nW&M/2003 dated October 14, 2003  and the tender notice issued by\nyou, I/we, the undersigned hereby submit an aggregated bid on\nbehalf of the non-competitive bidders as per the enclosed list\nin pursuance of the \u2018 Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding\nFacility in the Auctions of Government Securities\u2019 at the\nauction to be held by you on the captioned date as set out\nbelow:\ni)   Name  of the Bank/Primary Dealer  /-------------------\\\nii)   Address                          /-------------------\\\niii)  Telephone No.                    \\-------------------/\niv)\nUnde\nrtak\ning\n1. \nO\nn\n your acceptance of my/our bid,\ni) I/we agree/undertake to immediately collect the letter of\nacceptance from your office and to deposit the requisite\namount at Reserve Bank of India, Fort, Mumbai on the\nday/time as indicated therein.\nii) I/We authorise you to debit my/our Current account\nmaintained with Reserve Bank of India with the requisite\namount.\n2.

AREA OF OPERATION\n1.1 Introduction\n1.1.1 The area of operation of a primary (urban) co-operative bank confines to the\ngeographical area/s as per its by-laws, approved by the registering authority .For any\nrevision in its area of operation, a primary (urban) co-operative bank is required to\namend its by-law relating to area of operation by passing a resolution at the general\nbody meeting and getting the amended by-law registered with the Registrar of Co-\noperative Societies. The banks are required to seek prior permission (no objection\ncertificate) of Reserve Bank of India for such revision, where applicable, as per the\nextant instructions.\n1.2 Regulatory Requirements\n1.2.1 Extension of Area of Operation within the district of registration and adjoining\ndistricts within the state of registration :\n1.2.1.1  Licensed primary (urban) co-operative banks, not classified as Grade II, III or IV by\nthe Reserve Bank of India, may extend their area of operation to the whole of the\ndistrict of registration and to its adjoining districts within their State of registration,\nwithout prior permission of Reserve Bank of India.\n1.2.1.2  Accordingly, eligible banks need not approach Reserve Bank for seeking \u2018no\nobjection\u2019 for extension of area of operation as stated above. Such banks may directly\napproach Registrar of Co-operative Societies of the concerned State for extension of\narea of operation to the entire district of registration and its adjoining districts within\nthe State of registration.\n1.2.2 Extension of Area of Operation beyond the adjoining   districts\n A licensed primary (urban) co-operative bank not classified as Grade II, III or IV and\ndesirous of extending its area of operation beyond adjoining districts to its district of\nregistration but within the state may do so with prior permission of Reserve Bank,\nsubject to complying with the following norms:\n1.2.2.1  Its own funds (share capital + free reserves) should not be less than the entry point\ncapital norms prescribed for the highest category centre in that district(s), for\norganising a new general category multi-branch bank as indicated in Annexure 1.\n1.2.2.2  It should have achieved prescribed targets for priority sector lending.\n21.2.2.3  Its net NPAs should be less than 10% of its net loans and advances and it should\nhave made full provisions as prescribed by RBI.\n1.2.2.4  It should have posted net profits during the preceding 2 years.\n1.2.2.5  It should have complied with the RBI regulatory framework, such as compliance\nwith CRR/SLR requirements, timely submission of prescribed returns/statements\nand satisfactory compliance with RBI Inspection findings, etc.\n1.2.3 Extension of Area of Operation beyond the state of registration\n1.2.3.1  A licensed primary (urban) co-operative bank, not classified as Grade II, III or IV,\nwith the prior approval of Reserve Bank, may extend its area of operation beyond\nthe state of registration, provided its owned funds are not less than Rs. 50 crore and\nit complies with norms stipulated in paragraph 1.2.2 above.\n1.2.3.2  Primary (urban) co-operative banks satisfying the above mentioned norms and\ndesirous of extending their area of operation beyond the adjoining districts or\nbeyond the State of registration may approach the concerned Regional Office for\nnecessary prior approval.\n1.2.3.3  The by-law of the bank relating to area of operation may be amended as under:\n\"The area of operation of the bank shall be ..................................\u201d For any revision\nin this regard, prior approval of registering authority will be obtained. In addition,\nprior approval of the Reserve Bank of India, where necessary as per the prevalent\nguidelines will also be obtained.\n2. BRANCH LICENSING POLICY\n2.1 Basic Approach\nReserve Bank of India had reviewed the branch licensing policy based on the\nrecommendations made by the High Power Committee on Urban Co-operative Banks\nconstituted under the Chairmanship of Shri K. Madhava Rao.  This has been further\nmodified in the light of the introduction of the norms for the classification of banks in\nGrades I/II/III/IV.  The present policy is given in the following paragraphs:\n2.2 Licensing Policy\n2.2.1 Eligibility Criteria\nLicensed primary (urban) co-operative banks, which are not classified in Grade\nII/III/IV by the Reserve Bank of India, may apply for allotment of centres under the\nAnnual Action Plan (AAP) to the concerned Regional Office of the Urban Banks\nDepartment, under whose jurisdiction they fall.  The Annual Action Plan will be for a\nperiod of twelve months beginning 1st April of the year.  Before applying for allotment\nof centres, the  banks should ensure that they satisfy the following criteria:\n32.2.1.1  The Capital to Risk Asset Ratio (CRAR) of banks should not be less than that\nprescribed by RBI from time to time.\n2.2.1.2  Banks should have posted net profits during each of the preceding 2 years.\n2.2.1.3  Their net NPAs should be less than 10% of their net loans and advances   as on the\nlast balance sheet date and they should have made requisite provisions as per RBI\nguidelines.\n2.2.1.4  Banks should have achieved the target prescribed by RBI for priority sector\nadvances.\n2.2.1.5  Banks should have demonstrated track record of compliance with provisions of B.R.\nAct, 1949 (AACS), RBI Act, 1934 and the instructions/directions issued by RBI from\ntime to time.  They should maintain requisite level of CRR and SLR and also ensure\ntimely submission of statutory and other returns.\n2.2.1.6 Banks which have been organised as unit banks and have been extended relaxation in\nthe entry point capital as indicated in Annexure 1, would be eligible to open branches\nonly after augmenting their own funds to the level required for opening a new general\ncategory bank at the place where the bank was organised or where the branch is desired\nto be opened, whichever is higher.  For instance, if a unit bank was organised at\ncategory \u2018D\u2019 centre and it intends to open a branch at \u2018B\u2019 category centre, such bank\u2019s\nowned funds should necessarily be raised to entry point capital prescribed for \u2018B\u2019\ncategory centre.\n2.2.1.7 Similarly if a bank, other than a unit bank, desires to open a branch at a higher\ncategory centre than the centre at which it was established within the district of its\nregistration, the owned funds of the bank should at least be equivalent to the entry point\ncapital prescribed for that centre.  Illustratively, if a bank situated at \u2018C\u2019 category centre\nintends to open a branch at \u2018B\u2019 category centre, in the same district, its owned funds\nshould be equivalent to the entry point capital prescribed for \u2018B\u2019 category centre.\n2.2.1.8  Further, a primary (urban) co-operative bank which desires to open a branch at a\ncentre other than its district of registration but within the State of registration, must\nhave owned funds not less than the entry point capital applicable for organisation of a\nnew general category primary (urban) co-operative bank at the highest category centre\nin that State.  Illustratively, if a bank registered in district \u2018X\u2019 desires to open a branch\nin district \u2018Y\u2019 within the State of registration, then its owned funds should not be less\nthan the entry point capital applicable for highest category centre in the state.\n2.2.2 Process of Selecting Centres\nPrimary (urban) co-operative banks, which satisfy the norms indicated above, may\nprepare Annual Action Plans for opening of new branches/upgradation of extension\ncounters into full-fledged branches for next 12 months, with the approval of their Board\nof Directors. They should submit two copies of their A.A.P. along with information in\nAnnexure 2,3 and 4 enclosed to this circular, to the Regional Office under whose\njurisdiction they function. Annexure 4 indicating classification of assets and provisions\nmade against non-performing assets should be duly certified by statutory auditor or\nchartered accountant under his seal and date.\n42.2.2.1 Where the banks have opened extension counters without complying with the\nprescribed norms and subsequently approach Reserve Bank of India for upgradation of\nthe same into full-fledged branches, such banks would not be allotted centres unless\nthey close unauthorised extension counters. Further, a centre where a bank has opened\nan unauthorised extension counter, such a centre would not be considered for opening a\nbranch in future.\n2.2.2.2 Scheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks which comply with the eligibility\nnorms indicated at paragraph 2.2.1 above, may open mobile/satellite offices. Such of\nthe scheduled banks which desire to open mobile/satellite offices may indicate the same\nin the format as per Annexure 3 enclosed to this circular along with other centres where\nthey intend to open branches.\n2.2.2.3 The banks need not indicate the exact address of the proposed branch in the Annual\nAction Plan but only indicate the name of the town/city within their area of operation,\nin the order of their preference, where they desire to open branches. Banks should\nchoose the centres at which they wish to open branches after careful consideration of\nbusiness potential and availability of premises at such centres.\n2.2.2.4 All centres where a bank desires to open branches under the AAP should be indicated\nin a format as per Annexure 3 enclosed to this circular, and only one application need\nto be sent. The banks should not submit statements/annexures, which are not\nrequired/called for, but submit only the requisite information/data, along with a\ncertified copy of the latest audited balance sheet (as of 31 March) or a copy of the\npublished Annual Report of the bank.\n2.2.3 Approval for Centres\nThe banks which comply with the prescribed norms will be allotted centres strictly in\nthe order of preference given by them. Once a centre is allotted, no request for change\nin the allotted centre would be entertained.\n2.2.4 Issue of Licence and its Validity Period\n2.2.4.1 After making arrangements for opening of branches, the bank should approach the\nconcerned Regional Offices of Urban Banks Department under whose jurisdiction they\noperate, in the prescribed Form V, indicating the exact postal address of the place\nwhere the branch is to be opened, for issuance of licence within a period of 6 months\nfrom the date of allotment of the centre.\n2.2.4.2 The Regional Offices will issue licence without making any reference to the Central\nOffice, unless in the meantime, some serious deterioration has taken place in the\nworking of the bank.\n2.2.4.3  Licence will be valid for one year from the date of issue, and a one and half year\nfrom the date of allotment of the centre, which ever is earlier.\n2.2.4.4 Ordinarily, no extension of time will be granted after the expiry of validity period of\nlicence. Only in exceptional cases, where the bank is unable to open the branch for\nreasons beyond its control, an extension of time not exceeding six months may be\ngranted by the Regional Offices, under advice to Central Office.\n2.2.5 Under no circumstances, should a bank open a branch without obtaining branch\nlicence from the concerned Regional Office of the Department. Opening a branch\n5without obtaining licence is the violation of Section 23 of the Banking Regulation Act,\n1949 (AACS), and may attract penalties.\n2.2.6  In case, the information/particulars furnished are found to be incorrect, the Reserve\nBank of India will take a serious view in the matter and the bank will be liable for penal\naction, including debarring it from allotment of centres for the period of 3 years.\n2.3     Procedural Guidelines for Permission to Open Branches\nThe Primary (urban) co-operative bank should ensure that there are no restrictions\nimposed by the local Development or other Authorities for setting up commercial\nestablishment in the locality where the branch is proposed to be opened.\n3 OPENING/UPGRADATION OF EXTENSION COUNTERS\n3.1 Review\nThe existing policy for opening of extension counters by primary (urban) co-operative\nbanks has been reviewed by the High Power Committee (HPC) constituted by Reserve\nBank of India in 1999. Subsequently, Reserve Bank has reviewed the policy.  The\ncurrent policy relating to opening of Extension Counters (ECs) by banks is set out\nbelow.\n3.2 Policy Approach\n3.2.1 Licensed primary (urban) co-operative banks  which are not classified as Grade\nII/III/IV by the Reserve Bank of India, and satisfy the norms indicated in para 3.3 are\neligible to open extension counters.\n3.2.2 Scheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks, which fulfil the norms laid down in\nparagraph 3.3 below can open ECs, without prior permission of RBI (except while\nopening of ECs in the residential colonies). However, such banks should approach the\nconcerned Regional Office with an application as per format given in a nnexure\nenclosed to our circular UBD.BL (PCB) No.46/07.01.00/2000-01 dated 26 April 2001\nfor post facto  approval, within one month from the date of opening of ECs. The EC will\nbe treated as authorised / regularised only when post-facto approval is accorded by the\nconcerned Regional Office of this Department or the EC has been opened with prior\npermission of the Reserve Bank of India.\n3.2.3 Non-scheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks are required to obtain prior\npermission of RBI before opening an EC. Such of the non-scheduled banks which fulfil\nthe norms stipulated at para 3.3 below may approach the concerned Regional  Office of\nthe UBD, RBI, under whose jurisdiction their Registered Office is located, with an\napplication as per annexure enclosed to our circular UBD.BL (PCB) Cir.No. 46/\n07.01.00/ 2000-01 dated 26 April 2001 for seeking prior permission to open ECs.\n3.2.4 Such of the banks which open ECs, without seeking prior permission from RBI will\nhave to close down the same and these would not be considered for\nregularisation/upgradation into full-fledged branch(es).\n63.3 Eligibility Norms for Opening of Extension Counters\nExtension Counters may be opened (non-scheduled banks have to obtain prior\napproval) within the premises of educational institutions, big offices, factories and\nhospitals of which the concerned urban co-operative bank is the principal banker.\nRequest from other banks to the institution may be considered, only if opening of an\nEC is not considered feasible by the principal banker and/or its base branch is beyond\n10 kms from the EC, after obtaining written consent from principal bank. ECs may also\nbe opened in the residential colonies provided no other branch/EC is already existing in\nthe colony. However, both scheduled as well as non-scheduled banks  are required to\ntake prior approval from RBI for opening an EC in residential colonies. No extension\ncounter should be opened in market place, shopping centre, etc.\nA primary (urban) co-operative bank, which desires to open ECs should comply with\nthe following norms:\n3.3.1 Only one EC is permitted within the premises of any institution / office / hospital or in\na residential colony.\n3.3.2 The base branch of the bank to which the proposed extension counter is linked should\nbe within a distance of 10 kms. to facilitate incorporation of transactions of EC in the\naccounts of the base branch on a day-to-day basis.\n3.3.3 Before opening an extension counter, the bank should take into account important\nfactors such as need, viability and overall merits of opening of the EC.\n3.3.4 Capital to Risk Assets Ratio (CRAR) of the bank should not be less than that\nprescribed by RBI.\n3.3.5 The owned funds of the bank should not be less than the minimum required for\nopening of a new branch at the centre where the proposed EC is to be opened.\n3.3.6 The level of net NPAs of the bank should be less than 10% of its net loans and\nadvances outstanding as on 31 March of the latest financial year and the bank should\nhave made full provisions as per RBI norms.\n3.3.7 The bank should have achieved the target prescribed by Reserve Bank of India for\npriority sector lending.\n3.3.8 The bank should have made net profits in each of the two preceding years.\n3.3.9 The bank should have complied with SLR/CRR requirements on a continuous basis,\nshould not have violated RBI guidelines and should also have submitted statutory and\nother returns to RBI in time.\n3.3.10 ECs should not be opened merely for collection of fees, payment of bills for\nelectricity, water, telephones, etc. as it is primarily the responsibility of the concerned\ninstitution.\n3.3.11 The facilities at an extension counter should be restricted to acceptance of deposits;\nissue and encashment of drafts and mail transfers; encashment of travellers' cheques;\nand collection of bills.\n73.4      Safe-Deposit Lockers Facility At Extension Counters:\n3.4.1 Primary (urban) co-operative  banks (scheduled  as   well  as  non-scheduled)  desirous\nof  providing  safe    deposit  locker  facility  at  their  extension  counters  and\nfulfilling the  under  noted  norms  will be eligible to  approach  the  concerned\nRegional  Office  of  Urban Banks Department under  whose   jurisdiction   they\nfunction,  for  prior approval  in  this regard, the grant of  which  would be considered\non the merit of  each case.\n3.4.1.1 The bank should have complied with the prescribed capital adequacy norms.\n3.4.1.2 The bank's net NPAs should be less than 7% of its net loans  and  advances.\n3.4.1.3 The  bank  should  have  posted  net  profit  for  the  last  3 consecutive years.\n3.4.1.4 Primary  (urban)  co-operative banks  intending  to  provide  safe deposit lockers at\ntheir extension counters should ensure that :\n(i)  The  institution  in  whose  premises  the   extension   counter is/proposed  to\nbe  opened is agreeable for  the  provision  of  such facility.\n(ii)  Adequate  security  arrangements  are  in  place  at  the  locker premises .\n 3.5 Up-gradation of Extension Counters\nUpgradation of EC into a branch is treated as equivalent to allotment of centre for\nopening of a branch. The banks should apply for upgradation of an EC to a branch\nunder their annual action plan for opening of branches. Only such of the ECs as have\nbeen accorded post-facto approval by the Reserve Bank of India or opened with the\nprior approval of the Reserve Bank of India will be considered for upgradation into a\nbranch.\n4 AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES (ATMS) AND BRANCH TELLER\nMACHINES (BTMS)\n4.1 Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks\n4.1.1 Scheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks categorised as Gr.I, need not obtain\nprior permission of the Reserve Bank of India for installation of Automated Teller\nMachines (ATMs)/Branch Teller Machines (BTMs) at their branches/extension\ncounters permitted by RBI.  However, banks categorised in Grade II/III/IV will have to\nobtain  prior approval of Reserve Bank.\n4.1.2 The banks should furnish the particulars of installations of ATMs/BTMs at their\nbranches/extension counters, to the concerned Regional Office of this Department as\nalso to this office, immediately after their installation.\n4.1.3 ATMs/BTMs installed at the branch/extension counter should not be shared/inter-\nlinked with other banks, without obtaining prior approval of Reserve Bank of India.\n4.1.4 Scheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks intending to install ATMs/BTMs at\nother places (other than branch/extension counter location) should obtain a licence\ntherefor from the concerned Regional Office of this Department.\n84.2 Off-Site ATMs\n4.2.1 Scheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks may  install  off-site ATMs  (at places\nother  than the  bank's  branches/extension counters) with   prior  approval subject  to\ncomplying  with  the  following norms:\n4.2.1.1 The bank should have achieved minimum CRAR prescribed.\n4.2.1.2 Net NPAs of the bank should be less than 10% of its net loans and advances.\n4.2.1.3  The bank should have earned operating profits for the preceding   three years.\n4.2.2 The following functional facilities may be provided at such off-site ATMs:\n  (i) PIN changes\n  (ii) Requisition for cheque books\n(iii) Statement of accounts\n  (iv) Balance enquiry\n4.2.3  Inter-account  transfer  -  restricted to  accounts  of  the  same customer at the same\ncentre.\n4.2.4 The banks may connect such off-site ATMs to Swadhan Net Work.\n4.2.5 The bank may  provide telephone connection  between the \"stand  alone\" ATMs with\nbranch  ATMs  and Shared  Payment  Network  System  (SPNS). However, no person\nother than security guard, should be posted at such non-branch stand alone ATM\ncentres.\n4.2.6 The off-site ATMs will also  require a licence in terms of  Section 23 of  B.R. Act\n1949 (AACS).  Such of  the scheduled  banks, who wish to install off-site ATMs  and\nsatisfy the criteria stipulated above  may apply for licences  to our  Regional Office\nunder whose  jurisdiction they are  functioning.

The\nbanks will have to actively market the scheme to the eligible clientele.\nNature of  financial accommodation\nThe credit facility extended under the Scheme is in the nature of a composite loan  including\nterm loan /revolving  cash credit.\nSanction of term loan/ Fixation of  working capital limit\n\u2022 The term loan will be provided  for meeting the investment requirements and it will\nbe repaid within five years in suitable installments.\n\u2022 The  Revolving cash credit will be fixed  taking into account the  operating\ncycle/nature  of the investment and shall be fixed based on  available balance after\nsanction of term loan.\nQuantum of  limit\nRs. 25,000/ per borrower as composite loan. The initial investment in fixed assets and/ or\nworking capital requirement / recurring expenditure of the borrower are to be taken as the\nbase for fixing the  limit. The working capital/ recurring expenditure limit may be in the form\nof a revolving  cash  credit  and  fixed  as a  percentage  of  the  turnover  divided  by the\nnumber  of operating cycles per annum. A component for consumption credit could be built\nin keeping in view the value of the family labour in the productive activity. The total limit\nwould have a relationship with the projected net earning and the repayment capacity of the\nborrower.\nValidity\nSCC is  normally valid for 5  years subject to satisfactory operation of the account and\nrenewed on a yearly basis through simple  review process. The operations in the account\nshould be regular.\nIssue of cards\u2022 The beneficiaries under the scheme will be issued with a laminated credit card and a\npass book as per specimen enclosed (Appendix). This will serve as an identity card as\nwell as facilitate recording of the transactions on an ongoing basis. The pass book\nwould contain the repayment schedule of the term loan also. A passport size\nphotograph of the holder will be affixed on the card at the space provided for .The\ncard holder would be required to produce the card and the  pass book whenever he/she\nwithdraws cash from the  account.\n\u2022 Self Help Groups ( SHGs) can also be issued cards in their name and they will be\nliable jointly and severally for repayment.\n\u2022 As far as possible cluster approach will be followed in implementing the scheme.\n\u2022 Fees towards issue of card/processing may not  exceed Rs 50/.\nRenewal of Working Capital limits\n\u2022 Limits will be renewed annually based on the amount credited to the cash credit\naccount and the repayment performance in the term loan account.\n\u2022 Under the Scheme, term loan component could be enhanced within the overall limit in\ncase of need subject to satisfactory repayment performance of the borrower.\n\u2022 The  Revolving cash credit to the extent of working capital repaid may be renewed\nwithin the overall ceiling of Rs 25,000/  and it should be normally repaid within 12\nmonths from the date of drawal. However, the minimum discipline expected is that\napplicable to cash credit accounts. Where necessary, the working capital component\ncould be enhanced within the overall ceiling to provide for escalation in the cost of\ninputs, etc subject to satisfactory repayment performance.\n\u2022 No drawal will be permitted if revolving cash credit remains outstanding for more\nthan 12 months.\n\u2022 The aggregate credits in the account during the 12 months period should  normally be\nequal to the  maximum outstanding in the working capital component plus the\ninstallment of the term loan availed of, if any.\nOperation of the scheme\n\u2022 The banks will have absolute freedom to select the clients for the card. There will be\nno subsidy from the Government under this Scheme.\n\u2022 The borrower can avail the credit facility as per his/her requirements ie either term\nloan or working capital loan or a combination of both.\n\u2022 The beneficiaries under the Scheme are to be issued with a laminated credit card and a\npassbook incorporating the name, address, borrowing limit, validity etc. which will\nserve both as an identity card as well as facilitate recording of the transactions on an\nongoing basis .\n\u2022 The issuing branch would maintain the ledger account in respect of  each SCC\naccount holder. The term loan component and working capital component will be\naccounted for separately. The operations in the account will be generally through the\ncard issuing branch. However, the banks may at their discretion permit operations\nthrough the designated branches, taking into account the convenience of the clientele.\n\u2022 Withdrawal from the account will be through withdrawal slips/ cheques. The SCC and\nPass Book should be produced each time cash withdrawal is made.\n\u2022 Opening of SB A/c should not be a precondition for issue of SCC. However, in case\nSCC holder desires on his/her own to open SB A/c, he/she may be allowed to do so.Insurance\nBeneficiaries under the scheme would automatically be covered under the group insurance\nscheme and the premium would be shared by the bank and the borrower equally.  Each bank\nmay negotiate the terms of insurance with a company of its choice on a national or regional\nbasis.\nSecurity/Margin/Rate of interest /Prudential norms\nSecurity, Margin, Rate of interest and Prudential norms are applicable as  per RBI norms.\nNABARD refinance\nNABARD refinance will be provided  for advances under SCC Scheme to eligible banks\nagainst their lendings to the borrowers in rural areas as per norms under the Composite Loan\nScheme.\nMonitoring\nNABARD being the nodal agency for monitoring the scheme, in order to facilitate close\nmonitoring of the Scheme at the ground level, banks are required to report the monthly\nprogress to the Regional Offices of NABARD concerned in the format  enclosed ( Annexure\nII ).\nMedium Term Strategy\nIt is expected that banks would issue 2 lakh cards during the year 2003-04 and achieve a\ntarget of 40 lakh before the end of the X Five Year Plan. The state -wise and bank-wise\ntargets would be proposed by NABARD and approved by the SLBC.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/39558.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Sep 24, 2003", "info": "Submission of Consolidated A1/A2 Forms\nA.P.(DIR Series) Circular No.23 (Sept 24, 2003)\nReserve Bank of India\nExchange Control Department\nCentral Office\nMumbai - 400 001\nA.P.(DIR Series) Circular No.23\nSeptember 24, 2003\nTo\nAll Authorised Dealers in Foreign Exchange\nMadam/Sirs,\nSubmission of Consolidated A1/A2 Forms\nAs per the extant instructions, residents while making remittances exceeding USD\n500 towards imports are required to apply in Form A1 and for other remittances in  Form A2.\n2.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Increasing incidence of frauds and dacoities/ robberies in banks is a matter of concern. Frauds\nperpetrated in banks show an increasing trend mainly on account of non-adherence/improper implementation of\nvarious guidelines.\n1.2 The pri mary responsibility for preventing frauds is that of bank management. Reserve Bank of India, on\nits part, has been advising banks from time to time about the major fraud prone areas and the necessary\nsafeguards for their prevention.\n1.3 Reserve Bank of Ind ia has also been circulating to banks details of frauds of ingenious nature which\ncome to its notice so that individual banks could introduce necessary safeguards by means of appropriate\nprocedures and internal checks having regard to the modus operandi of the frauds.\n1.4 For the purpose, it is very important that Reserve Bank of India receives full information about the\nincidence of frauds and the action taken by the banks to prevent them.\n1.5 In order to enable the Reserve Bank of India to have required i nformation on frauds, suitable reporting\nsystem has been introduced which is detailed hereunder.\n2. TIMELY DETECTION AND REPORTING\n2.1 It has been observed that very often frauds are detected in banks long after their perpetration, thus\nallowing the fraud to continue for a long time. In spite of the existence of various control systems and\narrangements to supervise the working of branches of banks through internal and external inspections/ audits,\nvigilance machinery, etc., a number of frauds perpetrated are not detected during the course of inspection/\naudit.\n2.2 It is also observed that in some cases, the reports on frauds are submitted to Reserve Bank of India\nwith considerable delay and many a time, without adequate information. The reasons for delay in detection and\nin reporting are also not clearly stated in such reports. On many occasions, Reserve Bank of India comes to\nknow about frauds involving large amounts only through press reports. This happens due to non-reporting of\nfrauds by banks immediately on their detection.\n2.3 UCBs must look into the reasons for delay in reporting of frauds to Reserve Bank of India and\nensure that the reporting system is suitably streamlined so that frauds are reported without any delay.\nFurther, banks must fix staff accountability for delays in reporting of frauds to Reserve Bank of India.3. CLASSIFICATION OF FRAUDS\n3.1 In order to have uniformity in reporting cases of frauds, the question of classification of bank frauds on\nthe basis of the provisions of the Indian Penal Code has been considered and frauds have been classified as\nunder:\n(i) Misappropriation and criminal breach of trust.\n(ii) Fraudulent encashment through forged instruments, manipulation of books of account or through\nfictitious accounts and conversion of property.\n(iii) Unauthorized credit facilities extended for reward or for illegal gratification.\n(iv) Negligence and cash shortages.\n(v) Cheating and forgery.\n(vi) Irregularities in foreign exchange transactions. (vii) L/C or Bank Guarantee (viii) Any\nother type of fraud not covered above.\n3.2 Cases of \u2018negligence and cash shortages\u2019 referred to in item (iv) above are to be reported as frauds if the\nintention to cheat/defraud is suspected/ proved.\n3.3 Cases of theft and burglary should not be reported as frauds.

Several Expert\nCommittees which have studied  the working of  UCBs have recognized the important role of\nUCBs in the country's banking system and the need to promote UCBs on sound and healthy\nlines.\n2. The financial soundness and stability of the UCBs are crucial for protecting the\ninterests of the depositors.  Since the UCBs have limited sources for augmenting their capital\nfunds, the boards of UCBs ,  should initiate steps to strengthen the financials of the UCBs\nthrough plough back of profits to general reserves.  The State Co-operative Societies Acts\ncontain provisions relating to transfer of at least one-fourth of the net profits each year to\nReserve Fund so as to strengthen the capital funds, with a view to protecting the interests of\nthe depositors.  A tendency is, however, observed among the UCBs to distribute dividends at\nrates higher than what could be considered prudent in view of the financials of the bank.\nThere have been instances of UCBs declaring higher dividends than the maximum prescribed\nunder the Co-operative Societies Act.  We have also been receiving requests from UCBs\nwhich are classified as Grade II, III or IV for permission to declare dividend on the ground\nthat they have made adequate provisions for NPAs, or  the requirements of CRAR have been\ncomplied with, etc.  The distribution of dividend when the financial position of the bank is\nnot sound, is imprudent and will be prejudicial to the interests of its depositors.\n3. The matter has ,  therefore, been reviewed.  It has been felt necessary to set out  certain\nobjective and transparent criteria for declaration of dividends by the UCBs.  Accordingly, the\nfollowing norms are set out for implementation by UCBs with immediate effect:\n(a) Only banks which  have  not  been  classified by RBI as Grade II, III or IV may\ndeclare dividend, provided, however, that the dividend pay-out does not impair the\nbank's liquidity position.\n(b) Banks classified as Grade II should obtain the prior permission from the concerned\nRegional Office of  RBI to declare dividend.  Their application will be considered if\nthey comply with the following parameters:\n(i) Compliance with the CRAR norms, as prescribed by the RBI.\n(ii) Net NPAs of the bank are less than 10%, after making all the necessary\nprovisions as per the assessment made by the RBI in its latest inspection report.(iii) There is no default in CRR/ SLR during the year for which dividend is proposed.\n(iv) All the required provisions have been made for NPAs, investments and  other\nassets as per the prudential norms prescribed by RBI. Where the bank has not\nbeen inspected recently by RBI and, therefore ,  NPAs, etc. have not been\nassessed by RBI, an Auditor's certificate to the effect that all necessary\nprovisions have been made, should be submitted.\n(v) Dividend is paid out of the net profit and after making all statutory provisions\nand adjustment for accumulated losses.\n(c) Banks classified under Grade III and Grade IV  should not declare any dividend until\nthey are upgraded to Grade I or Grade II and subject to their satisfying the conditions\nat (b) above.\n2.

Since this is a fraud prone area, it is\nimperative for banks to adjust the old pending entries in the Clearing Adjustment Accounts.\n2. While reviewing the position of progress made by banks in reducing the outstanding\nentries in their Clearing Adjustment Account, it has been observed that entries of smaller\nvalues form a significant portion of the old outstanding clearing differences and pose\npractical difficulties in the reconciliation. In the light of suggestions received from banks and\nwith a view to reducing the level of long pending outstanding entries in the Clearing\nAdjustment Account of banks, it has been decided, as a one time measure , to allow banks to\nnet off the entries representing clearing differences receivable against entries representing\nclearing differences payable up to Rs. 500 which are outstanding for more than three years.\n3. Banks are advised to adopt the following procedure for netting off the entries representing\nclearing differences receivable against entries representing clearing differences payable.\na. Banks may net off all entries representing clearing differences 'receivable' against\nentries representing clearing differences 'payable', of amounts less than Rs. 500 each\nwhich are outstanding in the Clearing Adjustment Accounts for more than three years\nas on March 31, 2003, i.e., all outstanding entries of less than Rs. 500 each in the\nClearing Adjustment Account (receivables against payables) originated on or before\nMarch 31, 2000 and outstanding as on March 31, 2003.\nb. In case of the entries outstanding in the branch books, the banks may net off the\noutstanding entries in the clearing differences account and thereafter transfer the net\nposition to their Head Office along with the full details of the entries representing\nclearing differences payable as also the entries representing clearing differences\nreceivable.\nc. At the Head Office, the bank may aggregate the net positions reported by the branches\nand arrive at the net aggregate position of clearing differences. If the aggregate net is\nin debit, the same may be written off by debit to the profit and loss account. If the\naggregate net is a credit, the same may be transferred to a separate blocked account\nand shown under 'other liabilities and provisions - others' in the balance sheet\n(Schedule 5 of the Balance Sheet). The balance in the blocked account will be\nreckoned for the purpose of maintenance of CRR/ SLR.2\nd. Banks should ensure that the above exercise does not result in any portion of the\nclearing difference entries being parked in the inter-branch accounts.\ne. Banks should maintain a record of the clearing difference entries transferred to Head\nOffice at the branches / Head Office for verification by internal inspection / auditors /\nRBI inspection. The netting off at the branches, the transfer of entries by the branches\nto the Head Office, the netting off at the Head Office and the writing off / transfer at\nthe Head Office should be subjected to a 100 percent audit by the internal auditors,\nthe concurrent auditors and the statutory auditors.\n4. It has also been observed that the Clearing Adjustment Account of banks include entries\npertaining to inter-branch clearing differences in addition to the inter-bank clearing\ndifferences. Separation of instruments viz. cheques, demand drafts etc. pertaining to inter-\nbranch transactions from inter-bank clearing is expected to reduce the clearing differences\nconsiderably. Hence, banks are advised to route their inter-branch clearing instruments\nthrough an in-house clearing mechanism and not route it along with inter-bank clearing\ninstruments.\n5. These guidelines may be placed before the Board of Directors.\n6. Please acknowledge receipt to our concerned Regional Office .\nYours faithfully,\n(A.  V.

In terms\nof the circular a set of 10 OSS returns was introduced to supplement on-site supervision of large\nurban cooperative banks.\nIt is now proposed to revise the content and structure of the OSS returns with the objective of\nreducing the volume of data required to be reported by the banks, while increasing the breadth\nand depth of information being obtained from UCBs by the department. Under the proposed\nsystem, the number of off-site surveillance returns required to be submitted by banks have been\nreduced from 10 to 8. Out of the eight returns, the periodicity of one return is annual and the rest\nseven would have to be submitted at quarterly intervals.\nWhile the main objective of this Prudential Supervisory Reporting System ( PSRS) is to obtain\nrelevant information on areas of prudential interest. As may be seen from the proposed formats,\nthe returns have also been designed to address the management information needs and to\nstrengthen the MIS capabilities within the reporting institutions. Prudential concerns monitored\nthrough these returns are on aspects relating to solvency, liquidity, capital adequacy, asset\nquality/portfolio risk profile, concentration of exposures, and connected or related lendings of the\nsupervised institutions.\nKeeping in view these broad objectives of the PSRS comprising the eight OSS returns given in\nStatements 1 to 8, you are requested to peruse and offer your comments on the formats.

Capital adequacy for subsidiaries\nAnnexure 1\nAnnexure 1a\nAnnexure 2\nAnnexure 2a\nAnnexure 2b\nAnnexure 2c\nAnnexure 3\nAnnexure 4\nAppendix (Part-a)\nAppendix (Part-b)\n1. General\n1.1 With a view to a dopting the Basle Committee framework on capital adequacy norms\nwhich takes into account the elements of risk in various types of assets in the balance sheet as\nwell as off-balance sheet business and also to strengthen the capital base of banks, ReserveBank of India decided in April 1992 to introduce a risk asset ratio system for banks (including\nforeign banks) in India as a capital adequacy measure.\n1.2 Essentially, under the above system the balance sheet assets, non-funded items and\nother off-balance sheet exposures are assigned weights according to the prescribed risk weights\nand banks have to maintain unimpaired minimum capital funds equivalent to the prescribed\nratio on the aggregate of the risk weighted assets and other exposures on an ongoing basis. The\nbroad details of the capital adequacy framework are detailed below.\n2. Capital funds\n2.1 Capital funds of Indian banks\nFor Indian banks, 'capital funds' would include the following elements:\n2.1.1 Elements of Tier I capital\ni) Paid-up capital, statutory reserves, and other disclosed free reserves, if any.\nii) Capital reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of assets.\n2.1.2 Equity investments in subsidiaries, intangible assets and losses in the current period\nand those brought forward from previous periods, should be deducted from Tier I\ncapital.\n2.1.3 In the case of public sector banks which have introduced Voluntary Retirement\nScheme ( VRS), in view of the extra-ordinary nature of the event, the VRS related\nDeferred Revenue Expenditure would not be reduced from Tier I capital.\n2.1.4 Creation of deferred tax asset ( DTA) results in an increase in Tier I capital of a\nbank without any tangible asset being added to the banks\u2019 balance sheet. Therefore,\nDTA, which is an intangible asset, should be deducted from Tier I capital.\n2.1.5 Elements of Tier II capital\ni) Undisclosed reserves and cumulative perpetual preference shares\nThese often have characteristics similar to equity and disclosed reserves. These\nelements have the capacity to absorb unexpected losses and can be included in\ncapital, if they represent accumulations of post-tax profits and not encumbered\nby any known liability and should not be routinely used for absorbing normal\nloss or operating losses. Cumulative perpetual preference shares should be fully\npaid-up and should not contain clauses which permit redemption by the holder.\nii) Revaluation reserves\nThese reserves often serve as a cushion against unexpected losses, but they are\nless permanent in nature and cannot be considered as \u2018Core Capital\u2019.\nRevaluation reserves arise from revaluation of assets that are undervalued on\nthe bank\u2019s books, typically bank premises and marketable securities. The extent\nto which the revaluation reserves can be relied upon as a cushion for unexpected\nlosses depends mainly upon the level of certainty that can be placed on\nestimates of the market values of the relevant assets, the subsequent\ndeterioration in values under difficult market conditions or in a forced sale,\npotential for actual liquidation at those values, tax consequences of revaluation,\netc. Therefore, it would be prudent to consider revaluation reserves at a discount\nof 55 percent while determining their value for inclusion in Tier II capital. Suchreserves will have to be reflected on the face of the Balance Sheet as revaluation\nreserves.\niii) General provisions and loss reserves\nSuch reserves, if they are not attributable to the actual diminution in value or\nidentifiable potential loss in any specific asset and are available to meet\nunexpected losses, can be included in Tier II capital. Adequate care must be\ntaken to see that sufficient provisions have been made to meet all known losses\nand foreseeable potential losses before considering general provisions and loss\nreserves to be part of Tier II capital. General provisions/loss reserves will be\nadmitted up to a maximum of 1.25 percent of total risk weighted assets.\niv) Hybrid debt capital instruments\nIn this category, fall a number of capital instruments which combine certain\ncharacteristics of equity and certain characteristics of debt. Each has a particular\nfeature which can be considered to affect its quality as capital. Where these\ninstruments have close similarities to equity, in particular when they are able to\nsupport losses on an ongoing basis without triggering liquidation, they may be\nincluded in Tier II capital.\nv) Subordinated debt\n(a) To be eligible for inclusion in Tier II capital, the instrument   should  be\nfully paid-up, unsecured, subordinated to the claims of other  creditors, free\nof restrictive clauses, and should not be redeemable at the initiative of the\nholder or without the consent of the Reserve Bank of India. They often\ncarry a fixed maturity, and as they approach maturity, they should be\nsubjected to progressive discount, for inclusion in Tier II capital.\nInstruments with an initial maturity of less than 5 years or with a remaining\nmaturity of one year should not be included as part of Tier II capital.\nSubordinated debt instruments eligible to be reckoned as Tier II capital will\nbe limited to 50 percent of Tier I capital.\nb) In the case of public sector banks, the bonds issued to the VRS employees\nas a part of the compensation package, net of the unamortised   VRS\nDeferred Revenue Expenditure, could be treated  as Tier II capital, subject\nto compliance with the terms and conditions  stipulated in para 2.4 below.\nc) The subordinated debt instruments included in Tier II capital may be\nsubjected to discount at the rates shown below:\nRemaining Maturity of Instruments Rate of Discount\n(%)\nLess than one year 100\nOne year and more but less than two years 80\nTwo years and more but less than three years 60\nThree years and more but less than four years 40\nFour years and more but less than five years 20d) Banks should indicate the amount of subordinated debt raised as Tier II\ncapital by way of explanatory notes/ remarks in the Balance Sheet as well\nas in Schedule 5 under  'Other Liabilities & Provisions'.\nvi) The Investment Fluctuation Reserve ( IFR) would continue to be treated as Tier\nII capital but it would not be subject to the ceiling of   1.25 per cent of the\ntotal risk weighted assets. The above treatment would be effective from   March\n31, 2003 onwards.\nvii) Banks are allowed to include the \u2018General Provisions on St andard Assets\u2019 and\n\u2018provisions held for country exposures\u2019 in Tier II capital. However, the\nprovisions on \u2018standard assets together with other \u2018general provisions/ loss\nreserves\u2019 and \u2018provisions held for country exposures\u2019 will be admitted as Tier II\ncapital up to a maximum of 1.25 per cent of the total risk-weighted assets.\n2.1.6 Tier II  elements  should be limited to a maximum of 100 percent of total Tier I\nelements for the purpose of compliance with the norms.\n2.1.7 A bank\u2019s aggregate investment in T ier II bonds issued by other banks and financial\ninstitutions shall be permitted upto 10 percent of the investing banks total capital.\nThe total capital for this purpose will be the same as reckoned for the purpose of\nCapital Adequacy.\n2.2 Capital funds o f foreign banks operating in India\nFor foreign banks, 'capital funds' would include the following elements:\n2.2.1 Elements of Tier I capital\ni) Interest-free funds from Head Office kept in a separate account in Indian books\nspecifically for the purpose of meeting the capital adequacy norms.\nii) Statutory reserves kept in Indian books.\niii) Remittable surplus retained in Indian books which is not repatriable so long as the\nbank functions in India.\nNotes:\na) The foreign banks are required to furnish to Reserve Bank, (if not already done), an\nundertaking to the effect that the banks will not remit abroad the remittable surplus\nretained in India and included in Tier I capital as long as the banks function in\nIndia.\nb) These funds may be retained in a separate account titled as 'Amount Retained in\nIndia for Meeting Capital to Risk-weighted Asset Ratio ( CRAR) Requirements'\nunder 'Capital Funds'.\nc) An auditor's certificate to the effect that these funds represent surplus remittable to\nHead Office once tax assessments are completed or tax appeals are decided and do\nnot include funds in the nature of provisions towards tax or for any other\ncontingency may also be furnished to Reserve Bank.d) Foreign banks operating in India are permitted to hedge their Tier I capital held in\nIndian books. These banks are free to make their own decision as regards the timing\nof the hedge transactions subject to compliance with all other terms and conditions\ncontained in Exchange Control Department\u2019s circular\nNo.EC.CO.FMD.6/02.03.75/2002-2003 dated November 20, 2002.\niv) Capital reserve representing surplus arising out of sale of assets in India held in a\nseparate account and which is not eligible for repatriation so long as the bank\nfunctions in India.\nv) Interest-free funds remitted from abroad for the purpose of acquisition of property\nand held in a separate account in Indian books.\nvi) The net credit balance, if any, in the inter-office account with Head Office/overseas\nbranches will not be reckoned as capital funds. However, any debit balance in Head\nOffice account will have to be set-off against the capital.\n2.2.2 Elements of Tier II capital\nTo the extent relevant, elements of Tier II capital as indicated above in paragraph 2.1.4\nin respect of Indian banks will be eligible.\n2.2.3 The elements of Tier I &  Tier II capital do not include foreign currency loans granted to\nIndian parties.\n2.3 Minimum requirement of capital funds\nBanks were required to maintain a minimum Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio ( CRAR)\nnorm of 8 percent on an ongoing basis up to the year ending 31 March 1999. With effect from\nthe year ending 31 March 2000, banks are required to maintain a minimum CRAR of 9 percent\non an ongoing basis.\n2.4 Issue of subordinated debt for raising Tier II capital\n2.4.1 The Reserve Bank has given autonomy to Indian banks to raise rupee subordinated debt\nas Tier II capital, subject to the terms and conditions given in the Annexure 1 . It should be\nensured that the terms & conditions are strictly adhered to.\n2.4.2 Foreign banks also would not require prior approval of RBI for raising subordinated debt\nin foreign currency through borrowings from Head Office for inclusion in Tier II capital. To\nensure transparency and uniformity, detailed guidelines in this regard are given at Annexure\n1A.\n2.4.3 The banks should submit a report to Reserve Bank of India giving details of the\nSubordinated debt issued for raising Tier II capital, such as, amount raised, maturity of the\ninstrument, rate of interest together with a  copy of the offer document, soon after the issue is\ncompleted.\n3. Risk adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items3.1 Risk adjusted assets would mean weighted aggregate of funded and non-funded items.\nDegrees of credit risk expressed as percentage weightings, have been assigned to balance sheet\nassets and conversion factors to off-balance sheet items.\n3.2 Banks\u2019 investments in all securities should be assigned a risk weight of 2.5 percent for\nmarket risk. This will be in addition to the risk weights assigned towards credit risk since, in\nline with best practices, some capital cushion should also be provided for market risk in\naddition to credit risk.\n3.3 The value of each asset/ item shall be multiplied by the relevant weights to produce risk\nadjusted values of assets and off-balance sheet items. The aggregate will be taken into account\nfor reckoning the minimum capital ratio.\n3.4 The risk-weights allotted to each of the items of assets and off-balance sheet items are\nfurnished in the Annexure 2 .\n4. Capital Adequacy for Subsidiaries   \n4.1  The Basel Committee on  Banking  Supervision  has  proposed    that  the  New Capital\nAdequacy Framework should be extended to include, on a consolidated basis, holding\ncompanies that are parents of banking groups. On prudential considerations, it is necessary to\nadopt best practices in line with international standards, while duly reflecting local conditions .\n4.2 Accordingly, banks may voluntarily build-in the risk weighted components of their\nsubsidiaries into their own balance sheet on notional basis, at par with the risk weights\napplicable to the bank's own assets. Banks should earmark additional capital in their books\nover a period of time so as to obviate the possibility of impairment to their net worth when\nswitchover to unified balance sheet for the group as a whole is adopted after sometime. The\nadditional capital required may be provided in the bank's books in phases, beginning from the\nyear ended March 2001.\n4.3 A Consolidated bank defined as a group of entities which include a licensed bank should\nmaintain a   minimum    Capital  to    Risk-weighted Assets Ratio ( CRAR) as applicable  to  the\nparent bank on an ongoing basis  from the year ended  31  March  2003. While computing\ncapital  funds,  parent bank  may consider  the following points :\n(i) Banks  are  required to maintain a minimum capital  to  risk weighted  assets  ratio\nof 9%.  Non- bank  subsidiaries  are required  to maintain the capital adequacy ratio\nprescribed by their respective regulators. In case of any shortfall  in the  capital\nadequacy ratio of any of the subsidiaries,  the parent  should  maintain  capital in\naddition  to  its  own regulatory requirements to cover the shortfall.\n(ii) Risks inherent in deconsolidated entities  (i.e., entities which are not consolidated in\nthe Consolidated  Prudential Reports) in the group need to be assessed and any\nshortfall in  the  regulatory capital in the  deconsolidated  entities should be deducted\n(in equal proportion from Tier 1 and Tier 2  capital)  from  the consolidated bank's\ncapital  in  the proportion of its equity stake in the entity.\n~~~~~~ANNEXURE   1\nMaster Circular\nPRUDENTIAL NORMS ON CAPITAL ADEQUACY\nIssue of unsecured bonds as\nSubordinated Debt by banks for raising Tier II capital\n(Vide paragraph 2.4.1)\nI.

Introduction\nWith the introduction of prudential norms on capital adequacy, income recognition, asset\nclassification and provisioning requirements, the financial position of banks in India has\nimproved in the last few years. Simultaneously, trading in securities market has improved in\nterms of turnover and the range of maturities dealt with. In view of these developments and\ntaking into consideration the evolving international practices, Reserve Bank of India has\nissued guidelines on classification, valuation and operation of investment portfolio by banks\nfrom time to time as detailed below:RBI_MC_INV_200311.2  Investment Policy\ni) Banks should frame and implement a suitable investment policy to ensure that\noperations in securities are conducted in accordance with sound and acceptable\nbusiness practices.  While framing the investment policy, the following guidelines are\nto be kept in view by the banks ;\n(a) No sale transactions should be put through without actually holding the security\nin its investment account i.e. under no circumstances , a bank should hold a\noversold position in any security.  However, banks successful in the auction of\nprimary issue of Government securities , may, enter into contracts for sale of\nthe allotted securities in accordance with the terms and conditions as per\nAnnexure I.\n(b) All the transactions put through by a bank, either on outright basis or ready\nforward basis and whether through the mechanism of Subsidiary General Ledger\n(SGL) Account or Bank Receipt (BR), should be reflected on the same day in its\ninvestment account and, accordingly, for SLR purpose wherever applicable.\n(c) The brokerage on the deal payable to the broker, if any, (if the deal was put\nthrough with the help of a broker) should be clearly indicated on the notes/\nmemoranda put up to the top management seeking approval for putting through\nthe transaction and a separate account of brokerage paid, broker-wise, should be\nmaintained.\n(d) For issue of BRs, the banks should adopt the format prescribed by the Indian\nBanks' Association ( IBA) and strictly follow the guidelines prescribed by them\nin this regard.  The banks, subject to the above, could issue BRs covering their\nown sale transactions only and should not issue BRs on behalf of their\nconstituents, including brokers.\n(e) The banks should be circumspect while acting as agents of their broker clients\nfor carrying out transactions in securities on behalf of brokers.\n(f) Any instance of return of SGL form from the Public Debt Office of the Reserve\nBank for want of sufficient balance in the account should be immediately\nbrought to Reserve Bank's notice with the details of the transactions.\n(g) Banks desirous of making investment in equity shares / debentures should\nobserve the following guidelines:\n(i) Build up adequate expertise in equity research by establishing a dedicated\nequity research department, as warranted by their scale of operations;\n(ii) Formulate a transparent policy and procedure for investment in shares,\netc., with the approval of the Board.\n(iii) The decision in regard to direct investment in shares, convertible bonds\nand debentures should be taken by the Investment Committee set up by the\nbank\u2019s Board. The Investment Committee should be held accountable for\nthe investments made by the bank.RBI_MC_INV_20032ii) With the approval of respective Boards, banks should clearly lay down the broad\ninvestment objectives to be followed while undertaking transactions in securities on\ntheir own investment account and on behalf of clients, clearly define the authority to\nput through deals, procedure to be followed for obtaining the sanction of the\nappropriate authority, procedure to be followed while putting through deals, various\nprudential exposure limits and the reporting system.  While laying down such\ninvestment policy guidelines, banks should strictly observe Reserve Bank's detailed\ninstructions on the following aspects:\n(a) Ready Forward (buy back) deals (Paragraph 1.2.1)\n(b) Transactions through Subsidiary\nGeneral Ledger A/c (Paragraph 1.2.2)\n(c) Use of Bank Receipts (Paragraph 1.2.3)\n(d) Retailing of Government securities (Paragraph 1.2.4)\n(e) Internal Control System (Paragraph 1.2.5)\n(f) Dealings through Brokers (Paragraph 1.2.6)\n(g) Audit, Review and Reporting  (Paragraph 1.2.7)\n(h) Non- SLR investments (Paragraph 1.2.8)\niii) A copy of the Internal Investment Policy Guidelines, duly framed by the bank with\nthe approval of its Board, should be forwarded to the Reserve Bank (if not already\ndone) certifying that the same is in accordance with the RBI guidelines and that, the\nsame has been put in place.\niv) The aforesaid instructions will be applicable mutatis mutandis, to the subsidiaries and\nmutual funds established by banks, except where they are contrary to or inconsistent\nwith, specific regulations of Securities and Exchange Board of India and Reserve\nBank of India governing their operations.\n1.2.1 Ready Forward Contracts in Government  Securities.\n(i) In terms of the notification No. S.O. 131(E) dated January 22, 2003 issued by Reserve\nBank of India under powers derived under Section 29A of the Securities Contracts\n(Regulation) Act ( SCRA), 1956, the terms and conditions subject to which ready forward\ncontracts (including reverse ready forward contracts) may be entered into, are as under:\n(a) Ready forward contracts may be undertaken only in ( i) Dated Securities and\nTreasury Bills issued by Government of India and (ii) Dated Securities issued by\nState Governments.\n(b) Ready forward contracts in the above mentioned securities may be entered into by\ni) persons or entities maintaining a Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL) account with\nReserve Bank of India, Mumbai and\nii) the following categories of entities who do not maintain SGL accounts with the\nReserve Bank of India but maintain gilt accounts ( i.e gilt account holders) with a bank\nor any other entity (i.e. the custodian) permitted by the Reserve Bank of India to\nmaintain Constituent Subsidiary General Ledger ( CSGL) account with its Public Debt\nOffice, Mumbai:RBI_MC_INV_20033a) Any scheduled bank,\nb) Any primary dealer authorised by the Reserve Bank of India,\nc) Any non-banking financial company registered with the Reserve Bank of India,\nother than Government companies as defined in Section 617 of the Companies\nAct, 1956,\nd) Any mutual fund registered with the Securities Exchange Board of India,\ne) Any housing finance company registered with the National Housing Bank, and\nf) Any insurance company registered with the Insurance Regulatory and\nDevelopment Authority.\n(c) All persons or entities specified at (ii) above can enter into ready forward\ntransactions among themselves subject to the following restrictions :\n(i) An SGL account holder may not enter into a ready forward contract with its\nown constituent.  That is, ready forward contracts should not be undertaken\nbetween a custodian and its gilt account holder.\n(ii) Any two gilt account holders maintaining their gilt accounts with the same\ncustodian (i.e., the CSGL account holder) may not enter into ready forward\ncontracts with each other, and\n(iii) Cooperative banks may not enter into ready forward contracts with the non-\nbanking financial companies.\n(d) All ready forward contracts shall be reported on the Negotiated Dealing System\n(NDS).  In respect of ready forward contracts involving gilt account holders, the\ncustodian (i.e., the CSGL account holder) with whom the gilt accounts are\nmaintained will be responsible for reporting the deals on the NDS on behalf of the\nconstituents (i.e. the gilt account holders).\n(e) All ready forward contracts shall be settled through the SGL Account / CSGL\nAccount maintained with the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai, with the Clearing\nCorporation of India Ltd. ( CCIL) acting as the central counter party for all such ready\nforward transactions.\n(f) The custodians should put in place an effective system of internal control and\nconcurrent audit to ensure that :\ni) ready forward transactions are undertaken only against the clear balance of\nsecurities in the gilt account,\nii) all such transactions are promptly reported on the NDS, and iii) other terms\nand conditions referred to above have been complied with.\n(g) The RBI regulated entities can undertake ready forward transactions only in\nsecurities held in excess of the prescribed Statutory Liquidity Ratio ( SLR)\nrequirements.\n(h) No sale transaction shall be put through without actually holding the securities in the\nportfolio by a seller of securities in the first leg of a ready forward transaction.RBI_MC_INV_20034(i) Securities purchased under the ready forward contracts shall not be sold during the\nperiod of the contract.\n(ii)   The above terms and conditions will be the relevant terms and conditions specified by\nthe Reserve Bank of India under its notification No.S.O.131(E) dated January 22, 2003 issued\nin exercise of the powers conferred on the Reserve Bank of India under Section 16 of the\nSecurities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956) vide Government of India\nNotification No.183(E) dated 1st March, 2000, issued under Section 29A of the Act, ibid.\n(iii)    Prohibition against buy-back arrangements\na) Double ready forward deals in Government securities including treasury bills are\nstrictly prohibited.\nb) No ready forward and double ready forward deals should be put through even\namong banks and even on their investment accounts in other securities such as\npublic sector undertakings bonds, units of UTI, etc.\nc) Similarly, no ready forward and double ready forward deals should be entered into\nin any securities including Government securities, on behalf of other constituents\nincluding brokers.\n(iv) The guidelines for uniform accounting for Repo / Reverse Repo transactions are\nfurnished in Paragraph 4.\n1.2.2 Transactions through SGL account\nThe following instructions sho uld be followed by banks for purchase/ sale of securities\nthrough SGL A/c under the Delivery Versus Payment ( DVP) System wherein the transfer of\nsecurities takes place simultaneously with the transfer of funds.  It is, therefore, necessary for\nboth the selling  bank and the buying bank to maintain current account with the RBI. As no\nOverdraft facility in the current account would be extended, adequate balance in current\naccount should be maintained by banks for effecting any purchase transaction.\ni) All transactions in Govt. securities for which SGL facility is available should be put\nthrough SGL A/ cs only.\nii) Under no circumstances, a SGL transfer form issued by a bank in favour of another\nbank should bounce for want of sufficient balance of securities in the SGL A/c of\nseller or for want of sufficient balance of funds in the current a/c of the buyer.\niii) The SGL transfer form received by purchasing banks should be deposited in their\nSGL A/ cs. immediately i.e.  the date of lodgement of the SGL Form with RBI shall be\nwithin one working day after the date of signing of the Transfer Form.  While i n cases\nof OTC trades, the settlement has to be only on  \u2018spot\u2019 delivery basis as per Section\n2(i) of the Securities Contract Act, 1956,in cases of deals on the recognised Stock\nExchanges, settlement should be within the delivery period as per their rules, bye laws\nand regulations. In all cases, participants must indicate the deal/trade/ contract  date in\nPart  C of  the  SGL Form  under 'Sale  date'.  Where this  is  not completed the SGL\nForm will not be  accepted by the Reserve Bank of  India  (RBI).\niv) No sale should be effected by way of return of SGL form held by the bank .RBI_MC_INV_20035v) SGL transfer forms should be signed by two authorised officials of the bank whose\nsignatures should be recorded with the respective PDOs  of the Reserve Bank and\nother banks.\nvi) The SGL transfer forms should be in the standard format prescribed by the Reserve\nBank and printed on semi-security paper of uniform size.  They should be serially\nnumbered and there should be a control system in place  to account for each SGL\nform.\nvii) If a SGL transfer form bounces for want of sufficient balance in the SGL A/c, the\n(selling) bank which has issued the form will be liable to the following penal action\nagainst it :\na) The amount of the SGL form (cost of purchase paid by the purchaser of the\nsecurity) would be debited immediately to the current account of the selling\nbank with the Reserve Bank.\nb) In the event of an overdraft arising in the current account following such a\ndebit, penal interest would be charged by the Reserve Bank on the amount of\nthe overdraft at a rate of 3 percentage points above the Discount and Finance\nHouse of  India's ( DFHI) call money lending rate on the day in question.\nHowever, if the DFHI's closing call money rate is lower than the prime\nlending rate of banks, as stipulated in the Reserve Bank's interest rate directive\nin force, the applicable penal rate to be charged will be 3 percentage points\nabove the prime lending rate of the bank concerned, and\nc) If the bouncing of the SGL form occurs thrice, the bank will be debarred from\ntrading with the use of the SGL facility for a period of 6 months from the\noccurrence of the third bouncing.  If, after restoration of the facility, any SGL\nform of the concerned bank bounces again, the bank will be permanently\ndebarred from the use of the SGL facility in all the PDOs of the Reserve Bank.\nd) The bouncing on account of insufficient balance in the current account of the\nbuying bank would be reckoned (against the buying bank concerned) for the\npurpose of debarment from the use of SGL facility on par with the bouncing\non account of insufficient balance in SGL  a/c. of the selling bank (against\nselling bank).  Instances of bouncing in both the accounts ( i.e SGL a/c and\ncurrent a/c) will be reckoned together against the SGL account holder\nconcerned for the purpose of debarment ( i.e three in a half-year for temporary\nsuspension and any bouncing after restoration of SGL facility, for permanent\ndebarment.)\n1.2.3 Use of Bank Receipt (BR)\ni)   The banks should follow the following instructions for issue of BRs :\n(a) No BR should be issued under any circumstances in respect of transactions in Govt.\nsecurities for which SGL facility is available.RBI_MC_INV_20036(b) Even in the case of other securities, BR may be issued for ready transactions only,\nunder the following circumstances:\ni. The scrips are yet to be issued by the issuer and the bank is holding the\nallotment advice.\nii. The security is physically held at a different centre and the bank is in a\nposition to physically transfer the security and give delivery thereof within a\nshort period.\niii. The security has been lodged for transfer / interest payment and the bank is\nholding necessary records of such lodgements and will be in a position to give\nphysical delivery of the security within a short period.\n(c) No BR should be issued on the basis of a BR (of another bank) held by the bank and\nno transaction should take place on the basis of a mere exchange of BRs held by the\nbank.\n(d) BRs could be issued covering transactions relating to banks\u2019 own Investments\nAccounts only, and no BR should be issued by banks covering transactions relating\nto either the Accounts of Portfolio Management Scheme ( PMS) Clients or  Other\nConstituents' Accounts, including brokers.\n(e) No BR should remain outstanding for more than 15 days.\n(f) A BR should be redeemed only by actual delivery of scrips and not by cancellation\nof the transaction/set off against another transaction. If a BR is not redeemed by\ndelivery of scrips  within the validity period of 15 days, the BR should be deemed as\ndishonoured and the bank which has issued the BR should refer the case to the RBI,\nexplaining the reasons under which the scrips  could not be delivered within the\nstipulated period and the proposed manner of settlement of the transaction.\n(g) BRs should be issued on semi-security paper, in the standard format (prescribed by\nIBA), serially numbered and signed by two authorised officials of the bank, whose\nsignatures are recorded with other banks.  As in the case of  SGL forms, there\nshould be a control system in place to account for each BR form.\n(h) Separate registers of BRs issued and BRs received should be maintained and\narrangements should be put in place to ensure that these are systematically followed\nup and liquidated within the stipulated time limit.\n(i) The banks should also have a proper system for the custody of unused B.R. Forms\nand their utilisation. The existence and operations of  these controls at the concerned\noffices/ departments of the bank should be reviewed, among others, by the statutory\nauditors and a certificate to this effect may be forwarded every year to the Regional\nOffice of DBS, under whose jurisdiction the Head Office of the bank is located.\n(j) Any violation of the instructions relating to BRs would invite penal action, which\ncould include raising of reserve requirements, withdrawals of refinance facility from\nthe Reserve Bank and denial of access to money markets.  The Reserve Bank mayRBI_MC_INV_20037also levy such other penalty as it may deem fit in accordance with the provisions of\nthe Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n1.2.4 Retailing of  Government Securities\nThe banks may undertake retailing of Government securities with non-bank clients subject to\nthe following conditions:\ni) Such retailing should be on outright basis and there is no restriction on the period\nbetween sale and purchase.\nii) The retailing of Government securities should be on the basis of ongoing market\nrates/ yield curve emerging out of secondary market transactions.\niii) No sale of Government securities should be effected by banks unless they hold the\nsecurities in their portfolio either in the form of physical scrips or in the SGL Account\nmaintained with the Reserve Bank of India.\niv) Immediately on sale, the corresponding amount should be deducted by the bank from\nits investment account and from its SLR assets.\nv) Banks should put in place adequate internal control checks/ mechanisms as indicated\nin paragraph 1.2.5.\nvi) These transactions should be subjected  to concurrent audit by internal auditors/\nexternal auditors and results of their audit  should be placed before the CMD of the\nbank every month. These audit reports are also to be submitted to a separately\nconstituted  Cell on supervision of funds management operations in banks in RBI.\n1.2.5 Internal Control System\ni) The banks sh ould observe the following guidelines for internal control system in\nrespect of investment transactions :\n(a) There should be a clear functional separation of  ( i) trading, (ii) settlement,\nmonitoring and control and  (iii) accounting.  Similarly, there should be a\nfunctional separation of trading and back office functions relating to banks'\nown Investment Accounts, Portfolio Management Scheme ( PMS) Clients'\nAccounts and other Constituents (including brokers\u2019) accounts.  The Portfolio\nManagement service may be provided to clients, subject to strictly following\nthe guidelines in regard thereto (covered in paragraph 1.3.3). Further, PMS\nClients Accounts should be subjected to a separate audit by external auditors.\n(b) For every transaction entered into, the trading desk should prepare a deal slip\nwhich should contain data relating to nature of the deal, name of the counter-\nparty, whether it is a direct deal or through a broker, and if through a broker,\nname of the broker, details of security, amount, price, contract date and time.\nThe deal slips should be serially numbered and controlled separately to ensure\nthat each deal slip has been properly accounted for.  Once the deal is\nconcluded, the dealer should immediately pass on the deal slip to the backRBI_MC_INV_20038office for recording and processing. For each deal there must be a system of\nissue of confirmation to the counterparty.  The timely receipt of requisite\nwritten confirmation from the counterparty, which must include all essential\ndetails of the contract, should be monitored by the back office.\n(c) Once a deal has been concluded, there should not be any substitution of the\ncounter party bank by another bank by the broker, through whom the deal has\nbeen entered into; likewise, the security sold/purchased in the deal should not\nbe substituted by another security.\n(d) On the basis of vouchers passed by the back office (which should be done\nafter verification of actual contract notes received from the broker/\ncounterparty and confirmation of the deal by the counterparty), the Accounts\nSection should independently write the books of account.\n(e) In the case of transaction relating to PMS  Clients\u2019 Accounts (including\nbrokers), all the the relative records should give a clear indication that the\ntransaction belongs to PMS  Clients/ other constituents and does not belong to\nbank's own Investment Account and the bank is acting only in its fiduciary/\nagency capacity.\n(f)  (i)   Records of SGL transfer forms issued/ received, should be maintained.\n(ii)  Balances as per bank's books should be reconciled at quarterly intervals with\nthe balances in the books of PDOs.  If the number of transactions so warrant, the\nreconciliation should be undertaken more frequently, say on a monthly basis. This\nreconciliation should be periodically checked by the internal audit department.\n(iii)    Any bouncing of SGL transfer forms issued by selling banks in favour of\nthe buying bank, should immediately be brought to the notice of the Regional\nOffice of Department of Banking Supervision of RBI by the buying bank.\n(iv)    A record of BRs issued/ received should be maintained.\n(v)   A system for verification of the authenticity of the BRs and SGL transfer\nforms received from the other banks and confirmation of authorised signatories\nshould be put in place.\n(g) Banks should put in place a reporting system to report to the top management, on\na weekly basis, the details of transactions in securities, details of bouncing of SGL\ntransfer forms issued by other banks and BRs outstanding for more than one\nmonth and a review of investment transactions undertaken during the period.\n(h) Banks should not draw  cheques on their account with the Reserve Bank for third\nparty transactions, including inter-bank transactions.  For such transactions,\nbankers' cheques/ pay orders should be issued.\n(i) In case of investment in shares, the surveillance and monitoring of investment\nshould  be done by the Audit Committee of the Board, which shall review in each\nof its meetings, the total exposure of the bank to capital market both fund based\nand non-fund based, in different forms as stated above and ensure that theRBI_MC_INV_20039guidelines issued by RBI are complied with and adequate risk management and\ninternal control systems are in place;\n(j) The Audit Committee should  keep the Board informed about the overall exposure\nto capital market, the compliance with the RBI and Board guidelines, adequacy of\nrisk management and internal control systems;\n(k) In order to avoid any possible conflict of interest, it should be ensured that the\nstockbrokers as directors on the Boards of banks or in any other capacity, do not\ninvolve themselves in any manner with the Investment Committee or in the\ndecisions in regard to making investments in shares, etc., or advances against\nshares.\n(l)  The  internal audit department should audit the transactions in securities on an on\ngoing basis, monitor the compliance with the laid down management policies and\nprescribed procedures and report the deficiencies directly to the management of\nthe bank.\n(m) The banks' managements should ensure that there are adequate internal control\nand audit procedures for ensuring proper compliance of the instructions in regard\nto the conduct  of the investment portfolio.  The banks should institute a regular\nsystem of monitoring compliance with the prudential and other guidelines issued\nby the RBI.  The banks should get compliance in key areas certified by their\nstatutory auditors and furnish such audit certificate to the Regional Office of\nDepartment of  Banking Supervision of  RBI under whose jurisdiction the HO of\nthe bank falls.\n1.2.6  Engagement of brokers\ni) For engagement of brokers to deal in investment transactions, the banks should\nobserve the following guidelines :\n(a) Transactions between one bank and another bank should not be  put through the\nbrokers' accounts.  The brokerage on the deal payable to the broker, if any (if the deal\nwas put through with the help of a broker), should be clearly indicated on the notes/\nmemorandum put up to the top management seeking approval for putting through the\ntransaction and separate account of brokerage paid, broker-wise, should be\nmaintained.\n(b) If a deal is put through with the help of a broker, the role of the broker should be\nrestricted to that of bringing the two parties to the deal together.\n(c) While negotiating the deal, the broker is not obliged to disclose the identity of the\ncounterparty to the deal.  On conclusion of the deal, he should disclose the\ncounterparty and his contract note should clearly indicate the name of the\ncounterparty.\n(d) On the basis of the contract note disclosing the name of  the counterparty, settlement\nof deals between banks, viz. both fund settlement and delivery of security, should be\ndirectly between the banks and the broker should have no role to play in the process.RBI_MC_INV_200310(e) With the approval of their top managements, banks should prepare a panel of\napproved brokers which should be reviewed annually, or more often if so warranted.\nClear-cut criteria should be laid down for empanelment of brokers, including\nverification of their creditworthiness, market reputation, etc. A record of broker-wise\ndetails of deals put through and brokerage paid, should be maintained.\n(f) A disproportionate part of the business should not be transacted through only one or a\nfew brokers.  Banks should fix aggregate contract limits for each of the approved\nbrokers.  A limit of 5% of total transactions (both purchase and sales) entered into by\na bank during a year should be treated as the aggregate upper contract limit for each\nof the approved brokers. This limit should cover both the business initiated by a bank\nand the business offered/ brought to the bank by a broker.  Banks should ensure that\nthe transactions entered into through individual brokers during a year normally did\nnot exceed this limit.  However, if for any reason it becomes necessary to exceed the\naggregate limit for any broker, the specific reasons therefor should be recorded, in\nwriting, by the authority empowered to put through the deals.  Further, the board\nshould be informed of this, post facto.  However, the norm of 5% would not be\napplicable to banks\u2019 dealings through Primary Dealers.\n(g) The concurrent auditors who audit the treasury operations should scrutinise the\nbusiness done through brokers also and include it in their monthly report to the Chief\nExecutive Officer of the bank.  Besides, the business put through any individual\nbroker or brokers in excess of the limit, with the reasons therefor, should be covered\nin the half-yearly review to the Board of Directors/ Local Advisory Board.  These\ninstructions also apply to subsidiaries and mutual funds of the banks.\nExplanation : Certain clarifications on the instructions are furnished in the\nAnnexure III.\nii) Inter-bank securities transactions should be undertaken directly between banks and no\nbank should engage the services of any broker in such transactions.\nExceptions:\nNote  ( i)\nBanks may undertake securities transactions among themselves or with non bank clients\nthrough members of the National Stock Exchange ( NSE), OTC Exchange of India ( OTCEI)\nand the Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE).  If such transactions are not undertaken on the NSE,\nOTCEI or BSE, the same  should be undertaken by banks directly, without engaging brokers.\nNote (ii)\nAlthough the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 defines the term `securities' to\nmean corporate shares, debentures, Govt. securities and rights or interest in securities, the\nterm `securities' would exclude corporate shares.  The Provident/ Pension Funds and Trusts\nregistered under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, will be outside the purview of the expression\n`non-bank clients' for the purpose of note  ( i) above.\n1.2.7   Audit, review and reporting of investment transactionsRBI_MC_INV_200311The banks should follow the following instructions in regard to audit, review and reporting of\ninvestment transactions :\na) Banks should undertake a half-yearly review (as of 30 September and 31 March) of\ntheir investment portfolio, which should, apart from other operational aspects of\ninvestment portfolio, clearly indicate and certify adherence to laid down internal\ninvestment policy and procedures and Reserve Bank guidelines, and put up the same\nbefore their respective Boards within a month, i.e by end-April and end-October.\nb) A copy of the review report put up to the Bank's Board, should be forwarded to the\nReserve Bank (concerned Regional Office of DBS) by 15 November  and 15 May\nrespectively.\nc) In view of the possibility of abuse, treasury transactions should be separately\nsubjected to  a concurrent audit by internal auditors and the results of their audit\nshould be placed before the CMD of  the bank once every month.  These audit reports\nshould be sent to the Regional Office of Department of Banking Supervision ( DBS)\nof the Reserve Bank under whose jurisdiction the Head Office of the bank falls.\n1.2.8   Non- SLR investments\ni) Banks have made significant investment in privately placed unrated bonds and, in\ncertain cases, in bonds issued by corporates who are not their borrowers. While\nassessing such investment proposals on private placement basis, in the absence of\nstandardised and mandated disclosures, including credit rating, banks may not be in a\nposition to conduct proper due diligence to take an investment decision. Thus, there\ncould be deficiencies in the appraisal of privately placed issues. While it is not the\nintention to prohibit banks from subscribing to unrated  instruments on private\nplacement basis, however, as such investments could cause some concern, banks\nshould put in place appropriate systems to ensure that investment in privately placed\nunrated  instruments is made in accordance with the systems and procedures\nprescribed under the respective bank\u2019s investment policy approved by the Board.\nii) Further, the risk arising from inadequate disclosure in offer documents should be\nrecognised and banks should prescribe minimum disclosure standards as a policy with\nBoard approval.  In this connection, Reserve Bank of India had constituted a\nTechnical Group comprising officials drawn from treasury departments of a few\nbanks and experts on corporate finance to study, inter- alia, the methods of acquiring,\nby banks, of non- SLR investments in general and private placement route, in\nparticular, and to suggest measures for regulating these investments. The Group had\ndesigned a format containing the minimum disclosure requirements as well as certain\nconditionalities regarding documentation and creation of charge for private placement\nissues, which may serve as a 'best practice model' for the banks.  The details of the\nGroup\u2019s recommendations are given in the Annexure IV and banks may introduce\nwith immediate effect a suitable format of disclosure requirements on the lines of the\nrecommendations of the Technical Group with the approval of their Board.\niii) With a view to ensuring that the investments by banks in unrated issues through\nprivate placement, both of the borrower customers and non-borrower customers, doRBI_MC_INV_200312not give rise to systemic concerns, it is necessary that banks should ensure that their\ninvestment policies duly approved by the Board of Directors are formulated after\ntaking into account the following aspects:\n(a) The Boards of banks should lay down policy and prudential limits on investments\nin bonds and debentures including cap on unrated issues and on private\nplacement basis, sub limits for PSU bonds, corporate bonds, guaranteed bonds,\nissuer ceiling, etc.\n(b) Investment proposals should be subjected to the same degree of credit risk\nanalysis as any loan proposal.  Banks should make their own internal credit\nanalysis and rating even in respect of rated issues and should not entirely rely on\nthe ratings of external agencies. The appraisal should be more stringent in respect\nof investments in instruments issued by non-borrower customers.\n(c) In case of unrated issues or issues of companies who are not their borrowers,\nbanks should have an internal system of rating.  For this purpose, banks should\ninsist on obtaining adequate information from the issuers in a suitable manner as\nindicated in paragraph 3 above.\n(d) As a matter of prudence, banks should stipulate entry level minimum ratings/\nquality standards and industry-wise, maturity-wise, duration-wise, issuer-wise\netc. limits to mitigate the adverse impacts of concentration and the risk of\nilliquidity. The investments in unrated privately placed bonds and debentures\nshould be well diversified.\n(e) The banks should put in place proper risk management systems for capturing and\nanalysing the risk in respect of these investments and taking remedial measures\nin time. The 'rating' migration of the issuers and the consequent diminution in the\nportfolio quality should also be tracked at periodic intervals.\n(iv) Some banks / FIs  have not exercised due precaution by reference to the list of\ndefaulters circulated / published by RBI while investing in bonds, debentures, etc., of\ncompanies. Banks may, therefore, exercise due caution while taking any investment\ndecision to subscribe to bonds, debentures, shares etc., and refer to the \u2018Defaulters\nList\u2019 to ensure that investments are not made in companies / entities who are\ndefaulters to banks / FIs. Some of the companies may be undergoing adverse financial\nposition turning their accounts to sub-standard category due to recession in their\nindustry segment, like textiles. Despite restructuring facility provided under RBI\nguidelines, the banks have been reported to be reluctant to extend further finance,\nthough considered warranted on merits of the case. Banks may not refuse proposals\nfor such investments in companies whose director\u2019s name(s) find place in the\ndefaulter companies list circulated by RBI at periodical intervals and particularly in\nrespect of those loan accounts, which have been restructured under extant RBI\nguidelines, provided the proposal is viable and satisfies all parameters for such credit\nextension.\n(v) Direct investment in shares, convertible bonds and debentures etc.RBI_MC_INV_200313Banks are free to acquire shares, convertible debentures of corporates and units of\nequity- oriented  mutual funds, subject to a ceiling of 5 per cent of  the total\noutstanding domestic credit (excluding inter-bank lendings and advances outside\nIndia ) as on March 31 of the previous year.  Within the overall ceiling of 5 per cent\nfor total exposure to capital market, the total investment in shares, convertible bonds\nand debentures and units of equity-oriented mutual funds by a bank should not exceed\n20 per cent of its net worth. While making investment in equity shares etc., whose\nprices are subject to volatility, the banks should keep in view the following guidelines\n:\na) The ceiling for investment in shares, etc., as stated in the above paragraph (i.e., 20 per\ncent of net worth), is the maximum permissible ceiling and a bank\u2019s Board of\nDirectors is free to adopt a lower ceiling for the bank, keeping in view its overall risk\nprofile and corporate strategy.\nb) Banks may make investment in shares directly taking into account the in-house\nexpertise available within the bank as per the investment policy approved by the\nBoard of Directors subject to compliance with the risk management and internal\ncontrol systems indicated below.\nc) Banks may also make investment in units of UTI and SEBI - approved other\ndiversified mutual funds with good track records as per the investment policy\napproved by the Board of Directors.  Such investments should be in specific schemes\nof  UTI / Mutual Funds  and not by way of placement of funds with UTI / Mutual\nFunds for investment in the capital market on their behalf.\nd) Underwriting commitments taken up by the banks in respect of primary issues\nthrough book building route would also be within the above overall ceiling.\ne) Investment in equity shares and convertible bonds and debentures of corporate entities\nshould as hitherto, be reckoned for the purpose of arriving at the prudential norm of\nsingle-borrower and borrower-group exposure ceilings.\n1.3 General\n1.3.1  Reconciliation of holdings of Govt. securities, etc.\nBanks should  furnish  to the Reserve Bank the statement of the reconciliation of bank's\ninvestments (held in own Investment account, as also under PMS) as at the end of every\naccounting  year  duly certified by the bank's auditors.  Further, the statement should reach\nReserve Bank within one month from the close of the accounting year.  The aforementioned\nrequirement of reconciliation may be suitably included by banks in the letters of appointment\nwhich may be issued to the bank's external auditors, in future.  The format for the statement\nand the instructions for compiling thereto are given in  Annexure V .\n1.3.2  Transactions in securities - Custodial functions\nWhile exercising the custodial functions on behalf of their merchant banking subsidiaries,\nthese functions should be subject to the same procedures and safeguards as would be\napplicable to other constituents. Accordingly, full particulars should be available with the\nsubsidiaries of banks of the manner in which the transactions have been executed.  BanksRBI_MC_INV_200314should also issue suitable instructions in this regard to the department/office undertaking the\ncustodial functions on behalf of their subsidiaries.\n1.3.3   Portfolio Management on behalf of clients\ni) The general powers vested in banks to operate PMS and similar  schemes  have been\nwithdrawn.  No bank should, therefore, restart or introduce any  new  PMS or similar scheme\nin future without  obtaining  specific  prior approval of the Reserve Bank.\nii) The  following  conditions are to be strictly observed  by  the  banks operating  PMS\nor similar scheme with the specific prior  approval  of  RBI:\n(a) PMS    should  be  entirely  at  the  customer's   risk,   without  guaranteeing,\neither  directly or indirectly,  a  pre-determined  return.\n(b) Funds  should  not  be accepted for portfolio  management  for  a  period less than\none year.\n(c) Portfolio  funds  should  not be deployed for  lending  in  call/  notice  money,\ninter-bank term deposits and  bills  rediscounting  markets and lending\nto/placement with corporate bodies.\n(d) Banks  should  maintain  clientwise  account/record  of   funds  accepted  for\nmanagement and investments made thereagainst  and the  portfolio clients should\nbe entitled to get a  statement  of  account.\n(e) Bank's  own investments and investments belonging to PMS  clients should  be\nkept distinct from each other, and  any  transactions  between  the  bank's\ninvestment account  and  client's  portfolio  account should be strictly at market\nrates.\n(f) There  should be a clear functional separation of trading  and  back  office\nfunctions relating to banks\u2019 own investment  accounts  and  PMS clients'\naccounts.\niii) PMS  clients' accounts should be subjected by banks to a separate  audit by external\nauditors as covered in paragraph 1.2.5 ( i) (a).\niv) Banks should note that violation of RBI's instructions will be viewed seriously and\nwill invite deterrent action against the banks which will include raising of reserve\nrequirements, withdrawal of  facility of  refinance  from  the Reserve Bank and denial\nof  access  to  money markets,  apart  from  prohibiting  the  banks  from  undertaking\nPMS  activity.\nv) Further, the aforesaid instructions will apply, mutatis mutandis,  to   the subsidiaries of\nbanks except where they are contrary to  specific  regulations  of the Reserve Bank or\nthe Securities and Exchange  Board  of India, governing their operations.\nvi) Banks/ merchant  banking  subsidiaries of  banks  operating  PMS  or similar scheme\nwith the specific prior approval of the RBI are also required  to  comply  with the\nguidelines contained  in  the  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers)  Rules and Regulations,\n1993 and those issued from  time  to  time.\n1.3.4 Investment Portfolio of banks - transactions in Government SecuritiesRBI_MC_INV_200315In the light of fraudulent transactions in the guise of Government securities transactions in\nphysical format by a few co-operative banks with the help of some broker entities, it has been\ndecided to accelerate the measures for further reducing the scope of trading in physical forms.\nThese measures are as under:\n(i) For banks which do not have SGL account with RBI, only one CSGL\naccount can be opened.\n(ii) In case the CSGL accounts are opened with a scheduled commercial bank,\nthe account holder has to open a designated funds account (for all CSGL\nrelated transactions) with the same bank.\n(iii) The entities maintaining the CSGL / designated funds accounts will be\nrequired to ensure availability of clear funds in the designated funds\naccounts for purchases and of sufficient securities in the CSGL account for\nsales before putting through the transactions.\n(iv) No transactions by the bank should be undertaken in physical form with any\nbroker.\n(v) Banks should ensure that brokers approved for transacting in Government\nsecurities are registered with the debt market segment of NSE/ BSE/ OTCEI.\n2. Classification\ni) The entire investment portfolio of the banks (including SLR securities and non- SLR\nsecurities) should  be classified under three categories viz. \u2018Held to Maturity\u2019,\n\u2018Available for Sale\u2019 and \u2018Held for Trading\u2019. However,  in the balance sheet, the\ninvestments will continue to be disclosed as per the existing six classifications viz.   a )\nGovernment securities, b) Other approved securities, c) Shares, d) Debentures &\nBonds, e) Subsidiaries/ joint ventures and f) Others ( CP, Mutual Fund Units, etc.).\nii) Banks should decide the category of the investment at the time of acquisition and the\ndecision should be recorded on the investment proposals.\n2.1 Held to Maturity\ni) The securities acquired by the banks with the intention to hold them up to maturity\nwill be classified under Held to Maturity .\nii) The investments included under 'Held to Maturity' should not exceed 25 per cent of\nthe bank\u2019s total investments. The banks may include, at their discretion, under 'Held\nto Maturity' category securities less than 25 per cent of total investment.\niii) The following investments will be classified under \u2018Held to Maturity\u2019 but will not be\ncounted for the purpose of ceiling of 25% specified for this category:RBI_MC_INV_200316a) Re-capitalisation bonds received from the Government of India towards their re-\ncapitalisation requirement and held in their investment portfolio. This will not include\nre-capitalisation bonds of other banks acquired for    investment purposes.\nb) Investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures. [A joint venture would be one in which\nthe bank, along with its subsidiaries, holds more than 25% of the equity.]\nc) The investments in debentures/ bonds, which are deemed to be in the nature of an\nadvance.\nDebentures/ bonds  must be treated in the nature of an advance when:\n\u2022 The debenture/bond is issued as part of the proposal for project finance and the\ntenure of the debenture is for a period of three years and above\nor\nThe debenture/bond is issued as part of the proposal for working capital finance\nand the tenure of the debenture/ bond is less than a period of one year\nand\n\u2022 the bank has a significant stake i.e.10% or more in the issue\nand\n\u2022 the issue is part of a private placement, i.e. the borrower has approached the\nbank/FI and not part of a public issue where the bank/FI has subscribed in\nresponse to an invitation.\nThe debentures/ bonds deemed to be in the nature of advance will be subject to the\nusual prudential norms applicable to advances.\niv) Profit on sale of investments in this category should be first taken to the Profit & Loss\nAccount and thereafter be appropriated to the \u2018Capital Reserve Account\u2019. Loss on sale\nwill be recognised in the Profit & Loss Account.\n2.2 Available for Sale & Held for Trading\ni) The securities acquired by the banks with the intention to trade by taking advantage of\nthe short-term price/ interest rate movements will be classified under Held for\nTrading .\nii) The securities which do not fall within the above two categories will be classified\nunder Available for Sale\niii) The banks will have the freedom to decide on the extent of holdings under Available\nfor Sale and Held for Trading categories. This will be decided by them after\nconsidering various aspects such as basis of intent, trading strategies, risk\nmanagement capabilities, tax planning, manpower skills, capital position.\niv) The investments classified under Held for Trading category would be those from\nwhich the bank expects to make a gain by the movement in the interest rates/ market\nrates. These securities are to be sold within 90 days.RBI_MC_INV_200317v) Profit or loss on sale of investments in both the categories will be taken to the Profit\n& Loss Account.\n2.3    Shifting  among categories\ni) Banks may shift investments to/from Held to Maturity  category with the approval of\nthe Board of Directors once a year.  Such shifting will normally be allowed at the\nbeginning of the accounting year. No further shifting to/ from this category will be\nallowed during the remaining part of that accounting year.\nii) Banks may shift investments from Available for Sale category to Held for Trading\ncategory with the approval of their Board of Directors/ ALCO/ Investment\nCommittee. In case of exigencies, such shifting may be done with the approval of the\nChief Executive of the bank/ Head of the ALCO, but should be ratified by the Board\nof Directors/ ALCO.\niii) Shifting of investments from Held for Trading category to Available for Sale category\nis generally not allowed.  However, it will be permitted only under exceptional\ncircumstances like not being able to sell the security within 90 days due to tight\nliquidity conditions, or extreme volatility, or market becoming unidirectional. Such\ntransfer is permitted only with the approval of the Board of Directors/ ALCO/\nInvestment Committee.\niv) Transfer of scrips from one category to another, under all circumstances, should be\ndone at the acquisition cost/ book value/ market value on the date of transfer,\nwhichever is the least, and the depreciation, if any, on such transfer should be fully\nprovided for.\n3.     Valuation\n3.1 Held to Maturity\ni) Investments classified under Held to Maturity category need not be marked to market\nand will be carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the face value, in which\ncase the premium should be amortised over the period remaining to maturity.\nii) Banks should recognise any diminution, other than temporary, in the value of their\ninvestments in subsidiaries/ joint ventures which are included under Held to Maturity\ncategory and provide therefor. Such diminution should be determined and provided for\neach investment individually.\n3.2 Available for Sale\ni)  The individual scrips in the  Available for Sale category will be marked to market at the\nquarterly or at more frequent intervals. While the net depreciation under each classification\nreferred to in item 2( i) above should be recognised and fully provided for, the netRBI_MC_INV_200318appreciation under each classification referred to in item 2( i) above should be ignored. The\nbook value of the individual securities would not undergo any change after the revaluation.\n[Note: Securities under this category shall be valued scrip-wise and depreciation/\nappreciation shall be aggregated for each classification referred to in item 2( i) above.\nNet depreciation, if any, shall be provided for. Net appreciation, if any, should be\nignored. Net depreciation required to be provided for in any one classification should\nnot be reduced on account of net appreciation in any other classification.]\nii)  The provisions required to be created on account of depreciation in the Available for Sale\ncategory in any year should be debited to the Profit & Loss Account and an equivalent\namount (net of tax benefit, if any, and net of consequent reduction in the transfer to Statutory\nReserve)  or the balance available in the Investment Fluctuation Reserve Account, whichever\nis less, shall be transferred from the Investment Fluctuation Reserve Account to the Profit &\nLoss Account. In the event provisions created on account of depreciation in the Available for\nSale category are found to be in excess of the required amount in any year, the excess should\nbe credited to the Profit & Loss Account and an equivalent amount (net of taxes, if any, and\nnet of transfer to Statutory Reserves as applicable to such excess provision) should be\nappropriated to the Investment Fluctuation Reserve Account to be utilised to meet future\ndepreciation requirement for investments in this category. The amounts debited to the Profit\n& Loss Account for provision and the amount credited to the Profit & Loss Account for\nreversal of excess provision should be debited and credited respectively under the head\n\u201cExpenditure \u2013 Provisions & Contingencies\u201d. The amounts appropriated from the Profit &\nLoss Account and the amount transferred from the Investment Fluctuation Reserve to the\nProfit & Loss Account should be shown as \u2018below the line\u2019 items after determining the profit\nfor the year.\n3.3 Held for Trading\nThe individual scrips in the Held for Trading category will be marked to market at monthly or\nat more frequent intervals as in the case of those in the Available for Sale category. The book\nvalue of the individual securities in this category would not undergo any change after\nmarking to market.\n3.4 Investment Fluctuation Reserve\n(i) With a view to building up of adequate  reserves to guard against  any possible\nreversal of interest rate environment in future due to unexpected developments,\nbanks are advised to build up  Investment Fluctuation Reserve ( IFR) of a\nminimum 5 per cent of the investment portfolio within a period of 5 years. IFR\nshould be computed with reference to investments in two categories, viz., \u201cHeld\nfor Trading\u201d and \u201cAvailable for Sale\u201d.  It will not be necessary to include\ninvestment under \u201cHeld to Maturity\u201d category for the purpose of computation of\nIFR. However, banks are free to build up a higher percentage of IFR up to 10 per\ncent of the portfolio depending on the size and composition of their portfolio, with\nthe approval of their Board of Directors.\n(ii) Banks should transfer maximum amount of the gains realized on sale of\ninvestment in securities to the IFR.RBI_MC_INV_200319(iii) The IFR, consisting of realized gains from the sale of investments from the two\ncategories, viz., \u201cHeld for Trading\u201d and \u201cAvailable for Sale\u201d, would be eligible\nfor inclusion in Tier 2 capital as hitherto.\n(iv) Transfer to IFR shall be as an appropriation of net profit \u201cbelow the line\u201d after\nappropriation to statutory reserve.\n3.5  General\n3.5.1  The equity  shares in  the bank's portfolio should be marked  to market preferably on a\ndaily basis, but at least on a weekly basis.\n3.5.2   In respect of securities included in any of the three categories where interest/ principal\nis in arrears, the banks should not reckon income on the securities and should also make\nappropriate provisions for the depreciation in the value of the investment. The banks should\nnot set-off the depreciation requirement in respect of these non-performing securities against\nthe appreciation in respect of other performing securities .\n 3.6   Market value\nThe \u2018market value\u2019 for the purpose of periodical valuation of investments included in the\nAvailable for Sale and the Held for Trading categories would be the market price of the scrip\nas available from the trades/ quotes on the stock exchanges, SGL  account transactions, price\nlist of RBI, prices declared by Primary Dealers Association of India ( PDAI ) jointly with the\nFixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India ( FIMMDA ) periodically.\nIn respect of unquoted securities , the procedure as detailed below should be adopted.\n3.7   Unquoted SLR securities\n3.7.1 Central Government Securities\ni) The Reserve Bank of India will not announce the YTM rates for unquoted Government\nsecurities, as hitherto, for the purpose of valuation of investments by banks. The banks should\nvalue the unquoted Central Government securities on the basis of the prices/ YTM rates put\nout by the PDAI/ FIMMDA at periodical intervals.\nii)  The 6.00 per cent Capital Indexed Bonds may be valued at \u201ccost\u201d as defined in circular\nDBOD. NO.BC.8/12.02.001 / 97-98 dated January 22, 1998 and BC.18/12.02.001/2000-2001\ndated August 16, 2000.\niii) Treasury Bills should be valued at carrying cost.\n3.7.2 State Government Securities\nState Government securities will be valued applying the YTM method by marking it up by 25\nbasis points above the yields of the Central Government Securities of equivalent maturity put\nout by PDAI/ FIMMDA periodically.RBI_MC_INV_2003203.7.3 Other \u2018approved\u2019 Securities\nOther approved securities will be valued applying the YTM method by marking it up by 25\nbasis points above the yields of the Central Government Securities of equivalent maturity put\nout by PDAI/ FIMMDA periodically.\n 3.8 Unquoted Non- SLR securities\n3.8.1 Debentures/ Bonds\nAll debentures/ bonds other than debentures/ bonds which are in the nature of advance should\nbe valued on the YTM basis.  Such debentures/ bonds may be of different companies having\ndifferent ratings. These will be valued with appropriate mark-up over the YTM  rates for\nCentral Government securities as put out by PDAI/ FIMMDA periodically. The mark-up will\nbe graded according to the ratings assigned to the debentures/ bonds by the rating agencies\nsubject to the following: -\n(a) The rate used for the YTM for rated debentures/ bonds should be at least 50 basis\npoints above the rate applicable to a Government of India loan of equivalent\nmaturity.\n(b) The rate used for the YTM for unrated debentures/ bonds should not be less than\nthe rate applicable to rated debentures/ bonds of equivalent maturity. The mark-up\nfor the unrated debentures/ bonds should appropriately reflect the credit risk borne\nby the bank.\n(c) Where interest/ principal on the debenture/ bonds is in arrears, the provision\nshould be made for the debentures as in the case of debentures/ bonds treated as\nadvances. The depreciation/ provision requirement towards debentures where the\ninterest is in arrears or principal is not paid as per due date, shall not be allowed to\nbe set-off against appreciation against other debentures/ bonds.\nWhere the debenture/ bonds is quoted and there have been transactions within 15 days prior\nto the valuation date, the value adopted should not be higher than the rate at which the\ntransaction is recorded on the stock exchange.\n3.8.2 Preference Shares\nThe valuation of preference shares should be on YTM basis. The preference shares will be\nissued by companies with different ratings. These will be valued with appropriate mark-up\nover the YTM rates for Central Government securities put out by the PDAI/ FIMMDA\nperiodically. The mark-up  will be graded according to the ratings assigned to the preference\nshares by the rating agencies subject to the following:\na) The YTM rate should not be lower than the coupon rate/ YTM for a GOI loan of\nequivalent maturity.RBI_MC_INV_200321b) The rate used for the YTM for unrated preference shares should not be less than\nthe rate applicable to rated preference shares of equivalent maturity. The mark-up\nfor the unrated preference shares should appropriately reflect the credit risk borne\nby the bank.\nc) Investments in preference shares as part of the project finance may be valued at\npar for a period of two years after commencement of production or five years after\nsubscription whichever is earlier.\nd) Where investment in preference shares is as part of rehabilitation, the YTM rate\nshould not be lower than 1.5% above the coupon rate/ YTM for GOI loan of\nequivalent maturity.\ne) Where preference dividends are in arrears, no credit should be taken for accrued\ndividends and the value determined on YTM should be discounted by at least 15%\nif arrears are for one year, and more if arrears are for more than one year. The\ndepreciation/ provision requirement arrived at in the above manner in respect of\nnon-performing shares where dividends are in arrears shall not be allowed to be\nset-off against appreciation on other performing preference shares.\nf) The preference share should not be valued above its redemption value.\ng) When a preference share has been traded on stock exchange within 15 days prior\nto the valuation date, the value should not be higher than the price at which the\nshare was traded.\n3.8.3  Equity Shares\nEquity shares for which current quotations are not available or where the shares are not\nquoted on the stock exchanges, should be valued at break-up value (without considering\n\u2018revaluation reserves\u2019, if any) which is to be ascertained from the company\u2019s latest balance\nsheet (which should not be more than one year prior to the date of valuation). In case the\nlatest balance sheet is not available the shares are to be valued at Re.1 per company.\n3.8.4 Mutual Funds Units\nInvestment in quoted Mutual Fund Units should be valued as per Stock Exchange quotations.\nInvestment in non-quoted Mutual Fund Units is to be valued on the basis of the latest re-\npurchase price declared by the Mutual Fund in respect of each particular Scheme. In case of\nfunds with a lock-in period, where repurchase price/ market quote is not available, Units\ncould be valued at NAV.  If NAV is not available, then these could be valued at cost, till the\nend of the lock-in period. Wherever the re-purchase price is not available the Units could be\nvalued at the NAV of the respective scheme.\n3.8.5 Commercial Paper\nCommercial paper should be valued at the carrying cost.RBI_MC_INV_2003223.8.6 Investments in RRBs\nInvestment in RRBs is to be valued at Carrying Cost (i.e. book value) on consistent basis.\n3.9. Investment in debentures / bonds / security receipts / Pass-through certificates\nissued by the Securitisation Company ( SC) / Reconstruction Company (RC).\n3.9.1 Provisioing / valuation norms\nWhen banks / FIs invest in the security receipts / pass-through certificates issued by SC / RC\nin respect of the financial assets sold by them to the SC / RC, the sale shall be recognised in\nbooks of the banks / FIs at the lower of:\n\u2022 the redemption value of the security receipts / pass-through certificates, and\n\u2022 the NBV of the financial asset.\nThe above investment should be carried in the books of the bank / FI at the price as\ndetermined above until its sale or realisation, and on such sale or realisation, the loss or gain\nmust be dealt with as under:\n(i) if the sale to SC /RC is at a price below the net book value ( NBV) ( ie. Book value\nless provisions held), the shortfall should be debited to the profit and loss account of\nthat year.\n(ii) If the sale is for a value higher than the NBV, the excess provision will not be\nreversed but will be utilised to meet the shortfall / loss on account of sale of other\nfinancial assets to SC / RC.\nAll instruments received by banks / FIs from SC / RC as sale consideration for financial\nassets sold to them and also other instruments issued by SC / RC in which banks / FIs invest\nwill be in the nature of non- SLR securities. Accordingly, the valuation, classification and\nother norms applicable to investment in non- SLR instruments prescribed by RBI from time to\ntime would be applicable to bank\u2019s / FI\u2019s investment in debentures / bonds / security receipts\n/ PTCs issued by SC / RC. However, if any of the above instruments issued by SC / RC is\nlimited to the actual realisation of the financial assets assigned to the instruments in the\nconcerned scheme the bank / FI shall reckon the Net Asset Value ( NAV ), obtained from SC /\nRC from time to time, for valuation of such investments.\n4. Uniform accounting for Repo / Reverse Repo transactions.\n4.1 In order to ensure uniform accounting treatment for accounting repo / reverse repo\ntransactions and to impart an element of transparency, uniform accounting principles, have\nbeen laid down for repo / reverse repo transactions undertaken by all the regulated entities.\nHowever, for the present, these norms would not apply to repo / reverse repo transactions\nunder the Liquidity Adjustment Facility ( LAF) with RBI.RBI_MC_INV_2003234.2  The uniform accounting principles will be applicable from the financial year 2003-04.\nOn implementation, market participants may undertake repos from any of the three categories\nof investments, viz., Held For Trading , Available For Sale  and Held To Maturity .\n4.3. The legal character of repo under the current law , viz. as outright purchase and\noutright sale transactions will be kept intact by ensuring that the securities sold under repo\n(the entity selling referred to as \u201cseller\u201d) are excluded from the Investment Account of the\nseller of securities  and the securities bought under reverse repo (the entity buying referred to\nas \u201cbuyer\u201d )  are included in the Investment Account of  the buyer of securities. Further, the\nbuyer can reckon the approved securities acquired under reverse repo transaction for the\npurpose of Statutory Liquidity Ratio ( SLR) during the period of the repo.\n4. 4. At present repo transactions are permitted in Central Government securities including\nTreasury Bills and dated State Government securities. Since the buyer of the securities will\nnot hold it till maturity, the securities purchased under reverse repo by banks should not be\nclassified under Held to Maturity  category. The first leg of the repo should be contracted at\nprevailing market rates. Further, the accrued interest received / paid in a repo / reverse repo\ntransaction and the clean price (i.e. total cash consideration less accrued interest) should be\naccounted for separately and distinctly.\n4. 5. The other accounting principles to be followed while accounting for repos / reverse\nrepos will be as under:\n4.5.1 Coupon\nIn case the interest payment date of the security offered under repo falls within the repo\nperiod, the coupons received by the buyer of the security should be passed on to the seller on\nthe date of receipt  as the cash consideration payable by the seller in the second leg does not\ninclude any intervening cash flows. While the buyer will book the coupon during the period\nof the repo , the seller will not accrue  the coupon during the period of the repo. In the case of\ndiscounted instruments like Treasury Bills, since there is no coupon, the seller will continue\nto accrue the discount at the original discount rate during the period of the repo. The buyer\nwill not therefore accrue the discount during the period of the repo.\n4.5.2  Repo Interest Income / Expenditure\nAfter the second leg of the repo / reverse repo transaction is over ,\n(a) the difference in the clean price of the security between the first leg and the second leg\nshould be reckoned as Repo Interest Income  / Expenditure in the books of the  buyer /\nseller respectively;\n(b) the difference between the accrued interest paid between the two legs of the transaction\nshould be shown as Repo Interest Income/ Expenditure account, as the case may be; and\n(c) the balance outstanding in the Repo interest Income / Expenditure account should be\ntransferred to the Profit and Loss account as an income or an expenditure .\nAs regards repo / reverse repo transactions outstanding on the balance sheet  date, only the\naccrued income / expenditure till the balance sheet date  should be taken to the Profit andRBI_MC_INV_200324Loss account.  Any repo income / expenditure for the subsequent period in respect of the\noutstanding transactions should be reckoned for the next accounting period.\n4.5.3 Marking to Market\nThe buyer will mark to market the securities acquired under reverse repo transactions as per\nthe investment classification of the security . To illustrate, for banks, in case the securities\nacquired under reverse repo transactions have been classified under Available for Sale\ncategory, then the mark to market valuation for such securities should be done at least once a\nquarter. For entities who do not follow any investment classification norms, the valuation for\nsecurities acquired under reverse repo transactions may be in accordance with the valuation\nnorms followed by them in respect of securities of similar nature.\nIn respect of the repo transactions outstanding  as on the balance sheet date\n(a) the buyer will mark to market the securities on the balance sheet date and will account for\nthe same as laid down in the extant valuation guidelines issued by the respective\nregulatory departments of RBI.\n(b) the seller will provide for the price difference in the Profit & Loss account and show this\ndifference under \u201cOther Assets\u201d in the balance sheet if the sale price of the security\noffered under repo is lower than the the book value.\n(c) the seller will ignore the price difference for the purpose of Profit & Loss account but\nshow the difference under \u201cOther Liabilities\u201d  in in the Balance Sheet, if  the sale price of\nthe security offered under repo is higher than the book value; and\n(d) similarly the accrued interest paid / received in the repo / reverse repo transactions\noutstanding on balance sheet dates  should be shown as \"Other Assets\" or \"Other\nLiabilities\" in the balance sheet.\n4.5.4 Book value on re-purchase\nThe seller shall debit the repo account with the original book value (as existing in the books\non the date of the first leg) on buying back the securities in the second leg.\n4.5.5  Disclosure\nThe disclosures to be made by banks in the \u201cNotes on Accounts\u2019 to the Balance Sheet is\ngiven in Annexure. VI.\n4.5.6 Accounting methodology\nThe accounting methodology to be followed are given below and illustrations are furnished in\nAnnexure VII. While market participants, having different accounting systems, may use\naccounting heads different from those used in the illustration, there should not be any\ndeviation from the accounting principles enunciated above. Further, to obviate disputesRBI_MC_INV_200325arising out of repo transactions, the participants may consider entering into bilateral Master\nRepo Agreement as per the documentation finalized by FIMMDA.\n4.5.7 Recommended Accounting Methodology for Uniform Accounting of    Repo /\nReverse Repo transactions\na. The following accounts may be opened, viz. i) Repo Account, ii) Repo Price\nAdjustment Account, iii) Repo Interest Adjustment Account, iv) Repo Interest\nExpenditure Account, v) Repo Interest Income Account, vi) Reverse Repo Account,\nvii) Reverse Repo Price Adjustment Account, and viii) Reverse Repo Interest\nAdjustment Account.\nb. The securities sold/ purchased under repo should be accounted for as an outright sale /\npurchase.\nc. The securities should enter and exit the books at the same book value. For operational\nease the weighted average cost method whereby the investment is carried in the books\nat their weighted average cost may be adopted.\nRepo\nd. In a repo transaction, the securities should be sold in the first leg at market related\nprices and re-purchased in the second leg at the derived price. The sale and repurchase\nshould be accounted in the Repo Account.\ne. The balances in the Repo Account should be netted from the bank's Investment\nAccount for balance sheet purposes.\nf. The difference between the market price and the book value in the first leg of the repo\nshould be booked in Repo Price Adjustment Account. Similarly the difference\nbetween the derived price and the book value in the second leg of the repo should be\nbooked in the Repo Price Adjustment Account.\nReverse repo\ng. In a reverse repo transaction, the securities should be purchased in the first leg at\nprevailing market prices and sold in the second leg at the derived price. The purchase\nand sale should be accounted for in the Reverse Repo Account.\nh. The balances in the Reverse Repo Account should be part of the Investment Account\nfor balance sheet purposes and can be reckoned for SLR purposes if the securities\nacquired under reverse repo transactions are approved securities.\ni. The security purchased in a reverse repo will enter the books at the market price\n(excluding broken period interest). The difference between the derived price and the\nbook value in the second leg of the reverse repo should be booked in the Reverse\nRepo Price Adjustment Account.RBI_MC_INV_200326Other aspects relating to Repo / Reverse Repo\nj. In case the interest payment date of the security offered under repo falls within the\nrepo period, the coupons received by the buyer of the security should be passed on to\nthe seller on the date of receipt as the cash consideration payable by the seller in the\nsecond leg does not include any intervening cash flows.\nk. The difference between the amounts booked in the first and second legs in the Repo /\nReverse Repo Price Adjustment Account should be transferred to the Repo Interest\nExpenditure Account or Repo Interest Income Account, as the case may be.\nl. The broken period interest accrued in the first and second legs will be booked in Repo\nInterest Adjustment Account or Reverse Repo Interest Adjustment Account, as the\ncase may be. Consequently the difference between the amounts booked in this\naccount in the first and second legs should be transferred to the Repo Interest\nExpenditure Account or Repo Interest Income Account, as the case may be.\nm. At the end of the accounting period the, for outstanding repos  , the balances in  the\nRepo / Reverse Repo  Price Adjustment Account  and Repo / Reverse repo Interest\nAdjustment account  should be reflected   either under  item VI - 'Others' under\nSchedule 11 - 'Other Assets' or  under item IV 'Others (including Provisions)' under\nSchedule 5 - 'Other Liabilities and Provisions' in the Balance Sheet , as the case may\nbe .\nn. Since the debit balances in the Repo Price Adjustment Account at the end of the\naccounting period represent losses not provided for in respect of securities offered in\noutstanding repo transactions, it will be necessary to make a provision therefor in the\nProfit & Loss Account.\no. To reflect the accrual of interest in respect of the outstanding repo/ reverse repo\ntransactions at the end of the accounting period, appropriate entries should be passed\nin the Profit and Loss account to reflect Repo Interest Income  / Expenditure in the\nbooks of the buyer / seller respectively and the same should be debited / credited as an\nincome / expenditure accrued but not due. Such entries passed should be reversed on\nthe first working day of the next accounting period.\np. In respect of repos in interest bearing (coupon) instruments, the buyer would accrue\ninterest during the period of repo. In respect of repos in discount instruments like\nTreasury Bills, the seller would accrue discount during the period of repo based on the\noriginal yield at the time of acquisition.\nq. At the end of the accounting period the debit balances (excluding balances for repos\nwhich are still outstanding) in the Repo Interest Adjustment Account and Reverse\nRepo Interest Adjustment Account should be transferred to the Repo Interest\nExpenditure Account and the credit balances (excluding balances for repos  which are\nstill outstanding) in the Repo Interest Adjustment Account and Reverse Repo Interest\nAdjustment Account should be transferred to the Repo Interest Income Account.RBI_MC_INV_200327r. Similarly, at the end of accounting period, the debit balances (excluding balances for\nrepos which are still outstanding) in the Repo / Reverse Repo  Price Adjustment\nAccount should be transferred to the Repo Interest Expenditure Account and the\ncredit balances (excluding balances for repos which are still outstanding) in the Repo /\nReverse Repo  Price Adjustment Account should be transferred to the Repo Interest\nIncome Account.\n5. General\n5.1 Income recognition\ni) Banks may book income on accrual basis on securities of corporate bodies/ public\nsector undertakings in respect of which the payment of interest and repayment of\nprincipal have been guaranteed by the Central Government or a State Government,\nprovided interest is serviced regularly and as such is not in arrears.\nii) Banks may book income from dividend on shares of corporate bodies on accrual basis\nprovided dividend on the shares has been declared by the corporate body in its Annual\nGeneral Meeting and the owner's right to receive payment is established.\niii) Banks may book income from Government securities and bonds and debentures of\ncorporate bodies on accrual basis, where interest rates on these instruments are pre-\ndetermined and provided interest is serviced regularly and is not in arrears.\niv) Banks should book income from units of mutual funds on cash basis.\n5.2 Broken Perio d Interest\nBanks should not capitalise the Broken Period Interest paid to seller as part of  cost, but treat\nit as an item of expenditure under Profit and Loss Account in respect of investments in\nGovernment and other approved securities. It is to be noted that the above accounting\ntreatment does not take into account taxation implications and hence the banks should\ncomply with the requirements of Income Tax Authorities in the manner prescribed by them.\n5.3 Dematerialised Holding\n Banks have been advised to settle the transactions in securities as notified by Securities and\nExchange Board of India ( SEBI) only through depositories.  Banks were also advised that\nafter the commencement of mandatory trading in demat form, they would not be able to sell\nthe shares of listed companies if they were held in physical form.  In order to extend the\ndemat  form of holding to other instruments like bond, debentures and equities, it was decided\nthat, with effect from October 31, 2001, banks, FIs, PDs and SDs will be permitted to make\nfresh investments and hold bonds and debentures, privately placed or otherwise, only in\ndematerialized form.  Outstanding investments in scrip forms shall have to be converted into\ndematerialized form by June 30, 2002.  As regards equity instruments, they will be permitted\nto be held by the above-mentioned institutions only in dematerialized form, from a date to be\nnotified in consultation with SEBI.RBI_MC_INV_200328Annexures\nAnnexure \u2013 I\nAnnexure \u2013 II\nAnnexure \u2013 III\nAnnexure \u2013 IV\nAnnexure \u2013 V\nAnnexure \u2013 VI\nAnnexure \u2013 VII\nANNEXURE \u2013 I\nPara 1.2 ( i) (a)\nInvestment portfolio of banks \u2013 Transactions in securities \u2013 Conditions subject to which\nsecurities allotted in the auctions for primary issues can be sold\ni) The contract for sale can be entered into only once by the allottee bank on the basis of\nan authenticated allotment advice issued by Reserve Bank of India.

The year should be calendar year or\nfinancial year?Since banks close their accounts at the\nend of March, it may be more convenient\nto follow the financial year.  However,\nthe banks may follow calendar year or\nany other period of 12 months provided,\nit is consistently followed in future.\n2. Whether the limit is to be observed\nwith reference to total transactions of\nthe previous year as the total\ntransactions of the current year would\nbe known only at the end of the year?The limit has to be observed with\nreference to the year under review.\nWhile operating the limit the bank should\nkeep in view the expected turnover of the\ncurrent year which may be based on\nturnover of the previous year and\nanticipated rise or fall in the volume of\nbusiness in the current year.\n3. Whether to arrive at the total\ntransactions of the year, transa-ctionsNot necessary.  However, if there are any\ndirect deals with the brokers asRBI_MC_INV_200331entered into directly with counter\nparties i.e. where no bro-kers are\ninvolved would also be taken into\naccount?purchasers or sellers the same would\nhave to be included in the total\ntransactions to arrive at the limit of\ntransactions to be done through an\nindividual broker.\n4. Whether in case of ready forward deals\nboth the legs of the deals i.e. purchase\nas well as sale will be included to\narrive at the volume of total\ntransactions?Yes.  This is, however, only theoretical\nas R/F transactions in Govt. securities are\nnow prohibited except in Treasury Bills\nand specified Govt. Securities\n5. Whether central loan/state loan/\ntreasury  bills etc. purchased through\ndirect subscriptions/auction will be\nincluded in the volume of total\ntransactions?No, as brokers are not involved as\nintermidiaries.\n6. It is possible that even though bank\nconsiders that a particular broker has\ntouched the prescribed limit of 5% he\nmay come with an offer during the\nremaining period of the year which the\nbank may find it to be to its advantage\nas compared to offers received from the\nother brokers who have not yet done\nbusiness upto the prescribed limit.If the offer received is more\nadvantageous the limit for the broker\nmay be exceeded, the reasons therefor\nand approval of the competent\nauthority/Board obtained post facto.\n7. Whether the transaction conducted on\nbehalf of the clients would also be\nincluded in the total transactions of the\nyear?Yes.  If they are conducted through the\nbrokers.\n8. For a bank which rarely deals through\nbrokers and consequently the volume\nof business is small maintaining the\nbrokerwise limit of 5% may mean\nsplitting the orders in small values\namongst different brokers and there\nmay also arise price differential.There may be no need to split an order.\nIf any deal causes the particular broker's\nshare to exceed 5% limit, our circular\nprovides the necessary flexibility\ninasmuch as Board's post facto approval\ncan be obtained\n9. During the course of the year it may\nnot be possible to reasonably predict\nwhat will be the total quantum of\ntransactions through brokers as a result\nof which there could be deviation in\ncomplying with the norm of 5%.The bank may get post facto approval\nfrom the Board after explaining to it the\ncircumstances in which the limit was\nexceeded.\n10. Some of the small private sector banks\nhave mentioned that where the volume\nof business particularly the transactions\ndone  through brokers is small the\nobservance of 5% limit may beAs already observed, the limit of 5% can\nbe exceeded subject to reporting the\ntransactions to the competent authority\npost facto.

Execution of Trust\nDeed and charge documents will be completed and debentures certificates will be\ndespatched within the time limit laid down in the Companies Act but not exceeding in\nany case, 6 months from the date of the subscription agreement.\n(b) In case of delay in complying with the above, the company will refund the amount of\nsubscription with agreed rate of interest, or, will pay penal interest of 2% over the\ncoupon rate till the above conditions are complied with, at the option of the bank.\n(c) Pending creation of security, during the period of 6 months (or extended period), the\nprincipal Directors of the company should agree to indemnify the bank for any loss\nthat may be suffered by the bank on account of the subscription to their debt issue.\n(This condition will not apply to PSUs).RBI_MC_INV_200334(d) It will be the company\u2019s responsibility to obtain consent of the prior charge-holders\nfor creation of security within the stipulated period.  Individual banks may insist upon\nexecution of subscription agreement or a suitable letter to comply with the terms of\noffer such as appointment of trustee, creation of security etc. on the above lines.\n(e) Rating  : The Group recommends that the extant regulations of SEBI in regard to\nrating of all debt instruments in public offers would be made applicable to private\nplacement also.  This stipulation will also apply to preference shares which are\nredeemable after 18 months.\n(f) Listing : Currently, there is a lot of flexibility regarding listing required by banks in\nprivate placement issues.  However, the Group recommends that listing of companies\nshould be insisted upon, ( exceptions, if any, to this rule shall be provided in the\nInvestment Policy of the banks) which would in due course help develop secondary\nmarket.  The advantage of listing would be  that the listed companies would be\nrequired to disclose information periodically to the Stock Exchanges which would\nalso help develop the secondary markets by way of investor information.  In fact,\nSEBI  has advised all the Stock Exchanges that all listed companies should publish\nunaudited  financial results on a quarterly basis and that they should inform the Stock\nExchanges immediately of all events which would have a bearing on the\nperformance/operations of the company as well as price sensitive information.\n(g) Security / documentation : To ensure that the documentation is completed and\nsecurity is created in time, the Group has made recommendations which is contained\nin this model offer document.  It may be noted that in case of delay in execution of\nTrust Deed and Charge documents, the company will refund the subscription with\nagreed rate of interest or will pay penal interest of 2% over the coupon rate till these\nconditions are complied with at the option of the bank.  Moreover, Principal Directors\nof the company will have to agree to indemnify the bank for any loss that may be\nsuffered by the bank on account of the subscription to the debt issue during the period\nof 6 months (or extended period) pending creation of security.\nANNEXURE V\nPara 1.3.1\nRETURN/STATEMENT NO.  9\nProforma\nStatement showing the position of Reconciliation of Investment\nAccount as on 31st March\nName of the bank/ Institution : _____________________________________\n                                                                                                               (Face value Rs. in crore)\nParticulars of General SGL Balance BRs SGL Actual Outstanding\nsecurities Ledger\nBalanceAs per\nPDO\nbooksAs per\nbank\u2019s/\ninstitu-\ntion\u2019s\nbooksheld Forms\nheldScrips\nhelddeliveries\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.\nI.

Scope:  With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of Government\nsecurities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d basis in select  auctions of\ndated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-competitive bids up to 5 percent  of\nthe notified amount will be accepted in the auctions of dated securities. The reserved amount\nwill be within the notified amount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated GOI\nsecurities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL)\naccount with the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions:  Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks shall be\ncovered under this Scheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single bid for an amount not more than Rs. two crore (face value) per\nauction\n3.  submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks that   maintain\nSGL account and current account with the Reserve Bank of India shall be eligible to\nsubmit their non competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI. The\nminimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in multiples in\nRs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent subsidiary\ngeneral ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish to participate.\nHowever, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An undertaking to the\neffect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be obtained and kept on record\nby the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name,\namount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on the\ndate of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from their clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of notified\namount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be theresponsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a\ntransparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the\nshortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the main\nSGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The facility for\naffording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing investors who\nare not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate clearly at the time\nof tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be credited to their SGL\naccount and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the main SGL account is\npermissible at the instance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to their\nclients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients shall be\ncompleted within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such costs\nmay be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case the transfer of\nsecurities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the consideration amount\npayable by the client to the bank or PD would also include accrued interest from the date of\nissue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities, accrued\ninterest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be worked out\nby the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that no other costs such\nas funding costs should be built into the price or recovered from the client.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to operations under the\nScheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for from time to time within\nthe time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and accordingly, if and\nwhen considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/38704.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Sep 01, 2003", "info": "Tender for Non-competitive Bids\n(Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding Facility in Auctions of Government Securities)\n                                                         Annexure I (a)\n                                                         For office use only\nThe Regional Director,                     |------------------|\nReserve Bank of India,                     | Regn no.          |\nPublic Debt Office,                        |                  |\nFort,                                      |------------------|\nMumbai - 400 001.\nDear Sir,\nTender for Non-competitive Bids for \u201c6.17 per cent Government\nStock 2023\u201d for an aggregate amount of Rs.300 crore: Auction to\nbe held on September 3, 2003.\n    \n        Pursuant to Government of India, Ministry of Finance,\nDepartment of Economic Affairs Notification No F.No.4(8)\nW&M/2003 dated September 1, 2003 and the tender notice issued\nby you, I/we, the undersigned hereby submit an aggregated bid\non behalf of the non-competitive bidders as per the enclosed\nlist in pursuance of the \u2018 Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding\nFacility in the Auctions of Government Securities\u2019 at the\nauction to be held by you on the captioned date as set out\nbelow:\ni)   Name  of the Bank/Primary Dealer  /-------------------\\\nii)   Address                          /-------------------\\\niii)  Telephone No.                    \\-------------------/\niv)\nUnde\nrtak\ning\n1. \nO\nn\n your acceptance of my/our bid,\ni) I/we agree/undertake to immediately collect the letter of\nacceptance from your office and to deposit the requisite\namount at Reserve Bank of India, Fort, Mumbai on the\nday/time as indicated therein.\nii) I/We authorise you to debit my/our Current account\nmaintained with Reserve Bank of India with the requisite\namount.\n2.

Following this, guidelines for setting up of\nLocal Area Banks ( LABs) in the private sector were announced by the Reserve Bank on 24th\nAugust 1996.\n2.As no comprehensive review of the LAB scheme had been made since the issuance of\nguidelines in 1996 ,  a Review Group with outside experts was appointed by RBI in July 2002\nto study and make recommendations on the LAB Scheme. The Review Group has submitted\nits Report on 1st October 2002.\nThe major policy issues raised by the Review Group pertain to :\n(i) Discontinuance of the LAB Scheme\n(ii) Increase in capital base of LABs\n(iii) Higher capital adequacy requirement\n(iv) Transfer of regulatory work in respect of LABs to DBOD.\nThe report of the Review Group was placed on the RBI website on 26th October 2002\ninviting suggestions from different quarters, if any, on the recommendations. The\nrecommendations of the Review Group have been examined by the Department keeping in\nview of the suggestions received and the same was approved by the Government. The new\nchange in policy in this regard is indicated below:\n(i) Licensing of new Local area banks :  The Review Group has suggested specific\nmeasures  to strengthen the  existing LABs so that they  are placed on sound footing  and it\nhas been decided that  in future there should be no licensing of new banks.\n(ii)  Capital base :  LABs with their present capital base of Rs 5 crore cannot become viable\ninstitutions. The existing LABs should be asked to reach net worth of at least Rs.25 crore\nover a period of five to seven years for attaining viability.\n(iii) Capital adequacy :  LABs should maintain a minimum capital adequacy of 15% over a\nperiod of next five to seven years. The higher capital adequacy norm is proposed because\nLABs   carry an inherently high risk port-folio and do not have derisking possibilities.  The\nmatrix proposed by the R.G. - A net worth of Rs.25 crore and capital adequacy norm of 15%\nwould  enable LAB to build an asset base of about Rs.150 crore, a level at which their\noperations would become viable. The LABs may be required to submit a suitable road map\nfor achieving the twin objectives of higher capital base of Rs 25 crore and capital adequacy of\n15% over a period of five to seven years.\n(iv) Regulatory arrangements :  LABs need to be treated like any other commercial bank\nand, therefore, regulation  should be entrusted to the same wing of the RBI ie DBOD  which\nis responsible for regulation and function of supervision of LABs will continue to be with\nDBS.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/38589.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Aug 22, 2003", "info": "Loans and Advances \u2013Statutory and Other Restrictions\nDBOD  No. Dir.

Restrictions on other loans and advances\nAnnexure 1\nAnnexure 2\nAnnexure 3\nAppendix\nMaster Circular on Loans and Advances \u2013 Statutory and Other Restrictions\n1.        Statutory Restrictions\n1.1 Advances against bank's Own Shares\nIn terms of Section 20(1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, a bank cannot grant any\nloans and advances on the security of its own shares.\n1.2 Advances to bank's Di rectorsSection 20(1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 also lays down the restrictions on\nloans and advances to the Directors and the firms in which they hold substantial interest.\n1.2.1 The banks are prohibited from entering into any commitment for gr anting any loans or\nadvances to or on behalf of any of its directors, or any firm in which any of its directors is\ninterested as partner, manager, employee or guarantor, or any company (not being a\nsubsidiary of the banking company or a company registered under Section 25 of the\nCompanies Act, 1956, or a Government company) of which, or the subsidiary or the\nholding company of which any of the directors of the bank is a director, managing agent,\nmanager, employee or guarantor or in which he holds substantial interest, or any\nindividual in respect of whom any of its directors is a partner or guarantor.\n1.2.2  There are certain exemptions in this regard. In the explanation to the Section, \u2018loans or\nadvances\u2019 shall not  include any transaction which the Reserve Bank may specify by\ngeneral or special order as not being a loan or advance for the purpose of this Section.\nWhile doing so the RBI shall, keep in view the nature of the transaction, the period within\nwhich, and the manner and circumstances in which, any amount due on account of the\ntransaction is likely to be realised, the interest of the depositors and other relevant\nconsiderations.\n1.2.3 If any question arises whether any transaction is a loan or advance for the purpose of this\nSection, it shall be referred to RBI, whose decision thereon shall be final.\n1.2.4 For the above purpose, the term 'loans and advances' shall not include  the following:  -\n(a) loans or advances against Government securities, life insurance policies or fixed\ndeposit;.\n(b) loans or advances to the Agricultural Finance Corporation Ltd;\n(c) such loans or advances as can be made by a banking company to any of its\ndirectors (who immediately prior to becoming a director, was an employee of the\nbanking company) in his capacity as an employee of that banking company and\non the same terms and conditions as would have been applicable to him as an\nemployee of that banking company, if he had not become a director of the\nbanking company. The banking company includes every bank to which the\nprovisions of Section 20 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 apply.\n(d) such loans or advances as are granted by the banking company to its Chairman\nand Chief Executive Officer, who was not an employee of the banking company\nimmediately prior to his appointment as Chairman/ Managing Director/ CEO, for\nthe purpose of purchasing a car, personal computer, furniture or constructing/\nacquiring a house for his personal use and Festival Advance, with the prior\napproval of the RBI and on such terms and conditions as may be stipulated by it.\n(e) such loans or advances as are granted by a banking company to its whole-time\ndirector for the purpose of purchasing furniture, car, personal Computer or\nconstructing/acquiring house for personal use, Festival advance with the prior\napproval of RBI and on such terms & conditions as may be stipulated by it.\n(f) call loans made by banking companies to one another.(g) facilities like bills purchased/discounted (whether documentary or clean and sight\nor usance and whether on D/A basis or D/P basis), purchase of cheques, other\nnon-fund based facilities like acceptance/co-acceptance of bills, opening of L/Cs\nand issue of guarantees, purchase of debentures from third parties etc.\nNote:  For obtaining the prior approval of the Reserve Bank as stipulated in clause (d) and\n(e) above, the bank should make an application to the concerned regional office of the\nBank.\n1.2.5 Purchase of or discount of bills from directors and their concerns which is in the nature of\nclean accommodation is reckoned as \u2018loans and advances\u2019 for the purpose of Section 20\nof the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n1.2.6  As regards giving guarantees and opening of L/Cs on behalf of bank\u2019s directors, it is\npertinent to note that in the event of the principal debtor committing default in\ndischarging his liability and the bank being called upon to honour its obligations under\nthe guarantee or L/C, the relationship between the bank and the director could become\none of the creditor and debtor. Further, it is possible for the directors to evade the\nprovisions of Section 20 by borrowing from a third party against the guarantee given by\nthe bank. Such transactions may defeat the very purpose of restrictions imposed under\nSection 20, if the bank does not take appropriate steps to ensure that the liabilities there\nunder do not devolve on them.\n1.2.7 In view of the above, while extending non-fund based facilities such as guarantees, L/Cs,\nacceptance on behalf of directors and the companies/firms in which the directors are\ninterested, it should be ensured that -\n(a) adequate and effective arrangements have been made to the satisfaction of the\nbank that the commitments would be met by the openers of L/Cs, or acceptors, or\nguarantors out of their own resources,\n(b) the bank will not be called upon to grant any loan or advance to meet the liability\nconsequent upon the invocation of guarantee, and\n(c) no liability would devolve on the bank on account of LCs/ acceptances.\n1.2.8 In case, such contingencies arise as at (b) & (c) above, the bank will    be deemed to be a\nparty to the violation of the provisions of Section 20 of the Banking Regulation Act,\n1949.\n1.2.9   Restrictions on Power to Remit Debts\nSection 20A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 stipulates that notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary contained in Section 293 of the Companies Act, 1956, a banking\ncompany shall not, except with the prior approval of the Reserve Bank, remit in whole or\nin part any debt due to it by -\n(a) any of its directors, or\n(b) any firm or company in which any of its directors is interested as director, partner,\nmanaging agent or guarantor, or(c) any individual, if any of its director is his partner or guarantor.\nAny remission made in contravention of the provisions stated above  shall be void and\nhave no effect.\n1.3 Restrictions on Holding Shares in Companies\n1.3.1 In terms of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the banks should not hold\nshares in any company except as provided in sub-section (1) whether as pledgee ,\nmortgagee  or absolute owner , of an amount exceeding 30 percent of the paid-up share\ncapital of that company or 30 percent of its own paid-up share capital and reserves,\nwhichever is less.\n1.3.2 Further, in terms of Section 19(3) of the Banki ng Regulation Act, 1949, the banks should\nnot hold shares whether as pledgee, mortgagee  or absolute owner , in any company in\nthe management of which any managing director or manager of the bank is in any\nmanner concerned or interested.\n1.3.3 Accordingly, w hile granting loans and advances against shares, statutory provisions\ncontained in Sections 19(2) and (3) should be strictly observed.\n1.4 Restrictions on Credit to Companies for Buy-back of their Securities\nIn terms of Section 77A(1) of the Companies Act, 1956, the companies are permitted to\npurchase their own shares or other specified securities out of their\nfree reserves, or\nsecurities premium account, or\nthe proceeds of any shares or other specified securities,\nsubject to compliance of various conditions specified in the Companies (Amendment)\nAct, 1999. Therefore, the banks should not provide loans to companies for buy-back of\nshares/securities.\n2. Regulatory Restrictions\n2.1 Granting loans and advances to relatives of Directors\nWithout prior approval of the Board or without the knowledge of the Board, no loans and\nadvances should be granted to relatives of bank's Chairman/Managing Director or other\nDirectors, Directors (including Chairman/Managing Director) of other banks and their\nrelatives, Directors of Scheduled Co-operative Banks and their relatives, Directors of\nSubsidiaries/Trustees of Mutual Funds/Venture Capital Funds set up by the financing\nbanks or other banks as per details given below\n2.1.1 Lending to directors and their relatives on reciprocal basis\nThere have been instances where certain banks have developed an informal\nunderstanding or mutual/reciprocal arrangement among themselves for extending credit\nfacilities to each other\u2019s directors, their relatives, etc. By and large, they did not follow\nthe usual procedures and norms in sanctioning credit limits to the borrowers, particularlythose belonging to certain groups or directors, their relatives, etc. Facilities far in excess\nof the sanctioned limits and concessions were allowed in the course of operation of\nindividual accounts of the parties. Although, there is no legal prohibition on a bank from\ngiving credit facilities to a director of some other banks or his relatives, serious concern\nwas expressed in Parliament that such quid pro quo  arrangements are not considered to\nbe ethical. The banks should, therefore, follow the guidelines indicated below in regard to\ngrant of loans and advances and award of contracts to the relatives of their directors and\ndirectors of other banks and their relatives:\n2.1.2 Unless sanctioned by the Board of Directors/Management Committee, banks should not\ngrant loans and advances aggregating Rs. 25 lakhs and above to -\n(a) directors (including the Chairman/Managing Director) of other banks  *;\n(b) any firm in which any of the directors of other banks  * is interested as a partner or\nguarantor; and\n(c) any company in which any of the directors of other banks  * holds substantial\ninterest or is interested as a director or as a guarantor.\n2.1.3 Unless sanctioned by the Board of Directors/Management Committee, banks should also\nnot grant loans and advances aggregating Rs. 25 lakhs and above to -\n(a) any relatives of their own Chairmen/Managing Directors or other Directors;\n(b) any relatives of the Chairman/Managing Director or other directors of other banks*;\n(c) any firm in which any of the relatives as mentioned in (a) & (b) above is interested\nas a partner or guarantor; and\n(d) any company in which any of the relatives as mentioned in (a) & (b)above hold\nsubstantial interest or is interested as a director or as a guarantor.\n* including directors of Scheduled Co-operative Banks, directors of\nsubsidiaries/trustees of mutual funds/venture capital funds.\n2.1.4 The proposals for credit facilities of  an amount less than Rs.25 lakh to these borrowers\nmay be sanctioned by the appropriate authority in the financing bank under powers\nvested in such authority, but the matter should be reported to the Board.\n2.1.5 The Chairman/Managing Director or other dir ector who is directly or indirectly\nconcerned or interested in any proposal should disclose the nature of his interest to the\nBoard when any such proposal is discussed. He should not be present in the meeting\nunless his presence is required by the other directors for the purpose of eliciting\ninformation and director so required to be present shall not vote  on any such proposal.\nThe above norms relating to grant of loans and advances will equally apply to awarding\nof contracts.\n2.1.6 The scope of the term \u2018r elative\u2019 will be as under:\n\u2022 Spouse\n\u2022 Father\u2022 Mother (including step-mother)\n\u2022 Son (including step-son)\n\u2022 Son's Wife\n\u2022 Daughter (including step-daughter)\n\u2022 Daughter's Husband\n\u2022 Brother (including step-brother)\n\u2022 Brother\u2019s wife\n\u2022 Sister (including step-sister)\n\u2022 Sister\u2019s husband\n\u2022  Brother (including step-brother) of the spouse\n\u2022 Sister (including step-sister) of the spouse\n2.1.7   The term \u2018loans and advances\u2019 will not include loans or advances against -\n\u2022 Government securities\n\u2022 Life insurance policies\n\u2022 Fixed or other deposits\n\u2022 Stocks and shares\n\u2022 Temporary overdrafts for small amount, i.e. upto Rs. 25,000/-\n\u2022 Casual purchase of cheques upto Rs. 5,000 at a time\n\u2022 Housing loans, car advances, etc. granted to an employee of the bank under any\nscheme applicable generally to employees.\n2.1.8 The t erm \u2018substantial interest\u2019 shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in Section\n5(ne) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n2.1.9 Banks should evolve, inter alia, the following procedure for ascertaining the interest of a\ndirector of a financing bank or of another bank, or his relatives, in credit proposals/award\nof contracts placed before the Board/Committee or other appropriate authority of the\nfinancing banks.\n(i) Every borrower should furnish a declaration to the bank to the effect that -\n(a) (where the borrower is an individual) he is not a director or specified near relation\nof director of a banking company;\n(b) (where the borrower is a partnership firm) none of the partners is a director or\nspecified near relation of a director of a banking company; and\n(c) (where the borrower is a joint stock company) none of its directors, is a  director\nor specified near relation of a director of a banking company.\n(ii)  The declaration should also give details of the relationship of the borrower to the\ndirector of the bank.2.1.10 In order to ensure compliance with the instructions, banks should forthwith recall the loan\nwhen it transpires that the borrower has given a false declaration.\n2.1.11 The above guidelines should also be followed while granting loans/ advances or awarding\ncontracts to directors of scheduled co-operative banks or their relatives.\n2.1.12 These guidelines should also be followed by banks when granting loans and advances and\nawarding of contracts to directors of subsidiaries/trustees of mutual funds/venture capital\nfunds set up by them as also other banks.\n2.1.13 These guidelines should be duly brought to the notice of all directors and also placed\nbefore the bank's Board of Directors.\n2.2 Restrictions on Grant of Loans & Advances to Officers and the Relatives of  Senior\nOfficers of Banks\n2.2.1 The statutory regulations and/or the rules and conditions of service applicable to officers\nor employees of public sector banks indicate, to a certain extent, the precautions to be\nobserved while sanctioning credit facilities to such officers and employees and their\nrelatives. In addition, the following guidelines should be followed by all the banks with\nreference to the extension of credit facilities to officers and the relatives of senior\nofficers:\n(i) Loans & advances to officers of the bank\nNo officer or any Committee comprising, inter alia, an officer as member, shall, while\nexercising powers of sanction of any credit facility, sanction any credit facility to his/her\nrelative.

Credit facilities sanctioned to senior officers of the financing bank should be\nreported to the Board.\n(ii) Loans and advances and award of contracts to relatives of senior officers of the\nbank\nProposals for credit facilities to the relatives of senior officers of the bank sanctioned by\nthe appropriate authority should be reported to the Board. Further, when a credit facility\nis sanctioned by an authority, other than the Board to -\n\u2022 any firm in which any of the relative of any senior officer of the financing bank holds\nsubstantial interest, or is interested as a partner or guarantor; or\n\u2022 any company in which any of the relative of any senior officer of the financing bank\nholds substantial interest, or is interested as a director or as a guarantor,\nsuch transaction should also be reported to the Board.\n2.2.2  The above norms relating to grant of credit facility will equally apply to the awarding of\ncontracts.\n2.2.3   Application of the Guidelines in case of Consortium ArrangementsIn the case of consortium arrangements, the above norms relating to grant of credit\nfacilities to relatives of senior officers of the bank will apply to the relatives of senior\nofficers of all the participating banks.\n2.2.4  Scope of certain expressions\n(i) The scope of the term \u2018relative\u2019 is same as mentioned at para 2.1.6\n(ii) The term \u2018Senior Officer\u2019 will refer to -\n(a) any officer in senior management level in Grade IV and above in nationalised\nbank, and\n(b) any officer in equivalent scale in\n\u2022 State Bank of India and associate banks, and\n\u2022 in any banking company incorporated in India.\n(iii) The term \u2018credit facility\u2019 will not include loans or advances against -\n(a) Government securities\n(b) Life Insurance policies\n(c) fixed or other deposits\n(d) temporary overdrafts for small amount i.e. upto Rs. 25,000/-, and\n(e) casual purchase of cheques upto Rs. 5,000/- at a time.\n(iv) Credit facility will also not include loans and advances such as housing loans, car\nadvances, consumption loans, etc. granted to an officer of the bank under any scheme\napplicable generally to officers.\n(v) The term \u2018substantial interest\u2019 shall have the same meaning assigned to it in Section\n5(ne) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n2.2.5 In this context, banks may, inter alia,\n(i) evolve a procedure to ascertain the interest of the relatives of a senior officer of\nthe bank in any credit proposal/award of contract placed before the Board\nCommittee or other appropriate authority of the financing bank;\n(ii) obtain a declaration from every borrower to the effect that -\n(a) if he is an individual; that he is not a specified near relation to any senior\nofficer of the bank,\n(b) if it is a partnership or HUF firm, that none of the partners, or none of the\nmembers of the HUF, is a near specified relation of any senior officer of the\nbank, and\n(c) if it is a joint stock company; that none of its directors, is a relative of any\nsenior officer of the bank.\n(iii) ensure that the declaration gives details of the relationship, if any, of the borrower\nto any senior officer of the financing bank.(iv) make a condition for the grant of any credit facility that if the declaration made by\na borrower with reference to the above is found to be false, then the bank will be\nentitled to revoke and/or recall the credit facility.\n(v) consider in consultation with their legal advisers, amendments, if any, required to\nany applicable regulations or rules, inter alia, dealing with the service conditions\nof officers of the bank to give effect to these guidelines.\n2.3 Restrictions on Grant of Financial Assistance t o Industries Producing / Consuming\nOzone Depleting Substances ( ODS)\n2.3.1 Government of India has advised that as per the Montreal Protocol, to which India is a\nparty, Ozone Depleting Substances ( ODS) are required to be phased out as per schedule\nprescribed therein.

Wheat * 12.10.1993\n*  Temporarily covered under SCC w.e.f. 8.4.97 to 7.7.97.\nBanks are free to fix prudential margins on advances against these sensitive commodities.\n2.4.3  Commodities covered under Selective Credit Control\n(i) Presently, the following commodities are covered under stipulations of Selective\nCredit Control:(a) Buffer stock of sugar with Sugar Mills\n(b) Unreleased stocks of sugar with Sugar Mills representing\n\u2022 levy sugar, and\n\u2022   free sale sugar\n2.4.4  Stipulations of Selective Credit Control\n(i) Margin on sugar\nCommodityMinimum Margin With effect from\n(a)  Buffer stocks of sugar 0% 01.04.1987\n(b)Unreleased stocks of sugar with Sugar\nMills representing -\n\u2022 levy sugar\n\u2022 free sale sugar10%\n@22.10.1997\n10.10.2000\n@      Margins on credit for free sale sugar will be decided by banks including RRBs and LABs\nbased on their commercial judgement.\n          (ii )     Valuation of sugar stocks\n(a) The unreleased stocks of levy sugar charged to banks as security by the\nsugar mills shall be valued at levy price fixed by Government.\n(b) The unreleased stocks of free sale sugar including buffer stocks of sugar\ncharged to the bank as security by the sugar mills, shall be valued at the average\nof the price realised in the preceding three months (moving average) or the\ncurrent market price, whichever is lower; the prices for this purpose shall be\nexclusive of excise duty .\n         (iii )      Interest rates\nWith effect from 18.10.1994, the banks have the freedom to fix lending rates for\nthe commodities coming within the purview of Selective Credit Control.\n(iv)    Other operational stipulations\n(a) The other operational stipulations vary with the commodities. These\nstipulations are advised whenever Selective Credit Control are reintroduced for\nany specific sensitive commodities.\n(b) Although, none of the earlier stipulations are currently applicable to the only\nsensitive commodity covered under Selective Credit Control viz. buffer stocks\nand unreleased stocks of levy/free sale sugar with Sugar Mills, yet these are\nreproduced in the Annexure  3 for understanding therefrom the underlying\nobjectives of Selective Credit Control so that the banks do not allow the\ncustomers dealing in Selective Credit Control commodities any credit facilities\nwhich would directly or indirectly defeat the purpose of the directives.\n(v) Delegation of powers(a) The matter relating to delegation of powers with regard to approval of credit\nproposals relating to sensitive commodities coming under Selective Credit\nControl has been reviewed and it has been decided that with effect from 23\nNovember 2000 the existing practice of banks\u2019 submitting credit proposals above\nRs. 1 crore to Reserve Bank of India for its prior approval under Selective Credit\nControl shall be discontinued and banks will have the freedom to sanction such\ncredit proposals in terms of their individual loan policies. Accordingly, banks\nneed not forward the credit proposals above Rs. 1 crore in respect of borrowers\ndealing in sensitive commodities to Reserve Bank of India for its prior approval.\n(b) The banks are also advised to circulate these instructions among their\ncontrolling offices/branches and take all necessary steps to ensure that the powers\ndelegated at various levels are exercised with utmost caution without sacrificing\nthe broad objectives of the Selective Credit Control concept.\n3.  Restrictions on other loans and advances\n3.1       Loans and Advances against Shares, Debentures and Bonds\nBanks are required to strictly observe regulatory restrictions on grant of loans and\nadvances against shares, debentures and bonds which are detailed in the Master Circular\non 'Bank Finance Against Shares and Debent ures'\nThe restrictions, inter alia, on loans and advances against shares and debentures, are :-\n(a) No loans to be granted against partly paid shares.\n(b) No loans to be granted to partnership/proprietorship concerns against the primary\nsecurity of shares and debentures.\n(c) Banks and their subsidiaries should not undertake financing of ' Badla'\ntransactions.\n3.2    Advances against Money Market Mutual Funds\nAll the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India on Money Market Mutual Funds\n(MMMF) have been withdrawn and the banks are to be guided by the SEBI Regulations\nin this regard. However the banks/ FIs which are desirous of setting up MMMFs would,\nhowever, have to take necessary clearance from the RBI for undertaking this additional\nactivity before approaching SEBI for registration.\n3.3 Advances against Fixed Deposit Receipts ( FDRs) Issued by Other Banks\nThere have been instances where fake term deposit receipts purported to have been issued\nby some banks were used for obtaining advances from other banks. In the light of these\nhappenings, the banks should desist from sanctioning advances against FDRs, or other\nterm deposits of other banks.\n3.4   Advances to Agents/Intermediaries based on Consideration of Deposit MobilisationBanks should desist from being party to unethical practices of raising of resources\nthrough agents/intermediaries to meet the credit needs of the existing/prospective\nborrowers or from granting loans to the intermediaries, based on the consideration of\ndeposit mobilisation, who may not require the funds for their genuine business\nrequirements.\n3.5  Loans against Certificate of Deposits (CDs)\nBanks cannot grant loans against CDs.\n3.6 Bank Finance to Non-Banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs)\n3.6.1 The following activities undertaken by NBFCs, are not eligible for bank credit:\n(i) Bills discounted / rediscounted by NBFCs, except for rediscounting of bills\ndiscounted by NBFCs arising from sale of \u2013\n(a) commercial vehicles (including light commercial vehicles), and\n(b) two wheeler and three wheeler vehicles, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\u2022 the bills should have been drawn by the manufacturer on dealers\nonly:\n\u2022 the bills should represent genuine sale transactions as may be\nascertained from the chassis/engine number: and\n\u2022 before rediscounting the bills, banks should satisfy themselves\nabout the bona fides and track record of NBFCs which have\ndiscounted the bills.\n(ii) Investments made by NBFCs in shares, debentures, etc. of a current nature, i.e.\nstock-in-trade.\nHowever, Stock Broking Companies may be provided need-based credit against\nshares and debentures held by them as stock-in-trade.\n(iii) Investments of NBFCs in and advances to subsidiaries, group companies or other\nentities.\n(iv) Investments of NBFCs in other companies and inter-corporate loans/deposits to/in\nother companies.\n(v) Finance to NBFCs for further lending to individuals for subscribing to Initial\nPublic Offerings ( IPOs).\n3.6.2 Banks should not grant bridge loans of any nature, or interim finance against\ncapital/debenture issues and/or in the form of loans of a bridging nature pending raising\nof long-term funds from the market by way of capital, deposits, etc. to all categories of\nNon-Banking Financial Companies, i.e. equipment leasing and hire-purchase finance\ncompanies, loan and investment companies and also Residuary Non-Banking Companies\n(RNBCs ).3.7    Bank Finance to Equipment Leasing Companies\n(i) Banks should not enter into lease agreements departmentally with equipment\nleasing companies as well as other Non-Banking Financial Companies engaged in\nequipment leasing.\n(ii) As banks can only support lease rental receivables arising out of lease of\nequipment/machinery owned by the borrowers, lease rentals receivables arising\nout of sub-lease of an asset by a Non-Banking Non Financial Company\n(undertaking nominal leasing activity) or by a Non-Banking Financial Company\nshould be excluded for the purpose of computation of bank finance for such\ncompany.\n3.8     Bank Finance for Purchase/Lease of Existing Assets\nBanks are precluded from granting term loans for acquisition of existing assets (except\nimported second hand machinery). Bank finance to leasing concerns should cover\npurchases of only new equipment. Banks should not extend finance against existing\nassets whether by way of term loans for purchase of such assets or by way of finance to\nleasing companies for purchase and release of such assets.\n3.9    Financing Infrastructure/ Housing Projects\n3.9.1  Housing Finance\n(i) Banks should not grant finance for construction of buildings meant purely\nfor Government/ Semi-Government offices, including Municipal and\nPanchayat offices. However, banks may grant loans for activities, which\nwill be refinanced by institutions like NABARD.\n(ii) Projects undertaken by public sector entities which are not corporate\nbodies (i.e. public sector undertakings which are not registered under\nCompanies Act or which are not corporations established under the\nrelevant statute) may not be financed by banks. Even in respect of projects\nundertaken by corporate bodies, as defined above, banks should satisfy\nthemselves that the project is run on commercial lines and that bank\nfinance is not in lieu of or to substitute budgetary resources envisaged for\nthe project. The loan could, however, supplement budgetary resources if\nsuch supplementing was contemplated in the project design.\n(iii) In case of housing projects which the government is interested in\npromoting either for weaker sections or otherwise a part of the project cost\nmay be met by the Government through subsidies made available and/or\ncontributions to the capital of the institution taking up the project. In such\ncases bank finance should be restricted to the project cost excluding the\namount of subsidy/ capital contribution from the Government. The bank\nshould ensure the commercial viability of the project.\n3.9.2 Guidelines  for Financing of Infrastructure ProjectsIn view of the critical importance of the infrastructure sector and high priority being\naccorded for development of various infrastructure services, the matter has been reviewed\nin consultation with Government of India and the revised guidelines on financing of\ninfrastructure projects are set out as under:\n(a) Definition of  \u2018infrastructure lending\u2019\nAny credit facility in whatever form extended by lenders (i.e. banks, FIs or\nNBFCs) to an infrastructure facility as specified below falls within the definition\nof \u201cinfrastructure lending\u201d. In other words, a credit facility provided to a borrower\ncompany engaged in:\no developing or\no operating and maintaining, or\no developing, operating and maintaining\nany infrastructure facility that is a project in any of the following sectors :\ni) a road, including toll road, a bridge or a rail system;\nii) a highway project including other activities being an integral part of the\nhighway project;\niii) a port, airport, inland waterway or inland port;\niv) a water supply project, irrigation project, water treatment system,\nsanitation and sewerage system or solid waste management system;\nv) telecommunication services whether basic or cellular, including radio\npaging, domestic satellite service (i.e., a satellite owned and operated by\nan Indian company for providing telecommunication service), network of\ntrunking, broadband network and internet services;\nvi) an industrial park or special economic zone ;\nvii) generation or generation and distribution of power\nviii) transmission or distribution of power by laying a network of new\ntransmission or distribution lines.\nix) Any other infrastructure facility of similar nature\n(b)  Criteria for Financing\nBanks/ FIs are free to finance technically feasible, financially viable and   bankable\nprojects undertaken by both public sector and private sector undertakings subject to\nthe following conditions:\n(i) The amount sanctioned should be within the overall ceiling of the prudential\nexposure norms prescribed by RBI for infrastructure financing.\n(ii) Banks/ FIs should have the requisite expertise for appraising technical\nfeasibility, financial viability and bankability of projects, with particular\nreference to the risk analysis and sensitivity analysis.(iii) In respect of projects undertaken by public sector units, term loans may be\nsanctioned only for corporate entities (i.e. public sector undertakings registered\nunder Companies Act or a Corporation established under the relevant statute).\nFurther, such term loans should not be in lieu of or to substitute budgetary\nresources envisaged for the project. The term loan could supplement the\nbudgetary resources if such supplementing was contemplated in the project\ndesign.  While such public sector units may include Special Purpose Vehicles\n(SPVs) registered under the Companies Act set up for financing infrastructure\nprojects, it should be ensured by banks and financial institutions that these\nloans/investments are not used for financing the budget of the State\nGovernments.  Whether such financing is done by way of extending loans or\ninvesting in bonds, banks and financial institutions should undertake due\ndiligence on the viability and bankability  of such projects to ensure that\nrevenue stream from the project is sufficient to take care of the debt servicing\nobligations and that the repayment/servicing of debt is not out of budgetary\nresources.  Further, in the case of financing SPVs, banks and financial\ninstitutions should ensure that the funding proposals are for specific\nmonitorable projects.\n(iv) Banks may also lend to SPVs in the private sector, registered under Companies\nAct for directly undertaking infrastructure projects which are financially viable\nand not for acting as mere financial intermediaries. Banks may ensure that the\nbankruptcy or financial difficulties of the parent/ sponsor should not affect the\nfinancial health of the SPV.\n(c) Types of Financing by Banks\n(i) In order to meet financial requirements of infrastructure projects, banks\nmay extend credit facility by way of working capital finance, term loan,\nproject loan, subscription to bonds and debentures/ preference shares/\nequity shares acquired as a part of the project finance package which is\ntreated as \"deemed advance\u201d and any other form of funded or non-funded\nfacility.\n(ii)       Take-out Financing\nBanks may enter into take-out financing arrangement with IDFC/ other\nfinancial institutions or avail of liquidity support from IDFC/ other FIs. A\nbrief write-up on some of the important features of the arrangement is\ngiven in para 3.9.2(f). Banks may also be guided by the instructions\nregarding take-out finance contained in Circular No. DBOD . BP. BC. 144/\n21.04.048/ 2000  dated   29 February 2000.\n(iii)      Inter-institutional Guarantees\nBanks are permitted to issue guarantees favouring  other lending\ninstitutions in respect of infrastructure projects, provided the bank issuing\nthe guarantee takes a funded share in the project at least to the extent of 5\nper cent of the project cost and undertakes normal credit appraisal,\nmonitoring and follow up of the project. For detail instructions on inter-\ninstitutional guarantee please see para 3.10.(iv)     Financing promoter's equity\nIn terms of our Circular DBOD . Dir. BC. 90/ 13.07.05/ 98 dated 28\nAugust 1998, banks were advised that the promoter's contribution towards\nthe equity capital of a company should come from their own resources and\nthe bank should not normally grant advances to take up shares of other\ncompanies. In view of the importance attached to infrastructure sector, it\nhas been decided that, under certain circumstances, an exception may be\nmade to this policy for financing the acquisition of promoter's shares in an\nexisting company which is  engaged in implementing or operating an\ninfrastructure project in India. The conditions, subject to which an\nexception may be made are as follows:\n(i) The bank finance would be only for acquisition of shares of existing companies providing\ninfrastructure facilities as defined in paragraph 1  above. Further, acquisition of such\nshares should be in respect of companies where the existing foreign promoters (and/\nor domestic joint promoters) voluntarily propose to disinvest their majority shares in\ncompliance with SEBI guidelines, where applicable.\n(ii) The companies to which loans are extended should, inter alia,  have a  satisfactory net\nworth.\n(iii) The company financed and the promoters/ directors of such companies should not be\ndefaulter to banks/ FIs.\n(iv) In order to ensure that the borrower has a substantial stake in the infrastructure company,\nbank finance should be restricted to 50% of the finance required for acquiring the\npromoter's stake in the company being acquired.\n(v) Finance extended should be against the security of the assets of the borrowing company\nor the assets of the company acquired and not against the shares of that company or\nthe company being acquired. The shares of borrower company / company being\nacquired may  be accepted as additional security and not  as primary security. The\nsecurity charged to the banks should be marketable.\n(vi) Banks should ensure maintenance of stipulated margin at all times.\n(vii) The tenor of the bank loans may not be longer than seven years. However, the Boards\nof banks can make an exception in specific cases, where necessary, for financial\nviability of the project.\n(viii) This financing would be subject to compliance with the statutory requirements under\nSection 19(2) of the Banking Regulation  Act, 1949.\n(ix) The banks financing acquisition of equity shares by promoters should be within the\nregulatory ceiling of 5 per cent on capital market exposure in relation to its totaloutstanding advances (including commercial paper )  as on March 31 of the previous\nyear.\n(x) The proposal for bank finance should have the approval of the Board.\n(d)  Appraisal\n(i) In respect of financing of infrastructure projects undertaken by Government\nowned entities, banks/Financial Institutions should undertake due diligence on the\nviability of the projects. Banks should ensure that the individual components of\nfinancing and returns on the project are well defined and assessed.  State\nGovernment guarantees may not be taken as a substitute for satisfactory credit\nappraisal and such appraisal requirements should not be diluted on the basis of\nany reported arrangement with the Reserve Bank of India or any bank for regular\nstanding instructions/periodic payment instructions for servicing the loans/bonds.\n(ii) Infrastructure projects are often financed through Special Purpose Vehicles.\nFinancing of these projects would, therefore, call for special appraisal skills on the\npart of lending agencies.  Identification of various project risks, evaluation of risk\nmitigation through appraisal of project contracts and evaluation of\ncreditworthiness of the contracting entities and their abilities to fulfil contractual\nobligations will be an integral part of the appraisal exercise.  In this connection,\nbanks/ FIs may consider constituting appropriate screening committees/special\ncells for appraisal of credit proposals and monitoring the progress/performance of\nthe projects.  Often, the size of the funding requirement would necessitate joint\nfinancing by banks/ FIs or financing by more than one bank under consortium or\nsyndication arrangements. In such cases, participating banks/ FIs may, for the\npurpose of their own assessment, refer to the appraisal report prepared by the lead\nbank/FI or have the project appraised jointly.\n(e)     Prudential  requirements\n(i)   Prudential credit exposure limits\nCredit exposure to borrowers belonging to a group may exceed the exposure norm\nof 40 per cent of the bank's capital funds by an additional 10 per cent ( i.e up to 50\nper cent), provided the additional credit exposure is on account of extension of\ncredit to infrastructure projects. Credit exposure to single borrower may exceed\nthe exposure norm of 15 per cent of the bank's capital funds by an additional 5 per\ncent (i.e. up to 20 per cent) provided the  additional credit exposure is on account\nof infrastructure as defined in paragraph 1 above.\n(ii) Assignment of risk weight for capital adequacy purposes\nBanks may assign a concessional risk weight of 50 per cent for capital adequacy\npurposes, on investment in securitised paper pertaining to an infrastructure facility\nsubject to compliance with the following:a) The infrastructure facility should satisfy the conditions stipulated in\nparagraph 1 above.\n  b) The infrastructure facility should be generating income/ cash lows which\nwould ensure servicing/ repayment of the securitised paper.\n          c)   The securitised paper should be rated at least ' AAA' by the rating agencies\nand the rating should be current and valid. The rating relied upon will be deemed\nto be current and  valid if  :\n(i) The  rating  is not more than one  month old on the date of opening of the\nissue, and the rating rationale from the rating agency is not more than\none year old on the date of opening of the issue, and the rating letter\nand the rating rationale is a part of the offer document.\n(ii) In the case of secondary market acquisition, the ' AAA' rating of the issue\nshould be in force and confirmed from the monthly bulletin published\nby the respective rating agency.\n(iii) The securitised paper should be a performing asset on the books of the\ninvesting/ lending institution.\n          (iii )     Asset - Liability Management\nThe long - term financing of infrastructure projects may lead to asset \u2013 liability\nmismatches, particularly when such financing is not in conformity with the\nmaturity profile of a bank\u2019s liabilities. Banks would, therefore, need to exercise\ndue vigil on their asset-liability position to ensure that they do not run into\nliquidity mismatches on account of lending to such projects.\n(iv)   Administrative arrangements\nTimely and adequate availability of credit is the pre-requisite for successful\nimplementation of infrastructure projects. Banks/ FIs should, therefore, clearly\ndelineate the procedure for approval of loan proposals and institute a suitable\nmonitoring mechanism for reviewing applications pending beyond the specified\nperiod.  Multiplicity of appraisals by every institution involved in financing,\nleading to delays, has to be avoided and banks should be prepared to broadly\naccept technical parameters laid down by leading public financial institutions.\nAlso, setting up a mechanism for an ongoing monitoring of the project\nimplementation will ensure that the credit disbursed is utilised for the purpose for\nwhich it was sanctioned.\n(f) Take-out financing/liquidity support\na. Take-out financing arrangement\n     Take-out financing structure is essentially a mechanism designed to enable banks\nto avoid asset-liability maturity mismatches that may arise out of extending longtenor loans to infrastructure projects. Under the arrangements, banks financing the\ninfrastructure projects will have an arrangement with IDFC or any other financial\ninstitution for transferring to the latter the outstandings in their books on a pre-\ndetermined basis. IDFC and SBI have devised different take-out financing\nstructures to suit the requirements of various banks, addressing issues such as\nliquidity, asset-liability mismatches, limited availability of project appraisal skills,\netc. They have also developed a Model Agreement that can be considered for use\nas a document for specific projects in conjunction with other project loan\ndocuments. The agreement between SBI and IDFC could provide a reference\npoint for other banks to enter into somewhat similar arrangements with IDFC or\nother financial institutions.\nb. Liquidity support from IDFC\nAs an alternative to take-out financing structure, IDFC and SBI have devised a\nproduct, providing liquidity support to banks. Under the scheme, IDFC would\ncommit, at the point of sanction, to refinance the entire outstanding loan\n(principal+unrecovered interest) or part of the loan, to the bank after an agreed\nperiod, say, five years. The credit risk on the project will be taken by the bank\nconcerned and not by IDFC. The bank would repay the amount to IDFC with\ninterest as per the terms agreed upon. Since IDFC would be taking a credit risk on\nthe bank, the interest rate to be charged by it on the amount refinanced would\ndepend on the IDFC\u2019s risk perception of the bank (in most of the cases, it may be\nclose to IDFC\u2019s PLR). The refinance support from IDFC would particularly\nbenefit the banks which have the requisite appraisal skills and the initial liquidity\nto fund the project.\n3.10   Issue of Bank Guarantees in favour of Financial Institutions\nBanks may issue guarantees favouring other banks/ FIs/other lending agencies for the\nloans extended by the latter, subject to strict compliance with the following conditions.\n(i) The Board of Directors should reckon the integrity/robustness of the bank\u2019s risk\nmanagement systems and accordingly put in place a well-laid out policy in this\nregard.\nThe Board approved policy should, among others, address the following issues:\na) Prudential limits, linked to bank\u2019s Tier I capital, up to which guarantees\nfavouring other banks/ FIs/other lending agencies may be issued.\nb) Nature and extent of security and margins\nc) Delegation of powers\nd) Reporting system\ne) Periodical reviews(ii) The guarantee shall be extended only in respect of borrower constituents and to\nenable them to avail of additional credit facility from other banks/ FIs/lending\nagencies\n(iii) The guaranteeing bank shall  assume a funded exposure of at least 10% of the\nexposure guaranteed.\n(iv) Banks should not extend guarantees or letters of comfort in favour of overseas\nlenders including those assignable to overseas lenders, except for the relaxations\npermitted under FEMA.\n(v) The guarantee issued by the bank will be an exposure on the borrowing entity on\nwhose behalf the guarantee has been issued and will attract appropriate risk\nweight as per the extant guidelines.\n(vi) Banks should ensure compliance with the recommendations of the Ghosh\nCommittee and other internal requirements relating to issue of guarantees to\nobviate the possibility of frauds in this area.\nLending banks\nBanks extending credit facilities against the guarantees issued by other banks/ FIs should ensure\nstrict compliance with the following  conditions:\n(i) The exposure assumed by the bank against the guarantee of another bank/ FI will\nbe deemed as an exposure on the guaranteeing bank/ FI and will attract appropriate\nrisk weight as per the extant guidelines.\n(ii) Exposures assumed by way of credit facilities extended against the guarantees\nissued by other banks should be reckoned within the inter bank exposure limits\nprescribed by the Board of Directors. Since the exposure assumed by the bank\nagainst the guarantee of another bank/ FI will be for a fairly longer term than those\nassumed on account of inter bank dealings in the money market, foreign exchange\nmarket and securities market, Board of Directors should fix an appropriate sub-\nlimit for the longer term exposures since these exposures attract greater risk.\n(iii) Banks should monitor the exposure assumed on the guaranteeing bank/ FI, on a\ncontinuous basis and ensure strict compliance with the prudential limits/sub limits\nprescribed by the Board for banks and the prudential single borrower limits\nprescribed by RBI for FIs.\n(iv) Banks should comply with the recommendations of the Ghosh Committee and\nother internal requirements relating to acceptance of guarantees of other banks to\nobviate the possibility of frauds in this area.\nHowever, the above conditions will not be applicable in the following cases:\n(a) Issuance of guarantee in favour of IDBI, in the case of import of technical\nknow-how by way of drawings and designs under the Technical Development\nScheme of the IDBI, under certain circumstances and where no tangible security\nis available to IDBI.(b) In respect of infrastructure projects, banks may issue guarantees favouring\nother lending institutions, provided the bank issuing the guarantee takes a funded\nshare in the project at least to the extent of 5 percent of the project cost and\nundertakes normal credit appraisal, monitoring and follow up of the project.\n(c) Issuance of guarantees in favour of various Development Agencies/Boards,\nlike Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, National Horticulture\nBoard, etc. for obtaining soft loans and/or other forms of development assistance\nfrom such Agencies/Boards with the objective of improving efficiency,\nproductivity, etc., subject to the following conditions:\n\u2022 Banks should satisfy themselves, on the basis of credit appraisal,\nregarding the technical feasibility, financial viability and bankability  of\nindividual projects and/or loan proposals i.e. the standard of such\nappraisal should be the same, as is done in the case of a loan proposal\nseeking sanction of term finance/loan.\n\u2022 Banks should conform to the prudential exposure norms prescribed\nfrom time to time for an individual borrower/group of borrowers.\n\u2022 Banks should suitably secure themselves before extending such\nguarantees.\n(d) Issue of guarantees favouring HUDCO/State Housing Boards and similar\nbodies for loans granted by them to private borrowers who are unable to offer\nclean or marketable title to property, provided banks are otherwise satisfied about\nthe capacity of borrowers to adequately service such loans.\n(e) Issuance of guarantees by consortium member banks unable to participate in\nrehabilitation packages on account of temporary liquidity constraints, in favour of\nthe banks which take up their share of the limit.\nBanks should not grant co-acceptance/guarantee facilities under Buyers Lines of Credit\nSchemes introduced by IDBI, SIDBI, Exim Bank, Power Finance Corporation ( PFC) or\nany other financial institution, unless specifically permitted by the RBI.\n3.11 Discounting/Rediscounting of Bills by Banks\nBanks may adhere to the following guidelines while purchasing / discounting /\nnegotiating / rediscounting of genuine commercial / trade bills:\n(i) Since banks have already been given freedom to decide their own\nguidelines for assessing / sanctioning working capital limits of borrowers, they\nmay sanction working capital limits as also bills limit to borrowers after proper\nappraisal of their credit needs and in accordance with the loan policy as approved\nby their Board of Directors.\n(ii) Banks should clearly lay down a bills discounting policy approved by their\nBoard of directors, which should be consistent with their policy of sanctioning of\nworking capital limits. In this case, the procedure for Board approval should\ninclude banks\u2019 core operating process from the time the bills are tendered till\nthese are realised. Banks may review their core operating processes and simplifythe procedure in respect of bills financing. In order to address the off-cited\nproblem of delay in realisation of bills, banks may take advantage of improved\ncomputer / communication network like Structured Financial Messaging system\n(SFMS) and adopt the system of \u2018value dating\u2019 of their clients\u2019 accounts.\n(iii) Banks should open letters of credit ( LCs) and purchase / discount /\nnegotiate bills under LCs only in respect of genuine commercial and trade\ntransactions of their borrower constituents who have been sanctioned regular\ncredit facilities by the banks. Banks should not, therefore, extend fund based\n(including bills financing) or non-fund based facilities like opening of LCs,\nproviding guarantees and acceptances to non-constituent borrower or / and non-\nconstituent member of a consortium / multiple banking arrangement.\n(iv) For the purpose of credit exposure, bills purchased / discounted /\nnegotiated under LCs or otherwise should be reckoned on the bank\u2019s borrower\nconstituent. Accordingly, the exposure should attract a risk weight appropriate to\nthe borrower constituent ( viz; 100% for firms, individuals, corporates etc.) for\ncapital adequacy pruposes.\n(v) While purchasing / discounting / negotiating bills under LCs or otherwise,\nbanks should establish genuineness of underlying transactions / documents.\n(vi) Banks should ensure that blank LC forms are kept in safe custody as in\ncase of security items like blank cheques, demand drafts etc. and verified /\nbalanced on daily basis. LC forms should be issued to customers under joint\nsignatures of the bank\u2019s authorised officials.\n(vii) The practice of drawing bills of exchange claused \u2018without recourse\u2019 and\nissuing letters of credit bearing the legend \u2018without recourse\u2019 should be\ndiscouraged because such notations deprive the negotiating bank of the right of\nrecourse it has against the drawer under the Negotiable Instruments Act. Banks\nshould not therefore open LCs and purchase / discount / negotiate bills bearing the\n\u2018without recourse\u2019 clause.\n(viii) Accommodation bills should not be purchased / discounted / negotiated by\nbanks. The underlying trade transactions should be clearly identified and a proper\nrecord thereof maintained at the branches conducting the bills business.\n(ix) Banks should be circumspect while discounting bills drawn by front\nfinance companies set up by large industrial groups on other group companies.\n(x) Bills rediscounts should be restricted to usance bills held by other banks.\nBanks should not rediscount bills earlier discounted by   non-bank financial\ncompanies ( NBFCs) except in respect of bills arising from sale of light\ncommercial vehicles and two / three wheelers.\n(xi) Banks may exercise their commercial judgment in discounting of bills of\nservices sector. However, while discounting such bills, banks should ensure that\nactual services are rendered and accommodation bills are not discounted. Services\nsector bills should not be eligible for rediscounting.  Further, providing financeagainst discounting of services sector bills may be treated as unsecured advance\nand therefore, subject to the condition that 20% of a bank\u2019s unsecured guarantees\nplus the total of its outstanding unsecured advances do not exceed 15% of its total\noutstanding advances.\n(xii) In order to promote payment discipline which would to a certain extent\nencourage acceptance of bills, all corporates  and other constituent borrowers\nhaving turnover above threshold level as fixed by the bank\u2019s Board of Directors\nshould be mandated to disclose \u2018 aging  schedule\u2019 of their overdue payables in\ntheir periodical returns submitted to banks.\n(xiii) Banks should not enter into Repo transactions using bills discounted /\nrediscounted as collateral.\n3.12   Advances against Gold/Silver Bullion\n(i) Banks should not grant any advance against gold bullion.\n(ii) Banks should desist from granting advances to the silver bullion dealers which are\nlikely to be utilised for speculative purposes.\n(iii) Banks should desist from giving loans to finance ' Badla' transactions in silver (i.e.\nbuying silver ready and selling forward to earn interest).\n3.13 Loans and advances to Small Scale Industries\nSSI units having working capital limits of up to Rs 5 crore from the banking system are\nto be provided working capital finance computed on the basis of 20 percent of their\nprojected annual turnover. The banks should adopt the simplified procedure in respect of\nall SSI units (new as well as existing).\n3.14 Loan system for delivery of bank credit\nLoan Component and Cash Credit Component\n(a) In the case of borrowers enjoying working capital credit limits of Rs. 10\ncrore and above from the banking system, loan component should normally be\n80 percent. Banks, however, have the freedom to change the composition of\nworking capital by increasing the cash credit component beyond 20 percent or to\nincrease the \u2018Loan Component\u2019 beyond 80 percent as the case may be, if they so\ndesire. Banks are expected to appropriately price each of the two components of\nworking capital finance, taking into account the impact of such decisions on their\ncash and liquidity management.\n(b) In the case of borrowers enjoying working capital credit limit of less than\nRs. 10 crore, banks may persuade them to go in for the \u2018Loan System\u2019 by\noffering an incentive in the form of lower rate of interest on the loancomponent, as compared to the cash credit component. The actual percentage\nof \u2018loan component\u2019 in these cases may be settled by the bank with its\nborrower clients.\n(c) In respect of certain business activities, which are cyclical and seasonal in\nnature or have inherent volatility, the strict application of loan system may\ncreate difficulties for the borrowers. Banks may, with the approval of their\nrespective Boards, identify such business activities, which may be exempted\nfrom the loan system of delivery.\n3.15 Working Capital Finance to Informat ion Technology and software industr y\nFollowing the recommendations of the \u201cNational Task force on Information Technology\nand Software development \u201c Reserve Bank has framed guidelines for extending working\ncapital to the said industry. The banks are however free to modify the guidelines based on\ntheir own experience without reference to the Reserve Bank of India to achieve the\npurpose of the guidelines in letter and spirit. The salient features of these guidelines are\nset forth below:\n\u2022 The banks may consider sanction of working capital limits based on the track\nrecord of the promoters group affiliation, composition of the management team\nand their work experience as well as the infrastructure.\n\u2022 In the case of the borrowers with working capital limits of up to Rs 2 crore,\nassessment may be made at 20 percent of the projected turnover. However in\nother cases, the banks may consider assessment of MPBF on the basis of the\nmonthly cash budget system. For the borrowers enjoying working capital limits of\nRs 10 crore and above from the banking system the guidelines regarding the loan\nsystem would be applicable.\n\u2022 Banks can stipulate reasonable amount as promoters\u2019 contribution towards\nmargin.\n\u2022 Banks may obtain collateral security wherever available. First/ second charge on\ncurrent assets if available may be obtained.\n\u2022 The rate of interest as prescribed for general category of borrowers may be levied.\nConcessional rate of interest as applicable to pre shipment/post shipment credit\nmay be levied.\n\u2022 Banks may evolve tailor made follow up system for such advances. The banks\ncould obtain quarterly statements of cash flows to monitor the operations. In case\nthe sanction was not made on the basis of the cash budgets, they can devise a\nreporting system as they deem fit.\n3.16 Guidelines for bank finance for PSU disinvestments of Government of India\nIn terms of RBI circular DBOD  No.  Dir. BC .90/13.07.05/98 dated August 28, 1998,\nbanks have been advised that the promoters\u2019 contribution towards the equity capital of a\ncompany should come from their own resources and the bank should not normally grantadvances to take up shares of other companies.  Banks were also advised to ensure that\nadvances against shares were not used to enable the borrower to acquire or retain a\ncontrolling interest in the company/companies or to facilitate or retain inter-corporate\ninvestment.    It is clarified that the aforesaid instructions of the 1998 circular would not\napply in the case of bank finance to the successful bidders under the PSU disinvestment\nprogramme of the Government ,  subject to the following :\na. Banks\u2019 proposals for financing the successful bidders in the PSU\ndisinvestment programme should be approved by their Board of\nDirectors.\nb. Bank finance should be for acquisition of shares of PSU under a\ndisinvestment programme approved by Government of India,\nincluding the secondary stage mandatory open offer, wherever\napplicable and not for subsequent acquisition of the PSU shares.\nBank finance should be  made available only for prospective\ndisinvestments  by Government of India.\nc. The companies, including the promoters, to which bank finance is\nto be extended should have adequate net worth and an excellent\ntrack record of servicing loans availed from the banking system.\nd. The amount of bank finance thus provided should be reasonable\nwith reference to banks\u2019 size, its net worth and business and risk\nprofile.\nIn case the advances against the PSU disinvestment is secured by the  shares of the\ndisinvested PSUs or any other shares, banks should follow our extant guidelines on\ncapital market exposures on margin, ceiling on overall exposure to the capital market,\nrisk management and internal control systems, surveillance and monitoring by the Audit\nCommittee of the Board, valuation and disclosure, etc. (cf. our circular\nNo.DBOD.BP.BC.119/21.04.137/2000-01 dated May 11, 2001).\n3.16.1  Stipulation of lock-in period for shares\ni) Banks should,  while deciding to  extend finance to the borrowers who participate in\nthe PSU disinvestment programme, advise such borrowers to execute an agreement\nwhereby they undertake to:\n(a) Produce the letter of waiver by the Government for disposal of shares acquired\nunder PSU disinvestment programme during the lock-in period,  or\n(b) Include a specific provision in the documentation with the Government permitting\nthe pledgee to liquidate the shares during the lock-in period, in case of shortfall in\nmargin requirement or default by the borrower.\n(ii) Banks may extend finance to the successful bidders even though the  shares of the\ndisinvested company acquired/ to be acquired by the successful bidder are\nsubjected to a lock-in period/ other such restrictions which affect their liquidity,\nsubject to fulfillment of following conditions:1. The documentation between the Government of India and the successful\nbidder should contain a specific provision permitting the pledgee to\nliquidate the shares even during lock-in period that may be prescribed in\nrespect of such disinvestments, in case of shortfall in margin requirements\nor default by the borrower.\n2. If the documentation does not contain such a specific provision, the\nborrower (successful bidder) should obtain waiver from the Government\nfor disposal of shares acquired under PSU disinvestment programme\nduring the lock-in period.\nAs per the terms and conditions of the PSU disinvestments by the Government of India, the\npledgee bank will not be allowed to invoke the pledge during the first year of the lock-in period.\nDuring the second and third year of the lock-in period, in case of inability of the borrower to\nrestore the margin prescribed for the purpose by way of additional security or non performance\nof the payment obligations as per the repayment schedule agreed upon between the bank and the\nborrower, bank would have the right to invoke the pledge. The pledgee bank\u2019s right to invoke the\npledge during the second and third years of the lock-in period, would be subject to the terms and\nconditions of the documentation between Government and the successful bidder, which might\nalso cast certain responsibilities on the pledgee banks.\nIt is clarified that the concerned bank must make a proper appraisal  and exercise due caution\nabout credit worthiness of the borrower and the financial viability of the proposal. The bank must\nalso  satisfy  itself that the proposed documentation, relating to the disposal of  shares pledged\nwith the bank, are fully acceptable to the bank and do not involve unacceptable risks  on the part\nof the bank.\nIn terms of IECD Circular No. 10/ 08.12.01/ 2000- 2001 dated 8 January 2001, banks are\nprecluded from financing investments of NBFCs in other companies and inter-corporate loans /\ndeposits to/ in other companies. The position has been reviewed and banks are advised that SPVs\nwhich comply with the following conditions would not be treated as investment companies and\ntherefore would not be considered as NBFCs  :\n(a) They function as holding companies, special purpose vehicles, etc. with not\nless than 90 per cent of their total assets as investment in securities held for\nthe purpose of holding ownership stake,\n(b) They do not trade in these securities except for block sale; and\n(c) They do not undertake any other financial activities.\nSPVs  which satisfy the above conditions would be eligible for bank finance for PSU\ndisinvestments of Government of India.\nIn this context, it may be mentioned that Government of India, Ministry of Finance ( DEA ),\nInvestment Division, vide its Press Note dated July 8, 2002 on guidelines for Euro issues, haspermitted an Indian company utilizing ADR /GDR /ECB proceeds for financing disinvestment\nprogramme  of the Government of India, including the subsequent open offer.  Banks may,\ntherefore, take into account proceeds from such ADR/ GDR/ ECB issues, for extending bank\nfinance to successful bidders of PSU disinvestment programme.Annexure 1\nMaster Circular on Loans and Advances \u2013 Statutory and Other Restrictions\nList of Controlled Substances\n(Vide paragraph 2.3.1)\nGroup Substance Ozone Depleting Potential *\nGroup I\nCFCl 3 (CFC-11) 1.0\nCF2Cl2 (CFC-12) 1.0\nC2F3Cl3 (CFC-113) 0.8\nC2F4Cl2 (CFC-114) 1.0\nCl (CFC-115) 0.6\nGroup II\nCF2BrCl (halon-1211) 3.0\nCF3Br (halon-1301) 10.0\nC2F4Br2 (halon-2402) 6.0\n*These ozone depleting potentials are estimated based on existing\nknowledge and will be reviewed and revised periodically.Annexure 2\nMaster Circular on Loans and Advances \u2013 Statutory and Other Restrictions\nList of Controlled Substances\n(Vide paragraph 2.3.1)\nGroup Substance Ozone Depleting Potential\nGroup I\nCF3Cl (CFC-13) 1.0\nCF2Cl5 (CFC-111) 1.0\nC2F2Cl4 (CFC-112) 1.0\nC2FCl7 (CFC-211) 1.0\nC2F2Cl6 (CFC-212) 1.0\nC3F3Cl5 (CFC-213) 1.0\nC3F4Cl4 (CFC-214) 1.0\nC3F5Cl3 (CFC-215) 1.0\nC3F6Cl2 (CFC-216) 1.0\nC3F7Cl (CFC-217) 1.0\nGroup II\nCCl4 Carbon Tetrachloride 1.1\nGroup III\nC2H3Cl3 * 1,1,1 - trichloroethane\n(methyl chloroform)0.1\n*This formula does not refer to 1,1,2 - trichloroethane.Annexure 3\nMaster Circular on Loans and Advances \u2013 Statutory and Other Restrictions\nSelective Credit Control\nOther Operational Stipulations\n[Vide paragraph 2.4.4 (iv)]\n1.

General\nAs a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of\nconcentration of credit risks, the Reserve Bank of India has advised the banks to fix\nlimits on their exposure to specific industry or sectors and has prescribed regulatory\nlimits on banks\u2019 exposure to individual and group borrowers in India and unsecured\nguarantees and unsecured advances. In addition, banks are also required to observe\ncertain statutory and regulatory exposure limits in respect of advances against /\ninvestments in shares, debentures and bonds.\n2. Credit Exposures to Individual/Group Borrowers\n2.1 Ceilings\n2.1.1 The exposure ceiling should be fixed in relation to bank's capital funds.\nInternationally, exposure ceilings are computed in relation to total capital as defined\nunder capital adequacy standards (Tier I and Tier II Capital). Taking into account the\nbest international practices, it has been decided to adopt the concept of capital funds\nas defined under capital adequacy standards for determining exposure ceiling\nuniformly both by domestic and foreign banks, effective from 31 March 2002. The\nexposure ceiling limits applicable from April 1, 2002, which is based on the capital\nfunds in India as computed above would be 15 per cent of capital funds in case of\nsingle borrower and 40 percent in the case of a borrower group.\nForeign banks were advised to continue with the level of their exposure to\nsingle/group borrowers, in excess of the prudential norms, upto March 31, 2003.\nHowever, keeping in view the difficulties experienced by some of them to comply\nwith the norms by the stipulated date i.e. April 1, 2003, as a special case ,  they have\nbeen given relaxation in respect of the following:\n(i) In the case of merger/acquisition of different borrowing companies, if the\nbank\u2019s group exposure exceeds the prudential norm, foreign banks may\ncontinue with the excess group exposure till March 31, 2004.\n(ii) The existing fund and non-fund based facilities in bonds/debentures and\nperformance guarantees etc. exceeding the exposure ceilings, may continue till\ntheir expiry/maturity.3\nIn no case, foreign banks should assume fresh exposure to single/group borrowers\nbeyond the permissible ceiling.\n2.1.2 Credit exposure to borrowers belonging to a group may exceed the exposure norm of\n40 per cent of the bank's capital funds by an additional 10 per cent ( i.e up to 50 per\ncent), provided the additional credit exposure is on account of extension of credit to\ninfrastructure projects. Credit exposure to single borrower may exceed the exposure\nnorm of 15 per cent of the bank's capital funds by an additional 5 per cent (i.e. up to\n20 per cent) provided the additional credit exposure is on account of infrastructure as\ndefined below.\n2.1.3 Definition of  \u2018infrastructure lending\u2019\nAny credit facility in whatever form extended by lenders (i.e. banks, FIs or NBFCs) to\nan infrastructure facility as specified below falls within the definition of\n\u201cinfrastructure lending\u201d. In other words, a credit facility provided to a borrower\ncompany engaged in:\ni. developing or\nii. operating and maintaining, or\niii. developing, operating and maintaining\nany infrastructure facility that is a project in any of the following sectors:\ni. a road, including toll road, a bridge or a rail system;\nii. a highway project including other activities being an integral part of the\nhighway project;\niii. a port, airport, inland waterway or inland port;\niv. a water supply project, irrigation project, water treatment system, sanitation\nand sewerage system or solid waste management system;\nv. telecommunication services whether basic or cellular, including radio paging,\ndomestic satellite service (i.e., a satellite owned and operated by an Indian\ncompany for providing telecommunication service), network of trunking,\nbroadband network and internet services;\nvi. an industrial park or special economic zone ;\nvii. generation or generation and distribution of power\nviii. transmission or distribution of power by laying a network of new transmission\nor distribution lines.\nix. Any other infrastructure facility of similar nature4\n2.1.4 Lending under Consortium  Arrangements\nThe exposure limits will be applicable even in case of lending under consortium\narrangements, wherever formalised.\n2.2 EXEMPTIONS\n2.2.1 Rehabilitation of Sick/Weak Industrial Units\nThe ceilings on single/group exposure limits would not be applicable to\nexisting/additional credit facilities (including funding of interest and irregularities)\ngranted to weak/sick industrial units under rehabilitation packages.\n2.2.2 Food credit\nBorrowers to whom limits are allocated directly by the Reserve Bank, for food credit,\nwill be exempt from the ceiling.\n2.3 Definitions\n2.3.1 Exposure\nExposure shall include credit exposure (funded and non-funded credit limits) and\ninvestment exposure (including underwriting and similar commitments) as well as\ncertain types of investments in companies. The sanctioned limits or outstandings,\nwhichever are higher, shall be reckoned for arriving at exposure limit. In line with\ninternational best practices, it has been decided that effective from April 1, 2003, non-\nfund based exposures should also be reckoned at 100 per cent of the limit or\noutstandings, whichever is higher.  However, loans and advances granted against the\nsecurity of bank\u2019s own term deposits may be excluded from the purview of the\nexposure ceiling.\n2.3.2 Measurement of Credit Exposure of Derivative Products\nAt present, derivative products such as Forward Rate Agreements ( FRAs ) and Interest\nRate Swaps ( IRSs ) are also captured for computing exposure by applying the\nconversion factors to notional principal amounts as per the original exposure method\nprescribed in Annexures  1 and 2 of our circular MPD.BC . 187/07.01/279/1999-2000\ndated July 7, 1999. It has been decided that, effective from April 1, 2003, banks\nshould also include forward contracts in foreign exchange and other derivative\nproducts like currency swaps, options, etc. at their replacement cost value in\ndetermining individual/group borrower exposure. The methodology to be adopted by\nbanks for arriving at the replacement cost value is given below.\nBanks may adopt, effective from April 1, 2003, either of the two methods viz. ( i)\nOriginal Exposure Method, and (ii) Current Exposure Method consistently for all\nderivative products, in determining individual / group borrower exposure.5\nUnder the Original Exposure Method, credit exposure is calculated at the beginning of\nthe derivative transaction by multiplying the notional principal amount with a\nconversion factor. In order to arrive at the credit equivalent amount using the Original\nExposure Method, a bank would apply the following credit conversion factors to the\nnotional principal amounts of each instrument according to the nature of the\ninstrument and its original maturity:\nOriginal Maturity Conversion factor to be applied on Notional Principal\nAmount\nInterest Rate Contract Exchange Rate Contract\nLess than one year 0.5% 2.0%\nOne year and less than two years 1.0% 5.0% (2% +3%)\nFor each additional year 1.0% 3.0%\nThe other method (Current Exposure Method) to assess the exposure on account of\ncredit risk on interest rate and exchange rate derivative contracts is to calculate\nperiodically the current replacement cost by marking these contracts to market, thus\ncapturing the current exposure without any need for estimation and then adding a\nfactor (\u201cadd-on\u201d) to reflect the potential future exposure over the remaining life of the\ncontract. Therefore, in order to calculate the credit exposure equivalent of off-balance\nsheet interest rate and exchange rate instruments under Current Exposure Method, a\nbank would sum:\n(i) the total of replacement cost (obtained by \u201cmarking to market\u201d) of all its\ncontracts with positive value (i.e. when the bank has to receive money from\nthe counter party), and\n(ii) an amount for potential future changes in credit exposure calculated on the\nbasis of the total notional principal amount of the contract multiplied by the\nfollowing credit of conversion factors according to the residual maturity:\nResidual Maturity Conversion factor to be applied on Notional Principal\namount\nInterest Rate Contract Exchange Rate Contract\nLess than one year Nil 1.0%\nOne year and over 0.5% 5.0%\nBanks should mark to market the derivative products at least on a monthly basis and\nthey may follow their internal methods of determining the marked to market value of\nthe derivative products.\nBanks would not be required to calculate potential credit exposure for single currency\nfloating / floating interest rate swaps. The credit exposure on these contracts would be\nevaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market value.\nBanks are encouraged to follow the Current Exposure Method which is an accurate\nmethod of measuring credit exposure in a derivative product. In case a bank is not in a\nposition to adopt the Current Exposure method, it may follow the Original Exposure6\nMethod. However, its endeavour should be to move over to Current Exposure Method\nin course of time.\n2.3.3 Credit exposure\nCredit exposure  comprises of the following elements:\n(a) all types of funded and non-funded credit limits.\n(b) facilities extended by way of equipment leasing, hire purchase finance and\nfactoring services.\n(c) advances against shares, debentures, bonds, units of mutual funds, etc. to stock\nbrokers, market makers.\n(d) bank loan for financing promoters contributions.\n(e) bridge loans against equity flows/issues.\n(f) financing of Initial Public Offerings ( IPOs).\n2.3.4 Investments exposure\nInvestments exposure comprises of the following elements:\n(a) investments in shares and debentures of companies acquired   through direct\nsubscription, devolvement arising out of underwriting obligations or\npurchased from secondary markets or on conversion of debt into equity.\n(b) investment in PSU bonds through direct subscription, devolvement arising out\nof underwriting obligations or purchase made in the secondary market.\n(c) investments in Commercial Papers ( CPs) issued by Corporate Bodies/ PSUs.\n(d) the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of\nSecurity Interest Act, 2002, provides, among others, sale of financial assets by\nbanks / FIs to Securitisation Company (SC)/ Reconstruction Company(RC).\nBanks\u2019 / FIs\u2019 investments in debentures/ bonds / security receipts / pass-\nthrough certificates ( PTCs) issued by a SC / RC as compensation consequent\nupon sale of financial assets will constitute exposure on the SC / RC. As only\na few SC/RC are being set up now, banks\u2019 / FIs\u2019 exposure on SC / RC through\ntheir investments in debentures / bonds / security receipts / ( PTCs) issued by\nthe SC / RC may go beyond their prudential exposure ceiling. In view of the\nextra ordinary nature of event, banks / FIs will be allowed, in the initial years,\nto exceed prudential exposure ceiling on a case-to-case basis.7\nThe investment made by the banks in bonds and debentures of corporates which are\nguaranteed by a PFI\u00c4(as per list given in Annexure 1) will be treated as an exposure by the\nbank on the PFI and not on the corporate.\n2.3.5 Capital Funds\nCapital funds for the purpose will comprise of Tier I and Tier II capital as defined\nunder capital adequacy standards.\n2.3.6 In the case of Indian Banks\nTier I Capital  consists of\n(i) Paid up capital, statutory reserves, and other disclosed free reserves, if any.\n(ii) Capital reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of assets.\n(iii) Less: equity investments in subsidiaries, intangible assets and losses in the\ncurrent period as well as those brought forward from the previous years.\n(iv) In the case of public sector banks which have introduced Voluntary\nRetirement Schemes ( VRS), in view of the extra-ordinary nature of the event,\nthe VRS related  Deferred  Revenue Expenditure would not  be reduced from\nTier  I capital.\n(v) The infusion of capital either through domestic issue or overseas float, after the\npublished balance sheet date will also be taken into account for determining\nthe exposure ceiling. Other accretion to capital funds by way of quarterly\nprofits etc. would not be eligible for determining the ceiling. Banks are also\nprohibited from taking exposure in excess of the ceiling in anticipation of\ncapital at a future date.\nTier -II capital  consists of\n(i) Undisclosed reserves and cumulative perpetual preference shares.\n(ii) Revaluation reserves (discounted at 55% for determining their value for\ninclusion in Tier-II capital).\n(iii) General Provision and loss reserves, general provisions on 'Standard Assets'\nand 'Investment Fluctuation Reserves' (subject to an overall ceiling of 1.25%\nof total risk weighted assets).\n                                                \n\u00c4With the merger of ICICI Ltd. with ICICI Bank Ltd. effective from 30.03.2002, the entire liabilities of ICICI\nLtd. have been taken over by ICICI Bank Ltd. As per the scheme of merger all loans and guarantee facilities to\nICICI Ltd. provided by Government would be transferred to the merged entity.  Similarly, the investments made\nin erstwhile ICICI Ltd. by banks would be treated outside the ceiling of 5% till redemption.8\n(iv) Excess provision towards investments held in \u201cInvestment Fluctuation\nReserve Account\u201d.\n(v) Hybrid Debt Capital Instruments and Subordinated Debt (subject to\nappropriate discount at rates depending on period to maturity).\n(vi) vi. Subordinated Debt instruments eligible to be reckoned as Tier II capital\nwill be limited to 50 percent of Tier I capital. However, in the case of public\nsector banks, the bonds issued to the VRS employees as a part of the\ncompensation package (net of the un-amortised VRS Deferred Revenue\nexpenditure) could be treated    as Tier II capital subject to compliance with\nthe terms and conditions stipulated in Master Circular dated 5 July 2002.\n(vii) Tier II elements should be limited to a maximum of 100 percent of total Tier I\nelements for the purpose of compliance with the norms.\n2.3.7 In the case of Foreign banks  operating in India\nTier-1 capital  consists of the following:\n(i) Interest Free funds from Head Office kept in separate account in Indian books\nto meet the capital adequacy norms.\n(ii) Statutory reserves kept in Indian books.\n(iii) Remittable surplus retained in Indian books which are not repatriable   so long\nas the bank functions in India.\n(iv) Capital reserves representing surplus arising out of sale of assets in India held\nin a separate book and not repatriable so long as the bank functions in India.\n(v) Interest free funds remitted from abroad for the purpose of acquisition of\nproperty and held in separate account in Indian books.\n(vi) The net credit balance, if any, in the inter-office account with Head\nOffice/overseas branches will not be reckoned as capital funds.

The foreign banks are allowed borrowings in\nforeign currency as subordinated debt. The total amount of HO borrowings in\nforeign currency will be at the discretion of the foreign bank. However, the\namount eligible for inclusion in Tier II capital as subordinated debt will be\nsubject to a maximum ceiling of 50% of the Tier I capital maintained in India.\n(ii) The elements of Tier I & Tier II capital do not include foreign currency loans\ngranted to Indian parties.9\n2.3.8 Group\nThe concept of 'Group' and the task of identification of the borrowers belonging to\nspecific industrial groups is left to the perception of the banks/financial institutions.\nBanks/financial institutions are generally aware of the basic constitution of their\nclientele for the purpose of regulating their exposure to risk assets. The group to\nwhich a particular borrowing unit belongs, may, therefore, be decided by them on the\nbasis of the relevant information available with them, the guiding principle being\ncommonality of management and effective control.\n2.3.9  In the case of a split in the group, if the split is formalised, the splinter groups will be\nregarded as separate groups. If banks and financial institutions have doubts about the\nbona fides  of the split, a reference may be made to RBI for its final view in the matter\nto preclude the possibility of a split being engineered in order to prevent coverage\nunder the Group Approach.\n2.4  Review\nAn annual review of the implementation of exposure management measures may be\nplaced before the Board of Directors before the end of June and a copy each of such\nreview may be furnished for information to the Chief General Manager-in-Charge,\nDepartment of Banking Operations and Development, Central Office, Reserve Bank\nof India, World Trade Centre, Mumbai and to the concerned Regional Offices of the\nDepartment.\n3.  Credit Exposure to Industry and Certain Sectors\n3.1  Internal Exposure Limits\n3.1.1 Fixing of sectoral limits\nApart from limiting the exposures to individual or Group of borrowers, as indicated\nabove, the banks may also consider fixing internal limits for aggregate commitments\nto specific sectors e.g. textiles, jute, tea, etc. so that the exposures are evenly spread\nover various sectors. These limits could be fixed by the banks having regard to the\nperformance of different sectors and the risks perceived. The limits so fixed may be\nreviewed periodically and revised, as necessary.\nBanks with large exposure to corporates should monitor and review on a monthly\nbasis  through a suitable reporting system, the unhedged portion of foreign currency\nexposures  of corporates with relatively large  foreign currency exposures.\n3.1.2 Exposure to Real Estate\nBanks should frame comprehensive prudential norms relating to he ceiling on the total\namount of real estate loans, single/group exposure limits for such loans, margins,\nsecurity, repayment schedule and availability of supplementary finance and the policy\nshould be approved by the bank's Board.10\n3.1.3 While framing the bank's policy, the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank should be\ntaken into account. Banks should ensure that the bank credit is used for productive\nconstruction activity and not for activity connected with speculation in real estate.\n3.2 Exposure to Leasing, Hire Purchase and Factoring Services\n3.2.1  Banks should maintain a balanced portfolio of equipment leasing, hire pur chase and\nfactoring services vis-\u00e0-vis the aggregate credit. Their exposure to each of these\nactivities should not exceed 10 percent of total advances.\n3.3 Exposure to Indian Joint Ventures/Wholly-owned Subsidiaries  Abroad\n3.3.1 Banks are allowed to extend credit/non-credit facilities (viz. letters of credit and\nguarantees) to Indian Joint Ventures/Wholly-owned Subsidiaries abroad. Banks are\nalso permitted to provide at their discretion, buyer's credit/acceptance finance to\noverseas parties for facilitating export of goods & services from India.\n3.3.2.1 The above exposure will, however, be subject to a limit of 10 per cent of banks\u2019\nunimpaired capital funds (Tier I and Tier II capital), subject to the following\nconditions:-\n(i) Loan will be granted only to those joint ventures where the holding by the\nIndian company is more than 51%.\n(ii) Proper systems for management of credit and interest rate risks arising out of\nsuch cross border lending are in place.\n(iii) while extending such facilities, banks will have to comply with Section 25 of\nthe Banking Regulation Act, 1949, in terms of which the assets in India of\nevery banking company at the close of business on the last Friday of every\nquarter shall not be less than 75 percent of its demand and time liabilities in\nIndia. In other words, aggregate assets outside India should not exceed 25\npercent of the bank's demand and time liabilities in India.\n(iv) The resource base for such lending should be funds held in foreign currency\naccounts such as FCNR (B), EEFC, RFC etc. in respect of which banks have\nto manage exchange risk.\n(v) Maturity mismatches arising out of such transactions are within the overall\ngap limits approved by RBI.\n(vi) All existing safeguards / prudential guidelines relating to capital adequacy,\nexposure norms etc. applicable to domestic credit / non-credit exposures are\nadhered to.\nThe above facility is subject to review in April 2004.\nFurther, the loan policy for such credit / non-credit facility should be, inter alia, in\nkeeping with the following ;\n(a) Grant of such loans is based on proper appraisal and commercial viability of\nthe projects and not merely on the reputation of the promoters backing the11\nproject. Non-fund based facilities should be subjected to the same rigorous\nscrutiny as fund based limits.\n(b) The countries where the joint ventures / wholly owned subsidiaries are located\nshould have no restrictions applicable to these companies in regard to\nobtaining foreign currency loans or for repatriation etc. and should permit non-\nresident banks to have legal charge on securities / assets abroad and the right\nof disposal in case of need.\n3.3.3 The banks should also comply with all existing safeguards/prudential guidelines\nrelating to capital adequacy, and exposure norms indicated in paragraph 2.1.1, ibid.\n3.4 Banks\u2019 exposure to the Capital Markets\nThe detailed instructions on Bank Finance against Shares and Debentures are given\nseparately in the Master circular DBOD. No. DIR. BC. 90/13.07.05/98 dated 28\nAugust 1998 on Bank Finance against shares and debentures -- Master Circular read\nwith Circular DBOD. No. BP. BC. 119/21.04.037/2000-01 dated 11 May 2001. The\nsalient features are given below for ready reference.\n3.4.1 Statuto ry Limit on Shareholding in Companies\nIn terms of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, no banking company\nshall hold shares in any company, whether as pledgee , mortgagee or absolute owner,\nof an amount exceeding 30 percent of the paid-up share capital of that company or 30\npercent of its own paid-up share capital and reserves, whichever is less, except as\nprovided in sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Act. Shares held in demat form should\nalso be included for the purpose of determining the exposure limit. This is an\naggregate holding limit for each company .While granting any advance against shares,\nunderwriting an issue of shares, or acquiring any shares on investment account or\neven in lieu of debt of any company, these statutory provisions should be strictly\nobserved.\n3.4.2 Regulatory Limits\nThe bank\u2019s aggregate exposure to the capital markets covering direct investment  by a\nbank in equity shares, convertible bonds and debentures and units of equity oriented\nmutual funds; advances against  shares to individuals  for investment in equity shares\n(including IPOs  ), bonds and debentures, units of equity-oriented  mutual funds etc\nand secured and unsecured advances  to stockbrokers and guarantees issued on behalf\nof stockbrokers and market makers; should not exceed 5 per cent of their total\noutstanding advances (including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous\nyear. This ceiling of 5 per cent prescribed for investment in shares would apply to\ntotal exposure including both fund based and non-fund based to capital market in all\nforms. Within this overall ceiling, banks investment in shares, convertible bonds and\ndebentures and units of equity oriented mutual funds should not exceed 20 percent of\nits networth. The banks are required to adhere this ceiling on an ongoing basis.\n3.4.3 Advances against Shares to Individuals12\nLoans at all the offices of a bank, against the security of shares, debentures and PSU\nbonds to individuals, if held in physical form should not exceed the limit of Rs. 10\nlakh per individual borrower ( Rs 20 lakhs per individual borrower, if the securities are\nheld in demat form). The maximum amount of finance that can be granted to an\nindividual for financing his subscription to an Initial Public Offering ( IPO) is Rs. 10\nlakh.  Finance extended by a bank for IPOs is also  reckoned as an exposure to capital\nmarket and reckoned  within 5% ceiling indicated in para 3.4.2 above . Advances\nagainst units of mutual funds including units of Unit-64 scheme would attract the\nquantum and margin requirements as applicable to advances against shares and\ndebentures wherever stipulated.\n3.4.4  Banks should formulate with the approval of their Boards the Lending Policy for\ngrant of advances to individuals against shares, debentures, bonds keeping in view\nRBI guidelines. As a prudential measure, the banks may also consider laying down\nappropriate aggregate sub limits of such advances.\n3.4.5 Advances against Shares to Stock Brokers and Market Makers\nBanks are free to provide credit facilities to stockbrokers and market makers on the\nbasis of their commercial judgment, within the policy framework approved by their\nBoards. However, in order to avoid any nexus emerging between inter-connected\nstock broking  entities and banks, the Board of each bank should fix, within the overall\nceiling of 5 per cent of their total outstanding advances (including Commercial Paper)\nas on March 31 of the previous year a sub-ceiling for total advances to \u2013\n(i) all the stock brokers and market makers (both fund based and non-fund based,\ni.e. guarantees); and\n(ii) to any single stock broking entity, including its associates/ inter-connected\ncompanies.\n3.4.6  Margins on advances against shares / issue of guarantees\nA uniform margin of 40 per cent shall be applied on all advances / financing of\nIPOs/issue of guarantees. A minimum cash margin of 20 per cent (within the margin\nof 40%) shall be maintained in respect of guarantees issued by banks.\n3.4.7 Arbitrage operations\nBanks should not undertake arbitrage operations themselves or extend credit facilities\ndirectly or indirectly to stockbrokers for arbitrage operations in Stock Exchanges.\nWhile banks are permitted to acquire shares from the secondary market, they should\nensure that no sale transaction is undertaken without actually holding the shares in its\ninvestment account.\n3.4.8 Margin T rading\nBanks may extend finance to stockbrokers for margin trading in actively traded scrips\nforming part of the NSE Nifty and the BSE Sensex, within the overall ceiling of 5%\nprescribed for exposure of banks to capital market.13\n3.5 Bank Loans for Financi ng Promoter\u2019s Contributions\n3.5.1  Loans sanctioned to corporates  against the security of shares (as far as possible demat\nshares) for meeting promoter\u2019s contribution to the equity of new companies in\nanticipation of raising resources, should be treated as bank\u2019s investments in shares\nwhich would thus come under the ceiling of 5 per cent of the bank's total outstanding\nadvances (including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous year\nprescribed for bank\u2019s total exposure including both fund based and non-fund based to\ncapital market in all forms.\n3.5.2 These loans will also be subject to individual/group of borrowers exposure norms as\nwell as the statutory limit on shareholding in companies detailed above.\n3.5.3 In the context of Government of India\u2019s programme of disinvestments of its holdings\nin some public sector undertakings ( PSUs), it has been clarified to banks that they can\nextend finance to the successful bidders for acquisition of shares of these PSUs,\nsubject to certain conditions.    If on account of banks\u2019 financing acquisition of PSU\nshares under the Government of India\u2019s disinvestment programmes, any bank is likely\nto exceed the regulatory ceiling of 5 per cent on capital market exposure in relation to\nits total outstanding advances as on March 31 of the previous year, such  requests for\nrelaxation of the ceiling would be considered by RBI on a case by case basis, subject\nto adequate safeguards regarding margin, bank\u2019s exposure to capital market , internal\ncontrol and risk management systems, etc. The relaxation would be considered in\nsuch a manner  that the bank\u2019s exposure to capital market, in all forms, net of its\nadvances for financing of acquisition of PSU shares shall be within the regulatory\nceiling of 5 per cent.\nRBI would also consider relaxation on specific requests from banks in the individual /\ngroup credit exposure norms on a case by case basis ( in the format prescribed in\nterms of circular DBOD No. BP. 2724/21.03.054/2000-01 dated 28 May 2001),\nprovided that the bank\u2019s total exposure to the borrower, net of its exposure due to\nacquisition of PSU shares under the Government of India disinvestments programme,\nshould be within the prudential individual / group borrower exposure ceiling\nprescribed by RBI.\n3.5.4 Under the refinance scheme of Export Import Bank of India, ( EXIM Bank) the banks\nmay sanction term loans on merits for eligible Indian promoters for acquisition of\nequity in overseas joint ventures/ wholly owned subsidiaries, provided the term loans\nhave been approved by the EXIM Bank for refinance.\n3.6 Risk Management and Internal Control System\nBanks desirous of making investment in equity shares / debentures, financing of\nequities and issue of guarantees within the above ceiling, should observe the\nfollowing guidelines:\na) Investment policy14\n(i) Formulate a transparent policy and procedure for investment in\nshares, etc., with the approval of the Board.\n(ii) The banks should build up adequate expertise in equity\nresearch by establishing a dedicated equity research\ndepartment, wherever warranted by their scale of operations.\nb) Investment Committee\nThe decision in regard to direct investment in shares, convertible bonds\nand debentures  should be taken by an Investment Committee set up by\nthe bank\u2019s Board. The Investment Committee should be held\naccountable for the investments made by the bank.\nc) Risk Management\n(i) Banks should ensure that their exposure to stockbrokers is well\ndiversified in terms of number of broker clients, individual\ninter-connected broking entities;\n(ii) While sanctioning advances to stockbrokers, the banks should\ntake into account the track record and credit worthiness of the\nbroker, financial position of the broker, operations on his own\naccount and on behalf of clients, average turn over period of\nstocks and shares, the extent to which broker\u2019s funds are\nrequired to be involved in his business operations, etc;\n(iii) While processing proposals for loans to stockbrokers, banks are\nalso advised to obtain details of facilities enjoyed by the broker\nand all his connected companies from other banks;\n(iv) While granting advances against shares and debentures to other\nborrowers, banks should obtain details of credit facilities\navailed by them or their associates/inter-connected companies\nfrom other banks for the same purpose (i.e. investment in\nshares etc.) in order to  ensure that high leverage is not built up\nby the borrower or his associate or inter-connected companies\nwith bank finance.\n3.6.1 Audit committee\n(i) The surveillance and monitoring of investment in shares / advances against\nshares shall be done by the Audit Committee of the Board, which shall review\nin each of its meetings, the total exposure of the bank to capital market both\nfund based and non-fund based, in different forms and ensure that the\nguidelines issued by RBI are complied with and adequate risk management\nand internal control systems are in place;15\n(ii) The Audit Committee shall keep the Board informed about the overall\nexposure to capital market, the compliance with the RBI and Board guidelines,\nadequacy of risk management and internal control systems;\n(iii) In order to avoid any possible conflict of interest, it should be ensured that the\nstockbrokers as directors on the Boards of banks or in any other capacity, do\nnot involve themselves in any manner with the Investment Committee or in\nthe decisions in regard to making investments in shares, etc., or advances\nagainst shares.\n3.6.2 Valuation and Disclosure\nEquity shares in a bank\u2019s portfolio - as primary security or as collateral for advances\nor for issue of guarantees and as an investment- should be marked to market\npreferably on a daily basis, but at least on weekly basis. Banks should disclose the\ntotal investments made in equity shares, convertible bonds and debentures and units\nof equity oriented mutual funds as also aggregate advances against shares in the\n\u2018Notes on Account\u2019 to their balance sheets.\n3.7 Bridge Loans\n3.7.1 Banks have been permitted to sanction bridge loans to companies for a period not\nexceeding one year against expected equity flows/issues. Such loans should be\nincluded within the ceiling of 5 per cent of the banks\u2019 total outstanding advances\n(including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous year prescribed for\ntotal exposure including both fund based and non-fund based to capital market in all\nforms.\n3.7.2 Banks should formulate their own internal guidelines with the approval of their Board\nof Directors for grant of such loans, exercising due caution and attention to security\nfor such loans.\n3.7.3 Banks may also extend bridge loans against the expected proceeds of Non-\nConvertible Debentures, External Commercial Borrowings, Global Depository\nReceipts and/or funds in the nature of Foreign Direct Investments, provided the banks\nare satisfied that the borrowing company has already made firm arrangements for\nraising the aforesaid resources/funds.\n3.8 Bank finance to employees to buy shares of their own companies\nBanks may provide finance to employees of companies to buy shares of their own\ncompanies. The advance may be granted upto 90 percent of the purchase price of the\nshares but not exceeding Rs. 50,000/- or six months' salary of the employees,\nwhichever is less.\n4. Exposure norms for investments\n4.1 Banks exposure to capital market as detailed in paragraph 3.4.2 above should be\nwithin the overall ceiling of 5 per cent of the banks total outstanding advances\n(including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the previous year. Within this16\noverall ceiling, banks investment in shares, convertible bonds and debentures and\nunits of equity-oriented mutual funds should not exceed 20 per cent of its net worth.\nThe banks are required to adhere to the ceiling on an ongoing basis and should\nexercise care to see that the limit is not exceeded.\n4.1.1 For the purpose of reckoning compliance with the ceiling for investments prescribed\nabove, the following items are to be included \u2013\n(i) direct investment by a bank in equity shares, convertible bonds and debentures\nand units of equity oriented mutual funds the corpus of which is not\nexclusively invested in corporate debt.\n(ii) bank finance for financing promoter\u2019s contribution towards equity capital of\nnew companies.\n(iii) bridge loans to companies.\n4.1.2 The investment ceiling exclude investment in -\n(i) the subordinated debts of other banks.\n(ii) preference shares,\n(iii) non-convertible debentures/bonds of private corporate bodies,\n(iv) equities/bonds of All-India Financial Institutions\n (as per list given in Annexure 2 ),\n(v) bonds issued by Public Sector Undertakings,\n(vi) units of Mutual Funds under schemes where corpus is invested exclusively in\ndebt instruments,\n(vii) venture capital including units of dedicated venture capital funds meant for\nInformation Technology, and\n(viii) investments in Certificate of Deposits (CDs) of other banks/ financial\ninstitutions.\n4.1.3 However, all these categories of investments are to be taken into consideration for the\npurpose of arriving at the prudential norm of credit exposure for single borrower and\ngroup of borrowers as stipulated in paragraph   2.1.1 above.\n4.1.4 Banks Investment in the Bonds of a Corporate17\nFor the purpose of calculation of exposure norm, investments made by the banks in\nbonds and debentures of corporates, which are guaranteed by a PFI\u00c4, as per list given\nin Annexure 1 , will be treated as an exposure by the bank on the PFI and not on the\ncorporate.\n4.1.5 Guarantees issued by the PFI to the bonds of corporates will be treated as an exposure\nby the PFI to the corporates to the extent of 50 percent being a non-fund facility,\nwhereas the exposure of the bank on the PFI guaranteeing the corporate bond will be\n100 percent. The PFI before guaranteeing the bonds/debentures should, however, take\ninto account the overall exposure of the guaranteed unit to the financial system.\n4.1.6 Banks Investment in Subordinated Debt Instruments\nA high level of cross holding of subordinated debt instruments (issued by banks and\nfinancial institutions to raise Tier II capital) among banks and financial institutions,\ndoes not necessarily lead to accretion of capital to the financial system. As such, a\nbank\u2019s investment in Tier II bonds issued by other banks and financial institutions\nshall be permitted upto 10 percent of the investing bank's total capital. The total\ncapital for this purpose will be the same as that reckoned for the purpose of capital\nadequacy.\n4.1.7 Banks\u2019 Investment in Venture Capital\nIn order to encourage the flow of finance for venture capital, the banks investment in\nventure capital (including units of dedicated Venture Capital Funds meant for\nInformation Technology) would be over and above the ceiling of 5 per cent of the\nbanks total outstanding advances (including Commercial Paper) as on March 31 of the\nprevious year. This would , however, be subject to the condition that the venture\ncapital funds/ companies are registered with SEBI .\n4.2 Underwriting of Corporate Shares and Debentures\nGenerally, there are demands on the banks for underwriting the issues of shares and\ndebentures. In order to ensure that there is no over exposure to underwriting\ncommitments to earn fees, the guidelines detailed below should be strictly adhered to:\n(i) The statutory provision contained in Section 19(2) & (3) of the Banking\nRegulation Act, 1949 regarding holding of shares in any company as pledgee /\nmortgagee or absolute owner, should be strictly adhered to;\n(ii) The banks have to ensure that the shares/debentures including PSU equities\nand shares of other banks, Mutual Funds (the corpus of which is not\n                                                \n\u2297 With the merger of ICICI Ltd. with ICICI Bank Ltd. effective from 30.03.2002, the entire liabilities of ICICI\nLtd. have been taken over by ICICI Bank Ltd. As per the scheme of merger all loans and guarantee facilities to\nICICI Ltd. provided by Government would be transferred to the merged entity.  Similarly, the investments made\nin erstwhile ICICI Ltd. by banks would be treated outside the ceiling of 5% till redemption.18\nexclusively invested in corporate debt instruments), the units of UTI\nsubscribed and/or devolving on them as a part of their underwriting\nobligations in any particular year comply with the ceiling prescribed for the\nbanks\u2019 exposure to the capital markets.\n(iii) It may be noted that the limit placed is on the shares and debentures, that may\nbe held in the banks own portfolio as a result of devolvement and not on the\namount of underwriting that the banks may engage in. Normally, the amount\nof underwriting is a multiple of the amount which devolves finally.\n(iv) The underwriting exposure to any company which will include other funded and\nnon-funded credit limits should not exceed 15 percent ( upto 20 percent provided\nadditional credit exposure is on account of infrastructure project) of capital\nfunds of the banks in the case of a single company and 40 percent (up to 50\npercent, provided the additional credit exposure is on account of extension of\ncredit to infrastructure project) in the case of group of companies.\n(v) While taking up underwriting commitments, banks or their subsidiaries,\nshould ensure that the aggregate of such commitments are included in the\nexposure limits fixed by the Reserve Bank.\n(vi) In the case of underwriting, the commitments under a single obligation should\nbe fixed taking into account the owned funds of banks and the capacity to\nmeet the commitments that may devolve and should not in any case exceed 15\npercent of an issue.\n(vii) Banks should consider sub-underwriting for every underwritten issue so as to\nminimise chances of devolution on their own account. This is not mandatory.\nThe need for and extent of such sub-underwriting is a matter of bank\u2019s\ndiscretion.\n(viii) As part of merchant banking activities, while taking up underwriting\nobligations, banks should carefully evaluate the proposals so as to ensure that\nthe issues will have adequate public response and the prospect of devolution of\nsuch shares/debentures on the underwriting banks will be minimal.\n(ix) ix. Banks should ensure that the portfolio is diversified and that no    unduly\nlarge underwriting obligations are taken up in the shares and debentures of a\ncompany or a group of companies. Banks should make enquiries regarding the\nother underwriters and their capacity to fulfil the obligations.\nBanks should formulate within the above parameters, their own internal guidelines as\napproved by their Boards of Directors on investments in corporate shares/debentures\nof companies or group of companies including norms to ensure that excessive\ninvestment in any single company is avoided and that due attention is given to the\nmaturity structure and quality of such investments.\n4.3 Prohibition s on underwriting operations19\n4.3.1  Banks should not underwrite issue of Commercial Paper by any Company, Primary\nDealer or Satellite Dealer.\n4.3.2 Banks should not extend Revolving Underwriting Facility to short-term Floating Rate\nNotes/Bonds or debentures issued by corporate entities.\n4.3.3 An annual review covering the underwriting operations taken up during the year, with\ncompany-wise details of such operations, the shares/debentures devolved on the\nbanks, the loss (or expected loss) from unloading the devolved shares/debentures\nindicating the face-value and market value thereof, the commission earned, etc. may\nbe placed before their Boards of Directors within 2 months of the close of the fiscal\nyear.\n4.4 Underwriting of bonds of Public Sector Undertakings\nThe banks can play a useful role in relation to issue of bonds by Public Sector\nUndertakings ( PSUs) by underwriting a part of these issues. Banks should subject the\nproposals for underwriting to proper scrutiny having regard to all the relevant factors\nand accept such commitments only on well reasoned commercial considerations with\nthe approval of the appropriate authority.\nThe banks should formulate their own internal guidelines as approved by their Boards\nof Directors on investments in and underwriting of PSU bonds, including norms to\nensure that excessive investment in any single PSU is avoided and that due attention\nis given to the maturity structure of such investments. Banks would also need to take\ninto account that such investments are subject to risk weight and necessary\ndepreciation has to be fully provided for.Such investments in PSU bonds including\nshares and debentures and subscription to Commercial Papers of PSUs should be\nreckoned for the purpose of arriving at prudential norms of credit exposure for single\nborrower and group of borrowers.\nBanks should undertake an annual review of the underwriting operations relating to\nbonds of the public sector undertakings, with PSU-wise details of such operations,\nbonds devolved on the banks, the loss (or expected loss) from unloading the devolved\nbonds indicating the face-value and market value thereof, the commission earned, etc.\nand place the same to their Boards of Directors within two months from the close of\nthe fiscal year.\nWith a view to enabling the banks to deploy their surplus funds more remuneratively,\nthe banks will have the freedom to acquire PSU bonds including through underwriting\ndevolvements without any ceiling.\n4.5 'Safety Net' Schemes for Public Issues of Shares, Debentures, etc .\n4.5.1   'Safety Net' Schemes\nReserve Bank had observed that some banks/their subsidiaries were providing buy-\nback facilities under the name of \u2018Safety Net\u2019 Schemes in respect of certain public\nissues as part of their merchant banking activities. Under such schemes, large\nexposures are assumed by way of commitments to buy the relative securities from the20\noriginal investors at any time during a stipulated period at a price determined at the\ntime of issue, irrespective of the prevailing market price. In some cases, such schemes\nwere offered suo motto  without any request from the company whose issues are\nsupported under the schemes. Apparently, there was no undertaking in such cases\nfrom the issuers to buy the securities. There is also no income commensurate with the\nrisk of loss built into these schemes, as the investor will take recourse to the facilities\noffered under the schemes only when the market value of the securities falls below the\npre-determined price.\nBanks/their subsidiaries have therefore been advised that they should refrain from\noffering such \u2018Safety Net\u2019 facilities by whatever name called.\n4.5.2 Provision of buy back facilities\nIn some cases, the issuers provide buy-back facilities to original investors upto Rs.\n40,000/- in respect of non-convertible debentures after a lock-in-period of one year to\nprovide liquidity to debentures issued by them. If, at the request of the issuers, the\nbanks or their subsidiaries find it necessary to provide additional facilities to small\ninvestors subscribing to new issues, such buy-back arrangements should not entail\ncommitments to buy the securities at pre-determined prices. Prices should be\ndetermined from time to time, keeping in view the prevailing stock market prices for\nthe securities. Commitments should also be limited to a moderate proportion of the\ntotal issue in terms of the amount and should not exceed 20 percent of the owned\nfunds of the banks/their subsidiaries. These commitments will also be subject to the\noverall exposure limits which have been or may be prescribed from time to time.\n5. Limits on exposure to unsecured guarantees and unsecured advances\nBanks have to limit their commitment by way of unsecured guarantees in such a\nmanner that 20 percent of the bank\u2019s outstanding unsecured guarantees plus the total\nof outstanding unsecured advances do not exceed 15 percent of total outstanding\nadvances. Guarantees counter-guaranteed by another bank need not be taken into\naccount for the purpose of the norm. The detailed instructions in this regard are given\nin the Master circular on guarantees and co-acceptances.\n6. Application of prudential norms at group / on consolidated position\nIn terms of guidelines for consolidated accounting and other quantitative methods to\nfacilitate consolidated supervision, banks have inter- alia been advised  that as\nprudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration\nof credit risks, in addition to adherence to  prudential limits on exposures assumed by\nbanks, consolidated banks  should also adhere to the following prudential limits on:\n(i) Single and Group borrower exposures,\n(ii) Capital market exposures, and\n(iii) Exposures by way of unsecured guarantees and unsecured\n(iv) advances.21\n  The operational details i n this regard are furnished below.\ni)  Exposure by the consolidated bank to a single borrower/ debtor should not exceed 15%\nof its  capital funds. Exposure by the consolidated bank  to a borrower/ debtor group\nshould not exceed 40% of its  capital funds. The aggregate exposure on a borrower/\ndebtor group can exceed the exposure norm of 40% by an additional 10% (i.e. up to\n50%) provided the additional exposure is for the purpose of financing infrastructure\nprojects. Computation of capital funds, exposure etc. would be on par with the\nmethodology adopted for banks.\nii) The consolidated bank\u2019s  aggregate exposure to capital markets should not exceed 2 per\ncent of  its total on-balance-sheet  assets (excluding intangible assets and accumulated\nlosses) as on March 31 of the previous year. This ceiling will apply to the consolidated\nbank\u2019s  exposure to capital market in all forms, including both fund based and non-fund\nbased, similar to the computation for the parent bank.   Within the total limit, investment\nin shares, convertible bonds and debentures and units of equity-oriented mutual funds\nshould not exceed 10 percent of consolidated bank\u2019s  net worth.\niii) The norms relating to unsecured guarantees and unsecured funded exposures on the lines\nof the guidelines issued to banks vide circular DBOD.No.666/C.96/(Z)-67 dated May 3,\n1967, as amended from time to time, are also extended to the consolidated bank.\nFor the purpose of application of prudential norms on a group wise basis, a 'consolidated\nbank'  is defined as a group of entities, which include a licensed bank, which may or may not\nhave subsidiaries.22\nAnnexure 1\nMaster Circular on Exposure Norms\nList of All-India Financial Institutions\n(Counter party exposure and assignment of Risk weight- List of institutions guaranteeing\nbonds of corporates  )\n[Vide paragraph 2.3.4  & 4.1.4]\n1.

The guarantees\nexecuted by banks comprise both performance guarantees  and financial guarantees .\nThe guarantees are structured according to the terms of agreement, viz., security ,\nmaturity  and purpose .2\nWith the introduction of risk weights for both on-Balance Sheet and off-Balance\nSheet exposures the banks have become more risk sensitive resulting in structuring of\ntheir business exposures in a more prudent manner.\n2. GUIDELINES RELATI NG TO THE CONDUCT OF GUARANTEE BUSINESS\n2.1 General Guidelines\nThe banks should comply with the following general guidelines in the conduct of their\nguarantee business:\nAs regards the purpose of the guarantee, as a general rule, the banks should confine\nthemselves to the provision of financial guarantees  and exercise due caution with\nregard to performance guarantee business.\nAs regards maturity , as a rule, banks should guarantee shorter maturities and leave\nlonger maturities to be guaranteed by other institutions. No bank guarantee should\nnormally have a maturity of more than 10 years.\n2.2 Norms for unsecured advances  & guarantees\nAs regards security, banks should limit their commitments by way of unsecured\nguarantees in such a manner that 20 percent of a bank\u2019s outstanding unsecured\nguarantees plus the total of its outstanding unsecured advances  should not exceed 15\npercent of its total outstanding advances.  For the purpose of conforming to this norm,\nthe following types of guarantees need not  be taken into account:\n(i) guarantees counter-guaranteed  by another bank;\n(ii) Bid bonds and guarantees executed by banks in respect of contracts secured by Indian\nfirms in foreign countries and guarantees relating to exports;\n(iii) guarantees in respect of which ECGC would be issuing its Export Performance\nGuarantee;\n(iv) performance guarantees  executed by banks on behalf of small scale industries;\n(v) guarantees issued in lieu of earnest money on behalf of contractors at the time of\nsubmission of tenders, provided the tenders have been rejected and the rejection is\nsupported by a note issued by the Government Department concerned;\n(vi) performance guarantees  issued on behalf of contractors, provided the contractors\nproduce a certificate from the appropriate authority that the contracts have been\nfulfilled by them satisfactorily;\n(vii) guarantees issued by the branches of foreign banks in India on behalf of their Head\nOffices;\n(viii) guarantees covered by counter-guarantees of the Central Government or the State\nGovernments, public sector financial institutions and insurance companies which are\nto be regarded as secured guarantees;\n(ix) deferred payment guarantees  backed by adequate tangible security or by counter-\nguarantees of the Central Government or the State Governments or public sector\nfinancial institutions, or by counter-guarantees of insurance companies or other banks,\nprovided the counter-guarantees of insurance companies or other banks are3\nthemselves backed by adequate tangible security. Where the counter-guarantees by\ncommercial banks are backed by adequate tangible securities, then all guarantees,\nincluding deferred payment guarantees, will be treated as secured guarantees.\n2.3 Exclusions from the Norms\nSimilarly, various types of unsecured advances  listed in Annexure 1  need not be\nincluded in the total of unsecured advances while applying the norms relating to\nunsecured advances and guarantees indicated above.\n(i) As a rule, banks should avoid giving unsecured guarantees in large amounts\nand for medium and long term period. They should avoid undue concentration\nof such unsecured guarantee commitments to particular groups of customers\nand/or trades.\n(ii) Unsecured guarantees  on account of any individual constituent should be\nlimited to a reasonable proportion of the bank\u2019s total unsecured guarantees.\nGuarantees on behalf of individual should also bear a reasonable proportion to\nconstituent\u2019s equity.\n(iii) In exceptional cases, banks may give deferred payment guarantees  on an\nunsecured basis for modest amounts to first class customers who have entered\ninto deferred payment arrangements in consonance with Government policy.\nBut such unsecured guarantees should be accommodated within the limits\nindicated above.\n(iv) Guarantees executed on behalf of any individual constituent, or a group of\nconstituents, should be subject to prescribed exposure norms.\n(v) When any bank reaches a stage where it is likely to exceed the norm, it should\nnot undertake any further commitment on account of guarantees.\n(vi) Suitable arrangements may be made to keep a watch from time to time about\nthe outstanding guarantees of the bank so as to ensure that it does not exceed\nthe norm.\nIt is essential to realise that guarantees contain inherent risks and that it would not be\nin the bank\u2019s interest or in the public interest generally to encourage parties to over-\nextend their commitments and embark upon enterprises solely relying on the easy\navailability of guarantee facilities.\n2.4 Precautions for Averting Frauds\nWhile issuing guarantees on behalf of customers, the following safeguards should be\nobserved by the banks:\n(i) At the time of issuing financial  guarantees , banks should be satisfied that the\ncustomer would be in a position to reimburse the bank in case the bank is\nrequired to make the payment under the guarantee.\n(ii) In the case of performance  guarantee, banks should exercise due caution and\nhave sufficient experience with the customer to satisfy themselves that the\ncustomer has the necessary experience, capacity and means to perform the\nobligations under the contract and is not likely to commit any default.4\n(iii) Banks should normally refrain from issuing guarantees on behalf of customers\nwho do not enjoy credit facilities with them.\n2.5 Ghosh Committee Recommendations\nBanks should implement the following recommendations made by the High Level\nCommittee (Chaired by Shri A. Ghosh, the then Dy. Governor of RBI):\n(i) In order to prevent unaccounted issue of guarantees, as well as fake\nguarantees, as suggested by IBA, bank guarantees may be issued in serially\nnumbered security forms.\n(ii) Guarantees above a particular cut-off point decided by the bank should be\nissued under two signatures, in triplicate, one copy each for the branch,\nbeneficiary and controlling office/head office.\n(iii) It should be binding on the part of the beneficiary to seek confirmation of the\ncontrolling office/head office as well, for which a specific stipulation be\nincorporated in the guarantee itself.\n2.6 Internal Control Systems\nBank guarantees issued for Rs. 10,000/- and above should be signed by two officials\njointly. A lower cut-off point depending upon the size and category of branches may\nbe prescribed by banks, where considered necessary. Such a system will reduce the\nscope for malpractices/losses arising from the wrong perception/judgement or lack of\nhonesty/ integrity on the part of a single signatory. Banks should evolve suitable\nsystems and procedures, keeping in view the spirit of these instructions and allow\ndeviation from the two signatures discipline only in exceptional circumstances. The\nresponsibility for ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems and\nprocedures for preventing perpetration of frauds and malpractices by their officials\nwould, in such cases, rest on the top managements of the banks. In case, exceptions\nare made for affixing of only one signature on the instruments, banks should devise a\nsystem for subjecting such instruments to special scrutiny by the auditors or\ninspectors at the time of internal inspection of branches.\n2.7 Guarantees on behalf of Banks' Directors\nSection 20 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 prohibits banks from granting loans\nor advances to any of their directors or any firm or company in which any of their\ndirectors is a partner or guarantor.\nHowever, certain facilities which, inter alia, include issue of guarantees are not\nregarded as 'loan and advances' within the meaning of Section 20 of the Act, ibid.\nIn this regard, it is pertinent to note with particular reference to banks giving\nguarantees on behalf of their directors, that in the event of the principal debtor\ncommitting default in discharging his liability and the bank being called upon to\nhonour its obligation under the guarantee, the relationship between the bank and the\ndirector could become one of creditor and debtor. Further, directors would also be\nable to evade the provisions of Section 20 by borrowing from a third party against the\nguarantee given by the bank. These types of transactions are likely to defeat the very5\npurpose of enacting Section 20, if the banks do not take appropriate steps to ensure\nthat the liabilities thereunder do not devolve on them.\nIn view of the above, banks should, while extending non-fund based facilities such as\nguarantees, etc. on behalf of directors and the companies/firms in which the director is\ninterested, ensure that -\n(i) adequate and effective arrangements have been made to the satisfaction of the\nbank that the commitments would be met out of their own resources by the\nparty on whose behalf guarantee was issued, and\n(ii) the bank will not be called upon to grant any loan or advances to meet the\nliability consequent upon the invocation of guarantee.\nIn case, such contingencies arise as at (ii) above, the bank will be deemed to be a\nparty to the violation of the provisions of Section 20 of the Banking Regulation Act,\n1949.\n2.8 Bank Guarantee Scheme  of Government of India\nThe Bank Guarantee Scheme  formulated by the Government of India for the issuance\nof bank guarantees in favour of Central Government Departments, in lieu of security\ndeposits, etc. by contractors, has been modified from time to time. Under the scheme,\nit is open to Government Departments to accept freely guarantees, etc. from all\nscheduled commercial banks.\nBanks should adopt the Model Form of Bank Guarantee Bond given in Annexure 2.\nThe Government of India have advised all the Government departments/Public Sector\nUndertakings, etc. to accept bank guarantees in the Model Bond and to ensure that\nalterations/additions to the clauses whenever considered necessary are not one-sided\nand are made in agreement with the guaranteeing bank.\nBanks should mention in the guarantee bonds and their correspondence with the\nvarious State Governments, the names of the beneficiary departments and the\npurposes for which the guarantees are executed. This is necessary to facilitate prompt\nidentification of the guarantees with the concerned departments. In regard to the\nguarantees furnished by the banks in favour of Government Departments in the name\nof the President of India, any correspondence thereon should be exchanged with the\nconcerned ministries/departments and not with the President of India.\nIn respect of guarantees issued in favour of Directorate General of Supplies and\nDisposal,  the following aspects should be kept in view:\nq In order to speed up the process of verification of the genuineness of the bank\nguarantee, the name, designation and code numbers of the officer/officers signing the\nguarantees should be incorporated under the signature(s) of officials signing the bank\nguarantee.\nq The beneficiary of the bank guarantee should also be advised to invariably obtain the\nconfirmation of the concerned banks about the genuineness of the guarantee issued\nby them as a measure of safety.\nq The initial period of the bank guarantee issued by banks as a means of security in\nDirectorate General of Supplies and Disposal contract administration would be for a6\nperiod of six months beyond the original delivery period. Banks may incorporate a\nsuitable clause in their bank guarantee providing automatic extension of the validity\nperiod of the guarantee by 6 months, and also obtain suitable undertaking from the\ncustomer at the time of establishing the guarantee to avoid any possible complication\nlater.\nq A clause would be incorporated by Directorate General of Supplies and Disposal in\nthe tender forms of Directorate General of Supplies and Disposal 229 (Instruction to\nthe tenderers ) to the effect that whenever a firm fails to supply the stores within the\ndelivery period of the contract wherein bank guarantee has been furnished, the\nrequest for extension for delivery period will automatically be taken as an agreement\nfor getting the bank guarantee extended. Banks should make similar provisions in the\nbank guarantees for automatic extension of the guarantee period.\nq The bank guarantee as a means of security in Directorate General of Supplies and\nDisposal contract administration and extension letters thereof would be on non-\njudicial stamp papers.\n2.9 Guarantees on Behalf of Share and Stock Brokers\nBanks may issue guarantees on behalf of share and stock brokers in favour of stock\nexchanges in lieu of security deposit to the extent it is acceptable in the form of bank\nguarantee as laid down by stock exchanges. Banks may also issue guarantees in lieu\nof margin requirements as per stock exchange regulations. The banks have further\nbeen advised that they should obtain a minimum margin of 40 percent while issuing\nsuch guarantees. A minimum cash margin of 20 per cent (within the above margin of\n40 per cent) should be maintained in respect of such guarantees issued by banks. The\nabove margin of 40 per cent will apply to all fresh guarantees issued. The existing\nguarantees issued may continue at the earlier margins until they come up for renewal.\nThe banks should assess the requirement of each applicant borrower; observe usual\nand necessary safeguards including the exposure ceilings.\n2.10 Guidelines relatin g to obtaining of personal guarantees of directors and other\nmanagerial personnel of borrowing concerns\nPersonal guarantees  of directors\nThe banks could take personal guarantees of directors for the credit facilities, etc.\ngranted to the corporates, public or private, only, when absolutely warranted after a\ncareful examination of the circumstances of the case and not as a matter of course.  In\norder to identify the circumstances under which the guarantee may or may not be\nconsidered necessary, the banks could follow the following broad considerations:\nA Where guarantees need not be considered necessary\nOrdinarily, in the case of public limited companies, when the lending institutions are\nsatisfied about the management, its stake in the concern, economic viability of the\nproposal and the financial position and capacity for cash generation, no personal\nguarantee need be insisted upon.  In fact, in the case of widely owned public  limited\ncompanies, which may be rated as first class and satisfying the above conditions,7\nguarantees may not be necessary even if the advances are unsecured.  Also, in the\ncase of companies, whether private or public, which are under professional\nmanagement, guarantees may not be insisted upon from persons who are connected\nwith the management solely by virtue of their professional/technical qualifications\nand not consequent upon any significant share holding in the company concerned.\nWhere the lending institutions are not so convinced about the aspects of loan\nproposals mentioned above, they should seek to stipulate conditions to make the\nproposals acceptable without such guarantees.  In some cases, more stringent forms of\nfinancial discipline like restrictions on distribution of dividends, further expansion,\naggregate borrowings, creation of further charge on assets and stipulation of\nmaintenance of minimum net working capital may be necessary.  Also, the parity\nbetween owned funds and capital investment and the overall debt-equity ratio may\nhave to be taken into account.\nB. Where guarantees may be considered helpful\nPersonal guarantees  of directors may be helpful in respect of companies, whether\nprivate or public, where shares are held closely by a person or connected persons or a\ngroup (not being professionals or Government), irrespective of other factors, such as\nfinancial condition, security available, etc. The exception being in respect of\ncompanies where, by court or statutory order, the management of the company is\nvested in a person or persons, whether called directors or by any other name, who are\nnot required to be elected by the shareholders. Where personal guarantee is\nconsidered necessary, the guarantee should preferably be that of the principal\nmembers of the group holding shares in the borrowing company rather than that of the\ndirector/managerial personnel functioning as director or in any managerial capacity.\nEven if a company is not closely held there may be justification for a personal\nguarantee of directors to ensure continuity of management. Thus, a lending institution\ncould make a loan to a company whose management is considered good.\nSubsequently, a different group, could acquire control of the company, which could\nlead the lending institution to have well-founded fears that the management has\nchanged for the worse and that the funds lent to the company are in jeopardy.  One\nway by which lending institutions could protect themselves in such circumstances is\nto obtain guarantees of the directors and thus to ensure either the continuity of the\nmanagement or that the changes in management take place with their knowledge.\nEven where personal guarantees are waived it may be necessary to obtain an\nundertaking from the borrowing company that no change in the management would\nbe made without the consent of the lending institution.  Similarly, during the\nformative stages of a company, it may be in the interest of the company, as well as the\nlending institution, to obtain guarantees to ensure continuity of management.\nPersonal guarantees  of directors may be helpful with regard to public limited\ncompanies other than those which may be rated as first class, where the advance is on\nan unsecured basis.8\nThere may be public limited companies, whose financial position and/or capacity for\ncash generation is not satisfactory even though the relevant advances are secured. In\nsuch cases personal guarantees are useful.\nCases where there is likely to be considerable delay in the creation of a charge on\nassets, guarantee may be taken, where deemed necessary, to cover the interim period\nbetween the disbursement of loan and the creation of the charge on assets.\nThe guarantee of parent companies may be obtained in the case of subsidiaries whose\nown financial condition is not considered satisfactory.\nPersonal guarantees  are relevant where the balance sheet or financial statement of a\ncompany disclosed interlocking of funds between the company and other concerns\nowned or managed by a group.\nC. Worth of the guarantors, payment of guarantee, commission, etc.\nWhere personal guarantees of directors are warranted they should bear reasonable\nproportion to the estimated worth of the person.  The system of obtaining guarantees\nshould not be used by the directors and other managerial personnel as a source of\nincome from the company.  The banks should obtain an undertaking from the\nborrowing company as well as the guarantors that no consideration whether by way of\ncommission, brokerage fees or any other form would be paid by the former or\nreceived by the latter directly or indirectly.  This requirement should be incorporated\nin the bank's terms and conditions for sanctioning of credit limits.  During the periodic\ninspections, the bank's inspectors should verify that this stipulation has been complied\nwith.  There may, however, be exceptional cases where payment of remuneration may\nbe permitted e.g. where assisted concerns are not doing well and the existing\nguarantors are no longer connected with the management but continuance of their\nguarantees is considered essential because the new management's guarantee is either\nnot available or is found inadequate and payment of remuneration to guarantors by\nway of guarantee commission, allowed.\nD Personal guarantee s in the case of sick units\nAs the personal guarantees of promoters/directors generally instil greater\naccountability and responsibility on their part and prompt the managements  to\nconduct the running of the assisted units on sound and healthy lines and to ensure\nfinancial discipline, the banks, may in their discretion, obtain guarantees from\ndirectors (excluding the nominee directors) and other managerial personnel in their\nindividual capacities.  In case, for any reasons, a guarantee is not considered\nexpedient by the bank at the time of sanctioning the advance, an undertaking should\nbe obtained from the individual directors and a covenant should invariably be\nincorporated in the loan agreement that in case the borrowing unit show cash losses or\nadverse current ratio or diversion of fund, the directors should be under an obligation\nto execute guarantees in their individual capacities, if required by the banks.  The9\nbanks may also obtain guarantees at their discretion from parent/holding company\nwhen credit facilities are extended to borrowing units in the same Group.\n2.11 Guarantees of State Government\nThe guidelines laid down in paragraph 2.10 above for taking personal guarantees of\ndirectors and other managerial personnel should also be followed in respect of\nproposal of State Government undertakings/projects and guarantees may not be\ninsisted upon unless absolutely warranted. In other words, banks could obtain\nguarantees of State Governments on merits and only in circumstances absolutely\nnecessary after thorough examination of the circumstances of each case and not as\nmatter of course.\n3. BID BONDS AND PER FORMANCE BONDS OR GUARANTEES FOR\nEXPORTS\n3.1 Exchange Control  Stipulations\nIn terms of Notification No.FEMA/8/2000-RB dated 3rd May 2000, authorised dealers\nhave the permission to give performance bond or guarantee in favour of overseas\nbuyers on account of bona fide  exports from India.\nPrior approval of RBI should be obtained by the authorised dealers for issue of\nperformance bonds/guarantees in respect of caution listed exporters.\nBefore issuing any such guarantees, they should satisfy themselves with the bona\nfides of the applicant and his capacity to perform the contract and also that the value\nof the bid/guarantee as a percentage of the value of the contract/tender is reasonable\nand according to the normal practice in international trade and that the terms of the\ncontract are in accordance with the Exchange Control  regulations .\nAuthorised dealers, may also, subject to what has been stated above, issue counter-\nguarantees in favour of their branches/ correspondents abroad in cover of guarantees\nrequired to be issued by the latter on behalf of Indian exporters in cases where\nguarantees of only resident banks are acceptable to overseas buyers in accordance\nwith local laws/regulations.\nIf and when the bond/guarantee is invoked, authorised dealers may make payments\ndue thereunder to non-resident beneficiaries but a report should be sent to RBI where\nthe amount of the remittance exceeds US$ 5,000 or its equivalent.\n3.2 Other Stipulations\nWith a view to boost exports, banks should adopt a flexible approach in the matter of\nobtaining cover and earmarking of assets/credit limits, drawing power, while issuing\nbid bonds and performance guarantees  for export purposes. Banks may, however,\nsafeguard their interests by obtaining an Export Performance Guarantee of ECGC,\nwherever considered necessary.\nExport Credit & Guarantee Corporation ( ECGC) would provide 90 percent cover for\nbid bonds, provided the banks give an undertaking not to insist on cash margins.\nThe banks may not, therefore, ask for any cash margin in respect of bid bonds and\nguarantees which are counter-guaranteed  by ECGC.10\nIn other cases, where such counter-guarantees of ECGC are not available, for\nwhatever reasons, the banks may stipulate a reasonable cash margin only where it is\nconsidered absolutely necessary, as they satisfy themselves generally about the\ncapacity and financial position of the exporter while issuing such bid\nbonds/guarantees.\nBanks may consider sanctioning separate limits for issue of bid bonds. Within the\nlimits so sanctioned, bid bonds against individual contracts may be issued, subject to\nusual considerations.\nAs per FEDAI Rules, the banks may refund 50 percent of the commission received by\nthem on the bid bonds which are cancelled due to non-acceptance of tender.\n3.3 Unconditional Guarantees in favour of Overseas Employers/ Importers on behalf\nof Indian Exporters\nWhile agreeing to give unconditional guarantee in favour of overseas\nemployers/importers on behalf of Indian Exporters, the banks should obtain an\nundertaking from the exporter to the effect that when the guarantee is invoked, the\nbank would be entitled to make payment notwithstanding any dispute between the\nexporter and the importer. Although, such an undertaking may not prevent the\nexporter from approaching the Court for an injunction order, it might weigh with the\nCourt in taking a view whether injunction order should be issued.\nBanks may, while issuing guarantees in future, keep the above points in view and\nincorporate suitable clauses in the agreement in consultation with their legal advisers.\nThis is considered desirable as non-honouring of guarantees on invocation might\nprompt overseas banks not to accept guarantees of Indian banks, thus hampering the\ncountry's export promotion effort.\n3.4 Certain Precautions in case of Project Exports\nBanks are aware that the Working Group mechanism has been evolved for the\npurpose of giving package approvals in principle at pre-bid/post-bid stages for high\nvalue overseas project exports. The role of the Working Group is mainly regulatory in\nnature, but the responsibility of project appraisal and that of monitoring the project\nlies solely on the sponsor bank.\nAs the Working Group approvals are based on the recommendations of the sponsor\nbanks, the latter should examine the project proposals thoroughly with regard to the\ncapacity of the contractor/ sub-contractors, protective clauses in the contracts,\nadequacy of security, credit ratings of the overseas sub-contractors, if any, etc.\nTherefore, the need for a careful assessment of financial and technical demands\ninvolved in the proposals vis-\u00e0-vis the capability of the contractors (including sub-\ncontractors) as well as the overseas employers can hardly be under-rated to the\nfinancing of any domestic projects. In fact, the export projects should be given more\nattention in view of their high values and the possibilities of foreign exchange losses\nin case of failure apart from damage to the image of Indian entrepreneurs.\nWhile bid bonds and performance guarantees  cannot be avoided, it is to be considered\nwhether guarantees should be given by the banks in all cases of overseas borrowings\nfor financing overseas projects. Such guarantees should not be executed as a matter of\ncourse merely because of the participation of Exim Bank and availability of counter-11\nguarantee of ECGC. Appropriate arrangements should also be made for post-award\nfollow-up and monitoring of the contracts.\n3.5 Review of Bank s Procedures\nBanks may review the position regarding delegation of powers and their procedures,\nand take such action as may be necessary with a view to expediting decision on export\nproposals. They may also consider designating a specified branch, equipped with\nadequately qualified and trained staff, in each important Centre to deal expeditiously\nwith all export credit proposals at the Centre.\n3.6 Other Guarantees Regulated by Exchange Control  Rules\nIssue of following types of guarantees are governed by the Exchange Control\nRegulations:\n(i) Minor Guarantees\n(ii) Bank Guarantees - Import under Foreign Loans/Credits\n(iii) Guarantees for Non-Residents\nFor operative instructions, a reference may be made to notification issued under\nFEMA/8/ 2000 dated 3rd May 2000 cited above as well as to the directions issued vide\nAP(DIR) circulars Nos. 9 and 12 dated 24th  Aug 2000 and 9th September 2000\nrespectively relating to Imports/Exports. However, for ease of reference,\ninstructions/guidelines in regard to issue of these guarantees are reproduced\nhereunder:\n3.6.1 Minor guarantees\nAuthorised dealers may freely give on behalf of their customers and overseas\nbranches and correspondents, guarantees in the ordinary course of business in respect\nof missing or defective documents, authenticity of signatures and for other similar\npurposes.\n3.6.2 Bank guarantees - Import under foreign loans/credits\nIssue of guarantees in favour of foreign lenders or suppliers (in the case of Supplier\u2019s\nCredits) requires approval of RBI. While granting approval for raising the foreign\ncurrency loan/credit, RBI will grant the required permission to the concerned\nauthorised dealer. In the event of invocation of the guarantee, the concerned\nauthorised dealer may make the necessary remittance without reference to RBI. A\nreport should, however, be sent to RBI giving full details citing reference to the\napproval for furnishing the guarantee. A copy of the claim received from the overseas\nparty should be enclosed with such report.\n3.6.3 Loans abroad against securities provided in India\nGiving of guarantees by banks in India to banks and others outside India for the\npurpose of grant of loans or overdrafts abroad is prohibited.\n3.6.4 Guarantees for non-residents\nReserve Bank has granted general permission to authorised dealers vide its\nNotification No. FEMA/8/ 2000 dated 3rd May 2000 to give guarantees in favour of\npersons resident in India in respect of any debt or other obligation or liability of a12\nperson resident outside India, subject to such instructions as may be issued by RBI\nfrom time to time.\nAuthorised dealers may accordingly give on behalf of their overseas\nbranches/correspondents or a bank of international repute guarantees/performance\nbonds in favour of residents of India in connection with genuine transactions\ninvolving debt, liability or obligation of non-residents , provided the bond/ guarantee\nis covered by a counter-guarantee of the overseas Head Office/branch/ correspondent\nor a bank of international repute.\nAuthorised dealers should ensure that counter-guarantees are properly evaluated and\ntheir own guarantees against such guarantees are not issued in routine manner. Before\nissuing a guarantee against the counter-guarantee from an overseas Head\nOffice/branch/ correspondent/bank of international repute, authorised dealers should\nsatisfy themselves that the obligations under the counter-guarantee, when invoked,\nwould be honoured by the overseas bank promptly. If the authorised dealer desires to\nissue guarantee with the condition that payment will be made, provided\nreimbursement has been received from the overseas bank which had issued the\ncounter-guarantee, this fact should be made clearly known to the beneficiary in the\nguarantee document itself.\nAuthorised dealers may make rupee payments to the resident beneficiaries\nimmediately when the guarantee is invoked and simultaneously arrange to obtain the\nreimbursement from the overseas bank concerned, which had issued the counter-\nguarantee.\nCases where payments are not received by the authorised dealers when the guarantees\nof overseas banks are invoked, should be reported to RBI indicating the steps being\ntaken by the bank to recover the amount due under the guarantee.\nAuthorised dealers may issue guarantees in favour of overseas organisations issuing\ntravellers cheques in respect of blank travellers cheques stocked for sale by them or\non behalf of their constituents who are full-fledged money changers holding valid\nlicences from Reserve Bank, subject to suitable counter-guarantee being obtained\nfrom the latter. In the event of the guarantee being invoked, authorised dealers may\neffect remittance but should send a separate report thereon furnishing full details to\nthe Chief General Manager, Exchange Control  Department, ( Forex Markets Division),\nReserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai -     400 001.\n4. Restrictions on guarantees of inter-company deposits/loans\nBanks should not execute guarantees covering inter-company deposits/loans thereby\nguaranteeing refund of deposits/loans accepted by NBFC/firms from other\nNBFC/firms.\n4.1 Restriction on guarantees for placement of funds with NBFCs\nThese instructions would cover all types of deposits/loans irrespective of their source,\nincluding deposits/loans received by NBFCs  from trusts and other institutions.\nGuarantees should not be issued for the purpose of indirectly enabling the placement\nof deposits with NBFCs .\n4.2 Restrictions on Inter-Institutional Guarantees13\n4.2.1 The banks should not execute guarantees covering inter-company deposits/loans.\nGuarantees should not also be issued for the purpose of indirectly enabling the\nplacement of deposits with non-banking institutions. This stipulation will apply to all\ntypes of deposits/loans irrespective of their source, e.g. deposits/loans received by\nnon-banking companies from trusts and other institutions.\n4.2.2 The transactions of the  following type are in the nature of guarantees executed by\nbanks in respect of funds made available by one non-banking to another non-banking\ncompany and the banks should therefore, desist from such practices: -\nA seller drew bills, normally of 120 to 180 days usance, on the buyer which were\naccepted by the buyer and co-accepted by his banker. The bills were discounted by\nthe seller with the accommodating company which retained the bills till the due date.\nThe bank which gave co-acceptance  invariably earmarked funds for the liability\nunder the bills against the drawing power in respect of stocks held in the cash credit\naccount of its client, the buyer, or\nThe accommodating company kept deposits for a specific period with the bank's\nborrowers under a guarantee executed by the bank. In such a case also the bank\nearmarked the amount a gainst drawing power available in the cash credit account.\n4.2.3 Banks may issue guarantees favouring other banks/ FIs/other lending agencies for the\nloans extended by the latter, subject to strict compliance with the following\nconditions.\n(i) The Board of Directors should reckon the integrity/robustness of the of the\nbank\u2019s risk management systems and accordingly put in place a well-laid out\npolicy in this regard.\nThe Board approved policy should, among others, address the following issues:\na) Prudential limits, linked to bank\u2019s Tier I capital, up to which guarantees\nfavouring other banks/ FIs/other lending agencies may be issued.\nb) Nature and extent of security and margins\nc) Delegation of powers\nd) Reporting system\ne) Periodical reviews\n(ii) The guarantee shall be extended only in respect of borrower constituents and\nto enable them to avail of additional credit facility from other\nbanks/ FIs/lending agencies\n(iii) The guaranteeing bank shall  assume a funded exposure of at least 10% of the\nexposure guaranteed.14\n(iv) Banks should not extend guarantees or letters of comfort in favour of overseas\nlenders including those assignable to overseas lenders, except for the\nrelaxations permitted under FEMA.\n(v) The guarantee issued by the bank will be an exposure on the borrowing entity\non whose behalf the guarantee has been issued and will attract appropriate risk\nweight as per the extant guidelines.\n(vi) Banks should ensure compliance with the recommendations of the Ghosh\nCommittee and other internal requirements relating to issue of guarantees to\nobviate the possibility of frauds in this area.\nLending banks\nBanks extending credit facilities against the guarantees issued by other banks/ FIs should\nensure strict compliance with the following  conditions:\n(i) The exposure assumed by the bank against the guarantee of another bank/ FI\nwill be deemed as an exposure on the guaranteeing bank/ FI and will attract\nappropriate risk weight as per the extant guidelines.\n(ii) Exposures assumed by way of credit facilities extended against the guarantees\nissued by other banks should be reckoned within the inter bank exposure limits\nprescribed by the Board of Directors. Since the exposure assumed by the bank\nagainst the guarantee of another bank/ FI will be for a fairly longer term than\nthose assumed on account of inter bank dealings in the money market, foreign\nexchange market and securities market, Board of Directors should fix an\nappropriate sub-limit for the longer term exposures since these exposures\nattract greater risk.\n(iii) Banks should monitor the exposure assumed on the guaranteeing bank/ FI, on a\ncontinuous basis and ensure strict compliance with the prudential limits/sub\nlimits prescribed by the Board for banks and the prudential single borrower\nlimits prescribed by RBI for FIs.\n(iv) Banks should comply with the recommendations of the Ghosh Committee and\nother internal requirements relating to acceptance of guarantees of other banks\nto obviate the possibility of frauds in this area.\n4.2.4 Exceptions\nIn regard to rehabilitation of sick/weak industrial units , in exceptional cases, where\nbanks are unable to participate in rehabilitation packages on account of temporary\nliquidity constraints, the concerned banks could provide guarantees in favour of the\nbanks which take up their additional share. Such guarantees will remain extant until\nsuch time the banks providing additional finance against guarantees are re-\ncompensated.\nIn respect of infrastructure projects, banks may  issue guarantees favouring other\nlending institutions, provided the bank issuing the guarantee takes a funded share in\nthe project at least to the extent of 5 percent of the project cost and undertakes normal\ncredit appraisal, monitoring and follow up of the project.\nBanks may issue guarantees in favour of Industrial Development Bank of India\n(IDBI) in the case of import of technical know-how by way of drawings and designs15\nunder the Technical Development Scheme of the IDBI, under certain circumstances\nand where no tangible security is available to IDBI.\nIn cases of Sellers Line of Credit Scheme  (SLCS ) operated by other all India financial\ninstitutions like IDBI , SIDBI , PFC, etc for sale of machinery, the primary credit is\nprovided by the seller\u2019s bank to the seller through bills drawn on the buyer and\nseller\u2019s bank has no access to the security covered by the transaction which remains\nwith the buyer. As such, buyer\u2019s banks are permitted to extend guarantee/co-\nacceptance  facility for the bills drawn under seller\u2019s line of credit.\nSimilarly guarantees can be issued in favour of HUDCO /State Housing Boards and\nsimilar bodies/ organisations for the loans granted by them to private borrowers who\nare unable to offer clear and marketable title to property, provided banks are\notherwise satisfied with the capacity of the borrowers to adequately service such\nloans.\nBanks may sanction issuance of guarantees on behalf of their constituents, favouring\nDevelopment Agencies/Boards like Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency,\nNational Horticulture Board, etc., for obtaining soft loans and/or other forms of\ndevelopment assistance.\n4.2.5 Infrastructure projects\nKeeping in view the special features of lending to infrastructure projects viz., high\ndegree of appraisal skills on the part of lenders and availability of resources of a\nmaturity  matching with the project period, banks have been given discretion in the\nmatter of issuance of guarantees favouring other lending agencies, in respect of\ninfrastructure projects alone, subject to the following conditions:\nThe bank issuing the guarantee takes a funded share in the project at least to the extent\nof 5 percent of the project cost and undertakes normal credit appraisal, monitoring and\nfollow-up of the project.\nthe guarantor bank has a satisfactory record in compliance with the prudential\nregulations, such as, capital adequacy, credit exposure, norms relating to income\nrecognition, asset classification and provisioning, etc.\n5. PAYMENT OF INVOKE D GUARANTEES\n5.1 Where guarantees are invoked, payment should be made to the beneficiaries without\ndelay and demur. An appropriate procedure for ensuring such immediate honouring of\nguarantees should be laid down so that there is no delay on the pretext that legal\nadvice or approval of higher authorities is being obtained.\n5.2 Delays on the part of banks in honouring the guarantees when invoked tend to erode\nthe value of the bank guarantees, the sanctity of the scheme of guarantees and image\nof banks. It also provides an opportunity to the parties to take recourse to courts and\nobtain injunction orders.  In the case of guarantees in favour of Government\ndepartments, this not only delays the revenue collection efforts but also give an\nerroneous impression that banks are actively in collusion with the parties, which\ntarnish the image of the banking system.16\nThere should be an effective system to process the guarantee business to ensure that\nthe persons on whose behalf the guarantees are issued will be in a position to perform\ntheir obligations in the case of performance guarantees  and honour their commitments\nout of their own resources as and when needed in the case of financial guarantees .\n5.3 The top management of the banks should bestow their personal attention to the need\nto put in place a proper mechanism for making payments in respect of invoked\nguarantees promptly so that no room is given for such complaints. When complaints\nare made, particularly by the Government departments for not honouring the\nguarantees issued, the top management of the bank, including its Chief Executive\nOfficer, should personally look into such complaints.\nIn this regard, the Delhi High Court has made adverse remarks against certain banks\nin not promptly honouring the commitment of guarantees when invoked. It has been\nobserved that a bank guarantee is a contract between the beneficiary and the bank.\nWhen the beneficiary invokes the bank guarantee and a letter invoking the same is\nsent in terms of the bank guarantee, it is obligatory on the bank to make payment to\nthe beneficiary.\n5.4 The Supreme Court had observed [ U.P. Co-operative Federation Private Ltd. versus\nSingh Consultants and Engineers Private Ltd. (1988 IC SSC 174)] that the\ncommitments of the banks must be honoured free from interference by the courts.\nThe relevant extract from the judgement of the Supreme Court in a case is as under: -\n\u201cWe are, therefore, of the opinion that the correct position of law is that commitment\nof banks must be honoured free from interference by the courts and it is only in\nexceptional cases, that is, to say, in case of fraud or any case where irretrievable\ninjustice would be done if bank guarantee is allowed to be encashed  the court should\ninterfere\u201d.\n5.5 In order to avoid such situations, it is absolutely essential for banks to appraise the\nproposals for guarantees also with the same diligence as in the case of fund based\nlimits and obtain adequate cover by way of margin so as to prevent the constituents to\ndevelop a tendency of defaulting in payments when invoked guarantees are honoured\nby the banks.\n5.6 In the interest of the smooth working of the Bank Guarantee Scheme , it is essential to\nensure that there is no discontentment on the part of the Government departments\nregarding its working. Banks are required to ensure that the guarantees issued by them\nare honoured without delay and hesitation when they are invoked by the Government\ndepartments in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee deed, unless\nthere is a Court order restraining the banks.\nAny decision not to honour the obligation under the guarantee invoked may be taken\nafter careful consideration at a fairly senior level and only in the circumstances where\nthe bank is satisfied that any such payment to the beneficiary would not be deemed a17\nrightful payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee under\nthe Indian Contract Act.\nThe Chief Executive Officers of banks should assume personal responsibility for such\ncomplaints received from Government departments. Sufficient powers should be\ndelegated to the line functionaries so that delay on account of reference to higher\nauthorities for payment under the guarantee does not occur.\nBanks should also introduce an appropriate procedure for ensuring immediate\nhonouring of guarantees so that there is no delay on the pretext that legal advice or\napproval of higher authorities is being obtained.\nFor any non-payment of guarantee in time, staff accountability should be fixed and\nstern disciplinary action including award of major penalty such as dismissal, should\nbe taken against the delinquent officials at all levels.\nWhere banks have executed bank guarantees in favour of Customs and Central Excise\nauthorities to cover differential duty amounts in connection with interim orders issued\nby High Courts, the guarantee amount should be released immediately when they are\ninvoked on vacation of the stay orders by Courts. Banks should not hold back the\namount on the pretext that it would affect their liquidity position.\n5.7 There have also been complaints by Ministry of Finance that some of the departments\nsuch as Department of Revenue, Government of India are finding it difficult to\nexecute judgements delivered by various Courts in their favour as banks do not\nhonour their guarantees, unless certified copies of the Court judgements are made\navailable to them. In this regard, the banks may follow the following procedure:\nWhere the bank is a party to the proceedings initiated by Government for enforcement\nof the bank guarantee and the case is decided in favour of the Government by the\nCourt, banks should not insist on production of certified copy of the judgement as the\njudgement/order is pronounced in open Court in presence of the parties/their counsels\nand the judgement is known to the bank.\nIn case the bank is not a party to the proceedings, a signed copy of the minutes of the\norder certified by the Registrar/Deputy or Assistant Registrar of the High Court or the\nordinary copy of the judgement/order of the High Court duly attested to be true copy\nby Government Counsel should be sufficient for honouring the obligation under\nguarantee, unless the guarantor bank decides to file any appeal against the order of the\nHigh Court.\nBanks should honour the guarantees issued by them as and  when they are invoked in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee deeds. In case of any\ndisputes such honouring can be done under protest, if necessary, and the matters of\ndispute pursued separately.\nThe Government, on their part, have advised the various Government departments,\netc. that the invocation of guarantees should be done after careful consideration at a\nsenior-level that a default has occurred in accordance with the terms and conditions of\nthe guarantees and as provided in the guarantee deed.\nNon-compliance of the instructions in regard to honouring commitments under\ninvoked guarantees will be viewed by Reserve Bank very seriously and Reserve Bank\nwill be constrained to take deterrent action against the banks.18\n6. CO-ACCEPTANCE  OF BILLS\n6.1 General\nReserve Bank has observed that some banks co-accept bills of their customers and\nalso discount bills co-accepted by other banks in a casual manner. These bills\nsubsequently turn out to be accommodation bills drawn by groups of sister concerns\non each other where no genuine trade transaction takes place. Banks, while\ndiscounting such bills, appear to ignore this important aspect presumably because of\nthe co-acceptance  given by other banks. The bills on maturity  are not honoured by the\ndrawees and the banks which co-accept the bills have to make payment of these bills\nand they find it difficult to recover the amount from the drawers/ drawees of bills. The\nbanks also discount bills for sizeable amounts which are co-accepted by certain Urban\nCo-operative Banks. On maturity, the bills are not honoured and the co-operative\nbanks, which co-accept the bills, also find it difficult to make the payment. The\nfinancial position and capacity of the co-accepting bank to honour the bills, in the\nevent of need, is not being gone into .\nCases have also been observed where the particulars regarding co-acceptance  of bills\nare not recorded in the bank's books with the result the extent thereof cannot be\nverified during inspections and the Head Office becomes aware of the co-acceptance\nonly when a claim is received from the discounting bank.\n6.2 Safeguards\nBanks should keep in view the following safeguards:\nWhile sanctioning co-acceptance  limits to their customers, the need therefor should be\nascertained and such limits should be extended only to those customers who enjoyed\nother limits with the bank.\nOnly genuine trade bills should be co-accepted and the banks should ensure that the\ngoods covered by bills co-accepted are actually received in the stock accounts of the\nborrowers.\nThe valuation of the goods as mentioned in the accompanying invoice should be\nverified to see that there is no over-valuation of stocks.\nThe banks should not extend their co-acceptance  to house bills/accommodation bills\ndrawn by group concerns on one another.\nThe banks discounting such bills co-accepted by other banks should also ensure that\nthe bills are not accommodation bills and that the co-accepting bank has the capacity\nto redeem the obligation in case of need.\nBank-wise limits should be fixed, taking into consideration the size of each bank for\ndiscounting bills co-accepted by other banks and the relative powers of the officials of\nthe other banks should be got registered with the discounting banks.\nCare should be taken to see that the co-acceptance  liability of any bank is not\ndisproportionate to its known resources position.19\nA system of obtaining periodical confirmation of the liability of co-accepting banks in\nregard to the outstanding bills should be introduced.\nProper records of the bills co-accepted for each customer should be maintained so that\nthe commitments for each customer and the total commitments at a branch can be\nreadily ascertained and these should be scrutinised by Internal Inspectors and\ncommented upon in their reports.\nIt is also desirable for the discounting bank to advise the Head Office/Controlling\nOffice of the bank, which has co-accepted the bills, whenever such transactions\nappear to be disproportionate or large.\nProper periodical returns may be prescribed so that the Branch Managers report such\nco-acceptance  commitments entered into by them to the Controlling Offices. Such\nreturns should also reveal the position of bills that have become overdue and which\nthe bank had to meet under the co-acceptance obligation. This will enable the\nControlling Offices to monitor such co-acceptances furnished by the branches and\ntake suitable action in time, in difficult cases.\nCo-acceptances in respect of bills for Rs. 10,000/- and above should be signed by two\nofficials jointly, deviation being allowed only in exceptional cases, e.g. non-\navailability of two officials at a branch.\nBefore discounting/purchasing bills co-accepted by other banks for Rs. 2 lakh and\nabove from a single party the bank should obtain written confirmation of the\nconcerned Controlling (Regional/ Divisional/ Zonal) Office of the accepting bank and\na record of the same should be kept.\nWhen the value of total bills discounted/purchased (which have been co-accepted by\nother banks) exceed Rs. 20 lakh for a single borrower/group of borrowers, prior\napproval of the Head Office of the co-accepting bank must be obtained by the\ndiscounting bank in writing.\n6.3 In addition to the above safeguards to be observed by banks in co-accepting the bills,\nit must be noted that the banks are precluded from co-accepting bills drawn under\nBuyers Line of Credit Schemes introduced by the financial institutions like IDBI,\nSIDBI, Power Finance Corporation Ltd. ( PFC), etc. Similarly, banks should not co-\naccept bills drawn by NBFCs .\nIn addition, banks are advised not to extend co-acceptance  on behalf of their\nbuyers/constituents under the SIDBI Scheme.\n6.4 However, banks may co-accept b ills drawn under the Sellers Line of Credit Schemes\nfor Bill Discounting operated by the financial institutions like IDBI , SIDBI , PFC, etc.\nwithout any limit, subject to buyer\u2019s capability to pay and the compliance with the\nexposure norms prescribed by the bank for individual/ group borrowers.\n6.5 There have been instances where branches of banks open L/Cs on behalf of their\nconstituents and also co-accept the bills drawn under such L/Cs. Legally, if a bank co-\naccepts a bill drawn under its own L/C, the bill so co-accepted becomes an\nindependent document and the special rules applicable to commercial credits do not\napply to such bill and the bill is exclusively governed by the law relating to Bills of20\nExchange i.e. Negotiable Instruments Act. The negotiating bank of such a bill is not\nunder any obligation to check the particulars of the bill with reference to the terms of\nthe L/C. This practice is, therefore, superfluous and defeats the purpose of issuing\nL/C. The discounting banks should first ascertain from co-accepting banks, the reason\nfor such co-acceptance  of bills drawn under its own L/C and only after satisfying\nthemselves of genuineness of such transaction, they may consider discounting such\nbills.\n6.6 It should be ensured that t he branch officials strictly adhere to the above referred\ninstructions at the time of co-acceptance  of bills. It would be advisable to determine\nclear accountability in this respect and officials found to be not complying with the\ninstructions must be dealt with sternly.\nAnnexure 1\nMaster Circular\nGUARANTEES & CO-ACCEPTANCES\nTypes of unsecured advances  to be excluded from the total\nof unsecured advances for the purpose of norms relating to\nunsecured advances and guarantees\n[Vide paragraph 2.3]\n1.

Writing-Off Of Npas\nPrudential Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning\npertaining to Advances\n1. GENERAL\n1.1  In line with the international practices and as per the recommendations made by the\nCommittee on the Financial System (Chairman Shri M. Narasimham), the Reserve Bank of\nIndia has introduced, in a phased manner, prudential norms for income recognition, asset\nclassification and provisioning for the advances portfolio of the banks so as to move towards\ngreater consistency and transparency in the published accounts.\n1.2  The policy of income recognition should be objective and based on record of recovery\nrather than on any subjective considerations. Likewise, the classification of assets of banks\nhas to be done on the basis of objective criteria which would ensure a uniform and consistent\napplication of the norms. Also, the provisioning should be made on the basis of the\nclassification of assets based on the period for which the asset has remained non-performing\nand the availability  of  security and the realisable value thereof.\n1.3  With the introduction of prudential norms, the Health Code-based system for\nclassification of advances has ceased to be a subject of supervisory interest. As such, all\nrelated reporting requirements, etc. under the Health Code system also cease to be a\nsupervisory requirement. Banks may, however, continue the system at their discretion as a\nmanagement information tool.\n2. DEFINITIONS\n2.1 Non-performing assets\n2.1.1 An asset, including a leased asset, becomes non-performing when it ceases to generate\nincome for the bank.  A \u2018non-performing asset\u2019 ( NPA) was defined as a credit facility in\nrespect of which the interest and/ or instalment of principal has remained \u2018past due\u2019 for a\nspecified period of time.  The specified period was reduced in a phased manner as under:\nYear ending March 31 Specified period\n1993 four quarters\n1994 three quarters\n1995 onwards two quarters\n2.1.2 An amount due under any credit facility is treated as \u201cpast due\u201d when it has not been\npaid within 30 days from the due date. Due to the improvements in the payment and\nsettlement systems, recovery climate, upgradation of technology in the banking system, etc.,RBI_MC_IRAC_20032\nit was decided to dispense with \u2018past due\u2019 concept, with effect from March 31, 2001.\nAccordingly, as from that date, a Non-performing Asset ( NPA) shall be an advance where\ni) interest and/or instalment of principal remain overdue for a period of more than\n180 days in respect of a Term Loan,\nii) the account remains \u2018out of order\u2019 as indicated at paragraph 2.2 below, in respect\nof an Overdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC),\niii) the bill remains overdue for a period of more than 180 days in the case of bills\npurchased and discounted,\niv) interest and/or instalment of principal remains overdue for two harvest seasons but\nfor a period not exceeding two half years in the case of an advance granted for\nagricultural purposes, and\nv) any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than 180 days in\nrespect of other accounts.\n2.1.3 With a view to moving towards international best practices and to ensure greater\ntransparency, it has been decided to adopt the \u201890 days\u2019 overdue\u2019 norm for identification of\nNPAs, from the year ending March 31, 2004.  Accordingly, with effect from March 31, 2004,\na non-performing asset ( NPA) shall be a loan or an advance where;\ni) interest and/ or instalment of principal remain overdue for a period of more than\n90 days in respect of a term loan,\nii) the account remains \u2018out of order\u2019 as indicated at paragraph 2.2 below, in respect\nof an Overdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC),\niii) the bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bills\npurchased and discounted,\niv) interest and/or instalment of principal remains overdue for two harvest seasons but\nfor a period not exceeding two half years in the case of an advance granted for\nagricultural purposes, and\nv) any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in\nrespect of other accounts.\nAs a facilitating measure for smooth transition to 90 days norm, banks have been advised to\nmove over to charging of interest at monthly rests, by April 1, 2002.  However, the date of\nclassification of an advance as NPA   should not be changed on  account of charging of\ninterest at  monthly rests.  Banks should ,  therefore, continue to classify an  account as NPA\nonly  if the interest  charged  during any quarter is not serviced fully within 180 days from the\nend of the quarter with effect from April 1, 2002 and 90 days from the end of the quarter with\neffect from March 31,  2004.\n2.2 'Out of Order' statusRBI_MC_IRAC_20033\nAn account should be treated as 'out of order'  if the outstanding balance remains\ncontinuously in excess of the sanctioned limit/drawing power. In cases where the outstanding\nbalance in the principal operating account is less than the sanctioned limit/drawing power, but\nthere are no credits continuously for 180 days (to be reduced to 90 days, with effect from\nMarch 31, 2004) as on the date of Balance Sheet or credits are not enough to cover the\ninterest debited during the same period, these accounts should be treated as 'out of order' .\n2.3 \u2018Overdue\u2019\nAny amount due to the bank under any credit facility is \u2018overdue\u2019 if it is not paid on the due\ndate fixed by the bank.\n3. INCOME RECOGNITION\n3.1 Income recognition - Policy\n3.1.1  The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of\nrecovery. Internationally income from non-performing assets ( NPA) is not recognised on\naccrual basis but is booked as income only when it is actually received. Therefore, the banks\nshould not charge and take to income account interest on any NPA.\n3.1.2  However, interest on advances against term deposits, NSCs, IVPs, KVPs and Life\npolicies may be taken to income account on the due date, provided adequate margin is\navailable in the accounts.\n3.1.3  Fees and commissions earned by the banks as a result of re-negotiations or\nrescheduling of outstanding debts should be recognised on an accrual basis over the period of\ntime covered by the re-negotiated or rescheduled extension of credit.\n3.1.4  If Government guaranteed advances become NPA, the interest on such advances\nshould not be taken to income account unless the interest has been realised.\n3.2  Reversal of income\n3.2.1 If any advance, including bills purchased and discounted, becomes NPA as at the\nclose of any year, interest accrued and credited to income account in the corresponding\nprevious year, should be reversed or provided for if the same is not realised. This will apply\nto Government guaranteed accounts also .\n3.2.2 In respect of NPAs, fees, commission and similar income that have accrued should\ncease to accrue in the current period and should be reversed or provided for with respect to\npast periods, if uncollected.\n3.2.3 Leased Assets\ni) The net lease rentals (finance charge) on the leased asset accrued and credited to\nincome account before the asset became non-performing, and remaining\nunrealised, should be reversed or provided for in the current accounting period.RBI_MC_IRAC_20034\nii) The term 'net lease rentals' would mean the amount of finance charge taken to the\ncredit of Profit & Loss Account and would be worked out as gross lease rentals\nadjusted by amount of statutory depreciation and lease equalisation account.\niii) As per the 'Guidance Note on Accounting for Leases'  issued by the Council of\nthe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ( ICAI), a separate Lease\nEqualisation Account should be opened by the banks with a corresponding debit\nor credit to Lease Adjustment Account, as the case may be. Further, Lease\nEqualisation Account should be transferred every year to the Profit & Loss\nAccount and disclosed separately as a deduction from/addition to gross value of\nlease rentals shown under the head 'Gross Income'.\n3.3 Appropriation of recovery in NPAs\n3.3.1 Interest realised on NPAs may be taken to income account provided the credits in the\naccounts towards interest are not out of fresh/ additional credit facilities sanctioned to the\nborrower concerned.\n3.3.2 In the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the borrower for the\npurpose of appropriation of recoveries in NPAs (i.e. towards principal or interest due), banks\nshould adopt an accounting principle and exercise the right of appropriation of recoveries in a\nuniform  and consistent  manner.\n3.4 Interest Application\nThere is no objection to the banks using their own discretion in debiting interest to an NPA\naccount taking the same to Interest Suspense Account or maintaining only a record of such\ninterest in proforma accounts.\n3.5 Reporting of NPAs\n3.5.1   Banks are required to furnish a Report on NPAs as on 31st March each year after\ncompletion of audit. The NPAs would relate to the banks\u2019 global portfolio, including the\nadvances at the foreign branches. The Report should be furnished as per the prescribed\nformat given in the Annexure I.\n3.5.2  While reporting NPA figures to RBI, the amount held in interest suspense account,\nshould be shown as a deduction from gross NPAs as well as gross advances while arriving at\nthe net NPAs.  Banks which do not maintain Interest Suspense account for parking interest\ndue on non-performing advance accounts, may furnish the amount of interest receivable on\nNPAs as a foot note to the Report.\n3.5.3   Whenever NPAs are reported to RBI, the amount of technical write off, if any, should\nbe reduced from the outstanding gross advances and gross NPAs to eliminate any distortion\nin the quantum of NPAs being reported.\n4.ASSET CLASSIFICATION\n4.1 Categories of NPAsRBI_MC_IRAC_20035\nBanks are required to classify non-performing assets further into the following three\ncategories based on the period for which the asset has remained non-performing and the\nrealisability of the dues:\na) Sub-standard Assets\nb) Doubtful Assets\nc) Loss Assets\n4.1.1 Sub-standard Assets\nA sub-standard asset was one, which was classified as NPA for a period not exceeding two\nyears. With effect from 31 March 2001, a sub-standard asset is one, which has remained NPA\nfor a period less than or equal to 18 months . In such cases, the current net worth of the\nborrower/ guarantor or the current market value of the security charged is not enough to\nensure recovery of the dues to the banks in full. In other words, such an asset will have well\ndefined credit weaknesses that jeopardise the liquidation of the debt and are characterised by\nthe distinct possibility that the banks will sustain some loss, if deficiencies are not corrected .\nWith effect from 31 March 2005, a sub-standard asset would be one, which has remained\nNPA for a period less than or equal to 12 months.\n4.1.2 Doubtful Assets\nA doubtful asset was one, which remained NPA for a period exceeding two years. With effect\nfrom 31 March 2001, an asset is to be classified as doubtful, if it has remained NPA for a\nperiod exceeding 18 months . A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in\nassets that were classified as sub-standard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses\nmake collection or liquidation in full, \u2013 on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and\nvalues \u2013 highly questionable and improbable.\nWith effect from  March 31, 2005, an asset would be classified as doubtful if it remained in\nthe sub-standard category for 12 months.\n4.1.3 Loss As sets\nA loss asset is one where loss has been identified by the bank or internal or external auditors\nor the RBI inspection but the amount has not been written off wholly.  In other words, such\nan asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable\nasset is not warranted although there may be some salvage or recovery value.\n4.2 Guidelines for classification of assets\n4.2.1 Broadly speaking, classification of assets into above categories should be done taking\ninto account the degree of well-defined credit weaknesses and the extent of dependence on\ncollateral security for realisation of dues.\n4.2.2 Banks should establish appropriate internal systems to eliminate the tendency to delay\nor postpone the identification of NPAs, especially in respect of high value accounts.  The\nbanks may fix a minimum cut off point to decide what would constitute a high value accountRBI_MC_IRAC_20036\ndepending upon their respective  business levels. The cut off point should be valid for the\nentire accounting year. Responsibility and validation levels for ensuring proper asset\nclassification may be fixed by the banks.  The system should ensure that doubts in asset\nclassification due to any reason are settled through specified internal channels within one\nmonth from the date on which the account would have been classified as NPA as per extant\nguidelines.\n4.2.3 Accounts with temporary deficiencies\nThe classification of an asset as NPA should be based on the record of recovery. Bank should\nnot classify an advance account as NPA merely due to the existence of some deficiencies\nwhich are temporary in nature such as non-availability of adequate drawing power based on\nthe latest available stock statement, balance outstanding exceeding the limit temporarily, non-\nsubmission of stock statements and  non-renewal of the limits on the due date, etc. In the\nmatter of classification of accounts with such deficiencies banks may follow the following\nguidelines:\na) Banks should ensure that drawings in the working capital accounts are covered by\nthe adequacy of current assets, since current assets are first appropriated in times\nof distress. Drawing power is required to be arrived at based on the stock\nstatement which is current.  However, considering the difficulties of large\nborrowers, stock statements relied upon by the banks for determining drawing\npower should not be older than three months.   The outstanding in the account\nbased on drawing power calculated from stock statements older than three  months,\nwould be deemed as irregular.  A working capital borrowal account will become\nNPA if such irregular drawings are permitted in the account for a continuous\nperiod of 180 days even though the unit may be working or the borrower's\nfinancial position is satisfactory.\nWith effect from March 31, 2004, a working capital borrowal account will\nbecome NPA if such irregular drawings are permitted in the account for a\ncontinuous period of 90 days even though the unit may be working or the\nborrower's financial position is satisfactory.\nb) Regular and ad hoc credit limits need to be reviewed/ regularised not later than\nthree months from the due date/date of ad hoc sanction.  In case of constraints\nsuch as non-availability of  financial statements and other data from the\nborrowers, the branch should furnish evidence to show that renewal/ review of\ncredit limits is already on and  would be completed soon. In any case, delay\nbeyond six months is not considered desirable as a general discipline. Hence, an\naccount where the regular/ ad hoc credit limits have not been reviewed/ renewed\nwithin 180 days from the due date/ date of ad hoc sanction will  be treated as\nNPA.\n4.2.4  Upgradation of loan accounts classified as NPAs\nIf arrears of interest and principal are paid by the borrower in the case of loan accounts\nclassified as NPAs, the account should no longer be treated as non-performing and may be\nclassified as \u2018standard\u2019 accounts.RBI_MC_IRAC_20037\n4.2.5 Accounts regularised near about the balance sheet date\nThe asset classification of borrowal accounts where a solitary or a few credits are recorded\nbefore the balance sheet date should be handled with care and without scope for subjectivity.\nWhere the account indicates inherent weakness on the basis of the data available, the account\nshould be deemed as a NPA.  In other genuine cases, the banks must furnish satisfactory\nevidence to the Statutory Auditors/Inspecting Officers about the manner of regularisation of\nthe account to eliminate doubts on their performing status.\n4.2.6 Asset Classification to be borrower-wise and not facility-wise\ni) It is difficult to envisage a situation when only one facility to a borrower becomes\na problem credit and not others. Therefore, all the facilities granted by a bank to a\nborrower will have to be treated as NPA and not the particular facility or part\nthereof which has become irregular.\nii) If the debits arising out of devolvement  of letters of credit or invoked guarantees\nare parked in a separate account, the balance outstanding in that account also\nshould be treated as a part of the borrower\u2019s principal operating account for the\npurpose of application of prudential norms on income recognition, asset\nclassification and provisioning.\n4.2.7 Advances under consortium arrangements\nAsset classification of accounts under consortium should be based on the record of recovery\nof the individual member banks  and other aspects having a bearing on the recoverability of\nthe advances . Where the remittances by the borrower under consortium lending arrangements\nare pooled with one bank and/or where the bank receiving remittances is not parting  with the\nshare of other member banks, the account will be treated as not serviced in the books of the\nother member banks and therefore,  be treated as NPA. The banks participating in the\nconsortium should, therefore, arrange to get their share of recovery transferred from the lead\nbank or get an express consent from the lead bank for the transfer of their share of recovery,\nto ensure proper asset classification in their respective books.\n4.2.8 Accounts where ther e is erosion in the value of security\ni) A NPA need not go through the various stages of classification in cases of serious\ncredit impairment and such assets should be straightaway classified as doubtful or\nloss asset as appropriate. Erosion in the value of security can be reckoned as\nsignificant when the realisable value of the security is less than 50 per cent of the\nvalue assessed by the bank or accepted by RBI at the  time of last inspection, as\nthe case may be. Such NPAs may be straightaway classified  under doubtful\ncategory  and provisioning should be made as applicable to doubtful assets.\nii) If the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank/ approved valuers/\nRBI is less than 10 per cent of the outstanding in the borrowal accounts, the\nexistence of security  should be ignored and the asset should be straightaway\nclassified as loss asset. It may be either written off or fully provided for by the\nbank.RBI_MC_IRAC_20038\n4.2.9 Advances to PACS/ FSS ceded to Commercial Banks\nIn respect of agricultural advances as well as advances for other purposes granted by banks to\nceded PACS / FSS under the on-lending system, only that particular credit facility granted to\nPACS / FSS which is in default for a period of two harvest seasons (not exceeding two half\nyears)/two quarters, as the case may be, after it has become due will be classified as NPA  and\nnot all the credit facilities sanctioned to a PACS / FSS. The other direct loans & advances, if\nany, granted by the bank to the member borrower of a PACS/ FSS outside the on-lending\narrangement will become NPA even if one of the credit facilities granted to the same\nborrower becomes NPA.\n4.2.10 Advances against Term Deposits, NSCs, KVP/ IVP, etc\nAdvances against term deposits, NSCs eligible for surrender, IVPs, KVPs and life policies\nneed not be treated as NPAs. Advances against gold ornaments, government securities and all\nother securities are not covered by this exemption.\n4.2.11 Loans with moratorium for payment of interest\ni) In the case of bank finance given for industrial projects or for agricultural\nplantations etc. where moratorium is available for payment of interest, payment of\ninterest becomes 'due' only after the moratorium or gestation period is over.\nTherefore, such amounts of interest do not become overdue and hence NPA, with\nreference to the date of debit of interest. They become overdue after due date for\npayment of interest, if uncollected.\nii) In the case of housing loan or similar advances granted to staff members where\ninterest is payable after recovery of principal, interest need not be considered as\noverdue from the first quarter onwards. Such loans/advances should be classified\nas NPA only when there is a default in repayment of instalment of principal or\npayment of interest on the respective due dates\n4.2.12  Agricultural advances\ni) i) In respect of advances granted for agricultural purpose where interest and/or\ninstalment of principal remains unpaid after it has become past due for two\nharvest seasons but for a period not exceeding two half-years, such an advance\nshould be treated as NPA. The above norms should be made applicable to all\ndirect agricultural advances as listed at items 1.1, 1.1.2 ( i) to (vii), 1.1.2\n(viii)(a)(1) and 1.1.2 (viii)(b)(1) and 1.1.2 (viii)(b)(8) of Master Circular on\nlending to priority sector No. RPCD . PLAN. BC. 42A   /04.09.01/ 2002- 2003\ndated 11 November 2002. An extract of the list of these items is furnished in the\nAnnexure II. In respect of agricultural loans, other than those specified above,\nidentification of NPAs would be done on the same basis as non agricultural\nadvances which, at present, is the 180 days delinquency norm. The delinquency\nnorm would become 90 days with effect from March 31, 2004.\nii) Where natural calamities impair the repaying capacity of agricultural borrowers,\nbanks may decide on their own as a relief measure - conversion of the short-term\nproduction loan into a term loan or re- schedulement  of the repayment period; andRBI_MC_IRAC_20039\nthe sanctioning of fresh short-term loan, subject to various guidelines contained in\nRBI circulars RPCD . No.PLFS.BC.128/ 05.04.02/ 97-98 dated 20.06.98 and\nRPCD.No.PLFS.BC.9/ 05.01.04/ 98-99 dated 21.07.98.\niii) In such cases of conversion or re- schedulement, the term loan as well as fresh\nshort-term loan may be treated as current dues and need not be classified as NPA.\nThe asset classification of these loans would thereafter be governed by the revised\nterms & conditions and would be treated as NPA if interest and/or instalment of\nprincipal remains unpaid, for two harvest seasons but for a period not exceeding\ntwo half years.\niv) In case of Kharif crop loans in the districts affected by failure of the South-West\nmonsoon as notified by the State Government, recovery of any amount either by\nway of principal or interest during the financial year 2002-03 need not be effected.\nFurther, the principal amount of crop loans in such cases should be converted into\nterm loans and will be recovered over a period of minimum 5 years in case of\nsmall and marginal farmers and 4 years in case of other farmers. Interest due in\nthe  financial year 2002-03 on crop loans should also be deferred and no interest\nshould be charged on the deferred interest. In such cases of conversion or\nreschedulement of crop loans into term loans, the term loans may be treated as\ncurrent dues and need not be classified as NPA. The asset classification of these\nloans would thereafter be governed by the revised terms and conditions and would\nbe treated as NPA if interest and / or instalment of principal remain unpaid for two\nharvest seasons, not exceeding two half years.\n4.2.13   Government guaranteed advances\nThe credit facilities backed by guarantee of the Central Government though overdue may be\ntreated as NPA only when the Government repudiates its guarantee when invoked. This\nexemption from classification of Government guaranteed advances as NPA is not for the\npurpose of recognition of income. With effect from 1st April 2000, advances sanctioned\nagainst State Government guarantees should be classified as NPA in the normal course, if the\nguarantee is invoked and remains in default for more than two quarters. With effect from\nMarch 31, 2001 the period of default is revised as more than 180 days, and with effect from\nMarch 31, 2004 the period of default would be revised as more than 90 days.\n4.2.14   Restructuring/ Rescheduling of Loans\ni) A standard asset where the terms of the loan agreement regarding interest and\nprincipal have been renegotiated or rescheduled after commencement of production should be\nclassified as sub-standard and should remain in such category for at least one year of\nsatisfactory performance under the renegotiated or rescheduled terms.  In the case of sub-\nstandard and doubtful assets also, rescheduling does not entitle a bank to upgrade the quality\nof advance automatically unless there is satisfactory performance under the rescheduled /\nrenegotiated terms. Following representations from banks that the foregoing stipulations deter\nthe banks from restructuring of standard and sub-standard loan assets even though the\nmodification of terms might not jeopardise the assurance of repayment of dues from the\nborrower, the norms relating to restructuring of standard and sub-standard assets   were\nreviewed in March 2001. In the context of restructuring of the accounts, the following stagesRBI_MC_IRAC_200310\nat which the restructuring / rescheduling / renegotiation of the terms of loan agreement could\ntake place, can be identified:\na) before commencement of commercial production;\nb) after commencement of commercial production but before the asset has been\nclassified as sub standard,\nc) after commencement of commercial production and after the asset has been\nclassified as sub standard.\nIn each of the foregoing three stages, the rescheduling, etc., of principal and/or of interest\ncould take place, with or without sacrifice, as part of the restructuring package evolved.\nii) Treatment of Restructured Standard Accounts\na) A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, at any of the aforesaid first\ntwo stages would not cause a standard asset to be classified in the sub standard\ncategory provided the loan/credit facility is fully secured.\nb) A rescheduling of interest element at any of the foregoing first two stages would\nnot cause an asset to be downgraded to sub standard category subject to the\ncondition that the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the element of interest, measured in\npresent value terms, is either written off or provision is made to the extent of the\nsacrifice involved.  For the purpose, the future interest due as per the original loan\nagreement in respect of an account should be discounted to the present value at a\nrate appropriate to the risk category of the borrower (i.e., current PLR+  the\nappropriate credit risk premium for the borrower-category) and compared with the\npresent value of the dues expected to be received under the restructuring package,\ndiscounted on the same basis.\nc) In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value terms,\nas at  (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or provision\nmade to the extent of the sacrifice involved.\niii) Treatment of restructured sub-standard accounts\na) A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, would render a sub-standard\nasset eligible to be continued in the sub-standard category for the specified period,\nprovided the loan/credit facility is fully secured.\nb) A rescheduling of interest element would render a sub-standard asset eligible to be\ncontinued to be classified in sub standard category for the specified period subject\nto the condition that the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the element of interest,\nmeasured in present value terms, is either written off or provision is made to the\nextent of the sacrifice involved. For the purpose, the future interest due as per the\noriginal loan agreement in respect of an account should be discounted to the present\nvalue at a rate appropriate to the risk category of the borrower (i.e., current PLR +\nthe appropriate credit risk premium for the borrower-category) and compared with\nthe present value of the dues expected to be received under the restructuring\npackage, discounted on the same basis.\nc) In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value terms,\nas at (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or provision\nmade to the extent of the sacrifice involved. Even in cases where the sacrifice is byRBI_MC_IRAC_200311\nway of write off of the past interest dues, the asset should continue to be treated as\nsub-standard.\n(iv) Upgradation of restructured accounts\nThe sub-standard accounts which have been subjected to restructuring etc., whether in respect\nof principal instalment or interest amount, by whatever modality, would be eligible to be\nupgraded to the standard category only after the specified period i.e., a period of one year\nafter the date when first payment of interest or of principal, whichever is earlier, falls due,\nsubject to satisfactory performance during the period. The amount of provision made earlier,\nnet of the amount provided for the sacrifice in the interest amount in present value terms as\naforesaid, could also be reversed after the one year period. During this one year period, the\nsub-standard asset will not deteriorate in its classification if satisfactory performance of the\naccount is demonstrated during the period. In case, however, the satisfactory performance\nduring the one year period is not evidenced, the asset classification of the restructured\naccount would be governed as per the applicable prudential norms with reference to the pre-\nrestructuring payment schedule.\n(v) General\n(a) These instructions would be applicable to all type of credit facilities including\nworking capital limits, extended to industrial units, provided they are fully covered\nby tangible securities.\n(b) As trading involves only buying  and selling of commodities  and  the problems\nassociated with manufacturing units such as bottleneck in commercial production,\ntime and cost escalation etc. are not applicable to them, these guidelines should not\nbe applied to restructuring/ rescheduling of credit facilities extended to traders.\n(c) While assessing the extent  of security cover available to the credit facilities, which\nare being restructured/ rescheduled,  collateral security would also be reckoned,\nprovided such collateral is a tangible security properly charged to the bank  and is\nnot in the intangible form like  guarantee etc. of the promoter/ others.\n4.2.15  Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR System)\nA. Background\ni) Inspite of their best efforts and intentions, sometimes corporates find themselves in\nfinancial difficulty because of factors beyond their control and also due to certain\ninternal reasons. For the revival of the corporates  as well as for the safety of the\nmoney lent by the banks and FIs, timely support through restructuring in genuine\ncases is called for. However, delay in agreement amongst different lending\ninstitutions often comes in the way of such endeavours.\nii) Based on the experience in other countries like the U.K., Thailand, Korea, etc. of\nputting in place institutional mechanism for restructuring of corporate debt and need\nfor a similar mechanism in India, a Corporate Debt Restructuring System was\nevolved, and detailed guidelines were issued vide circular DBOD No. BP.BC.\n15/21.04.114/2000-01 dated August 23, 2001 for implementation by banks.  Based onRBI_MC_IRAC_200312\nthe recommendations made by the Working Group to make the operations of the CDR\nmechanism more efficient (Chairman: Shri Vepa  Kamesam , Deputy Governor, RBI),\nwhich was constituted pursuant to the announcement made by the Finance Minister in\nthe Union Budget 2002-2003, and consultations with the Government, the guidelines\nof Corporate Debt Restructuring system have since been revised and detailed\nhereunder for implementation by banks/ FIs. The revised guidelines are in\nsupersession of the guidelines outlined in the aforesaid circular dated August 23,\n2001.\niii) One of the main features of the revised guidelines is the provision of two categories of\ndebt restructuring under the CDR system. Accounts, which are classified as \u2018standard\u2019\nand \u2018sub-standard\u2019 in the books of the lenders, will be restructured under the first\ncategory (Category 1). Accounts which are classified as \u2018doubtful\u2019 in the books of the\nlenders would be restructured under the second category (Category 2).\nThe main features of the CDR system are given below:\nB. Objective\nThe objective of the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) framework is to ensure timely and\ntransparent mechanism for restructuring the corporate debts of viable entities facing\nproblems, outside the purview of BIFR, DRT and other legal proceedings, for the benefit of\nall concerned. In particular, the framework will aim at preserving viable corporates that are\naffected by certain internal and external factors and minimize the losses to the creditors and\nother stakeholders through an orderly and coordinated restructuring programme.\nC. Structure\nCDR system in the country will have a three tier structure:\n\u2022 CDR Standing Forum and its Core Group\n\u2022 CDR Empowered Group\n\u2022 CDR Cell\ni) CDR Standing Forum\na) The CDR Standing Forum would be the representative general body of all\nfinancial institutions and banks participating in CDR system. All financial\ninstitutions and banks should participate in the system in their own interest.\nCDR Standing Forum will be a self- empowered body, which will lay down\npolicies and guidelines, and monitor the progress of corporate debt\nrestructuring.\nb) The Forum will also provide an official platform for both the creditors and\nborrowers (by consultation) to amicably and collectively evolve policies and\nguidelines for working out debt restructuring plans in the interests of all\nconcerned.RBI_MC_IRAC_200313\nc) The CDR Standing Forum shall comprise of Chairman & Managing Director,\nIndustrial Development Bank of India; Chairman, State Bank of India;\nChairman, ICICI  Bank Limited; Chairman, Indian Banks' Association and\nExecutive Director, Reserve Bank of India as well as Chairmen and Managing\nDirectors of all banks and financial institutions participating as permanent\nmembers in the system. Since institutions like Unit Trust of India, General\nInsurance Corporation, Life Insurance Corporation may have assumed\nexposures on certain borrowers , these institutions may participate in the CDR\nsystem. The Forum will elect its Chairman for a period of one year and the\nprinciple of rotation will be followed in the subsequent years. However, the\nForum may decide to have a Working Chairman as a whole-time officer to\nguide and carry out the decisions of the CDR Standing Forum.\nd) The CDR Standing Forum shall meet at least once every six months and\nwould review and monitor the progress of corporate debt restructuring system.\nThe Forum would also lay down the policies and guidelines to be followed by\nthe CDR Empowered Group and CDR Cell for debt restructuring and would\nensure their smooth functioning and adherence to the prescribed time\nschedules for debt restructuring. It can also review any individual decisions of\nthe CDR Empowered Group and CDR Cell. The CDR Standing Forum may\nalso formulate guidelines for dispensing special treatment to those cases which\nare complicated and are likely to be delayed beyond the time frame prescribed\nfor processing.\ne) A CDR Core Group will be carved out of the CDR Standing Forum to assist\nthe Standing Forum in convening the meetings and taking decisions relating to\npolicy, on behalf of the Standing Forum. The Core Group will consist of Chief\nExecutives of IDBI, SBI, ICICI Bank Limited, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India,\nPunjab National Bank, Indian Banks' Association, Deputy Chairman of Indian\nBanks' Association representing foreign banks in India and a representative of\nReserve Bank of India.\nf) The CDR Core Group would lay down the policies and guidelines to be\nfollowed by the CDR Empowered Group and CDR Cell for debt restructuring.\nThese guidelines shall also suitably address the operational difficulties\nexperienced in the functioning of the CDR Empowered Group. The CDR Core\nGroup shall also prescribe the PERT chart for processing of cases referred to\nthe CDR system and decide on the modalities for enforcement of the time\nframe.  The CDR Core Group shall also lay down guidelines to ensure that\nover-optimistic projections are not assumed while preparing / approving\nrestructuring proposals especially with regard to capacity utilization, price of\nproducts, profit margin, demand, availability of raw materials, input-output\nratio and likely impact of imports / international cost competitiveness.\nii) CDR Empowered Group\na) The individual cases of corporate debt restructuring shall be decided by the\nCDR Empowered Group, consisting of ED level representatives of IDBI,RBI_MC_IRAC_200314\nICICI Bank Ltd. and SBI as standing members, in addition to ED level\nrepresentatives of financial institutions and banks who have an exposure to the\nconcerned company. While the standing members will facilitate the conduct of\nthe Group\u2019s meetings, voting will be in proportion to the exposure of the\nlenders only.  In order to make the CDR Empowered Group effective and\nbroad based and operate efficiently and smoothly, it would have to be ensured\nthat participating institutions / banks approve a panel of senior officers to\nrepresent them in the CDR Empowered Group and ensure that they depute\nofficials only from among the panel to attend the meetings of CDR\nEmpowered Group. Further, nominees who attend the meeting pertaining to\none account should invariably attend all the meetings pertaining to that\naccount instead of deputing their representatives.\nb) The level of representation of banks/ financial institutions on the CDR\nEmpowered Group should be at a sufficiently senior level to ensure that\nconcerned bank / FI abides by the necessary commitments including\nsacrifices, made towards debt restructuring. There should be a general\nauthorisation by the respective Boards of the participating institutions / banks\nin favour of their representatives on the CDR Empowered Group, authorising\nthem to take decisions on behalf of their organization, regarding restructuring\nof debts of individual corporates.\nc) The CDR Empowered Group will consider the preliminary report of all cases\nof requests of restructuring, submitted to it by the CDR Cell. After the\nEmpowered Group decides that restructuring of the company is prima-facie\nfeasible and the enterprise is potentially viable in terms of the policies and\nguidelines evolved by Standing Forum, the detailed restructuring package will\nbe worked out by the CDR Cell in conjunction with the Lead Institution.\nHowever, if the lead institution faces difficulties in working out the detailed\nrestructuring package, the participating banks / financial institutions should\ndecide upon the alternate institution / bank which would work out the detailed\nrestructuring package at the first meeting of the Empowered Group when the\npreliminary report of the CDR Cell comes up for consideration.\nd) The CDR Empowered Group would be mandated to look into each case of\ndebt restructuring, examine the viability and rehabilitation potential of the\nCompany and approve the restructuring package within a specified time frame\nof 90 days, or at best within 180 days of reference to the Empowered Group.\nThe CDR Empowered Group shall decide on the acceptable viability\nbenchmark levels on the following illustrative parameters, which may be\napplied on a case-by-case basis, based on the merits of each case:\n\u2022 Return on Capital Employed ( ROCE),\n\u2022 Debt Service Coverage Ratio ( DSCR),\n\u2022 Gap between the Internal Rate of Return ( IRR) and the Cost of Fund ( CoF),\n\u2022 Extent of sacrifice.RBI_MC_IRAC_200315\ne) The Boards of each bank / FI should authorise its Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO) and / or Executive Director (ED) to decide on the restructuring package\nin respect of cases referred to the CDR system, with the requisite requirements\nto meet the control needs. CDR Empowered Group will meet on two or three\noccasions in respect of each borrowal account. This will provide an\nopportunity to the participating members to seek proper authorisations from\ntheir CEO / ED, in case of need, in respect of those cases where the critical\nparameters of restructuring are beyond the authority delegated to him / her.\nf) The decisions of the CDR Empowered Group shall be final. If restructuring of\ndebt is found to be viable and feasible and approved by the Empowered\nGroup, the company would be put on the restructuring mode. If restructuring\nis not found viable, the creditors would then be free to take necessary steps for\nimmediate recovery of dues and / or liquidation or winding up of the company,\ncollectively or individually.\niii) CDR Cell\na) The CDR Standing Forum and the CDR Empowered Group will be assisted by\na CDR Cell in all their functions. The CDR Cell will make the initial scrutiny\nof the proposals received from borrowers / lenders, by calling for proposed\nrehabilitation plan and other information and put up the matter before the CDR\nEmpowered Group, within one month to decide whether rehabilitation is\nprima facie feasible. If found feasible, the CDR Cell will proceed to prepare\ndetailed Rehabilitation Plan with the help of lenders and, if necessary, experts\nto be engaged from outside. If not found prima facie feasible, the lenders may\nstart action for recovery of their dues.\nb) All references for corporate debt restructuring by lenders or borrowers will be\nmade to the CDR Cell. It shall be the responsibility of the lead institution /\nmajor stakeholder to the corporate, to work out a preliminary restructuring\nplan in consultation with other stakeholders and submit to the CDR Cell\nwithin one month. The CDR Cell will prepare the restructuring plan in terms\nof the general policies and guidelines approved by the CDR Standing Forum\nand place for consideration of the Empowered Group within 30 days for\ndecision. The Empowered Group can approve or suggest modifications but\nensure that a final decision is taken within a total period of 90 days. However,\nfor sufficient reasons the period can be extended up to a maximum of 180 days\nfrom the date of reference to the CDR Cell.\nc) The CDR Standing Forum, the CDR Empowered Group and CDR Cell shall\nbe initially housed in IDBI and thereafter at a place as may be decided by the\nStanding Forum. The administrative and other costs shall be shared by all\nfinancial institutions and banks. The sharing pattern shall be as determined by\nthe Standing Forum.\nd) CDR Cell will have adequate members of staff deputed from banks and\nfinancial institutions. The CDR Cell may also take outside professional help.\nThe initial cost in operating the CDR  mechanism including CDR  Cell will be\nmet by IDBI  initially for one year and then from contribution from the\nfinancial institutions and banks in the Core Group at the rate of Rs.50 lakhRBI_MC_IRAC_200316\neach and contribution from other institutions and banks at the rate of Rs.5 lakh\neach.\nD. Other features\ni) Eligibility criteria\na) The scheme will not apply to accounts involving only one financial institution\nor one bank. The CDR mechanism will cover only multiple banking accounts /\nsyndication / consortium accounts with outstanding exposure of Rs.20 crore\nand above by banks and institutions.\nb) The Category 1 CDR system will be applicable only to accounts classified as\n'standard' and 'sub-standard'.  There may be a situation where a small portion\nof debt by a bank might be classified as doubtful.  In that situation, if the\naccount has been classified as \u2018standard\u2019/ \u2018substandard\u2019 in the books of at least\n90% of lenders (by value), the same would be treated as standard /\nsubstandard, only for the purpose of judging the account as eligibile  for CDR,\nin the books of the remaining 10% of lenders.  There would be no requirement\nof the account / company being sick, NPA or being in default for a specified\nperiod before reference to the CDR system. However, potentially viable cases\nof NPAs will get priority. This approach would provide the necessary\nflexibility and facilitate timely intervention for debt restructuring. Prescribing\nany milestone(s) may not be necessary, since the debt restructuring exercise is\nbeing triggered by banks and financial institutions or with their consent.\nc) In no case, the requests of any corporate indulging in wilful default, fraud or\nmisfeasance, even in a single bank , will be considered for restructuring under\nCDR system.\nd) The accounts where recovery suits have been filed by the lenders against the\ncompany, may be eligible for consideration under the CDR system provided,\nthe initiative to resolve the case under the CDR system is taken by at least\n75% of the lenders (by value). However, for restructuring of such accounts\nunder the CDR system, it should be ensured that the account meets the basic\ncriteria for becoming eligible under the CDR mechanism.\ne) BIFR cases are not eligible for restructuring under the CDR system. However,\nlarge value BIFR cases, may be eligible for restructuring under the CDR\nsystem if specifically recommended by the CDR Core Group. The Core Group\nshall recommend exceptional BIFR cases on a case-to-case basis for\nconsideration under the CDR system. It should be ensured that the lending\ninstitutions complete all the formalities in seeking the approval from BIFR\nbefore implementing the package.\nii) Reference to CDR systemRBI_MC_IRAC_200317\na) Reference to Corporate Debt Restructuring System could be triggered by ( i)\nany or more of the creditor who have minimum 20% share in either working\ncapital or term finance, or (ii) by the concerned corporate, if supported by a\nbank or financial institution having stake as in ( i) above.\nb) Though flexibility is available whereby the lenders could either consider\nrestructuring outside the purview of the CDR system or even initiate legal\nproceedings where warranted, banks / FIs should review all eligible cases\nwhere the exposure of the financial system is more than Rs.100 crore and\ndecide about referring the case to CDR system or to proceed under the new\nSecuritisation  and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of\nSecurities Interest Act, 2002 or to file a suit in DRT  etc.\niii) Legal Basis\na) CDR will be a non-statutory mechanism which will be a voluntary system\nbased on Debtor-Creditor Agreement ( DCA) and Inter-Creditor Agreement\n(ICA).\nb) The Debtor-Creditor Agreement ( DCA) and the Inter-Creditor Agreement\n(ICA) shall provide the legal basis to the CDR mechanism. The debtors shall\nhave to accede to the DCA, either at the time of original loan documentation\n(for future cases) or at the time of reference to Corporate Debt Restructuring\nCell. Similarly, all participants in the CDR mechanism through their\nmembership of the Standing Forum shall have to enter into a legally binding\nagreement, with necessary enforcement and penal clauses, to operate the\nSystem through laid-down policies and guidelines.  The ICA signed by the\ncreditors will be initially valid for a period of 3 years and subject to renewal\nfor further periods of 3 years thereafter. The lenders in foreign currency\noutside the country are not a part of CDR system.  Such lenders and also\nlenders like GIC, LIC, UTI, etc., and other third parties who have not joined\nthe CDR system, could join CDR mechanism of a particular corporate by\nsigning transaction to transaction ICA, wherever they have exposure to such\ncorporate.\nc) The Inter-Creditor Agreement would be a legally binding agreement amongst\nthe creditors, with necessary enforcement and penal clauses, wherein the\ncreditors would commit themselves to abide by the various elements of CDR\nsystem. Further, the creditors shall agree that if 75 per cent of creditors by\nvalue, agree to a restructuring package of an existing debt (i.e., debt\noutstanding), the same would be binding on the remaining creditors.  Since\nCategory 1 CDR Scheme covers only standard and sub-standard accounts,\nwhich in the opinion of 75 per cent of the creditors, are likely to become\nperforming after introduction of the CDR package, it is expected that all other\ncreditors (i.e., those outside the minimum 75 per cent) would be willing to\nparticipate in the entire CDR package, including the agreed additional\nfinancing.  However, in case for any internal reason, any creditor (outside the\nminimum 75 per cent) does not wish to commit additional financing, that\ncreditor will have the option.  At the same time, in order to avoid the \u201cfreeRBI_MC_IRAC_200318\nrider\u201d problem, it is necessary to provide some disincentive to the creditor\nwho wishes to exercise this option.  Such creditor can either (a) arrange for his\nshare of additional financing to be provided by a new or existing creditor, or\n(b) agree to deferment of the first year\u2019s interest due to him after the CDR\npackage becomes effective.  The first year\u2019s deferred interest as mentioned\nabove, without compounding, will be payable along with the last instalment of\nthe principal due to the creditor.\niv) Stand-Still Clause\na) One of the most important elements of Debtor-Creditor Agreement would be\n'stand still' agreement binding for 90 days, or 180 days by both sides. Under\nthis clause, both the debtor and creditor(s) shall agree to a legally binding\n'stand-still' whereby both the parties commit themselves not to taking recourse\nto any other legal action during the 'stand-still' period, this would be necessary\nfor enabling the CDR System to undertake the necessary debt restructuring\nexercise without any outside intervention, judicial or otherwise. However, the\nstand-still clause will be applicable only to any civil action either by the\nborrower or any lender against the other party and will not cover any criminal\naction.  Further, during the stand-still period, outstanding foreign exchange\nforward contracts, derivative products, etc., can be crystallised, provided the\nborrower is agreeable to such crystallisation.   The borrower will additionally\nundertake that during the stand-still period the documents will stand extended\nfor the purpose of limitation and also that he will not approach any other\nauthority for any relief and the directors of the borrowing company will not\nresign from the Board of Directors during the stand-still period.\nb) During pendency of the case with the CDR system, the usual asset\nclassification norms would continue to apply. The process of reclassification\nof an asset should not stop merely because the case is referred to the CDR\nCell. However, if restructuring under the CDR system takes place, the asset\nclassification status should be restored to the position which existed when the\nreference to the Cell was made. Consequently, any additional provisions made\nby banks towards deterioration in the asset classification status during the\npendency of the case with the CDR system may be reversed.\nv) Additional finance\na) The providers of additional finance, whether existing lenders or new lenders,\nshall have a preferential claim, to be worked out under the restructuring\npackage, over the providers of existing finance with respect to the cash flows\nout of recoveries, in respect of the additional exposure.\nb) The additional finance extended to borrowers in terms of restructuring\npackages approved under the CDR system may be exempted from\nprovisioning requirement for the specified period as defined at paragraph 5.2.3\nbelow.RBI_MC_IRAC_200319\nvi) Exit Option\na) As mentioned in paragraph 4.3.3 above, the proposals for restructuring\npackage should provide for option to a particular lender or lenders (outside the\nminimum 75 per cent who have agreed for restructuring) who for any internal\nreason, does/do not fully abide by the CDR Empowered Group's decision on\nrestructuring. The lenders who wish to exit from the package would have the\noption to sell their existing share to either the existing lenders or fresh lenders,\nat an appropriate price, which would be decided mutually between the exiting\nlender and the taking over lender. The new lenders shall rank on par with the\nexisting lenders for repayment and servicing of the dues since they have taken\nover the existing dues to the exiting lender. In addition, the 'exit option' will\nalso be available to all other lenders within the minimum 75 per cent, provided\nthe purchaser agrees to abide by the restructuring package approved by the\nEmpowered Group.\nb) The exiting lenders may be allowed to continue with their existing level of\nexposure to the borrower provided they tie up with either the existing lenders\nor fresh lenders for taking up their share of additional finance.\nvii) Conversion option\na) The CDR Empowered Group, while deciding the restructuring package,\nshould decide on the issue regarding convertibility (into equity) option as a\npart of restructuring exercise whereby the banks / financial institutions shall\nhave the right to convert a portion of the restructured amount into equity,\nkeeping in view the statutory requirement under Section 19 of the Banking\nRegulation Act, 1949, (in the case of banks) and relevant SEBI  regulations.\nb) Exemptions from the capital market exposure ceilings prescribed by RBI in\nrespect of such equity acquisitions should be obtained from RBI on a case-to-\ncase basis by the concerned lenders.\nviii) Category 2 CDR System\na) There have been instances where the projects have been found to be viable by the\nlenders but the accounts could not be taken up for restructuring under the CDR system\nas they fell under \u2018doubtful\u2019 category. Hence, a second category of CDR  is introduced\nfor cases where the accounts have been classified as \u2018doubtful\u2019 in the books of\nlenders, and if a minimum of 75% (by value) of the lenders satisfy themselves of the\nviability of the account and consent for such restructuring, subject to the following\nconditions:\n(i) It will not be binding on the creditors to take up additional financing worked\nout under the debt restructuring package and the decision to lend or not to lend\nwill depend on each creditor bank / FI separately. In other words, under the\nproposed second category of the CDR mechanism, the existing loans will onlyRBI_MC_IRAC_200320\nbe restructured and it would be up to the promoter to firm up additional\nfinancing arrangement with new or existing lenders individually.\n(ii) All other norms under the CDR mechanism such as the standstill clause, asset\nclassification status during the pendency of restructuring under CDR, etc., will\ncontinue to be applicable to this category also.\nb) No individual case should be referred to RBI.  CDR Core Group may take a final\ndecision whether a particular case falls under the CDR guidelines or it does not.\nc) All the other features of the CDR system as applicable to the First Category will also\nbe applicable to cases restructured under the Second Category.\nE. Accounting treatment for restructured accounts\ni) The accounting treatment of accounts restructured under CDR system, including\naccounts classified as 'doubtful' under Category 2 CDR,  would be governed by the\nprudential norms indicated in circular DBOD.BP.BC.98/21.04.048/2000-01  dated\nMarch 30, 2001. Restructuring of corporate debts under CDR system could take place\nin the following stages:\na. before commencement of commercial production;\nb. after commencement of commercial production but before the asset has been\nclassified as \u2018sub-standard\u2019;\nc. after commencement of commercial production and the asset has been classified as\n\u2018sub-standard\u2019 or \u2018doubtful\u2019.\nii) The prudential treatment of the accounts, subjected to restructuring under CDR\nsystem, would be governed by the following norms:\niii) Treatment of \u2018standard\u2019 accounts restructured under CDR\na. A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, at any of the aforesaid first\ntwo stages [paragraph E.1(a) and E.1(b) above] would not cause a standard asset to be\nclassified in the sub-standard category, provided the loan / credit facility is fully\nsecured.\nb. A rescheduling of interest element at any of the foregoing first two stages would\nnot cause an asset to be downgraded to sub-standard category subject to the condition\nthat the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the element of interest, measured in present\nvalue terms, is either written off or provision is made to the extent of the sacrifice\ninvolved. For the purpose, the future interest due as per the original loan agreement in\nrespect of an account should be discounted to the present value at a rate appropriate to\nthe risk category of the borrower (i.e. current PLR + the appropriate credit risk\npremium for the borrower-category) and compared with the present value of the duesRBI_MC_IRAC_200321\nexpected to be received under the restructuring package, discounted on the same\nbasis.\nc. In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value terms,\nas at (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or provision made\nto the extent of the sacrifice involved.\niv) Treatment of \u2018sub-standard\u2019 / \u2018doubtful\u2019 accounts restructured under CDR\na. A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, would render a sub-standard  /\n\u2018doubtful\u2019  asset eligible to be continued in the sub-standard /  \u2018doubtful\u2019 category for\nthe specified period, provided the loan / credit facility is fully secured.\nb. A rescheduling of interest element would render a sub-standard / \u2018doubtful\u2019 asset\neligible to be continued to be classified in sub-standard / \u2018doubtful\u2019 category for the\nspecified period subject to the condition that the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the\nelement of interest, measured in present value terms, is either written off or provision\nis made to the extent of the sacrifice involved. For the purpose, the future interest due\nas per the original loan agreement in respect of an account should be discounted to the\npresent value at a rate appropriate to the risk category of the borrower (i.e., current\nPLR + the appropriate credit risk premium for the borrower-category) and compared\nwith the present value of the dues expected to be received under the restructuring\npackage, discounted on the same basis.\nc. In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value terms,\nas at (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or provision made\nto the extent of the sacrifice involved. Even in cases where the sacrifice is by way of\nwrite off of the past interest dues, the asset should continue to be treated as sub-\nstandard / \u2018doubtful\u2019.\nv) The sub-standard / doubtful accounts at E. iv (a), (b) and (c) above, which have been\nsubjected to restructuring, etc. whether in respect of principal instalment or interest\namount, by whatever modality, would be eligible to be upgraded to the standard\ncategory only after the specified period, i.e., a period of one year after the date when\nfirst payment of interest or of principal, whichever is earlier, falls due under the\nrescheduled terms, subject to satisfactory performance during the period. The amount\nof provision made earlier, net of the amount provided for the sacrifice in the interest\namount in present value terms as aforesaid, could also be reversed after the one-year\nperiod.\nvi) During this one-year period, the sub-standard / doubtful asset will not deteriorate in its\nclassification if satisfactory performance of the account is demonstrated during the\nperiod. In case, however, the satisfactory performance during the one year period is\nnot evidenced, the asset classification of the restructured account would be governed\nas per the applicable prudential norms with reference to the pre-restructuring payment\nschedule.RBI_MC_IRAC_200322\nvii) The asset classification under CDR would continue to be bank-specific based on\nrecord of recovery of each bank, as per the existing prudential norms applicable to\nbanks.\nF. Disclosure\nBanks / FIs should also disclose in their published annual Balance Sheets, under \"Notes on\nAccounts\", the following information in respect of corporate debt restructuring undertaken\nduring the year:\n(a) Total amount of loan assets subjected to restructuring under CDR.\n[(a) = ( b)+(c)+(d)]\n(b) The amount of standard assets subjected to CDR.\n(c) The amount of sub-standard assets subjected to CDR.\n(d) The amount of doubtful assets subjected to CDR.\nG. Implementation of the revised guidelines\nThe above guidelines will be implemented with prospective effect.  The ICA and DCA will\nhave to be suitable amended for incorporating the changes introduced in the scheme.\n4.2.16     Projects under implementation\nIt was observed that there were instances, where despite substantial time overrun in the\nprojects under implementation, the underlying loan assets remained classified in the standard\ncategory merely because the project continued to be under implementation.  Recognising that\nunduly long time overrun in a project adversely affected its viability and the quality of the\nasset deteriorated, a need was felt to evolve an objective and definite time-frame for\ncompletion of projects so as to ensure that the loan assets relating to projects under\nimplementation were appropriately classified and asset quality correctly reflected.  In the\nlight of the above background, it was decided to extend the norms detailed below on income\nrecognition, asset classification and provisioning to banks with respect to industrial projects\nunder implementation, which involve time overrun.\n(i) The projects under implementation are grouped  into three categories for the purpose\nof determining the date when the project ought to be completed:\nCategory I: Projects where financial closure had been achieved and formally\ndocumented.\nCategory II: Projects sanctioned before 1997 with original project cost of Rs.100\ncrore or more where financial closure was not formally documented.\nCategory: III: Projects sanctioned before 1997 with original project cost of less than\nRs.100 crore  where financial closure was not formally documented.RBI_MC_IRAC_200323\nAsset classification\n(ii) In case of  each of the three categories, the date when the project ought to be\ncompleted and the classification of the underlying loan asset should be determined in the\nfollowing manner:\nCategory I  (Projects where financial closure had been achieved and formally documented): In\nsuch cases the date of completion of the project should be as envisaged at the time of original\nfinancial closure.  In all such cases, the asset may be treated as standard asset for a period\nnot exceeding two years beyond the date of completion of the project, as originally envisaged\nat the time of initial financial closure of the project .\nIn case, however, in respect of a project financed after 1997, the financial closure had not\nbeen formally documented, the norms enumerated for category III below, would apply.\nCategory  II  (Projects sanctioned before 1997 with original project cost of Rs.100 crore or\nmore where financial closure was not formally documented): For such projects sanctioned\nprior to 1997, where the date of financial closure had not been formally documented, an\nindependent Group was constituted with experts from the term lending institutions as well as\noutside experts in the field to decide on the deemed date of completion of projects.  The\nGroup, based on all material and relevant facts and circumstances, has decided the deemed\ndate of completion of the project, on a project-by-project basis.  In such cases, the asset may\nbe treated as standard asset for a period not exceeding two years beyond the deemed date of\ncompletion of the project, as decided by the Group .   Banks, which have extended finance\ntowards such projects, may approach the lead financial institutions to which a copy of the\nindependent Group\u2019s report has been furnished for obtaining the particulars relating to the\ndeemed date of completion of project concerned.\nCategory  III  (Projects sanctioned before 1997 with original project cost of less than Rs.100\ncrore where financial closure was not formally documented):  In these cases, sanctioned prior\nto 1997, where the financial closure was not formally documented, the date of completion of\nthe project would be as originally envisaged at the time of sanction.  In such cases, the asset\nmay be treated as standard asset only for a period not exceeding two years beyond the date\nof completion of the project as originally envisaged at the time of sanction.\n(iii) In all the three foregoing categories, in case of time overruns beyond the aforesaid\nperiod of two years, the asset should be classified as sub-standard regardless of the record of\nrecovery and provided for accordingly.\n(iv) As regards the projects to be financed by the FIs/ banks in future, the date of\ncompletion of the project should be clearly spelt out at the time of financial closure of the\nproject.  In such cases, if the date of commencement of commercial production extends\nbeyond a period of six months after the date of completion of the project, as originally\nenvisaged at the time of initial financial closure of the project, the account should be treated\nas a sub-standard asset.\nIncome recognitionRBI_MC_IRAC_200324\n(v) Banks may recognise income on accrual basis in respect of the above three categories of\nprojects under implementation, which are classified as \u2018standard\u2019.\n(vi)   Banks should not recognise income on accrual basis in respect of the above three\ncategories of projects under implementation  which are classified as a \u2018substandard\u2019 asset.\nBanks may recognise income in such accounts only on realisation on cash basis.\nConsequently, banks which have wrongly recognised  income in the past should reverse the\ninterest if it was recognised as income during the current year or make a provision for an\nequivalent amount if it was recognised as income in the previous year(s).  As regards the\nregulatory treatment of \u2018funded interest\u2019 recognised as income and \u2018conversion into equity,\ndebentures or any other instrument\u2019 banks should adopt the following:\na) Funded Interest : Income recognition in respect of the NPAs, regardless of whether\nthese are or are not subjected to restructuring/ rescheduling/ renegotiation of terms of\nthe loan agreement, should be done strictly on cash basis, only on realisation and not\nif the amount of interest overdue has been funded. If, however, the amount of funded\ninterest is recognised as income, a provision for an equal amount should also be made\nsimultaneously.  In other words, any funding of interest in respect of NPAs, if\nrecognised as income, should be fully provided for.\nb) Conversion into equity, debentures or any other instrument : The amount\noutstanding converted into other instruments would normally comprise principal and\nthe interest components.  If the amount of interest dues is converted into equity or any\nother instrument, and income is recognised in consequence, full provision should be\nmade for the amount of income so recognised to offset the effect of such income\nrecognition. Such provision would be in addition to the amount of provision that may\nbe necessary for the depreciation in the value of the equity or other instruments, as per\nthe investment valuation norms.  However, if the conversion of interest is into equity\nwhich is quoted, interest income can be recognised at market value of equity, as on\nthe date of conversion, not exceeding the amount of interest converted to equity.\nSuch equity must thereafter be classified in the \u201cavailable for sale\u201d category and\nvalued at lower of cost or market value.  In case of conversion of principal and /or\ninterest in respect of NPAs into debentures, such debentures should be treated as\nNPA, ab initio , in the same asset classification as was applicable to loan just before\nconversion and provision made as per norms.  This norm would also apply to zero\ncoupon bonds or other instruments which seek to defer the liability of the issuer. On\nsuch debentures, income should be recognised only on realisation basis. The income\nin respect of unrealised interest which is converted into debentures or any other fixed\nmaturity instrument should be recognised only on redemption of such instrument.\nSubject to the above, the equity shares or other instruments arising from conversion of\nthe principal amount of loan would also be subject to the usual prudential valuation\nnorms as applicable to such instruments.\nProvisioning\n(vii)    While there will be no change in the extant norms on provisioning for NPAs, banks\nwhich are already holding provisions against some of the accounts, which may now be\nclassified as \u2018standard\u2019, shall continue to hold the provisions and shall not reverse the same.RBI_MC_IRAC_200325\n4.2.17  Availability of security / net worth of borrower/ guarantor\nThe availability of security or net worth of borrower/ guarantor should not be taken into\naccount for the propose of treating an advance as NPA or otherwise, as income recognition is\nbased on record of recovery.\n4.2.18 Take-out Finance\nTakeout finance is the product emerging in the context of the funding of long-term\ninfrastructure projects. Under this arrangement, the institution/the bank financing\ninfrastructure projects will have an arrangement with any financial institution for transferring\nto the latter the outstanding in respect of such financing in their books on a pre-determined\nbasis.  In view of the time-lag involved in taking-over, the possibility of a default in the\nmeantime cannot be ruled out. The norms of asset classification will have to be followed by\nthe concerned bank/financial institution in whose books the account stands as balance sheet\nitem as on the relevant date.  If the lending institution observes that the asset has turned NPA\non the basis of the record of recovery, it should be classified accordingly.   The lending\ninstitution should not recognise income on accrual basis and account for the same only when\nit is paid by the borrower/ taking over institution (if the arrangement so provides).  The\nlending institution should also make provisions against any asset turning into NPA pending\nits take over by taking over institution.  As and when the asset is taken over by the taking\nover institution, the corresponding provisions could be reversed.  However, the taking over\ninstitution, on taking over such assets, should make provisions treating the account as NPA\nfrom the actual date of it becoming NPA even though the account was not in its books as on\nthat date.\n4.2.19 Post-shipment Supplier's Credit\ni) In respect of post-shipment credit extended by the banks covering export of goods\nto countries for which the ECGC\u2019s  cover is available, EXIM  Bank has introduced\na guarantee-cum-refinance programme whereby, in the event of default, EXIM\nBank will pay the guaranteed amount to the bank within a period of 30 days from\nthe day the bank invokes the guarantee after the exporter has filed claim with\nECGC .\nii) Accordingly, to the extent payment has been received from the EXIM Bank, the\nadvance may not be treated as a non-performing asset for asset classification and\nprovisioning purposes.\n4.2.20   Export Project Finance\n(i) In respect of export project finance, there could be instances where the actual\nimporter has paid the dues to the bank abroad but the bank in turn is unable to\nremit the amount due to political developments such as war, strife, UN embargo,\netc.\n(ii) In such cases, where the lending bank is able to establish through documentary\nevidence that the importer has cleared the dues in full by depositing the amount in\nthe bank abroad before it turned into NPA  in the books of the bank, but the\nimporter's country is not allowing the funds to be remitted due to political or otherRBI_MC_IRAC_200326\nreasons, the asset classification may be made after a period of one year from the\ndate the amount was deposited by the importer in the bank abroad.\n4.2.21  Advances under rehabilitation approved by BIFR/ TLI\nBanks are not permitted to upgrade the classification of any advance in respect of which the\nterms have been re-negotiated unless the package of re-negotiated terms has worked\nsatisfactorily for a period of one year. While the existing credit facilities sanctioned to a unit\nunder rehabilitation packages approved by BIFR /term lending institutions will continue to be\nclassified as sub-standard or doubtful as the case may be, in respect of additional facilities\nsanctioned under the rehabilitation packages, the Income Recognition, Asset Classification\nnorms will become applicable after a period of one year from the date of disbursement.\n5  PROVISIONING NORMS\n5.1 General\n5.1.1 In order to narrow down the divergences and ensure adequate provisioning by banks, t\nwas suggested that a bank's statutory auditors, if they so desire, could have  a dialogue with\nRBI's Regional  Office/ inspectors who carried out the bank's inspection during the previous\nyear  with regard to the accounts contributing to the difference.\n5.1.2  Pursuant to this, regional offices were advised to forward  a list of individual advances,\nwhere  the variance in the provisioning requirements between the RBI and the bank is above\ncertain cut off levels so that the bank and the statutory auditors  take into account the\nassessment of the RBI while making provisions for loan loss, etc.\n5.1.3 The primary responsibility for making adequate provisions for any diminution in the\nvalue of loan assets, investment or other assets is that of the bank managements and the\nstatutory auditors. The assessment made by the inspecting officer of the RBI is furnished to\nthe bank to assist the bank management and the statutory auditors in taking a decision in\nregard to making adequate and necessary provisions in terms of prudential guidelines.\n5.1.4 In conformity with the prudential norms, provisions should be made on the non-\nperforming assets on the basis of classification of assets into prescribed categories as detailed\nin paragraphs 4 supra. Taking into account the time lag between an account becoming\ndoubtful of recovery, its recognition as such, the realisation of the security and the erosion\nover time in the value of security charged to the bank, the banks should make provision\nagainst sub-standard assets, doubtful assets and loss assets as below:\n5.2 Loss assets\nThe entire asset should be written off. If the assets are permitted to remain in the books for\nany reason, 100 percent of the outstanding should be provided for.\n5.3 Doubtful assets\ni) 100 percent of the extent to which the advance is not covered by the realisable value of the\nsecurity to which the bank has a valid recourse and the realisable value is estimated on a\nrealistic basis.RBI_MC_IRAC_200327\nii) In regard to the secured portion, provision may be made on the following basis, at the rates\nranging from 20 percent to 50 percent of the secured portion depending upon the period for\nwhich the asset has remained doubtful:\nPeriod for which the advance has been\nconsidered as doubtfulProvision requirement\n(%)\nUp to one year 20\nOne to three years 30\nMore than three years 50\niii) Additional provisioning consequent upon the change in the definition of doubt ful\nassets ( vide para 4.1.2 above) effective from March 31, 2001  was to be made in phases as\nunder:\n\u2022 As on 31.03.2001, 50 percent of the additional provisioning requirement on the assets\nwhich became doubtful on account of new norm of 18 months for transition from sub-\nstandard asset to doubtful category.\n\u2022 As on 31.03.2002, balance of the provisions not made during the previous year, in\naddition to the provisions needed, as on 31.03.2002.\n\u2022 iv)  Banks are permitted to phase the additional provisioning consequent upon the\nreduction in the transition period  from substandard to doubtful asset from 18 to 12\nmonths  over a four year period commencing from the year ending March 31, 2005,\nwith a minimum of 20 % each year.\n\u2022 Note:  Valuation of Security for provisioning purposes\nWith a view to bringing down divergence arising out of difference in assessment of the value\nof security ,  in cases of NPAs with balance of Rs. 5 crore and above stock    audit   at   annual\nintervals   by   external agencies appointed as per the guidelines approved by the Board\nwould be mandatory in order to enhance the reliability on stock valuation. Collaterals such as\nimmovable properties charged in favour of the bank should be got valued once in three years\nby valuers appointed as per the guidelines  approved by the Board of Directors.\n5.4 Sub-standard assets\nA general provision of 10 percent on total outstanding should be made without making any\nallowance for DICGC/ ECGC guarantee cover and securities available.\n5.5  Standard assets\n(i) From the year ending 31.03.2000, the banks should make a general provision of a\nminimum of 0.25 percent on standard assets on global loan portfolio basis.\n(ii) The provisions on standard assets should not be reckoned for arriving at net NPAs.\n(iii)The provisions towards Standard Assets need not be netted from gross advances but\nshown separately as 'Contingent Provisions against Standard Assets' under 'Other Liabilities\nand Provisions - Others' in Schedule 5 of the balance sheet.\n5.6 Floating provisionsRBI_MC_IRAC_200328\nSome of the banks make a 'floating provision' over and above the specific provisions made in\nrespect of accounts identified as NPAs. The floating provisions, wherever available, could be\nset-off against provisions required to be made as per above stated provisioning guidelines.\nConsidering that higher loan loss provisioning adds to the overall financial strength of the\nbanks and the stability of the financial sector, banks are urged to voluntarily set apart\nprovisions much above the minimum prudential levels  as a desirable practice.\n5.7 Provisions on Leased Assets\ni)   Sub-standard assets\na) 10 percent of the 'net book value'.\nb)  As per the 'Guidance Note on Accounting for Leases' issued by the ICAI, 'Gross\nbook value' of a fixed asset is its historical cost or other amount substituted for\nhistorical cost in the books of account or financial statements. Statutory depreciation\nshould be shown separately in the Profit & Loss Account. Accumulated depreciation\nshould be deducted from the Gross Book Value of the leased asset in the balance\nsheet of the lessor to arrive at the 'net book value'.\nc) Also, balance standing in 'Lease Adjustment Account' should be adjusted in the 'net\nbook value' of the leased assets. The amount of adjustment in respect of each class of\nfixed assets may be shown either in the main balance sheet or in the Fixed Assets\nSchedule as a separate column in the section related to leased assets.\nii)     Doubtful assets\n100 percent of the extent to which the finance is not secured by the realisable value of\nthe leased asset. Realisable value to be estimated on a realistic basis. In addition to the\nabove provision, the following provision on the net book value of the secured portion\nshould be made, depending upon the period for which asset has been doubtful:\nPeriod %age of provision\nUp to one year 20\nOne to three years 30\nMore than three years 50\niii)  Loss assets\nThe entire asset should be written-off. If for any reason, an asset is allowed to remain in\nbooks, 100 percent of the 'net book value'  should be provided for.\n5.8 Guidelines for Provisions under Special Circumstances\n5.8.1 Government guaranteed advances\n(i) With effect from 31 March 2000, in respect of advances sanctioned against State\nGovernment guarantee, if the guarantee is invoked and remains in default for\nmore than two quarters (180 days at present), the banks should make normal\nprovisions as prescribed in paragraph 4.1.2  above.RBI_MC_IRAC_200329\n(ii) As regards advances guaranteed by State Governments, in respect of which\nguarantee stood invoked as on 31.03.2000, necessary provision was allowed to be\nmade, in a phased manner, during the financial years ending 31.03.2000 to\n31.03.2003 with a minimum of 25 percent each year.\n5.8.2 Advances granted under rehabilitation packages approved by BIFR/term lending\ninstitutions\n(i) In respect of advances under rehabilitation package approved by BIFR/term\nlending institutions, the provision should continue to be made in respect of dues to\nthe bank on the existing credit facilities as per their classification as sub-standard\nor doubtful asset.\n(ii) As regards the additional facilities sanctioned as per package finalised by BIFR\nand/or term lending institutions, provision on additional facilities sanctioned need\nnot be made for a period of one year from the date of disbursement.\n(iii) In respect of additional credit facilities granted to SSI units which are identified as\nsick [as defined in RPCD  circular No.PLNFS.BC.57 /06.04.01/2001-2002 dated\n16 January 2002] and where rehabilitation packages/nursing programmes have\nbeen drawn by the banks themselves or under consortium arrangements, no\nprovision need be made for a period of one year.\n5.8.3  Advances against term deposits, NSCs eligible for surrender, IVPs, KVPs, and life\npolicies are exempted from provisioning requirements.\n5.8.4 However, advances against gold ornaments, government securities and all other kinds\nof securities are not exempted from provisioning requirements.\n5.8.5 Treatment of interest suspense account\nAmounts held in Interest Suspense Account should not be reckoned as part of provisions.\nAmounts lying in the Interest Suspense Account should be deducted from the relative\nadvances and thereafter, provisioning as per the norms, should be made on the balances after\nsuch deduction.\n5.8.6 Advances covered by ECGC/ DICGC   guarantee\nIn the case of advances guaranteed by DICGC/ ECGC, provision should be made only for the\nbalance in excess of the amount guaranteed by these Corporations. Further, while arriving at\nthe provision required to be made for doubtful assets, realisable value of the securities should\nfirst be deducted from the outstanding balance in respect of the amount guaranteed by these\nCorporations and then provision made as illustrated hereunder:\nExample\nOutstanding Balance Rs. 4 lakhs\nDICGC Cover 50 percent\nPeriod for which the advance has remained\ndoubtfulMore than 3 years remained\ndoubtful\nValue of security held\n(excludes worth of Rs.)Rs. 1.50 lakhsRBI_MC_IRAC_200330\nProvision required to be made\nOutstanding balance Rs. 4.00 lakhs\nLess: Value of security held Rs. 1.50 lakhs\nUnrealised balance Rs. 2.50 lakhs\nLess: DICGC Cover\n(50% of unrealisable balance)Rs. 1.25 lakhs\nNet unsecured balance Rs. 1.25 lakhs\nProvision for unsecured portion of advance Rs. 1.25 lakhs (@ 100 percent of\nunsecured portion)\nProvision for secured portion of advance Rs. 0.75 lakhs (@ 50 percent of\nsecured portion)\nTotal provision required to be made Rs. 2.00 lakhs\n5.8.7  Advance covered by CGTSI guarantee\nIn case the advance covered by CGTSI guarantee becomes non-performing, no provision\nneed be made towards the guaranteed portion. The amount outstanding in excess of the\nguaranteed portion should be provided for as per the extant guidelines on provisioning for\nnon-performing advances.  Two illustrative examples are given below:\nExample I\nAsset classification status: Doubtful \u2013 More than 3 years;\nCGTSI Cover 75% of the amount outstanding or\n75% of the unsecured    amount or\nRs.18.75 lakh, whichever is the\nleast\nRealisable value of Security  Rs.1.50 lakh\nBalance outstanding Rs.10.00 lakh\nLess  Realisable  value of\nsecurityRs.  1.50 lakh\nUnsecured amount Rs. 8.50 lakh\nLess CGTSI cover (75%) Rs. 6.38  lakh\nNet unsecured and uncovered\nportion:Rs. 2.12  lakh\nProvision Required\nSecured portion Rs.1.50 lakh Rs.  0.75 lakh (@ 50%)\nUnsecured & uncovered\nportionRs.2.12 lakh Rs.  2.12 lakh ( 100%)\nTotal provision required Rs.  2.87 lakh\nExample II\nAsset classification status Doubtful \u2013 More than 3 years;\nCGTSI Cover 75% of the amount outstanding\nor75% of the unsecured    amount\nor   Rs.18.75 lakh, whichever is\nthe least\nRealisable value of Security  Rs.10.00 lakh\nBalance outstanding Rs.40.00 lakh\nLess  Realisable  value of Rs. 10.00 lakhRBI_MC_IRAC_200331\nsecurity\nUnsecured amount Rs. 30.00 lakh\nLess CGTSI cover (75%) Rs. 18.75 lakh\nNet unsecured and uncovered\nportion:Rs. 11.25 lakh\nProvision Required\nSecured portion Rs.10.00 lakh Rs.  5.00 lakh (@ 50%)\nUnsecured & uncovered\nportionRs.11.25 lakh Rs.11.25  lakh (100%)\nTotal provision required Rs. 16.25  lakh\n5.8.8  Take-out finance\nThe lending institution should make provisions against a 'take-out finance' turning into NPA\npending its take-over by the taking-over institution. As and when the asset is taken-over by\nthe taking-over institution, the corresponding provisions could be reversed.\n5.8.9 Reserve for Exchange Rate Fluctuations Account ( RERFA)\nWhen exchange rate movements of Indian rupee turn adverse, the outstanding amount of\nforeign currency denominated loans (where actual disbursement was made in Indian Rupee)\nwhich becomes overdue, goes up correspondingly, with its attendant implications of\nprovisioning requirements. Such assets should not normally be revalued. In case such assets\nneed to be revalued as per requirement of accounting practices or for any other requirement,\nthe following procedure may be adopted:\n\u2022 The loss on revaluation of assets has to be booked in the bank's Profit & Loss\nAccount.\n\u2022 Besides the provisioning requirement as per Asset Classification, banks should treat\nthe full amount of the Revaluation Gain relating to the corresponding assets, if any, on\naccount of Foreign Exchange Fluctuation as provision against the particular assets.\n5.8.10 Provisioning for country risk\nBanks shall make provisions, with effect from the year ending 31 March 2003, on the net\nfunded country exposures on a graded scale ranging from 0.25 to 100 percent according to\nthe risk categories mentioned below. To begin with, banks shall make provisions as per the\nfollowing schedule:\nRisk category ECGC\nclassificationProvisioning requirement\n(per cent)\nInsignificant A1 0.25\nLow A2 0.25\nModerate B1 5\nHigh B2 20\nVery high C1 25\nRestricted C2 100\nOff-credit D 100RBI_MC_IRAC_200332\nFor the present, only in respect of the country, where a bank\u2019s net funded exposure is 2 per\ncent or more of its total assets, the bank is required to make provision for dealing with that\ncountry risk exposure.\nThe provision for country risk shall be in addition to the provisions required to be held\naccording to the asset classification status of the asset. In the case of \u2018loss assets\u2019 and\n\u2018doubtful assets\u2019, provision held, including provision held for country risk, may not exceed\n100% of the outstanding.\nBanks may not make any provision for \u2018home country\u2019 exposures i.e exposure to India. The\nexposures of foreign branches of Indian banks to the host country should be included.\nForeign banks shall compute the country exposures of their Indian branches and shall hold\nappropriate provisions in their Indian books. However, their exposures to India will be\nexcluded.\nBanks may make a lower level of provisioning (say 25% of the requirement) in respect of\nshort-term exposures (i.e. exposures with contractual maturity of less than 180 days).\n5.8.11 Provisioning norms for sale of financial assets to Securitisation Company ( SC) /\nReconstruction company (RC) \u2013\n(i) If the sale of financial assets to SC/RC, is at a price below the net book value\n(NBV) ( i.e. book value less provisions held) , the shortfall should be debited to\nthe profit and loss account of that year.\n(ii) If the sale is for a value higher than the NBV, the excess provision will not be\nreversed but will be utilized to meet the shortfall/loss on account of sale of other\nfinancial assets to SC/RC.\n(iii) With a view to enabling banks to meet the shortfall , if any, banks are advised to\nbuild up provisions significantly above the minimum regulatory requirements for\ntheir NPAs, particularly for those assets which they propose to sell to\nsecuritisation/reconstruction companies.\n6. WRITING-OFF OF NPAS\n6.1 In terms of Section 43(D) of the Income Tax Act 1961, income by  way of interest in\nrelation to such categories of bad and doubtful debts as may be prescribed having regard to\nthe guidelines issued by the RBI in relation to such debts, shall be chargeable to tax in the\nprevious year in which it is credited to the bank\u2019s profit and loss account or received,\nwhichever is earlier.\n6.2 This stipulation is not applicable to provisioning required to be made as indicated above.\nIn other words, amounts set aside for making provision for NPAs as above are not eligible for\ntax deductions.\n6.3 Therefore, the banks should either make full provision as per the guidelines or write-off\nsuch advances and claim such tax benefits as are applicable, by evolving appropriate\nmethodology in consultation with their auditors/tax consultants. Recoveries made in such\naccounts should be offered for tax purposes as per the rules.RBI_MC_IRAC_200333\n6.4 Write-off at Head Office Level\nBanks may write-off advances at Head Office level, even though the relative advances are\nstill outstanding in the branch books. However, it is necessary that provision is made as per\nthe classification accorded to the respective accounts. In other words, if an advance is a loss\nasset, 100 percent provision will have to be made therefor.\n---xxx---Annexure I\nReporting Format for Non-Performing\nAssets  \u2013  Gross  and  Net  Position\n[Vide paragraph 3.5]\nName of the Bank:\nPosition as on \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n(Rupees in crore up to two decimals)\nParticulars Amount\n1.

No. Ret. BC. 14/12.01.001/2003-04\nAugust 21 , 2003\nTo all Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(Excluding RRBs and LABs)\nDear Sir,\nComputation of Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) for the purpose of maintenance\nof CRR/SLR\nIt has been observed that the scheduled commercial banks are not following a uniform practice in\nreckoning their liability in respect of arrangements with correspondent banks for remittance\nfacilities and disbursement of interest/dividend warrants. Under both the arrangements, there is a\ntransfer of funds by accepting bank to its correspondent bank and it is an obligation of the\ncorrespondent bank to honour the instruments. However, such transfer of funds and obligation of\ncorrespondent bank to honour the instruments in no way absolves the primary liability of the\naccepting bank issuing drafts and interest/dividend warrants to its customers. It is, therefore,\nadvised that all scheduled commercial banks should reckon the liability in the following manner:\ni) When a bank accepts funds from a client under its remittance facility scheme, it becomes a\nliability (Liabilities to Others) in its books.  The liability of the bank accepting funds will\nextinguish only when the correspondent bank honours the drafts issued by the accepting bank to\nits customers. As such, the balance amount in respect of the drafts issued by the accepting bank\non its correspondent bank under the remittance facility scheme and remaining unpaid should be\nreflected in the accepting bank's books as an outside liability and the same should also be taken\ninto account for computation of NDTL for CRR/SLR purpose.\nii) The amount received by correspondent banks has to be shown as ' Liabilities to the Banking\nSystem ' by them and not as  ' Liabilities to Others ' and this liability could be netted off by the\ncorrespondent banks against their inter-bank assets. Likewise sums placed by banks issuing\ndrafts/interest/dividend warrants are to be treated as 'Assets with Banking System' in their books\nand can be netted off from their inter-bank liabilities.\nPlease acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(R.C.Mittal)\nGeneral Manager", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/38639.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Aug 20, 2003", "info": "Export of Goods and Services\nA.P.

The 10 per cent  of the f.o.b. value shall\nbe paid by the importer in freely convertible foreign currency at the time of\nopening of the letter of credit.  Accordingly, letters of credit should specify that\n10 per cent  f.o.b. value shall be met out of the remittances from Suriname while\nthe balance 90 per cent  shall be financed from the credit.  The value of the\ncontract  should be expressed in US Dollars.\niii) All disbursements under the credit shall be made under letters of credit opened by\nthe banks in Suriname.

The considerationarrived at for takeover should provide for additional contingent liabilities, if any, that may\nhave to be taken over by the new bank.\n(ii) Notice to Constitutents .\nDue publicity should be given to the constituents of the branch by the existing bank as well as\nthe bank taking over the branch.\n(iii) Transfer of borrowal accounts\nAll issues relating to transfer of borrowal accounts of the existing branch should be sorted out\nby the banks themselves on mutually agreed terms and conditions.  The existing borrowers\nshould not be put into any disadvantage and they may be given the choice of continuing with\nthe existing bank or the new bank.\n(iv) Interest rates on existing deposits .\nThe transfer of a branch from one bank to another would lead to transfer of deposit accounts\nfrom one bank to another. Such deposits will continue to be governed by the terms of contract\nagreed to between the customer and the bank branch that is being taken over. Accordingly, the\nsame rate of interest will be payable till maturity on such transferred deposits, as was payable\nat the time of takeover of the branch. In that event the directive with regard to rate of interest\nvide paragraph 22 (c) of our Master Circular DBOD.Dir.BC.12/13.03.00/2002-2003 dated 31st\nJuly 2002 will not apply till the maturity of such deposits.\n(v)  Penalty for premature withdrawal.\nWhere depositors of the branch being taken over desire premature withdrawal of deposit\nconsequent to the transfer of business to another bank, they should be allowed to do so\nwithout imposing any penalty.\n(vi)  Consideration receivable\nThe consideration receivable by the bank will be a current business income and treated\naccordingly.\n(vii) Surrender of licenceAfter a detailed agreement is reached on transfer, the bank taking over the branch may\nforward the licence to the concerned Regional Office of RBI for cancellation and obtain a\nfresh licence prior to transfer.\n(viii) Service Area Obligation\nAt present a branch which is the only bank branch functioning at a rural centre  is not\npermitted to be shifted / closed/ merged outside the service area as this would render the\nrelative area unbanked. Consequently, in cases where the rural branch of another bank being\ntaken over is the only branch functioning in the village/town, the bank taking over the branch\nwill not be permitted to merge it with any other of its existing branch in rural/ semi- urban\narea (with service area obligation), as it would render the area unbanked .", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/38438.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Aug 18, 2003", "info": "Evidence of Import \u2013 Liberalisation\nA.P.(DIR Series) Circular No.9 (Aug 18, 2003)\nReserve Bank of India\nExchange Control Department\nCentral Office\nMumbai- 400 001\nA.P.(DIR Series) Circular No.9\nAugust 18, 2003\nTo\nAll Authorised Dealers in Foreign Exchange\nMadam/Sirs,\nEvidence of Import \u2013 Liberalisation\nAttention of authorised dealers is invited to paragraph A10.1( i) of the Annexure to A.P\n(DIR Series) Circular No.106 dated June 19, 2003 in terms of which, it is obligatory on the part\nof the authorised dealers making import remittance to ensure that the importer submits the\ndocumentary evidence of import if the value of foreign exchange remitted/paid for import into\nIndia exceeds USD 25,000 or its equivalent.\n2.

No. Dir. BC.11/13.03.00/2002-2003 dated July\n30, 2002 consolidating instructions / guidelines issued to banks till 30 June 2002 on matters\nrelating to Interest Rates on Advances.  The Master Circular has been suitably updated by\nincorporating instructions issued upto 30 June 2003 and has also been placed on the RBI\nwebsite ( http://www.rbi.org.in ).\n2. It may be noted that all the instructions contained in circulars listed  in the Appendix\nhave been consolidated.\nYours faithfully\n(M.R. Srinivasan)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nEncl: As above Master Circular on Interest Rates on Advances\n1. General\n1.1 The banks should charge interest on loans/advances/cash credit s/overdrafts or any\nother financial accommodation granted/provided/renewed by them or discount usance\nbills in accordance with the directives on interest rates on advances issued by Reserve\nBank of India from time to time.\n1.2 The interest at the specif ied rates shall be charged at monthly rests from April 1, 2002\nsubject to the conditions laid down in paragraph 11 below. The Interest to be charged\nshall be rounded off to the nearest rupee.\n1.3 Banks should club the term loans and working capital advanc es together for the\npurpose of determining the size of the loan and the applicable rate of interest.\n1.4 The schedule of rates of interest as per current directive in force is given in Annexure-\nI.\n2. Prime Lending Rate ( PLR) and Spreads\n2.1 At present,  loans upto Rs. 2 lakh carry the prescription of not exceeding the Prime\nLending Rate (PLR) and on the loans above Rs. 2 lakh, banks are free to determine\nrate of interest subject to PLR and spread guidelines. Keeping in view the\ninternational practice and to provide further operational flexibility to commercial\nbanks in deciding their lending rates, it has been decided to relax the requirement\nof PLR being the floor rate for loans above Rs. 2 lakh. Banks may now offer loans\nat below PLR rates to exporters or other creditworthy borrowers including public\nenterprises on the lines of a transparent and objective policy approved by the\nrespective Boards. Banks will continue to declare the maximum spread of interest\nrates over PLR. However, given the prevailing credit market in India and the need\nto continue with concessionality for small borrowers, the practice of treating PLR\nas the ceiling for loans upto Rs. 2 lakh will continue.\nSeparate PLRs may be fixed for short term credit and Prime Term Lending Rate\n(PTLR) for term loans of 3 years and above. The PLR/ PTLR fixed should be\ndeclared and should also indicate the maximum spread over the PLR for all\nadvances other than consumer credit. The banks could also prescribe separate\nPLRs for loan component and cash credit component and also prescribe separate\nspreads for both.\n2.2 The interest rate on credit limits of Rs. 2 lakh and below, other than consumer\ncredit, shall not exceed the Prime Lending Rate which is available to the best\nborrowers of the concerned bank.\n2.3 PLR will be made uniformly applicable at all branches of a bank.3.    Determination of Benchmark Prime Lending Rate ( PLR)\n3.1 In order to enhance transparency in banks\u2019 pricing of their loan products as also to\nensure that the PLR truly reflects the actual costs, banks may consider the following\nsuggestions for determination of their benchmark PLR:\n(a) Banks should take into account their ( i) actual cost of funds, (ii) operating\nexpenses and (iii) a minimum margin to cover regulatory requirement of\nprovisioning/capital charge and profit margin, while arriving at the benchmark\nPLR. Banks should announce a benchmark PLR with the approval of their Boards.\n(b) The benchmark PLR would be the ceiling rate for credit limit up to Rs.2 lakh, as\nhitherto.\n(c) Since all other lending rates can be determined with reference to the benchmark\nPLR arrived at as above by taking into account term premia and/or risk premia,\nthe system of tenor-linked PLR deserves to be discontinued. These premia can be\nfactored in the spread over or below the PLR.\nAs regards the effective date for discontinuation of the tenor-linked PLR, the same will be\nfurther discussed with banks and a decision will be announced separately in due course.\n3.2 Banks are also advised in the interest of the custo mer protection and to have greater\ndegree of transparency in regard to actual interest rates charged to borrowers, to\ncontinue to provide information on maximum and minimum interest rates charged\ntogether with the benchmark PLR.\n3.3 The system of determin ation of benchmark PLR by banks and the actual prevailing\nspreads around the benchmark PLR is proposed to be reviewed in September 2003.\nBanks may, therefore, advise to the Reserve Bank, the action taken on the above\nsuggestions as early as possible.\n4.  Freedom to fix Lending Rates\nBanks enjoy freedom to stipulate lending rates without reference to their own Prime\nLending Rates in respect of the following categories:\n(i) Loans covered by refinance schemes of term lending institutions;\n(ii) Interest rates on bank lending to intermediary agencies including housing\nfinance intermediary agencies (cf. list at \u2018 Annexure II\u2019);\n(iii) Bill discounting by banks;\n(iv) Advances/overdrafts against domestic/ NRE/ FCNR(B) deposits with the bank,\nprovided that the deposit/s stands/stand either in the name(s) of the borrower\nhimself/borrowers themselves, or in the names of the borrower jointly with\nanother person;\n(v) To a co-operative bank or to any other banking institution;\n(vi) To its own employees.5. Tenor Linked PLRs\nBanks have been given freedom to operate different PLRs for different maturities,\nprovided the transparency and uniformity of treatment is maintained. Banks should not\ndeclare stand-alone PLR in addition to tenor linked PLRs. The banks, which have moved\nover to declaration of tenor-linked PLRs should invariably indicate the specific tenor for\nwhich the declared PLR is applicable.\n6. Fixed Interest Rate for Loans\nBanks have freedom to offer all categories of loans on fixed or floating rates, subject to\nconformity to Asset-Liability Management ( ALM) guidelines. However, the banks should\nensure that the PLR stipulations as applicable are complied with. The nature of alignment\nwith PLR i.e. whether it is at the time of sanction or disbursement of the loan, should be\nmade explicit at the time of sanction of the loan. For small loans up to Rs. 2 lakh, the\nstipulation of 'not exceeding PLR' (for relevant maturity) should be made applicable.\n7.    Levying of penal rates of interest\nSince the Boards of the banks have been empowered to decide the Prime Lending Rate ( PLR)\nas also the spread over PLR, it has been decided with effect from 10 October 2000, that banks\nmay formulate transparent policy for charging penal interest with the approval of their Board\nof Directors.  However, in case of loans to borrowers under priority sector, no penal\ninterest should be charged for loans up to Rs. 25, 000.  Penal interest may be levied for\nreasons such as default in repayment, non-submission of financial statements, etc. However,\nthe policy on penal interest should be governed by well-accepted principles of transparency,\nfairness, incentive to service the debt and due regard to genuine difficulties of customers.\n8. Enabling clause\n8.1 The banks are required to invariably incorporate following proviso i n the loan\nagreements in the case of all advances, including term loans, enabling banks to charge\nthe applicable interest rate in conformity with the directives issued by RBI from time\nto time.\n\u201cProvided that the interest payable by the borrower shall be subject to the changes in\ninterest rates made by the Reserve Bank from time to time.\u201d\n8.2 Since banks are bound by the Reserve Bank's directive on interest rates on loans and\nadvances which are issued under Sections 21 and 35A of the Banking Regulation Act,\n1949, banks are obliged to give effect to any revision of interest rates whether\nupwards or downwards, on all the existing advances from the date the\ndirective/revised interest rate (change in PLR and spread) come into force, unless the\ndirectives specifically provide otherwise.\n8.3 Paragraphs 8.1 and 8.2 will not be applicable in case of Fixed Rate Loans.9. Withdrawals against uncleared effects\nWhere withdrawals are allowed against cheques sent for clearing, i.e. uncleared effects (e.g.\nuncleared local or outstation cheques) which are in the nature of unsecured advances, the\nbanks should charge interest on such drawals as per the directive on interest rate on advances.\nIt may be noted that this instruction will not apply to the facility afforded to depositors for\nimmediate credits in respect of cheques sent for collection as a measure of customer service.\n10.  Loans under consortium arrangement.\nThe banks need not charge a uniform rate of interest even under a consortium arrangement.\nEach member bank should charge rate of interest on the portion of the credit limits extended\nby it to the borrower subject to its PLR.\n11. Charging of Interest at monthly rests\nThe banks were required to switchover to the system of charging interest at monthly rests\nwith effect from April 1, 2002. While switching over to the new system the banks were to\nfollow the under noted instructions in regard to switchover to the system of charging monthly\ninterest on loans and advances:\ni. Banks had option to compound interest at monthly rests effective either from\nApril 1, 2002, or July 1, 2002 or April 1, 2003.\nii. With effect from quarter beginning July 1, 2002, banks should ensure that the\neffective rate does not go up merely on account of the switchover to the system of\ncharging / compounding interest at monthly rests and increase the burden on the\nborrowers.\nIllustratively:\nIf a bank is charging in a borrower\u2019s account an interest rate of 12 percent with\nquarterly rests, the effective rate is 12.55 percent.  If the bank charges in the same\naccount an interest rate of 12 percent at monthly rests, the effective rate comes to 12.68\npercent.  Banks should, therefore, adjust the 12 percent interest rate charged to the\nborrower in such a way that the effective interest rate to the borrower does not exceed\n12.55 percent as hitherto.  Thus, in the above example, banks should charge interest at\n11.88 percent (and not 12 percent).  If this is done, the effective rate, even after\ncompounding at monthly rests will be 12.55 percent.\niii. Application of interest on monthly rests shall be restricted to all running accounts,\ne.g. Cash Credit, Overdraft, Export Packing Credit Accounts, etc.  At the time of\nchanging over to monthly rests, banks may obtain consent letter / supplemental\nagreement from the borrowers for the purpose of documentation.\niv. Interest at monthly rests shall be applied in case of all new and existing term loans\nand other loans of longer / fixed tenor .In the case of existing loans of longer /\nfixed tenor, banks shall move over to application of interest at monthly rests at the\ntime of review of terms and conditions or renewal of such loan accounts or after\nobtaining consent from the borrower.v. Since instructions contained in paragraph 11 (ii) were effective from July 1, 2002,\nin case a bank had followed a different system from one explained therein in the\nquarter ended June 30, 2002, it was not required to make adjustment for that\nquarter.\n11.2 Instructions on charging interest at monthly rests shall not be applicable to\nagricultural advances and banks shall continue to follow the existing practice of\ncharging / compounding of interest on agricultural advances linked to crop seasons.\nAs indicated in circular RPCD.No.PLFS.BC.129/ 05.02.27/97-98 dated June 29, 1998\nbanks should charge interest on agricultural advances for long duration crops at\nannual rests.  As regards other agricultural advances in respect of short duration crop\nand allied agricultural activities such as dairy, fishery, piggery , poultry, bee-keeping,\netc., banks may take into consideration due dates fixed on the basis of fluidity with\nborrowers and harvesting / marketing season while charging interest and\ncompounding the same if the loan / instalment  becomes overdue.\n12.     Zero percent Interest Finance Schemes for Consumer Durables\nBanks should refrain from offering low/zero percent interest rates on consumer durable\nadvances to borrowers through adjustment of discount available from manufacturers/dealers\nof consumer goods, since such loan schemes lack transparency in operations and distort\npricing mechanism of loan products.  These products do not also give a clear picture to the\ncustomers regarding the applicable interest rates.  Banks should also not promote such\nschemes by releasing advertisement in different newspapers and media indicating that they\nare promoting/financing consumers under such schemes.  They should also refrain from\nlinking their names in any form/manner with any incentive-based advertisement where clarity\nregarding interest rate is absent.Annexure \u2013 I\nInterest Rate Structure for rupee advances of commercial banks\nSize of limitAll advances including  Term loans\nRate of interest (Per cent per annum)\n1.(a) Upto and inclusive of Rs.2 lakh Not exceeding Prime\nLending Rate ( PLR)\n   (b) Over Rs.2 lakh Free#\n 2.

Other important features of the Scheme\n(i) The Scheme covers deposits in Pound Sterling, US Dollar, Japanese Yen and\nEURO from non-resident individuals of Indian nationality or origin ( NRIs ),\noverseas companies, firms, societies and other corporate bodies which are\nowned directly or indirectly to the extent of at least 60 per cent by NRIs  and\noverseas trusts in which at least 60 per cent of the beneficial interest is\nirrevocably held by such persons ( OCBs ).\n(ii) Repatriation of funds in foreign currencies is permitted.\n(iii) The deposits should be accepted under the Scheme for the following maturity\nperiods:\n i. One year and above but less than two years.\n ii. Two years and above but less than three years.\n iii.

The rate of interest payable on the amount of the deposit so renewed\nshould be the appropriate rate of interest for the period of renewal as prevailing on the date of\nmaturity or on the date when the depositor seeks renewal, whichever is lower.  In the case of\noverdue deposits where the overdue period exceeds 14 days and if the depositor places the\nentire amount of overdue deposit or a portion thereof as a fresh FCNR (B) deposit, banks\nmay  fix  their   own   interest  rates  for  the overdue period on the amount so placed as a\nfresh term deposit. Banks will have freedom to recover the interest so paid for the overdue\nperiod if the deposit is withdrawn before completion of minimum stipulated period under the\nscheme, after renewal.\n7.

Margin on advance against  term deposit\nA bank may determine the margin on a case-to-case basis.\n9. Interest payable on the deposit of a deceased depositor\nIn the case of a term deposit standing in the name/s of -\n(a) a deceased individual depositor, or\n(b)       two or more joint depositors, where one of the depositors has\n           died, interest should be paid in the manner indicated below :\n(i) at the contracted rate on the maturity of the deposit;\n(ii) in the event of the payment of the deposit being claimed before the\nmaturity date, the bank should pay interest at an applicable rate\nprevailing on the date of placement of the deposit, without charging the\npenalty;\n(iii) in the event of death of the depositor before the date of maturity of the\ndeposit and the amount of the deposit is claimed after the date of\nmaturity, the bank should pay interest at the contracted rate till the date\nof maturity. From the date of maturity to the date of payment, the bank\nshould pay simple interest at the applicable rate operative on the date\nof maturity, for the period for which the deposit remained with the\nbank beyond the date of maturity. However, in the case of death of the\ndepositor after the date of maturity of the deposit, the bank should pay\ninterest at a rate operative on the date of maturity in respect of savings\ndeposits held under RFC Account Scheme, from the date of maturity\ntill the date of payment;(iv) if, on request from the claimant/s, the bank agrees to split the amount\nof term deposit and issues two or more receipts individually in the\nname/s of the claimant/s, it should not be construed as premature\nwithdrawal of the term deposit for the purpose of levy of penalty\nprovided the period and aggregate amount of the deposit do not\nundergo any change.\nNote : In the case of claimant/s being residents, the maturity proceeds may be\nconverted into Indian rupees on the date of maturity and interest be paid for\nthe subsequent period at a rate applicable to the deposit of similar maturity\nunder domestic deposit scheme.\n10. Addition or deletion of name/s of joint account holders\nA bank may, at the request of all the joint holders, allow the addition or deletion of name/s of\njoint account holder/s if the circumstances so warrant or allow an individual depositor to add\nthe name of another person as a joint holder. However, in no case  the amount or duration of\nthe original deposit should undergo a change in any manner whatsoever, and all the joint\naccount holders are non-residents of Indian nationality or origin. The bank should ascertain\nthe reasons from the applicants for doing so and also satisfy themselves about the bonafide\nnature of the request. Further, opening of accounts in the names of Pakistani/Bangladeshi\nnationals though of Indian origin will require approval of Reserve Bank from the exchange\ncontrol angle.\n11.  Payment of interest on FCNR (B) deposits of NRIs on return to India\nBanks may allow FCNR (B) deposits of persons of Indian nationality/origin who return to\nIndia for permanent settlement to continue till maturity at the contracted rate of interest, if\ndesired.  Except the provision relating to rate of interest and reserve requirements as\napplicable to FCNR (B) deposits, for all other purposes, such deposits should be treated as\nresident deposits from the date of return of account holder to India. Premature withdrawal of\nsuch FCNR (B) deposits should be subject to penal provision of the Scheme. Banks should\nconvert the FCNR (B) deposits   on maturity into Resident Rupee Deposit Account or RFC\nAccount (if eligible) at the option of the account holder. The rate of interest on the new\ndeposit (Rupee account or RFC Account) should be the relevant rate applicable for such\ndeposit account.12. Conversion of FCNR (B) Accounts of the\n      Returning Indians into RFC Account - Waiver of Penalty\nPenal provision in the case of premature conversion of balances held in FCNR (B) deposits\ninto Resident Foreign Currency Accounts by Non- Resident Indians on their return to India\nwould not be applicable.\n13. Conversion of FCNR (B) Accounts of the\n      Returning Indians into RFC Accounts/\n      Resident Rupee Accounts - Payment of interest\nA bank should pay interest at its discretion at the time of conversion of FCNR (B) Account\ninto RFC/Resident Rupee Account even if the same has not run for a minimum maturity\nperiod, subject to the condition that the rate of interest should not exceed the rate payable on\nsavings bank deposits held under RFC Account Scheme.\n14.     Payment of interest on term deposit maturing on Saturday/Sunday/ holiday/non-\nbusiness working day\nIn respect of a term deposit maturing for payment on a Saturday/Sunday or a holiday or a\nnon-business working day, banks should pay interest at the originally contracted rate on the\ndeposit amount for the Saturday/Sunday/holiday/non-business working day intervening\nbetween the date of expiry of the specified term of the deposit and the date of payment of the\nproceeds of the deposit on the succeeding working day.\n15.  Prohibitions\nNo bank should -\n(a) accept or renew a deposit over three years;\n(b) discriminate in the matter of rate of interest paid on the deposits, between one\ndeposit and another accepted on the same date and for the same maturity,\nwhether such deposits are accepted at the same office or at different offices of\nthe bank, except on the size group basis. The permission to offer varying rates\nof interest based on size of the deposits will be subject to the following\nconditions:\n(1)Banks should, at their discretion, decide the currency wise minimum\nquantum on which differential rates of interest may be offered. For the\nterm deposits below the prescribed quantum with same maturity, the same\nrate should apply.\n(2) The differential rates of interest so offered should be subject to the overall\nceiling prescribed.\n(3) Interest rates paid by the bank should be as per the schedule and not\nsubject to negotiation between the depositor and the bank.(c) pay brokerage, commission or incentives on deposits mobilized under\nFCNR(B) Scheme in any form to any individual, firm, company, association,\ninstitution or any other person.\n(d) employ/engage any individual, firm, company, association, institution or any\nother person for collection of deposit or for selling any other deposit linked\nproducts on payment of remuneration or fees or commission in any form or\nmanner.Annexure-I\nInterest rates applicable to deposits accepted under Foreign Currency Non-Resident\nAccounts (Banks) Scheme\na) In respect of deposits of one year and above, interest shall be paid within the\nceiling rate of LIBOR/SWAP rates for the respective currency / corresponding\nmaturities minus 25 basis points. On floating rate deposits, interest shall be\npaid within the ceiling of SWAP rates for the respective currency/maturity\nminus 25 basis points. For floating rate deposits, the interest reset period shall\nbe six months. However, in respect of Yen deposits, banks have the freedom\nto set the FCNR (B) deposit rates which may be equal or less than LIBOR.\n (b) The LIBOR/SWAP rates as on the last working day of the preceding week\nwould form the base for fixing ceiling rates for the interest rates that would be\noffered effective the following week.\n(c) Banks would have the option to choose the current SWAP rates quoted on any\nonline screen based information system while offering FCNR (B) deposits.ANNEXURE-II\nList of directives/circulars which have been\nincorporated in Master circular on Interest\nRates on FCNR (B) Deposits\n1.DBOD No. Dir.

Government of India have launched a rationalised poverty alleviation scheme Swarna\nJayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana  replacing three existing  schemes, viz.\n(i) Nehru Rozgar Yojana ( NRY),(ii) Urban Basic Services for the Poor ( UBSP), and\n(iii) Prime Minister's Integrated Urban Poverty Eradication Programme ( PMI UPEP)\nDetailed guidelines of the new scheme have been circulated to all banks, vide RBI circular\nRPCD.SP.BC.52/09.16.01/97-98 dated November 17, 1997.\n2. The Scheme\n2.1 The scheme contains all essential features of the three schemes and is operative from 1st\nDecember 1997  in all urban towns  in India.\n2.2 SJSRY seeks to provide gainful employment to the urban poor (living below the urban\npoverty line) unemployed or under employed, through setting up of self-employment\nventures or provision of wage employment. Inputs under the scheme would be delivered both\nthrough the medium of community structures to be set up on UBSP pattern and Urban Local\nBodies ( ULBs). The scheme is to be funded on a 75:25 basis between the Centre and the\nStates.\n3. Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana consists of two special schemes, namely -\n (i). The Urban Self-Employment Programme ( USEP)\n (ii). The Urban Wage Employment Programme ( UWEP)\nAmong other components of the scheme, the following are the two components of Urban\nSelf-Employment Programme ( USEP) where credit from banks is involved:\n3.1 Urban Self Employment Programme ( USEP) - Assistance to individual urban poor\nbeneficiaries for setting up gainful self-employment ventures\n (i). Under employed and unemployed urban youth whose annual family income is\nbelow the poverty line and who have got education upto ninth standard shall be\nassisted with bank's loan and government subsidy. Projects costing upto Rs.\n50,000/- are to be financed by the bank. The Government will provide subsidy at\n15 percent of the project cost subject to a maximum of Rs. 7500/- per beneficiary\n(for individual USEP) to be tied with bank loan.\n (ii). The borrower has to bring in 5 per cent of the project cost as margin money.\nPartnerships would be permitted wherein the overall project cost will be a simple\nsum of individual project cost allowable per borrower. Such project would be\neligible for subsidy equal to the total permitted subsidy per person and each\nmember would have to bring in 5 percent of his share of project cost as margin\nmoney.\n (iii). Physical targets under the USEP of SJSRY will be decided by the State\nGovernments in conformity with the guidelines of the scheme as also the result of\nbeneficiary survey to ensure adequate flexibility of operation of the scheme.\n3.2 Development of Women and Children in Urban Areas ( DWCUA)\nThe programme envisages special incentive to urban poor women who decide to set up\nself-employment ventures in a group. Such groups may take up any economic activitysuited to their skill, training, aptitude and local conditions. DWCUA  group shall consist\nof at least 10 urban poor women, and will be entitled to a subsidy of Rs. 1,25,000/- or 50\npercent of the cost of project, whichever is less. Every effort should be made to encourage\nthe group to set itself up as a thrift and credit society.\n4 Salient features\n4.1 A house-to-house survey for identification of genuine beneficiaries should be done.\nNon-economic parameters also should be applied to identify the urban poor in\naddition to the economic criteria of the urban poverty line. Community structures like\nCommunity Development Societies ( CDS) should be involved in this task under the\nguidance of the Town Urban Poverty Eradication Cell ( TUPEC)/Urban Local Bodies\n(ULB).\n4.2 Subsidy amount under USEP/ DWCUA component of SJSRY should be treated as\nback ended.\n4.3 The percentage of women beneficiaries under the SJSRY Scheme shall not be less\nthan 30 percent. SCs/STs must be benefited to the extent of the proportion of their\nstrength in the local population. A special provision of 3 percent shall be made for the\ndisabled under the scheme.\n4.4 The loans granted under the scheme should be treated as advances under priority\nsector and accordingly the loan applications should be disposed of expeditiously\nwithin the time schedule prescribed in this regard i.e. applications for loans upto Rs.\n25,000/- within a fortnight and those for credit limits above Rs. 25,000/-, within 8 to 9\nweeks.\n4.5 The loan applications may contain a clause eliciting particulars about any loan taken\nby the applicant from any banking / financial institution of the State / Central\nGovernment and repayment particulars and balance outstanding in case such a facility\nis availed of. All particulars furnished by the applicant in the application may be\ncertified by him. Based on the information furnished by the applicant, the banks may\nconsider dispensing with production of 'No Due Certificate' as a compulsory\nrequirement, if they are satisfied about the status of the borrower, so that the delay in\nsanction and disbursement of loans could be avoided. In case the bank concerned\ndecides to verify the status of the loan account of the borrower with other banks in the\narea, it should send specific communication enclosing the list of applicants in\nduplicate requesting the other banks to send back the duplicate copy duly certified.\nThe banks receiving the reference for verification should furnish the same or provide\ndetails of its dues within a maximum period of 10 days. If no response is received\nwithin 15 days of request of verification from any bank, it may be presumed that the\nreferred bank has no dues. Further, as inter bank exchange of information is on the\nbasis of mutuality and reciprocity, service charges should not be an issue for\nfurnishing 'No due Certificate'.\n4.6 Rejection of applications - Branch Managers may reject applications (except in\nrespect of SC/ST) and such cases of rejections are to be verified subsequently by the\nDivisional / Regional Managers. In case of proposals from SCs/STs, rejection should\nbe at a level higher than that of a branch manager. Further, rejection of applications\nshould not be on flimsy grounds. The reasons of rejection may also be communicated\nto the sponsoring agency while returning the applications.\n4.7 An entrepreneur eligible for assistance under the self-employment scheme can take a\ncomposite loan upto Rs. 50,000/-  from a bank and this loan and group loans upto\nRs.3.00 lakhs  would not require a collateral/guarantee . Besides margin as also thesubsidy by the Government, the borrower would hypothecate/mortgage/pledge to the\nbank the assets created out of bank loan.\n4.8 The entrepreneurs selected under the scheme would be provided training and other\nentrepreneurial development assistance by Government. Training is a compulsory\ninput before disbursement of the loan under the scheme. This requirement may be\nwaived if a borrower has already received the training from a registered NGO /VO or\nhas learnt the activity such as cobblery , carpentry etc., or learnt the trade as an\napprentice from Private/Public registered Body and requisite certificate to that effect\nis produced from the ULB  or the private/public registered company as the case may\nbe. However, training may not be insisted upon as a pre-condition for sanctioning of\nloan in respect of activities not requiring special skill.\n4.9 Loans under the scheme will carry interest as per the directives on interest rates issued\nby Reserve Bank of India from time to time.\n4.10 A defaulter to a bank/financial institution will not be eligible for assistance under the\nscheme.\n4.11 Self-Help Groups ( SHGs) are eligible to open Saving Bank Accounts as per the\ninstructions contained in Circular DBOD.No.DIR.BC.11/13.01.08/98 dated 10th\nFebruary, 1998.\n5. Monitoring and Review\n5.1 Quarterly progress reports under the scheme may be furnished to RBI as per proforma\ngiven in Annexure (1).  The same format may also be used by bank\nbranches/controlling/zonal offices for monitoring the implementation of the scheme.\n5.2 The scheme will be monitored by the District Level Consultative Committee and the\nState Level Bankers' Committee at their periodical meetings.\n6. Clarifications -\nClarifications on points / queries raised by some of the banks are furnished below.\n6.1 SJSRY (General)\n(i) Minimum/Maximum age limit :  No age limit prescribed.\n(ii) Admissibility of subsidy :  The subsidy will be 15 percent of the project cost,\nsubject to a ceiling of Rs.7,500/- per beneficiary (for individual USEP) to be tied\nwith bank loan.\n(iii) Definition of family :  Identification of the family will have to be done on the basis\nof independent kitchen.\n(iv) Coverage:\n(a) SJSRY would be implemented in all areas falling under the jurisdiction of\nUrban Local bodies of any category, irrespective of population size.\n(b) Borrowers who have been sanctioned loan/subsidy under erstwhile SUME but\nhave not drawn the full amount will be allowed to take advantage of the\nenhanced loan/ subsidy amount under SJSRY.6.2 DWCUA Sub-Scheme\n (i). Loan component per beneficiary/group :  50 percent of the total project cost for\nthe group as a whole.\n (ii). Mode of financing of 50 percent of the project cost for DWCUA Group :  By\nbank loan, subject to provision of 5 percent as margin money for the Group as\na whole.\n (iii). Project cost per beneficiary/group :  No maximum ceiling prescribed. In cases\nwhere the DWCUA Group project cost exceeds Rs. 2,50,000/-, the project cost\nless subsidy ( Rs. 1,25,000/-) and margin money @ 5 percent of the project\ncost, would be bank loan component even if it exceeds 50 percent of the\nproject cost.\n (iv). Margin money per beneficiary/group :  5 percent of the project cost will be\ncontributed as margin money by the group as a whole.\n (v). Repayment of loan :  Same as under USEP for individual self-employment.\n (vi). Income criteria -  Each member of the Group should fulfil the urban poverty\nnorms as per official methodology as decided by the Planning Commission.\nThe beneficiaries under SJSRY will be identified on the basis of monthly per\ncapita income and not by annual family income.\n7. Administration of subsidy\n7.1 Guidelines regarding administration of subsidy under the component of USEP and\nDWCUA of SJSRY are given in Annexure (II) .\n7.2 It should be noted that the subsidy under USEP/ DWCUA component of SJSRY is to\nbe treated as back-ended subsidy. The subsidy admissible to the borrower should be\nkept in the Subsidy Reserve Fund Account borrower-wise, instead of in term-deposit\nin the name of borrower. Banks should not apply interest on the Subsidy Reserve\nFund Account. For charging interest on the loan, the subsidy amount should be\nexcluded.\n7.3 The balance lying to the credit of Subsidy Reserve Fund Account will not form part of\nDTL for the purpose of CRR/ SLR.Annexure I\nSwarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana ( SJSRY)\nName of the Bank :\nReport showing the cumulative position for the quarter ended under the USEP component of SJSRY\n(Amount Rs.Lakhs)\nName of the State/ Target No.of Total Loans Total Loans Total subsidy Loans sanctioned Loans disbursed Loans sanctioned Loans disbursed Loans sanctioned Loans disbursed Number Number\nUnion Territories applns sanctioned disbursed disbursed to SC/ST out of to SC/ST out of to women out of to women out of to disabled out of to disabled out of of applns. of applns.\nrecd. total sanction total disbursement total sanction total disbursement total sanction total disbursement pending rejected\nNo. Amt.

DBS.FID  No. C- 7 /01.02.00/2003-04\nAugust 7 ,  2003\nThe CEOs of the all-India Term Lending and Refinancing Institutions\nDear Sir,\nMaster Circular- Exposure Norms for the Financial Institutions\nAs you are aware, the Reserve Bank of India has from time to time, issued a number of\ncirculars to the FIs containing instructions on matters relating to exposure norms . In order to\nenable the FIs to have all the current instructions on the subject at one place, this master\ncircular has been prepared.\n2.  It may be noted that the instructions contained in circulars listed in Part A, as well as the\nrelevant paragraphs indicated in column 5 of Part B of the Appendix  have been consolidated\nin this master circular.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(Rajesh Verma)\nGeneral Manager-in-Charge\nMASTER CIRCULAR \u2013  EXPOSURE NORMS FOR THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n1 INTRODUCTION\nOn a review of the credit exposures of the term lending institutions in 1997, it was considered\nadvisable to prescribe credit exposure limits for them in respect of their lending to individual\n/ group borrowers. Accordingly, as a prudential measure, aimed at better risk management\nand avoidance of concentration of credit risks, it was decided in June 1997 by Reserve Bank\nof India to limit a term lending institution's exposures to an individual borrower and group\nborrowers and credit exposure norms were prescribed for them. These norms are to be\nconsidered as a part of prudent credit management system and not as a substitute for efficient\ncredit appraisal, monitoring and other safeguards. In respect of existing credit facilities to\nborrowers which were in excess of the ceilings initially prescribed, term lending institutions\nwere required to take necessary steps to rectify the excess and comply with the stipulations,\nwithin a period of one year from June 28, 1997, the date of the first circular, and to bring such\ncases to the notice of their Board of Directors.\n2 SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY\n2.1 The exposure norms are also applicable to the refinancing institutions (viz.,\nNABARD, NHB and SIDBI) but in view of the refinance operations being the core function\nof these institutions, their refinance portfolio is not subject to these exposure norms.\nHowever, from the prudential perspective, the refinancing institutions are well advised to\nevolve their own credit exposure limits, with the approval of their Board of Directors, even in\nrespect of their refinancing portfolio. Such limits could, inter alia, be related to the capital2\nfunds / regulatory capital of the institution. Any relaxation / deviation from such limits, if\npermitted, should be only with the prior approval of the Board.\n2.2 These norms deal with only the individual borrower and group borrower exposures\nbut not with the sector / industry exposures. The FIs may, therefore, consider fixing internal\nlimits for aggregate commitments to specific sectors e.g., textiles, chemicals, engineering,\netc., so that the exposures are evenly spread. These limits should be fixed having regard to\nthe performance of different sectors and the perceived risks. The limits so fixed may be\nreviewed periodically and revised, if necessary.\n2.3 These stipulations shall apply to all borrowers.  However, in so far as public sector\nundertakings are concerned only single borrower exposure limit would be applicable.\n2.4 The norms have evolved over the years and various aspects of the credit exposure\nnorms applicable to FIs are detailed in the following paragraphs.\n3. DEFINITIONS\n3.1 \u2018Capital Funds \u2019 : The total regulatory capital (i.e., Tier 1 + Tier 2 capital) of the FI,\ndetermined as per the capital adequacy norms of RBI  applicable to the FIs, as on March 31\n(June 30 in case of NHB) of the previous year, would constitute the \u2018capital funds\u2019 for the\npurpose of exposure norms.\n(The aforesaid definition of \u2018capital funds\u2019 came into force from April 1, 2002. From this\ndate, the exposure ceilings were to be monitored with reference to the revised definition of\ncapital funds as obtaining on March 31, 2002. Prior to that date, the \u2018capital funds\u2019 were\ndefined as (paid up capital + free reserves) as per the published accounts but the reserves\ncreated by way of revaluation of fixed assets, etc., were to be excluded.)\n3.2 \u2018Infrastructure Projects\u2019 / \u2018Infrastructure Lending \u2019: Any credit facility in\nwhatever form extended by the FIs to an infrastructure facility as specified below falls within\nthe definition of \u201cinfrastructure lending\u201d. In other words, it is a credit facility provided to a\nborrower company engaged in:\n\u2022 developing or\n\u2022 operating and maintaining, or\n\u2022 developing, operating and maintaining\nany infrastructure facility that is a project in any of the following sectors:\ni) a road, including toll road, a bridge or a rail system;\nii) a highway project including other activities being an integral part of the highway project;\niii) a port, airport, inland waterway or inland port;\niv) a water supply project, irrigation project, water treatment system, sanitation and sewerage\nsystem or solid waste management system;\nv) telecommunication services whether basic or cellular, including radio paging, domestic\nsatellite service (i.e., a satellite owned and operated by an Indian company for providing\ntelecommunication service), network of trunking, broadband network and internet services;\nvi) an industrial park or special economic zone ;\nvii) generation or generation and distribution of power3\nviii) transmission or distribution of power by laying a network of new transmission or distribution\nlines.\nix) Any o ther infrastructure facility of similar nature\n \n3.3 \u2018Group\u2019 Borrowers  : The concept of \"Group\" and the task of identification of the\nborrowers belonging to specific industrial groups is to be based on the perception of the FIs.\nFIs are, it is observed, generally aware of the basic constitution of their clientele for the\npurpose of regulating their exposure to risk assets. The group to which a particular borrowing\nunit belongs may, therefore, be decided by them on the basis of the relevant information\navailable with them, the guiding principle in this regard being commonality of management\nand effective control.\n3.4 Net Owned Funds in respect of NBFCs  : Net owned Fund will consist of paid up\nequity capital, free reserves, balance in share premium account and capital reserves\nrepresenting surplus arising out of sale proceeds of assets but not reserves created by\nrevaluation of assets. From the aggregate of items will be deducted accumulated loss balance\nand book value of intangible assets, if any, to arrive at owned funds. Investments in shares of\nother NBFCs and in shares, debentures of subsidiaries and group companies in excess of ten\npercent of the owned fund mentioned above will be deducted to arrive at the Net Owned\nFund. The NOF should be computed on the basis of last audited Balance Sheet and any\ncapital raised after the Balance Sheet date should not be accounted for while computing NOF.\n4. PRUDENTIAL NORMS\n4.1 Exposure Ceilings\n4.1.1 For single / individual borrowers:\nThe credit exposure to single borrowers shall not exceed 15 per cent of capital funds\nof the FI. However, the exposure may exceed by additional five percentage points\n(i.e., up to 20 per cent) provided the additional credit exposure is on account of\ninfrastructure projects.\n4.1.2 For group borrowers\nThe credit exposure to the borrowers belonging to a group shall not exceed 40 per\ncent of capital funds of the FI. However, the exposure may exceed by additional ten\npercentage points (i.e., up to 50 per cent) provided the additional credit exposure is on\naccount of infrastructure projects.\n[The exposure ceilings stipulated initially in 1997 were 25 per cent and 50 per cent of\nthe capital funds of the FIs for the individual and group borrowers, respectively. In\nSeptember 1997, an additional exposure of up to 10 percentage points for the group\nborrowers (i.e., up to 60 per cent) was permitted provided the additional credit\nexposure was on account of infrastructure projects (which at that time were narrowly\ndefined as only power, telecommunication, roads and ports). In November 1999, with\na view to moving closer to the international standard of 15 per cent exposure ceiling,\nthe individual borrower exposure ceiling was reduced, with effect from April 1, 2000,4\nfrom 25 per cent to 20 per cent of capital funds. The FIs which had, as on October 31,\n1999, exposures in excess of the reduced limit of 20 per cent, were permitted to\nreduce their exposures to the level of 20 per cent latest by October 31, 2001.  In June\n2001, the exposure ceilings for the individual and group borrowers were reduced from\n20 per cent and 50 per cent to 15 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, with effect\nfrom April1, 2002 , but the additional exposure in respect of group borrowers, of up to\n10 percentage points on account of infrastructure projects was continued. In February\n2003, an additional exposure of up to five percentage points (i.e., up to 20 per cent) on\naccount of infrastructure projects was permitted in respect of individual borrowers\nalso.]\n4.1.3 For bridge  loans / Interim finance\nWith effect from January 23, 1998, the restriction on grant of bridge loans by the FIs\nagainst expected equity flows / issues has been lifted. Accordingly FIs may\nhenceforth grant bridge loan / interim finance to companies other than NBFCs against\npublic issue of equity whether in India or abroad, for which appropriate guidelines\nshould be laid down by the Board of the Financial Institution, as prescribed by RBI.\nHowever, FIs should not grant any advance against Rights issue irrespective of the\nsource of repayment of such advance.\nFIs may sanction bridge loans to companies for commencing work on projects\npending completion of formalities only against their own commitment and not against\nloan commitment of any other FIs/ Banks. However, FIs may consider sanction of\nbridge loan / interim finance against commitment made by a financial institution and /\nor another bank only in cases where the lending institution faces temporary liquidity\nconstraint, subject to certain conditions prescribed by RBI.\nThese restrictions are also applicable to the subsidiaries of FIs for which FIs are\nrequired to issue suitable instructions to their subsidiaries.\n4.1.4 Working capital finance\nThere is no objection to FIs extending working capital finance on a very selective\nbasis to borrowers enjoying credit limits with banks, whether under a consortium or\nunder a multiple banking arrangement, when the banks are not in a position to meet\nthe credit requirements of the borrowers concerned on account of temporary liquidity\nconstraints. The FIs should take into account these guidelines while granting short\nterm loans to borrowers enjoying credit limits with banks on a consortium basis. In\ncase of borrowers whose working capital is financed under a multiple banking\narrangement, the FI should obtain an auditor's certificate indicating the extent of funds\nalready borrowed, before considering the borrower for further working capital\nfinance.\n4.1.5 Revolving underwriting facility\nFIs should not extend Revolving Underwriting Facility to Short Term Floating Rate\nNotes/ Bonds or Debentures issued by corporate entities.\n4.1.6 Lending to Non Banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs)5\nWith effect from May 21, 1997 the quantitative limits in the form of multiples of Net\nOwned Funds have been removed in respect of aggregate lending by all FIs taken\ntogether for Equipment Leasing & Hire Purchase Companies and Loan & Investment\nCompanies which have complied with Reserve Bank's requirement of registration,\ncredit rating and prudential norms and have been so certified by the Reserve Bank.\nThe overall ceiling for borrowing ( upto ten times of NOF) has also been removed for\nequipment and hire purchase NBFCs which meet the aforesaid three criteria and are\nalso certified by the RBI. However such lending would be subject to compliance with\nsingle and group borrower exposure norms.\nFor NBFCs  which have not complied with the above requirements and the Residuary\nNon Banking Companies ( RNBCs), overall limit of aggregate credit from all FIs\ntaken together is furnished below:\nSr\nNo.Category of Financial Companies Over all Ceiling on Borrowings from\nall the FIs taken together\nEquipment Leasing (EL) and Hire Purchase\n(HP) Finance Companies\na) Registered EL/HP Companies complying\nwith Credit Rating requirement and\nprudential normsNo ceiling except in respect of Inter\nCorporate Deposits ( ICDs) subscribed\nto by FIs which should not be more\nthan 2 times the NOF\nb) Registered EL/HP companies complying\nwith either credit rating requirement or the\nprudential normsTen times the NOF with a sub-ceiling\nof 2 times of NOF for ICDs\nc)Registered EL/HP companies complying\nwith neither the credit rating nor the\nprudential normsSeven times the NOF with a sub-ceiling\nof 2 times of NOF for ICDsA\nd) All other EL/HP Companies Five times the NOF with a sub-ceiling\nof 1 times of NOF for ICDs\nLoan and Investment Companies\na) Registered Loan and investment\nCompanies complying with Credit Rating\nrequirement and prudential normsTwo times the NOF with a separate\nceiling of 2 times the NOF for ICDs\nb) Registered Loan and investment\nCompanies complying with either Credit\nRating requirement or prudential normsEqual to NOF with a separate ceiling of\n2 times the NOF for ICDs\nc) Registered Loan and investment\nCompanies complying with neither Credit\nRating requirement nor prudential norms40 % of NOF with a separate ceiling of\n2 times the NOF for ICDsB\nd)All other Loan and Investment Companies 40 % of NOF with a separate ceiling of\nequal to NOF for ICDs\nC Residuary Non Banking Companies Equal to NOF\nFls are also advised that finance by them shall not be provided to NBFCs for the following\nactivities:6\na) Bills discounted/rediscounted by NBFCs except those arising from sale of commercial\nvehicles including light commercial vehicles subject to normal lending safeguards.\nb) Investments made by NBFCs in shares, debentures, etc., of a current nature (i.e.\nstock-in-trade);\nc) Investments of NBFCs in and advances to subsidiaries, group companies or other\nentities, and\nd) Investments of NBFCs in, and inter-corporate loans/deposits to/ in other companies.\nFurther, it is advised that Fls should not sanction bridge loans and loans of a bridging nature\nin any form to any category of NBFCs (Including RNBCs) including against capital/\ndebenture issues.\n4.2 Level of Exposure\n4.2.1 The sanctioned limits or outstandings whichever is higher shall be reckoned, in respect of the funded as\nwell as non-funded facilities, for arriving at the level of exposure. The   \u201ccredit exposure\u201d shall include funded\nand non-funded credit limits, underwriting and other similar commitments. The exposure on account of\nderivative products should also be reckoned for the purpose.\n4.2.2 In case of term loans, however the level of exposure may be reckon ed on the basis of actual\noutstandings plus undisbursed or undrawn commitments. However, in cases where disbursements are yet to\ncommence, the level of exposure should be reckoned on the basis of the sanctioned limit or the extent up to\nwhich the FI has entered into commitments with the borrowing companies in terms of the agreement.\n(Since the inception of the exposure norms, only 50 per cent of the non-funded limits were required to be\nreckoned for arriving at the level of exposure. However, with effect from April 1, 2003, in tune with the\ninternational practice, the funded as well as non-funded exposures are required to be reckoned at 100 per cent\nvalue.)\n4.2.3 For the purpose of determining the level of exposure, the following instruments\nshould also be reckoned:\n(i) Bonds and Debentures in the nature of advance :  The bonds and\ndebentures should be treated in the nature of advance when :\n\u2022 The debenture / bond is issued as part of the proposal for project finance\nand the tenor of the bond / debenture is for three years and above.\nand\n\u2022 The FI has a significant stake (i.e. 10% or more) in the issue\nand\n\u2022 The issue is a part of private placement i.e. the borrower has approached\nthe FI, and not part of a public issue where the FI has subscribed in\nresponse to an invitation.\n(ii) Preference Shares in the nature of advance  : The preference shares, other\nthan convertible preference shares , acquired as part of project financing and\nmeeting the criteria as at ( i) above.7\n(iii) Deposits :  The deposits placed by the FIs with the corporate sector .\n4.2.4  For computing the level of exposure in respect of the NBFCs, the FI\u2019s investment in\nthe privately placed debentures should be included while those acquired in the secondary\nmarket should be excluded.\n4.2.5 Measurement of exposure in derivative products : With effect from April 1, 2003,\nthe FIs are required to include in the non-funded credit limit, the forward contracts in foreign\nexchange and other derivative products like currency swaps, options, etc at their replacement\ncost in determining the individual / group borrower exposures, as per the following\nguidelines.\n4.2.5.1 Methodology for calculation of replacement cost\nThere are two methods for measuring the credit risk exposure inherent in derivatives, as\ndescribed below.\nA. The original exposure method\nUnder this method, which is a simpler alternative,  the credit risk exposure of a derivative\nproduct is calculated at the beginning of the derivative transaction by multiplying the notional\nprincipal amount with the prescribed credit conversion factors.  The method, however, does\nnot take account of the ongoing market value of a derivative contract, which may vary over\ntime. In order to arrive at the credit equivalent amount under this method, an FI should apply\nthe following credit conversion factors to the notional principal amounts of each instrument\naccording to the nature of the instrument and its original  maturity:\nCredit Conversion Factor to be applied to\nNotional Principal Amount Original  Maturity\nInterest Rate\nContractExchange Rate\nContract\nLess than one year 0.5 % 2.0%\nOne year and less than two years 1.0% 5.0 % (2 % + 3 %)\nFor each additional year 1.0% 3.0 %\nB. The current exposure method\nUnder this method, the credit risk exposure / credit equivalent amount of the derivative products is computed\nperiodically on the basis of the market value of the product to arrive at its current replacement cost. Thus, the\ncredit equivalent of the off-balance sheet interest rate and exchange rate instruments would be the sum of the\nfollowing two components:\n(a) the total 'replacement cost'  - obtained by \"marking-to-market\" of all the\ncontracts with positive value (i.e. when the FI has to receive money from the\ncounterparty); and\n(b) an amount for ' potential future exposure'  - calculated by multiplying the\ntotal notional principal amount of the contract by the following credit\nconversion factors according to the residual maturity of the contract:8\nConversion Factor to be applied on\nNotional Principal Amount Residual Maturity\nInterest Rate Contract Exchange Rate Contract\nLess than one year Nil 1.0 %\nOne year and over 0.5% 5.0 %\nUnder the current exposure method, the FIs should mark to market the derivative products at least on a\nmonthly basis  and they may follow their internal methods for determining the marked-to-market value of the\nderivative products. However, the FIs would not be required to calculate potential credit exposure for single\ncurrency floating / floating interest rate swaps . The credit exposure on these contracts would be evaluated\nsolely on the basis of their mark-to-market value.\n4.2.5.2 The FIs are encouraged to follow, with effect from April 1, 2003, the Current Exposure Method ,\nwhich is an accurate method of measuring credit exposure in a derivative product, for determining individual /\ngroup borrower exposures. In case an FI is not in a position to adopt the Current Exposure Method, it may\nfollow the Original Exposure Method.  However, its endeavour should be to move over to Current Exposure\nMethod in course of time.\nNote: Under the extant capital adequacy norms, the credit exposure of the FIs in derivative products\nalso gets reflected in the risk-weighted value of the off-balance sheet items in the CRAR computation,\nfor which the 'original exposure method' has been prescribed under the capital adequacy norms.  The\nFIs are, however, encouraged to adopt, with effect from April 1, 2003, the Current Exposure Method\nfor computation of CRAR also.\n5. EXPOSURE IN RESPECT OF BONDS GUARANTEED BY PUBLIC FINANCIAL\nINSTITUTIONS (PFIS)\nThe investments made by the banks in the bonds and debentures of corporates which are\nguaranteed by a PFI listed in the Annexure , will be treated as an exposure of the bank on the\nPFI and not on the corporate. Guarantees issued by a PFI to the bonds of the corporates will\nbe treated as an exposure of the PFI to the corporate whereas the exposure of the bank on the\nPFI guaranteeing the corporate bond will be to the extent of 100 per cent of the bank\u2019s\ninvestment. Initially, such exposures of the PFI to the corporate were required to be reckoned\nto the extent of 50 per cent of the value of such guarantees, being non-funded exposure, but\nwith effect from April 1, 2003, such exposure are also required to be reckoned at 100 per cent\nof the value of such guarantees.\nThe PFIs are also required to take into account the overall exposure of the guaranteed unit to\nthe financial system before guaranteeing the bonds / debentures.\n6. TREATMENT OF LOANS GRANTED BY THE FIS AGAINST THE GUARANTEE OF BANKS\nIn terms of RBI instructions vide Circular IECD.No ./08.12.01/ 2001-02 dated February 20,\n2002, banks have been permitted to extend guarantees in respect of infrastructure projects\nin favour of other lending institutions provided the bank issuing the guarantee takes a funded\nshare in the infrastructure project at least to the extent of five per cent of the project cost and\nundertakes normal credit appraisal, monitoring and follow up of the project. For the purpose\nof exposure norms, the entire loan transaction should be reckoned as an exposure on the\nborrowing entity and not on the bank guaranteeing the loan, so as to correctly reflect the\ndegree of credit concentration. In case the funded facility is by way of a term loan, the level\nof exposure should be reckoned, as indicated below:9\n\u2022 Before commencement of disbursement, the exposure would be the sanctioned\nlimit or the extent up to which the FI has entered into commitment with the\nborrowing entity in terms of the agreement, as the case may be;\n\u2022 After commencement of disbursement, the exposure would be the aggregate of\nthe outstanding amount plus the undisbursed or undrawn commitment.\n7 REPORTING SYSTEM\nAn annual review of the implementation of exposure management measures may be placed\nbefore the Board of Directors before the end of June every year. A copy of  the review may\nbe furnished  for information to the Chief General Manager, Financial Institutions Division,\ndepartment of banking Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, \u201cThe Arcade\u201d,\nWorld Trade Centre, Cuffe Parade, Colaba, MUMBAI \u2013 400 005.   \nANNEXURE\n (Cf.

In the light of the comments received, and the views expressed at the meeting held\nwith the select FIs on December 20, 2002, we have reviewed the guidelines and the final\nguidelines are enclosed. The guidelines should be implemented with effect from the year\ncommencing from April 1, 2003  (July 1, 2003 in case of National Housing Bank - NHB).\n2. The supervisory framework for consolidated supervision of the FIs comprises the\nfollowing three components:\n(a) consolidated financial statements ( CFS);\n(b) consolidated prudential returns (CPR); and\n(c) application of prudential regulations like capital adequacy, large exposures and\nliquidity gaps on group-wide basis.\n2.1 The CFS are public documents to be prepared and published annually,  in addition to\nthe solo annual reports of the FIs and their subsidiaries published separately at present, and\nsubmitted to RBI within one month  of the publication of its annual accounts. While the\npublication of the CFS as per the Accounting Standard (AS) 21 of the Institute of Chartered\nAccountants of India ( ICAI ) has already become mandatory for the listed FIs in terms of the\nListing Agreement, the guidelines seek to make such publication mandatory even by the non-\nlisted FIs, from the financial year commencing from April 1, 2003 onwards.\n2.2 The CPR are a set of two off-site returns viz., CPR-1 and CPR-2, to be submitted to\nRBI, initially at half-yearly intervals, for the period ending September 30 ,  2003 onwards.\nThe CPR may be submitted by the FIs to the Financial Institutions Division except in case of\nthe FIs which have a bank in the group  - in which case the CPR may be sent to the Chief\nGeneral Manager, OSMOS  Division, Department of Banking Supervision, Central Office,\nReserve Bank of India, Centre I, World Trade Centre, Colaba , Cuffe  Parade, Mumbai - 400\n005. The first set of CPR  for the half-year ending September 30, 2003 (December 31, 2003 in\ncase of NHB) may be submitted to the RBI at the earliest but  not later than December 31,\n2003 (March 2004 in case of NHB) .  The CPR for the subsequent periods should be\nsubmitted within 90 days  of the close of the half-year to which the CPR relates.\n2.3 As a part of  implementation of consolidated supervision, it has also been decided to\nprescribe  the group-wide prudential norms  for capital adequacy and large exposures for the\nFIs. The FIs should ensure compliance with these norms, on an ongoing basis from the year\ncommencing from April 1, 2003 (July 1, 2003 in case of NHB ), taking into account the\nassets and liabilities of their subsidiaries / associates also, in addition to compliance by the FIs2\n/subsidiaries / associates with the prudential norms that may be applicable to them, on solo\nbasis. The prudential norms for group-wide capital adequacy, large exposure and the liquidity\nmismatches would be as indicated below and would apply in addition to  the solo prudential\nnorms applicable to the parent FIs/ subsidiaries.\n2.3.1 Capital adequacy\nThe FIs should maintain, on a group-wide basis , a minimum Capital to Risk-weighted Assets\nRatio ( CRAR) of nine per cent  on an ongoing basis from the year commencing from April\n1, 2003  (July 1, 2003 in case of NHB). The group-wide regulatory capital for the purpose of\nCPR should be determined keeping in view the guidelines detailed at para 4.2 of Appendix -\nB.\n2.3.2 Large Exposures\nAs a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of\ncredit risks, in addition to prudential limits on exposure of the solo entities, the FIs at the\ngroup-wide level  should also adhere to the following prudential limits, on an ongoing basis\nfrom the year beginning April 1, 2003 (July 1, 2003 in case of NHB ):\n15% of capital funds of the Group Single borrower exposures at the\ngroup level\nUpto 20% of capital funds of the Group provided the additional\nexposure of up to five percentage points is for the purpose of\nfinancing infrastructure projects\n40% of capital funds of the Group Group borrower exposures at the\ngroup level\nUpto 50% of capital funds of the Group provided the additional\nexposure of up to 10 percentage points is for the purpose of\nfinancing infrastructure projects\nThe 'capital funds' of the Group for the purpose of exposure norms would be the same as\nreckoned for the purpose of group-wide capital adequacy. The measurement of credit\nexposure at the group level should be done in the same manner as prescribed for the FIs on a\nsolo basis.\n2.3.3 Liquidity mismatch\nWith effect from the year beginning April 1, 2003 (July 1, 2003 in case of NHB ) the\nprudential limits for negative liquidity mismatches at the group level  in the first two time\nbands of 1-14 days and 15-28 days, would be at 10% and 15% of the aggregate group-wide\ncash outflows in these time buckets . The compilation of the group-wide liquidity gap report\nshould be done as per the extant ALM Guidelines applicable to the FIs on solo basis.\nHowever, the intra-group transactions and exposures should be excluded from this\nconsolidation . The monitoring of the liquidity gaps should, therefore, be ensured at the group-\nwide level also, in addition to the monitoring for the parent FI at the solo level.\n3.  The guidelines for the consolidated supervisory framework, as applicable to the select\nall-India financial institutions, are furnished in the Annexure  and the guidelines for\ncompilation of CFS and CPR are furnished at Appendix A  and Appendix B,  respectively.3\n4. It is clarified that the requirement of transfer of 20 per cent of net profits  to Reserve\nFund [in terms of Section 45- IC(1) of the RBI Act] in respect of the FIs which are structured\nas companies, would continue to be in relation to the solo profit of the parent FI and of each of\nthe NBFCs, if any, within the group, and not with reference to the consolidated net profit of\nthe group.\n5. This Circular may please be placed before the Board of Directors of your instituti on at\nits ensuing meeting and appropriate steps taken for implementation.\n6. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(S. S. Gangopadhyay)\nChief General Manager\nANNEXURE\nGuidelines for Consolidated Supervision of\n the select all-India Financial Institutions\nThe consolidated supervision of financial intermediaries has acquired special significance in\nthe Indian context due to the emergence of complex group structures. In such structures, a\nsupervised entity might belong to a Group headed by a holding / parent entity which in turn\nmight also have several other subsidiaries and affiliates \u2013 some of which might not even be\nsubject to a formal regulation / supervision. The primary objective of consolidated supervision\nis to evaluate the strength of an entire Group taking into account all the risks (including those\narising from the operations of related entities) that may affect the supervised entity  in the\nGroup \u2013 regardless of whether these risks are carried in the books of the supervised entity or\nthe entities related to it. It needs being emphasised  that the purpose of consolidated\nsupervision is not to supervise each and every entity within a group but to supervise the\nregulated entity as a part of the Group , so as to take into account the likely risks that may\narise from various parts of the Group for the supervised entity.  Failure of large and\nestablished international banks in the past on account of the operations of their subsidiaries\nillustrates the magnitude of such risks, which has heightened the supervisory concerns.\n2. In this background, the RBI had set up a multi-disciplinary \u201c Working Group on\nConsolidated Accounting and Other Quantitative Methods to Facilitate Consolidated\nSupervision \u201d under the Chairmanship of Shri Vipin  Malik , formerly Director, Central Board\nof RBI in November 2000 for examining the feasibility of introducing consolidated\naccounting and other quantitative methods to facilitate consolidated supervision and to make\nrecommendations accordingly. The Working Group, which had detailed deliberations with the\nrepresentatives of select FIs as well, submitted its report in December 2001 \u2013 which can be\naccessed at the RBI web site www.rbi.org.in. The recommendations of the Working Group\nwere examined in the RBI and it has been decided to implement them with appropriate\nmodifications, wherever considered necessary, in respect of the select all-India financial\ninstitutions also. The following guidelines have accordingly been formulated for effecting\nconsolidated supervision of the FIs.\n3. Definitions:4\n3.1 For the purpose of these guidelines, the terms ' parent ', 'subsidiary ' and ' group ' would\nhave the same meaning as ascribed to them in the Accounting Standard 21 (AS-21) of the\nInstitute of the Chartered Accountants of India ( ICAI).\n3.2 The term ' associate ' would have the same meaning as ascribed to it in the AS-23 of the\nICAI.\n3.3 For the purpose of compiling the CPR, which requires consolidation of subsidiaries\nand associates engaged only in 'financial activities', the activities listed illustratively  in\nAppendix B-3  would be deemed to be the \u201c financial activities\" .\n4. Scope\nFor the present, consolidated supervision would be implemented for all the groups where the\nparent (i.e., the holding / controlling entity) is an institution which falls within the regulatory /\nsupervisory domain of the RBI.    Accordingly, these guidelines would be applicable to the\nnine FIs which, at present, are regulated and supervised by this Division as all-India financial\ninstitution, viz., IDBI, IFCI Limited, TFCI Limited, IIBI Limited, IDFC Limited, EXIM Bank,\nNHB, NABARD and SIDBI.\n5. Elements of consolidated supervision\nThe consolidated supervision as implemented by the RBI, includes the following elements:\na) Consolidated Financial Statements [CFS] , which are intended for public disclosure\nfor market discipline.\nb) Consolidated Prudential Returns [CPR]  for supervisory assessment of risks which\nmay be transmitted to the FIs (or other supervised entities) by other group\nmembers.\nc) Application of certain prudential regulations like capital adequacy, large\nexposures ,  etc. on group-wide basis.\nThe guidelines for compilation of CFS and CPR, as also the reporting format of the CPR, are\nfurnished at Appendix A  and Appendix B,  respectively.\nAPPENDIX - A\nGuidance Note for Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements ( CFS)\nThe CFS should be prepared primarily in terms of the AS-21 of the ICAI keeping in view the\nfollowing aspects:\n1.1 COMPONENTS : CFS should normally include consolidated balance sheet, consolidated\nstatement of profit and loss, Notes on Accounts, other statements and explanatory material\nthat form an integral part thereof.\n1.2 EFFECTIVE DATE :  All the FIs falling within the purview of solo supervision of RBI,\nwhether listed or unlisted, should prepare and publish CFS with effect from the financial year5\ncommencing from April 1, 2003 (July 1, 2003 in case of National Housing Bank), in addition\nto the solo financial statements, published at present.\n1.3 EXTENT OF CONSOLIDATION : A parent, presenting the CFS, should consolidate the\nfinancial statements of all subsidiaries  \u2013 domestic as well as foreign, except those specifically\npermitted to be excluded under the AS-21 the ICAI. The reasons for not consolidating a\nsubsidiary should be disclosed in the CFS. The responsibility of determining whether a\nparticular entity should be included or not for consolidation would be that of the Management\nof the parent entity. In case, its Statutory Auditors are of the opinion that an entity, which\nought to have been consolidated, has been omitted, they should incorporate their comments in\nthis regard in the \"Notes to Account\".\n1.4 COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS : CFS should be prepared in terms of  AS\n-21 and other related Accounting Standards prescribed by the ICAI, viz., AS-23 relating to\n'Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements' and AS-27\nrelating to 'Financial Reporting of Interest in Joint Ventures'.\n1.5 FORMAT OF CFS: Since AS-21 does not prescribe a format for publishing consolidated\nfinancial statements, FIs should publish their CFS in the format of their respective solo\nfinancial statements . As stated above, the CFS would be in addition to the FIs\u2019 and their\nsubsidiaries' solo annual accounts prepared as per the formats prescribed under their\nrespective statutes.\n1.6 REFERENCE DATE FOR CONSOLIDATION :  The financial statements used for the purpose\nof consolidation should be drawn up to the same reporting date. When the reporting dates are\ndifferent, the subsidiary often prepares, for consolidation purposes, statement as at the same\ndate as that of the parent. When it is impracticable to do this, AS-21 permits use of financial\nstatements drawn upto different reporting dates provided the difference in reporting dates is\nnot more than six months and prescribes that adjustments should be made for the effects of\nsignificant transactions or other events that have occurred during the intervening period.\nWhere the reference dates of the accounts of the parent and its subsidiaries coincide, the FIs\nwhich are subject to the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India ( CAG ) may\npublish their CFS without waiting for the audit of the subsidiaries by the CAG , but only after\nthe statutory audit of the subsidiaries has been completed.\n1.7 ACCOUNTING POLICIES :\n1.7.1 CFS should be prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and\nother events in similar circumstances. (For the purpose, the FIs may rely on a Statement of\nAdjustments for non-uniform accounting policies furnished by the statutory auditors of the\nsubsidiaries.) If it is not practicable to do so, that fact should be disclosed together with the\nproportions of the items in the consolidated financial statements to which the different\naccounting policies have been applied.\n1.7.2  If different entities in a group are governed by different accounting norms laid down\nby the respective regulator for different businesses then, in cases where \"term lending\" or\n\"refinancing\" is the dominant activity of the group, accounting norms applicable to the parent\nFI should be used for consolidation purposes in respect of like transactions and other events in\nsimilar circumstances. In situations where no accounting norms have been prescribed by the\nregulatory authority of the subsidiary, and different accounting policies are followed by\ndifferent entities of the group, \u2018 balance of business \u2019 test may be applied for deciding the\napplicable accounting norms. The 'balance of business' test would imply that a line of business6\nor activity accounting for more than 50 per cent  of the aggregate group assets  would be\ndeemed to be the 'dominant activity' of the group, and the accounting policies / norms\napplicable to that 'dominant activity' would apply to the subsidiary for which no accounting\nnorms have been prescribed by the sectoral  regulator.  For dissimilar items and circumstances,\ndifferent accounting policies would have to be followed.\n1.8 ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS :\n1.8.1 The investments in associates  (other than those specifically excluded under AS-23)\nand subsidiaries  should be accounted for under the \"Equity Method\" of accounting in\naccordance with As-23.\n1.8.2  The valuation of investments in associates (which are excluded under AS 23) and\nunconsolidated  subsidiaries  should be done as per the investment valuation norms of RBI, as\napplicable to the FIs.\n1.8.3 The investments in joint ventures  should be accounted for under the \u2018proportionate\nconsolidation\u2019 method as per Accounting Standard 27 on \u201cFinancial Reporting of Interests in\nJoint ventures\u201d issued by ICAI.\n1.9 DISCLOSURES : The disclosures in the CFS under \"Notes to Accounts\" should be\nnormally confined to the extent required by the RBI for the parent FI on a solo basis\nsupplemented by the information already available in the solo statements of the subsidiaries.\nNo fresh / additional information need be sought from the subsidiaries for the purposes of\ndisclosures. However, the FIs may be guided by the general clarifications  issued by the ICAI\nin this regard.\nAPPENDIX - B\nGuidance Note for Preparation of Consolidated Prudential Returns (CPR)\n1. AN OVERVIEW\n1.1 The FIs falling within the scope of consolidated supervision of RBI should, in addition\nto the CFS, also prepare CPR, in the formats attached  at Appendices B-1  and B-2, for\nsubmission to RBI, as part of the off-site reporting system. The objective of the Consolidated\nPrudential Return (CPR) is to collect consolidated prudential information at the level of the\ngroup  to which the supervised institution belongs. It aims to capture data, in the prescribed\nformat, mainly on the following aspects:\na. Consolidated Balance Sheet ;\nb. Consolidated Profit & Loss Account;\nc. Select data on financial/ risk profile of the group; and\nd. Operations of subsidiaries / related entities\nTo begin with, only two half-yearly  CPR are being prescribed - CPR 1  and CPR 2 , to be\nsubmitted to RBI as at the end of March and September (June and December in case of NHB),\nwithin 90 days  of the end of the relative half-year. While the first three aspects ('a' to 'c'\nabove) would be captured in CPR 1, the operations of the subsidiaries / related entities are to\nbe reported in CPR 2. The CPR 2 is, however, to be submitted in respect of each subsidiary /\nrelated entity, separately. The reporting frequency would be reviewed and modified, if7\nnecessary, in due course. The CPR would be in addition to  the Consolidated Financial\nStatements (referred to at Appendix A) and the existing off-site returns compiled and\nsubmitted to RBI on solo basis by the FIs. In the CPR 1, apart from the consolidated balance\nsheet and the profit and loss account, four prudential parameters viz., capital adequacy, large\nexposures, forex  exposures and liquidity mismatches  are also required to be reported, on a\ngroup-wide basis , for three of which group-wide prudential norms  have been prescribed, as\ndetailed in the following paragraphs. The first set of CPR should be submitted for the half-\nyear ended September 30, 2003  (December 31, 2003 in case of NHB) not later than\nDecember 31, 2003 (March 31, 2004 in case of NHB).\n1.2 In preparation of CPR, the data to the extent applicable, may be derived from the\nconsolidated balance sheet and profit and loss account, prepared as per guidelines in Appendix\nA, also taking into account the instructions contained in the formats of the CPR and the\nconsolidated prudential norms now prescribed at Para 4 of this Appendix.\n2. DEFINITIONS :    For the purpose of CPR, the following definition would apply:\n2.1 Subsidiary : It is an entity that is 'controlled' by another entity known as 'parent'.\n2.2 Parent : It is an enterprise that has one or more subsidiaries.\n2.3 Control : It is defined as:\na)  the ownership, directly or indirectly through subsidiary( ies), of more than one-half\nof the voting power of an enterprise; or\nb) control of the composition of the board of directors in the case of a   company or of\nthe composition of the corresponding governing body in case of any other\nenterprise so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.\n2.4 Related entities : The term 'related entity' would include all such 'subsidiaries' and\n'associates', which are, controlled by the same shareholders as the FI itself.\n(For the purpose of compiling CPR, the test applied for identifying related entities is\n\u2018common control \u2019 and not only the size of the ownership stake or shareholding in the\ncontrolled entity. For consolidation in the supervisory context, the \u201crelated entity /\ncommon control approach\u201d replaces the 'subsidiary approach' of AS 21.)\n2.5 Associate : The term 'associate' would have the same meaning as ascribed to it in the\nAS-23. However, an \u2018 associate \u2019 of an FI would normally  be an entity in which the FI\nholds more than 20% but less than 50% of the paid up equity capital or voting rights in\nrespect of that entity, directly or indirectly, as on the date of the FI\u2019s last published\nbalance sheet.\n3. SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION AND REPORTING\n3.1 The FIs within the supervisory domain of RBI, which are  a parent / holding entity\nwithin the group, should submit CPR encompassing the information and assets and liabilities\nof all those \" related entities\" under their control which are engaged in \" financial activities \".\nAn illustrative list  of 'financial activities' is furnished at Appendix B-3 . For the purpose of\npreparation of CPR, the general  principles / guidelines prescribed in various Accounting\nStandards of the ICAI [viz., AS 21 ( Consolidated Financial Statements) , AS-23 ( Accounting\nfor Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements) and AS-27 ( Financial8\nReporting of Interests in Joint Ventures) ] may be used. However, the consolidation for CPR\nshould be confined to only those 'related entities' which are engaged in \" financial activities \"\n(Cf. Appendix B-3) and should exclude  group companies, which are engaged in:\n(a) insurance business (regardless of their status in the group - as parent or as related\nentity), and\n(b) businesses not pertaining to financial services.\nIn case of any doubt as to whether the financials of a particular entity need to be consolidated\nin the CPR, the FIs should consult RBI regarding the scope of consolidation.\n3.2 The FIs should justify the exclusion or inclusion of any entity for the purpose of CPR\nin Section A of the CPR 1. The valuation of investments in related entities, which are not\nconsolidated in the CPR (e.g., insurance and non-financial entities), should be done as per the\ninvestment valuation norms of RBI.\n4. Application of Group-wide Prudential Norms on consolidated position\n4.1 For the purpose of application of prudential norms on a group-wide basis, a 'group' is\ndefined as a group of entities (which might also include a licensed bank) engaged in financial\nactivities, with the FI as the parent. As a part of consolidated supervision, the prudential\nnorms/ limits, as detailed below, in the following areas have been prescribed for compliance,\non a group-wide / consolidated  basis:\na) Capital Adequacy\nb) Large Exposures\nc) Liquidity mismatches\n4.2 Capital adequacy\n4.2.1 The FIs should maintain, on a group-wide basis, an ongoing minimum Capital to Risk-\nweighted Assets Ratio ( CRAR) of nine per cent from the year commencing from April 1,\n2003  (July 1, 2003 in case of NHB).\n4.2.2 The assessment of group-wide cap ital adequacy on a consolidated basis becomes\nnecessary to obviate the phenomenon of double / multiple gearing of capital within a group -\nthat is, deployment of the same capital of the parent in several other legal entities/ subsidiaries\n('down-streaming' of capital). Some of the examples of \"double-gearing\" are furnished at\nAppendix B-4 . This could lead to situations where each entity in a group might be in\ncompliance with the solo regulatory capital prescription but at the group-level / on\nconsolidated basis there could be a capital deficit. Thus, assessment of group capital merely\non the basis of solo capital requirements of the constituents could overstate the external capital\nof the group. Hence, assessment of group capital should exclude intra-group holdings of\nregulatory capital.\n4.2.3 The group-wide CRAR, for the purpose of CPR, should be determined keeping in view\nthe following guidelines:\n(i) Where the solo regulatory capital norms for the related entities, are more stringent than\nthose for the parent FI, such norms should be treated as the regulatory minimum for\nsuch entities. The regulatory capital and the risk-weighted assets of such entities as9\ndefined by the sectoral regulator should be reckoned in computation of the group-wide\nCRAR.\n(ii) Where, however, the capital adequacy norms for the related entities at the solo level\nare non-existent or less stringent than the norms for the FIs, the norms applicable to\nthe parent FI should be applied to the related entities, as a proxy for solo norms, for\ncomputing the capital adequacy ratio at the consolidated level. Accordingly, the same\nrisk weights and credit conversion factors, as applicable to the parent FI, on a solo\nbasis, under the extant capital adequacy norms, should be notionally applied to the\nassets and the off-balance sheet items of the related entities of the FI.\n(iii) The group-wide risk-weighted assets ( RWAs) should be arrived at by adding the\nRWAs of the parent FI with that of the related entities as computed in the manner\nindicated at ( i) and (ii) above;\n(iv) In respect of the entities at item (ii) above, the various components of capital/\nliabilities of the subsidiaries should be examined with reference to the same criteria as\napplicable to the parent FI, on a solo basis, under the extant capital adequacy norms,\nfor determining their eligibility for inclusion in the group-wide regulatory capital. The\nregulatory capital of the entities at item ( i) above and the eligible components in the\ncapital of the parent FI and the related entities should be added for determining the\ngroup-wide Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital;\n(v) From the group-wide regulatory capital arrived at, as per (iv) above, the following\ndeduction should be made, in equal proportion from the consolidated  Tier 1 and Tier 2\ncapital of the group:\n\u2022 the parent FIs' investments in insurance subsidiaries (as consolidation of\ninsurance subsidiaries in the CPR is not mandated);\n\u2022 accumulated losses and intangible assets, if any,  of the parent FI as also of\nthe subsidiaries;\n\u2022 the shortfall, if any, in the regulatory capital, as prescribed by the solo\nregulators, of the subsidiaries  engaged in 'financial activities', ,\n(so as to address the risk of the parent FI being called upon to meet such\ncapital shortfall);\n\u2022 shortfall, if any, in the regulatory capital in the unconsolidated entities\n(i.e., the entities which are not consolidated in the CPR but are engaged in\nthe 'financial activities'). The amount of shortfall to be deducted from group\ncapital should be proportionate to the parent's/group's equity stake in such\nunconsolidated entity( ies).\n\u2022 investments of the parent FI in entities engaged in 'financial activities',\nexceeding 20 per cent but less than 50 per cent of its own paid up equity\ncapital (as such investments are considered significant); and\n\u2022 Significant minority and majority investments by the FIs in commercial\nentities , which exceed certain materiality level. The materiality level\nshould be reckoned as 15 per cent and 60 per cent of the FI's equity capital10\nfor 'individual significant investment' and aggregate of such significant\ninvestments, respectively.\n(The investment in commercial entities would, however, not include the\nsecurities acquired by the FIs in the borrower companies as part of the\nproject financing operations or through conversion of debt).\n(vi) The group-wide CRAR should be computed with reference to the amounts arrived at\nsteps (iii) and (v) above.\nHowever, for the purpose of, computing group-wide CRAR , pro rata  share of the\nparent FI in the regulatory capital of its subsidiaries  which is in excess of the\nsubsidiary's own regulatory capital requirements, and which could be regarded as, in\nprinciple, available to support risk in the parent or in other entities in the group, should\na shortfall arise, can be recognised  in the group-wide capital adequacy assessment.\n(vii) Capital for market risk : In computation of consolidated group capital, the capital\ncharge for market risk, prescribed for the FIs, should also be taken into account. In\ncase of unregulated entities in the group or where the sectoral supervisor has not\nprescribed any capital charge for market risk for a related entity, the norms for capital\ncharge for market risk as applicable to the FI should be used as proxy for such related\nentities.\n4.3 Large Exposures\n4.3.1 As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of\nconcentration of credit risks, in addition to prudential limits on exposures of solo entities, the\nFIs at the group-wide level  should also adhere to the following prudential limits:\nSingle borrower exposures at\nthe group level15% of capital funds of the Group\nUpto 20% of capital funds of the Group provided the additional\nexposure of up to five percentage points is for the purpose of\nfinancing infrastructure projects\nGroup borrower exposures at\nthe group level40% of capital funds of the Group;\nUpto 50% of capital funds of the Group provided the additional\nexposure of up to 10 percentage points is for the purpose of\nfinancing infrastructure projects\n4.3.2 The 'capital funds' of th e Group for the purpose of exposure norms would be the same\nas reckoned for the purpose of group-wide capital adequacy. The measurement of credit\nexposure at the group level should be done in the same manner as prescribed under the extant\nexposure norms for the FIs, on a solo basis. The individual exposures (funded as well as non-\nfunded) of the entities in the group to the same counterparty should be consolidated for\ndetermining the group-wide exposure levels. However, the exposures of only those entities in\nthe group should be consolidated which are covered within the scope of consolidation for\nCPR, as detailed at para 3 above.\n4.4 Liquidity mismatch\n4.4.1 Maturity wise distribution/ analysis of assets and liabilities should be reported, on a\nconsolidated basis in the format prescribed in CPR -1, Section D, in order to reflect the11\nliquidity risk faced by the group. Separate currency-wise reports are required for the rupee and\nforeign currency denominated assets an liabilities. The prudential limits for negative liquidity\nmismatches at the group level  in the first two time bands of 1-14 days and 15-28 days, would\nbe at 10% and 15%, respectively, of the aggregate group cash outflows in the respective\ntime buckets , as also applicable to the FIs on solo basis under the extant ALM  Guidelines.\nIntra-group transactions and exposures should be excluded from this consolidation .\n4.4.2 This liquidity report may be prepared by placing all cash inflows and outflows of all\nthe entities in the group, which are covered within the scope of consolidation for CPR\npurposes, as detailed at para 3 above, in the maturity ladder according to the expected timing\nof the cash flows, following the guidelines prescribed vide Circular DBS.FID . No. C-\n11/01.02.00/1999-2000 dated 31 December 1999, as amended from time to time.\n4.4.3 The format suggested for the liquidity report is in vogue for the FIs at present and the\nreporting institutions may consolidate the liquidity gap report by putting together the\ntransactions, which are of the similar nature, following the format.\nConfidential\nAPPENDIX - B-1\nConsolidated Prudential Return (CPR) 1 WORD PDF\nConfidential\nAPPENDIX - B-2\nConsolidated Prudential Return (CPR) 2\n(To be submitted every half-year, separately for each subsidiary  / related entity )\nReport on Operations of Subsidiaries / Related Entities ( ROS)\nReporting Institution :                 \nFor the Period Ended :            31 March / 30 September 20XX\nDate of Report : \nSubsidiary/entity Code :                  Subsidiary/entity name   :\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nActivity Name :\nRegulator's Name :\nValidation Status :\nPart A - Operational Parameters (Rs. in lakhs )\nBalance Sheet Footings (Total Assets )        :\nCapital Funds*\nMinimum Capital Prescribed by Regulators (if any)\nMinimum Capital Adequacy Prescribed by Regulators (%)\nCapital Adequacy Ratio (Actual) (%)\nNotional Capital Funds**\nNotional Risk-Weighted Assets**12\nNotional Capital Adequacy Ratio** (%)\nCapital & Reserves\nTotal Deposit\nTotal Borrowings\nProfit after Tax/Return\nSurplus/(Loss) on Profit & Loss a/c carried forward\nReturn on Assets\nReturn on Equity\nLoans and Advances - Gross\nNon-performing Loans - Gross\nProvisions held against Non-performing loans\nProvisions required against Non-performing loans Investments\nTotal Investments - Book Value\nTotal Investments - Market Value\nNon-performing Investments\nProvisions held against Non-performing Investments\nProvisions required against Non-performing Investments\nContingent Liabilities\n* As defined by the entity's regulators   * *  Calculated as per note 3.5 below.\nPart B - Large Exposures and Ownership Details\nLarge Credits (Substantial Exposures exceeding 10 % of Capital Funds)\nNo. of Counterparties\nAggregate Exposure (Amount )\nAggregate Exposure (% of Capital funds)\nOwnership Summary\nInvestment in Capital by Parent Bank (Amount )\n% of Shares held by Parent Bank\n% of Total Capital held by Parent Bank (including Tie II Capital)\nNOTES :\n1.

Double and multiple gearing\nThe parent is an insurance company, which has a 100% investment in a bank, which in turn\nhas a 100% investment in a securities firm.\nInsurance Company A1 (Parent)\nLiabilities Assets\nCapital 1,000 Investments 5,000\nGeneral   reserves 500 Book value investments in Bank B1 500\nTechnical provisions 4,000\nTotal 5,500 Total 5,500\nSolvency requirement 800\nBank B 1 (Subsidiary)\nLiabilities Assets\nCapital 500 Loans 8,750\nGeneral reserves 400 Book value investments 250\nOther liabilities 8,100 in Securities B2\nTotal 9,000 Total 9,000\nSolvency requirement 800\nSecurities Firm B2 (Subsidiary)\nLiabilities Assets\nCapital 250 Investments 4,000\nReserves 250\nOther liabilities 3,50015\nTotal 4,000 Total 4,000\nSolvency requirement 400\nWilhout provisions to account for this corporate structure in measures of capital adequacy , it\nappears that solo capital requirements for the individual entities in this group are met.\nHowever, it is clear that a portion of the capital of the parent insurance company, i.e. the\namount of 500 invested in bank B 1 is levered twice, once in the parent and again in bank B1\n(double gearing). Furthermore, the amount invested by B1 in the securities firm B2 (250),\nwhich has already been levered twice, is now being levered a third time, in the securities firm\n(when capital is being levered more than twice, it is said to be an instance of multiple\ngearing).\nOn the face of it, the group has total capital and reserves of 2,900 to cover total solvency\nrequirements of 2,000. If the multiple gearing is eliminated, the adjusted capital and reserves\nreduce to 2,150 leaving a surplus of only 50 over the capital requirements of 2,000. All three\ntechniques should yield these results.\n2. Undercapitalised unregulated holding company\nAn unregulated holding company with two regulated 100% subsidiaries and the unregulated\n100% subsidiary. Both regulated entities meet their solo requirements.\nUnregulated Holding Company A1\nLiabilities Assets\nCapital 300 Book-value investment in\nOther liabilities 800 Bank B 1 800\n(long 'term loan) Insurance company B2 200\nLeasing company B3 100\nTotal 1,100 Total 1,100\nBank B1 (Subsidiary)\nLiabilities Assets\nCapital 800 Loans 900\nOther liabilities 500 Other assets 400\nTotal 1,300 Total 1,300\nInsurance Company B2 (Subsidiary)\nLiabilities Assets\nCapital 200 Investments 7,000\nGeneral-reserves 100\nTechnical provisions 6,700\nTotal 7,000 Total 7,000\nUnregulated Leasing Company B3 (Subsidiary)\nLiabilities Assets\nCapital 100 Leases 2, 000\nOther liabilities 1,900\nTotal 2,000 Total 2,000\nGroup (consolidated)\nLiabilities Assets\nCapital 300 Bank loans 900\nGeneral reserves 100 Other bank assets 400\nOther bank liabilities 3,200 Insurance investments 7,000\nTechnical provisions 6,700 Leases 2,000\nTotal 10,300 Total 10,30016\n(i) Assume the solo capital requirements/solvency margins of the regulated companies are as\nfollows:\nRequirement Actual Capital Surplus/(Deficit)\nBank B1 100 800 700\nInsurance Company B2 300 300 0\n\"Notional\" capital proxy          } 150 100 (50)\nfor the Leasing Company B3   }\n (ii) Under the building-block prudential approach , the aggregated solo capital requirements\nand proxies (B1: 100; B2 : 300; B3 : proxy of 150: Total: 550) are to be compared with the\nconsolidated capital (300 + 100 = 400). The group has a solvency deficit of 550 -400 = 150.\n(iii) Under the risk-based aggregation  method , the solo capital requirements and proxies are\nagain aggregated (550); the total requirements are compared to the sum of the capital held by\nthe parent and its subsidiaries, deducted from the amount of- the intra-group holding of capital\n[300 (parent) + 800 (B1) + 300 (B2) + 100 (B3) -1,100 (investments) = 400]. Again, the group\nhas a solvency deficit of 150.\n(iv) Under the risk-based deduction  method , in the balance sheet of the parent the book\nvalue of each participation is replaced by its surplus or deficit value, i.e. total assets minus\nliabilities and minus capital requirement/proxy of the subsidiary. The book-values of B1\n(800) ,B2 (200) and B3 (100) are replaced by the solo surplus/deficit identified under ( i): B1\n(700), B2 (0), B3 (-50).\nThe revised balance sheet of the parent holding company is then as follows:\nLiabilities Assets\nInvestments in:\nCapital -150 B1 700\nOther liabilities 800 B2 0\nB3 -50\nTotal 650 Total 650\nAgain, the result of the calculation shows a group solvency deficit of 150.\n(v) When there is an unregulated holding company, the total deduction method is not\napplicable.\n(vi) Conclusions:\nAlthough both regulated entities meet their own solo or sector solvency requirements, the\nfinancial  conglomerate on a group-wide basis is under capitalised. The explanation is\ntwofold: first, there is excessive leverage in the group, as the parent has downstreamed debt to\nits subsidiaries in the form of equity capital, and secondly there is an undercapitalised\nunregulated entity in the group.\nThe undercapitalisation of the group is a potential risk for both regulated entities. As shown in\nthe example, the undercapitalisation can be revealed by applying appropriate measurement\ntechniques for the assessment of capital adequacy at group level.\n3. Minority interests and double gearing17\nThis example shows that where minority interests are present the choice between full\nintegration and pro-rata integration can have a material effect on the assessment of group\ncapital adequacy.\nA decision has to be made, explicitly or implicitly, as to how to deal with minority interests in\nthe various entities of the group. Essentially, the question is whether to include them by using\nfull integration or to exclude them by using a pro-rata approach.\nThe example, using the risk-based aggregation method, demonstrates that full consolidation\nmay yield a less conservative result than the pro-rata approach in cases where there are\nimportant surpluses and no deficits at solo level elsewhere in the group and thus, may mislead\nsupervisors about the situation of the group.\nConsider first a regulated parent and its 100% participation in a regulated subsidiary .\nParent\nCapital 100\nCapital requirements -90\nParticipation 1 (historic cost) 40\nSOLO SURPLUS 10\nSubsidiary 1 (100%)\nCapital 40\nCapital requirement -25\nSOLO SURPLUS 15\nGroup (Parent + Subsidiary 1)\nCapital 140\n -parent 100\n -subsidiary 40\nCapital requirement -115\n -parent -90\n-subsidiary 1 -25\nParticipation (book value) -40\nGROUP DEFICIT -15\nBoth institutions (parent and subsidiary 1) comply with their respective capital requirements at\nsolo level. The assessment of capital adequacy at group level, however, reveals that there is an\nelement of double gearing, which would call for regulatory action from the parent's regulator.\nAs a result, the parent would have to increase its capital or to reduce its risk or the subsidiary's\nrisk. (Since the parent has a 100% stake in the first subsidiary, there is no difference between\nfull and pro-rata integration).\nConsider a situation where the parent also has a 60% participation in a second subsidiary with\na considerable surplus at solo level.\nSubsidiary 2 (60 %)\nCapital 100\n-parent  60\n-minority interest  40\nCapital requirements  -25\nSOLO SURPLUS  75\nThe group position would be as follows:18\nGroup (Parent + Subsidiary 1 + Subsidiary 2)\nFull Integration Pro-rata integration\nCapital 240 200\n -parent 100 100\n -subsidiary 1   40   40\n -subsidiary 2 100   60\n(60 parent's share;\n40 minority interests)\nCapital requirement  -140 -130\n-parent -90   -90\n -subsidiary 1 -25   -25\n-subsidiary 2 -25   -15\nParticipation 1(book value) -40   -40\n Participation 2 -60  -60\n (book value)\nGROUP DEFICIT 0  -30\nWhile pro-rata integration reveals a deficit at group level, full integration of the second\nsubsidiary in the group calculation reveals no deficit because the second subsidiary's surplus\ncompensates for the previous deficit at group level. This is because full integration regards\ncapital elements attributable to minority shareholders as available to the group as a whole\nunless supervisors decide to limit the inclusion of the excess capital of this subsidiary. Of\ncourse, if the second subsidiary had a capital deficit at solo level then full integration  would\nreveal  a   larger   deficit  at group  level  than pro-rata integration because full integration has\nthe effect of placing full responsibility for making good the deficit on the controlling\nshareholder (the parent).\n4. Inadequate distribution of capital\nThis example, which uses the risk-based aggregation method, illustrates, as did example 3, the\nimplications of using a full-integration or a pro-rata approach. At the same time, it shows the\napplication of a notional capital proxy to an undercapitalised unregulated entity whose\nbusiness activities are similar to those of the regulated entities.\nThe existence of solo requirements should normally prevent deficits at solo level in firms of\nthe group. In cases where one entity of the group has a solo deficit, supervisors should\nconsider whether excess capital in other firms of the group can cover such 'solo deficit. In the\nfollowing example this excess capital is needed to cover notional deficits in an unregulated\nentity:\nParent\nCapital 100\nCapital requirement 75\nParticipation 25 (historic cost)\nSubsidiary 1 (50% participation)\nCapital ' 60\n-equity . 50\n -reserves 10\n Capital requirement' 10\nSOLO SURPLUS   50\nGroup\nPro-rata aggregation Full aggregation\nCapital parent 100 100\nCapital subsidiary 30(50% of 60)   60\nCapital requirement\n    -parent -75 -75\n    -subsidiary -5(50% of 10) -1019\nParticipation -25(book value) -25\nGROUP SURPLUS 25  50\nThe surplus at group level stems exclusively from the partly-owned subsidiary. However, in\nthe event that the parent also had a participation in an undercapitalised unregulated entity, t }1e\ngroup position would bc as follows:\nUnregulated Subsidiary 2 (100% participation)\nCapital 20\n-equity 10\n-reserves 10\nNotional capital requirement -50\nNotional solo deficit -30\nGroup\nPro rata aggregation Full aggregation\nCapital 150 180\n   -parent 100 100\n  -subsidiary 1   30(50% of 60)   60\n -subsidiary 2   20(100% of 20)   20\nCapital requirements -130 -135\n  -parent -75  -75\n  -subsidiary 1     -5  -10\n  -subsidiary 2 -50  -50\nParticipation 1  -25  -25\nParticipation 2 -10  -10\nGROUP SURPLUS -15  10\nUnder the full integration approach, the surplus in subsidiary 1 is regarded as available to the\ngroup as a whole and it thus more than compensates for the deficit in subsidiary 2. The pro-\nrata approach on the other hand, only takes account of that part of the surplus in subsidiary 1\nwhich is attributable to the parent and, as shown, this is not sufficient to offset the deficit in\nsubsidiary 2 and the parent would either have to reduce its own risks, to increase its own\ncapital or to renounce to the acquisition of the second firm.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/38214.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Aug 01, 2003", "info": "Auction for sale of Floating Rate Bonds, 2011 and Government Stock of 25 years\nRef.No.IDMD.482 /08.02.30.01/2003-04\nAugust 1, 2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks excluding RRBs/\nAll State Co-operative Banks/All Scheduled Primary\n(Urban) Co-operative Banks /All Financial Institutions/\nAll Primary Dealers in Government Securities Market.\nDear Sirs,\nAuction for sale of Floating Rate Bonds, 2011 and Government Stock of 25 years\nGovernment of India have offered to sell \"Floating Rate Bonds, 2011\" vide Notification\nF.No.4 (8)-W&M/2003 dated August 1, 2003 for a notified amount of Rs.6 ,000 crore\n(nominal) by auction.

We wish to draw your attention, in particular, to the following:\na) Floating Rate Bonds 2011\ni) The Floating Rate Bonds (\"The Bonds') will be issued at par (i.e. at Rs 100.00 per\ncent) for a minimum amount of Rs.10, 000/- (nominal) and in multiples of Rs.10,\n000/- thereafter.\nii) The Bonds will be of 8 years tenure. The Bonds will be issued on August 8, 2003 and\nrepaid at par on August 8, 2011.\niii) Interest on the Bonds will be paid half yearly. The annual interest rate on the Bonds is\ncalculated by adding a 'spread'  on a variable base rate . The 'spread'  will be\ndecided in the auction  to be conducted by Reserve Bank of India and will remain\nunchanged during the currency of the Bond. The variable base rate will be the average\nrate of the implicit yields at cut-off prices emerging in the immediate previous three\nauctions of \u2018Government of India 364 day Treasury Bills\u2019 held prior to the relative\nannual coupon period. The implicit yield will be computed by reckoning 364-day\nyear.\niv) The base rate for calculation of interest for the first coupon period commencing from\nAugust 8, 2003 to August 7, 2004 as per the aforesaid formula is 4.90 per cent (please\nsee enclosed illustration).\nv) The base rate for the subsequent annual coupon periods, worked out as per the\naforesaid formula, will be announced by RBI on or before the commencement of the\nrelative coupon periods.vi) In the unlikely event of 364-day Treasury Bill auctions being discontinued during the\ncurrency of the Floating Rate Bonds, the applicable variable base rate will be the\naverage of the Yield to Maturity ( YTM ) rate prevailing for one year Govt. of India\nSecurity as on last three reporting Fridays prior to the commencement of the relative\nannual coupon period, worked out in consultation with the Fixed Income Money\nMarket and Derivatives Association of India ( FIMMDA ). This rate will be announced\nby RBI on or before the commencement of the relative annual coupon period. In case\nparticular Friday/s is/are holiday/s, the yield to maturity rates as on the previous\nworking day shall be taken.\nvii) There will be no floor or cap for the interest rate on the Floating Rate Bonds.\nviii) The auction will be conducted by using the  Uniform Price Method for Floating rate\nBonds  where bids offered up to and including the maximum spread as determined by\nthe Reserve Bank of India will be accepted. Bids quoted at spreads higher than the\nspread so determined by Reserve Bank of India will be rejected.\nb) New 25 year Government Stock\ni) The tenure of the new Stock will notionally commence from March 25, 2003. The\nStock will be repaid at par on March 25, 2028.\nii) Interest on the stock will be paid every half year on September 25 and March 25.\niii) The payment for the stock by the successful bidders in the auction will include\naccrued interest on the nominal value of the stock from the notional date of\ncommencement of the tenure of the Stock i.e. from March 25, 2003 to August 7,\n2003 at the coupon rate emerging in the auction.\niv) On the basis of bids received, the Reserve Bank will determine the minimum yield\nup to which tenders for purchase of Government Stock will be accepted at the\nauction.

DNBS. (PD). CC. No.  29  /02.01/2003-04\nAugust 1, 2003\nTo\nAll Non-Banking Financial Companies\nincluding Residuary Non-Banking Companies\nDear Sirs,\nAmendments to NBFC Regulations \u2013\nExposure to infrastructure facility\nThere have been certain developments in the recent past in the prudential standards for the\nbanking system pertaining to the period for which a        non-performing asset remains a sub-\nstandard asset or period after which a    sub-standard asset would become a doubtful asset.\nReserve Bank of India has also issued guidelines for financing of infrastructure projects by\nscheduled commercial banks and All-India Financial Institutions.\n2. In order to align the prudential norms applicable to NBFCs with those applicable to the\nbanks and FIs, particularly in relation to exposure to infrastructure projects, it has been decided\nto amend the prudential norms for NBFCs. Accordingly, the following changes are effected:\n(1) Period of Non-Performing Assets ( NPAs)\nAn asset would be classified as sub-standard asset, if it remains non-performing for a period not\nexceeding 18 months, instead of the present norm of 24 months. Also, an asset would be\nclassified as doubtful if it remains non- performing for a period exceeding 18 months instead of\npresent norm of 24 months.\n(2) Infrastructure loans\nAccordingly, in supercession of the existing RBI norms, the following norms will be applicable\nto restructuring /rescheduling / renegotiation of the terms of agreement relating to infrastructure\nloans. These norms will apply to fully or partly secured standard and sub-standard assets. In case\nthe asset is partly secured, a provision to the extent of shortfall in the security available, should\nbe made while restructuring/rescheduling/ renegotiating the asset, apart from the provision\nrequired on present value basis and as per prudential norms. The revised norms would be\napplicable to the accounts which are subjected to restructuring, etc. of terms during the current\nfinancial year and thereafter.\n(i) Restructuring or reschedulement or renegotiation\nThe NBFCs can restructure or reschedule or renegotiate the terms of infrastructure loan\nagreement as per broad policy framework laid down by their Board of Directors under the\nfollowing stages:\n(a) before commencement of commercial production;(b) after commencement of commercial production but before the asset has been\nclassified as sub-standard.\n(c) after commencement of commercial production and the asset has been classified\nas sub-standard.\nIn each of the above three stages, the restructuring, etc. of principal and / or of interest could take\nplace, with or without sacrifice, as part of the restructuring package evolved.\n(ii) Treatment of restructured standard accounts\n(a) A restructuring of the instalments  of principal alone, at any of the aforesaid first two\nstages would not cause a standard asset to be re-classified in the sub-standard category, provided\nfor restructuring, the project is re-examined and found to be viable either with the approval of the\nBoard of Directors of the company or within the policy framework laid down by the Board by a\nfunctionary at least one step senior to the functionary who sanctioned initial loan for the project.\n(b) A restructuring of interest element at any of the foregoing first two stages would not\ncause an asset to be downgraded to sub-standard category subject to the condition that the\namount of interest foregone, if any, on account of adjustment in the element of interest as\nspecified later, is either written off or 100 per cent provision is made thereagainst .\n(iii) Treatment of restructured sub-standard accounts\n(a) A sub-standard asset would continue to remain in the same category in case of\nrestructuring of the instalments of principal.\n(b) A restructuring of interest element would render a sub-standard asset eligible to be\ncontinued in the sub-standard category for the specified period of 12 months and will be subject\nto the condition that the amount of interest foregone, if any, on account of adjustment in the\nelement of interest as specified later, is either written off or 100 per cent provision is made\nthereagainst . Even in cases where the adjustment is by way of write off of the past interest dues,\nthe asset should continue to be treated as sub-standard.\n(iv) Interest adjustment\nWhere restructuring involves a reduction in the rate of interest, the interest adjustment should be\ncomputed by taking the difference between the rate of interest as currently applicable to\ninfrastructure loans (as adjusted for the risk rating applicable to the borrower) and the reduced\nrate and aggregating the present value (discounted at the rate currently applicable to\ninfrastructure loans, adjusted for risk enhancement) of the future interest payable so stipulated in\nthe restructuring proposal.\n(v) Funded interest\nOn funding of interest in respect of NPAs, if interest funded is recognized as income, should be\nfully provided for.\n(vi) Income Recognition normsThere will be no change in the existing instructions on income recognition. In other words, the\nNBFCs may recognise income on accrual basis in respect of the accounts which are classified as\na standard asset, in terms of the provisions herein above.  It is also clarified that if the\nrestructured asset was a sub-standard asset, and it becomes a standard asset after satisfactory\nperformance of 12 months, the interest can be recognized on accrual basis. However, interest\nincome on sub-standard assets should be recognized on cash basis only.\n(vii) Provisioning\nWhile the change in the norms on provisioning for NPAs  in respect of loans to infrastructure\nprojects will be prospective, the NBFCs  which are already holding provisions against such\naccounts, which may now be classified as 'standard', shall continue to hold the provisions and\nshall not reverse the same till full recovery is made against the account.\n(viii) Eligibility for upgradation of restructured sub-standard infrastructure loans\nThe sub-standard accounts subjected to restructuring, etc. whether in respect of principal\ninstalment  or interest amount, by whatever modality, would be eligible, subject to the\nsatisfactory performance during the period, to be upgraded to the standard category only after the\nspecified period, i.e. a period of one year after the date when first payment of interest or of\nprincipal, whichever is earlier, falls due.\n(ix) Conversion of   debt into equity\nIf the amount of interest due, is converted into equity or any other instrument, and income is\nrecognized in consequence, full provision should be made for the amount of income so\nrecognized to offset the effect of such income recognition.  However, provision would not be\nrequired, if the conversion of interest is into equity which is quoted. In such cases, interest\nincome can be recognized at market value of equity, as on the date of conversion, not exceeding\nthe amount of interest converted to equity.\n(x) Conversion of debt into debentures\nIn case of conversion of principal and/or interest in respect of NPAs into debentures, such\ndebentures should be treated as NPA, ab initio, in the same asset classification as was applicable\nto loan just before conversion and provision made as per norms.\n(xi) Applicability of Restructuring, etc. norms to loans other than infrastructure loans\nThe present norm that any reschedulement or renegotiation or restructuring of a loan would make\nthe asset a sub-standard asset and it can be upgraded only after 12 months of satisfactory\nperformance would continue for loans other than infrastructure loans.\n(xii) Increase in exposure limits for infrastructure related loans and investments\nThe NBFCs may exceed the concentration of credit/investment norms for single party and group\nby 5 and 10 per cent respectively if the additional exposure is on account of infrastructure related\nloans and investments. The present and revised norms are as under :\nSubject Single party GroupPresent\nnormsAddl.\nExposure for\nInfrastructurePresent\nnormsAddl.\nExposure for\nInfrastructure\nCredit\nExposure15% 5% 25% 10%\nInvestments 15% 5% 25% 10%\nCredit and\ninvestment \u2013\ncombined25% 5% 40% 10%\n(xiii) Asset \u2013 Liability management    \nThe long \u2013 term financing of infrastructure projects may lead to asset \u2013 liability mismatches,\nparticularly when such financing is not in conformity with the maturity profile of the NBFCs\u2019\nliabilities. The NBFCs would, therefore, need to exercise due vigil on their asset-liability\nposition to ensure that they do not run into liquidity mismatches on account of lending to such\nprojects.\n(xiv) Administrative arrangements\nTimely and adequate availability of credit is the pre-requisite for successful implementation of\ninfrastructure projects. The NBFCs should, therefore, clearly delineate the procedure for\napproval of loan proposals and institute a suitable monitoring mechanism for reviewing\napplications pending beyond the specified period. Multiplicity of appraisals by every institution\ninvolved in financing, leading to delays, has to be avoided and the NBFCs should be prepared to\nbroadly accept technical parameters laid down by leading public financial institutions. Also,\nsetting up a mechanism for an ongoing monitoring of the project implementation will ensure that\nthe credit disbursed is utilized for the purpose for which it was sanctioned.\n(3) Risk weights for investment in AAA rated securitized   paper\nInvestment in `AAA\u2019 rated securitized paper pertaining to the infrastructure facility would attract\nrisk weight of 50 per cent for capital adequacy purposes subject to fulfilment of the following:\n(a) The infrastructure facility should conform to the definition of lending given in the\nannexure.\n(b) The infrastructure facility should be generating income / cash flows which would ensure\nservicing / repayment of the securitized paper.\n(c) The securitized paper should be rated at least \u2018AAA\u2019 by the rating agencies and the rating\nshould be current and valid. The rating relied upon will be deemed to be current and valid\nif the rating is not more than one month old on the date of opening of the issue, and the\nrating rationale from the rating agency is not more than one year old on the date of\nopening of the issue, and the rating letter and the rating rationale is a part of the offer\ndocument;\n(d) In the case of secondary market acquisition, the \u2018AAA\u2019 rating of the issue should be in\nforce and confirmed from the monthly bulletin published by the respective rating agency;\n(e) The securitized paper should be a performing asset on the books of the investing / lending\ninstitution.The above instructions are operative with immediate effect.\n3.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of\nGovernment securities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d basis\nin select  auctions of dated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-\ncompetitive bids up to 5 percent  of the notified amount will be accepted in the auctions\nof dated securities. The reserved amount will be within the notified amount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated\nGOI securities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL)\naccount with the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions:  Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks shall   be covered\nunder this Scheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single bid for an amount not more than Rs. two crore (face value) per\nauction\n3.  submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks that   maintain SGL\naccount and current account with the Reserve Bank of India shall be eligible to submit\ntheir non competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI.\nThe minimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in\nmultiples in Rs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent\nsubsidiary general ledger (CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they\nwish to participate. However, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme.\nAn undertaking to the effect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be\nobtained and kept on record by the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name,\namount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on\nthe date of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from\ntheir clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of\nnotified amount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will\nbe the responsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their\nclients in a transparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the\nshortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the\nmain SGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. Thefacility for affording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing\ninvestors who are not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to\nindicate clearly at the time of tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts ( face\nvalue ) to be credited to their SGL account and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical\nform from the main SGL account is permissible at the instance of the investor\nsubsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to\ntheir clients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the\nclients shall be completed within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such\ncosts may be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case\nthe transfer of securities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the\nconsideration amount payable by the client to the bank or PD would also include\naccrued interest from the date of issue.\n9.

Clarifications\nSWARNJAYANTI GRAM SWAROZGAR YOJANA (SGSY)\nThe Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India have launched a new programme\nknown as 'Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana' (SGSY)  by restructuring the following\nexisting schemes:\n1. Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP)\n2. Training of Rural Youth for Self Employment (TRYSEM)\n3. Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA)\n4. Supply of Improved Toolkits to Rural Artisans (SITRA)\n5. Ganga Kalyan Yojana (GKY)\n6. Million Wells Scheme (MWS)\nDetailed \u2018Guidelines\u2019 have been circulated to all DRDAs /Banks by the Ministry of Rural\nDevelopment.\n1. The Scheme\nThe SGSY Scheme is operative from 1st April, 1999  in rural areas  of the country. SGSY is\na holistic Scheme covering all aspects of self employment such as organisation of the poor\ninto Self Help Groups, training, credit, technology, infrastructure and marketing. The scheme\nwill be funded by the Centre and the States in the ratio of 75:25 and will be implemented by\nCommercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks and Co-operative Banks. Other financial\ninstitutions, Panchayat Raj Institutions, District Rural Development Agencies ( DRDAs),\nNon-Government Organisations (NGOs), Technical institutions in the district, will be\ninvolved in the process of planning, implementation and monitoring of the scheme. NGO's\nhelp may be sought in the formation and nurturing of the Self Help Groups ( SHGs) as well as\nin the monitoring of the progress of the Swarozgaris. Where feasible their services may be\nutilised in the provision of technology support, quality control of the products and as\nrecovery monitors cum facilitators.\nThe Scheme aims at establishing a large number of micro enterprises in the rural areas. The list\nof Below Poverty Line (BPL) households identified through BPL census duly approved by\nGram Sabha will form the basis for identification of families for assistance under SGSY.\nThe objective of SGSY is to bring the assisted poor families ( swarozgaris) above the\npoverty line by ensuring appreciable sustained income over period of time. This objective3is to be achieved by interalia organising the rural poor into Self Help Groups ( SHGs)\nthrough the process of social mobilisation, their training and capacity building and\nprovision of income generating assets. The rural poor such as those with land, landless\nlabour, educated unemployed, rural artisans and disabled are covered under the scheme.\nThe assisted poor families known as Swarozgaris can be either individuals or groups and\nwould be selected from BPL families by a three member team consisting of Block\nDevelopment Officer, Banker and Sarpanch.\nSGSY will focus on vulnerable sections of the rural poor. Accordingly the SC/ST will account\nfor at  least 50 percent, Women 40 percent, and the disabled 3 percent of those assisted.\n2. Skill Upgradation / Training\nOnce the person or group of persons has been identified for assistance, their training need also\nis to be ascertained with reference to Minimum Skill Requirement (MSR). The assessment\nregarding technical skills would be made by line departments and that of managerial skills by\nthe banker, while scrutinising the loan applications. Swarozgaris possessing skills will be put\nthrough basic orientation programme which is mandatory. This programme includes elements\nof Book Keeping, knowledge of market, identification and appraisal, acquaintance with\nproduct costing, product pricing, familiarisation with project financing by banks as well as\nbasic skills in the key activity identified. It will be for a short duration of not more than 2 days.\nBDOs, Bankers and line departments will act as resource persons for imparting the training.\nThe training expenditure incurred by the training institutions for both Basic Orientation\nand Skill Development Training will be met by DRDAs from out of the SGSY Fund.\nFor those beneficiaries who need additional skill development/ upgradation of skills,\nappropriate training would be organized through Government institutions, ITIs, Polytechnics,\nUniversities, NGOs etc. Swarozgaris will be eligible for loans under SGSY when they possess\nMinimum Skill Requirement, and it will be disbursed only when they have  satisfactorily\ncompleted the skill  training.\n3. Activity Clusters, Key Activities\nThe focus under the scheme should be on development of activity clusters with emphasis\non key activities identified in the block, both for group as well as individual assistance.\nThe activity clusters would be in geographic clusters of neighbouring villages within\nreasonable radius. However assistance is not prohibited for other activities. This is only\nan enabling provision for exceptional cases and it is expected that the funding of key\nactivities will be the norm.\nThe SGSY Committee will select about 10 activities per block. However, focus should be\non 4-5 key activities, which are identified for training and micro enterprise development\nin a cluster approach for larger number of groups. Care should however be taken that\nthe market is either readily available or there is a potential for market creation for the\nproducts. The District SGSY committee is empowered to add or delete any activity in the\nlist of selected key activities with due justification. The DRDAs shall prepare directory of\nthe selected key activities in the District (shelf of projects), which will be consolidated at\nthe State level for preparation of directory of selected key activities.\nOn farm activities to be assisted would include minor irrigation such as open dug\nwell/bore/tube well/lift irrigation/check dam etc. Non farm activities will include those4activities that result in the production of goods/services that have ready market. The unit cost\nas fixed by the regional Committees of NABARD should be taken into consideration as\nindicative cost while fixing the unit cost for the farm sector. In regard to loans falling\nunder ISB Sector, the responsibility of fixing the unit cost and other techno-economic\nparameters is of the District SGSY Committee .\n4. Self-Help Groups ( SHGs)\nThe Self Help Groups shall be organised by Swarozgaris drawn from the BPL list approved by\nGram Sabha. The Scheme provides for formation of Self Help Groups ( SHGs), nurturing and\ntheir linkages with banks.  SHGs may be an informal group or registered under Societies Act,\nState Co-operative Act or as a partnership firm. The assistance (loan cum subsidy) may be\nextended to individuals in a group or to all members in the group for taking up income\ngeneration activities.\nGroup activities will be given preference and progressively majority of the funding will be for\nSelf Help Groups. Half the groups formed at block level should be exclusively women groups.\nSelf Help Groups go through various stages of evolution viz. Group formation, Group\nStabilization, Micro Credit stage and Micro Enterprise Development stage. Under the\nscheme, generally a Self Help Group may consist of 10-20 persons.\ni) However, in difficult areas like deserts, hills and areas with scattered and\nsparse population and in case of minor irrigation and disabled persons, this\nnumber may vary from 5-20. The difficult areas have to be identified by the\nState Level SGSY Committee and the above relaxation in membership will be\npermitted only in such areas.\nii) Generally all members of the group should belong to families below the\npoverty line(BPL). However, if necessary, a maximum of 20% and in\nexceptional cases, where essentially required, up to a maximum of 30% of the\nmembers in a group may be taken from families marginally above the poverty\nline living contiguously with BPL families and if they are acceptable to the\nBPL members of the group.\niii) The Above Poverty Line (APL) members will not be eligible for the subsidy\nunder the scheme. The group shall not consist of more than one member from\nthe same family. A person should not be a member of more than one group.\nThe BPL families must actively participate in the management and decision\nmaking, which should not ordinarily be entirely in the hands of the APL\nfamilies. Further, APL members of the SHG shall not become office bearers\n(Group leader, Assistant Group leader or Treasurer) of the group.\niv) The group should operate a group account preferably in their service area\nbank branch, so as to deposit the balance amounts left with the groups after\ndisbursing loans to its members.\nv) The group should maintain simple basic records such as minutes book,\nattendance register, loan ledger, general ledger, cashbook, bank passbook and\nindividual pass books.\nvi) In case of disabled persons, the groups formed should ideally be disability\nspecific, wherever possible; however, in case sufficient number of people for\nformation of disability specific groups are not available, a group may comprise\nof persons with diverse disabilities or a group may comprise of both disabled\nand non disabled persons below the poverty line.5vii) In cases where the size of the SHG is large (as in the case of Neigbourhood\nGroups ( NHGs) under the Kudumbashree programme of Govt. of Kerala\nwhere a neighbourhood group can comprise up to 40 members), banks have\nbeen expressing difficulty in extending finance to such large groups. Hence sub\ngroups within the large group may be considered for financing by the banks\nunder the SGSY provided they (or the large group) have satisfied the required\ngrading criteria, possess all the characteristics of a viable and sustainable\ngroup and are found creditworthy by the banks\nIn States and Union Territories where the formation of SHGs has not taken root, banks may\ncontinue to extend credit facilities to eligible individual Swarozgaris\n5. Definition of Family and Wilful Defaulter\nThe terms \u2018Family\u2019 and \u2018Defaulter\u2019 for the purpose of SGSY guidelines have been\ndefined by the Government of India as under:\n\u2018BPL Family\u2019 under the guidelines would be treated as a unit for the purpose of giving\nincome generating assets. The \u2018Family\u2019 would consist of members of a household and\nunited by ties of marriage, blood and adoption. The family would consist of husband,\nwife, dependent parents /sons /daughters / brothers and sisters. The moment a\nparent/son/daughter/brother/sister is no longer dependent and has a separate household;\nhe will no longer be a member of the same BPL family .\nA household having two kitchens and two ration cards should not be treated as a family\nand the existence of two kitchens or two ration cards in the same house is an indication of\ntwo families. Mere declaration by the loan applicant that he has separated from the\nfamily may not be considered as sufficient document for separate household. It needs to\nbe ensured that ration card may not be insisted upon while defining the terms, due to\nvarious ground level difficulties faced in its procurement. Banks may devise their own\nways of verifying the facts while taking decision on the same by inspecting/ visiting the\nvillages in case of doubtful cases.\nAs far as the term \u2018Wilful defaulter\u2019 is concerned, it is defined as \u201cone who is capable of\nrepaying the loan, but has been defaulting intentionally and not repaying the loan\ndeliberately and wilfully.\nIt is desirable that wilful defaulters should not be financed under SGSY. In case wilful\ndefaulters are members of a group, they might be allowed to benefit from the thrift and\ncredit activities of the group including the corpus built up with the assistance of\nRevolving Fund. But at the stage of assistance for economic activities, the wilful\ndefaulters should not have the benefit of further assistance until the outstanding loans are\nrepaid. Wilful defaulters of the group should not get benefits under the SGSY scheme\nand the group may be financed excluding such defaulters while documenting the loan.\nFurther, non-wilful defaulters may be certified by a team comprising the BDO or his\nrepresentative, bank manager and the Sarpanch.\n6. Revolving Fund6SHGs that are in existence for about six months and have demonstrated the potential of a\nviable group enters the third stage, wherein it receives the Revolving Fund from DRDA\nand banks as cash credit facility. The DRDAs may release subsidy, which is equal to the\ngroup corpus with a minimum of Rs. 5000/- and a maximum of Rs. 10000/- linked with\nbank credit. The banks would sanction credit, which would be in multiples of the group\ncorpus and could go up to four times of the group corpus as cash credit facility based on\nthe absorption capacity and credit worthiness of the group.\nSubsequently, if it is found that the group has not been able to reach the micro enterprise\nstage and requires further financial support to continue in the micro finance stage for\nsome more time, performance of such groups may be got evaluated. In the evaluation if it\nis observed that the group has been successfully utilising the revolving fund, they could\nbe considered for sanction of further doses of subsidy fund up to a maximum of Rs.\n20000/- inclusive of previous doses linked with bank credit. The subsidy of Rs. 20000/-\nreleased by DRDA will be adjusted against the loan at the end of the cash credit period\non the request of the group.\nThe group corpus would be defined as the total amount available with the group inclusive\nof cash with the group, amount in Savings Bank account of the group, loans outstanding\nagainst members of the group and interest earned on the loans as well as deposits.\nThe revolving fund is provided to the groups to augment the group corpus so as to enable\nlarger number of members to avail loans and also to facilitate increase in the per capita loan\navailable to the members. The revolving fund imparts credit discipline and financial\nmanagement skills to the members so that they become credit worthy. SHGs that have\ndemonstrated their successful existence, will receive   assistance for economic activities under\nthe scheme.\n7. Lending Norms\nThe size of loan under the scheme would depend on the nature of project. There is no\ninvestment ceiling  other than the unit cost i.e. investment requirement worked out for the\nproject. The loans under the scheme would be composite loan comprising of Term Loan and\nworking capital. The loan component and the admissible subsidy together would be equal to\ntotal project cost. Banks may follow model project report set out in key activities of the\ndistricts for finalising the project cost of the Swarozgaris. Under any circumstance under\nfinancing is to be avoided . Swarozgaris will be given the full amount of loan and subsidy and\nthey will have the freedom to procure the assets themselves. Disbursements up to Rs.10 ,000/-\nunder ISB sector may be made in cash where a number of items are to be bought.\n(i) Group loans\nIdeally, under the group loaning, the group should take up single activity, but if there is a\nnecessity, the group could also take up multiple activities under the group loaning. In\neither case, loan will be sanctioned in the name of the group and the group stands as\nguarantee to the bank for prompt repayment of loan . The group is entitled to subsidy of\n50% of the project cost subject to per capita subsidy of Rs. 10000/- or Rs. 1.25 lakhs,\nwhichever is less.\n(ii) Multiple doses of credit7Emphasis is laid on multiple dose of assistance . This would mean assisting a Swarozgari over\na period of time with second and subsequent dose(s) of credit enabling him/her to cross the\npoverty line as also access higher amounts of credit. Subsidy entitlement for all doses taken\ntogether should not exceed the limit prescribed for that category. The second and subsequent\ndoses may be granted by the same bank or any other bank during the currency of first/earlier\nloan provided the bank is satisfied about the financial discipline of the first/earlier dose.\nGenerally, the people who are asset-less and skill-less are poorest of the poor and get left\nout under the programme. Such category of people may require small doses of multiple\ncredit over a period of time coupled with emphasis on awareness creation, training and\ncapacity building. The activities which are easier to handle and product is easily\nmarketable could be identified for such category of people to ensure sustainable income,\nso that, they do not fall into debt trap. DRDAs may ensure that anticipated income as\nstipulated in the project is realized during the project period in order to enable the\nSwarozgaries to cross the poverty line.\n(iii) Interest rates\nLoans under the Scheme will carry interest as per the directives on interest rates issued\nby Reserve Bank of India from time to time.\n(iv) Loan applications\n(a) Time limit for disposal of applications\nAll loans granted under the scheme are to be treated as advances under priority sector.\nLoan applications under the scheme should be disposed off within the prescribed time\nlimit of 15 days and at any rate not later one month. To avoid pendency of applications\ngreater coordination of work at the block level between bankers and Government\nfunctionaries is called for. The gap between receipt of loan applications, their sanction\nand disbursement should be minimized .\n(b) Rejection of loan applications\nIf some loan applications are rejected by the branch managers, the reason for rejection\nshould be clearly recorded on the application form itself and the relevant application\nshould be returned to the sponsoring authority immediately for their information and\nfurther action as they deem necessary .\nBranch Managers may be vested with adequate discretionary powers to sanction proposals\nunder the scheme without reference to any higher authority.\n8. Assistance to IRDP borrowers\n(i )The existing IRDP borrowers may also be considered for second/multiple dose of assistance\nunder SGSY if they have failed to cross the poverty line because of no fault of theirs.\nBanks may also extend credit under SGSY to non-wilful defaulter  owing dues up to Rs.\n5,000/- under IRDP. Subsidy available to the existing IRDP beneficiaries would be restricted\nto the maximum ceiling prescribed for the category less the amount already availed by the\nborrower under IRDP8(ii) Waiver of legal action before referring to DCC for forfeiture of subsidy under IRDP\nmisutilisation cases:\nAs per the existing instructions under IRDP, in case of misutilisation of loan by the\nbeneficiary, a bank branch can adjust the subsidy only after concurrence of the\nDCC/DLRC. It has been decided that in case of IRDP loans, where matters relating to\ndefaults in repayment have been pending for long, the bank branch may take decision\nabout forfeiture of subsidy and adjustment of the same against loan  after obtaining\napproval from the authority at next higher level.\n9. Insurance Cover\nInsurance cover is available for assets/live stock bought out of the loan. Swarozgaris are\ncovered under the Group Insurance Scheme as per the details given at paragraphs 4.35 & 4.36\nof the SGSY guidelines . For availing the group insurance coverage by the SGSY\nSwarozgaris  , the maximum age of Swarozgaris at the time of sanction has to be kept at\n60 years of age. The insurance coverage, however, would be for five years or till the loan\nis repaid, whichever is earlier, irrespective of  the age of Swarozgaris at the time of\nsanction of loan .\n10. Security norms\nFor individual loans upto Rs. 50000/- and group loans upto Rs. 5 lakhs, the assets created\nout of bank loan would be hypothecated to the bank as primary security. In case where\nmovable assets are not created, as in land- based  activities such as dug well, minor\nirrigation etc., mortgage of land may be obtained. Where mortgage of land is not\npossible, third party guarantee may be obtained at the discretion of the bank.\nFor all individual loans exceeding Rs, 50000/- and group loans exceeding Rs. 5 lakhs, in\naddition to primary security such as hypothecation/mortgage of land or third party\nguarantee as the case may be, suitable margin money/ other collateral security in the\nform of insurance policy; marketable security/ deeds of other property etc. may be\nobtained at the discretion of the bank. The upper ceiling of Rs. 5 Lakh is irrespective of\nthe size of the group or prorata per capita loan to the group .While deciding the limit for\ncollateral security, the total project cost (bank loan plus Govt. subsidy) should be taken\ninto consideration by banks.\n11. Subsidy\nSubsidy under SGSY will be uniform at 30 percent of the project cost, subject to a maximum\nof Rs. 7,500/-. In respect of SC/STs it will be 50 percent of the project cost subject to a\nmaximum of Rs. 10,000/-.\nThe group is entitled to subsidy of 50% of the project cost subject to per capita subsidy of\nRs. 10000/- or Rs. 1.25 lakhs, whichever is less. There will be no monetary limit on subsidy\nfor irrigation projects.\nSubsidy under SGSY will be back ended.  Banks should not charge interest on the subsidy\namount .  The availability of the benefit of subsidy to swarozgaris would be contingent on the\nproper utilisation of loan as also its prompt repayment and maintaining the asset in good9condition. The procedure for operation of Subsidy Reserve Fund accounts as detailed in\nparagraph 4.17 of the SGSY guidelines may please be followed.\nDRDAs will be opening savings banks accounts with the principal participating bank branches\nfor administration of subsidy. These accounts are to be reconciled every three months and they\nwill be subject to annual audit.\n12. Post Credit Follow-up\nLoan Pass books in regional languages may be issued to the Swarozgaris   which may contain\nall the details of the loans disbursed to them.Bank branches may observe one day in a week as\nnon public business working day to enable the staff to go to the field and attend to the\nproblems of Swarozgaris.\nBanks should ensure through proper monitoring and verification that quality assets have been\nprocured by the Swarozgaris. Necessary documents relating to acquisition of assets should be\nobtained by the bank and also followed through visits by field staff. In case of non-\nprocurement of assets by the Swarozgari in spite of reasonable time and opportunity, the bank\nshall be free to cancel the loan and recover the money. Legal proceedings (Civil/Criminal)\nwherever necessary may be initiated against the Swarozgari and against all members in case of\nSHG for recovery of loan.\n13. Risk Fund for Consumption Credit\nThe scheme provides for the creation of Risk Fund with 1 percent of SGSY funds at District\nlevel. Consumption loans not exceeding Rs. 2000/- per swarozgari  would be provided by the\nbanks. Assistance to the extent of 10 percent of the total consumption loans disbursed by banks\nto the SGSY swarozgaris during the year would be provided out of this Risk Fund.\n14. Repayment of Loan\nAll SGSY loans are to be treated as medium term loans with minimum repayment period of\nfive years. Instalments for repayment of loan will be fixed as per the unit cost approved by the\nNABARD/Dist. SGSY Committee. There will be a moratorium on repayment of loans during\nthe gestation period. Repayment instalments should not be more than 50 percent of the\nincremental net income expected from the project. Number of instalments may be fixed taking\ninto consideration the principal amount, the interest liability and the repayment period.\nSwarozgaris will not be entitled for any benefit of subsidy if the loan is fully repaid before the\nprescribed lock-in period. The repayment period for various activities under SGSY can broadly\nbe categorised into 5, 7 and 9 years depending on the project. The corresponding lock-in period\nwould be 3, 4 and 5 years respectively. If the loan is fully repaid before the currency period,\nthe Swarozgaris will be entitled only to pro-rata subsidy.\n15. Recovery\nPrompt recovery of loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks shall\ntake all possible measures, i.e., personal contact, organisation of joint recovery camps with\nDistrict Administration, legal action, etc to ensure recovery.  In case of default in the payment\nof loan or the group becoming defunct or dissolution of the group and in case the bank\nfails to recover the entire dues inspite of all possible measures, the process of forfeiture of\nsubsidy for adjustment against dues may be taken up. After getting the approval of\nDistrict SGSY Committee the concerned bank may adjust the subsidy against the10Swarozgaris dues. If the bank is able to realise any amount subsequently over and above\nthe amount due to it, the same may be returned to DRDA.\nThe banks may engage the services of NGOs or individuals (other than government servants)\nas monitor-cum-recovery facilitators, on a commission basis. A processing-cum-monitoring\nfee of 0.5 percent of the loan amount may be charged to the Swarozgaris to meet this\nexpenditure. Prompt repayment at the Swarozgari's level, will entitle him/her to waiver of the\n0.5 percent processing-cum-monitoring fee.\nThe provision as per Para 4.26 of the SGSY guidelines with regard to stipulation of 80%\nrecovery in Panchayats under the scheme had been temporarily suspended by\nGovernment of India vide their letter No. I-12011/20/99-IRD credit dated 16 March 2001.\nThe suspension would continue till further notice.\nThe State Governments and the banks should continue their efforts for recovery of loans\nunder the erstwhile IRDP and SGSY to improve the recovery performance under the\nscheme.\nWhile reporting the recovery under SGSY Banks, should not add the recovery under IRDP\nwith that of SGSY. Recovery figures under the SGSY should be maintained/ calculated\nseparately. Further, within SGSY, advances and recovery of loans under group/ individual\nfinance should be maintained separately to get a proper feed back.\n16. Refinance of SGSY Loans\nBanks are eligible for refinance from NABARD for the loans disbursed under SGSY as per\ntheir guidelines. The eligibility for refinance is related to the recovery position of the banks.\n17. Role of Banks and State Agencies\nBanks will be closely involved with Government agencies in implementing, planning and\npreparation of projects, identification of key activities, clusters, self-help groups, identification\nof individual swarozgaris infrastructure planning as well as capacity building and choice of\nactivity of the SHGs, grading of SHGs, selection of Swarozgaris, pre-credit activities and post\ncredit monitoring including loan recovery. The bank has the final say in the selection of\nSwarozgaris .\nWhere banks are involved as facilitators/ Self Help Promoting Institutions ( SHPIs), the\namount towards the cost of social mobilisation, training and capacity building of groups\nmay be decided in the State Level SGSY Committee keeping in view of the local need and\nrequirements. Further, payment of the cost of social mobilisation should be based on the\nstage of development of the group as mentioned in Para 3.21 of the amended guidelines .\n(i) Sensitisation programmes\nEmphasis is laid on the need for organizing training of bankers and district and block\nlevel officers involved in the implementation of the SGSY scheme. Banks may, therefore,\norganize district wise intensive one day sensitisation camps / workshops for their branch\nofficers.\n(ii) SGSY Special Projects\nThere is a need for more methodical formulation of the special projects under the scheme\nso as to bring in the advantages of economies of scale, faster dissemination of best11practices, creating market niches and accessing export markets etc. and banks may take\nup special projects under the scheme on pilot basis.\n(iii) Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS)\nThe Central Level Coordination Committee in its meeting held on 3rd June 2002 at\nHyderabad, noted that in the post VRS (Voluntary Retirement Scheme) scenario in\nbanks, there are many States, particularly in the North Eastern Region, where the\nimplementation of the programme has been suffering due to lesser number of persons\ndeployed in rural branches of banks. In this connection, we invite your attention to our\ncircular DBOD. BL.BC.3/22.01.001/2001 dated 25 July 2001 wherein it has been\nindicated that no branch of Public Sector Banks in general and that in a rural area in\nparticular is closed due to non availability of staff on account of introduction of VRS and\nthat lending under various schemes in rural areas is not adversely affected. We reiterate\nthe above instructions and advise that those bank branches, which have either been\nclosed or shifted from difficult areas, should be brought back to the original position,\nonce normalcy is restored in such areas.\n(iv) Participation of banks in block/district level SGSY Committee meetings\nFor monitoring the progress under the SGSY scheme, committees have been constituted\nat the block level and district level. Bank branch managers are members of the block\nlevel SGSY committee and the Lead Bank Officer is the convenor at the district level and\ndistrict coordinators of the implementing banks are members.  Banks should ensure their\nparticipation in the meetings of the block and district level SGSY committees.\n(v) Consultation Process\nIt is necessary to establish a process of consultation and to exchange /share information\nbetween district and block level functionaries with bankers for smooth implementation of\nthe programme. Government functionaries should share the information regarding\napproved BPL lists with banks and the banks should provide the details of defaulters\nunder IRDP/SGSY loans to the Government.\n18. Role of DRDAs\n(i) DRDAs may facilitate in planning of network of SHGs by federating them at\nappropriate level, once SHGs have reached the stage of maturity and have stabilized.\nThe DRDAs should put in concerted efforts to strengthen and consolidate the groups\nformed by various organisations as some level of synergy already exists and then take\nsteps to form new groups. The DRDA shall regularly monitor the progress of the groups\nthrough periodic evaluations. The DRDAs may act as nodal agency for developing\ndatabase, which should include SHGs formed under all the schemes to ensure\nconvergence of various scheme as well as better planning for training and other\nrequirement of SHGs.\nA facilitator working closely with the committies at grass root level can play a critical\nrole in group formation and development.\nDRDAs  may support such sensitive support mechanisms in the shape of NGOs or\ncommunity based organisations ( CBOs ) or net work of community coordinators/\nanimators or a commercial bank/ Regional Rural Banks/ Cooperative banks functioning12in rural areas or a team of dedicated functionaries of the Government who are fully\nengaged in the task of initiating and sustaining the group development process.\nWith regard to involvement of commercial bank/ Regional Rural Bank/ Cooperative\nbank branches functioning in rural areas as facilitators/ Self Help Promoting Institutions\n(SHPI), effort should be to involve only such bank branches who are committed and have\nshown keen interest in social mobilisation of poor people and could take up the\nresponsibility of social mobilisation, group formation and development of Self Help\nGroups. Accordingly, such rural bank branches could be involved as facilitators/ SHPIs\nfor social mobilisation, formation, training and capacity building of SHGs formed under\nthe scheme. Further, involving banks as SHPIs/ facilitators would help in credit linkage\nof groups which is one of the major objectives of organising SHGs and crucial for socio\neconomic empowerment and sustenance of groups.\n(ii) Linkage with banks & grading exercise\nDuring the stage of group formation, the SHG should be brought into contact with the\nlocal banks through opening of savings bank account preferably in their service area\nbranch. The BDO and the banker may visit the SHG as often as they can and explain to\nthe members the opportunities for Self Employment. The DRDAs should involve the\nbank functionaries also in the training programme of SHGs.\nIn case the SHGs have been in existence prior to the SGSY under other programmes and\nhave completed six months from the date of formation and it is being brought under the\nSGSY, such groups may be subjected to first grading immediately, without waiting for\nanother six months.\nFor Minor Irrigation schemes, relaxation of time for the second grading could be allowed\nif the group is found creditworthy and the project is viable. The decision in regard to the\nrelaxation may be taken by the Block level SGSY Committee.\nIn case the SHG has been in existence prior to the SGSY under other programes  and has\ncompleted one year from its date of formation and it is being brought under SGSY, the\ngroup may be subjected to second grading directly to assess its eligibility for economic\nactivity without subjecting to first grading.\nThe choice of the agency carrying out the grading as well as the criteria should be to the\nsatisfaction of the bank. It would be desirable that bank functionaries are involved in the\ngrading exercise of groups functioning in their service area.\n19. Deputation of Bank Officials to the DRDAs\nAs a measure of strengthening of DRDAs and for promoting a better credit environment,\ndeputation of bank officials to DRDAs has been suggested. Banks may consider deputing\nofficers at various levels to the state Governments/ DRDAs in consultation with them.\n20. Supervision and Monitoring\nBanks may set up SGSY cells at Regional/ Zonal Offices.These cells should periodically\nmonitor and review the flow of credit to SGSY Swarozgaris, ensure the implementation of the\nguidelines of the scheme, collect data from the branches and make available consolidated data13to the Head Office of the bank. The banks should ensure that no query from the field level\nremains unattended by the Head Office. Monitoring of the Scheme at the Head Office level of\nthe bank may be entrusted to a Senior Officer and the progress of this programme may be\nreviewed on a regular basis by the Top Management. Banks should ensure to achieve the\ncredit mobilisation target set for each financial year without fail.\nThe Scheme provides for the setting up of SGSY committees at Block/ District/State and\nCentral level. These committees will hold periodical meetings wherein the implementation of\nthe scheme will be reviewed and monitored. It is expected that banks will actively participate\nin these meetings and maintain closer co-ordination with the different agencies responsible for\nthe implementation of SGSY.\n21. Service Area Approach\nThe district SGSY Committee set up under the Scheme has been authorised to reallocate the\nvillages, which are either not covered by any bank branch or where the concerned branch is not\nable to perform for any reason whatsoever. The district SGSY Committee's decision on\nreallocation would be placed before DCC for its consideration and further necessary action.\nThe Service Area branches may be grouped block wise without disturbing their Service\nArea identities or their obligation to prepare Village Credit Plans/ Service Area Plans so\nthat borrowers will have the flexibility to approach other branches in a block in the event\nof inability of the concerned Service Area branch to adequately meet their requirements.\nThe primary responsibility for financing borrowers within the Service Area will be that of\nthe concerned Service Area branch. Borrowers will first approach their Service Area\nbranch for credit facilities and in the event of the concerned Service Area branch not being\nin a position to finance them, it will be incumbent on it to give a \u2018No Dues Certificate\u2019 to\nthe concerned borrower who will, then, be free to approach any other branch in the block\nfor credit support. If the Service Area branches do not issue \u2018No Dues Certificate\u2019 within\n15 days from the date of receipt of the application, the borrower will be free to approach\nany other branch in the block for his credit requirements without production of \u2018No Dues\nCertificate\u2019 from the concerned Service Area branch (vide circular  RPCD.No .\nBC.117/08.01.00/95-96 dated April 2, 1996 read with circular RPCD.No. BC. 150/08.01.00-\n93/94 dated 24 May 1994).\nBanks should follow these Service Area Approach guidelines scrupulously.\n22. Submission of Data\nClose monitoring at all levels would contribute greatly to the effective implementation of the\nScheme. Formats for reporting progress under SGSY as received from Ministry of Rural\nDevelopment are given in Annexure 1(2) to 1(7) . The information has to be compiled bank-\nwise at the block as well as district level to the corresponding block/district authority by the\nconcerned bank and also to be used for the State-level information by substituting district for\nthe block for monitoring and implementation of the scheme.\nQuarterly progress reports under the scheme may be furnished to RBI/Ministry of Rural\nDevelopment, Government of India, New Delhi as per the proforma enclosed for monitoring\nthe State wise/bank wise progress in the implementation of the scheme. The recovery statement\nunder the scheme may be submitted as per format enclosed on a half yearly basis at the end of\nMarch/September every year within 45 days from the close of half year to which it relates. The14data relating to SC/ST segment may be furnished separately in the annual statements as at end\nof March.\nBanks may include the scheme details and concepts as course contents in the training\nprogrammes for staff members and hold sensitisation programmes on SGSY wherever\nnecessary to further strengthen the scheme.\nThe review of the progress under SGSY scheme may be made by the banks at\nRegional/ Zonal /Head Office on a quarterly basis. A copy of the review note duly approved by\nthe Board may be forwarded to the Ministry of Rural Development, New Delhi and Rural\nPlanning & Credit Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai regularly\nand with out any delay.\n23. Annual Credit Plan 1999-2000\nAllocation made in the credit plan for IRDP are to be carried over to the SGSY scheme. All\nloans disbursed under IRDP since April 1999 are to be treated as disbursed SGSY.\nIn case of loans partly disbursed under IRDP, they are to be treated as committed liability\nunder SGSY and the balance loan has to be disbursed under SGSY.\nIn respect of loans sanctioned under IRDP but not disbursed, the cases have to be reviewed to\nsee if they fit into the basic criteria that it would lead to the assisted family coming above the\npoverty line. If so, the loan can be disbursed.\nIn so far as pending proposals under IRDP are concerned, they have to be reviewed with\nreference to key activities selected in the block. If the pending applications fit into parameters\nof these key activities, the loans can be sanctioned under SGSY.\n24. Credit Mobilisation Targets\nThe State-wise credit mobilisation targets are fixed by GOI every year. The State-wise targets\nmay be allocated among commercial banks, co-operative banks and RRBs by SLBCs. The\nSLBCs should finalise the targets of individual banks on the basis of acceptable parameters\nlike resources, number of rural/semi-urban branches, etc., so that each bank will be in a\nposition to arrive at its corporate target, the achievement of which will be strictly monitored by\nRBI. Every effort should be taken by the banks to achieve the credit target fixed on the above\nbasis.\n25. LBR Returns\nThe Code No. for SGSY under LBR reporting system has been allotted and communicated to the\nbanks. (Vide circular SAA 8/08.01.04/1999-2000 dt.20th January 2000).\nSeparate guidelines have been issued by the Ministry of Rural Development indicating the role\nand responsibilities of the line departments, banks, NGOs, Swarozgaris. Banks should issue\nsuitable instructions to their controlling offices/branches for implementation.\n26. Clarifications\nIn regard to the above ,some issues have been raised by banks in the operationalisation of the\nscheme. These issues together with clarifications are given in Annexure 1(1) .\nOperational issues which may arise during the course of implementation of the scheme may be\nresolved locally in the Block/ District/State Level Committees in consultation with officials of15line departments keeping overall content of the scheme in view to ensure that the smooth\nimplementation of the scheme is not impeded.\nAnnexure 1(1)\n Swarnjayanti Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) - Clarifications\nNo. Matter Referred Clarifications\nScheme\n1. State Governments have been informed\nthat from 1.4.1999 only the BPL census\nlist that has been undertaken in IX Plan\n(1999-2000 to 2003-2004) will be the valid\nlist.\nAverage size of family that can be taken\ninto account for calculating the income\nlevel to identify BPL families.Ministry of Rural Development has\nconfirmed that the IXth Plan BPL list is\navailable with Local Authorities. The list\nwill be made available to all the banks.\nBPL list is the basis for consideration for\nassistance.\n2. Formalities for formation of SHG & for\nlending to SHG would require minimum\none year whereas individuals may be\nassisted immediately. Due to delays for\nSHG lending, individual lending is\npreferred by Swarozgaris. Relaxation may\nbe granted for SHG, financing during\n1999-2000.The SHG formation should take required\ntime and should not be driven by any\ntargets. Process approach for formation of\ngroups should be followed as detailed in\nthe guidelines. Existing DWCRA groups\nmay be considered for financing in key\nactivities, if they possess characteristics of\na good SHG. As a relaxation during 1999-\n2000, more number of individual\nSwarozgaris may be financed under SGSY.\n3. The stipulation on category wise\nreservations (40% for Women, 50% for\nSC/ST, 3% for disabled) should be relaxed\nand flexibility offered.Achievement of sub-targets may be\nensured by Banks at District level.\nFlexibility is not possible as the focus of\nthe scheme will be particularly on\nvulnerable groups\nSkill Upgradation\n1. Financial assistance to undergo skill\ndevelopment training conducted for more\nthan a week.\n(a) Maximum ceiling limit/mode/period\nof repayment.Quantum of assistance for skill\ndevelopment training would be dependent\non the nature of skill development, the\ninstitution facility available in the locality\nand the period of training. It would also\ndepend on the nature of the activity and the\nSwarozgari. It would not be possible to\nprescribe any period of training.  The cost\nwould vary accordingly.16No. Matter Referred Clarifications\nThese issues may be decided at the\nDistrict-SGSY Committee level. As the\nborrower has to undertake an activity and\nstart repaying the skill development loan\nalong with activity specific loan. The\nrepayment period may run concurrently.\nMode of payment is left to the individual\njudgement of the lending bank.\n(b) Inclusion of the cost of training as\npart of the project and release the loan\nfor training as 1st instalment so that\nwe can minimise the documentation\nformalities, (only one account instead\nof two separate accounts)Separate documentation would be\nnecessary, as the project cost would be\ndisbursed separately after the training.\nii) Who will fix the quantum of\nassistance locally?By and large, the scale of assistance is\nfixed by the District SGSY committee.\nMinor variations, if any, can always be\ndecided by the banks in consultation with\nthe line department officials or the DRDA\nofficials.\niii) Whether loan is to be given to the\nindividual swarozgari or to the group?Loan can be given either to the group or to\nthe Individual Swarozgari.\nActivity Clusters, Key activities\n1. Block SGSY Committee should compile\nand update the data on village profile.\nChoice between spread and cluster based\nefficiency should be left to Block SGSY\nCommittee.Key activities to be pursued by the\nSwarozgaris will be on the basis of village\nprofiles/P.L.P./S.A.A./Credit Plans. Block\nSGSY Committee will have the say in the\nselection of Key activities and spread/\nclusters.\nSelf Help Groups\n1. Modalities to ensure sub targets for SC/ST,\nWomen and Physically handicapped in the\ncase of group loan.Sub targets may be monitored by the banks\nat the District level to achieve required\ntargets.\n2. Exit route for member of the group or in\nthe event of death with particular reference\nto sharing of liabilities of the member and\nsavings made by the member.As per Bye-laws/agreement of the group.\n3. Whether a member in a group can avail of\ntwo subsidies one by availing individual\nloan supported by the group and another\nloan by being a member of a group in the\ncase of a group loan.Member can avail subsidy individually or\nas a member of a group.17No. Matter Referred Clarifications\n4. Whether the member of a family can\nbecome member of different group and\navail loan?Yes. The subsidy is given to the group and\nnot to the individuals.\n5. If Bank advance is granted to any\nindividual member, then how the loan\naccounts will be maintained in Bank\nBooks? Such loans to individuals would\nnot conform to group approach.The loan is either to an individual in a\ngroup or to a group and the books will be\nmaintained accordingly. The loan may be\ngiven to the members and routed through\nSHG and recovery may be made though\nSHG.\n6. Whether a group with less than ten\nmembers can be considered?Minimum of ten members must be\nmaintained in a group. However in\ndifficult areas like deserts, hills and\nareas with scattered and sparse\npopulation and in case of minor\nirrigation and disabled persons, this\nnumber may vary from 5-20. The\ndifficult areas have to be identified by\nthe State Level SGSY Committee and\nthe above relaxation will be permitted\nonly in such areas.\n7. Existing SHGs (including BPL and non-\nBPL families) offer ready scope for\ncoverage under SGSY?BPL members of a mixed group can avail\nloans in individual capacity. Mixed groups\nare not entitled to group subsidy. However,\nan exception has been made for DWCRA\ngroups for the year 1999-2000 .\n8. Appropriate Grading criteria should be\nestablished for newly formed groups. The\nprocedure for assessing and selecting the\nagencies to do the grading, training etc.\nhave not been elaborated in the new SGSY\nguidelines.DCC/SLBC can decide the grading based\non NABARD rating norms. No external\nagency is required unless DCC/SLBC\ndecide otherwise.\nRevolving Fund\n1. (a) Whether the cash credit will be of\npermanent nature or can be recovered\non reducing balance over five years\nand terms of the loan.The revolving fund - (cash credit facility)\nmay be necessary on a permanent basis\nand may co-exist with the SHG.\n(b) When the account has to be brought\ninto credit balance adjusted.Cash Credit account should be monitored\ncontinuously and renewed periodically\ndepending on the necessity.\n(c) Rs. 10,000/- paid by DRDA has to be\nrepaid or not or treated as grant?Rs. 10,000/- from DRDA may be treated\nas subsidy grant in so far as the bank is\nconcerned. As far as group is concerned, it\nis a cash credit and has therefore to be\nrepaid. Only, interest is not charged on18No. Matter Referred Clarifications\noutstanding upto Rs. 10,000/-.\n(d) Method of liquidation of CC A/c. It would be liquidated like any other cash\ncredit. The liability of the group is for the\nentire amount of cash credit outstanding.\n2. (a) Mode of sanction and recovery under\nrevolving fund is to be clarified ..Revolving fund is linked to corpus of the\ngroup and is given only to those groups\nthat have passed the first round of\ngrading. The operation of the account\nmay be decided by a resolution of the\ngroup. The account will be in the form\nof cash credit. Interest will be charged\non credit availed in excess of subsidy.\nThe cash credit account (RF) may\ncontinue till the SHG is in operation and\nthe fund is operated to the satisfaction of\nthe lending banker. Please refer to Para\n(6) of Master Circular.\n(b) Whether the operat ive limit or RF\nA/c. is to be reduced to Rs. 15,000/-The operative limit will depend upon the\ncorpus of the group. (refer to Para (6) of\nMaster Circular)\n(c) Whether the banks have to take\ndocuments for Rs. 25,000/- or Rs.\n15,000/-.Banks will have to take documents for\nthe whole operative limit.\n3. (a) How is the DRDA subsidy of Rs.\n10,000/- to be treated? Should it be\ncredited to the cash credit account\nstraight away or to be kept in a\nseparate non-interest bearing account\nas deposit?It is a subsidy for Revolving Fund of the\ngroup and therefore may be kept in subsidy\nReserve Fund A/c. in the name of SHG.\nThis would, therefore, not attract\nCRR/SLR requirement. No interest should\nbe charged on the Rs. 10,000/- credited to\nthe subsidy reserve fund i.e. the SHG\nwould be required to pay interest on bank\ncredit portion only.\n(b) The loan or subsidy does not bear any\nrelation to the number of members in\nthe group which may vary from 5 to\n20 in a SHG. Groups with smaller\nmembership will get more per capita\nrevolving fund.The loan amount would depend on the\nproject undertaken by the group. The\nRevolving Fund and Subsidy limits are for\na group and variation in per capita\nrevolving fund/subsidy will therefore exist.\n(c) Revolving fund loan/subsidy does not\nbear a relation to the group savings.\nGroup savings indicate the capacity of\nthe group to rotate the funds among\nthemselves.Revolving fund and subsidy are two\nsupports available for SHGs under SGSY\nand Revolving Fund is linked to group\ncorpus.19No. Matter Referred Clarifications\n(d) Security and interest norms for\nRevolving fund.For Revolving Fund, simple letter of\nundertaking from Group members would\nbe sufficient in addition to inter-se\nagreement and usual documentation. The\ninterest would be charged on bank credit\nportion of Revolving Fund. The rate would\nbe as applicable to priority sector lending.\n4. Under what sub-head revolving fund loan\nis to be categorised within priority sector?May be shown under loans to SHGs under\npriority sector.\nLending Norms\n1. Second and subsequent doses may be\ngranted by the same bank or any other\nbank. How a borrower under a service area\nwill be accommodated by another bank for\n2nd/multiple dose.In terms of Para (7)  of Master Circular, if\nthe bank is not in a position to grant\nsecond/multiple dose, as in the case of\nWeak Commercial Bank/Co-operative\nBank/RRB, another bank may finance the\nborrower after obtaining no objection\ncertificate from the lending bank. In such\ncases, borrowers may be allowed to go\nbeyond the Service Area. SGSY\nCommittees at Block/District may decide\nsuch cases.\n2. An individual who has availed a non minor\nirrigation loan is willing to avail a loan for\nminor irrigation. Eligible quantum of\nsubsidy may be specified.A SGSY borrower under non minor\nirrigation will not be eligible for assistance\nand subsidy entitlement under minor\nirrigation loan.\n3. Who is responsible authority for\npreparation of project profile and who will\ndecide the reality of the profiles, technical\nfeasibility, economic viability etc. for each\nblock and who is the authority for\napproval?The Block SGSY Committee is required to\nprepare project profiles of 8-10 key\nactivities. For this, the potential linked\nplans of NABARD, village credit profile\nof SAA may be relied on. These project\nprofiles along with recommendations of\nPanchayat Samiti should be forwarded to\nDistrict SGSY Committee which will\nscrutinise the proposals and approve them.\n4. Whether the stamp duty on Hypothecation\nagreement, general form of Guarantee and\nIrrevocable Power of Attorney is waived or\nnot? If not, the quantum of stamp duty to\nbe levied for each document?The waiver of stamp duty on various\ndocuments to be executed by individual/\ngroup loanees rests with the State\nGovernments.\n5. Title of loan account in case of Group\nfinanceIt should be name of the group and denoted\nas XYZ - SHG-village.\n6. (i) Whether cash disbursement is\nallowed in farm sector also.Banks may disburse all loans for\nagricultural purposes in cash and this will20No. Matter Referred Clarifications\n(ii) If so, what is the limit?\n(iii) Whether cash disbursement will be\napplicable in all the blocks in a\ndistrict or the identification of blocks\nfor cash disbursement system will be\nentrusted to the DCC/Dist. SGSY\nCommittee in order to ensure\nnecessary safeguards for this\npurpose?be applicable in all Blocks/Districts.\n7. Emphasis is laid on multiple doses of\nassistance. Whether the credit can be given\nto more than one activity? Whether\nsubsequent doses of credit can be provided\nto the same activity or to different activity?More than one activity can be assisted.\nHowever, the activity should be within the\nkey activities identified.\n8. In case of financing through SHG, the\nsavings mobilised by SHG may be taken as\nmargin. A stipulation of bringing in a\nmargin of 25% by way of group savings\nwill reduce the future debt service burden\nof the beneficiaries.Savings of the group need not be linked to\nthe loan under SGSY as the target group is\nfrom the BPL list. Loan is given to a SHG.\nonly if the grading is satisfactory (Para 3.1\nof the guidelines). As per the guidelines\nfull project cost has to be financed.\n9. It is stated that under-financing should be\navoided. Does it mean that the individual\nbanker has absolutely no discretion to\ndetermine the amount of loan?Financing of the project has to be as per\nthe project profile. The project profile\nindicates the amount of investment that is\nrequired for each activity. However, the\nbankers do have a final say in the sanction\nof loans as indicated in the guidelines.\n10. Documents to be obtained from\nindividuals/ SHG under SGSYThe application and documentation\nformats provided for individuals/group\nloaning under IRDP may be used with\nsuitable modifications under SGSY.\nInsurance Cover\n1. Please advise mode of ascertaining the date\nof birth of a Swarozgari in the case where\nloan is extended to a person between 55 to\n60 years.The Swarozgari's ration card, voter's list,\nBPL list and if literate, school leaving\ncertificate or if nothing is available his\ndeclaration would be sufficient to\ndetermine the age of Swarozgari .(refer to\nPara(9) of Master Circular).\nSecurity Norms\n1. Group may consist of 10 to 20 persons-\nMaximum quantum of loan to the group\ncould be Rs. 10 lakhs and minimum may\nbe Rs. 5 lakhs. Collateral security upto Rs.\n10 lakhs should be waived.The security norms were revised in the\nCLCC meeting held in June 2002. Norms\nindicated in paragraph 10 of the Master\nCircular may be followed.21No. Matter Referred Clarifications\n2. In case of group loans, if the group is not\nin a position to offer its own assets as\ncollateral security, banks may seek\ncollateral security from individual\nmembers of the Group. Norms may be\nstipulated for obtaining collateral security\nin respect of group loans.Collateral Security may be obtained if the\nprime security is not sufficient. In such a\ncase it will be open to the bank to seek\ncollateral from individual members of the\ngroup or others depending on the\ncircumstances of the case. Bankers are free\nto decide.\nSubsidy\n1. RPCD.BC.6/568(A)(P) dated 10.7.91\npermits the principal branches in a district\nto allow overdrawing to the extent of 10%\nof total subsidy allocated for the year. The\nlimits for each bank is decided in the\nmeeting to finalise physical financial target\nwhether the said guidelines under IRDP\nwould hold good for SGSY. If so, the latest\nposition in the matter.The same instructions will hold good under\nSGSY.\n2. What will be the subsidy component in\nmultiple doses of credit involving Minor\nIrrigation Project where there is no\nmonetary ceiling?There is no ceiling on subsidy in respect of\nminor irrigation project even in case of\nmultiple doses of credit for individual as\nwell as for group loans. (refer Para (11)\nof Master Circular)\n3. Detailed guidelines for implementation of\nback-end subsidy together with terms and\nconditions governing creation of subsidy\ndeposit in the form of Subsidy Reserve\nFund A/c. its adjustment etc. may be\ncirculated.Refer to Para 4.17 and 4.24 of Government\nof India guidelines for details on back-end\nsubsidy. The terms and conditions of the\nback-end subsidy are the same as under\nIRDP.\nPost Credit Follow-up\n1. (a) In case of non procurement\nmisutilisation of loan whether the\ncivil criminal action can be initiated?\n(b) If only criminal then FIR is to be filed\njointly by the Bank and DRDA. At\npresent, civil action cannot be\ninitiated in Government sponsored\nprogrammes.Reference is invited to para 4.10 of\nGovernment of India guidelines.\n2. If Swarozgari does not purchase the assets\nwithin one month from the date of release\nof the amount by the bank, what steps\nshould be initiated and how to recover the\nloan amount from the Swarozgari?The reasons for non procurement should be\nlooked into by the bank/BDO. If the non-\nprocurement of assets is wilful or due to\nnegligence of the Swarozgari, after giving\nreasonable opportunity for procurement the\nbank is free to cancel the loan and recover22No. Matter Referred Clarifications\nthe money.\nRisk Fund for Consumption Credit\n1. 10% of consumption loans disbursed by\nbanks could be provided out of Risk Fund\nat District Level for Swarozgaris from\nWeaker Section. Whether this 10% is\nsubsidy or repayable loan.The banks will get 10% of the\nconsumption credit disbursed by them\nduring the year from DRDA to maintain a\nrisk fund. The fund enables the bank to\nwrite-off consumption loans, which have\nbecome irrevocable.\n2. At what point of time consumption credit\nis to be disbursed and whether any separate\napplication form/security document is\nrequired to be obtained or it should be\nincluded within SGSY application form\nand limit will be inclusive of consumption\nloan limit.Swarozgaris (other than Self Help Group\nmembers) may be considered for\nconsumption loan not exceeding Rs.\n2,000/-. Separate application/document\nwould be necessary. The members of\nSHGs will not be eligible for consumption\nloan, it is open for the SHGs to meet this\nfrom the cash credit facility.\n3. Modalities of opening/applying for the risk\nfund may be elaborated. Who will be the\nimplementing agency for this fund and\nwhat does it cover?Risk Fund is to be constituted by banks to\ncover the risk arising out of loans\nsanctioned for consumption purposes to\nWeaker Section including SGSY\nborrowers, small marginal farmers,\nlandless agricultural workers, rural artisans\netc. (Para 4.30 of SGSY guidelines). The\nmodalities are available in Annexure XXI\nof IRDP Manual.\nRepayment of Loan\n1. Does the 'number of instalments' and\n'repayment' have the same meaning?The repayment period varies according to\nthe activity taken up. Number of\ninstalments would, therefore, depend on\nthe amount of loan, interest liability and\nthe repayment period (i.e. 5, 7 and 9 years\nas the case may be) of the activity for\nwhich the loan has been given. This will be\npart of the Project Profile.\n2. What is prompt repayment period to entitle\nfor the waiver of 0.5% processing-cum-\nmonitoring fee. If waived, how further\npayment may be made?So long as the loan repayment has not been\ndelayed by the Swarozgari beyond a\nschedule of time limit (with grace period)\nfor repayment instalment the account may\nbe considered as regular. The processing-\ncum-monitoring fee could be waived in the\nlast instalment.\n3. In case the loan is fully repaid before\ncertain period specified i.e. lock-in-period,Working of pro-rata subsidy for SGSY\nrepayment is enclosed.23No. Matter Referred Clarifications\nthe borrower is eligible for pro-rata\nsubsidy. The working of pro-rata needs\nelucidation.\n4. Income of beneficiary necessarily crosses\nRs. 2,000/- p.m. net of bank instalment,\nafter taking up the activity or at the end of\nthird year. It may not be possible for a poor\nman to take up activity of such a scale\nwhich would generate cash surpluses of\nmore than Rs. 4,000/-. District SGSY\nCommittee may attempt to formulate\ncomparatively bigger project which may\nfail for want of skill and experience.A number of Project profiles being worked\nout in the field and the feedback from the\nStates indicate that this can be achieved.\nRecovery\n1. Incentive and disincentive for recovery.\nWhether the processing-cum-monitoring\nfee is to be charged as one time measure in\nconcerned Swarozgaris accounts or\nwhether it can be charged every year.The processing-cum-monitoring fee has to\nbe charged once at the time of\ndisbursement of the loan.\n2. RBI circular reads: In case of default in\nrepayment of loan by any Swarozgari,\nbanks may adjust subsidy (including\ninterest earned) against his dues after\ngetting approval from Dist. SGSY\nCommittee.No interest is payable on the subsidy kept\nin Subsidy Reserve Fund A/c. and like-\nwise no interest is chargeable on the\namount of loan representing subsidy\nportion. The clause \"including interest\nearned\" may be deleted from RBI circular\nas well as para 4.24 of Government\nguidelines.\n3. Whether processing charges are to be\nlevied at the time of disbursement or at the\ntime of referring the case to NGO for\nassistance in recovery and monitoring.\nWhether it has to be refunded in case of\nprompt recovery?The processing-cum-monitoring charges\nmay be levied at the time of disbursement\nof loan and refunded i.e. adjusted towards\nthe repayment in the last instalment since\nthe repayment position will be known\ntowards the end.\n4. A benchmark level of recovery should be\nmaintained at each village/block and banks\nwould have to review about further lending\nin such village/block where recovery is\nless than the minimum level.The banks have been requested to prepare\nthe defaulters list by end of September\n1999. The matter will be reviewed at the\nappropriate time. For SGSY, minimum\nrecovery levels should be 80 %\n(Temporarily suspended).\nSupervision & Monitoring\n1. In some States, the quarterly meetings of\nBlock Committees under SAA are being\nturned into SGSY Committee meetings,The issues relating to SGSY are to be\ntaken up for discussion in the Block and\nDistrict SGSY committees. SGSY has\nspecific committees because it requires24No. Matter Referred Clarifications\nthus defeating the purpose for setting up\nseparate fora under SGSY at Block/Dist.\nLevel.special attention. The need for separate\ncommittees on SGSY exists at least for the\nfirst 2-3 years so that issues can be\ndiscussed threadbare.\n2. Convenors at all levels except at District\nlevel are Government officials - LDM is\nthe convenor at District level forum. In\nview of this and for meaningful co-\nordination between the agencies, convenor\nat district level be changed and District\nlevel government official may be\nnominated as convenor District SGSY\nCommittee.There is no change in the existing position.\n3. It has been suggested that Block level\nSGSY Committee monthly meetings of\nthat month and quarterly BLBC meetings\nbe synchronised to enable the LDO to\nattend them on selective basis.LDOs may attend the Block level SGSY\nmeetings selectively only when they attend\nSC/DCC meetings if the BLBC is\nconducted before or after.\n4. Similarly, under SGSY there is a District\nSGSY Committee which is akin to SC of\nDCC. There is need to synchronise these\nfora also.The present position may continue.\nService Area Approach\n1. Under SGSY Scheme, District SGSY\nCommittee has been empowered to\nallocate the villages which are either not\ncovered by any bank branch or where\nconcerned bank branch has not performed\nfor any reason. Please clarify whether the\nreallocation of village is restricted to\nSGSY Scheme alone or for all other\nbanking activities in the village and\nwhether RBI approval is necessary.This was discussed and decided in the\nCLCC. In order to ensure that such\nreallocation does not pose any problem at\nthe level of implementation we have\nadvised in Para 21 of our Master\nCircular  that the reallocation decision be\nreferred to DCC for its consideration and\nnecessary action.\n2. In case group loaning covering 2/3\nvillages, the branch having more members\nfrom its service area may finance the\nGroup.The Block/District SGSY Committee may\ndecide on the basis of allocation given to\neach branch. Group loaning can also be\ndecided by the BLBC/ DCC/SC.\nSubmission of Data\n1.

NO. 5 /07.01.00/2003-04\n22 July 2003\nAll Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks\nDear Sirs,\nOpening of Extension Counters by Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks\nPlease refer to our circular BL.PCB.46/07.01.00/2000-01 dated April 26, 2001 and subsequent\ncirculars issued on the above subject. The norms for opening of extension counters ( ECs) by\nprimary (urban) cooperative banks ( UCBs) have been reviewed, in the light of representations\nreceived in this regard. Accordingly, the following instructions are being issued, in supersession\nof earlier instructions issued by us.\n2. Places where ECs can be opened\n2.1 ECs may be opened within the premises of only educational institutions, big offices, factories\nand hospitals of which the concerned UCB is the principal banker ; requests from other bankers\nto the institution may be considered, only if opening of an EC is not considered feasible by the\nprincipal banker or its nearest branch is beyond 10 kms from the concerned institution.\n2.2 ECs may also be opened in residential colonies  subject to the condition that there should be\nno branch or extension counter of any bank already existing in the colony. There should also be\nno restrictions imposed by the local development or any other authorities for setting up a\ncommercial establishment in the proposed locality/colony.\n3. Revised Norms for opening of ECs\n3.1 With a view to bringing uniformity in the criteria to be satisfied by UCBs desirous of\nopening ECs, the norms for opening extension counters have been rationalised and consolidated.\nThe revised norms are as under:\n3.2 Licensed UCBs, which are not classified as Grade III or IV, and satisfy the following norms,\nwill be eligible to open ECs:\na) Capital to Risk Assets Ratio ( CRAR) should not be less than that prescribed by Reserve\nBank of India;\nb) owned funds of the bank should not be less than the minimum required for opening of a\nnew branch at the centre where the proposed EC is to be opened;\nc) net NPAs should be less than 10% of net loans and advances, with full provisioning, as\non 31 March of the latest financial year;\nd) net profit (with no accumulated losses) in each of the 2 preceding years;\ne) achievement of prescribed priority sector target;f) track record of compliance with B.R. Act, 1949 ( AACS) and RBI instructions,\ncompliance with CRR/ SLR requirements on a continuous basis, and timely submission of\nreturns.\n3.3 Conditions to be satisfied while opening ECs:\n(i) The base branch of the bank to which the proposed extension counter is linked should be\nwithin a distance of 10 kms. to facilitate incorporation of transactions of the EC in the\naccounts of the base branch on a day-to-day basis.\n(ii) Only one EC is permitted within the premises of any institution/office/hospital/residential\ncolony.\n(iii) Before opening an extension counter, the bank should take into account important factors\nsuch as the need, viability and overall merits of opening of the EC.\n(iv) ECs should not be opened merely for collection of fees, payment of bills for electricity,\nwater, telephones, etc., as these are primarily the responsibility of the concerned\ninstitution.\n4. Facilities that could be provided at the EC:\n4.1 The facilities at an extension counter should be restricted to -\n(a) acceptance of deposits;\n(b) issue and encashment of drafts and mail transfers;\n(c) encashment of travellers' cheques; and\n(d) collection of bills.\n4.2 UCBs having net profits for last three years, and net NPAs below 7% may also offer safe\ndeposit locker facility, subject to provision of adequate security arrangements.\n5. Application procedure:\n5.1 Non-scheduled UCBs are required to obtain prior permission of RBI before opening an EC .\nSuch UCBs fulfilling the above eligibility norms shall apply, as per format in Annexure, to the\nRegional Office of RBI, UBD under whose jurisdiction their Registered Office is located.\n5.2 Scheduled UCBs, which satisfy all the eligibility criteria , can open ECs without prior\npermission of RBI. They must apply, within one month from the date of opening the EC, to the\nconcerned Regional Office of RBI, UBD, in the annexed proforma, for post facto approval .\n5.3 However, all UCBs, including scheduled UCBs, are required to obtain prior approval from\nRBI for opening an EC in a residential colony.\n6. Compliance\nECs opened in contravention of the above instructions will not be regularised and will have to be\nclosed down. The concerned UCB will also be liable for penalty under the relative provisions of\nthe Banking Regulation Act 1949 ( AACS).7. These instructions supersede all our earlier instructions on the subject.\nYours faithfully,\n(S.

Though banks have made progress\nin reducing the number of entries outstanding in the Clearing Adjustment Account, the level\nof outstanding entries still continues to be high. Since this is a fraud prone area, it is\nimperative for banks to adjust the old pending entries in the Clearing Adjustment Accounts.   \n2. While reviewing the position of progress made by banks in reducing the outstanding\nentries in their Clearing Adjustment Account, it has been observed that entries of smaller\nvalues form a significant portion of the old outstanding clearing differences and pose\npractical difficulties in the reconciliation. In the light of suggestions received from banks and\nwith a view to reducing the level of long pending outstanding entries in the Clearing\nAdjustment Account of banks, it has been decided, as a one time measure , to allow banks to\nnet off the entries representing clearing differences receivable against entries representing\nclearing differences payable up to Rs. 500 which are outstanding for more than three years.\n3. Banks are advised to adopt the following procedure for netting off the entries representing\nclearing differences receivable against entries representing clearing differences payable.\n(a) Banks may net off all entries representing clearing differences 'receivable' against\nentries representing clearing differences 'payable', of amounts less than Rs. 500 each\nwhich are outstanding in the Clearing Adjustment Accounts for more than three years\nas on March 31, 2003, i.e., all outstanding entries of less than Rs. 500 each in the\nClearing Adjustment Account (receivables against payables) originated on or before\nMarch 31, 2000 and outstanding as on March 31, 2003. In terms of paragraph 2 of our\ncircular DBS.CO.SMC.BC.No.17/ 22.03.001/ 97-98 dated June 11, 1998, banks were\nadvised to transfer all old clearing differences (both payable and receivable) prior to\nApril 1, 1994 to a blocked account. The entries in these blocked accounts may also be\nreckoned for the purpose of netting off.\n(b) Since the entries would be outstanding in the branch books, the service branches /\nnodal branches may net off the outstanding entries in the clearing differences account\nand thereafter transfer the net position to their Head Office along with the full details\nof the entries representing clearing differences payable as also the entries representing\nclearing differences receivable.2\n(c) At the Head Office, the bank may aggregate the net positions reported by the branches\nand arrive at the net aggregate position of clearing differences. If the aggregate net is\nin debit, the same may be written off by debit to the profit and loss account. If the\naggregate net is a credit, the same may be transferred to a separate blocked account\nand shown under 'other liabilities and provisions - others' in the balance sheet\n(Schedule 5 of the Balance Sheet). The balance in the blocked account will be\nreckoned for the purpose of maintenance of CRR/ SLR.\n(d) Banks should ensure that the above exercise does not result in any portion of the\nclearing difference entries being parked in the inter-branch accounts.\n(e) Banks should maintain a record of the clearing difference entries transferred to Head\nOffice at the branches / Head Office for verification by internal inspection / auditors /\nRBI inspection. The netting off at the branches, the transfer of entries by the branches\nto the Head Office, the netting off at the Head Office and the writing off / transfer at\nthe Head Office should be subjected to a 100 percent audit by the internal auditors,\nthe concurrent auditors and the statutory auditors.\n4.  It has also been observed that the Clearing Adjustment Account of banks include entries\npertaining to inter-branch clearing differences in addition to the inter-bank clearing\ndifferences. Separation of instruments viz. cheques, demand drafts etc. pertaining to inter-\nbranch transactions from inter-bank clearing is expected to reduce the clearing differences\nconsiderably. Hence, banks are advised to route their inter-branch clearing instruments\nthrough an in-house clearing mechanism and not route it along with inter-bank clearing\ninstruments.\n5. These guidelines may be placed before the Board of Directors.\n6.

V. Subba Rao)\nChief General Manager-in-charge\nDepartment of Banking Supervision\nReserve Bank of India\nCentral Office\nSeptember 2002\nGuidelines on preventing slippage of NPAs\nBackground\nAn analysis of NPAs in the Indian banking system as on March 31, 2001 done internally in RBI\nhad been put up to the Board for Financial Supervision ( BFS) in its 79th meeting held on\nDecember 27, 2001. In this connection, the BFS directed to conduct a study on slippage of NPA\naccounts from sub-standard to doubtful category and to arrive at recommendations to prevent\nsuch slippage.\nAs directed by the BFS, a study was conducted by an in-house group in the Bank by scanning\nrelevant information/data obtained from a select group of banks as also by holding discussions\nwith bank officials, who manage NPAs  at the policy level as well as those who look after actual\nrecovery, rehabilitation/revival, restructuring of accounts at the implementing level. The group,\non the basis of the study, had suggested a framework of recommendations for preventing\nslippage of NPAs relevant at the banks\u2019 level. The draft of these recommendations was\ncirculated amongst the banks for their comments and feedback. While most of the banks\nconcurred with the recommendations, some additional suggestions received from a number of\nrespondents were analysed, and have been factored into the final recommendations.\nRecommendations\nThe preventive and corrective measures suggested under the framework of recommendations\nare an indicative but not exhaustive set of guidelines relevant at banks\u2019 level. Appropriate\naction in respect of individual accounts may be taken keeping in view the peculiarities of the\nsituation involved. Also, it was observed from the feedback received that a number of banks are\nalready following some of the suggested measures in one form or the other in their NPA\nmanagement. The objective underlying the exercise is to evolve a common minimum\nframework to tackle this problem, whilst leaving the individual banks/ FIs free to formulate their3\nown internal policies. Nevertheless, it is expected that concerned institutions will work out their\nstrategic response in keeping with the broad thrust of these guidelines.\n(i) Early Recognition of the problem:\na. Recognise the problem early:  Invariably, by the time banks start their efforts to\nget involved in a revival process, it\u2019s too late to retrieve the situation - both in\nterms of rehabilitation of the project and recovery of bank\u2019s dues. Identification\nof weakness in the very beginning (i.e., when the account starts showing first\nsigns of weakness regardless of the fact that it may not have become NPA) is\nimperative. Assessment of the potential of revival may be done on the basis of a\ntechno-economic viability study. Restructuring should be attempted where, after\nan objective assessment of the viability and promoter\u2019s intention (and his stake),\nbanks are convinced of a turnaround within a scheduled timeframe.  In respect of\ntotally unviable units as decided by the bank/consortium, it is better to facilitate\nwinding up/selling of the unit early, so as to recover whatever is possible\nthrough legal means before the security position becomes worse.\nb. Recourse to the new ordinance:  The Government of India has promulgated an\nordinance on June 21, 2002, called \u201cThe Securitisation and Reconstruction of\nfinancial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Ordinance, 2002\u201d to\nfacilitate foreclosure of financial assets. In respect of totally unviable units as\ndecided by the bank/consortium, action under this ordinance may be initiated\nwithout any loss of time. Banks are also strongly encouraged to take immediate\nrecourse to this legal remedy where they encounter malfeasance on the part of\npromoters/borrowers.\nc.  Early Alert System:  The strategy for management of NPAs may be governed\nby the circumstances connected to each individual case. Generally, the NPA is\nmore likely to be resolved in terms of recovery if the company is in operation.\nFor this to be effective there must be a system of identifying the weakness in\naccounts at an early stage. Banks may put in place an \u201cEarly Alert\u201d  system that\ncaptures early warning signals in respect of accounts showing first signs of\nweakness. This system may be an integral part of the risk management process\nof the bank. Internationally, there is a similar system of \u201cSpecial Mention\nAccounts\u201d. Depending upon the identified weaknesses, one may go back (rather\nthan with reference to current period) to a prior or earlier period in determining\nthe rehabilitation response.\nd. Under the \u201cEarly Alert\u201d system, for internal monitoring purpose, banks may\ndesignate a time limit for overdue accounts to determine the threshold for a\nproactive intervention - well before the account becomes NPA. This is to enable\na bank to assess whether the default is due to some inherent weakness or due to a\ntemporary liquidity or cash flow problem, and accordingly calibrate its response.\nFor example, where there is a default in an account for 30 days, it may be shifted\nto a special category. Out of the accounts, ones that show promise may be\nconsidered for granting incremental facility for specific purposes, such as for\ncapital expenditure, by ensuring strictest possible end use of the money. All the\naccounts displaying unsatisfactory features/early warning signals should be put\nunder potential NPA list for follow up and time bound action to prevent their\nslippage. The account may be classified as potential NPA on account of one or\nmore of the following illustrative list of features even though the account may be\nregular:4\n1) Delay in submission of stock statement / Other control statements /\nfinancial statements.\n2) Return of cheques issued by borrowers.\n3) Devolvement of DPG instalments and non-payment within a\nreasonable period\n4) Frequent devolvement of LC and non-payment within a reasonable\nperiod.\n5) Frequent invocation of BGs and non-repayment within a reasonable\nperiod.\n6) Return of bills / cheques discounted.\n7) Non-payment of bills discounted or under collection.\n8) Poor financial performance in terms of declining sales and profits, cash\nlosses, net losses, erosion of net worth etc.\n9) Incomplete documentation in terms of creation / registration of charge /\nmortgage etc.\n10) Non-compliance of terms and conditions of sanction.\ne. Special Mention Accounts:\nA system of early recognition with timely and adequate interventions may form\nthe focus of approach in dealing with slippage of NPAs. In this context, it is\nsuggested that banks introduce a new asset category between \u2018Standard\u2019 and\n\u2018Sub-standard\u2019 for their own internal monitoring and follow up. This asset\ncategory may be in line with international practice of \u2018Special Mention Assets\u2019\nused by FDIC, U.S.A., MAS, Singapore, etc., while keeping in view the local\nrequirements. An asset may be transferred to this category once the earliest\nsigns of sickness/ irregularities are identified. This will help banks to look at\naccounts with potential problems in a focused manner right from the onset of\nthe problem, so that monitoring and remedial actions can be more effective.\nOnce these accounts are categorized and reported as such, proper top\nmanagement attention would also be ensured. Under off-site reporting, data on\npotential NPAs in terms of overdue position such as ( i) Loans and Advances\noverdue for less than two quarters and (ii) Loans and Advances overdue for less\nthan one quarter, are required to be submitted by banks on a quarterly basis.\nBanks already compile this data, which may be used gainfully by top\nmanagement to gauge the potential asset problems. However, introduction of a\n\u2018Special Mention\u2019 category of assets would be on the basis of not only overdue\nposition in the account but also other factors which reflect sickness/irregularities\nin the account.  Some banks which already have \u2018special mention\u2019 category (by\nwhichever name called) may continue the same on the basis of their internal\nnorms.\nA Special mention account may briefly have the following main characteristics:\n\u2022 The asset has potential weaknesses which deserves close management\nattention and which can be resolved through timely remedial action.\n\u2022 If left un-corrected, the potential weaknesses in Special mention assets\nmay result in deterioration of the repayment prospects and subsequent\nadverse asset classification.\n\u2022 Often a bank\u2019s weak origination/servicing policies are the reason behind\nclassification of an asset under the Special mention category though5\nthere may be cases where technical or other factors may also be\nresponsible.\n\u2022 Apart from continuing irregularities, \u201cspecial mention accounts\u201d may\nalso be categorised on the basis of factors such as inadequate cash flows\nand management integrity.\n\u2022 Special mention assets would not require provisioning, as they are not\nclassified as NPAs. Nor are these proposed to be brought under\nregulatory oversight and prudential reporting immediately. The step is\nmainly with a view to alerting management to the prospects of such an\naccount turning bad, and thus taking preventive action well in time.\n\u2022 As regards introducing a \u2018special mention\u2019 category as part of RBI's\n'Income Recognition and Asset Classification norms' ( IRAC norms), it\nwould be considered in due course.\n (ii) Identifying borrowers with genuine intent :\nIdentifying borrowers with genuine intent from those who are non- serious with no\ncommitment or stake in revival is a challenge confronting bankers. Here the role of\nfrontline officials at the branch level is paramount as they are the ones who have\nintelligence inputs with regard to promoters\u2019 sincerity, wherewithal, and capability to\nachieve a turnaround. Based on this objective assessment, banks should decide as\nquickly as possible whether it would be worthwhile to commit additional finance.\nIn this regard, banks may consider having \u2018Special Investigative Audit\u2019 of all financial\ntransactions/business transactions, books of accounts in order to ascertain real factors\nthat contributed to sickness of the borrower. Banks may have a panel of technical\nexperts with proven expertise and track record for preparation of techno-economic\nviability study of the projects of the borrowers.\nBorrowers having genuine problems due to temporary mismatch in funds flow or\nsudden requirements of additional funds may be entertained at the branch level, and for\nthis purpose a special limit to tide over such contingencies may be built into the sanction\nprocess itself. This will obviate the need to route the additional funding request through\nthe controlling offices in deserving cases, and help avert many accounts slipping into\nNPA category.\n(iii)  Timeliness and adequacy of response:\nLonger the delay in response (in fact, sometimes branch officials may have to act suo-\nmoto), greater the injury to the account and the asset. Time is a crucial element in any\nrestructuring/rehabilitation strategy. Further, the response decided on the basis of\ntechno-economic study and promoter\u2019s commitment, has to be adequate in terms of\nextent of additional funding, relaxations etc. under the restructuring exercise. The\npackage of assistance may be flexible, and where required, the bank may also look at the\nexit option.\n(iv)  Focus on Cash Flows:\nWhile financing, at the time of restructuring, banks may not be guided by the\nconventional Funds Flow Analysis only, which could yield a potentially misleading\npicture. Appraisal for fresh credit requirements may be done by analysing Funds Flow\nin conjunction with Cash Flows rather than only on the basis of Funds Flow.6\n(v)  Management effectiveness:\nThe general perception among borrowers is that it is lack of finance that leads to sickness\nand NPAs. But this may not be the case all the time. Management effectiveness in\ntackling adverse business conditions is a very important aspect that affects a borrowing\nunit\u2019s fortunes. Additional finance to an ailing unit may be committed by a bank only\nafter basic viability of the enterprise also in the context of quality of management is\nexamined and confirmed. Where the default is due to deeper malady, viability study or\ninvestigative audit should be done - it will be useful to have a consultant appointed as\nearly as possible to examine this aspect. A proper techno-economic viability study must\nthus become the basis on which any future action can be considered.\n(vi) Consortium/multiple financing:\na. During the exercise for assessment of viability and restructuring, a pragmatic\nand unified approach by all the lending banks/ FIs as also sharing of all relevant\ninformation on the borrower would go a long way toward overall success of\nrehabilitation effort. However, there is an element of risk in any restructuring\nexercise, given the probability of success/failure. One may expect a success rate\nof 50% in restructuring efforts, for it is unrealistic to expect 100% success rate.\nb. In some default cases, where the unit is still working, the bank should make sure\nthat it captures the cash flows  (there is a tendency on part of the borrowers to\nswitch bankers once they default, for fear of getting their cash flows forfeited),\nand ensure that such cash flows are used for working capital purposes. Toward\nthis end, there should be regular flow of information among consortium\nmembers. A bank, which is not part of the consortium may not be allowed to\noffer credit facilities to such defaulting clients. Current account facilities may\nalso be denied at non-consortium banks to such clients and violation may attract\npenal action. The Credit Information Bureau of India Ltd. ( CIBIL)  may be\nvery useful for meaningful information exchange on defaulting borrowers once\nthe setup becomes fully operational,\nc.  In a forum of lenders, the priority of each lender will be different. While one set\nof lenders may be willing to wait for a longer time to recover its dues, another\nlender may have a much shorter timeframe in mind. So it is possible that the\nlatter category of lenders may be willing to exit, even at a cost \u2013 i.e., by a\ndiscounted settlement of the exposure. Therefore, any plan for\nrestructuring/rehabilitation may take this aspect into account.\nd. Corporate Debt Restructuring  mechanism has been institutionalised in 2001 to\nprovide a timely and transparent system for restructuring of the corporate debts\nof Rs.20 crore and above with banks and FIs on a voluntary basis and outside the\nlegal framework. Under this system, banks may greatly benefit in terms of\nrestructuring of large standard accounts (potential NPAs) and viable sub-\nstandard accounts with consortium/multiple banking arrangements.\n(vii)  Legal and related issues:\na. Change in mindset regarding legal action: Legal action may be initiated once\nthe Banks/ FIs are convinced and have reached the conclusion that rehabilitation\nis not possible and there is no other way out. This will put pressure on the\nborrowers and will reduce the chances of depletion in the value of the security.\nIn this context, the new securities ordinance, as mentioned earlier, will go a long\nway in developing the culture of prompt repayment of banks\u2019 / FIs\u2019 dues. Under\nthis ordinance, substantial powers have been granted to the Banks / FIs for\nenforcement of securities without the intervention of the courts / tribunals.7\nSimilarly powers have been given to Banks / FIs to take over the management of\nbusiness of the defaulting borrowers. With these special powers a strong\nmessage is being sent to the borrowers of Banks / FIs across the country. Banks\nwould do well to capitalise on this message in dealing with recalcitrant\nborrowers and wilful defaulters.\nb. Banks may take recourse to criminal proceedings along with civil suit where\nmisleading information has been furnished influencing the bank\u2019s credit\ndecision. Also in case of value-less guarantees and diversion of funds, bank may\nnot hesitate to initiate criminal proceedings. Also borrowers may be asked to\ndeclare on oath their borrowings, assets, and all other material facts, which can\nbe the basis for criminal action in future, if details are not found to be correct.\nc. When considering a plan for the revival/rehabilitation, the lenders should retain\nthe right to exercise control over the ownership/ management.  This can be\ndone by ensuring pledge of promoter\u2019s shareholding to the lenders with a right to\nchange ownership if certain covenants/stipulations are not met.\n(viii)  Auditor\u2019s Responsibility:\nIn case any falsification of accounts on the part of the borrowers is observed by the\nbanks/ FIs, they should lodge a formal complaint against the auditors of the borrowers\nwith the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ( ICAI ) if it is observed that the\nauditors were negligent or deficient in conducting the audit to enable the ICAI  to\nexamine and fix accountability of the auditors.\nWith a view to monitoring end-use of funds, if the lenders desire a specific certification\nfrom the borrowers\u2019 auditors regarding diversion/ siphoning of funds by the borrower,\nthe lender should award a separate mandate to the auditors for the purpose. To facilitate\nsuch certification by the auditors, the banks and FIs will also need to ensure that\nappropriate covenants in the loan agreements are incorporated to enable award of such a\nmandate by the lenders to the borrowers/auditors.\n(ix)  Government relief:\nState Government relief (state tax waiver, subsidy etc.) in respect of accounts enjoying the\nsame takes long time to come, thus worsening the overdue position. There is a need to\nwork in the direction of cutting down/ reducing the time lag by closer monitoring.\nWhile it may so happen that circumstances warrant a different course of action, the above set of\nguidelines may be adhered to as a broader framework for preventing slippage of NPAs.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/38108.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jul 17, 2003", "info": "Directives on Interest Rate on Deposits under Non-resident\n(External) Rupee Account ( NRE Accounts)\nDBOD .

For the purpose of asset quality and credit concentration, the following  should also be\nreckoned for determining the amount of loans and advances and the NPAs and included\nin the disclosures at B above :\ni. Bonds and Debentures :  The bonds and debentures should be treated in the nature\nof advance when :\n\u2022 The debenture / bond is issued as part of the proposal for project finance and the\ntenor of the bond / debenture is for three years and above.\nand\n\u2022 The FI has a significant stake (i.e. 10% or more) in the issue\nand\n\u2022 The issue is a part of private placement i.e. the borrower has approached the FI,\nand not part of a public issue where the FI has subscribed in response to an\ninvitation.\nii. Preference Shares  : The preference shares, other than convertible preference shares ,\nacquired as part of project financing and meeting the criteria as at ( i) above.\niii. Deposits :  The deposits placed with the corporate sector .\n3. The   \u201c credit   exposure\u201d  shall   include  funded    and   non-funded   credit limits,\nunderwriting and other similar commitments. The sanctioned limits or outstandings\nwhichever is higher shall be reckoned for arriving at exposure limit. In case of term\nloans, however the exposure limit may be reckoned on the basis of actual outstandings\nplus undisbursed or undrawn commitments.\nHowever, in cases where disbursements are yet to commence, exposure limit should be\nreckoned on the basis of the sanctioned limit or the extent upto which the FI has entered\ninto commitments with the borrowing companies in terms of the agreement.\nFIs should include in the non-funded credit limit, the forward contracts in foreign\nexchange and other derivative products like currency swaps, options, etc as per the\nextant exposure norms.\n4. Capital funds for the purpose of credit concentration, would be the total regulatory\ncapital as defined under capital adequacy standards ( i.e.Tier I and Tier II Capital )\n5.

It was decided that Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would take up a study on the issue of\ngap between sanction and disbursement of loans under SGSY. Accordingly, a quick study had\nbeen conducted through eight Regional Offices of RBI at Chandigarh, Chennai, Guwahati,\nKolkata, Lucknow, Patna, Mumbai and Thiruvananthapuram to ascertain the reasons for\npendency of applications at bank branch level and the reasons for the gap between the sanction\nand disbursement of loans.  The salient features of the study are as per Annexe-I.\n2. It is observed from the findings of the study that banks and sponsoring agencies had not\nobserved the guidelines issued by Government of India/RBI in implementation of the  Scheme.\nFurther, the instructions issued by us do not appear to have percolated to the grass root level\nfunctionaries /bank officials and the lack of coordination between banks and Govt. agencies was\nhampering the smooth implementation of the scheme.   The study has brought out that there is a\nneed for greater synergies between banks and Government Extension Agencies.\n3. A parallel study in the North Eastern States to find out the reasons for poor off take of credit\nunder SGSY , revealed interalia , that the dismal recovery of loans under Government Sponsored\nSchemes and the poor law and order situation in the North Eastern Region were the reasons for\nthe poor off take of credit under SGSY  in this region. The salient features of the Special study\nfor the North East are as per Annexe II.\n4. You are requested to issue suitable instructions as indicated below to your controlling offices\nto ensure smooth implementation of the scheme.\n\u2022 The field level functionaries are to be advised to ensure that there is no inordinate gap/delay\nbetween the sanction of applications and disbursement of loans, which causes unnecessary\nhardship to the BPL borrower.\n\u2022 You may reiterate that the SGSY loan applications are disposed of within the prescribed time\nlimit of 15 days and at any rate not later than one month.2\u2022 The branch managers should be vested with adequate discretionary powers to sanction\nproposals under the SGSY scheme. The exercise of these powers should not require reference\nto any higher authority.\n\u2022 Steps may be initiated to ensure that documentation process is kept simple to avoid hardship\nto the beneficiaries and consequent delay in disposal of applications under the SGSY scheme.\nIncidentally, based on the recommendations of the High Level Committee on Agricultural\nCredit, the banks were advised, vide our circular PLFS.BC/58/05.05.16/98-99 dated January\n4, 1999 to take appropriate steps for introduction of the simplified forms and agreements as\nsuggested by the Indian Banks Association ( IBA).\nPlease acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(Dr.Deepali Pant Joshi)\nGeneral Manager\nANNEXE-I\nQuick study on gap between sanction and disbursement of loans under SGSY\nSalient Features\nThe study was geographically spread across 14 States including the seven North Eastern States\ncovering 35 districts and 144 rural and semi-urban branches of commercial banks. The target\ngroup comprised of 282 Self Help Groups and 577 individual beneficiaries financed under the\nscheme.\nObservations concerning Banks\nIt was observed that non-receipt of subsidy/delay in receipt of subsidy from DRDA (forming\n60% and 40% of the pending applications pertaining to groups and individuals respectively) was\none of the important reasons for the inordinate delay in disbursement of loans under SGSY. The\nother reasons were as under.\n\u2022 Complex and voluminous documentation.\n\u2022 Delay in grading the groups on account of their poor performance\n\u2022 Delay in obtention of \u2018No Dues Certificate\u2019 from other banks.\n\u2022 Delay in tie-up arrangement in case of dairy activity.\n\u2022 Cumbersome procedure in the bank such as insistence on the presence of borrowers\nrepeatedly in the branch for various formalities.\n\u2022 Pressure of work in the banks due to lack of manpower, annual closing, audit and\ninspection, etc.\n\u2022 Non-delegation of authority to the bank managers.\n\u2022 Some of the bank branches have not been conveyed the credit mobilisation targets.3\u2022 Lack of awareness among the dealing staff about the guidelines of the Scheme.\n\u2022 Lack of commitment, enthusiasm and participation on the part of banks due to poor\nrecovery performance of loans under the Scheme resulting in mounting NPAs.\nBanks have not adhered to the guidelines issued by the Government of India /RBI in\nimplementation of the Scheme as would be evident from the following findings of the study.\n\u00a7 Not maintaining proper Loan Application Register.\n\u00a7 Discrepancies in maintaining the Revolving Fund Account/Cash Credit Account,\nSubsidy Reserve Account and SHGs Account.\n\u00a7 Not adhering to the time frame prescribed by RBI for disposal of applications.\n\u00a7 Obtaining third party guarantee in several cases, which is in violation of RBI\nguidelines.\n\u00a7 Linking of assistance under SGSY to subsidy target.\n\u00a7 Charging interest on the subsidy portion and not maintaining the Subsidy Reserve\nAccount group-wise.\n\u00a7 Subsidy portion was kept in SB accounts and beneficiaries were paid interest.\n\u00a7 Giving the full benefit of subsidy to those applicants who have repaid the loan before\nthe lock-in-period.\n\u00a7 Not fixing the repayment schedule as per the guidelines.\n\u00a7 Opening individual loan accounts in the names of group members.\n\u00a7 No proper follow- up of the end use of the funds by the banks.\nObservations concerning Sponsoring Agencies\nOne of the significant observations made was that viable SHGs were not available for bank\nfinancing. This was attributed to various reasons, such as, failure on the part of DRDA to\nmobilise healthy/ active NGOs for the formation of groups. The study has also revealed the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Deficiencies in the project reports submitted by the Sponsoring Agencies for the key\nactivities.\n\u2022 Bunching of applications by the Sponsoring Agencies and submission of applications at\nthe fag end of the year.\n\u2022 Forwarding unviable and un-bankable proposals to the banks resulting in rejection of\napplications.\n\u2022 Key activities have not been identified and most of the applications pertained to similar\ntype of activity resulting in saturation of activity.\n\u2022 Lack of awareness of the scheme guidelines among Government Officials.\n\u2022 Submission of incomplete applications without any scrutiny.\n\u2022 Obtaining individual applications from the group members instead of one application\nfrom the group.\n\u2022 Not granting the subsidy as per the entitlement of the applicants.\n\u2022 Lack of co-ordination between Govt. agencies and bank officials.\nObservations concerning Beneficiaries4Some of the beneficiaries contacted under the study have stated that it took unduly long time in\nsponsoring their cases and they had to visit the office of BDO, several times (3-7 times).\nSome of the reasons for the gap between sanction and disbursement of loans under SGSY\nattributable to beneficiaries were as under:\n\u2022 Non-completion of formalities by the applicants due to illiteracy. (Forming 31% and 35%\nof pending applications pertaining to groups and individuals respectively)\n\u2022 Groups are not cohesive and not responding.\n\u2022 Change of activity by the Groups.\n\u2022 Most of the groups restrict their outstanding under cash credit account to the subsidy\nportion of Rs. 10000/- under the impression that the activity loan would be granted only\nwhen they clear cash credit facility.\n\u2022 Beneficiaries approaching the banks after considerable delay.\n\u2022 Delay in asset creation by the beneficiaries.\n\u2022 Lack of proper training and guidance from the Sponsoring Agencies and Banks has\nresulted in taking up unviable economic activities by the groups.\n\u2022 Unawareness among groups and individuals about the benefits of the Scheme.\n\u2022 Disposing of the assets ( Milch animals) by the borrowers.\nSuggestions for redress\n\u2022 Sensitisation of the rural and semi-urban branch managers should be undertaken.\n\u2022 Delegation of authority to branch managers for sanctioning of loans under Government\nSponsored Schemes.\n\u2022 Proper maintenance of Loan Application Register by the banks.\n\u2022 Involvement of NGOs and Sponsoring Agencies in completing the formalities.\n\u2022 Sponsoring should be planned/target fixed.\n\u2022 Forwarding applications in a phased manner and avoiding bunching of applications in the\nlast quarter of the financial year.\n\u2022 Introduction of Screening/Task Force Committee and phasing out of individual\napplications in favour of groups.\n\u2022 Timely release of subsidy.\n\u2022 More effective co-ordination between NGOs, BDOs and bank officials.\n\u2022 Creation of awareness of the scheme among BPL families and to motivate them to avail\nthe benefits of the scheme.\n\u2022 Due publicity of the Scheme should be given by the State Publicity Departments.\nBeneficiaries have suggested that there should be a single contact agency for them and\nbanks should not wait for the release of subsidy for disbursing loans .\nANNEXE-II\nNorth Eastern Region5The study covered  27 branches of commercial banks in 7 select districts of the States of Assam,\nMeghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura and 6 branches in 2 select districts of Arunachal\nPradesh and Manipur.  The findings of the study are enumerated below.\nReasons for the delay between receipt of loan applications and sanction\n\u2022 Bunching of applications by the Sponsoring Agency.\n\u2022 Non-completion of pre-sanction visit by the bank officials due to poor accessibility and\nsecurity reasons.\n\u2022 Incomplete documentation.\n\u2022 Non- availability BPL lists in the branches.\n\u2022 Shortage of staff in most of the branches.\n\u2022 Lack of awareness of the guidelines by both the Banks and Government Officials.\nReasons for the gap between sanction and disbursement of loans\n\u2022 Non-completion of formalities by the beneficiaries.\n\u2022 Non-release of subsidy by DRDA.\n\u2022 Beneficiaries not approaching the bank for availing the loan even after repeated\nreminders.\n\u2022 Shortage of approved suppliers of the machinery and goods.\n\u2022 Training programme not launched / not completed.\n\u2022 Beneficiaries wanted only subsidy and not the loan; the reason being that they could not\nmarket the products profitably resulting in likely default in repayment.\nReasons for the rejection of loan applications\n\u2022 Loan proposals were unviable/ un-bankable and lacked potential.\n\u2022 Beneficiary and /or his/her family were found to be defaulter.\n\u2022 Projects/schemes for which loans were sought were not properly drawn up or chalked\nout.\n\u2022 Beneficiaries were found to be entrepreneurs but sought loans for livelihood. No project\ndetails were submitted.\n\u2022 Formation of groups was less than six months.\nMost of the banks were reluctant to sanction loans under Government Sponsored\nProgrammes due to poor recovery of the loans leading to mounting NPAs .\nAdditionally, a special study had been conducted in the states of  Arunachal Pradesh  and\nManipur,  covering one district and 3 branches of commercial banks mainly for the purpose of\nfinding out the reasons for the poor take off of credit under SGSY in these two States. The\nreasons revealed by the study are as under:6\u2022 Difficulty in forming SHGs due to scattered location of households in the rural areas and\ntheir remoteness from the branches and lack of understanding by the Officials, both banks\nand Government on grading procedures of SHGs.\n\u2022 Limitations in identifying the key activities, which are economically viable (due to the\nexistence of peculiar land tenure system where there is no distinct individual holding\nrestricting transfer of holding.)\n\u2022 Reluctance on the part of banks to finance projects under SGSY due to bad recovery\nexperience under the erstwhile IRDP.\n\u2022 Lack of co-ordination between the banks and Govt agencies. The SGSY Committee has\nnot been constituted in the district.\n\u2022 In the State of Manipur no application had been sponsored during the year 2002-2003 to\nthe branches covered under the study.\n\u2022 The groups have not reached the stage of credit linkage.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/37624.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jul 08, 2003", "info": "Settlement in respect of Government  Securities Transactions-Compulsory  settlement\nthrough Clearing Corporation of India Ltd.\nBPD.PCB .

In terms of para 2 (iii) of this circular, urban co-operative banks were advised to take\nadvantage of non-competitive bidding facility provided to them for acquiring Government of\nIndia securities  in the primary auctions by the  Reserve  Bank of India.\n2. The Scheme  of Non-Competitive Bidding facility in the auctions of Government of India\ndated securities  has been  made  an  integral part of the auctions. Under this scheme, each  urban\nco-operative bank can bid upto  Rs. two crore (face value) in any auction   of  Government of\nIndia dated securities on a non-competitive basis through a bank or a Primary Dealer.The banks\ncan  even bid directly under this facility. For availing  of  this facility, no bidding skill is\nrequired, as allotment up to Rs. two crore (face value)  is given at the weighted average cut-off\nrate  which emerges  in the auctions. The details of the captioned scheme are  given in the\nAnnexure.\n3. In addition ,  UCBs  can also participate  directly  or through a bank or Primary Dealer  in the\nauctions of  State Development loans where  the coupon  is mostly  fixed in advance and notified\nby RBI. The auction is generally announced 4-5 days in advance  of the date of auction  and an\nadvertisement to this effect  is issued  in the leading newspapers. Further, half yearly  auction\ncalendar of Government of India securities is also issued by RBI.\n4. Please acknowledge  receipt to our concerned Regional Office.\nYours faithfully,\n( Sudarshan  Sen)\nGeneral Manager\nANNEXUREScheme for Non-competitive Bidding Facility in\nthe Auctions of Government Securities\nI. Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of Government\nsecurities it is proposed to allow participation on \" non-competitive \" basis in select  auctions of\ndated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-competitive bids up to 5 percent  of the\nnotified amount will be accepted in the auctions of dated securities. The reserved amount will be\nwithin the notified amount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated GOI\nsecurities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL) account with\nthe Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions:  Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks shall be covered\nunder this Scheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single bid for an amount not more than Rs. two crore (face value) per auction\n3. submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks that maintain SGL\naccount and current account with the Reserve Bank of India shall be eligible to submit their\nnon competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \"non-competitive\"\nbasis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies, institutions, provident\nfunds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI. The minimum amount for\nbidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in multiples in Rs.10,000 as hitherto for\ndated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent subsidiary general\nledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish to participate.\nHowever, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An undertaking to the\neffect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be obtained and kept on\nrecord by the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the aggregate\namount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name, amount, etc\nshall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the weighted\naverage rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the competitive\nbidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on the date of issue\nirrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from their clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of notified\namount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be the\nresponsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a\ntransparent manner.5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the shortfall\nwill be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the main SGL\naccount or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The facility for\naffording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing investors who\nare not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate clearly at the\ntime of tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be credited to their\nSGL account and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the main SGL account\nis permissible at the instance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to their clients.\nExcept in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients shall be\ncompleted within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as brokerage /commission/service\ncharges for rendering this service to their clients. Such costs may be built into the sale price\nor recovered separately from the clients. In case the transfer of securities is effected\nsubsequent to the issue date of the security, the consideration amount payable by the client to\nthe bank or PD would also include accrued interest from the date of issue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities, accrued\ninterest wherever applicable and brokerage/ commission/ service charges may be worked out\nby the bank or PD as per agreement with the client.

An undertaking to the\neffect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be obtained and kept on record\nby the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name,\namount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on the\ndate of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from their clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of notified\namount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be theresponsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a\ntransparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the\nshortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the main\nSGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The facility for\naffording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing investors who\nare not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate clearly at the time\nof tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be credited to their SGL\naccount and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the main SGL account is\npermissible at the instance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to their\nclients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients shall be\ncompleted within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such costs\nmay be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case the transfer of\nsecurities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the consideration amount\npayable by the client to the bank or PD would also include accrued interest from the date of\nissue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities, accrued\ninterest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be worked out\nby the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that no other costs such\nas funding costs should be built into the price or recovered from the client.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to operations under the\nScheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for from time to time within\nthe time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and accordingly, if and\nwhen considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/37527.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jul 08, 2003", "info": "Auction of Government of India Dated Securities\nRef.No .

The important instructions contained in the\nvarious guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India were also consolidated in circular\nUBD No. Plan.PCB.CIR41/09.29.00/ 2001-2002 dated April 20, 2002. A summary of these\ninstructions is given below:\n(i) Primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) should not undertake any\npurchase / sale transactions with broking firms or other intermediaries on\nprincipal -to-principal basis.\n(ii) UCBs should seek a scheduled commercial bank, a Primary Dealer, a\nFinancial Institution, another UCB, an insurance company, a provident fund or\na mutual fund as a counter-party for their transactions.  Preference should be\nfor direct deals with such counter -parties.  It will be desirable to check prices\nfrom other banks, relevant internet sites or PDs / banks with whom the bank\nmay be maintaining constituent SGL Account (CSGL).\n(iii) UCBs should take advantage of non-competitive bidding facility provided to\nthem for acquiring Government securities in the primary auctions conducted\nby the Reserve Bank of India.\n(iv) If a deal is put through with the help of broker, the role of the broker should be\nrestricted to that of bringing the two parties to the deal  together.  Under  no\ncircumstances, bank should give power of attorney or any other authorization\nto brokers / intermediaries to deal on their behalf in the money and securities\nmarkets.\n(v) Only brokers registered with NSE or BSE or OTCEI should be utilised for\nacting as intermediary .\n(vi) A disproportionate part of the business should not be transacted with or\nthrough one or a few brokers.  Banks should have a panel of approved brokers,\nwhich should be reviewed every year.  A limit of 5% of total transactions\n(both purchases and sales) entered into by a bank during a year should be\ntreated as the aggregate upper contract limit for each of the approved brokers.\n(vii) Brokers should not be used in the settlement process at all , that is, both fund\nsettlement and delivery of security should be done with the counter-parties\ndirectly. CSGL Accounts should be used for holding the securities and suchaccounts should be maintained in the same bank with whom the current\naccount is maintained. For all transactions, delivery versus payment must be\ninsisted upon by the UCBs.\n(viii) All transactions must be monitored to see that delivery takes place on the\nsettlement day. The funds account and investment account should be\nreconciled on the same day, before close of business.\n(ix) Dealing and back-office functions should be properly segregated. Officials\ndeciding about purchase and sale transactions should be separate from those\nresponsible for settlement and accounting.\n(x) All investment transactions should be perused by the Board at least once a\nmonth.\n(xi) The banks should keep a proper record of the SGL forms received / issued to\nfacilitate counter-checking by their internal auditors.\n(xii) The concurrent auditors should certify that the investments held by the bank as\non the last reporting Friday of each quarter and as reported to the Reserve\nBank of India are actually owned / held by it, as evidenced by physical\nsecurities or the custodian\u2019s statement.\n2. In the light of reports that UCBs are investing in certain ill iquid securities, though\nthey qualify for the purpose of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), it is reiterated that the UCBs\nshould strictly comply with the guidelines on transactions in securities issued by the Reserve\nBank of India. Further, while making investment in approved securities, the UCBs should\nadhere to the following additional guidelines:\n(a) In case a UCB proposes to buy the securities to meet its SLR requirements, the\nbank should ensure from the counterparties that the bonds they purchase are,\nand would continue, to have SLR status. They should also verify this from\nindependent sources, in case of doubt.\n(b) While investing in long term debt instruments, the banks should thoroughly\nsatisfy themselves about the terms and conditions of issue, namely, payment\nof interest and repayment of principal, and ensure that there are no clauses\npermitting the issuer for rescheduling such repayments.\n(c) The banks investing in non-SLR securities should take abundant precaution to\nsatisfy themselves about the financial condition of the entity issuing the\nsecurities. The banks could be guided by the audited balance sheet of the\nissuer, rating accorded by a recognised credit rating agency, etc. in this regard.\n(d) In order to avoid concentration of risk, the banks should have a fairly\ndiversified investment portfolio. Smaller investment portfolios should\npreferably be restricted to securities with high safety  and liquidity, such as,\nGovernment securities.3.    It is further reiterated that the banks should scrupulously adhere to the prudential norm of\n5% of the total transactions for routing through individual brokers, as stated paragraph 1(v)\nabove. The UCBs should also verify the antecedents of each broker before empanelling and\ndealing with him.\n4 The banks should ensu re that the transactions in securities are undertaken strictly in\nconformity with Reserve Bank of India guidelines. Any deviations from the guidelines /\ninstructions shall be viewed very seriously and would invite penal action as per the provisions\nof the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Cooperative Societies).\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this circular to our concerned Regional Office.\nYours faithfully,\n(K.V.

The GoI securities can be traded on the\nautomated systems of the National Stock Exchange ( NSE); The Stock Exchange, Mumbai\n(BSE) and the Over The Counter Exchange of India ( OTCEI). This Scheme is in addition to\nthe present Negotiated Dealing System ( NDS) of the RBI, which would continue to be in\noperation as hitherto.\n2.        In the trading system envisaged under the Scheme, t he trades concluded on the\nexchanges will be cleared by their respective clearing corporations/ clearing houses; hence,\nthe FIs will need to settle the trade either directly with the clearing corporations/ clearing\nhouses (in case they are clearing members) or through a clearing member custodian. The FIs,\nas institutional investors, would be able to undertake the transactions only on the basis of\nmaking / receiving delivery.\n3. With a view to facilitating participation of the FIs on the Stock Exchanges within the\nregulations prescribed by RBI, SEBI and the Exchanges, the FIs are being extended the\nfollowing facilities:\na) the FIs may open demat accounts with a  Depository Participant (DP) of\nNational Securities Depositories Limited ( NSDL)/ Central Depository Services\nLimited ( CDSL) in addition to their SGL accounts with RBI. (So far, the\nmaintenance of demat account for the Government securities, except the SGL\naccount, was not permissible for the FIs).\nb) Value free transfer of securities between SGL/ CSGL and demat accounts would\nbe enabled by PDO-Mumbai subject to operational guidelines being issued by\nour Department of Government and Bank Accounts ( DGBA) separately. (Value-\nfree transfer refers to the transfer of GOI securities from the SGL / CSGL\naccount to the demat account of the same party - which, therefore, does not\nrequire payment of any consideration).\nOperational Guidelines\n4. While the FIs should continue to follow the  guidelines, as amended from time to time,\ncontained in the Circular DBOD.FSC.BC.143A /24.48.001/91-92 dated June 20, 1992,2\nforwarded to them vide our DO No. FIC. 984-994/01.02.00/9-92 dated June 23, 1992 , the FIs\nare advised to ensure compliance with the following guidelines:\na) The FIs should obtain specific approval from their Board of Directors to enable\nthem to trade in the Government securities on the stock exchanges;\nb) The FIs should put in place enabling IT infrastructure, adequate risk management\nsystems and appropriate internal control systems for the trading / settlement of\ngovernment securities on stock exchanges. The back office arrangements should\nensure that the trading on the NDS/OTC market and on the stock exchanges can\nbe readily tracked for settlement / reconciliation purposes.\nc) The trades done through any single broker will continue to be subject to the extant\nguidelines on dealings through brokers.\nd) All trades should be settled either directly with clearing corporation / clearing\nhouse (in case they are clearing members) or else through clearing member\ncustodians. Brokers / trading members shall not be involved in the settlement\nprocess.\ne) At the time of trade, securities must be available with the FIs either in their SGL\naccount with the RBI or in the demat account with the depositories. Any sale on\n(T+3) basis on the Stock Exchanges cannot be covered by a purchase on the\nNDS/OTC market [even on (T+0) basis] and subsequent transfer from SGL\naccount to their demat account for effecting deliveries. Similarly, no sale is\npermitted on NDS/OTC on (T+0) basis against pay-in of securities expected on\n(T+0) on the Stock Exchanges.\nf) The purchase transactions by the FIs should similarly be subject to availability of\nclear funds in their settlement accounts at the time of pay-in.\ng) All pay-out of funds should invariably be out of clear funds, i.e. the pay-out must\nnot be contingent upon the outcome of any clearing to be conducted on that day.\n5. Any settlement failure on account of non-delivery of securities/ non-availability of\nclear funds will be treated as SGL bouncing and the current penalties in respect of SGL\nbouncing will be applicable. Stock Exchanges will report such failures to the respective\nPublic Debt Offices.\n6. The FIs should regularly report to their Audit Committee of the Board, the details of\ntransaction in Government securities, on aggregate basis, undertaken on the Stock Exchanges\nand particulars of any \"closed-out\" transactions on the exchanges.\n7.

Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(Rajesh Verma)\nGeneral Manager-in-Charge\nAuction of Government Securities:\nNon-competitive bidding facility to retail investors\nRef.No.IDMC.2769 /08.01.02/2001-2002.\nDecember 7, 2001\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks /All State Co-operative\nBanks/All Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative\nBanks/ All Primary Dealers\nDear Sirs,\nAuction of Government Securities:\nNon-competitive bidding facility to retail investors\nIt was announced in the 'Statement on Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2001-2002'\nthat in order to encourage retail participation in the primary market for Government\nSecurities, it is proposed to allocate upto a maximum of 5 (five) percent of the notified\namount in auctions of select dated securities for allotment to retail investors on a \"non-\ncompetitive\" basis at the weighted average rate.  Accordingly  the  scheme has been\nformulated. A copy of the Scheme is enclosed for your information.\n2. The scheme will be  operated  through banks and Primary Dealers.  The  retail\ninvestors will be allowed to bid through  a bank or a Primary Dealer in the auctions of dated\nGovernment of India securities as may be notified from time to time. Each bank or PD ,  on\nthe basis of firm orders from the retail investors,  will submit  separately a single customer\nbid  for allotment on non-competitive basis for the  aggregate amount on the day of the\nauction. The details of individual customers, viz., name , amount, etc. should be enclosed to\nthe bid application.\n3. Banks/ Primary Dealers are advised to formulate the modalities to assist the retail\ninvestors in bidding for the Government Stock under the aforesaid Scheme. Since this is an\ninnovative scheme, we shall be glad to have their suggestions for educating the retail clients\nand for giving adequate  publicity to  the Scheme.\nYours faithfully,\n      Sd/\n(H.R. Khan)\nChief General Manager4\nEncls  : as above.\nAnnexure\nScheme for Non-competitive Bidding Facility in\nthe Auctions of Government Securities\nI. Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of Government\nsecurities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d basis in select  auctions of\ndated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-competitive bids up to 5 percent  of\nthe notified amount will be accepted in the auctions of dated securities. The reserved amount\nwill be within the notified amount.\nII.        Eligibility:  Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated GOI\nsecurities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL)\naccount with the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs), Urban Cooperative Banks ( UCBs) and\nNon-banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs) shall be covered under this Scheme in\nview of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single  bid for an amount not more than Rs.one crore (face value) per\nauction\n3. submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs), Urban Cooperative Banks ( UCBs) and\nNon-banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs) shall be eligible to submit their non\ncompetitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI. The\nminimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in multiples in\nRs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent subsidiary\ngeneral ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish to\nparticipate. However, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An\nundertaking to the effect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be\nobtained and kept on record by the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz.\nname, amount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.5\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment\non the date of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from\ntheir clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of notified\namount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be the\nresponsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a\ntransparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the shortfall\nwill be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the main\nSGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The\nfacility for affording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of\nservicing investors who are not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would\nhave to indicate clearly at the time of tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts\n(face value ) to be credited to their SGL account and the CSGL account. Delivery in\nphysical form from the main SGL account is permissible at the instance of the\ninvestor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to their\nclients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients\nshall be completed within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as brokerage/commission/\nservice charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such costs may be built into\nthe sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case the transfer of securities\nis effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the consideration amount\npayable by the client to the bank or PD would also include accrued interest from the\ndate of issue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities, accrued\ninterest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be\nworked out by the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that\nno other costs such as funding costs should be built into the price or recovered from\nthe client.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to operations under the\nScheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for from time to time within\nthe time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and accordingly, if and\nwhen considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/37451.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jul 01, 2003", "info": "Master Circular \u2013 Miscellaneous Remittances From India\nAs on April 20,2004\nReserve Bank of India\nExchange Control Department\nCentral Office\nMumbai - 400 001\nMaster Circular .No.\nTo\nAll Authorised Dealers in Foreign Exchange\nMadam/Dear Sir,\nMaster Circular \u2013 Miscellaneous Remittances from India\nAs your are aware, the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 has been introduced with\neffect from June 1, 2000.

This should include all accrued income/expenses.\nb) Net Forward Position\nThis represents the net of all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid in the future as a\nresult of foreign exchange transactions which have been concluded. These transactions, which\nare recorded as off-balance sheet items in the bank's books, would include:\n( i ) spot transactions which are not yet settled;\n( ii ) forward transactions;\n( iii)guarantees and similar commitments denominated in foreign currencies which are certain to\nbe called;\n( iv )net of amounts to be received/paid in respect of currency futures, and the principal on\ncurrency futures/swaps.\nc) Options Position\nThe options position is the \"delta-equivalent\" spot currency position as reflected in the\nauthorised dealer's options risk management system, and includes any delta hedges in place\nwhich have not already been included under 3(a) or 3(b) ( i) and (ii).\n4.

Banks may, therefore, calculate the\noverall net open position as follows:\n(i) Calculate the net open position in each currency (paragraph 3 above).14(ii) Calculate the net open position in gold.\n(iii) Convert the net position in various currencies and gold into rupees in terms of existing RBI /\nFEDAI Guidelines.\n(iv) Arrive at the sum of all the net short positions ..\n(v) Arrive at the sum of all the net long positions.\nOverall net foreign exchange position is the higher of (iv) or (v). The overall net foreign\nexchange position arrived at as above must be kept within the limit approved by Reserve Bank.\n5.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of Government\nsecurities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d basis in select  auctions of\ndated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-competitive bids up to 5 percent  of\nthe notified amount will be accepted in the auctions of dated securities. The reserved amount\nwill be within the notified amount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated GOI\nsecurities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL) account with\nthe Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions:  Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks shall be covered\nunder this Scheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single bid for an amount not more than Rs. two crore (face value) per auction\n3. submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks that   maintain SGL\naccount and current account with the Reserve Bank of India shall be eligible to submit\ntheir non competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI. The\nminimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in multiples in\nRs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent subsidiary\ngeneral ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish to participate.\nHowever, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An undertaking to the\neffect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be obtained and kept on record\nby the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name,\namount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on the\ndate of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from their clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of notified\namount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be the\nresponsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a\ntransparent manner.5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the\nshortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the main\nSGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The facility for\naffording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing investors who\nare not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate clearly at the time\nof tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be credited to their SGL\naccount and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the main SGL account is\npermissible at the instance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to their\nclients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients shall be\ncompleted within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such costs\nmay be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case the transfer of\nsecurities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the consideration amount\npayable by the client to the bank or PD would also include accrued interest from the date of\nissue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities, accrued\ninterest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be worked out\nby the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that no other costs such\nas funding costs should be built into the price or recovered from the client.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to operations under the\nScheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for from time to time within\nthe time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and accordingly, if and\nwhen considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/37256.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 26, 2003", "info": "Auction of Government of India Dated Securities\nRef.No.IDMC.  5160      /08.02.30.01/2003-04\nJune 26, 2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks excluding RRBs/\nAll State Co-operative Banks/All Scheduled Primary\n(Urban) Co-operative Banks /All Financial Institutions/\nAll Primary Dealers\nDear Sirs,\nAuction of Government of India Dated Securities\nGovernment of India have offered to sale (re-issue) of \u201c 7.37   percent Government Stock 2014\u201d\nfor a notified amount of Rs.5,000 crore (nominal) through a price based auction using multiple\nprice auction method vide Notifications No. 4(8)-W&M/2003 dated June 26, 2003.

DBOD.BC.Leg . No.113 / 09.12.001/ 2002-03\nJune 26, 2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(Excluding RRBs and LABs)\nDear Sir,\nDishonour of cheques \u2013 Procedure thereof\nAs you are aware, in January 1992, banks were advised to implement the recommendation of\nthe Goiporia Committee that dishonoured instruments are returned / despatched to the\ncustomer promptly without delay, in any case within 24 hours (Ref.No.3.36 \u2013 our circular\nDBOD.No.BC.74/09.07.001/91-92 dated 28th January 1992).\n2. Pursuant to the investigation by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (the JPC) into the\nStock Market Scam, the JPC has recommended (in para 5.214 of its report ) that \"specific\nguidelines need to be issued by the Reserve Bank to all banks regarding the procedure to be\nfollowed by them in respect of dishonoured cheques from Stock Exchanges.\"  In the light of\naforesaid recommendations of the JPC, the extant instructions relating to return of all\ndishonoured cheques have been reviewed.\n3. We understand that banks are already following the appropriate procedure keeping in view\nthe above instructions to deal with the dishonour of cheques. However, it is considered\nnecessary to streamline the procedure to be followed by all banks in this behalf. It is therefore\nsuggested that in addition to the existing instruction in respect of dishonoured instruments for\nwant of funds, banks may follow the additional instructions laid down in para 4 of this\ncircular which could cover all cheques dishonoured on account of insufficient funds and not\nonly those relating to settlement  transactions of Stock Exchanges.\n4. I.  Procedure for return/ despatch of dishonoured cheques :\n(i) The paying bank should return dishonoured cheques presented through clearing houses\nstrictly as per the return discipline prescribed for respective clearing house in terms of\nUniform Regulations And Rules for Bankers' Clearing Houses. The collecting bank on\nreceipt of such dishonoured cheques should despatch it immediately to the payees / holders.\n(ii) In relation to cheques presented direct to the paying bank for settlement of transaction by\nway of transfer between two accounts with that bank, it should return such dishonoured\ncheques to payees/ holders immediately.(iii) Cheques dishonoured for want of funds in respect of all accounts should be returned\nalong with a memo indicating therein the reason for dishonour as \"insufficient funds.\"\n4.II Information on dishonoured cheques:\n(i)Data in respect of each dishonoured cheque for amount of Rs.1 crore and above should be\nmade part of bank's MIS on constituents and concerned branches should report such data to\ntheir respective controlling office / Head Office.\n(ii)Data in respect of cheques drawn in favour of stock exchanges and dishonoured should be\nconsolidated separately by banks irrespective of the value of such cheques as a part of their\nMIS relating to broker entities, and be reported to their respective Head Offices / Central\nOffices.\n4.III Dealing with incidence of frequent dishonour:\n (i) With a view to enforce financial discipline among the customers, banks should introduce\na condition for operation of accounts with cheque facility that in the event of dishonour of a\ncheque valuing rupees one crore and above drawn on a particular account of the drawer on\nfour occasions during the financial year for want of sufficient funds in the account, no fresh\ncheque book would be issued. Also, the bank may consider closing current account at its\ndiscretion. However, in respect of advances accounts such as cash credit account, overdraft\naccount, the need for continuance or otherwise of these credit facilities and the cheque\nfacility relating to these accounts should be reviewed by appropriate authority higher than the\nsanctioning authority.\n(ii)For the purposes of introduction of the condition mentioned at ( i) above in   relation to\noperation of the existing accounts, banks may, at the time of issuing new cheque book, issue\na letter advising the constituents of the new condition.\n(iii) If a cheque is dishonoured for a third time on a particular account of the drawer during\nthe financial year, banks should issue a cautionary advice to the  concerned constituent\ndrawing his attention to aforesaid condition and consequential stoppage of cheque facility in\nthe event of cheque being dishonoured on fourth occasion on the same account during the\nfinancial year. Similar cautionary advice may be issued if a bank intends to close the account.\n4.IV General:\n(i) For the purpose of adducing evidence to prove the fact of dishonour  of cheque  on behalf\nof a complainant (i.e. payee / holder of a dishonoured  cheque ) in any proceeding relating to\ndishonoured  cheque  before a court, consumer forum or any other competent authority, banks\nshould extend full co-operation, and should furnish him/her documentary proof of fact of\ndishonour  of cheques .(ii) Commencing from the first quarter of 2003-04 i.e. quarter ending June 2003, banks\nshould place before their Audit/ Management Committee, every quarter, consolidated data in\nrespect of the matters referred to at II above;\n5.Banks are also advised to adopt, with the approval of their respective Boards, appropriate\nprocedure for dealing with dishonoured cheques with inherent preventive measures and\nchecks to prevent any scope for collusion of the staff of the bank or any other person, with\nthe drawer of the cheque for causing delay in or withholding the communication of the fact of\ndishonour of the cheque to the payee/ holder or the return of such dishonoured cheque to him.\nBanks should also lay down requisite internal guidelines for their officers and staff and\nadvise them to adhere to such guidelines and ensure strict compliance thereof to achieve\naforesaid object of effective communication and delivery of dishonoured cheque to the payee.\n6.

Mathematically, delta is the partial derivative of\nthe option price with respect to the exchange rate.\n \u0394 = SC\n\u2202\u2202\n Where C is the value of the option and S is the underlying spot exchange rate.\n Under Black & Scholes model, the delta of European call options on a currency is\ngiven by\n \u0394 = e\u2013rfT N(d1)\n And for European put option on a currency,\n \u0394 = e\u2013rfT [N(d 1) \u20131]\n Delta Hedging\n As per the Black Scholes model it is possible to set up a riskless portfolio i.e. hedge\none\u2019s risk by taking a position in the underlying for a position in the derivative.\nExpressed in terms of delta, the riskless portfolio is:\n -1: Option\n +\u0394:USD/ INR\n The delta of an option changes with exchange rate. So to remain hedged, delta has to\nbe rebalanced periodically.\n \n Gamma\n \n The gamma, \u0393, of a foreign exchange option is the rate of change of the delta of the\noption with respect to change in the exchange rate. It is the second partial derivative\nof the portfolio with respect to the exchange rate:\n \u0393 = 22\nSC\n\u2202\u2202\n For European call or put option on a currency,\n \u0393 = e\u2013rfT N\u2019(d 1)  /  S o\u03c3T1/2\n Gamma hedging\n A small gamma indicates that the delta changes slowly and hence the adjustments to\nkeep a portfolio delta neutral are relatively infrequent. However, for large gamma the\nfrequency of adjustments is relatively higher. The Gamma of a portfolio can be\nchanged only using derivatives. A position in either the underlying itself or a forward\ncontract on the underlying has zero gamma and cannot be used to change the gamma\nof a portfolio.\n \n Vega\n 6\n The Vega of an option, V, is the rate of change of the value of the option with respect\nto the volatility of the exchange rate:\n V  = \ns\u2202\u2202C\n Here, \u03c3 is the volatility of the underlying exchange rate. Under Black Scholes model,\nthis would be estimated as the standard deviation of the lognormal returns of the\nunderlying FX price time series.\n Under the Black Scholes model, for European call or put option on a currency,\n V = SoT1/2N\u2019(d1) e\u2013r\nfT\n Vega hedging\n If Vega is high in absolute terms, the portfolio\u2019s value is very sensitive to small\nchanges in volatility. A position in the underlying asset or in a forward contract has\nzero Vega. However, the Vega  of a portfolio can be changed by adding a position in a\ntraded option. If V is the Vega of the portfolio and VT is the Vega of a traded option,\na position of \u2013V/ VT in the traded option makes the portfolio Vega neutral.\n \n Theta\n \n The theta of an option, \u0398, is the rate of change of the option with respect to the\npassage of time. Theta is also referred to as the time decay of the option. Theta is\nusually negative for an option (An exception to this could be an in-the-money\nEuropean call option on a currency with very high interest rates). This is because as\ntime passes, the option tends to become less valuable.\n Theta Hedging\n Theta is not the same type of hedge parameter as delta. There is uncertainty about the\nfuture stock price, but there is no uncertainty about the passage of time.\n \n Rho\n \n Rho is the rate of change of the option value with respect to the interest rate.\n r = rC\n\u2202\u2202\n In case of currency options, there are two rhos corresponding to the two interest rates.\nThe rho corresponding to the domestic interest rate is given by\n Call: r = X T e\u2013rT N(d2)\n Put: r = -X T e\u2013rT N(-d2)\n The rho corresponding to the foreign interest rate is given by\n Call:r = -T e\u2013rfT  So N(d1)\n Put:r = T e\u2013rfT  So N(-d1)\n Rho hedging\n Interest rate have comparatively lower volatility. For longer tenure options rho can be\nhedged using interest rate swaps ( MIFOR curve to hedge INR Rho and USD LIBOR\nswaps to hedge USD Rho).", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/37206.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jun 20, 2003", "info": "Investment Portfolio - Transactions in Securities - Audit Review and Reporting System -\nModifications\nRef DBS.FID No.C-16 /01.02.00/2002-03\n June 20, 2003\nThe CEOs of all-India Term Lending and Refinancing Institutions\nDear Sir,\nInvestment Portfolio - Transactions in Securities - Audit Review and Reporting System -\nModifications\nPlease refer to paragraphs 3.V(ii) and 3.V(iii) of the Circular DBOD.FSC.

Only personal remittances such as\nremittances towards family maintenance and remittances favouring foreign tourists visiting\nIndia are permissible. The system envisages a tie-up between reputed money transfer\ncompanies abroad and agents in India who would disburse the funds to the beneficiaries at\nongoing exchange rates. The system does not envisage the repatriation of such inward\nremittances. The India agent is also not allowed to remit any amount on account of exchange\nloss to the overseas principal.\n2.  The Indian agent who has to be an Authorised Dealer, Full Fledged Money Changer or\nregistered Non-Banking Financial Company ( NBFC), IATA approved Travel agents ( having\nminimum net worth of Rs.25 lakhs ) requires RBI approval to enter into such an arrangement.\nThe agent is allowed to open a special rupee account with an AD through which all the\nremittances disbursed under the scheme, are to be routed.

In the first phase, the Securities and Exchange\nBoard of India (SEBI) has decided to introduce anonymous order driven system for trading  in\nInterest Rate Derivatives ( IRDs) on The Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE) and National Stock\nExchange (NSE) .\n2. With a view to enabling Primary Dealers (PDs) to manage their exposure to interest rate risks, it\nhas been decided to allow the them to deal in IRDs in a phased manner. In the first phase, such\nentities can transact only in interest rate futures on notional bonds and T-Bills for the limited\npurpose of hedging the risk in their underlying investment portfolio. Allowing transactions in a\nwider range of products , as also market making will be considered in the next stage on the basis of\nthe experience gained.\n3. While derivatives present immense opportunity for mitigating the market risks inherent in the\nbalance sheet, it can also expose one to substantial losses on account of inadequate understanding\nof the product, absence of proper monitoring, poor risk control measures, etc. PDs desirous of\ntransacting in IRDs on the stock exchanges should take specific approval from their Board\ncovering, inter alia, the products that they may transact, size/composition of the investment\nportfolio intended to be hedged, organizational set-up to monitor, rebalance, report, account and\naudit such transactions. Further, it is desirable that derivative desks are created within the treasury\nand the management level responsibility clearly assigned.\n4. The following norms will be applicable for transacting IRDs on the Futures and Options (F &\nO) segment of the stock exchanges:\ni) Stock exchange regulation : PDs desirous of taking  trading membership of the Stock\nExchanges should satisfy the membership criteria and also comply with the regulatory\nnorms laid down by SEBI and the respective stock exchanges (BSE/NSE). Those not\nseeking membership of SEs can transact  IRDs  through  approved F & O members of\nthe exchanges.\nii) Settlement :\na) As trading members of the F&O segment, PDs should settle their derivative trades\ndirectly with the clearing corporation/clearing house.\nb) PDs participating through approved F & O members shall settle proprietary trades\nas a participant clearing member or through approved professional / custodial\nclearing members.\nc) Broker / trading members of stock exchanges cannot be used for settlement of IRD\ntransactions.\niii) Eligible underlying : For the present, only the interest rate risk inherent in the portfolio\nof government securities, unless categorized as Held to Maturity for accounting2\npurposes, can be hedged. For this purpose, the securities intended to be hedged must\nbe identified and carved out for monitoring purposes.\niv) Hedge criteria: Interest Rate Derivative transactions undertaken on the exchanges\nshall be deemed as hedge transactions, if and only if,\na) The hedge is clearly identified with the underlying government securities in\nthe investment portfolio.\nb) The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured\nc) The hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and is \u201chighly effective\u201d\nthroughout the period.\nv) Hedge Effectiveness  : The hedge will be deemed to be \u201chighly effective\u201d if at\ninception and throughout the life of the hedge, changes in the marked to market value\nof the hedged items with reference to the marked to market value at the time of the\nhedging are \u201calmost fully offset\u201d  by the changes in the marked to market value of the\nhedging instrument and the actual results are within a range of 80% to 125%. If\nchanges in the marked to market values are outside the 80% -125% range, then the\nhedge would not be deemed to be highly effective.\nThe hedged portion of the investment portfolio should be notionally marked to market,\nat least at monthly intervals, for evaluating the efficacy of the hedge transaction.\nvi) Accounting : The Accounting Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered\nAccountants of India (ICAI) is in the process of developing a comprehensive\nAccounting Standard covering various types of financial instruments including\naccounting for trading and hedging.  However, as the formulation of the Standard is\nlikely to take some time, the Institute has brought out a Guidance Note on Accounting\nfor Equity Index Futures as an interim measure. Till ICAI comes out with a\ncomprehensive Accounting Standard, PDs may follow the above guidance note\nmutatis mutandis  for accounting of interest rate futures also.  However, since PDs are\nbeing permitted to hedge their underlying portfolio which is subject to periodical mark\nto market, the following norms will apply\na) If the hedge is \u201chighly effective\u201d, the gain or loss on the hedging instruments and\nhedged portfolio may be set off and any net gain / loss treated as per the\naccounting practice adopted for the investment portfolio.\nb) If the hedge is not found to be \"highly effective\" no set off will be allowed and the\nunderlying securities will be marked to market as per the accounting practices\nadopted for the portfolio .\nc) Trading position in futures is not allowed. However, a hedge may be temporarily\nrendered as not \u201chighly effective\u201d. Under such circumstances, the relevant futures\nposition will be deemed as a trading position. All deemed trading positions should\nbe marked to market as a portfolio on a daily basis and losses should be provided\nfor and gains, if any, should be ignored for the purpose of Profit & Loss Account.\nPDs should strive to restore their hedge effectiveness at the earliest.\nd) Any gains realized from closing out / settlement of futures contracts can not be\ntaken to Profit & Loss account but carried forward as \"Other Liability\" and\nutilized for meeting depreciation provisions on the investment portfolio.3\nvii) Capital Adequacy  : The net notional principal amount in respect of futures position\nwith same underlying and settlement dates should be multiplied by the conversion\nfactor given below to arrive at the credit equivalent :\nOriginal Maturity Conversion Factor\nLess than one year 0.5 per cent\nOne year and less than two years 1.0 per cent\nFor each additional year 1.0 per cent\nThe credit equivalent thus obtained shall be multiplied by the applicable risk weight of\n100%.\nviii) ALM classification: Interest rate futures are treated as a combination of a long and\nshort position in a notional government security. The maturity of a future will be the\nperiod until delivery or exercise of the contract, as also the life of the underlying\ninstrument. For example, a short  position in interest rate future for Rs. 50 crore\n[delivery date after 6 months, life of the notional underlying government security 3\u00bd\nyears] is to be reported as a risk sensitive asset under the 3 to 6 month bucket and a\nrisk sensitive liability in  four years i.e. under the 3 to 5 year bucket.\nix) Use of brokers : The existing norm of 5% of total transactions during a year as the\naggregate upper contract limit for each of the approved brokers should be observed by\nPDs who participate through approved F & O members of the exchanges.\nx) Client Trades  :PDs who are trading members of the Stock Exchanges may have to put\nup margins on behalf of their non-institutional client trades. Such margins are required\nto be collected upfront from the respective clients. PDs are not permitted to pay up\nmargins on behalf of their client trades and incur overnight credit exposure to their\nclients. In so far as the intra day exposures on clients for margins are concerned, the\nPDs should be conscious of the underlying risks in such exposures.\nxi) Disclosures: The PDs undertaking interest rate derivatives on exchanges may disclose\nas a part of the notes on accounts to balance sheets the following details:\n(Rs. Crores)\nSr.No. Particulars Amount\n1 Notional principal amount of exchange traded\ninterest rate derivatives undertaken during the year\n(instrument-wise)\na)\nb)\nc)\n2 Notional principal amount of exchange traded\ninterest rate derivatives outstanding as on 31st March\n____ (instrument-wise)\na)\nb)\nc)\n3 Notional principal amount of exchange traded\ninterest rate derivatives outstanding and not \u201chighly\neffective\u201d (instrument-wise)\na)\nb)\nc)4\n4 Mark-to-market value of exchange traded interest\nrate derivatives outstanding and not \u201chighly\neffective\u201d (instrument-wise)\na)\nb)\nc)\nxii) Reporting: Primary dealers should submit a  monthly statement to IDM Cell as per the\nenclosed format.\n5. The above guidelines are subject to review based on the feedback and experience.\n6. These guidelines may be placed before the Board of Directors for formulating the policy,\nframework and appropriate risk control measures before the regulated entities undertake trades in\ninterest rate futures on the stock exchanges.\n7.

The hedged portion of the AFS/\nHFT portfolio should be notionally marked to market, at least at monthly\nintervals, for evaluating the efficacy of the hedge transaction.\nvi) Accounting : The Accounting Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered\nAccountants of India ( ICAI) is in the process of developing a comprehensive\nAccounting Standard covering various types of financial instruments including\naccounting for trading and hedging.  However, as the formulation of the Standard\nis likely to take some time, the Institute has brought out a Guidance Note on\nAccounting for Equity Index Futures as an interim measure. Till ICAI comes out\nwith a comprehensive Accounting Standard, SCBs and AIFIs may follow the\nabove guidance note mutatis mutandis  for accounting of interest rate futures also.\nHowever, since SCBs and AIFIs are being permitted to hedge their underlying\nportfolio which is subject to periodical mark to market, the following norms will\napply3\na) If the hedge is \u201chighly effective\u201d, the gain or loss on the hedging instruments\nand hedged portfolio may be set off and net loss, if any, should be provided\nfor and net gains if any, ignored for the purpose of Profit & Loss Account.\nb) If the hedge is not found to be \"highly effective\" no set off will be allowed and\nthe underlying securities will be marked to market as per the norms applicable\nto their respective investment category .\nc) Trading position in futures is not allowed. However, a hedge may be\ntemporarily rendered as not \u201chighly effective\u201d. Under such circumstances, the\nrelevant futures position will be deemed as a trading position. All deemed\ntrading positions should be marked to market as a portfolio on a daily basis\nand losses should be provided for and gains, if any, should be ignored for the\npurpose of Profit & Loss Account. SCBs and AIFIs should strive to restore\ntheir hedge effectiveness at the earliest.\nd) Any gains realized from closing out / settlement of futures contracts can not be\ntaken to Profit & Loss account but carried forward as \"Other Liability\" and\nutilized for meeting depreciation provisions on the investment portfolio.\nvii) Capital adequacy : The net notional principal amount in respect of futures position\nwith same underlying and settlement dates should be multiplied by the conversion\nfactor given below to arrive at the credit equivalent :\nOriginal Maturity Conversion Factor\nLess than one year 0.5 per cent\nOne year and less than two years 1.0 per cent\nFor each additional year 1.0 per cent\nThe credit equivalent thus obtained shall be multiplied by the applicable risk\nweight of 100%.\nviii) ALM classification: Interest rate futures are treated as a combination of a long and\nshort position in a notional government security. The maturity of a future will be\nthe period until delivery or exercise of the contract, as also the life of the\nunderlying instrument. For example, a short  position in interest rate future for Rs.\n50 crore [delivery date after 6 months, life of the notional underlying government\nsecurity 3\u00bd years] is to be reported as a risk sensitive asset under the 3 to 6 month\nbucket and a risk sensitive liability in four years i.e. under the 3 to 5 year bucket.\nix) Use of brokers : The existing norm of 5% of total transactions during a year as the\naggregate upper contract limit for each of the approved brokers should be\nobserved by SCBs and AIFIs who participate through approved F & O members\nof the exchanges.\nx) Disclosures: The regulated entities undertaking interest rate derivatives on\nexchanges may disclose  as a part of the notes on accounts to balance sheets the\nfollowing details:\n(Rs. Crores)4\nSr.No. Particulars Amount\n1 Notional principal amount of exchange traded\ninterest rate derivatives undertaken during the\nyear (instrument-wise)\na)\nb)\nc)\n2 Notional principal amount of exchange traded\ninterest rate derivatives outstanding as on 31st\nMarch ____ (instrument-wise)\na)\nb)\nc)\n3 Notional principal amount of exchange traded\ninterest rate derivatives outstanding and not\n\u201chighly effective\u201d (instrument-wise)\na)\nb)\nc)\n4 Mark-to-market value of exchange traded\ninterest rate derivatives outstanding and not\n\u201chighly effective\u201d (instrument-wise)\na)\nb)\nc)\nxi)   Reporting: Banks and Specified AIFIs should submit a  monthly        statement to\nDBS or DBS ( FID) respectively as per the enclosed format .\n5. The above guidelines are subject to review based on the feedback and experience.\n6. These guidelines may be placed before the Board of Directors for formulating the policy,\nframework and appropriate risk control measures before the regulated entities undertake\ntrades in interest rate futures on the stock exchanges.\n7.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of\nGovernment securities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-\ncompetitive \u201d basis in select  auctions of dated Government of India securities.\nAccordingly, non-competitive bids up to 5 percent  of the notified amount will\nbe accepted in the auctions of dated securities. The reserved amount will be\nwithin the notified amount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of\ndated GOI securities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL)\naccount with the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions:  Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks shall be\ncovered under this Scheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single bid for an amount not more than Rs. two crore (face value)\nper auction\n3.  submit their bid indirectly  through any  one  bank or PD offering this\nscheme.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks that\nmaintain SGL account and current account with the Reserve Bank of India\nshall be eligible to submit their non competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on\n\u201cnon-competitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies,\ncorporate bodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as\nmay be prescribed by RBI. The minimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000\n(face value) and thereafter in multiples in Rs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent\nsubsidiary general ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom\nthey wish to participate. However, an investor can make only a single bid under\nthis scheme. An undertaking to the effect that the investor is making only a\nsingle bid will have to be obtained and kept on record by the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer\nbid for the aggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual\ncustomers viz. name, amount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will\nbe at the weighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on\nthe basis of the competitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or\nPD against payment on the date of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD\nhas received payment from their clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount\n(5% of notified amount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial\nallotments, it will be the responsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately\nallocate securities to their clients in a transparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved\namount, the shortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL  form by RBI. RBI would credit\neither the main SGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as\nindicated by them. The facility for affording credit to the main SGL account is\nfor the sole purpose of servicing investors who are not their constituents.\nTherefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate clearly at the time of tendering\nthe non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be credited to their SGL\naccount and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the main SGL\naccount is permissible at the instance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the\nsecurities to their clients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of\nsecurities to the clients shall be completed within five working days from the\ndate of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients.\nSuch costs may be built into the sale price or recovered separately from theclients. In case the transfer of securities is effected subsequent to the issue date\nof the security, the consideration amount payable by the client to the bank or PD\nwould also include accrued interest from the date of issue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the\nsecurities, accrued interest wherever applicable and brokerage/ commission/\nservice charges may be worked out by the bank or PD as per agreement with the\nclient. It may be noted that no other costs such as funding costs should be built\ninto the price or recovered from the client.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to\noperations under the Scheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be\ncalled for from time to time within the time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and\naccordingly, if and when considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/36535.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 28, 2003", "info": "Auction of Government of India Dated Securities\nRef.No.IDMC 4676 /08.02.31.1/2002-03\nMay 28, 2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks excluding RRBs/\nAll State Co-operative Banks/All Scheduled Primary\n(Urban) Co-operative Banks /All Financial Institutions/\nAll Primary Dealers\nDear Sirs,\nAuction of Government of India Dated Securities\nGovernment of India have offered to sell (re-issue) \u201c6.85 percent Government Stock\n2012\u201d for a notified amount of Rs.6 ,000 crore through a price based auction using\nmultiple price method  vide Notifications No. 4(8)-W&M/2003 dated May 28, 2003.\nGovernment of India have also announced the sale  a new 25 year Stock for a notified\namount of Rs 3,000 crore (nominal) through a yield based  auction using multiple price\nmethod  vide Notifications No.4(8)-W&M/2003( i) dated May 28, 2003.

In pursuance of the recommendations made by  the\nCommittee set up by the Government of India [ Chairman : Shri Anant Geete, the  then  Hon.\nMinister of State for Finance (Expenditure, Banking & Insurance )] and in view of the\ndifficulties expressed by UCBs in managing  their short-term surplus funds while adhering to\nthis prescription, the matter has  since been  reviewed. In this connection, a reference is\ninvited  to para 111 ( copy enclosed) of the Governor\u2019s Statement on Monetary and Credit\nPolicy for the year 2003-04 announced on April 29, 2003. Accordingly ,  it has been  decided\nto permit non-scheduled UCBs to place deposits with strong scheduled UCBs, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n(a ) Only strong Scheduled UCBs complying with  following  norms can accept  deposits\nfrom other  non-scheduled UCBs  :\n(i) The bank is complying with the prescribed level of CRAR.\n(ii) Net NPAs of the bank  is less than 7%.\n(iii) The bank has not defaulted in the maintenance of CRR/ SLR requirements for the\nlast two years.\n(iv) The bank has declared  net  profits for the last three consecutive years.\n(v) The bank  has \u2018A\u2019 rating from  Co-operative Auditors for the last three\nconsecutive years.\n(vi) The bank  is complying with  prudential norms on income recognition, asset\nclassification and provisioning, exposure ceilings and loans and advances to\ndirectors.\n(b)  Acceptance of  deposits from non-scheduled UCBs by the scheduled UCBs  will also be\nsubject to the following conditions :\n(i) The total inter- UCB   deposits accepted by  a scheduled UCB should    not\nexceed 10%  of its  deposit liabilities as on 31st March of the previous\nfinancial year.\n(ii) The rate of interest offered  on such deposits should be market related.(iii) The total amount of deposits placed by a non-scheduled UCB with one\nscheduled UCB should not exceed 20% of its capital funds, so as to be in\nconsonance with  the extant exposure norms. The capital funds for the\npurpose shall include the funds as defined  in  our circular UBD. No. DS.\nPCB. 4/ 13.05.00 / 2000-2001 dated  August  25, 2000 read with UBD. No.\nDS.PCB.

It was indicated in the annual policy  Statement of April 2001 that UCBs would not be\npermitted to increase the term deposit balances with other UCBs and the outstanding deposits\nhad to be unwound before end-June  2002. In view of the difficulties expressed by UCBs in\nmanaging their short- term  surplus  funds while adhering to this prescription, it is proposed :\n\u2022 To  permit UCBs to place  deposits with strong scheduled UCBs           (other\nthan banks classified as weak or sick) with certain conditions.

Mahapatra  )\nChief General Manager\nGuidance Note\nThe Basel Committee had proposed to permit banks a choice between two broad\nmethodologies for calculating their capital requirements for credit risk. One of the\nalternatives is to measure credit risk in a standardized manner with the support of the ratings\nof external credit rating agencies. The other alternative is to allow banks to use their internal\nratings subject to the approval of the supervisor. To identify the rating agencies and map the\nratings, a suggested mapping of the ratings is enclosed along with the consultative document.\nAll banks in India will participate in the impact study under the Standardised Approach\nwhich will rely on the ratings awarded by the external credit rating agencies, where ratings\nare available. In case credit ratings are not available, these unrated have to be accord 100%\nrisk weight. Further details on the New Capital Accord, for the benefit of banks, are available\non the Bank for International Settlement web-site www.bis.org .  The general rules to be\nfollowed for filling in the data for the impact study are set out in the following paragraphs.\n2.  Operational guidelines for filling the workbook3The following may carefully be read to complete the excel workbook furnished along with\nthe circular and the guidance note.\n2.1 The Report on Capital Adequacy : This portion of the data is to track the increase or\ndecrease in the total risk weighted assets. The data is to be provided as on March 31, 2003\n(please see para 3 of the letter). The amount in Rupees is to be provided strictly in Crore  (\nupto two decimals).\n2.2 Risk Weighted Assets ( Section A):  This worksheet seeks information of the book\nvalue, margins and provisions, eligible financial collaterals, net book exposures, etc. The net\nbook exposures is arrived at by deducting total book exposures, margins & provisions and\neligible financial collateral.\n2.3 In the case of other debt securities and loans and advances, the data is to be\nfurnished excluding NPAs, loans to Retail sector.  Data on Retail sector and NPAs\ntreatment may be furnished under Section D.\n2.4 The credit mitigation technique: Paragraphs 90 to 179 of the Consultative Document\nmay please be seen for credit risk mitigation techniques.\n2.5 Operational risk :  Section E of the workbook seeks to evaluate the capital charge for\noperational risk under the New Capital Accord. In the Standardised Approach, banks\u2019\nactivities are divided into eight business lines. The business lines and their descriptions are\ngiven in Annex 6  to the Consultative Document enclosed. Within each line of business, gross\nincome is a braod indicator to denote likely scale of operational risk exposure within each\nbusiness line. The capital charge for each business line is calculated by multiplying gross\nincome by a factor given in the Section E.\n3.  The New Accord sets out the revisions to the 1988 Accord for risk weighting banks\u2019\nexposures. Exposures that are not explicitly addressed in the guidance note will retain\nthe current treatment .\n3.1       Individual Claims\n3.2 Claims on Sovereigns :\n3.2.1 Claims on Government of In dia, State Governments in India and RBI will\nreceive a concessional risk weight of zero per cent as per our extant guidelines.\n3.2.2 Claims to the extent guaranteed by the Central/ State governments will also\nreceive a lower risk weight as per extant guidelines.43.2.3 The above pertains to exposures funded in domestic currency. In the case of\nother currencies, claims on sovereigns as given para 27 to 29  may be applied for banks\nexposure.\n3.2.4 Claims on the Bank for International Settlements, IMF, World Bank, IFC,\nADB and the Central Banks of various countries would also attract a concessional risk\nweight of zero per cent.\n3.3 Claims on Banks :  It has been decided to adopt the risk weights as per option 1, in\nrespect of claims on banks . Under this option,  all banks incorporated in a given country will\nbe assigned a risk weight one category less favourable than that assigned to claims on the\nsovereign of incorporation. However, for claims on banks in sovereigns rated BB+ to B- and\nto banks in unrated countries the risk weight will be capped at 100%. While the rating as per\nthis option is given below in the table, the risk weight in respect of banks registered in India\nwill be 20%.\nCredit assessment\nof SovereignAAA to\nAA-A+ to\nA-BBB+ to\nBBB-BB+ to\nB-Below\nB-Unrated\nRisk weight 20 % 50 % 100 % 100 % 150 % 100 %\n3.4 Claims on securities :  The extant guidelines on risk weighting would be followed for\ninvestment in SLR securities. Investment in non- SLR securities will be treated as claims on\ncorporates as detailed below.\n3.5 Claims on corporates:  The table below illustrates the risk weighting of corporate\nclaims.\nCredit\nassessmentAAA to\nAA-A+ to A- BBB+ to\nBB-Below BB- Unrated\nRisk weight 20 % 50 % 100 % 150 % 100 %\n3.6 Claims included in retail p ortfolios: The claims that satisfy the following criteria will\nbe considered as retail claims for capital adequacy purposes and will be included in retail\nportfolio. Exposures included in this portfolio will be risk weighted at 75%. The claims are\nrequired to meet the four criteria to qualify for being reckoned as retail portfolio:5\u2022 Orientation criterion \u2013 the exposure is to an individual person or persons or to\na small business;\n\u2022 Product criterion \u2013 the exposure takes the form of any of the following,\nrevolving credits and lines of credit (including credit cards and overdrafts),\npersonal term loans and leases (installment loans, auto loans and leases,\nstudent and educational loans, personal finance) and small business facilities\nand commitments. Securities such as bonds and equities, whether listed or not\nare to be excluded from this category. Mortgage loans are excluded to the\nextent that they qualify for treatment as claims secured under the residential\nproperty.\n\u2022 Granualarity criterion \u2013 no aggregate exposure to one counterparty can exceed\n0.2% of the overall regulatory retail portfolio.\n\u2022 Low value of individual exposures \u2013 the maximum aggregate retail exposure\nto one counterpart cannot exceed an absolute threshold of Rs. 5 crore.\nFor details, please see para 44 of the extract of CP 3.\n3.7 Treatment of NPAs: When provisions in respect of a NPA reach 20 % of the gross\namount of NPA [total outstanding in the NPA account (including provisions etc.)], will\nattract a risk weight of 100 % instead of the 150 % risk weight bucket. In respect of a fully\nsecured NPA where provisions held reach 15% of the gross amount, the risk weight will be\n100%.\n3.8 Other assets:  The standard risk weight for all other assets will be 100%.\n3.9 Off\u2013balance sheet items: Off-balance sheet items under the standardized approach\nwill be converted into credit exposure equivalents through the use of credit conversion\nfactors. Commitments with an original maturity up to one year and commitments with an\noriginal maturity over one year will receive a credit conversion factor of 20 % and 50 %\nrespectively. Any commitments that are unconditionally cancelable, or that effectively\nprovide for automatic cancellation, due to deterioration in a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness, at\nany time by the bank without prior notice will receive a 0 % credit conversion factor. A 20%\ncredit conversion factor to trade finance letters of credit will have to be applied.\n3.10 Claims secured by residential property: Lending fully secured by mortgages on\nresidential property that is or will be occupied by the borrower, or that is rented will be6riskweighted at 35%. However, when claims are past due for more than 90 days, the risk\nweight will be 100%.\n3.11 Claims secured by commercial real estate: Mortgage on commercial real estate\njustify a risk weightage of 100 %.\n3.12 Operational Risk: In the standardized approach, banks\u2019 activities are divided into\neight business lines such as corporate finance, trading and sales, retail banking, commercial\nbanking, payment and settlement, agency services, asset management and retail brokerage.\nBanks are required to split gross income into eight different business lines and the average\ngross income for three years should be multiplied with the beta given in the workbook. If\nbanks cannot split gross income into the eight business lines, the gross income can be split\ninto the amount for traditional banking (commercial and retail) and others will be multiplied\nwith the beta given as an alternate approach.\nMapping of Ratings of Indian and International Rating Agencies\nCrisil Average One-Year Transition Rates (1993 \u2013 2000)\nRating Data\nPointsAAA AA A BBB BB BC &\nBelow\nAAA 154 96.8% 3.2%\nAA 500 2.8% 85.2% 10.0% 1.0% 0.4% 0.4% 0.2%\nA 759 3.3% 82.3% 8.8% 3.2% 0.3% 2.1%\nBBB 317 0.3% 5.7% 73.2% 11.0% 1.9% 7.9%\nBB 117 2.6% 58.1% 2.6% 36.7%\nB 16 62.5% 37.5%\nC & Below 32 100%\nICRA\u2019s   Average One-Year Transition Rates (1992 \u2013 2001)\nRating Data\nPointsAAA AA A BBB NI\nAAA 142 92.3% 7.0% 0.7%\nAA 287 1.7% 86.4% 10.1 0.3% 1.4%\nA 279 1.4% 83.5% 7.5% 7.5%\nBBB 133 0.8% 85.7% 13.5%\nNI 2.6% 58.1%\nNI \u2013 Non-Investment ( BB+ to D)\nMoody\u2019s Average one-year transition matrix7Initial\nRatingRating at year-end (%)\nAaa Aa A Baa Ba B Caa Default\nAaa 93.40 5.94 0.64 0 0.02 0 0 0\nAa 1.61 90.55 7.46 0.26 0.09 0.01 0 0.02\nA 0.07 2.28 92.44 4.63 0.45 0.12 0.01 0\nBaa 0.05 0.26 5.51 88.48 4.76 0.71 0.08 0.15\nBa 0.02 0.05 0.42 5.16 86.91 5.91 0.24 1.29\nB 0 0.04 0.13 0.54 6.35 84.22 1.91 6.81\nCaa 0 0 0 0.62 2.05 4.08 69.20 24.06\nStandard and Poor\u2019s Average one-year transition matrix\nInitial\nRatingRating at year-end (%)\nAAA AA A BBB BB B CCC Default\nAAA 90.81 8.33 0.68 0.06 0.12 0 0 0\nAA 0.70 90.65 7.79 0.64 0.06 0.14 0.02 0\nA 0.09 2.27 91.05 5.52 0.74 0.26 0.01 0.06\nBBB 0.02 0.33 5.95 86.93 5.30 1.17 0.12 0.18\nBB 0.03 0.14 0.67 7.73 80.53 8.84 1.00 1.06\nB 0 0.11 0.24 0.43 6.48 83.46 4.07 5.20\nCCC 0.22 0 0.22 1.30 2.38 11.24 64.86 19.798Suggested Mapping (based on Default Probability) -\nAgency\nCrisil ICRA Moody\u2019s S&PRisk Weight for\nCorporates\nStandardized\nApproach\n\u2013 Basel II\nAAA AAA Aaa to Aa AAA to AA AAA to AA- 20%\nAA AA A A A+ to A- 50%\nA A Baa to Ba BBB to BB BBB+ to BB- 100%\nBBB &\nbelowBBB & below B B Below BB- 150%\n- - - - Unrated 100%", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/36298.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 14, 2003", "info": "Tender for Non-competitive Bids\n(Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding Facility in Auctions of Government Securities)\n                                                         Annexure I (a)\n                                                         For office use only\nThe Regional Director,                     |------------------|\nReserve Bank of India,                     | Regn no.          |\nPublic Debt Office,                        |                  |\nFort,                                      |------------------|\nMumbai - 400 001.\nDear Sir,\nTender for Non-competitive Bids for \u201cFloating Rate Bonds, 2014\u201d\nfor an aggregate amount of Rs. 250 crore: Auction to be held on\nMay 19, 2003.\n    \n        Pursuant to Government of India, Ministry of Finance,\nDepartment of Economic Affairs Notification No F.No.4(8)\nW&M/2003 dated May 14, 2003 and the tender notice issued by\nyou, I/we, the undersigned hereby submit an aggregated bid on\nbehalf of the non-competitive bidders as per the enclosed list\nin pursuance of the \u2018 Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding\nFacility in the Auctions of Government Securities\u2019 at the\nauction to be held by you on the captioned date as set out\nbelow:\ni)   Name  of the Bank/Primary Dealer  /-------------------\\\nii)   Address                          /-------------------\\\niii)  Telephone No.                    \\-------------------/\niv)\nUnde\nrtak\ning\n1. \nO\nn\n your acceptance of my/our bid,\ni) I/we agree/undertake to immediately collect the letter of\nacceptance from your office and to deposit the requisite\namount at Reserve Bank of India, Fort, Mumbai on the\nday/time as indicated therein.\nii) I/We authorise you to debit my/our Current account\nmaintained with Reserve Bank of India with the requisite\namount.\n2.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of\nGovernment securities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d basis\nin select  auctions of dated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-\ncompetitive bids up to 5 percent  of the notified amount will be accepted in the auctions\nof dated securities. The reserved amount will be within the notified amount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated\nGOI securities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL)\naccount with the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions:  Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks shall be covered\nunder this Scheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single bid for an amount not more than Rs. two crore (face value) per\nauction\n3.  submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs) and Cooperative Banks that   maintain SGL\naccount and current account with the Reserve Bank of India shall be eligible to submit\ntheir non competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI.\nThe minimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in\nmultiples in Rs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent\nsubsidiary general ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish\nto participate. However, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An\nundertaking to the effect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be\nobtained and kept on record by the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name,\namount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on\nthe date of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from their\nclients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of\nnotified amount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will\nbe the responsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients\nin a transparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the\nshortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the\nmain SGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The\nfacility for affording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing\ninvestors who are not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate\nclearly at the time of tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be\ncredited to their SGL account and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the\nmain SGL account is permissible at the instance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to\ntheir clients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients\nshall be completed within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such\ncosts may be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case the\ntransfer of securities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the\nconsideration amount payable by the client to the bank or PD would also include accrued\ninterest from the date of issue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities,\naccrued interest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be\nworked out by the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that no\nother costs such as funding costs should be built into the price or recovered from the\nclient.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to operations\nunder the Scheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for from time to\ntime within the time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and accordingly, if\nand when considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/36258.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 14, 2003", "info": "Auction of Floating Rate Bonds, 2014\nRef.No.IDMC.    4503  /08.02.30.01/2003-04\n May 14, 2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks excluding RRBs/\nAll State Co-operative Banks/All Scheduled Primary\n(Urban) Co-operative Banks /All Financial Institutions/\nAll Primary Dealers in Government Securities Market.\nDear Sirs,\nAuction of Floating Rate Bonds, 2014\nGovernment of India have offered to sell \"Floating Rate Bonds, 2014\" vide Notification\nF.No.4(8)-W&M/2003  dated May 14, 2003 for a notified amount of Rs.5,000 crore (nominal)\nby auction.

Further, involving banks as\nSHPIs/ facilitators would help in credit linkage of groups which is one of the major\nobjectives of organising SHGs and crucial for economic empowerment and sustenance of\ngroups.\nPara 3.17\nRevolving Fund\nSHGs that are in existence for about six months and have demonstrated the potential of a\nviable group enters the third stage, wherein it receives the Revolving Fund from DRDA and\nbanks as a cash credit facility. The DRDAs may release subsidy, which is equal to the group\ncorpus with a minimum of Rs. 5000/- and a maximum of Rs. 10000/- linked with bank credit.\nThe banks would sanction credit which would be in multiples of the group corpus and could\ngo up to four times of the group corpus as cash credit facility based on the absorption\ncapacity and credit worthiness of the group.\nWithdrawn w.e.f May 13, 2022Subsequently, if it is found that the group has not been able to reach the micro enterprise\nstage and requires further financial support to continue in the micro finance stage for some\nmore time, performance of such groups may be got evaluated. In the evaluation if it is\nobserved that the group has been successfully utilising the revolving fund , they could be\nconsidered for sanction of further doses of subsidy fund up to a maximum of Rs. 20000/-\ninclusive of previous doses linked with bank credit.\nThe group corpus would be defined as the total amount available with the group inclusive of\ncash with the group, amount in Savings Bank account of the group, loans outstanding against\nmembers of the group and interest earned on the loans as well as deposits.\nThe subsidy of Rs. 20000/- released by DRDA will be adjusted against the loan at the end of\nthe cash credit period on the request of the group.\nPara 3.21\nPayment to facilitators/Self Help Promoting Institutions (SHPIs)\nWhere banks are involved as facilitators/ SHPIs, the amount towards the cost of social\nmobilisation, training and capacity building of groups may be decided in the State Level\nSGSY Committee keeping in view of the local need and requirements. Further, payment of\nthe cost of social mobilisation should be based on the stage of development of the group.\nPara 5.8\nTraining expenditure\nThe DRDA will be entitled to meet the expenses, incurred by the training institutions for both\nBasic Orientation and Skill Development Training from out of the SGSY Fund. However, the\ntotal expenditure on Basic Orientation and Skill Development Training will not exceed Rs.\n5000/- per trainee. This would include expenditure incurred on providing boarding and\nlodging facilities to the trainees, to and fro travelling cost from their place of residence to the\ntraining Institute, honorarium to master craftsmen/professionals/ resource persons, cost of\nraw material required for the training, reading material/ manual for trainees, institutional\ncharges (if any) etc. The expenditure to be incurred on above mentioned items may be\ndecided in the meeting of the district level SGSY committee based on the local prevailing\nrates.\nWe shall be glad if you will bring the enclosed amendments to the notice of your controlling\noffices/ branches and issue suitable instructions in this regard to them for necessary action.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(Deepali Pant Joshi)\nGeneral Manager\nWithdrawn w.e.f May 13, 2022", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/36349.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 07, 2003", "info": "Rejection Risk Insurance \u2013 Remittance - Liberalisation\nA.P.

Leg. No.BC. 104 /09.07.007/2002-03\nMay 5, 2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks / All India Financial Institutions\n(Excluding RRBs and LABs)\nDear Sir,\nGuidelines on Fair Practices Code for Lenders\nOn the basis of the recommendations of the Working Group on Lenders\u2019 Liability Laws\nconstituted by the Government of India, we have examined, in consultation with\nGovernment, select banks and financial institutions, the feasibility of introducing the Fair\nPractices Code for Lenders. The guidelines have since been finalised and banks/ all India\nFinancial Institutions are advised to adopt the following broad guidelines and frame the Fair\nPractices Code duly approved by their Board of Directors.\n2. Guidelines\n(i) Applications for loans and their processing\n(a) Loan application forms in respect of priority sector advances up to Rs.2.00 lakhs\nshould be comprehensive. It should include information about the fees/charges, if any,\npayable for processing, the amount of such fees refundable in the case of non acceptance\nof application, pre-payment options and any other matter which affects the interest of the\nborrower, so that a meaningful comparison with that of other banks can be made and\ninformed decision can be taken by the borrower.\n(b) Banks and financial institutions should devise a system of giving acknowledgement\nfor receipt of all loan applications. Time frame within which loan applications up to Rs.2\nlakhs will be disposed of should also be indicated in acknowledgement of such\napplications.\n(c) Banks / financial institutions should verify the loan applications within a reasonable\nperiod of time. If additional details / documents are required, they should intimate the\nborrowers immediately.2\n(d) In the case of small borrowers seeking loans up to Rs. 2 lakhs the lenders should\nconvey in writing, the main  reason/reasons which, in the opinion of the bank after due\nconsideration, have led to rejection  of the loan applications within stipulated time.\n(ii)  Loan appraisal and terms/conditions\na) Lenders should ensure that there is proper assessment of credit application by\nborrowers. They should not use margin and security stipulation as a substitute for due\ndiligence on credit worthiness of the borrower.\nb) The lender should convey to the borrower the credit limit along with the terms and\nconditions thereof and keep the borrower's acceptance of these terms and conditions\ngiven with his full knowledge on record.\nc) Terms and conditions and other caveats governing credit facilities given by banks/\nfinancial institutions arrived at after negotiation by lending institution and the\nborrower should be reduced in writing and  duly certified by the authorised official. A\ncopy of the loan agreement along with a copy each of all enclosures quoted in the loan\nagreement should be furnished to the borrower.\nd) As far as possible, the loan agreement should clearly stipulate credit facilities that are\nsolely at the discretion of lenders.  These may include approval or disallowance of\nfacilities, such as, drawings beyond the sanctioned limits, honouring cheques issued\nfor the purpose other than specifically agreed to in the credit sanction, and disallowing\ndrawing on a borrowal  account on its classification as a non-performing asset or on\naccount of non-compliance with the terms of sanction.  It may also be specifically\nstated that the lender does not have an obligation to meet further requirements of the\nborrowers on account of growth in business etc. without proper review of credit\nlimits.\ne) In the case of lending under consortium arrangement, the participating lenders should\nevolve procedures to complete appraisal of proposals in the time bound manner to the\nextent feasible, and communicate their decisions on financing or otherwise within a\nreasonable time.\n(iii) Disbursement of loans including changes in terms and conditions\nLenders should ensure timely disbursement of loans sanctioned in conformity with the terms\nand conditions governing such sanction. Lenders should give notice of any change in the3\nterms and conditions including interest rates, service charges etc.  Lenders should also ensure\nthat changes in interest rates and charges are effected only prospectively.4\n(iv) Post disbursement supervision\na) Post disbursement supervision by lenders, particularly in respect of loans upto Rs.2\nlakhs, should be constructive with a view to taking care of  any\" lender-related\"\ngenuine difficulty that the borrower may face.\nb) Before taking a decision to recall / accelerate payment or performance under the\nagreement or seeking additional securities, lenders should give notice to borrowers, as\nspecified in the loan agreement or a reasonable period, if no such condition exits in\nthe loan agreement.\nc) Lenders should release all securities on receiving payment of loan or realisation of\nloan subject to any legitimate right or lien for any other claim lenders may have\nagainst borrowers. If such right of set off is to be exercised, borrowers shall be given\nnotice about the same with full particulars about the remaining claims and the\ndocuments under which lenders are entitled to retain the securities till the relevant\nclaim is settled/paid.\n(v) General\na) Lenders should restrain from interference in the affairs of the borrowers except for\nwhat is provided in the terms and conditions of the loan sanction documents (unless\nnew information, not earlier disclosed by the borrower, has come to the notice of the\nlender).\nb) Lenders must not discriminate on grounds of sex, caste and religion in the matter of\nlending. However, this does not preclude lenders from participating in credit-linked\nschemes framed for weaker sections of the society.\nc) In the matter of recovery of loans, the lenders should not resort to undue harassment\nviz. persistently bothering the borrowers at odd hours, use of muscle power for\nrecovery of loans, etc.\nd) In case of receipt of request for transfer of borrowal  account, either from the borrower\nor from a bank/financial institution, which proposes to take- over the account, the\nconsent or otherwise i.e, objection of the lender, if any, should be conveyed within 21\ndays from the date of receipt of request.\n3.  Fair Practices Code based on the guidelines outlined in the paragraph 2 above should be\nput in place in respect of all lending prospectively, but not later than 01 August 2003. Banks5\nand financial institutions will have the freedom of drafting the Fair Practices Code, enhancing\nthe scope of the guidelines but in no way sacrificing the spirit underlying the above\nguidelines. For this purpose, the Boards of banks and financial institutions should lay down a\nclear policy.\n4.  The Board of Directors should also lay down the appropriate grievance redressal\nmechanism within the organization to resolve disputes arising in this regard. Such a\nmechanism should ensure that all disputes arising out of the decisions of lending institutions'\nfunctionaries are heard and disposed of at least at the next higher level. The Board of\nDirectors should also provide for periodical review of the compliance of the Fair Practices\nCode and the functioning of the grievances redressal mechanism at various levels of\ncontrolling offices. A consolidated report of such reviews may be submitted to the Board at\nregular intervals, as may be prescribed by it.\n5.  The adoption of the Code, printing of necessary loan application forms and circulation\nthereof among the branches and controlling offices should also be completed latest by end of\nJune 2003. The Fair Practices Code, which may be adopted by banks and financial\ninstitutions, should also be put on their website and given wide publicity.  A copy may also\nbe forwarded to the Reserve Bank of India.\n6. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(M.R.

In order to enhance transparency in\nbanks\u2019 pricing of their loan products as also to ensure that the PLR truly reflects the actual\ncosts, banks are advised to consider the following suggestions for determination of their\nbenchmark PLR:\n(a) Banks should take into account their ( i) actual cost of funds, (ii) operating\nexpenses and (iii) a minimum margin to cover regulatory requirement of\nprovisioning/capital charge and profit margin, while arriving at the benchmark\nPLR. Banks should announce a benchmark PLR with the approval of their Boards.\n(b) As is already the case, the benchmark PLR would continue to be the ceiling rate\nfor credit limit up to Rs.2 lakh.\n(c) Since all other lending rates can be determined with reference to the benchmark\nPLR arrived at as above by taking into account term premia and/or risk premia,\nthe system of tenor-linked PLR deserves to be discontinued. These premia can be\nfactored in the spread over or below the PLR.\nAs regards the effective date for discontinuation of the tenor-linked PLR the same will be\nfurther discussed with banks and a decision will be announced separately in due course.\n3.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of Government\nsecurities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d basis in select  auctions of\ndated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-competitive bids up to 5 percent  of the\nnotified amount will be accepted in the auctions of dated securities. The reserved amount will be\nwithin the notified amount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated GOI\nsecurities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL) account with the\nReserve Bank of India.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs), Urban Cooperative Banks ( UCBs) and Non-banking\nFinancial Companies ( NBFCs) shall be covered under this Scheme in view of their statutory\nobligations.\n2. make a single  bid for an amount not more than Rs.one crore (face value) per auction\na. submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions: Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs), Urban Cooperative Banks ( UCBs) and Non-banking\nFinancial Companies ( NBFCs) shall be eligible to submit their non competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-competitive\u201d\nbasis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies, institutions, provident\nfunds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI. The minimum amount for\nbidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in multiples in Rs.10,000 as hitherto for\ndated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1.It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent subsidiary general\nledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish to participate. However, an\ninvestor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An undertaking to the effect that the\ninvestor is making only a single bid will have to be obtained and kept on record by the bank or\nPD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the aggregate\namount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name, amount, etc shall be\nprovided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the weighted\naverage rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the competitive bidding.\nThe securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on the date of issue irrespective\nof whether the bank or PD has received payment from their clients.4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of notified\namount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be the\nresponsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a\ntransparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the sho rtfall will\nbe taken to competitive portion.\n6.Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the main SGL\naccount or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The facility for affording\ncredit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing investors who are not their\nconstituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate clearly at the time of tendering\nthe non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be credited to their SGL account and the\nCSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the main SGL account is permissible at the\ninstance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to their clients.\nExcept in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients shall be completed\nwithin five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as brokerage/commission/service\ncharges for rendering this service to their clients. Such costs may be built into the sale price or\nrecovered separately from the clients. In case the transfer of securities is effected subsequent to\nthe issue date of the security, the consideration amount payable by the client to the bank or PD\nwould also include accrued interest from the date of issue.\n9.Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities, accrued\ninterest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be worked out by\nthe bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that no other costs such as\nfunding costs should be built into the price or recovered from the client.\nV.Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to operations under the\nScheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for from time to time within the\ntime frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and accordingly, if and when\nconsidered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/36026.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 30, 2003", "info": "Auction of Government of India Dated Securities\nRef.No.IDMC.  4309   /08.02.30.01/2002-03\nApril 30, 2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks excluding RRBs/\nAll State Co-operative Banks/All Scheduled Primary\n(Urban) Co-operative Banks /All Financial Institutions/\nAll Primary Dealers\nDear Sirs,\nAuction of Government of India Dated Securities\nGovernment of India have offered to sale (re-issue) of \u201c 7.27   percent Government Stock 2013\u201d\nfor a notified amount of Rs.6,000 crore (nominal) through a price based auction using multiple\nprice auction method vide Notifications No. 4(8)-W&M/2003 dated April 30, 2003.\nGovernment of India have also announced the sale (re-issue) of \u201c6.30 percent Government Stock\n2023\u201d for a notified amount of Rs.3 ,000 crore (nominal) through a price based auction using\nmultiple price auction method  vide Notifications No. No.4(8)-W&M/2003( i) dated April 30,\n2003.

At present, banks can offer FCNR (B) deposits in foreign currency and non- resident  external\n(NRE) deposits in domestic currency to non-resident Indians. Both schemes  are now  fully\nrepatriable. Whereas  the  maturity  period in case of FCNR(B) scheme is 1-3 years, in case of\nNRE deposits, the minimum maturity is     6 months. Banks are free to offer fixed and floating\nrates in both the schemes. The interest rates on FCNR (B) deposits are subject to a ceiling of\nLIBOR / Swap rates for the corresponding maturities minus 25 basis points, and thus conform to\nglobal interest rates in foreign currency deposits in US dollars, pound sterling, euro etc. Similarly,\nthe interest rates offered by banks on NRE  rupee deposits are also more or less at par with\ndomestic interest rates on rupee deposits.\n85. In order to  provide uniformity in the maturity structure for all types of repatriable deposits\nwhether they are in foreign currency or in rupees, it is proposed  that :\n\u2022 The maturity period of fresh NRE deposits, with immediate effect, will be 1 to 3\nyears in line with FCNR (B) deposits.

Forward contracts, if cancelled,\nshall not be eligible to be rebooked for the same inflows and exchange gains, if any, on\ncancellation shall not be passed on to the overseas investor.\n2. Transactions denominated in foreign currency and settled in Indian   Rupees\nParagraph A of Schedule I to Notification No. FEMA 25/ RB-2000 dated May 3, 2000\nallows residents in India to book forward contracts in respect of transactions for which sale\nand/or purchase of foreign exchange is permitted under the Act or rules or regulations, directions\nor orders made or issued there under.\nHitherto, forward cover was not available in respect of transactions denominated in\nforeign currency but settled in Indian Rupees. It has now been decided to permit booking of\nforward contracts for hedging such transactions. These contracts shall be held till maturity and\ncash settlement would be made on the maturity date by cancellation of the contracts. Forward\ncontracts covering such transactions once cancelled, are not eligible for rebooking.\nAs in the case of all forward contracts, Authorised Dealers may obtain a declaration from\ntheir constituents while booking such contracts confirming that the underlying exposure had not\nbeen hedged earlier.\n3. Cross Currency Forward Contracts for balances in FCNR (B) Accounts2\nParagraph 2 (b) of Schedule II to Notification No.FEMA 25/RB-2000 dated May 3, 2000\npermits a non-resident Indian ( NRI) or Overseas Corporate Bodies ( OCBs) to enter into  forward\ncontracts with rupee as one of the currencies to hedge the balances held in Foreign Currency\nNon-Resident ( FCNR) accounts.\nIn order to facilitate better hedging opportunities to the holders of FCNR (B) deposits, it\nhas now been decided to allow deposit holders to book cross currency (i.e. not involving the\nrupee) forward contracts to convert the balances in one foreign currency to another foreign\ncurrency in which FCNR(B) deposits are permitted to be maintained, at the option of the account\nholder.

A technical and analytical review of macroeconomic and monetary\ndevelopments is also being issued as a separate document. This document\nprovides the necessary information and technical analysis in greater detail with\nthe help of simple charts and tables.\nI. Review of Macroeconomic and Monetary\nDevelopments during 2002-03\nDomestic Developments\n3.  The Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) recently released the latest\nestimates of national income for the year 2001-02. According to these\nestimates, the growth rate of real GDP in 2001-02 at 5.6 per cent was\nmarginally higher than envisaged earlier, i.e. 5.4 per cent.  This was mainly due\nto an upward revision in growth rates of the manufacturing, trade, transport and\ncommunication sectors.  Growth rate of the services sector was revised\nupwards from 6.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent and that of industrial sector from 2.9\nper cent to 3.2 per cent.  However, the growth rate of agriculture and allied\nactivities remained steady at 5.7 per cent.\n4. For the year 2002-03, the mid-term Review of Monetary and Credit\nPolicy released on October 29, 2002 had projected the GDP growth in the\nrange of 5.0 to 5.5 per cent taking into account available data on the\nperformance of the South-West monsoon.  The advance estimates for 2002-032\nreleased by the CSO in January 2003 has placed GDP growth at 4.4 per cent,\nwhich  reflects  an estimated decline in the output  from agriculture and allied\nactivities by as much as 3.1 per cent. The earlier projection in the Reserve\nBank\u2019s mid-term Review of October 2002 was based on a much lower decline\nof 1.5 per cent in agricultural output. The overall growth performance of the\nindustrial sector, as per CSO advance estimates, at 5.8 per cent is, however,\nmuch higher than that of 3.2 per cent in the previous year. The services sector\nis estimated to grow by 7.1 per cent as against 6.5 per cent in the earlier year,\nmainly on account of higher growth in construction, domestic trade and\ntransport sectors.  The CSO has also placed the growth of financing, real estate\nand business services sector at 6.5 per cent for 2002-03 as compared with 4.5\nper cent in 2001-02.\n5. The annual rate of inflation as measured by variation s in the wholesale\nprice index (WPI), on a point-to-point basis, remained below 4.0 per cent up to\nmid-January 2003 and rose thereafter to 6.2 per cent by end-March 2003\nmainly on account of increase in prices of non-food articles and mineral oils.\nDuring 2002-03, the prices of manufactured products (weight: 63.7 per cent)\nregistered an increase of 4.8 per cent compared with no increase in prices in\nthe previous year.  Prices of primary articles (weight: 22.0 per cent) showed an\nincrease of 5.9 per cent as against an increase of 3.9 per cent in the previous\nyear. Similarly, there was a higher increase of 10.8 per cent in \u201cfuel, power, light\nand lubricants\u201d group (weight: 14.2 per cent) as against an increase of 3.9 per\ncent a year ago.   Besides fuel items, the steep increase in prices of oilseeds,\nsugarcane and cotton have been major items in the overall price rise in\n2002-03. In the WPI basket, while some items are affected by drought\nconditions, others have sharply responded to external supply shocks.  The\nweight of such items, where prices have increased very sharply, works out to\n15.4 per cent.  Excluding the price increases due to such items (mineral oils,\noilseeds, edible oils, oil cakes and fibres) from the basket, the inflation rate3\nworks out to 2.7 per cent on a point-to-point basis at the end of March 2003 as\ncompared with 1.5 per cent last year.\n6. The annual rate of inflation in 2002-03 as measured by the increase in\nWPI, on an average basis, for the year as a whole was, however, lower than\nthat in the previous year: 3.3 per cent as against 3.6 per cent a year ago. On an\naverage basis, the annual change in consumer price index for industrial workers\n(up to February 2003) was identical to the previous year at 4.1 per cent.\n7. Monetary and cre dit aggregates for the year 2002-03 reflected the\nimpact of mergers that took place in the banking industry. During 2002-03, the\ngrowth in money supply (M 3) was 15.0 per cent (Rs.2 ,24,576 crore) as against\n14.2 per cent (Rs.1,86,782 crore) a year ago.  However, net of mergers, M 3\nincreased by 12.1 per cent (Rs.1 ,81,984 crore) which was well within the\nprojected trajectory. Among the components, growth in aggregate deposits of\nscheduled commercial banks ( SCBs) at 12.2 per cent net of mergers (16.1 per\ncent with mergers), was lower than that of 14.6 per cent in the previous year.\nThe expansion in currency with the public was lower at 12.5 per cent\n(Rs.30 ,263 crore) as against 15.2 per cent (Rs.31,849 crore) in the previous\nyear.\n8. An important feature of m onetary developments during 2002-03 was the\nlower increase in reserve money despite a sharp increase in foreign exchange\nassets of RBI. The increase in reserve money  during 2002-03 was 9.2 per cent\n(Rs.30 ,960 crore) as compared with an increase of 11.4 per cent  (Rs.34,659\ncrore) observed in the previous year.  While currency in circulation rose by 12.5\nper cent (Rs.31 ,338 crore) as compared with an increase of 15.0 per cent\n(Rs.32,769 crore) in the previous year, bankers\u2019 deposits with RBI declined by\n1.0 per cent (Rs.801 crore) as compared with an increase of 3.3 per cent\n(Rs.2,670 crore).  On the sources side, RBI\u2019s net foreign exchange assets rose\nby 35.7 per cent (Rs.94 ,275 crore) compared with an increase of 33.9 per cent\n(Rs.66,794 crore) in the previous year.  On the other hand, net domestic assets\nof RBI declined on account of a fall in both net RBI credit to government and4\ncredit to banks and commercial sector. Notwithstanding RBI\u2019s subscription to\nfresh government dated securities of Rs.36 ,175 crore, net RBI credit to the\nCentral Government actually declined by Rs.25,369 crore due to net open\nmarket sales of government securities of Rs.53,780 crore. RBI\u2019s claims on\nbanks and commercial sector also showed a fall of Rs.6 ,468 crore as compared\nwith a decline of Rs.9,575 crore in the previous year reflecting comfortable\nliquidity conditions.\n9. A favourable development during 2002-03 has been a sustained\nincrease in credit flow to the commercial sector reflecting industrial recovery.\nDuring 2002-03, non-food credit  of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs)\nregistered a high growth of 26.2 per cent (Rs.1 ,40,144 crore) and, net of\nmergers, it rose by 17.8 per cent  (Rs.95,599 crore), as against an increase of\n13.6 per cent (Rs.64,302 crore) in the previous year.  The incremental non-food\ncredit-deposit ratio during 2002-03 at 79 per cent is the highest recorded over\nthe last five years. This is indicative of the fact that a substantial part of lendable\nresources of banks has been deployed for productive purposes.  This is also\nborne out by the strong growth of 10.3 per cent in demand deposits in 2002-03,\nwhich is mainly used for working capital requirements. The increase in total flow\nof funds from SCBs to the commercial sector during 2002-03, including banks\u2019\ninvestments in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and\nprivate corporate sector, commercial paper (CP) etc., was also higher at 24.5\nper cent (Rs.1 ,51,569 crore) as against 12.7 per cent (Rs.69,483 crore) in the\nprevious year. The total flow of resources to the commercial sector, including\ncapital issues, global depository receipts ( GDRs) and borrowings from financial\ninstitutions was at Rs.1 ,88,262 crore as compared with Rs.1,42,082 crore in the\nprevious year.\n10. The feedback on industr y-wise credit flows received from banks for\n2002-03 (April-February) reveals that, at a disaggregated level, there was\nsignificant increase in credit to iron & steel, other metal & metal products, cotton\n& jute textiles, electricity, paper & paper products, fertilisers, drugs &5\npharmaceuticals, cement, gems & jewellery, construction, food processing,\ncomputer software, power and roads & ports.  On the other hand, decline in\ncredit was observed in coal, all engineering, sugar, tobacco & tobacco products,\ntelecommunications and petroleum.\n11. As a result of subdued procurement due to lower foodgrains production,\nand higher off-take of foodgrains, the buffer stock of foodgrains declined from\n54.5 million tonnes on March 1, 2002 to 36.2 million tonnes as on March 1,\n2003.  Consequently, there was a decline in food credit  of Rs.4 ,499 crore\nduring 2002-03 as against an increase of Rs.13,987 crore in the previous year.\nThe large buffer stock with the Government acted as a deterrent to price\nincrease of food items as also the general price level in the wake of severe\ndrought conditions witnessed during the year.\n12. According to the revised estimates in the Union Budget, the fiscal deficit\nof the Central Government for 2002-03 was Rs.1 ,45,466 crore as against the\nbudget estimate of Rs.1,35,524 crore. During 2002-03, net market borrowings\nof the Central Government at Rs.1 ,04,118 crore (gross Rs.1,51,126 crore) was\nhigher than the budget estimate by Rs.8,259 crore but lower than the revised\nestimate by Rs.8,747 crore. The state governments\u2019 net market borrowings of\nRs.13 ,622 crore for 2002-03 were supplemented by additional borrowings of\nRs.15,442 crore.  Although the combined slippage in the borrowings of the\nCentre and States was as much as Rs.23 ,701 crore, it did not exert undue\npressure on interest rates due to decline in the demand for food credit,\nreduction in CRR, comfortable liquidity position resulting from the foreign\nexchange inflows and judicious debt management by RBI.  As such, the\nweighted  average cost of government borrowings  through primary issuances\nof dated securities at 7.34 per cent during 2002-03 was lower by 210 basis\npoints than that of 9.44 per cent in the previous year.  While unfavourable\neffects of large fiscal deficits on the interest rate scenario have not so far been\nevident, it is necessary, in a medium-term perspective, to aim at fiscal6\nconsolidation and substantially lower fiscal deficits to facilitate efficient\nmonetary and debt management operations.\n13. During 2002-03, the state govern ments accessed the market for\nadditional borrowings for an amount of Rs.15 ,442 crore in two tranches. This\namount includes Rs.10 ,000 crore for the debt swap scheme mutually agreed\nbetween the Central Government and state governments towards repayment of\nhigh cost debt of States to the Centre.  Though repayment of high cost debt is\ndesirable, large borrowings for this purpose, in addition to high level of\napproved market borrowings for other purposes, put pressure on interest rates.\nThe timing of issuance and pricing of the securities also become difficult,\nparticularly during periods when there is a bunching of borrowing requirements\nfor various purposes. These difficulties are compounded if there are periodic\ndefaults by some States or their PSUs in meeting their guarantee obligations.  It\nis of utmost importance that overall borrowing requirements are kept at a\nreasonable level, and that all sovereign obligations, including guarantees, are\nfully honoured on time.\n14. As emphasised in various policy Statements, overall monetary\nmanagement becomes difficult when a large and growing borrowing programme\nof the Government  puts pressure on the absorptive capacity of the market. The\nbanking system already holds government securities of about 39 per cent of its\nnet demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as against the statutory minimum\nrequirement of 25 per cent. In terms of volume, such holdings above the\nstatutory liquidity ratio (SLR) amounted to Rs.1 ,95,974 crore in March 2003\nwhich is much higher than the gross borrowings of the Government. Further,\nsuch a scenario exposes banks to substantial interest rate risk which has\nadverse implications for sustained financial stability. In addition, the increasing\ninterest payments have raised concerns about the sustainability of a large\npublic debt. A reduction in fiscal deficit would release resources for\ninfrastructure and industrial financing, which in turn would help in realising the\nlong-term potential of the economy.  Fiscal consolidation will also have a7\nfavourable effect on inflationary expectations and hence on the interest rate\nscenario in the economy.\n15. The two-way movement in interest rates during 2002- 03, has confirmed\nthat banks should in their interest take steps to build up investment fluctuation\nreserves in a smooth and phased manner for better risk management.  It may\nbe recalled that in January 2002, RBI proposed that banks should build up\ninvestment fluctuation reserve (IFR)  to a minimum of 5 per cent of their\ninvestment portfolio under the \u201cheld for trading\u201d and \u201cavailable for sale\u201d\ncategories, by transferring the gains realised on sale of investments within a\nperiod of five years.  They were also advised to make adequate provisions for\nunforeseen contingencies in their business plans, and to fully take into account\nthe implications of changes in the monetary and external environment on their\noperations.  In the light of their own risk assessment, banks are free to build up\nhigher percentage of IFR up to 10 per cent of their portfolio depending on the\nsize and composition of their portfolio, with the concurrence of their Boards.\n16. The monetary policy stance in recent years has underlined the Reserve\nBank\u2019s commitment to maintain adequate liquidity  in the market with a\npreference for soft interest rates  to the extent the evolving situation warrants.\nDuring 2002-03, it was possible to maintain adequate liquidity on account of\nsustained inflows of foreign exchange and decline in demand for food credit.\nAs the inflationary situation remained benign for the most part of the year, it was\nfeasible to maintain a soft interest rate environment despite a high level of\ngovernment borrowing.  This is evident from the fact that the call money rate\ndeclined from 6.97 per cent in March 2002 to 5.86 per cent by March 2003.\nThe discount rate of prime-rated CP (61-90 days) showed an even sharper\ndecline by 302 basis points from 9.02 per cent to 6.00 per cent between March\n2002 and March 2003.  The cut-off yields on 91-day and 364-day Treasury Bills\ndeclined from 6.13 per cent and 6.16 per cent, respectively, in March 2002 to\n5.89 per cent each by March 2003.  An interesting development during the year8\nhas been that the interest rates in money market instruments converged to a\nnarrow band of 5.5 to 6.0 per cent reflecting easy liquidity conditions.\n17. There was also a distinct downward drift in secondary market  yields  on\ngovernment securities across the maturity spectrum during the year. The yield\non government securities with 1-year residual maturity declined by 60 basis\npoints from 6.10 per cent in March 2002 to 5.50 per cent by March 2003.  There\nwas a sharper decline of 115 basis points in yield on government securities with\n10-year residual maturity from 7.36 per cent in March 2002 to 6.21 per cent by\nMarch 2003.  The term structure of interest rates reveals a flattening of the yield\ncurve with long-term interest rates declining more sharply than the short-term\nrates.  For example, the spread between the yields on 10-year government\nsecurities and 91-day Treasury Bills narrowed from 123 basis points in March\n2002 to 32 basis points by March 2003 reflecting moderation of inflationary\nexpectations.\n18. Interestingly, yields on non-government bonds  witnessed a sharper\nreduction than yields on government securities during 2002-03, and yields on\nsuch bonds are now closer to sovereign bonds than was the case earlier.  For\nexample, the spread between the prime-rated CP (61-90 days) and 91-day\nTreasury Bills narrowed from 289 basis points in March 2002 to 11 basis points\nby March 2003.  In the case of longer maturities also, the risk premium on the\nprivate sector bonds has fallen sharply as measured by the yield spread\nbetween highly rated corporate paper and government securities for residual\nmaturity of 5 years.  For example, the spread between AAA-rated corporate\nbonds and the yield on government securities narrowed from about 177 basis\npoints in March 2002 to about 87 basis points by March 2003.\n19. It is necessary to impart greater flexibility to the interest rate structure in\nIndia consistent with the underlying macroeconomic conditions. Further\nprogress in this direction could be made if banks move over to a variable\ninterest rate structure  on longer term deposits as early as possible.  Since\ninterest rates could vary in both directions, depending on the phase of business9\ncycle and inflationary outlook, a variable interest rate regime on long-term\ndeposits does not necessarily imply lowering of the average interest rate earned\nby depositors over a period of time (as compared with a fixed rate regime,\nwhich favours old deposits over new deposits when interest rates are coming\ndown, and vice versa  when rates are moving in the opposite direction).  In\naddition, banks need to reduce their operating costs over time by improving\nproductivity and increasing their volume of lending.  This should be possible\nwith proper upgradation of technology in areas which, at present, are\ncontributing to higher costs because of relatively low productivity.\n20. The term  deposit rates of public sector banks for maturities up to 1-year\nmoved down from a range of 4.25-7.50 per cent in March 2002 to 4.00-6.00 per\ncent by March 2003.  The reduction in deposit rates was more pronounced for\nlonger term deposits as the public sector banks have reduced their deposit\nrates above 1-year from a range of 7.25-8.75 per cent in March 2002 to\n5.25-7.00 per cent by March 2003.  While the typical short-term deposit rate\n(15-29 days) of the public sector banks declined by 50 basis points during\n2002-03, the rate for longer term deposits (over 3 years) declined by as much\nas 200 basis points.  As a result, there has been a flattening of the term\nstructure of deposit rates.  The typical interest rate on 3-month and 1-year\ncertificates of deposit (CDs) also declined from 7.38 per cent and 10.0 per cent\nin March 2002 to 5.25 per cent and 5.75 per cent, respectively, by March 2003.\n21. In consonance with lower cost of funds, banks have reduced their prime\nlending rates  (PLRs).  The PLRs of public sector banks declined from a range\nof 10.0-12.5 per cent in March 2002 to 9.0-12.25 per cent by March 2003.  The\npublic sector banks reduced their PLRs in the range of 25-125 basis points,\nprivate sector banks by 50-225 basis points and foreign banks by 15-325 basis\npoints.  The number of public sector banks whose PLR was 11.5 per cent or\nbelow, has gone up from 10 to 22 between March 2002 and March 2003.\n22.  In the present interest rate environment, it is not reasonable to keep\nvery high spreads over PLR.  In the annual policy Statement of April 2002, RBI10\nhad urged banks to review their spreads over  PLR and reduce them wherever\nthey were unreasonably high.  In response, a number of banks have reduced\ntheir spreads over PLR. The number of banks charging maximum spread of\nless than 4 per cent over PLR increased from 2 in March 2002 to 15 by March\n2003 in the case of public sector banks, from 5 to 12 in the case of private\nsector banks and from 12 to 14 in the case of foreign banks.  One major public\nsector bank has reduced the maximum spread over PLR to 2.5 per cent.\n23. In recent years, there has been a persistent downward trend in the\ninterest rate structure  reflecting moderation of inflationary expectations and\ncomfortable liquidity situation.  Changes in policy rates reflected the overall\nsoftening of interest rates as the Bank Rate has been reduced in stages from\n8.0 per cent in July 2000 to 6.25 per cent by October 2002, which is the lowest\nrate since May 1973.  Similarly, the repo rate has been moderated from 8.0 per\ncent in March 1999 to 5.0 per cent by March 2003.  Simultaneously, the\nweighted average call money rate has come down from over 13.06 per cent in\nAugust 2000 to 5.86 per cent by March 2003.\n24. In the annual policy Statement of 2002, RBI had spelt out its in tention of\ncollecting the maximum and minimum interest rates  on credit advanced by\nbanks and place the same in public domain with a view to enhancing\ntransparency.  Accordingly, bank-wise lending rates have been placed on the\nRBI website ( www.rbi.org.in ) for the quarters ended June, September and\nDecember 2002.\n25. Liberalisation in the domestic economy combined with the increasing\nintegration of the domestic markets with the international financial market poses\nnew challenges for monetary management. It involves constant monitoring of\nboth domestic and international indicators and fine-tuning of policies in line with\nthe evolving conditions. Though the overall monetary conditions  are at\npresent comfortable in the light of moderate inflation, easy liquidity and soft\ninterest rate environment, the Reserve Bank will continue to keep a constant\nwatch on the domestic and external situation to conduct its monetary11\nmanagement and also to provide more robustness to the country\u2019s financial\narchitecture.\nExternal Developments\n26. According to the latest estimates of the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF), the growth rate for the world economy in 2002 was slightly higher than\nestimated earlier (3.0 per cent as against 2.8 per cent).  For the current year\n2003, IMF has projected a growth rate of 3.2 per cent for the world economy .\nThe growth in volume of world trade is projected to pick up from 2.9 per cent in\n2002 to 4.3 per cent in 2003.\n27. The uncertainty regarding the econom ic outlook, however, remains high\ndue to the ongoing geopolitical tensions.  Its adverse impact on the oil markets\ncould have a negative impact on economic activity throughout the world,\nparticularly on oil importing emerging markets.\n28. An important le sson emerging from the disturbances in the global\nfinancial market last year has been the role of sound macroeconomic policies\nand financial sector reforms in strengthening the resilience of the financial\nsector to external shocks. In addition to increasing the effectiveness of the\nsystem, efficient regulatory environment and good disclosure norms constitute\nthe crucial confidence-building measures for the financial sector.\nMacroeconomic policies will have to continue to focus on strengthening the\nfundamentals of the economy, financial stabilisation and promoting good\ncorporate governance to aid the long-run welfare gains.\n29. Despite adverse external developments, India\u2019s foreign exchange\nreserves continued to record healthy growth during 2002-03 on account of\nimprovement in the current account as well as strong capital and other inflows.\nIndia\u2019s foreign exchange  reserves  increased by as much as US $ 21.3 billion\nfrom US $ 54.1 billion in end-March 2002 to US $ 75.4 billion by end-March\n2003. Of these, foreign currency assets rose by US $ 20.8 billion. This is the12\nhighest increase recorded in a single year and has occurred despite substantial\nincrease in the international oil prices and other unfavourable developments,\nlike lower international capital flows to developing countries during the period.\n30. It may be noted that major sources of foreign exchange reserves\nduring the current fiscal year have been: (a) surplus in current account,\n(b) increase in other capital and (c) valuation changes in reserves.  A recent\nstudy by RBI has revealed that, contrary to popular impression, there is no\nevidence to show that available arbitrage opportunities have caused the\naccretion to foreign exchange reserves.  Almost the entire addition to reserves,\nin the last few years, has been made without increasing the overall level of\nexternal debt.  The cost of accretion to reserves has also not been found to be\nvery significant, as most of the increase is due to non-debt inflows.\n31. In recent years, the annua l policy Statements as well as mid-term\nReviews have attempted to bring into sharper focus the main lessons emerging\nfrom our experience in managing the external sector during periods of external\nand domestic uncertainties.  The recent experience has once again highlighted\nthe need for developing countries to keep a continuous vigil on market\ndevelopments, and the importance of building adequate safety nets that can\nwithstand the effects of unexpected shocks and market uncertainties.  In this\ncontext, India\u2019s current exchange rate policy  seems to have stood the test of\ntime.  It has focused on the management of volatility without  a fixed rate target\nand the underlying demand and supply conditions are allowed to determine the\nexchange rate movements over a period in an orderly way.  Despite several\nunexpected adverse developments on the external and domestic front, India\u2019s\nexternal situation has remained strong. The Reserve Bank will continue to\nfollow the approach of watchfulness, caution and flexibility by closely monitoring\nthe developments in the financial markets at home and abroad.  It will co-\nordinate its market operations carefully, particularly in regard to the forex\nmarket with appropriate monetary, regulatory and other measures as13\nconsidered necessary from time to time.  It is heartening to note that recent\ninternational research on viable exchange rate strategies in emerging markets\nhas also lent considerable support to the exchange rate policy followed by\nIndia.\n32. India\u2019s sustained efforts to buil d an adequate level of foreign exchange\nreserves in the last few years have also been fully vindicated by recent\ndevelopments.  As pointed out in previous policy Statements, the overall\napproach to the management of India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves in recent\nyears has reflected the changing composition of balance of payments, and has\nendeavoured to reflect the \u201cliquidity risks\u201d associated with different types of\nflows and other requirements.  The policy for reserve management  is thus\njudiciously built upon a host of identifiable factors and other contingencies.\nSuch factors, inter alia,  include: the size of the current account deficit; the size\nof short-term liabilities (including current repayment obligations on long-term\nloans); the possible variability in portfolio investment and other types of capital\nflows; the unanticipated pressures on the balance of payments arising out of\nexternal shocks; and movements in the repatriable foreign currency deposits of\nnon-resident Indians ( NRIs).  Taking these factors into account, India\u2019s foreign\nexchange reserves are at present more than comfortable.\n33. The substantial growth in reserves in the recent period has generated a\nwelcome debate regarding the costs and benefits of holding reserves.  In any\ncost-benefit analysis of holding reserves , it is essential to keep in view the\nobjectives of holding reserves, which, inter alia, cover: (a) maintaining\nconfidence in monetary and exchange rate policies; (b) enhancing the capacity\nto intervene in forex markets; (c) limiting external vulnerability so as to absorb\nshocks during times of crisis; (d) providing confidence to the markets that\nexternal obligations can always be met; and (e) reducing volatility in foreign\nexchange markets. Sharp exchange rate movements can be highly\ndisequilibrating and costly for the economy during periods of uncertainty or\nadverse expectations, whether real or imaginary.  For developing countries,14\nthese economic costs are likely to be substantially higher than the net financial\ncost, if any, of holding reserves.  In this context, it is important to note that in\nIndia, in the last few years, almost the whole addition to reserves has been\nmade without increasing the overall level of external debt.  The increase in\nreserves largely reflects higher remittances, quicker repatriation of export\nproceeds and non-debt inflows.  Even after taking into account foreign currency\ndenominated NRI flows (where interest rates are linked to LIBOR), the financial\ncost of additional reserve accretion in India in the recent period is quite low, and\nis likely to be more than offset by the return on additional reserves.\n34. It may also be mentioned that most of the increase in reserves in the\nrecent period is through net purchases by RBI in the domestic  forex market for\nwhich an equivalent amount of domestic currency has been released to the\nconcerned domestic entities, including public sector units, corporates and\nindividuals.  The decision on the use of this counterpart domestic currency\nreleased by RBI (i.e., for investment, deposits or as liquid assets etc.) is the\nresponsibility of the above mentioned entities and, not that of RBI, or for\nthat matter, the Government.  Needless to add that to the extent that this\ncounterpart local currency is used by recipient entities for further investment in\nthe economy, the impact on industrial demand and growth would be favourable.\n35. Strong foreign exchange reserves and low interest rates in the domestic\nmarkets have helped the Government to prepay certain foreign currency loans\nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) amounting to US $ 1.36 billion and\nfrom the World Bank amounting to US $ 1.67 billion. These foreign debts were\nsubstituted with domestic debt amounting to Rs.13 ,000 crore by issuing\nsecurities on private placement basis to RBI.  These external loans were repaid\non February 24 and 27, 2003.  The above transactions did not have any fiscal\nor monetary impact as it was a substitution of external sovereign debt with\ndomestic sovereign debt placed with RBI.  Corporate bodies have also taken\nadvantage of low international interest rates in prepaying a part of their external\ncommercial borrowings ( ECBs).  A study by RBI has estimated that during April-15\nDecember 2002, corporates have prepaid ECBs amounting to US $ 595 million.\nThe total prepayment of ECBs during the last three years by corporates\namounted to US $ 1.1 billion and the saving in the interest burden on account of\nthe prepayment was about US $ 90 million.\n36. The broad principles that have guided India a fter the Asian crisis of 1997\nare:\n\u2022 Careful monitoring and management of exchange rates without a fixed\ntarget or a pre-announced target or a band.  Flexibility in the exchange\nrate together with ability to intervene, if and when necessary.\n\u2022 A policy to build a higher level of foreign exchange reserves which takes\ninto account not only anticipated current account deficit but also \u2018liquidity\nat risk\u2019 arising from unanticipated capital movements.\n\u2022 A judicious policy for management of the capital account.\n37. Considerable flexibility has been given to the corporates over a period to\nhedge their forex exposure in the market.  It is, however, observed that a\nnoticeable portion of the corporate foreign currency commitments remain\nunhedged by the corporates on the basis of their perceptions of the market and\nthese could impact their overall financial status in case of unexpected\ndevelopments.  In earlier policy Statements, RBI has urged banks which have\nlarge exposure to such corporates to put in place a system for monitoring such\nunhedged external liabilities.\n38. A related issue that has been raised recently in the media and through\nexpert comments by market participants relates to the movement of forward\nmarket  premia . The premia have shown considerable downward movement in\nrecent weeks. Thus, as of April 25, 2003, the 6-month forward premia on US\ndollar was only 2.1 per cent ( annualised   rate) as compared with 5.9 per cent a\nyear ago and  3.4 per cent  at the beginning of January 2003. The sharp\ndownward movement in forward premia has occurred because, at present,16\nthere seems to be a rush to sell dollars in the forward market by exporters and\nother entities in anticipation of further appreciation of the rupee vis-\u00e0-vis\nUS dollar. In response to this expectation, there is also a rush to \u201cborrow\u201d\ndollars (for repayments later) and convert these into rupees now. If the rupee\ndoes appreciate, the borrowers of dollars expect to make a financial gain (as\nfewer rupees would be required to repay the \u201cborrowed\u201d dollars). This\nphenomenon is also reflected in banks going \u201cshort\u201d on dollars during intra-day\nand inter-day foreign currency trades.\n39. While the demand for \u201cborrowing\u201d dollars for repayments later is strong,\nfor the same reason, the demand by corporates and others for \u201cpurchasing\u201d\ndollars in exchange for rupees in the spot and forward markets has become\nweaker.  This has resulted in corporates and other market participants having\nlarger \u201c unhedged\u201d exposures on their future dollar obligations.  It has also led to\nsome postponement of forward demand for dollars.  These two phenomena ,\ni.e. higher incentive to sell or \u201cborrow\u201d dollars and lower demand for actual\npurchase of spot or forward dollars have, inter alia, in combination put pressure\non the forward premia.\n40. The Reserve Bank has received various suggestions from banks and\nother market participants to meet the demand for \u201cborrowed\u201d dollars, arising\nfrom expectations of continued rupee appreciation.  It has been suggested that\nbanks should be permitted a higher level of foreign borrowings (over and above\nthe present limit of 25 per cent of unimpaired Tier I capital), and/or higher\ninflows of foreign currency deposits should be encouraged (by increasing, for\nexample, the ceiling interest rate on FCNR deposits which is, at present, 0.25\npercentage point below LIBOR).\n41. While RBI will continue to operate in the spot and forward markets as per\nits foreign exchange management policies, RBI is not in favour of increasing the\nunhedged borrowings by corporates , and short term forex liabilities of banks\nin order to meet the demand for \u201cborrowed\u201d dollars that is arising from17\nexpectations regarding future movements in dollar-rupee exchange rate. To put\nat rest market speculations about RBI\u2019s stance in this regard, it is clarified that:\n\u2022 At present, there is in fact an excess supply of US dollars in both the\nspot and forward markets to meet all genuine transactions and\ninvestment demand by corporates, banks and others. There is no\nshortage of foreign currency availability in the market.\n\u2022 One-way expectations of exchange rate or premia may not always be\nfulfilled. Present unhedged exposures seem to be on account of\nexpectations on unconstrained appreciation of rupee. Movements in\nrespect of exchange rates may not, however, be unidirectional.  This can\nbe seen from the movement of the Euro against the US dollar from\n0.9606 to 1.1087 between September 17, 2002 and March 11, 2003,\nfrom 1.1087 to 1.0501 between March 11 and March 21, 2003 and\nfrom 1.0501 to 1.0997 between March 21 and April 25, 2003. Similar\nmovements have also been observed in the case of pound sterling/US\ndollar rate.\n\u2022 For these reasons, it is of utmost importance, particularly in relatively thin\ndeveloping country markets, that foreign currency exposures by\ncorporates and others are largely hedged or covered against anticipated\nforeign currency earnings. It may be recalled that a part of the problem\nthat many emerging economies have faced in the past has been due to\nexcessive unhedged foreign currency exposures in a country during\nperiods when movement in exchange rate was absent (due to fixed\nexchange rate policy) or currency was appreciating.\n42. The Reserve Bank has been encouraging banks to improve the export\ncredit delivery system in order to provide timely and adequate credit to the\nexport sector.  Following the survey on exporters\u2019 satisfaction  conducted18\nwith the help of National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), a\nsmall committee was constituted with officers from RBI, banks and Export\nCredit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd.  The Committee has so far visited 10\ncentres in the country from where large scale exports are taking place and had\ndiscussions with bankers to sensitise the need for bringing about improvements\nin the export credit delivery system.  Reports received from banks reveal that\nthe suggestions made by NCAER have been largely complied with.  Exports\nbeing an important sector of the economy, banks should continue to pursue\ncustomer-friendly export credit delivery system.\n43. The performance of India\u2019s exports  during 2002-03 has been\nencouraging despite the continued global slowdown. Exports in US dollar terms\nincreased by 16.7 per cent during 2002-03 (April-February) as against a decline\nof 0.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Imports\nshowed an increase of 16.3 per cent as compared with a marginal increase of\n0.8 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. While oil imports\nregistered a significant increase of 26.5 per cent on account of steep increase\nin the international oil prices as against a decline of 13.0 per cent in the\nprevious year, non-oil imports showed an increase of 12.5 per cent as\ncompared with an increase of 7.3 per cent in the corresponding period of the\nprevious year.\n44. At a further disaggregated level, non-oil imports excluding gold and silver\nincreased by 17.6 per cent during 2002-03 (April-December) as compared with\na lower increase of 6.0 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous\nyear reflecting improved industrial outlook.  As a result of higher imports, the\ntrade deficit widened to US $ 7.8 billion during 2002-03 (April-February) from\nUS $ 6.8 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year despite\nacceleration in exports.  However, higher services exports, such as software\nand buoyant inward remittances during 2002-03 (April-December), resulted in\nthe current account of the balance of payments showing a surplus of US $ 2.819\nbillion as against a deficit of US $ 0.7 billion in the corresponding period of the\nprevious year. Going by current indications, India would be showing a current\naccount surplus during 2002-03 for the second year in succession.\n45. With a view to liberalising further the movement of cross-border capital\nflows, especially in the areas of outward foreign direct investment, inward direct\nand portfolio investment, non-resident deposits and external commercial\nborrowing, RBI inter alia, announced several important measures relating to\ncurrent and capital accounts.  A list of measures announced subsequent to the\npresentation of mid-term Review of October 2002 is given in the Annex.\n46. Pursuant to the announcement made in the Budget 2003-04 and moving\nfurther towards liberalisation of capital account, RBI has also implemented the\nfollowing measures:\n\u2022 Prepayment of ECBs under automatic route out of local resources/\nmarket purchases allowed without any limit.\n\u2022 Indian companies with a proven track record permitted to make overseas\ninvestment in a foreign entity engaged in any bonafide business activity,\nup to 100 per cent of their networth, within the overall ceiling of US $ 100\nmillion, by way of market purchases.\n47. In recent years, the Reserve Bank has been undertaking extensive\nconsultations with banks, market participants and experts before deciding on\nmajor policy issues relating to the financial sector. In addition to periodic\ndiscussions, several Working Groups were set up to consider proposed new\nmeasures that were likely to have wide impact on the financial sector, especially\nthe banking sector and also for examining various policy issues. Where\nnecessary, the reports of the Working Groups were also put on the RBI website\nfor wider dissemination and for inviting comments. The details of the progress\nmade in respect of certain Working Groups constituted recently are given in an\nAnnex  to this Statement.20\nII. Stance of Monetary Policy for 2003-04\n48. The overall stance of monetary policy in 2002-03  outlined in annual\npolicy Statement of 2002 was as follows:\n\u2022 Provision of adequate liquidity to meet credit growth and support\ninvestment demand in the economy while continuing a vigil on\nmovements in the price level.\n\u2022 In line with the above, to continue the present stance on interest rates\nincluding preference for soft interest rates.\n\u2022 To impart greater flexibility to the interest rate structure in the medium-\nterm.\n49. In line with its monetary policy stance, liquidity conditions during the year\nwere very comfortable.  This is evident from the higher average volume of repo\ntenders under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) during the year.  The\naverage outstanding volume of LAF repo was higher around Rs.11 ,300 crore\nduring 2002-03 as compared with Rs.3,500 crore during 2001-02.  Though the\nreal GDP growth turned out to be lower than that expected in the annual policy\nStatement of April 2002 because of widespread drought, the Reserve Bank\ncontinued with the policy of ensuring adequate liquidity in the financial system\nfor supporting industrial revival noticed during the year.\n50. The sharp accretion to foreign currency assets of RBI posed some\nchallenges for liquidity management  during the year.  During 2002-03, the net\nforeign currency assets of RBI (net of revaluation) increased by as much as\nRs.82 ,090 crore. The monetary impact of such large inflows had to be\nneutralised by conduct of substantial outright OMO sales.  The net outright\nOMO sales of government securities were Rs.53 ,780 crore during the year.  As21\na result, the reserve money expansion was Rs.30 ,960 crore.  Despite the\nintervention of RBI through sterilisation, the interest rate did not firm up as\nadequate liquidity could be maintained in the system through judicious LAF\noperations of RBI.\n51. Notwithstanding the comfortable liquidity position emanating from the\nforeign exchange build up, RBI made further progress in meeting its medium-\nterm objective of reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR). The CRR was\nreduced from 5.5 per cent to 5.0 per cent in June 2002 and further to 4.75 per\ncent in November 2002 augmenting the lendable resources of banks by about\nRs.10 ,000 crore.\n52. In order to stabilise interest rate expectations, the Reserve Bank had\nsignalled its intention, in advance, of reducing the Bank Rate by up to half a\npercentage point (50 basis points) in the annual policy Statement of April 2002\nif warranted by the evolving liquidity and credit situation.  After reviewing the\nliquidity and monetary conditions, the Bank Rate was reduced by 25 basis\npoints to 6.25 per cent, and repo rate under the LAF was also reduced by 25\nbasis points to 5.5 per cent in the mid-term Review of October 2002.  The repo\nrate under the LAF was further reduced to 5.0 per cent on March 3, 2003.\n53. As inflation remained benign for most part of the year, despite the impact\nof drought and higher oil prices, there was general reduction in market interest\nrates. The overnight call money rates remained stable and almost overlapped\nthe repo rate.  The yields on 91-day and 364-day Treasury Bills and dated\ngovernment securities of various maturities ruled much lower than yields at the\nbeginning of the financial year.  This enabled the large market borrowing\nprogramme of the Government to be completed at a low cost without unduly\naffecting the general interest rate structure.  During the last three years (March\n2000 - March 2003), the yields on 91-day Treasury Bills, 364-day Treasury Bills\nand government securities of residual maturity of 10 years have declined22\nsubstantially from 9.17 per cent, 9.93 per cent and 10.85 per cent in that order\nto the level of 5.89 per cent, 5.89 per cent and 6.21 per cent, respectively.\n54. Despite drought conditions and volatility in international oil prices, the\ninflation rate remained benign till January 2003 but has picked up since then.\nThe point-to-point inflation rate in 2002-03 (on March 29, 2003) was significantly\nhigher at 6.2 per cent (as compared with 1.6 per cent on March 30, 2002).  The\nrecent price increase was, however, confined to a few commodities \u2212\nessentially mineral oils (because of the Iraq war), and drought-related items\n(oilseeds, edible oils, oil cakes and fibres).  Excluding price increase due to\nsuch items (with an aggregate weight of 15.4 per cent), the inflation rate for the\nremaining basket works out to 2.7 per cent as compared with 1.5 per cent last\nyear.  Considerable uncertainties still remain on the inflation front due to current\ngeopolitical uncertainties.  Further, from the viewpoint of the domestic economy,\nthe progress of the South-West monsoon is important so that supply\nconstraints, which could have an adverse impact on inflation, do not emerge.\nMovements in international oil prices over the next few months cannot also be\npredicted as there are uncertainties in the aftermath of the Iraq war.  As such,\nthe inflationary situation needs to be watched closely. There is no room for\ncomplacency on this account.  For the present, however, it is proposed to\ncontinue with the policy of maintaining adequate liquidity in the system and a\nsoft interest rate environment.  In case demand pressures emerge and the\ninflationary situation worsens, which hopefully will not be the case, the present\nmonetary policy stance may have to be reviewed.\n55. The monetary policy framework has changed over the recent period in\nresponse to reforms in the financial sector.  The Reserve Bank\u2019s endeavour\nhas been to enhance the allocative efficiency of the financial sector,\npreserve financial stability and improve the transmission mechanism of\nmonetary policy by moving from direct to indirect instruments.  A number of\nsteps have been taken to ensure balanced development of various segments of23\nthe financial market as also to preserve its integrity and transparency.  The\noperationalisation of the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL),\nnegotiated dealing system (NDS), introduction of collaterialised borrowing and\nlending obligation (CBLO), prudential limits on uncollateralised call/notice\nmoney market and encouragement of collateralised repo transactions, and\nintroduction of interest rate options would increase the depth of the financial\nmarket.  This process would get a further boost with the operationalisation of\nthe real time gross settlement (RTGS) system.\n56. The Reserve Bank is committed to the implementation of the \u201cCore\nPrinciples for Effective Banking Supervision\u201d drawn up by the Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision.  In order to achieve full compliance with these\nprinciples, steps have been taken in a phased manner, to move towards a\nsystem of consolidated supervision, for enhancing the role of external auditors,\nstrengthening corporate governance, internal controls and audit procedures,\nincreasing transparency and disclosure in the balance sheets of banks.  An off-\nsite monitoring system was introduced gradually and extended to cover co-\noperative institutions also.\n57. In addition to the initiatives in areas of regulation and supervision, RBI\ncontinues to foster institutional structures and mechanisms which would\nstrengthen the existing financial infrastructure. These include setting up of a\nCredit Information Bureau (CIB), introduction of a mechanism for corporate debt\nrestructuring (CDR), NPA management, technology upgradation and legal\naspects.  Banks and financial markets have responded well to RBI\u2019s regulatory\nand advisory initiatives. The perceptible improvement recorded by banks is\nreflected in certain key performance parameters, viz. reduction in net NPA ratio\nand increase in the capital adequacy ratio.\n58. The fiscal deficit of the Central Government, which was budgeted at 5 .3\nper cent of GDP for 2002-03, was revised upwards to 5.9 per cent.  For the year\n2003-04, the fiscal deficit  is placed at 5.6 per cent of GDP and the market24\nborrowing programme of the Centre is estimated at Rs.1 ,66,230 crore (gross)\nand Rs.1,07,194 crore (net).  While the market borrowing programme in respect\nof some States has come under stress, RBI hopes to conduct debt\nmanagement without serious pressure on overall liquidity and interest rates\nunless there is a change in the overall macroeconomic situation due to\nunanticipated domestic or external developments.\n59. For the purpose of monetary policy formulation, real GDP growth in\n2003-04  is placed at about 6.0 per cent after taking into account the current\ntrends in the various macroeconomic factors. Subject to satisfactory spatial\ndistribution, if rainfall is around 96 per cent of the long term average (as per\nadvance forecast released by India Meteorological Department on April 16,\n2003), recovery in agricultural output may be over 3.1 per cent during 2003-04\n(which is the estimated decline in output during 2002-03).  A recovery in\nagricultural output coupled with the continuance of the upturn in the industrial\nand the services sectors should help in achieving the projected growth for\n2003-04.\n60. While assessing the inflationary outlook for 2003-04, the following major\ndevelopments in the economy will have to be borne in mind:\n\u2022 The higher base level of prices at the end of March 2003.\n\u2022 The expected decline in oil prices (which had picked up during the last\nquarter of 2002-03).\n\u2022 Expectation regarding behaviour of the monsoon in 2003-04.\nBased on the present assessment of relevant factors, the inflation rate in\n2003-04  on a point-to-point basis may be placed in the range of 5.0 to 5.5 per\ncent.  As pointed out earlier, the increase in inflation in the last quarter for 2002-\n03      was dominated by certain commodities such as edible oils, oil cakes and\nmineral oils.  While prices of edible oils increased sharply because of drought,25\ndomestic mineral oil prices increased substantially in the wake of the sharp rise\nin international oil prices.  The prices of these items are, as of now, expected to\ndecline during the course of the year.   It is important to initiate measures which,\nthrough a strong \u201cpass through\u201d effect, will help to soften the prices of\ncommodities which showed unusual rise last year. Timely domestic action\nwould help in further reducing the projected rate of inflation, which would be\nhighly desirable for monetary and financial management.\n61. Consistent with the expected GDP growth and inflation, the projected\nexpansion in broad money (M 3) for 2003-04 is placed at 14.0 per cent.  As the\nprojected expansion of money supply is on a higher base, including the mergers\nthat took place in the banking industry, the volume of liquidity would be\nadequate to meet the credit needs of the productive sectors of the economy.\nConsistent with this order of growth in M 3, an increase in aggregate deposits of\nscheduled commercial banks is set at Rs.1 ,79,000 crore.  Non-food bank credit\nincluding investments in commercial paper, shares/debentures/bonds of PSUs\nand private corporate sector is projected to increase by 15.5-16.0 per cent,\nwhich should be adequate to facilitate the sustenance of growth in industrial\nactivity during 2003-04.\n62. The Bank Rate changes, combined with CRR and repo rate changes,\nhave emerged as important tools of liquidity and monetary management.  The\nLAF has evolved as an effective mechanism for absorbing and/or injecting\nliquidity on a day-to-day basis in a more flexible manner and, in the process,\nproviding a corridor for the call money market. The prudential limits placed on\nbanks and PDs in their operations in the call money market, and gradual\nphasing out of non-banks from the call money market, are expected to bring\nintegrity to this market, contribute to development of repo/term money market\nand further help to strengthen the channels of monetary transmission.  With\nmost of the procedural and technological upgradation being put in place, RBI\u2019s\nefforts to make LAF more effective will continue.  The Reserve Bank will also26\ncontinue its efforts to bring about development and smooth functioning of the\nfinancial markets.\n63. An issue of policy interest for financial managem ent by banks and other\nmarket participants is whether, after a sharp decline in the past 2-3 years,\ninterest rates have bottomed out.  As is well known, the outcome for interest\nrates  depends heavily on the outlook for inflation, growth prospects and\ninvestment demand and it is not possible to predict short-run movement in\ninterest rates, either up or down, without taking cognizance of possible\nmovements in all other macroeconomic variables.  These variables are also\nsubject to unanticipated changes because of unforeseen domestic or external\ndevelopments.\n64. On balance of probabilities, given normal conditions and overall stability\nin macroeconomic environment, in view of several structural constraints, the\npresent nominal and real interest rates are relatively low. There may not be\nsignificant potential for further sizeable downward movement in interest rates.\nSome important structural factors that contribute to inflation and nominal\ninterest rates in India \u2013 which are generally somewhat higher than those in\nindustrial or fast-growing emerging market economies \u2013 are:\n(a) the fixation of some food and other procurement prices by the\nGovernment which has an important impact on determining the\nprices of these items, which have a high weightage in price indices;\n(b) the need for adjusting several administered food and other subsidies\nthat increase the burden on current expenditure, which contributes to\ncontinuing high fiscal deficit;  and27\n(c) the existence of relatively rigid wage structures with built-in inflation\nrelated increases in wages, dearness allowances etc. in the\norganised sector.\n65. The above structural factors, which are generally not prevalent in most\nindustrial and emerging market economies, impart an upward bias to sustained\nprice increases from year to year, particularly during the upward phase of the\nbusiness cycle.  It is important to continue efforts over the medium-term to\nreduce the impact of these factors in order to facilitate greater downward\nflexibility and a sustainable soft interest rate climate.\n66. In sum, as per present assessment and barring the emergence of any\nadverse and unexpected developments in the various sectors of the economy,\nthe overall stance of monetary policy  for 2003-04 will be:\n\u2022 Provision of adequate liquidity to meet credit growth and support\ninvestment demand in the economy while continuing a vigil on\nmovements in the price level.\n\u2022 In line with the above, to continue with the present stance of preference\nfor a soft and flexible interest rate environment within the framework of\nmacroeconomic stability.28\nIII. Financial Sector Reforms and\nMonetary Policy Measures\n67. A vibrant, resilient and competitive financial sector is vital for sustaining\nthe reform process in the real sector of the economy.  As such, the annual\npolicy Statements as well as mid-term Reviews of RBI have been focusing on\nthe structural and regulatory measures to strengthen the financial system.\nThese measures have been guided by the objectives of increasing operational\nefficacy of monetary policy, redefining the regulatory role of the Reserve Bank,\nstrengthening prudential norms, and developing technological and institutional\ninfrastructure.\n68. A key element of financial sector reforms has been the strengthening of\nthe regulatory and supervisory framework on an ongoing basis. With a\nparadigm shift from micro-regulation to prudential regulation and macro-\nmanagement, emphasis has been placed on promoting financial stability\nthrough developing sound risk management systems and enhancing\ntransparency and accountability.  While progress has been made in setting out\nsignposts for what needs to be done, it has to be recognised that\nmacroeconomic and financial conditions tend to change swiftly, posing new29\nchallenges.  It is, therefore, important to put in place corrective strategies along\nwith implementation and enforcement mechanisms.\n69. In order to achieve the above objectives, RBI has been adopting a policy\nof extensive consultations  with experts and market participants before\nintroducing policy measures. Such discussions help in ensuring timely and\neffective implementation of the measures in accordance with international best\npractices.\n70. Against this background, this section reviews the progress of\nimplementation of the measures initiated so far and proposes some further\nmeasures to meet the emerging challenges in the financial sector.\nMonetary Measures\n71. In view of macroeconomic and overall monetary conditions and\nconsistent with announcements made by the Finance Minister regarding certain\nadministered interest rates, RBI reduced the interest rate on savings account\nfrom 4.0 per cent to 3.5 per cent effective from March 1, 2003.  The repo rate\nunder LAF made available on March 3, 2003 was reduced from 5.5 per cent to\n5.0 per cent and thereafter the cut-off rate is being decided at each auction.\n(a) Bank Rate\n\u2022 It is proposed to reduce the Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage point from\n6.25 per cent to 6.0 per cent with effect from the close of business\ntoday (April 29, 2003).\n72. The Bank Rate has been reduced from 11.0 per cent to 6.0 per cent, i.e.\nby 500 basis points in the last five years.  This is the sharpest reduction in the\nBank Rate since independence.  Unless the domestic and international\ncircumstances change, the policy bias in regard to the Bank Rate is to keep it\nstable until the mid-term Review of October 2003.30\n(b) Cash Reserve Ratio\n73. The Reserve Bank has been pursuing the medium-term objective of\nreducing cash reserve ratio (CRR) of banks to the statutory minimum level of\n3.0 per cent.  In this direction, CRR was gradually reduced from 11.0 per cent in\nAugust 1998 to 4.75 per cent by November 2002.  In line with this medium-term\nobjective, it is now proposed to:\n\u2022 Reduce CRR further from 4.75 per cent to 4.50 per cent effective\nfortnight beginning June 14, 2003.\n74. With this reduction, CRR would have been reduced by 4.0 percentage\npoints in the last three years.  It may be mentioned that in case there is an\nunexpected change in the liquidity conditions in the next few weeks, RBI may\nadvance the effective date of the above reduction.\n(c) Payment of Interest on eligible CRR Balances on Monthly\n     Basis\n75. In the mid-term Review of October 2002, in response to a suggestion\nmade by banks, RBI had announced that interest on eligible CRR balances\nmaintained by banks with RBI would be paid on monthly basis, with effect from\nan appropriate date, as against the present practice of quarterly rests.\nAccordingly, the first such interest payment will be made for the month of April\n2003 covering the fortnights ended April 4, 2003 and April 18, 2003 in the\nmonth of May 2003.  Pursuant to this, RBI has suitably modified the interest\nclaim statement to be submitted by banks.\n(d) Export Credit Refinance Facility\n76. In the mid-term Review of October 2002, it was indicated that interest\nrates on post-shipment rupee export credit beyond 90 days and up to 180 days31\nwould be deregulated with effect from May 1, 2003.  In response to the\nsuggestion received from the exporting community, in the present uncertain\ngeopolitical environment, it has been decided:\n\u2022 To continue extending refinance facility to eligible export credit remaining\noutstanding under post-shipment rupee credit beyond 90 days and up to\n180 days.\nThis measure will be reviewed again in October 2003.\n          (e) Back-stop Facility\n77. Banks are eligible for standing facilities (export credit eligible for\nrefinance) and PDs are eligible for collateralised liquidity support from RBI\nsubject to certain limits.  These limits are split into a \u201cnormal\u201d facility\n(constituting one-half of the total standing facility), which is available at the Bank\nRate, and a \u201cback-stop\u201d facility (constituting the remaining half of the standing\nfacility) available at a variable rate determined by RBI from time to time.  At\npresent, the \u201cback-stop\u201d interest rate is higher than the repo/reverse repo /\nNSE-MIBOR rates.\n78. In order to increase the efficacy of liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)\noperations, it is desirable to rationalise the multiplicity of rates at which liquidity\nis absorbed/injected.  Accordingly, it is proposed that:\n\u2022 The \u201cback-stop\u201d interest rate will be at the reverse repo cut-off rate at\nwhich funds were injected earlier during the day in the regular LAF\nauctions.\n\u2022 Where no reverse repo bid is accepted as part of LAF auction, the \u201cback-\nstop\u201d interest rate will generally be 2.0 percentage points over the repo\ncut-off rate of the day under LAF.32\n\u2022 On the days when no bids for repo or reverse repo auctions are\nreceived/accepted, the \u201cback-stop\u201d interest rate will be decided by RBI\non an ad hoc  basis.\n79. With the above changes, it is expected that the \u201cback-stop\u201d interest rate\nwill be lower by 1.0 percentage point over the present \u201cback-stop\u201d rate.  This\nshould benefit banks (as well as borrowers) using this facility.\n80. Over time, LAF has evolved as an effective mechanism for absorbing\nand/or injecting liquidity on a day-to-day basis in a more flexible manner.\nNevertheless, in some very rare and unusual circumstances, a situation may\narise when a bank faces a sudden and unforeseen liquidity problem particularly\noutside the normal LAF auction timings and on days on which such auctions are\nnot held.  In such exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, RBI at its\ndiscretion, may extend liquidity support to such a bank if the said bank is\notherwise financially sound, and after taking into account other relevant factors.\nThe liquidity support in such exceptional circumstances will be made available\nonly for a minimum number of days required to overcome the unexpected\nliquidity pressure.  As this exceptional financing has to be availed only in rare\ncircumstances, an interest rate of 4.0 percentage points above the reverse repo\nrate prevailing on that day (or a rate as may be decided by RBI) will be charged.\nSuch liquidity support will be available against eligible securities with adequate\nmargin and other conditions as RBI may consider appropriate.\nInterest Rate Policy\n(a) Prime Lending Rate and Spreads\n81. At present, commercial banks decide the lending rates to different\nborrowers (with credit limit of over Rs.2 lakh) subject to the announcement of\nprime lending rate (PLR) as approved by their Boards.   In order to enhance\ntransparency in banks\u2019 pricing of their loan products as also to ensure that the33\nPLR truly reflects the actual costs, banks are advised to consider the following\nsuggestions for determination of their benchmark prime lending rate:\n\u2022 Banks should take into account their ( i) actual cost of funds, (ii) operating\nexpenses and (iii) a minimum margin to cover regulatory requirement of\nprovisioning/capital charge and profit margin, while arriving at the\nbenchmark PLR. Banks should announce a benchmark PLR with the\napproval of their Boards.\n\u2022 As is already the case, the benchmark PLR would continue to be the\nceiling rate for credit limit up to Rs.2 lakh.\n\u2022 Since all other lending rates can be determined with reference to the\nbenchmark PLR arrived at, as above, by taking into account term premia\nand/or risk premia, the system of tenor-linked PLR may be discontinued.\nThese premia can be factored in the spread over or below the PLR.   The\neffective date for discontinuation of the tenor-linked PLR would be further\ndiscussed with banks and a decision will be announced separately in due\ncourse.\n82. In the interest of customer protection and to have greater degree of\ntransparency in regard to actual interest rates charged to borrowers, banks\nshould continue to provide information on maximum and minimum interest rates\ncharged alongside the benchmark PLR.\n83. The Reserve Bank proposes to review the system of determination of\nbenchmark PLR by banks and the actual prevailing spreads around the\nbenchmark PLR in September 2003.\n(b) Non-Resident External (NRE) Deposits\n84. At present, banks can offer FCNR(B) deposits in foreign currency and\nnon-resident external (NRE) deposits in domestic currency to non-resident34\nIndians.  Both schemes are now fully repatriable.  Whereas the maturity period\nin case of FCNR(B) scheme is 1-3 years, in case of NRE deposits, the\nminimum maturity is 6 months.  Banks are free to offer fixed and floating rates\nin both the schemes.  The interest rates on FCNR(B) deposits are subject to a\nceiling of LIBOR/Swap rates for the corresponding maturities minus 25 basis\npoints, and thus conform to global interest rates in foreign currency deposits in\nUS dollars, pound sterling, euro etc.  Similarly, the interest rates offered by\nbanks on NRE rupee deposits are also more or less at par with domestic\ninterest rates on rupee deposits.\n85. In order to provide uniformity in the maturity structure for all types of\nrepatriable deposits whether they are in foreign currency or in rupees, it is\nproposed that:\n\u2022 The maturity period of fresh NRE deposits, with immediate effect, will be\n1 to 3 years in line with FCNR(B) deposits.  This will also apply to NRE\ndeposits renewed after their present maturity period.\nCredit Delivery Mechanism\n(a) Priority Sector Lending\n(i) Liberalisation of credit for drip irrigation/sprinkler irrigation system/\nagricultural machinery\n86.      In the mid-term Review of October 2002, the limit on advances granted\nto dealers in drip irrigation/sprinkler irrigation system/agricultural machinery,\nlocated in rural/semi-urban areas was increased from Rs.10 lakh up to Rs.20\nlakh under priority sector lending for agriculture.  As the scheme has been of\nbenefit to the farming community, the following further liberalisation is proposed:\n\u2022 Dealers in drip irrigation/sprinkler irrigation system/agricultural\nmachinery, irrespective of their location, would be eligible for such\nadvances, under priority sector lending for agriculture.\n   (ii) Housing loans35\n87. At present, the quantum of direct housing loans for construction of\nhouses by individuals to be counted under priority sector advances is Rs.5 lakh\nin rural and semi-urban areas and Rs.10 lakh in urban and metropolitan areas.\nIn view of increasing demand for housing in rural and semi-urban areas, and to\nimprove financing to housing sector in these areas, it has been decided that:\n\u2022 Banks, with the approval of their Boards, will be free to extend direct\nfinance to the housing sector up to Rs.10 lakh in rural and semi-urban\nareas as part of priority sector lending.\n(b) Survey on KCC\n88. As indicated in the m id-term Review of October 2002, a survey for\nassessing the impact of kisan credit cards (KCC) Scheme has been awarded to\nthe National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), New Delhi.  The\nimpact assessment survey would cover all regions.\n(c) Relief for Drought affected Farmers\n89. Guidelines for relief measures by banks in the districts notified by the\nstate governments as drought affected were issued in November 2002.\nAccordingly, banks were advised: ( i) not to recover any amount either by way of\nprincipal or interest during the year 2002-03 in respect of Kharif  crop loans,\n(ii) to convert the principal amount of crop loans into term loans to be recovered\nover a minimum period of five years in the case of small and marginal farmers\nand four years in the case of other farmers and (iii) to defer interest due on crop\nloans and not to charge interest on the deferred interest.\n90. In order to mitigate further the hardship of farmers in drought affected\nstates, the Government has decided, as a one-time measure, to waive\ncompletely, the first year\u2019s deferred interest liability on Kharif loans in those\nstates.  This instalment of deferred interest, which is to be waived by banks\nwould be reimbursed by the Government.  No interest would be charged on the36\ndeferred interest, and the balance of the deferred interest would be recovered in\nreasonable instalments.\n(d) Guidelines on Infrastructure Financing \u2013 Relaxation in\n     Regulatory and Prudential Aspects\n91. In view of the critical importance of th e infrastructure sector as also the\nhigh priority being accorded to this sector, certain relaxations relating to\nregulatory and prudential aspects were allowed to banks to boost credit flow to\nthis sector.  These measures, inter alia, include: ( i) enhancing the scope of\ndefinition of infrastructure lending, (ii) relaxing the prudential single borrower\nexposure limit from 15 per cent to 20 per cent of capital funds in respect of\ninfrastructure companies providing infrastructure facilities, (iii) assigning a\nconcessional risk weight of 50 per cent on investment in securitised paper\nsatisfying certain conditions pertaining to an infrastructure facility, (iv) permitting\nlending to special purpose vehicles ( SPVs) in the private sector, registered\nunder Companies Act for directly undertaking viable infrastructure projects\nsubject to certain conditions and (v) lending to promoters, with certain\nsafeguards and where appropriate, for acquiring a controlling stake in existing\ninfrastructure companies.  Detailed instructions in this regard to banks have\nalready been issued by RBI.\n (e) Micro-finance\n92. Micro-credit institutions and self-help groups ( SHGs) have been\nrecognised as important vehicles for generation of income and delivery of credit\nto self-employed persons.  The Reserve Bank has been emphasising on flow of\nbank credit to micro-enterprises in rural and semi-urban areas set up by\nvulnerable sections of society including women.  A number of steps have been\ninitiated in this regard and banks were advised to provide maximum support to\nSHGs.  Further, in order to put in place a more vibrant micro-finance delivery\nenvironment, as indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002, RBI had a\nwide-ranging interface with a cross-section of micro-finance providers.37\nPursuant to these interactions, four informal Groups have been set up by RBI to\nlook into various issues relating to: ( i) structure and sustainability; (ii) funding;\n(iii) regulations and (iv) capacity building for micro-finance delivery.  The\nReserve Bank will discuss the recommendations of the informal Groups in a\nwider forum for possible implementation.\nMoney Market\n(a)  Moving towards Pure Inter-bank Call/Notice Money  Market\n93. It may be recalled that the annual policy Statement of April 2001\nhighlighted the intention to move towards a pure inter-bank call/notice money\nmarket in four stages by gradually phasing out non-bank participation. In\nstage I, non-bank participants were allowed to lend, on average in a reporting\nfortnight, up to 85 per cent of their average daily lending during 2000-01. The\nimplementation of stage I has not caused any strain on the market or created\nundue volatility in call/notice money rate. Except for the Life Insurance\nCorporation of India, which has large liquid funds and is also subject to certain\nprudential constraints in investing its large surpluses in other non-bank\ninstitutions, by and large, most non-bank institutions have not faced any\ndifficulty in adhering to the stage I guidelines.\n94. Subsequently, in the annual polic y Statement of April 2002, it was stated\nthat RBI would announce the date of effectiveness of stage II, wherein non-\nbank participants would be allowed to lend, on average in a reporting fortnight,\nup to 75 per cent of their average daily lending in call money market during\n2000-01, depending on the date when NDS/CCIL becomes fully operational.  In\nview of the encouraging developments in NDS/CCIL, it would be desirable to\naccelerate the process of moving towards a pure inter-bank call/notice money\nmarket and facilitate further deepening of repo market.  Accordingly, it is\nproposed that:38\n\u00b7 Stage II of the transition to a pure inter-bank call/notice money market\nwill be effective from the fortnight beginning June 14, 2003, wherein non-\nbank participants would be allowed to lend, on average in a reporting\nfortnight, up to 75 per cent of their average daily lending in call/notice\nmoney market during 2000-01.\n95. However, in case a particular non-bank institution has genuine difficulty\nin developing proper alternative avenues for investment of excess liquidity\nbecause of its size, RBI may consider providing temporary permission to lend a\nhigher amount in call/notice money market for a specific period on a case by\ncase basis.\n(b)  Reporting of Call/Notice Money Market Transactions on\n      NDS Platform\n96. Negotiated dealing system (NDS), which has become operational since\nFebruary 2002, enables on-line dealing and dissemination of trade information\nrelating to instruments in money, government securities and foreign exchange\nmarkets.  Membership in NDS is open to all institutions which are members of\nINFINET and are maintaining subsidiary general ledger (SGL) Account with\nRBI.  These include banks, financial institutions ( FIs), primary dealers ( PDs),\ninsurance companies, mutual funds and any other institution as admitted by\nRBI.  At present, all deals in government securities, call/notice/term money,\nCDs and CP executed among NDS members have to be reported automatically\nthrough NDS, if the deal is done on NDS and within 15 minutes of concluding\nthe deal, if done outside NDS.  However, it has been observed that a very\nsizeable proportion of daily call/notice money market deals is not reported by\nmembers on NDS as stipulated. With a view to improving transparency and\nstrengthening efficiency in the market, it is proposed that:\n\u2022 From the fortnight beginning May 3, 2003, it would be mandatory for all\nNDS members to report all their call/notice money market deals on NDS.\nDeals done outside NDS should be reported within 15 minutes on NDS,39\nirrespective of the size of the deal or whether the counterparty is a\nmember of the NDS or not.\n\u2022 Full compliance with the reporting requirement to NDS will be reviewed\nin September 2003.  In case there is repeated non-reporting of deals by\nan NDS member, it will be considered whether non-reported deals by\nthat member should be treated as invalid with effect from a future date.\n(c) Introduction of New OTC  Rupee  Derivatives\n97. Following the announcement in the mid-term Review of October 2002,\nRBI had constituted a Working Group on Rupee Derivatives (Chairman :\nShri Jaspal Bindra) with appropriate representations from Securities and\nExchange Board of India (SEBI), banks, PDs, mutual funds and RBI.  The\nscope of the Group was later expanded to cover the issues relating to\nexchange-traded interest rate derivatives in addition to the issues on over-the-\ncounter (OTC) interest rate derivatives.  The Group felt that in order to further\ndeepen the money market and enable market participants to manage and\ncontrol interest rate risk, certain new rupee derivative instruments could be\nintroduced \u2013 both OTC and exchange-traded.  Accordingly, it is proposed that,\nto begin with:\n\u2022 Less complex OTC interest rate rupee options should be permitted in the\nfirst phase which include vanilla caps, floors and collars, European\nSwaptions, call and put options on fixed income instruments/ benchmark\nrates and unleveraged structured swaps based on overnight indexed\nswaps (OIS) and forward rate agreements ( FRAs) where the risk profile\nof such structure is similar to that of the building blocks.\n\u2022 Scheduled commercial banks, financial institutions and PDs would be\nallowed to both buy and sell options; corporates may sell options initially\nwithout being the net receivers of premium.40\n98. Detailed guidelines for operationalising the recommendations of the\nWorking Group would be issued in consultation with market participants.    \n(d) Commercial Paper\n99. Banks and FIs have the flexibility to provide credit enhancement for a\ncommercial paper (CP) issue by way of standby assistance/credit, back-stop\nfacility etc., based on their commercial judgment subject to the prudential norms\nas applicable and with specific approval of their Boards.  Further, the present\nguidelines do not provide for credit enhancement for a CP issue in the form of\nan unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to be given by non-bank entities\nsuch as a corporate.  In order to provide further flexibility to both issuers and\ninvestors in the CP market, it is proposed that:\n\u2022 Non-bank entities including corporates may provide unconditional and\nirrevocable guarantee for credit enhancement for CP issue as long as\n(i) the issuer fulfils the eligibility criteria prescribed for issuance of CP,\n(ii) the guarantor  has at least one notch higher credit rating than the\nissuer by an approved credit rating agency, (iii) the offer document for\nCP should properly disclose: the networth of the guarantor company; the\nnames of the companies to which the guarantor has issued similar\nguarantees; the extent of the guarantees offered by the guarantor\ncompany and the conditions under which the guarantee will be invoked.\n\u2022 Banks are allowed to invest in CP guaranteed by non-bank entities\nprovided their exposure remains within the regulatory ceiling as\nprescribed by RBI for unsecured exposures.\nDetailed guidelines on procedures and documentation in this regard will be\nissued by Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India\n(FIMMDA).\n     (e) Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation41\n100. The mid-term Review of October 2002 had announced the proposal to\npromote collateralised borrowing/lending operations by market participants to\nreduce their reliance on call/notice money market. Accordingly, collateralised\nborrowing and lending obligation (CBLO) has been operationalised as a money\nmarket instrument through Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) on\nJanuary 20, 2003.  The regulatory provisions and accounting treatment for\nCBLO are the same as those applicable to other money market instruments, but\nthe operations in CBLO are exempted from CRR, subject to the bank\nmaintaining minimum CRR of 3 per cent. In addition, securities lodged in the gilt\naccount of the bank maintained with CCIL under constituents\u2019 subsidiary\ngeneral ledger (CSGL) facility for CBLO remaining unencumbered at the end\nof any day are reckoned for SLR purposes by the concerned bank.  As on\nMarch 31, 2003, 32 members have been admitted in CCIL\u2019s CBLO segment,\nof which, 23 members have been activated by CCIL.  The total volume in CBLO\nduring January-March 2003 stood at Rs.1 ,703 crore amounting to an average\ndaily volume of Rs.30 crore.\nForeign Exchange Market\n(a) Overseas Investment by Mutual Funds \u2013 General Permission\n101. At present, mutua l funds are allowed to invest in ADRs/ GDRs of Indian\ncompanies and rated foreign debt instruments/equity within an overall cap of\nUS $ 1.0 billion with the permission of SEBI and RBI.  In order to simplify the\nprocedure and to facilitate expeditious processing of investment proposals, it is\nproposed:\n\u2022 To accord general permission to mutual funds for their overseas\ninvestments within the cap, once SEBI\u2019s approval has been obtained.\nThis general permission will be available until further notice.\n(b) Investment by Indian Corporates/Individuals in Rated\n                Bonds/Fixed Income Securities42\n102. At present, Indian corporates and resident individuals are permitted to\ninvest in equities of listed companies abroad subject to certain conditions.  It is\nproposed to extend this facility to debt instruments.   Accordingly:\n\u00b7 Indian corporates and resident individuals will also be permitted to invest\nin rated bonds/fixed income securities of listed eligible companies abroad\nsubject to certain conditions.\n(c) Forward Cover for Inflows under Foreign Direct Investment\n103. General permission has been accorded to banks to offer forward\ncontracts to overseas investors to hedge their Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)\nto the extent of investments made in India.  However, such FDI inflows are not\npermitted to be sold forward to banks.  In order to provide greater flexibility to\noverseas investors and encourage flow of FDI, it is proposed:\n\u2022 To allow overseas investors making long-term investments to hedge their\nforex exposures in India, pending investment, by entering into forward\nsale contracts with banks in India.\n(d) Forward Cover for Forex Exposures where Settlement is in\n                Rupees\n104. At present, resident entities are not allowed to book forward cover in\ncase of transactions denominated in foreign currency but settled in rupees.\nKeeping in view the exposures of such entities to exchange rate risk, it is\nproposed:\n\u00b7 To permit entities which have transactions denominated in foreign\ncurrency but settled in rupees to book forward contracts.  Such contracts\nshould be held till maturity and cash settlement would be made on the\nmaturity date.\n(e) Cross Currency Forward Cover for FCNR Deposits43\n105. At present, non-resident Indians ( NRIs) and overseas corporate bodies\n(OCBs) can enter into forward contracts with rupee as one of the currencies to\nhedge the balances held in FCNR(B) or NRE Accounts.  However, cross\ncurrency covers are not permitted for such deposits.  In order to facilitate better\nrisk hedging by NRIs and OCBs, it is proposed:\n\u2022 To allow NRIs/ OCBs to book cross currency forward contracts to hedge\nthe balances held in their FCNR(B) accounts. However, contracts once\ncancelled cannot be rebooked.\n(f) Forex Clearing\n106. One of the major functio ns of CCIL is clearing and settlement of inter-\nbank dollar-rupee transactions.  It offers a multilateral netting mechanism\nthrough a process of novation for inter-bank spot and forward dollar-rupee\ntransactions.  Live operations for clearing and settlement of spot and forward\ndollar-rupee transactions commenced on November 12, 2002.  While the US\ndollar leg of transactions is settled through CCIL\u2019s account with its settlement\nagent in the US, the rupee leg is settled through the member banks\u2019 current\naccounts maintained with RBI, Mumbai.\n107. During the period November 12, 2002 to March 31, 2003, 91 settlements\nhave taken place covering 98,206 transactions amounting to over US $ 65\nbillion.  CCIL has lines of credit amounting to US $ 275 million from a foreign\nbank and Rs.800 crore from 7 Indian banks to take care of any unforeseen\ncontingency.  This new facility for clearing and settling dollar-rupee transactions\nin India is likely to provide substantial cost and time benefits to banks.\nGovernment Securities Market\n108. The Reserve Bank has taken a number of initiatives in the recent past in\ndeveloping and deepening the government securities market.  Further, NDS\nhas been made operational for enabling on-line trading and dissemination of44\ntrade information on a near real-time basis.  The supervision of PDs was\nstrengthened with prescription of certain minimum disclosure norms and\nextending repo eligibility to CSGL/gilt account holders. The progress and recent\ndevelopments in these directions are reviewed in the Annex.\nUrban Co-operative Banks\n109. As indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002, a Committee set\nup by the Government (Chairman: Hon. Shri Anant Geete) had made a number\nof recommendations in its report on problems faced by Urban Co-operative\nBanks ( UCBs). In pursuance of the recommendations made by the Committee\nand in consultation with the Government of India, certain relaxations are\nproposed in respect of gold loans, placement of deposits with other scheduled\nUCBs and limits on unsecured advances.\n(a) 90 days Norm for Recognition of Loan Impairment \u2013 Exemptions\n110. With a view to moving towards international best practices and to ensure\ngreater transparency, commercial banks (including RRBs) and UCBs were\nadvised to adopt 90 days norm for recognition of loan impairment from the year\nending March 31, 2004.  In response to the difficulties expressed by the UCBs\nand their federations in adopting this norm in respect of the large number of\nsmall loans and gold loans granted by them, it is proposed:\n\u2022 To exempt both gold loans and small loans up to Rs.1 lakh from the 90\ndays norm for recognition of loan impairment. These loans would\ncontinue to be governed by the 180 days norm for classification as NPA.\n(b) Facility for Placement of Deposits with other Scheduled UCBs\n111. It was indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2001 that UCBs\nwould not be permitted to increase the term deposit balances with other UCBs\nand the outstanding deposits had to be unwound before end-June 2002.  In45\nview of the difficulties expressed by UCBs in managing their short-term surplus\nfunds while adhering to this prescription, it is proposed:\n\u2022 To permit UCBs to place deposits with strong scheduled UCBs (other\nthan banks classified as weak or sick) with certain conditions. Detailed\nguidelines in this regard are being issued separately.\n(c) Enhancement of Limit in the Ceiling on Unsecured Advances\n112. At present, a ceiling of Rs.25 ,000 for UCBs with demand and time\nliabilities (DTL) of less than Rs.10 crore and Rs.50,000 for UCBs with DTL of\nRs.10 crore and above has been prescribed for granting unsecured advances\nto a  single  borrower/connected group.   In order to provide greater flexibility, it\nis proposed to revise the ceiling on the unsecured advances by the UCBs as\nunder:\nType of UCBCeiling on unsecured\nadvances\n(a) Non-scheduled UCBs with DTL\n      of less than Rs.10 croreRs.50,000\n(b) Non-scheduled UCBs with DTL\n     of more than Rs.10 croreRs.1 lakh\n(c) Scheduled UCBs Rs. 2 lakh\nThe enhanced ceiling would not be applicable to weak/sick UCBs.\n113. The aggregate of unsecured advances granted by a UCB to its members\nas a whole, would continue to be within the overall ceiling of 33 ? per cent of\nthe bank\u2019s DTL as hitherto.\n(d) Timely Compliance with Inspection Reports\n114. At present, UCBs have to prepare a compliance report on the inspection\nreport in a prescribed proforma and submit the same to the regional office\nof Urban Banks Department within a period of six months from the date of\nreceipt of the inspection report.  The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)46\nwhich enquired into the stock market scam and matters relating thereto,\nrecommended that:\n\u201cRBI must introduce a system whereby the irregularities pointed out in\nthe annual inspection reports are removed by the banks and compliance report\nis submitted within a period of six months from the date of inspection\u201d.\n\u2022 In line with the above recommendation of the JPC, it has been decided\nthat UCBs would be given a maximum period of six months from the\ndate of the inspection report to remove the irregularities pointed out in\nthe inspection report in all respects, failing which RBI will invoke the\npenal provisions.\n(e) Mandatory Concurrent Audit\n115. At present, all scheduled and other UCBs with deposits of over\nRs. 50  crore are required to introduce the system of concurrent audit.  The JPC\nhas recommended that:\n\u201cAs an apex body, though it is not possible for RBI to monitor each and\nevery transaction, it is essential that concurrent audit is conducted in the banks\non a regular basis.  The RBI may consider making this mandatory\u201d.\n\u2022 In line with the above recommendation of the JPC, all UCBs are advised\nto introduce concurrent audit with immediate effect.\n   (f) Loans and Advances by UCBs to their Directors\n116. In regard to loans and advances or other financial accommodation by\nUCBs to their directors, the JPC has recommended that:\n\u201cIn order to prevent irregularities of the type surfaced in the case of some\nof the cooperative banks which were examined by the Committee, they are of\nthe view that full ban on granting of loans and advances to the directors and\ntheir relatives, or the concerns in which they are interested needs to be47\nimposed.  Appropriate legal procedures may be initiated to ensure that there is\nno conflict of interest in the grant of loans and advances to the directors and\ntheir relatives and the concerns in which they are interested\u201d.\n\u2022 In line with the above recommendation of the JPC, UCBs, with\nimmediate effect, should not grant loans and advances (both secured\nand unsecured) to directors, their relatives and firms/concerns/\ncompanies in which they are interested.\nExisting advances extended prior to April 29, 2003 may be allowed to continue\nup to the date when they are due.  These advances should not be renewed or\nextended further.\nSupervision and Monitoring\n117. Progress made in respect of certain announcements made in the mid-\nterm Review of October 2002 is reviewed below.\n(a) Risk Based Supervision\n118. It was indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002 that certain\nmanagement processes were initiated by RBI for switching over to risk based\nsupervision (RBS) of banks during 2003.  These processes included circulation\nof the risk profile template (RPT) for use by banks, training on RBS and\ncompilation of RBS manual.  In this context, a number of banks had undertaken\nan assessment of risks as per the RPT.  A review of these assessments\nrevealed that banks are capable of adopting the risk-profiling system on their\nown and the template can be used for risk analysis and in facilitating the\nprocess of switching over to RBS. An internal Group was also set up at the\ninstance of Board for Financial Supervision (BFS) to assess the preparedness48\nof banks to switch over to RBS regime.  The Group concluded that in terms of\npreparedness, banks could be segregated into three groups.  The first group,\nwhere RBS can be implemented immediately, could include banks that have\ndeveloped advanced risk management architecture, MIS and IT, internal control\nsystem and trained manpower. The second group which may require about six\nmonths to one year for implementing RBS, could comprise banks that have\ntaken steps to remove the identified gaps in their systems, but are not yet fully\nready.  The third group would consist of banks which require more time than\ntheir counterparts in the second group.   It is proposed to implement RBS of a\nfew select banks on pilot basis during April-June 2003.  Based on the\nexperience gained, RBS would be extended to all banks in a phased manner.\n(b) Prompt Corrective Action\n119. As indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002, an internal Group\nwas set up to study the impact of the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework\non select weak banks.  On the basis of the impact study, the scheme of PCA\nwas announced in December 2002 with the approval of Board for Financial\nSupervision (BFS) and the Government.  In terms of the scheme, RBI would\ninitiate certain structured action in respect of banks which have hit the trigger\npoints in terms of capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR), net non-\nperforming assets (NPA) and return on assets (ROA).  The Reserve Bank, at its\ndiscretion, would also resort to additional discretionary actions under each of\nthe trigger points. However, the PCA framework does not preclude RBI from\ntaking any other action, as it deems fit, in addition to the corrective actions\nprescribed in the framework.  The scheme of PCA has been put in place initially\nfor a period of one year and would be reviewed in December 2003.  Banks have\nbeen advised to place the scheme before their Boards and take necessary\nsteps in advance in order to ensure that as far as possible, they do not come\nwithin the scope of PCA framework.\n(c) Consolidated Accounting and Supervision49\n120. It was indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002 that guidelines\non consolidated accounting and supervision were being finalised in consultation\nwith banks. On the basis of the feedback received, the guidelines were\nmodified, wherever necessary. The final guidelines have been issued and\nbanks were advised to ensure strict compliance commencing from the year\nended   March 31, 2003.  The guidelines would be reviewed after one year from\nthe date of implementation.\n(d) Macro-prudential Indicators\n121. It was indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002 that the scope\nand coverage of macro-prudential indicators ( MPIs) were enhanced in the\nreview for the half-year ended March 2002 and the salient features of the MPI\nreport would be published.  Accordingly, the salient features of the MPI review\nfor March 2002 was published in the Report on Trend and Progress of Banking\nin India 2001-02.\n(e) Other Supervisory Initiatives\n122. Other supervisory initiatives are as under:\n(i) The Reserve Bank has issued, in December 2002, a guidance note\non risk-based internal audit system to banks.  Banks are advised to\nplace the same before their Boards for initiating necessary steps for\ntransition to the system in a phased manner.\n(ii) Detailed guidelines for preventing slippage of NPA accounts from\nsub-standard to doubtful/loss category were issued to banks\nsuggesting, inter alia, that banks can introduce a new asset\ncategory of \u201cspecial mention accounts\u201d in between \u201cstandard\u201d and\n\u201csub-standard\u201d accounts for their own internal monitoring and\nfollow-up.50\n(iii) A comprehensive check-list for conducting computer audit\nrecommended by the Committee on Computer Audit was circulated\nto banks and FIs.  In addition, an Information System Audit Cell has\nbeen formed in RBI to scrutinise annual financial inspection (AFI)\nreports for initiating corrective action, if any, at an early stage.  The\nCell has also been entrusted with the work of updating the check-list\nwith latest developments, revision of guidance notes for banks on\nrisks and controls in computer and communication systems, and\nupdating the Manual for inspection of banks in computerised\nenvironment on an ongoing basis.\nPrudential Measures\n123. The prudential norms  are aimed at imparting strength to banks and\nfinancial institutions, inculcating greater accountability and market discipline and\ncreating a secure and conducive environment for the smooth and effective\nfunctioning of the financial system. These norms cover not only capital\nadequacy, asset classification and provisioning but also exposure rules,\naccounting standards, transparency and disclosure, risk management and\nasset-liability management system.  In this context, RBI\u2019s approach has been to\nbenchmark the norms with international standards and introduce the same after\nextensive consultations.  It has also been a standard practice to allow the\nparticipants to absorb changes incrementally without causing any major\ndislocation.\n124. The New Capital Accord,  presently under consideration of the Basel\nCommittee, aims at capturing major risks inherent in a bank\u2019s operations and\nenvisages enhancement of risk sensitivity.  In order to equip banks to identify,\nmeasure, monitor and control the various types of risks assumed by them, RBI\nhas, over a period, issued various guidelines and guidance notes taking into\naccount the overall ability of banks to adopt them.  The Reserve Bank has also\ntaken a number of proactive steps and rationalised various prudential norms to51\nprepare banks to understand the complexity and lessen the burden of costs\ninvolved in adhering to the international standards. These steps include phased\nprovisioning, building up of investment fluctuation reserve (IFR) to guard\nagainst interest rate risks, refining asset-liability management systems with\ntolerance levels, assessing the impact of the proposed New Capital Accord on\nbanks by conducting quantitative impact studies (QIS), relaxing exposure norms\nand permitting concessional risk weights in critical areas of importance and\nputting in place a sound \u2018know your customer\u2019 (KYC) policy and adopting anti-\nmoney laundering measures.\n125. Taking into account the preliminary results of the QIS, the Basel\nCommittee is fine-tuning risk weights assigned to banks\u2019 exposures to retail\ncustomers, small and medium enterprises ( SMEs), residential mortgages,\nsecuritisation transactions, past due loans etc., reflecting the risk characteristics\nof these exposures.  The Basel Committee is also considering entrusting the\nsupervisors with discretion for estimating capital charge for operational risk\nappropriate to risk profile of the bank.\n126.  In view of global competition and progressive liberalisation in the\nexternal sector of the economy along with increasing capital account\nconvertibility, banking sector will be facing new challenges.  This process\nrequires banks to build up effective and well co- ordinated long-term strategies\nto keep pace with reforms.  Further measures in this direction are indicated\nbelow.\n(a) Investment Fluctuation Reserve\n127. At present, the investment fluctuation reserve (IFR) is treated as Tier II\ncapital up to a maximum of 1.25 per cent of the total risk-weighted assets.  As\nsuggested by banks, and to give further relaxation in building IFR, it is proposed\nthat:52\n\u00b7 While IFR would continue to be treated as Tier II capital, it would not be\nsubject to the ceiling of 1.25 per cent of the total risk-weighted assets.\nHowever, for the purpose of compliance with the capital adequacy\nnorms, Tier II capital including IFR, would be considered up to a\nmaximum of 100 per cent of total Tier I capital.\n(b) Branch Licensing\n128. In the recent period, the policy for commercial banks has been\nsubstantially liberalised.  Banks\u2019 Boards have been empowered to decide on\nthe policy and strategy for setting up of new branches, closing and shifting of\nexisting branches, subject to certain conditions.  In order to encourage more\nefficient banking services all over the country, it is proposed to provide further\nflexibility in the branch licensing policy.  Accordingly:\n\u2022 RBI will consider favourably any proposal for transfer of branches in rural\nand semi-urban centres from one commercial bank to another by mutual\nagreement.  Banks will be expected to ensure that such mutually agreed\ntransfers do not adversely affect the available banking services in that\narea.\n     (c) Policy for Raising Long-term Bonds by Banks\n129. At present, banks are permitted to issue long-term subordinated debt in\nthe nature of unsecured redeemable bonds which qualify for inclusion in Tier II\ncapital.  Apart from raising resources through Tier II capital bonds, in order to\nrealign the portfolios from the asset-liability management angle, and to honour\nthe long-term commitments, banks have expressed their desire to raise\nlong-term resources from the market which are not in the nature of\nsubordinated debt.  It is proposed to accept this suggestion, and suitable policy\nguidelines for banks in this regard will be worked out in consultation with them.53\n(d) Provisioning in respect of NPAs which would be sold to\n     Securitisation/Asset Reconstruction Companies\n130. The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and\nEnforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002, allows securitisation/reconstruction\ncompanies created under the Act, to purchase non-performing assets ( NPAs)\nfrom banks.  In order to facilitate sale of NPAs to securitisation/reconstruction\ncompanies, guidelines to banks and FIs have been issued covering, inter alia,\n(i) policy for sale of assets to securitisation/reconstruction companies approved\nby the Board; (ii) accounting treatment of sale of NPAs and investment in\nbonds, debentures, security receipts which may be offered by the securitisation/\nreconstruction companies and valuation thereof; (iii) capital adequacy\nrequirements and exposure norms applicable to the above investments; and\n(iv) disclosure requirements.  It is envisaged that banks would be able\nto sell their NPAs to securitisation/reconstruction companies at   considerable\ndiscount and the resultant shortfall, if any, in the net book value after deducting\nprovisions held, would be required to be debited to the profit and loss account.\nBanks are, therefore, advised to build up provisions, significantly above the\nminimum regulatory requirements, for their NPAs particularly for those assets\nwhich they propose to sell to securitisation/reconstruction companies.\n(e) Country Risk Management\n131. It was indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002 that dr aft\nguidelines on country risk management together with a \u2018Note for Discussion\u2019\nwere forwarded to banks and were also placed on the RBI website seeking\ncomments and views. The guidelines were finalised in consultation with banks\nand have since been issued.  These guidelines are applicable only in respect of\ncountries where a bank has exposure of 2.0 per cent or more of its assets.\nBanks are advised to place the guidelines before their Boards and take\nappropriate steps for implementation. A review would be made after one year\ntaking into account the experience of banks in implementing the guidelines.54\nTechnology Upgradation\n132. The Reserve Bank has assigned priority to the upgradation of\ntechnological infrastructure in the financial system.  In this direction, the\nPayments System Vision Document, giving the nature and direction of reforms\nneeded to achieve the vision, was set out.  Substantial progress has been\nmade since then for developing a modern, efficient, integrated and secure\npayment and settlement system for the financial services sectors.\nModernisation of clearing and settlement through MICR based cheque clearing,\npopularising electronic clearing services (ECS) and integration of RBI-EFT\nscheme with funds transfer schemes of banks, introduction of centralised funds\nmanagement system (CFMS) are significant milestones in this regard.\nIntroduction of cheque truncation and imaging of paper-based cheques had\nalso been envisaged to reduce the time lags in realisation of cheques. An\nefficient, cost-effective and dependable communication backbone \u2013 the\nINFINET \u2013 was established on which the structured financial messaging\nsolution (SFMS) is being implemented.  Further, RBI is monitoring on an\nongoing basis the progress in respect of implementation of core banking\nsolutions by banks, as the future of banking and finance revolves around\nmeeting the challenges arising out of large scale growth in technology. This\nrequires concerted efforts by all participants in the financial system to maximise\nefficiency and reduce costs.  Further developments in this direction are\nreviewed in the Annex .\nDevelopments in Currency Management System\n133. Over the years, the growth in volume of currency has posed serious\nproblems in regard to the currency management function of RBI in the areas of\nsupply of notes, quality of notes and withdrawal of notes from circulation.\nFurther, RBI has adopted a Clean Note Policy since 1999 towards improving\nthe quality of notes in circulation.   In order to maintain the quality of growing\nvolume of notes in circulation, as a long-term measure, mechanisation of the55\nnote processing and destruction activity was taken up at all issue offices of RBI.\nAs this requires notes in an unstapled condition, RBI has advised banks not to\nuse wire stapling.\n134. Further, as part of customer service, banks have been advised to open\ncertain currency chest branches on Sundays for providing note exchange\nfacility and distribution of coins.  Banks have also been advised to install note\ncounting/note sorting machines at currency chests/major bank branches of\nadequate size. A Currency Link was set up at RBI website which covers various\naspects related to Indian currency and coinage, images and security features of\ncontemporary bank notes in the Mahatma Gandhi series, frequently asked\nquestions ( FAQs) and press releases on currency issues.  Banks are advised to\ngive wide publicity to the initiatives in the area of currency management for\nconvenience of the public as also provision of good quality bank notes.\nLegal Reforms\n135. In the recent past, changes in the financial markets and advancement in\ninformation technology have necessitated changes in the legal structure. The\nmid-term Review of October 2002 listed out various proposals submitted to the\nGovernment for making the legal system more efficient to manage the emerging\nscenario.  While legislative action has been completed in respect of certain\nproposals, some of the proposals are under consideration.  Progress made in\nthis direction is given in the Annex .\nMid-term Review\n136. A review of the monetary and credit developments in the first half of the\ncurrent year will be undertaken in October 2003.  The mid-term Review will be\nconfined to a review of monetary developments and to such changes as may be\nnecessary in monetary policy and projections for the second half of the year.56\nMumbai\nApril  29, 2003\nAnnexes\nI.Working Groups: Progress Report\nII.Legal Reforms: Review of Developments\nIII. Technology Upgradation: Review of Developments\nIV. Developments in Government Securities Market\nV.Recent Foreign Exchange Liberalisation Measures:\nCurrent and Capital Accounts57\nAnnex I.  Working Groups: Progress Report\nFlexibility in Interest Rate\nAs indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002, banks were\nencouraged to make efforts to popularise flexible deposit schemes among the\ndepositors as these were in the long-term interest of banks as well as\ndepositors.  Further, in order to improve flexibility in the interest rate, banks\nwere given freedom to decide the period of reset on variable rate deposits.  In\nthis context, a Working Group has also been constituted (Chairman: Shri H.N.\nSinor, Joint Managing Director, ICICI Bank Ltd.) with members from major\nbanks and RBI to examine various issues concerning the deposit rates\nincluding floating rate of interest on fixed deposits.\nTransparency and Accounting Standards\nIt was indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2002 that a\nWorking Group (Chairman: Shri N.D. Gupta, former President, ICAI) was\nconstituted to identify compliance by banks, as also gaps in compliance with the\naccounting standards issued by the ICAI and recommend steps to\neliminate/reduce the gaps.  On the basis of recommendations of the Group,\nfinal guidelines were issued for compliance with effect from the accounting year\nended March 31, 2003.\nProgress in Corporate Debt Restructuring\nAs indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002, a High Level\nGroup (Chairman: Shri Vepa Kamesam, Deputy Governor) was constituted to\nreview the operations of Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) scheme in order\nto identify the operational difficulties, if any, and suggest measures to make the\nscheme more efficient.  Based on the recommendations of the High Level58\nGroup and in consultation with the Government, a revised scheme of CDR was\nfinalised and issued to banks for implementation.\nShort-term Liquidity Forecasting Model\nIt was indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002 that a short-\nterm liquidity forecasting model was developed by RBI under the guidance of an\nAdvisory Committee of academics and was operationalised for internal\nevaluation.  The generic form of the model was made available on RBI website\nfor suggestions and comments.  The results of the model are being used by RBI\nfor policy analysis and assessment since November 2002. The model is also\nback-tested routinely to validate its performance by comparing the forecasts\nwith actuals.  The model is being updated on an ongoing basis to improve its\nperformance.\nInternational Financial Standards and Codes\nIt was indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2002 that the ten\nAdvisory Groups constituted by the Standing Committee on International\nFinancial Standards and Codes had submitted their reports.  As indicated in the\nmid-term Review of October 2002, an internal Technical Group, constituted by\nthe Standing Committee to assess India\u2019s position vis-\u00e0-vis  international\nstandards on \u2018market integrity\u2019 also submitted its report. Subsequently, a\nsynthesis report covering the recommendations of all Advisory/Technical\nGroups was submitted to the Standing Committee. These reports, including the\nreport of the Standing Committee, were placed on the RBI website for wider\ndissemination and comments.\nResidential Mortgage Backed Securities\nAs indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002, the Working Group\n(Chairman: Shri R.V. Verma, Executive Director, National Housing Bank) set up59\nto examine the modalities for widening the investor base, improving the quality\nof assets, creating liquidity for trading in mortgage backed securities (MBS) of\nhousing finance companies ( HFCs) and other related issues submitted its report\nin December 2002.  The recommendations of the Group are under examination.60\nAnnex II.

Technology Upgradation: Review of Developments\nImplementation of Centralised Funds Management System\nThe centralised funds management system (CFMS) provides for a\ncentralised viewing of balance positions of the account holders across different\naccounts maintained at various locations of RBI.  While the first phase of the\nsystem covering the centralised funds enquiry system (CFES) has been made\navailable to the users, the second phase comprising the centralised funds\ntransfer system (CFTS) would be made available by the middle of 2003.  So far,\n54 banks have implemented the system at their treasuries/funds management\nbranches.\nCertification and Digital Signatures\nThe mid-term Review of October 2002 indicated the need for information\nsecurity on the network and the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) by banks.\nThe Controller of Certifying Authorities, Government of India, have approved\nthe Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) as\na Certification Authority (CA) for digital signatures.   Consequently, the process\nof setting up of registration authorities (RA) under the CA has commenced at\nvarious banks. In addition to the negotiated dealing system (NDS), the\nelectronic clearing service (ECS) and electronic funds transfer (EFT) are also\nbeing enhanced in terms of security by means of implementation of PKI and\ndigital signatures using the facilities offered by the CA.\nCommittee on Payment Systems\nIn order to examine the entire gamut of the process of reforms in\npayment and settlement systems which would be culminating with the real time\ngross settlement (RTGS) system, a Committee on Payment Systems\n(Chairman: Dr. R.H. Patil) was set up in 2002.  The Committee, after examining63\nthe various aspects relating to payment and settlement systems, submitted its\nreport in September 2002 along with a draft Payment Systems Bill.  The draft\nBill provides, inter alia, a legal basis for netting, apart from empowering RBI to\nhave regulatory and oversight powers over payment and settlement systems of\nthe country.  The report of the Committee was put on the RBI website for wider\ndissemination. The draft Bill has been forwarded to the Government.\nMulti-application Smart Cards\nRecognising the need for technology based payment products and the\ngrowing importance of smart card based payment flows, a pilot project for multi-\napplication smart cards in conjunction with a few banks and vendors, under the\naegis of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology,\nGovernment of India, has been initiated.  The project is aimed at the formulation\nof standards for multi-application smart cards on the basis of inter-operable\nsystems and technological components of the entire system.\nSpecial Electronic Funds Transfer\nAs indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002, national EFT\n(NEFT) is being introduced using the backbone of the structured financial\nmessaging system (SFMS) of the IDRBT. NEFT would provide for movement of\nelectronic transfer of funds in a safe, secure and quick manner across branches\nof any bank to any other bank through a central gateway of each bank, with the\ninter-bank settlement being effected in the books of account of banks\nmaintained at RBI.  Since this scheme requires connectivity across a large\nnumber of branches at many cities, a special EFT (SEFT) was introduced in\nApril 2003 covering about 3000 branches in 500 cities.  This has facilitated\nsame day transfer of funds across accounts of constituents at all these\nbranches.64\nNational Settlement System\nThe clearing and settlement activities are dispersed through 1,047\nclearing houses managed by RBI, the State Bank of India and its associates,\npublic sector banks and other institutions.  In order to facilitate banks to have\nbetter control over their funds, it is proposed to introduce national settlement\nsystem (NSS) in a phased manner.\nReal Time Gross Settlement System\nAs indicated in the mid-term Review of October 2002, development of\nthe various software modules for the RTGS system is in progress.  The initial\nset of modules is expected to be delivered by June 2003 for members to\nconduct tests and familiarisation exercises. The live run of RTGS is scheduled\ntowards the end of 2003.65\nAnnex IV.  Developments in Government Securities Market\nCalendar for Issuance of Dated Securities\nThe system of releasing the calendar for issuance of Government of\nIndia dated securities every half-year was introduced in 2002-03. These\ncalendars were generally adhered to with some minor deviations with regard to\nthe timing of the auctions, amounts raised and also the tenor of the security\nfrom the scheduled issuances. An indicative calendar for the first half of the\nfinancial year 2003-04 was issued on March 31, 2003.\nConsolidation of Debt of Government of India\nThe Reserve Bank has been resorting to consolidation of securities since\n1999 through reissuance of existing securities. In line with this process, 19 out\nof 31 securities issued during 2002-03 were reissues. Out of an amount of\nRs.1,25,000 crore (gross) raised through dated securities under the market\nborrowing programme of the Central Government, an amount of Rs.74,000\ncrore (59 per cent of the gross amount) represented reissuances.\nAs at the end of March 2003, out of 117 outstanding marketable\ngovernment securities of Rs.6 ,73,905 crore, 29 securities with outstanding\nstock of Rs.10,000 crore or more account for 54 per cent. RBI will continue to\nundertake such passive consolidation through reopenings.\nThe Government of India has also announced in Budget 2003-04 its\nintention to offer a buy-back of loans contracted under the high cost regime of\nthe past and issue new securities at current market yield. The buy-back will be\nentirely on a voluntary basis from banks that are in need of liquidity, or\nencashing the premium for making provisions for their non-performing assets\n(NPAs) thereby improving their balance sheets.   Such switch operations would\nalso result in consolidation of debt.  The details of the schemes are being\nworked out by the Government in consultation with RBI.66\nThe Government of India also introduced a debt swap scheme in order to\nrestructure state governments' debt. T his policy measure will help in reduction\nof the interest burden of the States by prepayment to the Centre out of the\nproceeds of fresh market borrowings and additional resources out of full\nallocation of small savings collections to the States.  In 2002-03, Rs.10 ,000\ncrore were raised as market loans for this purpose. The debt swap scheme is\nexpected to continue for the next few years depending on market conditions\nand liquidity position.\nTrading on Stock Exchanges\nIn order to enlarge the number of participants and to provide country-\nwide access to trading in government securities, a scheme of anonymous\nscreen-based order-driven trading in government securities on the stock\nexchanges in accordance with the accepted best practices relating to trading\nand settlement was announced in Budget 2002-03.  Accordingly, a facility has\nbeen provided to buy and sell government securities through the stock\nexchanges (NSE, BSE and OTCEI) with effect from January 16, 2003.\nExtension of Repo to CSGL Account Holders\nEarlier, only subsidiary general ledger (SGL) account holders with RBI,\nMumbai, were permitted to enter into ready forward (repo) transactions in\ngovernment securities and Treasury Bills.  In order to increase the investor\nbase of repo market coupled with the need to make call/notice money market a\npure inter-bank market, RBI has now permitted non-SGL account holders to\nenter into repos in government securities including Treasury Bills, effective from\nMarch 3, 2003.  The non-SGL account holders can now enter into ready\nforward contracts through their gilt accounts maintained with the custodians\nunder the constituents\u2019 subsidiary general ledger (CSGL) facility, subject to\ncertain guidelines.67\nGovernment Securities Lending Scheme of CCIL\nClearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) has been a major facilitator\nof transactions in the government securities market as it provides guaranteed\nsettlement of trades. To ensure smooth settlement, CCIL has been permitted by\nRBI to enter into arrangements with select members to borrow required\ngovernment securities from them under its Securities Lending Scheme.\nGuidelines for Uniform Accounting of Repo/\nReverse Repo Transactions\nThe Reserve Bank has issued guidelines for uniform accounting norms\nfor repo and reverse repo transactions in consultation with market participants.\n Rollover of Repos\nIn the mid-term Review of October 2002, the proposal to allow rollover of\nrepo contracts using the same securities between the same counterparties was\nannounced. On completion of modifications in settlement related systems ,  the\nrollover of repos will be permitted subject to proper safeguards.\nOperationalisation of STRIPS\nThe Reserve Bank has accepted the recommendations of the Working\nGroup on operational and prudential guidelines on STRIPS for dates for\nconsolidation of coupon strips (March/September 25 and May/November 30).\nIn order to consolidate coupon volume, it has been decided to issue new\nsecurities to the extent feasible.  The primary dealers ( PDs) which meet certain\nfinancial criteria laid down for this purpose will be authorised to undertake\nstripping and reconstitution of securities. The Reserve Bank will act as a\nregistry for stripped bonds. The accrued discount value of the STRIPS along\nwith the book value of the same will be reckoned for SLR purposes. FIMMDA\nwill publish the market rates for stripped zero coupon bonds on a monthly basis\nfor valuation and tax purposes. At present, RBI is in the process of drawing up68\nthe detailed specifications required for the development of the\nstripping/reconstitution module in the public debt office (PDO)/negotiated\ndealing system (NDS).69\nAnnex  V.

With a view to ensuring larger flow of credit to trade and industry in the State on the one\nhand and bringing about appropriate changes in the monitoring mechanism on the other, the\nposition in regard to relaxations/concessions announced from time to  time has since been\nreviewed and the following revised comprehensive package of concessions/ relaxations is\nprepared for immediate implementation by banks operating in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n(i)   Increased working capital facilities may be sanctioned by way of relaxation in prescribed/\nstandardised norms for inventory and receivables upto a maximum of 50%, depending on the\nmerits of each case.   For  small borrowers in the unorganised sector, for whom no norms for\ninventory and receivables have been specified, relaxation upto a maximum of 50% of the norms\naccepted for last sanction may also be allowed depending on merits.           Benefits of relaxed\nnorms may be extended as realistically as possible to such borrowers. As regards changes in the\nlevel of credit on purchases, the banks may take a realistic approach for all borrowers. The-\nincremental Permissible Bank Finance (POF) due to application of relaxed norms only should be\nlimited to 50% .\n     The application of relaxed inventory and receivable norms would, however, be subject to the\ncondition that no slip back in current    ratio takes place, except under circumstances as specified\nby RBI vide DBOD Circular CAS.(COD)BC.90/ 27C -78 dated 17 July 1978. These would be\napplicable for all borrowers, including those not covered under Credit Monitoring Arrangement\n(CMA). If the borrower is not in a position to augment Net Working Capital to the desired extent\nat one go, the need-based relaxed norms may be applied in more than one stage.(ii) All borrowal accounts, irrespective of whether ad-hoc facilities were sanctioned in the past or\nnot, would be subjected to review by the concerned banks within a period of three months and\nneed based increased working capital facilities may be sanctioned to borrowers without delay.\n(iii) ( a) Finance against accepted hundies ( Usance bills) should be encouraged, (b) while for\nCMA borrowers, the existing ceiling of 75 per cent on finance against book-debts-may continue,\nfor other corporate borrowers, liberal finance against book-debts should be made available, (c)\nfor non-corporate borrowers, where finance need against book-debts is modest, the mode\ncurrently in vogue in certain banks, whereby stocks as well as book-debts are financed under a\nsingle hypothecation agreement upto a maximum of  Rs.2.00 lakns (with share of credit against\nbook-debt limited to 30 per cent) and for which DICGCI cover is also available regarding the\nbook debt portion, should be encouraged. For other borrowers, whose credit requirement against\nbook-debts is higher, the banks should devise a suitable selectivity criteria regarding the eligible\nborrowers, based, inter- alia, on overall risk assessment and past performance in debt realisation.\n       The banks may also evolve a system of risk differentiation. among the eligible debtors for a\nparticular borrower and based on different criteria, variable margins, ranging from 25 per cent to\n40 per cent, should be applied for purposes of arriving at  drawing power.\n(iv) The existing ceiling of 15 per cent on margin  for calculation of drawing power against\ncommodities, not covered by Selective Credit Control directives, may continue.   Similarly,\nmargin for finance against bills should not exceed 10 per cent as hitherto.\n(v) The existing concession of 50 per cent reduction in service tariffs for remittances may\ncontinue. The same may also be extended to collection of outstation bills/cheques.\n(vi) The banks may honour small Fixed Deposit Receipts, say upto Rs.10 ,000/- of the Kashmiri\nmigrants at the designated branches without verifying details from the branch of origin against\nsome indemnity bonds.\n(vii) The following other existing concessions summarised below should continue :-\n(a) For term credits, the banks may adopt a flexible and pragmatic approach as regards debt-\nequity ratio, especially for small projects. Reschedulement of the repayment programme may\nalso be allowed in deserving cases.(b) The banks may review all   irregular accounts within a time-frame of three months with a\nview to exploring  the possibilities of regularising them through sanctioning additional  working\ncapital facilities.\n(c) Period of realisation of bills purchased and advance bills for collection may be extended upto\none month by Branch Managers. I\n(d)   Liberal acceptance credit/ L.C. facilities may  be extended to facilitate purchases on credit.\nThe margin for bank guarantees and inland letters of credit should not exceed 15 per cent,\ndepending on merits of each case.\n(e) The facility for transfer of bank accounts/ funds maintained with their branches in the valley\nto some other designated/ specified branch/ es outside the Valley, at the request of their\ncustomers, may be continued with necessary safeguards so that unauthorised withdrawals or\ntransfers are not encouraged. Similarly, banks may arrange to designate specific branches\noutside-the Valley to receive instruments drawn on their branches in the Valley.\nWe shall, be glad if you will kindly ensure that suitable guidelines are issued to the branches\noperating in the Jammu and Kashmir on the revised package outlined above, in supersession of\nall earlier instructions-on this subject.\n3.  (a) It has been observed that there were few pit-falls in the implementation of the existing\npackage arising out of a certain degree of lack of awareness among branch officials and credit-\nusers, alike. In order to remove this lacunae, the banks may, take special steps to educate and\ninform the managers and controllers of their branches in the State about the details of package on\nthe one hand and corporate strategies for implementing ,these on the other.\n     (b) Also, in each district of the State, the lead bank may convene banker-customer meet, to\nwhich top district level State Government officials could also be invited.\n      (c) The banks in  the State should make special endeavours for avoiding delays in all matters\nof providing banking services. Clearance of instruments, both local and outstation, should be\nprompt. A review of systems and procedure in vogue may also be undertaken for achieving the\nabove    objective. Necessary delegation of authorities may also be made expeditiously in this\ncontext.\n     (d) The power of rejection of any concession should vest in an authority above the immediate\ncontrolling tier of   the concerned branch.     (e) Head Offices of banks may ensure tie up arrangements for funds on the basis of\ninformation to be obtained from their controllers of Jammu and Kashmir branches within a\nperiod of three months of the coming into effect of the revised package, as regards requirement\nof additional credit deployment there. It may   be emphasised that additional fund  requirements\nfor implementing the package thus worked out, may be dovetailed into corporate fund\ndeployment strategy of each bank so that higher flow of credit to the borrowers in the State could\nbe effected within a reasonable period of time.\n    (f) Submission of quarterly data by branches of banks on progress made in implementing the\npackage of concessions may be an integral part of the corpus of control returns to facilitate\neffective monitoring.\n 4.    ( i) Special Cells for monitoring implementation of the package may be formed in all banks\noperating in the State at the Zonal Office level.    The cells would also act as grievance redressal\nagency for the respective banks. The cells would convene quarterly meetings with credit users,\nwhich should be attended by a senior official from the corporate office.\n         (ii )  At   the   State level,   a   committee   comprising representatives of major banks, State\nGovernment, Trade and Industry would be formed to sort-out problems/ grievances against\nbanks. The State level committee would also review the progress  made in implementing the\npackage on the basis of quarterly data. Convenor ,  State   Level Bankers' Committee, would\nprovide secretarial support to this Committee. Review reports of the State Level Committee may\nbe forwarded to local office of Reserve Bank of India for follow-up action.\n5.   Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\nsd/-\n(N.D.

The consultative document on Exchange traded Interest rate derivatives placed on the\nSEBI website considers the introduction of the following products:\na. Ten-year long bond futures\nb. Futures on notional T-Bills with a maturity of 91 days\nc. Options on notional long bond and notional Treasury Bills (T-Bills).\nThe document has also outlined the introduction of futures and options on MIBOR/ MIFOR,\nfutures and options on underlying maturities less than 10 years but more than 3 months,\nswaps, swaptions, caps and floors etc. in a phased manner.\n2. With a view to enabling regulated entities to manage their exposure to interest rate risks, it\nhas been decided to allow the Scheduled Commercial Banks excluding RRBs & LABs\n(SCBs), Primary Dealers ( PDs) and specified All India Financial Institutions ( AIFIs) to deal\nin IRDs in a phased manner. In the first phase, such entities can transact only in interest rate\nfutures on notional bonds and T-Bills for the limited purpose of hedging the risk in their\nunderlying investment portfolio. Allowing transactions in a wider range of products , as also\nmarket making will be considered in the next stage on the basis of the experience gained.\n3. While derivatives present immense opportunity for mitigating the market risks inherent in\nthe balance sheet, it can also expose one to substantial losses on account of inadequate\nunderstanding of the product, absence of proper monitoring, poor risk control measures, etc.\nSCBs and AIFIs desirous of transacting in IRDs on the stock exchanges should take specific\napproval from their Board covering, inter alia, the products that they may transact,\nsize/composition of the investment portfolio intended to be hedged, organizational set-up to\nmonitor, rebalance, report, account and audit such transactions. Further, it is desirable that\nderivative desks are created within the treasury and the management level responsibility\nclearly assigned.\n4. The following norms will be applicable for transacting IRDs on the Futures and Options (F\n& O) segment of the stock exchanges:\ni) Stock exchange regulation : SCBs and AIFIs can seek membership of the F & O\nsegment of the stock exchanges for the limited purpose of undertaking proprietary\ntransactions for hedging interest rate risk. SCBs and AIFIs desirous of taking\ntrading membership on the F & O segment of the stock exchanges should satisfy\nthe membership criteria and also comply with the regulatory norms laid down by\nSEBI and the respective stock exchanges ( BSE/ NSE). Those not seeking\nmembership of SEs, can transact  IRDs  through  approved F & O members of the\nexchanges.\nii) Settlement : As trading members of the F&O segment, SCBs and AIFIs should\nsettle their derivative trades directly with the clearing corporation/clearing house.2\nOn the other hand, those participating through approved F & O members shall\nsettle proprietary trades as a participant clearing member ( PCM). No third party /\nbroker intermediation will be allowed in the settlement of IRDs.\niii) Eligible underlying : For the present, only the interest rate risk inherent in the\ngovernment securities classified  under the Available for Sale ( AFS) and Held for\nTrading ( HFT) categories will be allowed to be hedged. For this purpose, the\nportion of the AFS/ HFT portfolio intended to be hedged must be identified and\ncarved out for monitoring purposes.\niv) Hedge criteria: Interest Rate Derivative transactions undertaken on the exchanges\nshall be deemed as hedge transactions, if and only if,\na) The hedge is clearly identified with the underlying government securities in\nthe AFS/ HFT categories.\nb) The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured\nc) The hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and is \u201chighly effective\u201d\nthroughout the period.\nv) Hedge Effectiveness  : The hedge will be deemed to be \u201chighly effective\u201d if at\ninception and throughout the life of the hedge, changes in the marked to market\nvalue of the hedged items with reference to the marked to market value at the time\nof the hedging are \u201c almost fully offset\u201d  by the changes in the marked to market\nvalue of the hedging instrument and the actual results are within a range of 80% to\n125%. If changes in the marked to market values are outside the 80% -125%\nrange, then the hedge would not be deemed to be highly effective.\nAt present, the investments held in the (a) AFS category are to be marked to\nmarket at quarterly or more frequent intervals (b) HFT category are to be marked\nto market at monthly or more frequent intervals. The hedged portion of the AFS/\nHFT portfolio should be notionally marked to market, at least at monthly\nintervals, for evaluating the efficacy of the hedge transaction.\nvi) Accounting : The Accounting Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered\nAccountants of India ( ICAI) is in the process of developing a comprehensive\nAccounting Standard covering various types of financial instruments including\naccounting for trading and hedging.  However, as the formulation of the Standard\nis likely to take some time, the Institute has brought out a Guidance Note on\nAccounting for Equity Index Futures as an interim measure. Till ICAI comes out\nwith a comprehensive Accounting Standard, SCBs and AIFIs may follow the\nabove guidance note mutatis mutandis  for accounting of interest rate futures also.\nHowever, since SCBs and AIFIs are being permitted to hedge their underlying\nportfolio which is subject to periodical mark to market, the following norms will\napply\na) If the hedge is \u201chighly effective\u201d, the gain or loss on the hedging instruments\nand hedged portfolio may be set off and net loss, if any, should be provided\nfor and net gains if any, ignored for the purpose of Profit & Loss Account.3\nb) If the hedge is not found to be \"highly effective\" no set off will be allowed and\nthe underlying securities will be marked to market as per the norms applicable\nto their respective investment category .\nc) Trading position in futures is not allowed. However, a hedge may be\ntemporarily rendered as not \u201chighly effective\u201d. Under such circumstances, the\nrelevant futures position will be deemed as a trading position. All deemed\ntrading positions should be marked to market as a portfolio on a daily basis\nand losses should be provided for and gains, if any, should be ignored for the\npurpose of Profit & Loss Account. SCBs and AIFIs should strive to restore\ntheir hedge effectiveness at the earliest.\nd) Any gains realized from closing out / settlement of futures contracts can not be\ntaken to Profit & Loss account but carried forward as \"Other Liability\" and\nutilized for meeting depreciation provisions on the investment portfolio.\nvii) Capital adequacy : The notional face value of each interest rate futures contract\nshould be multiplied by the conversion factor given below to arrive at the credit\nequivalent :\nOriginal Maturity Conversion Factor\nLess than one year 0.5 per cent\nOne year and less than two years 1.0 per cent\nFor each additional year 1.0 per cent\nThe credit equivalent thus obtained shall be multiplied by the applicable risk\nweight of 100%. The risk weight for market risk charge on the underlying\ngovernment securities will remain  unchanged at 2.5%.\nviii) ALM classification: Interest rate futures are treated as a combination of a long and\nshort position in a notional government security. The maturity of a future will be\nthe period until delivery or exercise of the contract, as also the life of the\nunderlying instrument.

V. Sardesai)\nChief General Manager-in-ChargeCredit Facilities to Minority Communities\n1.The Government of India have indicated that  care should be taken to see that minority\ncommunities secure, in a fair and adequate measure the benefits flowing from various\nGovernment sponsored special programmes including 20-Point Programme.  All commercial\nbanks, both in public and private sector  have been advised to ensure smooth flow of bank\ncredit to minority communities.\n2.Definition of Minority Communities\n2.1 The  following   communities  have  been  notified  as  minority  communities  by   the\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Welfare:\n(a) Sikhs\n(b) Muslims\n(c) Christians\n(d) Zoroastrians\n(e) Buddhists\n3.Creation of Special Cell and Designating an exclusive Officer\n3.1 A  Special   Cell  should  be set  up  in  each   bank  to ensure      smooth    flow    of\ncredit  to  minority communities and it should be headed by an officer holding the rank\nof Deputy General Manager/Assistant General Manager or any other similar rank who\nshould function as a \u2018Nodal Officer\u2019.\n3.2 The Lead Bank in each of the minority concentration  districts should have an officer\nwho shall exclusively look after the problems regarding the credit flow to minority\ncommunities.  It shall be his responsibility to publicise among the minority\ncommunities various programmes of bank credit and also to prepare suitable schemes\nfor their benefit in collaboration with branch managers.  (List of Minority concentration\ndistricts at Annexure II)\n3.3 The designated officer should exclusively look after aspects relating to credit assistance\nto  minority communities in the concerned districts.  The designated officer may be\nattached to the Lead Bank set up at the district level.  He would thus, be able to receive\nnecessary guidance from Lead Bank Officer, who will be senior enough and have\nadequate  experience for liasing effectively with the other credit institutions and\nGovernment agencies, and will also be working in close collaboration with the branch\nmanagers of other banks in the district.  The designated officer will also arrange group\nmeetings for their guidance for formulation of schemes suitable for the members of the\nminority communities.  It will be necessary for the banks concerned to ensure that the\nrole assigned to the designated officer/s is effectively fulfilled.\n3.4 The convenor banks of the District Consultative Committees ( DCCs) and the StateLevel Bankers Committees ( SLBCs) should ensure that steps taken to facilitate the flow\nof credit to the minority communities and the progress made in this regard are reviewed\nregularly at their meetings.\n3.5 The Convenor banks of DLRC/ SLRM/ SLBCs may invite Chairman/Managing\nDirectors of State Minority Commissions/Boards or the State Minorities Financial\nCorporations or their representatives to attend the meetings of District Level Review\nCommittee ( DLRC), State Level Review Meeting ( SLRM) and State Level Bankers\nCommittee ( SLBC).\n3.6 Names, designation and office addresses  of ( i)  the officer-in-charge of  the Special\nCell at Head Office and (ii) officer appointed by Lead Banks in the identified districts\nto look after exclusively  the problems of minority communities, should be furnished by\nbanks to the National Commission for Minorities  at the following  address and updated\nperiodically:\nThe Secretary,\nNational Commission for Minorities,\nGovernment of India,\nLok Nayak Bhavan,\n5th Floor, Khan Market,\nNew Delhi \u2013 110 003.\nA copy of the relevant communication may also be furnished to RBI, Central Office.\n3.7 The Lead Banks in the identified districts having concentration of    minority\ncommunities may involve the State Minority Commission  /Finance Corporation  in the\nextension work including creating awareness, identification of beneficiaries, preparation\nof viable  projects, provision of backward and forward linkages such as supply of\ninputs/marketing, recovery etc.\n3.8 The Lead Banks in the identified districts may collaborate with  DDMs of NABARD /\nNGOs /  Voluntary Organizations in    reaching   the poor through Self Help Groups\n(SHGs).\n4Advances under DRI Scheme\nBanks may route loans under the DRI scheme through State Minority Finance/Development\nCorporation on the same terms and conditions as  are applicable  to  loans   routed   through\nSC/ST   Development Corporations, subject to the beneficiaries of the Corporations meeting\nthe eligibility criteria and other terms and conditions prescribed under the scheme.\n5.Monitoring\n5.1 With   a view to monitoring the performance of banks in providing credit to the\nspecified minority communities, data on credit assistance provided to members of\nminority communities should be furnished to Reserve Bank of India and to theGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Welfare, on half yearly basis\nas on the last Friday of March and September  every year.

For this purpose, banks should include\nsuitable lecture sessions as part of all relevant training programmes like induction\ncourses, programmes on rural lending, financing of priority sectors, poverty alleviation\nprogrammes, etc.\n6.2 The Lead Banks functioning in the identified  districts should organize Entrepreneur\nDevelopment Programmes so that the members of the minority communities in these\nareas are enabled to derive the benefit of various programmes being financed by the\nbanks.  Depending upon the major vocation and type of activity undertaken by large\nsections of the people in the districts, suitable programmes may be organized in co-\noperation with State Governments , Industries Department, District Industries Centre,\nSIDBI, State Technical Consultancy Organisation, Khadi and Village  Industries\nCommission and other voluntary organizations which are fully equipped to impart such\ntraining and orientation.  The duration of the programme, the course content, the faculty\nsupport to be selected etc. should be decided by each lead bank taking into account theprevailing conditions, need and existing skills as well as aptitude of the people in the\ndistrict.\n6.3 The Lead Banks in the identified districts may sensitise and motivate the staff posted to\nidentified districts through proper training to assist the minority communities under\nvarious credit schemes.\n6.4 The Lead Banks may organise sensitization workshops for bank officials regarding\nmicro credit /  lending to SHGs with the help of DDMs of NABARD.\n7.Publicity\n7.1 There should be good  publicity about various anti-poverty  programmes of the\nGovernment where there is large concentration of minority communities and\nparticularly in the districts listed in the Annexure II  which have a concentration of\nminority communities.\n7.2 The Lead Banks in the identified districts may create awareness among minority\ncommunities regarding credit facilities available from banks through appropriate\nmeasures which may include publicity through ( i) print media i.e. distribution of\npamphlets in local languages, advertisements/articles in newspapers etc.  (ii )  TV\nchannels  - DD/local channels, (iii) participation / setting up of stalls in the Melas / fairs\norganized during the religious /festive occasions by these communities.\n8.National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation ( NMDFC)\n8.1 National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation ( NMDFC) was established\nin September 1994 to promote economic and developmental activities for the backward\nsections amongst the minorities.  NMDFC works as an apex body and channelises its\nfunds to the beneficiaries through the State Minority Finance Corporation of the\nrespective State/Union Territory Governments.\n8.2 The NMDFC is  operating,  inter- alia, the Margin Money Scheme.  Bank finance under\nthe scheme will be upto 60 percent of the project cost. The remaining amount of the\nproject cost is shared by NMDFC , the State channelising  agency and the beneficiary in\nthe proportion of 25%, 10%, and 5%, respectively.   Banks may implement the Margin\nMoney scheme evolved by NMDFC. While extending bank finance, banks should bear\nin mind the guidelines/instructions issued by RBI from time to time on priority sector\nadvances.  It may be ensured that the assets created out of the loan amount are\nmortgaged/hypothecated to the banks. Where recoveries have been made by the banks,\nit would be in order if the amounts are appropriated first towards bank dues.ANNEXURE    1\nStatement showing Priority Sector Advances granted to the Members of the specified\nMinority Communities vis-\u00e0-vis Overall Priority Sector Advances for the Half-year ended\n(Vide paragraph  5.1)\n(No. of Accounts - Actuals)\n(Amount in lakhs of Rupees)\nBank Name ____________________________________________________ Bank Code __________\nPart 'A' - For  Identified Districts\nChristians\n(10)Muslims\n(20)Buddhists\n(30)Sikhs\n(40)Zoroastrians\n(50)Total 'A'Others   'B'\n(90)Total P/S\nAdvances in\nIdentified\nDistricts 'C'\n(99)No.\nDistrictCode\nNo.\nNo. of\nA/cs.Amt.\nO/S.No. of\nA/cs.Amt.\nO/S.No. of\nA/cs.Amt.\nO/S.No. of\nA/cs.Amt.\nO/S.No. of\nA/cs.Amt.\nO/S.No. of\nA/cs.Amt.\nO/S.No. of\nA/cs.Amt.\nO/S.No. of\nA/cs.Amt.\nO/S.\nUttar Pradesh\n1.Rampur 280\n2.Bijnor 276\n3.Moradabad 278\n4.Saharanpur 274\n5.Muzaffarnagar 272\n6.Meerut 270\n7.Bahraich 244\n8.Gonda 243\n9.Gaziabad 269\n10.

Procedure for sale of banks\u2019/ FIs\u2019 financial assets  to\n    SC/ RC, including valuation and pricing aspects2\n(a) The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of\nSecurity Interest Act, 2002 (SRFAESI Act) allows acquisition of financial assets by SC/RC\nfrom any bank/ FI on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between them. This\nprovides for sale of the financial assets on \u2018without recourse\u2019 basis, i.e., with the entire credit\nrisk associated with the financial assets being transferred to SC/ RC, as well as on \u2018with\nrecourse\u2019 basis, i.e., subject to unrealized part of the asset reverting to the seller bank/ FI.\nBanks/ FIs are, however, directed to ensure that the effect of the sale of the financial assets\nshould be such that the asset is taken off the books of the bank/ FI and after the sale there\nshould not be any known liability devolving on the banks/ FIs.\n(b) Banks/ FIs, which propose to sell to SC/RC their financial assets should ensure that\nthe sale is conducted in a prudent manner in accordance with a policy approved by the Board.\nThe Board shall lay down policies and guidelines covering, inter alia,\n(i) Financial assets to be sold;\n(ii) Norms and procedure for sale of such financial assets;\n(iii) Valuation procedure to be followed to ensure that the realisable value of\nfinancial assets is reasonably estimated;\n(iv) Delegation of powers of various functionaries for taking decision on the sale of\nthe financial assets ; etc.\n(c) Banks/ FIs should ensure that subsequent to sale of the financial assets to SC/RC, they\ndo not assume any operational, legal or any other type of risks relating to the financial assets\nsold.\n(d) (i) Each b ank / FI will make its own assessment of the value offered by the SC /\nRC for the financial asset and decide whether to accept or reject the offer.\n(ii) In the case of consortium / multiple banking arrangements, if 75% (by value)\nof the banks / FIs decide to accept the offer, the remaining banks / FIs will be\nobligated to accept the offer.\n (iii) Under no circumstances can a transfer to the SC/ RC be made at a contingent\nprice whereby in the event of shortfall in the realization by the SC/ RC, the banks/ FIs\nwould have to bear a part of the shortfall.\n(e) Banks/ FIs may receive cash or bonds or debentures as sale consideration for the\nfinancial assets sold to SC/RC.\n(f) Bonds/ debentures received by banks/ FIs as sale consideration towards sale of\nfinancial assets to SC/RC will be classified as investments in the books of banks/ FIs.3\n(g) Banks may also invest in security receipts, Pass-through certificates (PTC), or other\nbonds/ debentures issued by SC/RC. These securities will also be classified as investments in\nthe books of banks/ FIs.\n(h) In cases of specific financial assets, where it is considered necessary, banks/ FIs may\nenter into agreement with SC/RC to share, in an agreed proportion, any surplus realised by\nSC/RC on the eventual realisation of the concerned asset. In such cases the terms of sale\nshould provide for a report from the SC/RC to the bank/ FI on the value realised from the\nasset.  No credit for the expected profit will be taken by banks/ FIs until the profit\nmaterializes on actual sale.\n5. Prudential norms for banks/ FIs for the sale transactions\n(A) Provisioning/ valuation norms\n(a) (i) When a bank / FI sells its financial assets to SC/ RC, on transfer the same will be\nremoved from its books.\n(ii) If the sale to SC/ RC is at a price below the net book value (NBV) (i.e., book value less\nprovisions held), the shortfall should be debited to the profit and loss account of that year.\n(iii) If the sale is for a value higher than the NBV, the excess provision will not be reversed\nbut will be utilized to meet the shortfall/ loss on account of sale of other financial assets to\nSC/RC.\n(iv) When banks/ FIs invest in the security receipts/ pass-through certificates issued by\nSC/RC in respect of the financial assets sold by them to the SC/RC, the sale shall be\nrecognised in books of the banks / FIs at the lower of:\n?  the redemption value of the security receipts/ pass-through certificates, and\n? the NBV of the financial asset.\nThe above investment should be carried in the books of the bank / FI at the price as\ndetermined above until its sale or realization, and on such sale or realization, the loss or\ngain must be dealt with in the same manner as at (ii) and (iii) above.\n(b) The securities (bonds and debentures) offered by SC / RC should satisfy the following\nconditions:\n(i)The securities must not have a term in excess of six years.\n(ii)The securities must carry a rate of interest which is not lower than 1.5% above the\nBank Rate in force at the time of issue.4\n(iii)The securities must be secured by an appropriate charge on the assets transferred.\n(iv) The securities must provide for part or full prepayment in the event the SC / RC\nsells the asset securing the security before the maturity date of the security.\n(v).The commitment of the SC / RC to redeem the securities must be unconditional and\nnot linked to the realization of the assets.\n(vi) Whenever the security is transferred to any other party, notice of transfer should be\nissued to the SC/ RC.\n(c) Investment in debentures/ bonds/ security receipts/ Pass-through certificates\n     issued by SC/ RC\nAll instruments received by banks/ FIs from SC/RC as sale consideration for financial assets\nsold to them and also other instruments issued by SC/ RC in which banks/ FIs invest will be\nin the nature of non SLR securities. Accordingly, the valuation, classification and other\nnorms applicable to investment in non-SLR instruments prescribed by RBI from time to time\nwould be applicable to bank\u2019s/ FI\u2019s investment in debentures/ bonds/ security receipts/ PTCs\nissued by SC/ RC. However, if any of the above instruments issued by SC/RC is limited to\nthe actual realisation  of the financial assets assigned to the instruments in the concerned\nscheme the bank/ FI shall reckon the Net Asset Value (NAV), obtained from SC/RC from\ntime to time, for valuation of such investments.\n(B) Capital Adequacy\nFor the purpose of capital adequacy, banks/ FIs should assign risk weights as under to the\ninvestments in debentures/ bonds/ security receipts/ PTCs issued by SC/ RC and held by\nbanks/ FIs as investment:\ni) Risk weight for credit risk: 100%.\nii) Risk weight for market risk :  2.5 %\nApplicable risk weight = ( i) + (ii)\n(C) Exposure Norms\nBanks\u2019/ FIs\u2019 investments in debentures/ bonds/ security receipts/ PTCs issued by a SC/RC\nwill constitute exposure on the SC/RC. As only a few SC/RC are being set up now, banks\u2019/\nFIs\u2019 exposure on SC/RC through their investments in debentures/ bonds/security\nreceipts/ PTCs issued by the SC/ RC may go beyond their prudential exposure ceiling. In view5\nof the extra ordinary nature of event, banks/ FIs will be allowed, in the initial years, to exceed\nprudential exposure ceiling on a case-to-case basis.\n6  Disclosure Requirements\nBanks/ FIs, which sell their financial assets to an SC/ RC, shall be required to make the\nfollowing disclosures in the Notes on Accounts to their Balance sheets:\nDetails of financial assets sold during the year to SC/RC for Asset Reconstruction\na) No. of accounts\nb) Aggregate value (net of provisions) of accounts sold to SC / RC\nc) Aggregate consideration\nd) Additional consideration realized in respect of accounts transferred in earlier years\ne) Aggregate gain / loss over net book value.\n7 Related Issues\n(a) SC/ RC will also take over financial assets which cannot be revived and which, therefore,\nwill have to be disposed of on a realisation basis. Normally the SC/ RC will not take over\nthese assets but act as an agent for recovery for which it will charge a fee.\n(b) Where the assets fall in the above category, the assets will not be removed from the books\nof the bank/ FI but realisations as and when received will be credited to the asset account.\nProvisioning for the asset will continue to be made by the bank / FI in the normal course.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/35919.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 23, 2003", "info": "Guidelines on sale of financial assets to Securitisation Company\n(SC)/ Reconstruction Company (RC) (created under the\nSecuritisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and\nEnforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002) and related issues\nDBOD No.BP.BC . 96/ 21.04.048/ 2002-03\nApril 23, 2003\nAll scheduled commercial banks and\nAll India Financial Institutions\n(excluding RRBs & LABs)\nDear Sir,\nGuidelines on sale of financial assets to Securitisation Company\n(SC)/ Reconstruction Company (RC) (created under the\nSecuritisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and\nEnforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002) and related issues\nAs you are aware, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement\nof Security Interest Act, 2002, provides, among others, sale of financial assets by banks/ FIs to\nSecuritisation Company/ Reconstruction Company.

Similarly, financial assets having\nlinkages to the same collateral may be considered for acquisition to ensure relatively\nfaster and easy realisation. However, in these cases, a balanced approach, taking into the\naccount the risk in such acquisitions, may be adopted while deciding on the assets for\nacquisition;\n(iv) Both fund and non-fund based financial assets may be included in the list of assets for\nacquisition. Standard Assets in the books of originator likely to face distress\nprospectively may also be acquired;\n(v) Acquisition of funded assets should not include takeover of outstanding commitments, if\nany, of any bank/FI to lend further. Terms of acquisition of security interest in non-fund\ntransactions, should provide for the relative commitments to continue with bank/FI, till\ndemand for funding arises;\n(vi) Loans not backed by proper documentation should be avoided;\n(vii) As far as possible, the valuation process should be uniform for assets of same profile and\nshould ensure that the valuation of the financial assets is done in scientific and objective\nmanner.  Valuation may be done internally or by engaging an independent agency,\ndepending upon the value of the assets.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of\nGovernment securities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d\nbasis in select  auctions of dated Government of India securities. Accordingly,\nnon-competitive bids up to 5 percent  of the notified amount will be accepted in\nthe auctions of dated securities. The reserved amount will be within the notified\namount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of\ndated GOI securities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL)\naccount with the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs), Urban Cooperative Banks ( UCBs)\nand Non-banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs) shall be covered under this\nScheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single  bid for an amount not more than Rs.one crore (face value) per\nauction\na. submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this\nscheme.\nExceptions: Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs), Urban Cooperative Banks\n(UCBs) and Non-banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs) shall be eligible\nto submit their non competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate\nbodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be\nprescribed by RBI. The minimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face\nvalue) and thereafter in multiples in Rs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent\nsubsidiary general ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they\nwish to participate. However, an investor can make only a single bid under this\nscheme. An undertaking to the effect that the investor is making only a single bid\nwill have to be obtained and kept on record by the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid\nfor the aggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers\nviz. name, amount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at\nthe weighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basisof the competitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against\npayment on the date of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received\npayment from their clients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5%\nof notified amount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments,\nit will be the responsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to\ntheir clients in a transparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount,\nthe shortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit\neither the main SGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated\nby them. The facility for affording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole\npurpose of servicing investors who are not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or\nPD would have to indicate clearly at the time of tendering the non-competitive bids\nthe amounts ( face value ) to be credited to their SGL account and the CSGL account.\nDelivery in physical form from the main SGL account is permissible at the instance\nof the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities\nto their clients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to\nthe clients shall be completed within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients.\nSuch costs may be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients.\nIn case the transfer of securities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the\nsecurity, the consideration amount payable by the client to the bank or PD would\nalso include accrued interest from the date of issue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the\nsecurities, accrued interest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service\ncharges may be worked out by the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It\nmay be noted that no other costs such as funding costs should be built into the price\nor recovered from the client.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to\noperations under the Scheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for\nfrom time to time within the time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and\naccordingly, if and when considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/35692.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 17, 2003", "info": "Auction of Government of India Dated Securities\nRef.No.IDMC. 4144 /08.02.30.01/2002-03\nApril 17, 2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks excluding RRBs/\nAll State Co-operative Banks/All Scheduled Primary\n(Urban) Co-operative Banks /All Financial Institutions/\nAll Primary Dealers\nDear Sirs,\nAuction of Government of India Dated Securities\nGovernment of India have offered to sale (re-issue) of \u201c6.25 percent Government Stock\n2018\u201d for a notified amount of Rs.5 ,000 crore (nominal) through a price based auction\nusing multiple price auction method vide Notifications No. 4(8)-W&M/2003 dated April\n17, 2003.

Capital\nCapital refers to Tier I capital as per instructions issued by Reserve Bank of India (Department of\nBanking Operations and Development).\n3. Calculation of the Net Open Position in a Single Currency10\nThe open position must first be measured separately for each foreign currency. The open position\nin a currency is the sum of (a) the net spot position, (b) the net forward position and (c) the net\noptions position.\na) Net Spot Position\nThe net spot position is the difference between foreign currency assets and the liabilities in the\nbalance sheet. This should include all accrued income/expenses.\nb) Net Forward Position\nThis represents the net of all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid in the future as a\nresult of foreign exchange transactions which have been concluded. These transactions, which\nare recorded as off-balance sheet items in the bank's books, would include:\n( i ) spot transactions which are not yet settled;\n( ii ) forward transactions;\n( iii)guarantees and similar commitments denominated in foreign currencies which are certain to\nbe called;\n( iv )net of amounts to be received/paid in respect of currency futures, and the principal on\ncurrency futures/swaps.\nc) Options Position\nThe options position is the \"delta-equivalent\" spot currency position as reflected in the\nauthorised dealer's options risk management system, and includes any delta hedges in place\nwhich have not already been included under 3(a) or 3(b) ( i) and (ii).\n4. Calculation of the Overall Net Open Position\nThis involves measurement of risks inherent in a bank's mix of long and short position in\ndifferent currencies. It has been decided to adopt the \"shorthand method\" which is accepted\ninternationally for arriving at the overall net open position. Banks may, therefore, calculate the\noverall net open position as follows:\n(i)  Calculate the net open position in each currency (paragraph 3 above).\n(ii)  Calculate the net open position in gold.\n(iii) Convert the net position in various currencies and gold into rupees  in terms of existing RBI\n/ FEDAI Guidelines.\n(iv)  Arrive at the sum of all the net short positions..\n(v)   Arrive at the sum of all the net long positions.\nOverall net foreign exchange position is the higher of (iv) or (v). The overall net foreign\nexchange position arrived at as above must be kept within the limit approved by Reserve Bank.\n5.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of\nGovernment securities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d\nbasis in select  auctions of dated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-\ncompetitive bids up to 5 percent  of the notified amount will be accepted in the\nauctions of dated securities. The reserved amount will be within the notified\namount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of\ndated GOI securities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL)\naccount with the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs), Urban Cooperative Banks ( UCBs)\nand Non-banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs) shall be covered under this\nScheme in view of their statutory obligations.\n2. make a single  bid for an amount not more than Rs.one crore (face value) per\nauction\na. submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this\nscheme.\nExceptions: Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs), Urban Cooperative Banks\n(UCBs) and Non-banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs) shall be eligible\nto submit their non competitive bids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate\nbodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be\nprescribed by RBI. The minimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value)\nand thereafter in multiples in Rs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\n        IV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent subsidiary\ngeneral ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish to\nparticipate. However, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An\nundertaking to the effect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be\nobtained and kept on record by the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name,\namount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on the\ndate of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from their\nclients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of\nnotified amount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be\nthe responsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a\ntransparent manner.\n5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the\nshortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL form by RBI. RBI would credit either the\nmain SGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The\nfacility for affording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing\ninvestors who are not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate\nclearly at the time of tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be\ncredited to their SGL account and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the\nmain SGL account is permissible at the instance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to their\nclients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients shall\nbe completed within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such costs\nmay be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case the transfer\nof securities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the consideration\namount payable by the client to the bank or PD would also include accrued interest from\nthe date of issue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities,\naccrued interest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be\nworked out by the bank or PD as per agreement with the client. It may be noted that no\nother costs such as funding costs should be built into the price or recovered from the client.\nV. Banks and PDs will be required to furnish information relating to\noperations under the Scheme to the Reserve Bank of India (Bank) as may be called for\nfrom time to time within the time frame prescribed by the Bank.\nVI. The aforesaid guidelines are subject to review by the Bank and accordingly,\nif and when considered necessary, the Scheme will be modified.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/35477.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 04, 2003", "info": "Auction for Sale of Government Stock of 20 Years\nGovernment of India\nMinistry of Finance\n(Department of Economic Affairs)\n(Budget Division)\nNew Delhi, the April 4, 2003\nNOTIFICATION\nAuction for Sale of Government Stock of 20 Years\nF.

It was\nalso informed that the Bank would take a final view on the suggestion of a separate format of\nfinancial statements for NBFCs after consulting all concerned in the matter.\n(ii)   Keeping in view the comments received and  other developments in the financial system\nviz. amendments to the Companies Act, 1956, issue of  new accounting standards by Institute of\nChartered Accountants of India, etc. the Bank has now decided that effective from the balance\nsheet as on March 31, 2003 and onwards all NBFCs (irrespective of whether they hold public\ndeposits or not) shall attach a schedule to the balance sheet containing additional particulars as\nper format prescribed by the Bank.

The limit of\n2 per cent is not applicable to the investments in the UTI schemes.\n(ii) Subsequent to the bifurcation of the Unit Trust of India, the mutual fund activities of UTI\nwould be governed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations,\n1996 like any other mutual fund. As such, it has been decided to do away with the special\ntreatment to investments in UTI in the matter of investment of the aggregate liabilities to the\ndepositors. The permission to the RNBCs to invest in the mutual funds including the UTI would,\nhowever, continue within the ceiling of 10 per cent of the aggregate liabilities subject to the sub-\nceiling of 2 per cent of such liabilities for any one mutual fund. The above changes would be\napplicable to deposits received on and from April 1, 2003 meaning thereby that the investments\nmade by the RNBCs  as on March 31, 2003 in the UTI schemes would continue, as hitherto, to be\npart of securities under Paragraph 6 of the RNBC  Directions, till their divestment.

BC. 89 /21.04.018/2002-03\nMarch 29, 2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(excluding RRBs and LABs)\nDear Sir,\nGuidelines on compliance with Accounting Standards (AS) by banks\nThe Reserve Bank of India has been continuously making efforts to ensure convergence of\nits supervisory norms and practices with the international best practices with a view to\naligning standards adopted by the Indian banking system with global standards. In this\ndirection, the Governor had announced in the Mid-Term Review of Monetary and Credit\nPolicy for the year 2001- 02, that it was necessary to put in place appropriate arrangements\nto identify compliance by banks, as also gaps in compliance, with the Accounting\nStandards (AS) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ( ICAI) and\nrecommend steps to eliminate / reduce gaps. Accordingly, a Working Group was\nconstituted under the Chairmanship of Shri N.D. Gupta, Former President of ICAI to\nrecommend steps to eliminate / reduce gaps in compliance by banks with the Accounting\nStandards issued by ICAI. The Working Group had examined compliance by banks with\nthe Accounting Standards 1 to 22 which were already in force for the accounting period\ncommencing from April 1, 2001, as also Accounting Standards 23 to 28 which were to\ncome into force for subsequent periods.\n2. The Working Group has, in its report, observed that out of Accounting Standards\nwhich are already in force, viz. Accounting Standards 1 to 22, banks in India are generally\ncomplying with most of the Accounting Standards except for the following eight, leading\nto qualification in the financial statements.\nAccounting\nStandardPertaining to\n5 Net Profit or Loss for the period, prior period items and changes in\naccounting policies\n9 Revenue recognition\n11 Accounting for the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates\n15 Accounting for retirement benefits in the financial statements of employers2\n17 Segment reporting\n18 Related party disclosures\n21 Consolidated financial statements\n22 Accounting for taxes on income\nThe Statutory Central Auditors report on banks\u2019 non-compliance with some of the\nAccounting Standards in the Auditors\u2019 Reports attached to the balance sheets and the\nqualifications could affect the confidence of the users of the financial statements, viz.,\ncounter party banks, host country regulators of foreign branches of Indian banks, national\nand international rating agencies etc., in the integrity of the published results.\n3. With a view to eliminating gaps in compliance with the Accounting Standards, the\nWorking Group has made recommendations on the concerned Accounting Standards and\ndetailed guidelines based thereon are furnished for the guidance of banks in the Annexure .\nThe Working Group has not made recommendation on Accounting Standard 11\n(Accounting for effects of changes in foreign exchange rates) since ICAI is in the process\nof revising Accounting Standard 11. Guidelines on Accounting Standard 21 (Consolidated\nfinancial statements) have been issued separately vide our circular\nDBOD.No.BP.BC.72/21.04.018/2002-03 dated February 25, 2003.\n4. ICAI  which was represented on the Working Group has also agreed to furnish\nappropriate clarification on the Accounting Standards in question on the lines of the\nrecommendations of the Group for the guidance of its members. RBI considers that with\nthe issue of the guidelines as above and adoption of the prescribed procedures, there\nshould normally be no need for any Statutory Auditor for qualifying balance sheet of the\nbank being audited for non-compliance with Accounting Standards. Hence, it is essential\nthat both banks and the Statutory Central Auditors adopt the guidelines and procedures\nprescribed. Whenever specific difference in opinion arises among the auditors, the\nStatutory Central Auditors would take a final view. Persisting difference, if any, could be\nsorted out in prior consultation with RBI, if necessary.\n5.   Banks are advised to place these guidelines before the Board of Directors.  Banks are\nfurther advised to ensure strict compliance with the standards with effect from the\naccounting year ending March 31, 2003.3\n6. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(C.R. Muralidharan )\nChief General Manager\nEncls  : as above4\nAnnexure\nGuidelines on compliance with Accounting\nStandards by banks\nOn the basis of the recommendations of the Working Group on Compliance with\nAccounting Standards by banks, which was constituted by the Reserve Bank of India with\nShri N. D. Gupta , the then President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, as\nChairman, the following guidelines are issued to banks by RBI with a view to eliminating\nthe gaps in compliance by banks with the Accounting Standard issued by ICAI .\n2. These guidelines pertains to the following Accounting Standards (AS) which are already\noperational:\nAS 5, AS 9, AS 15, AS 17, AS 18, AS 22, AS 23, AS 25, and AS 27.\n3. Banks should place these guidelines before the Board of Directors and ensure strict\ncompliance with effect from the accounting year ending March 31, 2003.\n4. Accounting Standard 5 \u2013 Net Profit or Loss for the period, prior period items\nand changes in Accounting policies.\n4.1 Gist of the Accounting Standard\nThe objective of this Standard is to prescribe the classification and disclosure of certain\nitems in the statement of profit and loss so that all enterprises prepare and present such a\nstatement on a uniform basis. Accordingly, this Standard requires the classification and\ndisclosure of extraordinary and prior period items, and the disclosure of certain items\nwithin profit or loss from ordinary activities. It also specifies the accounting treatment for\nchanges in accounting estimates and the disclosures to be made in the financial statements\nregarding changes in accounting policies. This Standard deals with, among other matters,\nthe disclosure of certain items of net profit or loss for the period. These disclosures are\nmade in addition to any other disclosures required by other Accounting Standards.\n4.2 Reasons for qualification\n4.2.1 Qualification in respect of Accounting Standard 5 should normally arise due to error\nor omission on the part of banks in accounting for income/ expenditure in the previous\nyears, which are rectified during the current year and due to non-disclosure of such prior\nperiod items separately in the P& L account for the current year.5\n4.2.2 Qualifications arise mainly due to change in accounting estimates and not due to\nerror or omission by the banks. The banks do not disclose the details of such items\nseparately in the relevant year\u2019s profit & loss account since the format of the profit & loss\naccount for banks is prescribed under Form B of the Third Schedule to the Banking\nRegulation Act, 1949, which does not provide any matching head of item for making such\ndisclosures.\n4.3  Action to be taken by banks / Auditors.\n4.3.1 Paragraph 4.3 of Preface to the Statements on Accounting Standards states that\nAccounting Standards are intended to apply only to items which are material. Since\nmateriality is not objectively defined, it has been decided that all banks should ensure\ncompliance with the provisions of the Accounting Standard in respect of any item  of prior\nperiod income or prior period expenditure which exceeds one percent of the total income/\ntotal expenditure of the bank if the income/ expenditure is reckoned on a gross basis or one\npercent of the net profit before taxes or net losses as the case may be if the income is\nreckoned net of costs.\n4.3.2  Since the format of the profit and loss accounts of banks prescribed in Form B under\nThird Schedule to the Banking Regulation Act 1949 does not specifically provide for\ndisclosure of the impact of prior period items on the current year\u2019s profit and loss, such\ndisclosures, wherever warranted, may be made in the Notes on Accounts to the balance\nsheet of banks.\n5. Accounting Standard 9 \u2013 Revenue Recognition\n5.1  Gist of the Accounting Standard\nThis Standard  deals with the bases for recognition of revenue in the statement of profit and\nloss of an enterprise. The Standard  is concerned with the recognition of revenue arising in\nthe course of the ordinary activities of the enterprise from the sale of goods, the rendering\nof services, and the use by others of enterprise resources yielding interest, royalties and\ndividends. This Standard  requires that revenue from sales or service transactions should be\nrecognised when the requirements as to performance set out in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the\nStandard  are satisfied, provided that at the time of performance it is not unreasonable to\nexpect ultimate collection. If at the time of raising of any claim it is unreasonable to expect\nultimate collection, revenue recognition should be postponed. This Standard  requires that6\nrevenue arising from the use by others of enterprise resources yielding interest , royalties\nand dividends should only be recognised when no significant uncertainty as to\nmeasurability or collectability exists. The Standard  also prescribes the bases for\nrecognition of these revenues. This Standard  requires that in addition to the disclosures\nrequired by Accounting Standard 1 on \u2018Disclosure of Accounting Policies\u2019 (AS 1), an\nenterprise should also disclose the circumstances in which revenue recognition has been\npostponed pending the resolution of significant uncertainties.\n5.2. Reasons for qualification\nAuditors of a few banks had qualified the accounts for non-compliance with this\nAccounting Standard because the banks had not followed the accrual basis of recognising\nincome in respect of certain items of income which, wherever necessary, are required to be\nsplit over two or more accounting periods due to the nature of the transaction.\n5.3.  Action to be taken by banks / Auditors\n5.3.1 Paragraph 4.3 of Preface to the Statements on Accounting Standards states that\nAccounting Standards are intended to apply only to items which are material. Since\nmateriality is not objectively defined, it has been decided that an item of income may not\nbe considered to be material if it does not exceed one percent of the total income of the\nbank if the income is reckoned on a gross basis or one percent of the net profit (before\ntaxes) if the income is reckoned net of costs. If any item of income is not considered to be\nmaterial as per the above norms, it may be recognised when received.\n5.3.2 Non-recognition of income by the banks in case of non-performing advances and\nnon-performing investments, in compliance with the regulatory prescriptions of the RBI,\nshould not attract a qualification by the statutory auditors as this would be in conformity\nwith provisions of the standard, since it recognises  postponement of recognition of revenue\nwhere collectibility  of the revenue is significantly uncertain.\n6. Accounting sta ndard 15 \u2013 Accounting for Retirement Benefits in the Financial\nStatements of Employers.\n6.1 Gist of the Accounting Standard7\nThis Standard deals with accounting for retirement benefits in the financial statements of\nemployers. This Standard applies to retirement benefits in the form of provident fund,\nsuperannuation/pension and gratuity provided by an employer to employees, whether in\npursuance of requirements of any law or otherwise. It also applies to retirement benefits in\nthe form of leave encashment  benefit, health and welfare schemes and other retirement\nbenefits, if the predominant characteristics of these benefits are the same as those of\nprovident fund, superannuation /pension or gratuity benefit, i.e. if such a retirement benefit\nis in the nature of either a defined contribution scheme or a defined benefit scheme as\ndescribed in this Standard. This Standard does not apply to those retirement benefits for\nwhich the employer\u2019s obligation cannot be reasonably estimated, e.g., ad hoc ex- gratia\npayments made to employees on retirement. As per the Standard, the cost of retirement\nbenefits to an employer results from receiving services from the employees who are\nentitled to receive such benefits. Consequently, the cost of retirement benefits is accounted\nfor in the period during which these services are rendered. Accounting for retirement\nbenefit cost only when employees retire or receive benefit payments (i.e., as per pay-as-\nyou-go method) does not achieve the objective of allocation of those costs to the periods in\nwhich the services were rendered. The Standard requires that in respect of retirement\nbenefits in the form of provident fund and other defined contribution schemes, the\ncontribution payable by the employer for a year should be charged to the statement of\nprofit and loss for the year. In respect of gratuity benefit and other defined benefit\nschemes, the Standard lays down that the accounting treatment will depend on the basis of\ntype of arrangement, which the employer has chosen to make.\n6.2 Reasons for qualification\nThe financial statements of a few banks have attracted qualification by the auditors for not\ncomplying with this Accounting Standard because the banks had not provided for the\nliability arising out of leave encashment on retirement. These banks were adopting the\n\u2018pay as you go\u2019 method whereby the cost of the retirement benefit is recognised only at the\ntime of retirement when payments are made to the employees instead of accounting for the\nliability on an actuarial basis.\n6.3  Action to be taken by banks / Auditors.8\n6.3.1 Banks are required to account for the liability arising out of leave encashment on\nretirement on an accrual basis. As the Standard does not provide for any transition period\nto enterprises that are yet to achieve full compliance it would be unavoidable for the\nstatutory auditors to make a qualification until the Accounting Standard has been fully\ncomplied with. With a view to ensuring that the qualification by the auditor does not arise\nbanks, which are yet to fully comply with the Standard, are required to provide for the\naccrued liability for leave encashment  on retirement as on 31st March 2003 by charging the\nsame to their profit and loss account for the year ending on that date. However,\nconsidering the financial implication of accounting for the past requirements in the current\nyear\u2019s income, banks have the option to charge the liability for leave encashment on\nretirement accrued up to 31st March 2002 to the revenue reserves.   Banks may disclose the\nchange in accounting policy in the appropriate schedule relating to \u2018Significant changes in\nAccounting Policies\u2019 / \u2018Principal Accounting Policies\u2019.\n7. Accounting Standard 17 \u2013 Segment Reporting\n7.1 Gist of the Accounting Standard\nThe Standard establishes principles for reporting financial information, about the different\ntypes of products and services an enterprise produces and the different geographical areas\nin which it operates. As per the Standard, for reporting the financial information, business\nand geographical segments are required to be identified. It provides that one basis of\nsegmentation is primary and the other is secondary, with considerably less information\nrequired to be disclosed for secondary segments. It contains requirements for identifying\nreportable segments and lays down disclosures required for reportable segments for\nprimary segment reporting format of an enterprise as well as the disclosures required for\nsecondary reporting format of the enterprise. It also addresses several other segment\ndisclosure matters.\n7.2 Reasons for qualification\nBanks were not able to adopt the Accounting Standard due to lack of clarity for identifying\nthe business segments and geographical segments as also the absence of uniform\ndisclosure formats as relevant to banks.9\n7.3 Action to be taken by banks / Auditors\n7.3.1 In view of very large branch network and the existing level of MIS and\ncomputerisation  of public sector banks and the difficulties on account of collection and\ncompilation of details of segment-wise position of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and\nother information, as an interim measure, it has been decided to recommend a suitable\nsimplified disclosure format which all banks would be in a position to comply with as a\nfirst step towards compliance with Accounting Standard 17. However, this does not\ndispense with the need to provide more disclosures in future after developing an\nappropriate MIS for the purpose. Hence, banks should initiate measures to move towards\ngreater disclosures within a defined time period.\n7.3.2 In view of the above and with a view to adapt the disclosure format prescribed in\nAppendix III to the Accounting Standard to suit banks it has been decided that banks\nshould uniformly adopt the disclosure format furnished in Attachment 1 of these\nguidelines. This format indicates the minimum disclosure requirements under this\nAccounting Standards and banks are allowed the discretion to enhance the disclosure\nlevels.\n7.3.3  Banks are advised to adopt the following while complying with the Accounting\nStandard.\n\u2022 The business segment should ordinarily be considered as the primary reporting\nformat and geographical segment would be the secondary reporting format.\n\u2022 The business segments will be \u2018Treasury\u2019, \u2018Other banking operations\u2019 and\n\u2018Residual operations\u2019.\n\u2022 \u2018Domestic\u2019 and \u2018International\u2019 segments will be the geographic segments for\ndisclosure.\n\u2022 Banks may adopt their own methods, on a reasonable and  consistent basis, for\nallocation of expenditure among the segments.\n8. Accounting Standard 18 \u2013 Related Party disclosures\n8.1 Gist of the Accounting Standard10\nThis Standard  is applied in reporting related party relationships and transactions between a\nreporting enterprise and its related parties. This Standard  requires that name of the related\nparty and nature of the related party relationship where control exists should be disclosed\nirrespective of whether or not there have been transactions between the related parties. The\nStandard  requires that where control does not exist, certain disclosures have to be made by\nthe reporting enterprise if there have been transactions between related parties, during the\nexistence of a related party relationship. As per the Statement, items of a similar nature\nmay be disclosed in aggregate by type of related party.\n8.2 Reasons for qualification\nMany banks had not complied with this Accounting Standard due to the following reasons\nand had, therefore, invited qualifications of their financial statements:\n\u2022 Compliance with the above Accounting Standard would infringe upon their\nobligation to maintain confidentiality of their customers\u2019 accounts.\n\u2022 Banks were not sure who were their related parties, including  key management\npersonnel.\n\u2022 Absence of a disclosure format relevant to banks.\n8.3  Action to be taken by banks / Auditors\n8.3.1 In view of the above banks are advised to adopt the following while ensuring\ncompliance with the Accounting Standards\n\u2022 Related Parties : To begin with, related parties for a bank are its parent,\nsubsidiary( ies), associates/ joint ventures, Key Management Personnel ( KMP)\nand relatives of KMP. KMP are the whole time directors for an Indian bank and\nthe chief executive officer for a foreign bank having branches in India.\nRelatives of KMP would be on the lines indicated in Section 45 S of the R.B.I.\nAct, 1934.\n\u2022 Disclosure format : The illustrative disclosure format recommended by the ICAI\nas a part of General Clarification (GC) 2/2002 has been suitably modified to\nsuit banks. The illustrative  format of disclosure by banks for the AS is\nfurnished in Attachment 2.11\n\u2022 Nature of disclosure : The name and nature of related party relationship should\nbe disclosed, irrespective of whether there have been transactions, where\ncontrol exists within the meaning of the Standard.  Control would normally\nexist in case of parent-subsidiary relationship. The disclosures may be limited\nto aggregate for each of the above related party categories and as indicated in\nAttachment 2, these would pertain to the year-end position as also the\nmaximum position during the year.\n\u2022 Position of nationalised banks : The Accounting Standards is applicable to all\nnationalised banks. Paragraph 9 of the Accounting Standards exempts state\ncontrolled enterprises i.e., nationalised banks from making any disclosures\npertaining to their transactions with other related parties which are  also state\ncontrolled enterprises. Thus nationalised banks need not disclose their\ntransactions with the subsidiaries as well as the RRBs sponsored by them.\nHowever, they will be required to disclose their transactions with other related\nparties.\n\u2022 Secrecy provisions : If in any of the above category of related parties there is\nonly one related party entity, any disclosure would tantamount to infringement\nof the bank secrecy clause. In terms of para 5 of Accounting Standards 18, the\ndisclosure requirements do not apply in circumstances when providing such\ndisclosures would conflict with the reporting enterprise\u2019s duties of\nconfidentiality as specifically required in terms of statute, by regulator or\nsimilar competent authority. In terms of Paragraph 6 of this Accounting\nStandard, in case a statute or regulator governing an enterprise prohibits the\nenterprise from disclosing certain information which is required to be disclosed,\nnon-disclosure of such information would not be deemed as non-compliance\nwith the Accounting Standards. It is clear from the above that on account of the\njudicially recognized common law duty of the banks to maintain the\nconfidentiality of the customer details, they need not make such disclosures. In\nview of the above, where the disclosures under the Accounting Standards are\nnot aggregated disclosures in respect of any category of related party i.e., where\nthere is only one entity in any category of related party, banks need not disclose12\nany details pertaining to that related party other than the relationship with that\nrelated party.\n\u2022 Since public sector banks have a large network of branches, these banks should\nimmediately devise an appropriate MIS to support the above disclosures.\n9.  Accounting Standard 22 \u2013 Accounting for Taxes on Income\n9.1 Gist of the Accounting Standard\nThis Standard is applied in accounting for taxes on income. This includes the\ndetermination of the amount of the expense or saving related to taxes on income in respect\nof an accounting period and the disclosure of such an amount in the financial statements.\nThe Standard requires that tax expense for the period, comprising current tax and deferred\ntax, should be included in the determination of the net profit or loss for the period. As per\nthe Standard, deferred tax should be recognised for all the timing differences, subject to\nthe consideration of prudence in respect of deferred tax assets as specified in the Standard.\nThe Standard requires that current tax should be measured at the amount expected to be\npaid to ( recovered from) the taxation authorities, using the applicable tax rates and tax\nlaws.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities should be measured using the tax rates and tax\nlaws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The\nStandard also prescribes requirements in respect of re-assessment of unrecognised deferred\ntax assets and review of deferred tax assets. The Standard also provides transitional\nprovisions to deal with the deferred tax balance that has accumulated prior to the adoption\nof the Standard.\n9.2 Reasons for qualifications\nBanks have expressed difficulties in complying with the Accounting Standard since\ncreation of Deferred Tax Liability ( DTL) or Deferred Tax Asset ( DTA) would put them in\na position by virtue of which they would be restrained due to certain statutory / regulatory\nrequirements.\n\u2022 Creation of a deferred tax liability (transition DTL) by debit to revenue reserves\nfor the accumulated effect as on 1st April 2001 would affect banks' Capital to\nRisk Weighted Assets Ratio ( CRAR) adversely unless such DTL is treated as\nTier 1 capital.13\n\u2022 DTA created in compliance with Accounting Standards 22 would be in the\nnature of an intangible asset. Hence creation of a deferred tax asset might affect\nbank's ability to declare dividends in view of the provisions of Section 15(1) of\nthe BR Act whereby banking companies are prohibited from paying dividend\non their shares until all their capitalised  expenses including preliminary\nexpenses, accumulated losses and any other expenditure not represented by\ntangible assets have been completely written off.\n9.3 Action to be taken by banks / Auditors\n9.3.1 Adoption of AS 22 may give rise to creation of either a deferred tax asset ( DTA ) or a\ndeferred tax liability ( DTL) in the books of accounts of banks and creation of DTA  or DTL\nwould give rise to certain issues which have a bearing on the computation of capital\nadequacy ratio and banks\u2019 ability to declare dividends. In this regard it is clarified as\nunder:\n\u2022 DTL created by debit to opening balance of Revenue Reserves on the first day\nof application of the Accounting Standards 22 or to Profit and Loss account for\nthe current year should be included under item (vi) \u2018others (including\nprovisions)\u2019 of Schedule 5 - \u2018Other Liabilities and Provisions\u2019 in the balance\nsheet. The balance in DTL account will not be eligible for inclusion in Tier I or\nTier II capital for capital adequacy purpose as it is not an eligible item of\ncapital.\n\u2022 DTA created by credit to opening balance of Revenue Reserves on the first day\nof application of Accounting Standards 22 or to Profit and Loss account for the\ncurrent year should be included under item (vi) \u2018others\u2019 of Schedule 11 \u2018Other\nAssets\u2019 in the balance sheet.\n\u2022 Creation of DTA results in an increase in Tier I capital of a bank without any\ntangible asset being added to the banks\u2019 balance sheet. Therefore, in terms of\nthe extant instructions on capital adequacy, DTA, which is an intangible asset,\nshould be deducted from Tier I Capital.\n10. Accounting Standard 23 \u2013 Accounting for Investments in Associates in\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n10.1 Gist of the Accounting Standard\nThis Accounting Standard sets out principles and procedures for recognising, in the\nconsolidated financial statements, the effects of the investments in associates on the\nfinancial position and operating results of a group. The Standard defines associate as an14\nenterprise in which the investor has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary\nnor a joint venture of the investor. The Standard requires that an investment in an associate\nshould be accounted for in consolidated financial statements under the equity method\nsubject to certain exceptions.  As per the Standard, the equity method is a method of\naccounting whereby the investment is initially recorded at cost, identifying any\ngoodwill/capital reserve arising at the time of acquisition.  The carrying amount of the\ninvestment is adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the investor\u2019s share of\nnet assets of the investee.  The consolidated statement of profit and loss reflects the\ninvestor\u2019s share of the results of operations of the investee.  The Standard lays down the\nrequirements in respect of the application of the equity method.\n10.2  Action to be taken by banks / Auditors\n10.2.1 This Accounting Standard has become effective for accounting periods\ncommencing on or after April1, 2002.\n10.2.2 It is observed that there could be certain doubts as to whether conversion of debt\ninto equity in an enterprise by a bank by virtue of which the bank holds more than 20%\nwill result in a investor-associate relationship for the purpose of Accounting Standards 23.\nThe term associate has been defined as an enterprise in which the investor has significant\ninfluence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the investor.  Significant\ninfluence is the power to participate in the financial and/ or operating policy decisions of\nthe investee but not control over those policies. Such an influence may be gained by share\nownership, statute or agreement.  As regards share ownership, if an investor holds, directly\nor indirectly through subsidiaries 20% or more of the voting power of the investee, it is\npresumed that the investor has significant influence, unless it can be clearly demonstrated\nthat this is not the case.  Conversely, if the investor holds, directly or indirectly through\nsubsidiaries less than 20% of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the\ninvestor does not have significant influence, unless such influence can be clearly\ndemonstrated.  A substantial or majority ownership by another investor does not\nnecessarily preclude an investor from having significant influence.\n10.2.3 From the above it is clear that though a bank may acquire more than 20% of voting\npower in the borrower entity in satisfaction of its advances it may be able to demonstrate\nthat it does not have the power to exercise significant influence since the rights exercised15\nby it are protective in nature and not participative .  In such a circumstance, such\ninvestment may not be treated as investment in associate under this Accounting Standard.\nHence the test should not be merely the proportion of investment but the intention to\nacquire the power to exercise significant influence.\n11. Accounting Standard 25 \u2013 Interim Financial Reporting\n11.1 Gist of Accounting Standard\nThis Standard  prescribes the minimum content of an interim financial report and the\nprinciples for recognition and measurement in a complete or condensed financial\nstatements for an interim period. As per the Standard, a statute governing an enterprise or a\nregulator may require an enterprise to prepare and present certain information at an interim\ndate which may be different in form and/or content as required by this Standard. In such a\ncase, the recognition and measurement principles as laid down in this Standard  are applied\nin respect of such information, unless otherwise specified in the statute or by the regulator.\nThe Standard  defines interim financial report as a financial report containing either a\ncomplete set of financial statements or a set of condensed financial statements (as\ndescribed in this Standard) for an interim period. As per the Standard, an interim financial\nreport should include, at a minimum, condensed balance sheet; condensed statement of\nprofit and loss; condensed cash flow statement; and selected explanatory notes. In respect\nof recognition and measurement, the Standard  requires that an enterprise should apply the\nsame accounting policies in its interim financial statements as are applied in its annual\nfinancial statements, except for accounting policy changes made after the date of the most\nrecent annual financial statements that are to be reflected in the next annual financial\nstatements. However, the frequency of an enterprise's reporting (annual, half-yearly, or\nquarterly) should not affect the measurement of its annual results. To achieve that\nobjective, measurements for interim reporting purposes should be made on a year-to-date\nbasis.\n11.2 Action to be taken by banks /  Auditors\n11.2.1 This Accounting Standard is effective from the accounting periods commencing on\nor after 1st April 2002.  Where an enterprise is required to or elects to prepare and present\nan interim financial report comprising either a complete set of financial statements or a set16\nof condensed financial statements for an interim period, it should comply with this\nStandard.   \n11.2.2 The disclosures required to be made by listed banks in terms of the listing\nagreements would not tantamount to interim reporting as envisaged under the Accounting\nStandard. Hence, the Accounting Standard is not mandatory for the quarterly reporting\nprescribed for listed banks.  However, the recognition and measurement principles laid\ndown in this Standard would have to be complied with in respect of such quarterly reports.\n11.2.3 Appendix 3 to the Standard clarifies that it is not necessary to do a fresh actuarial\nvaluation for each interim period and instead the proportionate estimate of the liability\nbased on the actuarial valuation done at the end of the previous financial year may be used,\nadjusted for significant market fluctuations since that time and for significant curtailments,\nsettlements or other significant one-time events.\n11.2.4 The half yearly review prescribed by RBI for public sector banks, in consultation\nwith SEBI, vide circular DBS. ARS . No. BC 13/ 08.91.001/ 2000-01 dated 17th May 2001\nis extended to all banks (both listed and unlisted) with a view to ensure uniformity in\ndisclosures. Banks may adopt the format prescribed by the RBI for the purpose.\n12 AS 27 - Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures\n12.1 Gist of the Accounting Standard\nThis Standard is applied in accounting for interests in joint ventures and the reporting of\njoint venture assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the financial statements of\nventurers and investors, regardless of the structures or forms under which the joint venture\nactivities take place. This Standard identifies three broad types of joint ventures, namely,\njointly controlled operations, jointly controlled assets and jointly controlled entities. This\nStandard requires, inter alia, that in its consolidated financial statements, a venturer should\nreport its interest in a jointly controlled entity using proportionate consolidation subject to\ncertain exceptions. The Standard defines proportionate consolidation as a method of\naccounting and reporting whereby a venturer's share of each of the assets, liabilities,\nincome and expenses of a jointly controlled entity is reported as separate line items in the\nventurer's financial statements.\n12.2 Action to be taken by banks / Auditors17\n12.2.1 This Standard, which is effective from 1st April 2002, sets out the principles and\nprocedures for accounting for interests in joint ventures and reporting of joint venture\nassets, liabilities, income and expenses in the financial statements of the ventures and the\ninvestors. In respect of separate financial statements of an enterprise, this standard is\nmandatory in nature from the above date. In respect of consolidated financial statements of\nan enterprise, this standard is mandatory in nature where the enterprise prepares and\npresents the consolidated financial statements in respect of accounting periods\ncommencing on or after 1st April 2002.\n12.2.2 It is clarified that though paragraph 27 of the Accounting Standard prescribes that\nfor the purpose of solo financial statements, investment in jointly controlled entities is to\nbe accounted as per Accounting Standard 13, such investment is to be reflected in the solo\nfinancial statements of banks as per guidelines prescribed by RBI since Accounting\nStandard 13 does not apply to banks.\n12.2.3 In view of the above, this Accounting Standard applies in case of jointly controlled\nentities only where banks are required to present consolidated financial statements,\nwhereby the investment in JVs should be accounted for as per provisions of the Standard.\nHowever, in respect of joint ventures in the form of joint controlled operations and jointly\ncontrolled assets, the Accounting Standard is applicable for both solo financial statements\nas well as consolidated financial statements.\n12.2.4 RRBs sponsored by banks would be treated as associates and therefore the\nprovisions of the Accounting Standard would not apply. The investment in RRBs will\nhowever, be accounted in the consolidated financial statements as per the provisions of\nAccounting Standard 23.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/35361.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Mar 29, 2003", "info": "Risk Management and Inter Bank Dealings\nA.P.

Background\n1.1 Effective management of credit risk is a critical factor in comprehensive risk\nmanagement and is essential for the long-term financial health of business organizations,\nespecially banks. Credit risk management encompasses identification, measurement, monitoring\nand control of the credit risk exposures. Reserve Bank of India had issued Guidelines for Asset\nLiability Management in February 1999 followed by guidelines on management of other risks\nsuch as credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and\noperational risks in October 1999. Detailed guidelines for management of credit risk have\nrecently been issued in October 2002.\n1.2 For enabling the banks and the financial institutions, in India, to manage their credit risk\neffectively it was being felt appropriate to permit them the use of credit risk hedging techniques\nlike the credit derivatives, which are over the counter (OTC) financial contracts and can help\nbanks and financial institutions in managing the risk arising from adverse movements in the\ncredit quality of their loans and advances, and their investments. Banks can derive many benefits\nfrom the credit derivatives such as,\n\u2022 Transfer credit risk and hence free up capital, which can be used in other\nopportunities,\n\u2022 Diversify credit risk,\n\u2022 Maintain client relationships, and\n\u2022 Construct and manage a credit risk portfolio as per their risk preference and appetite\nunconstrained by funds, distribution and sales effort.\n1.3 A Working Group on introduction of Credit Derivatives in India, comprising officers\nfrom the Reserve Bank of India and industry was set up to study the need and scope for allowing\nbanks and financial institutions to use credit derivatives, the regulatory issues involved and makesuitable recommendations in this regard. The Group has since submitted its report, which is\navailable on the Reserve Bank of India Website, rbi.org.in . The draft guidelines detailed herein\nare based on the recommendations of the Working Group and have been customized keeping in\nview the present regulatory environment, the state of development of the market for credit\nderivatives and the preparedness of the banks for using the credit derivative products.\n2. Conceptual Aspects\n2.1 Definitions\n2.1.1 For the purpose of clarity, the various terms used in this exposure Guidance Note are\nexplained hereunder. The definitions are largely based on the   ISDA (International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association) Credit Derivatives Definitions 1999 as modified from time to time. The\nWorking Group has suggested the use of the ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions 1999 by the\nparticipants in the transactions. However, the participants may also use any other definitions as\nmutually agreed between them.\n(i) Credit derivatives  are over the counter  financial contracts.  They are usually defined\nas \u201coff-balance sheet financial instruments that permit one party to transfer credit risk of a\nreference asset, which it owns, to another party without actually selling  the asset\u201d.  It, therefore,\n\u201cunbundles \u201d credit risk from the credit instrument and trades it separately. Credit Linked Notes\n(CLNs), another form of credit derivative product, also achieves the same purpose, though CLNs\nare on-balance sheet products. Another way of describing credit derivative is that it is a financial\ncontract outlining potential exchange of payments in which at least one leg of the cash flow is\nlinked to the \u201cperformance\u201d of a specified underlying credit sensitive asset.\n(ii) Protection Seller  refers to the party that contracts to receive premiums or interest-\nrelated payments in return for assuming the credit risk on an asset or group of assets from the\nProtection Buyer. The Protection Seller is also known in the market as the Credit Risk Buyer or\nGuarantor.(iii) Protection Buyer  refers to the party that contracts to transfer the credit risk on an asset\nor group of assets to the Protection Seller. The Protection Buyer is also known in the market as\nthe Credit Risk Seller or Beneficiary.\n(iv) Premium, is the  fee the protection buyer pays to the protection seller as in case of\ninsurance business .\n(v) Credit event  is defined as a scenario or condition agreed between the contracting\nparties that will trigger the credit event payment from the Protection Seller to the Protection\nBuyer. Credit events usually include bankruptcy, insolvency, merger, cross acceleration, cross\ndefault, failure to pay, repudiation, and restructuring, delinquency, price decline or rating\ndowngrade of the underlying asset / issuer.\n(vi) Credit event payment or settlement is the amount that is paid following a credit\nevent. This is defined in the contract, and is normally one of three types:\n(a) Physical delivery : payment of par or other specified value in exchange for\nphysical delivery of the Reference Asset (or a variety of assets) of the Reference Entity as\nallowed under some contracts.\n(b) Cash settlement : payment of par less recovery value. The Reference Asset will\nnormally retain some value after a credit event has triggered settlement of the contract. The\nrecovery value is normally determined at a date up to three months after the credit event, by\na dealer poll or auction.\n(c) Fixed Amount : Payment of a fixed amount.\n(vii) Reference Asset refers to the asset to which payments under the credit derivative\ncontract are referenced or linked. It is alos called reference obligation.(viii) Underlying Asset  refers to the asset on which credit risk protection is bought by the\nProtection Buyer. It could be a bank loan, corporate bond / debenture, trade receivable, emerging\nmarket debt, municipal debt, etc.  It could also be a portfolio of credit products. This is usually\nalso the Reference Asset.\n(ix) Reference Entity is the entity upon whose credit the contract is based.\n (x) Deliverable Obligation  defines what assets are eligible for delivery as settlement in a\nphysical delivery contract. It usually includes Reference Obligation but will often be broader to\ninclude other obligations.\n(xi) Obligations  defines what assets may trigger a Credit Event. These are usually same as\nthe underlying asset.\n(xii) Sponsor denotes the  entity that places the portfolio in a Special Purpose Vehicle for\nissue of notes.\n(xiii) Senior Debt means  that portion of funding in case of structuring of a Collateralized\nDebt Issue ( CDO), which has the lowest risk weight, or the highest rated debt.\n(xiv) Mezzanine Debt  refers to that portion of funding in case of structuring of a\nCollateralized Debt Issue ( CDO), which has debt in ascending order of risk weights, or in\ndescending order of ratings.\n(xv) Equity refers to the balance funding in case of structuring of a Collateralized Debt\nIssue ( CDO), which has the highest risk weight, or the lowest rated debt.\n2.2 Types of Credit Derivatives and basic structures:\nCredit derivatives can be divided into two broad categories:\n(a) Transactions where credit protection is bought and sold; and(b) Total return swaps.\n(a) Transactions Where Credit Protection Is Bought and Sold\n(i) Credit Default Swap ( CDS)\nIt is a bilateral derivative contract on one or more reference assets in which the protection\nbuyer pays a fee through the life of the contract in return for a credit event payment  by the\nprotection seller following a credit event  of the reference entities. In most instances, the\nProtection Buyer makes quarterly payments to the Protection Seller. The periodic payment is\ntypically expressed in annualized basis points of a transaction\u2019s notional amount.  In the\ninstance that no pre-specified credit event occurs during the life of the transaction, the\nProtection Seller receives the periodic payment in compensation for assuming the credit risk on\nthe Reference Entity/Obligation.  Conversely, in the instance that any one of the credit events\noccurs during the life of the transaction, the Protection Buyer will receive a credit event\npayment, which will depend upon whether the terms of a particular CDS call for a physical or\ncash settlement. With few exceptions, the legal framework of a CDS \u2013 that is, the\ndocumentation evidencing the transaction \u2013 is based on a confirmation document and legal\ndefinitions set forth by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA).  If a\nCredit Event occurs and physical settlement applies, the transaction shall accelerate and\nProtection Buyer shall deliver the Deliverable Obligations to Protection Seller against payment\nof a pre-agreed amount. If a Credit Event occurs and cash settlement applies, the transaction\nshall accelerate and Protection Seller shall pay to Protection Buyer the excess of the par value\nof the Deliverable Obligations on start date over the prevailing market value of the Deliverable\nObligations upon occurrence of the Credit Event.  The procedure for determining market value\nof Deliverable Obligations is based on ISDA definitions or may be defined in the related\nconfirmation and some cases a pre-determined amount agreed by both parties on inception of\nthe transaction is paid.\nThe structures of physically settled CDS and cash settled CSD are shown in Figure 1 and\nFigure 2 respectively.\nFigure 1\nPhysically Settled Credit Default SwapFigure 2\nCash Settled Credit Default Swaps\n(ii) Credit Default Option\n It is a kind of CDS where the fee is paid fully in advance.(iii) Credit Linked Note (CLN)\nIt is a combination of a regular note and a credit-option. Since it is a regular note with coupon,\nmaturity and redemption, it is an on-balance sheet equivalent of a credit default swap.  Under this\nstructure, the coupon or price of the note is linked to the performance of a reference asset.  It\noffers lenders a hedge against credit risk and investors a higher yield for buying a credit exposure\nsynthetically rather than buying it in the publicly traded debt. CLNs are generally created\nthrough a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), or trust, which is collateralized with highly rated\nsecurities.  CLNs can also be issued directly by a bank or financial institution.  Investors buy the\nsecurities from the trust (or issuing bank) that pays a fixed or floating coupon during the life of\nthe note.  At maturity, the investors receive par unless the referenced credit defaults or declares\nbankruptcy, in which case they receive an amount equal to the recovery rate.  Here the investor\nis, in fact, selling credit protection in exchange for higher yield on the note. The Credit-Linked\nNote allows a bank to lay off its credit exposure to a range of credits to other parties. Figure 3\nshows a simple CLN structure.\nFigure 3\nCredit Linked Note Structure\n(iv) Credit Linked Deposits/ Credit Linked Certificates of Deposit\nCredit Linked Deposits (CLDs) are structured deposits with embedded default swaps.\nConceptually they can be thought of as deposits along with a default swap that the investor sells\nto the deposit taker.  The default contingency can be based on a variety of underlying assets,\nincluding a specific corporate loan or security, a portfolio of loans or securities or sovereign debt\ninstruments, or even a portfolio of contracts which give rise to credit exposure.  If necessary, thestructure can include an interest rate or foreign exchange swap to create cash flows required by\ninvestor. In effect, the depositor is selling protection on the reference obligation and earning a\npremium in the form of a yield spread over plain deposits.  If a credit event occurs during the\ntenure of the CLD, the deposit is paid and the investor would get the Deliverable Obligation\ninstead of the Deposit Amount. Figure 4 shows the structure of a simple CLD.\nFigure 4\n(v) Repackaged Notes\nRepackaging involves placing securities and derivatives in a Special Purpose Vehicle ( SPV)\nwhich then issues customized notes that are backed by the instruments placed. The difference\nbetween repackaged notes and CLDs (Credit Linked Deposits) is that while CLDs are default\nswaps embedded in deposits/notes, repackaged notes are issued against collateral - which\ntypically would include cash collateral (bonds / loans / cash) and derivative contracts. Another\nfeature of Repackaged Notes is that any issue by the SPV has recourse only to the collateral of\nthat issue.\nFigure 5 below pictorially depicts the transactions under a Repackaged Note.\nFigure 5(vi) Collateralise d Debt Obligations (CDOs)\nCDOs are specialized repackaged offerings that typically involve a large portfolio of credits.\nBoth involve issuance of debt by a SPV based on collateral of underlying credit(s).  The essential\ndifference between a repackaging programme and a CDO is that while a simple repackaging\nusually delivers the entire risk inherent in the underlying collateral (securities and derivatives) to\nthe investor, a CDO involves a horizontal splitting of that risk and categorizing investors into\nsenior class debt, mezzanine class and a junior debt. CDOs may be further categorized, based on\nthe structure with which funding is raised.  The funding could be raised by issuing bonds, which\nare called Collateralised Bond Obligations (CBOs) or by raising loans, which are called\nCollateralised Loan Obligations (CLOs).   The transactions under a CDO are shown in figure 6.\nFigure 6\nCollateralised Debt Obligations.(b)Total Return Swaps\nTotal Return Swaps ( TRS), also called Total Rate of Return Swaps ( TROR) are bilateral\nfinancial contracts designed to synthetically replicate the economic returns of an underlying asset\nor a portfolio of assets for a pre-specified time. One counterparty (the TR payer) pays the other\ncounterparty (the TR receiver) the total return of a specified asset, the reference obligation. In\nreturn, the TR receiver typically makes regular floating payments. These floating payments\nrepresent a funding cost. In effect, a TRS contract allows the TRS receiver to obtain the\neconomic returns of an asset without having to fund the assets on its balance sheet. Should the\nunderlying asset decline in value by more than the coupon payment, the TRS receiver must pay\nthe negative total return, in addition to the funding cost, to the TRS payer.  At the extreme, a\nTRS receiver can be liable for the extreme loss that a reference asset may suffer following, for\ninstance, the issuing company\u2019s default.\n As such, a TRS is a primarily off-balance sheet financing vehicle.  In contrast to credit default\nswaps, which only transfer credit risk, a TRS transfers not only to credit risk (i.e. the\nimprovement or deterioration in credit profile of an issuer), but also market risk (i.e. any increase\nor decrease in general market prices).  In TRS payments are exchanged among counterparties\nupon changes in market valuation of the underlying, in addition to the occurrence of a credit\nevent as is the case with CDS contracts.\nFigure 7 shows the structure of a simple TRS.Figure 7\nTotal Return Swap\n3. Scope of Applicati on\nInstitutions covered\n(i) These guidelines will apply to all commercial banks.\nExtant RBI instructions on guarantees\n(ii) In terms of extant RBI instructions banks are precluded from issuing direct financial\nguarantees favouring other banks / financial institutions for loans extended except in case of\ninfrastructure projects, provided the bank issuing guarantee takes a funded share in the project at\nleast to the extent of 5% of the project cost and undertakes normal credit appraisal, monitoring\nand follow up of the project. These instructions relating to bank guarantees will not be applicable\nto transactions pertaining to use of credit derivatives as derivatives are normally concluded under\nstandardized master agreements, are structurally different from plain bank guarantees, and\nsubject to ongoing risk controlling, risk management and valuation procedures.\nType of activities\n(iii) Banks will be initially permitted to use credit derivatives only for the purpose of\nmanaging their credit risk, which includes\u2022 Buying protection on loans and investments for reduction of credit risk,\n\u2022 Selling protection for the purpose of diversifying their credit risk and reducing\ncredit concentrations and taking exposure in high quality assets,\nMarket making activities by banks in credit derivatives are not envisaged for the present.\n(iv) For the present banks will not be permitted to take long or short credit derivative\npositions with a trading intent. It means that banks may hold the derivatives in their banking\nbooks and not in the trading books except in case of Credit Linked Notes, which can be held as\ninvestments in the trading book if the bank so desires.\nTypes of derivative products\n(v) The credit derivatives range from plain vanilla products to complex structures. The\nvaluation standards, accounting norms, capital adequacy issues, methodologies for identifying\nrisk components and concentrations of   risks, especially in case of complex credit derivative\nstructures are in the evolutionary stage. Therefore, currently RBI proposes to restrict banks to use\nsimple credit derivative structures like credit default swaps and credit linked notes described in\nparagraph 2.2 (a) (i), (ii) and  (iii )  only, involving single reference entities, in the initial phase.\nThe credit default options will be treated as credit default swaps for regulatory purposes.\nParties to the transactions\n(vi) RBI has been allowing transactions between the banks and their financial services\nsubsidiaries on the principle of arms' length relationship i.e., the transactions should be on the\nbasis of market related rates and based on free availability of information to both the parties. As\nthe derivatives market will take time to develop, it would be difficult to have objective price\ndiscovery mechanism in the beginning and determine whether an arms' length relationship exits\nor not. Therefore, RBI proposes not to allow credit derivatives transactions between related\nparties till the players gain experience and maturity. Except for the above there will be no\nrestrictions on the parties to the transactions.Exchange Control Issues\n(vii) It is the intention of RBI to develop the credit derivatives as a domestic product for the\ndomestic loan and investments market, initially. As under the present exchange control\nregulations, there are certain restrictions on non-residents to acquire, hold and dispose of\nimmovable property in India, non-resident entities cannot be parties to credit derivative\ntransactions in the domestic market for the present.\n(viii) The underlying assets on which credit derivatives can be written could be either the\nrupee denominated assets or foreign currency denominated assets originated by domestic entities\nand having resident entities as the obligors. In case of foreign currency assets, the premiums and\nthe credit event payments can be denominated in foreign currency. In such cases, the participants\nin the transactions can only be such banks and financial institutions who are authorized to deal in\nforeign exchange.\n4. Capita l Adequacy and Provisioning\n4.1 Recognition of protection of credit risk- Minimum Conditions\nBank fulfills the following criteria of recognition of protection of credit risk:\n4.1.1 Existence of adequate Risk Management Policies, Procedures, and System s and\nControls\nThe credit derivatives activity to be undertaken by bank should be under the adequate oversight\nof its Board of Directors and senior management. Written policies and procedures should be\nestablished to cover credit derivatives business. Banks using credit derivatives should have\nadequate policies and procedures in place to manage associated risks. There should be adequate\nseparation between the function of transacting credit derivatives business and those monitoring,\nreporting and risk control. The participants should verify that the types of transactions entered\ninto by them are not inappropriate to their needs and needs of the counterparty. Further, all staffengaged in the business should be fully conversant with the relevant policies and procedures.\nAny changes to the policy or engagement in new types of credit derivatives business should be\napproved by the Board.\nPolicies\nThe policy duly approved by the Board of Directors should cover at the minimum ;\ni. The bank\u2019s strategy, appetite and limits for different types of credit derivatives\nbusiness,\nii. Authorization levels for engaging in such business and identification of those\nresponsible for managing it,\niii. Procedure for measuring, monitoring, reviewing, reporting and managing the\nassociated risks like credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and specific risks,\niv. Fair and cautious valuation and risk assessment of a portfolio\u2019s position,\nv. Calculation of derivative value adjustments independent of the business, size and\nreasons for adjustments to be transparent to the business management,\nvi. Pursuing the underlying borrower when a credit event payment has been triggered,\nvii. Determination of contractual characteristics of the products,\nviii. Use of best market practices.\nProcedures\nThe bank should have adequate procedures for:\ni. Measuring, monitoring, reviewing, reporting and managing the associated risks,\nii. Full analysis of all credit risks to which the banks will be exposed, the minimization\nand management of such risks,\niii. Ensuring that the credit risk of a reference asset is captured in the bank\u2019s normal\ncredit approval and monitoring regime,iv. Management of market risk associated with credit derivatives held by banks in their\ntrading books by measuring portfolio exposures at least daily using robust market accepted\nmethodology,\nv. Management of the potential legal risk arising from unenforceable contracts and\nuncertain payment procedures,\nvi. Valuation procedures and mechanism to determine adequate liquidity, especially,\nwhere the reference asset is a loan or the derivative has multiple obligors. Sometimes, banks\nmay face liquidity risk when counterparties are able to terminate transactions prematurely\nunder the contract. This should be indicated in the bank\u2019s liquidity management policy,\nvii. Determination of an appropriate liquidity reserve to be held against uncertainty in\nvaluation. This is important especially where the reference asset is illiquid like a loan,\nviii. Valuation adjustments to decrease the asset or increases the liability arising from the\ninitial valuation of a credit derivative transaction by bank\u2019s approved mathematical model. The\npurpose of the valuation adjustments are to report in the bank\u2019s statements of accounts the\n\u201cfair\u201d economic value that the bank expects to realise from its credit derivative portfolios\nbased upon current market prices and taking into account credit and market risk characteristics\narising from those portfolio position.\nSystems and Controls\nThe senior management should establish an independent framework for reporting, monitoring\nand controlling all aspects of risks, assessing performance, valuing exposures, monitoring and\nenforcing position and other limits. The systems and controls should:\ni. Ensure that the types of transactions entered into by the counterparty are not\ninappropriate for their needs,\nii. Ensure that the senior most levels of management at the counterparty are involved in\ntransactions by methods like obtaining from the counterparty a copy of a resolution passed by\ntheir Board of Directors, authorising the counterparty to transact in credit derivatives,\niii. Ensure that counterparties do not enter into transactions that violate other rules and\nregulations,\niv. Ensure adequate Management Information Systems to make senior management\naware of the risks being undertaken, which should provide information on the types of\ntransactions carried out and their corresponding risks, the trading income/losses,realized/unrealized from various types of risks/exposures taken by the bank, contribution of\nderivatives to the total business and the risk portfolio, and value of derivative positions,\nv. Assess and account for the possibility of default correlation between reference asset\nand the protection provider,\nvi. Ensure that trading activities, if undertaken (in case of credit linked notes for the\npresent) are properly supervised and are subject to an effective framework of internal controls\nand audits so that transactions are in compliance with regulations and internal policy of\nexecution, recording, processing and settlement,\nvii. Ensure that  the bank has the ability to pursue the underlying borrower when a credit\nevent payment has been triggered.\n4.1.2 Satisfaction of minimum criteria\nThe credit derivative should conform to the following minimum criteria i.e. , it should be direct,\nexplicit, irrevocable and unconditional .  These criteria are explained below:\nDirect\nThe credit protection must represent a direct claim on the protection provider.\nExplicit\nThe credit protection must be linked to specific exposures, so that the extent of the cover is\nclearly defined and incontrovertible.\nIrrevocable\nOther than a protection purchaser\u2019s non-payment of money due in respect of the credit protection\ncontract, there must be no clause in the contract that would allow the protection provider\nunilaterally to cancel the credit cover.\nUnconditional\nThere should be no clause in the protection contract that could prevent the protection provider\nfrom being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the original obligor fails to\nmake the payment(s) due.\n4.1.3 Satisfaction of Minimum Operational requirements\nIn order for protection from a credit derivative to be recognised, the following conditions must\nbe satisfied:\n(a) The credit events specified by the contracting parties must, at a minimum, include:\n\u2022 failure to pay the amounts due according to reference asset specified in the\ncontract;\u2022 a reduction in the rate or amount of interest payable or the amount of scheduled\ninterest accruals;\n\u2022 a reduction in the amount of principal or premium payable at maturity or at\nscheduled redemption dates;\n\u2022 a change in the ranking in the priority of payment of any obligation, causing the\nsubordination of such obligation.\n(b) Contracts allowing for cash settlement are recognised for capital purposes insofar as a\nrobust valuation process is in place to estimate loss reliably.  There must also be a clearly\nspecified period for obtaining post-credit-event valuations of the reference asset, typically\nno more than 30 days;\n(c) The credit protection must be legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions;\n(b) Default events must be triggered by any material event, e.g. failure to make payment over\na certain period or filing for bankruptcy or protection from creditors;\n(c) The grace period in the credit derivative contract must not be longer than the grace period\nagreed upon under the loan agreement;\n(d) The protection purchaser must have the right/ability to transfer the underlying exposure\nto protection provider, if required for settlement;\n(e) The identity of the parties responsible for determining whether a credit event has\noccurred must be clearly defined.  This determination must not be the sole responsibility\nof the protection seller. The protection buyer must have the right/ability to inform the\nprotection provider of the occurrence of a credit event;\n(f) Where there is an asset mismatch between the exposure and the reference asset then:\n\u2022 the reference and underlying assets must be issued by the same obligor\n(i.e. the same legal entity); and\n\u2022 the reference asset must rank pari passu or more junior than the\nunderlying asset, and legally effective cross-reference clauses (e.g.\ncross-default or cross-acceleration clauses) must apply.\n4.2 Recognition of amount of protection bought and sold\n4.2.1 The credit event payment or settlement amount will determine the am ount of credit\nprotection bought /sold in case of CDS. This could be payment of par or other specified value in\nexchange for physical delivery of the Reference Asset (or a variety of assets of the Reference\nEntity as allowed under some contracts ( Physical Delivery Settlement ), or payment of par less\nrecovery value ( Cash Settlement) or payment of fixed amount as per the CDS agreement ( Fixed\nAmount Settlement) . In case of CLN the amount of protection bought will be equal to the funds\nraised from issue of the CLNs and the amount of protection sold will be equal to the book value\nof the CLN.4.2.2 Some credit derivative contracts may contain a materiality threshold  specified for\ndetermining the loss that must be reached before a credit event is triggered. Therefore, the\nmateriality threshold may affect the amount of credit protection that may be recognized.\n4.3 Capital Adequacy for Credit Derivatives in the Banking Book\nAs stated in Paragraphs 3 .(ii) and (iii) above banks will be initially permitted to use credit\nderivatives only for the purpose of managing their credit risk and not for taking derivative\npositions with a trading intent. It means that banks may hold the derivatives in their banking\nbooks and not in the trading books except in case of Credit Linked Notes, which can be held as\ninvestments in the trading book.\n4.3.1 Protection Buyer\nWhere an asset is protected by a credit default swap (CDS), the Protection Buyer may replace the\nrisk weight of the underlying asset with that of the Protection Seller to the extent of amount of\nprotection as determined as per paragraph 4.2 above.   Where an asset is protected by a credit\nderivative funded by cash (CLN), the Protection Buyer may reduce the amount of its exposure to\nthe underlying asset by the amount of funding received. For the unprotected portions the risk\nweight of the underlying asset will apply.  The treatment of capital requirement will be modified\nif there are mismatches in the structures as discussed below.\nPresence of Mismatches\nIn many credit derivative transactions, it is difficult to achieve an effective hedge due to the\nexistence of mismatches and therefore, suitable adjustments will be made to the extent of credit\nprotection recognizable on account of presence of such mismatches as outlined below:\n        (a) Asset mismatches : Asset mismatch will arise if the underlying asset is different from\nthe reference obligation (in case of cash settlement) or deliverable obligation (in case of physical\nsettlement). The recognition of availability of protection will be made in terms of provisions of\nparagraph 4.1.3(f) above.\n         (b) Maturity mismatches : If the maturity of the credit derivative contract is less than the\nmaturity of the underlying asset, then it would construe as a maturity mismatch though theprotection buyer would be completely hedged if the contract maturity were to be higher than the\nmaturity of the underlying asset. In case maturity mismatches the capital adequacy will be\ndetermined in the following manner.\n(i) If the residual maturity of the derivative product is less than one year no\nprotection will be recognized and the risk weight of the underlying asset will\napply.\n(ii) If the residual maturity of the credit derivative is one year or more protection\nwill be recognized and the risk weight will be weighted average of risk weight\nof the Protection Seller and risk weight of the reference entity (weighted by\nproportions of period for which protection is available and the period for\nwhich protection is not available, counted from the date of contract  till\nmaturity of the derivative. Thereafter, the risk weight of the reference will\napply.\n(c) Currency mismatches : A currency mismatch is caused if the credit derivative\ncontract is denominated in a currency different to the underlying asset. In such an event, the\ncredit protection obtained should be marked to market to the prevailing exchange rate and if the\nvalue of credit protection (valued in terms of the currency of the underlying asset) is less than the\nvalue of the underlying asset, the residual risk must be risk-weighted on the basis of the\nunderlying asset.\n4.3.2 Protection Seller\nWhere a Protection Seller has sold protection through a CDS it acquires credit exposure to the\nReference Asset. This exposure is to be risk-weighted according to the risk weight of the\nReference Asset. In a funded credit derivative (CLN), the Protection Seller acquires on balance-\nsheet exposure to both the Reference Asset and the Protection Buyer. The CLN can be held in\nthe banking book or trading book as decided by the bank. If held in the banking book, the\namount of exposure will be equal to the book value of the note and will be risk weighted by the\nhigher of the risk weight of the reference entity or the Protection Buyer. Where the credit\nderivative is referenced to more than one obligor, the amount of credit protection provided would\ndepend on the structure of the contract.\nCapital adequacy for Credit Derivatives in the Trading BookAs stated in paragraph 3.(v) above banks will hold investments in CLNs issued by Protection\nSellers in their banking book or trading book. The assets in the trading book are held primarily\nfor generating profit on short-term differences in prices/yields as against assets in the banking\nbook which are contracted basically on account of relationship or for steady income and statutory\nobligations and are generally held till maturity. A CLN held in the trading book will represent  a\nposition to the note itself, with an embedded credit default product. A credit-linked note has a\nnotional position to the specific risk of the Reference Asset. There is also specific risk to the\nProtection Buyer and general market risk according to the coupon or interest rate of the note. The\nrisk weight for such positions would  be the risk weight for \u2018All other Investments\u2019 i.e. 102.50%\nas per present guidelines.\n4. 5 Provisioning Requirements\n4.5.1 Sufficient provisioning (based on what would be the provisioning applicable if the\nreference asset were on the seller's books) would have to be made by the credit protection seller\nif it is offering credit protection on a non performing asset.\n4.5.2 The protection buyer should not make any provision for a reference asset that has turned\nNPA and on which it has bought protection which is valid on date.\n5. Exposure Norms\n5.1.1 Exposure ceilings for all fund based and non-fund based exposures will be computed in\nrelation to total capital as defined under capital adequacy standards. As per present policy, from\nApril 1, 2003 exposure calculation will be computed on the basis of 100% of non-fund based\nexposures in addition to fund-based exposures.\n5.1.2 While determining the overall sectoral / borrower group / individual company exposure,\nsuitable reduction will be allowed in the level of exposure with respect to the credit protection\nbought by means of credit derivatives. Conversely, the protection seller's exposure would\nincrease as the protection seller acquires what is equivalent to a credit exposure on the reference\nasset.  For the credit protection seller, the method of measuring exposure that would be\napplicable would be similar to the manner in which non-fund based credit limits such asguarantees are reckoned. Once the exposure is computed to individual/group entities, banks will\nhave to ensure that they are within the overall ceiling as laid out in the relevant RBI guidelines.\n6. Issues Relating to Documentation\nIt is recommended that transactions in credit derivatives may be covered by the 1992 ISDA\nMaster Agreement and the 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions and subsequent\nsupplements to definitions with suitable modifications to suit conditions in India.  Credit Linked\nNotes that are typically issued as bonds will be subject to additional documentation requirements\nof bonds. However, banks should consult their legal advisors about adequate documentation and\nother legal requirements and issues of credit derivative contracts before engaging in any\ntransactions.\n7. Issues related to Accounting\n7.1 Normal accounting entries for cr edit derivative transactions are fairly straightforward\ndepending on cash flows that take place at various points in time during the tenor of the\ntransaction. e.g. for a credit default swap, there will be periodic payment of fees by the protection\nbuyer to the protection seller.  If there is a credit event, then settlement will be appropriately\naccounted depending on whether cash settled or settled via physical exchange versus par\npayment.\nFair Value Accounting\n7.2 Prudent accounting principles require t hat derivatives create assets and liabilities which\nshould be captured on the balance sheet at fair economic value based on current market prices\ntaking into account credit and market risk characteristics arising from these positions. All future\ncash flows arising from the contracts should be brought to present value using appropriate\ndiscount rates from mid-market data. The determination of future cash flows may require use of\nappropriate valuation models ranging from simple deterministic derivations to exotic pricing\nmodels.\n7.3 Banks may adopt suitable norms for accounting of Credit Default Swaps and Credit\nLinked Notes with the approval of their respective boards. All derivatives should be fair valued\nat least on a quarterly basis.  The changes in fair value must be reported in current earnings.\n8. Maintenance of Statutory reserves on CLN issued by banksNormally CLNs will be issued by SPVs set up by banks for specific purpose. However, it is\npossible that some banks may consider issuing CLNs themselves, in which case they have to\nmaintain CRR and SLR as required. However, before issuing CLNs, banks will be required to\ntake prior approval of RBI.\n9. Disclosures\nThe banks will be required to disclose the following in the Notes on Accounts of their annual\naccounts in respect of the credit derivative transactions:\n\u2022 The types of transactions carried out and their corresponding risks,\n\u2022 The gains/losses, realized/unrealized from various types credit derivative\ntransactions undertaken by the banks,\n\u2022 Contribution of derivatives to the total business and the risk portfolio,\n\u2022 Fair Value of derivative positions.\n*******", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/35292.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Mar 25, 2003", "info": "Interest Rates on Deposits\nRef.No.UBD.BPD.DIR /PCB.CIR .  42 /13.01.00/2002-03\n25 March 2003\nTo All Primary Co-operative Banks\nDear Sir,\nInterest Rates on Deposits\nPlease refer to our Directive No.UBD.DC.102/V.1-86/87 dated 25 June 1987 amended from\ntime to time on the captioned subject.\n2.

In order to ensure uniform accounting treatment in this regard and to impart an\nelement of transparency, it has been decided to lay down uniform accounting principles, in\nconsultation with Fixed Income Money Markets and Derivatives Association of India\n(FIMMDA), for repo/reverse repo transactions undertaken by  all the regulated entities.\nHowever, for the present, these norms would not apply to repo / reverse repo transactions\nunder the Liquidity Adjustment Facility ( LAF) with RBI.\n2. The uniform accounting principles will be applicable from the financial year 2003-04.\nOn implementation, market participants may undertake repos from any of the three categories\nof investments, viz., Held For Trading , Available For Sale  and Held To Maturity .\n3. The legal character of repo under the current law , viz. as outright purchase and\noutright sale transactions will be kept intact by ensuring that the securities sold under repo\n(the entity selling referred to as \u201c seller\u201d) are excluded from the Investment Account of the\nseller of securities  and the securities bought under reverse repo (the entity buying referred to\nas \u201cbuyer\u201d )  are included in the Investment Account of  the buyer of securities.  Further, the\nbuyer can  reckon the approved securities acquired under reverse repo transaction for the\npurpose of S tatutory Liquidity Ration ( SLR)  during the period of the repo.\n4. At present repo transactions are permitted in  Central Government securities including\nTreasury Bills and dated State Government securities. Since the buyer of the securities will\nnot hold it till maturity, the securities purchased under reverse repo by banks should not be\nclassified under Held to Maturity  category. The first leg of the repo should be contracted at\nprevailing market rates . Further, the accrued interest received / paid in a repo / reverse repo\ntransaction and the clean price (i.e. total cash consideration less accrued interest )should be\naccounted for separately and distinctly .\n5. The other accounting pr inciples to be followed while accounting for repos / reverse\nrepos will be as under:\n(i) Coupon\nIn case the interest  payment date of the security offered under repo falls within the repo\nperiod, the coupon s  received by the buyer of the security should be passed on to the seller on\nthe date of receipt   as the cash consideration payable by the seller in the second leg does not\ninclude any intervening cash flows. While the buyer will book the coupon during the period\nof the repo , the seller will not accrue  the coupon during the period of the repo. In the case of2discounted instruments like Treasury Bills, since there is no coupon, the seller will continue\nto accrue the discount at the original discount rate during the period of the repo. The buyer\nwill not therefore accrue the discount during the period of the repo.\n(ii) Repo Interest Income / Expenditure\nAfter the second leg of the repo / reverse repo transaction is over ,\n(a) the difference in the clean price of the security between the first leg and the second leg\nshould be reckoned as Repo Interest Income  / Expenditure in the books of the buyer / seller\nrespectively ;\n(b) the difference between the accrued interest paid between  the two legs of the transaction\nshould be shown as  Repo Interest Income/ Expenditure account, as the case may be ; and\n(c) the balance outstanding in the Repo interest Income /  Expenditure account should be\ntransferred to the Profit and Loss account as an income or an expenditure .\nAs regards repo / reverse repo transactions outstanding on the balance sheet  date , only the\naccru ed  income / expenditure till the balance sheet date  should be taken to the Profit and\nLoss account.   Any repo income / expenditure for the subsequent period in respect of the\noutstanding transactions should be reckoned for the next accounting period .\n(iii) Marking to Market\nThe buyer will mark to market the securities acquired under  reverse repo transactions as per\nthe investment classification of the security  . To illustrate, for banks , in case the securities\nacquired under reverse repo transactions have been classified under Available for Sale\ncategory, then the mark to market valuation for such securities should be done at least once a\nquarter. For entities who do not follow any investment classification norms, the valuation  for\nsecurities acquired under reverse repo transactions may be in accordance with the valuation\nnorms followed by them in respect of  securities of similar nature.\nIn respect of the repo transactions outstanding  as on the balance sheet date\n(a) the buyer will mark to market the securities on the balance sheet date and will account for\nthe same as laid down in the extant valuation guidelines issued by the respective regulatory\ndepartments of RBI.\n(b) the seller will provide for the price difference in the Profit & Loss account and show this\ndifference under \u201cOther Assets\u201d in the balance sheet  if  the sale price of the security  offered\nunder repo is  lower  than the book value.\n(c) the seller will ignore the price difference for the purpose of Profit & Loss account but\nshow the difference under \u201cOther Liabilities\u201d  in the balance sheet  if  the sale price of the\nsecurity offered  under repo is higher than the book value ; and\n(d) similarly the accrued interest paid / received in the repo / reverse repo transactions\noutstanding on balance sheet dates  should be shown as \"Other Assets\" or \"Other Liabilities\"\nin the balance sheet.\n(iv) Book value on re-purchase\nThe seller shall debit the repo account with the original book value (as existing in the books\non the date of the first leg) on buying back the securities in the second leg.3(v) Disclosure\nThe following disclosures should be made by banks in the \u201cNotes on Accounts\u2019 to the\nBalance Sheet.\n(Rs.

Further, to obviate disputes\narising out of repo transactions , the participants may consider entering into bilateral Master\nRepo Agreement  as per the  documentation finalized by FIMMDA .\nYours faithfully,\nsd/-\n( H R Khan)\nChief General Manager\nEncl : As above\nANNEX-I\nRecommended Accounting Methodology for Uniform Accounting of Repo / Reverse\nRepo transactions\na. The following accounts may be opened , viz. i) Repo Account, ii) Repo Price\nAdjustment Account, iii) Repo Interest Adjustment Account, iv) Repo Interest\nExpenditure Account, v) Repo Interest Income Account, vi) Reverse Repo  Account,\nvii) Reverse Repo Price Adjustment Account, and viii) Reverse Repo Interest\nAdjustment Account.\nb. The securities sold/ purchased under repo should be accounted for as an outright sale /\npurchase.\nc. The securities should enter and exit the books at the same book value. For operational\nease the weighted average cost method whereby the investment is carried in the books\nat their weighted average cost may be adopted.\nRepo\nd. In a repo transaction, the securities should be sold in the first leg at market related\nprices and re-purchased in the second leg at the derived price. The sale and repurchase\nshould be accounted in the Repo Account.4e. The balances in the Repo Account should be netted from the bank's Investment\nAccount for balance sheet purposes.\nf. The difference between the market price and the book value in the first leg of the repo\nshould be booked in Repo Price Adjustment Account. Similarly the difference\nbetween the derived price and the book value in the second leg of the repo should be\nbooked in the Repo Price Adjustment Account.\nReverse repo\ng. In a reverse repo transaction, the securities should be purchased in the first leg at\nprevailing market prices and sold in the second leg at the derived price. The purchase\nand sale should be accounted for in the Reverse Repo Account.\nh. The balances in the Reverse Repo Account should be part of the  Investment Account\nfor balance sheet purposes and can be reckoned for SLR purposes  if the securities\nacquired under reverse repo transactions  are approved securities.\ni. The security purchased in a reverse repo will enter the books at the market price\n(excluding broken period interest). The difference between the derived price and the\nbook value in the second leg of the reverse repo should be booked in the Reverse\nRepo Price Adjustment Account.\nOther aspects relating to Repo / Reverse Repo\nj. In case the interest payment date of the security offered under repo falls within the\nrepo period, the coupons  received by the buyer of the security should be passed on to\nthe seller on the date of receipt  as the cash consideration payable by the seller in the\nsecond leg does not include any intervening cash flows.\nk. The difference between the amounts booked in the first and second legs in the Repo /\nReverse Repo Price Adjustment Account should be transferred to the Repo Interest\nExpenditure Account or Repo Interest Income Account, as the case may be.\nl. The broken period interest accrued in the first and second legs will be booked in Repo\nInterest Adjustment Account or Reverse Repo Interest Adjustment Account, as the\ncase may be. Consequently the difference between the amounts booked in this\naccount in the first and second legs should be transferred to the Repo Interest\nExpenditure Account or Repo Interest Income Account, as the case may be.\nm. At the end of the accounting period the ,  for outstanding repos  , the balances in  the\nRepo / Reverse Repo  Price Adjustment Account  and Repo / Reverse repo Interest\nAdjustment account  should be reflected   either under  item VI - 'Others' under\nSchedule 11 - 'Other Assets' or  under item IV 'Others (including Provisions)' under\nSchedule 5 - 'Other Liabilities and Provisions' in the Balance Sheet , as the case may\nbe .\nn. Since the debit balances in the Repo Price Adjustment Account at the end of the\naccounting period represent losses not provided for in respect of  securities offered in\noutstanding repo transactions, it will be necessary to make a provision therefor in the\nProfit & Loss Account.\no. To reflect the accrual of interest in respect of the outstanding repo/ reverse repo\ntransactions at the end of the accounting period ,  appropriate entries should be passed5in the Profit and Loss account to reflect Repo Interest Income  / Expenditure in the\nbooks of the buyer / seller respectively and the same should be debited / credited as an\nincome / expenditure accrued but not due. Such entries passed  should be reversed on\nthe first working day of the next accounting period.\np. In respect of repos in interest bearing (coupon) instruments, the buyer would accrue\ninterest during the period of repo. In respect of repos in discount instruments like\nTreasury Bills, the seller would accrue discount during the period of repo based on the\noriginal yield at the time of acquisition.\nq. At the end of the accounting period the debit balances (excluding balances for repos\nwhich are still outstanding) in the Repo Interest Adjustment Account and Reverse\nRepo Interest Adjustment Account should be transferred to the Repo Interest\nExpenditure Account and the credit balances (excluding balances for repos  which are\nstill outstanding) in the Repo Interest Adjustment Account and Reverse Repo Interest\nAdjustment Account should be transferred to the Repo Interest Income Account.\nr. Similarly, at the end of accounting period , the debit balances (excluding balances for\nrepos which are still outstanding) in the Repo / Reverse Repo  Price Adjustment\nAccount should be transferred to the Repo Interest Expenditure Account and the\ncredit balances (excluding balances for repos which are still outstanding) in the Repo /\nReverse Repo  Price Adjustment Account should be transferred to the Repo Interest\nIncome Account.\ns.

BP. BC.  83 / 21.04.137/ 2002- 2003\nMarch  21,  2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\n( excluding RRBs & LABs)\nDear Sir,\nGuidelines for bank finance for PSU Disinvestments  :\nStipulation of lock-in period for shares\nPlease refer to paragraph 3 of Circular No. DBOD . BP. BC. 17/ 21.04.137/ 2002- 2003 dated\n16 August 2002 advising banks that, if the PSU disinvestment  shares against which bank\nfinance is proposed to be extended are illiquid due to lock-in period / restrictive clauses, the\nsuccessful bidder, to whom the bank proposes to extend finance, should obtain necessary\napproval from Government of India and other regulatory agencies exempting such equity\nholdings from these restrictions before bank finance can be extended.\n2.  The matter has since been reviewed , in consultation with the Government of India, and it\nhas been decided that :\ni) Banks should,  while deciding to  extend finance to the borrowers who participate\nin the PSU disinvestment programme, advise such borrowers to execute an\nagreement whereby they undertake to:\n(a) Produce the letter of waiver by the Government for disposal of shares\nacquired under PSU disinvestment programme during the lock-in period,  or\n(b) Include a specific provision in the documentation with the Government\npermitting the pledgee to liquidate the shares during the lock-in period, in\ncase of shortfall in margin requirement or default by the borrower.\nii) Banks may extend finance to the successful bidders even though the  shares of the\ndisinvested company acquired/ to be acquired by the successful bidder are\nsubjected to a lock-in period/ other such restrictions which affect their liquidity,\nsubject to fulfillment of following conditions:\na) The documentation between the Government of India and the successful\nbidder should contain a specific provision permitting the pledgee to liquidate\nthe shares even during lock-in period that may be prescribed in respect of\nsuch disinvestments, in case of shortfall in margin requirements or default\nby the borrower.2\nb) If the documentation does not contain such a specific provision, the\nborrower (successful bidder) should obtain waiver from the Government for\ndisposal of shares acquired under PSU disinvestment programme during the\nlock-in period.\n3.  As per the terms and conditions of the PSU disinvestments by the Government of India,\nthe pledgee bank will not be allowed to invoke the pledge during the first year of the lock-in\nperiod. During the second and third year of the lock-in period, in case of inability of the\nborrower to restore the margin prescribed for the purpose by way of additional security or\nnon performance of the payment obligations as per the repayment schedule agreed upon\nbetween the bank and the borrower, bank would have the right to invoke the pledge. The\npledgee bank\u2019s right to invoke the pledge during the second and third years of the lock-in\nperiod, would be subject to the terms and conditions of the documentation between\nGovernment and the successful bidder, which might also cast certain responsibilities on the\npledgee banks.\n4.   It is clarified that the concerned bank must make a proper appraisal  and exercise due\ncaution about credit worthiness of the borrower and the financial viability of the proposal.\nThe bank must also  satisfy  itself that the proposed documentation, relating to the disposal of\nshares pledged with the bank, are fully acceptable to the bank and do not involve\nunacceptable risks  on the part of the bank.\n5.   In terms of IECD Circular No. 10/ 08.12.01/ 2000- 2001 dated 8 January 2001, banks are\nprecluded from financing investments of NBFCs in other companies and inter-corporate\nloans / deposits to/ in other companies. The position has been reviewed and banks are advised\nthat SPVs which comply with the following conditions would not be treated as investment\ncompanies and therefore would not be considered as NBFCs  :\n(a) They function as holding companies, special purpose vehicles, etc. with not less\nthan 90 per cent of their total assets as investment in securities held for the\npurpose of holding ownership stake,\n(b)   They do not trade in these securities except for block sale; and\n(c)   They do not undertake any other financial activities.\nSPVs  which satisfy the above conditions would be eligible for bank finance for PSU\ndisinvestments of Government of India.\n6.

Cir.  39 / 09.29.00 /2002-03\nMarch 13, 2003\nThe Chief Executive  Officers of all\nPrimary (Urban) Co-operative Banks\nDear Sir,\nTrading of Government Securities on Stock Exchanges\nWith a view to encouraging wider participation of all classes of investors, including retail, in\ngovernment securities, it has been decided to introduce trading in government securities\nthrough a nation-wide anonymous, order driven, screen-based trading system of the stock\nexchanges, in the same manner in which trading takes place in equities. This facility of\ntrading of government securities on the stock exchanges, in the dematerialised mode only,\nwould be available to banks in addition to the present NDS of the Reserve Bank, which will\ncontinue to remain in place.\n2. Accordingly, the primary (urban) co-operative banks have the option to undertake\ntransactions in dated Government of India ( GOI) securities in dematerialised form on\nautomated order driven system of the National Stock Exchange ( NSE), The Stock Exchange,\nMumbai ( BSE) and Over the Counter Exchange of India ( OTCEI) in addition to the existing\nmode of  dealing through SGL accounts with  Reserve Bank of India or Constituent SGL\naccounts with the designated entities such as Scheduled Commercial Bank/Primary Dealer/\nState Cooperative Bank etc. as mentioned in our Circular UBD.No. BR. 47/ 16.26.00/ 2001-\n02 dated June 7, 2002. The scheme will subsequently be extended to GOI treasury bills and\nState Government securities.\n3. Trading in the government securities on the exchanges will take place in the same manner\nin which the trading takes place in the equities (Capital Market ) segment. The key elements\nof the stock exchange trading  framework  are :\n\u2022 automated  order  driven system\n\u2022 anonymous trade matching on price-time priority\n\u2022 T+3 rolling settlement\n\u2022 Intra-day multilateral netting of obligations\n\u2022 Settlement of fund  obligations through exchange clearing corporation / clearing\nhouse\n\u2022 Settlement  of securities through the depositories\nAs the trading facility on the above stock exchanges will operate in parallel  to the present\nsystem of trading in government securities, the trades concluded on the exchanges will be\ncleared by their respective clearing corporations/clearing houses. However, trading members\nof the stock  exchanges  shall not be involved in the settlement process  for any RBI regulated\nentity. All stock exchange trades of banks have to be settled either directly with clearing2\ncorporation/clearing house (in case they are clearing members) or else through  a clearing\nmember custodian.\n4. Banks, as institutional investors  on the stock exchanges, can undertake transactions only\non the basis of giving and taking delivery of securities. In other words, short selling  of\ngovernment securities, even on an intra-day  basis, is not permissible.\n5. With a view to facilitating participation on the stock exchanges within the regulations\nprescribed by RBI, SEBI and the exchanges, banks are being extended the following\nfacilities:\n(i) Open demat accounts with a bank depository participant (DP) of NSDL/ CDSL in addition\nto their SGL/ CSGL accounts with RBI.\n(ii) Value free transfer of securities between SGL/ CSGL and demat accounts is being enabled\nat Public Debt Office ( PDO), Mumbai, subject to operational guidelines issued separately by\nour Department of Government and Bank Accounts ( DGBA )  to all SGL account holders.\n6. The balances in government securities maintained by the banks in the depositories will be\nincluded for SLR purpose. Also, any shortfall in maintenance of CRR/ SLR resulting from\nsettlement failure (on either the NDS-OTC market or the stock exchanges) will attract the\nusual penalties.\n7. The Boards of primary (urban) co-operative banks   may take a conscious decision in\nregard to using the stock exchange platform  for making investments in government securities\nin addition to the existing NDS-OTC market. As regulations of SEBI   will also apply insofar\nas  trading  of government securities is concerned, the Board  should frame and implement a\nsuitable policy to ensure that operations are conducted in accordance with the norms laid\ndown by RBI/ SEBI and the respective stock exchange. Prior  to commencing operations, the\ndealing officials should  also  familiarise themselves with the basic operating procedures of\nthe stock exchanges.\nOperational guidelines:\n8. Banks should have proper internal control mechanism for transactions in Government\nsecurities as already advised in circular UBD. No. Plan. 13 / UB.81 /92-93 dated 15\nSeptember 1992. Banks should also put in place appropriate internal control systems catering\nto stock exchange trading and settlement  before commencing operations on the exchanges.\nThe back office arrangement should be such that trading on the NDS/OTC market and on the\nstock exchanges can be tracked easily for settlement, reconciliation and management\nreporting. Banks should, therefore, install enabling IT infrastructure and adequate risk\nmanagement systems.\n9.Only SEBI registered brokers who are authorised by the permitted exchanges ( NSE, BSE or\nOTCEI) to undertake transactions in government securities can be used for placing buy/sell\norders. A valid contract note indicating the time of execution must be obtained from the\nbroker at end of day.\n10. The dealing officials should independently check prices in the market or on the stock\nexchange screens before placing  their  orders with the brokers. The decision making\nprocesses cannot be delegated to brokers by the banks.3\n11. The transactions done through any broker will be subjected to the current guidelines on\ntransactions done through brokers. A limit of 5% of total  transactions ( both  purchases and\nsales) entered into  by a bank  during a year should be  observed as  the aggregate upper\ncontract limit  for each of the approved brokers as advised in the circular UBD.No.Plan. 74\n/UB.81- 92/93 dated 17 May, 1993. Accordingly, an approved  panel of brokers may be\nprepared every year after satisfying, inter alia,  the following (a ) SEBI registration (b)\ncurrent membership of NSE/ BSE/ OTCEI (c) performance i.e. market turnover in the\npreceding year as certified by the exchanges (d) market reputation, etc.\n12. Brokers/trading members shall not be involved in the settlement process; all trades have\nto be settled  through clearing member custodians. Hence, it will be necessary  for UCBs to\nenter into a bilateral clearing  agreement  with such service providers beforehand.\n13. All  transactions  must be monitored  with a view  to ensuring timely  receipt of funds and\nsecurities. Any delay or failure should be  promptly taken  up  with the concerned exchange /\nauthorities.\n14. At the time of trade, securities must be available with the banks either in their SGL or in\nthe demat account with depositories. Any sale on T+3 basis on the stock exchanges cannot be\ncovered by a purchase on the NDS/OTC market (even on T+0) and subsequent transfer from\nSGL account to their demat account for effecting deliveries. Similarly, no sale is permitted on\nNDS/OTC on T+0 against pay-in of securities expected on T+0 on the stock exchanges.\nFurther, the purchase transactions by banks should similarly be subject to availability of clear\nfunds in their settlement accounts at the time of  pay-in.\n15. Any settlement failure on account of non-delivery of securities/ non-availability of clear\nfunds will be treated as SGL bouncing and the current penalties in respect of SGL bouncing\nwill be applicable. The  stock exchanges will report such failures to the respective Public\nDebt Offices.\n16.

Each letter of credit should be supported\nby a copy of the contract and should contain the following reimbursement clause :-{PAGE  }\n\u201cReimbursement for 90 per cent of the f.o.b. value of the contract shall be provided by\nthe State Bank of India, New Delhi from USD 10 million credit extended by the\nGovernment of India to the Government of the Lao PDR.   The letter of credit is\nnegotiable after the State Bank of India has issued an advice that it is operative.  The\nletter of credit will be made operative by the State Bank of India after verifying that the\nreimbursement from the credit is sought for 90 per cent of the f.o.b. value only and it will\nbe the responsibility of the negotiating bank to ensure that the remaining 10 per cent  of\nthe amount of the letter of credit is received in US Dollars.  All claims to the State Bank\nof India for payment of 90 per cent of the f.o.b. value will need to be supported by a\ncertificate of the negotiating  bank  to the effect that 10 per cent  directly payable has\nbeen received.\u201d\n2. Contracts to be financed under the credit agreement should be signed and relative letters\nof credit established by December 31, 2003, and the full amount be drawn under the credit by\nDecember 31 ,  2004.  If the full amount is not drawn by the aforesaid date, the balance will be\ncancelled and the final instalment of the repayment to be made by the Government of the Lao\nPDR   shall be reduced accordingly, except as may otherwise be agreed to, by the Government of\nIndia.\n3.  Shipments  of goods and export of consultancy services  covered by the credit agreement\nshould be declared on GR/SDF/ SOFTEX  Form with prominent superscription reading \u201cExports\nto Lao PDR under Credit Agreement dated      November 6, 2002 between the Government of\nIndia and the Government of the Lao PDR.  The number and date of this circular should be\nrecorded on the GR/SDF/ SOFTEX Form in the space provided therefor.  On receipt of the full\npayment of the bills in the manner indicated above, authorised dealers should certify duplicate\ncopies of the relative GR/SDF/ SOFTEX Forms.\n4. Ordinarily, no agency commission shall be payable in respect of exports financed under\nthe line of credit.  However, Reserve Bank may consider on merit, requests for payment of\ncommission upto a maximum extent of 5 per cent of the f.o.b. value in respect of capital goods\nwhich require after sales service.  In such cases, commission will have to be paid in Laos by\ndeduction from the invoice value of the relevant shipment and the reimbursable amount will be\n90 per cent of the f.o.b. value minus the commission paid.  Approval for payment of commission\nshould be obtained before the relevant shipment is effected.\n5. Authorised Dealers may bring the contents of this circular to the notice of their\nconstituents engaged in exports to Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.\n6.

It aims to capture data mainly on the following\nareas\n(i) Consolidated Balance sheet data in the format prescribed\n(ii) Consolidated Profit & Loss Account in the format prescribedConsolidated Prudential Report{PAGE  }\n(iii) Select data on financial/risk profile of the consolidated bank:\nConsolidated financial data as per format, data on large exposures,\nforex exposures, CRR & SLR for the group and structural liquidity\nprofile for the consolidated bank as a whole.\n2. Periodicity of the return\nPeriodicity of the return is half-yearly as on March 31/ September 30. The first\nreturn may be submitted for the half-year ended March 2003.\n3. General  Guidelines\nFor compiling the consolidated balance sheet and profit & loss account as\npart of the CPR, the general guidelines for preparation of Consolidated\nFinancial Statements (CFS) and Consolidated Prudential Reports (CPR)\nissued by DBOD may be followed.\nThe following guidelines may also be used for preparing the return.\n4. Section D of the Return- Select data on financial/risk profile of the\nconsolidated bank\n(i)  Financials for the consolidated bank\nFor the consolidated financial data as per format (at the consolidated bank\nlevel), general guidance for preparation of balance sheet and profit & loss\naccount for CPR may be used.\n (ii) Large Exposures\nTotal credit exposure of the group to an individual borrower or a borrower\ngroup comprises both funded and non-funded exposures. For the purpose of\nexposure limits, outstanding amount or the sanctioned limit, whichever is\nhigher should be reported. Consolidation of the exposures from different\nentities of the consolidated bank would be required to be done by the\nreporting institution for compiling this section. Funded exposures: Comprise\nloans and advances (including bills purchased/discounted), and investments\nin bonds/debentures and equities. Non-funded exposures comprise\nguarantees (financial), guarantees (non-financial), letters of credit,\nunderwriting commitments, etc.Consolidated Prudential Report{PAGE  }\nExposure by the consolidated bank to a single borrower/ debtor should not\nexceed 15% of its capital funds. Exposure by the consolidated bank to a\nborrower/ debtor group should not exceed 40% of its capital funds. The\naggregate exposure on a borrower/ debtor group can exceed the exposure\nnorm of 40% by an additional 10% (i.e. up to 50%) provided the additional\nexposure is for the purpose of financing infrastructure projects. Computation\nof capital funds, exposure etc. would be the lines of the methodology adopted\nfor banks.\nIn this section, cases where the regulatory norm is breached in case of\nindividual borrower or borrower group may be reported. At the minimum, the\ntop 20 large exposures to individual borrowers/ borrower group of the\nconsolidated bank may be reported.\n (iii) Forex Exposures\nTotal of Overnight Open Position Limits for the consolidated bank may be\nreported here. Wherever Overnight Open Position Limits are not prescribed,\nthe maximum Overnight Open Position during the period for such entities\nmay be taken for consolidation.  The position may be reported without netting\nacross institutions.\n(iv)  Exposures to Capital Markets\nCalculations of Capital Market Exposure would be similar to the computation\nfor the parent bank. Advances (fund-based) to Capital Market would include\nloans to individuals, Share and Stock Brokers, Market Makers, etc., while\nNon-fund based facilities to Capital Market would include Financial\nGuarantees issued to Stock Exchanges on behalf of Stock Brokers and Other\nFinancial Guarantees. Equity Investment in Capital Market would include\nEquities, Equity Oriented Mutual Funds and Convertible Bonds and\nDebentures.\n(v) Exposure to Unsecured Guarantees and Unsecured AdvancesConsolidated Prudential Report{PAGE  }\nThe norms relating to unsecured guarantees and unsecured funded\nexposures on the lines of the guidelines issued to banks vide circular\nDBOD.No.666/C.96/(Z)-67 dated May 3, 1967, as amended from time to time,\nare also extended to the consolidated bank.\n (vi)  CRR and SLR for the Group\nIf the related entities in the  consolidated bank are banks,  liquidity position i.e.,\nCRR and SLR would be monitored on a consolidated basis after netting out\nintra-group transactions and exposures. If the related entities in the\nconsolidated bank are  heterogeneous comprising non-banking entities,\ncompliance with the CRR / SLR norms would be restricted to the banking\nentities on a consolidated basis. In respect of non-banking financial entities\nwithin bank groups, they should comply with the  liquidity  requirements\nprescribed at solo level.\n (vii) Structural Liquidity Position for the consolidated bank\nThis section is supposed to capture the maturity structure of cash inflows and\noutflows for the consolidated bank as a whole, which is distributed in 8\nmaturity buckets. The maturity mismatches or gaps run by the consolidated\nbank in these 8 time bands would indicate the liquidity risk facing the\nconsolidated bank. Intra-group transactions and exposures should be\nexcluded from this consolidation .", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/34670.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Feb 25, 2003", "info": "Consolidated Financial StatementsAppendix A\nFORMAT OF CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OF A BANK AND ITS\nSUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated  Balance Sheet of ________________________  (here enter name of\nthe parent  bank)\n(Rs.in crore)\nBalance Sheet as on March 31 (Year)\nParticulars Schedule As on 31.3.__\n(current year)As on 31.3.\n(previous year)\nCAPITAL & LIABILITIES\nCapital 1\nReserves & Surplus 2\nMinorities Interest 2A\nDeposits 3\nBorrowings 4\nOther Liabilities and Provisions 5\nTotal\nASSETS\nCash and Balances with Reserve Bank\nof India6\nBalances with banks and money at call\nand short notice7\nInvestments 8\nLoans & Advances 9\nFixed Assets 10\nOther Assets 11\nGoodwill on Consolidation1\nDebit Balance of Profit and Loss A/C\nTotal\nContingent liabilities 12\nBills for collection\n                                           \n1\n Where there is more than one subsidiary and the aggregation results in Goodwill in some\ncases and Capital Reserves in other cases, net effect to be shown in Schedule 2 and Assets\nside after giving separates notes.Consolidated Financial Statements{PAGE  }\nFORM OF CONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT OF A BANK AND ITS\nSUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated  Profit and Loss Account of ________________________ (here enter name of\nthe parent  bank)\n(Rs. in crore)\nProfit & Loss Account for the year ended March 31 ___\nParticulars Schedule Year ended\n31.3.__\n(current year)Year ended\n31.3.__\n(previous year)\nI.Income\nInterest earned 13\nOther income 14\nTotal\nII.Expenditure\nInterest expended 15\nOperating expenses 16\nProvisions and contingencies\nTotal\nShare of earnings/loss in Associates 17\nConsolidated Net profit/(loss) for the\nyear before deducting Minorities'\nInterest\nLess: Minorities' Interest\nConsolidated profit/(loss) for the year\nattributable to the group\nAdd: Brought forward consolidated\nprofit/(loss) attributable to the group\nIII.Appropriations\nTransfer to statutory reserves\nTransfer to other reserves\nTransfer to Government/Proposed\ndividend\nBalance carried over to consolidated\nbalance sheet\nTotal\nEarnings per Share1\n                                           \n1\n Earning per share should be for both basic and diluted.Consolidated Financial Statements{PAGE  }\nSCHEDULE 1 \u2013 CAPITAL\nParticulars As on 31.3.__\n(current year)As on 31.3.__\n(previous year)\nAuthorised Capital\n(....

BP.BC . 72 /21.04.018/2001-02\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(excluding RRBs and LABs)\nDear Sir,\nGuidelines for consolidated accounting and other\nquantitative methods to facilitate consolidated\nsupervision\nIn view of the increased focus on empowering supervisors to undertake consolidated\nsupervision of Bank Groups and since the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\nissued by the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision ( BCBS ) have underscored this\nrequirement as an independent principle, the RBI set up a multi -disciplinary Working Group\nin November 2000 under the Chairmanship of Shri Vipin  Malik , Director on the Central\nBoard of RBI.  The Working Group examined the feasibility of introducing consolidated\naccounting and other quantitative methods to facilitate consolidated supervision and made\nrecommendations accordingly. The Working Group has identified the following three\ncomponents of consolidated supervision :\n(a) consolidated financial statements ( CFS),\n(b) consolidated prudential reports (CPR), and\n(c) application of prudential regulations like capital adequacy and large exposures/ risk\nconcentration on group basis.\n2.  The draft guidelines on consolidated accounting and other quantitative methods to\nfacilitate consolidated supervision were prepared on the basis of the Working Group\u2019s\nrecommendations and were issued to banks vide letter DBOD.No. BP.2388 /21.04.018/2001-\n02 dated June 24, 2002, seeking their comments. On the basis of the feedback received from\nbanks and the deliberations with the officials of banks and FIs the draft guidelines have been\nrevised.  It has been decided to implement them with suitable changes, wherever considered\nnecessary.  Accordingly, the guidelines to be followed by banks to aid consolidated\nsupervision have been formulated to enable smooth implementation and are furnished in the {\nHYPERLINK  \\l \"anx\" }.\n3. You are adv ised to place the guidelines before the Board of Directors and ensure strict\ncompliance with the same commencing from the year ending March 31, 2003.\n4. Please acknowledge receipt.{PAGE  }\nYours faithfully\n  Sd/-\n(M.R.Srinivasan )\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nEncls: As above\nAnnexure\nGuidelines for Consolidated Accounting and other quantitative\nmethods to facilitate Consolidated Supervision\nScope\n1.  Initially, consolidated supervision would be mandated for all groups where the\ncontrolling entity is a bank.   In due course, banks in mixed conglomerates would be brought\nunder consolidated supervision,  where:\ni) the parents may be non-financial entities,   or\nii) the parents may be financial entities falling under the jurisdiction of other regulators like\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority or Securities and Exchange Board of\nIndia, or\niii) the supervised institution may not constitute a substantial or significant part of the group.\nComponents\n2. The components of consolidated supervision as proposed to be implemented by the\nRBI include:\na) Consolidated Financial Statements [CFS] , which are intended for public disclosure.\nb) Consolidated Prudential Reports [CPR]  for supervisory assessment of risks which may be\ntransmitted to banks (or other supervised entities) by other group members.\nc) Application of certain prudential regulations like capital adequacy, large exposures / risk\nconcentration etc. on group basis.\n3. Banks are required to put in place an appropriate MIS to support their compliance\nwith the consolidated accounting and reporting requirements.\nConsolidated Financial Statements ( CFS)\n4. All banks coming under the purview of consolidated supervision of RBI, whether\nlisted or unlisted should prepare and disclose Consolidated Financial Statements from the\nfinancial year commencing from April 1, 2002 in addition to solo financial statements.\n5.  Consolidated Financial Statements is required to be prepared in terms of Accounting\nStandard (AS) 21 and other related Accounting Standards prescribed by the Institute of\nChartered Accountants of India ( ICAI) viz. Accounting Standard 23 and Accounting Standard\n27.  For the purpose, the terms 'parent', 'subsidiary', \u2018associate\u2019, \u2018joint venture\u2019, 'control' and\n'group' would have the same meaning as ascribed to them in the above Accounting Standards\nof the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n6.  A parent presenting Consolidated Financial Statements should consolidate all\nsubsidiaries \u2013 domestic as well as foreign, except those specifically permitted to be excluded{PAGE  }\nunder Accounting Standard 21. The reasons for not consolidating a subsidiary should be\ndisclosed in Consolidated Financial Statements. The responsibility of determining whether a\nparticular entity should be included or not for consolidation would be that of the Management\nof the parent entity and the Statutory Auditors should comment in this regard if they are of the\nopinion that an entity which ought to have been consolidated had been omitted.\nComponents of Consolidated Financial Statements\n7. Consolidated Financial Statements should normally include consolidated balance\nsheet, consolidated statement of profit and loss, Principal Accounting Policies, Notes on\nAccounts, etc.\nFormat of Consolidated Financial Statements\n8. Since Accounting Standard 21 has not prescribed any format for publishing\nconsolidated financial statements, banks should adopt the format furnished in Appendix A for\npresentation of their consolidated financial statements. The Consolidated Financial\nStatements are in addition to the bank\u2019s solo balance sheet and profit and loss account\nprepared as per the formats prescribed under Section 29 of Banking Regulation Act ,1949.\nReference date\n9.  The financial statements used in the consolidation should be drawn up to the same\nreporting date.  If it is not possible, Accounting Standard 21 allows adoption of 6 month old\nbalance sheet of subsidiaries and prescribes that adjustments should be made for the effects of\nsignificant transactions or other events that have occurred during the intervening period.  In\nthe case that the balance sheet dates of parent and subsidiaries are different, inter-group\nnetting may be done as on the balance sheet date of the parent entity.  In the cases where the\nbalance sheet date coincides with that of the bank, the nationalised banks may publish their\nConsolidated Financial Statements without waiting for Comptroller and Auditor General audit\nof the accounts of their subsidiaries. However, banks have to ensure completion of statutory\naudit of the accounts of such subsidiaries before consolidation with the parent\u2019s accounts.\nAccounting policies\n10. Consolidated Financial Statements should be prepared using uniform accounting\npolicies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. If it is not practicable\nto do so, that fact should be disclosed together with the proportions of the items in the\nconsolidated financial statements to which the different accounting policies have been\napplied.{PAGE  }\n11.  For the purpose of preparing  Consolidated Financial Statements using uniform\naccounting policies banks may rely on a Statement of Adjustments for non-uniform\naccounting policies, furnished by the Statutory Auditors of the subsidiaries.\n12. If different entities in a group are govern ed by different accounting norms laid down\nby the concerned regulator for different businesses then, where banking is the dominant\nactivity, accounting norms applicable to a bank should be used for consolidation purposes in\nrespect of like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.  In situations where no\naccounting norms have been prescribed by the regulatory authority and different accounting\npolicies are followed by different entities of the group, balance of business may be used as a\ndeciding factor for application of accounting norms.  For dissimilar items and circumstances,\ndifferent accounting policies would have to be followed.\n13.  For the purpose of valuation, the investments in associates (other than those\nspecifically excluded under Accounting Standard 23) should be accounted for under the\n\"Equity Method\" of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standard 23.  Investment in\nRRBs sponsored by banks would also be treated as investments in associates for the purpose\nof Consolidated Financial Statements and accounted by \u201cEquity Method\u201d as prescribed under\nAccounting Standard 23.\n14.  The valuation of investments in subsidiaries which are not consolidated and associates\nwhich are excluded under Accounting Standard 23, should be as per the relevant valuation\nnorm issued by Reserve Bank of India.\n15. The valuation of investments in joint ventures should be accounted for under the\n\u2018proportionate consolidation\u2019 method as per Accounting Standard 27 on \u201cInvestments in Joint\nventures\u201d issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n16.  As regards disclosures in the \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements, banks may be guided by general clarifications issued by Institute of Chartered\nAccountants of India from time to time.\n17.   The Consolidated Financial Statements has to be submitted to Reserve Bank of India\nwithin one month from the publication of the bank\u2019s annual accounts.\nConsolidated Prudential Reports (CPR)\n18. In addition to the Consolidated Financial S tatements, banks coming under the purview\nof consolidated supervision of Reserve Bank of India should also prepare Consolidated\nPrudential Reports. Consolidated Prudential Reports will be initially introduced on half-\nyearly basis from March 31, 2003 as part of off-site reporting system on the lines of the{PAGE  }\nexisting DSB returns for the solo entities. The frequency of reporting would be subsequently\nreviewed and may be increased.\n19.  Consolidated Prudential Reports for half-year ended March has to be submit ted by end\nJune. If audited results of entities under the Consolidated Prudential Reports are not available ,\nbanks should submit the provisional Consolidated Prudential Reports with unaudited results\nof such entities, by end June.  However, Consolidated Prudential Reports for the half-year\nended March with audited results has to be submitted by end September.  The Consolidated\nPrudential Reports for half-year ended September has to be submitted by end of December.\nBanks should develop software for auto consolidation of Consolidated Prudential Reports at\ntheir end.\nScope\n20. Reserve Bank of India confines Consolidated Prudential Reports to all groups where\nthe controlling entity is a bank. If the bank is a parent company within a group, the bank\nshould submit Consolidated Prudential Reports for the entities under its control.\n21. Consolidated Prudential Reports for a consolidated bank should include information\nand accounts of related entities viz.  subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures of the bank,\nwhich carry on activities of banking or financial nature. Banks should justify the exclusion of\nany entity for the purpose of Consolidated Prudential Reports. All related entities of the bank\nmay be consolidated with the parent on the lines prescribed in the various Accounting\nStandards issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India viz. subsidiaries will be\nconsolidated on a line by line basis (AS 21), associates will be consolidated by the equity\nmethod (AS 23) and joint ventures will be consolidated by the proportionate consolidation\nmethod (AS 27).\n22. For the purpose of preparation of Consolidated Prudential Reports, the consolidation\nmay exclude group companies which are engaged in (a) insurance business and (b) businesses\nnot pertaining to financial services. The valuation of investment in related entities which are\nnot consolidated should be as per the relevant valuation norm issued by Reserve Bank of\nIndia.\n23. In respect of related entities which operate under severe long term restrict ions which\nsignificantly impair their ability to transfer funds to the parent, banks shall disclose separately\nthe book value of the amounts due from such related entities and the net amounts recoverable\nfrom them. Banks may also consider making appropriate provisions for the shortfall.\nFormat{PAGE  }\n24. The format of reporting for  Consolidated Prudential Reports purposes is enclosed in\nAppendix B. The Consolidated Prudential Reports comprises of Consolidated Balance Sheet,\nConsolidated Profit & Loss Account, and select data on financial/ risk profile of the\nconsolidated bank. The reporting format for the consolidated balance sheet and the\nconsolidated profit and loss account will be the same as prescribed in Appendix A for\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nApplication of Prudential Norms at group / on consolidated position\n25. For the purpose of application of prudential norms on a group wide basis, a\n'consolidated bank'  is defined as a group of entities which include a licensed bank, which may\nor may not have subsidiaries. As a part of consolidated supervision the following prudential\nnorms/ limits are prescribed for compliance by  the consolidated  bank:\na) Capital Adequacy\nb) Large Exposures\nc) Liquidity Ratios, mismatches, SLR, CRR (where applicable)\nCapital adequacy\n26. Banks have already been advised to voluntarily build into their own balance sheet, on\na notional basis, the risk weighted components of their subsidiaries at par with the risk\nweights applicable to the bank's own assets vide circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.169/ 21.01.002/\n2000 dated May 3, 2000. Banks were also advised to provide for capital shortfall in the\nsubsidiary in their own books in a  phased manner beginning from the year ending March\n2001 to rectify the impairment to their net worth on switch over to consolidated accounting.\n27. A Consolidated bank should maintain a minimum Capital to Risk-weighted Assets\nRatio ( CRAR) as applicable to the parent bank  on an ongoing basis from the year ending 31\nMarch 2003.  While computing capital funds, parent bank may consider the following points:\ni) Banks are required to maintain a minimum capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 9%. Non-\nbank subsidiaries are required to maintain the capital adequacy ratio prescribed by their\nrespective regulators. In case of any shortfall in the capital adequacy ratio of any of the\nsubsidiaries, the parent should maintain capital in addition to its own regulatory requirements\nto cover the shortfall.\nii) Risks inherent in deconsolidated  entities (i.e., entities which are not consolidated in the\nConsolidated Prudential Reports) in the group need to be assessed and any shortfall in the\nregulatory capital in the deconsolidated  entities should be deducted (in equal proportion from\nTier 1 and Tier 2 capital) from the  consolidated bank\u2019s capital in the proportion of its  equity\nstake in the entity.\nLarge Exposures{PAGE  }\n28. As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of\nconcentration of credit risks, in addition to adherence to  prudential limits on exposures\nassumed by banks, consolidated banks  should also adhere to the following prudential limits\non:\ni) Single & Group borrower exposures,\nii) Capital market exposures, and\niii) Exposures by way of unsecured guarantees and unsecured advances.\n29.  The oper ational details in this regard are furnished below.\ni) Exposure by the consolidated bank to a single borrower/ debtor should not exceed 15% of\nits capital funds. Exposure by the consolidated bank  to a borrower/ debtor group should not\nexceed 40% of its  capital funds. The aggregate exposure on a borrower/ debtor group can\nexceed the exposure norm of 40% by an additional 10% (i.e. up to 50%) provided the\nadditional exposure is for the purpose of financing infrastructure projects. Computation of\ncapital funds, exposure etc. would be on par with the methodology adopted for banks.\nii) The consolidated bank\u2019s  aggregate exposure to capital markets should not exceed 2 per\ncent of  its total on-balance-sheet  assets (excluding intangible assets and accumulated losses)\nas on March 31 of the previous year. This ceiling will apply to the consolidated bank\u2019s\nexposure to capital market in all forms, including both fund based and non-fund based,\nsimilar to the computation for the parent bank.   Within the total limit, investment in shares,\nconvertible bonds and debentures and units of equity-oriented mutual funds should not exceed\n10 percent of consolidated bank\u2019s  net worth.\niii) The norms relating to unsecured guarantees and unsecured funded exposures on the lines\nof the guidelines issued to banks vide circular DBOD.No.666/C.96/(Z)-67 dated May 3, 1967,\nas amended from time to time, are also extended to the consolidated bank.\n30. Liquidity Ratios :\n(i)   CRR & SLR requirements:\nThe existing liquidity requirements applicable to banks on a solo basis are extended to\nthe consolidated bank as well.

No. 214/ 07.01.279/\n2001-02 dated April 29, 2002. It has been indicated therein that with a view to moving further\nin complying with the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision drawn up by the\nBasle Committee on Banking Supervision, RBI would be issuing guidelines on country risk\nmanagement and provisioning therefor, in consultation with banks. The guidelines have since\nbeen finalised by RBI and are furnished in the Annexure .\n2. The guidelines may be placed before the bank's Board at the next meeting and appropriate\nsteps may be taken for their implementation.\n3. These guidelines are applicable only in respect of countries where a bank has exposure of\ntwo per cent or more of its assets. These guidelines shall be reviewed after one year, taking\ninto account the experience of banks in implementing the guidelines.\n4. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n( M. R. Srinivasan)\nChief General Manager-in-Charge\nEncls:  As aboveANNEXURE\nGuidelines on Country Risk Management by banks in India\nPolicy & Procedures\n1) Banks should formulate appropriate, well documented and clearly defined 'Country\nRisk Management' ( CRM) policies, with the approval of the respective Boards. The\nCRM policy should address the issues of identifying, measuring, monitoring and\ncontrolling country exposure risks. The Policy should specify the responsibility and\naccountability of the various levels for the country risk management decisions. Banks\nshould also put in place procedures for ensuring that necessary steps are taken in\naccordance with the CRM policy. The CRM  policy should be periodically reviewed by\nthe Board on the basis of the experience gained.\n2) Banks should institute appropriate procedures for dealing with country risk problems.\nThey should have in place contingency plans and clear exit strategies, which would be\nactivated at times of crisis. Appropriate systems/ procedures should be laid down with\nthe approval of the Board to handle situations involving significant changes in\nconditions in any country. For the present, only in respect of the country, where a\nbank\u2019s net funded exposure is 2 per cent or more of its total assets, the bank is required\nto formulate the CRM policy for dealing with that country risk problems.\n3) The CRM policy should stipulate rigorous application of the 'Know Your Customer'\n(KYC) principle in international activities which should not be compromised by\navailability of collateral or shortening of maturities. Country risk element should be\nexplicitly recognised while assessing the counter-party risk.\nScope\n4) Banks should reckon both funded and non-funded exposures from their domestic as\nwell as foreign branches while identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling\ncountry risks. In the case of foreign banks operating in India, the scope would be\nconfined to their branches in India. An illustrative list of funded and non-funded\nexposures is furnished below:\nFunded Exposures Non Funded Exposures\n\u2022 Cash balances\n\u2022 Bank balances\n\u2022 Deposit placements\n\u2022 Investments\n\u2022 Loans and  advances\n\u2022 Trade credits/receivables\n\u2022 Overdraft in Vostro Account\n\u2022 Remittances honoured under drawing\narrangement\n\u2022 Other monetary assets\u2022 Letters of Credit\n\u2022 Committed lines of credit\n\u2022 Guarantees\n\u2022 Performance bonds, bid bonds,\nwarranties.\n\u2022 Confirmation of LCs issued by foreign\nbanks.\n\u2022 Commitments undertaken against the\ncounter-guarantees of foreign banks.\n5) Banks should take into account indirect country risk. For example, exposures to a\ndomestic commercial borrower with a large economic dependence on a certain country\nmay be considered as subject to indirect country risk. Indirect exposures may be\nreckoned at 50 % of the exposure for the purpose of these guidelines.  For the present,only in respect of the country, where a bank\u2019s net funded exposure is 2 per cent or more\nof its total assets, the bank is required to reckon indirect country risk for measuring,\nmonitoring and controlling with that country risk.\n6) Exposures should be computed on a net basis i.e., gross exposure \u2018minus\u2019 collaterals,\nguarantees, insurance etc. Netting may be permitted for cash collaterals , bank\nguarantees and credit insurance available in/ issued by countries in a lower risk\ncategory than the country on which exposure is assumed.\nRatings\n7) Banks may put in place appropriate systems to move over to internal assessment of\ncountry risk. Banks should evolve sound systems for measuring and monitoring country\nrisk. The system should be able to identify the full dimensions of country risk as well as\nincorporating features that acknowledge the links between credit and market risk.\nBanks should use a variety of internal and external sources as a means to measure\ncountry risk. Banks should not rely solely on rating agencies or other external sources\nas their only country risk-monitoring tool. Banks should also incorporate information\nfrom the relevant country managers of their foreign branches into their country risk\nassessments. However, the rating accorded by a bank to any country should not be\nbetter than the rating of that country by an international rating agency.  For the present,\nonly in respect of the country, where a bank\u2019s net funded exposure is 2 per cent or more\nof its total assets, the bank is required to undertake internal assessment of country risk\nrating.\n8) The frequency of periodic reviews of country risk ratings should be at least once a year\nwith a provision to review the rating of specific country, based on any major events in\nthat country, where bank exposure is high, even before the next periodical review of\nthe ratings is due.\n9) Till such time, as banks move over to internal rating systems, banks may use the seven\ncategory classification followed by Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd.\n(ECGC) for the purpose of classification and making provisions for country risk\nexposures. ECGC shall provide to banks, on request, quarterly updates of their country\nclassifications and shall also inform all banks in case of any sudden major changes in\ncountry classification in the interim period.\nFor this purpose, banks may contact:\nGeneral Manager (Corporate)\nExpress Towers, 10th  floor,\nNariman Point,\nMumbai- 400 021.\nTel No.  022 \u2013 22023490\nFax No. 022 \u2013 22045253\nExposure limits\n10) Bank Boards may set country exposure limits in relation to the bank\u2019s regulatory\ncapital (Tier I + Tier II) with sub-limits, if considered necessary for products, branches,\nmaturity etc. The basis for setting the limits for the country/ category shall be left to the\ndiscretion of the banks\u2019 Boards. The country exposure limits set by the Board should be\nreviewed periodically and in any case should be at least once a year.11) Exposure limit for any country should not exceed its regulatory capital, except in the\ncase of insignificant risk category. In respect of foreign banks, the regulatory capital\nwould be the capital (Tier I + Tier II) held in their Indian books.\n12) Banks may also set up regional exposure limits for country groups, at the discretion of\ntheir Boards. The Board may decide on the basis for grouping of countries and also lay\ndown the guidelines regarding all aspects of such regional exposure limits.\n13) RBI may, if it becomes necessary, prescribe a prudential aggregate country exposure\nlimit for the higher risk categories.\nMonitoring of exposures\n14) Banks should monitor their country exposures on a weekly basis before switching over\nto real-time monitoring. However, exposures to high-risk (and above) categories should\nbe monitored on a real-time basis. Banks should switchover to real-time monitoring of\ncountry exposures (all categories) by 31st March 2004.\n15) Management of country risk should incorporate stress testing as one method to monitor\nactual and potential risks. Stress testing should include an assessment of the impact of\nalternative outcomes to important underlying assumptions.\n16) Boards should review the country risk exposures at quarterly intervals. The review\nshould include progress in establishing internal country rating systems, compliance\nwith the regulatory  and the internal limits, results of stress tests and the exit options\navailable to the banks in respect of countries belonging to \u2018high risk & above\u2019\ncategories. In case, any significant deterioration takes place in respect of any particular\ncountry risk or overall exposure, banks should report to the Board such developments\nin its next meeting, without waiting for the quarterly review by the Board.\n17) Country risk management processes employed by banks would require adequate\ninternal controls that include audits or other appropriate oversight mechanisms to\nensure the integrity of the information used by senior officials in overseeing\ncompliance with policies and limits.\nProvisioning / Capital requirement\n18) Banks shall make provisions, with effect from the year ending 31 March 2003, on the\nnet funded country exposures on a graded scale ranging from 0. 25 to 100 per cent,\naccording to the risk categories mentioned below. To begin with, banks shall make\nprovisions as per the following schedule:\nRisk category ECGC\nclassificationProvisioning requirement\n(per cent)\nInsignificant A1 0.25\nLow A2 0.25\nModerate B1 5\nHigh B2 20\nVery high C1 25\nRestricted C2 100\nOff-credit D 100For the present, only in respect of the country, where a bank\u2019s net funded exposure is 2\nper cent or more of its total assets, the bank is required to make provision for dealing\nwith that country risk exposure.\n19) The provision for country risk shall be in addition to the provisions required to be held\naccording to the asset classification status of the asset. In the case of \u2018loss assets\u2019 and\n\u2018doubtful assets\u2019, provision held, including provision held for country risk, may not\nexceed 100% of the outstanding.\n20) Banks may not make any provision for \u2018home country\u2019 exposures i.e exposure to India.\nThe exposures of foreign branches of Indian banks to the host country should  be\nincluded. Foreign banks shall compute the country exposures of their Indian branches\nand shall hold appropriate provisions in their Indian books. However, their exposures to\nIndia will be excluded.\n21) Banks may make a lower level of provisioning (say 25% of the requirement) in respect\nof short-term exposures (i.e. exposures with contractual maturity of less than 180 days).\n22) The issue of requiring banks to maintain capital to cover country risk would be\nconsidered at the time of implementation of the New Capital Accord.\n23) Banks shall be allowed to treat the \u2018provisions held for country exposures\u2019 on par with\nthe 'provisions held for standard assets' for being reckoned for Tier II capital, subject to\nthe ceiling of 1.25 % of the risk weighted assets.\nDisclosures\n24) Banks should disclose as a part of the 'Notes on Accounts' to the Balance Sheet as on\n31st March each year,\na. the risk category-wise country exposures, and\nb. the extent of aggregate provisions held thereagainst.\n25) The Statutory Auditors should look into and comment on the country risk exposures\nand the adequacy of provisions held.\nReporting\n26) Banks should report details of their country-wise exposures to the RBI as a part of their\nDSB returns along with the details of the provisions held therefor.\nReview\n27) These guidelines shall be reviewed after one year, taking into account the experience of\nbanks in implementing the guidelines.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/34592.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Feb 18, 2003", "info": "Prices of Government Securities in the Secondary Market\n18 February 2003\nUBD.BP.35/16.26.00/2002-03\nThe Chief Executive Officers of\nAll Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks\nDear Sir,\nPrices of Government Securities in the Secondary Market\nYou may be aware that the prices of all the trades done in Government Securities are\navailable on a daily basis on RBI\u2019s website ( www.rbi.org.in ) since January 1998.

As you are aware, the Hon\u2019ble  Finance Minister had announced in the Union Budget\n2002-2003 about the decision to set up a small group consisting of bankers and others, under\nthe chairmanship of Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India to suggest measures to make\nthe operations of the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) mechanism more efficient.\nAccordingly, a High Level Group under the chairmanship of Shri Vepa Kamesam, Deputy\nGovernor, Reserve Bank of India, was constituted. The Group has since submitted its report\nand has made certain recommendations for making the operations of the CDR mechanism\nmore efficient. Based on the recommendations made by the Working Group and\nconsultations with the Government of India, a revised scheme of Corporate Debt\nRestructuring has been finalised and is enclosed as Annexure for implementation by banks.\n3. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n(C.R. Muralidharan)\nChief General Manager\nEncls: as above\nAnnexure\nCorporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) System\n1 BACKGROUND\n1.1 Inspite of their best efforts and intentions, sometimes corporates find themselves\nin financial difficulty because of factors beyond their control and also due to\ncertain internal reasons. For the revival of the corporates as well as for the safety\nof the money lent by the banks and FIs, timely support through restructuring in\ngenuine cases is called for. However, delay in agreement amongst different\nlending institutions often comes in the way of such endeavours.CDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\n1.2 Based on the experience in other countries like the U.K., Thailand, Korea, etc. of\nputting in place institutional mechanism for restructuring of corporate debt and\nneed for a similar mechanism in India, a Corporate Debt Restructuring System\nwas evolved, and detailed guidelines were issued vide circular DBOD No.\nBP.BC. 15/21.04.114/2000-01 dated August 23, 2001 for implementation by\nbanks.  Based on the recommendations made by the Working Group to make the\noperations of the CDR mechanism more efficient (Chairman: Shri Vepa\nKamesam , Deputy Governor, RBI), which was constituted pursuant to the\nannouncement made by the Finance Minister in the Union Budget 2002-2003,\nand consultations with the Government, the guidelines of Corporate Debt\nRestructuring system have since been revised and detailed hereunder for\nimplementation by banks/ FIs. The revised guidelines are in supersession of the\nextant guidelines outlined in the aforesaid circular dated August 23, 2001.\n1.3 One of the main features of the revised guidelines is the provision of two\ncategories of debt restructuring under the CDR system. Accounts, which are\nclassified as \u2018standard\u2019 and \u2018sub-standard\u2019 in the books of the lenders, will be\nrestructured under the first category (Category 1). Accounts which are classified\nas \u2018doubtful\u2019 in the books of the lenders would be restructured under the second\ncategory (Category 2).\nThe main features of the CDR system are given below:\n2 OBJECTIVE\nThe objective of the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) framework is to ensure timely and\ntransparent mechanism for restructuring the corporate debts of viable entities facing\nproblems, outside the purview of BIFR, DRT and other legal proceedings, for the benefit of\nall concerned. In particular, the framework will aim at preserving viable corporates that are\naffected by certain internal and external factors and minimize the losses to the creditors and\nother stakeholders through an orderly and coordinated restructuring programme.\n3 STRUCTURE\nCDR system in the country will have a three tier structure:\n\u2022 CDR Standing Forum and its Core Group\n\u2022 CDR Empowered Group\n\u2022 CDR Cell\n3.1 CDR Standing Forum\n3.1.1 The CDR Standing Forum would be the representative general body of all\nfinancial institutions and banks participating in CDR system. All financial\ninstitutions and banks should participate in the system in their own interest. CDR\nStanding Forum will be a self- empowered body, which will lay down policies\nand guidelines, and monitor the progress of corporate debt restructuring.CDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\n3.1.2 The Forum will also provide an official platform for both the creditors and\nborrowers (by consultation) to amicably and collectively evolve policies and\nguidelines for working out debt restructuring plans in the interests of all\nconcerned.\n3.1.3 The CDR Standing Forum shall comprise of Chairman & Managing Director,\nIndustrial Development Bank of India; Chairman, State Bank of India; Chairman,\nICICI  Bank Limited; Chairman, Indian Banks' Association and Executive\nDirector, Reserve Bank of India as well as Chairmen and Managing Directors of\nall banks and financial institutions participating as permanent members in the\nsystem. Since institutions like Unit Trust of India, General Insurance\nCorporation, Life Insurance Corporation may have assumed exposures on certain\nborrowers , these institutions may participate in the CDR system. The Forum will\nelect its Chairman for a period of one year and the principle of rotation will be\nfollowed in the subsequent years. However, the Forum may decide to have a\nWorking Chairman as a whole-time officer to guide and carry out the decisions\nof the CDR Standing Forum.\n3.1.4 The CDR Standing Forum shall meet at least once every six months and would\nreview and monitor the progress of corporate debt restructuring system. The\nForum would also lay down the policies and guidelines to be followed by the\nCDR Empowered Group and CDR Cell for debt restructuring and would ensure\ntheir smooth functioning and adherence to the prescribed time schedules for debt\nrestructuring. It can also review any individual decisions of the CDR Empowered\nGroup and CDR Cell. The CDR Standing Forum may also formulate guidelines\nfor dispensing special treatment to those cases which are complicated and are\nlikely to be delayed beyond the time frame prescribed for processing.\n3.1.5 A CDR Core Group will be carved out of the CDR Standing Forum to assist the\nStanding Forum in convening the meetings and taking decisions relating to\npolicy, on behalf of the Standing Forum. The Core Group will consist of Chief\nExecutives of IDBI, SBI, ICICI Bank Limited, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India,\nPunjab National Bank, Indian Banks' Association, Deputy Chairman of Indian\nBanks' Association representing foreign banks in India and a representative of\nReserve Bank of India.\n3.16 The CDR Core Group would lay down the policies and guidelines to be followed\nby the CDR Empowered Group and CDR Cell for debt restructuring. These\nguidelines shall also suitably address the operational difficulties experienced in\nthe functioning of the CDR Empowered Group. The CDR Core Group shall also\nprescribe the PERT chart for processing of cases referred to the CDR system and\ndecide on the modalities for enforcement of the time frame.  The CDR Core\nGroup shall also lay down guidelines to ensure that over-optimistic projections\nare not assumed while preparing / approving restructuring proposals especially\nwith regard to capacity utilization, price of products, profit margin, demand,\navailability of raw materials, input-output ratio and likely impact of imports /\ninternational cost competitiveness.\n3.2 CDR Empowered GroupCDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\n3.2.1 The individual cases of corporate debt restructuring shall be decided by the CDR\nEmpowered Group, consisting of ED level representatives of IDBI, ICICI Bank\nLtd. and SBI as standing members, in addition to ED level representatives of\nfinancial institutions and banks who have an exposure to the concerned company.\nWhile the standing members will facilitate the conduct of the Group\u2019s meetings,\nvoting will be in proportion to the exposure of the lenders only.  In order to make\nthe CDR Empowered Group effective and broad based and operate efficiently\nand smoothly, it would have to be ensured that participating institutions / banks\napprove a panel of senior officers to represent them in the CDR Empowered\nGroup and ensure that they depute officials only from among the panel to attend\nthe meetings of CDR Empowered Group. Further, nominees who attend the\nmeeting pertaining to one account should invariably attend all the meetings\npertaining to that account instead of deputing their representatives.\n3.2.2 The level of representation of banks/ financial institutions on the CDR\nEmpowered Group should be at a sufficiently senior level to ensure that\nconcerned bank / FI abides by the necessary commitments including sacrifices,\nmade towards debt restructuring. There should be a general authorisation by the\nrespective Boards of the participating institutions / banks in favour of their\nrepresentatives on the CDR Empowered Group, authorising them to take\ndecisions on behalf of their organization, regarding restructuring of debts of\nindividual corporates.\n3.2.3 The CDR Empowered Group will consider the preliminary report of all cases of\nrequests of restructuring, submitted to it by the CDR Cell. After the Empowered\nGroup decides that restructuring of the company is prima-facie feasible and the\nenterprise is potentially viable in terms of the policies and guidelines evolved by\nStanding Forum, the detailed restructuring package will be worked out by the\nCDR Cell in conjunction with the Lead Institution. However, if the lead\ninstitution faces difficulties in working out the detailed restructuring package, the\nparticipating banks / financial institutions should decide upon the alternate\ninstitution / bank which would work out the detailed restructuring package at the\nfirst meeting of the Empowered Group when the preliminary report of the CDR\nCell comes up for consideration.\n3.2.4 The CDR Empowered Group would be mandated to look into each case of debt\nrestructuring, examine the viability and rehabilitation potential of the Company\nand approve the restructuring package within a specified time frame of 90 days,\nor at best within 180 days of reference to the Empowered Group.  The CDR\nEmpowered Group shall decide on the acceptable viability benchmark levels on\nthe following illustrative parameters, which may be applied on a case-by-case\nbasis, based on the merits of each case:\n\u2022 Return on Capital Employed ( ROCE),\n\u2022 Debt Service Coverage Ratio ( DSCR),\n\u2022 Gap between the Internal Rate of Return ( IRR) and the Cost of Fund\n(CoF),\n\u2022 Extent of sacrifice.CDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\n3.2.5 The Boards of each bank / FI should authorise its Chief Executive Officer ( CEO)\nand / or Executive Director (ED) to decide on the restructuring package in respect\nof cases referred to the CDR system, with the requisite requirements to meet the\ncontrol needs. CDR Empowered Group will meet on two or three occasions in\nrespect of each borrowal account. This will provide an opportunity to the\nparticipating members to seek proper authorisations from their CEO / ED, in case\nof need, in respect of those cases where the critical parameters of restructuring\nare beyond the authority delegated to him / her.\n3.2.6 The decisions of the CDR Empowered Group shall be final. If restructuring of\ndebt is found to be viable and feasible and approved by the Empowered Group,\nthe company would be put on the restructuring mode. If restructuring is not found\nviable, the creditors would then be free to take necessary steps for immediate\nrecovery of dues and / or liquidation or winding up of the company, collectively\nor individually.\n3.3 CDR Cell\n3.3.1 The CDR Standing Forum and the CDR Empowered Group will be assisted by a\nCDR Cell in all their functions. The CDR Cell will make the initial scrutiny of\nthe proposals received from borrowers / lenders, by calling for proposed\nrehabilitation plan and other information and put up the matter before the CDR\nEmpowered Group, within one month to decide whether rehabilitation is prima\nfacie feasible. If found feasible, the CDR Cell will proceed to prepare detailed\nRehabilitation Plan with the help of lenders and, if necessary, experts to be\nengaged from outside. If not found prima facie feasible, the lenders may start\naction for recovery of their dues.\n3.3.2 All references for corporate debt restructuring by lenders or borrowers will be\nmade to the CDR Cell. It shall be the responsibility of the lead institution / major\nstakeholder to the corporate, to work out a preliminary restructuring plan in\nconsultation with other stakeholders and submit to the CDR Cell within one\nmonth. The CDR Cell will prepare the restructuring plan in terms of the general\npolicies and guidelines approved by the CDR Standing Forum and place for\nconsideration of the Empowered Group within 30 days for decision. The\nEmpowered Group can approve or suggest modifications but ensure that a final\ndecision is taken within a total period of 90 days. However, for sufficient reasons\nthe period can be extended up to a maximum of 180 days from the date of\nreference to the CDR Cell.\n3.4 The CDR Standing Forum, the CDR Empowered Group and CDR Cell shall be\ninitially housed in IDBI and thereafter at a place as may be decided by the\nStanding Forum. The administrative and other costs shall be shared by all\nfinancial institutions and banks. The sharing pattern shall be as determined by the\nStanding Forum.\n3.5 CDR Cell will have adequate members of staff deputed from banks and financial\ninstitutions. The CDR Cell may also take outside professional help. The initial\ncost in operating the CDR  mechanism including CDR  Cell will be met by IDBICDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\ninitially for one year and then from contribution from the financial institutions\nand banks in the Core Group at the rate of Rs.50 lakh each and contribution from\nother institutions and banks at the rate of Rs.5 lakh each.\n4 OTHER FEATURES\n4.1 Eligibility criteria\n4.1.1 The scheme will not apply to accounts involving only one financial institution or\none bank. The CDR mechanism will cover only multiple banking accounts /\nsyndication / consortium accounts with outstanding exposure of Rs.20 crore and\nabove by banks and institutions.\n4.1.2 The Category 1 CDR system will be applicable only to accounts classified as\n'standard' and 'sub-standard'.  There may be a situation where a small portion of\ndebt by a bank might be classified as doubtful.  In that situation, if the account\nhas been classified as \u2018standard\u2019/ \u2018substandard\u2019 in the books of at least 90% of\nlenders (by value), the same would be treated as standard / substandard, only for\nthe purpose of judging the account as eligibile  for CDR, in the books of the\nremaining 10% of lenders.  There would be no requirement of the account /\ncompany being sick, NPA or being in default for a specified period before\nreference to the CDR system. However, potentially viable cases of NPAs will get\npriority. This approach would provide the necessary flexibility and facilitate\ntimely intervention for debt restructuring. Prescribing any milestone(s) may not\nbe necessary, since the debt restructuring exercise is being triggered by banks and\nfinancial institutions or with their consent.\n4.1.3 In no case, the requests of any corporate indulging in wilful default, fraud or\nmisfeasance, even in a single bank , will be considered for restructuring under\nCDR system.\n4.1.4 The accounts where recovery suits have been filed by the lenders against the\ncompany, may be eligible for consideration under the CDR system provided, the\ninitiative to resolve the case under the CDR system is taken by at least 75% of\nthe lenders (by value). However, for restructuring of such accounts under the\nCDR system, it should be ensured that the account meets the basic criteria for\nbecoming eligible under the CDR mechanism.\n4.1.5 BIFR cases are not eligible for restructuring under the CDR system. However,\nlarge value BIFR cases, may be eligible for restructuring under the CDR system\nif specifically recommended by the CDR Core Group. The Core Group shall\nrecommend exceptional BIFR cases on a case-to-case basis for consideration\nunder the CDR system. It should be ensured that the lending institutions complete\nall the formalities in seeking the approval from BIFR before implementing the\npackage.\n4.2 Reference to CDR system\n4.2.1 Reference to Corporate Debt Restructuring System could be triggered by  (i) any\nor more of the creditor who have minimum 20% share in either working capitalCDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\nor term finance, or (ii) by the concerned corporate, if supported by a bank or\nfinancial institution having stake as in ( i) above.\n4.2.2 Though flexibility is available whereby the lenders could either consider\nrestructuring outside the purview of the CDR system or even initiate legal\nproceedings where warranted, banks / FIs should review all eligible cases where\nthe exposure of the financial system is more than Rs.100 crore  and decide about\nreferring the case to CDR system or to proceed under the new Securitisation  and\nReconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act,\n2002 or to file a suit in DRT  etc.\n4.3 Legal Basis\n4.3.1 CDR will be a non-statutory mechanism which will be a voluntary system based\non Debtor-Creditor Agreement ( DCA) and Inter-Creditor Agreement ( ICA).\n4.3.2 The Debtor-Creditor Agreement ( DCA) and the Inter-Creditor Agreement ( ICA)\nshall provide the legal basis to the CDR mechanism. The debtors shall have to\naccede to the DCA, either at the time of original loan documentation (for future\ncases) or at the time of reference to Corporate Debt Restructuring Cell. Similarly,\nall participants in the CDR mechanism through their membership of the Standing\nForum shall have to enter into a legally binding agreement, with necessary\nenforcement and penal clauses, to operate the System through laid-down policies\nand guidelines.  The ICA signed by the creditors will be initially valid for a\nperiod of 3 years and subject to renewal for further periods of 3 years thereafter.\nThe lenders in foreign currency outside the country are not a part of CDR system.\nSuch lenders and also lenders like GIC, LIC, UTI, etc., and other third parties\nwho have not joined the CDR system, could join CDR mechanism of a particular\ncorporate by signing transaction to transaction ICA, wherever they have exposure\nto such corporate.\n4.3.3 The Inter-Creditor Agreement would be a legally binding agreement amongst the\ncreditors, with necessary enforcement and penal clauses, wherein the creditors\nwould commit themselves to abide by the various elements of CDR system.\nFurther, the creditors shall agree that if 75 per cent of creditors by value, agree to\na restructuring package of an existing debt (i.e., debt outstanding), the same\nwould be binding on the remaining creditors.  Since Category 1 CDR Scheme\ncovers only standard and sub-standard accounts, which in the opinion of 75 per\ncent of the creditors, are likely to become performing after introduction of the\nCDR package, it is expected that all other creditors (i.e., those outside the\nminimum 75 per cent) would be willing to participate in the entire CDR package,\nincluding the agreed additional financing.  However, in case for any internal\nreason, any creditor (outside the minimum 75 per cent) does not wish to commit\nadditional financing, that creditor will have the option.  At the same time, in\norder to avoid the \u201cfree rider\u201d problem, it is necessary to provide some\ndisincentive to the creditor who wishes to exercise this option.  Such creditor can\neither (a) arrange for his share of additional financing to be provided by a new or\nexisting creditor, or (b) agree to deferment of the first year\u2019s interest due to him\nafter the CDR package becomes effective.  The first year\u2019s deferred interest as\nmentioned above, without compounding, will be payable along with the last\ninstalment of the principal due to the creditor.CDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\n4.4 Stand-Still Clause\n4.4.1 One of the most important elements of Debtor-Creditor Agreement would be\n'stand still' agreement binding for 90 days, or 180 days by both sides. Under this\nclause, both the debtor and creditor(s) shall agree to a legally binding 'stand-still'\nwhereby both the parties commit themselves not to taking recourse to any other\nlegal action during the 'stand-still' period, this would be necessary for enabling\nthe CDR System to undertake the necessary debt restructuring exercise without\nany outside intervention, judicial or otherwise. However, the stand-still clause\nwill be applicable only to any civil action either by the borrower or any lender\nagainst the other party and will not cover any criminal action.  Further, during the\nstand-still period, outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts, derivative\nproducts, etc., can be crystallised, provided the borrower is agreeable to such\ncrystallisation.   The borrower will additionally undertake that during the stand-\nstill period the documents will stand extended for the purpose of limitation and\nalso that he will not approach any other authority for any relief and the directors\nof the borrowing company will not resign from the Board of Directors during the\nstand-still period.\n4.4.2 During pendency of the case with the CDR system, the usual asset classification\nnorms would continue to apply. The process of reclassification of an asset should\nnot stop merely because the case is referred to the CDR Cell. However, if\nrestructuring under the CDR system takes place, the asset classification status\nshould be restored to the position which existed when the reference to the Cell\nwas made. Consequently, any additional provisions made by banks towards\ndeterioration in the asset classification status during the pendency of the case\nwith the CDR system may be reversed.\n4.5 Additional finance\n4.5.1 The providers of additional finance, whether existing lenders or new lenders,\nshall have a preferential claim, to be worked out under the restructuring package,\nover the providers of existing finance with respect to the cash flows out of\nrecoveries, in respect of the additional exposure.\n4.5.2 The additional finance extended to borrowers in terms of restructuring packages\napproved under the CDR system may be exempted from provisioning\nrequirement for the specified period as defined at paragraph 5.2.3 below.\n4.6 Exit Option\n4.6.1 As mentioned in paragraph 4.3.3 above, the proposals for restructuring package\nshould provide for option to a particular lender or lenders (outside the minimum\n75 per cent who have agreed for restructuring) who for any internal reason,\ndoes/do not fully abide by the CDR Empowered Group's decision on\nrestructuring. The lenders who wish to exit from the package would have the\noption to sell their existing share to either the existing lenders or fresh lenders, at\nan appropriate price, which would be decided mutually between the exiting\nlender and the taking over lender. The new lenders shall rank on par with theCDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\nexisting lenders for repayment and servicing of the dues since they have taken\nover the existing dues to the exiting lender. In addition, the 'exit option' will also\nbe available to all other lenders within the minimum 75 per cent, provided the\npurchaser agrees to abide by the restructuring package approved by the\nEmpowered Group.\n4.6.2 The exiting lenders may be allowed to continue with their existing level of\nexposure to the borrower provided they tie up with either the existing lenders or\nfresh lenders for taking up their share of additional finance.\n4.7 Conversion option\n4.7.1 The CDR Empowered Group, while deciding the restructuring package, should\ndecide on the issue regarding convertibility (into equity) option as a part of\nrestructuring exercise whereby the banks / financial institutions shall have the\nright to convert a portion of the restructured amount into equity, keeping in view\nthe statutory requirement under Section 19 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949,\n(in the case of banks) and relevant SEBI  regulations.\n4.7.2 Exemptions from the capital market exposure ceilings prescribed by RBI in\nrespect of such equity acquisitions should be obtained from RBI on a case-to-\ncase basis by the concerned lenders.\n4.8 Category 2 CDR System\n4.8.1 There have been instances where the projects have been found to be viable by the\nlenders but the accounts could not be taken up for restructuring under the CDR\nsystem as they fell under \u2018doubtful\u2019 category. Hence, a second category of CDR\nis introduced for cases where the accounts have been classified as \u2018doubtful\u2019 in\nthe books of lenders, and if a minimum of 75% (by value) of the lenders satisfy\nthemselves of the viability of the account and consent for such restructuring,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n(i) It will not be binding on the creditors to take up additional financing\nworked out under the debt restructuring package and the decision to\nlend or not to lend will depend on each creditor bank / FI separately.\nIn other words, under the proposed second category of the CDR\nmechanism, the existing loans will only be restructured and it would\nbe up to the promoter to firm up additional financing arrangement\nwith new or existing lenders individually.\n(ii) All other norms under the CDR mechanism such as the standstill\nclause, asset classification status during the pendency of restructuring\nunder CDR, etc., will continue to be applicable to this category also.\n4.8.2 No individual case should be referred to RBI.  CDR Core Group may take a final\ndecision whether a particular case falls under the CDR guidelines or it does not.\n4.8.3 All the other features of the CDR system as applicable to the First Category will\nalso be applicable to cases restructured under the Second Category.CDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\n5 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR RESTRUCTURED ACCOUNTS\n5.1 The accounting treatment of accounts restructured under CDR system, including\naccounts classified as 'doubtful' under Category 2 CDR,  would be governed by\nthe prudential norms indicated in circular { HYPERLINK \"rbi9830-03-2001\" }\ndated March 30, 2001. Restructuring of corporate debts under CDR system could\ntake place in the following stages:\na. before commencement of commercial production;\nb. after commencement of commercial production but before the asset has\nbeen classified as \u2018sub-standard\u2019;\nc. after commencement of commercial production and the asset has been\nclassified as \u2018sub-standard\u2019 or \u2018doubtful\u2019.\n5.2 The prudential treatment of the accounts, subjected to restructuring under CDR\nsystem, would be governed by the following norms:\n5.2.1 Treatment of \u2018standard\u2019 accounts restructured under CDR\na.A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, at any of the aforesaid\nfirst two stages [paragraph 5.1(a) and 5.1(b) above] would not cause a\nstandard asset to be classified in the sub-standard category, provided the loan\n/ credit facility is fully secured.\nb.A rescheduling of interest element at any of the foregoing first two stages\nwould not cause an asset to be downgraded to sub-standard category subject\nto the condition that the amount of sacrifice, if any, in the element of\ninterest, measured in present value terms, is either written off or provision is\nmade to the extent of the sacrifice involved. For the purpose, the future\ninterest due as per the original loan agreement in respect of an account\nshould be discounted to the present value at a rate appropriate to the risk\ncategory of the borrower (i.e. current PLR + the appropriate credit risk\npremium for the borrower-category) and compared with the present value of\nthe dues expected to be received under the restructuring package, discounted\non the same basis.\nc.In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value\nterms, as at (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or\nprovision made to the extent of the sacrifice involved.\n5.2.2 Treatment of \u2018sub-standard\u2019 / \u2018doubtful\u2019 accounts restructured under CDR\na.A rescheduling of the instalments of principal alone, would render a sub-\nstandard  /  \u2018doubtful\u2019  asset eligible to be continued in the sub-standard /\n\u2018doubtful\u2019 category for the specified period, provided the loan / credit facility\nis fully secured.CDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\nb.A rescheduling of interest element would render a sub-standard / \u2018doubtful\u2019\nasset eligible to be continued to be classified in sub-standard / \u2018doubtful\u2019\ncategory for the specified period subject to the condition that the amount of\nsacrifice, if any, in the element of interest, measured in present value terms,\nis either written off or provision is made to the extent of the sacrifice\ninvolved. For the purpose, the future interest due as per the original loan\nagreement in respect of an account should be discounted to the present value\nat a rate appropriate to the risk category of the borrower (i.e., current PLR +\nthe appropriate credit risk premium for the borrower-category) and\ncompared with the present value of the dues expected to be received under\nthe restructuring package, discounted on the same basis.\nc.In case there is a sacrifice involved in the amount of interest in present value\nterms, as at (b) above, the amount of sacrifice should either be written off or\nprovision made to the extent of the sacrifice involved. Even in cases where\nthe sacrifice is by way of write off of the past interest dues, the asset should\ncontinue to be treated as sub-standard / \u2018doubtful\u2019.\n5.2.3 The sub-standard / doubtful accounts at 5.2.2 (a), (b) and (c) above, which have\nbeen subjected to restructuring, etc. whether in respect of principal instalment or\ninterest amount, by whatever modality, would be eligible to be upgraded to the\nstandard category only after the specified period, i.e., a period of one year after\nthe date when first payment of interest or of principal, whichever is earlier, falls\ndue under the rescheduled terms, subject to satisfactory performance during the\nperiod. The amount of provision made earlier, net of the amount provided for the\nsacrifice in the interest amount in present value terms as aforesaid, could also be\nreversed after the one-year period.\n5.2.4 During this one-year period, the sub-standard / doubtful asset will not deteriorate\nin its classification if satisfactory performance of the account is demonstrated\nduring the period. In case, however, the satisfactory performance during the one\nyear period is not evidenced, the asset classification of the restructured account\nwould be governed as per the applicable prudential norms with reference to the\npre-restructuring payment schedule.\n5.2.5 The asset classification under CDR would continue to be bank-specific based on\nrecord of recovery of each bank, as per the existing prudential norms applicable\nto banks.\n6 DISCLOSURE\n6.1 Banks / FIs should also disclose in their published annual Balance Sheets, under\n\"Notes on Accounts\", the following information in respect of corporate debt\nrestructuring undertaken during the year:\n(a) Total amount of loan assets subjected to restructuring under CDR.\n[(a) = ( b)+(c)+(d)]\n(b) The amount of standard assets subjected to CDR.\n(c) The amount of sub-standard assets subjected to CDR.CDR Guidelines 2003{PAGE  }\n(d) The amount of doubtful assets subjected to CDR.\n7 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REVISED GUIDELINES\nThe above guidelines will be implemented with prospective effect.

No. BP. BC. 67 / 21.04.048/ 2002- 2003\nFebruary  4, 2003\nAll Scheduled  Commercial Banks\n(excluding RRBs & LABs) &\nAll India Financial Institutions\nDear Sir,\nGuidelines on infrastructure financing\nPlease refer to our Industrial & Export Credit Department's Circular No. 16/ 08.12.01/ 2001-\n02 dated 20 February 2002 on financing of infrastructure projects. RBI has been receiving\nrequests in the recent past suggesting a need for review of guidelines on infrastructure\nfinancing by banks. In view of the above as also the critical importance of the infrastructure\nsector and high priority being accorded for development of various infrastructure services,\nthe matter has been reviewed in consultation with Government of India and the revised\nguidelines on financing of infrastructure projects are set out in the Annexure .\n2. Please acknowledge receipt.\nYours faithfully,\n( C. R. Muralidharan)\nChief General Manager\nAnnexure\nGuidelines  for Financing of Infrastructure Projects\n1.  Definition of  \u2018infrastructure lending\u2019\nAny credit facility in whatever form extended by lenders (i.e. banks, FIs or NBFCs) to an\ninfrastructure facility as specified below  falls within the definition of \u201cinfrastructure lending\u201d.\nIn other words, a credit facility provided to a borrower company engaged in:\n\u2022 developing or\n\u2022 operating and maintaining, or\n\u2022 developing, operating and maintaining\nany infrastructure facility that is a project in any of the following sectors:\ni) a road , including toll road , a bridge  or a rail system ;\nii) a highway project  including other activities being an integral part of the highway\nproject;\niii) a port, airport , inland waterway  or inland port ;2\niv) a water supply  project, irrigation  project, water treatment  system, sanitation and\nsewerage  system or solid waste management  system;\nv) telecommunication  services whether basic or cellular, including radio paging,\ndomestic satellite service  (i.e., a satellite owned and operated by an Indian company\nfor providing telecommunication service), network of trunking, broadband network\nand internet services ;\nvi) an industrial park or special economic zone  ;\nvii) generation or generation and distribution of power\nviii) transmission or distribution of power  by laying a network of new transmission or\ndistribution lines.\nix) Any other infrastructure facility of similar nature\n2.  Criteria for Financing\nBanks/ FIs are free to finance technically feasible, financially viable and bankable projects\nundertaken by  both public sector and private sector undertakings subject to the following\nconditions:\n(i) The amount sanctioned should be within the overall ceiling of the prudential exposure\nnorms prescribed by RBI for infrastructure financing (please see paragraph 5.1 also).\n(ii) Banks/ FIs should have the requisite expertise for appraising technical feasibility,\nfinancial viability and bankability of projects, with particular reference to the risk\nanalysis and sensitivity analysis ( please see paragraph 4 also).\n(iii) In respect of projects undertaken by public sector units, term loans may be sanctioned\nonly for corporate entities (i.e. public sector undertakings registered under Companies\nAct or a Corporation established under the relevant statute). Further, such term loans\nshould not be in lieu of or to substitute budgetary resources envisaged for the project.\nThe term loan could supplement the budgetary resources if such supplementing was\ncontemplated in the project design.  While such public sector units may include\nSpecial Purpose Vehicles ( SPVs) registered under the Companies Act set up for\nfinancing infrastructure projects, it should be ensured by banks and financial\ninstitutions that these loans/investments are not used for financing the budget of the\nState Governments.  Whether such financing is done by way of extending loans or\ninvesting in bonds, banks and financial institutions should undertake due diligence on\nthe viability and bankability  of such projects to ensure that revenue stream from the\nproject is sufficient to take care of the debt servicing obligations and that the\nrepayment/servicing of debt is not out of budgetary resources.  Further, in the case of\nfinancing SPVs, banks and financial institutions should ensure that the funding\nproposals are for specific monitorable projects .\n(iv) Banks may also lend to SPVs in the private sector, registered under Companies Act\nfor directly undertaking infrastructure projects which are financially viable and not for\nacting as mere financial intermediaries. Banks may ensure that the bankruptcy or3\nfinancial difficulties of the parent/ sponsor should not affect the financial health of the\nSPV.\n3.   Types of Financing by Banks\n3.1   In order to meet financial requirements of infrastructure projects, banks may extend\ncredit facility by way of  working capital finance, term loan, project loan, subscription to\nbonds and debentures/ preference shares/ equity shares acquired as a part of the project\nfinance package which is treated as \"deemed  advance\u201d and any other form of funded or non-\nfunded facility.\n3.2 Take-out Financing\nBanks may enter into take-out financing arrangement with IDFC/ other financial institutions\nor avail  of liquidity support from IDFC/ other FIs. A brief write-up on some of the important\nfeatures of the arrangement is given in the Appendix. Banks may also be guided by the\ninstructions regarding take-out finance contained in Circular No. DBOD . BP. BC. 144/\n21.04.048/ 2000  dated   29 February 2000.\n3.3 Inter-institutional Guarantees\nIn terms of the extant RBI instructions, banks are precluded from issuing guarantees\nfavouring  other banks/lending institutions for the loans extended by the latter, as the primary\nlender is expected to assume the credit risk and not pass on the same by securing itself with a\nguarantee i.e. separation of credit risk and funding is not allowed. These instructions are\npresently not applicable to FIs. While Reserve Bank is not in favour of a general relaxation in\nthis regard, keeping in view the special features of  lending to infrastructure projects viz.,\nhigh degree of appraisal skills on the part of lenders and availability of resources of  a\nmaturity matching with the project period, banks are permitted to issue guarantees favouring\nother lending institutions in respect of infrastructure projects, provided the bank issuing the\nguarantee takes a funded share in the project at least to the extent of 5 per cent of the project\ncost and undertakes normal credit appraisal, monitoring and follow up of the project.\n3.4 Financing promoter's equity\nIn terms of our Circular DBOD . Dir. BC. 90/ 13.07.05/ 98 dated 28 August 1998, banks were\nadvised that the promoter's contribution towards the equity capital of a company should come\nfrom their own resources and the bank should not normally grant advances to take up shares\nof other companies. In view of the importance attached to infrastructure sector, it has been\ndecided that, under certain circumstances, an exception may be made to this policy for\nfinancing the acquisition of promoter's shares in an existing company which is  engaged in\nimplementing or operating an infrastructure project in India. The conditions, subject to which\nan exception may be made are as follows:\n(i) The bank finance would be only for acquisition of shares of existing companies\nproviding infrastructure facilities as defined in paragraph 1  above. Further,\nacquisition of such shares should be in respect of companies where the existing\nforeign promoters (and/ or domestic joint promoters) voluntarily propose to\ndisinvest their majority shares in compliance with SEBI guidelines, where\napplicable.4\n(ii) The companies to which loans are extended should, inter alia,  have a  satisfactory\nnet worth.\n(iii) The company financed and the promoters/ directors of such companies should not\nbe defaulter to banks/ FIs.\n(iv) In order to ensure that the borrower has a substantial stake in the infrastructure\ncompany, bank finance should be restricted to 50% of the finance required for\nacquiring the promoter's stake in the company being acquired.\n(v) Finance extended should be against the security of the assets of the borrowing\ncompany or the assets of the company acquired and not against the shares of that\ncompany or the company being acquired. The shares of borrower company /\ncompany being acquired may  be accepted as additional security and not  as\nprimary security. The security charged to the banks should be marketable.\n(vi) Banks should ensure maintenance of stipulated margin at all times.\n(vii) The tenor of the bank loans may not be longer than seven years. However, the\nBoards of banks can make an exception in specific cases, where necessary, for\nfinancial viability of the project.\n(viii)  This financing would be subject to compliance with the statutory requirements\nunder Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation  Act, 1949.\n(ix) The banks financing acquisition of equity shares by promoters should be within\nthe regulatory ceiling of 5 per cent on capital market exposure in relation to its\ntotal outstanding advances (including commercial paper )  as on March 31 of the\nprevious year.\n(x) The proposal for bank finance should have the approval of the Board.\n4.  Appraisal\n(i) In respect of financing of infrastructure projects undertaken by Government\nowned entities, banks/Financial Institutions should undertake due diligence on the viability of\nthe projects. Banks should ensure that the individual components of financing and returns on\nthe project are well defined and assessed.  State Government guarantees may not be taken as\na substitute for satisfactory credit appraisal and such appraisal requirements should not be\ndiluted on the basis of any reported arrangement with the Reserve Bank of India or any bank\nfor regular standing instructions/periodic payment instructions for servicing the loans/bonds.\n(ii) Infrastructure projects are often financed through Special Purpose Vehicles. Financing\nof these projects would, therefore, call for special appraisal skills on the part of lending\nagencies.  Identification of various project risks, evaluation of risk mitigation through\nappraisal of project contracts and evaluation of creditworthiness of the contracting entities\nand their abilities to fulfil contractual obligations will be an integral part of the appraisal\nexercise.  In this connection, banks/ FIs may consider constituting appropriate screening\ncommittees/special cells for appraisal of credit proposals and monitoring the5\nprogress/performance of the projects.  Often, the size of the funding requirement would\nnecessitate joint financing by banks/ FIs or financing by more than one bank under\nconsortium or syndication arrangements. In such cases, participating banks/ FIs may, for the\npurpose of their own assessment, refer to the appraisal report prepared by the lead bank/FI or\nhave the project appraised jointly.\n5. Prudential  requirements\n5.1 Prudential credit exposure limits\nCredit exposure to borrowers belonging to a group may exceed the exposure norm of 40 per\ncent of the bank's capital funds by an additional 10 per cent ( i.e up to 50 per cent), provided\nthe additional credit exposure is on account of extension of credit to infrastructure projects.\nCredit exposure to single borrower may exceed the exposure norm of 15 per cent of the\nbank's capital funds by an additional 5 per cent (i.e. up to 20 per cent) provided the additional\ncredit exposure is on account of infrastructure as defined in paragraph 1 above.\n5.2 Assignment of risk weight for capital adequacy purposes\nBanks may assign a concessional risk weight of 50 per cent for capital adequacy purposes, on\ninvestment in securitised paper pertaining to an infrastructure facility subject to compliance\nwith the following :\na) The infrastructure facility should satisfy the conditions stipulated in paragraph 1\nabove.\nb) The infrastructure facility should be generating income/ cash flows which would\nensure servicing/ repayment of the securitised paper.\nc) The securitised paper should be rated at least 'AAA' by the rating agencies and the\nrating should be current and valid. The rating relied upon will be deemed to be current\nand  valid if  :\n(i) The  rating  is not more than one  month old on the date of opening of the\nissue, and the rating rationale from the rating agency is not more than one year\nold on the date of opening of the issue, and the rating letter and the rating\nrationale is a part of the offer document.\n(ii) In the case of secondary market acquisition, the 'AAA' rating of the issue\nshould be in force and confirmed from the monthly bulletin published by the\nrespective rating agency.\n(iii) The securitised paper should be a performing asset on the books of the\ninvesting/ lending institution.\n5.3 Asset - Liability Management\nThe long - term financing of infrastructure projects may lead to asset \u2013 liability mismatches,\nparticularly when such financing is not in conformity with the maturity profile of a bank\u2019s\nliabilities. Banks would, therefore, need to exercise due vigil on their asset-liability position\nto ensure that they do not run into liquidity mismatches on account of lending to such\nprojects.6\n6. Administrative arrangements\nTimely and adequate availability of credit is the pre-requisite for successful implementation\nof infrastructure projects. Banks/ FIs should, therefore, clearly delineate the procedure for\napproval of loan proposals and institute a suitable monitoring mechanism for reviewing\napplications pending beyond the specified period.  Multiplicity of appraisals by every\ninstitution involved in financing, leading to delays, has to be avoided and banks should be\nprepared to broadly accept technical parameters laid down by leading public financial\ninstitutions. Also, setting up a mechanism for an ongoing monitoring of the project\nimplementation will ensure that the credit disbursed is utilised for the purpose for which it\nwas sanctioned.\nAPPENDIX\nTake-out financing/liquidity support\na. Take-out financing arrangement\n      Take-out financing structure is essentially a mechanism designed to enable banks to avoid\nasset-liability maturity mismatches that may arise out of extending long tenor loans to\ninfrastructure projects. Under the arrangements, banks financing the infrastructure\nprojects will have an arrangement with IDFC or any other financial institution for\ntransferring to the latter the outstandings in their books on a pre-determined basis. IDFC\nand SBI have devised different take-out financing structures to suit the requirements of\nvarious banks, addressing issues such as liquidity, asset-liability mismatches, limited\navailability of project appraisal skills, etc. They have also developed a Model Agreement\nthat can be considered for use as a document for specific projects in conjunction with\nother project loan documents. The agreement between SBI and IDFC could provide a\nreference point for other banks to enter into somewhat similar arrangements with IDFC or\nother financial institutions.\nb. Liquidity support from IDFC\nAs an alternative to take-out financing structure, IDFC and SBI have devised a product,\nproviding liquidity support to banks. Under the scheme, IDFC would commit, at the point\nof sanction, to refinance the entire outstanding loan ( principal+unrecovered interest) or\npart of the loan, to the bank after an agreed period, say, five years. The credit risk on the\nproject will be taken by the bank concerned and not by IDFC. The bank would repay the\namount to IDFC with interest as per the terms agreed upon. Since IDFC would be taking\na credit risk on the bank, the interest rate to be charged by it on the amount refinanced\nwould depend on the IDFC\u2019s risk perception of the bank (in most of the cases, it may be\nclose to IDFC\u2019s PLR). The refinance support from IDFC would particularly benefit the\nbanks which have the requisite appraisal skills and the initial liquidity to fund the project.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/34218.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Feb 03, 2003", "info": "Implementation of Kimberley Process Certification\nScheme ( KPCS) on Conflict Diamonds\nIECD No.13/04.02.02/2002-03\nFebruary 3, 2003\nThe Chairmen/Chief Executives of\nall Commercial Banks\nDear Sir,\nImplementation of Kimberley Process Certification\nScheme ( KPCS) on Conflict Diamonds\nPlease refer to our circular IECD No.3/04.02.02/2001-02 dated August 30, 2001 regarding\nobtaining undertaking from all your clients who are being extended credit for doing any\nbusiness relating to diamonds.\n2.

The Committee observed that the perceptible results under\nthe scheme had not been actualised inter alia due to various reasons.\n1. Ignorance of the SGSY guidelines among the grass root level bank officials.\n2. Lack of awareness of instructions issued by the RBI at the operational level of bank\nbranches.\nIn this connection banks are advised that they may urgently initiate necessary action to ensure\nthat instructions issued by RBI percolate to the field level functionaries / bank branches. They\nmay take steps to create greater awareness of SGSY guidelines among the grass root level bank\nofficials. Further, the SGSY Committee meetings at different levels in the States/ UTs may be\norganised along with other similar committee meetings in the respective States/ UTs so as to\nensure the attendance of the bankers and Govt. officials at senior level.\nIn this context, we invite a reference to Para XVII of our circular RPCD.SP.BC.\n23/09.01.01/99-2000 dated 1 September 1999 ( Para 18 of SGSY Master circular dated 17\nAugust 2001) in terms of which banks are required to set up SGSY cells at Regional / Zonal\noffices to periodically monitor and review the flow of credit to SGSY swarozgaris. The nodal\nofficers are responsible for the smooth implementation of the programme by their bank\nbranches.  As decided in the CLCC meeting, we advise as under:\n1. Financing to sub groups of Self Help Groups ( SHGs)2\nIn cases where the size of the SHG is large (as in the case of Neigbourhood Groups ( NHGs)\nunder the Kudumbashree programme of Govt. of Kerala where a neighbour hood group can\ncomprise up to 40 members), banks have been expressing difficulty in extending finance to\nsuch large groups. Hence sub groups within the large group may be considered for financing by\nthe banks under the SGSY provided they (or the large group) have satisfied the required\ngrading criteria, possess all the characteristics of a viable and sustainable group and are found\ncreditworthy by the banks.\n2. Service Area Approach\nWe reiterate the instructions issued vide our circular RPCD.No. BC.117/08.01.00/95-96 dated\nApril 2, 1996 read with our circular RPCD.No. BC. 150/08.01.00-93/94 dated 24 May 1994,\nwherein it has been stated that if the Service Area branches do not issue \u2018No Dues Certificate\u2019\nwithin 15 days from the date of receipt of the application therefore, the borrower will be free to\napproach any other branch in the block for his credit requirements without production of \u2018No\nDues Certificate\u2019 from the concerned Service Area branch. The Service Area branches may be\ngrouped block wise without disturbing their Service Area identities or their obligation to\nprepare Village Credit Plans/ Service Area Plans so that borrowers will have the flexibility to\napproach other branches in a block in the event of inability of the concerned Service Area\nbranch to adequately meet their requirements. The primary responsibility for financing\nborrowers within the Service Area will be that of the concerned Service Area branch.\nBorrowers will first approach their Service Area branch for credit facilities and in the event of\nthe concerned Service Area branch not being in a position to finance them, it will be incumbent\non it to give a \u2018No Dues Certificate\u2019 to the concerned borrower who will, then, be free to\napproach any other branch in the block for credit support.\nBanks should follow these Service Area Approach guidelines scrupulously.\n3. Reporting recovery under SGSY\nPlease refer to Para 20 of our Master circular RPCD. No. SP.BC.14/09.01.01/2001-02 dated\nAugust 17, 2001 on submission of recovery statements under SGSY. There were reports of\nsome banks taking into consideration the recovery under IRDP also while reporting the\nrecovery under SGSY, which does not give a clear picture of the actual recovery position under\nSGSY. Banks, while calculating recovery under SGSY should not add the recovery under\nIRDP with that of SGSY. Recovery figures under the SGSY  should be maintained/ calculated3\nseparately. Further, within SGSY, advances and recovery of loans under group/ individual\nfinance should be maintained separately to get a proper feed back.\n4. SGSY Monitoring Committee- Field Visits\nA field visit had been taken up by the SGSY Monitoring Committee to Rae Bareli district of\nU.P in August 2002 which brought out certain areas of concern which need to be addressed for\nthe success of the programme. The report of the field visit is enclosed.\n5. Monitoring\nIn the CLCC meeting, it was pointed out that monitoring of progress under the scheme by the\nbanks was tardy which also contributed to poor performance.  Banks should therefore, gear up\ntheir machinery to ensure that the performance under the Scheme is stepped up in order to\nachieve the target   set for the financial year   without fail. The branches may be suitably\nadvised in this regard.\nPlease acknowledge receipt and advise us the action taken in the matter urgently.\nYours faithfully\nSd/-\n(Deepali Pant Joshi)\nGeneral Manager\nEncl. As above4\nAnnexure\nSGSY Monitoring Committee \u2013 Report\non field visits during August 2002-\nThe SGSY Monitoring Committee under the Chairmanship of Joint Secretary, Ministry of\nRural  Department, Govt. of India undertook field visits on August 19 and 20,2002 to Rae\nBareli District in the State of Uttar Pradesh   and also held meetings with bankers, State\nGovt. officials and NGOs, both at State and District level.  The U.P. State and the Rae Bareli\nDistrict were  chosen for the field visits in view of their poor performance under SGSY.  The\nCommittee also visited Bankers Institute for Rural Development, (BIRD) Lucknow on\nAugust 21,2002.  A brief report on the field visits is furnished below.\n2. Composition of the Monitoring Committee\nThe following Members of the Monitoring Committee participated in the field visits.\nName Designation\n1. Smt. Asha Swarup JS,MRD,GOI Chairperson\n2.

Officials from the Controlling offices of SBI & BOB were also present.\n3. Programme Schedule for the field visits\nThe programme schedule for the field visits of the Committee was finalised by the State\nGovt. in consultation with the Chairperson and is enclosed.  The Committee visited a few\nSHGs in Rae Bareli District in the forenoon of August 19,2002 and held a meeting with the\nbankers, govt. officials and NGOs at the District level in the afternoon.  On 20th, a meeting\nwith State Govt. officials, at the State and District level  including Chief Development\nOfficers of 15 Districts, controlling officials of major banks and NGOs was held in the\nforenoon and another meeting with Senior Govt. officials and bankers was held in the\nafternoon.  On 21st, the Committee visited  BIRD and interacted with the faculty and the\nparticipants of three training programmes.5\n4. Performance of State of Uttar Pradesh\nand Rae Bareli District under SGSY\nThe data on performance of the Uttar Pradesh State and Rae Bareli District under SGSY, as\nreported by the State Govt. and District authorities are enclosed.  It will be seen that till\n2001-2002, the assistance under the Scheme (in physical terms) flowed primarily to\nindividuals, contrary to the Scheme guidelines.  Group financing has since started and the\nCommittee was told that the State Govt. has decided not to allow individual financing from\nthe current year save in exceptional circumstances. Although the Scheme provides for `Credit\nMobilisation target\u2019 which is required to be allocated to all the participating banks viz.\ncommercial banks, RRBs and co-operatives by the SLBC and monitored both District- wise\nand bank-wise at the State and District level, it appeared that the State Govt. as also the\nDistrict/Block authorities are fixing physical targets  in terms of individuals/groups and\nmonitoring was done at the District level in terms of physical targets only .  The data on\ncredit mobilisation target vis-\u00e0-vis achievements was not available for the District Rae Bareli\nfor the year 2001-02.  Even the data provided at the State level with regard to the `financial\nprogress\u2019 did not match with the `credit mobilisation target\u2019 allocated to the State by the\nGOI.  Thus although under SGSY, the target is for `credit mobilisation\u2019, the State Govt. and\nthe banks did not seem to be aware of it/observing it.\nThe data on groups which have passed I & II grade revealed that there is a sizeable gap in\nsanction of Revolving Fund and Credit after the I & II Grading respectively.  While 39266\nand 998 Groups in the State & Rae Bareli District respectively had passed I grade, only\n19057 and 682 groups had received the Revolving Fund.  Similarly, out of 6810 and 107\nSHGs which had passed II grade in the State and Rae Bareli District, only 3650 and 26\nGroups respectively had received credit assistance.\n5. Visit to SGSY Beneficiaries\nIn the forenoon of August 19,2002, the Committee visited the following groups.\n(i) Swarojgar Sahayata Samuh, Village Sarai Chattardhar, Block Shivgarh (financed by\nRae Bareli Khetriya Gramin Bank)\n(ii) Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar Swayam Sahayata Samuh, Village Barjorkhare, Block\nShivgarh (financed by BOB)6\n(iii) Mahalaxmi Swayam Sahayata Samuh, Village Kanawa, Block Bachhrawan (financed\nby BOB)\n(iv) Maa Santhoshi Mahila Samuh, Village Kanara, Block Bachhrawan (financed by BOB\nOnly RF)\n(v) Alp Sankhyak Purush SHGs, Village Kanara, Block Bachhrawan (Not yet passed I\nGrade)\n(vi) Dr.B.R.Ambedkar Swayam Sahayata Samuh, Village Sarara, Block, Amava (financed\nby BOB)\n(vii) Shri Astik Baba Swayam Sahayata Samuh, Village Sarve, Block Amava, (yet to be\ngiven RF).\nAs at the end of July 2002, the number of individual beneficiaries financed under the Scheme\nin the District was 6053 as against which the number of Groups financed was 26 only.  One\nindividual beneficiary was also met in Kanava Village who was regular in repayment of\nloans.\nAll the groups visited by the Committee had been promoted by the Block level officials\nalthough 12 NGOs are reported to have formed 476 groups in the District.  Although, prima\nfacie, the groups appear to have been formed and functioning as per the guidelines, they\nseemed to lack group cohesiveness and synergy.  All the groups which have received credit\nhave taken up dairy activities, but on an individual basis i.e. each member with one buffalo\nand marketing the milk separately. In one or two groups, the RF amount (referred to as Cash\nCredit Loan \u2013 CCL) was also divided equally among all the members.  In one case, the entire\nCCL (including subsidy portion) was recovered/repaid while disbursing the credit.  In other\ncases, only the credit portion of RF (which carries interest) had been repaid, presumably as\nthe Groups had their own savings in the SB A/c.  In one women Group, except for one\nmember whose husband was the Pradhan, all were illiterate. In all the cases, the group\nmembers complained of unremunerative price for the milk as the villages did not fall within\nthe milk route, which indicated that while identifying the key activities ,\ninfrastructure/forward linkage had not been planned.  All the Groups confirmed that their\nincome level had gone up due to the activities undertaken.  According to the bankers, the\nrepayments were regular.  The groups had been given the loan passbooks and Savings\nAccount passbooks. According to some group members, the internal lending has helped them\nto meet the members\u2019 credit needs for economic activities, repayment of old debt etc., at a7\nlower interest cost (2% p.m.) as against 10% p.m. charged by the money lender.  Although\nall the members of the SHGs financed under SGSY which were visited by the Committee,\nclaimed to have been exposed to training, (Basic Orientation programme) at the Block level,\nthe training appears to have been confined to familiarisation with the Scheme objectives and\nthe responsibilities of the members.\n6. Meeting at the District Head quarters with\nthe Commissioner & Addl. Commissioner,\nRural Development, District Magistrate, CDO, Project\nDirector, DRDA, BDOs of various blocks in the District,\nLDM ,DDM,NABARD, Chairman,Gramin Bank,\nOfficials of major banks and NGOs\nDuring the captioned meeting, the NGOs and BDOs complained against the banks  for non-\ncooperation in the implementation of the programme and mentioned that\n(i) There was undue delay in Grading\n(ii) There was undue delay in disbursement of CCL/credit after grading.\n(iii) Members of the SHGs were asked to visit the bank branch several times which,\nbesides causing inconvenience to the members, discouraged them from taking up economic\nactivities under the Scheme.\nThe banks attributed the delay in financing to the weaknesses in the groups.  The project\nreports for the key activities did not seem to have prepared/approved by the District level\nSGSY Committee/ DRDA nor the balancing infrastructure identified.  The District level\nSGSY Committee, although claimed to have been constituted, was reported to be not meeting\nregularly as required.  Consequently, the utilisation  of infrastructure funds for purposes\nunconnected with key activities like computerisation of Block offices, was not known to the\nother implementing agencies including banks.  It also appeared that the target oriented\napproach had led to formation of groups interested only in the subsidy, affecting thereby  the\nquality of groups.  The lack of adequate manpower in the bank branches was cited as another\nreason for the poor performance of the Scheme in the District.  Incidentally, review of\nperformance vis-\u00e0-vis credit mobilisation target did not seem to be taking place, as there\nwas emphasis only on physical target.8\nThe Committee felt that lack of co-ordination among the implementing/facilitating agencies\nviz. banks, govt. officials and NGOs as also lack of appreciation and proper understanding of\nthe Scheme objectives by these agencies were hampering the progress of the Scheme in the\nDistrict.  The revitalisation of the Block and District level   SGSY Committees to ensure co-\nordination among  these agencies and also revitalisation  of all concerned through joint\ntraining programmes/workshops are required for effective implementation of the\nprogrammes.  The CDO mentioned that on receipt of revised Scheme guidelines he had\norganised training programme for all concerned, which however did not seem to have had the\ndesired effect.\n7. Meeting with the Senior officials of State Govt., CD\nand Project Directors of DRDAs of 15 districts, Lead Bank\n Managers, NGOs and representatives of major banks\nThe captioned meeting held by the Monitoring Committee at Lucknow on August 20,2002 in\nthe forenoon was attended by the Principal Secretary, Commissioner and Addl.\nCommissioner, Rural Development, Govt. of UP.During the discussions, the following\nobservations were made by the CDOs & NGOs.\n(i) Difficulty in group formation due to low literacy rate in the State, absence of\ntrust/understanding among members, Need for training the Group Members/President &\nTreasurer, Use of IEC funds for educating the members.\n(ii) Problem in opening of S.B.A/ cs. with banks by the Groups, delay in release of RF &\nsanction and disbursement of credit\n(iii) Cumbersome procedure in banks such as insistence on the presence of the Group\nmembers again and again at branch premises, production of photograph and no due\ncertificate in respect of all members.\n(iv) Non-involvement of bankers with the groups from the beginning, lack of knowledge of\nthe Scheme guidelines and lending procedures to Groups\n(v) Need for training the bank officials and also the other implementing officials of the govt.\n(vi) Absence of adequate delegation of powers to branch managers to finance groups.\n(vii) Stipulation of physical/financial targets under the Scheme leading to dilution of quality.\nThe banks responded as under:9\n(i) While there could be some lacunae in the implementation of  the Scheme by a few  banks,\nit should not be generalised.\n(ii) Delay in sanction of CCL is generally   due to absence of internal lending.\n(iii) Adequate powers have been delegated to branch managers.\n(iv) Cameras have been provided in SBI branches for taking the photographs, wherever\nnecessary.\n(v) As  the Scheme is implemented in rural areas with generally          only one bank branch,\nthe need for No Due Certificate should not arise.\n(vi) There was a need for  sensitising /training the bank officials, and the govt. agencies\ninvolved in the implementation of the Scheme.\n(vii) Need for encouraging diverse economic activities to ensure the viability of the projects\nundertaken by the Group.\n(viii) Co-ordination between the banks and govt. agencies necessary.\n(viiii) SHGs-bank linkage programme of NABARD was doing well in the State. Therefore,\nthe poor performance under SGSY is on account of certain deficiencies in the\nimplementation. Banks will not hesitate to lend to quality groups.\n(ix) The Steering Committee of SLBC has started monitoring the Scheme Bank-wise as also\nDistrict-wise.\n(x) Defective BPL list \u2013 Selection of beneficiaries not  done properly \u2013 More than one\nmember of a family was found in a Group or one person was a member of more than one\ngroup.\n(xi) Need to provide incentives to bank officials for good performance under poverty\nalleviation programmes. (Some banks  have already introduced it).\n(xii) During Non-Public Business Working Days branch managers visit the beneficiaries,\nControlling officials visiting branches also sometimes meet the groups.\n(xiii) As the groups are formed with the attraction of subsidy, they disintegrate soon.  The\nquality of groups suffer due to target oriented approach under the Scheme.\nThe conclusions emerging from the above discussions were as follows:\n(i) Need for sensitisation of all implementing agencies.\n(ii) Co-ordination to be promoted among the bankers and other agencies\n(iii) Banks to be involved from the stage of group formation   and should simplify\nthe procedure for lending to Groups  under the Scheme.\n(iv) Need for diversification of activities of the groups.10\n(v) Other govt. programmes for educating the illiterate masses       to be used for\neducating the member of SGSY groups.\n(vi) Banks to reduce the delays in disbursement of RF and credit, after I & II\ngrading respectively.\n(vii) The fora for monitoring the Scheme at the State/District/block level should\nbe made more effective.\nThe Chairperson of the Monitoring Committee emphasised the need for selecting skill based\nactivities for which the State was famous and to  ensure necessary forward/backward\nlinkages.  The utilisation of training funds was low in the State which needed to be stepped\nup. The revised guidelines provide flexibility to the State govts. for using the Scheme funds.\nThe promotion of quality groups should be ensured and there should be full involvement of\nthe banks and govt. officials in the implementation of the Scheme which should be looked\nupon as a mission.\n8. Meeting with the senior State level officials of\nthe Govt. and controlling heads of major banks\nin Uttar Pradesh\nDuring the above meeting held in the afternoon, the Chairperson of the Committee drew the\nfollowing action plan for the State Govt. and the banks to ensure better implementation of the\nScheme.\n(i) The State level SGSY Committee should regularly monitor the progress under\nthe Scheme.\n(ii) The block level and District level Monitoring fora under the SGSY should be\nreactivated.  CDO may also occasionally attend Block level meeting.\n(iii) Controlling officials of banks may, during their visit to branches, look into the\nposition of pending applications for RF/loan, and also see the availability of project reports in\na few  sanctioned cases.\n(iv) With a view to breaking the ice between banks and govt. agencies, joint\ntraining camps may be held.  Funds for the training may come from banks/ NABARD/ SGSY\nfund.  The training could be considered as state level special project under SGSY.  Banks\nshould be sensitised       to look upon lending to groups as a business opportunity.\n(v)  Training Institutes could be supported by SGSY funds.11\n(vi) Diversification of activities should be seriously considered and more efforts\nshould be put  for skill development.\n(vii) The benefits available under other govt. programmes may be brought to\nSGSY groups.\n(viii)  In the case of dairy activities, ear tagging etc. expenses    should be made free\nas under IRDP.\n9. Visit to BIRD, Lucknow\n During the above visit to BIRD in the forenoon of August 21,2002, the Committee met the\nfaculty and also the participants of three training programmes. The participants included\nofficials from DRDAs and other departments of some State Govts ., NGOs, officials from\nRRBs & LDMs from various parts of the country.  The feedback /suggestions received from\nthe above officials with regard to the SGSY Scheme based on their field level experience are\nas under:\n1. Gram Sabhas do not take place.  BPL lists are defective.  BPL lists are not made\navailable to bankers.\n2. There is delay in grading and lot of formalities are to be completed.\n3. Internal lending is important as the Group should first experiment with their own\nsavings. However, it is not given enough importance.  Banks are not involved in the grading.\nGrading should be done by trained officials.\n4. Turnover of CCL -  at least 1:2,- should be insisted before II Grading.\n5. The Scheme is perceived differently by the banks and Govt. officials.  Govt. is\nconcerned with target. Block level officials, therefore, prefer individual financial as group\nformation is slow and difficult.  Individual financing also takes place in States where groups\nare not yet formed/mature for financing.\n6. As SGSY Groups, unlike SHGs under Linkage programme, are formed to avail\nsubsidy, they disintegrate.  Target oriented approach leads to aberrations. Groups should be\nnurtured and only mature groups should be financed. Subsidy propaganda should stop and\ngovt. functionaries to be sensitised. In States like Kerala, there is a proliferation of SHGs and\nconsequently there is delay is release of subsidy, which leads to disintegration of the Groups.\n7. The format of Application Form for group financing should be advised to banks.\n8. Dairy activity is preferred by groups under SGSY to avail of maximum subsidy.\n9. Training and infrastructure to be given importance under the Scheme. To be\ncentralised/monitored at state level.\n10. Subsidy to an individual beneficiary in a Group should be given to the Group.12\n11. There should be no activity regimentation in a group.\n12.  Lock-in-period for adjustment of subsidy to be relaxed.\n13. Incentive should be given to both bankers and govt. officials for good performance\nunder the Scheme. Incentive to Govt. officials to be linked to sustainability of the Group.\n14. Two models of group financing viz. SHG bank linkage programme and SGSY are\nbeing tried in the same area.  While the former involves a long route, the latter has a short\nroute. Hence the quality of Groups under latter suffers.\n15. Instructions on adjustment of grant portion of Revolving Fund in case of\ndisintegration of SHG  needs to be clarified.\n16. RRBs are doing better in implementation of SGSY as, unlike commercial bank\nrural branch managers, the officials of RRBs are transferred within the same area and have\nfamiliarity with the rural population.\n17. There is an urgent need for co-ordination and convergence of the approaches of the\nbanks and govt. officials for effective implementation of the Scheme .\n18.  The role of NGO s needs to be defined.\n10. Conclusion\nThe field visits of the Monitoring Committee revealed that there is a need for\n(i) sensitising the bank officials and govt. officials on the objectives of the\nScheme  and modalities of implementation through joint training camps.\n(ii) Proper co-ordination among all the implementing agencies including NGOs\nthrough revitalisation of the Block/District/State level fora.\n(iii) Ensuring  quality of groups and involving banks at all stages including grading\nexercise.\n(iv) Emphasis on nurturing/training of the group members and exposure to success\nstories.\n(v) Diversification of activities and provision of forward and backward linkages\nthrough balancing infrastructure\n(vi) Simplification of the procedures and reducing the delay in release of RF and\nsanction and disbursement of credit after the Groups pass the I & II Grading respectively.\n(vii) Grant of suitable incentives to bankers for good performance.13\n(viii)  Convergence of other developmental programmes, particularly those relating\nto education/awareness, with SGSY, to improve the quality of lending to groups under\nSGSY.\nMost of the people, particularly bankers with whom the Committee interacted, were of the\nview that the target oriented approach (adopted by the govt. officials) as also the subsidy\noffered under the Scheme have led to dilution in the quality of groups formed under the\nScheme. The apprehension of many govt. officials that the groups will disintegrate due to\ndelay in disbursement of RF/Credit, reflected the quality of the Groups. The State Govt. did\nnot also seem to be utilising the infrastructure and training funds effectively.\nDuring the interactive sessions with the implementing agencies at various fora, the\nCommittee drew their attention to the objectives of the scheme as also the revised guidelines\nand underscored the need for sensitisation and close co-ordination among bankers, govt.\nofficials and NGOs , as also effective utilisation of the training and infrastructure funds.\nClarifications, wherever necessary, were also provided by the Committee members.  The\nChairperson exhorted the bankers and govt. officials to look upon the Scheme as a mission\nand implement it with total involvement.", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/34498.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jan 29, 2003", "info": "Risk Management Systems in Banks\nDBOD.No.BP.BC. 64/21.04.103/2002-03\nJanuary 29, 2003\nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(excluding RRBs and LABs)\nDear Sir,\nRisk Management Systems in Banks\nAs you are aware, the RBI guidelines on asset-liability management in banks were issued\nvide circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.8/ 21.04.098/ 99 dated February 10, 1999. These guidelines\nbroadly covered management of liquidity and interest rate risks by banks, prescribed the\nreporting systems for capturing the above two risks and also prescribed the prudential limits\nfor liquidity mismatches. Subsequently, the guidelines on risk management systems in banks\nwere issued by RBI vide circular DBOD.No. BP(SC).BC.98 /21.04.103/99 dated October 7,\n1999 to serve as a benchmark to banks which were yet to establish integrated risk\nmanagement system and covered management of credit risks, management of market risks\nand development of risk management structure.\n2. As a step towards further enhancing and fine-tuning risk management systems in banks,\ndraft Guidance Notes on Credit Risk Management and Market Risk Management were issued\nand placed on the RBI website for wider discussion among banks, financial institutions and\nother market participants. The Guidance Notes were based on the recommendations of two\nWorking Groups constituted in Reserve Bank of India drawing experts from banks and FIs.\nThe draft Guidance Notes were revised in the light of comments / feedback received from a\nwide spectrum of banks, financial institutions, rating agencies and other market participants\nand the revised Guidance Notes were issued vide DBOD.No. BP. 520/ 21.04.103 / 2002-03\ndated October 12, 2002, and banks were advised to use these Guidance Notes for upgrading\ntheir risk management systems. The revised Guidance Notes for management of credit risk\nand market risk were also placed on the RBI website for greater dissemination.\n3. With a view to involving banks in the process of transition to risk based supervision\n(RBS ), a discussion paper on \u201cMove towards Risk Based Supervision of banks\u201d was issued\nvide DBS.CO/RBS/58/36.01.002 dated 13th August 2001 to all commercial banks advising\nbanks to initiate action to prepare themselves for RBS  in five specific areas.

Since\nrisk based internal audit is an important component of the RBS process, guidelines on risk\nbased internal audit were issued to banks vide circular DBS. CO. PP. BC.10/ 11.01.005/\n2002-03 dated 27th December 2002.  On-site inspection of banks under Risk Based\nSupervision will initially be taken up by RBI shortly on a pilot basis and thereafter the\nprocess will be fine tuned and extended to all commercial banks on the basis of the\nexperience gained. With a view to enhancing the risk management functions in the banks and\ntheir preparedness for RBS, it will be necessary for banks to adapt their risk management\nsystems and put in place appropriate structures/ systems in tune with the above guidelines at\nthe earliest.2\n4. In this connection, it would also be pertinent to mention that the  proposed New capital\nadequacy framework aims at moving over to an enhanced level of risk sensitivity in the\ncapital allocation processes and captures all the major risks inherent in a bank\u2019s operations\nviz. credit risk, market risk and operational risk, and envisages enhancement of risk\nsensitivity with mutually reinforcing pillars which would collectively contribute to safety and\nsoundness of the financial system.\n5.  In the above background, with a view to moving over to integrated risk management\nsystems which would further equip banks to identify, measure, monitor and control the\nvarious types of risks assumed by them to ensure a smooth transition to the new capital\nadequacy framework, banks are advised to critically evaluate the risk management systems\nalready in place with reference to the above referred guidelines and guidance notes issued by\nRBI.  Banks should, in particular, ensure that their risk management framework is oriented\ntowards their requirements dictated by the size and complexity of business, risk philosophy,\nmarket perception and expected level of capital. The risk management systems should be\nadaptable to changes in business size, market dynamics and introduction of innovative\nproducts by banks in future.  As the primary responsibility of laying down risk parameters\nand establishing an integrated risk management and control system rests with the Board of\nDirectors, the note assessing the risk management systems should be placed before the Board.\nOn the basis of such evaluation banks should initiate appropriate steps, with the approval of\ntheir Board, to eliminate the gaps in compliance with the risk management guidelines issued\nby RBI and ensure that they have efficient and robust risk management systems in place.\n6.

A review of compromise settlements of NPAs through the above scheme has revealed that\nthe progress of recovery of NPAs through this mechanism has been moderate.  In\nconsultation with Government of India, it has been decided to give one more opportunity to\nthe borrowers to come forward for settlement of their outstanding dues.  Hence fresh\nguidelines are now issued, which will provide a simplified, non-discretionary and non-\ndiscriminatory mechanism for compromise settlement of chronic NPAs below the prescribed\nvalue ceiling.  All public sector banks should uniformly implement these guidelines, so that\nmaximum realisation of dues is achieved from the stock of NPAs within the stipulated time.\n3. The revised guidelines will cover NPAs (below the prescribed ceiling) relating to all\nsectors including the small sector. The guidelines will not, however, cover cases of wilful\ndefault, fraud and malfeasance.   The banks should identify cases of wilful default, fraud and\nmalfeasance and initiate prompt action against them. Accordingly, in modification of\nguidelines set out in our Circular of 27th July 2000, revised guidelines for compromise\nsettlement of dues relating to NPAs of public sector banks in all sectors are given below :\n(A) Guidelines for  compromise  settlement\n      of  chronic NPAs up to Rs. 10.00 crore\n[ i ] Coverage\na) The revised guidelines will cover all NPAs in all sectors irrespective of the nature of\nbusiness, which have become doubtful or loss  as on 31st March 2000 with outstanding\nbalance of Rs. 10.00 crore and below on the cut off date.\nb) The guidelines will also cover NPAs classified as sub-standard  as on 31st March 2000,\nwhich have subsequently become doubtful or loss.\nc) These guidelines will cover cases on which the banks have initiated action under the\nSecuritisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest2\nAct, 2002 and also cases pending before Courts / DRTs / BIFR, subject to consent decree\nbeing obtained from the Courts / DRTs / BIFR.\nd) Cases of wilful default, fraud and malfeasance will not be covered.\ne) The last date for receipt of applications from borrowers would be as at the close of\nbusiness on 30th April 2003.

In cases where the borrowers are unable to pay the entire amount in one lump\nsum, at least 25% of the amount of settlement should be paid upfront  and the balance amount\nof 75% should be recovered in instalments  within a period of one year together with interest\nat the existing Prime Lending Rate from the date of settlement up to the date of final\npayment.\n[ iv ] Sanctioning Authority\nThe decision on the compromise settlement and consequent sanction of waiver or remission\nor write-off should be taken by the competent authority under the delegated powers.\n[ v ] Non-discretionary treatment\nThe banks should follow the above guidelines for compromise settlement of all NPAs\ncovered under the revised scheme, without discrimination and a monthly report on the3\nprogress and details of settlements should be submitted by the concerned authority to the next\nhigher authority and their Central Office. Banks should go for wide publicity and also give\nnotice by 28th February 2003 to the eligible defaulting borrowers to avail of the opportunity\nfor one time settlement of their outstanding dues in terms of these guidelines.

Banks may be aware that in December 1999, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had constituted\na Working Group on Discounting of Bills by Banks under the Chairmanship of Shri K.R.\nRamamoorthy, Chairman, Vysya Bank Ltd. The Working Group had examined in detail the\nsuggestions of various banks, financial institutions and non-bank financial companies in\nregard to granting of freedom to banks in discounting of bills and banks evolving their own\nguidelines / safeguards for discounting of genuine trade bills. After considering the\nrecommendations of the Working Group, it has been decided that in supersession of our\nCircular DBOD No. BC. 8/16.13.100/92-93 dated July 27, 1992, banks may adhere to the\nfollowing guidelines while purchasing / discounting / negotiating / rediscounting of genuine\ncommercial / trade bills :\n(i) Since banks have already been given freedom to decide their own guidelines\nfor assessing / sanctioning working capital limits of borrowers, they may\nsanction working capital limit as also bills limit to borrowers after proper\nappraisal of their credit needs and in accordance with the loan policy as\napproved by their Board of Directors.\n(ii) Banks should clearly lay down a bills discounting policy approved by their\nBoard of Directors, which should be consistent with their policy of sanctioning\nof working capital limits. In this case, the procedure for Board approval should\ninclude banks\u2019 core operating process from the time the bills are tendered till\nthese are realised. Banks may review their core operating processes and\nsimplify the procedure in respect of bills financing. In order to address the oft-\ncited problem of delay in realisation of bills, banks may take advantage of\nimproved computer / communication network like Structured Financial2\nMessaging System ( SFMS) and adopt the system of \u2018value dating\u2019 of their\nclients\u2019 accounts.\n(iii) Banks should open letters of credit ( LCs) and purchase / discount / negotiate\nbills under LCs only in respect of genuine commercial and trade transactions\nof their borrower constituents who have been sanctioned regular credit\nfacilities by the banks. Banks should not, therefore, extend fund based\n(including bills financing) or non-fund based facilities like opening of LCs,\nproviding guarantees and acceptances to non-constituent borrower or / and\nnon-constituent member of a consortium / multiple banking arrangement.\n(iv) For the purpose of credit exposure, bills purchased / discounted / negotiated\nunder LCs or otherwise should be reckoned on the bank\u2019s borrower\nconstituent. Accordingly, the exposure should attract a risk weight appropriate\nto the borrower constituent ( viz; 100% for firms, individuals, corporates etc.)\nfor capital adequacy purposes.\n(v) While purchasing / discounting / negotiating bills under LCs or otherwise,\nbanks should establish genuineness of underlying transactions / documents.\n(vi) Banks should ensure that blank LC forms are kept in safe custody as in case of\nsecurity items like blank cheques, demand drafts etc. and verified / balanced\non daily basis. LC forms should be issued to customers under joint signatures\nof the bank\u2019s authorised officials.\n(vii) The practice of drawing bills of exchange claused \u2018without recourse\u2019 and\nissuing letters of credit bearing the legend \u2018without recourse\u2019 should be\ndiscouraged because such notations deprive the negotiating bank of the right\nof recourse it has against the drawer under the Negotiable Instruments Act.\nBanks should not therefore open LCs and purchase / discount / negotiate bills\nbearing the \u2018without recourse\u2019 clause.\n(viii) Accommodation bills should not be purchased / discounted / negotiated by\nbanks. The underlying trade transactions should be clearly identified and a\nproper record thereof maintained at the branches conducting the bills business.\n(ix) Banks should be circumspect while discounting bills drawn by front finance\ncompanies set up by large industrial groups on other group companies.\n(x) Bills rediscounts should be restricted to usance bills held by other banks.\nBanks should not rediscount bills earlier discounted by   non-bank financial3\ncompanies ( NBFCs) except in respect of bills arising from sale of light\ncommercial vehicles and two / three wheelers.\n(xi) Banks may exercise their commercial judgment in discounting of bills of\nservices sector. However, while discounting such bills, banks should ensure\nthat actual services are rendered and accommodation bills are not discounted.\nServices sector bills should not be eligible for rediscounting.

It had been stated therein that with effect from April 1, 2003:\na) the non-fund based exposures should also be reckoned at 100 per cent value, instead of at\n50 per cent, as prescribed earlier; and\nb) for determining the credit exposure to individual / group borrowers, the forward contracts\nin foreign exchange and other foreign exchange derivative products such as currency\nswaps, options, etc., should be included at their replacement cost in determining the\nindividual / group borrower exposures.\nThe methodology for arriving at the 'replacement cost' of the derivatives was to be\nadvised by us subsequently, which is as under.\nThere are two methods for measuring the credit risk exposure inherent in derivatives, as\ndescribed below.\nThe original exposure method\n2. Under this method, which is a simpler alternative,  the credit risk exposure of a derivative\nproduct is calculated at the beginning of the derivative transaction by multiplying the notional\nprincipal amount with the prescribed credit conversion factors.  The method, however, does not\ntake account of the ongoing market value of a derivative contract, which may vary over time. In\norder to arrive at the credit equivalent amount under this method, an FI should apply the\nfollowing credit conversion factors to the notional principal amounts of each instrument\naccording to the nature of the instrument and its original  maturity:\nCredit Conversion Factor to be applied to Notional\nPrincipal AmountOriginal  MaturityInterest Rate Contract Exchange Rate ContractLess than one year 0.5 % 2.0%\nOne year and less than two years 1.0% 5.0 % (2 % + 3 %)\nFor each additional year 1.0% 3.0 %\nThe current exposure method\n3. Under this method, the credit risk exposure / credit equivalent am ount of the derivative\nproducts is computed periodically on the basis of the market value of the product to arrive at its\ncurrent replacement cost. Thus, the credit equivalent of the off-balance sheet interest rate and\nexchange rate instruments would be the sum of the following two components:\n(a) the total 'replacement cost'  - obtained by \"marking-to-market\" of all the\ncontracts with positive value (i.e. when the FI has to receive money from the\ncounterparty); and\n(b) an amount for ' potential future exposure'  - calculated by multiplying the total\nnotional principal amount of the contract by the following credit conversion\nfactors according to the residual maturity of the contract:\nConversion Factor to be applied on Notional Principal Amount\nResidual Maturity Interest Rate Contract Exchange Rate Contract\nLess than one year Nil 1.0 %\nOne year and over 0.5% 5.0 %\n3.1 Under the current exposure method, the FIs should mark to market the derivative\nproducts at least on a monthly basis  and they may follow their internal methods for determining\nthe marked-to-market value of the derivative products. However, the FIs would not be required\nto calculate potential credit exposure for single currency floating / floating interest rate swaps .\nThe credit exposure on these contracts would be evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-\nmarket value.\n4. The FIs are encouraged to follow, with effect from April 1, 2003, the Current Exposure\nMethod , which is an accurate method of measuring credit exposure in a derivative product, for\ndetermining individual / group borrower exposures. In case an FI is not in a position to adopt the\nCurrent Exposure Method, it may follow the Original Exposure Method.  However, its\nendeavour should be to move over to Current Exposure Method in course of time.\n5. Under the extant capital adequacy norms, the credit exposure of the FIs in derivative\nproducts also gets reflected in the risk-weighted value of the off-balance sheet items in the\nCRAR computation, for which the 'original exposure method' has been prescribed in terms of our\nCircular FIC. Nos.842/01.02.00/93-94 dated March 29, 1994 addressed to the term lendinginstitutions and 641/01.02.00/95-96 dated March 7, 1996 addressed to the refinancing\ninstitutions.  The FIs are, however, encouraged to adopt, with effect from April 1, 2003, the\nCurrent Exposure Method for computation of CRAR also, subject to the stipulations of para 4\nabove.\n6.

This facility of trading of government securities on the stock\nexchanges would be available to banks in addition to the present NDS of the Reserve\nBank, which will continue to remain in place.\n2. Accordingly, with effect from January 16, 2003, trading of dated Government of\nIndia ( GOI) securities in dematerialized form is being allowed on automated order\ndriven system of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), The Stock Exchange, Mumbai\n(BSE) and Over the Counter Exchange of India ( OTCEI). The scheme will\nsubsequently be extended to GOI treasury bills and State Government securities.\n3. In view of the familiarity of the market and its participants with the systems,\nprocesses and procedures it has been decided to adopt the equity trading model for\ntrading of Government securities on the exchanges. The trading facility on the above\nstock exchanges is in addition to the present system of trading in government\nsecurities. Being a parallel system, the trades concluded on the exchanges will be\ncleared by their respective clearing corporations/clearing houses. The trades of banks\nhave to be settled either directly with clearing corporation/clearing house (in case they\nare clearing members) or else through a clearing member custodian.\n4.  As in the case of equities, banks as institutional investors, can undertake\ntransactions only on the basis of giving and taking delivery of securities.2\n5.  With a view to facilitating participation on the Stock Exchanges within the\nregulations prescribed by RBI, SEBI and the exchanges, banks are being extended the\nfollowing facilities:\n (i) Open demat accounts with a depository participant (DP) of NSDL/ CDSL in\naddition to their SGL/ CSGL accounts with RBI.\n(ii) Value free transfer of securities between SGL/ CSGL and demat accounts is being\nenabled at Public Debt Office ( PDO), Mumbai, subject to operational guidelines\nbeing issued by our Department of Government and Bank Accounts ( DGBA)\nseparately.\n6.  The balances in government securities maintained by the banks in the depositories\nwill be included for SLR purpose.  Also, any shortfall in maintenance of CRR/ SLR\nresulting from settlement failure (on either the NDS-OTC market or the stock\nexchanges) will attract the usual penalties.\n7. Banks should take specific approval from their Board to enable them to trade in the\nStock Exchanges and should frame and implement a suitable policy to ensure that\noperations in securities on the above stock exchanges are conducted in accordance\nwith the norms laid down by RBI/ SEBI  and the respective stock exchange.\nOperational guidelines:\n8. Banks should put in place appropriate internal control systems catering to stock\nexchange trading/settlement. The back office arrangement should be such that trading\non the NDS/OTC market and on the stock exchanges can be tracked easily for\nsettlement/reconciliation. Banks should, therefore, install enabling IT infrastructure\nand adequate risk management systems.\n9. The trades done through any single broker will be subjected to the current\nguidelines on transactions done through brokers.\n10. Brokers/trading members shall not be involved in the settlement process; all trades\nhave to be settled either directly with clearing corporation/clearing house (in case they\nare clearing members) or else through clearing member custodians.\n11. At the time of trade, securities must be available with the banks either in their\nSGL or in the demat account with depositories. Any sale on T+3 basis on the Stock3\nExchanges cannot be covered by a purchase on the NDS/OTC market (even on T+0)\nand subsequent transfer from SGL account to their demat account for effecting\ndeliveries. Similarly, no sale is permitted on NDS/OTC on T+0 against pay-in of\nsecurities expected on T+0 on the Stock Exchanges.  Further, the purchase\ntransactions by banks should similarly be  subject to availability of clear funds in their\nsettlement accounts at the time of pay-in.\n12. Any settlement failure on account of non-delivery of securities/ non-availability of\nclear funds will be treated as SGL bouncing and the current penalties in respect of\nSGL bouncing will be applicable. Stock Exchanges will report such failures to the\nrespective Public Debt Offices.\n13. The settlement banks should ensure that all pay-out of funds must necessarily be\nclear funds, i.e. the pay-out must not be contingent upon the outcome of any clearing\nto be conducted on that day. Therefore, either the clients must provide clear funds in\ntheir accounts or the bank may provide credit subject to the usual credit appraisal and\nfixing of prudential limits.\n14. Banks should report on weekly basis to their Audit Committee of the Board,\ngiving the details of trades on aggregate basis done on the Stock Exchanges and\ndetails of any \"closed-out\" transactions on the exchanges.\n15. Banks should generally follow the guidelines on internal control system ( para II),\nand Audit, Review and Reporting ( para V) as advised vide our circular FSC.

Scope : With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of\nGovernment securities it is proposed to allow participation on \u201c non-competitive \u201d basis in\nselect  auctions of dated Government of India securities. Accordingly, non-competitive\nbids up to 5 percent  of the notified amount will be accepted in the auctions of dated\nsecurities. The reserved amount will be within the notified amount.\nII. Eligibility: Participation on a non-competitive basis in the auctions of dated GOI\nsecurities will be open to investors who satisfy the following:\n1. do not maintain current account (CA) or Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL) account\nwith the Reserve Bank of India.\nExceptions : Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs), Urban Cooperative Banks ( UCBs) and Non-\nbanking Financial Companies ( NBFCs) shall be covered under this Scheme in view of\ntheir statutory obligations.\n2. make a single  bid for an amount not more than Rs.one crore (face value) per\nauction\na. submit their bid indirectly  through any  one bank or PD offering this scheme.\nExceptions: Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs), Urban Cooperative Banks ( UCBs) and Non-\nbanking Financial Companies ( NBFCs) shall be eligible to submit their non competitive\nbids directly.\nIII. Coverage : Subject to the conditions mentioned above, participation on \u201cnon-\ncompetitive\u201d basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by RBI.\nThe minimum amount for bidding will be Rs.10 ,000 (face value) and thereafter in\nmultiples in Rs.10,000 as hitherto for dated stocks.\nIV. Other Operational Guidelines:\n1. It will not be mandatory for the retail investor to maintain a constituent subsidiary\ngeneral ledger ( CSGL) account with the bank or PD through whom they wish to\nparticipate. However, an investor can make only a single bid under this scheme. An\nundertaking to the effect that the investor is making only a single bid will have to be\nobtained and kept on record by the bank or PD.\n2. Each bank or PD on the basis of firm orders submit a single customer bid  for the\naggregate amount on the day of the auction. Details of individual customers viz. name,\namount, etc shall be provided as an Annexure to the bid.\n3. Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the\nweighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the\ncompetitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on\nthe date of issue irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from their\nclients.\n4. In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5% of\nnotified amount), pro rata allotment would be made. In case of partial allotments, it will\nbe the responsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients\nin a transparent manner.5. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserve d amount, the\nshortfall will be taken to competitive portion.\n6. Security would be issued only in SGL  form by RBI. RBI would credit either the\nmain SGL account or the CSGL account of the bank or PD as indicated by them. The\nfacility for affording credit to the main SGL account is for the sole purpose of servicing\ninvestors who are not their constituents. Therefore, the bank or PD would have to indicate\nclearly at the time of tendering the non-competitive bids the amounts ( face value ) to be\ncredited to their SGL account and the CSGL account. Delivery in physical form from the\nmain SGL account is permissible at the instance of the investor subsequently.\n7. It will be the responsibility of the bank or the PD to pass on the securities to their\nclients. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the transfer of securities to the clients\nshall be completed within five working days from the date of issue.\n8. The bank or PD can recover upto six paise per Rs.100 as\nbrokerage/commission/service charges for rendering this service to their clients. Such\ncosts may be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. In case the\ntransfer of securities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the security, the\nconsideration amount payable by the client to the bank or PD would also include accrued\ninterest from the date of issue.\n9. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities,\naccrued interest wherever applicable and brokerage/commission/service charges may be\nworked out by the bank or PD as per agreement with the client.
