In view of the Prime \nMinister\u2019s 15 -Point Program for the Welfare of Minorities, at least 15 \npercent of the physical and financial targets under this component \nshall be earmar ked for the minority communities.  \n \n2. Selection of Beneficiary & Procedure for Sponsoring Applications:  \nThe Community Organizers (COs) and professionals from Urban Local \nBody (ULB) will identify the prospective beneficiaries from among the urban \npoor. The community structures formed under Social Mobilization & \nInstitutional Development (SM&ID) component of DAY - NULM viz. Self \nHelp Groups (SHGs) and Area Level Federations (ALFs) may also refer \nprospective individual and group entrepreneurs for purpose of financial assistance under SEP to ULB. The beneficiaries may directly approach \nULB or its representatives for assistance.  Banks may also identify \nprospective beneficiaries at their end and forward such cases directly to ULB. The Banks  may also use their empan eled Business Correspondents \n(BCs) and Business Facilitators (BFs) to increase the outreach. Due  \ndiligence wil l be undertaken as per the Banks\u2019 policy, in this regard.   \n \n2.1 The application for individual and group enterprise loans will be \nsponsored by the Urban Local Body (ULB) which will be the sponsoring agency for the individual and group enterprise.  \n \n2.2 The ULB will create awareness regarding SEP to the prospective \nbeneficiaries through mass media campaigns, Information Education \nand Communication (IEC) activities, adv ertisements in local \nnewspapers, City Livelihoods Centres (CLCs) etc. The ULB may also disseminate information regarding this component through active \ninvolvement of Resource Organizations and its field staff.  \n \n2.3 The beneficiaries desirous of seeking financial assistance for setting up \nan enterprise can submit an application of intent to the concerned ULB officials on a plain paper with basic details viz:  Name, Age, Contact    \n4 \n details, Address, Aadhaar details (if any), amount of loan required, \nbank account number (if available), type of enterprise/ activity, category \netc. The intent could also be sent by mail /post to the ULB office. The \nULB shall accept suc h intents throughout the year.  \n \n2.4 The community structures formed under Social Mobilization & \nInstitutional Development (SM&ID) component of DAY -NULM viz: Self \nHelp Groups (SHGs)/ Area Level Federations (ALFs) may also refer \nprospective individual and gr oup entrepreneurs for purpose of financial \nassistance under SEP to ULB.  \n \n2.5 On submission/receipt of the intent from the beneficiary the respective \nULB will enter the details in a register/or MIS if available and hence will generate a waiting list of beneficiaries. The ULB will issue an \nacknowledgement to the beneficiary with a unique registration number, \nwhich may be used as a reference number for tracking the status of \napplication.  \n \n2.6 ULB will call the beneficiaries in order of the waiting list to complete \nrequisite documentation including filling of Loan Application Form (LAF), activity details, identity proof, address proof, bank account \ndetails etc. To verify the identity of the beneficiary, her/his Aadhar \nnumber will also be brought on record. If beneficiary does not have \nAadhaar card, his/ her any other unique identification document like \nvoters\u2019 card, driving license etc. will be taken and s/he will be helped to obtain Aadhar card as soon as possible. The State Urban Livelihoods \nMission (SULM)  may develop a Loan Application Form (LAF) in \nsuitable format in consultation with State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) convenor bank. The same LAF may be utilised across the \nState/UTs. The Loan Application Form (LAF) will contain basic data in \nrespect of economic status of the beneficiary and her/his family. This \ndata will be such that it can be used to analyse impact of the benefits \non her/his economic status at a later stage.  \n \n2.7 A Task Force constituted at ULB level will scrutinize the applications \nbased on experience, skills, viability of activity, scope of the activity etc. \nThereafter, the Task Force will shortlist the applications and call for \ninterview of the applicants before recommending or rejecting the \napplication or call for additional information f rom the applicant if \nrequired.  \n \n2.8 The Chief Executive Officer (CEO)/ Municipal Commissioner of ULB will \nbe responsible to constitute the Task Force and will be the Chairman of the Task force. There could be more than 1 task force at ULB level \ndepending upon the size/population of the ULB.     \n5 \n  \n \n2.9 The indicative composition of the Task Force is as follows:  \n \nSr.  \nNo. TASK Force at ULB level  Role  \n1. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) ULB/Municipal \nCommissioner of ULB/ or any representative \nauthorized by CEO ULB  Chairman  \n2. Lead District Manager (LDM)  Member  \n3. City Project Officer (CPO), ULB/ or any authorized \nrepresentative of ULB  Member \nConvenor  \n4. Representative from District Industries Centre (DIC)  Member  \n5. Senior Branch Managers (Max -2) of banks  Member  \n6. Representatives(2) of Area Level Federation/City \nLevel Federation Member  \n \n2.10 The task force will then recommend the applications if found suitable, \nreject if found unsuitable or ask the beneficiary to submit further \nrequisite information for re- examination on case to case basis.  \n \n2.11 The case duly recommended by the task force wi ll be forwarded by \nthe ULB to the concerned banks for further processing. Such cases recommended by task force have to be processed by concerned \nbanks within a time frame of 15 days. As these cases are already \nrecommended by the task force, such cases should be rejected by \nbanks only in exceptional circumstances.  \n \n2.12 The banks will send a periodic report to the ULB on the status of the \napplications received. In case of MIS being used, the banks may be allowed to update the status of application online in addition to \nmanual report.  \n \n2.13 Banks may also directly accept the loan applications of urban poor \nbeneficiaries on the basis of relevant documents as per the guidelines \nof Prime Minister MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) or any other such scheme \nwithout the need of having prior sponsoring from ULB . The banks can \nsend details of such loans sanctioned by them to ULBs for confirmation of their eligibility for interest subsidy under DAY -NULM. \nTask Force constituted for scrutinizing applications should quickly clear these applications if they otherwise meet the criteria. On \nconfirmation of their eligibility, interest subsidy may be claimed from \nULBs on the pattern of interest subsidy claim for beneficiaries \nsponsored by ULBs . The subsidy will be transferred directly to the    \n6 \n loan account of DAY -NULM beneficiaries. This procedure will also be \ndirect  benefit transfer compl iant.  \n3. Educational Qualifications and Training Requirement:  \n    No minimum e ducational qualification is required for prospective \nbeneficiaries under this component. However where the identified activity \nfor micro -enterprise development requires some special skills appropriate \ntraining must be provided to the beneficiaries before extending financial \nsupport . \n3.1 Employment through Skills Training and Placement (EST&P):  \nFinancial assistance should be extended only after the prospective \nbeneficiary has acquired required skills for running the proposed \nmicro -enterprise. Such training may not be necessary if the \nbeneficiary has already undergone training from a known institution, \nregistered NGO/Voluntary Organization or trained under any \ngovernment scheme provided requisite certificate is produced. In \ncase the beneficiary has acquired requi site skills from family \noccupation such cases should be certified by the ULB before extending financial assistance.  \n \n3.2 Entrepreneurship Development Program (EDP): In addition to \nskill training of the beneficiaries, the ULB will also arrange to conduct \nEntrepreneurship Development Program for 3- 7 days for individual \nand group entrepreneurs. The EDP will cover basics of entrepreneurship development such as management of an enterprise, basic accounting, financial management, marketing, \nbackward and forward linka ges, legal procedures, costing and \nrevenue etc. In addition to above topics the module should also include group dynamics, allocation of work, profit sharing \nmechanism etc. for group enterprises.  \n \n3.3 The EDP module may be developed and finalized by State Urba n \nLivelihoods Mission (SULM) supported by State Mission Management Unit (SMMU) with assistance of an empaneled \ninstitution/agency or consulting firm and same may be utilized for \nconducting training program by the ULB. This EDP training may be \narranged through institutions such as Rural Self Employment \nTraining Institutes (RSETI), reputed institutions engaged in \nentrepreneurship development/ training, management/ educational \ninstitutes,  reputed NGOs  engaged in entrepreneurship \ndevelopment/ training etc.  \n    \n7 \n 3.4 Follow -up entrepreneurial support to Individual and Group \nentrepreneurs:    After financing to Individual and Group \nbeneficiaries, the ULB will also arrange to conduct follow -up \nEntrepreneurship Development Programme (EDP) as and when \nrequired. Such program me should preferably be conducted once in \nsix months for each beneficiary who has been given a loan.  During \nthe follow -up EDP, problems and issues faced by beneficiaries \nshould also be discussed and solutions should be given.   \n \n4. Pattern of Financial Assi stance:   \nThe financial assistance available to urban poor in setting up individual and \ngroup enterprises will be in the form of Interest subsidy on the bank loans. \nInterest subsidy, over and above 7% rate of interest will be available on a \nbank loan for setting up of individual or group enterprises. The difference \nbetween 7% p.a. and the rate of interest charged by the bank will be \nprovided to banks under DAY -NULM. Interest subsidy will be given only in \ncase of timely repayment of loan. Suitable certificati on from banks will be \nobtained in this regard. An additional 3 percent interest subvention will be \nprovided to all Women Self Help Groups (WSHGs) who repay their loan in \ntime. The Interest subsidy will be subject to timely repayment of the loan \n(as per the loan repayment schedule) and suitable certification obtained \nfrom banks by the ULB. The additional 3% interest subvention amount will be reimbursed to the eligible WSHGs. The banks should credit the amount \nof 3% interest subvention to the eligible WHSGs accounts and thereafter seek the reimbursement.  \n \n5. Procedure for interest subsidy to Banks:  \n5.1 All sch eduled commercial banks (SCBs)  and Small Finance Banks  \nwhich are on the Core Banking Solution (CBS) platform would be \neligible for getting interest subvention under the scheme.  \n \n5.2 After disbursement of loan to the beneficiaries, the concerned \nbranch of the bank will send details of disbursed loan cases to ULB \nalong with details of interest subsidy amount.  \nProcedure I  \n \n5.3 The settlement of claims made by banks would be done on quarterly basis by the ULBs, however the submission of claims should be \nmonthly. The ULB will check the data at their end and will release the interest subsidy amount (difference between 7% p.a. and \nprevailing rate of interest) to the banks.  \n    \n8 \n 5.4 A prescribed format for interest subsidy claims for loans  under this \ncomponent is enclosed at ( Annex -I) \n \n5.5 The claims should not be pending more than a quarter. In case the \nclaims of the banks are not settled for a period of 6 months, SLBC is \nempowered to stop the scheme temporarily in selected cities subject \nto clearance of claims by such ULBs. In such eventualities, the \nclaims settlement should prospectively be given to the Lead District \nBank.  \n \nProcedure - II \n \n5.6 Settlement  of Claims: Nodal Agency for releasing interest \nsubsidy:  A public sector bank may be engaged by each State as \nnodal bank in consultation with the convener of the respective \nState Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC).  All the Banks will \nconsolidate data regarding interest subsidy from their branches \nand upload on the portal of Nodal Bank. The nodal bank, after \nverification, will transfer the interest subsidy to the bank branches.  \nThe State/UT will deposit some funds in advance with the nodal \nbank, which will release funds to the bank branches as per guidelines of the DAY -NULM. Nodal bank will regularly render \naccount of reimbursement to the SULM. This procedure will be followed in all three types of loans i.e. SEP (I), SEP (G) and SHG -\nBank Linkage.  \n \n6.

SHG -Bank Linkage \u2013  General Guidelines \nLinking of SHGs with banks have been emphasized in the Monetary policy \nof Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget announcements from time to \ntime and various guidelines in this regard have been issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to banks. To scale up the SHGs l inkage program and \nmake it sustainable, banks have been advised to consider lending to SHGs \nas part of their mainstream credit operations both at policy and \nimplementation level.  \n \n8.1 Master Circular of RBI on SHG- Bank Linkage Programme, \nFIDD.FID.BC. No.04/12.01.033/2018- 19 dated July 02, 2018  contains \ninstructions on opening of Savings Bank Account of Self Help Groups \n(whether registered or unregistered), which are engaged in promoting \nhabit of savings among their members as a starting point. Thereafter, \nthe SHGs may be sanctioned Savings Link ed Loans (varying from a \nsaving to loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4) after due assessment or grading by banks. However, in case of matured SHGs, loans may be given \nbeyond the limit of four times the savings as per the discretion of the \nbank.  The Banks have also be en instructed that the advances to \nSHGs irrespective of the purposes for which the members of SHGs    \n11 \n should be included by the banks as part of their lending to the weaker \nsections.  \n \n8.2 Under Social Mobilization & Institution Development (SM&ID) \ncomponent of DAY- NULM, the ULB will do necessary groundwork to \nopen bank accounts for SHGs and facilitating access to Revolving \nFund (RF). The ULB may also engage Resource Organization (RO) \nfor the purpose or may directly facilitate SHGs through its staff. \n(Concept &  Formation of SHGs, ROs and Revolving Fund has been \ndetailed out in Social Mobilization & Institutional Development (SM&ID) component of DAY - NULM).  \n 8.3 The banks will send the details of disbursed loan cases to the ULB \nalong with the calculation details of the interest subsidy amount. The \nULB will check  the data at their end and will release the inter est \nsubsidy amount on quarterly  basis to the banks following a similar \nprocedure as mentioned in Para 5.The prescribed format for claiming \nthe additional i nterest subvention is enclosed at ( Annex \u2013II\n). \n \n8.4 The ULB through its field staff or Resource Organization (ROs) will \nfacilitate filling of loan applications for eligible SHGs to access credit from the banks. The ULB will be responsible to forward the Loan \napplication of the SHGs to the concerned banks with requisite \ndocumentation. The ULB will maintain area wise, bank -wise, ROs/ \nStaff wise data of SHGs loan applications forwarded to the banks. The same will be sent to SULM on a monthly basis.  \n \n8.5 In order to ensure effective SHG -Bank Linkage under DAY -NULM, the \nSULM will monitor and review the progress with banks on regular \nbasis and co- ordinate with SLBC for interest subsidy/ subvention on \nSHG Loans in the state. Active involvement of State level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) and lead banks may be ensured for sensitization \nof bank and branch staff for financial inclusion of urban poor.  \n \n8.6 It may be noted that the identification, selection, formation and \nmonitoring of SHGs who are to get interest subvention would be the responsibility of State/ ULBs and banks would not be liable for wrong \nidentification of SHGs who get interest subvention.  \n \n8.7 Type of Loan Facility: SHGs can avail either Term loan or a Cash \nCredit Limit (CCL) lo an or both based on their needs. In case of need, \nadditional loan can be sanctioned even though the previous loan is \noutstanding.  \n \n8.8 RBI guidelines for prompt repayment are as follows:     \n12 \n a. For Cash Credit Limit to SHGs:  \ni) Outstanding balance shall not have remained in excess of the \nsanctioned limit/drawing power continuously for more than 30 \ndays.  \n \nii) There sh all be regular credits and debits in the account. In any \ncase there shall be at least one customer induced credit during the month.  \n \niii) Customer in duced Credits during a month shall be sufficient to \ncover the interest debited during the month.  \n \nb. For Term Loan to SHGs: A term loan account where all of the \ninterest payments and/or instalments of principal were paid within 30 \ndays of the due date during the entire tenure of the loans would be \nconsidered as an account having prompt payment.  The prompt \npayment guidelines will continue to be guided by RBI guidelines on \nthe subject in future.  \n 9. Progress Reporting for SEP -I, SEP-G & SEP- SHG  \n9.1 The ULB will prepare a data sheet of the applications recommended by \nthe TASK force along with their status details of the sanction, \ndisbursement and rejection (along with reasons) after validating the \nsame with the respective banks. This data sheet will be sent t o SULM \non a monthly basis.  \n \n9.2 The SULM will compile all the reports received from respective ULBs \nand will communicate to M/o HUPA on a monthly basis.  \n 9.3 SULM must ensure that progress under SEP is reviewed in every SLBC \nand District Consultative Commi ttee (DCC) meetings. Any other \nimportant issue with regard to SEP may be taken up by SULM with \nSLBC convener bank for effective coordination and implementation.  \n10. Credit Card for enterprise development  \n10.1 The financial assistance to the individual entrepreneurs though subsidized loan for setting up of enterprises under DAY -NULM could \nbe viewed as initial impetus to facilitate livelihood support to the \nurban poor. However the individual entrepreneurs require further \nfinancial support in terms of working capital to make the enterprise economically sustainable. This may include immediate and short term monthly requirement of cash for meeting expenses for \npurchase of goods, raw materials and other miscellaneous \nexpenditures etc. The micro- entrepreneur does not have a regular    \n13 \n fixed monthly cash inflow/income to meet expenses arising out of \nentrepreneurial activities. To approach a financial institution for such \nimmediate credit requirement, it requires procedural documentation \nand consumes a lot of time. This need for working capital credit is \ngenerally met from informal sources of credit (including money \nlenders) which is typically available at high rate of interest.  \n \n10.2 In order to support the micro- entrepreneurs to meet their working \ncapital and miscellaneous credit needs, DAY -NULM will facilitate \naccess to  Credit Cards  or MUDRA Card through banks.  \n \n10.3 The SULM in consultation with the State Level Bankers Committee \n(SLBC) will finalize the norms, limits and specifications for issuance \nof Credit  Card (or) MUDRA Card to the individual entrepreneurs. The \nGeneral Credit Card Scheme (GCC), which is being impl emented by \nall scheduled commercial banks or any other variant of credit cards \nfor enterprise development of banks in urban areas, may be \nexplored by SULM and SLBC for the same. The Circular on revised \nGCC scheme has been issued by RBI notification vide \nRPCD.MSME& NFS.BC.No.61/06.02.31/2013- 14 dated December \n02, 2013  available on RBI web- site \u2018 www.rbi.org.in \u2019. \n \n10.4 The ULB will identify the prospective beneficiaries and will facilitate linkages with banks for issuance of credit cards. The focus is to \ninitially facilitate issuance of credit card to cover all the beneficiaries \nwho have availed financial assistance under SEP.  Additionally,  other  \nbeneficiaries who are running their own business but have not availed assistance under SEP may also be covered if they satisfy \nthe norms of issuance of credit cards.  \n \n10.5 The targets for the same may be decided at ULB level and the \nprogress under this component is aggregated at SULM level and \ncommunicated to M/o HUPA periodically.  \n \n11. Technology, Marketing and Other Support  \n \n11.1 Micro entrepreneurs often need support in order to grow and sustain \ntheir businesses. Support needed may be for establishment, \ntechnology, marketing, and other services. Micro entrepreneurs who run very small businesses may need to gain a better understanding \nof what the market needs, demand of the products produced by \nthem, prices, where to sell, etc. Support services under this    \n14 \n component are envisaged with a view to provide an encouraging \nenvironment for development of micro enterprises.  \n \n11.2 The City Livelih oods Centers (CLCs) established under DAY -NULM \nwill offer services to the micro- enterprises such as in establishment \n(licenses, certificates registration, legal services etc.), production, \nprocurement, technology, processing, marketing, sales, packaging, \naccounting etc. for long term sustainability. CLC s will also provide \nsupport in taking up feasibility/ assessment studies on market demand and market strategy for products and services of micro-\nenterprises.  \n \n11.3 All SEP individual and groups enterprises can avail the services from \nCLCs as per the norms of CLCs. The CLCs with support of ULB may \nalso tie up with various other government schemes which offer \nservices and benefits for micro- enterprise development for the \nbenefit of prospective beneficiaries.  \n \n11.4 The SULM may arrange for additional funds/professional assistance \nfor the purpose of providing above services to CLCs.  \n \n12. Funding Pattern of SEP of DAY -NULM  \n12.1 Funding under this component will be shared between the Centre \nand the States as per the general norms under DAY- NULM.  \n \n12.2 The Ministry will allocate funds to the states on annual basis based \non the targets assigned to the states. The states in consultation with \nthe respective SLBCs and ULBs will decide the targets and \ncorresponding funds will be allocated to U LBs so that full \nreimbursement to the banks on account of Interest subvention is \nsettled during the financial year and no subvention amount remain \noverdue or pending with the States.  \n \n13. Monitoring and Evaluation \n13.1 The S tate Mission management Unit (SMMU)  at the State level and \nCity Mission Management Unit (CMMU) at the ULB level will closely \nmonitor progress of activities / targets under this component, \nundertake reporting and evaluation. The SULM and the \nULB/executing agencies shall report timely progress in f ormats \nprescribed by the Mission Directorate from time -to-time, indicating \nthe cumulative achievement monthly and up to the end of the quarter \nand key issues in implementation.  \n    \n15 \n 13.2 In addition, under DAY -NULM, a comprehensive and robust IT -\nenabled DAY -NULM MIS will be established for tracking targets and \nachievements. States and ULBs will be required to submit their \nprogress reports online and may also use this tool to monitor \nprogress on the ground. In the spirit of proactive disclosure of \ninformation and e nsuring transparency under DAY -NULM, key \nprogress reports under SEP will also be made available in the public \ndomain in a timely manner.  \n \n13.3 All the SEP beneficiaries should be visited periodically to assess the \nimpact of the benefit and also to know any problem being faced by \nthem.  The Community Organisers (COs) should visit all the \nbeneficiaries in their jurisdiction at least once in three months.  The \nproject officer/ technical experts at CMMU level should visit at least \n50% beneficiaries once in three m onths.  The observations during the \nfield visit should be kept in record and be uploaded on MIS also.  \n \n13.4 During the field visit mentioned above data on economic status of the beneficiaries should be collected and be compared with similar \ndata given in loan application form, to know the impact of the benefit \non the economic conditions of the beneficiaries.  \n \n13.5 Impact analysis studies may also be conducted at suitable interval to assess the impact of benefit under SEP on the economic status of \nthe beneficiaries.  \n \n13.6 To monitor progress of the targets vis -a-vis achievement under DAY -\nNULM, Banks are advised to furnish cumulative progress reports on \nquarterly basis as per enclosed proforma ( Annex III  & IV) to the \nDirec tor, UPA at dupa- mhupa@nic.in as well as to RBI on email  \nlatest by the end of next month of the quarter to which they relate.  \n \n13.7 Unique Code for loans under NULM:  Banks are advised to \ncategorise these loans under Non- Farm sector and use unique sub-\ncode in their database for loans granted under NULM.

Minimum level of \u2018loan component\u2019 and Effective date \nIn respect of borrowers having aggregate fund based working capital limit of \u20b9 1500 \nmillion  and above from the banking system, a  minimum level of \u2018loan component\u2019 of \n40 percent shall be effective from April  1, 2019. Accordingly, for such borrowers , the \noutstanding \u2018loan component\u2019  (Working Capital Loan) must be equal to at least 40 \npercent of the sanctioned fund bas ed working capital limit , including ad hoc  limits  \nand TODs . Hence, for such borrowers , drawings up to 40 percent of the total fund \nbased working capital limits  shall only be allowed from the \u2018loan component\u2019. \nDrawings in excess of the minimum \u2018loan component\u2019 threshold may be allowed in \nthe form of cash credit facility.  Working examples for bifurcation of working capital \nlimit are provided in Appendix  I. The bifurcation of the working capital limit into loan \nand cash credit components  shall be effected after excluding the export credit limits \n(pre-shipment and post -shipment)  and bills limit for inland sales from the working \ncapital limit. I nvestment by the bank in the commercial p apers issued by the \nborrower  shall form part of the loan component , provided the investment is \nsanctioned as part of the working capital limit .  \n 2. Sharing of Working Capital Finance  \nThe ground rules for sharing of cash credit and loan components may be laid down \nby the consortium, wherever formed, subject to guidelines on bifurcation as stated in \nparagraph 1 above . All lenders in the consortium shall be individually and jointly  \nresponsible to make sure that at the aggregate level, the \u2018loan component\u2019 meets the \nabove mentioned requirements. Under Multiple Banking Arrangements (MBAs), each \nbank shall ensure adherence to these guidelines at individual bank level.  \n \n3.  Amount and tenor  of the loan \nThe amount and tenor of the loan component  may be fixed by banks in consultation \nwith the borrowers , subject to the tenor being not less than seven days . Banks may  \n decide to split the loan component into WCLs with different maturity periods as per  \nthe needs of the borrower s.  \n4.  Repayment/ Renewal/Rollover of Loan Component  \nBanks/consortia/syndicates will have the discretion to stipulate repayment of the \nWCLs  in instalments or by way of a \"bullet\" repayment, subject to IRAC norms.  \nBanks may consider rollover of the WCLs  at the request of the borrower , subject to \ncompliance with the extant IRAC norms . \n \n \n \n \n5. Risk weights for undrawn portion of cash credit limits   \nEffective from April 1, 2019, the undrawn portion of cash credit/ overdraft limits sanctioned to the aforesaid large borrowers, irrespective of whether unconditionally \ncancellable or not, shall attract a credit conversion factor of 20 percent.  \n \n6.

The LEI is a 20- character unique identity code assigned to entities who are \nparties to a financial transaction. Globally, use of LEI has expanded beyond derivative reporting \nand it is being used in areas relating to banking, securities  market, credit rating, market \nsupervision, etc.( https://www.gleif.org/en/about -lei/regulatory -use-of-the-lei). The LEI system has \nbeen implemented in a phased manner for particip ants (other than individuals) in the over -the-\ncounter markets for rupee interest rate derivatives, foreign currency derivatives and credit \nderivatives in India in terms o f RBI circular FMRD.FMID No. 14 /11.01.007/2016- 17 dated June 1, \n2017  and for large corporate borrowers of banks in terms of RBI Circular \nDBR.No.BP.BC.92/21.04.048/2017- 18 dated November 2, 2017 . \n 2. In the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies , \nFirst Bi -monthly Monetary Policy \nStatement for 2018- 19 (Paragraph No. 8), dated April 05, 2018 ,  it was proposed to implement \nthe LEI mechanism for all financial market transac tions undertaken by non- individuals in interest \nrate, currency or credit markets regulated by RBI. Accordingly, draft directions in this regard were \nissued for public comments on June 20, 2018 . Based on comments received during the \nconsultation, the directions on requirement of LEI Code for participation in non- derivative markets \nhave been finalized as below.  \n  3. All participants, other than individuals, undertaking transactions in the markets regulated by \nRBI viz., Government securities markets, money markets (markets for any instrument with a maturity of one year or less) and non- derivative forex markets (transactions that settle on or \nbefore the spot date) shall obtain Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) codes by the due date indicated in the schedule given in Annex\n. Only those entities that obtain an LEI code on or before the due \ndates applic able to them shall be able to undertake transactions in these financial markets after \nthe due date, either as an issuer or as an investor or as a seller / buyer. Transactions undertaken \non recognized stock exchanges are outside the purview of the LEI requi rement.  \n \n4. In case of non- derivative forex  transactions, while all inter -bank transactions shall be subject to \nLEI requirement, client transactions shall require LEI code for transactions involving an amount equivalent to or exceeding USD one million or equivalent thereof in other currencies.   \n \n5. Non -resident entities undertaking financial transactions in the relevant markets shall also \nrequire LEI code. Such entities that are not legal entities in their country of incorporation (e.g., funds operated by a non- resident parent/management company that are each registered as an \nFPI) shall use the LEI code of the parent/management company.  \n 6. Entities responsible for executing transactions, reporting or for depository functions in these markets shall capture the LEI code of the transacting participant s in their systems.   \n \n7. Entities can obtain LEI from any of the Local Operating Units (LOUs) accredited by the Global \nLegal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) ( https://www.gleif.org/en\n). In India LEI code may be \nobtained from Legal Entity Identifier India Ltd. (LEIL) ( https://www.ccilindia -lei.co.in ). The rules, \nprocedures and documentation requirements may be ascertained from LEIL \n(https://www.ccilindia -lei.co.in/USR_FAQ_DOCS.aspx ). \n 8. Entities undertaking financial transactions shall ensure that their LEI code is considered current under the rules of the Global LEI System. Lapsed LEI cod es shall be deemed invalid for \ntransactions in markets regulated by RBI.  \n \n9. The Directions are issued under section 45W, read with section 45U, of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia Act, 1934.  \nYours faithfully  \n  \n(T.

It has now been decided that banks \nwill provide the same facility to the remitter of funds under the RTGS system as well.  \n2. Initially, the positive confirmation feature in RTGS would be available for member \nbanks wherein both remitter and beneficiary banks access RTGS t hrough thick client \ninterface / SFMS member interface. Member banks are expected to communicate \nthe same to their customers. The positive confirmation feature would be \nsubsequently enabled for member banks accessing RTGS through other channels \nas well.  \n3. In this connection, a new message format (camt.059) is being introduced to \ncommunicate an acknowledgement to the remitting bank containing the date and \ntime of credit to beneficiary account. This message would flow from the beneficiary \nbank to the remitter  bank through the SFMS. After receiving the positive confirmation \nfrom the beneficiary bank, the remitter bank shall initiate an SMS and / or generate \n2 \n an e- mail to the remitter. The detailed process flow  for the positive confirmation \nprocess is appended.  \n4. All banks are required to put in place systems to ensure straight -through-\nprocessing (STP) based confirmation processing. The beneficiary bank shall ensure \nthat such confirmation message is sent as soon as the amount is credited to the \nbeneficiary account in CBS while the confirmation message from the remitting bank \nshall be necessarily sent on a real time basis and in any case not beyond one hour \nafter receipt of credit message from the beneficiary bank.  \n5. The system of sending positive confirmation t o the customers shall be \noperationalised by banks at the earliest but not later than two months from the date \nof this circular.  \n6. These directions are issued by Reserve Bank of India, in exercise of the powers \nconferred by section 18 of Payment and Settl ement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of \n2007).  \nYours  faithfully  \n \n(P.

On receipt of the inward camt.059 message,  the remitter bank will update the \ntransaction status as \"Credited to Customer\" for the corresponding transaction.  \n5.

The number, frequency and impact of cyber incidents /attacks have increased manifold in the recent past, more so in the case of \nfinancial sector including banks. There is an  urgent need to put in place a robust \ncyber security/resilience framework at UCBs to ens ure adequate security of their \nassets on a continuous basis. It has , therefore, become essential to enhance the \nsecurity of the UCBs  from cyber threats by improving the current defences in \naddressing cyber risks.  \n 2. It is observed that  the level of technology adoption is also different across the \nbanks in this sector  \u2013 some banks offering state of the art digital products to its \ncustomers and some banks maintaining their books of account in a standalone computer and using e- mail for com municating with its customers/ supervisors/ other \nbanks. Hence, it has been decided to issue basic cyber security guidelines applicable to all UCBs. However, any UCB, depending on its Self -Risk Assessment, \ncomplexity of its  Information Technology (IT)/ Infor mation Security ( IS) systems, \nnature of digital products offered, etc . is free to adopt advanced cyber security norms \nas decided by their Boards.  2  \n3. An indicative but not exhaustive, basic cyber security framework to be implemented by all the UCBs is given in Annex I.  \n 4. Need for a Board approved Cyber Security Policy \u2013  \nAll UCBs should immediately put in place a Cyber Security policy , duly approved by \ntheir Board/ Administrator, giving a framework and the strategy containing a suitable \napproach to check cyber threats depending on the level of complexity of business and acceptable levels of risk. On completion of the process of policy formulation by the Board, a conf irmation shall be sent to Department of Co- operative Bank \nSupervision, Central Office, C -9, 1st Floor, BKC, Mumbai \u2013  400051 by email\n within \nthree months from the date of circular . It shall be ensured that the cyber security \npolicy  deals with the following broad aspects , keeping in view the level of technology \nadoption and digital products offered to the customers : \n 4.1. Cyber Security Policy to be distinct from the IT policy/ IS Policy of the UCB  \nThe Cyber Security Policy should be distinct from the IT/IS policy of the UCB so that \nit highlights the risks from cyber threats and the measures to address /reduce these \nrisks.  While identifying and assessing the inherent risks, UCBs should keep in view \nthe technologies\n1 adopted, delivery channels2, digital products3 being offered, \ninternal4 and external5 threats etc., and rate each of these risks as Low, Medium, \nHigh and Very High.  \n \n4.2. IT A rchitecture/Framework  should be security compliant  \nThe IT architecture/  framework which includes network , server, database and \napplication, end user systems, etc. , should take care of security measures at all \ntimes and this should be reviewed by the Board or IT  Sub-committee of the Board  \nperiodically. For this purpose, UCBs ma y carry out the following steps:  \ni. Identify weak/ vulnerable areas in IT systems and processes,  \n                                                            \n1 Technologies: Security inc ident event  management (SIEM), Privilege Identity Management ( PIM), \ndatabase activity monitoring, etc.  \n2 Delivery channels: ATM, PoS, IMPS, etc. \n3 Digital products: m -Banking, UPI, e -Wallet, etc.  \n4 Internal threats: Critical & sensitive data compromise, password theft, internal source code review, \netc. \n5 External threat: DDoS, Ransomware, etc.  3 ii. Allow restricted access to networks, databases and applications wherever \npermitted, through well -defined processes  and approvals including rationale \nfor permittin g such access,  \niii. Assess the cost of impact in case of br eaches/ failures in these areas and,  \niv. Put in place suitable Cyber Security System to address t hem,  \nv. Specify and document clearly the responsibility for each of above steps . \nA proper record should be kept of the entire process to enable supervisory \nassessment.  \n 4.3. Cyber Crisis Management  Plan   \n4.3.1 Since c yber risk is different from many other risks, the traditional BCP/DR \n(Business Continuity Plan/Disaster Recovery) arrangements may not be adequate and hence needs to be revisited keeping in view the nature of c yber risk. A \nGovernment of India organisation, CERT- In (Computer Emergency Response Team \n\u2013 India, a Government entity) has been taking important initiatives in strengthening \nCyber Security by provi ding proactive/ reactive services and guidelines, threat \nintelligence and assessment of preparedness of various agencies in different \nsectors, including the financial sector. CERT -In also has  come out with National \nCyber Crisis Management Plan and Cyber Sec urity Assessment Framework. UCBs \nmay refer to CERT- In/NCIIP C/RBI/IDRBT guidelines as reference material for their \nguidance.  \n 4.3.2 UCBs should promptly detect any c yber intrusions  (unauthorised entries ) so as \nto respond/recover/ contain impact of cyber -attacks. Among other things, UCBs, \nespecially those offering services such as internet banking, mobil e banking, mobile \nwallet, RTGS/ NEFT/IMPS, SWIFT, debit cards, credit cards etc., should take \nnecessary detective  and corrective measures/steps to address various types of \ncyber threats\n6 viz. denial of service (DoS), distributed denial  of services (DDoS), \nransomware/ crypto ware, destructive malware, business email frauds including \nspam, email phishing, spear phishing, whaling, vishing frauds, drive- by downloads, \nbrowser gateway fraud, ghost administrator exploits, identity frauds, memory update frauds, password related frauds, etc.  \n                                                            \n6 Refer Annex II for a brief description on the various type of threats  4 5. Organisational Arrangements \nUCBs should review the organisational arrangements so that the security concerns \nare brought to the notice of suitable/ concerned officials to enable quick action.  \n \n6. Cyber Security awareness among Top Management /Board/ other concerned \nparties \nManaging c yber risk requires the commitment of the e ntire organization to create a \ncyber -safe environment.  This will req uire a high level of awareness/ familiarisation \namong staff at all levels including Board and Top Management. UCBs should \nactively prom ote among their customers, vendors, service providers and other \nconcerned parties an understanding of its c yber security objectives. Security \nawareness among customers, employees, vendors,  service providers,  etc. about the \npotential impact of cyber -attacks  helps in c yber security preparedness of UCBs.  \n \n7. Ensuring protection of customer information \nUCBs, as owners of customer sensitive data, should take appropriate steps in \npreserving the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the same, irrespective of \nwhether the data is stored/in transit within themselves or with the third party vendors; \nthe confidentiality of such custodial information should not be compromised in any \nsituation. To achieve this, suitable systems and processes across the \ndata/information lifecycle need to be put in place by UCBs. As regards customers, UCBs may educate and cr eate awareness among them with regard to cyber security \nrisks.  \n 8. Supervisory reporting f ramework  \nUCBs should report immediately all unusual c yber security incidents (whether they \nwere successful or mere attempts) to Department of Co- operative Bank Supervision, \nCentral Office, C -9, 1st Floor, BKC, Mumbai \u2013  400051 by email\n, giving full detail s of \nthe incident. A \u2018NIL\u2019 report shall  be submitted on quarterly basis in case of no c yber \nsecurity incidents.   \n 9. A copy of this circular shall be placed before the Board of Directors/ Administrator \nin its ensuing meeting and a policy on Cyber Security should be framed by the \nBoard/A dministrator immediately. After framing of the policy, UCBs are advised to  5 implement basic Cyber Security Controls as indicated in Annex I and report the \nsame to respective Regional Offices of Department of Co- operative Bank \nSupervision on or before March 31, 2019.  \n   \nYours faithfully , \n (Ranjeev Shanker ) \n(General Manager  In - Charge) \n \nEncl osed:  \nAnnex I: Basic Cyber Security Controls for Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks \n(UCBs)  \nAnnex II: Description of some of the cyber security threats  \n \n \n \n Annex to Circular on Cyber Security Framework for Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks  \nA\nnnex I  \nBasic Cyber Security Controls for Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs)  \n1)Inventory Management of Business IT Assets\n1.1 UCBs should maintain an up -to-date business IT Asset I nventory Register\ncontaining the following fields, as a minimum:\na.Details of the IT Asset (viz., hardware/software/network devices,\nkey personnel, services, etc. )\nb.Details of systems where customer data are stored\nc.Associated business applications, if any\nd.Criticality of the IT asset (For example, High/Medium/Low)\n1.2 Classify data/information based on sensitivity criteria of the information  1.3 Appropriately manage and provide protection within and outside UCB/network , keeping in mind how the data/information is  stored, transmitted, \nprocessed, accessed and put to use within/outside the UCB\u2019s network, and level of risk they are exposed to depending on the sens itivity of the \ndata/information  \n2)Preventing access of unauthorised software\n2.1 Maintain an up- to-date and preferably centralised inventory of authorised\nsoftware(s) /approved applications/ software/libraries, etc.\n2.2 Put in place a mechanism to control installation of software/applications\non end- user PCs, laptops, workstations, servers, mobile devices, etc.  Also,\nput in place a mechanism to block/prevent and identify installation and\nrunning of unauthorised software/applications on such devices/systems .\n2.3 The web browser settings should be set to auto update and consider\ndisabling scripts like JavaScript, Java and ActiveX controls when they are notin use.2.4 Internet usage, if any, should be restricted to identified standalonecomputer(s) in the branch of a UCB which are strictly separate from thesystems identified for running day to day business.\n3) Environmental Controls \n3.1 Put in place appropriate controls for securing physical  location of critical \nassets (as identified by the UCB under its inventory of IT assets), providing \nprotection from natural and man- made threats  \n3.2 Put in place mechanisms for monitoring of breaches/ compromises of \nenvironmental controls relating to temperature, water, smoke, access alarms, service availability alerts (power supply, telecommunication, servers), access logs, etc. Appropriate physical security measures shall be taken to protect the critical assets of the UCB.  \n \n4) Network Management and Security  \n4.1 Ensure that all the network devices are configured appropriately and periodically assessed to ensure that such configurations are s ecurely \nmaintained.   \n4.2 The default passwords of all the network devices/ systems should be \nchanged after installation.  \n4.3 Put in appropriate controls to secure wireless local area networks, wireless access points, wireless client access systems.  \n4.4 C ritical infrastructure of UCB (v iz., NEFT, RTGS, SWIFT, CBS, ATM \ninfrastructure) should be designed with adequate network separation controls  \n \n5) Secure Configuration \n5.1 The firewall configurations should be set to the highest security level and evaluation of critical device (such as firewall, network switches, security devices, etc.) configurations should be done periodically.  \n5.2 Systems such as Network, application, database and servers should be used dedicatedly for the purpose for which they have been set up.   \n \n6) Anti-virus and Patch Management  \n6.1 Put in place systems and processes to identify, track, manage and monitor the status of patches to servers,  operating system and application software \nrunning at the systems used by the UCB officials (end- users).  \n6.2 Implement and update antivirus protection for all servers and applicable end points preferably through a centralised system.   \n 7) User Access Control / Management  \n7.1 Disallow administrative rights on end- user workstations/PCs/laptops and \nprovide access rights on a \u2018 need to know \u2019 and \u2018need to do\u2019  basis.  \n7.2 Passwords should be set as complex and lengthy and users should not \nuse same pass words for all the applicat ions/systems/ devices.  \n7.3 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) which allows others to access the computer remotely over a network or over the internet should be always disabled and should be enabled only with the approval of the authorised officer of the UCB. Logs for such remote access shall be enabled and monitored for suspicious activities   \n7.4 Implement appropriate (e.g. centralised) systems and controls to allow, \nmanage, log and monitor privileged/super user/administrative access to \ncritical systems (server s/databases, applications, network devices etc.)  \n \n8) Secure mail and messaging systems  \n8.1 Implement secure mail and messaging systems, including those used by \nUCB\u2019s partners &  vendors, that include measures to prevent email spoofing, \nidentical mail domains, protection of attachments, malicious links etc.  \n8.2 Document and implement email server specific controls.  \n \n9) Removable Media \n9.1 As a default rule, use of removable devices and media should not be \npermitted in the banking environment unless specifically authorised for defined use and duration of use.  \n9.2 Secure the usage of removable media on workstations/PCs/Laptops, etc. and secure erasure/ deletion of data on such media af ter use \n9.3 Get the removable media scanned for malware/anti -virus prior  to providing \nread/write access  \n \n10)  User /Employee/ Management Awareness \n10.1 Communicate to users/employees, vendors & partners  security policies \ncovering secure and acceptable use of UCB\u2019s network/assets including customer information/data, educating them about cyber s ecurity risks and \nprotection measures at their level.  10.2 Conduct awareness/training for staff on basic informat ion security \ncontrols (Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts), incident reporting, etc.  \n10.3 Board members may be kept updated on basic tenets/ principles of IT \nrisk/cyber s ecurity risk at least once a year.  \n10.4 The end- users should be made aware to never open or download an \nemail attachment from unknown sources  \n \n11)  Customer Education and Awareness  \n11.1 Improve and maintain customer awareness and education with regard to \ncyber security risks  \n11.2 Educate the customers on keeping their c ard, PIN etc. secure and not to \nshare with any third party  \n \n12)  Backup and Restoration  \nTake periodic back  up of the import ant data and store this data \u2018off line\u2019  (i.e., \ntransferring important files to a storage device that can be detached from a \ncomputer/ system after copying all the files).  \n \n13)  Vendor/ Outsourcing Risk Management  \n13.1 All the outsourcing service level agreements (SLAs) signed with the vendors must clearly mention the responsibility of the UCB and vendor in case of any failure of services  \n13.2 The agreements must clearly mention the griev ance redressal \nmechanism to r esolve customer complaints  \n13.3 Vendors \u2019 service level agreements shall be periodically reviewed for \nperformance in security controls  \n \n----------------X ----------------  \n  \nAnnex to Circular on Cyber Security Framework for Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks  \n \nAnnex I I \nDescription of some of the cyber security threats  \n1) Denial of service attack: A denial -of-service attack (DoS attack) generally \nconsists of the concerted efforts of a person/ persons  to prevent an i nternet site or \nservice from functioning efficiently. A DoS attack is an incident in which a user or \norganization is deprived of the services of a resource they would normally expect to \nhave.  \n \n2) Distributed denial of service: In a distributed denial -of-service (DDoS) attack, \nlarge numbers of compromised systems (sometimes called a Bot net) attack a single \ntarget, thereby causing denial of service for users of the targeted system. The flood of incoming messages to the target system essentially forces it to shut down, \nthereby , denying the service of the system to legitimate users.  \n3) Ransom ware:  Ransomware is a type of malicious software from cryptovirology \nthat threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually  block access to it unless a \nransom is paid.  \n4) Malware: Malware is the term for maliciously crafted software code. Special computer programmes now exist that enable intruders to fool an individual into believing that traditional security is protecting him  during online banking transactions. \nAttacks involving malware are a factor in online financial crime.  \n5) Phishing: Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such \nas usernames, passwords and credit card details, often for malicious  reasons, by \ndisguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.  \n6) Spear phishing: Phishing attempts directed at specific individuals or companies have been termed spear phishing. In contrast to bulk phishing, spear phishing attackers often gather and use personal information about their target to increase \ntheir probability of success.  2 \n 7) Whaling: The term whaling has been coined for spear phishing attacks directed \nspecifically at senior executives and  other high- profile targets.  In these cases, the \ncontent will be crafted to target an upper manager and the person's role in the company. The content of a whaling attack email may be an executive issue such as \na subpoena or customer complaint.  \n8) Vishing: Vishing is the illegal acces s of data via voice over Internet Protocol \n(VoIP). Vishing is IP telephony\u2019s version of phishing and uses voice messages to \nsteal identities and financial resources. The term  is a combination of \u2018 voice \u2019 and \n\u2018phishing \u2019. \n9) Drive -by downloads: Drive -by downl oad means two things, each concerning the \nunintended  download of computer  software  from the  Internet : \na. Downloads which a person has authorized but without understanding the \nconsequences (e.g. downloads which install an unknown or \ncounterfeit  executable program , ActiveX component, or  Java  applet) \nautomatically  \nb. Any  download that happens without a person's knowledge, often a computer \nvirus , spyware,  malware  or crimeware.  \n10) Browser Gateway frauds: The information sent and received from a PC /device \nis routed through an undesired path on the network thereby exposing it to unauthorised entity. The only gateway to outside world for the PC/device being the \nbrowser that has been compromised.  \n11) Ghost administrator exploit: A  ghost administrator  exploit  is a code that takes \nadvantage of a software vulnerability or security flaw  to gain Administrator\u2019s \nrights/ privileges  in the system . This exploit allows the attacker to mask his identity in \norder  to remotely access a network and gain Administrator rights/ privileges, or move \ndeeper into the network.  In some cases, an exploit can be used as part of a multi -\ncomponent attack. Instead of using a malicious file, the exploit may instead drop \nanother malware, which can include backdoor viruses  and/or  spyware to steal user \ninformation from the infected systems.    \n 3 \n The list is an indicative list of cyber threats.

Applicability  \nThe provisions of these Directions shall apply to every Regional Rural Bank (RRB) \nlicensed to operate in India by Reserve Bank of India.  \nCHAPTER II  \nBACKGROUND  \n2.1 Periodic but frequent occurrence of natural calamity takes a heavy toll on human \nlife and cause wide spread damage to economic pursuits in one or the other part of the country. The devastation c aused by natural calamities calls for massive \nrehabilitation effort from all agencies. The Central, State and local authorities draw up programmes on economic rehabilitation for the people affected by natural calamities. The developmental role assigned to the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) warrant their active support in reviving the economic activities of those affected by \nthe occurrence of a natural calamity.  \n2.2 In terms of the National Disaster Management Framework, there are two funds \nconstituted viz. Nat ional Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster \nResponse Fund (SDRF) for providing relief in the affected areas. The NDRF \nframework currently recognizes twelve types of natural calamities viz. cyclone, drought, earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, hail storm, landslide, avalanche, cloud \nburst, pest attack and cold wave/frost. The Ministry of Agriculture is the nodal point for four of the calamities i.e. drought, hailstorms, pest attack and cold wave/frost and for the remaining eight, the Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal ministry to make the \nnecessary administrative arrangements. A slew of measures for relief are Page  3 | 13 \n undertaken by the Sovereign (Central/State Government) from time to time to \nprovide relief to the affected people including, inter alia, provision for input subsidies \nand financial assistance to farmers including small and marginal farmers.  \n2.3 The Regional Rural Banks, as members of the State Level Bankers Committee \n(SLBC) play a key role in providing relief measure through rescheduling exist ing \nloans and sanctioning fresh loans as per the emerging requirement of the borrowers. \nTo enable banks to take uniform and concerted action expeditiously, these directions are issued covering four aspects viz. Institutional Framework ( Chapter III\n), \nRestructuring of Existing Loans ( Chapter IV ), Providing Fresh Loans ( Chapter V ) and \nOther Ancillary Relief Measures ( Chapter VI ). \nCHAPTER III  \nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK  \n3.1 Establishing Policy/Procedures for dealing with Natural Calamities  \nThe area, time of occurrence and intensity of the natural calamity cannot be anticipated. It is, therefore, imperative that banks have a blueprint of action duly \napproved by t he Board of Directors for such eventualities so that the required relief \nand assistance are provided with utmost speed and without any loss of time. Further, \nall branches of the bank and their regional offices shall be familiar with these \nstanding instruct ions. The standing instructions shall immediately come to force after \nthe district/state authorities put in place the requisite declaration. It is essential that these instructions shall also be made available to the State Government authorities \nand all the District Collectors so that all concerned are aware about the action that \nshall be taken by the concerned authorities in the affected area.  \n3.2 Discretionary Powers to Branch/Regional Office of banks  \nThe Branch/Regional Office Managers of banks  may be vested with certain \ndiscretionary powers to avoid the need to seek fresh approval from their Head Office \nregarding the line of action decided by the District Consultative Committee/State \nLevel Bankers\u2019 Committee. Some of the areas, among others where such \ndiscretionary powers are vital may be the adoption of scale of finance, need based \nrestructuring  of loans , extension of loan period, margin, security, sanction of new \nloan keeping in view the total liability of the borrower arising out of the old loan where \nthe asset financed was damaged or lost as a result of the natural calamity and the new loan financed for creation/repair of such asset(s).  \n3.3 Meeting of State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)/District Consultative \nCommittee (DCC)  \n3.3.1 In the event of occurrence of a natural calamity which covers a larger part of a \nState, the State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee convener bank shall convene a special Page  4 | 13 \n SLBC meeting immediately. The committee, in collaboration with the State \nGovernment authorities shall evolve a coor dinated action plan for implementing the \nrelief programme. If the calamity has affected only a small part of the state/few \ndistricts, the convener of the District Consultative Committee of the affected \ndistrict(s) shall convene a meeting immediately. In th e special SLBC/DCC meeting, \nthe position of the affected areas may be assessed so as to ensure speedy \nformulation and implementation of suitable relief measures.  \n3.3.2 In the areas where the calamity is severe, the relief measure(s) implemented \nshall be reviewed periodically through a specially constituted Task Force/Sub-\nCommittee by way of weekly/fortnightly meetings as decided by the SLBC/DCC.  \n3.4 Scope  \nThe Master Directions shall be applicable to farmers/loanees who have been \naffected by a natural calamity as declared by the State Govt. /Authorities and are \nwilling to avail the benefits under the guidelines.  \n3.5 Declaration of Natural Calamity  \n3.5.1 It is recognised that declaration of a natural calamity is in the domain of the \nCentral / State Gover nment. The inputs received from the State Governments \nrevealed that there is no uniform procedure being followed for declaration of a \nnatural calamity and issue of declarations/certificates. These declarations/certificates are called by different names suc h as Annewari, Paisewari, Girdawari, etc. in \ndifferent States. Nevertheless, the common thread to extend relief measure towards agricultural loans including rescheduling of loans by banks, is that  the crop loss \nassessed should be 33% or more. For assessing  this loss, while some States are \nconducting crop cutting experiments to determine the loss in crop yield, some others \nare relying on the eye estimates/visual impressions.  \n3.5.2 In case of extreme situations such as wide- spread floods, when it is largely \nevident that most of the standing crops have been damaged and/or land and other \nassets have suffered a wide- spread damage, the matter shall be deliberated by \nState Government/District Authorities in a specially convened SLBC/DCC meeting \nwhere the concerned Government functionary/District Collector shall explain the reasons for not estimating \u2018Annewari\u2019 (percentage of crop loss \u2013  by whatever name \ncalled) through crop cutting experiments and that the decision to provide relief for the affected populace needs t o be taken based on the eye estimate/visual impressions.  \n3.5.3 In both the cases, however, SLBC/DCC shall satisfy themselves fully that the \ncrop loss has been 33% or more before acting on these pronouncements.  \n Page  5 | 13 \n CHAPTER IV  \nRESTRUCTURING OF EXISTING LOANS  \nIn the event of a natural calamity, the repaying capacity of the people gets severely \naffected due to the disruption of their economic activities and loss of economic \nassets. Therefore, relief in loan repayment by restructuring the existing loan may \nbecome necessary.  \n4.1. Agriculture Loans: Short -term Production Credit (Crop Loans)  \n4.1.1 All short -term loans, except those which are overdue at the time of occurrence \nof natural calamity, shall  be eligible for restructuring . The principal  amount  of the \nshort -term loan as well as interest due for repayment in the year of occurrence of the \nnatural calamity may be converted into term loan.  \n4.1.2 The repayment period of the restructured loan may vary depending on the \nseverity of the calamity, the impact on l oss of economic assets and distress it \ncaused. A maximum repayment period of up to two years (including the moratorium \nperiod of one year) shall be allowed if the loss is between 33% and 50%. If the crop \nloss is 50% or more, repayment period may be extended upto a maximum of five \nyears (including the one year moratorium period).  \n4.1.3 In all restructured loan accounts, moratorium period of  at least one year  shall \nbe considered. Banks may not insist on additional collateral security for such restructured loa ns. \n4.2 Agriculture Loans: Long term (Investment) Credit  \n4.2.1 The existing term loan instalments shall be rescheduled keeping in view the \nrepaying capacity of the borrower and the nature of natural calamity viz.  \n4.2.1.1 In a natural calamity where only crop for that year is damaged and productive \nassets are not damaged, banks shall reschedule the payment of instalment during \nthe year of natural calamity and extend the loan period by one year. Under this \narrangement the instalments defaulted wilfully in earlier years will not be eligible for \nrescheduling. The banks may also have to postpone payment of interest by \nborrowers.  \n4.2.1.2 In a natural calamity where the productive assets are partially or totally \ndamaged and borrowers are in need of a new loan, the rescheduling by way of \nextension of loan period shall be determined on the basis of overall repaying \ncapacity of the borrower vis -a-vis total liability (old term loan, restructured crop loan, \nif any and the fresh crop/term loan being given) less the su bsidies received from the \nGovernment agencies, compensation available under the insurance schemes etc. Page  6 | 13 \n While the total repayment period for the restructured/fresh term loan may differ on \ncase -to-case basis, generally it shall not exceed a period of 5 years . \n4.3 Other Loans  \n4.3.1  Depending on the severity of the calamity, SLBC/DCC shall take a view as to \nwhether a general rescheduling of all other loans (i.e. besides the agriculture loans) \nsuch as loans granted for allied activities, loans to rural artisans , traders, micro/small \nindustrial units or in case of extreme situations, medium enterprises are required. If \nsuch a decision is taken, while recovery of all the loans be postponed by the specified period, banks may assess the requirement of the individual  borrowers in \neach case and depending on the nature of his/her account, repayment capacity and the need for fresh loans, appropriate decisions shall be taken by the individual banks  \n4.3.2 The primary consideration for extending credit to any unit for its r ehabilitation \nshall be based on the viability of the venture as assessed by the bank.  \n4.4 Asset Classification  \nThe asset classification status of the restructured loans shall be as under:  \n4.4.1 The restructured portion of the short term as well as long -term loans may be \ntreated as current dues and need not be classified as NPA. The asset classification of these term loans would thereafter be governed by the revised terms and conditions. Nevertheless, banks are required to make higher provisions for such \nrestructured standard advances as prescribed by Department of Banking \nRegulation1 from time to time . Further, i nterest income from such restructured \naccounts classified as \u2018standard assets\u2019 will be recognized as per the norms \nprescribed in the DBR guidelines.   \n \n4.4.2. The asset classification for the remaining dues, which does not form a part of the restructured portion, will continue to be governed by the original terms and conditions of its sanction. Consequently, the dues from the borrower shall be classifi ed by the lending bank under different asset classification categories viz. \nstandard, sub- standard, doubtful and loss.  \n4.4.3. Additional finance, if any, shall be treated as \u201cstandard asset\u201d and its future \nasset classification will be governed by the terms  and conditions of its sanction.  \n4.4.4. With the objective to ensure that banks are proactive in extending relief to the \naffected persons, the  benefit  of asset classification of the restructured accounts as \non the date of natural calamity will be available only if the restructuring is com pleted \n                                                           \n1 Master Circular \u2013  Prudential Norms on Income recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to \nAdvances  Page  7 | 13 \n within a period of three months from the date of natural calamity. In the event of \nextreme calamity, when the SLBC/DCC is of the view that this period will not be sufficient for the branches to reschedule all the affected loans, it shall approach \nNABARD giving the reasons for seeking extension. These requests  will be \nconsidered on the basis of merit of each case.  \n \n4.4.5 The accounts that are restructured for the second time or more on account of \nrecurrence of natural calamities shall retain the same asset classification category on \nrestructuring. Accordingly, for a restructured standard asset, the subsequent restructuring necessitated on account of natural calamity shall not be treated as second restructuring, i.e., the standard asset classification s hall be maintained. \nHowever, all other restructuring norms shall apply.  \n4.5 Utilization of Insurance Proceeds  \n4.5.1 While the above measures relating to rescheduling of loans are intended to \nprovide relief to the farmers, the insurance proceeds should, ideally, compensate the \nlosses. In terms of orders issued by the Ministry of Agriculture,  Department of \nAgricultu re, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima \nYojana (PMFBY) has replaced the existing  schemes  of   National   Agricultural \nInsurance Scheme (NAIS) & Modified National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (MNAIS) with effect from Kharif 2016.  Under the Prime Minister Fasal Bima \nYojana (PMFBY), all Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) loans for notified crops in notified areas are to be compulsorily provided insurance cover for all \nstages of the crop cycle including post -harvest risks in specified instances\n2.  \nFarmers\u2019 details are required to be entered by banks in the unified portal for crop \ninsurance which is available at  www.agri -insurance.gov.in in order to facilitate \nassessment  of coverage of crops insured, premiums deducted, etc.  \n4.5.2 While restructuring the loans in areas affected by a natural calamity, banks shall also take into account the insurance proceeds, if any, receivable from the \nInsurance Company. The insurance proc eeds shall be adjusted to the \u2018restructured \naccounts\u2019 in cases where fresh loan have been granted to the borrower. However, banks shall act with empathy and consider restructuring and granting fresh loans without waiting for the receipt of insurance claim in cases where there is reasonable certainty of receiving the claim.  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n2 Operational Guidelines \u2013  PMFBY issued by Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers\u2019  Welfare  Page  8 | 13 \n CHAPTER V  \nPROVIDING FRESH LOANS  \n5.1 Sanctioning of Fresh Loans  \n5.1.1 Once the decision to reschedule loans is taken by SLBC/DCC, pending \nconversion of short -term loans, banks shall grant fresh crop loan to the affected \nfarmers based on the scale of finance of the crop and the cultivation area as per the \nextant guidelines3. \n5.1.2 The bank assistance in agriculture and allied activities (poultry, fishery, animal \nhusbandry, etc.) may also be needed for long term loans for a variety of purposes \nsuch as repair of existing economic asset(s) and/or acquisition of new asset(s). \nSimilarly, rural artisans, self -employed persons, micro and small industrial units, etc. \nin the areas affected by a natural calamity may require fresh credit to sustain their \nlivelihood. Banks shall assess the need and decide on the quantum of loans to be \ngranted to the affected borrowers taking into consideration, amongst others, the \ncredit requirement and the due pr ocedure for sanctioning fresh loans.  \n5.1.3. Banks shall also grant consumption loan up to \u20b9 10,000/ - to existing borrowers \nwithout any collateral. The limit may, however, be enhanced beyond \u20b9 10,000/ - at \nthe bank\u2019s discretion.  \n5.2 Terms and Conditions  \n5.2.1 Guarantee, Security and Margin \n5.2.1.1 Credit shall  not be denied for want of a personal guarantee alone. Where the \nbank\u2019s existing security has been eroded because of damage or destruction by \nfloods, assistance will not be denied merely for want of addi tional fresh security. The \nfresh loan shall be granted even if the value of security (existing as well as the asset \nto be acquired from the new loan) is less than the loan amount. For fresh loans, banks shall take a sympathetic view.  \n5.2.1.2 Where the crop loan (which has been converted into term loan) was earlier \nsanctioned against personal security/hypothecation of crop and the borrower is not \nable to offer charge/mortgage of land as security for the converted loan, she/he shall \nnot be denied conversion f acility merely on the ground of his/her inability to furnish \nland as security. If the borrower has already availed a term loan against \nmortgage/charge on land, the bank shall be content with a second charge for the \nconverted term loan. Banks shall not insi st on third party guarantee for providing \nconversion facility.  \n                                                           \n3 Master Circular \u2013  Kisan Credit Card Scheme  Page  9 | 13 \n 5.2.1.3 Where land is taken as security, in the absence of original title record, a \ncertificate issued by the Revenue Department officials shall be accepted for financing to farmers who have lost proof of their title such as title deed or registration certificate issued to registered share- croppers.  In the areas covered by the Sixth \nSchedule of the Constitution, whereby the land is owned by the community, \ncertificate issued by community authorit ies may be accepted.  \n5.2.1.4 Margin requirements may be waived or the grant/subsidy given by the \nconcerned State Government shall be considered as margin.  \n5.3 Rate of Interest  \n5.3.1 The rate of interest shall be in accordance with the Master Directions \u2013  \nReserve Bank of India (Interest Rate on Loans and Advances) Directions. Within the \nareas of their discretion, however, banks shall take a sympathetic view of the \ndifficulties of the borrowers and extend a concessional treatment to calamity -affected \npeople.  In respect of default in current dues, no penal interest shall be charged. The \nbanks shall also suitably defer the compounding of interest charges. Banks shall not \nlevy any penal interest and consider waiving penal interest, if any, already charged in \nregard to the loans converted/rescheduled. Depending on the nature and severity of \nthe natural calamity, the SLBC/ DCC shall take a view on the interest rate concession that could be extended to borrowers so that there is uniformity in approach among banks in providing relief.  \n5.3.2 As notified by the Government of India4 from time to time, to provide relief to \nfarmers availing short term crop loans and affected by a natural calamity, an interest \nsubvention of 2 percent per annum will be made available to bank s for the first year \non the restructured loan amount. Such restructured loans shall attract normal rates \nof interest from the second year onwards.  \nCHAPTER VI  \nOTHER ANCILLARY MEASURES  \n6.1 Relaxation on Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms  \nIt needs to be recognized that many persons displaced or adversely affected by a \nmajor calamity may not have access to their identification and personal records. In \nsuch cases a basic saving bank deposit account on the basis of photograph along \nwith signat ure or thumb impression rendered in front of the bank official shall be \nopened. The above instruction shall be applicable to cases where the balance in the \naccount does not exceed \u20b9 50,000/ - or the amount of relief granted (if higher) and  \nthe total credit in the account does not exceed \u20b9 1,00,000/ - or the amount of relief \ngranted, (if higher) in a year.  \n                                                           \n4 Subject to inclusion in the IS Scheme on short term crop loans  Page  10 | 13 \n 6.2 Providing access to Banking Service  \n6.2.1 Banks may operate its natural calamity affected branches from temporary \npremises under advice to the concerned Regional Office of RBI/NABARD. For \ncontinuing the temporary premise beyond 30 days, banks may obtain specific \napproval from the appropriate authorities. Banks may also make arrangements to \nrender banking services in the affected areas by setting up satell ite offices, extension \ncounters or mobile banking facilities etc. under intimation to RBI/NABARD.  \n6.2.2 To meet the immediate cash requirements of the affected people, due importance may be given towards restoring the ATMs or other alternate \narrangements s hall be provided to avail such facilities.  \n6.2.3 Other measures that banks may initiate at their discretion to alleviate the \ncondition of the affected people could be waiving ATM fees, increasing ATM \nwithdrawal limits; waiving of fees towards overdraft/early withdrawal penalty on time \ndeposits /late fee for credit card/other loan instalment payments etc. and giving \noption to credit card holders to convert their outstanding balance to EMIs repayable \nin 1-2 years. Besides, all charges debited to the farm loan account other than the \nregular interest may be waived considering the hardship caused to the affected \npeople.  \nCHAPTER VII  \nRIOTS AND DISTURBANCES: APPLICABILITY OF THE GUIDELINES  \nApplicability of the guidelines in case of riots and disturbance s \n7.1 Whenever RBI/NABARD advises the banks to extend rehabilitation assistance to \nthe riot/ disturbance affected persons, the aforesaid guidelines shall broadly be followed by banks for the purpose. It shall, however, be ensured that only genuine \npersons,  duly identified by the State Administration as having been affected by the \nriots/ disturbances, are provided assistance as per the guidelines.  In the event of \nlarge scale riots where most part of the State/Area is affected and the State \nAdministration is not in a position to identify the riot/disturbance affected persons and \nsubject to SLBC\u2019s specific decision, the onus of identifying \u2018genuine persons\u2019 will rest \nwith banks.  \n7.2. The issuance of advice to the banks by RBI/NABARD on receipt of request/ \ninformation from State Government and thereafter issue of instructions by banks to \ntheir branches generally results in delay in extending the assistance to riot -affected \npeople. With a view to ensure quic k relief to the affected people, it has been decided \nthat the District Colle ctor, on occurrence of the riot/ disturbance, may ask the Lead \nBank Officer to convene a meeting of the DCC, if necessary and submit a report to \nthe DCC on the extent of damage caused to life and property in the area affec ted by Page  11 | 13 \n riot/dis turbance. If the DCC is satisfied that there has been extensive loss to life and \nproperty on account of the riot/ disturbance, the relief as per the above guidelines \nshall be extended to the people affected by the riot/ disturbance. In cases where \nthere ar e no District Consultative Committees, the District Collector may request the \nconvener of the State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee of the State to convene a meeting \nof the bankers to consider extension of relief to the affected persons. The report submitted by t he District Collector and the decision thereon of SLBC/DCC shall be \nrecorded and shall form a part of the minutes of the meeting. A copy of the proceedings of the meeting shall be forwarded to the concerned Regional Office of \nthe Reserve Bank of India.  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n         \n \n   \n Page  12 | 13 \n Appendix  \nMaster Direction -  Reserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas \nAffected by Natural Calamities) Directions, 2018  \nList of circulars consolidated for the Master Direction  \nSr. \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

Applicability  \nThe provisions of these Directions shall  apply to Scheduled Commercial Banks \n{including Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and excluding Regional Rural Banks(RRBs)} \nlicensed to operate in India by Reserve Bank of India.  \nCHAPTER II  \nBACKGROUND  \n2.1 Periodic occurrence of a natural calamity takes a heavy toll on human life and \ncause wide-  spread damage to economic pursuits in one or the other part s of the \ncountry. The devastation caused by a natural calamity calls for massive rehabilitation effort from all agencies. The Central, State and Local Authorities draw up \nprogrammes on economic rehabilitation for the people affected by the occurrence of a natural calamity. The developmental role assigned to the commercial banks \nincluding small finance banks warrant their active support in reviving the economic \nactivi ties of those affected by the occurrence of a natural calamity.  \n2.2 In terms of the National Disaster Management Framework, there are two funds \nconstituted viz. National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster \nResponse Fund (SDRF) for providing relief in the affected areas. The NDRF \nframework currently recognizes twelve types of natural calamities viz. cyclone, drought, earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, hailstorm, landslide, avalanche, cloud burst, pest attack and cold wave/frost. The Ministry of A griculture is the nodal point \nfor four of the calamities i.e. drought, hailstorms, pest attack and cold wave/frost and \nfor the remaining eight, the Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal ministry to make the  Page 3 of 12 \n necessary administrative arrangements. A slew of measures for relief are \nundertaken by the Sovereign (Central/State Government) from time to time to provide relief to the affected people including, inter alia, provision for input subsidies  \nand financial assistance to farmers including small and marginal farmers.  \n2.3 The role of the scheduled commercial banks including small finance banks \n(SFBs) is to provide relief measure through rescheduling of existing loans and \nsanctioning fresh loans as per the emerging requirement of the borrowers. To enable \nbanks t o take a uniform and concerted action expeditiously, these directions are \nissued covering four aspects viz. Institutional Framework ( Chapter III\n), Restructuring \nof Existing Loans ( Chapter IV ), Providing Fresh Loans ( Chapter V ) and Other \nAncillary Relief Measures ( Chapter VI ). \nCHAPTER III  \nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK \n3.1 Establishing Policy/Procedures for dealing with Natural Calamities  \nThe area, time of occurrence and inte nsity of a natural calamity cannot be \nanticipated. It is therefore, imperative that banks have a blueprint of action duly \napproved by the Board of Directors for such eventualities so that the required relief \nand assistance are provided with utmost speed and without any loss of time. Further, \nall Divisional/Zonal Offices and branches of scheduled commercial/small finance banks shall be familiar with these standing instructions. The standing instructions \nshall immediately come to force after the district/state authorities put in place the \nrequisite declaration. It is essential that these instructions shall  also be made \navailable to the State Government authori ties and the District Collector  so that all \nconcerned are aware about the action that shall  be taken by the concerned \nauthorities in the affected area.  \n3.2 Discretionary Powers to Divisional / Zonal Manager of banks  \nThe Divisional/Zonal Managers of scheduled commercial/SF banks may  be vested \nwith certain discretionary powers to avoid the need to seek fresh approval from their \nHead Office/Controlling Office regarding the line of action decided by the District \nConsultative Committee/State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee. Some of the areas, among \nothers where such discretionary powers are vital may  be the adoption of scale of \nfinance, need based restructuring of loans, extension of loan period, margin, \nsecurity, sanction of new loan keeping in view the total liability of the borrower arising \nout of the old loan where the asset financed was damaged or lost as a result of the \nnatural calamity and the new loan to be financed for creation/repair of such asset(s).  \n \n Page 4 of 12 \n 3.3 Meeting of State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)/District Consultative \nCommitte e (DCC)  \n3.3.1 In the event of occurrence of a natural calamity which covers a larger part of a \nState, the State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee convener bank shall  convene a special \nSLBC meeting immediately. The committee, in collaboration with the State Government Authorities shall  evolve a coordinated action plan for implementing the \nrelief programme. If the calamity has affected only a small part of the state/few \ndistricts, the convener of the District Consultative Committee of the affected \ndistrict(s) shall convene a meeting immediately. In the special SLBC/DCC meeting, \nthe position of the affected areas may  be assessed so as to ensure speedy \nformulation and implementation of suitable relief measures.  \n3.3.2 In the areas where the calamity is severe, the relief measure(s) implemented shall be reviewed periodically through a specially constituted Task Force/Sub-\nCommittee by way of weekly/fortnightly meetings as decided by the SLBC/DCC.  \n3.4 Scope  \nThe Master Directions shall apply  be applicable to farmers/loanees who have \nbeen affected by a natural calamity as declared by the State Government/Authorities and are willing to avail the benefits under the \nguidelines.  \n3.5 Declaration of Natural Calamity  \n3.5.1 It is recognised that declaration of a natural calamity is the domain of the \nCentral/ State Governments. The inputs received from the State Governments \nrevealed that there is no uniform procedure being followed for declaration of a \nnatural calamity and issue of declarations/ certificates. The declarations/certificates \nare called by different names such as Annewari, Paisewari, Girdawari, etc. in \ndifferent States. Nevertheless, the common thread to extend relief measure towards \nagricultural loans  including rescheduling of loans by banks, is that  the crop loss \nassessed  should be 33% or more.  For assessing this loss, while some States are \nconducting crop cutting experiments to determine the loss in crop yield, some others \nare relying on the eye estimates/visual impressions.  \n3.5.2 In extreme situations such as wide- spread floods, when it is largely evident that \nmost of the standing crops have been damaged and/or land and other assets have \nsuffered a wide- spread damage, the matter shall  be deliberated by State \nGovernment/District Authorities in a specially convened SLBC/DCC  meeting where \nthe concerned Government functionary/District Collector shall  explain the reasons for \nnot estimating \u2018Annewari\u2019 (percentage of crop loss \u2013  by whatever name called) Page 5 of 12 \n through crop cutting experiments and that the decision to provide relief for the \naffected populace needs to be taken based on the eye estimate/visual impressions.  \n3.5.3 I n both the cases, however, SLBC/DCC shall satisfy themselves fully that the \ncrop loss has been 33% or more before acting on these pronouncements.  \nCHAPTER IV \nRESTRUCTURING OF EXISTING LOANS \nIn the event of a natural calamity, the repaying capacity of the people may  get \nseverely affected due to the disruption of their economic activities and loss/damage \nof economic assets. Therefore, relief in loan repayment by restructuring the existing \nloan may become necessary.  \n4.1. Agriculture Loans: Short -term Production Credit (Crop Loans)  \n4.1.1 All short -term loans except those which are overdue at the time of occurrence \nof the natural calamity shall  be eligible for restructuring. The principal amount of the \nshort -term loan as well as interest due for repayment in the year of occurrence of the \nnatural calamity shall  be converted into term loan.  \n4.1.2 The repayment period of the restructured loan may  vary depending on the \nseverity of the calamity, the impact on loss/damage of economic assets and distress \nit caused. A max imum repayment period of up to two years (including the \nmoratorium period of one year) shall be allowed if the loss is between 33% an d 50%. \nIf the crop loss is 50% or more, repayment period may  be extended upto a max imum \nof five years (including the one year moratorium period).  \n4.1.3 In all restructured loan accounts, moratorium period of  at least one year  shall \nbe considered. Banks may  not insist on additional collateral security for such \nrestructured loans.  \n4.2 Agriculture Loans: Long term (Investment) Credit  \n4.2.1 The existing term loan instalments shall be rescheduled keeping in view the \nrepaying capacity of the borrower and the nature of natural calamity viz.  \n4.2.1.1 In a natural calamity where only crop of that year is damaged and productive \nassets are not damaged, banks shall  reschedule the payment of instalment during \nthe year of natural calamity and extend the loan period by one year. Under this arrangement the instalments defaulted wilfully in earlier years shall  not be eligible for \nrescheduling. The banks may  also have to postpone payment of interest by \nborrowers.  Page 6 of 12 \n 4.2.1.2 In a natural calamity where the productive assets are partially or totally \ndamaged and borrowers are in need of a new loan, the rescheduling by way of \nextension of loan period shall  be determined on the basis of overall repaying \ncapacity of the borrower vis -a-vis total liability (old term loan, restructured crop loan, \nif any, and the fresh crop/term loan being given) less the subsidies received from the \nGovernment Agencies and compensation available under the insurance schemes \netc. While the total repayment period for the restructured/fresh term loan may  differ \non case- to-case basis, generally it shall  not exceed a period of five years.  \n4.3 Other Loans  \n4.3.1 Depending on the severity of a natural calamity, SLBC/DCC  shall take a view \nas to whether a general rescheduling of all other loans (i.e. besides the agriculture \nloans) such as loans granted for allied activities, loans to rural artisans, traders, \nmicro/small industrial units or in case of extreme s ituations, medium enterprises are  \nrequired. If such a decision is taken, while recovery of all the loans be postponed by \nthe specified period, banks may  assess the requirement of the individual borrowers \nin each case and depending on the nature of her/ his account, repayment capacity \nand the need for fresh loans, appropriate decisions shall be taken by the individual \nbanks.  \n4.3.2 The primary consideration for extending credit to any unit for its rehabilitation \nshall be based on the viability of the venture as assessed by the bank.  \n4.4 Asset Classification \nThe asset classification status of the restructured loans shall be as under:  \n4.4.1 The restructured portion of the short term as well as long- term loans may  be \ntreated as current dues and need not be classified as NPA. The asset classification \nof these term loans would  thereafter be governed by the revised terms and \nconditions. Nevertheless, banks are r equired to make higher provisions  for the \nrestructured standard advances as prescribed by the Department of Banking \nRegulation1 from time to time. Further, i nterest income from such restructured \naccounts classified as \u2018standard assets\u2019 will be recognized as per the norms \nprescribed in the DBR guidelines.   \n \n4.4.2. The asset classification for the remaining dues, that does not form a part of the \nrestructured portion, shall  continue to be governed by the original terms and \nconditions of its sanction. Consequently, the dues from the borrower shall  be \n                                                            \n1 Master Circular- Prudential N orms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to \nAdvances  \n Page 7 of 12 \n classified by the lending bank under different asset classification categories viz. \nstandard, sub- standard, doubtful and loss.  \n4.4.3. Additional finance, if any, shall be treated as \u201cstandard asset\u201d and its future \nasset classification will be governed by the terms and conditions of its sanction.  \n4.4.4. With the objective to ensure that banks are proactive in extending relief to the \naffected persons, the benefit  of asset classification of the restructured account as on \nthe date of natural calamity shall  be available only if the restructuring is completed \nwithin a period of three months from the date of declaration of the natural calamity \nby the Government . In the event of extreme calamity, when the SLBC/DCC is of the \nview that this period shall  not be sufficient for the banks to reschedule all the \naffected loans, it shall approach the Chief General Manager, Reserve Bank of \nIndia, Financial Inclusion and Development Department, Central Office, \nMumbai through the concerned Regional Director of RBI. The request shall  \ndetail the reasons for not completing the exercise within the stipulated timeframe and outcome anticipated from such an extension. Such requests \nalong with the specific recommendations of the Regional Director shall be considered on the merit of each case.  \n \n4.4.5 The accounts that are restructured for the second time or more on account of \nrecurrence of natural calamities shall  retain the same asset classification category on \neach restructuring. Accordingly, for a restructured standard asset, the s ubsequent \nrestructuring necessitated on account of a natural calamity shall  not be treated as \nsecond restructuring, i.e., the standard asset classification shall be maintained. \nHowever, all other restructuring norms shall  apply.  \n4.5 Utilization of Insurance Proceeds  \n4.5.1 While the above measures relating to rescheduling of loans are intended to \nprovide relief to the farmers, the insurance proceeds shall , ideally compensate the \nlosses. In terms of orders issued by the Ministry of Agriculture,  Depart ment of \nAgriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima \nYojana (PMFBY) has replaced the existing schemes of National Agricultural \nInsurance Scheme (NAIS) & Modified National Agricultural Insurance Scheme \n(MNAIS) with effect from Kharif 2016. Under the Prime Minister Fasal Bima \nYojana (PMFBY), all Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) loans for notified \ncrops in notified areas are to be compulsorily provided insurance cover for all \nstages of the crop cycle including post -harvest risks in specified instances2.  \nFarmers\u2019 details are required to be entered by banks in the unified portal for crop \ninsurance which is available at  www.agri- insurance.gov.in  in order to facilitate \nassessment of coverage of crops insured, premiums deducted, etc.  \n                                                            \n2 Operational guidelines \u2013 PMFBY issued by Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers\u2019 Welfare  Page 8 of 12 \n 4.5.2 While restructuring loans in an area affected by a natural calamity, banks shall  \nalso take into account the insurance proceeds, if any, receivable from an insurance \ncompany. The insurance proceeds  shall be adjusted towards  the \u2018restructured \naccounts\u2019 in cases where fresh loans have been granted to the borrower. However, banks shall act with empathy and consider restructuring and granting fresh loans \nwithout waiting for the rec eipt of the insurance claim in cases where there is \nreasonable certainty of receiving the claim.  \nCHAPTER V \nPROVIDING FRESH LOANS  \n5.1 Sanctioning of Fresh Loans \n5.1.1 Once the decision to reschedule loans is taken by SLBC/DCC, pending \nconversion of short -term loans, banks shall  grant fresh crop loan to the affected \nfarmers based on the scale of finance of the crop and the cultivation area as per the \nextant guideli nes\n3. \n5.1.2 The bank assistance in agriculture and allied activities (poultry, fishery, animal \nhusbandry, etc.) may  also be needed for long term loans for a variety of purposes \nsuch as repair of existing economic asset(s) and/or acquisition of new asset(s) . \nSimilarly, rural artisans, self- employed persons, micro and small industrial units, etc. \nin the areas affected by a natural calamity may  require fresh credit to sustain their \nlivelihood. Banks shall assess the need and decide on the quantum of loans to b e \ngranted to the affected borrowers taking into consideration, amongst others, the credit requirement and due procedure for sanctioning fresh loans.  \n5.1.3. Banks shall  also grant consumption loan up to   \u20b9. 10,000/ - to existing \nborrowers without any collat eral. The limit may , however, be enhanced beyond   \n\u20b9.10, 000/- at the bank\u2019s discretion.  \n5.2 Terms and Conditions \n5.2.1 Guarantee, Security and Margin \n5.2.1.1 Credit shall  not be denied for want of a personal guarantee alone. Where the \nbank\u2019s existing security has been eroded because of damage or destruction by \nfloods, assistance shall not be denied merely for want of additional fresh security. \nThe fresh loan shall be grant ed even if the value of security (existing as well as the \nasset to be acquired from the new loan) is less than the loan amount. For fresh loans, banks shall  take a sympathetic view.  \n                                                            \n3 Master Circular- Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme  Page 9 of 12 \n 5.2.1.2 Where the crop loan (which has been converted into term loan) was earlier \nsanctioned against personal security/hypothecation of crop and the borrower is not \nable to offer charge/mortgage of land as security for the converted loan, she/he shall  \nnot be denied conversion facility merely on the ground of his/her inability to furnish \nland as security. If the borrower has already availed a term loan against \nmortgage/charge on land, the bank shall  be content with a second charge for the \nconverted term loan. Banks shall  not insist on third party guarantee for providing \nconversion facility.  \n5.2.1.3 Where land is taken as security, in the absence of original title record, a \ncertificate issued by the Revenue Department officials shall  be accepted for \nfinancing to farmers who have lost proof of their title such as title deed or registration certificate issued to registered share- croppers.  In the areas covered by the Sixth \nSchedule of the Constitution, whereby the land is owned by the community, certificate issued by community  authorities may be accepted.  \n5.2.1.4 Margin requirements may  be waived or the grant/subsidy given by the \nconcerned State Government shall  be considered for margin security.  \n5.3 Rate of Interest  \n5.3.1The rate of interest shall  be in accordance with the Master Directions -  Reserve \nBank of India (Interest Rate on Loans and Advances) Directions. Within the area of \ntheir discretion, however, banks shall  take a sympathetic view of the difficulties of the \nborrowers and extend a concessional treatment to calamity -affected people. In \nrespect of default in current dues, no penal interest shall  be charged. The banks \nshall also suitably defer the compounding of interest charges. Banks shall  not levy \npenal interest and consider waiving penal interest, if any, already charged in regard \nto the loans converted/rescheduled. Depending on the nature and severity of the \nnatural calamity, the SLBC/ DCC shall take a view on the interest rate concession \nthat could be extended to borrowers so that there is uniformity in approach among \nbanks in providing relief.  \n5.3.2 As notified by the Government of India4 from time to time, to provide \nrelief to farmers availing short term crop loans and affected by a natural \ncalamity, an interest subvention of 2 percent  per annum shall be made \navailable to banks for the first year on the restructured loan amount. Such \nrestructured loans shall  attract normal rate of interest from the second year \nonwards.           \n            \n                                                            \n4 Subject to inclusion in the Interest Subvention Scheme on short term crop loans  Page 10 of 12 \n CHAPTER VI  \nOTHER ANCILLARY MEASURES  \n6.1 Relaxation on Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms \nIt needs to be recognized that many persons displaced or adversely affected by a \nmajor calamity may  not have access to their identification and personal records. In \nsuch cases, a basic saving bank deposit account on the basis of photograph along with signature or thumb impression rendered in front of the bank official shall be \nopened. The above instruction shall  be applicable to cases where the balance in the \naccount does not exceed \u20b9 50,000/ - or the amount of relief granted (if higher) or the \ntotal credit in the account does not exceed \u20b9 1,00,000/ - or the amount  of relief \ngranted, if higher  in a year.  \n6.2 Providing access to Banking Service \n6.2.1 Banks may  operate its natural calamity affected branches from temporary \npremises under advice to the concerned Regional Office of RBI. For continuing the \ntemporary premise beyond 30 days, banks may  obtain specific approval from the \nconcerned Regional Office of RBI.  Banks may also make arrangements to render \nbanking services in the affected areas by setting up satellite offices, extension counters or mobile banking facilities etc. under intimation to RBI.  \n6.2.2 To meet the immediate cash requirement s of the affected people, due \nimportance shall be given towards restoring the ATMs or other alternate \narrangements shall be provided to avail such facilities.  \n6.2.3 Other measures that banks may  initiate at their discretion to alleviate the \ncondition of the affected people could be waiving of ATM fees, increasing ATM withdrawal limits; waiving of fees towards overdraft/early withdrawal penalty on time deposits/late fee for credit card/other loan instalment payments etc. and giving option \nto credit card holders to convert their outstanding balance to EMIs repayable in 1- 2 \nyears. Besides, all charges debited to the farm loan account other than the regular interest may be waived considering the hardship caused to the affected people.  \nCHAPTER VII  \nRIOTS AND DISTURBANCES: APPLICABILITY OF THE GUIDELINES  \nApplicability of the guidelines in case of riots and disturbances \n7.1 Whenever RBI advises the banks to extend rehabilitation assistance to the riot/ \ndisturbance affected persons, the aforesaid guidelines shall  broadly be followed by \nbanks for the purpose. It shall , however, be ensured that only genuine persons, duly \nidentified by the State Administration as having been affected by the riot/ disturbance \nare provided assistance as per the guidelines.  In the event of  large scale riot s Page 11 of 12 \n where most parts of the State/Area  are affected and the State Administration is \nnot in a position to identify the riot/disturbance affected persons and subject \nto SLBC\u2019s specific decision,  the onus of identifying \u2018genuine persons\u2019 will rest \nwith banks.  \n7.2. The issuance of advice to the banks by Reserve Bank of India on receipt of \nrequest/ information from State Government and thereafter issue of instructions by \nbanks to their branches generally results in delay in extending the assistance to riot -\naffected people. With a view to ensure quick relief to the affected persons, it has \nbeen decided that the District Collector, on occurrence of the riot/ disturbance, may  \nask the Lead Bank Officer t o convene a meeting of the DCC, if necessary and \nsubmit a report to the DCC on the extent of damage caused to life and property in \nthe area affected by the riot/disturbance. If the DCC is satisfied that there has been \nextensive loss to life and property on account of the riot/ disturbance, the relief as \nper the above guidelines shall be extended to the people affected by the riot/ \ndisturbance. In cases where there is  no District Consultative Committee , the District \nCollector may request the convener of the State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee of the \nState to convene a meeting of the bankers to consider extension of relief to the affected persons. The report submitted by the District  Collector and the decision \nthereon of SLBC /DCC  shall be recorded and shall  form a part of the minutes of the \nmeeting. A copy of the proceedings of the meeting shall be forwarded to the \nconcerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank of India.  \nCHAPTER VIII  \nNatural Calamities Portal: Monthly Reporting  \n8.1 The Reserve Bank of India has developed a dedicated portal \n(https://dbie.rbi.org.in/DCP/\n) for collection and compilation of data on natural \ncalamities on a real time basis through a centralized system. The portal provides facility for uploading data files relating to relief measures extended \nby banks and notification issued by State Government with regard to natural calamities.   \n8.2 Banks shall upload the actual data on relief measures every month by the \n10th of the following month. In case there is no natural calamity and/or relief \nmeasures extended, a \u2018NIL\u2019 statement shall be uploaded.  \n8.3 The SLBC Convener Bank shall upload the notification(s) issued by \nState/District Authorities on declaration of a natural calamity for which relief \nmeasures were implemented by SLBC/banks.  \n \n Page 12 of 12 \n Appendix  \nMaster Direction -  Reserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas \nAffected by Natural Calamities) Directions, 2018:  \nList of circulars consolidated for the Master Direction \nSr. \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

Voluntary Transition of Urban Cooperative Banks into Small Finance Banks  \nThe High Powered Committee on Urban Cooperative Banks (UCB), chaired by Shri \nR. Gandhi, the then Deputy Governor of Reserve Bank, had, inter alia , \nrecommended the voluntary conversion of large Multi -State UCBs into Joint Stock \nCompanies and other UCBs which meet certain criteria into Small Finance Banks \n(SFBs). Taking these recommendations into consideration, it has been decided to \nallow voluntary transition of UCBs meet ing the prescribed criteria into SFBs. The \ndetailed scheme will be announced separately.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n- 1 - \n  \nScheme on voluntary transition of Urban Co- operative Bank into a Small \nFinance Bank  \n(Circular reference no. DCBR.CO.LS.PCB. Cir.No. 5 /07.01. 000/2018- 19 dated \nSeptember 27, 2018)  \n \nChapter I  \nIntroduction \n \n1. In terms of Section 5 (ccv) read with Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, \n1949 a primary co- operative bank (Urban Co- operative Bank or UCB) means a co -\noperative society, other than a primary agricultural credit society, whose,  \n \na) Primary object or principal business of which is the transaction of banking \nbusiness;  \nb) Paid-up share capital and reserves of which are not less than one lakh of \nrupees; and \nc) Bye-laws of which do not permit admission of any other co- operative society \nas a member: Provided that this sub- clause shall not apply to the admission of \na co- operative bank as a member by reason of such co- operative bank \nsubscribing to the share capital of such co- operative society out of funds \nprovided by the State Government for the purpose.  \n \n2. Over the years, a few UCBs along with high rate of growth, have expanded their \narea of operation to multiple states thus acquiring the size and complexities of a \nsmall commercial bank. Discussion Paper on \u2018Banking Structure in India -  The Way \nForward\u2019 dated August 27 , 2013 envisaged conversion of UCBs into commercial \nbanks  and exploring the possibilities of converting some UCBs into commercial \nbanks or small banks. The High Powered Committee (HPC) on U CBs recommended \nvoluntary conversion of large Multi -State UCBs into Joint Stock Companies and \nother UCBs which meet certain criteria into Small Finance Banks (SFBs).  \n \n3. RBI had issued guidelines for licensing of Small Finance Banks in the private \nsector on November 27, 2014 with the objective of furthering financial inclusion by (i) \nprovision of savings vehicles primarily to unserved and underserved sections of the \npopulation, and (ii) supply of credit to small business units; small and marginal \nfarmers; m icro and small industries; and other entities in the unorganized sector, \nthrough high technology -low cost operations. A minimum paid- up-capital of Rs.1 \nbillion has been prescribed for SFB with a minimum regulatory CRAR of 15%. \nFurther, 75% of their adjusted net bank credit (ANBC) will go towards priority sector \nlending and 50% of the loan portfolio will constitute loans up to Rs. 2.5 million.  \n \n4. In keeping with the fast paced changes in the banking space and in order to \nfacilitate growth, a scheme for voluntary transition of UCBs into SFB will be a step \nforward to provide full suite of products / services, sustain competition, raise capital,  \n- 2 - \n etc. Accordingly, this scheme has been introduced for voluntary transition of a UCB \ninto SFB by way of transfer of as sets and liabilities.  \n \n \nChapter II  \nGeneral modalities of the Scheme \n \nUnder the scheme UCBs with a good track record shall be eligible to voluntarily \ntransit into a SFB.  Eligible UCB shall identify promoters in the manner as set out \nsubsequently in the s cheme for making an application to RBI f or transition to SFB \nunder the s cheme.  After due diligence exercise, RBI will issue an in- principle \napproval for transitioning of the UCB into SFB , subject to,  compliance with the \nrequirements mentioned in the scheme a nd will allow a maximum period of 18 \nmonths for commencement of business as SFB. The promoters shall incorporate a \npublic limited company under the Companies Act, 2013 having the word \u2018bank\u2019 in its \nname after receiving the in- principle approval from RBI. The board of directors of the \ncompany shall have required experience and shall meet RBI\u2019s \u2018fit and proper\u2019 criteria. \nThe above company shall enter into an agreement with UCB for transfer of assets \nand liabilities, to be executed at a future date (after issuance of SFB licence).  The \npromoters shall then approach RBI for issuance of SFB licence, with evidence of \nfunds available for infusion as equity in any acceptable form, so as to ensure that the \nSFB commences  operations  with a minimum net worth of Rs.1 bil lion and minimum \npromoters\u2019 contribution of 26% of the paid- up equity capital.  The licence application \nwill be processed in accordance with the guidelines dated November 27 , 2014 for \nlicensing of SFBs in the private sector, subject to, what is stated in t his Scheme. RBI \nwill issue SFB licence at this stage followed by execution of the slump sale \nagreement to transfer the assets and liabilities of the UCB to the new company. The \nlicence will be effective only after transfer of assets and liabilities of the UCB to the \nSFB and meeting, inter alia , the minimum net worth requirement prescribed for \nSFBs. The promoters will ensure that there is no business disruption during the \nprocess of transfer of assets and liabilities. On transition into a SFB, it will be \nsubjected to all the norms as applicable to SFBs including maintenance of CRAR of \n15% on a continuous basis . The UCB will surrender its banking licence to RBI. The \nresultant Co-operative Society will be wound up in due course.  \n \n \n2. Base financial benchmarks f or eligibility  \nUCBs with a minimum net worth of Rs.500 million and maintaining Capital to Risk \n(Weighted) Assets Ratio of 9% and above are eligible to apply for voluntary transition \nto SFB under this scheme.    \n \n \n \n  \n- 3 - \n 3.

Capital requirement  \nThe minimum net worth of the proposed SFB shall be Rs.1 billion from the date of \ncommencement of business. As small finance banks are required to maintain a \nminimum capital adequacy ratio of 15 per cent of its risk weighted assets (RWA) on \na continuous basis, availability of adequate capital shall be ensured. Pr omoters shall \nmaintain at least 26% of the paid- up equity capital.  \n \n5.

The detailed guidelines in this regard are as under .  \n  \n2. All scheduled commercial banks  (excluding Regional Rural Banks and Small Finance \nBanks)  may engage  with N BFC-ND-SIs (hereinafter referred to as NBFC)  to co-originate  \nloans for the creation of priority sector assets. The arrangement should entail joint \ncontribution of credit at the facility level, by both lenders. It should also involve sharing of \nrisks and rewards between the bank and the NBFC for ensuring appropriate alignment of \nrespective business objectives , as per the mutually decided agreement between the bank \nand the NBFC , inter-alia, covering the essential features as indicated in Annex 1.  \n \n3. The bank  can claim priority sector status in respect of its share of credit while engaging in  \nthe co-origination arrangement. However, the priority sector assets on the bank \u2019s books \nshould at all times be without recourse to the NBFC. Further , the loans extended by foreign \nbanks  under the co-origination framework  shall be restricted only to loans qualifying as  \npriority sector assets.   \n \nCo-origination of loans by Banks and NBFCs for lending to priority  sector  \n \n4. Based on the respective interest rates and proportion of risk sharin g, a single blended \ninterest rate should be offered to the ultimate borrower  in case of fixed rate loans . In the \nscenario of floating interest rates , a weighted average of the benchmark interest rates  in \nproportion to the respective loan contribution, should be offered.  The interest rate charged \nby the bank for its portion of credit, shall be subject to applicable directions on interest rates \non advances . Further, the NBFC -MFIs  which are categorized as NBFC -ND- SIs, are also \nrequired to abide by the pricing of credit and other applicable guidelines for loans covered \nunder \u201cQualifying Assets\u201d regarding their contribution towards the co-originated loan. It is \nenvisaged that the benefit of low cost funds from banks and lower  cost of operations of \nNBFC would be passed on to the ultimate beneficiary through the blended rate/ weighted \naverage rate. In this regard, banks/NBFCs shall provide all the information like loan details \nincluding interest rate and other charges, details of risk sharing arrangement,  etc., as and \nwhen called for by the Reserve Bank of India.  \n \n5. While engaging in co -origination arrangements, inter-alia, the bank / NBFC  is required to \nadhere to extant guidelines on outsourcing of financial services. Accordingly, though the \nNBFC is expected to source loans as per the mutually agreed parameters between the bank \nand the NBFC, bank shall not outsource its part of credit sanction component to the NBFC.  \n \n6. With regard to grievance redressal, any complaint registered by a borrower with the \nNBFC/ bank  shall also be shared with the bank / NBFC ; in case the complaint is not resolved \nwithin 30 days, the borrower would have the option to escalate the same with the concerned \nBanking Ombudsman/  Ombudsman for NBFCs . \n \n7. The bank / NBFC  shall formulate a Board approved policy for entering into a co-origination \nagreement with the NBFC/ bank . The loans under the co-origination agreement shall be \nsubjected to periodic verification by bank\u2019s / NBFC\u2019s  internal auditors to ensure adherence to \nits internal guidelines, terms of the agreement and extant regulatory requirements. \n \nYours faithfully, \n \n \n(Gautam Prasad Borah) \nChief General Manager -in-Charge \n \nEncl: As above  Annex 1  \n1 | Page  \n Essential Features of Co -origination  Model  between Banks and NBFC -ND-SIs \n \nI.

An indicative \nillustration for arriving at the  single  blended/ weighted average rate is detailed in Annex  2. \nHowever, notwithstanding the charging of a single blended / weighted average rate of interest \nfrom the borrower, the repayment/ recovery of interest shall be shared between the bank and \nthe NBFC in proportion to their share of credit  and interest .  \n \nIII. Know Your Customer (KYC):  The co- originating lenders  shall adhere to applicable  KYC/ AML \nguidelines, as prescribed by Department of Banking Regulation  (DBR) / Department of Non-\nBanking Regulation (DNBR)  and may also be guided by Para 14 of Master Directions on \nKYC, issued by D BR. \n \nIV. Loan Sanction:  The NBFC shall recommend to the Bank proposals as found relevant for joint  \nlending. The lenders shall be entitled to independently assess the risks and requirements of \nthe applicant borrowers . The loan agreement would be tripartite in nature, wherein, both the \nBank and the NBFC shall be parti es as lenders to the loan agreement with the customer.  \n \nV. Common Account:  The Bank and the NBFC shall open an escrow type common account for \npooling respective loan contributions for disbursal as well  as to appropriate loan repayments \nfrom borrowers , without  holding the funds for usage of float. Regarding loan balances, the \nNBFC / Bank  shall maintain individual borrower\u2019s accounts and should also be able to \ngenerate and share a single unified statement to the customer, through appropriate sharing of \nrequired information with the Bank / NBFC .  \n \nVI.

Assignment/ Change in Loan Limits : Any assignment of loans by any of the lenders  can be \ndone only with the mutual consent of both the l enders.  Further, any change in loan limit of the \nco-originated facility can be done only with the mutual consent of both the lenders .  \n \nX. Grievance Redressal:  It shall be the responsibility of the NBFC to explain to end borrower \nregarding the difference between products offered through the co- origination model as \ncompared to its own products. The front-ending lender  will be primarily responsible for \nproviding the required customer service and grievance redressal to the borrower.  However, \nany complaint registered by a borrower with the NBFC and/or  bank shall also be shared with \nthe bank/ NBFC  and in case, the complaint is not resolved within 30 days, the borrower would \nhave the option to escalate the same with concerned Banking Ombudsman/ Ombudsman for \nNBFCs . \n \nXI.

An undertaking by the CEO of the applicant company that it has not been subject to \nlitigation or adverse regulatory action or punitive acti on in the last 5 years  \n Annex  II \n \nACCOUNTING GUIDELINES FOR REPO TRANSACTIONS FOR ENTITIES \nREGULATED BY THE RESERVE BANK  \n \n1.  Applicability of the accounting guidelines : The revised accounting \nguidelines will apply to repo transactions in government securities and corporate \ndebt securities  including the tri -party repo in such securities .   \n2. Market participants may undertake repos from any of the three categor ies of \ninvestments, viz.,  Held for Trading,  Available for Sale  and Held t o Maturity.  \n3. The economic essence of a repo transaction, viz., borrowing (lending) of funds \nby selling (purchasing) securities shall be reflected in the books of the repo \nparticipants, by accounting the same as collateralized lending and borrowing \ntransaction, with an agreement to repurchase, on the agreed terms.    Accordingly, \nthe repo seller, i.e., borrower of funds in the first leg, shall not exclude the \nsecurities sold under repo but continue to carry the same in his investment account \n(please see the illustration given  in the Appendix II -2) reflecting his continued \neconomic interest in the securities during the repo period.   On the other hand, the \nrepo buyer, i.e., lender of funds in the first leg, shall not include the securities \npurchased under repo in his investment account but show it in a separat e sub-\nhead (please see the Appendix II -1).  The securities would, however, be \ntransferred from the repo seller to repo buyer in case of repos as in the case of \nnormal outright sale/purchase transactions and such movement of securities shall \nbe reflected using the Repo/Reverse Repo Accounts and contra entries. In the \ncase of repo seller, the Repo Account is credited in the first leg for the securities \nsold (funds received), while the same is reversed when the securities are \nrepurchased in the second leg.   Similarly, in the case of repo buyer, the Reverse \nRepo Account is debited for the amount of securities purchased (funds lent) and \nthe same is reversed in the second leg when the securities are sold back.  \n4. The first leg of  the repo transaction should be contracted at the prevailing market \nrates. The reversal (second leg) of the transaction shall be such that the difference between the consideration amounts of first and second legs should reflect the repo \ninterest.  \n5. The ac counting principles to be followed while accounting for repo / reverse repo \ntransactions are as under:  \n(i) Coupon /Discount  \na. The repo seller shall continue to accrue the coupon/discount on the \nsecurities sold under repo even during the repo period while the repo buyer \nshall not accrue the same.  \nb. In case the interest payment date of the security offered under repo falls \nwithin the repo period, the coupons received by the buyer of the security \nshould be passed on to the seller of the security on the date of receipt as the \ncash consideration payable by the seller in the second leg does not include \nany intervening cash flows.  \n(ii) Repo Interest Income / Expenditure  \nAfter the second leg of the repo / reverse repo transaction is over,  \na. The difference between consideration amounts of the first leg and second \nleg of the repo shall be reckoned as Repo Interest Income / Expenditure in \nthe books of the r epo buyer / seller respectively ; and  \nb. The balance outstanding in the Repo Interest Income / Expenditure \naccount should be transferred to the Profit and Loss account as an income or \nan expenditure. As regards repo / reverse repo transactions  outstanding on \nthe balance sheet date , only the accrued income / expenditure  till the balance \nsheet date should be taken to the Profit and Loss account. Any repo income / \nexpenditure for the remaining period should be reckoned for the next \naccounting period.  \n(iii) Marking to Market  \nThe repo seller shall continue to mark to market the securities sold under \nrepo transactions  as per the  investment classification of the security. To \nillustrate,   in case the securities sold by banks under repo transactions are out \nof the   Available for Sale category, then the mark to market valuation for such \nsecurities should be done at least once a quarter. For entities which do not \nfollow any investment classification norms, the valuation for securities sold under repo transactions may be in accordance with the valuation norms \nfollowed by them in respect of securities of similar nature.  \n6. Accounting Methodology  \nThe accounting methodology to be followed along with the illustrations is given \nin Appendix  II-1 and II-2.  Participants using more stringent accounting principles \nmay continue using the same principles.  \n7. Classification of Accounts  \nBanks shall classify the balances in Repo A/c under Schedule 4 under item I (ii) or \nI (iii) as appropriate. Similarly, the balances in Reverse Repo A/c shall be classified \nunder  Schedule 7 under item I (ii) a or I (ii) b as appropriate. The balances in Repo \ninterest expenditure A/c and Reverse Repo interest income A/c shall be classified \nunder Schedule 15 (under item II or III  as appropriate) and under Schedule 13 \n(under item III or IV as appropriate) respectively.   The balance sheet classification \nfor other participants shall be governed by the guidelines issued by the respective \nregulators.  \n8.  Disclosure  \nThe following disclo sures should be made by banks in the \u201cNotes on Accounts\u2019 to \nthe Balance Sheet:  \n Minimum \noutstanding \nduring the \nyear Maximum \noutstandin\ng during \nthe year  Daily Average \noutstanding \nduring the \nyear Outstanding as \non \nMarch 31  \nSecurities sold under \nrepo \ni. Government                \nsecurities  \nii. Corporate debt \nsecurities  \niii. Any other securities      \nSecurities purchased \nunder reverse repo  \ni. Government  securities  \nii. Corporate debt \nsecurities  \niii. Any other securities      \n Appendix II -1 \nRecommended Accounting Methodology for accounting of Repo / Reverse \nRepo transactions  \ni The following accounts may be maintained, viz. , i) Repo Account, ii) \nReverse Repo Account, iii) Reverse Repo Interest Income Account, iv) \nRepo Interest Expenditure Account v) Reverse Repo Interest Receivable \nAccount and vi) Repo Interest Payable Account.  \nii In addition to the above, the following 'contra' accounts may also be \nmaintained, viz. , i) Securities Sold under Repo Account, (ii) Securities \nPurchased under Reverse Repo Account, (iii) Securities Receivable under \nRepo Account and (iv) Securities Deliverable under Reverse Repo  \nAccount.  \nRepo  \ni In a repo transaction, the securities should be sold in the first leg at market \nrelated prices and re- purchased in the second leg at the same prices. The \nconsideration amount in the second leg would, however, include the repo \ninterest. The sale and repurchase should be reflected in the Repo Account.  \nii Though the securities are not excluded from the repo seller's investment \naccount and not included in the repo buyer's investment account, the \ntransfer of securities shall be reflected by using the necessary contra \nentries.  \nReverse Repo  \ni In a reverse repo trans action, the securities should be purchased in the first \nleg at prevailing market prices and sold in the second leg at the same \nprices. The consideration amount in the second leg would, however, \ninclude the repo interest. The purchase and sale should be ref lected in the \nReverse Repo Account.  \nii The balances in the Reverse Repo Account shall not be a part of the \nInvestment Account for balance sheet purposes but can be reckoned for SLR purposes if the securities acquired under reverse repo transactions \nare approv ed securities.  \nOther aspects relating to Repo/Reverse Repo  \ni In case the interest payment date of the securities sold under repo falls \nwithin the repo period, the coupons received by the buyer of the security \nshould be passed on to the seller on the date of receipt as the cash \nconsideration payable by the seller in the second leg does not include any \nintervening cash flows.  \nii To reflect the accrual of interest in respect of the outstanding repo \ntransactions at the end of the accounting period, appropriate entri es should \nbe passed in the Profit and Loss account to reflect Repo Interest Income / \nExpenditure in the books of the buyer / seller respectively and the same \nshould be debited / credited as an expenditure payable/income receivable. \nSuch entries passed should be reversed on the first working day of the next \naccounting  period.  \niii Repo seller continues to accrue coupon/discount as the case may be, even \nduring the repo period while the repo buyer shall not accrue the same.  \n \nIllustrative examples are given in Appendix II -2.Appendix II -2 \n \nIllustrative examples for accounting of Repo / Reverse repo transactions  \n \nWhile in the body of the Direction , the term \"repo\" is used generically to \ninclude both repo and reverse repo (which is simply a mirror image of a repo \ntransaction), in this Appendix  the accounting guidelines have been set out \nseparately for repo and reverse repo for clarity.  \n \nA.

The Direction will be updated from time to time as and when fresh instructions\nare issued.\n3.T\nhis Master Direction has been placed on RBI website at www.rbi.org.in .\nYours faithfully,  \n(Manas Ranjan Mohanty ) \nChief General Manager  \nEncl : As above Annex  \n  \n1. Penal interest for Delayed Reporting / Wrong Reporting / Non-Reporting of \nCurrency Chest Transactions  \n1.1  Reporting of Currency Chest Transactions   \nThe minimum amount of deposit into / withdrawal  from currency chest will be ` 1,00,000  \nand thereaft er, in multiples of  ` 50,000.  \n1.2  Time limit for Reporting \n1.2.1  The currency chests should invariably report all transactions through ICCOMS on \nthe same day by 9 PM by uploading data through the Secured Website (SWS) to \ntheir respective link offices. Link offices should invariably report the consolidated \nposition to the Issue Offices latest by 11 PM on the same day.  \n1.2.2  The Sub -Treasury Offices (STOs) should report all transactions directly to the \nIssue Office of the Reserve Bank by 11 PM on the same day.  \n1.2.3  Relaxatio n in respect of strike period in banks  \nRelaxation in the reporting period on account of general  / specific strike situation \nwill be considered on case- to-case basis.  \n1.3  Levy of penal interest for delays  \n1.3.1  In the event of delay in reporting currency chest transactions, penal interest at the \nrate indicated in paragraph 3 of this circular will be levied on the amount due from \nthe chest holding bank for the period of delay. Penal interest will be calculated on \nT+0 basis i.e. penal interest will be levied in respect of transactions not reported \nby Link Office to the Issue Office by 11 PM on the same business day. However, \nReserve Bank may at its discretion grant appropriate grace period in the matter of \nlevy of penal interest.  \n1.3.2  Penal interest will al so be charged for delay in submission of chest slips in the \ncase of single chest / STOs directly linked to Issue Department of the circle.  \n1.4  Wrong reporting and levy of penal interest  \nPenal interest will be levied in respect of all cases of wrong repor ting in the same manner \ntill the date of receipt of corrected advice by Reserve Bank. As debits/credits to banks' \ncurrent accounts are raised on the basis of the figures reported in the Link Office \nStatements, penal interest will invariably be levied in al l cases of wrong reporting in the \nLink Office Statements even if the reporting was done correctly in the chest slips. It is \nexpected that Link Offices would ensure the correctness of figures reported by the \nrespective currency chests.  Particular care shoul d be taken to ensure that remittances of \nfresh notes/notes to the currency chests are not reported as 'deposit' transactions in the \nLink Office Statements . 1.5 Reporting of Soi led note remittances to RBI / diversion to other chests   \nSoiled note remittances  to RBI /  diversion to other currency chest/s should not be shown \nas withdrawal by chest/s / link offices. In case such remittances are wrongly reported as \n'withdrawals', a penalty of ` 50,000 will be levied irrespective of the value of remittance \nand peri od of such wrong reporting.  \n1.6 Delayed reporting where currency chests had \u201cNet Deposit\u201d  \nPenal interest at the prevailing rate for delayed reporting of the instances where the \ncurrency chest had reported \u201cnet deposit\u201d may not be charged.  However, in order to \nensure proper discipline in reporting in reporting currency chest transactions, a flat \npenalty of ` 50,000 may be levied on the currency chests for delayed reporting \nirrespective of the value of net deposit.  \n1.7 Reporting of diversions in ICCOMS   \nAs regards reporting of diversion/s in ICCOMS, they must be reported in the column \"2A \nand 4 A\" i.e . the chest receiving the diversi on should report under 2 A and the remitting \nchest should report the amount under 4A in the chest slip without any delay. Divers ion \namounts, even to the chest of the same bank should not be reported under \"Withdrawal\" \nand \"Deposit\" columns i.e. 4E and 2E (which are for currency transfer transactions).   \n1.8  Maximum penal interest to be charged   \nThere is no stipulation regarding the  maximum amount of penal interest leviable for \nwrong  / delayed reporting. As the intention is to ensure timely and correct reporting of \nchest transactions, penal interest will be recovered in all applicable cases, irrespective of \nthe amount of the transact ion concerned / amount of penal interest subject to rounding \noff the penal interest amount to the nearest Rupee.  \n2. Penal interest for inclusion of ineligible amounts in the currency chest \nbalances  \n2.1 Penal interest will be levied in all cases where the bank has enjoyed 'ineligible' \ncredit in its current account with Reserve Bank on account of wrong reporting / delayed \nreporting  / non-reporting of transactions.  Penal measures will also be taken in cases of \nshortages in chest balances / remittances, short ages due to pilferage / frauds, counterfeit \nbanknotes detected in chest balances / remittances as per the prevailing \u201c scheme of \nPenalties \u201d.  \n2.2 Further, only cash held in the custody of joint custodians and 'freely available' to \nthem is eligible for inclu sion in the chest balances. Thus, cash kept for safe custody in \nsealed covers for whatever reasons/cash in trunks/bins under the lock and key of any \nofficial/s other than the Joint Custodians or bearing a third lock put by any official in \naddition to the t wo locks of the Joint Custodians is not eligible for being included in the \nchest balances. If such amounts are included in the chest balances, these will be treated \nas instances of wrong reporting and will attract penal interest at the rate specified in para \n3. 2.3 In all the above cases  (excepting shortages in chest balances / remittances, \nshortages due to pilferage / frauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest balances / \nremittances), penal interest will be levied from the date of inclusion of 'inelig ible' amounts \nin chest balances till the exclusion of such amounts from chest balances.   Penal \nmeasures for shortages in chest balances / remittances, shortages due to pilferage / \nfrauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest balances / remittances will be taken on \nthe basis of prevailing \u201c scheme of Penalties \u201d.  \n3. Rate of penal interest  \nPenal interest shall be levied at the rate of 2% over the prevailing Bank Rate for the \nperiod of delayed reporting/wrong reporting/non- reporting  /inclusion of ineligible amounts \nin chest balances.  \n4. Levy of penal interest in respect of currency chests at treasuries \nThe above instructions shall be applicable to currency chests at treasury/sub- treasury \noffices also.  \n5. Representations  \n5.1 As the sole criterion for levy of p enal interest for delayed reporting is the number \nof days of delay, there should ordinarily be no occasion for banks to request for \nreconsideration of the Reserve Bank's decision in individual cases.

Further, we will take a serious view of all such lapses.   \n-------------------------  ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/62MD_05072018A0D59917AE714AF19E633B28C0D9DD9B.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jul 05, 2018", "info": " \nRBI/201 8-19/11 \nDCM (CC) No.G -4/03.44.01/2018 \u201319                         July 3, 2018  \n \nThe Chairman & Managing Director  \nChief Executive Officers   \nAll Banks  \n \nMadam / Dear Sir , \n \n \nMaster Circular \u2013  Scheme of Penalties for bank branches based on performance in \nrendering customer service to the members of public  \n \nPlease refer to the Circular DCM (CC) No.G -3/03.44 .01/2017 -18 dated October  12, 2017  \non the scheme of penalties . \n \n \n2.

This Master Circular consolidates the relevant guideli nes issued by the Bank on Kisan \nCredit Card scheme upto June 30, 2018 as listed in the Appendix . \n2. The Master Circular has been placed on the RBI website http://www.rbi.org.in .  \nYours faithfully , \n \n(Sonali Sen Gupta) \nChief General Manager  \nEncl: As above  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 2 of 15 \n Master Circular on the Kisan Credit Card (KCC)  Scheme  \n 1 Introduction  \n The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was introduced in 1998  for issue of Kisan Credit Cards \nto farmers on the basis of their holdings for uniform adoption by the banks so that farmers \nmay use them to readily purchase agriculture inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc. \nand draw cash for their production needs. The scheme was further extended for the \ninvestment cr edit requirement of farmers viz. allied and non -farm activities  in the year 2004 . \nThe scheme  was further revisited in 2012 by a working Group under the Chairmanship of Shri \nT. M. Bhasin, CMD, Indian Bank with a view to simplify the scheme and facilitate is sue of \nElectronic Kisan Credit Cards. The s cheme provides  broad guidelines to banks for \noperationalizing the KCC scheme. Implementing banks will have the discretion to adopt the \nsame to suit institution/location specific requirements . \n2  \n \n  Applicability of the Scheme  \nThe Kisan Credit Card Scheme detailed in the ensuing paragraphs is to be implemented by \nCommercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks and Cooperatives . \n3   Objective  / Purpose   \nThe Kisan Credit Card s cheme aims at providing adequate and timely  credit support from the \nbanking system under a single window with flexible and simplified procedure to the farmers \nfor their cultivation and other needs as indicated below : \n a. To meet the short term credit requirements for cultivation of crops ; \n b. Post-harvest  expenses ; \n c. Produ ce m arketing loan ; \n d. Consumption requirements of farmer household ; \n e. Working capital for maintenance of farm assets and ac tivities allied to agriculture;  \n    f.   Investment credit requirement for agriculture and allied  activities .   \n  Note : The aggregate of components \u2018a\u2019 to \u2018e\u2019  above will form the short term credit limit \nportion and the aggregate of components under \u2018f\u2019 will form the long term credit limit \nportion.  \n4 Eligibility  \n i. Farmers - individual /joint borrow ers who are owner cultivators ; \n ii. Tenant farmers, oral lessees & share c roppers ; \n iii. Self Help Groups (SHGs) or Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) of f armers including tenant \nfarmers, share croppers etc.  \n \n Page 3 of 15 \n 5 Fixation of credit limit / Loan amount  \n The c redit limit under the Kisan Credit Card may be fixed as under :  \n 5.1 All farmers other than marginal farmers1 : \n  5.1.1 The short term limit t o be arrived for the first year ( For cultivating  single crop in \na year ): \n   Scale of finance for the crop (as d ecided by District Level Technical \nCommittee) x Extent of area cultivated + 10 % of limit towards post -\nharvest/household / consumption requirements + 20% of limit towards repairs \nand maintenance expenses of farm assets + crop insurance and/or  accident \ninsur ance including PAIS, health insurance & asset insurance. \n  5.1.2 Limit for second & subsequent year  \n  First year limit for crop cultivation purpose arrived at as above plus 10% of the \nlimit towards cost escalation / increase in scale of finance for every  successive \nyear (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year) and estimated t erm loan component for the \ntenure of Kisan Credit Card, i.e., five years. (Illustration I ) \n  5.1.3 For cultivating  more than one crop in a year  \n The limit is to be fixed as above depending upon the crops cultivated as per \nproposed cropping pattern for the first year  plus a n additional 10% of the limit \ntowards cost escalation / increase in scale of finance for every successive year \n(2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year). It  is assumed that the farmer adopts the same \ncropping pattern for the succeeding four years. In case the cropping pattern \nadopted by the farmer is changed in the subsequent year, the limit may be \nreworked. (Illustration I ) \n  5.1.4 Term loan  for investment  \nThe ter m loan for investment is to be made towards land development, minor \nirrigation, purchase of farm equipment and allied agricultural activities. The \nbanks may fix the quantum of credit for term and working capital lim it for \nagricultural and allied activities, etc., based on the unit cost of the asset/s \nproposed to be acquired by the farmer, the allied activities already being \nundertaken on the farm, the bank's judgment on repayment capacity vis -a-vis \ntotal loan burden devolving on the farmer, including existing loan obligations. \n   The long term loan limit  should be  based on the proposed investment (s) during \nthe five year period and the bank's perception on the repaying capacity of the \nfarmer . \n \n                                                            \n1 Farmers with landholding of up to 1 hectare (Marginal Farmers). Farmers w ith a landholding of more than 1 hectare and up to 2 hectares \n(Small Farmers).  \n Page 4 of 15 \n  \n  5.1.5 Maximum Permis sible Limit  \n   The short term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the estimated long term \nloan requirement will be the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) and  is to be  \ntreated as the Kisan Credit Card l imit. \n  5.1.6 Fixation of Sub -limits  \n   i. Short term loans and term loans are governed by different interest rates. At \npresent, short term crop loans  upto \u20b9 3 lakh are covered under Interest \nSubvention Scheme/Prompt Repayment Incentive scheme of the Government \nof India2. Further, repayment schedule and norms are different for short term \nand term loans. Hence, in order to have operational and accounting \nconvenience, the card limit is to be bifurcated into separate sub -limits for short \nterm cash credit limit cum savings account  and term loans . \n   ii. Draw ing limit  for short term cash credit should be fixed based on the \ncropping pattern . The amount(s) for crop production, repair  and maintenance of \nfarm assets and consumption may be allowed to be drawn as per the \nconvenience of the farmer. In case the revisi on of scale of finance for any year \nby the district level technical committee exceeds the notional hike of 10% \ncontemplated while fixing the five year limit, a revised  drawable limit may be \nfixed in consultation with the farmer . In case such revisions requ ire the card \nlimit itself to be enhanced (4th or 5th year), the same may be done and the \nfarmer be so advised .  \niii. For term loans, installments may be allowed to be withdrawn based on the \nnature of investment and repayment schedule drawn as per the econo mic life \nof the proposed investments. It is to be ensured that at any point of time the \ntotal liability should be within the drawing limit of the concerned year . \niv. Wherever the card limit / liability so arrived warrants additional security, the \nbanks may  take suitable collateral as per their policy.  \n     \n 5.2 For Marginal Farmers  \n  A flexible limit of \u20b9  10,000 to \u20b9 50,000 may be provided (as Flexi KCC) based on the \nland holding and crops grown including post -harvest warehouse storage related credit \nneeds and other farm expenses, consumption needs, etc., plus small term loan \ninvestmen t(s) like purchase of farm equipment( s), establ ishing mini dairy/ backyard \npoultry as per assessment of the Branch Manager without relating it to the value of \nland. The composite KCC limit is to be fixed for a period of five years on this basis.  \n                                                            \n2 Please refer to guidelines on Interest Subvention Scheme on crop loans as announced by GoI and issued by RBI from time to time . Page 5 of 15 \n    \nWhereve r higher limit is required due to change in cropping pattern and / or scale of \nfinance, the limit may be arrived at as per th e estimation indicated at para 4 .1  \n(Illustration II ) \n6 Disbursement  \n 6.1 The short term compon ent of the KCC limit is in the nature of revolving cash credit \nfacility. There should be no restriction in number of debits and credits. The drawi ng limit \nfor the current season/ year could be allowed to be drawn using any of the following \ndelivery channels . \n  i. operation  through branch ; \n  ii. operation  using c heque facility ; \n  iii. withdrawal through ATM /d ebit cards  \n  iv. operation  through Business Correspondents and \u2018banking outlet/part -time \nbanking outlet \u20193 \n  v. operation throu gh PoS available in Sugar Mills/ Contract farming companies, \netc., especially for tie -up advances ; \n  vi. operations through PoS available with input dealers ; \n  vii. Mobile  based transfer transactions at agricultural input dealers and mandies.  \nNote  : (v),(vi) & (vii ) to be in troduced as early as possible so as to reduce \ntransaction costs of both the bank as well as the farmer . \n     6.2 The long term loan for investment purposes may be drawn as per installment fixed.  \n7  Issue of Electronic Kisan Credit Card s  \nAll new KCC mus t be issued as smart card cum debit card as laid down in Part II of the \nAnnex. Further, at the time of renewal of existing KCC; farmers must be issued smart card \ncum debit card.  \nThe short term credit  limit and the term loan limit are two distinct component s of the \naggregate KCC limit bearing different rates of interest and repayment periods. Until a \ncomposite card could be issued with appropriate software to separately account transactions \nin the sub limits, two separate electronic cards may be issued for all new/renewed cards . \n8 Validity/ Renewal  \n i. Banks may determine the validity period of KCC and its periodic review . \n ii. The review may result in continuation of the facility, enhancement of  limit or \ncancellation of the limit/ withdrawal of the facility  depending upon increase in cropping \narea/ pattern and performance of the borrower. \n                                                            \n3 DBR\u2019s Circular on Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy - Revision of Guidelines  Page 6 of 15 iii. When the  bank has granted extension and/ or re-schedule the period of repayment on \naccount of natural calamities affecting the farmer, the period for reckoning the sta tus of \noperations as satisfactory or otherwise would get extended together with the extended \namount of limit. When the proposed extension is beyond one crop season, the \naggregate of debits for which extension is granted is to be transferred to a separate \nterm loan account with stipulation for repayment in installments.\n9 Rate of Interest (ROI) :  \nThe rate of i nterest will be  as stipulated in DBR Master Directions on Interest Rate on \nAdvances . \n10 Repayment Period :  \n10.1 The repayment period may be fixed  by banks as per the anticipated harvesting and \nmarketing period for the crops for which the loan has been granted.  \n10.2 The term loan component will be normally repayable within a period of 5 years \ndepending on the type of acti vity/investment as per the  existing guidelines applicable  \nfor investment credit.  \n10.3 Financing banks may, at their discretion, provide longer repayment period for term loan \ndepending on the type of investment.  \n11 Margin  \nTo be decided by banks . \n12 Security  \n12.1 Security wil l be applicable as per RBI guidelines prescribed from time to time.  \n12.2 Security requirement may be as under :  \ni. Hypothecation of crops :  For KCC  limit upto \u20b9 1.00 lakh  banks are to waive\nmargin/security requirements .\nii. With tie -up for recovery : Banks may  consider sanctioning loans on \nhypothecation of crops up to card limit of \u20b9 3.00 lakh without insisting on \ncollateral security.\niii. Collateral security : Collateral security  may be obtained at the discretion o f Bank\nfor loan limits above \u20b9 1.00 lakh in case of non-tie -up and above \u20b9 3.00 lakh in \ncase of tie -up advances.\niv. In states where banks have the facility of on -line creation of charge on the land \nrecords, the same shall be ensured.Page 7 of 15 \n 13. Other features  \nUniformity to be adopted in  respect of following : \n 13.1 The applicable interest s ubvention / incentive for prompt repayment4 as adv ised by \nGovernment of India and/ or State Governments. The bankers will give adequate \npublicity of the  facility  so that maximum farmers may benefit from the scheme.  \n 13.2  Besides the mandatory crop insurance, the KCC holder should hav e the option to avail \nthe benefit of any type of a sset insurance, accident insurance (including PAIS), h ealth \ninsurance (wherever product is available) and have premium paid through his /her KCC \naccount. Premium has to be borne by the farmer/bank according to the terms of the \nscheme. Farmer beneficiaries should be made aware of the insurance cover available \nand their consent (except in case of crop insurance, it being mandator y) is to be \nobtained, at the application stage itself.  \n 13.3 A one -time documentation5 at the first time of availment of KCC loan and thereafter \nsimple declaration (about crops grown/ proposed) by farmer from the second year \nonwards.  \n \n14 Classification of  account as NPA :  \n 14.1 The extant prudential norms on income recognition, asset -classification and \nprovisioning6 will apply for loans granted under the KCC Scheme.  \n 14.2 Charging of interest is to be done uniformly as is applicable to agricultural advan ces. \n15 Processing fee , inspection charges and other charges  may be decided by banks.  \n16 Other conditions while implementing the revised guidelines of KCC Scheme :  \n 16.1 In case the farmer applies for loan against the wa rehouse receipt of his produce, the \nbanks would consider such requests as per the established procedure and guidelines. \nHowever, when such loans are sanctioned, these should be linked with the crop loan \naccount, if any , and the crop loan outstanding in the account could be settled at the \nstage of disbursal of the pledge loan, if the farmer  so desires.  \n 16.2 The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) will design the KCC card to be \nadopted by all the banks with their branding.  \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.  \n \n \n                                                            \n4 Currently not applicable to Small Finance Banks/urban & metro  branches of Private Sector Banks.  \n5 Documentation as per banks\u2019 internal guidelines  \n6 DBR\u2019s Master Circular  on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning Norms  Page 8 of 15 \n  \nIllustration I \n A.

Till such time, UIDAI becomes widespread, if the \nbanks want to get started without inter -operability using their existing centralized bio metric \ninfrastructure, banks may do so.  \n Banks may choose to issue EMV (Europay, MasterCard  and VISA, a global sta ndard for \ninteroperation of integrated circuit cards) and RUPAY  compliant chip cards with magnetic \nstripe and pin with ISO IIN.  \n Further, the biometric authentication and smart cards may follow the common open standards \nprescribed by IDRBT and IBA. This w ill enable them to transact seamlessly with input dealers \nas also enable them to have the sales proceeds credited to their accounts when they sell \ntheir output at mandies, procurement centers, etc.  \n  3 Delivery Channels :  \n The following delivery channel s shall be put in place to start with so that the Kisan Credit \nCard is used by the farmers to effectively transact their operations in their KCC account.  \n 1. Withdrawal through ATMs / Micro ATM  \n 2. Withdrawal through BCs using smart cards.  \n 3. PoS machi ne through input dealers  \n 4. Mobile Banking with IMPS capabilities / IVR  \n 5. Aadhaar enabled Cards.  \n4. Mobile Banking / Other Channels :  \n Provide Mobile banking functionality for KCC Cards / Accounts as well along with Interbank \nMobile Payment Service (IMPS of NPCI) capability to allow customers to use this inter -\noperable IMPS for funds transfer between banks and also to do merchant payment \ntransactions as additional capability for purchases of agricultural inputs.  \n This mobile banking should ideally b e on Unstructured Supplementary Data (USSD) platform \nfor wider and safer acceptance. However, the banks can also offer this on other fully \nencrypted modes (application based or SMS based) to make use of the recent relaxation on Page 14 of 15 \n transaction limits. Banks ca n also offer unencrypted mobile banking subject to RBI \nregulations on transaction limits.  \n It is necessary that Mobile based transaction platforms enabling transactions in the KCC use \neasy to use SMS based solution with authentication thru' MPIN. Such sol utions also need to \nbe enabled on IVR in local language to ensure transparency and security. Such mobile based \npayment systems should be encouraged by all the banks by creating awareness and by \ndoing proper customer education.  \n With the existing infrastru cture available with banks, all KCC holders should be provided with \nany one or a combination of the following types of cards :  \n  * Debit cards (magnetic stripe card with PIN) enabling farmers to operate the \nlimit through all banks ATMs / Micro ATMs  \n  * Debit Cards with magnetic stripe and biometric authentication.  \n  * Smart cards for doing transactions through PoS machines held by Business \nCorrespondents, input dealers, traders and Mandies.  \n  * EMV compliant chip cards with magnetic stripe and pin with ISO IIN.  \n In addition, the banks having a call centre / Inter active Voice Response (IVR), may provide \nSMS based mobile banking with a call back facility from bank for mobile PIN (MPIN) \nverification through IVR, thus making a secured SMS based mobile bank ing facility available \nto card holders.  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Page 15 of 15 \n APPENDIX  \nList of Circulars consolidated in the \n Master Circular on \u2018Kisan Credit Card\u2019  \n \nSL Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1 RPCD.No.PLFS.BC.20/05.05.09/98 -99 05.08.1998  Kisan Credit Card  \n2 RPCD.PLNFS.No .BC.99/05.05.09/99 -\n2000  06.06.2000  Kisan Credit Card Scheme - \nModification  \n3 RPCD.No.PLFS.BC./63/05.05.09/2000 -01 03.03.2001  Kisan Credit Cards  \n4 RPCD.PLFS.BC.No./64/05.05. 09/2001 -02 28.02.2002  Kisan Credit Card  \n5 RPCD.Plan.BC.No 87/04.09.01/2003 -04 18.05.2004  Credit Flow to Agriculture \u2013 \nAgricultural Loans -   Waiver \nof Margin / Security \nRequirements  \n6 RPCD.PLFS.BC.No.38/05.05.09/2004 -05 04.10.2004  Scheme to cover term loans \nfor agriculture & llied activities \nunder KCC  \n7 RPCD.PLFS.BC.No. 85/05.04.02/2009 -10 18.06.2010  Credit Flow to Agriculture \u2013 \nAgricultural Loans -   Waiver \nof Margin / Security \nRequirements  \n8 RPCD.FSD .BC.No. 77/05.05.09/2011 -12 11.05.2012  Revised Kisan Credit Card \nScheme  \n9 RPCD.

The blocks and districts  in which all the components of DAY -NRLM will be \nimplemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs, will be the \nintensive blocks and districts, whereas remaining will be non- intensive blocks and \ndistrict s. The selection of intensive dis tricts are done by the states based on the \ndemographic vulnerabilities. It will be rolled out in a phased manner over the next 7 -  8 \nyears. All blocks in the country will become intensive blocks over time. The key features \nof DAY- NRLM have been furnished i n Annex I .  \n \n2. Women SHGs and their Federations \n \n2.1 Women SHGs under DAY -NRLM consist of 10- 20 persons. In case of special SHGs \ni.e. groups in the difficult areas, groups with disabled persons, and groups formed in \nremote tribal areas, this number may be a minimum of 5 persons.  \n \n2.2 DAY- NRLM promotes affinity based women Self Help Groups (SHGs).  \n \n2.3 Only for groups to be formed with Persons with disabilities, and other special \ncategories like elders, transgenders, DAY -NRLM will have both men and women in the \nSelf-Help Groups.  3 \n  \n2.4 SHG is an informal group and registration under any Societies Act, State cooperative \nAct or a partnership firm is not mandatory vide Circular RPCD. No. Plan BC.13/PL-\n09.22/90- 91 dated July 24th, 1991. However Feder ations of Self Help Groups formed at \nvillage, Gram Panchayat, Cluster or higher level may be registered under appropriate \nacts prevailing in their States.  \n \nFinancial Assistance to the SHGs \n \n3. Revolving Fund (RF): DAY- NRLM would provide Revolving Fund (RF)  support to \nSHGs in existence for a minimum period of 3/6 months and follow the norms of good \nSHGs, i.e. they follow \u2018Panchasutra\u2019 \u2013  regular meetings, regular savings, regular internal \nlending, regular recoveries and maintenance of proper books of accounts. Only such \nSHGs that have not received any RF earlier will be provided with RF, as corpus, with a \nminimum of \u20b9 10, 000 and up to a maximum of \u20b9 15,000 per SHG. The purpose of RF is to \nstrengthen their institutional and financial management capacity and build a good credit \nhistory within the group.  \n \n4. Capital Subsidy has been discontinued under DAY -NRLM:  \nNo Capital Subsidy will be sanctioned to any SHG from the date of implementation of \nDAY- NRLM.  \n \n5. Community Investment S upport Fund (CIF)  \n \nCIF will be provided to the SHGs in the intensive blocks, routed through the Village level/ \nCluster level Federations,  to be maintained in perpetuity by the Federations. The CIF will \nbe used, by the Federations, to advance loans to the SHGs and/or to undertake the \ncommon/coll ective socio- economic activities.  \n \n6. Introduction of Interest subvention:  \n \nDAY- NRLM has a provision for interest subvention, to cover the difference between the \nLending Rate of the banks and 7%, on all credit from the banks/ financial institutions \navailed by women SHGs, for a maximum of \u20b9  3,00,000 per SHG. This will be available \nacross the country in two ways:  4 \n  \n(i) In 250 identified districts, banks will lend to the women SHGs @7% up to an \naggregated loan amount of \u20b9  3,00,000/ -.The SHGs will also get additional interest \nsubvention of 3% on pr ompt payment, reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%.  \n \n(ii) In the remaining districts also, all women SHGs under DAY -NRLM will be SHGs \nare eligible for interest subvention to the extent of difference between the lending rates \nand 7% for the loan up to \u20b9  3,00,000, subjected to the norms prescribed by the \nrespective SRLMs. This part of the scheme will be operationalized by SRLMs.  \n \n(A separate circular on October 13, 2017  was issued to all Public and Private Sector \nBanks containing the detailed guidelines on interest subvention and its operationalization \nacross the country for the year 2017 -18 along with the list of 250 identified districts  \nAnnex III . Salient features and the implementation procedure of the Scheme are \nenclosed in Annex I I. Interest subvention for subsequent years will be communicated \nseparately to the banks by GOI/RBI ). \n7. Role of banks:  \n \n7.1 Opening of Savings accounts:   \n7.1.1 Opening of Savings account of SHGs: The role of banks would commenc e with \nopening of accounts for all the Women SHGs  including members with disability  and the \nFederations of the SHGs . The SHGs engaged in promoting of savings habits among their \nmembers would be eligible to open savings bank accounts.  \nKnow Your Customer (KY C) verification of only the office bearers shall suffice for \nopening of savings bank account. Banks should not insist on Permanent Account \nNumber (PAN) of SHGs at the time of opening of account or transactions and may \naccept declaration in Form No 60 as may be required. KYC verification of all the \nmembers in the SHG can be made at the time of credit linking of SHGs. Opening of \nsavings account of all members with the bank shall not be made a prerequisite for credit \nlinkage of SHGs.   \nBanks are advised to maintain separate Savings and loan account for Self Help Groups.  \n7.1.2 Opening of Savings account of Federation of SHGs : Banks are advised to open \nsavings account of Federations of SHGs at village, Gram Panchayat, Cluster or higher 5 \n level. These accounts may be categorized as savings account for \u2018Association of \npersons\u2019.  The \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 (KYC) norms for the signatories of such accounts \nas specified from time to time by Reserve Bank of India will be applicable.  \n \n7.1.3 Transaction in Savings account of SH Gs and Federation of SHGs : SHGs  and \ntheir federations  may be encouraged to transact through their respective saving account \non regular basis. To facilitate this, banks are advised to enable transactions in jointly \noperated savings account of SHGs  and their  federations  with inter -operable facility  at \nretail outlets managed by Business Correspondent Agents. Banks are also advised to \nextend all such services to SHGs  and their federations  through Business Correspondent \nagents permitted vide circular DBOD. No.BAPD.BC.122/22.01.009/2013- 14 dated June \n24, 2014 . \n \n7.2 Lending Norms:  \n \n7.2.1 The eligibility criteria for the SHGs to avail loans:  \n \n\u2022 SHG should be in active existence at leas t since the last 6 months as per the \nbooks of account of SHGs and not from the date of opening of S/B account.  \n \n\u2022 SHG should be practicing \u2018 Panchasutras\u2019 i.e.  Regular meetings; Regular savings; \nRegular inter -loaning; Timely repayment; and Up- to-date books of accounts;  \n \n\u2022 Qualified as per grading norms fixed by NABARD. As and when the federations of \nthe SHGs come to existence, the grading exercise can be done by the \nFederations to support the Banks.  \n \n\u2022 The existing defunct SHGs are also eligible for credit if t hey are revived and \ncontinue to be active for a minimum period of 3 months.  \n \n7.2.2 Loan Application: It is advised that all banks should use the Common Loan \nApplication Forms recommended by Indian Bank\u2019s Association (IBA) for extending credit \nfacility to SHGs.  \n 6 \n 7.2.3 Loan amount : Emphasis is laid on the multiple doses of assistance under DAY -\nNRLM. This would mean assisting an SHG over a period of time, through repeat doses \nof credit, to enable them to access higher amounts of credit for taking up sustainable \nlivelihoods and improve on the quality of life.  \nSHGs can avail either Term Loan (TL) or a Cash Credit Limit ( CCL) loan or both based \non the need. In case of need, additional loan can be sanctioned even though the \nprevious loan is outstanding.  \nThe amount of credit under different facilities should be as follows:  \nCash Credit Limit ( CCL): In case of CCL, banks are advised to sanction minimum loan \nof ` 5 lakhs to each eligible SHGs for a period of 5 years with a yearly drawing power \n(DP). The drawing power  may be enhanced annually based on the repayment \nperformance of the SHG. The drawing power may be calculated as follows:  \n\u2022 DP for First Year: 6 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b9  1 lakh \nwhichever is higher.  \n\u2022 DP for Secon d Year: 8 times of the corpus  at the time review/ enhancement  or \nminimum of \u20b9  2 lakh, whichever is higher  \n\u2022 DP for Third Year: Minimum of \u20b9  3 lakhs based on the Mi cro credit plan prepared by \nSHG  and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit \nHistory.  \n\u2022 DP for Fo urth Year onwards: Minimum of \u20b9  5 lakhs based on the M icro credit plan \nprepared by SHG  and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the \nprevious credit History.  \nTerm Loan:  In case of Term Loan, banks are advised to sanction loan amount in doses \nas mentioned below:  \n\u2022 First Dose: 6 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b9  1 lakh whichever is \nhigher.  \n\u2022 Second Dose: 8 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b9  2 lakh, whichever \nis higher  \n 7 \n \u2022 Third Dose: Minimum of \u20b9  3 lakhs based on the Micro credit plan prepared by the \nSHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit \nHistory  \n\u2022 Fourth Dose: Minimum of \u20b9  5 lakhs based on the Micro credit plan prepared by the \nSHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit \nHistory  \nBanks should take necessary measures to ensure that eligible SHG are provided \nwith repeat loans. Banks are advised to work with DAY -NRLM to institutionalize a \nmechanism for online submission of loan application of SHGs for tracking and timel y \ndisposal of application.  \n(Corpus is inclusive of revolving funds, if any, received by that SHG, its own savings, \ninterest earning by SHG from on- lending to its members, income from other sources, \nand funds from other sources in case of promotion by other  institutes/NGOs.)  \n7.3 Purpose of loan and repayment : \n7.3.1 The loan amount will be distributed among members based on the Micro Credit \nPlan (MCP) prepared by the SHGs. The loans may be used by members for \nmeeting social needs, high cost debt swapping, construction or repair of house, \nconstruction of toilets  and taking up sustainable livelihoods by the individual \nmembers within the SHGs or to finance any viable common activity started by the \nSHGs.  \n \n7.3.2 In order to facilitate use of loans for augmenting livelihoods of SH G members, it is \nadvised that at least 50% of loans above \u20b9  2 lakhs and 75% of loans above \u20b9  4 \nlakhs be used primarily for income generating productive purposes. Micro Credit \nPlan (MCP) prepared by SHGs would form the basis for determining the purpose \nand usage of loans.  \n \n7.3.3 Repayment schedule could be as follows:  \n\u2022 The First year/ first dose of loan will be repaid in 6- 12 months in monthly/ \nquarterly instalments  \n\u2022 The Second year/ Second dose of loan will be repaid in 12- 24 months in \nmonthly/ quarterly instalments  8 \n \u2022 The Third year/ Third dose of loan will be repaid in 24 -36 months in monthly/ \nquarterly instalments  \n\u2022 The loan from Fourth year/ Fourth dose onwards has to be repaid between 3-\n6 years based on the cash flow in monthly/ quarterly installments.  \n \n7.4. Secur ity and Margin: No collateral and no margin will be charged up to \u20b9  10.00 \nlakhs limit to the SHGs. No lien should be marked against savings bank account of SHGs \nand no deposits should be insisted upon while sanctioning loans.  \n \n7.5. Dealing with Defaulters:  \n \n7.5.1 It is desirable that willful defaulters should not be financed under DAY -NRLM. In \ncase willful defaulters are members of a group, they might be allowed to benefit from the \nthrift and credit activities of the group including the corpus built up with the assistance of \nRevolving Fund. But at the stage of accessing bank loan by SHG for financing economic \nactivities by its members, the willful defaulters should not have the benefit of such bank \nloan until the outstanding loans are repaid. Willful default ers of the group should not get \nbenefits under the DAY -NRLM Scheme and the group may be financed excluding such \ndefaulters while documenting the loan. However, banks should not deny loan to entire \nSHG on the pretext that spouse or other family members of i ndividual members of SHG \nbeing a defaulter with the bank.  Further, non- willful defaulters should not be debarred \nfrom receiving the loan.  In case default is due to genuine reasons, Banks may follow the \nnorms suggested for restructuring the account with rev ised repayment schedule.  \n \n8. Credit Target Planning \n \n8.1 Based on the Potential Linked Plan/State Focus Paper prepared by NABARD, SLBC \nsub-committee on SHG Bank Linkage may arrive at the district -wise, block -wise and \nbranch- wise credit plan. The sub-  commi ttee should consider  the existing SHGs, New \nSHGs proposed, and number of SHGs eligible for fresh and repeat loans as suggested \nby the SRLMs to arrive at the credit targets for the states. The targets so decided should \nbe approved in the SLBC and should be reviewed and monitored periodically for effective \nimplementation.  \n \n8.2. The district -wise credit plans should be communicated to the DCC. The Block -\nwise/Cluster -wise targets are to be communicated to the bank Branches through the \nControllers . 9 \n  \n9. Post credit follow -up \n \n9.1 Loan pass books or statement of accounts  in regional languages may be issued to \nthe SHGs which may contain all the details of the loans disbursed to them and the terms \nand conditions applicable to the loan sanctioned. The passbook should be updated with \nevery transaction made by the SHGs. At the time of documentation and disbursement of \nloan, it is advisable to clearly explain the terms and conditions as part of financial literacy.  \n \n9.2 Bank branches may observe one fixed day in a fortnight to enable the staff to go to \nthe field and attend the meetings of the SHGs and Federations to observe the operations \nof the SHGs and keep a track of the regularity in the SHGs meetings and performance.  \n \n10. Repayment:  \n \nPrompt repayment of the loans is necessar y to ensure the success of the programme. \nBanks shall take all possible measures, i.e. personal contact, organization of joint \nrecovery camps with District Mission Management Units (DPMUs) / DRDAs to ensure the \nrecovery of loans. Keeping in view, the impor tance of loan recovery, banks should \nprepare a list of defaulting SHGs under DAY -NRLM every month and furnish the list in \nthe BLBC, DCC meetings. This would ensure that DAY -NRLM staff at the district/ block \nlevel will assist the bankers in initiating the r epayment.  \n \n11. Deputation of the bank officials to SRLMs \n \nAs a measure of strengthening the (DPMUs) / DRDAs and for promoting a better credit \nenvironment, deputation of the bank officials to DPMUs/ DRDAs has been suggested. \nBanks may consider deputing offi cers at various levels to the State Governments/DRDAs \nin consultation with them.  \n \n12. Supervision and monitoring of the Scheme \n \nBanks may set up DAY -NRLM cells at Regional/Zonal offices. These cells should \nperiodically monitor and review the flow of credit  to the SHGs, ensure the implementation \nof the guidelines to the scheme, collect data from the branches and make available 10 \n consolidated data to the Head office and the DAY -NRLM units at the districts/ blocks. \nThe cell should also discuss this consolidated data in the SLBC, BLBC and DCC \nmeetings regularly to maintain the effective communication with the state staff and all \nbanks.  \n \n12.1 State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee: SLBCs shall constitute a sub- committee on \nSHG -bank linkage. The sub- committee should consist of m embers from all banks \noperating in the State, RBI, NABARD, CEO of SRLM, representatives of State Rural \nDevelopment Department, Secretary -Institutional Finance and Representatives of \nDevelopment Departments etc. The sub-  committee shall meet once in a month with a \nspecific agenda of review, implementation and monitoring of the SHG -Bank linkage and \nthe issues/ constraints in achievement of the credit target. The decisions of SLBCs \nshould be derived from the analysis of the reports of the sub- committee.  \n \n12.2 District Coordination Committee: The DCC (DAY- NRLM sub -committee) shall \nregularly monitor the flow of credit to SHGs at the district level and resolve issues that \nconstrain the flow of credit to the SHGs at district level. This committee meeting should \nhave participation of LDMs, AGM of NABARD, district coordinators of the banks and \nDPMU staff representing DAY -NRLM and office bearers of SHG federations.  \n \n12.3 Block level Bankers Committee: The BLBC shall meet regularly and take up \nissues of SHG bank linkage at the block level. In this Committee, the SHGs/ Federations \nof the SHGs should be included as members to raise their voice in the forum. Branch \nwise status of SHG credit shall be monitored at the BLBC (Annex B and C may be used \nfor the purpose)  \n \n12.4 Reporting to Lead District Managers: The branches may furnish the  progress \nreport and the delinquency report achieved under various activities of DAY -NRLM in the \nformat at Annex \u2018 IV\u2019 and \u2018Annex V \u2019 to the LDM every month for onward submission to \nSpecial Steering Committee /sub- committee constituted by SLBC.  \n \n12.5 Reporting to RBI : Banks may give a state- wise consolidated report on the progress \nmade on DAY -NRLM to RBI/NABARD at quarterly intervals. The data may be submitted \nwithin a month from the end of the concerned quarter.  \n 11 \n  \n12.6 LBR returns : Existing procedure of submitting LBR returns to be continued duly \nfurnishing the correct code.  \n \n13. Data Sharing:  \n \nData sharing on a mutually agreed format / interval may be provided to DAY -NRLM or \nState Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs) for  initiating various strategies including \nrecovery etc. The financing banks are advised to regularly share data on loans to SHGs \nwith the DAY- NRLM or SRLMs, directly from the CBS platform.  \n \n14. DAY- NRLM support to the bankers:  \n \n14.1 SRLM would develop strat egic partnerships with major banks at various levels. It \nwould invest in creating enabling conditions for both the banks and the poor for a \nmutually rewarding relationship.  \n \n14.2 SRLM will assist the SHGs through imparting financial literacy, extending \ncounsell ing services on savings, credit and training on Micro- investment Planning \nembedded in capacity building.  \n \n14.3 SRLMs will extend support to banks for improving quality of banking services to \npoor clients including follow -up for recovery of over dues if any, by  positioning customer \nrelationship managers (Bank Mitra/ Sakhi) with every bank branch involved in financing \nof SHGs.  \n \n14.4 Leveraging IT mobile technologies and institutions of poor, youth or SHG member \nas business facilitators and business correspondents.  \n \n14.5. Community Based Repayment mechanism (CBRM) : One exclusive sub -  \ncommittee for SHG Bank Linkage may be formed at village/cluster/ block level which will \nprovide support to the banks in ensuring proper utilization of loan amount, recovery etc. \nThe bank  linkage sub - committee members from each village level federation along with \nproject staff will meet once in a month under the chairmanship of the Branch Manager in \nthe branch premises with the agenda items relating to bank linkage.  \n 12 \n Annex I  \n \nKey Features of DAY- NRLM  \n \n1. Universal Social Mobilization: To begin with, DAY -NRLM would ensure that at least \none member from each identified rural poor household, preferably a woman, is brought \nunder the Self Help Group (SHG) network in a time bound manner. Subsequent ly, both \nwomen and men would be organized for addressing livelihoods issues i.e. farmers \norganizations, milk producers\u2019 cooperatives, weavers associations, etc. All these \ninstitutions are inclusive and no poor would be left out of them. DAY -NRLM would ensu re \nadequate coverage of vulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of the \nbeneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are minorities and 3% are persons with disability, while \nkeeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of all households under the \nautomati cally included criteria and households with at least one deprivation criteria as per \nSocio -Economic and Caste Census (SECC) .  \n \n2. Participatory Identification of poor (PIP): The experience from SGSY  suggests that \nthe current BPL list has large inclusion and e xclusion errors. To widen the target groups \nbeyond the BPL list and to include all the needy poor identified as households with at \nleast one deprivation criteria as per Socio- Economic and Caste Census (SECC) . DAY -\nNRLM will also undertake community -based process i.e. participation of the poor in the \nprocess of identifying the target group. Participatory process based on sound \nmethodology and tools (social mapping and well -being categorization, deprivation \nindicators) and also locally understood and  accepted criterion ensures local consensus \nthat inadvertently reduces the inclusion and exclusion errors and enables formation of \nthe groups on the basis of mutual affinity. Over the years, the participatory method of \nidentifying the poor have been developed and applied successfully in the states like AP, \nKerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha.  \n \nThe households identified with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC along with \nhouseholds identified through the P.I.P process will be accepted as DAY -NRLM target \ngroup and will be eligible for all the benefits under the programme. The list finalized after \nPIP process will be vetted by the Gram Sabha and approved by the Gram Panchayat.  \n \nTill the PIP process is undertaken by the State in a particular district/Block, the rural  \nhouseholds with at least one deprivation criteria as per  SECC list  will be targeted under  13 \n DAY- NRLM. As already provided in the Framework for implementation of DAY -NRLM, up \nto 30% of the total membership of the SHGs may be from among the population \nmarginally above the poverty line, subject to the approval of other  members of the group. \nThis 30% also includes the poor households whose name does not figure in the SECC \nlist but are as poor as those included in SECC list .  \n \n3. Promotion of Institutions of the poor: Strong institutions of the poor such as SHGs \nand their village level and higher -level federations are necessary to provide space, voice \nand resources for the poor and for reducing their dependence on external agencies. \nThey empower them and also act as instruments of knowledge and technology \ndissemination, and hubs of production, collectivization and commerce. DAY -NRLM, \ntherefore, would focus on setting up these institutions at various levels. In addition, DAY -\nNRLM would promote specialized institutions like Livelihoods collectives, producers\u2019 \ncooperative/companies for livelihoods promotion through deriving economies of scale, \nbackward and forward linkages, and access to information, credit, technology, markets \netc. The Livelihoods collectives would enabl e the poor to optimize their limited resource.  \n \n4. Strengthening all existing SHGs and federations of the poor. There are existing \ninstitutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of NGOs. DAY -\nNRLM would strengthen all existing institutions of the poor in a partnership mode. The \nself-help promoting institutions both in the Government and in the NGO sector would \npromote social accountability practices to introduce greater transparency. This would be \nin addition to the mechanisms that would be evolved by SRLMs and state governments. \nThe learning from one another underpins the key processes of learning in DAY -NRLM.  \n \n5. Emphasis on Training, Capacity building and skill building:  DAY- NRLM would \nensure that the poor are provided with the requis ite skills for managing their institutions, \nlinking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods , enhancing their credit \nabsorption capacity and credit worthiness, etc. A multi -pronged approach is envisaged \nfor continuous capacity building of the t argeted families, SHGs, their federations, \ngovernment functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders. Particular focus \nwould be on developing and engaging community professionals and community resource \npersons for capacity building of SHGs and their federations and other collectives. DAY -\nNRLM would make extensive use of ICT to make knowledge dissemination and capacity \nbuilding more effective.  14 \n  \n6. Revolving Fund and Community investment support Fund (C.I.F): A  Revolving \nFund would be provided to eligible SHGs as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thrift \nand accumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long- run and \nimmediate consumption needs in the short -run. The C.I.F would be a corpus and used \nfor meeting the members\u2019 credi t needs directly and as catalytic capital for leveraging \nrepeat bank finance. The C.I.F would be routed to the SHGs through the Federations. \nThe key to coming out of poverty is continuous and easy access to finance, at \nreasonable rates, till they accumulat e their own funds in large measure.  \n \n7. Universal Financial Inclusion: DAY- NRLM would work towards achieving  universal \nfinancial inclusion, beyond basic banking services to all the poor households, SHGs and \ntheir federations. DAY -NRLM would work on both demand and supply side of Financial \nInclusion. On the demand side, it would promote financial literacy among the poor and \nprovides catalytic capital to the SHGs and their federations. On the supply side, it would \ncoordinate with the financial sector and encour age use of Information, Communication & \nTechnology (ICT) based financial technologies, business correspondents and community \nfacilitators like \u2018Bank Mitras\u2019. It would also work towards universal coverage of rural poor \nagainst loss of life, health and asset s. Further, it would work on remittances, especially in \nareas where migration is endemic.  \n \n8. Provision of Interest Subvention: The rural poor need credit at low rate of  interest \nand in multiple doses to make their ventures economically viable. In order to ensure \naffordable credit, DAY -NRLM has a provision for subvention on interest rate above 7% \nper annum for all eligible SHGs, who have availed loans from mainstream financial \ninstitutions.  \n \n9. Funding Pattern: DAY- NRLM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the financing of \nthe programme would be shared between the Centre and the States in the ratio of 60:40 \n(90:10 in case of North Eastern States including Sikkim; completely from the Centre in \ncase of UTs). The Central allocation earmarked for the States would broadly be \ndistributed in relation to the incidence of poverty in the States.  \n \n10. Phased Implementation: Social capital of the poor consists of the institutions of the \npoor, their leaders, community professionals and more importantly community resource 15 \n persons ( poor women whose lives have been transformed through the support of their \ninstitutions). Building up social capital takes some time in the initial years, but it multiplies \nrapidly after some time. If the social capital of the poor does not play the lead role in \nDAY- NRLM, then it would not be a people\u2019s programme. Further, it is important to ensure \nthat the quality and effectiveness of the interventions is not diluted. Therefore, a phased \nimplementation approach is adopted in DAY -NRLM. DAY- NRLM would reach all districts \nby the end of 12th Five- year Plan.  \n \n11. Intensive blocks. The blocks that are taken up for implementation of DAY -NRLM, \n\u2018intensive blocks\u2019, would have access to a full complement of trained professional staff \nand cover a whole range of activities of universal and intense social and financial \ninclusion, livelihoods, partnerships etc. However, in the remaining blocks or non- intensive \nblocks, the activities may be limited in scope and intensity.  \n \n12. Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs). RSETI concept is  built on \nthe model pioneered by Rural Development Self Employment Institute (RUDSETI) \u2013  a \ncollaborative partnership between SDME Trust, Syndicate Bank and Canara Bank. The \nmodel envisages transforming unemployed youth into confident self - employed \nentrepreneurs through a short duration experiential learning programme followed by \nsystematic long duration hand holding support. The need- based training builds \nentrepreneurship qualities, improves self -confidence, reduces risk of failure and develo ps \nthe trainees into change agents. Banks are fully involved in selection, training and post \ntraining follow up stages. The needs of the poor articulated through the institutions of the \npoor would guide RSETIs in preparing the participants/trainees in thei r pursuits of self -\nemployment and enterprises. DAY -NRLM would encourage public sector banks to set up \nRSETIs in all districts of the country . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 \n     Annex II  \nInterest subvention scheme for Women SHGs \nI.          I nterest subve ntion scheme on Credit to Women SHG for all \nCommercial Banks  ( only  Public Sector Banks,  Private Sector Ba nks  \nand  Regional  Rural Banks) and Co-operative  banks in 250 districts \ni.         All women SHGs w ill be eligible for interest  subv ention on c redit up to 3 \nlakhs at 7% pe r annum.  SHG availing capital subs idy under SGSY in \ntheir existing credit outstanding will  not be e ligible for benefit unde r this \nscheme. \n \nii. The Com mercial Banks and Coope rative Banks will lend to all the \nwomen SHGs at the rate of 7% in the 250 dis tricts. Annex III  provides  \nthe na mes of  the 250 dis tricts. \n \niii.    All Com mercial Banks (excluding RRBs) will be subv ented to the \nextent of difference be tween the W eighted Average Interest Charged \n(WAIC as specified by  Departm ent of Financ ial Services, Ministry of \nFinance)  and 7% subj ect to the maximum limit of 5.5%.This  subv ention \nwill be available to all the Banks on the condition that they make SHG \ncredit available at 7% p.a. in the 250 dis tricts. \n \n       i v.

Credit Facilities to Minority Communities : \n \nThe Government of India has indicated that care should be taken to see that minority \ncommunities secure, in a fair and adequate measure the benefits flowing from various \nGovernment sponsored schemes. Accordingly, all commercial banks are advised to \nensure smooth flow of bank credit to minority communities.  \n \nGovernment of India has also forwarded a list of 121 minority concentration districts \nhaving at least 25% minority population, excluding those States / UTs where minorities \nare in majority (J & K, Punjab, Meghalaya, Mizor am, Nagaland and Lakshadweep). \nAccordingly all scheduled commercial banks are requested to specially monitor the \ncredit flow to minorities in these 121 districts, thereby, ensuring that the minority \ncommunities receive a fair and equitable portion of the credit within the overall \ntarget of the priority sector  (list of Minority Concentration Districts at Annexure I ). \n \nIn terms of Reserve Bank's extant guidelines on lending to priority sector, a target of 40 \npercent of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent amount of Off -\nBalance Sheet Exposures (OBE), whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous \nyear, has been mandated for lending to the priority sector by domestic scheduled \ncommercial banks and foreign banks with 20 and above branches , for Small Finance \nBanks it is 75% of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) . Within this, a sub- target of \n10 per cent of ANBC or Credit Equivalent amount of OBE, whichever is higher, as on \nMarch 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for lending to weaker sections \nwhich includes, among others, persons from minority communities . \n \n \n2.        Definition of Minority Communities  \n \n2.1 The following communities have been notified as minority communities by the \nGovernment of India,  Ministr y of Minority Affairs ; \n(a)    Sikhs   \n(b)    Muslims   \n(c)    Christians   \n(d)    Zoroastrians   \n(e)    Buddhists  \n(f)     Jains  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n2 \n  \n \n \n 2.2 In the case of a partnership firm, if the majority of the partners belong to one or the \nother of the specified minority communities, advances granted to such partnership firms \nmay be treated as advances granted to minority communities. Further, if the majority \nbeneficial ownership in a partnership firm belongs to the minority community, then such \nlending can be classified as advances to the specified communities. A company has a \nseparate legal entity and hence advances granted to it cannot be classified as \nadvances to the specified minority communities.  \n \n3. Creation of Special Cell and Designating an exclusive Officer  \n \n3.1 A Special Cell should be set up in each bank to ensure smooth flow of credit to \nminority communities and it should be headed by an officer holding the rank of      \nDeputy General Manager/Assistant General Manager or any other similar rank who \nshould function as a 'Nodal Officer'.  \n \n3.2  The Lead Bank in each of the minority concentration districts should have an officer \nwho shall exclusively  look after the problems regarding the credit flow to minority \ncommunities. It shall be his responsibility to publicise among the minority \ncommunities various programmes of bank credit and also to prepare suitable \nschemes for their benefit in collaboration with branch managers.  \n \n3.3 The designated officer should exclusively look after aspects relating to credit \nassistance to minority communities in the concerned districts. The designated officer \nmay be attached to the Lead Bank set up at the district level. He would thus, be able \nto receive necessary guidance from Lead Bank Officer, who will be senior enough \nand have adequate experience for liaising effectively with the other credit institutions \nand Government agencies, and will also be working in close collaboration with the \nbranch managers of other banks in the district. The designated officer will also \narrange group meeti ngs for their guidance for formulation of schemes suitable for \nthe members of the minority communities. It will be necessary for the banks \nconcerned to ensure that the role assigned to the designated officer/s is effectively \nfulfilled.  \n \n3.4 The Convenor banks of the District Consultative Committees (DCCs) and the State           \n       Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs) should ensure that steps taken to facilitate the   \n      flow of credit to the minority communities and the progress made in this regard are  \n      reviewed regularly at their meetings.   \n  \n3 \n  \n \n3.5  The Convenor banks of DLRC/SLRM/SLBCs may invite Chairman/ Managing \nDirectors of State Minority Commissions/Boards or the State Minorities Financial \nCorporations or their representatives to attend the meetings of District Level Review \nCommittee (DLRC), State Level Review Meeting (SLRM) and State Level Bankers \nCommittee (SLBC). \n \n \n3.6  Names, designation and office addresses of (i) the officer -in-charge of the Special \nCell at Head Office and (ii) officer appointed by Lead Banks in the identified districts \nto look after exclusively the problems of minority communities, should be furnished \nby banks to the National Commission for Minorities at the following address and \nupdated periodically:  \nThe Secretary  \nNational Commis sion for Minorities  \nGovernment of India \n5th Floor , Lok Nayak Bhawan  \nKhan Market  \nNew Delhi 110 003  \n \nA copy of the relevant communication may also be furnished to Financial Inclusion \nand Development  Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai.  \n \n \n3.7  The Lead Banks in the identified districts having concentration of minority \ncommunities may involve the State Minority Commission / Finance Corporation in \nthe extension work including creating awareness, identification of beneficiaries, \npreparation of vi able projects, provision of backward and forward linkages such as \nsupply of inputs/marketing, recovery etc.  \n \n3.8  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may collaborate with DDMs of NABARD/ \nNGOs/ Voluntary Organizations in reaching the poor through Self He lp Groups \n(SHGs). Lead Banks of the Minority Concentration Districts will have to exercise the \npro-active role expected of them to ensure that the minority communities, \nparticularly those who are poor and illiterate have access to bank credit for taking up  \nproductive activities.  \n \n4 Advances under DRI Scheme  \nBanks may route loans under the DRI scheme through State Minority \nFinance/Development Corporation on the same terms and conditions as are \napplicable to loans routed through SC/ST Development Corporations, subject to the \nbeneficiaries of the Corporations meeting the eligibility criteria and other terms and  \n  \n4 \n conditions prescribed under the scheme. Banks may ensure proper maintenance of \nthe register to evolve timely sanction and disbursement of loan applications.  \n \n5.   Monitoring  \n5.1 With a view to monitoring the performance of banks in providing credit to the \nspecified minority communities, data on credit assistance provided to members of \nminority communities should be furnished to Reserve Bank of India and to the \nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Minority Affairs, on half \nyearly basis as at the end of March and September every year. The statements \n(given in Annexure II ) should reach RBI within one month from the end of each half \nyear.\u201d  \n \n \n5.2  The Conveno r banks of the District Consultative Committees in the identified \nminority concentrated districts should furnish the data on priority sector advances \ngranted by banks to specified minority communities compiled by them in the \nprescribed format (vide Annexure III ) for the district under their lead responsibility to \nthe concerned Regional Offices of RBl within one month from the close of the \nrelative quarter.  \n \n5.3  The progress made in regard to the flow of credit to the minority communities \nshould be reviewed regularly at the meetings of the District Consultative \nCommittees (DCCs) and the State Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs).  \n \n \n5.4  The Lead Banks in the identified minority concentrated districts should furnish the \nrelevant extracts of the agenda notes and the minutes of the meetings of the DCCs \nand of the respective SLBCs to the Union Ministry of Finance and to the Ministry of \nMinority Affairs  on a quarterly basis for their use.  \n \n6 Training \n \n6.1  With a view to ensuring that the bank staff and officers have proper perspective and \nappreciation of the various programmes for welfare of minorities, necessary \norientation may be provided to officials and other staff. For this purpose, banks \nshould include suitable lectur e sessions as part of all relevant training programmes \nlike induction courses, programmes on rural lending, financing of priority sectors, \npoverty alleviation programmes, etc.  \n \n6.2  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may sensitise and motivate the staf f \nposted to identified districts through proper training to assist the minority \ncommunities under various credit schemes.   \n  \n5 \n  \n6.3  The Lead Banks may organize sensitization workshops for bank officials regarding \nmicro credit/ lending to SHGs with the help of DDMs  of NABARD.  \n \n6.4  The Lead Banks functioning in the identified districts should organize Entrepreneur \nDevelopment Programmes so that the members of the minority communities in \nthese areas are enabled to derive the benefit of various programmes being financed \nby the banks. Depending upon the major vocation and type of activity undertaken by \nlarge sections of the people in the districts, suitable programmes may be organized \nin co -operation with State Governments, Industries Department, District Industries \nCentre,  SIDBI, State Technical Consultancy Organization, Khadi and Village \nIndustries Commission and other voluntary organizations which are fully equipped to \nimpart such training and orientation. The duration of the programme, the course \ncontent, the faculty support to be selected etc. should be decided by each Lead \nBank taking into account the prevailing conditions, need and existing skills as well \nas aptitude of the people in the district.  \n \n7 Publicity  \n \n7.1  There should be good publicity about various anti -poverty programmes of the \nGovernment where there is large concentration of minority communities and \nparticularly in the districts listed in the Annexure I  which have a concentration of \nminority communities.  \n \n7.2  The Lead Banks in the identifie d districts may create awareness among minority \ncommunities regarding credit facilities available from banks through appropriate \nmeasures which may include publicity through (i) print media i.e. distribution of \npamphlets in local languages, advertisements/ articles in newspapers etc. (ii) TV \nchannels - DD/ local channels, (iii) participation / setting up of stalls in the Melas / \nfairs organized during the religious /festive occasions by these communities.  \n \n8.   National Minorities Development and Finance Cor poration (NMDFC)  \n \n8.1  National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC) was \nestablished in September 1994 to promote economic and developmental activities \nfor the backward sections amongst the minorities. NMDFC works as an apex body \nand channeli ses its funds to the beneficiaries through the State Minority Finance \nCorporation of the respective State/Union Territory Governments.  \n \n  \n  \n6 \n  \n \n8.2  The NMDFC is operating, inter -alia, the Margin Money Scheme. Bank finance \nunder the scheme will be upto 60 percent of the project cost. The remaining amount \nof the project cost is shared by NMDFC, the State channelising agency and the \nbeneficiary in the proportion of 25%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. Banks may \nimplement the Margin Money scheme evolved by NMDFC. While extending bank \nfinance, banks should bear in mind the guidelines/instructions issued by RBI from \ntime to time on priority sector advances. It may be ensured that the assets created \nout of the loan amount are mortgaged / hypothecated to the banks. Where \nrecover ies have been made by the banks, it would be in order if the amounts are \nappropriated first towards bank dues.  \n \n9 Prime Minister\u2019s 15 Point Programme for the Welfare of Minorities \nGovernment of India has revised the \u201cPrime Minister\u2019s New 15- Point Programme f or \nthe Welfare of Minorities\u201d. An important objective of the Programme is to ensure that \nan appropriate percentage of the priority sector lending is targeted for the minority \ncommunities and that the benefits of various government sponsored schemes reach \nthe under -privileged, which includes the disadvantaged sections of the minority \ncommunities. The New Programme is to be implemented by the Central \nMinistries/Departments concerned through State Governments/Union Territories \nand envisages location of certain proportion of development projects in minority \nconcentration districts. Accordingly, all scheduled commercial banks are required to \nensure that within the overall target for priority sector lending and the sub- target of \n10 percent for the weaker sections,  sufficient care is taken to ensure that minority \ncommunities also receive an equitable portion of the credit. Lead Banks have been \nadvised to keep this requirement in view while preparing district credit plans.  \n \n \n                                            ------------------------------------  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n7 \n  \nAnnexure I \nList of 121 Minority Concentration Districts  \n(Vide paragraph 3.3, 5.3 and 7.1)  \nSl.

Based on the public comments received on the concept paper and the subsequent draft \nguidelines issued for setting up and operating the system, and interactions held with relevant \nstakeholders, the following guidelines are being issued for setting up and operating the trade \nreceivables system in the country. These Guidelines are issued by Reserve Bank of India \nunder Section 10(2) read with Section 18 of Payment & Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act \n51 of 2007).  \nScheme \n3. The scheme for setting up and operat ing the institutional mechanism for facilitating the \nfinancing of trade receivables of MSMEs from corporate and other buyers, including \nGovernment Departments and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), through multiple \nfinanciers will be known as Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS).  \n4. The TReDS will facilitate the discounting of both invoices as well as bills of exchange. \nFurther, as the underlying entities are the same (MSMEs and corporate and other buyers, \nincluding Government Departments and PSUs),  the TReDS could deal with both receivables \nfactoring as well as reverse factoring so that higher transaction volumes come into the \nsystem and facilitate better pricing.  \n5. The transactions processed under TReDS will be \u201cwithout recourse\u201d to the MSMEs.  \nDefinitions  \n6. For the purpose of the Scheme, notwithstanding any other definition used in any other \ncontext, scheme, law or document, the following definitions are used:  \na) Factoring unit - a standard nomenclature used in the TReDS for an invoice or a bill on the \nsystem. Factoring Units may be created either by the MSME seller (in the case of factoring) \nor by corporate and other buyers, including Government Departments and PSUs, (in case of \nreverse factoring) as the case may be.  \nb) Financier \u2013  refers to banks, NBFC  Factor s and other financial institutions  as permitted by \nthe Reserve Bank of India participating in the TReDS  and accept ing the factoring unit for \nfinancing purpose.  2 \n Participants  \n7. MSME sellers, corporate and other buyers, including the Government Departments and \nPSUs, and financiers ( banks, NBFC  Factor s and other financial institutions as permitted by \nthe Reserve Bank of India) will be direct participants in the TReDS. The TReDS will provide \nthe platform to bring these participants toget her for facilitating uploading, accepting, \ndiscounting, trading and settlement of the invoices / bills of MSMEs. The bankers of sellers \nand buyers may be provided access to the system, where necessary, for obtaining \ninformation on the portfolio of discount ed invoices / bills of respective clients. The TReDS \nmay tie up with necessary technology providers, system integrators and entities providing \ndematerialisation services for providing its services.  \nProcess flow and procedure \n8. The objective of the TReDS i s to facilitate financing of invoices / bills of MSMEs drawn on \ncorporate and other buyers, including the Government Departments and PSUs, by way of \ndiscounting by financiers. To enable this, the TReDS has to put in place suitable mechanism \nwhereby the inv oice / bill is converted into \u201cfactoring unit\u201d as indicated in the Annex . \n9. In the first phase, the TReDS would facilitate the discounting of these factoring units by \nthe financiers resulting in flow of funds to the MSME with final payment of the factoring unit \nbeing made by the buyer to the financier on due date. In the second phase, the TReDS \nwould enable further discounting / re -discounting of the discounted factoring units by the \nfinanciers, thus resulting in its assignment in fav our of other financiers.  \n10. The  process flow  of the TReDS  has to enable at the minimum, the uploading of \ninvoices/bills and creation of factoring units by the MSME sellers; its acceptance by the \ncorporate and other buyers, including the Government Departments and PSUs, within a \nspecified time limit; discounting,  rating and re -discounting of factoring units; sending of \nnotifications at each stage to the relevant parties to the transaction; reporting and MIS \nrequirements; and finally, generation and submission of settlement of obligations. In case of \nreverse factor ing, the buyer could also create factoring units based on the documents \nuploaded by the MSME seller. A brief illustrative outline of the minimum features required in \nthe process flow is given in the  Annex . \n11. The actual business, tec hnical and operational processes and procedures to be followed \nin the system will be prepared by the entity operating the TReDS, and will be part of the \nProcedural Guidelines for the system.  \n12. The TReDS may also undertake some random  audits  to ensure that the factoring units \nuploaded on the exchange are authentic & based on genuine underlying transactions \ninvolving the sale of goods or services.  \n13. TReDS would put in place a standardized mechanism / process for  on-boarding of \nbuyers and sellers on the TReDS. This one- time on- boarding process will require the \nentities to submit all KYC related documents to the TReDS, along with resolutions / \ndocuments specific to authorised personnel of the buyer, and the MSME seller. Such \nauthorised personnel would be provided with IDs / Passwords for TReDS authorisations 3 \n (multi -level). Indemnity in favour of TReDS, if required, may also be given if it is made part of \nthe standardized on- boarding process.  \n14. The KYC documentation  and its process may be standardised and disclosed to all \nstakeholders by TReDS. As it requires confirmation of the banker of the MSME seller / \nbuyer, as the case may be, the KYC documentation may be synchronous with the \ndocumentation / verification done by the banks in adherence to the extant re gulatory \nrequirements  (Reserve Bank of India\u2019s \u201c Master Direction -  Know Your Customer (KYC) \nDirection, 2016 \u201d dated February 25, 2016 (as amended from time to time) ). \n15. There would be a one- time agreement  drawn up amongst the participants in the \nTReDS:  \na) Master agreement between the financier and the TReDS, stating the terms and \nconditions of dealings between both the entities.  \nb) Master agreement between the buyers and the TReDS, stating the terms and \nconditions of dealings between both the entities. This agreement should clearly \ncapture the following aspects:  \n(i) The buyer\u2019s (corporates and other buyers including government departments \nand PSUs as the case may be) obligation to pay on the due date once the \nfactoring unit is accepted online.  \n(ii) No recourse to disputes with respect to quality of goods or otherwise.  \n(iii) No set offs to be allowed.  \nc) Master agreement between the MSME sellers and the TReDS, stating the terms \nand conditions of dealings between both the entities. The agreement should also \nhave a declaration / undertaking by the MSME seller that, in respect of goods and \nservices underlying the factoring unit, no finance is extended by the working capital \nfinancing bank and such  goods and services are not charged to the working capital \nfinancing bankers (i.e., finance availed through the TReDS would not be part of \nexisting charge / hypothecation of its working capital bankers).  \nd) In case of financing on the basis of invoices, an assignment agreement would \nneed to be executed between the MSME seller and the financier. Alternatively, this \naspect may be incorporated in the agreement between the MSME seller and the \nfinancier, to the effect that any financing transaction on TReDS will  tantamount to an \nassignment of receivables in favour of whoever is the financier.  \ne) The TReDS will be in custody of all the agreements.  \n16. Other procedural aspects of TReDS functioning and operations may be incorporated \neither in the Master Agreement, i f so necessitated by the participants, or in the Procedural \nGuidelines where applicable. In all instances, such procedural aspects, even if incorporated \nin the Master Agreements, should be in adherence to regulatory norms issued from time to \ntime. The Mast er Agreement may also clearly indicate that any legal proceedings to be \ninitiated by one entity against another, if at all, will be outside the purview of TReDS.  4 \n 17. TReDS will also review the need for CERSAI registration for the assignments as \nindicated above, and put in place a suitable mechanism for the same (preferably driven \nautomatically through the TReDS), as soon as feasible after a factoring unit has been \naccepted for financing by a financier.  \nSettlement process  \n18. Critical to the operations of the TReDS is the mechanism that ensures timely settlement \nof funds between the member financiers and the MSME sellers (when the factoring unit is \nfinanced) and the subsequent settlement of funds between the member buyers and the \nrespective financiers on due date of the factoring unit. In order to ensure a smooth process \nof such payments, the TReDS would be required to:  \na) Trigger settlement between financier and MSME for accepted bids  - In respect of \nall factoring units financed on a given day, the TReDS will  generate the payment \nobligations of all financiers on T+2 basis and send the file for settlement in any of the \nexisting payment system as agreed among the system participants. The TReDS \nwould have to put in place a separate recourse mechanism to handle settlement \nfailures in respective payment systems.  \nb) Trigger settlement between the buyer and the ultimate financier on due date - the \nTReDS  would generate the payment obligations file and send the same for \nsettlement on due date to the relevant payment system.  \n19. The TReDS  will generate the settlement files and send the same to existing payment \nsystems for actual payment of funds. This would ensure that the inter -bank settlement \n(between the bankers representing member MSMEs, buyers and the financiers) will take \nplace and defaults, if any, by the buyers will be handled by the buyer\u2019s bank and will not be \nthe responsibility of the TReDS. Hence, the settlement process ensures payments to \nrelevant recipients on due date, thus, facilitating the smooth operations on the TReDS. \nHowever, it would not entail a guaranteed settlement by the TReDS.  \n20. The TReDS would be required to put in place a mechanism for bankers to report defaults \nin payments by buyers. The TReDS would also need to ensure adequate arbitration and \ngrievances redressal mechanism is in place.  \nRegulatory framework for TReDS  \n21. The TReDS, which undertakes clearing and settlement activities, would be governed by \nthe regulatory framework put in place by the Reserve Bank of India under the Payment and \nSettlement Systems Act 2007 (PSS Act). It will function as an authorised payment system \nunder the PSS Act 2007. The activities of the TReDS as well as those of the participants in \nthe TReDS would be governed by the relevant legal and regulatory provisions applicable to \nvario us stakeholders in the system. As such, the processes and procedures of the TReDS \nshould be compliant with such legal and regulatory provisions which may be issued and \namended from time to time by respective authorities.  \n 5 \n Eligibility criteria to set up and  operate the TReDS  \n22. Entities desirous of setting up and operating the TReDS should fulfil the following criteria.  \n      (a) Financial Criteria  \n(i) Since the TReDS will not be allowed to assume any credit risk, its minimum paid \nup equity capital shall be  Rs. 25 crore.  \n(ii) The foreign shareholding in the TReDS would be as per the extant foreign \ninvestment policy.  \n(iii) Entities, other than the promoters, will not be permitted to have shareholding in \nexcess of 10 per cent of the equity capital of the TReDS . \n(iv) The overall financial strength of the promoters/entity seeking to set up TReDS \nwould be an important criteria of assessment/selection.  \n      (b) Due diligence of promoters  \nThe entities and their promoters/promoter groups as defined in \nthe SEBI  (Issue  of Capital  & Disclosure Requirements)  Regulations, 2009 should be \n\u2018fit and proper\u2019 in order to be eligible to operate as TReDS. RBI would assess the \u2018fit \nand proper\u2019 status of t he applicants on the basis of their past record of sound \ncredentials and integrity; financial soundness and track record of at least 5 years in \nrunning their businesses. RBI may,  inter alia,  seek feedback on the applicants on \nthese or any other relevant as pects from other regulators, and enforcement and \ninvestigative agencies like Income Tax, CBI, Enforcement Directorate, SEBI, etc. as \ndeemed appropriate.  \n       (c) Technological capability  \nThe TReDS should have sound technological basis to support its oper ations. As such, \nthe TReDS should, at the minimum, fulfil the following technological requirements.  \n\uf0d8 TReDS shall be able to provide electronic platform for all the participants.  \n\uf0d8 Information about bills/ invoices, discounting and quotes shall be disseminated by the \nTReDS in real time basis, supported by a robust MIS system.  \n\uf0d8 The TReDS shall have a suitable Business Continuity Plan (BCP) including a \ndisaster recovery site.  \n\uf0d8 The TReDS shall have an online surveillance capability which monitors positions, \nprices and volumes in real time so as to check system manipulation.  \nApplication procedure for Authorisation  \n23. The general guidelines as well as the application format for any non- bank  entity to seek \nauthorisation under the PSS Act for operating a payment system are available \nat https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/86707.pdf  6 \n 24. Entities meeting the eligibility criteria as outlined in the Guidelines and desirous of setting \nup the TReDS, may apply in the prescribed format to the Chief General Manager, \nDepartment of Payment and Settlement Systems, Reserve Bank of India, 14th Floor, Central \nOffice Building, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Marg, Mumbai \u2013  400001, as and when the window \nfor receipt of applications for this purpose is opened.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 \n Annex  \nIllustrative Outline of Process flow under TReDS  \na) Corporate and other buyers, including Government Departments and Public Sector \nUndertakings, send purchase order to MSME seller (outside the purview of the TReDS).  \nb) MSME seller delivers the goods along with an invoice. There may or may not be an \naccepted bill of exchange depending on the trade practice between the buyer and the seller \n(outside the purview of the TReDS).  \nc) Thereafter, on the basis of either an invoice or a bill of exchange, the MSME seller creates \na \u2018factoring unit \u2019 (which would be a s tandard nomenclature used in the TReDS for an \ninvoice or a bill on the system) on TReDS. Subsequently, the buyer also logs on to TReDS \nand flags this factoring unit as \u2018accepted\u2019. In case of reverse factoring, this process of \ncreation of factoring unit could be initiated by the buyer.  \nd) Supporting documents evidencing movement of goods etc. may also be hosted by the \nMSME seller on the TReDS in accordance with the standard list or check -list of acceptable \ndocuments indicated in the TReDS.  \ne) The TReDS will standardise the time window available for buyers to \u2018accept\u2019 the factoring \nunits, which may vary based on the underlying document \u2013  an invoice or bill of exchange.  \nf) The TReDS may have either a single or two separate modules for transactions with \ninvoices  and transactions with Bills of Exchange, if so required. In either case, all \ntransactions routed through TReDS will, in effect, deal with factoring units irrespective of \nwhether they r epresent an invoice or a bill of  exchange.  \ng) Factoring units may be created in each module as required. Each such unit will have the \nsame sanctity and enforceability as allowed for physical instruments under the \u201cFactoring \nRegulation Act, 2011\u201d or under the \u201cNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881\u201d  \nh) The standard format / featur es of the \u2018factoring unit\u2019 will be decided by the TReDS \u2013  it \ncould be the entire bill/invoice amount or an amount after adjustment of tax / interest etc. as \nper existing market practice and as adopted as part of the TReDS procedure. However, \neach factoring unit will represent a confirmed obligation of the corporate and other buyers, \nincluding Government Departments and PSUs, and will carry the following relevant details \u2013  \ndetails of the seller and the buyer, issue date (could be the date of acceptance), due date, \ntenor (due date \u2013  issue date), balance tenor (due date \u2013  current date), amount due, unique \nidentification number generated by the TReDS, account details of seller for financier\u2019s \nreference (for credit at the time of financing), account details of bu yer for financier\u2019s \nreference (for debit on the due date), the underlying commodity (or service if enabled).  \ni) The TReDS should be able to facilitate filtering of factoring units (by financiers or \nrespective sellers / buyers) on any of the above parameter s. In view of the expected high \nvolumes to be processed under TReDS, this would provide the necessary flexibility of \noperations to the stakeholders.  8 \n j) The buyer\u2019s bank and account details form an integral feature of the factoring unit. The \ncreation of a f actoring unit on TReDS shall result in automatic generation of a notice / advice \nto the buyer\u2019s bank informing them of such units.  \nk) These factoring units will be available for financing by any of the financiers registered on \nthe system. The all -in-cost q uoted by the financier will be available on the TReDS. This price \ncan only be viewed by the MSME seller and not available for other financiers.  \nl) There will be a window period provided for financiers to quote their bids against factoring \nunits. Financiers  will be free to determine the time- validity of their bid price. Once accepted \nby the MSME seller, there will be no option for financiers to revise their bids quoted online.  \nm) The MSME seller is free to accept any of the bids and the financier will receiv e the \nnecessary intimation. Financiers will finance the balance tenor on the factoring unit.  \nn) Once a bid is accepted, the factoring unit will get tagged as \u201cfinanced\u201d and the funds will \nbe credited to the seller\u2019s account by the financier on T+2 basis (T  being the date of bid \nacceptance). The actual settlement of such funds will be as outlined under the Settlement \nsection.  \no) Once an accepted factoring unit has been financed by a financier, notice would be sent to \nbuyer\u2019s bank as well as seller\u2019s bank. Wh ile the buyer\u2019s bank would use this information to \nensure availability of funds and also handle the direct debit to the buyer\u2019s account on the \ndue date in favour of the financier (based on the settlement obligations generated by the \nTReDS), the seller\u2019s bank will use this input to adjust against the working capital of the \nMSME seller, as necessary (the TReDS procedures may, if necessary, also indicate that the \nproceeds of the accepted and financed factoring units will be remitted to the existing working \ncapital / cash credit account of the MSME seller). If agreed by members, the TReDS may \nalso provide the option to members, whereby the financiers would take direct exposure \nagainst the buyers rather than through their bankers.  \np) On the due date, the financier will have to receive funds from the buyer. The TReDS will \nsend due notifications to the buyers and their banks advising them of payments due. The \nactual settlement of such funds will be as outlined under the Settlement section.  \nq) Non -payment by the buyer on the due date to their banker should tantamount to a default \nby the buyer (and be reported as such as per regulatory procedures prescribed from time to \ntime) and enable the banker to proceed against the buyer. Any action initiated in this regard, \nwill be strictly non- recourse with respect to the MSME sellers and outside the purview of the \nTReDS.  \nr) These instruments may be rated by the TReDS on the basis of external rating of the \nbuyer, its credit history, the nature of the underlying instrument (invoic e or bill of exchange), \nprevious instances of delays or defaults by the buyer with respect to transactions on TReDS, \netc. \ns) The rated instruments may then be further transacted / discounted amongst the financiers \nin the secondary segment.  9 \n t) Similar to th e primary segment, any successful trade in the secondary segment will also \nautomatically result in a direct debit authority being enabled by the buyer\u2019s bank in favour of \nthe financier (based on the settlement obligations generated by the TReDS). In parall el, it \nwill also generate a \u2018notice of assignment\u2019 intimating the buyer to make the payment to the \nnew financier.  \nu) In the event that a factoring unit remains unfinanced, the buyer will pay the MSME seller \noutside of the TReDS.  \nIn order to meet the requir ements of various stakeholders, the TReDS should ensure to \nprovide various types of MIS reports including intimation of total receivables position, \nfinanced and unfinanced (to sellers); intimation of outstanding position, financed and \nunfinanced with detai ls of beneficiaries and beneficiary accounts to be credited (for buyers); \ntotal financed position for financiers; etc. Similarly, data on unfinanced factoring units in the \nmarket should also be made available by the TReDS. The system should also generate due \ndate reminders to relevant parties, notifications to be issued to bankers when a factoring unit \nis financed, notifications to be issued to buyers once a factoring unit related to their \ntransaction is traded in the secondary segment, etc.  \n_______ \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/TREDSGD0241C8FEF214D7DAD76487274D277429C833EB3386B498DBD18E5175164E3EB.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jul 02, 2018", "info": " \n \nRBI/201 8-19/5 \nFIDD.CO.LBS.BC.No. 2/02.01.001/2018 -19                                               July 2, 2018  \n \n The Chairm en and Managing Director s/Chief Executive Officer s \nSLBC Convenor Banks/Lead Banks  \n  Dear Sir/Madam  \n \nMASTER CIRCULAR \u2013 Lead Bank Scheme  \n                         \nThe Reserve Bank of India has issued a number of guidelines /instructions  on Lead \nBank Scheme from time to time.

The Study Group drew attention to the fact that commercial banks did not \nhave adequate presence in rural areas and also lacked the required rural orientation. \nThe Study Group, therefore, recommended the adoption of an 'Area Approach' to evolve pl ans and programmes for the development of an adequate banking and \ncredit structure in the rural areas.  \n(ii)  A Committee of Bankers on Branch Expansion Programme of public sector banks appointed by the Reserve Bank of India under the Chairmanship of Shri F.

Nariman (Nariman Committee) endorsed the idea of an \u2018A rea Approach\u2019  in its \nreport (November 1969) , recommending that in order to enable the P ublic Sector \nBanks to discharge their social responsibilities, each bank should concentrate on \ncertain dis tricts where it should act as a 'Lead Bank'.       \n(iii)  Pursuant to the above recommendations, the Lead Bank Scheme was \nintroduced by the Reserve Bank of India in December 1969.  The Scheme aims at \ncoordinating the activities of banks and other developmental agencies through various fora in order to achieve the objective of enhancing the flow of bank finance to  \nthe priority sector and other sectors and to promote banks ' role in the overall \ndevelopment of the rural sector.  For coordinating the activities in the district, a \nparticular bank is assigned \u2018L ead Bank\u2019 responsibility of the district. The Lead Bank \nis expected to assume a leadership role for coordinating the efforts of the credit \ninstitutions and the Government.    \n(iv)  In view of the several changes that had taken place in the financial sector, the \nLead Bank Scheme was last reviewed by the High Level Committee headed by Smt . \nUsha Thorat, Deputy Governor  of the Reserve Bank of India in 2009.   \n(v)  The High Level Committee held wide ranging discuss ions with various \nstakeholders viz. State Governments, banks, development institutions, academicians, NGOs, MFIs etc. and noted that the Scheme has been useful in \nachieving its original objectives of improvement in branch expansion, deposit 4 \n \nmobilisation and lending to the priority sector, especially in rural/semi urban areas.  \nThere was overwhelming consensus that the Scheme needs to continue.  Based on \nthe recommendations of the Committee, guidelines were issued to SLBC Convenor  \nbanks  and Lead B anks for implementation.  \n \n(vi)   Envisaging greater role for private sector banks,  Lead B anks were advised to \nensure that private sector banks are more closely involved in the implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme.  P rivate sector banks should involve themselves more \nactively by leveraging on Information Technology bringing in their expertise in strategic planning.  They should also involve themselves in the preparation as well \nas implementation of  the District Credit Plan.  \n \n(vii)  In view of the changes that  have taken place in  the financial sector over the \nyears, the Reserve Bank of India had constituted a \u201cCommittee of Executive Directors\u201d of the Bank to study the efficacy of the Scheme and suggest measures for its improvement. Based on the Committee\u2019s recommendati ons and feedback \nreceived from various stakeholders, certain \u2018action points\u2019 were issued to SLBC Convenors/Lead Banks and NABARD on April 6, 2018.  \n \n \n2.  Fora under Lead Bank Scheme \n2.1     Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC)  \nBlock Level Bankers\u2019 Committe e (BLBC) is a forum for achieving coordination \nbetween credit institutions and field level development agencies at the block level . \nThe forum prepares and reviews  the implementation of the Block Credit Plan and \nalso resolves operational problems in the implementation of the credit programmes \nof banks. The Lead District Manager (LDM) of the district is the Chairman of the \nBlock Level Bankers\u2019 Committee. All the banks operat ing in the block including the \nDistrict Central Co-operative Banks , RRB s, Block Develo pment Officer, technical \nofficers in the block, such as extension officers for agriculture, industries and co-\noperatives are members of the Committee. BLBC meetings are held at quarterly intervals.  To strengthen the BLBC forum which operates at the base l evel of the \nLead Bank Scheme, it is necessary that all branch managers attend BLBC meetings and enrich the discussions with their valuable inputs. Controlling Heads of banks may also attend a few of the BLBC meetings selectively. Participation by the Distr ict 5 \n \nDevelopment Manager (DDM) of NABARD in BLBCs would ensure better and more \nmeaningful discussions for the development of the Block. Therefore, NABARD has \nbeen advised that DDMs should  attend all Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee meetings \nin their district  and actively participate in the credit planning exercise and review \nmeetings at the block level.  The Lead District Officer ( LDO) of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia ( RBI) selectively attends the BLBC meetings. The representatives of \nPanchayat Samitis are also i nvited to attend the meetings at half yearly intervals so \nas to share their knowledge and experience on rural development in the credit planning exercise. \n \n \n2.2 District Consultative Committee (DCC)  \n2.2.1 Constitution of DCC  \nThe District Consultative Comm ittees  were constituted in the early seventies  as a \ncommon forum at the district level for bankers as well as Government \nagencies/departments to facilitate  coordination in implementing various \ndevelopmental activities under the Lead Bank S cheme.  The Distr ict Collector is the \nChairman of the DCC meetings. Reserve Bank of India, NABARD, all the commercial banks in the district, co- operative banks including the District Central \nCooperative Bank (DCCB), RRBs, various State Government departments and allied agencies are the members of the DCC.  The Lead District Officer (LDO) represents the Reserve Bank as a member of the DCC. The Lead District Manager (LDM) convenes the DCC meetings. The Director of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises \nDevelopment Institute (MSM E-DI) in the district is an invitee in districts where MSME \nclusters are located to discuss issues concerning MSMEs.  \n2.2.2 Conduct of DCC Meetings  \n \ni) DCC meeting s should be convened by the L ead Banks at quarterly intervals.  \nii) At the DCC level, sub- committees , as appropriate may , be set up to work \nintensively on specific issues and submit reports to the DCC for its consideration.  \niii) DCC should give adequate feedback to the SLBC on various issues that need to \nbe discussed on a wider platform, so that these receive adequate attention at the \nState Level.  \n 6 \n \n2.2.3 Agenda for DCC Meetings  \n \nWhile Lead Banks are expected to address the problems particular to the concerned \ndistricts, some of the important areas which are common to all districts which the \nlead banks shoul d invariably discuss in the fora are as under:  \ni) Review of progress under financial inclusion plan (FIP).  \nii) The specific issues inhibiting and enabling IT enabled financial inclusion  \niii) Issues  to facilitate 'enablers' and remove/ minimise  'impeders' for banking \ndevelopment for inclusive growth  \niv) Monitoring initiatives for providing 'Credit Plus' activities by banks and State \nGovernments such as setting up of Financial Literacy  Centres (FLCs) and RSETI\n# type Training Institutes for providing skills and capacity building to \nmanage businesses.  \nv) Scaling up financial literacy efforts to achieve financial inclusion.  \nvi) Review of performance of banks under District Credit Plan (DCP)  \nvii) Flow  of credit to priority sector and weaker sections of the society  \nviii) Doubling of Farmers\u2019  Income by 2022  \nix) Assistance under Government sponsored schemes  \nx) Grant of educational loans  \nxi) Progress under SHG -  bank linkage  \nxii) SME financing & bottlenecks thereof, if any  \nxiii) Timely submission of data by banks  \nxiv) Review of relief measures (in case of natural cal amities wherever applicable)  \nThe above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. The lead banks may include any other agenda item considered necessary.  \n \n# Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) should be more actively involved and monitored at  various fora of LBS particularly at the DCC level. Focus \nshould be on development of skills to enhance the credit absorption capacity in the area and renewing the training programmes towards sustainable micro enterprises. RSETIs should design specific programmes for each district/ block, keeping in view the skill mapping and the potential of the region for  necessary  skill training and skill \nup gradation of the rural youth in the district.  \n 7 \n \n2.2.4 Role of LDMs  \nAs the effectiveness of the Lead Bank Scheme depends on the dynamism of the \nDistrict Collectors and the Lead District Managers (LDMs), with supportive role of the \nRegional/Zonal Office, the office of LDM should be sufficiently strengthened;  with \nappropriate infrastructural support being the focal point for the successful \nimplementation of the Lead Bank Scheme. Apart from the provision of a separate \noffice space, technical infrastructure like computers, printer, data connectivity, etc. which are basic necessities for LDMs to discharge their core respons ibilities may be \nprovided to LDMs\u2019 Office without exception.  Officers of appropriate level , attitude \nand possessing requisite leadership skills should be posted as LDMs. Additionally, it \nis suggested that a dedicated vehicle may be provided to LDMs\u2019 to facilitate closer \nliaison with the bank officials, district administration officials as also to organise/ \nattend various financial literacy initiatives and meetings. The absence of a specialist \nofficer/assistant for data entry/analysis is a common and major  issue faced by LDMs. \nLiberty to hire the services of skilled computer operator may be given to the LDMs to overcome the shortage of staff/ in case appropriate staff is not posted at LDM office\n.  \nFurther, for successful functioning of the Lead Bank Scheme, we expect Lead Banks \nto go the extra mile to provide facilities over and above the bare minimum to these \ncritical field functionaries. Apart from the usual role of LDMs like convening meetings of the DCC/DLRC and periodical meetings of DDM/LDO/ Government officials for resolving outstanding issues etc., the new functions envisaged for LDMs include the \nfollowing:  \ni) Monitoring the implementation of the D istrict Credit Plan  \nii) Associate with the setting up of Financial Lit eracy Centres (FLCs), RSETIs by \nbanks  \niii) Associate with organizing financial literacy camps by FLCs and rural branches \nof banks.  \niv) Holding annual sensitisation workshops for banks and Government officials \nwith participation by NGOs/Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)  \nv) Arranging for quarterly awareness  and feedback public meetings, grievance \nredressal etc.  \n 8 \n \n2.2.5 Quarterly Public Meeting and Grievance Redressal  \nThe Lead District Manager should convene a quarterly public meeting at various \nlocations in the district in coordination with the LDO of Reserve Bank, banks having \npresence in the area and other stakeholders to generate awareness of the various \nbanking policies and regulations relating to the common person, obtain feedback \nfrom the public and provide grievance redressal to the extent possible at such \nmeetings or facilitate approaching the appropriate machinery for such redressal.  \n \n2.2.6 District Level Review Committee (DLRC) Meetings \nDLRC meetings are Chaired by the District Collector and attended by members of \nthe District Consultative Committ ee (DCC). Public Representatives i.e. Local \nMPs/MLAs/ Zilla Parishad Chiefs are also invited to these meetings.  The DLRC \nmeetings should be convened by the L ead Banks at  least once in a quarter.  The \nDLRC is a forum to review the pace and quality of the i mplementation of various \nprogrammes under the Lead Bank Scheme in the district . Hence,  association of non-\nofficials is considered useful.  Lead B anks are required to ensure the presence of \npublic representatives in DLRC meetings as far as possible. Therefore, L ead B anks \nshould fix the date of DLRC meetings with due regard to the convenience of the representatives of the public i.e. MPs/MLAs etc. and invite and involve them in all functions conducted by the banks in the districts, such as opening of new bank ing \noutlets , distribution of Kisan Credit Cards, SHG credit linkage programmes , etc. \nResponses to queries from public representatives need to be accorded highest \npriority and attended to promptly. The follow up of the DLRC\u2019s decisions is required \nto be dis cussed in the DCC meetings.   \n2.2.7 DCC/DLRC meetings - Annual Calendar of Meetings  \ni) DCC and DLRC are the important fora facilitating coordination among commercial \nbanks, Government agencies and others at the district level to review and find \nsolutions to the problems hindering developmental activities. Therefore, it is \nnecessary that all the members participate and deliberate in these  meetings. On a \nreview of the DCC/DLRC meetings, it was observed that late receipt/non- receipt of \nintimation of the date of meetings, clash of dates with other events, commonality of \ndates etc.  hinder participation of members in these meetings, thus undermining the prime objective of conducting the above meetings.  9 \n \nii)   Lead B anks have, therefore, been advised to prepare an A nnual S chedule of \nDCC and DLRC meetings on Calendar year basis for all districts in consultation with \nthe Chairperson of the meetings, L ead District Officer of the RBI and P ublic \nRepresentatives in case of DLRC.  This yearly Calendar should be prepared in the \nbeginning of each year and circulated to all members as advance intimation for \nblocking future dates to attend the DCC and DLRC meetings and the meetings \nshould be conducted as per the calendar.  While preparing the Calendar , it should be \nensured that DCC and DLRC meetings are not  held simultaneously.  \n2.3 State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)  \n \n2.3.1 Constitution of SLBC  \ni) The State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) was  constituted in April 1977, as an \napex inter -institutional forum to create adequate coordination machinery in all States, \non a uniform basis for development of the State. SLBC is chaired by the Chairman & \nManaging Director (CMD) /Executive Director of the C onvenor Bank.    It comprises \nrepresentatives of commercial banks, RRBs, State Coop erative Banks, RBI, \nNABARD, heads of Government departments including representatives from \nNational Commission for Scheduled Castes/Tribes, National Horticulture Board, Khadi & Village Industries Commission etc. and representatives of financial institution s operating in a State, who come together and sort out coordination \nproblems at the policy implementation level. Representatives of various organizations from different sectors of the economy like industry bodies, retail \ntraders, exporters , farmers\u2019 unions,  etc. are special invitees in the SLBC meetings for \ndiscussing their specific problems, if any. SLBC meetings are held on quarterly \nbasis. The responsibility for  convening the SLBC meetings would be of the SLBC \nConvenor Bank of the State.  \n \nii) Recognising that SLBCs, primarily as a committee of bankers at the State level , \nplay an important role in the development of the State, illustrative guidelines on the \nconduct of State Level Bankers Committee meetings have been issued.  \n2.3.2 Conduct of SLBC Meetings  \ni)  SLBC meetings are required to be held regularly at quarterly intervals. The \nmeetings are chaired by the Chairman & Managing Director (CMD) /Executive \nDirector of the Convenor Bank and co-chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary or 10 \n \nDevelopment Commis sioner of the State concerned.  In  cases  where the Managing  \nDirector/Chief  Executive Officer/Executive  Director  of the SLBC  Convenor  Bank  is \nunable to attend SLBC Meetings,  the Regional  Director  of the RBI shall co-chair  the \nmeetings  along with the Additio nal Chief  Secretary/Development  Commissioner  of \nthe State  concerned.  A High Level of participation in SLBC/UTLBC meetings \nensures an effective and desired outcome with meaningful discussion on issues of \npublic policy of both the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India.  \nii)  The Chief Minister/Finance Minister and senior level officers of the State/RBI (of \nthe rank of Deputy Governor / Executive Director) may be invited to attend the SLBC \nmeetings.  Further, the State Chief Ministers are encouraged to attend at least one SLBC meeting in a year.  \n \niii)  State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee meetings should primarily focus on policy issues \nwith participation of only the senior functionaries of the banks/ Government Departments.  All routine issues may be del egated to sub- committee(s) of the SLBC.  \nA Steering Sub- committee may be constituted in the SLBC to deliberate on agenda \nproposals from different stakeholders and finalise a compact agenda for the SLBC meetings. Typically, the Sub- Committee could consist of  SLBC Convenor, RBI & \nNABARD representatives & senior State Government representative from the concerned department, e.g. Finance/ Institutional Finance and two to three banks having major presence.  \n \niv)  Other issue- specific sub -committees may be constit uted as required.  The sub \ncommittees may examine the specific issues  relating to agriculture, micro, \nsmall/medium industries/enterprises, handloom finance, export promotion and financial inclusion, etc.  in-depth and devise solutions/recommendations for adoption \nby the full committee. They are expected to meet more frequently than the SLBC. \nThe composition of the sub- committee s and subjects/ specific issues \nimpeding/enabling financial inclusion to be deliberated upon, may vary from State to State depending on the specific problems/issues faced by the States.  \n \nv)   The secretariat/offices of the SLBC should be sufficiently strengthened to enable \nthe SLBC Convenor Bank to effectively discharge its functions.  \n \nvi) The various fora at lower levels may give adequate feedback to the SLBC on \nissues that need to be discussed on a wider platform.  \n 11 \n \nvii)   Several institutions and academicians are engaged in research,  studies etc. that \nhave implications for sustainable development in agriculture and MSME sector. \nEngaging with such research institutions and academicians would be useful in \nbringing in new ideas for furthering the objectives of the Lead Bank Scheme. The \nSLBCs may, therefore, identify such academicians and researchers and invite them \nas 'special invitees' to attend SLBC meetings occasionally both for adding value to \nthe discussions and also associate them with studies appropriate to the State. Other \n'special invitees' may be invited to attend SLBC meetings depending on the agenda items/issues to be discuss ed in the meetings.  \n \nviii)  The activities of NGOs in facilitating and channeling credit to the low income \nhouseholds are expected to increase in the coming years. Several corporate houses \nare also engaged in corporate social responsibility activities for  sustainable \ndevelopment. A linkage with such NGOs/Corporate houses operating in the area to \nensure that the NGOs/corporates provide the necessary 'credit plus' services can \nhelp leverage bank credit for inclusive growth. Success stories could be presented in \nSLBC meetings to serve as models that could be replicated.  \n  \n2.3.3  Revised Agenda for SLBC Meetings \n \n1.

Any other item, w ith the permission of the Chair  \n \nThe above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. SLBC Convenor Banks may include \nany other agenda item considered necessary.  \n \n2.3.4   SLBC - Yearl y Calendar of Meetings \n \ni)  To improve the effectiveness and streamline  the functioning of SLBC/UTLBC \nmeetings, SLBC Convernor B anks have been advised to prepare a yearly calendar \nof programmes (calendar year basis) in the beginning of the year itself, for  14 \n \nconducting the meetings. The calendar of programmes should clearly specify the cut \noff dates for data submission to SLBC and acceptance thereof by the SLBC \nConvenor. This yearly calendar should be circulated to all the concerned as an \nadvance intimation f or blocking of future dates of senior functionaries of various \nagencies like Central Government , State Governments, banks, RBI , etc. The \nSLBC/UTLBC meetings should be conducted as per the calendar under all \ncircumstances. The agenda should also be circulat ed in advance without waiting for \nthe data from defaulting banks. The matter should, however, be taken up with the \ndefaulting banks in the SLBC meeting. In addition, the SLBC Convernor Bank should \nwrite a letter in this regard to the controlling office of the defaulting banks under advice to the Regional Office of RBI. The SLBC Convenor Bank will, however, \ncontinue to follow -up with banks for timely data submission. Further, in case the \nChief Minister, Finance Minister or other very senior functionaries are not able to \nattend the SLBC on some very rare occasion, then if so desired by them, a special \nSLBC meeting can be held.  Following broad guidelines should be used for \npreparation of the calendar of programmes:   \n \nActivity  To be completed by (Date)  \nPrepar ation of calendar of SLBC/UTLBC \nmeetings and intimation to all the concerned of \nthe cut -off dates for submission of data and \ndates of meetings as per the dateline given \nbelow.  15th January  every year  \nReminder regarding the exact date of meeting \nand submis sion of data by banks to SLBC  15 days before end of the \nquarter  \nDead line for receipt of information/data by \nSLBC Convenor Bank 15 days from the end of the \nquarter  \nDistribution of agenda cum background papers  20 days from the end of the \nquarter  \nHolding of the meeting  \n Within 45 days from the end of \nthe quarter  \nForwarding the minutes of the meeting to all \nstakeholders  Within 10 days from holding the \nmeeting \nFollow -up of the action points emerged from the \nmeeting To be completed within 30 days \nof forward ing the minutes (for \nreview in the next meeting)  \n      \nii)   The objective of preparing the calendar of meetings in the beginning of the year \nis to ensure adequate notice of these meetings and timely compilation and dispatch 15 \n \nof agenda papers to all stakeholders. It also ensures clear cut guidelines for the \nsubmission of data to SLBC C onvenors by participating banks & Government \nDepartments. It is expected to save precious time of SLBC C onvenors otherwise \nspent in taking dates from various senior functionar ies attending these SLBC \nmeetings.  \niii)  SLBC C onvenor Banks  need to appreciate the advantages of ensuring \nadherence to the yearly calendars.  SLBC C onvenor Banks have therefore been \nadvised to give wide publicity to the annual calendar at the beginning of the year and ensure that dates of senior functionaries expected to attend the meetings are blocked for all meetings by their offices.  In case, despite blocking dates, if for some \nreason, the senior functionary is not able to attend the meeting, the meet ing should \nbe held as planned in the calendar.  More importantly, the data for review in these \nmeetings should be received as per deadlines set in the calendar and those who do \nnot submit the data in time should be asked to explain the reasons for delay in  \nsending the data that may be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Under no \ncircumstance , should the preparation of the agenda be delayed beyond the dates \nstipulated as per the calendar.  \n \n2.3.5 SLBC Website \u2013 Standardisation of information /data \n \nSLBC Convenor  Banks are required to maintain the SLBC websites where all \ninstructions pertaining to LBS and Government Sponsored Schemes are made \navailable and are accessible to the common man desiring any information relating to the conduct of meetings or State- wise data/ bank-wise performance. In order to \nstandardize the information and data that is to be made available on the SLBC \nwebsite, an indicative list of the information & data is given in the Annex II\n.  SLBCs \nshould arrange t o place the prescribed minimum information on the websites of \nSLBCs of their bank and keep it updated regularly, at least on quarterly basis. Banks may note that the list is only indicative and SLBCs are free to put any additional \ninformation considered relevant for the State.  \n \n2.3.6 Liaison with State Government  \n \nSLBC Convenor  Banks are expected to co- ordinate the activities of all banks in the \nState, discuss with State Government officials , the operational problems in lending, 16 \n \nextending necessary suppor t for banking development and to achieve the objective \nof financial inclusion.  \n2.3.7 Capacity Building/Training/Sensitization Programmes  \n \ni) There is a need for sensitising the District Collectors and CEOs of Zilla Parishads \non banks and banking in general as also on the specific scope and role of the Lead Bank Scheme. In each State, a full day \u2018Sensitisation W orkshop\u2019  may be convened \nby the SLBC Convenor  Bank every year , preferably in April/May . Such sensitisation \nshould form part of the probationary trai ning of such officers. Further, as soon as \nthey are posted in a district, the SLBC may arrange for exposure visits for the District Collectors to the SLBC C onvenor\u2019s office for sensitisation and understanding of the \nLead Bank Scheme.  \n \nii) Staff at the operational level of banks and government agencies associated with implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme need to be aware of the latest developments and emerging opportunities. There is need for staff sensitisation/ \ntraining/seminars, etc. at periodic interv als on an ongoing basis  \n \n3. Implementation of Lead Bank Scheme  \n3.1 Preparation of credit plans  \nPlanning plays an important role in the implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme \nand a bottom -up approach is adopted to map the existing potential for development .  \nUnder LBS, planning starts with identifying block wise/activity wise potential estimated for various sectors.  \n3.2 Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs)  \ni) Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) are a step towards decentralized credit \nplanning with the basic objective of mapping the existing potential for development through bank credit. PLPs take into account the long term physical potential, availability of infrastructure support, marketing facilities, and policies/programmes of Government etc.  NABARD to take measures  to ensure that PLPs should be more \nfocussed and implementable so that banks can utilize them  more gainfully while \npreparing the Branch Credit Plan. PLPs should emphasise on promotion of 17 \n \nsustainable agricultural practices suitable to local condi tions. While preparing the \nPLPs, the focus must be on identifying processes and projects that :  \na. reduce the carbon foot -print,  \nb. prevent the overuse of fertilizers,  \nc. ensure efficient utilisation of water and  \nd. address agricultural pollution issues.  \n \nThe plans m ust also focus on promoting innovative farming systems such as organic \nfarming, bio dynamic farming, permaculture and sustainable small -scale  farming, as \nalso promoting Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs)  and Farmers\u2019 Markets. Such \ninitiatives must be supported by appropriate investments and project finance \nframeworks. \n[[ \nii) A pre -PLP meeting is convened by LDM during June every year to be attended by \nbanks, Government agencies, etc., to reflect their views and concerns regarding credit potential (sector/ activity -wise) and deliberate on major financial and socio-\neconomic developments in the district in the last one year and priorities to be set out for inclusion in the PLP.  The DDM of NABARD make s a presentation in this meeting \noutlining the major requir ements of information for preparing the PLP for the \nfollowing year. The preparation of PLP for the next year is to be completed by August every year to enable the State Government to factor in the PLP projections.   \niii) The procedure for preparing the Dis trict Credit Plan is as follows:  \na) Controlling Offices of commercial banks and Head Office of RRB and DCCB/LDB circulate the accepted block -wise/activity -wise potential to all their \nbranches for preparing the Branch Credit Plans (BCP) by their respective branch managers.  Banks should ensure that the exercise of preparation of branch/block plans is completed in time by all branches so that the Credit Plans become operational on time.  \nb) A special Block Level Bankers' Committee (BLBC) meeting is  convened for \neach block where the Branch Credit Plans are discussed and aggregated to \nform the Block Credit Plan.  The DDM and the LDM guide the BLBC in \nfinalizing the plan,  ensuring that the Block Credit Plan is in tune with the 18 \n \npotentials identified activity -wise includi ng in respect of Government \nSponsored Schemes .   \n \nc) All the Block Credit Plans of the district are  aggregated by the LDM to form \nthe District Credit Plan  (DCP) . This plan indicates an analytical assessment of \nthe credit needs of the district to be deployed by all the financial institutions \noperating in the district and the total quantum of funds to be earmarked as \ncredit by all the financial institutions for a new financial year.  The \nZonal/Controlling Offices of banks, while finalizing their business plans for the \nyear, should take into account the commitments made in the DCP which should be ready well in time before the performance budgets are finalized.   \n \nd) The District Credit Plan is then placed before the DCC by the Lead District \nManager for final acceptanc e/approval.  All the District Credit Plans are \neventually aggregated into a State Level Credit Plan to be prepared by SLBC \nConvenor B ank and launched by the 1st of April every year.   \n \ne) The corporate business targets for branches, blocks, districts and stat es may \nbe aligned with the Annual Credit Plans (ACP) to ensure better implementation. The Controlling Offices of the banks in each state should synchronize their inter nal business plans with the ACP.\n \n3.3   Monitoring the Performance of C redit Plans \nThe per formance of the credit plans is reviewed in the v arious fora created under the \nLead Bank Scheme as shown below:  \n \nAt Block Level  Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC)  \nAt District Level  District Consultative Committee (DCC) & District \nLevel Review Committee (DLRC)  \nAt State Level  State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)  \n \n                                                            \nMonitoring of LBS by RBI -  Monitoring Information System (MIS)  \ni)  Data on Annual Credit Plan (ACP)  is an important element to revi ew the flow of \ncredit in the State.  ACP formats are aligned with  the extant reporting guidelines on 19 \n \npriority sector lending. Accordingly, the ACP is to be prepared considering the \ncategories of priority sector that would include Agriculture, Micro, Small and Medium \nEnterprises, Export Credit, Education,  Housing, Social Infrastructure, Renewable \nEnergy and Others.  Further, it has been decided that bank loans to Micro/Small and \nMedium Enterprises (Services), engaged in providing or rendering of services as \ndefined in terms of investment in equipment under MSMED Act, 2006, shall qualify \nunder priority sector without any credit cap.  Accordingly, the applicable loan limits \nper borrower to Micro/Small Enterprises (\u20b9 5 crore) and Medium Enterprises (\u20b9 10 \ncrore) under the MSMEs Sector (Services) for classification under priority sector \nhave  been removed.  The reporting statement for ACP target is LBS -MIS-I (Annex \nIII), statement  for disbursement and outstanding LBS -MIS-II (Annex IV) and ACP \nachievement vis -\u00e0-vis ACP target , LBS- MIS-III (Annex V ).  SLBC Convenor B anks/ \nLead Banks have been advised to prepare the statements LBS MIS I, II and III as \nper the revised formats starting from the financial year 2018- 19.  They should \nprepare the bank group wise statements of LBS- MIS-I, II and III as per the \nprescribed formats and also place these statements for meaningful review in  all DCC \nand SLBC meetings.  \nii)  In order to maintain consi stency and integrity of data with the A ll-India data of \nscheduled commercial banks and facilitate a meaningful review/analysis of data, the \nACP data needs to be grouped separately for scheduled commercial banks and other banks like State Cooperative B anks , DCCBs , etc. while presenting in the \nDCC/SLBC meetings and submitting to our regional offices.  The data pertaining to  \nscheduled commercial banks needs to be further grouped into public sector banks, private sector banks , Regional Rural Banks and Small Fin ance Banks to know the \nbank group wise position.   \n3.4   Revised mechanism of  Data Flow for LBS fora meetings \n \nAt present, discussions at the quarterly meetings of the various LBS fora viz. State \nLevel Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC), District level Consultative  Committee (DCC) and  \nBlock Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) primarily focus on the performance of \nbanks in the disbursement of loans vis -a-vis the allocated target under the Annual \nCredit Plan. The integrity & timeliness of the data submitted by banks for the purpose has been an issue as a significant portion of this data is manually compiled and entered into the Data Management Systems of the SLBC Convener Banks. The 20 \n \nextent to which this data corresponds with the data present in the Core Banking \nSolution ( CBS)  of the respective banks also varies significantly. Therefore, there is \nneed of a standardized system to be developed on the website maintained by each SLBC to enable uploading and downloading of the data pertaining to the Block, \nDistrict as well as th e State. The relevant data must also be directly downloadable \nfrom the CBS and/ or MIS of the banks with a view to keeping manual intervention to \na minimal level in the process. The procedure relating to the envisaged intervention \nin this area is given bel ow: \nManagement of Data Flow at LBS Fora \u2013  Procedure \ni. Each bank\u2019s CBS should have a provision to generate a report pertaining to all LBS related data/ tables to Excel. This data should have information pertaining to all the branches operating in the state including fields/ columns for District & Block name. Access to Download & Export this data from the bank \u2019s CBS should \nbe given to the Controlling Offices of the b anks who would be solely responsible \nfor the process of \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 for all districts/ blocks  within their jurisdiction.  \n \nii. The \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 process is the process of uploading this Excel file (downloaded in step (i) above) on the SLBC websites. SLBC websites should \nhave a provision to \u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 all the data present in the Excel Sheet on t he \ndatabase of the SLBC w ebsite. This would obviate any manual \u2018data entry\u2019 at the \nSLBC/ Controlling Office level.  \n \niii. To facilitate the above functionality, each SLBC Convenor Bank would have to add this \u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 functionality to their SLBC website along with the requisite capabilities at the back -end. \n \niv. The SLBC website would, thus, effectively work as a data aggregation platform. Further, data analysis capabilities could also be added to the SLBC websites depending on the available resources.  \n \nv. The SLBC websites should provide access to LDMs to download district and \nblock specific data directly from this website thus ensuring integrity and timely availability of data.  \n 21 \n \nvi. There could still be some data pertaining to State Government Schemes/ other \ndata that is not available on the CBS or MIS of the banks. This would have to be \ncollated at the Controlling Office level as is done now. At the SLBC website, functionalities could be provided to enter this data too. This could then be downloaded by the LDMs for district/ block level reports. Banks may also add \nOpen Format fields like \u2018text boxes\u2019 for data or information that is special or is \nentered/ used once in a while.   \n \nvii. Such a system ensures that LDMs & SLBC Convenor Banks have to do zero or minimal data e ntry/ feeding and all data is entered by a single \u2018custodian of data\u2019 \nwhich is the Controlling Office of each b ank. Any information to be provided by \nGovernment extension agencies could also be similarly uploaded.  \n Necessary modifications may be made on the SLBC websites and to the CBS & \nMIS systems of all banks to implement the envisaged data flow mechanism . \n \n4.   Assignment of Lead Bank Responsibility  \n \ni) Lead Bank Scheme is administered by the Reserve Bank of India since 1969. The \nassignment of L ead Bank responsibility to designated banks in every district is done \nby the Reserve Bank of India following a detailed procedure formulated for this \npurpose. As on June 30, 2018, 20  public sector banks and one private sector  bank  \nhave been assigned Lead Bank responsibility in 7 14 districts of the country.   \nii) State Level Bankers \u2019 Committee  (SLBC) /Union Territory Level Bankers' \nCommittee (UTLBC) , as an apex level for um at the State /Union Territory (UT)  level, \ncoordinates the activities of the financial institutions and Government departments in \nthe State/Union Territory under  the Lead Bank Scheme. SLBC/UTLBC Convenorship \nis assigned to banks for this purpose. As on June 30, 2018 , the SLBC/UTLBC \nconvenorship of 29 States and  7 Union Territories has been assigned to 15 public \nsector banks and one private sector bank.  A List of State /UT wise SLBC /UTLBC  \nConvenor  Banks  and district  wise Lead Banks is given  in Annex  I. \niii) The Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) has been extended to the districts in the \nmetropolitan areas , thus bringing the entire country under the fold of the Lead Bank \nScheme.  22 \n \n5.   Banking Penetration  \n \ni)  Over the years, the focus of the Lead Bank Scheme has shifted to inclusive \ngrowth and financial inclusion. The use of Information Technology (IT) and \nintermediaries has enabled banks to increase the outreach, scale and depth of \nbanking services at affordable cost.   \nii)   SLBC Convenor B anks / L ead Banks are advised to focus attention on the need \nfor achieving 100% financial inclusion  through penetration of banking services in the \nrural areas. Upon issuance of DBR revised guidelines on \u2018Rationalisation of Branch \nAuthorisation Policy\u2019 on May 18, 2017 clarifying on \u2018Banking Outlet \u2019, banks were \nadvised to consider opening of a CBS -enabled banking outlet or a part time banking \noutlet , as the case may be,  in unbanked rural centres.  \n \niii)  SLBC Convenor Banks should take up with the State Governments , impeders \nsuch as issues of road/digital connectivity, conducive law and order situation, uninterrupted power supply, adequate security , etc. for ensuring banking expansion \nat all centres where penetration by the formal banking system is required. However, these impeders should not inhibit the scaling up of financial inclusion initiatives.  \n \n5.1   Roadmap for providing banking services in unbanked villages \nIn November 2009, a roadmap to provide  banking services in villages with population \nmore than 2000 was rolled out .  All the identified villages have been provided with \nbanking services through branches, business correspondents or through other modes such as ATMs and mobile vans.\n Later, in June 2012, a roadmap to provide \nbanking services in unbanked villages with less than 2,000 population was rolled out . \nSLBC Convenor B anks and L ead Banks were advised to complete the process of \nproviding banking services in unbanked villages with population below 2000 by August 14, 2015.  \n \n5.2 Roadmap for opening brick and mortar branches in villages with \npopulation more than 5000 without a bank branch of a schedul ed commercial \nbank  \n \nAs brick and mortar branches are an integral component  of financial inclusion, it was \ndecided to focus on villages with population above 5000 without a bank branch of a 23 \n \nscheduled commercial bank. This was to  enable banks to provide qual ity financial \nservices and timely support to BC outlets that would help in sustaining and \nstrengthening the services provided through BCs and also ensure close supervision \nof BC operations. Accordingly, SLBC Convenor B anks were advised to identify \nvillages  with population above 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled \ncommercial bank in their State and allot these villages among scheduled commercial \nbanks (including Regional Rural Banks) for opening of branches.   \n \n5.3   Aligning roadmap for unbanked villages having population more than \n5000 with revised Guidelines on Branch Authorisation Policy  \n \nIn terms of circular DBR.No.BAPD.BC.69/22.01.001/2016- 17 dated May 18, 2017  \nissued by DBR on \u2018Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy -  Revision of \nGuidelines \u2019, final  guidelines on \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 have been issued with a view to \nfacilitate financial  inclusion as also to provide flexibility to  banks on the choice of \ndelivery c hannel.  Accordingly, SLBC Convenor Banks have been  advised to identify \nall unbanked rural centres (URCs) in the State, compile and maintain an updated list \nof all such centres.  The updated list should be displayed on the website of each \nSLBC to facilitate  banks to choose/indicate the place/centre where they wish to open \na \u2018banking outlet\u2019.  \n \nii)   Further, SLBC Convenor Banks have been advised that in order to comply with \nthe criteria of opening at least 25 percent of the total banking outlets in unbanked \nrural centres in Tier 5 & 6  centres , as  prescribed  vide DBR  circular dated May 18, \n2017,  banks should give priority to villages without a banking outlet having population more than 5000 (i.e. Tier 5 centres) and ensure that all such villages under thei r jurisdiction are covered with a CBS- enabled Banking Outlet on priority \nbasis.  \n \niii)   The updated list of unbanked rural centres should be tabled in all SLBC \nmeetings during discussions on the progress of providing banking services in \nunbanked rural centres.  \n \n6. Credit Deposit Ratio ( CD Ratio)  \n \n6.1   CD Ratio of B anks in Rural and Semi -Urban Areas  \n 24 \n \nBanks have been advised to achieve a CD Ratio of 60% in respect of their rural and \nsemi -urban branches separately on an A ll-India basis. While it is not nec essary that \nthis ratio should be achieved separately , branch- wise, district -wise or region- wise, \nthe banks should,  nevertheless, ensure that wide disparity in the ratios between \ndifferent States / Regions is avoided in order to minimise regional imbalance in credit \ndeployment. The credit dispensation in certain districts is very low, as a result of \nvarious factors such as lack of necessary infrastructure, varying ability of different \nregions to absorb credit, etc. B anks may review the performance of their bank \nbranches in such areas and take necessary steps to augment the credit flow. The \nLead Banks may discuss the problem in all its aspects with the other financial \ninstitutions in the district and also in the DCC forum.  \n \n \n6.2    Implementation of the Recomm endations of the Expert Group on CD \nRatio  \n \n \ni)   An Expert Group was constituted by the Government of India to go into the nature \nand magnitude of the problem of low CD Ratio across States / Regions and to \nsuggest steps to overcome the problem. The Expert Group examined the problems \nand causes of low CD  Ratio and made recommendations . As per the \nrecommendations, the CD R atio of banks should be monitored at different levels \nbased on the following parameters \u2013  \nInstitution / Level  Indicator  \nIndividual Banks a t Head Office  Cu + RIDF  \nState Level (SLBC)  Cu + RIDF  \nDistrict Level  Cs \n \nWhere:  \n \nCu = Credit as per place of Utilization  \nCs = Credit as per place of Sanction  \nRIDF = Total Resource support provided to States under RIDF \nFurther, banks are advised that:  \n \n\u2022 In the districts having CD R atio less than 40, Special Sub- Committees (SSCs) \nof the DCC shall be set up to monitor the CD Ratio. \n\u2022 Districts having CD  Ratio between 40 and 60, shall  be monitored under the \nexisting system by the DCC, and  \n\u2022 The district with CD Ratio of less than 20 need to be treated on a special \nfooting.  \n 25 \n \nii)  Special Sub- Committee s (SSCs) of the DCC should be set up in the districts \nhaving CD R atio less than 40 percent , in order to monitor the CD  Ratio and to draw \nup Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs) to increase the CD R atio. The Lead District \nManager (LDM) is designated as the C onvenor of the SSC which,  in addition to the \nDistrict Co-ordinators of banks functioning in the area, should comprise of the LDO \nof RBI, the DDM of NABARD, the District Planning Officer or a representative of the \nCollector duly empowered to take decisions on behalf of the district administration.  \nThe functions of the Special Sub- Committee are as under:  \n\u2022 The SSCs should draw up Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs) for improving the \nC D Ratio in their districts on a self -set graduated basis.  \n\u2022 For this purpose,  the SSC should hold a special meeting immediately after its \nconstitution and on the basis of the various ground level parameters, set for \nitself, a target for increasing the CD Ratio initially for the current year. It will \nalso, at the same meeting, set a definite time frame to achieve a CD Ratio \nmore than 60 percent  in annual increments.  \n\u2022 Consequent to the completion of this process, the target and time frame self \nset by the SSC should be placed before the DCC for approval.  \n\u2022 The plans for implementation must then be taken up by the SSC and \nmonitor ed assiduously once in two months.  \n\u2022 The SSC should report  the progress on the implementation of the plan to the \nDCC on a quarterly bas is and through them to the Convenor of the SLBC.  \n\u2022 On the basis of the feedback received from the DCC regarding the progress in \nthe implementation of the Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs), a consolidated \nreport should  be prepared by the SSC and tabled at all SLBC meetings for \ndiscussion / information.  \niii)  As regards the districts with a C D Ratio less than 20, these are generally located \nin hilly, desert  or inaccessible terrains and / or those dependent solely on the primary \nsector and/ or characterized by a  breakdown of the law and order machinery. In such \nareas, conventional methods are not likely to work unless the banking system and \nthe State Government come together in a specially meaningful way.  \n \niv) While the framework for implementation for raising the CD Ratio in these districts \nwill be the same as in the case of districts with CD Ratio below 40 percent (i.e setting 26 \n \nup of SSC etc.), the focus of attention and the level of efforts should be of a much \nhigher scale.  \nFor this,  \n\u2022 All such districts should f irst be placed in a special category.  \n\u2022 Thereafter, the responsibility for increasing their CD R atio should be taken by \nbanks and State Governments and the districts should be \"adopted\" by the \nDistrict Administration and the L ead Bank jointly.  \n\u2022 While banks wo uld be responsible for credit disbursement, the State \nGovernment would be required to give an upfront commitment regarding its responsibilities for creation of identified rural infrastructure together with \nsupport in creating an enabling environment for banks to lend and to recover \ntheir dues.  \n\u2022 Progress in the special category districts should be monitored at the district \nlevel and reported to the corporate offices of the concerned banks.  \n\u2022 The CMDs of banks should  give special attention to the CD Ratio in su ch \ndistricts.  \n \n7.   Direct Benefit Transfer  \n \n \nDirect Benefit Transfer  (DBT) was rolled out by  the Government of India in  selected \ndistricts in January 2013. It was expanded to other districts subsequently.  SLBC \nConvenor  Banks were advised to co- ordinate w ith the Government authorities to \nimplement DBT.  Banks were advised to include the status of the roll -out of DBT  as a \nregular agenda item for discussion in SLBC meetings as part of Financial \nInclusion/ Direct  Benefit Transfer ( DBT) implementation. As a prerequisite to the \nimplementation of the DBT, every eligible individual should have a bank account. Further, to make disbursements at the doorstep through the ICT- based BC model, \nbanking outlets either through brick & mortar branches or the branchless mode i s \nneeded in all villages across the country.  Hence, banks have been advised to:   \n\u2022 take steps to complete the opening of bank accounts  and seeding of Aadhaar \nnumber s in all bank accounts .  \n\u2022 closely monitor the progress in seeding of Aadhaar number with the bank  \naccounts of beneficiaries.  27 \n \n\u2022 put in place a system to  provide the beneficiary of the seeding request an \nacknowledgement and also send a  confirmation of the seeding of Aadhaar \nnumber.  \n\u2022 form a DBT Implementation Co- ordination Committee, along with the State  \nGovernment department  concerned, at district level and review the seeding of \nAadhaar number s in bank accounts.  \n\u2022 ensure that district and village wise names and other details of  business \ncorrespondents (BCs) engaged/other arrangements made by the bank are  \ndisplayed on the SLBC website.  \n\u2022 set up a Complaint Grievance Redressal mechanism in each bank and \nnominate a Complaint Redressal Officer in each district, to redress the \ngrievances related to \u2018seeding of Aadhaar number in bank accounts'.  \n \n8. Service Area A pproach (SAA)  \n \ni) The Service Area Approach (SAA) , introduced in April 1989 for planned and \norderly development of rural and semi -urban areas was applicable to all scheduled \ncommercial banks including Regional Rural Banks.  Under SAA, each bank branch \nin a rural or semi -urban area was designated to serve an area of 15 to 25 villages \nand the branch was responsible for meeting the needs of bank credit of its service area.  The primary objective of SAA was to increase productive lending and forge effective linkages between bank credit, production, productivity and increase in income levels.  The SAA scheme was reviewed from time to time and appropriate changes were made in the scheme to make it more effective.  \n \nii) The Service Area Approach scheme was reviewed in December 2004 and it was decided to dispense with the restrictive provisions of the scheme while retaining the positive features of the SAA such as credit planning and monitoring of the credit purveyance. Accordingly, under SAA , the allocation of villages among the rural and \nsemi -urban branches of banks were made not applicable for lending except under \nGovernment Sponsored Schemes. Thus , while  the commercial banks and RRBs are \nfree to lend i n any rural and semi -urban area, the borrowers have the choice of \napproaching any branch for their credit requirements.  28 \n \n8.1 Dispensing with \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019  \n \nIn order to ensure hassle free credit to all borrowers, especially in rural and semi -\nurban areas and keeping in view the technological developments and the different \nways available with banks to avoid multiple financing, banks have been advised to \ndispense with obtaining a \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 from the individual borrowers \n(including SHGs & JLGs) in rural and semi -urban areas for all types of loans \nincluding loans under Government Sponsored Schemes, irrespective of the amount \ninvolved unless the Government Sponsored Scheme itself provides for obtention of a \n\u2018No Due Certificate\u2019.  Further, it is clarified that the policy of dispensing with a \u2018No Due \nCertificate \u2019 for lending by banks is also applicable to urban areas including \nmetropolitan cities.  \n \nii)   Banks are encouraged to use an alternative framework of due diligence as part \nof the credit appraisal exercise other than the \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 which could, \namong others, consist of one or more of the following:  \n\u2022 Credit history check through C redit Information Companies  (CICs)  \n\u2022 Self-declaration or an affidavit from the borrower  \n\u2022 CERSAI registration  \n\u2022 Peer monitoring  \n\u2022 Information sharing among lenders  \n\u2022 Information searc h (writing to other lenders with an auto deadline)  \n \niii) Banks are also advised to submit information/data to all Credit Information \nCompanies (CICs), as required in terms of extant instructions issued by RBI.  \n \n9.   Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022 \ni)  The Government of India,  in the Union Budget 2016- 17, had announced its \nresolve to double the income of farmers by 2022. Several steps have been taken \ntowards attaining this objective including setting up of an inter -ministerial committee \nfor preparation of a blue print for the same. This agenda has also been reiterated by the government in several fora  and has acquired primacy from the point of view of \nrural and agricultural development.  \nii) The strategy to achieve this goal, inter -alia, includes,  29 \n \n\u2022 Focus on ir rigation with large budgets, with the aim of \"per drop, more crop\"  \n\u2022 Provision of quality seeds and nutrients based on soil health of each field  \n\u2022 Investments in warehousing and cold chains to prevent post -harvest crop \nlosses  \n\u2022 Promotion of value addition throu gh food processing  \n\u2022 Creation of a national farm market, removing distortions and development of  \ninfrastructure such as e- platform across 585 stations  \n\u2022 Strengthening of the crop insurance scheme to mitigate risks at affordable \ncost \n\u2022 Promotion of ancillary acti vities like poultry, bee- keeping and fisheries  \niii. Needless to emphasize that acceleration in income generation is significantly \ndependent on better capital formation in agriculture. Towards this, banks should \nrevisit their documentation for crop loans, simplify them where required and ensure \nspeedy sanctioning and disbursal of loans within specified time limits.  \niv. The Lead Bank Scheme, which ensures inter -departmental/governmental \ncoordination in the financial sector, should,  therefore,  be leveraged t o further the \nobjective of doubling farmer\u2019s income by 2022. Lead B anks are accordingly advised \nto ensure the following:  \na. Work closely with NABARD in the preparation of Potential Linked Plans Credit \n(PLPs) & Annual Credit Plans (ACPs) keeping the above strategy in \nconsideration \nb. Include \u2018Doubling of Farmer\u2019s Income by 2022\u2019 as a regular agenda under the \nLead Bank Scheme in various fora  such as SLBC, DCC, DLRC and BLBC  \nc. For the purpose of monitoring and reviewing the progress, Lead B anks may \nuse the benchmarks  as may be provided by NABARD  \nd. Map the overall strategy as given in para 9 (ii) above to the agriculture/agro-\nancillary lending plan of the bank . \n \n \n   30 \n \n10.

In order to enable \nbanks to have instructions at one place, the Master Circular incorporating the existing \nguidelines/instructions on the subject has been updated and enclosed. This Master \nCircular consolidates the circulars  issued by Reserve Bank on the subject up to June \n30, 2018, as indicated in the A nnex .  \n \nYours faithfully  \n \n \n(Gautam Prasad Borah)  \nChief General Manager -in-Charge  \nEncl: As above  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n Master Circular on SHG -Bank Linkage Programme  \nSelf Help Groups ha ve the potential to bring together the formal banking structure and the \nrural poor for mutual benefit . Studies conducted by NABARD in a few states to assess the \nimpact of the linkage project have brought out encouraging and positive features like \nincrease in  loan volume of the SHGs, definite shift in the loaning pattern of the members \nfrom non -income generating activities to production activities, nearly 100 per cent recovery \nperformance, significant reduction in the transaction costs for both the banks and t he \nborrowers etc., besides leading to a gradual increase in the income level of the SHG \nmembers. Another significant feature observed in the linkage project is  that about 85 per \ncent of the groups linked with banks were formed exclusively by women.  \n2. Reco gnizing the importance of SHG Bank linkage, banks have been advised to meet the \nentire credit requirements of SHG members, as envisaged in Paragraph 93 of the Union \nBudget announcement for the year 2008-09, made by the Honorable Finance Minister, \nwherein i t was stated as under: \"Banks will be encouraged to embrace the concept of Total \nFinancial Inclusion. Government will request all scheduled commercial banks to follow the \nexample set by some public sector banks and meet the entire credit requirements of SH G \nmembers, namely, (a) income generation activities, (b) social needs like housing, education, \nmarriage, etc. and (c) debt swapping\".  Linking of SHGs with banks has  thus been \nemphasized in the Monetary Policy Statements of Reserve Bank of India and Union B udget \nannouncements from time to time and various guidelines have been issued to banks in this \nregard.  \n3. Banks should provide adequate incentives to their branches in financing the Self Help \nGroups (SHGs) and establish linkages with them, making the procedures simple and easy. \nThe group dynamics of working of the SHGs need neither be regulated nor formal \nstructures imposed or insisted upon. The approach to financing of SHGs should be totally \nhassle-free and may also include consumption expenditures.  Accord ingly, the following \nguidelines  should be adhered to enable effective linkage of SHGs with the banking sector.  \n4. Opening of Savings Bank A/ C \na) The SHGs, registered or unregistered, which are engaged in promoting savings habits \namong their members are eligible to open savings bank accounts with banks. These \nSHGs need not necessarily have already availed of credit facilities from banks before 3 \n opening savings bank accounts. The instructions of the Department of Banking \nRegulation in the Master Direction on KYC pertaining to SHG members  (Part VI -\nParagraph 43)  shall be adhered to,  while completing Customer Due Diligence (CDD)1 \nprocess.  \nb) Accordingly, the current  instructions under Simplified norms for Self Help Groups \n(SHGs) mention that  CDD of all the members of SHG as mentioned in the above \nDirection shall not be required while opening the savings bank account of the SHG . \nCDD of all the office bearers shall suf fice. No separate CDD of the members or office \nbearers shall be necessary at the time of credit linking of SHGs.  \n5. Lending to SHGs  \na) Bank lending to SHGs should be included in branch credit plan, block credit plan, district \ncredit plan and state credit plan of each bank. U tmost priority should be accorded to the \nsector in preparation of these plans. It should also form an integral part of the bank\u2019s \ncorporate credit plan.  \nb) As per operational guidelines issued by NABARD, SHGs may be sanctioned savings \nlinked loans by banks ( varying from a saving to loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4). However, in \ncase of matured SHGs, loans may be given beyond the limit of four times the savings as \nper the discretion of the bank.  \nc) A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation is a preco ndition for \naugmenting flow of credit to SHGs. Banks should strive to remove all operational \nirritants and make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and disburse credit by \ndelegating adequate sanctioning powers to branch managers. The loan application \nforms, procedures and documents should be made simple. It would help in providing \nprompt and hassle-free credit.  \n6. Interest rates  \nThe banks would have the discretion to decide on the interest rates applicable to loans \ngiven to Self Help Groups/member benefi ciaries.  \n \n                                                            \n1 Customer Due Diligence - means identifying and verifying the customer and the beneficial owne r 4 \n 7. Service/ Processing charges  \nNo loan related and ad hoc service charges/inspection charges should be levied on priority \nsector loans up to \u20b9 25,000. In the case of eligible priority sector loans to SHGs/ JLGs, this \nlimit will be applicable per member and not to the group as a whole.   \n8. Separate  Segment under priority sector  \nIn order to enable the banks to report their SHG lending without difficulty, it is decided that \nthe banks should report their lending to SHGs for on-lending to members of SHGs under \nthe respective categories, viz.  'Advances to SHGs' irrespective of the purposes for which \nthe loans have been disbursed to the SHG members . Priority Sector loans to SHGs are \nconsidered under \u201cWeaker Sections\u201d category.  \n9. Presence of defaulters in SHGs \nDefaults by a few members of SHGs and/or their family members to the financing bank \nshould not ordinarily come in the way of financing SHGs per se by banks, provided the SHG \nis not in default. However, the bank loan may not be utilized by the SHG for financing a \ndefaulter member to the ban k.  \n10. Capacity Building and Training  \na) Banks may initiate suitable steps to internalize the SHGs linkage project and organize \nexclusive short duration programmes for the field level functionaries.

Failure of the banks to impound C ounterfeit Notes \ndetected at their end will be construed as wilful involvement of the bank concerned  \nin circulating Counterfeit Notes and penalty will be imposed.  \nPara 3  -   Impounding of C ounterfeit Notes \nNotes determined as counterfeit shall be stamped as \"COUNTERFEIT NOTE\" and \nimpounded in the prescribed format ( Annex I ).

The receipt, in running serial numbers, should be \nauthenticated by the cashier and tenderer. Notice to this effect should be displayed \nprominently at the offices / branches for information of the public. The receipt is to \nbe issued even in cases where the tenderer is unwilling to countersign it.   \n3 \n \nPara 5 - Detection of Counterfeit Notes - Repor ting to Police and other bodies  \nThe following procedure should be followed while reporting incidence of detection of \nCounterfeit Note to the Police:  \nFor cases of detection of C ounterfeit Notes up to 4 pieces, in a single transaction, a \nconsolidated report in the prescribed format ( Annex III ) should be sent by the Nodal \nBank Officer to the police authorities or the Nodal Police S tation, along with the \nsuspect C ounterfeit Notes, at the end of the month.  \nFor cases of detection of C ounterfeit  Notes of 5 or more pieces , in a single \ntransaction, the C ounterfeit Notes should be forwarded immediately  by the Nodal \nBank Officer to the local police authorities or the Nodal Police Station for \ninvestigation by filing FIR in the prescribed format ( Annex IV ). \nA copy of the monthly consolidated report / FIR shall be sent to the Forged Note \nVigilance  Cell constituted at the Head Office of the bank (only in the case of banks), \nand in the case of the treasury, it should be s ent to the Issue Office of the Reserve \nBank concerned.  \nAcknowledgement of the police authorities concerned has to be obtained for note/s \nforwarded to them both as consolidated monthly statement and for filing of  FIR. If \nthe C ounterfeit Notes are sent to th e police by insured post, acknowledgement of \nreceipt thereof by the police should be invariably obtained and kept on record. A \nproper follow -up of receipt of acknowledgement from the police authorities is \nnecessary. In case, any difficulty is faced by the Offices / Branches due to \nreluctance of the police to receive monthly consolidated  statement / file FIRs, the \nmatter may be sorted out in consultation with the Nodal Officer of the police authority \ndesignated to coordinate matter s relating to investigation of Counterfeit Banknotes \ncases. The list of Nodal Police Station may be obtained from the respective \nRegional Office of the Reserve Bank of India.  \nIn order to facilitate identification of people abetting circulation of C ounterfeit Notes, \nbanks are advised to cover the banking hall/area and counters under CCTV \nsurveillance and recording and preserve the recording.  \nBanks should also monitor the patterns / trends of such detection and suspicious \ntrends / patterns should be brought to the notice of RBI /  Polic e authorities \nimmediately.  \nThe progress made by banks  in detection and reporting of C ounterfeit Notes to \nPolice, RBI, etc. and problems thereof, should be discussed regularly in the \nmeetings of various State Level Committees viz. State Level Bankers\u2019 Commi ttee \n(SLBC), Standing Committee on Currency Management (SCCM), State Level \nSecurity Committee (SLSC) etc.  \n4 \n \n \nThe data on detection of counterfeit Indian notes at bank branches and treasuries \nshould be included in the monthly Returns forwarded to the Reserve Bank Issue \nOffices as indicated in para 10 below.  \nThe definition of 'counterfeiting' in the Indian Penal Code covers currency notes \nissued by a foreign government authority as well. In case of suspected foreign \ncurrency note received for opinion from the police and government agencies, etc., \nthey should be advised to forward the case to the Interpol Wing of the CBI, New \nDelhi after prior consultation with them.  \nThe Government of India has framed Investigation of High Quality Counterfeit Indian \nCurrency Offe nces Rules, 2013 under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), \n1967. The Third Schedule of the Act defines High Quality Counterfeit Indian \nCurrency Note.

The said \ninstructions shall be applicable to all bank branches, irrespective of the volume of \ndaily cash rec eipt.

This Master Circular is placed in our website www.rbi.org.in . \n  \nYours faithfully  \n \n \n \n(Manas Ranjan Mohanty)  \nChief General Manager  \n  Encl. As above  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n2  \nANNEX  \nMaster Circular \u2013  Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated July 02, 2018 \n1.  Facility for exchange of notes and coins at bank branches  \n(a) All branches of banks in all parts of the country are mandated to provide the \nfollowing customer services, more actively and vigorously to the members of public \nso that there is no need for them to approach the RBI Regional Offices for this \npurpose:  \n(i) Issuing fresh / good quality notes and coins of all denominations on demand,  \n(ii) Exchanging soiled / mutilated / defective notes, * \n* Small Finance Banks and Payment Banks may exchange mutilated and defective \nnotes at their option.  \nand \n(iii) Accepting coins and notes either for  transactions or exchange.   \nIt will be preferable to accept coins, particularly, in the denominations of \u20b9 1 and 2, \nby weighment. However, accepting coins packed in polythene sachets of 100 each \nwould perhaps be more convenient for the cashiers as well as the customers. Such \npolythene sachets may be kept at the counters and made available to the \ncustomers.   \n (b) All branches should provide the above facilities to members of public without any \ndiscrimination on all work ing days. The scheme of providing exchange facility by a \nfew select currency chest branches on one of the Sundays in a month will remain \nunchanged. The names and addresses of such bank branches should be available \nwith the respective banks.  \n(c) The availability of the above- mentioned facilities at the bank branches should be \ngiven wide publicity for information of the public at large.  \n(d) None of the bank branches should refuse to accept small denomination notes \nand / or coins tendered at their counters.  \n2.  Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 -  Delegation of powers \n(a) In terms of Section 28 read with Section 58 (2) of Reserve Bank of India Act, \n1934, no person is entitled as a right to recover from the Government of India or RBI \nthe value of any lost, stolen, mutilated or imperfect currency note of the GOI or \nbanknote. However, with a view to mitigating the hardship to the public in genuine \ncases, it has been provided that the RBI may, with the previous sanction of the \nCentral Government, prescr ibe the circumstances in, and the conditions and  \n \n3 limitations subject to which, the value of such currency notes or banknotes may be \nrefunded as a matter of grace.  \n(b) With a view to extending the facility for the benefit and convenience of public, all branches of banks have been delegated powers under Rule 2(j) of Reserve Bank of \nIndia (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 for exchange of mutilated / defective notes free of \ncost.  \n3. Liberalized definition of a Soiled Note  \nIn order to facilitate quicker exchange facili ties, the definition of soiled note has been \nexpanded. A \u2018soiled note\u2019 means a note which has become dirty due to normal wear  \nand tear and also includes a two piece note pasted together wherein both the pieces \npresented belong to the same note and form the entire note with no essential feature missing.  These notes should be accepted over bank counters in payment of \nGovernment dues and for credit to accounts of the public maintained with banks. However, in no case, these notes should be issued to the publ ic as re -issuable notes \nand shall be deposited in currency chests for onward transmission to RBI offices as \nsoiled note remittances for further processing.  \n4. Mutilated  Notes \u2013 Presentation and Passing \nA mutilated note is a note of which a portion is missi ng or which is composed of \nmore than two pieces.  Mutilated notes  may be presented at any of the bank \nbranches . The notes so presented shall be accepted, exchanged and adjudicated in \naccordance with Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules , 2009\n. \n5. Extremely brittle, burnt, charred, stuck up Notes  \nNotes which have turned extremely brittle or are badly burnt, charred or inseparably \nstuck up together and, therefore, cannot withstand normal handling, shall not be accepted by the bank branches for exchange. Instead, the holders may be advised to tender these notes to the Issue Office concerned where they will be adjudicated \nunder a Special Procedure.  \n6. Procedure for exchange of soiled/ mutilated/ imperfect notes  \n6.1 Exchange of soiled notes \n \n \n6.1.1 Notes presented in small number : Where the number of notes presented by a \nperson is up to 20 pieces with a maximum value of \u20b9  5000 per day, banks should \nexchange them over the counter, free of charge.  \n \n \n6.1.2 Notes presented in bulk : Where the number of notes presented by a person \nexcee ds 20 pieces or \u20b9  5000 in value per day, banks may accept them, against \nreceipt, for value to be credited later. Banks may levy service charges as permitted in Master Circular on Customer Ser vice in Banks \n(DBR.No.Leg.BC.21/09.07.006/ 2015- 16 dated July 1, 2015\n). In case tendered value \nis above \u20b9 50000, banks are expected to take the usual precautions.  \n \n  \n \n4 6.2 Exchange of mutilated and imperfect notes \n \n6.2.1 While designated branches may continue to follow the procedure as laid down \nin Part III of NRR, 2009 ( www.rbi.org.in  \u2192Publications\u2192Occassional ) for exchanging \nmutilated and imperfect notes and issue receipt for the notes presented for adjudication, non- chest branches are required to follow the following procedure for \nnotes presented in small numbers and in bulk.  \n \n6.2.2 Notes presented in small number :  Where the number of notes presented by a \nperson is up to 5 pieces, non- chest branches should normally adjudicate the notes \nas per the procedure laid down in Part III of NRR, 2009 and pay the exchange value over the counter. If the non- chest branches are not able to adjudicate the mutilated \nnotes, the notes may be received against a receipt and sent to the linked currency chest branch for adjudication. The probable date of payment should be informed to the tenderers on the receipt itself and the sam e should not exceed 30 days. Bank \naccount details should be obtained from the tenderers for crediting the exchange value by electronic means.  \n \n6.2.3 Notes presented in bulk: Where the number of notes presented by a person is \nmore than 5 pieces not exceedi ng \u20b9 5000 in value, the tenderer should be advised to \nsend such notes to nearby currency chest branch by insured post giving his / her bank account details (a/c no, branch name, IFSC, etc.) or get them exchanged thereat in person. All other persons tenderi ng mutilated notes whose value exceeds \n\u20b9 5000 should be advised to approach nearby currency chest branch. Currency \nchest branches receiving mutilated notes through insured post should credit the exchange value to the account of sender by electronic means w ithin 30 days of \nreceipt of notes.  \n \n6.3 Tenderers aggrieved with the service provided by the banks in this regard may \napproach Banking Ombudsman concerned, following the procedure as laid under Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006 with the bank /postal receipts  as proof for \nnecessary action.  \n7. Notes bearing \"PAY\"  / \"PAID\"  / \"REJECT\" stamps \n(a) Every Officer- in-charge of the branch i.e. the Branch Manager and every Officer -\nin-charge of the Accounts or Cash Wing of the Branch shall act as 'Prescribed \nOfficer' in each branch to adjudicate the notes received at the branch for exchange in accordance with Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009. After \nadjudicating mutilated notes, the Prescribed Officer is required to record his order by subscribing his initials to the dated 'PAY'/ 'PAID'/ 'REJECT' stamp. The 'PAY' /'PAID' & 'REJECT' stamps should also carry the name of the bank and branch concerned \nand held under the custody of the 'Prescribed Officer' to avoid misuse.  \n(b) Mutilated / defective notes bearing 'PAY'/'PAID' (or 'REJECT') stamp of any RBI \nIssue Office or any bank branch, if presented for payment again at any of the bank \nbranches should be rejected under Rule 6(2) of Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 and the tenderer should be advised that the value of such note/s cannot be paid since the same has already been paid as is evident from the PAY/PAID \nstamps affixed on it/them. All bank branches have instructions not to issue notes bearing PAY/PAID stamps to the public even through oversight. The branches  \n \n5 should caution their customers not to accept such notes from any bank or anybody \nelse.  \n8. Notes bearing slogans / political  messages, etc.  \nAny note with slogans and message of a political  nature written across it ceases to \nbe a legal tender and the claim on such a note will be rejected under Rule 6(3) (iii) of \nReserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009. Similarly, notes which are disfigured may also be rejected under Rule 6(3) (ii) of \nReserve Bank of India (Note \nRefund) Rules, 2009 . \n9. Deliberately cut notes \nThe notes, which are found to be deliberately cut, torn, altered or tampered with, if \npresented for payment of exchange value should be rejected under Rule 6(3)(ii) of the Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009. Although it is not possible to precisely define deliberately cut notes, a close look at such notes will clearly reveal any deliberate fraudulent intention, as the manner in which such notes are mutilated will follow a broad uniformity in the shape/location of missing portions of t he notes, \nespecially when the notes are tendered in large numbers. The details of the case such as the name of the tenderer, the number of notes tendered and their denominations should be reported thereafter to the Deputy/General Manager, Issue Department,  under whose jurisdiction the branch falls. The matter should also be \nreported to local police in case a large number of such notes are tendered.  \n10. Training \nOur Issue Offices conduct training programmes for 'Prescribed Officers' of bank \nbranches on a pri ority basis. As the training programmes are intended to provide \nknowledge and instill confidence in the Prescribed Officers in the process of adjudication of defective notes, it is imperative that the Prescribed Officers of the \nbranches are deputed for suc h programmes.   \n11. Display of Notice Board  \nAll bank branches are required to display at their branch premises, at a prominent \nplace, a board indicating the availability of note and coin exchange facility with the \nlegend, \"SOILED/MUTILATED NOTES  AND COINS ARE ACCEPTED AND \nEXCHANGED HERE\" for information of general public. Banks should ensure that all their branches provide facility for exchange of notes and coins not only to their customers but also others. However, they should ensure that the note exchange  \nfacility is not cornered by money changers / dealers in defective notes.  \n12. Disposal of notes adjudicated at bank branches  \nRegarding audit of the notes adjudicated by bank branches, the full value paid notes have to be remitted by all branches to the chest branches with which they have been linked and therefrom to the Issue Offices concerned together with the next soiled note remittance in the manner already laid down. The half value paid notes and \nrejected notes, which are held by the chest branches in their cash balance, may \neither be remitted separately packed together  with the full value paid notes or sent  \n \n6 by registered and insured post as and when required. The full value paid notes will \nbe treated as chest remittance by the Issue Office while the half value paid notes \nand rejected notes will be treated as notes tendered for adjudication and processed accordingly. All chest  branches are required to submit to our Issue Offices a monthly \nstatement showing the number of notes adjudicated during the month.  \n13. Uncurrent Coins \nThe coins of 25 paise  and below, issued from time to time, ceased to be legal tender \nfor payments as well as account with effect from June 30, 2011 in terms of Gazette \nNotification No. 2529 dated December 20, 2010 issued by the Government of India.  \n14. Monitoring and Control  \n(a) The Regional Managers / Zonal Managers of the banks may pay surprise visits to \nthe branches and report the position of compliance in this regard to the Head Office which will review such reports and take prompt remedial action, wherever necessary.  \n(b) Any non- compliance in this regard shall be viewed as violation of instructions \nissued by the Reserve Bank of India.  \n \n   \n \n7 Master Circular \u2013  Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated July 02, 2018 \n           List of circulars / notifications consolidated by the Master Circular  \nSr. \nNo Circular / Notification No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the \nCentr al and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the \nagency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual \nagreement. RBI pays agency commission to the a gency banks for the gover nment \nbusiness handled by them. T his Master Circular consolidates the instructions \ncontained in the circulars listed in Annex  1. \nGovernment transactions eligible for a gency commission \n2. Transactions relating to the following government business undertaken by \nagency banks are eligible for agency commission:  \n(a) Revenue receipts and payments on behalf of the Central/State Government  \n(b) Pension payments in respect of Central / State Governments  \n(c) Public Provident Fund (PPF) Scheme, 1968 \n(d) Special Deposit Scheme (SDS) 1975  \n(e) National Saving Time Deposit Scheme, 1981,  \n(f) National Saving R ecurring Deposit Scheme, 1981  \n(g) National Saving (Monthly Income Account) Scheme, 1987,  \n(h) National Saving Certificates (VIII Issue) Scheme, 1989 \n(i) Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) , 2004 \n(j) Kisan Vikas Pa tra, 2014 and  \n(k) Sukanya Samriddhi Account   \n(l) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank as eligible for \nagency commission (viz. Relief Bonds/ Savings Bonds etc. transactions)  \n \nThe Agency banks also undertake the work related to Small Savings Schemes t he \ncommission for which is borne by Government of India.  However, the settlement of \nsuch commission continues to be processed by RBI.  Agency commission claims on \nSDS related transactions (where mirror accounts are maintained in RBI) are settled \nat Central Accounts Section (CAS), Nagpur and not in respective Regional Offices of \nRBI. \n3. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from \nfinancial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commission as these \ntransactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business.  \nReserve Bank pays the agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for \nacting as agents for management of public debt. Transactions arising out of Letter s \nof Credit / Bank Guarantee o pened by banks on behalf of Ministries/Departments etc. \ndo not qualify for agency commi ssion  as RBI only reimburses the paid amount to the \nbanks based on the mandate received from the government s. \n4. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical m ode or e- mode \n(challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the \nagency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive \nremuneration from the State Government for doing this work.  3 \n 5. If the agency bank is engaged by the State Government as Franking Vendor \nand it collects stamp duty from the public for franking the documents, it will not be \neligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to \nit as Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects  the stamp duty paid \nby the Franking Vendor for credit to the Treasury through challan in physical or e-\nmode for purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since \nit is a regular payment of Stamp Duty as s tated above.  \n  \n6. All agency banks while claiming agency  commission should certify that no \nclaim of agency commission is made on ineligible transactions . \nGovernment transactions not eligible for agency commission \n7. Agency banks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or \nthrough authorised branches of State Bank of India or offices of Reserve Bank of \nIndia wherever they do not have their own authorised direct tax collection branch \nshould indicate the same separately in the scroll. Such transac tions will not be \neligible for payment of agency commission. Banks should furnish a certificate to the \neffect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) paid by them have been \nexcluded while claiming agency commission.  \n8. The following activities do not come under the purview of agency bank \nbusiness and are therefore not eligible for payment of agency commission.  \n(a) Furnishing of bank guarantees/security deposits, etc . through agency  banks \nby government contractors/suppliers, which constitute banki ng transactions \nundertaken by banks for their customers.  \n(b) The banking business of autonomous/  statutory bodies / Municipalities / \ncompanies/  Corporations/Local Bodies.    \n(c) Payments of a capital nature such as capital contributions/  subsidies/  grants \nmade by governments to cover losses incurred by autonomous/statutory bodies / \nMunicipalities/ Corporations/Local Bodies.  \n(d) Prefunded schemes which may be implemented by a Central Government \nMinistry/Department (in consultation with CGA) and a State Government \nDepartment through any bank .  \n(e) Transactions related to Gold Monetisation Scheme 2015  \nReporting of transactions by agency banks to RBI  \n9. State government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) of \nprevious month reported after 8th of the s ucceeding month and those pertaining to \nearlier months should be reported to RBI through a separate statement for \naccounting, after being confirmed by the competent authorities of concerned state \ngovernment.  4 \n 10. For Central Government transactions (electronic  as well as in physical mode) \nor any adjustments thereof , if reported after a gap of 90 days from the date of \ntransaction, agency banks have to obtain prior approval from concerned \nministry/department and submit the same to RBI separately at the time of reporting \nsuch transactions for settlement.   \nRates for agency commission \n11. As per a gency bank agreement, RBI pays agency commiss ion at rates \ndetermined by it. The rates applicable with effect from July 1, 2012 are as under:  \nSr. No. Type of Transaction  Unit Revised Rate \na.  (i) Receipts - Physical mode  Per transaction   \u20b9 50/- \n     (ii) Receipts - e-mode  Per transaction   \u20b9 12/- \nb. Pension Payments  Per transaction   \u20b9 65/- \nc. Payments other than Pension  Per   \u20b9 100 turnover  5.5 paise  \n \n12. In this context, the \u2018Receipts -e-mode transactions\u2019 indicated against Sr. No. \na.(ii) in  the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from \nthe remitter\u2019s bank account through internet banking as well as such transactions  \nwhich do not involve physical  rec eipt of cash /instruments  at all . For example,  \nchallan generated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with cash / \ninstrument should be treated as transaction under physical mode.   \n \n13. With reference to the implementation of Goods and Service Tax  (GST) \nregime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), \nprocessed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number \n(CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if \nmultiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This \nmeans that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would \nconstitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records clubbed under a single challan \ni.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming \nagency commission effective J uly 1, 2017.  \n \n14. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that \na single challan ( electronic or physical) should be treated as single tr ansaction only \nand not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains multiple major head/sub \nmajor head/minor head of accounts that will get credited.  Therefore, records clubbed \nunder a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a s ingle \ntransaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission.   \n15. Agency banks would be eligible to claim agency commission for pension \ntransactions at the rate of \u20b9 65/- per transaction only when the entire work relating to \ndisbursement of pension including pension calculation is attended to by them .  If the \nwork relating to pension calculations, etc., is attended to by the concerned \nGovernment Department  / Treasury and the bank s are required only to credit the 5 \n amount of pension to the pensioners' account s maintained with them by a single \ndebit to Government Account, such transaction is to be categori sed under \u2018other than \npension payment\u2019 and would be eligible for payment of agency commission @ 5.5 \npaise per \u20b9  100/- turnover w.e.f. July 1, 2012.  \n16. The number of transactions eligible for payment of agency commission should \nnot exceed 14 per pensioner per year.  This includes one monthly credit for payment \nof net pension and a maximum of two per year for payment of arrears on account of \nincrease in dearness relief, if applicable. Cases involving payment of arrears on \naccount of late start/restart of pension qualifies as a single transaction for claiming of \nagency commission. In other words, any payment of arrears on account of late \nstart/restart of pension should be treated as a single credit transaction and not as \nseparate monthly credits.  \n17. Agency commission is payable to an agency bank at the full rate provided the \ntransactions are handled by the bank at all stages .  Where, however, the work is \nshared between two banks, the agency commission is shared between the banks in \nthe proportion of 75:25.  Thus, broadly, the agency commission is payable to the \nagency  banks as detailed below:  \n(a) At the full rate, in cases where the transactions are handled by the bank at all \nstages, i.e. , up to the stage of dispatch of scrolls and challans / cheques to the \nPay and Accounts Offices,  and treasuries/sub- treasuries .  \n(b) At 75% of the applicable  rate, where the dealing branch is required to account \nfor the transaction by passing on the scrolls and documents to the \nlocal/nearest branch of Reserve Bank of India or any agency bank conducting \ngovernment business.  \n(c) At 25% of the applicable rate, in the case of agency branch which received the \nscrolls and documents from dealing branches of other banks and is \nresponsible for the account ing of these transactions and dispatching of the \nscrolls and documents to the Pay and Accounts Offices, Treasuries, etc.  \n18. All agency banks should settle their agency  transactions for both funds and \nagency commission directly with the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank \ninstead of routing them through any other agency bank that acts as aggregator in \ncertain cases.  So also for payments made by all agency banks on behalf of state \ngovernment/s get directly settled with the concerned Regional Office of RBI. Agency \nTransaction details/scrolls may be sent directly by individual agency bank to the \nconcerned State Government/Treasury.  This new arrangement for settlement of state \ngovernment funds on day to day basis (receipts and payments) directly with Reserve \nBank is with effect from January 1, 2018.  \n   6 \n Claiming  agency commission  \n19. Agency banks are required to submit their claims for agency commission in \nthe prescribed format to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions \nand the respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for  State government \ntransactions.  However, agency commission claims with respect to GST receipt \ntransactions will be settled at Mu mbai Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India only \nand accordingly all agency banks, authorized to collect GST, are advised to submit \ntheir agency commission claims pertaining to GST receipt transactions at Mumbai \nRegional Office only. The revised formats for claiming agency commission for all \nagency banks and separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the \nbranch officials and Chartered Accountants are given in Annex 2 . These certificates \nwould be in addition t o the usual Certificate from ED / CGM (in charge of government \nbusiness) to the effect that there are no pension arrears to be credited / delays in \ncrediting regular pension / arrears thereof . \n20. Where the External Auditor is also the Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor, \nclaims can be certified by such Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor.  The auditor\u2019s \ncertificate should, inter -alia, state that:  \n(a) \u2018receipt\u2019 and \u2018pension payment transactions\u2019 as also the agency \ncommission claims for \u2018payments other than pension payments\u2019 indicated \nin the agency commission claim application submitted to the RBI are tallied \nwith the records maintained at the concerned branch/es of the  agency \nbank; and \n(b) the agency commission claims made in respect of volume (number) based \ntransactions viz. \u2018receipt\u2019 and \u2018pension payment transactions\u2019 have been \nclaimed only once and the same stands excluded while arriving at value \nbased transactions in respect of \u2018payments other than pension payments\u2019.  \nIn addition to this, agency banks are requi red to ensure that the agency bank\u2019s \ninternal inspectors / a uditors verify the agency commission claims submitted by their \nbranches and confirm their accuracy during the course of their i nspection / a udit.  \n21. Agency banks are required to ensure that agency c ommission claims \nsubmitted to the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India / Central Accounts \nSection, Nagpur as applicable in the prescribed format are accurate.  Agency banks \nmay also alert their branches concerned to ensure that agency commission claim s \nsubmitted to our Regional Offices are accurate.  Such erroneous claims, if certified \nby the Internal / Concurrent Auditors, will defeat the very purpose of making such \nrequirement an essential condition for making quarterly claims.  \n22. Agency banks are advis ed to furnish their claim on agency commission to \nReserve Bank  within 90 days from the end of the quarter in which the transactions \nhave been conducted.  If the banks fail to lodge the claims within the stipulated \nperiod mentioned above they may forward t he same to RBI only after giving reasons \nfor delay.   7 \n Other issues \n23. RBI has decided to reimburse agency banks the amount of Service Tax paid \nby them on agency commission with effect from July 1, 2012 and the amount of GST \npaid by them on agency commission with effect from July 1, 2017.  \n24. The reimbursement of MDR charges on debit card use (up to Rs.one lakh) can \nbe claimed from RBI separately as per extant guidelines. Deduction of MDR charges \nfrom the receipts of government is not permissible.  The full amount paid to the \nGovernment by the customers / through debit / credit cards should be remitted to the \nconcerned Government Ministry / Department.  The MDR charges on debit card \ntransactions above Rs.one lakh are not being absorbed by Government of India and \nhenc e will not be reimbursed by RBI.  MDR charges  on any credit card transaction \nare not eligible for reimbursement by RBI.  \n \nThe reimbursement of MDR charges on debit cards / BHIM \u2013  UPI transactions of \nvalue less than or eq ual to \u20b9 2000/ - will be borne by Government of India and the \nclaims for reimbursement will be settled by Central Accounts Section, RBI, Nagpur.  \n \nDeduction of TDS on Agency Commission \n25. Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has clarified that \u2018tax would not be \nrequired to be deducted by RBI on the agency  commission paid or credited by it to \nagency banks for transacting general banking business of the Central Government \nand State Government s\u2019. However, agency commission would  be taxable in the \naccounts of banks concerned as it is part of the bank\u2019s income.  \n \nPenal interest for wrong claims \n \n26.  Agency banks will be liable to pay penal interest at Bank Rate as notified by \nReserve Bank of India plus 2% for any wrong claims of agency commission settled.  \n \n \n \n \n 8 \n Annex 1 \nList of circulars consolidated in the Master Circular  \n \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

This Master \nCircular consolidates important instructions on the subject issued by the Reserve Bank \ntill June 30, 2018 . It does not replace or supersede such existing government \ninstructions.

Contents of v arious circulars  issued in \nthis connection by the Reserve Bank of India are summarised hereunder . \nGeneral Instructions \nGovernment orders on DR, etc. on websites \n2. In order to obviate the time lag between issue of DR orders and payment of DR to the \nbeneficiary and to render expeditious service to senior citizens, the following action is \nrequired to be taken:  \n(a) As soon as the sanction of Dearness Relief at revised rates is received from \nMinistry of Finance, orders for payment of Dearness Relief to pensioners at \nrevised rates are issued and the copies of such orders are immediately sent to \nHeads of all Agency B anks by e- mail as well as by FAX with instructions to take \nnecessary action for expeditious payment of Dearness Relief.  \n(b) The orders are put on website of Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievance and \nPensions ( http://www.persmin.nic.in ) \n(c) Copies of orders are also sent by post to Heads of all Agency Banks and \npublished in leading newspapers by Indian Banks' Association.  3 \n (d) Pension paying agency banks should act on the copies of the orders supplied by \nGovernment  to the Head Offices and/or Regional Offices of authorised banks in \nthe State headquarters or hosted on the website of the State Government.  \n(e) The Controlling Offices/ Head Offices of agency banks should closely monitor \nand supervise timely and correct disbursement of Government pension to eligible \npensioners.  \n(f) All agency banks are advised to scrupulously follow all the guidelines \n/instructions contained in various notifications of Government (Central as well as \nStates) and take necessary action immediately wi thout waiting for any further \ninstructions from RBI.  \nNomination \n3.

In the case of Central Civil and Railway pensioners, the pension paying banks should \nendorse the names of nominees as per nomination forms \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 on the front page of \nthe pass book and the branches may be advised to ensure that the procedure laid down \nin Schemes for disbursement of pension to pensioners by public sector banks are \nfollowed scrupulously  by all agency banks.  \nAll India Service officers retiring from Government of India \n5. The ac counting procedure to be followed for payment of pension to All India Service \nOfficers retiring from Government of India while on Central Deputation is given below:  \n(a) PPO number for All India Service Pensioners would incorporate, besides the 12 \ndigit numeric  component used for Central Civil pensioner, a prefix indicating the \nservice and the state cadre to which the pensioner belongs. A sample PPO \nnumber for an IAS Officer of Punjab cadre would be \u2013  IAS/Pb/438840400191.  4 \n (b) All India Service Pensioners will have t he option to draw pension only through \nthe authorised banks.  \n(c) The Special Seal Authority (SSA) issued by the CPAO would be in blue colour to \ndistinguish it from orders issued for Central Civil pensioners. In addition, the \nauthority will indicate the State G overnment to which the payment is debitable.  \n(d) One copy of the SSA will be sent to the concerned Accountant General for \ninformation and record.  \n(e) The concerned paying branches of the bank, after following the necessary \nprocedure for identifying the pensioner, would release the payment and add the \nname of All India Service Pensioner to the scrolls prepared for State Government \nPensioners to be routed for reimbursement to the reimbursing branches of the \nReserve Bank/ State Bank as the case may be. Such scrolls ar e NOT  being \nhandled under Single Window System of pension reimbursement for Central \nGovernment Civil Pensioners and should not therefore be sent to CPAO . \n(f) The reimbursing branches would follow the procedure for the State Government \nPensioners and send advic e to Reserve Bank, CAS, Nagpur and the \ncorresponding scrolls to the concerned Accountant General.  \n(g) The RBI, CAS, Nagpur would debit the concerned State Government Account as \nper the procedure.  \nCredit of pension to joint account  \n6. Various Central Government  Ministries and State Governments have modified the \nscheme for payment of pension permitting credit of pension also to a joint account \noperated by pensioner with his/her spouse in whose favour an authorisation for family \npension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO). The joint account of the pensioner \nwith the spouse could be operated either on 'Former or Survivor' or 'Either or Survivor' \nbasis subject to the following terms and conditions:  \n(a) Once pension has been credited to a pensioner's bank account, the liability of   \nthe government/bank ceases. No further liability arises, even if the spouse \nwrongly draws the amount.  5 \n (b) As pension is payable only during the life of a pensioner, his/her death shall be \nintimated to the bank at the earliest and in any case within one month of the \ndemise, so that the bank does not continue crediting monthly pension to the joint \naccount with the spouse, after the death of the pensioner. If, however, any \namount has been wrongly credited to the joint account, it shall be recoverable \nfrom the joint account and/or any other account held by the pensioner/spouse \neither individually or jointly. The legal heirs, successors, executors, etc., shall \nalso be liable to refund any amount, which has been wrongly credited to the joint \naccount.  \n \n(c) Payment of Arrears of Pension (Nomination) Rules 1983 would continue to be \napplicable to a Joint Account with the pensioner's spouse. This implies that if \nthere is an 'accepted nomination' in accordance with rules 5 and 6 of these \nRules, arrears mentioned in the rules shall be payable to the nominee.  \n7. Existing pensioners desiring to get their pension credited to a joint account as \nindicated above are required to submit an application to the bank branch, from where \nthey are presently drawing pension in the prescribed form. This would also be signed by \nthe pensioner's spouse in token of having accepted the terms and conditions laid down \nby the Ministry/Government concerned. The facility is appl icable to existing / future \npensioners.  \n8. The scheme of some states/ministries add that opening of joint account with any \nother person for credit of pension, except the spouse in whose favour family pension is \nauthorised in the PPO, shall not be permissible. Family pensioners are also not covered \nunder the revised scheme. For specific details, the scheme of each individual \nMinistry/State Government may be examined.  \nRecording of PPO Number in the passbook of Pensioners / Family Pensioners  \n9. Agency banks were advised to record the PPO number in all the pension passbooks \nof the pensioners/family pensioners issued to them. This is to alleviate the difficulties 6 \n reported by pensioners/family pensioners to get duplicate Pension Payment Orders \n(PPO) in case of mis sing of original PPO, transfer of pension account from one \nbank/branch to another bank/branch, commencement of family pension to spouse or \ndependent children after the death of pensioner, etc. in the absence of ready availability \nof PPO numbers. Necessary instructions in this regard have already been issued to all \nauthorised banks by the Central Pension Accounting Office vide their  Office \nMemorandum CPAO/Tech/Clarifications/P&PW/2014- 15/426- 497 dated September 17, \n2014  and Office of Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (Pension) vide their \nCircular No.185 dated  November 28, 2016 . All agency banks are advised to record the \nPPO numbers on the passbook of pensioners/family pensioners.  \nUpdation of PPO for changes in amount of pension \n10. Some of the Pension Paying Bank branches do not update the amount of basic \npens ion/family pension whenever there is change in basic rates in both halves of the \nPension Payment Order (PPO) concerned. In this connection, paragraphs 12.17 and \n19.1 of the \"Scheme for Payment of Pensions to Central Government Civil Pensioners \nby Public Sector Banks\u201d are reproduced below: \u201cWhenever there is change in the basic \nrates of pension and/or dearness relief on pension, the paying branch shall call back the \npensioner's half of the PPO and record thereon the changes, indicating, inter -alia, the \ndate( s) from which the changes are effective. After this is done, those halves will be \nreturned to the pensioners.\u201d (Para 12.17).  \n\u201cWhenever any additional relief on pensions is sanctioned by Government, an intimation \nto this effect will be sent by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions \n(Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare) to the authorised representative (by \nname) of each nominated public sector bank at the address given by the latter. \nThereafter, it shall be the responsibility of t he banks to collect through their \nrepresentatives operating at Delhi or otherwise, the required number of copies (to be \nintimated in advance) of the sanction orders, along with the ready -reckoner relating \nthereto, from the Ministry of Personnel, Public Gri evances and Pensions (Department of \nPension and Pensioners' Welfare) and send them immediately to their respective Head 7 \n Offices for direct transmission to the paying branches within ten days for \nimplementation. Each paying branch will promptly determine the revised rates of relief \non pensions payable to the Central Government Civil Pensioners under its payment. \nThe calculations of these rates applicable to individual pensioners would be made as in \nAnnexure XXII (Page 50) and they will be noted in disburser's portion of the PPOs along \nwith the date from which relief would take effect, under attestation by the Branch \nManager or In- Charge before commencing payment of relief at the revised rates and/or \npayment of arrears, if any, due to the pensioners on this ac count\u2026\u201d (Para 19.1).  \nAgency banks may draw the attention of their pension paying branches to the above \nprovisions and advise them to strictly follow the instructions.  \nIssue of Pension Slip \n11. It has been decided by Central Pension Accounting Office (CPAO) /Ministry of \nDefence/Railway and various State Governments to issue pension slips to their \npensioners including family pensioners. Accordingly, pension slips as per the prescribed \nformat prescribed in our , are to be issued to these pensioners/family pensioners at the \ncommencement of pension and thereafter, whenever there is a change in quantum of \npension. Both halves of the Pension Payment Order (PPO) would also need to be \nupdated. All agency banks were advised to issue suitable instructions to their pension \npaying branches.  (DGBA.GAD.H- 10975/45.05.031/2006 -07 dated January 09, 2007)  \nStaggering of pension payments \n12. Payment of pension only on the last day of the month causes much hardship to \npensioners as they have to wait in queue for a long time to collect their pension. As per \ninstructions issued in 1995, agency banks were advised to spread disbursal of pension \nover the last four working days of the month, except for the month of March, which will \ncontinue to be credited on or after the first worki ng day of April.  \n 8 \n Recovery of excess/wrong payment made to a pensioner  \n13. Details of the uniform procedure evolved for recovery of excess/wrong payments \nmade to pensioners drawing pensions under the Scheme for payment of pension to \nCentral /Civil/Defence/Railways pensioners through agency banks, are given below:  \n(a) As soon as the excess/wrong payment made to a pensioner comes to the notice \nof the paying branch, the branch should adjust the same against the amount \nstanding to the credit to the pensioner\u2019s account to the extent possible including \nlumpsum arrears payment.  \n \n(b) If the entire amount of overpayment cannot be adjusted from the account, the \npensioner may be asked to pay forthwith the balance amount of overpayment.  \n \n(c) In case the pensioner ex presses his inability to pay the amount, the same may \nbe adjusted from the future pension payments to be made to the pensioners. For \nrecovering the overpayment made to pensioner from his future pension payment \nin instalments 1/3rd of net (pension + relief)  payable each month may be \nrecovered unless the pensioner concerned gives consent in writing to pay a \nhigher instalment amount.  \n \n(d) If the overpayment cannot be recovered from the pensioner due to his death or \ndiscontinuance of pension then action has to be t aken as per the letter of \nundertaking given by the pensioner under the scheme.  \n \n(e) The pensioner may also be advised about the details of over payment/wrong \npayment and mode of its recovery.  \nRefund of excess pension payment to Government  \n14. Whenever any excess / overpayment is detected the entire amount thereof should \nbe credited to the Government account in lump sum immediately when the \nexcess/overpayment is due to an error on the part of the agency bank. If the 9 \n excess/wrong payment to the pensioner is due to errors committed by the government, \nbanks  may take up the matter with the full particulars of the cases with respective \nGovernment Department for a quick resolution of the matter. However, this must be a \ntime bound exercise and the gov ernment authority\u2019s acknowledgement to this effect \nmust be kept on the bank\u2019s record. The banks may take up such cases with government \ndepartments without reference to the Reserve Bank of India.  \nWithdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners  \n15. In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners \nin withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorise \nsuch pensioners as under:  \n(a) Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the \nbank . \n \n(b) Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also \nnot even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form \ndue to certain physical defect / incapacity.  \n16. With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their \naccounts, banks may follow the procedure as under:  \n(a) Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should \nbe identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom \nshould be a responsible bank official.  \n \n(b) Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also \nwould not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained \non the cheque/withdrawal form, which should be identified by two independent \nwitnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official.  10 \n Accordingly, the agency banks are requested to instruct their branches to display the \ninstructions issued in this regard on their notice board so that si ck and disabled \npensioners could make full use of these facilities. Banks are also advised to sensitise \nstaff members in the matter and to refer to the FAQs on pension disbursement hosted \non our website www.r bi.org.in in case of any doubt.  \nReimbursement of pension payments  \n17. Link branches of agency banks may submit reimbursement claims to Reserve Bank \nof India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur  / Government Banking Division at Regional \nOffice  for Central/State Government pension payments.  \nContinuation of either or survivor pension account after death of pensioner  \n18. All agency banks disbursing Central Government pension have been advised that in \ncase the spouse (Family pensioner) opts for exi sting joint account for credit of family \npension, banks should not insist on opening a new account when the spouse is the \nsurvivor and having a joint account with the pensioner and in whose favour an \nauthorisation for payment of family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO).  \nDigital Life Certificate  \n19. As per the present pension scheme, pensioners are required to furnish a life \ncertificate to the pension disbursing bank every year in November. In view of the \ndifficulties faced by pensioners in s ubmission of these certificates, and in order to \nalleviate these difficulties, the Government of India has since launched \u201cJeevan \nPramaan\u201d, a digital life certificate based on Aadhaar Biometric Authentication on \nNovember 10, 2014. In order to facilitate Jeevan Pramaan, a web portal \n(jeevanpramaan.gov.in ) was launched on November 10, 2014. All agency banks \ndisbursing government pension may take necessary action to implement and benefit \nfrom the scheme and issue necessary instructions to all their branches concerned and \ndealing staff. Banks may, in addition, work towards creating awareness about this \nfacility among their pensioner customers through their branches, websites and other 11 \n means. Banks may also suitably amend the FAQs on pension payments posted on their \nwebsites, and provide a link to the website of Jeevan Pramaan.  \n20. There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of \npension paying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. \nIn order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to \nmandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also advised  to consider \nentering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated \nacknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as \nreal time  updation of records.  \nSingle Window System for reimbursement of Pension Payments \n21. Single  Window System was introduced to facilitate prompt settlement of \nreimbursement claims and reconciliation. The underlying objective is to make each \npension paying bank responsible in its own right to effect settlement without the intervention of RBI Offices  or SBI/Associates (at District Headquarters) in the process \neliminating cause of delay in reimbursement claims.  \n22. Under  this system, Link Branches of individual public sector banks will prepare \nsummary sheet in duplicate and incorporate therein the payments made by all paying branches linked to them under each category of pension. The Link Branch will forward by 7th of eac h month one copy of pension payment scroll supported by necessary \ndocuments along with summary sheet to its Nodal Branch at LHO/ZO/RO looking after Government business. For this purpose, each public sector bank has to designate a Nodal Branch/Branches. The Nodal Branch/es will consolidate the transactions received \nfrom the link branches under their jurisdiction after duly checking the scrolls and prepare Daily Government Debit Scroll in duplicate and forward the original copy with scrolls and other document s on daily basis to the respective accounting authority e.g., CPAO in \ncase of Central Government Civil Pensioners. Simultaneously, it will send advice through Daily Memo (serially numbered for each financial year) to its Link Cell at \nNagpur (GAD in case of  SBI) for reimbursement/ settlement with Reserve Bank of India, \nCentral Accounts Section, Nagpur. For the purpose of monthly reconciliation, the Nodal 12 \n Point Branch will prepare in the first week of the following month a Date- wise Monthly \nStatement (DMS) in  triplicate indicating date- wise position reported to accounting \nauthorities through Daily Government Debit Scrolls and settled with Reserve Bank of \nIndia, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur through Link Cell of Nagpur in the previous month. The DMS will be submitted in duplicate to pension accounting authority (e.g. \nCPAO in case of civil pension by 10th of the following month).  \n23. It was unanimously decided to implement the Single Window System for \nreimbursement of pension payments made to Central Government Civil Pensioners by \npublic sector banks with effect from November 1, 2002. Subsequently, the  Single \nWindow System  was introduced for reimbursement of Defence Pension with effect from \nApril 1, 2007,  in the case of reimbursement of Telecom Pension payment s with effect \nfrom October 1, 2012 and in case of Railway Pension payments with effect from April 01, 2011. The procedure for disbursement, accounting and reimbursement of Defence/Railway/Telecom pension payments will be similar to those as applicable in t he \ncase of Central Civil Pensioners. However, r eimbursement of Railway Pensions will be \nsubject to further  conditions  as stated below : \n(a) There would be a running serial number on the paying branch scroll. It should be ensured that no scroll number is repeated or left out.  \n(b) The same check would be done on Nodal Branch Summary Scroll.  \n(c) At the pension accounting authority all amounts booked against duplicate scroll numbers, if any, would be checked and the RBI would be asked to put back these amounts to the Government accounts.  \n(d) The Nodal branches will be responsible for reconciliation with the Railways and for settling discrepancies.  \n(e) As a one time exercise, authorised banks will send the Nodal branch- wise \npaying branch directory structure with complete postal address, pin code, BSR code to Ministry of Railways and Central Accounts Section (CAS), RBI, Nagpur \nfor proper and prompt settlement and reconciliation.  \n  13 \n Payment of pension to Defence pensioners \n (i) Fake and fraudulent payments  \n24. The Office of the PCDA (Pension) has also noticed that in some cases of payment \nof gratuity and commutation amount were made to imposters on fake and fraudulent \nPPOs by the pension paying branches without observing prescribed checks. Defence \npension paying branches are ther efore requested to strictly follow the procedure laid \ndown in \u201cDefence Pension Payment Instructions\u201d by the PCDA (Pension) for \ndisbursement of pension to Defence pensioners to avoid fraudulent payments against \nfake pension payment orders.  \n(ii) First paymen t of pension  \n25. It has also been observed that in the cases of first payment of pension, either PPO \nnumbers were not mentioned on the scrolls or incorrect PPO numbers were mentioned \nmaking it difficult to verify the correctness of the payment. Further, these payments \nwere being shown in the main pension payment scrolls along with the regular monthly \npayments of Defence Pensioners. The Pension Paying Branches/ Link Branches / \nReimbursing Branches are advised to put in place a more efficient system to ensure the \nfollowing:  \n(a) In the cases of first payments of pension, pension paying branches should \nprepare scrolls carefully indicating correct PPO number, amount of gratuity and \ncommutation against the name of each pensioner and submit the same \nseparately on a monthly basis in addition to the regular monthly payment cases \nwhich will continue to be prepared separately along with separate summary \nsheet.  \n(b) Pension paying branches should prepare separate summary sheets for regular \nmonthly pension payment cases as well as  first pension payment case.  \n 14 \n Payment of Pension to Railway Pensioners \n(i) Fake and fraudulent payments  \n26. The Ministry of Railways has detected cases of fraud wherein pension/ pension \narrears have been disbursed to unauthorised persons by some agency banks against \nfake Pension Payment Orders (PPOs). Such fraudulent payments are made by pension \npaying branches without observing prescribed checks such as releasing payments by \nrelying upon calculation sheet not signed by authorised signatory, as also \nnoncompliance with laid down procedures, especially regarding receipt of PPOs by \nbanks. Railway pension paying branches are therefore requested to strictly follow the \nprocedure laid down in \u201cScheme for Payment of Railway Pension through Public Sector \nBanks\u201d by the Ministry of Railways (Railway Board) for disbursement of pension to \nRailway pensioners to avoid fraudulent payments against fake pension payment orders.  \n(ii) Issue of Due and Drawn statement  \n27. All agency banks may issue suitable instructions to their pension paying branches \nfor issuance of \u2018Due and Drawn\u2019 statement in the prescribed form to Railway \npensioners, whenever there is a change/revision in their pension, so as to avoid \ninconvenience to the pensioners.  (DGBA.GAD.No.H 2084/45.03.001/2009 -10 dated  \nSeptember 01, 2009)  \nCustomer Service  \n28. All agency banks may issue instructions to their dealing branches to adhere to the \nrecommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee relating to pension payments . A \nchecklist may be provided to the inspecting officers /auditors, which may at a minimum \ninclude the items given in Annex 1 . Agency banks may also instruct their internal \nauditors/inspectors to comment on the quality of customer service in their reports which \nmay be made available to Reserve Bank\u2019s inspecting officers, as and when they visit \nthe branches.  15 \n 29. Grievances of pensioners are not being addressed properly at the branch level \nespecially after the setting up of Centralised Pension Processing Centres (CPPCs). To \nprovide hassle free service to the pensioners, there should be a forum for regular \ninteraction and settlement of grievances. Accordingly, agency banks should appoint \none/two nodal officers at each Region/Zone for monitoring the resolution of grievances \nof pensioners on regular basis and the GM/CGM concerned should review the position \nat monthly intervals.  \n30. At locations outside the CPPCs, there should be designated nodal officers for \npension related complaints who should be easily accessible to pensioners and who \nshoul d hold regular meetings at different locations in their jurisdiction on the lines of \nPension Adalat. Each bank should establish toll free dedicated pension line manned by \ntrained persons with access to the database to answer queries, note down and redress \ncomplaints.  \n31. Following several complaints from pensioners alleging inordinate delay in disbursing \nrevised pension and arrears, agency banks were advised as under:  \n(a) Pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in crediting \npension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for the \ndelay after the due date and the compensation shall be credited to the \npensioner's account automatically without any claim from the pensioner on the \nsame day when the bank affords credit f or revised pension/ pension arrears, in \nrespect of all delayed pension payments made since October 1, 2008.  \n(b) Pension paying banks have been advised to put in place a mechanism to obtain \nimmediately the copies of pension orders from the pension paying author ities \ndirectly and make payments without waiting for receipt of instructions from the \nReserve Bank so that pensioners should get benefits announced by the \nGovernments in the succeeding month's pension payment itself.  \n(c) The branch should continue to be a point of referral for the pensioner lest he/she \nfeel disenfranchised.  16 \n (d) All branches having pension accounts should guide and assist the pensioners in \nall their dealings with the bank.  \n(e) Suitable arrangements should be made to place the arithmetic and other detail s \nabout pension calculations on the web, to be made available to the pensioners \nthrough the net or at the branches at periodic interval as may be necessary and \nsufficient advertisement is made about such arrangements.  \n(f) All claims for agency commission by banks  in respect of pension payments must \nbe accompanied by a certificate from ED/CGM in charge of government business \nthat there are no pension arrears to be credited/ delays in crediting regular \npension/arrears thereof.  \n(g) All agency banks disbursing pension are advised to provide considerate and \nsympathetic customer service to the pensioners, specially to those pensioners \nwho are of old age.  \nTraining \n32. In order to create better awareness among staff about pension payment schemes/ \nrules, banks may include this as an integral part of the training programmes conducted \nby their training establishments.  \n33. Regular training session for bank personnel dealing with pension matters may be \norganised in consultation with concerned Government Department.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17 \n         Annex 1 \nChecklist relating to Government Business (pension related) for \ninternal/concurrent audit  \nInternal inspections should assess branch performance in servicing pensioner \ncustomers. In this regard, the following may be ensured:  \n1. A specific questionnaire covering all aspects of pension payment may be devised for \nuse during inspection of pension paying branches.  \n2.

Introduction  \n1.1 In the backdrop of the global financial crisis that started in 2007, the Basel Com mittee on \nBanking Supervision (BCBS) proposed certain reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity \nregulations with the objective of promoting a more resilient banking sector. In this regard, the \nBasel III rules text on liquidity \u2013 \u201cBasel III: Intern ational framework for liquidity risk \nmeasurement, standards and monitoring\u201d was issued in December 2010 which presented the \ndetails of global regulatory standards on liquidity. Two minimum standards, viz., Liquidity \nCoverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for funding liquidity were \nprescribed by the Basel Committee for achieving two separate but complementary objectives.  \n1.2 The LCR promotes short -term resilience of banks to potential liquidity disruptions by ensuring \nthat they have suffici ent high quality liquid assets (HQLAs) to survive an acute stress scenario \nlasting for 30 days. The NSFR promotes resilience over a longer -term time horizon by requiring \nbanks to fund their activities with more stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis . \n1.3 At the time of issuing the December 2010 document, the  Basel Committee had put in place a \nrigorous process to review the standard and its implications for financial markets, credit extension \nand economic growth and agreed to review the development of  the NSFR over an observation \nperiod. The focus of this review was on addressing any unintended consequences for financial \nmarket functioning and the economy, and on improving its design with respect to several key \nissues, notably: (i) the impact on retail  business activities; (ii) the treatment of short -term matched \nfunding of assets and liabilities; and (iii) analysis of sub- one year buckets for both assets and \nliabilities.  \n1.4 These guidelines are based on the final rules text on NSFR published by the BC BS in October \n2014 and take into account the Indian conditions. \n \n \n2. Objective  \nThe objective of NSFR is to ensure that banks maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the \ncomposition of their assets and off -balance sheet activities. A sustainable fundi ng structure is \nintended to reduce the probability of erosion of a bank\u2019s liquidity position due to disruptions in a \nbank\u2019s regular sources of funding that would increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead 4 \n to broader systemic stress. The NSFR lim its overreliance on short- term wholesale funding, \nencourages better assessment of funding risk across all on - and off -balance sheet items, and \npromotes funding stability. \n3. Scope  \nThe NSFR would be applicable for Indian banks at the solo as well as consolidat ed level. For \nforeign banks operating as branches in India, the framework would be applicable on stand- alone \nbasis (i.e., for Indian operations only). \n4. Definition of NSFR  \nThe NSFR is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required \nstable funding. \u201cAvailable stable funding\u201d (ASF) is defined as the portion of capital and \nliabilities expected to be reliable over the time horizon considered by the NSFR, which extends \nto one year. The amount of stable funding required (\"Requir ed stable funding\") (RSF) of a \nspecific institution is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of the \nvarious assets held by that institution as well as those of its off -balance sheet (OBS) exposures.  \n5. Minimum Requirement and Imp lementation Date  \n  \nThe above ratio should be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis. However, the NSFR would \nbe supplemented by supervisory assessment of the stable funding and liquidity risk profile of a \nbank. On the basis of such assessment, the Reserve Bank may require an individual bank to adopt \nmore stringent standards to reflect its funding risk profile and its compliance with the Sound \nPrinciples (issued vide  circula r \u201cLiquidity Risk Management by Banks \u201d \nDBOD.BP.No.56/21.04.098/ 2012- 13 dated November 7, 2012 ). The NSFR would be binding on \nbanks with effect from a date which will be communicated in due course.  \n \n 5 \n 6. Calibrations of ASF and RSF -  Criteria and Assumption s \nASF and RSF reflect the amount of funding available and required for liabilities and assets \n(including off balance sheet assets) .The amounts of ASF and RSF  specified in the  BCBS  standard \nare calibrated to reflect the presumed degree of stability of liabi lities and liquidity of assets.  \n \n6.1 The calibration reflects the stability of liabilities across two dimensions:  \n(a)  Funding tenor \u2013 The NSFR is generally calibrated such that longer -term liabilities are \nassumed to be more stable than short -term liabilities.  \n(b)  Funding type and counterparty \u2013 The NSFR is calibrated under the assumption that \nshort -term (maturing in less than one year) deposits provided by retail customers and \nfunding provided by small business customers are behaviourally more stable than \nwholesa le funding of the same maturity from other counterparties.  \n \n6.2 In determining the appropriate amounts of required stable funding for various assets, the \nfollowing criteria are taken into consideration, recognising the potential trade -offs between these \ncriteria: \n(a)  Resilient credit creation \u2013 The NSFR requires stable funding for some proportion of \nlending to the real economy in order to ensure the continuity of this type of \nintermediation.  \n(b)  Bank behaviour \u2013 The NSFR is calibrated under the assumption that ba nks may seek \nto roll over a significant proportion of maturing loans to preserve customer relationships.  \n(c)  Asset tenor \u2013 The NSFR assumes that some short -dated assets (maturing in less than \none year) require a smaller proportion of stable funding because ba nks would be able to \nallow some proportion of those assets to mature instead of rolling them over.  \n(d)  Asset quality and liquidity value \u2013 The NSFR assumes that unencumbered, high -\nquality assets that can be securitised or traded, and thus can be readily used as collateral to \nsecure additional funding or sold in the market, do not need to be wholly financed with \nstable funding. 6 \n 6.3 Additional stable funding sources are also required to support at least a small portion of the \npotential calls on liquidity arising from OBS commitments and contingent funding obligations.  \n \n6.4 Definitions on various components of NSFR indicated in these guidelines mirror those \noutlined in the circular on LCR, unless otherwise specified. All references to LCR definitions in \nthe NSFR  refer to the definitions in the LCR standard issued vide circular dated June 9, 2014  and \nmodified vide circular dated March 31, 2015;  March 23, 2016 and August 2, 2017 . \n \n7. Definition and computation of Available Stable Funding  \n7.1 The amount of ASF is measured , based on the broad characteristics of the relative stability of \nan institution\u2019s funding sources, including the contractual maturity of its liabilities and the \ndifferences in the propensity of different types of funding providers to withdraw their funding. The \namount of ASF is calculated by first assigning the carrying value of an institution\u2019s capital and \nliabilities to one of five categories as presented below. The amount assigned to each category is \nthen multiplied by an ASF factor, and the total ASF is the  sum of the weighted amounts. Carrying \nvalue represents the amount at which a liability or equity instrument is recorded before the \napplication of any regulatory deductions, filters or other adjustments. \n \nTable 1  \nSr. No. Components of ASF category (liabil ity categories)  Associated \nASF factor  \n(i) \u2022 Total regulatory capital (excluding Tier 2 instruments with residual \nmaturity of less than one year)  \n\u2022 Other capital instruments with effective residual maturity of one year \nor more  \n\u2022 Other  liabilities with effective residual maturity of one year or more  100%  \n(ii) \u2022 Stable non- maturity (demand) deposits and term deposits with residual  \nmaturity of less than one year provided by retail and small business \ncustomers 95% \n(iii) \u2022 Less stable non -maturity deposits and term dep osits with residual  \nmaturity of less than one year provided by retail and small business \ncustomers 90% 7 \n (iv) \u2022 Funding with residual maturity of less than one year provided by non-   \nfinancial corporate customers  \n\u2022 Operational deposits  \n\u2022 Funding with residual ma turity of less than one year from sovereigns, \nPSEs, and multilateral and national development banks  \n\u2022 Other funding with residual maturity between six months and less \nthan one year not included in the above categories, including funding \nprovided by central banks and financial institutions  50% \n(v) \u2022 All other liabilities and equity not included in the above categories, \nincluding liabilities without a stated maturity (with a specific treatment \nfor deferred tax liabilities and minority interests)  \n\u2022 NSFR derivative liabilities net of NSFR derivative assets if NSFR \nderivative liabilities are greater than NSFR derivative assets  \n\u2022 \u201cTrade date\u201d payables arising from purchases of financial instruments, \nforeign currencies and commodities.  0% \n  \n \n7.2 Liabilities and capital r eceiving a 100% ASF factor  \nLiabilities and capital instruments receiving a 100% ASF factor comprise: \n(a)  the total amount of regulatory capital, before the application of capital deductions, as \ndefined in paragraph 4.2 of the Master Circular  on Basel III Capital dated July 1, 2015 , \nexcluding the proportion of Tier 2 instruments with residual maturity of less than one \nyear;  \n(b)  the total amount of any capital instrument not included in (a) that has an effective \nresidual maturity of one year or more, but excluding any instruments with explicit or \nembedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the expected maturity to less than one \nyear; and  \n(c)  the total amount of secured and unsecure d borrowings and liabilities (including term \ndeposits1) with effective2 residual maturities of one year or more.

This category may include short positions \nand open maturity positions. Two exceptions can be recognised for liabilities without a \nstated maturity:  \n\u2022 first, deferred tax liabilities, which should be treated according to the nearest \npossible date on which such liabilities could be realised; and  \n\u2022 second, minority interest, which should be treated according to the term of the \ninstrument, usually in perpetuity.  \nThese liabilities would then be assigned either a 100% ASF factor if the effective \nmaturity is one year or greater, or 50%, if the effective maturity is between six months \nand less than one year;  \n(c) NSFR derivative liabilities as calculated according to paragraphs 8.1 below, net of \nNSFR derivative assets as calculated according to paragraph 10.12 below, if NSFR \nderivative liabilities are greater than NSFR der ivative assets; and  \n(d) \u201ctrade date\u201d payables arising from purchases of financial instruments, foreign \ncurrencies and commodities that (i) are expected to settle within the standard settlement \ncycle or period that is customary for the relevant exchange or type  of transaction, or (ii) \nhave failed to, but are still expected to, settle.  \n \n8. ASF \u2013 Other Requirements  \n8.1 Calculation of derivative liability amounts  \nDerivative liabilities are calculated first based on the replacement cost for derivative contracts \n(obtained by marking to market) where the contract has a negative value. If the derivative \nexposure is covered by an eligible bilateral netting contract as specified in the Annex 20 ( Part B) \nof the Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations3, the replace ment cost for the set of \nderivative exposures covered by the contract will be the net replacement cost. In calculating \nNSFR derivative liabilities, collateral posted in the form of variation margin in connection with \nderivative contracts, regardless of the  asset type, must be deducted from the negative replacement \ncost amount. \n \n                                                      \n3 Currently, relevant only in case of banks \u2019 exposures to Qualifying Central Counterparties (QCCPs) subject to \nconditions mentioned in paragraph 5.15.3.9 of the Master Circular. In case of OTC derivatives, please refer to circular \nDBOD.No.BP.BC.48/21.06.001/2010- 11 dated October 1, 2010  on Prudential Norms for Off- Balance Sheet Exposures \nof Banks \u2013 Bilateral netting of counterparty credit exposures. As indicated therein, bilateral netting of mark -to-market \n(MTM) values arising on account of derivative contracts is not permitted.  10 \n 8.2 When determining the maturity of an equity or liability instrument, investors are assumed to \nredeem a call option at the earliest possible date. For funding with options exercisa ble at the \nbank\u2019s discretion, the RBI may take into account reputational factors that may limit a bank\u2019s  \nability not to exercise the option. In particular, where the market expects certain liabilities to be \nredeemed before their legal final maturity date, banks should assume such behaviour for the \npurpose of the NSFR and include these liabilities in the corresponding ASF category. For long-\ndated liabilities, only the portion of cash flows falling at or beyond the six- month and one -year \ntime horizons should be treated as having an effective residual maturity of six months or more \nand one year or more, respectively.  \n \n9. Definition and computation of R equired S table F unding (RSF)  \n \n9.1 The amount of required stable funding is measured based on the broad characte ristics of the \nliquidity risk profile of an institution\u2019s assets and OBS exposures. The amount of required stable \nfunding is calculated by first assigning the carrying value 4of an institution\u2019s assets to the \ncategories listed in the Table 2 below.  Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the NSFR standard, \nassets should be allocated to maturity buckets according to their contractual residual maturity. \nHowever, this should take into account embedded optionality, such as put or call options, which \nmay affect th e actual maturity date as described in paragraphs 8.2 and 10.2.  The amount assigned \nto each category is then multiplied by its associated required stable funding (RSF) factor, and the \ntotal RSF is the sum of the weighted amounts added to the amount of OBS  activity (or potential \nliquidity exposure) multiplied by its associated RSF factor (Table 3). Definitions mirror those \noutlined in the extant LCR guidelines, unless otherwise specified5. \n \nTable 2  \nSr. \nNo. Components of RSF category  Associated \nRSF f actor  \n(i) \u2022 Coins and banknotes  \n\u2022 Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) including excess CRR  0% \n                                                      \n4 Carrying value of an asset item should generally be recorded by following its accounting value, ie net of specific \nprovisions in line with paragraph 52 of the Basel II Standardised Approach and  paragraph 12 of the Basel III leverage \nratio framework and disclosure requirements.  \n5 For the purposes of calculating the NSFR, HQLA are defined as all HQLA without regard to LCR operational \nrequirements and LCR caps on Level 2 and Level 2B assets that ma y otherwise limit the ability of some HQLA to be \nincluded as eligible HQLA in calculation of the LCR.

Where securities \nor other assets posted as initial margin for derivative contracts would otherwise receive a \nhigher RSF factor , they should retain that higher factor. For OTC transactions, any fixed \nindependent amount a bank was contractually required to post at the inception of the \nderivatives transaction should be considered as initial margin, regardless of whether any of \nthis margin was returned to the bank in the form of variation margin payments. If the initial \nmargin is formulaically defined at a portfolio level, the amount considered as initial margin \n                                                      \n9 Non-operational deposits held at other financial institutions should have the same treatment as loans to financi al \ninstitutions, taking into account the term of the operation.  \n10 Initial margin posted on behalf of a customer, where the bank does not guarantee performance of the third party, \nwould be exempt from this requirement.  This refers to the cases in which the bank provides a customer access to a third \nparty (e.g. a CCP) for the purpose of clearing derivatives, where the transactions are executed in the name of the \ncustomer, and the bank does not guarantee the performance of this third party.    16 \n should reflect this calculated amount as of the NSFR measurement date, ev en if, for \nexample, the total amount of margin physically posted to the bank\u2019s counterparty is lower \nbecause of VM payments received. For centrally cleared transactions, the amount of initial \nmargin should reflect the total amount of margin posted (IM and VM) less any mark -to-\nmarket losses on the applicable portfolio of cleared transactions.  \n \n(b)  other unencumbered performing loans that do not qualify for the 35% or lower risk \nweight under the Basel II Standardised Approach for credit risk and have residual \nmaturities of one year or more, excluding loans to financial institutions;  \n(c)  unencumbered securities with a remaining maturity of one year or more and exchange -\ntraded equities, that are not in default and do not qualify as  SLR/ HQLA according to the \nLCR; and  \n(d)  physical traded commodities, including gold.  \n \n9.9 Assets assigned a 100% RSF factor  \nAssets assigned a 100% RSF factor comprise:  \n(a)  all assets that are encumbered11 for a period of one year or more;   \n(b)  NSFR derivative assets as calculated according to paragr aphs 10.12 net of NSFR \nderivative liabilities as calculated according to paragraphs 8.1 , if NSFR derivative assets \nare greater than NSFR derivative liabilities;  \n(c)  all other assets not included in the above categories, including non- performing loans12, \nloans to financial institutions with a residual maturity of one year or more, non- exchange -\ntraded equities, fixed assets, items deducted from regulatory capital, retained interest, \ninsurance assets, subsidiary interests and defaulted securities; and  \n(d)  5% of derivative liabilities (ie negative replacement cost amount) as calculated \naccording to paragraph 8.1 (before deducting variation margin posted) . \n(e) All \u2018standard\u2019 restructured loans which attract higher risk and/or additional \nprovisioning. \n \n                                                      \n11 In case of a co llateral pledged in a repo operation with remaining maturity of one year or greater but where the \ncollateral pledged matures in less than one year, the collateral should be considered encumbered for the term of the repo \nor secured transaction, even if the actual maturity of the collateral is shorter than one year. This follows because \ncollateral would have to be replaced  once it matures  \n12 As defined in Master Circular - Prude ntial norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning \npertaining to Advances dated July 1, 2015  17 \n 10. RSF \u2013 Other Requirements  \n10.1 The RSF factors assigned to various types of assets are intended to approximate the amount \nof a particular asset that would have to be funded, either because it will be rolled over, or because \nit would not be monetised through sale or used as c ollateral in a secured borrowing transaction \nover the course of one year without significant expense. Under the standard, such amounts are \nexpected to be supported by stable funding. \n \n10.2 Assets should be allocated to the appropriate RSF factor based on t heir residual maturity or \nliquidity value. When determining the maturity of an instrument, investors should be assumed to \nexercise any option to extend maturity. For assets with options exercisable at the bank\u2019s \ndiscretion, RBI may take into account reputa tional factors that may limit a bank\u2019s ability not to \nexercise the option13 and prescribe higher RSF Factor. In particular, where the market expects \ncertain assets to be extended in their maturity, banks should assume such behaviour for the \npurpose of the N SFR and include these assets in the corresponding RSF category. If there is a \ncontractual provision with a review date to determine whether a given facility or loan is renewed \nor not, RBI  may authorise  banks  on a case by case basis, to use the next review date as the \nmaturity date. In doing so, RBI  will consider the incentives created and the actual likelihood that \nsuch facilities/loans will not be renewed. For amortising loans  and other claims , the portion that \ncomes due within the one -year horizon can be treated in the less- than- one-year residual maturity \ncategory.  \n \n10.3 For purposes of determining its required stable funding, an institution should (i) include \nfinancial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been \nexecuted, and (ii) exclude financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which \na sales order has been executed, even if such transactions have not been reflected in the balance \nsheet under a settlement -date accounting model, provided that (i) such transactions are not \nreflected as derivatives or secured financing transactions in the institution\u2019s balance sheet, and \n(ii) the effects of such transactions will be reflected in the institution\u2019s balance sheet when \nsettled.  \n \n                                                      \n13 This could reflect a case where a bank may imply that it would be subject to funding risk if it did not exercise an \noption on its own asse ts.   18 \n 10.4 Encumbered assets: A ssets on the balance sheet that are encumbered 14for one year or more \nreceive a 100% RSF factor. Assets encumbered for a period of between six months and less than \none year that would, if unencumbered, receive an RSF factor lower than or equal to 50% , recei ve a \n50% RSF factor. Assets encumbered for between six months and less than one year that would, if \nunencumbered, receive an RSF factor higher than 50% , retain that higher RSF factor. Where assets \nhave less than six months remaining in the encumbrance peri od, those assets may receive the same \nRSF factor as an equivalent asset that is unencumbered. In addition, for the purposes of calculating \nthe NSFR, assets that are encumbered for exceptional15 central bank liquidity  operations may \nreceive RSF  factor  which must not be lower than the RSF factor applied to the equivalent asset \nthat is unencumbered. \n \n10.5 Encumbrance treatment applied to secured lending ( e.g. reverse repo) where collateral \nreceived does not appear on bank\u2019s balance sheet, and it has been rehypo thecated or sold \nthereby creating a short position  - The encumbrance treatment should be applied to the on-\nbalance sheet receivable to the extent that the transaction cannot mature without the bank returning \nthe collateral received to the counterparty. For  a transaction to be \u201cunencumbered\u201d, it must be \n\u201cfree of legal, regulatory, contractual or other restrictions on the ability of the bank to liquidate, \nsell, transfer or assign the asset\u201d. Since the liquidation of the cash receivable is contingent on the \nreturn of collateral that is no longer held by the bank, the receivable should be considered as \nencumbered. When the collateral received from a secured funding transaction has been \nrehypothecated, the receivable should be considered encumbered for the term o f the \nrehypothecation of the collateral. When the collateral received from a secured funding transaction \nhas been sold outright, thereby creating a short position, the receivable related to the original \nsecured funding transaction should be considered encu mbered for the term of the residual maturity \nof this receivable. Thus, the on- balance sheet receivable should:  \n \n\u2022 be treated according to para 10.9 if the remaining period of encumbrance is less than six \nmonths ( i.e. it is considered as being unencumbered in the NSFR);  \n\u2022 be assigned a 50% or higher RSF factor if the remaining period of encumbrance is \nbetween six months and less than one year according to paragraph 10.4; and  \n                                                      \n14 Encumbered assets include but are not limited to assets backing securities or covered bonds and assets pledged in \nsecurities financing transactions or collateral swaps. \u201cUnencumbered\u201d is defined in LCR circular dated June 9, 2014 .   \n15 In general, exceptional central bank liquidity operations are considered to be non- standard, temporary operations \nconducted by the central bank in order to achieve its mandate in a period of market -wide financial stress and/or \nexceptional macroeconomic challenges.   19 \n \u2022 be assigned a 100% RSF factor if the remaining period of encumbrance is greater than \none year according to paragraph 10.4.  \n \n \n10.6  Encumbrance treatment applied to secured lending ( e.g. reverse repo)  transactions where \ncollateral received appear s on bank\u2019s balance sheet, and it has been rehypothecated or sold thereby \ncreating a short posit ion- Collateral received that appears on a bank\u2019s balance sheet and has been \nrehypothecated ( e.g. encumbered to a repo) should be treated as encumbered according to paragraph \n10.4. Consequently, the collateral received should:  \n\u2022 be treated as being unencumbered if the remaining period of encumbrance is less than \nsix months according to paragraph 10.4 of the NSFR standard, and receive the same RSF \nfactor as an equivalent asset that is unencumbered;  \n\u2022 be assigned a 50% or higher RSF factor if the remaining peri od of encumbrance is \nbetween six months and less than one year according to paragraph 10.4; and  \n\u2022 be assigned a 100% RSF factor if the remaining period of encumbrance is greater than \none year according to paragraph 10.4 .  \n \nIf the collateral has been sold outright, thereby creating a short position, the corresponding on -\nbalance sheet receivable should be considered encumbered for the term of the residual maturity of \nthis receivable, and receive an RSF factor according to para 10.5. \n \n10.7 For  assets that  are owned by banks, but segregated to satisfy statutory requirements for the \nprotection of customer equity in margined trading accounts, should be reported in accordance with \nthe underlying exposure, whether or not the segregation requirement is separately clas sified on a \nbank\u2019s balance sheet. However, those assets should also be treated according to paragraph 10.4 . \nThat is, they could be subject to a higher RSF depending on (the term of) encumbrance. The (term \nof) encumbrance should be determined by authorities , taking into account whether the institution \ncan freely dispose or exchange such assets and the term of the liability to the bank\u2019s customer(s) \nthat generates the segregation requirement.  \n10.8 Secured financing transactions: For secured funding arrangements, use of balance sheet \nand accounting treatments should generally result in banks excluding, from their assets, securities \nwhich they have borrowed in securities financing transactions (such as reverse repos and collateral \nswaps) where they do not have b eneficial ownership. In contrast, banks should include securities \nthey have lent in securities financing transactions where they retain beneficial ownership. Banks \nshould also not include any securities they have received through collateral swaps if those \nsecurities do not appear on their balance sheets. Where banks have encumbered securities in repos 20 \n or other securities financing transactions, but have retained beneficial ownership and those assets \nremain on the bank\u2019s balance sheet, the bank should alloca te such securities to the appropriate \nRSF category  according to its characteristics (whether it HQLA, its term, issuer etc. ). \n \n10.9   The treatment  (applicable RSF factor)  for the amount receivable by a bank under reverse \nrepo transaction is the same as wi th any other loan, which will depend on the counterparty and \nterm of the operation, w ith the exception of loans (reverse repos) to financial institutions with \nresidual maturity of less than six months secured by level 1 assets (which receive a 10% RSF \nfactor as per paragraph 9.4 ) or by other assets (which receive a 15% RSF factor as per paragraph \n9.5). \n \n10.10 Amounts receivables and payable under these securities financing transactions should \ngenerally be reported on a gross basis, meaning that the gross am ount of such receivables and \npayables should be reported on the RSF side and ASF side, respectively. The only exception is \nsecurities financing transactions with a single counterparty may be measured net when calculating \nthe NSFR, provided that the netting  conditions set out in Paragraph 16.4.4.2 of circular \u2018Revised \nFramework for Leverage Ratio\u2019 dated January 8, 2015  are met.  \n \n10.11 For loans which are only partially secured and are therefore separated into secured and \nunsecured portions with different risk weights under Basel II, the specific characteristics of these \nportions of loans should be taken into account for the calculation of the NSFR: the secured and \nunsecured porti ons of a loan should each be treated according to its characteristics and assigned \nthe corresponding RSF factor. If it is not possible to draw the distinction between the secured and \nunsecured part of the loan, the higher RSF factor should apply to the who le loan.  \n \n10.12 Calculation of derivative asset amounts: Derivative assets are calculated first based on the \nreplacement cost for derivative contracts (obtained by marking to market) where the contract has a \npositive value. When an eligible bilateral netti ng contract is in place that meets the conditions as \nspecified in Annex 20 (part B) of the Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations dated July \n1, 2014 , the replacement cost for the set of derivative exposures covered by the contract will be \nthe net replacement cost. In calculating NSFR derivative assets16, collateral received in connection \nwith derivative contracts may not offset the positive replacement cost amount, r egardless of \n                                                      \n16 NSFR derivative assets = (derivative assets) \u2013 (cash collateral received as variation margin on derivative assets).   21 \n whether or not netting is permitted under the bank\u2019s operative accounting or risk -based \nframework, unless it is received in the form of cash variation margin and meets the conditions as \nspecified in  paragraph 16.4.3.8 of the Revised Framework for Leverage Ratio dated January 8, \n2015 . Any remaining balance sheet liability associated with (a) variation margin received that \ndoes not meet the criteria above or (b) init ial margin received may not offset derivative assets and \nshould be assigned a 0% ASF factor. \n \n10.13   If an on- balance sheet asset is associated with collateral posted as initial margin to the \nextent that the bank\u2019s accounting framework reflects on balance  sheet, for purposes of the NSFR, \nthat asset should not be counted as an encumbered asset in the calculation of a bank\u2019s RSF to \navoid any double -counting. \n \n10.14   Derivative transactions with central banks arising from the latter\u2019s short- term monetary \npolicy and liquidity operations to be excluded from the reporting bank\u2019s NSFR computation and to \noffset unrealised capital gains and losses related to these derivative transactions from ASF. These \ntransactions include foreign exchange derivatives such as fore ign exchange swaps, and should have \na maturity of less than six months at inception. As such, the bank\u2019s NSFR would not change due to \nentering a short -term derivative transaction with its central bank for the purpose of short -term \nmonetary policy and liqui dity operations.  \n \n11. Frequency of calculation and reporting  \nBanks are required to meet the NSFR requirement on an ongoing basis and they should have the \nrequired systems in place for such calculation and monitoring. The NSFR as at the end of each \nquarter  (starting date will be announced in due course ) should be reported to the RBI (Department \nof Banking Supervision, CO) in the prescribed format (BLR 7) within 15 days from the end of the \nquarter.  \n \n12.  NSFR Disclosure Standards  \n \n12.1 To promote the consist ency and usability of disclosures related to the NSFR, and to enhance \nmarket discipline, banks will be required to publish their NSFRs according to a common template  \n(Appendix II ). Banks must publish this disclosure along with the publication of their fina ncial \nstatements ( i.e. typically quarterly or semi- annually), irrespective of whether the financial \nstatements are audited.  The NSFR information must be calculated on a consolidated basis and \npresented in Indian Rupee . 22 \n  \n12.2 Banks must either include the d isclosures required by this document in their published \nfinancial reports or, at a minimum, provide a direct and prominent link to the complete disclosure \non their websites or in publicly available regulatory reports.  Banks must also make available on \ntheir websites, or through publicly available regulatory reports, an archive of all templates relating \nto prior reporting periods. Irrespective of the location of the disclosure, the minimum disclosure \nrequirements must be in the format required by this docume nt. \n \n12.3 Data must be presented as quarter -end observations. For banks reporting on a semi -annual \nbasis, the NSFR must be reported for each of the two preceding quarters. For banks reporting on an \nannual basis, the NSFR must be reported for the preceding four quarters. Both unweighted and \nweighted values of the NSFR components must be disclosed unless otherwise indicated. Weighted \nvalues are calculated as the values after ASF or RSF factors are applied.  \n \n12.4 In addition to the prescribed common template,  banks should provide a sufficient qualitative \ndiscussion around the NSFR to facilitate an understanding of the results and the accompanying data. \nFor example, where significant to the NSFR, banks could discuss  the drivers of their NSFR results \nand the rea sons for intra -period changes as well as the changes over time ( e.g. changes in strategies, \nfunding structure, circumstances etc.).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 23 \n Appendix  I \nStatement of NSFR  BLR 7  \nName of the Bank   \nStatement for the Quarter Ending   \nSr. \nNo. Items   \nA.

The \nreports should reach the Regional Office within a period of 15 days from the end of the \nperiod to which they relate.  \nVII. Common  guidelines for priority sector loans  \nBanks should comply with the following common guidelines for all categories of \nadvances under the priority sector . \n1. Service charges  \nNo loan related and adhoc service charges / inspection charges should be levied on \npriority sector loans up to `25,000. In the case  of eligible priority sector loans to \nSHGs / JLGs, this limit will be applicable per member and not to the group as a \nwhole.  \n2. Receipt, Sanction / Rejection / Disbursement Register  \nA register / electronic record should be maintained by the bank , wherein the date of \nreceipt, sanction / rejection / disbursement with reasons thereof, etc., should be \nrecorded. The register / electronic record should be made available to all inspecting \nagencies . \n3. Issue of Acknowledgement of Loan Applications  \nUCB s should provide ack nowledgement for loan applications received under \npriority sector loans. Bank Boards should prescribe a time limit within which the \nbank communicates its decision in writing to the applicants .   \n \n-11- \n ANNEX -II \nPriority Sector Target Achievement - Calculation of shortfall / excess  \nIllustrative example:  \nTables 1 and 2 below illustrate the method followed for computation of shortfall / excess in \npriority sector target achievement at the end of the financial year under the revised PSL \nguidelines.  \n(Table 1)  \nAmount in ` thousands  \nQuarter ended  PSL targets  Priority Sector \nAmount Outstanding  Shortfall / Excess  \nJune  3,29,61,56,032  3,16,93,80,800  -12,67,75,232  \nSeptember  3,08,82,65,369  3,11,94,59,969  3,11,94,600  \nDecember  3,17,69,48,703  3,19,29,13,269  1,59,64,566  \nMarch  3,24,56,09,908  3,21,34,75,156  -3,21,34,752  \nTotal  12,80,69,80,012  12,69,52,29,194  -11,17,50,818  \nAverage  3,20,17,45,003  3,17,38,07,299  -2,79,37,704  \n \n(Table 2)  \nAmount in ` thousands  \nQuarter ended  PSL targets  Priority Sector \nAmount Outstanding  Shortfall / Excess  \nJune  3,29,61,56,032  3,27,96,75,252  -164,80,780  \nSeptember  3,08,82,65,369  3,12,37,80,421  3,55,15,052 \nDecember  3,17,69,48,703  3,27,22,57,164  9,53,08,461  \nMarch  3,24,56,09,908  3,21,31,53,809  -3,24,56,099  \nTotal  12,80,69,80,012  12,88,88,66,646  8,18,86,634  \nAverage  3,20,17,45,003  3,22,22,16,661  2,04,71,658  \n \nIn the example given in Table - 1, the bank has average shortfall of `2,79,37,704 thousand  at \nthe end of the financial year.

In view of c hanges that have  taken place in the financial sector over the \nyears, Reserve Bank of India had constituted a \u201c Committee of Executive Directors\u201d of the \nBank to study the efficacy of the Scheme and suggest measures for improvement.  The \nCommittee\u2019s recommendations were discussed with various stakeholders and based on their \nfeedback, it has been decided that the following \u2018action points\u2019 will be implemented by the \nLead Banks.   \n \ni. In view of the critical role played by LDMs, it may be ensured that officials posted as \nLDMs  possess requisite leadership skills . \nii. Apart from the provision of a separate office space, technical infrastructure like \ncomputers, printer , data connectivity, etc. which are basic necessities  for LDMs to \ndischarge their core responsibilities  may b e provided to LDMs\u2019 O ffice without \nexception.  \niii. It is suggested that a dedicated vehicle may be provided to LDMs \u2019 to facilitate closer \nliaison with the bank officials, district administration officials as also to organise/ \nattend various financial literacy initiatives  and meetings .  \n  \n \n2 \n \niv. The absence of a specialist officer /assistant for data entry /analysis  is a common  and  \nmajor  issue faced by LDMs. Liberty to hire the services of skilled computer operator \nmay be given to the LDM s to overcome the shortage of staff/ in case appropriate staff \nis not posted at LDM office.  \n \n2. You are advised to take appropriate action as required. Further, for successful \nfunctioning of the Lead Bank Scheme, we expect Lead Banks to go the extra mile to provide \nfacilities over and above the bare minimum to these critical field functionaries.  \n \nYours faithfully, \n \n \n \n(Gautam Prasad Borah)  \nChief General Manager -in-Charge \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT1565249E7EEC9464803A8C286575D653560.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 06, 2018", "info": " \n\ufffd \u0935 \u0924\u094d  \u0924 \u0940\u092f \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0935\u0947\u0936\u0928 \u0914\u0930 \ufffd\u0935\u0915\u093e\u0938 \ufffd\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , \u0915\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f ,10 \u0935\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932 , \u0915\ufffd\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928 , \u0936\u0939\ufffd\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924\ufffd\u0938\u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d ,\u092a\u094b\u0938\u094d\u091f \u092c\u0949\u0915\u094d\u0938 \u0938\u0902. 10014,\u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 -400001 \nFinancial Inclusion & Development Dept,  Central Office,10th Floor, Central Office Building,  Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg,P.B.No.10014,Mumbai -1 \n\u091f\u0947\u0932\ufffd Tel:022- 22601000  \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938\u0903 91-22-22621 011/22610943/22610948 \u0908 -\u092e\u0947\u0932 : cgmincfidd@rbi.org.in \n\ufffd\u0939\u0902\u0926\ufffd \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948,\u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u094b\u0917 \u092c\u095d\u093e\u0907\u090f\u0964  \n \u201c\u091a\u0947\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0928\u0940  : - \u092e\u0947\u0932 \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c \ufffd\u0915 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e   \u0921\u093e\u0915, \u090f\u0938\u090f\u092e\u090f\u0938 \u092f\u093e \u092b\u094b\u0928 \u0915\u0949\u0932 \u0915\u0947 \u091c\ufffd\u0930\u090f \ufffd\u0915\u0938\u0940 \u0915\ufffd \u092d\u0940 \u0935\u094d \u092f \u093f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0917\u0924 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930\ufffd \u091c\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092c \ufffd\u0915 \u0915\u0947 \u0916\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u092c\u094d \u092f\u094c \u0930\u093e, \u092a\u093e\u0938\u0935\u0921\u0930\u094d \u0906\ufffd\u0926 \u0928\u0939\ufffd\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u0902\u0917\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0940 \n\u0939\u0948\u0964 \u092f\u0939 \u0927\u0928 \u0930\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d \u0924\u093e \u0935 \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u0939\ufffd\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0910\u0938\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d \u0924\u093e \u0935\ufffd \u0915\u093e \ufffd\u0915\u0938\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \u0924\u0930\ufffd\u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u091c\u0935\u093e\u092c \u092e\u0924 \u0926\ufffd\u093f\u091c\u090f\u0964 \" \nCaution:  RBI never sends mails, SMSs  or makes calls asking for personal information like bank account details,   passwords, etc. It never \nkeeps or offers funds to anyone.

In view of changes that have taken place in the financial sector  \nover the years, Reserve Bank of India had constituted a \u201c Committee of Executive Directors\u201d \nof the Bank to study the efficacy of the Scheme and suggest measures for improvement. The \nCommittee\u2019s  recommendations were discussed with various stakeholders and based on their \nfeedback, it has been deci ded that the following \u2018 action points \u2019 will be implemented by the \nSLBC Convener Banks/Lead Banks .  \n \ni. State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC ) meetings should primarily focus on policy \nissues with participation of only the senior functionaries of the banks/ Government \nDepartments .  All routine issues may be delegated to sub- committee(s) of the SLBC.  \nA Steering Sub-committee may be c onstituted in the SLBC to del iberate on agenda \nproposals from different stakeholders and finalise a compact agenda for the SLBC \nmeetings. Typically, the Sub-Committee could consist of SLBC Convenor, RBI & \nNABARD representatives & senior State Government representative from the \nconcerned department,  e.g. Finance/ Institutional Finance and two to three banks \nhaving major presence. Other issue-s pecific sub-committees may be constituted as \nrequired. A Revised Agenda for SLBC meetings is attached as Annex I for \nimplementation.  \n  \n \n2 \n \n \nii. In cases  where the Managing Director /Chief Executive Officer /Executive Director  of \nthe SLBC  Convenor  Bank  is unable  to attend SLBC  Meetings, the Regional  Director  \nof the RBI shall co-chair the meetings  along with the Additional  Chief  \nSecretary/Development Commissioner  of the State concerned. \n \niii. The corporate business targets for branches, blocks, districts and states may be \naligned with the Annual Credit Plans (ACP) under the Lead Bank Sc heme to ensure \nbetter implementation. The Controlling Offices of the banks in each state should \nsynchronize their internal business plans with the ACP under Lead Bank Scheme.  \n \niv. At present, discussions at the Q uarterly Meetings of the various LBS fora viz. State \nLevel Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC), District level Consultative Committee (DCC) and  \nBlock Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) primarily focuses on the performance of \nbanks in the disbursement of loans  vis-a-vis the allocated target under the Annual \nCredit Plan. The integrity & timeliness  of the data submitted by banks for the purpose \nhas been  an issue as a significant portion of this data is manually compiled and \nentered into the Data Management System s of the SLBC Convene r Banks. The \nextent to which this d ata corresponds with the data present in the CBS of the \nrespective banks also varies significantly. T herefore,  there is need of a standardized \nsystem to be developed on the website maintained by each SLBC to enable \nuploading and downloading of the data per taining to the Block, District as well as the \nState. The relevant data must also be directly downloadable from the CBS and/ or \nMIS of the banks with a view to keeping manual intervention  to a minimal  level in the \nprocess. The procedure relating to the envi saged intervention in this area is given in \nAnnex II. Necessary modifications may be made on the SLBC websites and to the \nCBS & MIS systems of all banks to implement the envisaged data flow mechanism. \n \nv. To strengthen the BLBC  forum  which  operates  at the base level of the Lead Bank  \nScheme,  it is necessary  that all branch managers  attend BLBC  meetings  and enrich \nthe discussions  with their valuable inputs. Controlling Heads  of banks  may also attend  \na few of the BLBC  meetings  selectively. \n  \n  \n \n3 \n \nvi. Rural Self Employment Training Institutes ( RSETIs ) should be more actively involved \nand monitored at various fora of LBS particularly at the DCC level. Focus should be \non development of skills to enhance the credit absorption capacity in the area and \nrenewing the training programmes towards sustainable micro enterprises. RSETIs \nshould design specific programmes for each district/ block , keeping in view the skill \nmapping and the potential of the r egion for necessary  skill training and skill up \ngradation of the rural youth in the district.  \n \n2. You are advised to initiate necessary action for implementation of the \u2018 action points \u2019 \nand also closely monitor the progress/ follow up by banks in this regar d. \n \n3. Please keep the respective Regional Office of the Reserve Bank of India informed of \nthe action taken in the matter. \n \n4.

Each bank\u2019s CBS should have a provision to generate a report pertaining to  all LBS \nrelated data/ tables to Excel. This data should have information pertaining to all the \nbranches operating in the state including fields/ columns for District & Block name. Access \nto Download & Expor t this data from bank CBS should be given to the Controlling Offices \nof the Banks who would be solely  responsible for the process of \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 for all \ndistricts/ blocks with in their jurisdiction.  \n \nii. The \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 process is the process of uploading this Excel file (downloaded in step \n(i) above)  on th e SLBC websites. SLBC Websites should have a provision to \u2018Import/ \nUpload\u2019 all the data present in the Excel Sheet on the database of the SLBC Website. This \nwould  obviate any manual \u2018data entry\u2019 at the SLBC/ Controlling Office level.  \n \niii. To facilitate the above functionality,  each SLBC Conv enor Bank would have to add this \n\u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 functionality to their SLBC website along with the requisite capabilities at \nthe back -end. \n \niv. The SLBC website would, thus, effectively work as a data aggregation platform. Further, \ndata analysis capabilities  could also be added to the SLBC websites depending on the \navailable resources.  \n \nv. The SLBC websites should provide access to LDMs to download district and block specific \ndata directly from this website thus ensuring integrity and timely availability of dat a. \n \nvi. There could still be some data pertaining to State Government Schemes/ other data that is \nnot available on the CBS  or MIS of the banks . This would have to be collated at the \nControlling Office level as is done now. At the SLBC website, functionalities could be \nprovided to enter this data too. This could then be downloaded by the LDMs for district/ \nblock level reports. Banks may also add Open Format fields like \u2018text boxes\u2019 for data or \ninformation that is special or is entered/ used once in a while.   \n \nvii. Such a system  ensures that LDMs & SLBC Convenor  Banks  have to do zero or minimal \ndata entry/ feeding and all data is entered by a single \u2018custodian of data\u2019 which is the \nControlling Office of each Bank. Any information to be provided by Government extension  \nagencies could also be similarly uploaded.  \n \n--------------------------------  ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NT155BE731510CD434C0CB4AD235D01A04B22.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Apr 06, 2018", "info": "  \n        \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\ufffd\u0915  \n          RESERVE BANK OF INDIA  \nwww.rbi.org.in  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\u092e\u0941\ufffd\u093e \ufffd\u092c\u0902\u0927 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917 , 4\u0925\u093e \u0924\u0932 , \u0905\u092e\u0930 \u092d\u0935\u0928 , \u092a\u0940.\u090f\u092e . \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d , \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 400001  \nDepartment of Currency Management, 4th Floor, Amar Building, P.M.

In recent times , there has been \nconsiderabl e growth in the payment ecosystem in the country.  Such systems are also highly \ntechnology dependent, which necessitate adoption of safety and security measures , which are best in \nclass, on a continuous basis.  \n \n2. It is observed that not all system providers  store the payments data in India. In order to ensure \nbetter  monitoring, it is  important to have unfettered supervisory access to data stored with these \nsystem  providers  as also with their service providers / intermediaries/ third party vendors and other \nentities in the payment ecosystem.  It has, therefore, b een decided  that: \ni. All system providers  shall ensure that the entire data relat ing to payment systems operated \nby them are stored in a system only in India.  This data should include the full end- to-end \ntransaction details / information collected / carried / processed as part of the message / \npayment instruction. For the foreign leg of t he transaction, if any, the data can also be \nstored in the foreign country, if required.  \nii. System providers shall ensure compliance of (i) above within a period of six months and \nreport compliance of the same to the Reserve Bank latest by Oct ober 15, 2018.  \niii. System providers  shall submit the System Audit Report (SAR) on completion of the \nrequirement at (i) above. The audit should be conducted by CERT -IN empaneled auditors  \ncertifying completion of activity at (i) above. The SAR duly approved by the Board of the \nsystem providers  should be submitted to the R eserve Bank not later than Dec ember  31, \n2018.  \n \n3.

The Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies , Fourth Bi -monthly \nMonetary Policy Statement, 2017- 18 proposed that a detailed review of current \nregulations on debt investment by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) shall be undertaken \nto facilitate the process of investment and hedging by FPIs. The regulatory changes \nwould be effective fro m April 2018. Accordingly, after consultation with the Government \nof India, the FPI limits are revised as below:  \n3. Revision of Investment  Limits \n(a) The limit for FPI investment in Central Government securities (G -secs) would be \nincreased by 0.5% each year to 5.5% of outstanding stock of securities in 2018-\n19 and 6% of outstanding stock of securities in 2019- 20.   \n(b) The limit for FPI investment in State Development Loans (SDLs) would remain \nunchanged at 2% of outstanding stock of securities.  \n(c) The overall limit for FPI investment in corporate bonds will be fixed at 9% of \noutstanding stock of corporate bonds.  All the existing sub- categories under the \ncategory of corporate bonds will be discontinued and there would be a single limit \nfor FPI investment in all types of corporate bonds.   \n \n2 \n \n(d) No fresh allocation has been made to the \u2018Long- term\u2019 sub -category under SDLs. \nOut of the existing limit of ` 13,600 crore for this sub- category, an amount of ` \n6,500 crore has been transferred to the G -secs category.  \n(e) The allocation of increase in G -sec limit over the two sub- categories \u2013 \u2018General\u2019 \nand \u2018Long- term\u2019 \u2013 remains at the current ratio of 25:75. However, based on an \nassessment of investment interest, this ratio has been re- set at 50:50 for the year \n2018- 19.  \n(f) Coupon reinvestment by FPIs in G -secs, which was hitherto outside the \ninvestment limit, will now be reckoned within the G -sec limits. FPIs may, \nhowever, continue to reinvest coupons without any constraint, as they do now. \nOnly at the tim e of periodic re- setting of limits, coupon investments would be \nadded to the amount of utilization. Accordingly, for the year 2018- 19, the stock of \ncoupon investment of ` 4,760 crore as on March 31, 2018, would be added to the \nactual utilization under the \u2018General\u2019 sub- category of G -secs. Since this is a new \npolicy, as a one- time measure, the investment limit in the \u2018General\u2019 sub- category \nof G -secs has been increased by an amount equal to the stock of coupon \nreinvestment as on March 31, 2018. This increase in limit on account of coupon \ninvestment amount is over and above the limit indicated in paragraph 3 (a). \n(g) This coupon reinvestment arrangement will be extended to other debt categories \nsubsequently.  \n(h) Accordingly, the revised limits for the various categories, after rounding off, would \nbe as under  (Table 1) : \nTable 1 - Revised Limits for FPI Investment in Debt - 2018 -19 (Rupees crore)  \n G-Sec -\nGeneral  G-Sec -\nLong Term  SDL -\nGeneral  SDL-Long \nTerm  Corporate \nBonds  Total \nDebt  \nCurrent Limit 191,300 65,100 31,500 13,600 244,323 545,823 \nRevised Limit \nfor the HY Apr -\nSep, 2018  207,300*  78,700 34,800 7,100 266,700 594,600 \nRevised Limit \nfor the HY Oct \n2018-March, \n2019  223,300*  92,300 38,100 7,100 289,100 649,900 \n* Includes `  4,760 crore one-time addition to limit to provide for inclusion of coupon \ninvestment amount in utilization.  \n  \n \n3 \n \n4. These directions would be applicable with immediate effect.  \n5. A separate notification will be issued announcing coupon reinvestment arrangements \nreferred to in paragraph 3 (g) and other changes affecting operational aspects of FPI \ninvestments in debt , in consultation with SEBI.  \n6.

In other words, serial number should be allotted in \nconsecutive order for each main scroll of March 2018  transactions sent from April 1 \nto April 1 0, 2018 .  These scrolls alongwith the copies of daily summary of Receipts \nand Payments prepared separately for March 2018  transactions will be forwarded to \nthe Departmental Officials concerned (i.e. Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and \nAccounts Officers and Designated Offic ers) in the usual way.  The Nodal/Focal Point \nbranches will also be required to report the above transactions to the Link Cell \nthrough separate Daily Memos . These advices must be sent to enable the Link Cell \nof each bank at Nagpur, to make daily settlement  with Reserve Bank of India, \nCentral Accounts Section (CAS)  Nagpur. On receipt of advices from the Nodal/Focal \nPoint branches, the Link Cell should segregate the advices for the March Residual \ntransactions and forward them separately to Reserve Bank of India, CAS, Nagpur . \nThis procedure should continue upto and inclusive of April 1 0, 2018  only.   All \ntransactions reported thereafter by the receiving branches will be reported and \naccounted for in the usual manner in the accounts of the month of report irrespective \nof the date of transaction.   Following the special arrangements for March 2018  \ntransactions, it is necessary for the Nodal/Focal Point branches to prepare two sets \nof DMS to be submitted to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers for \nMarch 2018  transactions - one for transactions upto March 31, 2018  and another for \nMarch Residual Transactions adjusted by Nodal/Focal Point branches with Reserve \nBank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur, during April 1 to April 1 0, 201 8.   \n  \nSince the Nodal/Focal Point branch will also be reporting the April 2018  transactions \npertaining to year 2018 -19 in addition to March Residual transactions, monthly \nstatement for April transactions should be compiled and furnished to Zonal Accounts \nOfficers /Pay and Accounts Officers in the usual way.   In order to distinguish the    \nApril 201 8 (year 2018 -19) and March Residual Transactions, the statement \npertaining to March Residual Transactions should be clearly marked as \"March \nResidual Account\".   The statement of March (Residual) Transactions should be sent \nby all F ocal Point Branches  to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers  \nlatest by April 18, 2018.    \n \nNote: As advised in our circular GA.NB.No.376/42.01.001/1995 -96 dated May 22, \n1996 all the cheques/amounts realized on or before March 31, 2018  should be \ntreated as transactions relating to the current financial year as \"March 201 8 or March \nResidual Transactions\", the reporting of which may take place during the month of \nApril (upto April 1 0, 2018 ).

However, Reserve \nBank continue s to receive complaints  about non -acceptance of coins by bank \nbranches. Such denial of service has reportedly, in turn, led to refusal on the part of \nshopkeepers and small  traders, etc., to accept coins as payment for goods sold and \nservices rendered causing  inconvenienc e to the public at large. You are, therefore, \nonce again advised to immediately direct all your branches to accept coins of all \ndenominations tendered at their counters either for exchange or for deposit in \naccounts.  \n2. We further advise that it will be preferable to accept coins, particularly, in the \ndenominations of `  1 and 2, by weighment. However, accepting coins  packed in \npolythene sachets of 100 each would perhaps be more convenient for the cashiers \nas well as the customers. Such polythene sachets may be kept at the counters and \nmade available to the customers. A notice to this effect may be displayed suitably \ninside as also outside the branch pr emises for information of the public.  \n3. In order to obviate the problems of storage of coins at the branches, coins  may be \nremitted to the currency chest s as per the existing procedure.

The Reserve Bank of India has issued various instructions aimed at resolution \nof stressed assets in the economy, including introduction of certain specific \nschemes at different points of  time. In view of the enactment of the Insolvency \nand Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), it has been decided to substitute the \nexisting guidelines with a harmonised and simplified generic framework for \nresolution of stressed assets. The details of the revised fr amework are \nelaborated in the following paragraphs.   \n \nI. Revised Framework  \n \nA. Early identification and  reporting of stress \n \n2. Lenders1 shall identify incipient stress in loan accounts , immediately  on \ndefault2, by classifying stressed assets as special mention ac counts (SMA) as \nper the following categories:  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 Lenders under these guidelines would generally include  all scheduled commercial banks  (excluding RRBs) \nand All India Financial Institutions, unles s specified otherwise . \n2 \u2018Default \u2019 means non -payment of debt when whole or any part or instalment of the amount of debt has become \ndue and payable and is not repaid by the debtor or the corporate debtor, as the case may be .  \nFor revolving facilities like c ash credit, default would also mean, without prejudice to the above, the  \noutstanding balance remaining  continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit  or drawing power , whichever is \nlower,  for more than 3 0 days . 2 \n \n \n SMA Sub -categories  Basis for classification  \u2013 \n Principal or interest payment or any other \namount wholly or partly overdue between  \nSMA -0 1-30 days  \nSMA -1 31-60 days  \nSMA -2 61-90 days  \n \n3. As provided in terms of  the circular DBS.OSMOS.No.14703/33.01.001/2013 -\n14 dated May 22, 2014  and subsequent amendments  thereto, lenders shall \nreport credit information, including classification of an account as SMA to \nCentral Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC)  on all borrower  \nentities  having aggregate exposure3 of ` 50 million and above with them. The  \nCRILC- Main Report will now be required to be submitted on a monthly  basis  \neffecti ve April 1, 2018. In addition, the lenders shall report  to CRILC,  all \nborrower entities  in default  (with aggregate exposure of ` 50 million and \nabove) , on a weekly basis , at the close of business on every Friday, or the \npreceding working day if Friday happens to be a holiday. The first such \nweekly report shall be submitted for the week ending February 23, 2018.  \n \nB. Implementation of Resolution Plan \n \n4. All lenders  must put in place Board- approved policies for resolution of \nstressed assets under this framework , including the timelines  for resolution . \nAs soon as there is a default in the borrower  entity\u2019s account  with any lender , \nall lenders  \u2212 singly or jointly  \u2212 shall initiate steps to cure the default . The \nresolution plan (RP)  may involve any actions / plans / reorganization \ninclud ing, but not limited to, regularisation of the account by payment of all \nover dues by the borrower entity, sale of the exposures to other entities  / \ninvestors , change in ownership, or restructuring4. The RP shall  be clearly \n                                                 \n3 Aggregate exposure under the guidelines wou ld include all fund based and non- fund based exposure  with the \nlenders .  \n4 Restructuring is an act in which a lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial \ndifficulty  (An illustrative non -exhaustive list of indicators of financ ial difficulty are given in the Appendix to \nAnnex -I), grants concessions to the borrower. Restructuring would normally involve modification of terms of \nthe advances / securities, which may include, among others, alteration of repayment period / repayable a mount  / \nthe amount of instalments / rate of interest ; roll over of credit facilities ; sanction of additional credit facility ; \nenhancement of existing credit limits ; and, compromise settlements where time for payment of settlement \namount exceeds three months.  \n 3 \n \n \n documented by all the lenders ( even if  there is no change in any terms and \nconditions ).  \n \nC. Implementation Conditions for RP  \n5. A RP in respect of borrower  entities  to whom the lenders continue to have \ncredit exposure, shall be deemed to be \u2018implemented\u2019  only if the following \nconditions are met:  \na. the borrower  entity  is no longer in default  with any of the lenders ;  \nb. if the resolution involves restructuri ng; then \ni. all related documentation, including execution of necessary \nagreements between lenders and borrower  / creation of security \ncharge / perfection of securities are completed by all lenders; \nand \nii. the new capital structure and/or  changes in the terms of  \nconditions of the existing loans get duly reflected in the books of \nall the lenders and the borrower.  \n \n6. Additionally, RPs involving restructuring / change in ownership in respect of \n\u2018large \u2019 accounts (i.e., accounts where the aggregate exposure of lenders is ` 1 \nbillion and above) , shall require independent credit evaluation (ICE) of the \nresidual debt5 by credit rating agencies (CRA s) specifically authorised by the \nReserve Bank for this  purpose. While accounts with aggregate exposure of ` \n5 billion and abov e shall require two such ICEs, others shall require one ICE. \nOnly such RPs which receive a credit opinion of RP46 or better for the \nresidual debt from one or two CRAs, as the case may be, shall be considered \nfor implement ation . Further, ICEs shall be subject to the following:  \n \n(a) The CRAs shall be directly engaged by the lenders and the payment of \nfee for such assignments shall be made by the lenders.  \n                                                 \n5 The residual debt of the borrower entity , in this context , mean s the aggregate debt (fund based as well as non -\nfund based) envisaged to be held by all the lenders as per the proposed RP.  \n \n6 Annex \u2013 2 provides list of RP symbols  that can be provided by CRAs as ICE  and their meanings . 4 \n \n \n (b) If lenders obtain ICE from more than the required number of CRAs, all \nsuch ICE opinions shall be RP4 or better for the RP to be considered \nfor implementation.  \n  \n7. The above requirement of ICE shall be applicable to  restructuring of all large \naccounts implemented from the date of this circular, even if the restructuring \nis carried out before the \u2018reference date\u2019 sti pulated in paragraph 8 below.   \n \nD.  Timelines for Large Accounts to be Referred under IBC  \n \n8. In respect of  accounts with aggregate exposure of the lenders at ` 20 billion \nand above, on or after March 1, 2018 ( \u2018reference date\u2019 ), including accounts \nwhere resolut ion may have been initiated under any of the existing schemes  \nas well as  accounts classified as restructured standard assets  which are \ncurrently in respective specified periods (as per the previous  guidelines ), RP \nshall be implemented as per the following timelines:  \n \ni) If in default as on the reference date, then 180 days from the \nreference date.  \nii) If in default after the reference date, then 180 days from the date of \nfirst such default.  \n \n9. If a RP in respect of such large accounts  is not implemented as per the \ntimelines specified in  paragraph 8, lenders shall file insolvency application, \nsingly or jointly, under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC)7 within \n15 days from the expiry of the said timeline8.   \n \n10. In respect of such large accounts,  where a RP involving restructuring/change \nin ownership is  implemented within the 180- day period, the account should  \nnot be in default at any point of time during the \u2018specified period\u2019, failing which \n                                                 \n7 Applicable in respect of entities notified under IBC.  \n8 The prescribed timelines are the upper limits. Lenders are free to file insolvency petition s under the IBC  \nagainst borrowers even before the expiry of the timeline s, or even without attempting a RP outside IBC.  5 \n \n \n the lenders shall file an insolvency application, singl y or jointly, under the IBC \nwithin 15 days from the date of such default .  \n \n\u2018Specified period \u2019 means the period from the date of implementation of \nRP up to the date by which at least 20 percent of the outstanding principal \ndebt as per the RP and interest capitalisation s anctioned as part of the \nrestructuring, if any, is repaid.  \nProvided that the specified period cannot end before one year from the \ncommencement of the first payment of interest or principal  (whichever is later ) \non the credit facility with longest period of moratorium under the terms of RP.   \n \n11. Any default  in payment  after the expiry  of the specified  period shall be \nreckoned as a fresh  default  for the purpose of this framework.  \n \n12. For other accounts with aggregate exposure of the lenders below ` 20 billion \nand, at or above ` 1 billion, the Reserve Bank intends to announce,  over a \ntwo-year period, reference dates for implementing the RP to ensure \ncalibrated, time- bound resolution of all such accounts in default.  \n \n13. It is, however, clarified that the said transition arrangement shall not be \navailable for borrower entities in respect of which specific instructions have \nalready been issued by the Reserve Bank to the banks for reference under \nIBC. Lenders shall continue to pursue such cases as per the earlier \ninstructions . \n \nE. Prudential Norms  \n \n14. The revised  prudential norms applicable to any restructuring, whether under \nthe IBC framework or outside the IBC, are contained in Annex- 19. The \nprovisioning in respect of exposure to borrower entities against whom \ninsolvency applicat ions are filed under the IBC shall be as per their asset \nclassification  in terms of the Master Circular on Prudential norms on Income  \n                                                 \n9 During the period when the RP is being finalised and implemented, the usual asset classification norms would \ncontinue to apply. The process of re -classification of an asset should not stop merely because R P is under \nconsideration.  6 \n \n \n Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning, as amended from time to \ntime.10 \n \nII. Supervisory Review    \n15. Any failure on t he part of lenders in meeting the prescribed timelines or any \nactions by lenders with an intent to conceal the actual status of accounts or \nevergreen the stressed  accounts, will be subjected to stringent supervisory  / \nenforcement  actions as deemed appropri ate by the Reserve Bank , including , \nbut not limited to,  higher provisioning on such accounts  and monetary \npenalties11.  \n \nIII. Disclosures \n16. Banks shall make appropriate disclosures in their financial statements , under \n\u2018Notes on Accounts \u2019, relating to resolution pl ans implemented. Detailed \nguidelines will be issued separately.  \n \nIV. Exceptions  \n17. Restructuring in respect of projects under implementation involving deferment \nof date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO), shall continue \nto be covered under the guidelines contained at paragraph 4.2.15 of the \nMaster Circular No. DBR.No.BP.BC.2/21.04.048/2015- 16 dated July 1, 2015  \non \u2018Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Clas sification and \nProvisioning pertaining to Advances \u2019.  \n \nV. Withdrawal of extant instructions \n18. The extant instructions on resolution of stressed assets such as Framework \nfor Revitalising Distressed  Assets, Corporate Debt Restructuring Scheme, \nFlexible Structurin g of Existing Long Term Project Loans, Strategic Debt \nRestructuring Scheme (SDR), C hange in O wnership outside SDR, and \nScheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A)  stand \nwithdrawn with immediate effect. Accordingly, t he Joint Lenders\u2019 Forum (JLF) \n                                                 \n10Accounts in respect of which banks have already been specifically issued instructions to initiate insolvency \nresolution proceedings under the IBC, minimum provisions as already advised shall be maintained.  \n11 This may be in additi on to direction to banks to file insolvency application under the Insolvency and \nbankruptcy Code 2016.  7 \n \n \n as an institutional mechanism for resolution of stressed accounts also stand s \ndiscontinued.  All accounts , including such accounts  where any of the \nschemes have been invoked but not yet implemented, shall be governed by \nthe revised framework.  \n \n19. The li st of circulars/ directions /guidelines subsumed in this circular and thereby \nstand repealed from the date of this circular is given in Annex - 3. \n \n20. The above guidelines are issued in exercise of pow ers conferred under \nSection 35A, 35AA (read with S.O.1435 (E) dated May 5, 2017 issued by the \nGovernment of India) and 35A B of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; and, \nSection 45(L) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  \n \n \nYours faithfully,  \n \n \n(Saurav Sinha)  \nChief General Manager -in-Charge   \n \n Annex \u2013 1 \nNorms Applicable  to Restructuring \n \n1. Restructuring is an act in which a lender, for economic or legal reasons relating \nto the borrower's financial difficulty12, grants concessions to the borrower. \nRestructuring would normally involve modification of terms of the advances /  \nsecurities, which would generally include, among others, alteration of repayment \nperiod / repayable amount / the amount of instalments / rate of interest / roll over \nof credit facilities / sanction of additional credit facility / enhancement of existing \ncredit limits / compromise settlements where time for payment of settlement \namount exceeds three months.  \n \nI. Prudential Norms13  \nA. Asset Classification  \n2. In case of restructuring, the accounts classified as 'standard' shall be \nimmediately downgraded as non- perform ing assets (NPAs), i.e., \u2018sub -standard\u2019 \nto begin with. The non- performing assets, upon restructuring, would continue to \nhave the same asset classification as prior to restructuring. In both cases, the \nasset classification shall continue to be governed by t he ageing criteria as per \nextant asset classification norms.  \n \nB. Conditions for Upgrade  \n3. Standard accounts classified as NPA and NPA accounts retained in the same \ncategory on restructuring by the lenders  may be upgraded only when all the \noutstanding loan / facilities  in the account demonstrate \u2018satisfactory performance\u2019 \n(i.e., the payments in respect of borrower  entity are not in default at any point of \ntime) during the \u2018specified period\u2019 (as defined in paragraph 10 of the covering \ncircular)14.  \n \n                                                 \n12 An illustrative (but not exhaustive) list of indicators of financial difficulty are in Appendix.  \n13 Applicable to all resolution plans, including those undertaken under IBC.  \n14 For accounts under IBC, the specified period shall be deemed to commence from the date of implementation \nof the resolution plan as approved by the Adjudicating Authority.  2 \n \n \n 4.  For the large accounts (i.e., accounts where the aggregate exposure of lenders \nis ` 1 billion and above) to qualify for an upgrade, in addition to demonstration of \nsatisfactory performance, the credit facilities of the borrower shall also be rated \nas investment grade15 (BBB-  or better) as at the end of the \u2018specified period\u2019  by \nCRAs accredited by the Reserve Bank for the purpose of bank loan ratings. \nWhile accounts with aggregate exposure of ` 5 billion and above shall require \ntwo ratings, those below ` 5 billion shall require one rating. If the ratings are \nobtained from more than the required number of CRAs, all such ratings shall be \ninvestment grade to qualify for an upgrade.  \n \n5. In case satisfactory performance during the specified period is not demonstrated, \nthe account s hall, immediately on such default, be reclassified as per the \nrepayment schedule that existed before the restructuring16. Any future upgrade \nfor such accounts shall be contingent on implementation of a fresh RP and \ndemonstration of satisfactory performance thereafter.  \n \nC. Provisioning Norms   \n6. Accounts restructured under the revised framework shall attract provisioning as \nper the asset classification category as laid out in the Master Circular on \nPrudential Norms on Income  Recognition, Asset Classification and Pr ovisioning \npertaining to Advances  dated July 1, 2015, as amended from time to time. \nHowever, the provisions made in respect of accounts restructured before the \ndate of the circular under any of the earlier schemes shall continue to be held as \nper the requi rements specified therein.  \n \nD. Additional Finance \n7. Any additional finance approved under the RP  (including any resolution plan \napproved by the Adjudicating Authority under IBC) may be treated as 'standard \nasset' during the specified period under the approved RP, provided the account \nperforms satisfactorily (as defined in paragraphs 3-5 above) during the specified \nperiod. If the restructured asset fails to perform satisfactorily during the specified \n                                                 \n15 These ratings shall be the normal ratings provided by the CRAs and not ICEs referred to in paragraph 6 of the \ncovering circular.  \n16 For large accounts, this will be in a ddition to mandatory IBC filing . 3 \n \n \n period or does not qualify for upgradation at the end of the s pecified period, the \nadditional finance shall be placed in the same asset classification category as \nthe restructured debt.  \n \nE. Income recognition norms \n8. Interest income in respect of restructured accounts classified as 'standard \nassets' may be recognized on accrual basis and that in respect of the \nrestructured accounts classified  as 'non- performing assets' shall be recognised \non cash basis.  \n \n9. In the case of additional finance in accounts where the pre- restructuring facilities \nwere classified as NPA, the inter est income shall be recognised only on cash \nbasis except when the restructuring is accompanied by a change in ownership.  \n \nF. Conversion of Principal into Debt / Equity and Unpaid Interest into \n'Funded Interest Term Loan' (FITL), Debt or Equity Instruments \n \n10. The FITL / debt / equity instruments created by conversion of part of principal / \nunpaid interest, as the case may be, will be placed in the same asset \nclassification category in which the restructured advance has been classified.  \n \n11. These instruments  shall be valued as per usual valuation norms and marked to \nmarket. Equity instruments, whether classified as standard or NPA, shall be \nvalued at market value, if quoted, or else at break -up value (without considering \nthe revaluation reserve, if any) as ascertained from the company's balance sheet  \nas on  March 31st of the immediate preceding financial year. In case balance \nsheet as on March 31st of the immediate preceding financial year is not available, \nthe entire portfolio of equity shares of the company held by the bank shall be \nvalued at Re.1. Depreciation on these instruments shall not be offset against the \nappreciation in any other securities held under the AFS category.  \n \n12. The unrealised income represented by FITL / Debt or equity instrument can only \nbe recognised in the profit and loss account as under:  \na. FITL/debt instruments: only on sale or redemption, as the case may be;  4 \n \n \n b. Unquoted equity/  quoted equity (where classified as NPA): only on \nsale;  \nc. Quoted equity (where classified as standard): market value of the \nequity as on the date of upgradation, not exceeding the amount of \nunrealised income converted to such equity.  Subsequent changes to \nvalue of the equity will be dealt as per the extant prudential norms on \ninvestment portfolio of banks.  \n \nG. Change in Ownership  \n \n13. In case of change in ownership of the borrowing entities, credit facilities of the \nconcerned borrowing entities may be continued/upgraded as \u2018standard\u2019 after the \nchange in ownership is implemented, either under the IBC or  under this \nframework. If the ch ange in ownership is implemented under this framework, \nthen the classification as \u2018standard, shall be subject to the following conditions:  \ni) Banks shall conduct necessary due diligence in this regard and \nclearly establish that the acquirer is not a person di squalified in \nterms of Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, \n2016.   \nii) The new promoter shall have acquired at least 26 per cent of the \npaid up equity capital of the borrower entity and shall be the \nsingle largest shareholder of the borrower ent ity.  \niii) The new promoter shall be in \u2018control\u2019 of the borrower entity as \nper the definition of \u2018control\u2019 in the Companies Act 2013 / \nregulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of \nIndia/any other applicable regulations  / accounting standards as \nthe case may be.  \niv) The conditions for implementation of RP as per Section I -C of \nthe covering circular are complied with.  \n \n14. For such accounts to continue to be classified as standard, all the outstanding \nloans/credit facilities of the borrowing entity need to demonstrate satisfactory \nperformance (as defined above in paragraph 3 above) during the specified \nperiod. If the account fails to perform satisfactorily at any point of time during the \nspecified period, the credit facilities shall be immediately downgraded as non-5 \n \n \n performing assets (NPAs) i.e., \u2018sub -standard\u2019. Any future upgrade for such \naccounts shall be contingent on implementation of a fresh RP (either under IBC, \nwherever mandatory filings are applicable or initiated voluntarily by the lenders, \nor outside IBC) and demonstration of satisfactory performance thereafter.  \n \n15. Further, the quantum of provisions held by the bank against the said account as \non the date of change in ownership of the borrowing entities can  be reversed \nonly after satisfactory performance during the specified period.  \n \nII. Principles on classification of sale and lease back transactions as \nrestructuring \n \n16. A sale and leaseback transaction of the assets of a borrower or other \ntransactions of similar  nature will be treated as an event of restructuring for the \npurpose of asset classification  and provisioning in the books of banks with \nregard to the residual debt of the seller as well as the debt of the buyer if all the \nfollowing conditions are met:  \n(i) The seller of the assets is in financial difficult y; \n(ii) Significant portion, i.e. more than 50 per cent, of the revenues of the \nbuyer from the specific asset is dependent upon the cash flows from the \nseller;  \n(iii)  25 per cent or more of the loans availed by the buyer for the purchase of \nthe specific asset is funded by the lenders who already have a credit \nexposure to the seller.  \n \nIII. Prudential Norms relating to Refinancing of Exposures to Borrowers \nin different currency  \n17. If foreign currency borrowings/export advances for the purpose of \nrepayment/ refinancing  of rupee l oans are obtained from:  \na. lenders who are part of Indian banking system (where permitted); or  \nb. with support (where permitted) from the Indian banking system in the \nform of Guarantees/Standby Letters of Credit/Letters of Comfort, etc.,  \nsuch events shall be t reated as \u2018restructuring\u2019 if the borrower concerned is under \nfinancial difficulty.  \n 6 \n \n \n 18. Similarly, rupee loans for repayment/refinancing of foreign currency \nborrowings/export advances will also be treated as \u2018restructuring\u2019 if such rupee \nloans are extended to a borrower who is under financial difficulty.  \n \n \n \nIV. Regulatory Exemptions  \n \nExemptions from  RBI Regulations \n19. Acquisition of non- SLR securities by way of conversion of debt is exempted from \nthe restrictions and the prudential limit on investment in unlisted non -SLR \nsecurities prescribed by the RBI.  \n \n20. Acquisition of shares due to conversion of debt to equity during a restructuring \nprocess will be exempted from regulatory ceilings/restrictions on Capital Market \nExposures, investment in Para -Banking activities and intra-group exposure. \nHowever, these will require reporting to RBI (reporting to DBS, CO every month \nalong with the regular DSB Return on Asset Quality) and disclosure by banks in \nthe Notes to Accounts in Annual Financial Statements. Nonetheless, banks wi ll \nhave to comply with the provisions of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation \nAct, 1949.  \n \nExemptions from  Regulations of Securities and Exchange Board of India \n(SEBI)  \n21. SEBI has provided exemptions , under certain conditions, from the requirements \nof Secur ities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Issue of Capital and \nDisclosure Requirements) (ICDR) Regulations , 2009 as well as SEBI \n(Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) (SAST) Regulations, 2011 for \nrestructurings carried out as per the regulations issued by the Reserve Bank.  \n \n22. With reference to the requirements contained in sub -regulations 70 (5) (a) and \n70 (6) (a) of ICDR Regulations, 2009,  the issue price of the equity shall be the  \nlower of   (i) or (ii) below:  \n(i) The average of the weekly high and low of the volume weighted average \nprice of the related equity shares quoted on the recognised stock 7 \n \n \n exchange during the twenty six weeks preceding the \u2018reference date\u2019 or \nthe average of the weekly high and low of the volume weighted average \nprices of the related equity shares quoted on a recognised stock \nexchange during the two weeks preceding the \u2018reference date\u2019, whichever \nis lower; and \n(ii) Book value: Book value per share to be calculated from the audited \nbalance sheet  as on March 31st of the immediate preceding financial year   \n(without considering 'revaluation reserves', if any) adjusted for cash flows \nand financials post the earlier restructuring, if any. The balance sheet \nshall not be more than a year old. In case the audited balance sheet  as \non March 31st of the immediate preceding financial year  is not available \nthe total book value of the borrower company shall be reckoned at Re.1.  \n \n23. In the case of conversion of debt into equities, the \u2018reference date\u2019 shall be the \ndate on which  the bank approves  the restructuring  scheme. In the case of \nconversion of convertible securities into equities, the \u2018reference date\u2019 shall be the \ndate on which the bank approves the conversion of the convertible securities into \nequities. In case of issuance of fresh shares to the new promoter, the \u2018reference \ndate\u2019 shall be the date of signing of the binding agreement between the bank and \nthe new promoter.  \n \n24. With reference to the requirements contained in sub- regulations 10 (1) (ia) (a) of \nthe SAST Regulations , 2001, at the time of s elling the equity instruments \nacquired by banks (as part of a restructuring exercise) in favour of a new \npromoter, the selling price may be a negotiated price. However, the selling price \nshall not be lower than the \u2018fair value\u2019, which shall be the higher of (i) and (ii) \nbelow:  \n \n(i) The average of the weekly high and low of the volume weighted average \nprice of the related equity shares quoted on the recognised stock \nexchange during the twenty six weeks preceding the \u2018reference date\u2019 or \nthe average of the weekly high and low of the volume weighted average \nprices of the related equity shares quoted on a recognised stock 8 \n \n \n exchange during the two weeks preceding the \u2018reference date\u2019, whichever \nis higher; and \n(ii) Book value: Book value per share to be calculated from the c ompany's \nlatest audited balance sheet (without considering 'revaluation reserves', if \nany) adjusted for cash flows and financials post the earlier restructuring, if \nany.  \n \n25. In case  of sale of equity held by banks as a result of conversion/invocation of \npledge, the \u2018reference date\u2019  shall be the date on which the share purchase \nagreement between the bank and the new promoter is executed.  \n \nV. Non-applicability of these guidelines   \n26. The revival  and rehabilitation of MSMEs as defined under \u2018The Micro, Small and \nMedium Enterprises Development Act, 2006\u2019  shall continue to be guided by the \ninstructions  contained in Circular No. FIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.21/  06.02.31/  \n2015- 16 dated March 17, 2016 , as amended from time to time.  \n \n27. Restructuring of loans in the event of a natural calamity shall continue to be as \nper the directions contained in the Master Direction s FIDD.CO.FSD.BC \nNo.8/05.10.001/2017- 18, as amended from time to time.  \n \nVI. Cases of frauds/ wilful  defaulters.  \n28. Borrowers who have committed frauds/ malfeasance/ wilful default will remain \nineligible for restructuring. However, in cases where the existing promoters are \nreplaced by new promoters, and the borrower company is totally delinked from \nsuch erstwhile promoters/management,  lenders may take a view on \nrestructuring such accounts based on their viability, without prejudice to the \ncontinuance of criminal action against the erstwhile promoters/management.  \n \n  9 \n \n \n Appendix  \nNon \u2013 Exhaustive Indicative List of Signs of Financial Difficulty \n \n\u2022 Irregularities in cash credit/overdraft accounts such as inability to maintain \nstipulated margin basis or drawings exceeding sanctioned limits, periodic \ninterest debited remaining unrealised;  \n \n\u2022 Failure/anticipated failure to make timely payment of instalments of principal \nand interest on term loans;  \n \n\u2022 Delay in meeting commitments towards payments of installments due, \ncrystallized liabilities under LC/BGs, etc.  \n \n\u2022 Excessive leverage;  \n \n\u2022 Inability to adhere to financial loan covenants;  \n \n\u2022 Failure to pay statutory liabilities, non-  payment of bills to operational \ncreditors, etc.;  \n \n\u2022 Non-submission or undue delay in submission or submission of  incorrect \nstock statements and other control statements, delay in publication of financial \nstatements and adversely qualified financial statements;  \n \n\u2022 Steep decline in production figures, downward trends in sales and fall in \nprofits, margin erosion etc.;  \n \n\u2022 Elongation of working capital cycle, excessive inventory build- up; \n \n\u2022 Significant delay in project implementation;  \n \n\u2022 Downward migration of internal/external ratings/rating outlook.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 \n \n \n Annex \u2013 2 \n \nICE \nSymbols  Definition  \nRP1 Debt  facilities/instruments  with this symbol  are considered  to have  \nthe highest  degree of safety  regarding timely  servicing  of financial  \nobligations.

For risk weighting \npurposes under the Capital Adequacy Framework, the \nextant regulator y guidelines will be applicable.  \n2 Personal loans  Personal loans refer s to loans given to individuals and \nconsist of (a) consumer credit, (b) education loan, (c) \nloans given for creation/ enhancement of immovable \nassets (e.g., housing, etc.), and (d) loans given for \ninvestment in financial assets (shares, debentures, etc.).  \n3 Funded Credit  Funded credit implies amount actually lent or credited to \na borrower's account or debited to borrower's loan/ cash \ncredit/ overdraft or any other borrowing account for \npayment on behalf of the borrower.  \n4 Weighted \nAverage Lending \nRate  Weighted average lending rate (WALR) relates to all \ntypes of rupee credit accounts (viz., cash credit, demand \nloans, overdrafts, inland bills financed and discounted, 3 \nterm loans and other types, if any). The amount of loans \nunder each credit account is mul tiplied with its \ncorresponding interest rates (usually, it is done \nindividual account -wise under each type of credit \naccount) and then, added together. This sum of all \nproducts is then divided by the total amount of loans to \narrive at WALR.  \n5 Pre-shipment  \nCredit  Pre-shipment credit means any loan or advance granted \nor any other credit provided by a bank to an exporter for \nfinancing the purchase, processing, manufacturing or \npacking of goods prior to shipment / working capital \nexpenses towards rendering of services on the basis of letter of credit opened in his favour or in favour of some other person, by an overseas buyer or a confirmed and irrevocable order for the export of goods / services from India or any other evidence of an order for export from India having been placed on the exporter or some other \nperson, unless lodgement of export orders or letter of \ncredit with the bank has been waived.  \n6 Take -out \nFinance/ Conditional Take- out \nFinance  Take -out finance is an arrangement where an institution \n/ bank , financing infrastructure projects, will have an \narrangement with any financial institution for transferring to the latter, the outstanding in respect of such financing in their books on a pre-\ndetermined basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nConditional take- out finance: In this scenario, the taking \nover institution would have stipulated certain conditions \nto be satisfied by the borrower before it is taken over \nfrom the lending institution.  \n7 Unsecured \nGuarantees  Unsecured guarantees are those which are not secured \nby any collateral. Limit on the amount of unsecured \nguarantees is fixed by a bank's board.    \n8 Slippage  Slippage refers to new accretion to NPAs during a \nperiod.     4 \n9 Standard \nAdvances  Standard advan ce is an advance which is not non -\nperforming as per extant IRAC and provisioning norms.  \n10 Substandard \nAdvances  A substandard advance is one, which remains non -\nperforming for a period less than or equal to 12 months.  \n11 Doubtful \nAdvances  An advance which  remains in the substandard category \nfor a period of 12 months.  \n12 Restructured \nAccounts  A restructured account is one where the bank, for \neconomic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's \nfinancial difficulty, grants to the borrower, concessions \nthat the bank would not otherwise consider. \nRestructuring would normally involve modification of \nterms of the advances / securities, which would \ngenerally include, among others, alteration of repayment \nperiod / repayable amount/ the amount of instalments / rate \nof interest (due to reasons other than competitive \nreasons). However, extension in repayment tenure of a floating rate loan on reset of interest rate, so as to keep \nthe equated monthly instalment (EMI) unchanged, \nprovided it is applied to a class of accou nts uniformly, \nwill not render the account to be classified as \n\u2018Restructured account\u2019. In other words, extension or \ndeferment of EMIs to individual borrowers as against to \nan entire class, would render the accounts to be \nclassified as 'restructured account s\u2019. \n13 Restructured \nStandard Advances  Restructured standard advances are the advances \nrestructured/ permitted to be classified as standard, as \nper extant DBR instructions.  \n14 Mortgage -\nbacked Security  A Mortgage -backed security is a bond -type security in \nwhich the collateral is provided by a pool of mortgages.
