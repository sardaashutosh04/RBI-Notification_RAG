While no doubt, such instances occur due to non-\nadherence to operational guidelines, the fact remains that existing guidelines do not contain anything to\nprovide relief to the persons actually trapped.\n2. The matter was examined and it is suggested that the following measures/course of action may be\ntaken by the banks when customers visit for operating the safe deposit lockers:\ni) The procedure of recording check-in and check-out time by the customer should be introduced\nby those bank's branches which are not following such a procedure at present, and\nii) The custodian of the locker room should carry out a physical check of the locker room at the\nend of the day to ensure that no customer is inadvertently trapped in the locker room after\nbanking hours. This should be made compulsory and part of the operating instructions.\n3. We request you to take all necessary steps to avoid mishap of the type indicated in branches having\nsafe deposit locker facilities.\n4. You may also consider the possibility of linking up the locker room with a near-by Police Station\nthrough a telephone connection which does not need power supply.\nPlease acknowledge receipt to our concerned Regional Office.\nYours faithfully,\nSd/-\n(AVINASH MISRA)\nGeneral Manager", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/OSDCC10091996.PDF"}]
