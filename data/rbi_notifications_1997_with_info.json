As this is likely \nto mislead the customers, the banks should in any  advertisement and literature soliciting deposits \nindicate the simple rate of interest per annum for the period of the deposit.  \n2. The banks are advised to follow these instructions scrupulously.  \n3. Please acknowledge receipt to the concerned Regional Office.  \nYours faithfully,  \nSd/- \n(Y.S.P. THORAT) \nAddl.
