It is observed that a number  of RBI Regulated Entities (RREs) manage their ATM Switch \necosystem through shared services of third par ty ATM Switch Application Service Providers  \n(ASPs). Since these service providers also have exposure to the payment system landscape, \nit is felt that some cyber security controls are required to be put in place by them . In view of \nthis, the RREs shall ensure that t he contract agreement signed between them  and the third \nparty ATM Switch ASP shall necessarily mandate the third party ATM Switch ASP to comply \nwith the cyber security controls  given in the Annex  on an ongoing basis and to provide access \nto the RBI for on-site/off-site supervision.  To this effect, t he contract agreements shall be \namended at the earliest or at the time of renewal , in any case not later than March 31, \n2020. The list of prescribed controls is indicative but not exhaustive. It may be mentioned that \nthese controls are applicable to the ASPs  limited to the IT ecosystem (such as physical \ninfrastructure, hardware, software, reconciliation system , network interfaces , security \nsolutions, hardware security module, middleware, associated people, processes, systems, \ndata, information, etc.,) providing ATM switch services as well as any other type of payment \nsystem related services to the RREs .   \n3.  The regulatory instructions issued from time to time in terms of circulars/advisories/alerts, \nas applicable to the ATM switch ecosystem  shall be shared with the ASPs for necessary \ncompliance.    \n4.

Baseline Cyber Security Controls for ATM Switch application service providers of \nRBI regulated entities \nA number of commercial banks, urban cooperative banks and other regulated entities are \ndependent upon third party application service providers for shared services for ATM Switch \napplications. Since these service providers also have exposure to the payment system \nlandscape and are, therefore, exposed to the associated cyber threats, it has been decided \nthat certain baseline cyber security controls shall be mandated by the regulated entities in their \ncontractual agreements with these service providers. The guidelines would require \nimplementation of several  measures to strengthen the process of deployment and changes in \napplication softwares in the ecosystem; continuous surveillance; implementation of controls \non storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data; building capacity for forensic \nexaminati on; and making the incident response mechanism more robust. Detailed guidelines \nin this regard will be issued by December 31, 2019.  \n  \n \nAnnex \nCyber Security Controls for ATM Switch Application Service Providers (ASPs)  \n1.

All UCBs shall comply with the control requirements prescribed in Annex I  within 3 months \nfrom the date of issuance of this circular. Similarly, Level II, III and IV UCBs  are required to \nimplement additional controls prescribed in Annex \u2013II, III and IV respectively.   \n6. UCBs may adopt higher level of security measures based on their own assessment of risk \nand capabilities. Further, if a UCB , irrespective of its asset size already has a dedicated CISO \nand/or governance framework  as discussed in Annex IV, then as a matter of best practice, it \nis desirable that it continues with the existing governance structure.  \n7.

Comprehensive Cyber Security Framework for Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks \n(UCBs) \u2013 A Graded Approach \nThe Reserve Bank had prescribed a set of baseline cyber security controls for primary (Urban) \ncooperative banks (UCBs) in October 2018. On further examination, it has been decided to \nprescribe a comprehensive cyber security framework for the UCBs, as a graded approach, \nbased on their digital depth and interconnectedness with the payment systems landscape, \ndigital products offered by them and assessment of cyber security risk. The framework would \nmandate implementation of progressively stronger security meas ures based on the nature, \nvariety and scale of digital product offerings of banks. Such measures would, among others, \ninclude implementation of bank specific email domain; periodic security assessment of public \nfacing websites/applications; strengthening t he cybersecurity incident reporting mechanism; \nstrengthening of governance framework; and setting up of Security Operations Center (SOC). \nThis would bolster cyber security preparedness and ensure that the UCBs offering a range of \npayment services and higher Information Technology penetration are brought at par with \ncommercial banks in addressing cyber security threats.  Detailed guidelines in this regard will \nbe issued by December 31, 2019.  \n  Comprehensive Cyber Security Framework for Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs) \u2013  A Graded Approach  \n \ni \n Annex I  \nBaseline Cyber Security and Resilience Requirements -  Level I  \nThe basic cyber security controls prescribed vide RBI Circular DCBS.CO.PCB.Cir.No.1/ \n18.01.000/2018- 19 dated October 19, 2018  remain valid except  for the requirement to submit \na quarterly \u2018NIL\u2019 report in case of no cyber security incidents.  The need for such quarterly \nsubmission has been dispensed with.

Steps for setting up C -SOC \u2013 Technological Aspects  \ni. First step is to arrive at a suitable and cost effective technology framework \ndesigned and implemented to ensure proactive monitoring capabilities aligned \nwith the banking technology risk profile and business and regulatory \nrequirements. Clear understanding of the service delivery architecture deployed \nby the UCB will enable identification of the location for the sensors to collect the \nlogs that are required to carry out the analysis and investigation. SIEM is able to \nmeet this requirement to some extent but a holistic approach to problem \nidentification and solution is required.  \nii. Second step is to have a security analytics engine which can process the logs \nwithin reasonable time frame and come out with possible recommendations with \noptions for further deep dive investigations  \niii. Third step is to look at deep packet inspection approaches  \niv. Fourth step is to have tools and technologies for malware detection and analysis \nas well as imaging solutions for data to address the forensics requirements  Comprehensive Cyber Security Framework for Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs) \u2013  A Graded Approach  \n \nvii \n v.

As a risk management measure, all participant entities  should start using the facility \nand put it to good use.  \n3. a.

Previous experience of applicant in financial market (Please specify experience in custody business,  if any)  \n4. An undertaking by the CEO of the applicant company that it has not been subject to litigation or adverse regulatory action or punitive action in the last 5 years  \n \n \n  \nAnnex II \n \nACCOUNTING GUIDELINES FOR REPO TRANSACTIONS FOR ENTITIES \nREGULATED BY THE  RESERVE BANK  \n \n1.  Applicability of the accounting guidelines: The revised accounting guidelines \nwill apply to repo transactions in government securities and corporate debt securities  \nincluding the tri -party repo in such securities .   \n2. Market participant s may undertake repos from any of the three categor ies of \ninvestments, viz.,  Held for Trading,  Available for Sale  and Held t o Maturity.  \n3. The economic essence of a repo transaction, viz., borrowing (lending) of funds by \nselling (purchasing) securities shall be reflected in the books of the repo participants, \nby accounting the same as collateralized lending and borrowing transaction, with an \nagreement to repurchase, on the agreed terms.    Accordingly, the repo seller, i.e., \nborrower of funds in the first  leg, shall not exclude the securities sold under repo but \ncontinue to carry the same in his investment account (please see the illustration \ngiven in the Appendix II -2) reflecting his continued economic interest in the securities \nduring the repo period.   On the other hand, the repo buyer, i.e., lender of funds in \nthe first leg, shall not include the securities purchased under repo in his investment \naccount but show it in a separat e sub- head (please see the Appendix II -1).  The \nsecurities would, however, be transferred from the repo seller to repo buyer in case \nof repos as in the case of normal outright sale/purchase transactions and such \nmovement of securities shall be reflected using the Repo/Reverse Repo Accounts \nand contra entries. In the case of repo seller, the Repo Account is credited in the first \nleg for the securities sold (funds received), while the same is reversed when the \nsecurities are repurchased in the second leg.   Similarly, in the case of repo buyer, \nthe Rever se Repo Account is debited for the amount of securities purchased (funds \nlent) and the same is reversed in the second leg when the securities are sold back.  \n4. The first leg of the repo transaction should be contracted at the prevailing market \nrates. The r eversal (second leg) of the transaction shall be such that the difference \nbetween the consideration amounts of first and second legs should reflect the repo \ninterest.  5. The accounting principles to be followed while accounting for repo / reverse repo \ntransactions are as under:  \n(i) Coupon /Discount  \na. The repo seller shall continue to accrue the coupon/discount on the \nsecurities sold under repo even during the repo period while the repo buyer \nshall not accrue the same.  \nb. In case the interest payment date of the security offered under repo falls \nwithin the repo period, the coupons received by the buyer of the security should \nbe passed on to the seller of the security on the date of receipt as the cash \nconsideration payable by the seller in the second leg does not include any \nintervening cash flows.  \n(ii) Repo Interest Income / Expenditure \nAfter the second leg of the repo / reverse repo transaction is over,  \na. The difference between consideration amounts of the first leg and second \nleg of the repo shall be rec koned as Repo Interest Income / Expenditure in the \nbooks of the r epo buyer / seller respectively ; and \nb. The balance outstanding in the Repo Interest Income / Expenditure account \nshould be transferred to the Profit and Loss account as an income or an \nexpenditure. As regards repo / reverse repo transactions  outstanding on the \nbalance sheet date, only the accrued income / expenditure till the balance \nsheet date should be taken to the Profit and Loss account. Any repo income / \nexpenditure for the remaining per iod should be reckoned for the next \naccounting period.  \n(iii) Marking to Market  \nThe repo seller shall continue to mark to market the securities sold under repo \ntransactions as per the investment classification of the security. To illustrate,   in \ncase the securities sold by banks under repo transactions are out of \nthe  Available for Sale  category, then the mark to market valuation for such \nsecurities should be done at least once a quarter. For entities which do not \nfollow any investment classification norms , the  valuation for securities sold under repo transactions may be in accordance with the valuation norms \nfollowed by them in respect of securities of similar nature.  \n6. Accounting Methodology  \nThe accounting methodology to be followed along with the illust rations is given \nin Appendix II-1 and II-2.  Participants using more stringent accounting principles \nmay continue using the same principles.  \n7. Classification of Accounts  \nBanks shall classify the balances in Repo A/c under Schedule 4 under item I (ii) or I \n(iii) as appropriate. Similarly, the balances in Reverse Repo A/c shall be classified \nunder  Schedule 7 under item I (ii) a or I (ii) b as appropriate. The balances in Repo \ninterest expenditure A/c and Reverse Repo interest income A/c shall be classified \nunder Schedule 15 (under item II or III  as appropriate) and under Schedule 13 (under \nitem III or IV as appropriate) respectively.   The balance sheet classification for other \nparticipants shall be governed by the guidelines issued by the respective regulators.  \n8.  Disclosure \nThe following disclosures should be made by banks in the \u201cNotes on Accounts\u2019 to \nthe Balance Sheet:  \n Minimum \noutstanding \nduring the \nyear Maximum \noutstandin\ng during \nthe year  Daily Average \noutstanding \nduring the \nyear Outstanding as \non \nMarch 31 \nSecurities sold under \nrepo \ni. Government                \nsecurities  \nii. Corporate debt \nsecurities  \niii. Any other securities      \nSecurities purchased \nunder reverse repo \ni. Government  securities  \nii. Corporate debt \nsecurities  \niii. Any other securities      \n \n \n \n  \nAppendix II -1 \nRecommended Accounting Methodology for accounting of Repo / Reverse \nRepo transactions \ni The following accounts may be maintained, viz. , i) Repo Account, ii) Reverse \nRepo Account, iii) Reverse Repo Interest Income Account, iv) Repo Interest Expenditure Account v) Reverse Repo Interest Receivable A ccount and vi) \nRepo Interest Payable Account.  \nii In addition to the above, the following 'contra' accounts may also be maintained, viz. , i) Securities Sold under Repo Account, (ii) Securities \nPurchased under Reverse Repo Account, (iii) Securities Receivable under Repo Account and (iv) Securities Deliverable under Reverse Repo Account.  \nRepo \ni In a repo transaction, the securities should be sold in the first leg at market related prices and re- purchased in the second leg at the same prices. The \nconsideration amount in the second leg would, however, include the repo interest. The sale and repurchase should be reflected in the Repo Account.  \nii Though the securities are not excluded from the repo seller's investment account and not included in the repo buyer's investment  account, the transfer \nof securities shall be reflected by using the necessary contra entries.  \nReverse Repo  \ni In a reverse repo transaction, the securities should be purchased in the first leg at prevailing market prices and sold in the second leg at the sam e prices. \nThe consideration amount in the second leg would, however, include the repo interest. The purchase and sale should be reflected in the Reverse Repo Account.  \nii The balances in the Reverse Repo Account shall not be a part of the Investment Account for balance sheet purposes but can be reckoned for SLR \npurposes if the securities acquired under reverse repo transactions are approved securities.   \n Other aspects relating to Repo/Reverse Repo  \ni In case the interest payment date of the securities sold under repo falls within the repo period, the coupons received by the buyer of the security should be passed on to the seller on the date of receipt as the cash consideration payable by the seller in the second leg does not include any intervening cash flows.  \nii To reflect the accrual of interest in respect of the outstanding repo transactions at the end of the accounting period, appropriate entries should be passed in the Profit and Loss account to reflect Repo Interest Income / Expenditure in the books of the buyer / seller respectively and the same should be debited / credited as an expenditure payable/income receivable. Such entries passed should be reversed on the first working day of the next account ing period.  \niii Repo seller continues to accrue coupon/discount as the case may be, even during the repo period while the repo buyer shall not accrue the same.  \n \nIllustrative examples are given in Appendix II -2\n.Appendix II -2 \n \nIllustrative examples for accounting of Repo / Reverse repo transactions  \n \nWhile in the body of the Direction , the term \"repo\" is used generically to \ninclude both repo and reverse repo (which is simply a mirror image of a repo \ntransaction), in this Appendi x the accounting guidelines have been set out \nseparately for repo and reverse repo for clarity.  \n \nA.

Background   \n  \n1.1 The Ministry of Rural Development,  Government of India launched a programme known as \nNational Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) by restructuring and replacing the Swarnjayanti \nGram Swarozgar Yojana  (SGSY) scheme with effect from April 01, 2013. Detailed \u2018Guidelines\u2019 \nwere circulated to all Scheduled Commercial Banks including Regional Rural Ba nks vide RBI    \ncircular RPCD.GSSD.CO.No.81/09.01.03/2012- 13 dated June 27, 2013 . NRLM was renamed \nas Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana \u2013 National Livelihoods Mission (DAY -NRLM) with effect from \nMarch 29, 2016.  \n  \n1.2 DAY-NRLM is the flagship program of Govt. of India for promoting poverty reduction through \nbuilding strong institutions of the poor, particularly women, and enabling these institutions to access a range of financial services and livelihood services. DAY -NRLM is designed to be a \nhighly intensive program and focuses on intensive application of human and material resources \nin order to mobilize the poor into functionally effectiv e community owned institutions, promote \ntheir financial inclusion and strengthen their  livelihoods. DAY -NRLM complements these \ninstitutional platforms of the poor with services that include financial and capital services, \nproduction and productivity enhancement services, technology, knowledge, skills and inputs, market linkage, etc. The comm unity institutions also offer a platform for convergence and \npartnerships with various stakeholders by building environment for the poor to access their rights and entitlements and public service.   \n  \n1.3 A women\u2019s Self -Help Group (SHG), coming together on the basis of mutual affinity is the \nprimary building block of the DAY -NRLM community institutional design. DAY -NRLM focuses on \nbuilding, nurturing and strengthening the institutions of the poor women, including the SHGs and their Federations at village an d higher levels. In addition, DAY - NRLM promotes livelihood \ninstitutions of rural poor. The mission provides a continuous hand- holding support to the \ninstitutions of poor for a period of 5 \u2013  7 years till they come out of abject poverty. The community \ninstitutional architecture put in place under DAY - NRLM will provide support for a much longer \nduration and of a greater intensity.  \n \n1.4 The support  from  DAY -NRLM  includes  all  round  capacity building  of  the  SHGs ensuring \nthat the group functions effec tively on all issues concerning their members, financial \nmanagement, providing them with initial fund support to address vulnerabilities and high cost \nindebtedness, formation and nurturing of SHG federations, making the federations evolve as \nstrong support  organizations, making livelihoods of the poor sustainable, formation and nurturing \nof livelihoods organizations, skill development of the rural youth to start their own enterprises or \ntake up jobs in organized sector, enabling these institutions to access  their entitlements from the \nkey line departments, etc.  \n  \n1.5 The implementation of DAY -NRLM has been in a Mission Mode since April, 2013. DAY -\nNRLM adopts a demand driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State \nspecific poverty reductio n action plans. DAY -NRLM enables the State rural livelihoods missions \nto professionalize their human resources at State, district and block level. The State missions   \n3  are capacitated to deliver a wide range of quality services to the rural poor. DAY -NRLM \nemphasizes continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with \nlivelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector, and \nmonitoring against targets of poverty reduction outcomes. The blocks and districts in which all \nthe components of DAY -NRLM will be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner \ninstitutions or NGOs, will be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas remaining will be non-\nintensive blocks and districts. The selection of intensive districts are done by the states based \non the demographic vulnerabilities. It will be rolled out in a phased manner over the next 7 -  8 \nyears. All blocks in the country will become intensive blocks over time. The key features of DAY -\nNRLM have been furnished in Annex I .  \n  \n  \n2. Women SHGs and their Federations    \n  \n2.1 Women SHGs under DAY -NRLM consist of 10- 20 persons. In case of special SHGs i.e. \ngroups in the difficult areas, groups with disabled persons, and groups formed in remote tribal \nareas, this number may be a minimum of 5 persons.  \n  \n2.2 DAY-NRLM promotes affinity -based  women Self Help Groups (SHGs).   \n  \n2.3 Only for groups  to  be  formed  with  Persons  with  disabilities,  and  other  special categories \nlike elders, trans genders, DAY -NRLM will have both men and women in the Self -Help Groups.  \n \n2.4 SHG is an informal group and registration under any Societies Act, S tate cooperative Act or \na partnership firm is not mandatory vide Circular RPCD. No. Plan BC.13/PL-  09.22/90 -91 dated \nJuly 24th, 1991. However, Federations of Self Help Groups formed at Village, Gram Panchayat, \nCluster or higher level may be registered under appropriate acts prevailing in their States.   \n  \nFinancial Assistance to the SHGs    \n   \n3. Revolving Fund (RF): DAY -NRLM would provide Revolving Fund (RF) support to SHGs in \nexistence for a minimum period of 3/6 months and follow the norms of good SHGs, i .e. they \nfollow \u2018Panchasutra\u2019 \u2013  regular meetings, regular savings, regular internal lending, regular \nrecoveries and maintenance of proper books of accounts. Only such SHGs that have not \nreceived any RF earlier will be provided with RF, as corpus, with a mi nimum of \u20b910, 000 and up \nto a maximum of \u20b915,000 per SHG. The purpose of RF is to strengthen their institutional and \nfinancial management capacity and build a good credit history within the group.   \n  \n4. Capital Subsidy has been discontinued under DAY -NRLM:   \n \nNo Capital Subsidy will be sanctioned to any SHG from the date of implementation of DAY -\nNRLM.   \n 5. Community Investment Support Fund (CIF)    \n \n  CIF will be provided to the SHGs in the intensive blocks, routed through the Village level/ Cluster \nlevel Federations, to be maintained in perpetuity by the Federations. The CIF will be used, by the Federations, to advance loans to the SHGs and/or to under take the common/collective socio-\neconomic activities.     \n4    \n \n6. Introduction of Interest subvention:    \n DAY-NRLM has a provision for interest subvention, to cover the difference between the Lending \nRate of the banks and 7%, on all credit from the banks/ fina ncial institutions availed by women \nSHGs, for a maximum of  \u20b9 300,000 /- per SHG. This will be available across the country in two \nways:  \n  \n(i) In 250 identified districts, banks will lend to the women SHGs @7% up to an aggregated \nloan amount of \u20b9 300,000/ -.The SHGs will also get additional interest subvention of 3% on \nprompt repayment, reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%.  \n  \n(ii) In the remaining districts, the banks will lend at their respective lending rate applicable to \nSHGs . All women SHGs under DAY \u2013 NRLM, will be eligible for interest subvention on prompt \npayment  to the extent of difference between the lending rates and 7% for the loan up to Rs. \n300,000/ - subject to maximum of 5.5 % or as prescribed by the MoRD.   This part of the scheme \nwill be operationalized by SRLMs.   \n \n\u2022 Salient features of the Scheme are enclosed in Annex II . \n\u2022 The list of 250 identified districts is as per Annex III . \n\u2022 Interest subvention for subsequent years will be communicated separately to the banks \nby GOI/RBI.   \n7. Role of banks:   \n  \n7.1 Opening of Savings accounts:    \n 7.1.1 Opening of Savings account of SHGs:  The role of banks would commence with opening \nof accounts for all the Women SHGs including members with disability and the Federations of \nthe SHGs.

Accordingly, the current instructions under Simplified norms for Self Help \nGroups (SHGs) mention that Customer Due Diligence (CDD) of all the members of SH G as \nmentioned in the above Direction shall not be required while opening the savings bank \naccount of the SHG. CDD of all the office bearers shall suffice. No separate CDD of the \nmembers or office bearers shall be necessary at the time of credit linking of  SHGs . Opening \nof savings account of all members with the bank shall not be made a prerequisite for credit \nlinkage of SHGs. Banks are advised to maintain separate Savings and loan account for Self \nHelp Groups.      \n5   \n7.1.2  Opening of Savings account of Federa tion of SHGs : Banks are advised to open savings \naccount of Federations of SHGs at village, Gram Panchayat, Cluster or higher level. These \naccounts may be categorized as savings account for \u2018Association of persons\u2019.  The \u2018Know Your \nCustomer\u2019 (KYC) norms for  the signatories of such accounts as specified from time to time by \nReserve Bank of India will be applicable.  \n \n7.1.3 Transaction  in Savings account of SHGs and Federation of SHGs : SHGs and their \nfederations may be encouraged to transact through their respective saving account on regular \nbasis. To facilitate this, banks are advised to enable transactions in jointly operated savings \naccount of SHGs and their federations with inter -operable facility at retail outlets managed by \nBusiness Correspondent Agents. Banks are also advised to extend all such services to SHGs and their federations through Business Correspondent agents permitted vide circular\n \nDBOD.No.BAPD.BC.1 22/22.01.009/2013- 14 dated  June 24, 2014 .  \n   \n7.2 Lending Norms:    \n  \n7.2.1 The eligibility criteria for the SHGs to avail loans :   \n   \n\u2022 SHG should be in active existence at least since the last 6 months as per the books of account         \nof SHGs and not from the dat e of opening of S/B account;   \n\u2022 SHG should be practicing \u2018 Panchasutras\u2019 i.e. Regular meetings; Regular savings; Regular  \ninter-loaning; Timely repayment; and Up- to-date books of accounts;    \n\u2022 Qualified as per grading norms fixed by NABARD. As and when the federations of the  SHGs  \ncome  to  existence,  the  grading  exercise  can  be  done  by  the F ederations to support the \nBanks;    \n\u2022 The existing defunct SHGs are also eligible for credit if they are revived and continue to be active for a minimum period of 3 months.   \n  \n7.2.2 Loan Application: It is advised that all banks should use the Common Loan Application \nForms recommended by I ndian Bank\u2019s Association (IBA) for extending credit facility to SHGs.  \n 7.2.3  Loan amount : Emphasis is laid on the multiple doses of assistance under DAY - NRLM. \nThis would mean assisting an SHG over a period of time, through repeat doses of credit, to enable them to access higher amounts of credit for taking up sustainable livelihoods and improve \non the quality of life.  \n \nSHGs can avail either Term Loan (TL) or a Cash Credit Li mit (CCL) loan or both based on  the \nneed. In case   of  need,  additional  loan  can  be  sanctioned  even  though  the previous loan is \noutstanding.  \n \nThe amount of credit under different facilities should be as follows:   \n  \nCash Credit Limit (CCL):  In case of CCL, banks are advised to sanction minimum l oan of `  5 \nlakhs to each eligible SHGs for a period of 5 years with a yearly drawing power (DP).  The  \ndrawing  power  may  be  enhanced  annually  based  on  the  repayment performance of the SHG. The drawing power may be calculated as follows:   \n    \n6  \u2022 DP  for  First  Year:  6  times  of  the  existing  corpus  or  minimum  of  \u20b9  1  lakh whichever                                                  \nis higher.  \n\u2022 DP for Second Year: 8 times of the corpus at the time review/ enhancement or minimum o f \u20b9 \n2 lakh, whichever is higher.    \n\u2022 DP for Third Year: Minimum of \u20b9 3 lakhs based on the Micro credit plan prepared by SHG                                          \nand appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit history.    \n\u2022 DP for Fourth Year onwards: Minimum of \u20b9 5 lakhs based on the Micro credit plan prepared \nby SHG and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit History.  \n \nTerm Loan:  In case of Term Loan, banks are advised to sanction loan amount in doses as \nmentioned below:    \n\u2022 First Dose: 6 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b9 1 lakh whichever is higher.    \n\u2022 Second Dose: 8 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b9 2 lakh, whichever is higher .  \n\u2022 Third Dose: Minimum of \u20b9 3 lakhs based on the Micro credit plan prepared by the SHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit h istory.   \n\u2022 Fourth Dose: Minimum of \u20b9 5 lakhs based on the Micro credit plan prepared by the SHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit History  \n  \nBanks should take necessary measures to ensure that eligible SHGs  are provided with repeat \nloans. Banks are advised to work with DAY -NRLM to institutionalize a mechanism for online \nsubmission of loan application of SHGs for tracking and timely disposal of application.  \n  \n(Corpus is inclusive of revolving funds, if any, r eceived by that SHG, its own savings, interest \nearning by SHG from on- lending to its members, income from other sources, and funds from \nother sources in case of promotion by other institutes/NGOs.)   \n \n7.3 Purpose of loan and repayment :   \n  \n7.3.1 The loan amount will be distributed among members based on the Micro Credit Plan (MCP) \nprepared by the SHGs. The loans may be used by members for meeting social needs, high cost debt swapping, construction or repair of house, construction of toilets and taking up sustainable \nlivelihoods by the individual members within the SHGs or to finance any viable common activity \nstarted by the SHGs.   \n  \n7.3.2 In order to facilitate use of loans for augmenting livelihoods of SHG members, it is advised \nthat at least 50%  of loans above \u20b9 2 lakhs and 75% of loans above \u20b9 4 lakhs be used primarily \nfor income generating productive purposes. Micro Credit Plan (MCP) prepared by SHGs would \nform the basis for determining the purpose and usage of loans.  \n \n7.3.3 Repayment schedule could be as follows:   \n  \n\u2022 The First year/ first dose of loan will be repaid in 12-18 months in monthly/ quarterly \ninstalments.   \n\u2022 The Second year/ Second dose of loan will be repaid in 18-24 months in  monthly/ quarterly \ninstalments.  \n\u2022 The Third year/ Third dose of loan will be repaid in 24- 36 months in monthly/ quarterly \ninstalments.    \n\u2022 The loan from Fourth year/ Fourth dose onwards has to be repaid between 3- 6 years based \non the cash flow in monthly/ quarterly installments.    \n7   \n7.4 Security and Margin: No collateral and no margin will be charged up to \u20b9 10.00 lakhs limit \nto the SHGs. No lien should be marked against savings bank account of SHGs and no deposits \nshould be insisted upon while sanctioning loans.  \n  \n7.5 Dealing with Defaulters :   \n  \n7.5.1 It is desirable that willful defaulters should not be financed under DAY -NRLM. In case willful \ndefaulters are members of a group, they might be allowed to benefit from the thrift and credit \nactivities of the group including the corpus built up with t he assistance of Revolving Fund. But at \nthe stage of accessing bank loan by SHG for financing economic activities by its members, the willful defaulters should not have the benefit of such bank loan until the outstanding loans are \nrepaid. Willful defaulter s of the group should not get benefits under the DAY -NRLM Scheme and \nthe group may be financed excluding such defaulters while documenting the loan. However, \nbanks should not deny loan to entire SHG on the pretext that spouse or other family members \nof ind ividual members of SHG being a defaulter with the bank. Further, non- willful defaulters \nshould not be debarred from receiving the loan. In case default is due to genuine reasons, Banks may follow the norms suggested for restructuring the account with revis ed repayment schedule.  \n \n8. Credit Target Planning  \n  \n8.1 Based on the Potential Linked Plan/State Focus Paper prepared by NABARD, SLBC sub-\ncommittee on SHG Bank Linkage may arrive at the district -wise, block -wise and branch- wise \ncredit plan. The sub-  comm ittee should consider the existing SHGs, New SHGs proposed, and \nnumber of SHGs eligible for fresh and repeat loans as suggested by the SRLMs to arrive at the \ncredit targets for the states. The targets so decided should be approved in the SLBC and should \nbe reviewed and monitored periodically for effective implementation.  \n 8.2 The district -wise credit plans should be communicated to the DCC. The Block - wise/Cluster -\nwise targets are to be communicated to the bank Branches through the Controllers .  \n \n9. Post c redit follow- up   \n  \n9.1 Loan pass books or statement of accounts in regional languages may be issued to the SHGs \nwhich may contain all the details of the loans disbursed to them and the terms and conditions \napplicable to the loan sanctioned. The passbook s hould be updated with every transaction made \nby the SHGs. At the time of documentation and disbursement of loan, it is advisable to clearly \nexplain the terms and conditions as part of financial literacy.   \n  9.2 Bank branches may observe one fixed day in a  fortnight to enable the staff to go to the field \nand attend the meetings of the SHGs and Federations to observe the operations of the SHGs \nand keep a track of the regularity in the SHGs meetings and performance.   \n  \n10. Repayment:    \n  \nPrompt repayment of the loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks \nshall take all possible measures, i.e. personal contact, organization of joint recovery camps with \nDistrict Mission Management Units (DPMUs) / DRDAs to ensure the recovery of loans.  Keeping \nin view, the importance of loan recovery, banks should prepare a list of defaulting SHGs under   \n8  DAY-NRLM every month and furnish the list in the BLBC, DCC meetings. This would ensure that \nDAY-NRLM staff at the district/ block level will assist the bankers i n initiating the repayment.   \n  \n11. Deputation of the bank officials to SRLMs    \n   \nAs a measure of strengthening the (DPMUs) / DRDAs and for promoting a better credit \nenvironment, deputation of the bank officials to DPMUs/ DRDAs has been suggested. Banks \nmay consider deputing officers at various levels to the State Governments/DRDAs in c onsultation \nwith them.   \n \n 12. Supervision and monitoring of the Scheme      \nBanks may set up DAY -NRLM cells at Regional/Zonal offices. These cells should periodically \nmonitor and review the flow of credit to the SHGs, ensure the implementation of the guidelines \nto the scheme, collect data from the branches and make available consolidated data to the Head \noffice and the DAY -NRLM units at the districts/ blocks. The  cell  should  also  discuss  this  \nconsolidated  data  in  the  SLBC,  BLBC  and  DCC meetings regularly to maintain the effective \ncommunication with the state staff and all banks.   \n  \n12.1 State  Level Bankers\u2019 Committee: SLBCs shall constitute a sub- committee on SHG  bank \nlinkage. The sub- committee should consist of members from all banks operating in the State, \nRBI, NABARD, CEO of SRLM, representatives of State Rural Development Department, Secretary -Institutional Finance and Representatives of Development Departments etc. The sub-  \ncommittee shall meet once in a month with a specific agenda of review, implementation and monitoring of the SHG -Bank linkage and the issues/ constraints in achievement of the credit \ntarget. The decisions of SLBCs should be derived from the analysis of the reports of the sub-\ncommittee.   \n  \n12.2 District Coordination Committee: The DCC (DAY -NRLM sub -committee) shall regularly \nmonitor the flow of cr edit to SHGs at the district level and resolve issues that constrain the flow \nof credit to the SHGs at district level. This committee meeting should have participation of LDMs, AGM of NABARD, district coordinators of the banks and DPMU staff representing D AY-NRLM \nand office bearers of SHG federations.   \n  \n12.3 Block level Bankers Committee: The BLBC shall meet regularly and take up issues of \nSHG bank linkage at the block level. In this Committee, the SHGs/ Federations of the SHGs \nshould be included as members to raise their voice in the forum. Branch wise status of SHG \ncredit shall be monitor ed at the BLBC (Annex B and C may be used for the purpose)  \n  \n12.4 Reporting to Lead District Managers: The branches may furnish the progress report and \nthe delinquency report achieved under various activities of DAY -NRLM in the format at \nAnnex \n\u2018IV\u2019 and  \u2018Annex V \u2019 to the LDM every month for onward submission to Special Steering \nCommittee/sub -committee constituted by SLBC.   \n  \n12.5 Reporting to RBI:  Banks may give a state- wise consolidated report on the progress made \non DAY -NRLM to RBI/NABARD at quarterly intervals.

Data Sharing:    \n  \nData sharing on a mutually agreed format / interval may be provided to DAY -NRLM or State \nRural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs) for initiating various strategies including r ecovery etc.  \n The financing banks are advised to regularly share data on loans to SHGs with the DAYNRLM \nor SRLMs, directly from the CBS platform.   \n  \n14. DAY -NRLM support to the bankers:    \n  \n14.1 SRLM would develop strategic partnerships with major banks at various levels. It would \ninvest in creating enabling conditions for both the banks and the poor for a mutually rewarding \nrelationship.   \n  \n14.2 SRLM w ill assist   the   SHGs   through   imparting   financial  Literacy , extending counselling \nservices on savings, credit, insurance, pension  and training on Micro- investment  Planning \nembedded in capacity building.   \n  \n14.3 SRLMs will extend support to banks for improving quality of banking services to poor clients \nincluding follow -up for recovery of over dues if any, by positioning customer relationship \nmanagers (Bank Mitra/ Sakhi) with every bank branch involved in financing of SHGs.  \n  \n14.4 Leveraging IT mobile technol ogies and institutions of poor, youth or SHG member as \nbusiness facilitators and business correspondents.     \n14.5 Community Based Repayment mechanism (CBRM) : One exclusive sub -  committee for \nSHG Bank Linkage may be formed at village/cluster/ block level which will provide support to the \nbanks in ensuring proper utilization of loan amount, recovery etc. The bank linkage sub -  \ncommittee members from each village level federation along with project staff will meet once in a month under the chairmanship of th e Branch Manager in the branch premises with the agenda \nitems relating to bank linkage.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n10   \n \n \nAnnex I   \n  \n   \nKey Features of DAY -NRLM   \n  \n1. Universal Social Mobilization: To begin with, DAY -NRLM would ensure that at least one \nmember from each identified rural poor household, preferably a woman, is brought under the \nSelf Help Group (SHG) network in a time bound manner. Subsequently, both women and men \nwould be organized for addressing livelihood issues i.e. farmers organizations, milk producers\u2019  \ncooperatives, weavers associations, etc. All these institutions are inclusive and no poor would \nbe left out of them. DAY -NRLM would ensure adequate  coverage  of  vulnerable  sections  of  \nthe  society  such  that  50%  of  the beneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are minorities and 3% are \npersons with disability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of all \nhouseholds under the automatically included criteria and households with at least one \ndeprivation criteria as per Socio- Economic and Cas te Census (SECC).  \n  \n2. Participatory Identification of poor (PIP): The experience from SGSY suggests that the \ncurrent BPL list has large inclusion and exclusion errors. To widen the target groups beyond the BPL list and to include all the needy poor ident ified as households with at least one deprivation \ncriteria as per Socio- Economic and Caste Census (SECC). DAY - NRLM will also undertake \ncommunity -based process i.e. participation of the poor in the process of identifying the target \ngroup. Participatory process based on sound methodology and tools (social mapping and well -\nbeing categorization, deprivation indicators) and also locally understood and accepted criterion \nensures local consensus that inadvertently reduces the inclusion and exclusion errors and \nenables formation of the groups on the basis of mutual affinity. Over the years, the participatory \nmethod of identifying the poor have been developed and applied successfully in the states like AP, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha.   \n  \nThe households identified  with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC along with \nhouseholds identified through the P.I.P process will be accepted as DAY -NRLM target group and \nwill be eligible for all the benefits under the programme. The list finalized after PIP process wil l \nbe vetted by the Gram Sabha and approved by the Gram Panchayat.   \n  \nTill the PIP process is undertaken by the State in a particular district/Block, the rural households \nwith at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC list will be targeted under DAY -NRLM. As \nalready provided in the Framework for implementation of DAY -NRLM, up to 30% of the total \nmembership of the SHGs may be from among the population marginally above the poverty line, \nsubject to the approval of other members of the group. This 30% also includes the poor households whose name does not figure in the SECC list but are as poor as those included in \nSECC list.  \n  \n3. Promotion of Institutions of the poor: Strong institutions of the poor such as SHGs and \ntheir village level and higher -level federations are necessary to provide space, voice and \nresources for the poor and for reducing their dependence on external agencies. They empower \nthem and also act as instruments of knowledge and technology dissemination, and hubs of \nproduction, collectivizati on and commerce. DAY -NRLM, therefore, would focus on setting up   \n11  these institutions at various levels. In addition, DAY - NRLM would promote specialized \ninstitutions like Livelihoods collectives, producers\u2019 cooperative/companies for livelihoods \npromotion thr ough deriving economies of scale, backward and forward linkages, and access to \ninformation, credit, technology, markets etc.  \nThe Livelihoods collectives would enable the poor to optimize their limited resource.   \n  \n4. Strengthening all existing SHGs and federations of the poor. There are existing \ninstitutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of NGOs. DAY - NRLM \nwould strengthen all existing institutions of the poor in a partnership mode. The sel fhelp \npromoting institutions both in the Government and in the NGO sector would promote social \naccountability practices to introduce greater transparency. This would be in addition to the \nmechanisms that would be evolved by SRLMs and state governments. The learning from one \nanother underpins the key processes of learning in DAY -NRLM.  \n  \n5. Emphasis on Training, Capacity building and skill building:  DAY -NRLM would ensure \nthat the poor are provided with the requisite skills for managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods, enhancing their credit absorption capacity and \ncredit worthiness, etc. A multi -pronged  approach is envisaged for continuous capacity building \nof the targeted families, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and \nother key stakeholders. Particular focus would be on developing and engaging community \nprofessionals and community resource persons for capacity building of SHGs and their \nfederations and other collectives. DAY - NRLM would make extensive use of ICT to make \nknowledge dissemination and capacity building more effective. \n \n \n6. Revolving Fund and Community investme nt support Fund (C.I.F): A Revolving Fund \nwould be provided to eligible SHGs as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thrift and accumulate \ntheir own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long- run and immediate consumption \nneeds in the short -run. The C.I.F would be a corpus and used for meeting the members\u2019 credit \nneeds directly and as catalytic capital for leveraging repeat bank finance. The C.I.F would be \nrouted to the SHGs through the Federations. The  key  to  coming  out  of  poverty  is  continuous  \nand  easy  access  to  finance,  at reasonable rates, till they accumulate their own funds in large measure.   \n  \n7. Universal Financial Inclusion: DAY -NRLM would work towards achieving universal financial \ninclusion, beyond basic banking services to all the poor households, SHGs and their federations. \nDAY-NRLM would work on both demand and supply side of Financial Inclusion. On the demand \nside, it would promote financial literacy among the poor and provides catalytic capital to the SHGs and their f ederations. On the supply side, it would coordinate with the financial sector and \nencourage use of Information, Communication & Technology (ICT) based financial technologies, \nbusiness correspondents and community facilitators like \u2018Bank Mitras\u2019. It would also work \ntowards universal coverage of rural poor against loss of life, health and assets. Further, it would work on remittances, especially in areas where migration is endemic.   \n  \n8. Provision of Interest Subvention: The rural poor need credit at low rat e of interest and in \nmultiple doses to make their ventures economically viable. In order to ensure affordable credit, \nDAY-NRLM has a provision for subvention on interest rate above 7% per annum for all eligible \nSHGs, who have availed loans from mainstream financial institutions.   \n    \n12  9. Funding Pattern: DAY -NRLM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the financing of the \nprogramme would be shared between the Centre and the States in the ratio of 60:40 (90:10 in \ncase of North Eastern States including Sikkim; com pletely from the Centre in case of UTs). The \nCentral allocation earmarked for the States would broadly be distributed in relation to the \nincidence of poverty in the States.   \n  \n10. Phased Implementation: Social capital of the poor consists of the instituti ons of the poor, \ntheir leaders, community professionals and more importantly community resource persons (poor \nwomen whose lives have been transformed through the support of their institutions). Building up \nsocial capital takes some time in the initial year s, but it multiplies rapidly after some time. If the \nsocial capital of the poor does not play the lead role in DAY -NRLM, then it would not be a people\u2019s \nprogramme. Further, it is important to ensure that the quality and effectiveness of the \ninterventions i s not diluted. Therefore, a phased implementation approach is adopted in DAY -\nNRLM. DAY -NRLM would reach all districts by the end of 12th Five- year Plan.   \n  \n11. Intensive blocks. The blocks that are taken up for implementation of DAY -NRLM, \u2018intensive \nblock s\u2019, would have access to a full complement of trained professional staff and cover a whole \nrange of activities of universal and intense social and financial inclusion, livelihoods, partnerships etc. However, in the remaining blocks or non- intensive blocks,  the activities may be limited in \nscope and intensity.   \n  \n12. Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs). RSETI concept is built on the model \npioneered by Rural Development Self Employment Institute (RUDSETI) \u2013  a collaborative \npartnership between SDME Trust, Syndicate Bank and Canara Bank. The model envisages \ntransforming unemployed youth into confident self - employed entrepreneurs through a short \nduration experiential learning programme followed by systematic long duration hand holding \nsupport. Th e need- based training builds entrepreneurship qualities, improves self -confidence, \nreduces risk of failure and develops the trainees into change agents. Banks are fully involved in selection, training and post training follow up stages. The needs of the po or articulated through \nthe institutions of the poor would guide RSETIs in preparing the participants/trainees in their pursuits of self - employment and enterprises. DAY -NRLM would encourage public sector banks \nto set up RSETIs in all districts of the count ry.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n13   \n \n \nAnnex II   \n  \nInterest subvention scheme for Women SHGs -  Year 2019- 20 \n \nI.

The funding for this subvention will be provided to the State Rural Livelihoods Missions (SRLM s) from the allocation for DAY - NRLM. In the Category II districts, Banks will \ncharge the SHGs as per their respective lending norms and the difference between the lending \nrates and 7% subjected to a maximum limit of 5.5% for the FY19- 20 will be subvented in the loan \naccounts of the SHGs by the SRLM. In pursuance of the above, the salient features and the \noperational guidelines in respect of the interest subvention for the category II districts, for the \nyear 2019- 20 are as follows:  \n \n(A) Role of the Banks:  \n \nAll banks who are operating on the Core Banking Solution (CBS) are required to furnish the \ndetails of the Credit disbursement and Credit outstanding of the SHGs across all districts in the desired format as suggested by the MoRD, directly from the CBS platfor m, to the Ministry of   \n15  Rural Development (through FTP or interface) and to the SRLMs. The information should be \nprovided on a monthly basis to facilitate the calculation and disbursement of the Interest \nSubvention amount to SHGs.  \n \n(B) Role of the State Governm ents:  \n i.

In case the transfer of securities is effected subsequent to the issue date of the \nsecurity, the consideration amount payable by the client to the A ggregator/  Facilitator \nwill also include accrued interest from the date of issue.  \n11. Modalities for obtaining payment from clients towards cost of the securities, \naccrued interest wherever applicable and brokerage/  commission/  service charges \nmay be worked out by the A ggregator/  Facilitator  as per the agreement with the client.  \n12.

Employees were often rewarded for increasing short -term profit witho ut adequate recognition of \nthe risks and long- term consequences that their  activities posed to the organis ations. \nThese perverse incentives amplified excessive risk taking that severely threatened the global financial system. The compensation issue has, therefore, been at the centre  \nstage of regulatory reforms.  \n \n2. In the wake of financial crisis, in order to address the issues in a coordinated manner \nacross jurisdictions, the Financial Stability Forum (later the Financial Stability Board  \ni.e. FSB) brought out a set of Principles (FSF Principles for Sound Compensation \nPractices, dated April 02, 2009) and Implementation Standards (FSB Principles for Sound Compensation Practices -  Implementation Standards, dated September 25, \n2009) on sound compensation practices. The Principles are intended to reduce incentives towards excessive risk taking that may arise from the structure of compensation schemes. The Principles call for effective governance of compensation, \nalignment of compensation with prudent  risk taking, effective supervisory oversight and \n2 \n stakeholder engagement. The Principles have been endorsed by the G -20 countries \nand the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).  The Implementation \nStandards are specific norms, prioritizing the areas  that should be addressed by firms \nand supervisors to achieve effective global implementation of the Principles.  \n \n3. The BCBS published in May 2011 the final report on \u2018Range of Methodologies for Risk \nand Performance Alignment of Remuneration\u2019. The main objec tives of the report are \n(a) to present certain remuneration practices and methodologies that support sound \nincentives ; and (b) the elements influencing the effectiveness of risk alignment that \nshould be considered by banks when developing their methodologi es as well as  by \nsupervisors, when reviewing and assessing banks\u2019 practices. In July 2011, the BCBS in consultation with the FSB has also published Pillar 3 disclosure requirements for remuneration.  \n \n4. Taking into account the stipulations in these documents , Reserve Bank had issued the \nGuidelines on compensation vide \nCircular DBOD No.BC.72/29.67.001/2011- 12 dated \nJanuary 13, 2012 , applicable to Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Risk \nTakers and Control Function Staff, etc. for implementation by private sector and foreign \nbanks from the financial year 2012- 13. \n \n5. These Guidelines have since been reviewed based on experience gained and evolving \ninternational best practices. The objective has also been to better align these Guidelines with FSB Principles and Implementation Standards  for Sound \nCompensation Practices and the Supplementary Guidance issued by FSB in March 2018 on the use of compensation tools to address  misconduct risk. Consequently, a \nDiscussion  Paper  on the proposed Guidelines was published on the RBI website and \ncomments were invited from banks and other interested parties by March 31, 2019.  \n \n6.  The final Guidelines, taking into consideration the responses received, are given in \nthe Annex .  \n \n7.  These Guidelines will be applicable for pay cycles beginning from /after  April 01, 2020. \nAll applications for approval of appointment/re- appointment or approval of 3 \n remuneration/revision in remuneration of Whole Time Directors (WTDs)/  Chief \nExecutive Officers (CEOs) shall be submitted with full details as prescribed in \nAppendix 1 . \n \n8. Private sector banks, foreign banks operating under the Wholly Owned Subsidiary mode (WOS), and foreign banks operating in India under the branch mode are required to obtain regulatory approval for grant of remuneration (i.e. compensation) to WTDs/ CEOs in terms of Section 35B of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (B.R. Act, 1949 ). \nThe approval process will involve, inter alia , an assessment of whether the bank\u2019s \ncompensation policies and practices are in accordance with the Guidelines set out in the Annex, and the BCBS Methodologies detailed in Appendix 2\n.  \n \n9. In view of above, the instructions issued vide the circular DBOD \nNo.BC.72 /29.67.001/2011- 12 dated January 13, 2012  stand superseded with effect \nfrom April 01, 2020.  \n \n \nYours faithfully,  \n \n (Shrimohan Yadav)  Chief General Manager   Encl: As above \n \nRelated link  \nPlease also refer subsequent circular  DOR.GOV.REC.44/29.67.001/2021 -22 dated August 30, 2021  on \nthe subject.  \n \n  \n \n  4 \n Annex  \nGuidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors /  \nChief Executive Officers / Material Risk Takers and Control Function staff   \n \nA. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Principles for Sound Compensation \nPractices  \n \n1. The Principles for Sound Compensation Practices  issued by the FSB in April 2009 aim \nto ensure effective governance of compensation, alignment of compensation with prudent \nrisk taking and effective supervisory oversight and stakeholder engagement in compensation. The Principles in brief are as under:  \n(i) Effective governance of compensation  \n\u2022 The firm\u2019s board of directors must actively oversee the compensation system\u2019s \ndesign and operation.  \n\u2022 The firm\u2019s board of directors must monitor and review the compensation system to \nensure the system operates as intended.  \n\u2022 Staff engaged in financial and risk control must be independent, have appropriate \nauthority, and be compens ated in a manner that is independent of the business \nareas they oversee and commensurate with their key role in the firm.  \n(ii) Effective alignment of compensation with prudent risk taking  \n\u2022 Compensation must be adjusted for all types of risk.  \n\u2022 Compensation outcomes must be symmetric with risk outcomes.  \n\u2022 Compensation payout schedules must be sensitive to the time horizon of risks.  \n\u2022 The mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation must be consistent with \nrisk alignment.  \n(iii) Effecti ve supervisory oversight and engagement by stakeholders  \n\u2022 Supervisory review of compensation practices must be rigorous and sustained, \nand deficiencies must be addressed promptly with supervisory action.  \n\u2022 Firms must disclose clear, comprehensive and tim ely information about their \ncompensation practices to facilitate constructive engagement by all stakeholders.  \n \n2. The G uidelines delineated below are based on the above mentioned Principles and \nImplementation Standards  of the FSB, evolving international s tandards, as well as current 5 \n statutory and regulatory framework in India. Banks are required to take steps immediately \nto implement the Guidelines by putting in place necessary policies /systems.   \n \nB. Guidelines on Compensation for Private Sector Banks and  Foreign B anks  \nI. Applicability and Scope:  \na) The Guidelines as laid out below are applicable to private sector banks, including \nLocal Area Banks, Small Finance Banks and Payments Banks.  \nb) Foreign banks operating in India under  branch mode would be required to continue  \nto submit a declaration to Reserve Bank annually from their Head Offices to the effect that their compensation structure in India, including that of CEO\u2019s,  is in conformity \nwith the FSB Principles and S tandards. RBI would take this into account while \napproving CEOs\u2019 compensation.   \nc) The compensation proposals for CEOs and other staff of foreign banks operating in India that have not adopted the FSB principles in their home country are required to \nimplement the compensation G uidelines as prescribed for private sector banks in \nIndia, to the extent applicable to them.  \nd) For the foreign banks operating in India by way of Wholly Owned S ubsidiary (WOS) \nstructure, the compensation Guidelines as prescribed for private sector banks in \nIndia will be applicable.   \nII. Guidelines:  \n \n1. Effective governance of compensation \n1.1 Guideline 1: Compensation Policy  \nBanks should continue to formulate and adopt a comprehensive compensation policy covering all their employees and conduct annual review thereof. The policy should cover all aspects of the compensation structure such as fixed pay, perquisites, performance bonus, guaranteed bonus (joining/sign- on bonus) , severance package, share- linked \ninstruments e.g. Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOPs) , pension plan, gratuity, etc., \ntaking into account these G uidelines.  \n  6 \n 1.2 Guideline 2: Nomination and Remuneration Committee ( NRC)  \nThe board of directors of banks should constitute a \u2018 Nomination and Remuneration \nCommittee \u2019 (NRC) of the board to oversee the framing, review and implementation of \ncompensation policy of the bank on behalf of the b oard. T he NRC should comprise three \nor more non- executive directors, out of which not less than one -half should be \nindependent directors and should include at least one member from Ri sk Management \nCommittee of the b oard. The N RC should work in close coordination with Risk \nManagement Committee of the bank, to  achieve effective alignment between \ncompensation and risks. The N RC should also ensure that the cost/income ratio of the \nbank supports the compensation package consistent w ith maintenance of sound capital \nadequacy ratio.  \n \n2. Effective alignment of compensation with prudent risk taking \n2.1 Guideline 3: For Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material Risk \nTakers (MRTs)  \n Banks should ensure that for the Whole Time Directors ( WTDs ) / Chief Executive Officers \n(CEOs ) / Material Risk Takers  (MRTs ):  \n(a) compensation is adjusted for all types of risk s,  \n(b) compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes,  \n(c) compensation payouts are sensitive to the time horizon of the risk s, and  \n(d) the mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation are consistent with risk \nalignment.  \nA wide variety of measures of credit, market , liquidity  and various other  risks should be \nused by banks in implementation of risk adjustment. The risk adjustment methods should \npreferably have both quantitative and judgmental elements. The compensation should also be in compliance with all statutory requirements.  \nThe compensation structure for the WTDs/CEOs /MRTs  of the bank shall be as under:  \n2.1.1 Fixed P ay and Perquisites \nBanks are required to ensure that the fixed portion of compensation is reasonable, taking into account all relevant factors including adherence to statutory requirement s and \nindustry practice. A ll the fixed items  of compensation, including  the perquisites , will be 7 \n treated as part of fixed pay . It may be noted that all perquisites that  are reimbursable \nshould also be included in the fixed pay  so long as there are monetary  ceilings on these \nreimbursements.  Contributions towards superannuation/retiral  benefits  will be treated as \npart of fixed pay .  \n \n2.1.2 Variable P ay  \n(a) Composition of Variable Pay:   \nThe variable pay can be in the form of share -linked instruments1, or a mix of cash  and \nshare- linked instruments. There should be proper bal ance between the cash and share-\nlinked components in the variable pay. Only in cases where the compensation by way \nof share- linked instruments is not permitted by law/regulat ions, the entire variable pay \ncan be in cash.   \n(b) Limit on Variable Pay:   \n(i) It should be ensured that there is a proper balance betw een fixed pay and variable \npay. In accordance with FSB Implementation Standards, read with paragraph \n2.1.2(b) (iv) and bullet (a) of BCBS stipulations furnished in Appendix 2 , a \nsubstantial proportion of compensation i.e. , at least 50%, should be variable and \npaid on the basis of individual, business -unit and firm -wide measures that \nadequately measure performance, ex cept in cases mentioned in paragraph \n2.1.2(b)(iii) and paragraph 2.2 of these Guidelines. At higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay should be higher. The total variable \npay shall be limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative \nperformance measurement period).  \n(ii) In case variable pay is up to 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay should be via non- cash instruments.  \n(iii) In the event that an executive is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-\nlinked instruments, his/her variable pay will be capped at 150% of the f ixed pay, \nbut shall not be less than 50% of the f ixed pay. \n                                                            \n1 It is clarified that Cash -linked Stock Appreciation Rights (CSARs) are also to be treated as share -linked instruments.  8 \n (iv) The deterioration in the financial performance of the bank should generally lead \nto a contraction in the total amount of variable compensation, which can even be reduced to zero.  \n \n(c) Deferral of Variable Pay:    \n(i) For senior executives, including WTDs, and other  employees who are MRTs  (see \nparagraph 2.4 below), in adherence to FSB I mplementation Standards, deferral \narrangements must invariably exist for the variable pay, regardless of the quantum \nof pay. For such executives of the bank, a minimum of 60% of the total variable \npay must invariably be under deferral arrangements. Further, if cash component is \npart of variable pay , at least 50% of the cash bonus should also be deferred.  \n (ii) However, in cases where the cash component of variable pay is under Rs. 25 lakh, \ndeferral requirements would not be necessary.  \n(d) Period of Deferral Arrangement:   \nThe deferral period should be a minimum of three years.  This would be applicable to \nboth the cash and non -cash components of the variable pay.  \n(e) Vesting:   \nDeferred remuneration should either vest fully at the end of the deferral period or be \nspread out over the course of the deferral period. The first such vesting should be not \nbefore one year from the commencement of the deferral period.  The vesti ng should be \nno faster than on a pro rata basis2. Additionally, vesting should not take place more \nfrequently than on a yearly basis to ensure a proper assessment of risks before the application of ex post  adjustments.   \n(f) Share- linked Instruments:  \nSuch instruments shall be included as a component of variable pay. Norms for grant of \nshare- linked instruments should be framed by banks in conformity with relevant \nstatutory provisions and should form part of the bank\u2019s compensation policy. The details \n                                                            \n2 No faster than pro rata basis means \u2013 vesting should not be frontloaded. In other words, if the deferral arrangement \nis three years, not more than 33.33 % of the total granted ESOPs should vest at the end of first year. Further, n ot \nmore than 33.33 % of total granted ESOPs should v est at the end of second year. Similarly, in case deferral \narrangement is four  years, not more than 25% of total granted ESOPs sh ould vest in each of the first three years. 9 \n of share- linked instruments granted should also be disclosed in terms of the disclosure \nrequirements stipulated in these Guidelines . Share- linked instruments  should be fair \nvalued on the date of grant by the bank  using Black -Scholes model . The fair value thus \narrived at should be recognised as expense beginning with the accounting period for \nwhich approval has been granted.  \n2.1.3 Malus / Clawback  \n(a) The deferred compensation should be subject to malus3/clawback4 arrangements  in \nthe event of subdued or negative financial performance of the bank and/or the relevant \nline of business in any year.  \n(b) Banks are required to put in place appropriate modalities t o incorporate malus / \nclawback mechanism in respect of variable pay, taking into account  Supplementary \nGuidance issued by FSB in March 2018 on use of compensation tools to address \nmisconduct risk , and all  relevant statutory and regulatory stipulations , as applicable. \nThe banks shall identify a representative set of situations in their Compensation Policies, which require them to invoke the malus and clawback clauses that  may be \napplicable on entire variable pay. When setting criteria for the application of malus \nand clawback, banks should also specify  a period during which malus and/ or clawback \ncan be applied, covering at least deferral and retention periods\n5. \n(c) Wherever the assessed divergence in bank\u2019s provisioning for Non-Performing  Assets  \n(NPAs)  or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure6, \nthe bank shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the \nassessment year under \u2018malus\u2019 clause. Further, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained.  In case the \nbank \u2019s post assessment G ross NPAs are less than 2.0 %, these restrictions will apply \n                                                            \n3 A malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration. \nMalus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred. \n \n4 A clawback, on the o ther hand, is a contractual agreement between the employee and the bank in which the \nemployee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain circumstances.  \n \n5 Retention period:  a period of time after the vesting of instru ments which have been awarded as variable pay  during \nwhich they cannot be sold or accessed.  \n \n6 Refer DBR.BP.BC.No.32/21.04.018/2018 -19 dated April 1, 2019 , as amended from  time to time  10 \n only if criteria for public disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in \nprovisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.  \n2.1.4 Guaranteed B onus  \nGuaranteed bonus is  not consistent with sound risk management or the \u2018 pay for \nperformance\u2019  principles and should not be part of the compensation plan. Therefore, \nguaranteed bonus should only occur in the context of hiring new staff as joining/sign- on \nbonus and be limited to the first year. Further , joining/ sign- on bonus should be in the form \nof share- linked instruments only , since upfront payments in cash would create pervers e \nincentives. Such  bonus will neither be considered part of fixed pay nor part of variable \npay. Further, banks should not grant severance pay other than accrued benefits (gratuity, \npension, etc.) except in cases where it is mandatory under  any statute.  \n \n2.1.5 Hedging  \nBanks shall not permit employees to insure or hedge their compensation structure to \noffset the risk alignment effects embedded in their compensation arrangement. To \nenforce the same, banks should establish appropriate compliance arrangements.  \n \n2.2 Guideline 4: For risk control and compliance staff  \nMembers of staff engaged in financial and risk control , including internal audit,  should be \ncompensated in a manner that is independent of the business areas they oversee and commensurate with their key role in the bank. Effective independence and appropriate authority of such staff are necessary to preserve the integrity of financial and risk management\u2019s influence on incentive compensation. Back office and risk control employees play a key role in ensuring the integrity of risk measures. If their own compensation is signific antly affected by short -term measures, their independence may  \nbe compromised. If their compensation is too low, the quality of such employees may be insufficient for their tasks and their authority may be undermined. The mix of fixed and \nvariable compensation for control function personnel should be weighted in favour of fixed compensation. Therefore, the requirement of minimum 50% of total compensation to be \npaid in the form of variable pay  will not be applicable for this category of staff . However , \na reasonable proportion of compensation has to be  in the form of variable pay, so that 11 \n exercising the options of malus and/or clawback, when warranted, is not rendered \ninfructuous.  Subject to the above, while  devising compensation structure  for such staff , \nbanks should adopt principles similar to principl es enunciated for WTD s/CEO s, as \nappropriate.  \n \n2.3 Guideline 5: For other categories of staff  \nWhile these Guidelines do not apply to bank\u2019s staff other than WTDs/CEOs/MRTs and Control Function Staff , banks  are encouraged to adopt  similar principles,  with suitable \nmodifications,  as appropriate for them as well.   \n \n2.4 Guideline 6: Identification of Material Risk Takers of the bank    \n2.4.1 Banks  should identify their Material Risk Takers (MRTs)  whose actions have a \nmaterial impact on the risk exposure of the b ank, and who satisfy the qualitative and any \none of the quantitative criteria given below:  \nStandard Qualitative criteria  \n\u2022 Relate to the role and decision- makin g power of staff members (e.g. , senior  \nmanager, member of management body ) having jointl y or individually,  the \nauthority to commit significantly to risk exposures, etc.  \n \nStandard Quantitative Criteria:  \n\u2022 Their total remuneration exceeds a  certain threshold; the determination of which \nmay be done prudently by the bank , or \n\u2022 They are included among the 0.3% of staff with the highest remuneration in the \nbank, or  \n\u2022 Their remuneration is equal to or greater than the lowest total remuneration of \nsenior management and other risk -takers.  \n \n2.4.2 Banks are advised to refer to the BCBS report entitled \u2018 Range of Methodologies for \nRisk and Performance Alignment of Remuneration\u2019  published in May 2011 for guidance. \nA gist of the methodologies is furnished in Appendix 2. The report intends to enhance \nthe banks\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 unders tanding of risk -adjusted remuneration. This report, by 12 \n providing some clarification on design of risk -adjusted remuneration schemes, supports \nand facilitates greater adoption of sound practices in the banking sector.  \n \n3. Disclosure and engagement by stakeholders  \n3.1 Guideline 7: Disclosure  \nBanks are required to make disclosure on remuneration of WTDs/CEOs/MRTs  on an \nannual basis at the minimum, in their Annual Financial Statements.  \n  \n3.2 To improve clarity on disclosure, banks should make the disclosures in table or chart \nformat and make disclosures for previous as well as the current reporting year (previous \nyear\u2019s disclosure need not be made when the disclosures are made for the first time). The key disclosures required to be made by banks are given in Appendix 3\n. Further, banks \nshould also comply with the disclosure requirements for remuneration prescri bed vide \nCircular DBR.No.BP.BC. 1/21.06.201/2015- 16 dated July 1, 2015 , as amended from time \nto time.  \n \nC. Regulatory and Supervisory Approval / Oversight  \nI. As banks are aware, in terms of the Section 10(1)(b)(iii) of the B.R. Act, 1949 , no \nbanking company shall employ or cont inue the employment of any person whose \nremuneration is, in the opinion of the Reserve Bank, excessive.  \nII. Private sector and foreign banks operating in India are required to obtain regulatory \napproval for  grant of remuneration to WTDs/ CEOs in terms of Section 35B of the \nB.R. Act, 1949.  \nIII. Banks\u2019 compensation policies will also  be subject to supervisory oversight including \nreview under Basel framework. Deficiencies observed in this regard would have the effect of increasing the risk profil e of the bank with attendant consequences , \nincluding a requirement of additional capital if the deficiencies are very significant.  \n \n  13 \n   Appendix 1 \nDetails of Remuneration/Compensation of the Whole Time Director/  \nChief Executive Officer  \n \nParticulars  Existing  \n(Rs.)

The main objectives of the report are to present (i ) some remuneration practices \nand methodologies that support sound incentives and (ii) the challenges or elements influencing \nthe effectiveness of risk alignment that should be considered by banks when developing their \nmethodologies and by supervisors, when reviewing and assessing banks\u2019 practices.  \nSome of the key stipulations of the report are as under:   \n(a) For incentive based remuneration to work, the variable part of remuneration should be truly \nand effectively variable and can even be reduced to zero in l ine with the symmetry principle \ndefined by the FSB. A key element that supervisors expect is the ability for banks to demonstrate that the methodologies they developed to adjust variable remuneration to risk \nand performance are appropriate to their specifi c circumstances.  \n(b) The methodologies for adjusting remuneration to risk and performance should also be consistent with the general risk management and corporate governance framework.  \n(c) Performance measures and their relation to remuneration packages should be clearly defined \nat the beginning of the performance measurement period to ensure that the employees \nperceive the incentive mechanism. The usual annual determination of bonus should be based \non rules, processes and objectives known in advance, recognizing that some discretion will \nalways be needed.  \n(d) Banks should use a combination of financial and non-financial measures to assess employee \nperformance and adapt the measurement to each employee\u2019s specific situation. Qualitative \nfactors (like knowledge, skills  or abilities) might play an important role when it comes to judging \nand rewarding some activities - particularly when these serve to reinforce the bank\u2019s risk \nmanagement goals.  \n(e) The nature and extent to which risk adjustments are needed depends first on the extent to which performance measures capture risks, but in all cases, some form of risk adjustment is \nneeded as remuneration is often awarded before the final outcome of an activity is known. \nRisks taken need to be estimated ( ex ante), risk outcomes observed ( ex post) and both ex \nante estimates and ex post outcomes should affect payoffs.  \n(f) Risk adjustments need to take into account the nature of the risks involved and the time \nhorizons over which they could emerge. The impact of remuneration adjustments should be \nlinked to actions taken by employees and/or business units, and their impact on the level of \nrisk taken on by the bank.  \n(g) The nature of the award process, which links the variable remuneration of each individual employee with bonus pools and the t otal amount of variable remuneration at a bank\u2019s level, is \nalso an area that should be carefully considered by banks and supervisors, as it directly \ninfluences how and when performance and risk adjustment are or can be used.  \n  16 \n Appendix 3  \nDisclosure requirements for remuneration /compensation   \nQualitative \ndisclosures  (a)  Information relating to the composition and mandate of the Nomination and \nRemuneration Committee.  \n(b)  Information relating to the design and structure of remuneration processes \nand the key features and objectives of remuneration policy.  \n(c)  Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into \naccount in the remuneration processes. It should include the nature and type \nof the key measures used to take account of these risks.  \n(d)  Description of the ways in which the bank seeks to link performance during a \nperformance measurement period with levels of remuneration.  \n(e)  A discussion of the bank\u2019s policy on deferral and vesting of variable \nremuneration and a discussion of the bank\u2019s policy and criteria for adjusting \ndeferred remuneration before vesting and after vesting.  \n(f)  Description of the different forms of variable remuneration (i.e. , cash  and \ntypes of share- linked instruments ) that the bank utilizes and the rationale for \nusing these different forms.  \nQuantitative \ndisclosures  \n(The quantitative \ndisclosures should \nonly cover Whole \nTime Directors/  \nChief Executive \nOfficer / Material  \nRisk Takers)  (g)  Number of meetings held by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee \nduring the financial year and remuneration paid to its members.  \n(h)  \u2022 Number of employees having received a variable remuneration award \nduring the financial year.  \n\u2022 Number and total amount of sign- on/joining bonus made during the \nfinancial year.  \n\u2022 Details of severance pay, in addition to accrued benefits, if any.  \n (i)  \u2022 Total amount of outstanding deferred remuneration, split into cash, types \nof share- linked instruments and other forms.  \n\u2022 Total amount of deferred remuneration paid out in the financial year.  \n (j)  Breakdown of amount of remuneration awards for the financial year to show \nfixed and variable, deferred and non- deferred.  \n (k)  \u2022 Total amount of outstanding deferred remuneration and retained \nremuneration exposed to ex post  explicit and/ or implicit adjustments.  \n\u2022 Total amount of reductions during the financial year due to ex - post \nexplicit adjustments.  \n\u2022 Total amount of reductions during the financial year due to ex - post \nimplicit adjustments.  \n (l)  Number of MRTs identified.  \n (m)  \u2022 Number of cases where malus has been exercised . \n\u2022 Number of cases where clawback has been exercised.  \n\u2022 Number of cases where both malus and clawback have been exercised.  \nGeneral \nQuantitative \nDisclosure  (n)  The mean pay for the bank as a whole (excluding sub-staff) and the deviation \nof the pay of  each of  its WTDs from the mean pay.  \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI898C120D41D0E3465B8552E5467EDD7A56.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Nov 04, 2019", "info": "\u092d\u093e\u0930 \u0924\u0940\u092f \ufffd\u0930\u095b\u0935\u0930\u094d \u092c\ufffd\u0915 \nRES\nERVE BANK OF INDIA \nwww.rbi.org.in \n\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\n\u092f\u092e\u0928  \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917  ,\u0915\u0947 \u0928\u094d \ufffd \u0940\u092f  \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f  ,2\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932 , \u0938\ufffd\u091f\u0930 1,  \u093f\u0935\ufffd \ufffd\u093e\u092a\u093e\u0930  \u0915\ufffd \ufffd, \u0915\u092b \u092a\u0930\u0947\u0921 , \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908- 400005 ,\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924  \n\u092b\u094b\u0928: (+91 -22) 221 61940 \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d \u0938 :(91-22) 22150540, Email: cgmdnbrco@rbi.org.in  \nDepartment of Regulation, Central Office, 2nd Floor, Centre-I, World Trade Centre, Cuffe Parade, Colaba, Mumbai \u2013 400005, India \nTel.: (+91-22) 22161940 Fax: (91-22) 22150540, Email: cgmdnbrco@rbi.org.in \n\ufffd\u0939\u0902\u0926\u0940\u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928\u0939\u0948 , \u0907\u0938\u0915\u093e\ufffd\u092f\u094b\u0917\u092c\u0922\u093e\u0907\u092f\u0947\u0964\nRBI/2019 -20/88 \nDOR .NBFC (PD) CC.

In order to strengthen and raise the standard of the Asset Liability Management (ALM)\nframework applicable to NBFCs, it has been decided to revise the extant guidelines on liquidity\nrisk management for NBFCs. All non -deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of \u20b9 100 crore and\nabove, systemically important Core Investment Companies and all deposit taking NBFCs\nirrespective of their asset size, shall adhere to the set of liquidity risk management guidelines\ngiven below. However, these guidelines will not apply to Type 1 NBFC -NDs1, Non-Operating\nFinancial Holding Companies  and Standalone Primary Dealer s. It will be the responsibility of\nthe Board of each NBFC to ensure that the guidelines are adhered to. The internal controls\nrequired to be put in place by NBFCs as per these guidelines shall be subject to supervisory\nreview. Further, as a matter of prudence, all other NBFCs are also encouraged to adopt these\nguidelines on liquidity risk management on voluntary basis.\n3. While some of the current regulatory prescriptions applicable to NBFCs on ALM framework\nhave been recast below, a few additional features including disclosure standards have also\nbeen introduced. The detailed guidelines are given in Annex A  and the important changes are\nas under:\ni) Granular Maturity Buckets and Tolerance Limits\nThe 1-30 day time bucket in the Statement of Structural Liquidity is segregated into granular \nbuckets of 1 -7 days, 8-14 days, and 15-30 days. The net cumulative negative mismatches in \nthe maturity buckets of 1 -7 days, 8-14 days, and 15-30 days shall  not exceed 10%, 10% and \n20% of the cumulative cash outflows in the respective time buckets. NBFCs, however, are \nexpected to monitor their cumulative mismatches (running total) across all other time buckets \n1 Type 1 NBFC-ND as defined in RBI press release dated June 17, 2016.   \n \n   \n \n    \nupto 1 year by establishing internal prudential limits with the approval of the Board. The above \ngranularity in the time buckets would also be applicable to the interest rate sensitivity statement \nrequired to be submitted by NBFCs.  \n \nii)   Liquidity risk monitoring tools  \n \nNBFCs shall adopt liquidity risk monitoring tools/metrics  in order to capture strains  in liquidity \nposition, if any. Such monitoring tools shall  cover  a) concentration of funding by counterparty/ \ninstrument/ currency, b) availability of unencumbered assets that can be used as collateral for \nraising funds; and, c) certain early warning market-based indicators, such as, book- to-equity  \nratio, coupon on debts raised, breaches and regulatory penalties for breaches in regulatory \nliquidity requirements. The Board of NBFCs shall  put in place necessary internal monitoring \nmechanism in this regard.    \n \niii) Adoption of \u201cstock\u201d approach to liquidity  \n \nIn addition to the measurement of structural  and dynamic  liquidity, NBFCs are also mandated \nto monitor liquidity risk based on a \u201cstock\u201d approach to liquidity. The monitoring shall be by \nway of predefined internal limits as decided by the Board for various critical ratios pertaining \nto liquidity risk. Indicative liquidity ratios are short-term liability to total assets; short-term \nliability to long-term assets; commercial papers to total assets; non-convertible debentures  \n(NCDs)  (original maturity less than one year)  to total assets; short-term liabilities to total \nliabilities; long-term assets to total assets; etc.  \n \niv) Extension of liquidity risk  management principles \n \nIn addition to the liquidity risk management principles  underlining extant prescriptions on key \nelements of ALM framework, it has been decided to extend relevant principles to cover  other  \naspects of monitoring and measurement of liquidity risk, viz.,  off-balance sheet and contingent \nliabilities, stress testing, intra-group fund transfers, diversification of funding, collateral position \nmanagement, and contingency funding plan.  \n \nIntroduction of Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)  \n4. In addition, to the guidelines as detailed in Annex A of this circular, the following categories \nof NBFCs shall adhere to the guidelines on LCR including disclosure standards as provided in Annex B :  \n(A) All non-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of \u20b9  10,000 crore and above, and all deposit \ntaking NBFCs irrespective of their asset size, shall maintain a liquidity buffer in terms of LCR  \nwhich will promote resilience of NBFCs to potential liquidity disruptions by ensuring that they have sufficient High Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) to survive any acute liquidity stress scenario lasting for 30 days. The stock of HQLA to be maintained by the NBFCs shall be minimum of \n100% of total net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days. The LCR requirement shall be binding on NBFCs from December 1, 2020 with the minimum HQLAs to be held being 5 0%  \n \n   \n \n    \nof the LCR, progressively reaching up to the required level of 100% by December  1, 2024, as \nper the time-line given below: \n \nFrom  December  1, \n2020 December  1, \n2021  December  1, \n2022  December  1, \n2023  December  1, \n2024  \nMinimum \nLCR 50% 60% 70% 85% 100%  \n \n(B) All non-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of \u20b9  5,000 crore and above but less than \u20b9  \n10,000 crore shall also maintain the required level of LCR starting December  1, 202 0, as per \nthe time-line given below: \n \nFrom  December 1 , \n2020  December  1, \n2021  December  1, \n2022  December  1, \n2023  December  1, \n2024  \nMinimum \nLCR 30% 50% 60% 85% 100%  \n \n(C) Core Investment Companies, Type 1 NBFC-NDs, Non -Operating Financial Holding \nCompanies and Standalone Primary Dealers are exempt from the applicability of LCR norms.  \n \n5. Master Direction - Non-Banking Financial Company - Systemically Important Non-Deposit \ntaking Company, Deposit taking Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016 , Non-Banking \nFinancial Company \u2013 Non-Systemically  Important Non-Deposit taking Company (Reserve \nBank) Directions, 2016  and Master Direction - Core Investment Companies (Reserve Bank) \nDirections, 2016  are being modified accordingly . \n \nYours faithfully  \n \n \n(Manoranjan Mishra)  \nChief General Manager  \n  1 \n Annex A \nGuidelines on Liquidity Risk1 Management Framework  \nNon-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of \u20b9  100 crore and above, systemically important \nCore Investment Companies  and all deposit taking NBFCs  (except Type 1 NBFC -NDs2, Non-\nOperating F inancial Holding Companies  and Standalone Primary D ealers) shall adhere to the \nguidelines as mentioned herein below. It will be the responsibility of the Board to ensure that \nthe guidelines are adhered to. The internal controls required to be put in place by NBFCs  as \nper these guidelines  shall be subject to supervisory review . Further, as a matter of prudence, \nall other NBFCs are also encouraged to adopt these guidelines  on liquidity risk management \non voluntary basis. The guidelines deal with following aspects of Liquidity Risk Management \nframework.  \nA. Liquidity Risk Management Policy, Strategies and Practices  \nB. Management Information System (MIS)   \nC. Internal Controls  \nD. Maturity profiling  \nE. Liquidity Risk Measurement \u2013 Stock Approach \nF. Currency Risk  \nG. Managing Interest Rate Risk \nH. Liquidity Risk Monitoring Tools  \nA. Liquidity Risk Management Policy, Strategies and Practices \nIn order to ensure a sound and robust liquidity risk management system, the Board of the \nNBFC shall frame a liquidity risk management framework which ensures  that it maintains  \nsufficient liquidity3, including a cushion of unencumbered, high quality liquid assets to \nwithstand a range of stress events, including those involving the loss or impairment of both \nunsecured and secured funding sources. It shall spell out the entity -level  liquidity risk \ntolerance; funding strategies ; prudential limits ; system for measuring, assessing and reporting/ \nreviewing liquidity ; framework for stress testing; liquidity planning under alternative \nscenarios/formal contingent funding plan; nature and frequency of management reporting; \nperiodical review of assumptions used in liquidity projection; etc. \n                                                            \n1\u201cLiquidity Risk\u201d means inability of an NBFC to meet such obligations as they become due without adversely \naffecting the NBFC\u2019s financial condition. Effective liquidity risk management helps ensure an NBFC\u2019s ability to \nmeet its obligations as and when they fall due and reduces the probability of an adverse situation developing.  \n2 Type 1 NBFC -ND a s defined in RBI press release dated June 17, 2016 . \n3\u201cLiquidity\u201d means NBFC\u2019s capacity to fund the increase in assets and meet both expected and unexpected cash \nand collateral obligations at reasonable cost and without incurring unacceptable losses.  \n 2 \n Key elements of the liquidity risk management framework are as under:  \ni) Governance of Liquidity Risk Management  \nSuccessful implementation of any risk management process has to emanate from the top \nmanagement in the NBFC with the demonstration of its strong commitment to integrate \nbasic operations and strategic decision-making with risk management. The C hief Risk \nOfficer , appointed by the NBFC in terms of our  circular DNBR (PD) CC. \nNo.099/03.10.001/2018-19 dated May 16, 2019 , shall be involved in the process of \nidentification, measurement and mitigation of liquidity risks.  A desirable organisational set \nup for liquidity risk management should be as under:  \na) Board of Directors   \nThe Board shall have the overall responsibility for management of liquidity risk. The \nBoard shall  decide the strategy, policies and procedures of the NBFC to manage \nliquidity risk in accordance with the liquidity risk tolerance/limits decided by it.   \nb) Risk Management Committee   The Risk Management Committee, which reports to the Boar d and consisting of \nChief Executive Officer (CEO)/ Managing Director and heads of various risk verticals \nshall be responsible for evaluating the overall risks faced by the NBFC including \nliquidity risk.  \nc) Asset -Liability Management Committee (ALCO)  \nThe ALCO consisting of the NBFC\u2019s top management shall  be responsible for \nensuring adherence to the risk tolerance/limits set by the Board as well as implementing the liquidity risk management strategy of the NBFC. The CEO/MD or \nthe Executive Director (ED) should head the Committee. The Chiefs of Investment, \nCredit, Resource Management or Planning, Funds Management/ Treasury (forex \nand domestic), Economic Research may be members of the Committee. The role of \nthe ALCO with respect to liquidity risk should include, inter alia, decision on desired \nmaturity profile and mix of incremental assets and liabilities, sale of assets  as a \nsource of funding, the structure, responsibilities and controls for managing liquidity \nrisk, and overseeing the liquidity positions of all branches.  \nd) Asset Liability Management (ALM) Support Group  \nThe ALM Support Group consisting of the operating staff shall  be responsible for \nanalysing, monitoring and reporting the liquidity risk profile to the ALCO. Such \nsupport groups will be constituted depending on the size and complexity of liquidity \nrisk management in an NBFC.  \nii) Liquidity risk Tolerance \nAn NBFC sh all have a sound process for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling \nliquidity risk. It should clearly articulate a liquidity risk tolerance that is appropriate for its \nbusiness strategy and its role in the financial system. Senior management should develop \nthe strategy to manage liquidity risk in accordance with such risk tolerance and ensur e that \nthe NBFC maintains sufficient liquidity.  3 \n iii) Liquidity Costs, Benefits and Risks in the Internal Pricing  \nNBFCs should endeavour to develop a process to quantify liquidity costs and benefits so \nthat the same may be incorporated in the internal product pricing, performance measurement and new product approval process for all material business lines, products \nand activities.  \niv)  Off-balance Sheet Exposures and Contingent Liabilities  \nThe process of identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk  should \ninclude a robust framework for comprehensively projecting cash flows arising from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items over an appropriate set of time horizons. The \nmanagement of liquidity risks relating to certain off-balance sheet exposures on account of special purpose vehicles, financial derivatives, and, guarantees and commitments may \nbe given particular importance due to the difficulties that many NBFCs have in assess ing \nthe related liquidity risks that could materialise in times of stress.   \nv) Funding Strategy - Diversified Funding  \nAn NBFC sh all establish a funding strategy that provides effective diversification in the \nsources and tenor of funding. It should maintain an ongoing presence in its chosen funding markets and strong relationships with fund providers to promote effective diversification of funding sources. An NBFC should regularly gauge its capacity to raise funds quickly from \neach source. There should not be over -reliance on a single source of funding. Funding \nstrategy should also take into account the qualitative dimension of the conc entrated \nbehaviour  of deposit withdrawal  (for deposit taking NBFCs ) in typical market conditions \nand over-reliance on other funding sources arising out of unique business model.  \nvi) Collateral Position Management  \nAn NBFC sh all actively manage its collateral positions, differentiating between \nencumbered and unencumbered assets. It should monitor the legal entity and physical \nlocation where collateral is held and how it may be mobilised in a timely manner. Further, \nan NBFC should have sufficient collateral to meet expected and unexpected borrowing \nneeds and potential increases in margin requirements over different timeframes . \nvii) Stress Testing  \nStress testing shall  form an integral part of the overall governance and liquidity risk \nmanagement culture in NBFCs. An NBFC should conduct stress tests on a regular basis \nfor a variety of short-term and protracted NBFC -specific and market-wide stress scenarios \n(individually and in combination). In designing liquidity stress scenarios, the nature of the \nNBFC\u2019 s business, activities and vulnerabilities should be taken into consideration so that \nthe scenarios incorporate the major funding and market liquidity risks to which the NBFC \nis exposed.  \nviii) Contingency Funding Plan  \nAn NBFC sh all formulate a contingency funding plan (CFP) for responding to severe \ndisruptions which might affect the NBFC \u2019s ability to fund some or all of its activities in a 4 \n timely manner and at a reasonable cost. Contingency plans should contain details of \navailable/ potential contingency funding sources and the amount/ estimated amount which \ncan be drawn from these sources, clear escalation/ prioritisation procedures detailing when \nand how each of the actions can and should be activated, and the lead time needed to tap \nadditional funds from each of the contingency sources.  \nix) Public disclosure   \nAn NBFC sh all publicly disclose information (Appendix I) on a quarterly basis  on the official \nwebsite of the company and in the annual financial statement as notes to account that \nenables market participants to make an informed judgment about the soundness of its liquidity risk management framework and liquidity position.  \nx) Intra Group transfers  \nWith a view to recognizing the likely increased risk arising due to Intra-Group transactions \nand exposures ( ITEs), the Group Chief Financial officer (CFO) is expected to develop and \nmaintain liquidity management processes and funding programmes that are consistent with the complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations of the companies in the Group\n4. \nThe Group liquidity risk management processes and funding programmes are expected to take into account lending, investment, and other activities, and ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained at the head and each constituent entity within the group. Processes \nand programmes should fully incorporate real and potential constraints, including legal and \nregulatory restrictions, on the transfer of funds among these entities and between these \nentities and the principal.  \nB. Management Information System (MIS)   \nAn NBFC sh all have a reliable MIS designed to provide timely and forward-looking \ninformation on the liquidity position of the NBFC and the Group to the Board and ALCO, both under normal and stress situations. It should capture all sources of liquidity risk, including \ncontingent risks and those arising from new activities, and have the ability to furnish more \ngranular and time-sensitive information during stress events.   \nC. Internal Controls  \nAn NBFC shall have appropriate internal controls, systems and procedures to ensur e \nadherence to liquidity risk management policies and procedure. Management should ensure \nthat an independent party regularly reviews and evaluates the various components of the \nNBFC\u2019 s liquidity risk management process.  \nD. Maturity Profiling \na) For measuring and managing net funding requirements, the use of a maturity ladder and calculation of cumulative surplus or deficit of funds at selected maturity dates is adopted \n                                                            \n4As defined in the Master Direction - Non- Banking Financial Company - Systemically Important Non -Deposit taking Company \nand Deposit taking Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016  5 \n as a standard tool. The Maturity Profile sh ould be used for measuring the future cash flows \nof NBFCs in different time buckets. The time buckets  shall be distributed as under:  \n(i) 1 day to 7 days  \n(ii) 8 day to 14 days  \n(iii) 15 days to 30/31 days (One month)  \n(iv) Over one month and upto 2 months  \n(v) Over two months and upto 3 months  \n(vi) Over 3 months and upto 6 months  \n(vii) Over 6 months and upto 1 year  \n(viii) Over 1 year and upto 3 years  \n(ix) Over 3 years and upto 5 years  \n(x) Over 5 years  \nb) NBFCs would be holding in their investment portfolio, securities which could be broadly \nclassifiable as 'mandatory securities' (under obligation of law) and other 'non-mandatory \nsecurities'. In case of NBFCs not holding public deposits, all investments in  securities , and \nin case of NBFCs holding public deposits, the surplus securities (held over and above the requirement) , shall fall in the category of 'non- mandatory securities'. Alternatively, the \nNBFCs may also follow the concept of Trading Book  as per the extant prescriptions for \nNBFCs.  \nc) Within each time bucket, there could be mismatches depending on cash inflows and outflows. While the mismatches up to one year would be relevant since these provide early warning signals of impending liquidity problems, the main focus shall be on the short-term \nmismatches , viz., 1-30/31 days. The net cumulative negative mismatches in the Statement \nof Structural Liquidity  in the maturity buckets 1-7 days , 8-14 days, and 15-30 days  shall \nnot exceed 10%, 10% and 20% of the cumulative cash outflows in the respective time \nbuckets.  NBFCs, however, are expected to monitor their cumulative mismatches (running \ntotal) across all other time buckets upto 1 year by establishing internal prudential limits \nwith the approval of the Board. NBFCs shall also adopt the above cumulative mi smatch \nlimits for their structural liquidity statement for consolidated operations .  \nd) The Statement of Structural Liquidity may be prepared by placing all cash inflows and \noutflows in the maturity ladder according to the expected timing of cash flows. A maturing liability shall be a cash outflow while a maturing asset shall be a cash inflow.  \ne) In order to enable the NBFCs to monitor their short-term liquidity on a dynamic basis over a time horizon spanning from 1 day to 6 months, NBFCs shall estimate their short-term \nliquidity profiles on the basis of business projections and other commitments for planning purposes.  6 \n E. Liquidity Risk Measurement \u2013 Stock Approach \nNBFCs shall adopt a \u201cstock \u201d approach to liquidity risk measurement and monitor certain critical \nratios in this regard by putting in place internally defined limits as  approved by their Board. \nThe ratios and the internal limits  shall be based on an NBFC\u2019s liquidity risk management \ncapabilities, experience and profile. An indicative list of certain critical ratios  to monitor re \nshort-term5 liability to total assets; short-term liability to long term assets; c ommercial papers \nto total assets ; non-convertible debentures ( NCDs )(original maturity of less than one year ) to \ntotal assets; short-term liabilities to total liabilities; long-term assets to total assets ; etc.   \nF. Currency Risk \nExchange rate volatility imparts a new dimension to the risk profile of an NBFC\u2019 s balance \nsheets having foreign assets or liabilities. The Board of NBFCs should recognise the liquidity  \nrisk arising out of such exposures and develop suitable preparedness  for managing the risk . \nG. Managing Interest Rate Risk (IRR) \nNBFCs shall manage interest rate risk as per the extant regulatory prescriptions.  \nH. Liquidity Risk Monitoring Tools \nThe Statement of Structural Liquidity is currently one of the prescribed monitoring tool s.In \naddition to this , the following tools  shall be adopted by the Board of the NBFC for internal \nmonitoring of liquidity requirements:  \na) Concentration of Funding \nThis metric is meant to identify those significant sources of funding, withdrawal of which \ncould trigger liquidity problems. The metric thus encourages diversification of funding \nsources and monitoring of each of the significant counterparty6, significant product / \ninstrument7 and significant currency. \nb) Available Unencumbered Assets \nThis metric provides significant information on available unencumbered assets , which  \nhave the potential to be used as collateral to raise additional secured funding in secondary \nmarke ts.

 \nii. a partial loss of unsecured wholesale funding capacity;  \niii. a partial loss of secured, short-term financing with certain collateral and counterparties;  \niv. additional contractual outflows that would arise from a downgrade in the NBFC \u2019s credit \nrating, including collateral posting requirements;  \nv. increases in market volatilities that impact the quality of collateral or potential future exposure of derivative positions and thus require larger collateral haircuts or additional collateral, or lead to other liquidity needs;  \nvi. unscheduled draws on committed but unused credit and liquidity facilities that the NBFC has provided to its clients; and,  3 \n vii. the potential need for the NBFC to buy back debt or honour non-contractual obligations \nin the interest of mitigating reputational risk.  \n4) High Quality Liquid Assets \nA) Liquid assets comprise of high quality assets that can be readily sold or used as collateral \nto obtain funds in a range of stress scenarios. They shall  be unencumbered. Assets are \nconsidered to be high quality liquid assets  if they can be easily and immediately converted \ninto cash at little or no loss of value. The liquidity of an asset depends on the underlying stress \nscenario, the volume to be monetized and the timeframe considered. Nevertheless, there are \ncertain assets that are more likely to generate funds without incurring large discounts due to \nfire-sales even in times of stress.  \nB) The fundamental characteristics of HQLAs  include low credit and market risk; ease and \ncertainty of valuation; low correlation with risky assets and listing on a developed and recognized exchange market. The  market related characteristics of HQLAs include active and \nsizeable market; presence of committed market makers; low market concentration and flight to quality (tendencies to move into these types of assets in a systemic crisis).  \nC) Assets to be included in the computation of HQLA s are those that the NBFC is holding on \nthe first day of the stress period. Such assets shall  be valued at an amount no greater than \ntheir current market value for the purpose of computing the LCR. Depending upon the nature \nof assets, they have been assigned different haircuts  below , which are to be applied while \ncalculating the HQLA for the purpose of calculation of LCR. The assets and the haircuts are \nas under:  \n(I) Assets to be included as HQLA without any haircut:  \ni. Cash\n2 \nii. Government securities  \niii. Marketable securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns satisfying all the following \nconditions:  \n(a) Assigned a 0% risk weight by banks under  standardized approach for credit risk;  \n(b) Traded in large, deep and active repo or cash markets characterised by a low level of concentration; and proven record as a reliable source of liquidity in the markets (repo or \nsale) even during stressed market conditions.  \n(c) N ot issued by a bank/financial institution/NBFC or any of its affiliated entities.  \n(II) Assets to be considered for HQLA with a minimum haircut of 15% : \ni. Marketable securities representing claims on or claims guaranteed by sovereigns, Publi c \nSector Entities (PSEs) or multilateral development banks that are assigned a 20% risk \n                                                            \n2 Cash would mean cash on hand and demand deposits with Scheduled Commercial Banks.  4 \n weight by banks under standardised approach for credit risk and provided that they are not \nissued by a bank/financial institution/NBFC or any of its affiliated entities . \nii. Corporate bonds, not issued by a bank/financial institution/NBFC or any of its affiliated \nentities, which have been rated AA - or above by an e ligible credit rating agency.  \niii. Commercial Papers not issued by a bank/PD/financial institution or any of its affiliated entities, which have a short-term  rating equivalent to the long-term rating of AA - or above \nby an eligible credit rating agency. \n(III)  Assets to be considered for HQLA with a minimum haircut of 50% : \ni. Marketable securities representing claims on or claims guaranteed by sovereigns having risk weights higher than 20% but not higher than 50%, i.e., they should have a credit rating not lower than BBB-as prescribed for banks in India.  \nii. Common Equity Shares which satisfy all of the following conditions:  \n(a)  not issued by a bank/financial institution/NBFC or any of its affiliated entities;  \n(b)  included in NSE CNX Nifty index and/or S&P BSE Sensex index.  \niii. Corporate debt securities (including commercial paper)  and the securities having usual \nfundamental and market related characteristics for HQLAs and meeting the following conditions:  \n(a)   not issued by a bank, financial institution, PD, NBFC or any of its affiliated entities;  \n(b) have a long- term credit rating from a n eligible credit rating agency between A+ and \nBBB- or in the absence of a long-term  rating, a short-term rating equivalent in quality \nto the long-term rating;  \n(c) traded in large, deep and active repo or cash markets characterised by a low level \nof concentration; and  \n(d) have a proven record as a reliable source of liquidity in the markets (repo or sale) \neven during stressed market conditions, i.e. a maximum decline of price not \nexceeding 20% or increase in haircut over a 30-day period not exceeding 20  \npercentage points during a relevant period of significant liquidity stress. \n \nD) For the purpose of computing LCR for deposit taking NBFCs, such unencumbered \napproved securities  held as per the provisions of section 45 IB of RBI Act, would be \nreckoned as  HQLA  only to the extent of 80% of the required holding.  \nE) All assets in the stock of liquid assets must be managed as part of that pool by the NBFC and shall be subject to the following operational requirements:  \n(i) must be available at all times to be converted into cash; \n(ii) shall be unencumbered; \n(iii) shall not be co-mingled/ used as hedges on trading position; designated as \ncollateral or credit enhancement in structured transactions  or designated to cover \noperational costs ; \n(iv) shall be managed with sole intent for use as  a source of contingent funds; and,  \n(v) shall be under the control of specific function/s charged with managing liquidity \nrisk of the bank, e.g. ALCO.  \nF) NBFCs should periodically monetize a proportion of assets through repo or outright sale to test the saleability of these assets and to minimize the risk of negative signalling during 5 \n period of stress. NBFCs are also expected to maintain liquid assets consistent with \ndistribution of their liquidity needs by currency.  \nG) If an eligible liquid asset becomes ineligible (e.g. due to downgrade), NBFCs will be \nallowed to keep the asset in their stock of liquid assets for an additional 30 calendar days \nin order to have sufficient time to adjust the stock / replace the asset.  \n5) Total net cash outflows  \nA) Total net cash outflows  is defined as  the total expected cash outflows minus total \nexpected cash inflows for the subsequent 30 calendar days. Considering the unique nature \nof the balance sheet of the NBFCs, stressed cash flows is computed by assigning a \npredefined s tress percentage to the overall cash inflows and cash outflows. Total expected \ncash outflows (stressed outflows) are calculated by multiplying the outstanding balances of various categories or types of liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments by 115%  \n(15% being the rate at which they are expected to run off further or be drawn down). Total \nexpected cash inflows  (stressed inflows)  are calculated by multiplying the outstanding \nbalances of various categories of contractual receivables by 75% (25% being the rate at which they are expected to under -flow) . However, total cash inflows will be subjected to \nan aggregate cap of 75% of total expected cash outflows. In other words, t otal net cash \noutflows over the next 30 days = Stressed Outflows - Min ( stressed inflows; 75% of \nstressed outflows).  \nItems of  Cash  Inflows  Items of Cash Outflows  \na.

Where there is potential that an \nitem could be counted in multiple outflow categories  (e.g., committed liquidity facilities \ngranted to cover debt maturing within the 30 calendar day period), an NBFC only has to assume up to the maximum contractual outflow for that product.  \n6) LCR Disclosure Standards  \nA) NBFCs are required to disclose information on their LCR  every quarter. Further, NBFCs  \nin their annual financial statements under Notes to Accounts, starting with the financial year ending March 31, 2021 , shall  disclose information on LCR for  all the four quarters of \nthe relevant financial year.

RRBs were also advised \nvide circular RPCD.CO.RRB.BC.No.60/03.05.33/2013-14 dated November 26, 2013 , to achieve \nand maintain a minimum CRAR of 9 per cent on an ongoing basis with effect from March 31, \n2014.  \n2. With a view to providing RRBs additional options for augmenting regulatory  capital funds, so \nas to maintain the minimum prescribed CRAR , besides meeting the increasing business \nrequirements , it has been decided to allow RRBs  to issue  Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDIs ) \neligible for inclusion as Tier 1 capital. \nThe terms and conditions for  issue of Perpetual  Debt Instruments  (PDIs) are given in the Annex . \n    3. Capital Funds \nRRBs are required to maintain a minimum Capital to Risk -weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9 per \ncent on an ongoing basis. The capital funds for capital adequacy purpose shall consist of both \nTier 1 and Tier 2 capital .   \n2 \n \n \n3.1 Tier 1 Capital \n3.1.1 Common Equity (CET 1) Capital:  The elements of Common Equity Capital are, \na) Paid up share capital  \nb) Share capital deposit  \nc) Statutory and other disclosed free reserves  \nd) Capital Reserve representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of assets.  \ne) Any surplus (net) in profit and loss account i.e. balance after appropriation \n3.1.2 Additional Tier 1 Capital \nf) Perpetual Debt Instruments  \n3.1.3. Limits on Tier 1 capital \ni) The total Tier 1 capital should not be less than 7 per cent of risk weighted assets after the \nregulatory adjustment / deduction as per paragraph 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 below. \nii) Of the minimum  Tier 1 capital  of 7 percent, the Perpetual Debt Instruments  will be limited \nto 1.5 per cent of the total risk weighted assets.  \niii) Any additional amount raised through Perpetual Debt Instruments over and above the 1.5 \nper cent of the risk weighted assets will also be reckoned as Tier 1  capital provided the \nbank complies with the minimum Tier 1 capital of 7 percent of risk weighted assets  before \nreckoning such additional amounts.   \n \n3.1.4 Deductions from  Tier 1 Capital \nThe amount of intangible assets, losses in current year and those brought forward from previous years, deficit in NPA provisions, income wrongly recognized on non-performing \nassets, provision required for liability devolved on bank etc., shall  be deducted from Tier 1  \ncapital.  \n3.1.5 Treatment of deferred tax assets (DTAs)  \ni) Deferred tax assets (DTAs) associated with accumulated losses and other such assets \nshould be deducted in full from CET1 capital.  \nii) DTAs which relate to timing differences (other than those related to accumulated losses) \nmay, instead of full deduction from C ET1 capital, be recognized in the CET1 capital up to \n10% of a bank's CET1 capital [after the application of all regulatory adjustments].  \n3 \n \niii) The amount of DTAs which are to be deducted from CET1 capital may be netted with \nassociated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) provided: \n\u2022 Both the DTAs and DTLs relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and \noffsetting is permitted by the relevant taxation authority; \n\u2022 The DTLs permitted to be netted against DTAs must exclude amounts that have been \nnetted against the deduction of goodwill, intangibles and defined benefit pension \nassets; and  \n\u2022 The DTLs must be allocated on a pro rata basis between DTAs subject to deduction from CET1 capital as at (i) and (ii) above. \n4. Other Conditions \na) RRBs are not permitted to issue Perpetual Debt Instruments to retail investors / FPIs / \nNRIs.  \nb) RRBs are not permitted to invest in the Perpetual D ebt Instruments of other banks \nincluding RRBs . \nc) RRBs shall issue the Perpetual D ebt Instruments in Indian currency only.  \nThe other instructions in the circulars cited above remain unchanged.  \nYours faithfully, \n \n(Dr. S.  K. Kar) \nChief General Manager  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n4 \n \nAnnex \nTerms and Conditions a pplicable to Perpetual \nDebt Instruments ( PDI) to q ualify  for inclusion as Tier 1  Capital \nThe Perpetual Debt Instruments ( PDI) that may be issued as bonds or debentures by RRBs  \nshould meet the following terms and conditions to qualify for inclusion as Tier 1  Capital for capital \nadequacy purposes:  \n1. Terms of Issue of Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI)  \ni) Amount:   \nThe amount of PDI to be raised (in Indian Rupees only)  may be decided by the Board of \nDirectors of banks.  \nii) Limits: \nWithin minimum Tier 1 of 7 percent, t he Perpetual Debt Instruments  will be limited to 1.5 per \ncent of the total risk weighted assets. Any additional amount raised through Perpetual Debt \nInstruments over and above the 1.5 per cent of the risk weighted assets will also be reckoned \nas Tier 1  capital provided the bank complies with the minimum Tier 1  capital of 7 percent of \nrisk weighted ass ets before reckoning such additional amounts.   \niii) Maturity Period:  \nThe instruments shall be Perpetual. \niv) Rate of Interest:  \nThe interest payable to the investors shall  be either at a fixed rate or at a floating rate \nreferenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate.  \nThe instrument cannot have a credit sensitive coupon feature, i.e. a dividend that is reset \nperiodically based in whole or in part on the ban ks\u2019 credit standing. For this purpose, any \nreference rate including a broad index which is sensitive to changes to the bank\u2019s own creditworthiness and / or to changes in the credit worthiness of the wider banking sector will be treated as a credit sensitiv e reference rate. Banks\n desirous of offering floating  reference \nrate may take prior approval of the RBI as regard permissibility of such reference rates. \n  \n5 \n \n \nv) Options:  \nPDI shall not be issued with a 'put option' or a 'step-up option'. However RRBs  may issue \nthe instruments with a call option subject to strict compliance with each of the following \nconditions:  \na) Call option shall  be exercised only after the instrument has run for minimum five \nyears; and \nb) Call option shall be exercised only with the prior approval of RBI (Department of \nBanking Regulation). While considering the proposals received from RRBs  for \nexercising the call option the RBI would, among other things, take into consideration \nthe bank\u2019 s CRAR position both at the time of exercise of the call option and after \nexercise of the call option. \nvi) Lock -In Clause: \n(a) PDI should be subject to a lock -in clause in terms of which the issuing bank shall \nnot be liable to pay interest, if  \ni) The bank's CRAR is below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by \nRBI;  \n \nOr \n \nii) The impact of such payment results in bank's capital to risk assets ratio (CRAR) \nfalling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed \nby Reserve Bank of India.  \n(b) However, RRBs  may pay interest with the prior approval of RBI,  when the impact of \nsuch payment may result in net loss or increase the net loss, provided the CRAR \nremains above the regulatory norm. For this purpose \u2018Net Loss\u2019 would mean either (a) \nthe accumulated loss at the end of the previous financial year; or (b) the loss incurred \nduring the current financial year. \n(c)  The interest shall not be cumulative. \n  \n6 \n \n \n(d) All instances of invocation of the lock -in clause should be notified by the issuing \nbanks to the Chief General Manager , RRB Division, Department of Banking Regulation, \nReserve Bank of India and Department of Supervision, NABARD, Head Office, Mumbai.  \nvii) Seniority of Claim:  \nThe claims of the investors in PDI  shall be:  \na) Senior  to the claims of investors in equity shares; and  \nb) Subordinated to the claims of all other creditors. \nviii) Discount: \nThe PDI shall not be subjected to a progressive discount for capital adequacy purposes \nsince these are perpetual. \nix) Other Conditions:  \na) PDI should be fully paid-up, unsecured, and free of any restrictive clauses.  \nb) RRBs  should comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by SEBI / other \nregulatory authorities in regard to issue of the instruments. \n2.  Compliance with Reserve Requirements \nThe total amount raised by a bank through PDI shall not be reckoned as liability for \ncalculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, \nas such, will not attract CRR / SLR requirements. \n3.  Reporting Requirements \nRRBs  issuing PDI shall submit a report to Chief General Manager, Department of \nSupervision, NABARD, Head Office, Mumbai giving details of the debt raised, including the \nterms of issue specified at paragraph 1 above, together with a copy of the offer document \nsoon after the issue is completed. \n \n  \n7 \n \n \n4.  Investment in PDIs  \ni) RRB\u2019s  shall not invest in PDI  issued by other banks including RRBs .  \nii) RRBs shall not issue PDI to retail investors / F PI / NRIs. \n5.  Grant of Advances against PDI  \nRRBs  should not grant advances against the security of the PDI  issued by them.  \n6.  Classification in the Balance Sheet  \nRRBs  may indicate the amount raised by issue of PDI in the Balance Sheet under \u2018 Schedule \n4 \u2013 Borrowings \u2019.

The Reserve Bank maintains the directory of all bank branches / offices / Non-\nAdministratively Independent Offices (NAIOs) / Customer Service Points (CSPs) in India, \n[known as the \u201cMaster Office File\u201d (MOF) system], which is updated based on Proforma-I and \nProforma -II, submitted by banks through e-mail. The system allots Basic Statistical Return \n(BSR) code / Authorised Dealer (AD) code to bank branches / offices / NAIOs / CSPs.  \n3. Consistent with the needs of branch licencing and financial inclusion policies as well as the \nneed for requisite coverage of additional dimensions / features, a new reporting system, viz., \nCentral Information System for Banking Infrastructure  (CISBI) (https://cisbi.rbi.org.in ), has \nbeen web-deployed to replace the legacy MOF system.  \n4. Under the new system, all co-operative banks are required to submit their information in a \nsingle Proforma ( Annex -I) online on CISBI portal, as compared with the earlier system of \nsubmitting Proforma-I & Proforma -II separately through e- mail. The instructions for submission \nof new Proforma online are given in Annex -II. All the past information reported by banks has \nbeen migrated to CISBI and additional information should be reported in CISBI henceforth.  2 \nThe C\nISBI portal contains the relevant circulars, user manuals and other relevant documents to \nfacilitate reporting. \n5.\nThe Reserve Bank has provided login credentials to Nodal Officers of banks for submitting\ntheir information in CISBI. Access to CISBI can also be sought by making e-mail request  at\nm\nofbsd@rbi.org.in . Banks should submit information on CISBI portal as per guidelines given i n\nthe Annex -III, and thereafter bank branch / office / NAIO / CSP codes would be allotted by\nCISBI after due validations. In case of status change, banks need to edit only the relevant part.\nAll co -operative banks should submit immediately and in any case not later than one week ,\nthe information relating to opening, closure, merger, shifting and conversion of bank branches /\noffices / NAIOs / CSPs online through CISBI portal .\n6.To ensure correctness of data on CISBI, in the last week of every month, banks shall\ngener\nate a \u2018NIL Report\u2019 in CISBI for position as on last day of the previous month, indicating the\ntotal number of functioning branches, offices, NAIOs, CSPs; and submit it through CISBI afterauthenticating its correctness. Banks can also use the facility to access / download the dat\na\nr\nelated to them .\n7. It i\ns further advised that CISBI also has provision to maintain complete bank level details ( e.g.\nbank category, bank -group, bank code, type of license issued, registration details, area of\noperation, addresses of offices, contact details of senior officials, etc.) and history of all  the\nc\nhanges with time stamp. After gaining first time access of the system, banks shall ensure to\nsubmit correct and updated Bank Level information in all the fields where submission / updati on\nr\nights are available with the bank. After initial submission of information on CISBI portal, a one-\ntime confirmation stating that \u201cCorrect and updated Bank level information has been submi tted\non C\nISBI\u201d shall be sent by banks to the concerned Regional Office of Department of Co-\noperative Bank Supervision within one month of issuance of this circular. Any  subsequent\nchanges in the bank level information shall be submitted for updation on the CISBI portal onimmediate basis by the banks\n.\n8.

The Basic Statistical Returns ( BSR) codes (Part -\nI & Part -II) are allotted through the MOF system . \n \n2. Consistent with the needs of branch licencing and financial inclusion policies as well as the \nneed for requisite coverage of additional dimensions/features in a secure manner, the MOF \nsystem is replaced by a new web-based \u201c Central Information System for Banking \nInfrastructure (CISBI) \u201d. The Bank Branch Statistics Division (BBSD) in the Department of \nStatistics and Information Management (DSIM), Reserve Bank of India would be the nodal \nunit for CISBI and would co-ordinate with other RBI Departments, banks, other financial \ninstitutions and stakeholders. \n \n3. Under the new system, information related to Bank, Branch es, Office, NAIOs, other fixed \ncustomer service points (CSPs) ( e.g., ATMs,etc.) must be submitted in CISBI. For accessing \nCISBI, each bank is allotted two types of user IDs: (i) \u201cBank Admin ID\u201d and (ii) \u201cBank User ID\u201d. \nRBI(DSIM -BBSD) will create single \u201cBank Admin ID\u201d for each bank, who in turn would create \nmultiple \u201cBank User IDs\u201d. Banks can update information related to their bank by using \u201cBank \nAdmin ID\u201d and can report new branches/offices/NAIOs/CSPs or can report any change in \nstatus  / address, closure / merger  / conversion  / relocation  / upgradation, etc. of existing \nbranches  / offices  / NAIOs  / CSPs by using both the IDs. However, only \u201cBank Admin ID\u2019 (and \nnot \u201cBank User ID\u201d) can make changes in the information related to their Bank. \n \n4. All the co-operative banks  have to submit the above information in CISBI  which will be \nvalidated and published by RBI. For getting \u201cBank Admin ID\u201d, a bank should provide an \nauthorised email ID on which RBI(DSIM -BBSD) can forward \u201cBank Admin ID\u201d and its password \nin two different emails. A new bank seeking reporting access to CIS BI, should contact \nRBI(DSIM -BBSD) with a request letter providing details of the bank\u2019s nodal person, an email \nID for receiving the login credentials and certain basic documents as under : \na. Certificate of incorporation from the Registrar of Co-operative Soci eties  / Central \nRegistrar of Co-operative Societies . \nb. License / Authorization to carry on banking business  from RBI. \nc. A letter of commencement of business in India.  \nd. The Press release by RBI  regarding commencement of business.  \ne. A copy of registered Bye Laws.  \n \n5. Based on the documents, as mentioned above, RBI(DSIM -BBSD) will open an account of \nthe bank in CISBI system by filling its \u201cBasic Details\u201d in the system .  \n 2 \n 6. System will generate the \u201cBank Admin ID\u201d and will automatically send email notification of \n\u201cBank Ad min ID\u201d and its Password (in two separate emails) on the designated email ID of the \nbank . \n \n7. Bank should login on the CISBI portal ( https://cisbi.rbi.org.in ) using its allotted \u201cBank Admin \nID\u201d and change the allotted password on the first login.  \n \n8. Bank should fill all other information pertaining to the bank and  submit on the CISBI portal.  \nRBI will  validate and publish the information in CISBI.  \n \n9. After submission of the complete information related to the bank , CISBI will generate Bank -\nCode and Bank Working Code. \n \n10. After getting the Bank / Bank Working Code, the bank can create \u201cBank User ID\u201d for its \ninternal users. Management of \u201cBank User ID\u201d will remain the responsibility of the b ank. \n \n11. Banks can submit the information related to their new branch/office/NAIOs/CSPs  as per \nthe proforma by login through \u201cBank Admin ID\u201d or \u201cBank User ID\u201d . \n \n12. For reporting any change in the existing information, banks should edit the existing \ninformation and indicate the effective date of change. \n \n13. Banks can also use the facility to access/ download the data relating to them.  \n \n14. \u201cInstructions for Filling Proforma\u201d are given in Annex II. \n \n15. Bank s must reset the password every three months. In case the  password expires, or it \nis forgotten, they can login on CISBI and (a) Use \u201cBank Admin ID\u201d to reset the password for \nBank User ID\u201d and (b) contact CISBI helpdesk for resetting the password of \u201cBank Admin ID\u201d.  \n \n16. All the changes will be reflected in the system and accordingly will go in the database only \nafter the approval of RBI . \n \n17. Nil Report : Nil report will show the status of the bank in CISBI, i.e., total number of \nfunctioning branches  /offices/NAIO s/other fixed customer service points (CSPs) (ATMs  etc.) \nas on last day of the month as well as  opened/closed during the month. Report will be \ngenerated from CISBI itself and bank s will authenticate that the information in CISBI is correct \nand updated. If a bank finds any difference in the \u201cNil Report\u201d generated by CISBI and the \nactual status, it  should first update the information in CISBI, then generate \u201cNil Report\u201d and \nsubmit it through CISBI. (No hard copy is required) .  \n \n18. In the last week of every month, co-operative banks shall generate \u2018NIL Report\u2019  for \nposition as on last day of previous month, authenticate it and submit on CISBI.  For example, \n\u2018NIL Report\u2019  for the month of June 2019 shall be generated and submitted in the last week of \nJuly 2019.   \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI8111101967EBD14DB31A4483B4C3B8289EC9E60F.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 07, 2019", "info": " \n", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/EGS07102019EA5B7703056B428BA2DA5D6BBA8CEE6E.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "Oct 07, 2019", "info": " \nRBI/2019- 20/80 \nRef.No. IDMD/ 933/08.02.032/2019 -20                                                                  October 07 , 2019  \n  \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks  \nAll State Co -operative Banks/All Scheduled Primary  \n(Urban) Co -operative Banks /All Financial Institutions/  \nAll Primary Dealers.  \n  \nDear Sir/Madam,   \nAuction of Government of India Dated Securities  \n  \nGovernment of India has offered to sell (re-issue) four dated securities for  a notified amount of \n`16,000 crore  as per the following details:  \n \nSr \nNo Security Notified \nAmount  \n(in ` crore)  GoI Notification  Auction Date  Settlement \ndate \n1 7.32% GS 202 4 4,000 \n \nF.No.4(6) \nW&M/2019  dated \nOctober 07 , 2019  \nOctober 11 , \n2019 (Friday)  \nOctober 14 , \n2019 (Monday ) 2 7.57% GS 2033  6,000 \n3 7.69%  GS 2043  2,000 \n4 7.72%  GS 2049  4,000 \n  Total  16,000        \n \nSubject to the limit of ` 16,000 Cr being total notified amount, GoI will have the option to retain \nadditional subscription up to ` 1000 Cr each against any one or more of the above securities.  \n \nThe auction will be price based using multiple price method.

It has been observed that a large number  of customer complaints emanate on \naccount of unsuccessful or \u2018failed\u2019 transactions. Failure could be on account of \nvarious factors  not directly attributable to the customer  such as disruption of \ncommunication link s, non- availability of cash in ATMs, time- out of sessions, non-\ncredit to beneficiary \u2019s account due to various causes , etc.  Rectification / \nCompensation paid to the customer for these \u2018failed\u2019 transactions is not uniform.   \n 3. After consultation with various stakeholders, the framework for TAT for failed \ntransactions and compensation therefor  has been finalised which will result in \ncustomer confidence and bring in uniformity in processing of the failed \ntransactions. The same is encl osed as Annex\n to this circular.  \n  4. It may be noted that  :  \n \n\u2022 the prescribed TAT is the outer limit for resolution of failed transactions; \nand  \n\u2022 the banks and other  operators / system participants shall endeavour \ntowards quicker resolution of such failed transactions.  \n \n5. Wherever financial compensation is involved, the same shall be effected to the \ncustomer\u2019s account suo moto,  without waiting for a complaint or claim from the \ncustomer .  \n \n6. Customers who do not get the benefit of redress of the failure as defined in the \nTAT, can regi ster a complaint with the Reserve Bank - Integrated Ombudsman \nScheme, 2021  (as amended from time to time) .  \n \n7. This directive is issued under Section 10(2) read with Sect ion 18 of the \nPayment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007) and shall come into \neffect from October 15, 2019.  \n \nYours faithfully  \n \n \n(P. Vasudevan)  \nChief General Manager  \n Encl. : As above  \n   Annex \n(Annex to Circular DPSS.CO.PD No.629/02.01.014/2019-20 dated September 20, 2019)  \nHarmonisation of Turn Around Time (TAT) and customer compensation for \nfailed transactions using authorised Payment Systems \n \nGeneral Instructions covering the TAT : \n1. The principle behind the TAT is based on the following : \na. If the transaction is a \u2018 credit -push\u2019  funds transfer  and the beneficiary account \nis not credited while the debit to originator has been effected , then credit is to \nbe effected within the prescribed time period failing which the penalty has to \nbe paid to the beneficiary ; \nb. If there is delay in initiation of a transaction at the originator  bank\u2019s end \nbeyond the TAT, then penalty has to be paid to the originator.  \n \n2. A \u2018failed transaction \u2019 is a transaction which has  not been fully completed due to \nany reason not attribut able to the customer such as failure in communication \nlinks, non- availability of cash in an ATM, time- out of sessions, etc. Failed \ntransactions shall also include the credits which could not be effected to the \nbeneficiary account on account of lack  of full information or lack of proper \ninformation and delay in initiating a reversal transaction.  \n \n3. Terms like, Acquirer, Beneficiary, Issuer, Remitter, etc., have meaning s as per \ncommon banking parlance.  \n \n4. T is the day of transaction and refer s to the calendar date.  \n \n5. R is the day on which the reversal is concluded and the funds are received by \nthe        issuer  / originator . Reversal should be effected at the issuer  / originator \nend on the same day when the funds are received from  the beneficiary end.  \n \n6. The term bank includes non-banks also and applies to them wherever they are \nauthori sed to operate.  \n \n7. Domestic transactions i.e. , those where both the originator and beneficiary are \nwithin India are covered under  this framework.

It is, therefore, integral to the establishment\nof sound internal accounting functions and effective controls and is regarded as part of abank's early warning system to ensure timely detection of serious errors and irregularities,which also helps in averting fraudulent transactions  and preventive vigilance in banks.\n3.RBI has in the past,  been prescribing guidelines for scope, coverage of\nbusiness/branches, minimum items of coverage, etc. for concurrent auditors of banks .\nHowever, with the differing levels of centralization  in banks , diverse nature of activities\nundertaken by various banks and commencement of operations by small finance banksand payments banks, a common programme of work for concurrent audit applicable to all\nbanks may not be desirable.  Further, the Expert Committee (headed by Shri Y H\nMalegam) appointed by the Bank has  made certain recommendations in the area of\nConcurrent Audit. The existing guidelines on the subject have, therefore, been reviewed \nand the revised guidelines are given as under:  \nA. Coverage \ni. The scope of work to be entrusted to concurrent auditors , coverage of \nbusiness/branches, etc.  is left to the discretion of the head of internal audit of banks , \nwith the due prior approval of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (ACB)/Local Management Committee ((LMC) i n case of foreign banks ) of the bank.  \nii. Banks may, however,  ensure that risk sensitive  areas identified by them as per their \nspecific business model s are covered under concurrent audit . The detailed scope of \nthe concurrent audit may be determined and approved by the ACB /LMC . The broad \nareas of coverage under concurrent audit shall be based on the identified risk of the \nunit and must include random transaction testing of sufficiently large sample of such \ntransactions wherever required. Minimum areas of coverage are given in Annex\n.  \niii. Care may be taken to ensure that all Centralized Processing Centres (business origination and monitoring) are covered under concurrent audit . \nB. Appointment of Auditors  \ni. The option to consider whether concurrent audit should be done by bank's own staff or external auditors (which may include retired staff of its own bank) continues to be left to the discretion of individual banks.  \nii. The head of internal audit in the bank should participate in selection of concurrent auditors where such function is outsourced and should be responsible for the \nquality review (including skills of the staff employed) of the work of the concurrent auditors reporting to her/him. It may , however , be ensured that i f any partner of a \nChartered Accountant firm is a Director on the Board of a bank, no partner of the same firm should be appointed as concurrent auditor in the same bank.  \niii. In case the bank has engaged its own officials  as concurrent auditors , they should \nbe experienced, well trained and sufficiently senior.

We have now revised and updated the Master Circular which consolidates \nimportant instructions on the subject issued by the Reserve Bank of India till June 30, \n2019 . \n2. A copy of the revised Master Circular  is enclosed for your information. This circular \nmay also be downloaded from our website www.mastercirculars.rbi.org.in.  \nYours faithfully  \n \n(Charulatha S Kar)  \nChief General Manager  \n \nEncl.: As above  \n 2 \n Master Circular \u2013  Disbursement of Government Pension by Agency Banks \nIntroduction  \nPayment of pension to retired government employees, including payment of basic \npension, increased Dearness Relief (DR), and other benefits as and when announced by \nthe governments, is governed by the relevant schemes prepared by c oncerned \nMinistries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments. This Master \nCircular consolidates important instructions on the subject issued by the Reserve Bank \nof India till June 30, 2019 (listed in Appendix ). It does not replace or supersede any \nexisting  government instructions  on the matter . The instructions issued by Pension \nSanctioning Authority of the Central and State Governments and circulated by RBI in the \npast will continue to remain in operation subject  to changes being made by the competent \nauthority.  In case of any doubt  or apparent contradiction, agency banks may be guided \nby the relevant government instructions.  Contents of v arious circulars  issued in this \nconnection by the Reserve Bank of India are summarised hereunder . \nGeneral Instructions \nGovernment orders on DR, etc. on websites \n2. In order to obviate the time lag between issue of DR orders and payment of DR to the \nbeneficiary and to render expeditious service to senior citizens, the following act ions are \nrequired  to be taken:  \n(a) It has been decided to discontinue the procedure of forwarding government orders \nin respect of dearness relief etc. to pension paying agency banks.  Agency Banks \nmay, therefore, act on the copies of government orders supplied by government to \nthem through post, fax, e- mails or by accessing from the website and authorize \ntheir pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately.   \n(b) All agency banks are advised to scrupulously follow all the guidelines /instructions \ncontained in various notifications of Government (Central as well as States) and 3 \n take necessary action immediately without waiting for any further instructions from \nRBI.   \nStaggering  of pension payments   \n3. Payment of pension only on the last day of the month causes much hardship to \npensioners as they have to wait in queue for a long time to collect their pension. As per \ninstructions issued in 1995, agency banks were advised to spread disbursal of pension \nover the last four working days of the month, except for the month of March, which will \ncontinue to be credited on or after the first working day of April.  \nRecovery of excess/wrong payment made to a pensioner   \n4. Details of the unifor m procedure for recovery of excess/wrong payments made to \npensioners drawing pensions under the Scheme for payment of pension to Central \n/Civil/Defence/Railways pensioners through agency banks, have been put in place by RBI \nin consultation with G overnment of India are given below:  \n(a) As soon as the excess/wrong payment made to a pensioner comes to the notice \nof the paying branch, the branch should adjust the same against the amount \nstanding to the credit to the pensioner\u2019s account to the extent possible including \nlumpsum arrears payment. \n \n(b) If the entire amount of overpayment cannot be adjusted from the account, the \npensioner may be asked to pay forthwith the balance amount of overpayment.  \n \n(c) In case the pensioner expresses his inability to pay the amount, the same may be \nadjusted from the future pension payments to be made to the pensioners. For \nrecovering the overpayment made to pensioner from his future pension payment \nin instalments 1/3rd of net (pension + relief) payable each month may be recovered \nunless the pensioner concerned gives c onsent in writing to pay a higher instalment \namount.  \n 4 \n (d) If the overpayment cannot be recovered from the pensioner due to his death or \ndiscontinuance of pension,  then action has to be taken as per the letter of \nundertaking given by the pensioner under the scheme.  \n \n(e) The pensioner may also be advised about the details of over payment/wrong \npayment and mode of its recovery.  \nRefund of excess pension payment to Government   \n5.  Whenever any excess / overpayment is detected the entire amount thereof should \nbe credited to the Government account in lump sum immediately when the \nexcess/overpayment is due to an error on the part of the agency bank.  This action is \nindependent of recov ery from the pensioner.   \n6. If the excess/wrong payment to the pensioner is due to errors committed by the \ngovernment, banks may take up the matter with the full particulars of the cases with \nrespective Government Department for a quick resolution of the m atter. However, this \nmust be a time bound exercise and the government authority\u2019s acknowledgement to this \neffect must be kept on the bank\u2019s record. The banks may take up such cases with \ngovernment departments without reference to the Reserve Bank of India.  \nWithdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners  \n7. In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners in \nwithdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorise  \nsuch pensioners as under:  \n(a) Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the \nbank . \n \n(b) Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also not \neven able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/  withdrawal form due to \ncertain physical defect / incapacity.   5 \n 8. With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their \naccounts, banks may follow the procedure as under:  \n(a) Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should \nbe identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom \nshould be a responsible bank official.  \n \n(b) Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also \nwould not be able to be physically present i n the bank, a mark can be obtained on \nthe cheque/withdrawal form, which should be identified by two independent \nwitnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official.  \n9. Accordingly, the agency banks are requested to instruct their branches to displ ay \nthe instructions issued in this regard on their notice board so that sick and disabled \npensioners could make full use of these facilities. Agency Banks are also advised to \nsensitise staff members in the matter and to refer to the FAQs on pension disburs ement \nhosted on our website www.rbi.org.in in case of any doubt.  \nReimbursement of pension payments \n10. Link branches of agency banks may submit reimbursement claims to Reserve Bank \nof India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur  / Government Banking Division at Regional \nOffice  for Central/State Government pension payments.  \nContinuation of either or survivor pension account after death of pensioner   \n11. All agency banks disbursing Central Government pension have bee n advised that in \ncase the spouse (Family pensioner) opts for existing joint account for credit of family \npension, banks should not insist on opening a new account when the spouse is the \nsurvivor and having a joint account with the pensioner and in whose f avour an \nauthorisation for payment of family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO).  \n 6 \n Digital Life Certificate   \n12. There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of pension \npaying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order \nto alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to \nmandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also advised to consider \nentering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated \nacknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as \nreal time updation of records.   \nSingle Window System for reimbursement of Pension Payments  \n13. Single  Window System was introduced to facilitate prompt settlement of \nreimbursement claims and reconciliation. The underlying objective is to make each \npension paying bank responsible in its own right to effect settlement without the \nintervention of RBI Offices or SBI (at District Headquarters) in the process eliminating cause of delay in reimbursement claims.  \nCustomer Service \n14. All agency banks may issue instructions to their dealing branches to adhere to the \nrecommendations of the Prabhakar Rao Committee relating to pension payments . A \nchecklist may be provided to the inspecting officers/auditors, which may at a minimum \ninclud e the items given in Annex 1 . Agency banks may also instruct their internal \nauditors/inspectors to comment on the quality of customer service in their reports which \nmay be made available to Reserve Bank\u2019s inspecting officers, as and when they visit the \nbranches.  \n15. Grievances of pensioners are not being addressed properly at the branch level \nespecially after the setting up of Centralised Pension Processing Centres (CPPCs). To \nprovide hassle free service to the pensioners, there shoul d be a forum for regular \ninteraction and settlement of grievances. Accordingly, agency banks should appoint \none/two nodal officers at each Region/Zone for monitoring the resolution of grievances of 7 \n pensioners on regular basis and the GM/CGM concerned shoul d review the position at \nmonthly intervals  \n16. At locations outside the CPPCs, there should be designated nodal officers for pension \nrelated complaints who should be easily accessible to pensioners and who should hold \nregular meetings at different locations in their jurisdiction on the lines of Pension Adalat. \nEach bank should establish toll free dedicated pension line manned by trained persons \nwith access to the database to answer queries, note down and redress complaints.   \n17. Following several complaints from pensioners alleging inordinate delay in disbursing \nrevised pension and arrears, agency banks a re advised as under:  \n(a) Pension paying banks should compensate the pensioner for delay in crediting \npension/ arrears thereof at a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for the \ndelay after the due date of payment and the compensation shall be credited to the \npensioner's account automatically without any claim from the pensioner on the \nsame day when the bank affords credit for r evised pension/ pension arrears, in \nrespect of all delayed pension payments made since October 1, 2008.   \n(b) Pension paying banks have been advised to put in place a mechanism to obtain \nimmediately the copies of pension orders from the pension paying authoriti es \ndirectly and make payments without waiting for receipt of instructions from the \nReserve Bank  of India  so that pensioners should get benefits announced by the \nGovernments in the succeeding month's pension payment itself.   \n(c) When the agency bank is calculat ing pension, t he branch should continue to be a \npoint of referral for the pensioner lest he/she feel disenfranchised.   \n(d) All branches having pension accounts should guide and assist the pensioners in \nall their dealings with the bank.   \n(e) Suitable arrangements should be made to place the arithmetic and other details \nabout pension calculations on the web, to be made available to the pensioners \nthrough the net or at the branches at periodic interval as may be necessary and \nsufficient advertisement is made about such arrangements.   8 \n (f) All claims for agency commission by banks  in respect of pension payments must \nbe accompanied by a certificate from ED/CGM in charge of government business \nthat there are no pension arrears to be credited/ delays in crediting regular \npensi on/arrears thereof.   \n(g) All agency banks disbursing pension are advised to provide considerate and \nsympathetic customer service to the pensioners, especially  to those pensioners \nwho are of old age.   \n \n \n \n \n \n

The final report of the ISG was published in October 2017  for public \nfeedback . The ISG observed that i nternal benchmarks such as the B ase rate/MCLR \nhave not delivered eff ective transmission of monetary policy.

In this regard, it is advised that Government of India has now issued the operational \nguidelines of the Interest Subvention Scheme for  Kisan Credit Card facility to fisheries and \nanimal husbandry farmers for a period of two year s i.e. 2018 -19 and 2019- 20 with the \nfollowing stipulations:   \n \ni. In order to provi de short -term loans upto \u20b9 2 lakh to f armers  involved in activities \nrelated to Animal Husbandry and Fisheries , through  a separate KCC for these \nactivities,  apart from the existing KCC for crop loan, at a concessional interest rate \nof 7% per annum during the year s 2018- 19 and 2019- 20, it has been decided to \nprovide interest subvention of 2% per annum to lending institutions viz. Public \nSector Banks (PSBs) and Private Sector Commercial Banks (in respect of loans \ngiven by their rural and semi -urban branches only)  on use of their own resources . \nThis interest subvention of 2%  will be calculated on the loan amount from the date \nof its disbursement  / drawal upto the date of actual repayment of the loan by the  \nfarmer or up to the due date of the loan fixed by the banks , whichever is earlier, \nsubject to a maximum period of one year.  In case of farmers possessing KCC for \n \n raising crops and involved in activities related to animal husbandry and/or fisheries, \nthe KCC for animal husbandry/fisheries shall be within the overall limit of \u20b9  3 lakh.  \nii. To provide an additional interest subvention of  3% per annum to such of those \nfarmers repaying in time i .e. from the d ate of disbursement of the working capital \nloan upto the actual date of repayment by farmers or upto the due date fixed by \nthe bank s for repayment of loan, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period \nof one year from the date of disbursement. This al so implies that the farmers \nrepaying promptly  as above would get short term loans @ 4% per annum during \nthe year s 2018- 19 and 2019- 20. This benefit would accrue to only those farmers \nwho repay their both  short term crop loan and working capital loan for animal \nhusbandry/fisheries activities in time.   \niii. Interest subvention is to be provided on a maximum limit of \u20b9 2 lakh short term \nloan to farmers involved in animal husbandry and fisheries. The farmers already possessing KCC (crop loan) and involved in animal husbandry & fisheries  \nactivities, can avail a sub- limit for such act ivities. However, the i nterest subvention \nand prompt r epayment i ncentive benefit on short term loan (i.e. crop loan+ working \ncapital loan for animal husbandry and fisheries) will be available only on an overall limit of \u20b9 3 lakh per annum and subject to a maximum limit of \u20b9 2 lakh per farmer \ninvolved in activities only  related to animal husbandry and / or fisheries. The limit \nfor crop loan component will take priority for interest subvention and prompt \nrepayment incentive benefits and the residual amount will be considered \ntowards animal husbandry and / or  fisheries subject to cap as mentioned \nabove.

To ensure hassle- free benefits to farmers under  Interest Subvention Scheme,  \nbanks  are advised to make Aadhar linkage mandat ory for availing short -term loans  \nfor Animal Husbandry and Fisheries  in 2018- 19 and 2019- 20.  \nv.

Recurring transactions based \non standing instructions given to the merchants by the cardholders  were brought within the ambit \nof AFA, vide RBI \u2019s circular DPSS.PD.CO .No.223/ 02.14.003/2011-2012 dated August 4, 2011 . \n \n2. The RBI has been receiving requests from industry stakeholders to allow processing of e-\nmandate on cards for recurring transactions with AFA during e -mandate registration and first \ntransaction,  and simple / automatic subsequent successive transactions . Keeping in view the \nchanging payment needs and the requirement to balanc e the safety and security of card \ntransactions with customer convenience, it  has been decided to permit processing of e-mandate \non cards for recurring transactions  (merchant payments)  with AFA during e -mandate registration,  \nmodification and revocation, as also for the first transaction,  and simple / automatic  subsequent \nsuccessive transactions , subject to conditions listed in the Annex .  \n 3. This circular is applicable for transactions performed using all types of cards \u2013  debit, credit \nand Prepaid Payment Instrum ents (PPIs), including wallets.  \n \n4. The maximum permissible limit for a transaction under this arrangement shall be `  2,000/-\n.  \n \n5. All other instructions related to card transactions shall be applicable on these e-mandate \nbased recurring card transactions.  2 \n 6. No charges shall be levied or recovered from the cardholder  for availing the e-mandate \nfacility on cards for r ecurring transactions.  \n \n7. This directive, issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and \nSettlement Systems Act , 2007 (Act 51 of 2007), will come into effect from September 1, 2019. \n \n8. This facility may  be reviewed,  in due course,  for extension to other digital modes of \npayments.  \n \nYours faithfully , \n \n \n \n(P. Vasudevan)  \nChief General Manager  \n \nEncl: As above  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  3 \n Annex \nConditions to be fulfilled for  processing e-mandate on cards for recurring transactions  \n(DPSS. CO. PD. No. 447 / 02.14.003 / 2019 - 20 dated August 21, 2019)  \n \nApplicability \n1. The e-mandate arrangement on cards  shall be only for recurring  transactions and not for \na \u2018once-only\u2019 payment.  \n \nRegistration of card details for  e-mandate based recurring transactions \n2. A cardholde r desirous of  opting for e-mandate facility  on card shall undertake a one- time \nregistration process , with AFA validation by the issuer.

The facility to modify the validity period of the e- mandate at a later stage, if required, shall also \nhas to be provided for .  \n 4. During the registration process, the cardholder shall be given an option to provide the e-\nmandate for either a pre-specified  fixed value of recurring transaction or for a variable value of \nthe recurring transaction;  in the case of the latter, the cardholder shall  clearly specify the maximum \nvalue of recurring transactions, subject to the overall cap fixed by the RBI (currently ` 2,000/- per \ntransaction).  \n \n5. Any modification in existing e-man date shall entail AFA validation by the issuer.  \n \nProcessing of f irst transaction and subsequent recurring transactions \n6. While processing the first transaction in e -mandate based recurring transaction series, \nAFA validation shall be performed. I f the first transaction is being performed along with the \nregistration of e-mandate, then AFA validation may be combined. All such AFA validation shall be \nas per extant instructions of the RBI . \n \n7. Subsequent recurring transactions shall be performed only for those cards which have \nbeen successfully registered and for which the first transaction was successfully authenticated \nand authorised. These subsequent transactions may be performed without AFA. \n \nPre-transaction notification \n8. As a risk mitigant and customer  facilitation measure, the issuer shall send a pre-\ntransaction notification to the cardholder, at least 24 hours prior to the actual  charge / debit to the \ncard. While registering e-mandate on the card, the cardholder  shall be given facility to choose a \nmode among available options (SMS, email, etc.)  for receiving  the pre -transaction notification  \nfrom the issuer  in a clear, unambiguous manner  and in an understandable language. The facility 4 \n for changing this mode of receiving pre-transaction notification,  shall also be provided to the \ncardholder .  \n \n9. The pre-transaction  notification shall, at the minimum, inform the cardholder about the \nname of the merchant, transaction amount, date / time of debit,  reference number of transaction/  \ne-mandate, reason for debit, i.e., e- mandate registered by the cardholder . \n \n10. On receipt of the pre-transaction notification, the cardholder shall have the facility to opt-\nout of that particular transaction or the e -mandate. Any such opt-out shall entail AFA validation \nby the issuer. On receipt of intimation of such an opt-out,  the issuer shall ensure that the particular \ntransaction is not effected / further recurring transactions are not effected  (as the case may be) . \nA confirmation intimation to this effect shall be sent to the cardholder.  \nPost -transaction notification \n11. In line with the extant instructions, the issuer  shall send post -transaction alert / notification \nto the cardholder . This notification shall, at the minimum, inform the cardholder about the name \nof the merchant, transaction amount, date / time of debit,  reference number of transaction / e-\nmandate, reason for debit,  i.e., e-mandate registered by the cardholder.  \n \nTransaction limit and velocity check \n12. The cap / limit for e-mandate based recurring  transaction s without AFA  will be  ` 2,000/-\nper transaction.  Transactions above this  cap shall be subject to AFA as hitherto. \n \n13. The limit of ` 2,000/- per transaction is  applicable for all categories of merchants who \naccept repetitive payments based on such e-mandates.   \n \n14. Suitable velocity chec ks and other risk mitigation procedures  shall be put in place by \nissuers . \n \nWithdrawal of  e-mandate  \n15. The issuer shall provide the cardholder  an online facility to withdraw any e -mandate at any \npoint of time following which  no further recurring transactions shall be allowed for the withdrawn \ne-mandate. (Note: The exception to this will be a pipeline  transaction for which pre- transaction \nnotification has already been sent to the cardholder , but the debit has not been communicated to \nor received by the cardholder , and the e-mandate withdrawal happens during the inter regnum .) \nInformation about this facility to withdraw e-mandate at any point of time,  shall be clearly  \ncommunicated to the cardholder  at the time of registr ation and later on whenever felt necessary . \n \n16. The withdrawal of any e-mandate by the cardholder  shall entail AFA validation by the \nissuer.  \n \n17. In respect of withdrawn e-mandate/s, the ac quirers shall ensure that the merchants  on-\nboarded by them,  delete all details, including payment instrument information.  \n 5 \n Dispute resolution and grievance redressal \n18. An appropriate redress system shall be put in place by the issuer  to facilitate the \ncardholder to lodge grievance/s . Card networks shall also put in place dispute resolution \nmechanism for resolving these disputes  with clear Turn Around Time (TAT).   \n \n19. The card networks shall m ake suitable arrangements  to separately  identify chargeback s / \ndispute requests  in respect of e-mandate based recurring transactions.  \n \n20.

The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the \nCentr al and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the \nagency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual \nagreement. RBI pays agency commission to the a gency banks for the gover nment \nbusiness handled by them. T his Master Circular consolidates the instructions \ncontained in the circulars listed in Annex  1. \nGovernment transactions eligible for a gency commission \n2. Transactions relating to the following government business undertaken by \nagency banks are eligible for agency commission paid by RBI : \n(a) Revenue receipts and payments on behalf of the Central/State Government  \n(b) Pension payments in respect of Central / State Governments  and \n(c) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank as eligible for \nagency commission (viz. Relief Bonds/ Savings Bonds etc. transactions)  \n \nThe Agency banks also undertake the work related to Small Savings Schemes t he \ncommission for which is borne by Government of India.  However, the settlement of \nsuch commission continues to be processed by RBI.  Agency commission claims on \nSpecial Deposit Scheme ( SDS) related transactions (where mirror accounts are \nmaintained in RBI) are settled at Central Accounts Section (CAS), Nagpur and not in \nrespective Regional Offices of RBI . \n3. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from \nfinancial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commission as these transactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business.  \nReserve Bank  pays the agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for \nacting as agents for management of public debt.  \n4. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical mode or e- mode \n(challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the agency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive remuneration from the State Government for doing this work.  \n5. If the agency bank is engaged by the State Government as Franking Vendor \nand it collects stamp duty from t he public for franking the documents, it will not be \neligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to it as Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects  the stamp duty paid \nby the Franking Vendor for credit to t he Treasury through challan in physical or e-\nmode for purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since \nit is a regular payment of Stamp Duty as stated above.  \n  3 \n Government transactions not eligible for agency commission \n6. Agency ba nks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or \nthrough authorised branches of State Bank of India or offices of Reserve Bank of \nIndia wherever they do not have their own authorised direct tax collection branch \nshould indicate the same s eparately in the scroll. Such transactions will not be \neligible for payment of agency commission. Banks should furnish a certificate to the effect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) paid by them have been \nexcluded while claiming agency c ommission.  \n7. The following activities do not come under the purview of agency bank \nbusiness and are therefore not eligible for payment of agency commission.  \n(a) Furnishing of bank guarantees/security deposits, etc . through agency  banks \nby government contract ors/suppliers, which constitute banking transactions \nundertaken by banks for their customers.  \n(b) The banking business of autonomous/statutory bodies /Municipalities / \ncompanies/  Corporations/Local Bodies.    \n(c) Payments which have been classified as capital in nature by government to \ncover losses incurred by autonomous/statutory bodies / Municipalities/ \nCorporations/Local Bodies , etc..  \n(d) Prefunded schemes which may be implemented by a Central Government \nMinistry/Department (in consultation with CGA) and a State Government Department through any bank .  \n(e) Transactions related to Gold Monetisation Scheme 2015  \n \n(f) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank or Central or \nState Government as ineligible for agency commission   \n(g) Transactions arising out of Letter s of Credit / Bank Guarantee opened by \nbanks on behalf of Ministries/Departments etc. do not qualify for agency \ncommi ssion as RBI only reimburses the paid amount to the banks based on \nthe mandate received from the governments.  \n \n8. All agency bank s while claiming agency commission should certify that no \nclaim of agency  commission is made on ineligible transactions . \n \nReporting of transactions by agency banks to RBI  \n9. With effective from February 1, 2019, agency banks authorised to collect GST \nshall up load their luggage files in RBI\u2019s QPX/E -Kuber on all days except on \nNEFT/RTGS holidays (including Sundays and non- working Saturdays).  4 \n 10. State government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) of \nprevious month reported after 8th of the succeeding month and those pertaining to \nearlier months should be reported to RBI through a separate statement for \naccounting, after being confirmed by the competent authorities of concerned state \ngovernment.  \n11. For Central Government transactions (electronic as w ell as in physical mode) \nor any adjustments thereof , if reported after a gap of 90 days from the date of \ntransaction, agency banks have to obtain prior approval from concerned ministry/department and submit the same to RBI separately at the time of reporti ng \nsuch transactions for settlement.   \nRates for agency commission \n12. As per a gency bank agreement, RBI pays agency commiss ion at rates \ndetermined by it. The rates applicable with effect from July 1, 2019 are as under:  \nSr. No. Type of Transaction  Unit Revised Rate \na.  (i) Receipts - Physical mode  Per transaction  \u20b9 40/- \n     (ii) Receipts - e-mode  Per transaction   \u20b9 9/- \nb. Pension Payments  Per transaction  \u20b9 75/- \nc. Payments other than \nPension  Per   \u20b9 100 \nturnover  6.5 paise  \n 13. In this context, the \u2018Receipts -e-mode transactions\u2019 indicated against Sr. No. \na.(ii) in  the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from \nthe remitter\u2019s bank account through internet banking as well as such transactions  \nwhich do not involve physical  recei pt of cash /instruments  at all . For example,  \nchallan generated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with cash / \ninstrument should be treated as transaction under physical mode.   \n 14. With reference to the implementation of Goods and Service Tax ( GST) \nregime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number \n(CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if \nmultiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This \nmeans that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records clubbed under a single challan \ni.e., CPIN have to be t reated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming \nagency commission effective J uly 1, 2017.  \n \n15. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that \na single challan ( electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only \nand not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains multiple major head/sub \nmajor head/minor head of accounts that will get credited.  Therefore, records clubbed 5 \n under a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single \ntransaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission.   \n16. Agency banks would be eligible to claim agency commission for pension \ntransactions at the rate of \u20b975 per transaction only when the entire work relating to \ndisbursement of pension including p ension calculation is attended to by them .  If the \nwork relating to pension calculations, etc., is attended to by the concerned \nGovernment Department  / Treasury and the bank s are required only to credit the \namount of pension to the pensioners' accounts mai ntained with them by a single \ndebit to Government Account, such transaction is to be categori sed under \u2018other than \npension payment\u2019 and would be eligible for payment of agency commission @ 6.5 \npaise per \u20b9  100/- turnover w.e.f. July 1, 2019 . \n17. The number of transactions eligible for payment of agency commission should \nnot exceed 14 per pensioner per year.  This includes one monthly credit for payment \nof net pension and a maximum of two per year for payment of arrears on account of \nincrease in dearness relief, if applicable. Cases involving payment of arrears on \naccount of late start/restart of pension qualifies as a single transaction for claiming of agency commission. In other words, any payment of arrears on account of late \nstart/restart of pension should be treated as a single credit transaction and not as \nseparate monthly credits.  \n18. Agency commission is payable to an agency bank at the full rate provided the \ntransactions are handled by the bank at all stages .  Where, however, the work is \nshared between two banks, the agency commission is shared between the banks in \nthe proportion of 75:25.  Thus, broadly, the agency commission is payable to the \nagency  banks as detailed below:  \n(a) At the full rate, in cases where the transactions are handled by the bank at all \nstages, i.e. , up to the stage of dispatch of scrolls and challans / cheques to the \nPay and Accounts Offices,  and treasuries/sub- treasuries .  \n(b) At 75% of the applicable  rate, where the dealing branch is required to account \nfor the transaction by passing on the scrolls and documents to the \nlocal/nearest branch of Reserve Bank of India or by any agency bank \nconducting government business.  \n(c) At 25% of the applicable rate, in the case of agency branch which received the \nscrolls and documents from dealing branches of other banks and is \nresponsible for the account ing of these transactions and dispatching of the \nscrolls and documents to the Pay and Accounts Offices, Treasuries, etc.  \n19. All agency banks should settle their agency transactions for both funds and \nagency commission directly with the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank instead of routing them through any other agency bank that acts as aggregator in \ncertain cases.\n So also for payments made by all agency banks on behalf of state \ngovernment/s get directly settled with the concerned Regional Office of RBI. Agency \nTransaction details/scrolls may be sent directly by individual agency bank to the 6 \n concerned State Government/Treasury.  This new arrangement for settlement of state \ngovernment funds on day to day basis (receipts and payments) directly with Reserve \nBank is with effect from January 1, 2018.  \n \nClaiming agency commission  \n20. Agency banks are required to submit their claims for agency commission in \nthe prescribed format to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions and the respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for  State government \ntransactions.  However, agency commission claims with respect to GST receipt \ntransactions will be settled at Mu mbai Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India only \nand accordingly all agency banks, authorized to collect GST, are advised to submit their agency commission claims pertaining to GST receipt transactions at Mumbai \nRegional Office only. The revised formats for claiming agency commission for all \nagency banks and separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the \nbranch officials and Chartered Accountants are given in Annex 2, Annex 2A\n and \nAnnex 2B  respectively . These certificates would be in addition to the usual Certificate \nfrom ED / CGM (in charge of government business) to the effect that there are no pension arrears to be credited / delays in crediting regular pension / arrears thereof . \n21. Where the External Auditor is also the Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor, \nclaims can be certified by such Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor. In addition to \nthis, agency banks are required to ensure that the agency  bank\u2019s internal inspectors / \nauditors verify the agency commission claims submitted by their branches and confirm their accuracy during the course of their inspection / audit.   \n 22. Reference is also drawn to the instructions contained in our letter dated \nNovember 4, 2016 advising the process of claiming reimbursement of service tax \n(ST) on agency commission received for Central and State Government transactions, \ncentrally from Reserve Bank of India at Central Accounts Section, Nagpur. The same process continued even after S ervice Tax got subsumed into the G oods and S ervice \nTax (GST) framework. This process of centralised claims submission has been \nreplaced with a system whereby applicable GST (18% at present) shall be paid along \nwith agency commission by the respective Regional Offices of RBI / CAS, Nagpur as the case may be.  \n 23. For eligible government transactions done with effect from July 01, 2019, \nagency banks shall submit the agency commission claims, including applicable GST amount, as per revised agency c ommission rates indicated above, to RBI at \nrespective ROs / CAS, Nagpur as per the extant instructions issued by RBI in this regard. TDS on GST shall be deducted as applicable by RBI at the time of making \nagency commission payment  in accordance with Government instructions in the \nmatter . \n 7 \n 24. However, for eligible government transactions done by agency banks upto \nJune 30, 2019, agency banks shall continue to submit agency commission claims as \nwell as the centralized claims for ST/GST reimbursement as hitherto.  \n25. Agency banks are required to ensure that agency commission claims \nsubmitted to the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India / Central Accounts \nSection, Nagpur as applicable in the prescribed format are accurate.  Agency banks \nmay also alert their branches  concerned to ensure that agency commission claims \nsubmitted to our Regional Offices are accurate.  Such erroneous claims, if certified by the Internal / Concurrent Auditors, will defeat the very purpose of making such \nrequirement an essential condition for making quarterly claims.  \n26. Agency banks are advised to furnish their claim on agency commission to \nReserve Bank within 60 calendar days from the end of the quarter in which the \ntransactions have been conducted.  If the banks fail to lodge the claims within the \nstipulated period mentioned above they may forward the same to RBI only after \ngiving reasons for delay.   \n  \nPenal interest for wrong claims \n 27.  As per the agreement that agency banks have with RBI, violation or non-\ncompliance of inst ructions issued by G overnment or  Reserve Bank shall attract \nimposition of penalty.  Agency banks will be liable to pay penal interest at Bank Rate \nas notified by Reserve Bank of India plus 2% for any wrong claims of agency \ncommission settled.  \n \n  \n \n 8 \n Annex 1 \nList of circulars consolidated in the Master Circular  \n \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

The Study Group drew attention to the fact that commercial banks did not \nhave adequate presence in rural areas and also lacked the required rural orientation. \nThe St udy Group, therefore, recommended the adoption of an 'Area Approach' to \nevolve plans and programmes for the development of an adequate banking and \ncredit structure in the rural areas.  \n(ii)  A Committee of Bankers on Branch Expansion Programme of P ublic Sector \nBanks appointed by the Reserve Bank of India under the Chairmanship of Shri F. K. \nF. Nariman (Nariman Committee) endorsed the idea of an \u2018A rea Approach\u2019  in its \nreport (November 1969) , recommending that in order to enable the P ublic Sector \nBanks to dis charge their social responsibilities, each bank should concentrate on \ncertain districts where it should act as a 'Lead Bank'.       \n(iii)  Pursuant to the above recommendations, the Lead Bank Scheme was \nintroduced by the Reserve Bank of India in December 1969.  The Scheme aims at \ncoordinating the activities of banks and other developmental agencies through various fora in order to achieve the objective of enhancing the flow of bank finance to  \nthe priority sector and other sectors and to promote banks ' role in the overall \ndevelopment of the rural sector.  For coordinating the activities in the district, a \nparticular bank is assigned \u2018L ead Bank\u2019 responsibility of the district. The Lead Bank \nis expected to assume a leadership role for coordinating the efforts of the credit \ninstitutions and the Government.    \n(iv)  In view of the several changes that had taken place in the financial sector, the \nLead Bank Scheme was last reviewed by the High Level Committee headed by Smt . \nUsha Thorat, the then Deputy Governor  of the Reserve Bank of India in 2009.   \n(v)  The High Level Committee held wide ranging discussions with various \nstakeholders viz. State Governments, banks, development institutions, academicians, NGOs, MFIs etc. and noted that the Scheme has been useful in \nachieving its original objectives of improvement in branch expansion, deposit 4 \n \nmobilisation and lending to the priority sector, especially in rural/semi urban areas.  \nThere was overwhelming consensus that the Scheme needs to continue.  Based on \nthe recommendati ons of the Committee, the guidelines were issued to SLBC \nConvenor  banks  and Lead B anks for implementation.  \n \n(vi)   Envisaging greater role for private sector banks,  Lead B anks were advised to \nensure that private sector banks are more closely involved in the implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme.  P rivate sector banks should involve themselves more \nactively by leveraging on Information Technology bringing in their expertise in strategic planning.  They should also involve themselves in the preparation as well \nas implementation of  the District Credit Plan.  \n \n(vii)  In view of the changes that  have taken place in  the financial sector over the \nyears, the Reserve Bank of India had constituted a \u201cCommittee of Executive Directors\u201d of the Bank to study the efficacy  of the Scheme and suggest measures for \nits improvement. Based on the Committee\u2019s recommendations and feedback received from various stakeholders, certain \u2018action points\u2019 were issued to SLBC Convenors/Lead Banks and NABARD on April 6, 2018.  \n \n \n2.  Fora under Lead Bank Scheme \n2.1     Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC)  \nBlock Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) is a forum for achieving coordination \nbetween credit institutions and field level development agencies at the block level . \nThe forum prepares and reviews  the implementation of the Block Credit Plan and \nalso resolves operational problems in the implementation of the credit programmes \nof banks. The Lead District Manager (LDM) of the district is the Chairman of the \nBlock Level Bankers\u2019 Committee. All the bank s operat ing in the block including the \nSmall Finance Banks, the D istrict Central Co-operative Banks , RRB s, Block \nDevelopment Officer, technical officers in the block, such as extension officers for \nagriculture, industries and co- operatives are members of t he Committee. BLBC \nmeetings are held at quarterly intervals.  To strengthen the BLBC forum which \noperates at the base level of the Lead Bank Scheme, it is necessary that all branch managers attend BLBC meetings and enrich the discussions with their valuabl e \ninputs. Controlling Heads of banks may also attend a few of the BLBC meetings 5 \n \nselectively. Participation by the District Development Manager (DDM) of NABARD in \nBLBCs would ensure better and more meaningful discussions for the development of \nthe Block. Therefore, NABARD has been advised that  DDMs should attend all Block \nLevel Bankers\u2019 Committee meetings in their district and actively participate in the \ncredit planning exercise and review meetings at the block level.  The Lead District \nOfficer (LDO ) of the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI) selectively attends the BLBC \nmeetings. The representatives of Panchayat Samitis are also invited to attend the \nmeetings at half yearly intervals so as to share their knowledge and experience on \nrural development in the credit pl anning exercise. Payments Banks should also be \ninvited to attend the meetings.  \n \n2.2 District Consultative Committee (DCC)  \n2.2.1 Constitution of DCC  \nThe District Consultative Committees  were constituted in the early seventies  as a \ncommon forum at the district level for bankers as well as Government \nagencies/departments to facilitate  coordination in implementing various \ndevelopmental activities under the Lead Bank S cheme.  The District Collector is the \nChairman of the DCC meetings. Reserve Bank of India, NAB ARD, all the \ncommercial banks including Small Finance Banks in the district, co -operative banks \nincluding the District Central Cooperative Bank (DCCB), RRBs,  Payments Banks  \nvarious State Government departments and allied agencies are the members of the DCC.  The Lead District Officer (LDO) represents the Reserve Bank as a member of \nthe DCC.  The Lead District Manager (LDM) convenes the DCC meetings. The \nDirector of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises Development Institute (MSME -DI) \nin the district is an inv itee in districts where MSME clusters are located to discuss \nissues concerning MSMEs.  \n2.2.2 Conduct of DCC Meetings  \n \ni) DCC meeting s should be convened by the L ead Banks at quarterly intervals.  \nii) At the DCC level, sub- committees , as appropriate may , be set up to work \nintensively on specific issues and submit reports to the DCC for its consideration.  \niii) DCC should give adequate feedback to the SLBC on various issues that need to \nbe discussed on a wider platform, so that these receive adequate attention at the State Level.  6 \n \n \n2.2.3 Agenda for DCC Meetings  \n \nWhile Lead Banks are expected to address the problems particular to the concerned \ndistricts, some of the important areas which are common to all districts which the lead banks should invariably discuss in the fora are as under:  \ni) Review of progress under financial inclusion plan (FIP).  \nii) The specific issues inhibiting and enabling IT enabled financial inclusion  \niii) Issues  to facilitate 'enablers' and remove/ minimise  'impeders' for banking \ndevelopment for inclusive growth  \niv) Monitoring initiatives for providing 'Credit Plus' activities by banks and State \nGovernments such as setting up of Financial Literacy Centres  (FLCs) and \nRSETI\n# type Training Institutes for providing skills and capacity building to \nmanage businesses.  \nv) Scaling up financial literacy efforts to achieve financial inclusion.  \nvi) Review of performance of banks under District Credit Plan (DCP)  \nvii) Flow  of credit to priority sector and weaker sections of the society  \nviii) Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022  \nix) Assistance under Government sponsored schemes  \nx) Grant of educational loans  \nxi) Progress under SHG -  bank linkage  \nxii) SME financing & bottlenecks thereof, if any  \nxiii) Timely submission of data by banks  \nxiv) Review of relief measures (in case of natural calamities wherever applicable)  \nThe above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. The lead banks may include any \nother agenda item considered necessary.  \n \n# Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) should be more actively involved and monitored at various fora of LBS particularly  at the DCC level. Focus \nshould be on development of skills to enhance the credit absorption capacity in the area and renewing the training programmes towards sustainable micro enterprises. RSETIs should design specific programmes for each district/ block,  keeping in view \nthe skill mapping and the potential of the region for  necessary  skill training and skill \nup gradation of the rural youth in the district.  \n \n 7 \n \n \n2.2.4 Role of LDMs  \nAs the effectiveness of the Lead Bank Scheme depends on the dynamism of the District Collectors and the Lead District Managers (LDMs), with supportive role of the \nRegional/Zonal Office, the office of LDM should be sufficiently strengthened with \nappropriate infrastructural support being the focal point for  the successful \nimplementati on of the Lead Bank Scheme. Apart from the provision of a separate \noffice space, technical infrastructure like computers, printer, data connectivity, etc. which are basic necessities for LDMs to discharge their core responsibilities may be \nprovided to LDMs \u2019 Office without exception.  Officers of appropriate level , attitude \nand possessing requisite leadership skills should be posted as LDMs. Additionally, it \nis suggested that a dedicated vehicle may be provided to LDMs\u2019 to facilitate closer liaison with the bank officials, district administration officials as also to organise/ \nattend various financial literacy initiatives and meetings. The absence of a specialist \nofficer/assistant for data entry/analysis is a common and major  issue faced by LDMs. \nLiberty to hire the services of skilled computer operator may be given to the LDMs to \novercome the shortage of staff/ in case appropriate staff is not posted at LDM office\n.  \nFurther, for successful functioning of the Lead Bank Scheme, we expect Lead Banks \nto go the ex tra mile to provide facilities over and above the bare minimum to these \ncritical field functionaries. Apart from the usual role of LDMs like convening meetings \nof the DCC/DLRC and periodical meetings of DDM/LDO/ Government officials for resolving outstandi ng issues etc., the new functions envisaged for LDMs include the \nfollowing:  \ni) Monitoring the implementation of the D istrict Credit Plan  \nii) Associate with the setting up of Financial Lit eracy Centres (FLCs), RSETIs by \nbanks  \niii) Associate with organizing financial  literacy camps by FLCs and rural branches \nof banks.  \niv) Holding annual sensitisation workshops for banks and Government officials with participation by NGOs/Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)  \nv) Arranging for quarterly awareness and feedback public meetings, gr ievance \nredressal etc.  \n \n 8 \n \n2.2.5 Quarterly Public Meeting and Grievance Redressal  \nThe Lead District Manager should convene a quarterly public meeting at various \nlocations in the district in coordination with the LDO of Reserve Bank, banks having \npresence i n the area and other stakeholders to generate awareness of the various \nbanking policies and regulations relating to the common person, obtain feedback from the public and provide grievance redressal to the extent possible at such \nmeetings or facilitate approaching the appropriate machinery for such redressal.  \n \n2.2.6 District Level Review Committee (DLRC) Meetings \nDLRC meetings are Chaired by the District Collector and attended by members of \nthe District Consultative Committee (DCC).  Public Representatives  i.e.  Local \nMPs/MLAs/ Zilla Parishad Chiefs are also invited to these meetings.  The DLRC \nmeetings should be convened by the L ead Banks at  least once in a quarter.  The \nDLRC is a forum to review the pace and quality of the implementation of various \nprogramm es under the Lead Bank Scheme in the district . Hence,  association of non-\nofficials is considered useful.  Lead B anks are required to ensure the presence of \npublic representatives in DLRC meetings as far as possible. Therefore, Lead B anks \nshould fix the dat e of DLRC meetings with due regard to the convenience of the \nrepresentatives of the public i.e. MPs/MLAs etc. and invite and involve them in all functions conducted by the banks in the districts, such as opening of new banking \noutlets , distribution of Kisan Credit Cards, SHG credit linkage programmes , etc. \nResponses to queries from public representatives need to be accorded highest \npriority and attended to promptly. The follow up of the DLRC\u2019s decisions is required \nto be discussed in the DCC meetings.   \n2.2.7 DCC/DLRC meetings - Annual Calendar of Meetings  \ni) DCC and DLRC are the important fora facilitating coordination among commercial \nbanks, Government agencies and others at the district level to review and find \nsolutions to the problems hindering developmental activities. Therefore, it is \nnecessary that all the members participate and deliberate in these  meetings. On a \nreview of the DCC/DLRC meetings, it was observed that late receipt/non- receipt of \nintimation of the date of meetings, clash of dates with other events, commonality of \ndates etc.  hinder participation of members in these meetings, thus undermining the prime objective of conducting the above meetings.  9 \n \nii)   Lead B anks have, therefore, been advised to prepare an Annual S chedule of \nDCC and DLRC me etings on Calendar year basis for all districts in consultation with \nthe Chairperson of the meetings, L ead District Officer of the RBI and P ublic \nRepresentatives in case of DLRC.  This yearly Calendar should be prepared in the \nbeginning of each year and ci rculated to all members as advance intimation for \nblocking future dates to attend the DCC and DLRC meetings and the meetings \nshould be conducted as per the calendar.  While preparing the Calendar , it should be \nensured that DCC and DLRC meetings are not  held simultaneously.  \n2.3 State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)  \n \n2.3.1 Constitution of SLBC  \n i) The State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) was  constituted in April 1977, as an \napex inter -institutional forum to create adequate coordination machinery in all States, \non a uniform basis for development of the State. SLBC is chaired by the Chairman/ \nManaging Director / Executive Director of the C onvenor Bank.  It comprises \nrepresentatives of commercial banks  including Small Finance Banks , RRBs,  \nPayments Banks,  State C ooperative Banks, RBI, NABARD, heads of Government \ndepartments including representatives from National Commission for Scheduled \nCastes/Tribes, National Horticulture Board, Khadi & Village Industries Commission etc. and representatives of financial institut ions operating in a State, who come \ntogether and sort out coordination problems at the policy implementation level.  Representatives of various organizations from different sectors of the economy like \nindustry bodies, retail traders, exporters , farmers\u2019 union s, etc. are special invitees in \nthe SLBC meetings for discussing their specific problems, if any. SLBC meetings are \nheld on quarterly basis. The responsibility for  convening the SLBC meetings would \nbe of the SLBC C onvenor Bank of the State.  \n \nii) Recogn ising that SLBCs, primarily as a committee of bankers at the State level , \nplay an important role in the development of the State, illustrative guidelines on the \nconduct of State Level Bankers \u2019 Committee meetings have been issued.  \n2.3.2 Conduct of SLBC Meet ings  \ni)  SLBC meetings are required to be held regularly at quarterly intervals.  The \nmeetings are chaired by the Chairman / Managing Director / Executive Director of the \nConvenor Bank and co-chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary or Development 10 \n \nCommissioner of the State concerned.  In  cases  where the Managing Director/Chief  \nExecutive  Officer/Executive  Director of the SLBC  Convenor  Bank  is unable to attend  \nSLBC Meetings,  the Regional  Director  of the RBI shall co-chair  the meetings  along  \nwith the Additiona l Chief  Secretary/Development  Commissioner  of the State  \nconcerned.  A High Level of participation in SLBC/UTLBC meetings ensures an \neffective and desired outcome with meaningful discussion on issues of public policy \nof both the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India.  \nii)  The Chief Minister/Finance Minister and senior level officers of the State/RBI (of \nthe rank of Deputy Governor / Executive Director) may be invited to attend the SLBC \nmeetings.  Further, the State Chief Ministers are encouraged to attend at least one SLBC meeting in a year.  \n \niii)  State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee meetings should primarily focus on policy issues \nwith participation of only the senior functionaries of the banks/ Government Departments.  All routine issues may be delegated to sub- committee(s) of the SLBC.  \nA Steering Sub- committee may be constituted in the SLBC to deliberate on agenda \nproposals from different stakeholders and finalise a compact agenda for the SLBC meetings. Typically, the Sub- Committee could consist of S LBC Convenor, RBI & \nNABARD representatives & senior State Government representative from the concerned department, e.g. Finance/ Institutional Finance and two to three banks having major presence.  \n \niv)  Other issue- specific sub -committees may be constitut ed as required.  The sub \ncommittees may examine the specific issues  relating to agriculture, micro, \nsmall/medium industries/enterprises, handloom finance, export promotion and financial inclusion, etc.  in-depth and devise solutions/recommendations for adoption \nby the full committee. They are expected to meet more frequently than the SLBC. \nThe composition of the sub- committee s and subjects/ specific issues \nimpeding/enabling financial inclusion to be deliberated upon, may vary from State to State depending on the specific problems/issues faced by the States.  \n \nv)   The secretariat/offices of the SLBC should be sufficiently strengthened to enable \nthe SLBC Convenor Bank to effectively discharge its functions.  \n \nvi) The various fora at lower levels may give adequate feedback to the SLBC on \nissues that need to be discussed on a wider platform.  \n 11 \n \nvii)   Several institutions and academicians are engaged in research,  studies etc. that \nhave implications for sustainable development in agriculture and MSME sector. \nEngagi ng with such research institutions and academicians would be useful in \nbringing in new ideas for furthering the objectives of the Lead Bank Scheme. The \nSLBCs may, therefore, identify such academicians and researchers and invite them \nas 'special invitees' t o attend SLBC meetings occasionally both for adding value to \nthe discussions and also associate them with studies appropriate to the State. Other \n'special invitees' may be invited to attend SLBC meetings depending on the agenda items/issues to be discussed in the meetings.  \n \nviii)  The activities of NGOs in facilitating and channelling credit to the low income \nhouseholds are expected to increase in the coming years. Several corporate houses \nare also engaged in corporate social responsibility activities for sustainable \ndevelopment. A linkage with such NGOs/Corporate houses operating in the area to \nensure that the NGOs/corporates provide the necessary 'credit plus' services can help leverage bank credit for inclusive growth. Success stories could be presented in SLBC meetings to serve as models that could be replicated.  \n  \n2.3.3 Revised Agenda for SLBC Meetings \n \n1.

Any other item, w ith the permission of the Chair  \n \nThe above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. SLBC Convenor Banks may include \nany other agenda item considered necessary.  \n \n2.3.4   SLBC - Yearly Calendar of Meetings \n \ni)  To improve the effectiveness and streamline  the functioning of SLBC/UTLBC \nmeetings, SLBC Convenor  Banks have been advised to prepare a yearly calendar of \nprogrammes (calendar year basis) in the beginning of the year itself, for conducting 14 \n \nthe meetings. The calendar of programmes should clearly specify the cut off dates \nfor data submission to SLBC and acceptance thereof by the SLBC Convenor. This \nyearly calendar should be circulated to all the concerned as an advance intimation \nfor blocking of future dates of senior functionaries of various agencies like Central \nGovernment , State Governments, banks, RBI , etc. The SLBC/UTLBC meetings \nshould be conducted as per the calendar under all circumstances. The agenda \nshould also be circulated in advance without waiting for the data from defaulting \nbanks. The matter should, however, be taken up with the defaulting banks in the SLBC meeting. In addition, the SLBC Convenor  Bank should write a letter in this \nregard to the controlling office of the defaulting banks under advice to the Regional \nOffice of RBI. The SLBC Convenor Bank will, however, continue to follow -up with \nbanks for timely data submission. Further, in case the Chief Minister, Finance \nMinister or other very senior functionaries are not  able to attend the SLBC on some \nvery rare occasion, then if so desired by them, a special SLBC meeting can be held.  Following broad guidelines should be used for preparation of the calendar of \nprogrammes:   \n \nActivity  To be completed by (Date)  \nPreparatio n of calendar of SLBC/UTLBC \nmeetings and intimation to all the concerned of \nthe cut -off dates for submission of data and \ndates of meetings as per the dateline given \nbelow.  15th January  every year  \nReminder regarding the exact date of meeting \nand submission of data by banks to SLBC  15 days before end of the \nquarter  \nDead line for receipt of information/data by \nSLBC Convenor Bank 15 days from the end of the \nquarter  \nDistribution of agenda cum background papers  20 days from the end of the \nquarter  \nHolding of t he meeting  \n Within 45 days from the end of \nthe quarter  \nForwarding the minutes of the meeting to all \nstakeholders  Within 10 days from holding the \nmeeting \nFollow -up of the action points emerged from the \nmeeting To be completed within 30 days \nof forwarding the minutes (for \nreview in the next meeting)  \n      \nii)   The objective of preparing the calendar of meetings in the beginning of the year \nis to ensure adequate notice of these meetings and timely compilation and dispatch 15 \n \nof agenda papers to all stakeholders. It also ensures clear cut guidelines for the \nsubmission of data to SLBC C onvenors by participating banks & Government \nDepartments. It is expected to save precious time of SLBC C onvenors otherwise \nspent in taking dates from various senior functionaries attending these SLBC \nmeetings.  \niii)  SLBC C onvenor Banks  need to appreciate the advantages of ensuring \nadherence to the yearly calendars.  SLBC C onvenor Banks have therefore been \nadvised to give wide publicity to the annual calendar at the beginning of the year and \nensure that dates of senior functionaries expected to attend the meetings are blocked for all meetings by their offices.  In case, despite blocking dates, if for some \nreason, the senior functionary is not able to attend the meeting, the meeting should \nbe held as planned in the calendar.  More importantly, the data for review in these \nmeetings should be received as per deadlines set in the calendar and those who do \nnot submit the data in time should be asked to explain the reasons for delay in \nsending the data that may be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Under no \ncircumstance , should the preparation of the agenda be delayed beyond the dates \nstipulated as per the calendar.  \n \n2.3.5 SLBC Website \u2013 Standardisation of information /data \n \nSLBC Conve nor Banks are required to maintain the SLBC websites where all \ninstructions pertaining to LBS and Government Sponsored Schemes are made \navailable and are accessible to the common man desiring any information relating to the conduct of meetings or State- wise data/ bank-wise performance. In order to \nstandardize the information and data that is to be made available on the SLBC \nwebsite, an indicative list of the information & data is given in the Annex II\n.  SLBCs \nshould arrange to pl ace the prescribed minimum information on the websites of \nSLBCs of their bank and keep it updated regularly, at least on quarterly basis. Banks may note that the list is only indicative and SLBCs are free to put any additional \ninformation considered relevant for the State.  \n \n2.3.6 Liaison with State Government  \n \nSLBC Convenor  Banks are expected to co- ordinate the activities of all banks in the \nState, discuss with State Government officials , the operational problems in lending, 16 \n \nextending necessary support for  banking development and to achieve the objective \nof financial inclusion.  \n2.3.7 Capacity Building/Training/Sensitization Programmes  \n \ni) There is a need for sensitising the District Collectors and CEOs of Zilla Parishads \non banks and banking in general as  also on the specific scope and role of the Lead \nBank Scheme. In each State, a full day \u2018Sensitisation W orkshop\u2019  may be convened \nby the SLBC Convenor  Bank every year , preferably in April/May . Such sensitisation \nshould form part of the probationary training of such officers. Further, as soon as \nthey are posted in a district, the SLBC may arrange for exposure visits for the District Collectors to the SLBC C onvenor\u2019s office for sensitisation and understanding of the \nLead Bank Scheme.  \n \nii) Staff at the operati onal level of banks and government agencies associated with \nimplementation of the Lead Bank Scheme need to be aware of the latest developments and emerging opportunities. There is need for staff sensitisation/ \ntraining/seminars, etc. at periodic intervals on an ongoing basis  \n \n3. Implementation of Lead Bank Scheme  \n3.1 Preparation of credit plans  \nPlanning plays an important role in the implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme \nand a bottom -up approach is adopted to map the existing potential for development.  \nUnder LBS, planning starts with identifying block wise/activity wise potential \nestimated for various sectors.  \n3.2 Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs)  \ni) Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) are a step towards decentralized credit \nplanning with the basic objective of mapping the existing potential for development through bank credit. PLPs take into account the long term physical potential, availability of infrastructure support, marketing facilities, and policies/programmes of Government etc.  NABARD to take m easures  to ensure that PLPs should be more \nfocussed and implementable so that banks can utilize them  more gainfully while \npreparing the Branch Credit Plan. PLPs should emphasise on promotion of 17 \n \nsustainable agricultural practices suitable to local conditions. While preparing the \nPLPs, the focus must be on identifying processes and projects that :  \na. reduce the carbon foot -print,  \nb. prevent the overuse of fertilizers,  \nc. ensure efficient utilisation of water and  \nd. address agricultural pollution issues.  \n \nThe plans must also focus on promoting innovative farming systems such as organic \nfarming, bio dynamic farming, permaculture and sustainable small -scale  farming, as \nalso promoting Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs)  and Farmers\u2019 Markets. Such \ninitiatives must be support ed by appropriate investments and project finance \nframeworks. \n[[ \nii) A pre -PLP meeting is convened by LDM during June every year to be attended by \nbanks, Government agencies, etc., to reflect their views and concerns regarding \ncredit potential (sector/acti vity-wise) and deliberate on major financial and socio-\neconomic developments in the district in the last one year and priorities to be set out for inclusion in the PLP.   The DDM of NABARD make s a presentation in this \nmeeting outlining the major requirements of information for preparing the PLP for the following year. The preparation of PLP for the next year is to be completed by August every year to enable the State Government to factor in the PLP projections.   \niii) The procedure for preparing the Distric t Credit Plan is as follows:  \na) Controlling Offices of commercial banks  including Small Finance Banks  and \nHead Office of RRB and DCCB/LDB circulate the accepted block -\nwise/activity -wise potential to all their branches for preparing the Branch \nCredit Plans (BCP) by their respective branch managers.  Banks should ensure that the exercise of preparation of branch/block plans is completed in time by all branches so that the Credit Plans become operational on time.  \nb) A special Block Level Bankers' Committee (BLBC) meeting is convened for \neach block where the Branch Credit Plans are discussed and aggregated to \nform the Block Credit Plan.  The DDM and the LDM guide the BLBC in \nfinalizing the plan,  ensuring that the Block Credit Plan is in tune with the 18 \n \npotentials identi fied activity -wise including in respect of Government \nSponsored Schemes .   \n \nc) All the Block Credit Plans of the district are  aggregated by the LDM to form \nthe District Credit Plan  (DCP) . This plan indicates an analytical assessment of \nthe credit needs of the district to be deployed by all the financial institutions \noperating in the district and the total quantum of funds to be earmarked as \ncredit by all the financial institutions for a new financial year.  The \nZonal/Controlling Offices of banks, while finalizi ng their business plans for the \nyear, should take into account the commitments made in the DCP which \nshould be ready well in time before the performance budgets are finalized.   \n \nd) The District Credit Plan is then placed before the DCC by the Lead District \nManager for final acceptance/approval.  All the District Credit Plans are \neventually aggregated into a State Level Credit Plan to be prepared by SLBC \nConvenor B ank and launched by the 1st of April every year.   \n \ne) The corporate business targets for branches, blocks, districts and states may be aligned with the Annual Credit Plans (ACP) to ensure better implementation. The Controlling Offices of the banks in each state should synchronize their inter nal business plans with the ACP.\n \n3.3   Monitoring the Performance of C redit Plans \nThe performance of the credit plans is reviewed in the v arious fora created under the \nLead Bank Scheme as shown below:  \n \nAt Block Level  Block Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC)  \nAt District Level  District Consultative Committee (DCC) & Distr ict \nLevel Review Committee (DLRC)  \nAt State Level  State Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC)  \n \n                                                            \nMonitoring of LBS by RBI -  Monitoring Information System (MIS)  \ni)  Data on Annual Credit Plan (ACP)  is an  important element to review the flow of \ncredit in the State.  ACP formats are aligned with  the extant reporting guidelines on 19 \n \npriority sector lending. Accordingly, the ACP is to be prepared considering the \ncategories of priority sector that would include Agriculture, Micro, Small and Medium \nEnterprises, Export Credit, Education,  Housing, Social Infrastructure, Renewable \nEnergy and Others.  Further, it has been decided that bank loans to Micro/Small and \nMedium Enterprises (Services), engaged in providing or  rendering of services as \ndefined in terms of investment in equipment under MSMED Act, 2006, shall qualify under priority sector without any credit cap.  Accordingly, the applicable loan limits \nper borrower to Micro/ Small Enterprises (\u20b9  5 crore) and Medium Enterprises (\u20b9 10 \ncrore) under the MSMEs Sector (Services) for classification under priority sector \nhave  been removed.  The reporting statement for ACP target is LBS -MIS-I (\nAnnex \nIII), statement  for disbursement and outstanding LBS -MIS-II (Annex IV) and ACP \nachievement vis -\u00e0-vis ACP target , LBS- MIS-III (Annex V ).  SLBC Convenor B anks/ \nLead Banks have been advised to prepare the statements LBS MIS I, II and III as \nper the revised formats starting from the financial year 2018- 19.  They should \nprepare the bank group wise statements of LBS- MIS-I, II and III as per the \nprescribed formats and also place these statements for meaningful rev iew in  all DCC \nand SLBC meetings.  \nii)  In order to maintain consistency and integrity of data with the A ll-India data of \nscheduled commercial banks and facilitate a meaningful review/analysis of data, the \nACP data needs to be grouped separately for scheduled commercial banks and \nother banks like State Cooperative B anks , DCCBs , etc. while presenting in the \nDCC/SLBC meetings and submitting to our regional offices.  The data pertaining to  \nscheduled commercial banks needs to be further grouped into public sect or banks, \nprivate sector banks , Regional Rural Banks and Small Finance Banks to know the \nbank group wise position.   \n3.4   Revised mechanism of  Data Flow for LBS fora meetings \n \nAt present, discussions at the quarterly meetings of the various LBS fora viz. State \nLevel Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC), District level Consultative Committee (DCC) and \nBlock  Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (BLBC) primarily focus on the performance of \nbanks in the disbursement of loans vis -a-vis the allocated target under the Annual \nCredit Pla n. The integrity & timeliness of the data submitted by banks for the purpose \nhas been an issue as a significant portion of this data is manually compiled and entered into the Data Management Systems of the SLBC Convener Banks. The 20 \n \nextent to which this data corresponds with the data present in the Core Banking \nSolution ( CBS)  of the respective banks also varies significantly. Therefore, there is \nneed of a standardized system to be developed on the website maintained by each \nSLBC to enable uploading and downlo ading of the data pertaining to the Block, \nDistrict as well as the State. The relevant data must also be directly downloadable from the CBS and/ or MIS of the banks with a view to keeping manual intervention to \na minimal level in the process. The procedure relating to the envisaged intervention \nin this area is given below:  \nManagement of Data Flow at LBS Fora \u2013  Procedure \ni. Each bank\u2019s CBS should have a provision to generate a report pertaining to all \nLBS related data/ tables to Excel. This data should have inf ormation pertaining to \nall the branches operating in the state including fields/ columns for District & Block name. Access to Download & Export this data from the bank \u2019s CBS should \nbe given to the Controlling Offices of the b anks who would be solely respon sible \nfor the process of \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 for all districts/ blocks within their jurisdiction.  \n \nii. The \u2018Data Feeding\u2019 process is the process of uploading this Excel file (downloaded in step (i) above) on the SLBC websites. SLBC websites should \nhave a provision to \u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 all the data present in the Excel Sheet on the \ndatabase of the SLBC w ebsite. This would obviate any manual \u2018data entry\u2019 at the \nSLBC/ Controlling Office level.  \n \niii. To facilitate the above functionality, each SLBC Convenor Bank would have to add this \u2018Import/ Upload\u2019 functionality to their SLBC website along with the requisite capabilities at the back -end. \n \niv. The SLBC website would, thus, effectively work as a data aggregation platform. Further, data analysis capabilities could also be added to the SLBC websites depending on the available resources.  \n \nv. The SLBC websites should provide access to LDMs to download district and block specific data directly from this website thus ensuring integrity and timely availability of data.  \n 21 \n \nvi. There could still  be some data pertaining to State Government Schemes/ other \ndata that is not available on the CBS or MIS of the banks. This would have to be \ncollated at the Controlling Office level as is done now. At the SLBC website, \nfunctionalities could be provided to enter this data too. This could then be downloaded by the LDMs for district/ block level reports. Banks may also add \nOpen Format fields like \u2018text boxes\u2019 for data or information that is special or is \nentered/ used once in a while.   \n \nvii. Such a system ensures that LDMs & SLBC Convenor Banks have to do zero or minimal data entry/ feeding and all data is entered by a single \u2018custodian of data\u2019 \nwhich is the Controlling Office of each b ank. Any information to be provided by \nGovernment extension agencies could also be similarly uploaded.  \n Necessary modifications may be made on the SLBC websites and to the CBS & \nMIS systems of all banks to implement the envisaged data flow mechanism . \n \n4.   Assignment of Lead Bank Responsibility  \n \ni) Lead Bank Scheme is administered by the Reserve Bank of India since 1969. The \nassignment of L ead Bank responsibility to designated banks in every district is done \nby the Reserve Bank of India following a detailed procedure formulated for this \npurpose. As on June 30, 2019, 18 public sector banks and one private sector bank \nhave been assigned Lead Bank responsibility in 717 districts of the country.  \nii) State Level Bankers \u2019 Committee  (SLBC) /Union Territory Level Bankers' \nCommittee (UTLBC) , as an apex level for um at the State /Union Territory (UT)  level, \ncoordinates the activities of the financial institutions  and Government departments in \nthe State/Union Territory under  the Lead Bank Scheme. SLBC/UTLBC Convenorship \nis assigned to banks for this purpose  As on June 30, 2019, the SLBC/ UTLBC \nconvenorship of 29 States and 7 Union Territories has been assigned to 14 public sector banks and one private sector bank. A List of State /UT wise SLBC /UTLBC  \nConvenor  Banks  and district  wise Lead Banks is given  in Annex  I\n. \niii) The Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) has been extended to the districts in the \nmetropolitan areas , thus bringing the entire country under the fold of the Lead Bank \nScheme.  22 \n \n5.   Banking Penetration  \n \ni)  Over the years, the focus of the Lead Bank Scheme has shifted to inc lusive \ngrowth and financial inclusion. The use of Information Technology (IT) and \nintermediaries has enabled banks to increase the outreach, scale and depth of \nbanking services at affordable cost.   \nii)   SLBC Convenor B anks / L ead Banks are advised to foc us attention on the need \nfor achieving 100% financial inclusion through penetration of banking services in the rural areas. Upon issuance of DBR revised guidelines on \u2018Rationalisation of Branch \nAuthorisation Policy\u2019 on May 18, 2017 clarifying on \u2018Banking O utlet\u2019, banks were \nadvised to consider opening of a CBS -enabled banking outlet or a part time banking \noutlet , as the case may be,  in unbanked rural centres.  \n \niii)  SLBC Convenor Banks should take up with the State Governments , impeders \nsuch as issues of r oad/digital connectivity, conducive law and order situation, \nuninterrupted power supply, adequate security , etc. for ensuring banking expansion \nat all centres where penetration by the formal banking system is required. However, these impeders should not inhibit the scaling up of financial inclusion initiatives.  \n \n5.1   Roadmap for providing banking services in unbanked villages \nIn November 2009, a roadmap to provide  banking services in villages with population \nmore than 2000 was rolled out .  All the identif ied villages have been provided with \nbanking services through branches, business correspondents or through other \nmodes such as ATMs and mobile vans.  Later, in June 2012, a roadmap to provide \nbanking services in unbanked villages with less than 2,000 popula tion was rolled out . \nSLBC Convenor B anks and L ead Banks were advised to complete the process of \nproviding banking services in unbanked villages with population below 2000 by August 14, 2015.  \n \n5.2 Roadmap for opening brick and mortar branches in villages wi th \npopulation more than 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial \nbank  \n \nAs brick and mortar branches are an integral component  of financial inclusion, it was \ndecided to focus on villages with population above 5000 without a bank branch of a 23 \n \nsche duled commercial bank. This was to  enable banks to provide quality financial \nservices and timely support to BC outlets that would help in sustaining and \nstrengthening the services provided through BCs and also ensure close supervision \nof BC operations. Acc ordingly, SLBC Convenor B anks were advised to identify \nvillages with population above 5000 without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial bank in their State and allot these villages among scheduled commercial \nbanks (including Regional Rural Banks) for opening of branches.   \n \n5.3   Aligning roadmap for unbanked villages having population more than \n5000 with revised Guidelines on Branch Authorisation Policy  \n \nIn terms of circul ar DBR.No.BAPD.BC.69/22.01.001/2016- 17 dated May 18, 2017  \nissued by DBR on \u2018Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy -  Revision of \nGuidelines \u2019, final  guidelines on \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 have been issued with a view to \nfacilitate financial  inclusion as also to provide flexibility to  banks on the choice of \ndelivery channel.  Accordingly, SLBC Convenor Banks have been  advised to identify \nall unbanked rural centres (URCs) in the State, compile and maintain an updated list \nof all such centres.  The updated lis t should be displayed on the website of each \nSLBC to facilitate banks to choose/indicate the place/centre where they wish to open \na \u2018banking outlet\u2019.  \n \nii)   Further, SLBC Convenor Banks have been advised that in order to comply with \nthe criteria of opening at least 25 percent of the total banking outlets in unbanked \nrural centres in Tier 5 & 6  centres , as  prescribed  vide DBR  circular dated May 18, \n2017,  banks should give priority to villages without a banking outlet having population more than 5000 (i. e. Tier 5 centres) and ensure that all such villages \nunder their jurisdiction are covered with a CBS- enabled Banking Outlet on priority \nbasis.  \n \niii)  The updated list of unbanked rural centres should be tabled in all SLBC meetings \nduring discussions on the progress of providing banking services in unbanked rural centres.  \n \n \n \n  24 \n \n6. Credit Deposit Ratio ( CD Ratio)  \n \n6.1   CD Ratio of B anks in Rural and Semi -Urban Areas  \n \nBanks have been advised to achieve a CD Ratio of 60% in respect of their rural and \nsemi -urban branches separately on an A ll-India basis. While it is not necessary that \nthis ratio should be achieved separately , branch- wise, district -wise or region- wise, \nthe banks should,  nevertheless, ensure that wide disparity in the ratios between \ndifferent Sta tes / Regions is avoided in order to minimise regional imbalance in credit \ndeployment. The credit dispensation in certain districts is very low, as a result of \nvarious factors such as lack of necessary infrastructure, varying ability of different \nregions t o absorb credit, etc. B anks may review the performance of their bank \nbranches in such areas and take necessary steps to augment the credit flow. The \nLead Banks may discuss the problem in all its aspects with the other financial \ninstitutions in the district  and also in the DCC forum.  \n \n \n6.2    Implementation of the Recommendations of the Expert Group on CD \nRatio  \n \n \ni)   An Expert Group was constituted by the Government of India to go into the nature \nand magnitude of the problem of low CD Ratio across States / Regions and to \nsuggest steps to overcome the problem. The Expert Group examined the problems \nand causes of low CD  Ratio and made recommendations . As per the \nrecommendations, the CD R atio of banks should be monitored at different levels \nbased on the followi ng parameters \u2013  \nInstitution / Level  Indicator  \nIndividual Banks at Head Office  Cu + RIDF  \nState Level (SLBC)  Cu + RIDF  \nDistrict Level  Cs \n \nWhere:  \n \nCu = Credit as per place of Utilization  \nCs = Credit as per place of Sanction  \nRIDF = Total Resource support  provided to States under RIDF \nFurther, banks are advised that:  \n \n\u2022 In the districts having CD R atio less than 40, Special Sub- Committees (SSCs) \nof the DCC shall be set up to monitor the CD Ratio. \n\u2022 Districts having CD  Ratio between 40 and 60, shall  be monitor ed under the \nexisting system by the DCC, and  25 \n \n\u2022 The district with CD R atio of less than 20 need to be treated on a special \nfooting.  \n \nii)  Special Sub- Committee s (SSCs) of the DCC should be set up in the districts \nhaving CD R atio less than 40 percent , in order  to monitor the CD  Ratio and to draw \nup Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs) to increase the CD R atio. The Lead District \nManager (LDM) is designated as the C onvenor of the SSC which,  in addition to the \nDistrict Co-ordinators of banks functioning in the area, sh ould comprise of the LDO \nof RBI, the DDM of NABARD, the District Planning Officer or a representative of the \nCollector duly empowered to take decisions on behalf of the district administration.  \nThe functions of the Special Sub- Committee are as under:  \n\u2022 The SSCs should draw  up Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs) for improving the \nCD Ratio in their districts on a self -set graduated basis.  \n\u2022 For this purpose,  the SSC should hold a special meeting immediately after its \nconstitution and on the basis of the various ground level parameters, set for \nitself, a target for increasing the CD R atio initially for the current year. It will \nalso, at the same meeting, set a definite time frame to achieve a CD Ratio more than 60 percent  in annual increments.  \n\u2022 Consequent to the complet ion of this process, the target and time frame self \nset by the SSC should be placed before the DCC for approval.  \n\u2022 The plans for implementation must then be taken up by the SSC and \nmonitor ed assiduously once in two months.  \n\u2022 The SSC should report  the progress on the implementation of the plan to the \nDCC on a quarterly basis and through them to the Convenor of the SLBC.  \n\u2022 On the basis of the feedback received from the DCC regarding the progress in the implementation of the Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs), a consol idated \nreport should be prepared by the SSC and tabled at all SLBC meetings for \ndiscussion / information.  \niii)  As regards the districts with a CD Ratio less than 20, these are generally located \nin hilly, desert  or inaccessible terrains and / or those dependent solely on the primary \nsector and/ or characterized by a breakdown of the law and order machinery. In such areas, conventional methods are not likely to work unless the banking system and the State Government come together in a specially meaningful way.  \n 26 \n \niv) While the framework for implementation for raising the CD Ratio in these districts \nwill be the same as in the case of districts with CD R atio below 40 percent (i.e. \nsetting up of SSC etc.), the focus of attention and the level of efforts should be of a \nmuch higher scale.  \nFor this,  \n\u2022 All such districts should first be placed in a special category.  \n\u2022 Thereafter, the responsibility for increasing their CD R atio should be taken by \nbanks and State Governments and the districts should be \"adopted\" by the \nDistrict Administration and the L ead Bank jointly.  \n\u2022 While banks would be responsible for credit disbursement, the State \nGovernment would be required to give an upfront commitment regarding its \nresponsibilities for creation of identified rural infrastructure together with \nsupport in creating an enabling environment for banks to lend and to recover \ntheir dues.  \n\u2022 Progress in the special category districts should be monitored at the district \nlevel and reported to the corporate offices of the concerned banks.  \n\u2022 The Chairmen/ Managing Directors  of banks should give special attention to \nthe CD R atio in such districts.  \n \n7.   Direct Benefit Transfer  \n \n \nDirect Benefit Transfer  (DBT) was rolled out by  the Government of India in  selected \ndistricts in January 2013. It was expanded to other districts subsequently.  SLBC \nConvenor  Banks were advised to co- ordinate with the Government authorities to \nimplement DBT.  Banks were advised to include the status of the roll -out of DBT  as a \nregular agenda item for discussion in SLBC meetings  as part of Financial \nInclusion/ Direct  Benefit Transfer ( DBT) implementation. As a prerequisite to the \nimplementation of the DBT, every eligible individual should have a bank account. \nFurther, to make disbursements at the doorstep through the ICT- based BC model, \nbanking outlets either through brick & mortar branches or the branchless mode is  \nneeded in all villages across the country.  Hence, banks have been advised to:   \n\u2022 take steps to complete the opening of bank accounts  and seeding of Aadhaar \nnumber s in all bank accounts .  27 \n \n\u2022 closely monitor the progress in seeding of Aadhaar number with the bank  \naccounts of beneficiaries.  \n\u2022 put in place a system to  provide the beneficiary of the seeding request an \nacknowledgement and also send a  confirmation of the seeding of A adhaar \nnumber.  \n\u2022 form a DBT Implementation Co- ordination Committee, along with the State \nGovernment department  concerned, at district level and review the seeding of \nAadhaar number s in bank accounts.  \n\u2022 ensure that district and village wise names and other det ails of  business \ncorrespondents (BCs) engaged/other arrangements made by the bank are  \ndisplayed on the SLBC website.  \n\u2022 set up a Complaint Grievance Redressal mechanism in each bank and \nnominate a Complaint Redressal Officer in each district, to redress the \ngrievances related to \u2018seeding of Aadhaar number in bank accounts'.  \n \n8. Service Area Approach (SAA)  \n \ni) The Service Area Approach (SAA) , introduced in April 1989 for planned and \norderly development of rural and semi -urban areas was applicable to all scheduled \ncommercial banks including Regional Rural Banks.  Under SAA, each bank branch \nin a rural or semi -urban area was designated to serve an area of 15 to 25 villages \nand the branch was responsible for meeting the needs of bank credit of its service area.  The primary objective of SAA was to increase productive lending and forge effective linkages between bank credit, production, productivity and increase in income levels.  The SAA scheme was reviewed from time to time and appropriate changes were made in the scheme to make it more effective.  \n \nii) The Service Area Approach scheme was reviewed in December 2004 and it was decided to dispense with the restrictive provisions of the scheme while retaining the positive features of the SAA such as credit planning and monitoring of the credit \npurveyance. Accordingly, under SAA , the allocation of villages among the rural and \nsemi -urban branches of banks were made not applicable for lending except under \nGovernment Sponsored Schemes. Thus , while  the commercial banks and R RBs are \nfree to lend i n any rural and semi -urban area, the borrowers have the choice of \napproaching any branch for their credit requirements.  28 \n \n \n8.1 Dispensing with \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019  \n \nIn order to ensure hassle free credit to all borrowers, especially in rural and semi -\nurban areas and keeping in view the technological developments and the different \nways available with banks to avoid multiple financing, banks have been advised to \ndispense with obtaining a \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 from the individual borrowers \n(including SHGs & JLGs) in rural and semi -urban areas for all types of loans \nincluding loans under Government Sponsored Schemes, irrespective of the amount involved unless the Government Sponsored Scheme itself provides for obtention of a \n\u2018No Due Certificat e\u2019. Further, it is clarified that the policy of dispensing with a \u2018No Due \nCertificate \u2019 for lending by banks is also applicable to urban areas including \nmetropolitan cities.  \n \nii)   Banks are encouraged to use an alternative framework of due diligence as par t \nof the credit appraisal exercise other than the \u2018No Due Certificate\u2019 which could, \namong others, consist of one or more of the following:  \n\u2022 Credit history check through C redit Information Companies  (CICs)  \n\u2022 Self-declaration or an affidavit from the borrower  \n\u2022 CERSAI registration  \n\u2022 Peer monitoring  \n\u2022 Information sharing among lenders  \n\u2022 Information search (writing to other lenders with an auto deadline)  \n \niii) Banks are also advised to submit information/data to all Credit Information Companies (CICs), as required in terms of extant instructions issued by RBI.  \n \n9.   Doubling of Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022 \ni)  The Government of India,  in the Union Budget 2016- 17, had announced its \nresolve to double the income of farmers by 2022. Several steps have been taken \ntowards attaining this objective including setting up of an inter -ministerial committee \nfor preparation of a blue print for the same. This agenda has also been reiterated by the government in several fora  and has acquired primacy from the point of view of \nrural and agricultural development.  29 \n \nii) The strategy to achieve this goal, inter -alia, includes,  \n \n\u2022 Focus on irrigation with large budgets, with the aim of \"per drop, more crop\"  \n\u2022 Provision of quality seeds and nutrients based on soil health of each field  \n\u2022 Investments in warehousing and cold chains to prevent post -harvest crop \nlosses  \n\u2022 Promotion of value addition through food processing  \n\u2022 Creation of a national farm market, removing distortions and development of  \ninfrastructure such as e- platform across 585 stations  \n\u2022 Strengthening of the crop insurance scheme to mitigate risks at affordable \ncost \n\u2022 Promotion of ancillary activities like poultry, bee- keeping and fisheries  \niii. Needless to emphasize that acceleration in income generation is significantly \ndependent on better capital formation i n agriculture. Towards this, banks should \nrevisit their documentation for crop loans, simplify them where required and ensure \nspeedy sanctioning and disbursal of loans within specified time limits.  \niv. The Lead Bank Scheme, which ensures inter -departmental/governmental \ncoordination in the financial sector, should,  therefore,  be leveraged to further the \nobjective of doubling farmer\u2019s income by 2022. Lead B anks are accordingly advised \nto ensure the following:  \na. Work closely with NABARD in the preparation of Potential Linked Credit Plans \n(PLPs) & Annual Credit Plans (ACPs) keeping the above strategy in \nconsideration \nb. Include \u2018Doubling of Farmer\u2019s Income by 2022\u2019 as a regular agenda under the \nLead Bank Scheme in various fora  such as SLBC, DCC, DLRC and BLBC  \nc.

With a view to sustain ing these efforts  and ensure  \ndiscipline among the banks on timely and accurate reporting of  currency chest \ntransactions, we have  issued instructions on the subject.     \n \n2.

This Master Direction has been placed on RBI website at www.rbi.org.in . \n \nYours faithfully,  \n \n(Manas Ranjan Mohanty ) \nChief General Manage r \n \nEncl : As above   \n \nAnnex  \n  \n1. Penal interest for Delayed Reporting / Wrong Reporting / Non-Reporting of \nCurrency Chest Transactions  \n1.1  Reporting of Currency Chest Transactions  \nThe minimum amount of deposit into / withdrawal from currency chest will be ` 1,00,000   \nand thereaft er, in multiples of ` 50,000.  \n1.2  Time limit for Reporting \n1.2.1 The currency chests / Link Offices should invariably report all transactions through \nCyM \u2013 CC portal on the same day by 7  pm.  \n1.2.2 The Sub- Treasury Offices (STOs ) should report all transactions directly to the \nIssue Office of the Reserve Bank by 7  pm on the same day.  \n1.2.3 Relaxation in respect of strike period in banks  \nRelaxation in the reporting period on account of strike situation will be considered on case- to-case basis.  \n1.3 Levy of penal interest \u2013  \n1.3.1 Delay in  Reporting -  \nIn the event of delay in reporting currency chest transactions, penal interest at the rate indicated in paragraph 3 of this circular will be levied on the amount due  \nfrom the chest hold ing bank for the period of delay. Penal interest will be \ncalculated on T+0 basis i.e. penal interest will be levied in respect of transactions not reported by currency chests  / Link Offices to the Issue Office on the same \nbusiness day within the time limit  prescribed above.  \nPenal interest will also be charged for delay in reporting by  STOs directly linked to \nIssue Department of the circle.  \n1.3.2 Wrong reporting  \nPenal interest will be levied in respect of cases of wrong reporting in the same manner till the date of receipt of corrected advice by Reserve Bank. As \ndebits/credits to banks' current accounts are raised on the basis of the \ntransactions reported by the currency chests / Link Offices, penal interest will \ninvariably be levied in all cases of wrong r eporting by the currency chests. It is \nexpected that currency chests / Link Offices would ensure the correctness of \nfigures reported on the CyM -  CC portal.  Particular care should be taken to ensure \nthat remittances of fresh notes/notes to the currency chests are not reported as 'deposit' transactions on the portal . \n  \n1.3.3 Penal interest for inclusion of ineligible amounts in the currency chest \nbalances  \n(i) Penal interest will be levied in all cases where the bank has enjoyed 'ineligible' \ncredit in its current account with Reserve Bank on account of wrong reporting / \ndelayed reporting / non- reporting of transactions.  Penal measures will also be \ntaken in cases of shortages in chest balances / remittances, shortages due to pilferage / frauds, counterfeit bank notes detected in chest balances / remittances \nas per the prevailing \u201cS cheme of Penalties \u201d.  \n(ii) Further, only cash held in the custody of joint custodians and 'freely available' to them is eligible for inclusion in the chest balances. Thus, cash kept for  safe \ncustody in sealed covers for whatever reasons/cash in trunks/bins under the lock and key of any official/s other than the Joint Custodians or bearing a third lock put \nby any official in addition to the two locks of the Joint Custodians is not eligibl e for \nbeing included in the chest balances. If such amounts are included in the chest balances, these will be treated as instances of wrong reporting and will attract penal interest at the rate specified in P ara 3.  \n(iii) In all the above cases (excepting s hortages in chest balances / remittances, \nshortages due to pilferage / frauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest \nbalances / remittances), penal interest will be levied from the date of inclusion of \n'ineligible' amounts in chest balances till the excl usion of such amounts from chest \nbalances.  Penal measures for shortages in chest balances / remittances, shortages due to pilferage / frauds, counterfeit banknotes detected in chest \nbalances / remittances will be taken on the basis of prevailing \u201cS cheme of \nPenalties \u201d.  \n2 Levy of penalty  \n2.1 Reporting of Soi led note remittances to RBI   \nSoiled note remittances to RBI should not be shown as withdrawal by chest/s / \nlink offices. In case such remittances  to RBI  are wrongly reported as 'withdrawals', \na penalty o f ` 50,000 will be levied irrespective of the value of remittance and \nperiod of such wrong reporting.  \n2.2 Reporting of diversions in CyM \u2013 CC portal   \nAll currency chest diversions (both between chests of the same bank and between chests of different banks ) have to be reported through \u2018Diversion Module\u2019 \nof CyM -CC Portal. The CC sending the diversion should initiate the diversion \nentry. The receiving CC should acknowledge the same. Diversions must not be \nreported as Deposit/Withdrawal.  A penalty of ` 50,000 will be levied for such \nwrong reporting.  \n \n  \n \n2.3 Delayed reporting where currency chests had \u201cNet Deposit\u201d  \nPenal interest at the prevailing rate for delayed reporting of the instances where \nthe currency chest had reported \u201cnet deposit\u201d may not be charged.  H owever, in \norder to ensure proper discipline in reporting currency chest transactions, a flat \npenalty of ` 50,000 may be levied on the currency chests for delayed reporting \nirrespective of the value of net deposit.  \n3.  Rate of penal interest  \nPenal interest  shall be levied at the rate of 2% over the prevailing Bank Rate for \nthe period of delayed reporting/wrong reporting/non- reporting /inclusion of \nineligible amounts in chest balances.  \n4.  Levy of penal interest in respect of currency chests at treasuries \nThe above instructions shall be applicable to currency chests at treasury/sub-\ntreasury offices also.  \n5.  Representations \n5.1 As the sole criterion for levy of penal interest for delayed reporting is the number \nof days of delay, there should ordinarily be no occasion for banks to request for reconsideration of the Reserve Bank's decision in individual cases.

As and when the federations of \nthe  SHGs  come  to  existence,  the  grading  exercise  can  be  done  by  the Federations to support the Banks.   \n  \n\u2022 The exi sting defunct SHGs are also eligible for credit if they are revived and \ncontinue to be active for a minimum period of 3 months.   \n  \n7.2.2 Loan Application: It is advised that all banks should use the Common Loan \nApplication Forms recommended by Indian Bank\u2019s Ass ociation (IBA) for extending credit \nfacility to SHGs.  \n \n7.2.3 Loan amount : Emphasis is laid on the multiple doses of assistance under DAY - \nNRLM. This would mean assisting an SHG over a period of time, through repeat doses of \ncredit, to enable them to access higher amounts of credit for taking up sustainable \nlivelihoods and improve on the quality of life.  \n  \nSHGs can avail either Term Loan (TL) or a Cash Credit Li mit (CCL) loan or both based \non the need.  In  case  of  need,  additional  loan  can  be  sanctioned  even  though  the \nprevious loan is outstanding.  7 \n   \nThe amount of credit under different facilities should be as follows:   \n  \nCash Credit Limit (CCL): In case of CCL, banks are advised to sanction minimum loan \nof ` 5 lakhs to each eligible SHGs for a period of 5 years with a yearly drawing power \n(DP).  The  drawing  power  may  be  enhanced  annually  based  on  the  repayment \nperformance of the SHG. The drawing power may be calculated as follows:   \n  \n\u2022 DP  for  First  Year:  6  times  of  the  existing  corpus  or  minimum  of  \u20b9  1  lakh \nwhichever is higher.   \u2022 DP for Second Year: 8 times of the corpus at the time review/ enhancement or \nminimum o f \u20b9 2 lakh, whichever is higher.   \n  \n\u2022 DP for Third Year: Minimum of \u20b9 3 lakhs based on the Micro credit plan prepared  \nby SHG and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit \n \nhistory.   \n  \n\u2022 DP for Fourth Year onwards: Minimum of \u20b9 5 lakhs based on the Micro credit plan \nprepared by SHG and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous  \ncredit History.  \n \nTerm Loan:  In case of Term Loan, banks are advised to sanction loan amount in doses \nas mentioned below:   \n  \n\u2022 First Dose: 6 times of the existing corpus or minimum of \u20b9 1 lakh whichever is \nhigher.     \n\u2022 Second Dose: 8 times of the existing c orpus or minimum of \u20b9 2 lakh, whichever is \nhigher  \n \u2022 Third Dose: Minimum of \u20b9 3 lakhs based on the Micro credit plan prepared by the \nSHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit h istory   \n  \n\u2022 Fourth Dose: Minimum of \u20b9 5 lakhs  based on the Micro credit plan prepared by the \nSHGs and appraised by the Federations /Support agency and the previous credit History  \n  \nBanks should take necessary measures to ensure that eligible SHGs are provided with \nrepeat loans. Banks are advised to work with DAY- NRLM to institutionalize a mechanism \nfor online submission of loan application of SHGs for tracking and timely disposal of application.  \n  8 \n (Corpus is inclusive of revolving funds, if any, received by that SHG, its own savings, \ninterest earning by SHG from on- lending to its members, income from other sources, and \nfunds from other sources in case of promotion by other institutes/NGOs.)   \n  \n7.3 Purpose of loan and repayment :   \n  \n7.3.1 The loan amount will be distributed among members based on the Micro Credit \nPlan (MCP) prepared by the SHGs. The loans may be used by members for meeting \nsocial needs, high cost debt swapping, construction or repair of house, construction of \ntoilets and taking up sustainable livelihoods by the individual members within the SHGs \nor to finance any viable common activity started by the SHGs.   \n  \n7.3.2 In order to facilitate use of loans for augmenting livelihoods of SHG members, it is \nadvised that at least 50% of loans above \u20b9 2 lakhs and 75% of loans above \u20b9 4 lakhs be \nused primaril y for income generating productive purposes. Micro Credit Plan (MCP) \nprepared by SHGs would form the basis for determining the purpose and usage of loans.  \n \n7.3.3 Repayment schedule could be as follows:   \n  \n\u2022 The First year/ first dose of loan will be repaid in 12 -18 months in monthly/ \nquarterly instalments.  \n  \n\u2022 The Second year/ Second dose of loan will be repaid in 18- 24 months in monthly/ \nquarterly instalments  \n \n\u2022 The Third year/ Third dose of loan will be repaid in 24- 36 months in monthly/ \nquarterly instalments.   \n  \n\u2022 The loan from Fourth year/ Fourth dose onwards has to be repaid between 3- 6 \nyears based on the cash flow in monthly/ quarterly installments.  \n   \n7.4. Security and Margin: No collateral and no margin will be charged up to \u20b9 10.00 \nlakhs limit to the SHGs. No lie n should be marked against savings bank account of SHGs \nand no deposits should be insisted upon while sanctioning loans.     \n7.5. Dealing with Defaulters:   \n  \n7.5.1 It is desirable that willful defaulters should not be financed under DAY -NRLM. In \ncase willful d efaulters are members of a group, they might be allowed to benefit from the \nthrift and credit activities of the group including the corpus built up with the assistance of Revolving Fund. But at the stage of accessing bank loan by SHG for financing economic  \nactivities by its members, the willful defaulters should not have the benefit of such bank loan until the outstanding loans are repaid. Willful defaulters of the group should not get 9 \n benefits under the DAY -NRLM Scheme and the group may be financed excludi ng such \ndefaulters while documenting the loan. However, banks should not deny loan to entire \nSHG on the pretext that spouse or other family members of individual members of SHG \nbeing a defaulter with the bank. Further, non- willful defaulters should not be debarred \nfrom receiving the loan. In case default is due to genuine reasons, Banks may follow the norms suggested for restructuring the account with revised repayment schedule.  \n 8. Credit Target Planning  \n  \n8.1 Based on the Potential Linked Plan/State Focus Paper prepared by NABARD, \nSLBC sub -committee on SHG Bank Linkage may arrive at the district -wise, block -wise \nand branch- wise credit plan. The sub-  committee should consider the existing SHGs, \nNew SHGs proposed, and number of SHGs eligible for fresh and repeat loans as \nsuggested by the SRLMs to arrive at the credit targets for the states. The targets so \ndecided should be approved in the SLBC and should be reviewed and monitored \nperiodically for effective implementation.  \n8.2 The district -wise credit plans should be communicated to the DCC. The Block - \nwise/Cluster -wise targets are to be communicated to the bank Branches through the \nControllers .  \n \n9. Post credit follow -up   \n  \n9.1 Loan pass books or statement of accounts in regional languages may be issued to \nthe SHGs which ma y contain all the details of the loans disbursed to them and the terms \nand conditions applicable to the loan sanctioned. The passbook should be updated with \nevery transaction made by the SHGs. At the time of documentation and disbursement of \nloan, it is advisable to clearly explain the terms and conditions as part of financial literacy.   \n  \n9.2 Bank branches may observe one fixed day in a fortnight to enable the staff to go \nto the field and attend the meetings of the SHGs and Federations to observe the operations of the SHGs and keep a track of the regularity in the SHGs meetings and \nperformance.   \n  \n10. Repayment:    \n  \nPrompt repayment of the loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. \nBanks shall take all possible measures, i.e. personal contact, organization of joint \nrecovery camps with District Mission Management Units (DPMUs) / DRDAs to ensure the \nrecovery of loans.  Keeping in view, the importance of loan recovery, banks should \nprepare a list of defaulting SHGs under DAY -NRLM every month and furni sh the list in \nthe BLBC, DCC meetings. This would ensure that DAY -NRLM staff at the district/ block \nlevel will assist the bankers in initiating the repayment.  \n   \n  10 \n 11. Deputation of the bank officials to SRLMs   \n   \nAs a measure of strengthening the (DPMUs) / D RDAs and for promoting a better credit \nenvironment, deputation of the bank officials to DPMUs/ DRDAs has been suggested. \nBanks may consider deputing officers at various levels to the State Governments/DRDAs \nin consultation with them.  \n  \n12. Supervision and moni toring of the Scheme   \n   \nBanks may set up DAY -NRLM cells at Regional/Zonal offices. These cells should \nperiodically monitor and review the flow of credit to the SHGs, ensure the implementation of the guidelines to the scheme, collect data from the branches and make available \nconsolidated data to the Head office and the DAY -NRLM units at the districts/ blocks. \nThe  cell  should  also  discuss  this  consolidated  data  in  the  SLBC,  BLBC  and  DCC \nmeetings regularly to maintain the effective communication with the state staff and all \nbanks.   \n  \n12.1 State  Level Bankers\u2019 Committee: SLBCs shall constitute a sub- committee on \nSHGbank linkage. The sub- committee should consist of members from all banks \noperating in the State, RBI, NABARD, CEO of SRLM, representatives  of State Rural \nDevelopment Department, Secretary -Institutional Finance and Representatives of \nDevelopment Departments etc. The sub-  committee shall meet once in a month with a \nspecific agenda of review, implementation and monitoring of the SHG -Bank linkag e and \nthe issues/ constraints in achievement of the credit target. The decisions of SLBCs \nshould be derived from the analysis of the reports of the sub- committee.   \n  \n12.2 District Coordination Committee: The DCC (DAY- NRLM sub -committee) shall \nregularly monitor  the flow of credit to SHGs at the district level and resolve issues that \nconstrain the flow of credit to the SHGs at district level. This committee meeting should \nhave participation of LDMs, AGM of NABARD, district coordinators of the banks and \nDPMU staff  representing DAY -NRLM and office bearers of SHG federations.   \n  \n12.3 Block level Bankers Committee: The BLBC shall meet regularly and take up \nissues of SHG bank linkage at the block level. In this Committee, the SHGs/ Federations of the SHGs should be include d as members to raise their voice in the forum. Branch \nwise status of SHG credit shall be monitored at the BLBC (Annex B and C may be used for the purpose)  \n  \n12.4 Reporting to Lead District Managers: The branches may furnish the progress \nreport and the delinqu ency report achieved under various activities of DAY -NRLM in the \nformat at Annex \u2018IV\u2019 and \u2018Annex V\u2019\n to the LDM every month for onward submission to \nSpecial Steering Committee/sub- committee constituted by SLBC.   \n  11 \n 12.5 Reporting to RBI : Banks may give a state- wise consolidated report on the \nprogress made on DAY -NRLM to RBI/NABARD at quarterly intervals. The data may be \nsubmitted within a month from the end of the concerned quarter.  \n12.6 LBR returns : Existing procedur e of submitting LBR returns to be continued duly  \nfurnishing the correct code.   \n   \n13. Data Sharing:    \n  \nData sharing on a mutually agreed format / interval may be provided to DAY -NRLM or \nState Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs) for initiating various strategies including \nrecovery etc.  \nThe financing banks are advised to regularly share data on loans to SHGs with the DAYNRLM or SRLMs, directly from the CBS platform.   \n  \n14. DAY- NRLM support to the bankers:    \n  \n14.1 SRLM would develop strategic partnerships with major banks at various levels. It \nwould invest in creating enabling conditions for both the banks and the poor  for  a \nmutually rewarding relationship.   \n  \n14.2 SRLM wil l assist   the   SHGs   through   imparting   financial  Literacy , extending \ncounselling services on s avings, credit , insurance, pension and training on Micro -\ninvestment  Planning embedded in capacity building.   \n  \n14.3 SRLMs will extend support to banks for improving quality of banking services to \npoor clients including follow -up for recovery of over dues if any, by positioning customer \nrelationship managers (Bank Mitra/ Sakhi) with every bank branch involved in financing \nof SHGs.  \n  \n14.4 Leveraging IT mobile technologies and institutions of poor, youth or SHG member \nas business facilitators and business correspondents.     \n14.5 Community Based Repayment mechanism (CBRM) : One exclusive sub - \ncommittee for SHG Bank Linkage may be formed at village/cluster/ block level which will \nprovide support to the banks in ensuring proper utilization of loan amount, recovery etc. \nThe bank linkage sub - committee members from each village level federation along with \nproject staff will meet once in a month under the chairmanship of the Branch Manager in the branch premises with the agenda items relating to bank linkage.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 \n Annex I   \nKey Features of DAY -NRLM  \n  \n1. Universal Social Mobilization: To begin with, DAY -NRLM would ensure that at \nleast one member from each identified rural poor household, preferably a woman, is \nbrought under the Self Help Group (SHG) network in a time bound manner. Subsequently, both women and men would be organized for addressing livelihoods \nissues i.e. farmers organizations, milk producers\u2019 cooperatives, weavers associations, etc. All these institutions are inclusive and no poor would be left out of them. DAY -NRLM \nwould ensure adequate  coverage  of  vulnerable  sections  of  the  society  such  that  \n50%  of  the beneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are minorities and 3% are persons with disability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of all househol ds \nunder the automatically included criteria and households with at least one deprivation criteria as per Socio- Economic and Caste Census (SECC).  \n  \n2. Participatory Identification of poor (PIP): The experience from SGSY suggests \nthat the current BPL list has  large inclusion and exclusion errors. To widen the target \ngroups beyond the BPL list and to include all the needy poor identified as households \nwith at least one deprivation criteria as per Socio- Economic and Caste Census (SECC). \nDAY-  NRLM will also under take community -based process i.e. participation of the poor in \nthe process of identifying the target group. Participatory process based on sound \nmethodology and tools (social mapping and well -being categorization, deprivation \nindicators) and also locally understood and accepted criterion ensures local consensus \nthat inadvertently reduces the inclusion and exclusion errors and enables formation of \nthe groups on the basis of mutual affinity. Over the years, the participatory method of identifying the poor hav e been developed and applied successfully in the states like AP, \nKerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha.     \nThe households identified with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC along with households identified through the P.I.P process will be accepted as DAY- NRLM target \ngroup and will be eligible for all the benefits under the programme. The list finalized after PIP process will be vetted by the Gram Sabha and approved by the Gram Panchayat.   \n  \nTill the PIP process is undertaken by the State in a particul ar district/Block, the rural \nhouseholds with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC list will be targeted under DAY- NRLM. As already provided in the Framework for implementation of DAY -NRLM, up \nto 30% of the total membership of the SHGs may be from among the population marginally above the poverty line, subject to the approval of other members of the group. \nThis 30% also includes the poor households whose name does not figure in the SECC \nlist but are as poor as those included in SECC list.   \n  \n3. Promot ion of Institutions of the poor: Strong institutions of the poor such as \nSHGs and their village level and higher -level federations are necessary to provide space, \nvoice and resources for the poor and for reducing their dependence on external \nagencies. They  empower them and also act as instruments of knowledge and technology \ndissemination, and hubs of production, collectivization and commerce. DAY -NRLM, 13 \n therefore, would focus on setting up these institutions at various levels. In addition, DAY - \nNRLM would pr omote specialized institutions like Livelihoods collectives, producers\u2019 \ncooperative/companies for livelihoods promotion through deriving economies of scale, \nbackward and forward linkages, and access to information, credit, technology, markets \netc.  \nThe Liv elihoods collectives would enable the poor to optimize their limited resource.   \n  \n4. Strengthening all existing SHGs and federations of the poor. There are \nexisting institutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of \nNGOs. DAY-  NRLM wo uld strengthen all existing institutions of the poor in a partnership \nmode. The selfhelp promoting institutions both in the Government and in the NGO sector would promote social accountability practices to introduce greater transparency. This \nwould be in addition to the mechanisms that would be evolved by SRLMs and state \ngovernments. The learning from one another underpins the key processes of learning in \nDAY- NRLM.  \n  \n5. Emphasis on Training, Capacity building and skill building:  DAY- NRLM \nwould ensure that the poor are provided with the requisite skills for managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods, enhancing their \ncredit absorption capacity and credit worthiness, etc. A multi -pronged approach is \nenvisaged for continuous capacity building of the targeted families, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders. \nParticular focus would be on developing and engaging community professionals and community resource persons fo r capacity building of SHGs and their federations and \nother collectives. DAY - NRLM would make extensive use of ICT to make knowledge \ndissemination and capacity building more effective.   \n6. Revolving Fund and Community investment support Fund (C.I.F): A \nRevol ving Fund would be provided to eligible SHGs as an incentive to inculcate the habit \nof thrift and accumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long-\nrun and immediate consumption needs in the short -run. The C.I.F would be a corpus an d \nused for meeting the members\u2019 credit needs directly and as catalytic capital for leveraging repeat bank finance. The C.I.F would be routed to the SHGs through the \nFederations. The  key  to  coming  out  of  poverty  is  continuous  and  easy  access  to  \nfinance,  at reasonable rates, till they accumulate their own funds in large measure.   \n  \n7. Universal Financial Inclusion: DAY- NRLM would work towards achieving \nuniversal financial inclusion, beyond basic banking services to all the poor households, \nSHGs an d their federations. DAY -NRLM would work on both demand and supply side of \nFinancial Inclusion. On the demand side, it would promote financial literacy among the poor and provides catalytic capital to the SHGs and their federations. On the supply side, \nit would coordinate with the financial sector and encourage use of Information, \nCommunication & Technology (ICT) based financial technologies, business correspondents and community facilitators like \u2018Bank Mitras\u2019. It would also work towards 14 \n universal coverage of rural poor against loss of life, health and assets. Further, it would \nwork on remittances, especially in areas where migration is endemic.   \n  \n8. Provision of Interest Subvention: The rural poor need credit at low rate of \ninterest and in multiple doses to make their ventures economically viable. In order to \nensure affordable credit, DAY -NRLM has a provision for subvention on interest rate \nabove 7% per annum for all eligible SHGs, who have availed loans from mainstream \nfinancial institutions.   \n  \n9. Funding Pattern: DAY- NRLM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the \nfinancing of the programme would be shared between the Centre and the States in the \nratio of 60:40 (90:10 in case of North Eastern States including Sikkim; completely from \nthe Centre in case of UTs). The Central allocation earmarked for the States would \nbroadly be distributed in relation to the incidence of poverty in the States.   \n  \n10. Phased Implementation: Social capital of the poor consists of the institutions of \nthe poor, their leaders, community professionals and more importantly community resource persons (poor women whose lives have been transformed through the support \nof their institutions). Building up social capital takes some time in the initial years, but it \nmultiplies rapidly after some time.  If the social capital of the poor does not play the lead \nrole in DAY -NRLM, then it would not be a people\u2019s programme. Further, it is important to \nensure that the quality and effectiveness of the interventions is not diluted. Therefore, a \nphased implementation approach is adopted in DAY -NRLM. DAY- NRLM would reach all \ndistricts by the end of 12th Five- year Plan.   \n  \n11. Intensive blocks. The blocks that are taken up for implementation of DAY -NRLM, \n\u2018intensive blocks\u2019, would have access to a full complement of trained professional staff \nand cover a whole range of activities of universal and intense social and financial \ninclusion, livelihoods, partnerships etc. However, in the remaining blocks or non- intensive \nblocks, the activities may be limited in scope and intensity.   \n  \n12. Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs). RSETI concept is built on \nthe model pioneered by Rural Development Self Employment Institute (RUDSETI) \u2013  a \ncollaborative partnership between SDME Trust, Syndicate Bank and Canara Bank. The model  envisages transforming unemployed youth into confident self - employed \nentrepreneurs through a short duration experiential learning programme followed by systematic long duration hand holding support. The need- based training builds \nentrepreneurship qualiti es, improves self -confidence, reduces risk of failure and develops \nthe trainees into change agents. Banks are fully involved in selection, training and post \ntraining follow up stages. The needs of the poor articulated through the institutions of the \npoor w ould guide RSETIs in preparing the participants/trainees in their pursuits of self - \nemployment and enterprises. DAY -NRLM would encourage public sector banks to set up \nRSETIs in all districts of the country.  \n 15 \n Annex II   \n  \n  \nInterest subvention scheme for Women SHGs  \n  \nI.  Interest   subvention   scheme   on   Credit   to   Women   SHG   for   all Commercial \nBanks (only Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks and Regional Rural Banks) and \nCo-operative banks in 250 districts  \n  \ni.

RRBs  and  Cooperative  Banks  will  be  subvented  to  the  extent  of difference   \nbetween   the   maximum  lending  rates  (as  specified  by NABARD) and 7% subject to \nthe maximum limit of 5.5%. This subvention will be available to all RRBs and Cooperative \nBanks on the condition that they make SHG credit available at 7% p.a. in the 250 districts. RRBs and Cooperative Banks will also get concessional refinance from \nNABARD. Detailed guidelines for RRBs and Cooperative Banks will be issued by \nNABARD.   \n  \nv. Further, the SHGs will be provided with an additional 3% subvention on the   \nprompt repayment of loans.  For the purpose  of  Interest Subvention of additional 3% on \nprompt repayment, an SHG account will be consider ed prompt payee if it satisfies the \nfollowing criterion.   \n  \na. For Cash Credit Limit:     \n  \ni. Outstanding balance shall not have remained in excess of the limit   /drawing power continuously for more than 30 days.  \nii. There should be regular credit and debi ts in the accounts. In any case there shall be at \nleast one customer induced credit during a month.  16 \n  \niii.       Customer induced credit should be sufficient to cover  the interest debited during \nthe month.  \n  \nb. For the Term loans : A term loan account where all of the interest payments and/or \ninstalments of principal were paid within 30 days of the due date during the tenure of the \nloan, would be considered as an account having prompt payment.  \n  \nAll prompt payee SHG accounts as on the end of the reporting quarter will be eligible for \nthe additional interest subvention of 3%. The banks should credit the amount of 3% \ninterest subvention to the eligible SHG  loan accounts and thereafter seek the \nreimbursement.  \n  \nvi. The    Interest    Subvention    scheme    shall    be    implemented    for    all \ncommercial banks (excluding RRBs) through a Nodal Bank selected by the Ministry of \nRural Development.  \n  \nvii. For the RRBs and Cooperative Banks the scheme will be operationalized by \nNABARD similar to the short -term crop loan sc heme.   \n  \nviii. All Commercial Banks (including the PSBs, Private Banks and RRBs) who are \noperating on the Core Banking Solutions (CBS) can avail the interest subvention under the scheme.  \n  \nix. In order to avail the Interest Subvention on credit extended to the SHGs  @ 7%, \nregular subvention, all commercial banks (excluding RRBs) are required to upload the \nSHG loan account information on the Nodal Bank\u2019s portal as per the required technical \nspecification. Banks must submit the claims for 3% additional subvention on the same \nportal.   \n  \nx. The  claims  submitted  by  bank  should  be  accompanied  by  a  Statutory \nAuditor\u2019s certificate (in original) certifying the claims for subvention as true and correct.  \n  \nxi. In order to avail the Interest Subvention on credit extended to t he SHGs @ 7%, all \nRRBs and Cooperative Banks are required to submit their claims to respective NABARD \n- Regional Offices on a quarterly basis as at June, September, December and March. \nThe claims for the last quarter should be accompanied with a Statutory Auditor\u2019s \ncertificate certifying the claims for the Financial Year as true and correct. The claims of \nany Bank for the quarter ending March will be settled by MoRD only on receipt of the \nStatutory Audited certificate for the complete Financial Year by the Bank.  \n  \nxii. RRBs and Cooperative Banks may submit their consolidated claims pertaining to \nthe 3% additional subvention on disbursements made during the entire year to respective 17 \n NABARD - Regional Offices latest by June every year, duly audited by Statutory Auditors \ncertifying the correctness.  \n  \nxiii. Any remaining claim pertaining to the disbursements made during the year and \nnot included during the year, may be consolidated separately and marked as an \n'Additional Claim ' and submitted to Nodal Bank (for all Commerc ial banks except RRBs) \nand NABARD Regional Offices (for all RRBs and Cooperative Banks) latest by June \nevery year, duly audited by Statutory Auditors certifying the correctness.  \n  \nxiv. Any corrections in claims by PSBs and Pvt. Sector Banks shall be adjusted f rom \nlater claims based on auditor\u2019s certificate. The corrections must be made on the nodal \nbanks portal accordingly.  \n  \nxv. For process of submission of claims by RRBs and Cooperative Banks, detailed \nguidelines will be issued by NABARD   \n  \nII.  Interest subvention scheme for Category II Districts (Other than 250 \ndistricts) .  \n  \nFor category II districts, comprising of districts other than the above 250 districts, all \nwomen SHGs under DAY -NRLM will continue to be eligible for interest subvention to \navail the loan facility at an interest rate of 7%. The funding for this subvention will be \nprovided to the State Rural Livelihoods Missions (S.R.L.Ms). The State- wise distribution \nof the provision under this budget head would be determined each year. In the Category \nII districts, Banks will charge the SHGs as per their respective lending norms and the \ndifference between the lending rates and 7% subjected to a maximum limit of 5.5% will be subvented in the loan accounts of the SHGs by the SRLM. In pursuance of the above, \nthe salient features and the operational guidelines in respect of the interest subvention \nfor the category II districts, are as follows:  \n \n(A) Role of the Banks:  \n  \nAll banks who are operating on the Core Banking Solution (CBS) are required to furnish the details of the Credit disbursement and Credit outstanding of the SHGs across all \ndistricts in the desired format as suggested by the MoRD, directly from the CBS platform, to the Ministry of Rural  Development  (through  FTP)  and  to  the  SRLMs.  The \ninformation should be provided on a monthly basis to facilitate the calculation and \ndisbursement of the Interest Subvention amount to SHGs.  \n  \nB) Role of the State Governments:   \n  \ni. All women SHGs, comprising of more than 70% BPL or rural poor members (rural \npoor as per the Participatory Identification Process) are regarded as SHGs under DAY -\nNRLM. Such SHGs, comprising of rural poor members from the intended DAY -NRLM 18 \n target group will be eligible for interest subvention on credit up to ` 3 lakhs at the rate of \n7% per annum on prompt repayment.  \n  \nii. This schem e will   be   implemented   by   the   State   Rural   Livelihood Missions \n(SRLMs). SRLMs will provide interest subvention to the eligible SHGs who have accessed loan from Commercial and Cooperative Banks. The f unding for this subvention \nwill be met out of the Central Allocation: State Contribution in the ratio of 75:25.  \n  \niii. The SHGs will be subvented with the extent of difference between the lending \nRate of the banks  and  7%  subjected  to a maximum limit of 5.5% by the  SRLMs, \ndirectly on a monthly / quarterly  basis.  An e- transfer of the subvention amount will be \nmade by the SRLM to the loan accounts of the SHGs who have repaid promptly.   \n  \niv. Women SHGs who have availed capital subsidy under SGSY in their exist ing \nloans, will not be eligible for benefit of Interest Subvention for their subsisting loan under \nthis scheme.                       \n  \nv. SRLMs should submit Quarterly Utilization Certificate indicating subvention \namounts transferred to the Loan accounts of the eligible SHGs        \nThe States with state specific interest subvention schemes are advised to. harmonize their gui delines with the Central scheme.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 19 \n  \nAnnexure III   \nList of 250 eligible Districts for

Credit Facilities to Minority Communities : \n \nThe Government of India has indicated that care should be taken to see that minority \ncommunities secure, in a fair and adequate measure the benefits flowing from various \nGovernment sponsored schemes. Accordingly, a ll commercial banks are  advised to \nensure smooth flow of bank credit to minority communities.  \n \nGovernment of India has also forwarded a list of 121 minority concentration districts having at least 25% minority population, excluding those Stat es / UTs where minorities \nare in majority (J & K, Punjab, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Lakshadweep). Accordingly all scheduled commercial banks are requested to specially monitor the \ncredit flow to minorities in these 121 districts, thereby, ensuring t hat the minority \ncommunities receive a fair and equitable portion of the credit within the overall target of the priority sector  (list of Minority Concentration Districts at Annexure I\n). \n \nIn terms of Reserve Bank's extant guidelines  on lending to priority sector, a target of 40 \npercent of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent amount of Off -\nBalance Sheet Exposures (OBE), whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for lending to the prior ity sector by domestic scheduled \ncommercial banks and foreign banks with 20 and above branches , for Small Finance \nBanks it is 75% of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) . Within this, a sub -target of \n10 per cent of ANBC or Credit Equivalent amount of OBE,  whichever is higher, as on \nMarch 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for lending to weaker sections \nwhich includes, among others, persons from minority communities . \n \n \n2.        Definition of Minority Communities  \n \n2.1 The following communities have been notified as minority communities by the \nGovernment of India,  Ministry  of Minority Affairs ; \n(a)    Sikhs   \n(b)    Muslims   \n(c)    Christians   \n(d)    Zoroastrians   \n(e)    Buddhists  \n(f)     Jains  \n \n    \n  \n2 \n  \n \n 2.2 In the case of a partnership firm, if the majority of the partners belong to one or the \nother of the specified minority communities, advances granted to such partnership firms \nmay be treated as advances granted to minority communities. Further, if the majori ty \nbeneficial ownership in a partnership firm belongs to the minority community, then such lending can be classified as advances to the specified communities. A company has a \nseparate legal entity and hence advances granted to it cannot be classified as \nadvances to the specified minority communities.  \n \n3. Creation of Special Cell and Designating an exclusive Officer  \n \n3.1 A Special Cell should be set up in each bank to ensure smooth flow of credit to \nminority communities and it should be headed by an officer holding the rank of      \nDeputy General Manager/Assistant General Manager or any other similar rank who should functi on as a 'Nodal Officer'.  \n \n3.2  The Lead Bank in each of the minority concentration districts should have an officer \nwho shall exclusively  look after the problems regarding the credit flow to minority \ncommunities. It shall be his responsibility to publicise among the minority \ncommunities various programmes of bank credit and also to prepare suitable schemes for their benefit in collaboration with branch managers.  \n \n3.3 The designated officer should exclusively look after aspects relating to credit \nassistance  to minority communities in the concerned districts. The designated officer \nmay be attached to the Lead Bank set up at the district level. He would thus, be able \nto receive necessary guidance from Lead Bank Officer, who will be senior enough \nand have adequate experience for liaising effectively with the other credit institutions \nand Government agencies, and will also be working in close collaboration with the \nbranch managers of other banks in the district. The designated officer will also \narrange group meet ings for their guidance for formulation of schemes suitable for \nthe members of the minority communities. It will be necessary for the banks concerned to ensure that the role assigned to the designated officer/s is effectively \nfulfilled.  \n \n3.4 The Convenor banks of the District Consultative Committees (DCCs) and the State           \n       Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs) should ensure that steps taken to facilitate the   \n      flow of credit to the minority communities and the progress made in this regard are  \n      reviewed regularly at their meetings.  \n  \n  \n3 \n  \n3.5  The Convenor banks of DLRC/SLRM/SLBCs may invite Chairman/ Managing \nDirectors of State Minority Commissions/Boards or the State Minorities Financial \nCorporations or their representatives to attend the meetings of District Level Review Committee (DLRC), State Level Review Meeting (SLRM) and State Level Bankers \nCommittee (SLBC).  \n \n \n3.6  Names, designation and office addresses of (i) the officer -in-charge of the Special \nCell at Head Office and (ii) officer appointed by Lead Banks in the identified districts \nto look after exclusively the problems of minority communities, should be furnished by banks to the National Commission for Minorities at the following address and \nupdated periodically:  \nThe Secretary  \nNational Commission for Minorities  \nGovernment of India  \n5\nth Floor ,Lok Nayak Bhawan \nKhan Market  \nNew Delhi 110 003  \n \nA copy of the relevant communication may also be furnished to Financial Inclusion  \nand Development  Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai.  \n \n \n3.7  The Lead Banks in the identified districts having concentration of minority \ncommunities may involve the State Minority Commission / Finance Corporation in \nthe extension work including creating awareness, identification of beneficiaries, \npreparation of v iable projects, provision of backward and forward linkages such as \nsupply of inputs/marketing, recovery etc.  \n \n3.8  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may collaborate with DDMs of NABARD/ \nNGOs/ Voluntary Organizations in reaching the poor through Self H elp Groups \n(SHGs). Lead Banks of the Minority Concentration Districts will have to exercise the pro-active role expected of them to ensure that the minority communities, \nparticularly those who are poor and illiterate have access to bank credit for taking up productive activities.  \n \n4 Advances under DRI Scheme  \nBanks may route loans under the DRI scheme through State Minority Finance/Development Corporation on the same terms and conditions as are \napplicable to loans routed through SC/ST Development Corporations,  subject to the \nbeneficiaries of the Corporations meeting the eligibility criteria and other terms and conditions prescribed under the scheme. Banks may ensure proper maintenance of \nthe register to evolve timely sanction and disbursement of loan applications.   \n  \n4 \n  \n5.   Monitoring  \n5.1 With a view to monitoring the performance of banks in providing credit to the \nspecified minority communities, data on credit assistance provided to members of minority communities should be furnished to Reserve Bank of India and to the \nGovernment of India,  Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Minority Affairs, on half \nyearly basis as at the end of March and September every year. The statements \n(given in Annexure II\n) should reach RBI within one month from the end of each half \nyear.\u201d  \n \n \n5.2  The Conveno r banks of the District Consultative Committees in the identified \nminority concentrated districts should furnish the data on priority sector advances \ngranted by banks to specified minority communities compiled by them in the \nprescribed format (vide Annexure III ) for the district under their lead responsibility to \nthe concerned Regional Offices of RBl within one month from the close of the relative quarter.  \n \n5.3  The progress made in regard to the flow of credit to the min ority communities \nshould be reviewed regularly at the meetings of the District Consultative \nCommittees (DCCs) and the State Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs).  \n \n \n5.4  The Lead Banks in the identified minority concentrated districts should furnish the \nrelevant ex tracts of the agenda notes and the minutes of the meetings of the DCCs \nand of the respective SLBCs to the Union Ministry of Finance and to the Ministry of Minority Affairs  on a quarterly basis for their use.  \n \n6 Training  \n \n6.1  With a view to ensuring that the bank staff and officers have proper perspective and \nappreciation of the various programmes for welfare of minorities, necessary orientation may be provided to officials and other staff. For this purpose, banks \nshould include suitable lecture sessions as part of all relevant training programmes \nlike induction courses, programmes on rural lending, financing of priority sectors, \npoverty alleviation programmes, etc.  \n \n6.2  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may sensitise and motivate the staff \nposted to identified districts through proper training to assist the minority communities under various credit schemes.  \n  \n  \n5 \n 6.3  The Lead Banks may organize sensitization workshops for bank officials regarding \nmicro credit/ lending to SHGs with  the help of DDMs of NABARD.  \n \n6.4  The Lead Banks functioning in the identified districts should organize Entrepreneur \nDevelopment Programmes so that the members of the minority communities in \nthese areas are enabled to derive the benefit of various programmes  being financed \nby the banks. Depending upon the major vocation and type of activity undertaken by large sections of the people in the districts, suitable programmes may be organized \nin co -operation with State Governments, Industries Department, District I ndustries \nCentre, SIDBI, State Technical Consultancy Organization, Khadi and Village Industries Commission and other voluntary organizations which are fully equipped to \nimpart such training and orientation. The duration of the programme, the course \ncontent , the faculty support to be selected etc. should be decided by each Lead \nBank taking into account the prevailing conditions, need and existing skills as well as aptitude of the people in the district.  \n \n7 Publicity  \n \n7.1  There should be good publicity about various anti -poverty programmes of the \nGovernment where there is large concentration of minority communities and \nparticularly in the districts listed in the Annexure I  which have a concentration of \nminority communities.  \n \n7.2  The Lead Banks in the identified districts may create awareness among minority \ncommunities regarding credit facilities available from banks through appropriate \nmeasures which may include publicity through (i) print media i.e. dis tribution of \npamphlets in local languages, advertisements/articles in newspapers etc. (ii) TV channels - DD/ local channels, (iii) participation / setting up of stalls in the Melas / \nfairs organized during the religious /festive occasions by these communit ies. \n \n8.   National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC)  \n \n8.1  National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC) was  \nestablished in September 1994 to promote economic and developmental activities for the backward sections amongst the minorities. NMDFC works as an apex body \nand channelises its funds to the beneficiaries through the State Minority Finance \nCorporation of t he respective State/Union Territory Governments.  \n   \n  \n6 \n  \n \n8.2  The NMDFC is operating, inter -alia, the Margin Money Scheme. Bank finance \nunder the scheme will be upto 60 percent of the project cost. The remaining amount \nof the project cost is shared by NMDFC, the S tate channelising agency and the \nbeneficiary in the proportion of 25%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. Banks may implement the Margin Money scheme evolved by NMDFC. While extending bank \nfinance, banks should bear in mind the guidelines/instructions issued by RB I from \ntime to time on priority sector advances. It may be ensured that the assets created out of the loan amount are mortgaged / hypothecated to the banks. Where \nrecoveries have been made by the banks, it would be in order if the amounts are \nappropriated first towards bank dues.  \n \n9 Prime Minister\u2019s 15 Point Programme for the Welfare of Minorities  \nGovernment of India has revised the \u201cPrime Minister\u2019s New 15- Point Programme for \nthe Welfare of Minorities\u201d. An important objective of the Programme is to ensure th at \nan appropriate percentage of the priority sector lending is targeted for the minority communities and that the benefits of various government sponsored schemes reach \nthe under -privileged, which includes the disadvantaged sections of the minority \ncommuni ties. The New Programme is to be implemented by the Central \nMinistries/Departments concerned through State Governments/Union Territories \nand envisages location of certain proportion of development projects in minority \nconcentration districts. Accordingly, all scheduled commercial banks are required to \nensure that within the overall target for priority sector lending and the sub- target of \n10 percent for the weaker sections, sufficient care is taken to ensure that minority \ncommunities also receive an equitabl e portion of the credit. Lead Banks have been \nadvised to keep this requirement in view while preparing district credit plans.  \n \n \n                                            ------------------------------------  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n7 \n  \nAnnexure I \nList of 121 Minority Concentration Districts  \n(Vide paragraph 3.3, 5.3 and 7.1)  \nSl.

NULM has been under implementation w.e.f. September 24, 2013 in all \ndistrict headquarters (irrespective of population) and all the cities with \npopulation of 1 lakh or  more.  \n The Self Employment Program (SEP) of NULM focus es on providing financial \nassistance through provision of interest subsidy on loans to support establishment of I ndividual & Group Enterprises and S elf-Help Groups \n(SHGs) of urban poor. The erstwhile provision of capital subsidy for USEP (Urban Self Employment Program) and UWSP (Urban Women Self -Help \nProgram) under  SJSRY has been replaced by interest subsidy for loans to \nIndividual enterprise (SEP -I), Group enterprise  (SEP -G) and Self Help \nGroups ( SEP- SHGs). With a view to improving the livelihood opportunities for \nthe poor in urban areas, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation \n(UPA Division), Government of India vide their Office Memorandum No.K -\n14011/2/2012- UPA/FTS- 5196 dated February 19, 2016 has enhanced  the \nscope of National Urban Livelihoods Mission. The Mission with enhanced \nscope was renamed as \u201cDeendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban \nLivelihoods Mission (DAY -NULM)\u201d.  \n \nThe operational guidelines of the Self Employment Program (SEP) \ncomponent of DAY -NULM are as under:  \n1. Introduction:  \n1.1 The SEP  provides  financial assistance to individuals/groups \nincluding street venders/hawkers of urban poor for setting up gainful \nself-employment ventures/ micro -enterprises, suited to their skills, \ntraining, aptitude and local conditions. The programme also support s \nSelf Help Groups (SHGs) of urban poor to access easy credit from \nbank and avail interest subsidy on SHG loans. The SEP will also \nfocus  on technology, marketing and other support services to the \nabove beneficiaries engaged in micro enterprises for their livelihoods  \nand will also facilitate issuance of credit cards for working capital \nrequirement of the entrepreneurs.  \n    \n3 \n 1.2 The underemployed and unemployed urban poor will be encouraged \nto set up small enterprises relating to manufacturing, servic e and \nsmall business for which there is considerable local demand. Local \nskills and local crafts should be particularly encouraged. Each Urban \nLocal B ody (ULB) should develop a compendium of such \nactivities/projects keeping in view skills available, marketability of \nproducts, costs, economic viability etc.  \n \n1.3 The percentage of women beneficiaries under SEP shall not be less \nthan 30 percent. SCs and STs must be benefited at least to the \nextent of the proportion of their strength in the city/town population of \npoor. A special provision of 3 percent reservation should be made \nfor the differently -abled under this program. In view of the Prime \nMinister\u2019s 15 -Point Program for the Welfare of Minorities, at least 15 \npercent of the physical and financial targets under this component \nshall be earmarked for the minority communities.  \n \n2. Selection of Beneficiary & Procedure for Sponsoring Applications:  \nThe Community Or ganizers (COs) and professionals from Urban Local \nBody (ULB) will identify the prospective beneficiaries from among the urban \npoor. The community structures formed under Social Mobilization & \nInstitutional Development (SM&ID) component of DAY - NULM viz. Se lf \nHelp Groups (SHGs) and Area Level Federations (ALFs) may also refer \nprospective individual and group entrepreneurs for purpose of financial assistance under SEP to ULB. The beneficiaries may directly approach \nULB or its representatives for assistance.  Banks may also identify \nprospective beneficiaries at their end and forward such cases directly to ULB. The Banks  may also use their empaneled Business Correspondents \n(BCs) and Business Facilitators (BFs) to increase the outreach. Due  \ndiligence wil l be under taken as per the Banks\u2019 policy, in this regard.   \n \n2.1 The application for individual and group enterprise loans will be \nsponsored by the Urban Local Body (ULB) which will be the sponsoring agency for the individual and group enterprise.  \n \n2.2 The ULB will create awareness regarding SEP to the prospective \nbeneficiaries through mass media campaigns, Information Education \nand Communication (IEC) activities, adv ertisements in local \nnewspapers, City Livelihoods Centres (CLCs) etc. The ULB may also disseminate information regarding this component through active \ninvolvement of Resource Organizations and its field staff.  \n \n2.3 The beneficiaries desirous of seeking financial assistance for setting up \nan enterprise can submit an application of intent to the concerned ULB \nofficials on a plain paper with basic details viz: Name, Age, Contact    \n4 \n details, Address, Aadhaar details (if any), amount of loan required, \nbank account number (if available), type of enterprise/ activity, category \netc. The intent could also be sent by mail /post to the ULB office. The \nULB shall accept such intents throughout the year.  \n \n2.4 The community structures formed under Social Mobilization & \nInstitutional Development (SM&ID) component of DAY -NULM viz: Self \nHelp Groups (SHGs)/ Area Lev el Federations (ALFs) may also refer \nprospective individual and group entrepreneurs for purpose of financial \nassistance under SEP to ULB.  \n \n2.5 On submission/receipt of the intent from the beneficiary the respective \nULB will enter the details in a register/ or MIS if available and hence will \ngenerate a waiting list of beneficiaries. The ULB will issue an acknowledgement to the beneficiary with a unique registration number, \nwhich may be used as a reference number for tracking the status of \napplication.  \n \n2.6 ULB will call the beneficiaries in order of the waiting list to complete \nrequisite documentation including filling of Loan Application Form (LAF), activity details, identity proof, address proof, bank account \ndetails etc. To verify the identity of the benefi ciary, her/his Aadhar \nnumber will also be brought on record. If beneficiary does not have Aadhaar card, his/ her any other unique identification document like \nvoters\u2019 card, driving license etc. will be taken and s/he will be helped to obtain Aadhar card as  soon as possible. The State Urban Livelihoods \nMission (SULM)  may develop a Loan Application Form (LAF) in \nsuitable format in consultation with State Level Bankers Committee \n(SLBC) convenor bank. The same LAF may be utilised across the \nState/UTs. The Loan Application Form (LAF) will contain basic data in \nrespect of economic status of the beneficiary and her/his family. This data will be such that it can be used to analyse impact of the benefits \non her/his economic status at a later stage.  \n \n2.7 A Task Force constituted at ULB level will scrutinize the applications \nbased on experience, skills, viability of activity, scope of the activity etc. Thereafter, the Task Force will shortlist the applications and call for \ninterview of the applicants before recommending  or rejecting the \napplication or call for additional information from the applicant if required.  \n \n2.8 The Chief Executive Officer (CEO)/ Municipal Commissioner of ULB will \nbe responsible to constitute the Task Force and will be the Chairman of \nthe Task for ce. There could be more than 1 task force at ULB level \ndepending upon the size/population of the ULB.     \n5 \n  \n \n2.9 The indicative composition of the Task Force is as follows:  \n \nSr.  \nNo. TASK Force at ULB level  Role  \n1. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) ULB/ Municipal \nCommissioner of ULB/ or any representative \nauthorized by CEO ULB  Chairman  \n2. Lead District Manager (LDM)  Member  \n3. City Project Officer (CPO), ULB/ or any authorized \nrepresentative of ULB  Member \nConvenor  \n4. Representative from District Industries Centre (DIC)  Member  \n5. Senior Branch Managers (Max -2) of banks  Member  \n6. Representatives(2) of Area Level Federation / City \nLevel Federation Member  \n \n2.10 The task force will then recommend the applications if found suitable, \nreject if found unsuitable or ask the beneficiary to submit further \nrequisite information for re- examination on case to case basis.  \n \n2.11 The case duly recommended by the task force wi ll be forwarded by \nthe ULB to the concerned banks for further processing. Such cases recommended by task force have to be processed by concerned \nbanks within a time frame of 15 days. As these cases are already \nrecommended by the task force, such cases should be rejected by \nbanks only in exceptional circumstances.  \n \n2.12 The banks will send a periodic report to the ULB on the status of the \napplications received. In case of MIS being used, the banks may be allowed to update the status of application online in addition to \nmanual report.  \n \n2.13 Banks may also directly accept the loan applications of urban poor \nbeneficiaries on the basis of relevant documents as per the guidelines \nof Prime Minister MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) or any other such scheme \nwithout the need of having prior sponsoring from ULB . The banks can \nsend details of such loans sanctioned by them to ULBs for confirmation of their eligibility for interest subsidy under DAY -NULM. \nTask Force constituted for scrutinizing applications should quickly clear these applications if they otherwise meet the criteria. On \nconfirmation of their eligibility, interest subsidy may be claimed from \nULBs on the pattern of interest subsidy claim for beneficiaries \nsponsored by ULBs . The subsidy will be transferred directly to the    \n6 \n loan account of DAY -NULM beneficiaries. This procedure will also be \ndirect  benefit transfer compl iant.  \n3. Educational Qualifications and Training Requirement:  \n    No minimum educational qualification is required for prospective \nbeneficiaries under this component. However where the identified activity \nfor micro -enterprise development requires some special skills appropriate \ntraining must be provided to the beneficiaries before extending financial \nsupport . \n3.1 Emp loyment through Skills Training and Placement (EST&P):  \nFinancial assistance should be extended only after the prospective \nbeneficiary has acquired required skills for running the proposed \nmicro -enterprise. Such training may not be necessary if the \nbenefici ary has already undergone training from a known institution, \nregistered NGO/Voluntary Organization or trained under any \ngovernment scheme provided requisite certificate is produced. In \ncase the beneficiary has acquired requisite skills from family \noccupati on such cases should be certified by the ULB before \nextending financial assistance.  \n \n3.2 Entrepreneurship Development Program (EDP): In addition to \nskill training of the beneficiaries, the ULB will also arrange to conduct \nEntrepreneurship Development Program for 3 -7 days for individual \nand group entrepreneurs. The EDP will cover basics of entrepreneurship development such as management of an enterprise, basic accounting, financial management, marketing, \nbackward and forward linkages, legal procedures, costing and \nrevenue etc. In addition to above topics the module should also include group dynamics, allocation of work, profit sharing \nmechanism etc. for group enterprises.  \n \n3.3 The EDP module may be developed and finalized by State Urban \nLivelihoods Mission (SULM) supported by State Mission \nManagement Unit (SMMU) with assistance of an empaneled \ninstitution/agency or consulting firm and same may be utilized for \nconducting training program by the ULB. This EDP training may be \narranged through institutions such as Rural Self Employment \nTraining Institutes (RSETI), reputed institutions engaged in \nentrepreneurship development/ training, management/ educational \ninstitutes,  reputed NGOs  engaged in entrepreneurship \ndevelopment/ training etc.  \n    \n7 \n 3.4 Follow -up entrepreneurial support to Individual and Group \nentrepreneurs:    After financing to Individual and Group \nbeneficiaries, the ULB will also arrange to conduct follow -up \nEntrepreneurship Development Programme (EDP) as and when \nrequired. Such programme should preferably be conducted once in \nsix months for each beneficiary who has been given a loan.  During \nthe follow -up EDP, problems and issues faced by beneficiaries \nshould also be discussed and solutions should be given.   \n \n4. Pattern of Financial Assistance:   \nThe financial ass istance available to urban poor in setting up individual and \ngroup enterprises will be in the form of Interest subsidy on the bank loans. \nInterest subsidy, over and above 7% rate of interest will be available on a \nbank loan for setting up of individual or group enterprises. The difference \nbetween 7% p.a. and the rate of interest charged by the bank will be \nprovided to banks under DAY -NULM. Interest subsidy will be given only in \ncase of timely repayment of loan. Suitable certification from banks will be \nobtained in this regard. An additional 3 percent interest subvention will be \nprovided to all Women Self Help Groups (WSHGs) who repay their loan in \ntime. The Interest subsidy will be subject to timely repayment of the loan \n(as per the loan repayment schedule) and suitable certification obtained \nfrom banks by the ULB. The additional 3% interest subvention amount will \nbe reimbursed to the eligible WSHGs. The banks should credit the amount \nof 3% interest subvention to the eligible WHSGs accounts and thereafter seek the reimbursement.  \n \n5. Procedure for interest subsidy to Banks:  \n5.1 All sch eduled commercial banks (SCBs)  and Small Finance Banks  \nwhich are on the Core Banking Solution (CBS) platform would be \neligible for getting interest subvention under the scheme.  \n \n5.2 After disbursement of loan to the beneficiaries, the concerned \nbranch of the bank will send details of disbursed loan cases to ULB along with details of interest subsidy amount.  \nProcedure I  \n \n5.3 The settlement of claims made by banks would be done on quarterly basis by the ULBs, however the submission of claims should be \nmonthly. The ULB will check the data at their end and will release \nthe interest subsidy amount (difference between 7% p.a. and \nprevailing rate of interest) to the banks.      \n8 \n 5.4 A prescribed format for interest subsidy claims for loans  under this \ncomponent is enclosed at ( Annex -I) \n \n5.5 The claims should not be pending more than a quarter. In case the \nclaims of the banks are not settled for a period of 6 months, SLBC is \nempowered to stop the scheme temporarily in selected cities subject \nto clearance of claims by such ULBs. In such eventualities, the \nclaims settlement should prospectively be given to the Lead District \nBank.  \n \nProcedure - II \n \n5.6 Settlement  of Claims: Nodal Agency for releasing interest \nsubsidy:  A public sector bank may be engaged by each State as \nnodal bank in consultation with the convener of the respective \nState Level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC).  All the Banks will \nconsolidate data regarding interest s ubsidy from their branches \nand upload on the portal of Nodal Bank. The nodal bank, after verification, will transfer the interest subsidy to the bank branches.  \nThe State/UT will deposit some funds in advance with the nodal \nbank, which will release funds t o the bank branches as per \nguidelines of the DAY -NULM. Nodal bank will regularly render \naccount of reimbursement to the SULM. This procedure will be \nfollowed in all three types of loans i.e. SEP (I), SEP (G) and SHG -\nBank Linkage.  \n \n6.

SHG -Bank Linkage \u2013  General Guidelines \nLinking of SHGs with banks have been emphasized in the Monetary policy \nof Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget announcements from  time to \ntime and various guidelines in this regard have been issued by the Reserve \nBank of India (RBI) to banks. To scale up the SHGs linkage program and \nmake it sustainable, banks have been advised to consider lending to SHGs \nas part of their mainstream credit operations both at policy and \nimplementation level.  \n \n8.1 Master Circular of RBI on SHG- Bank Linkage Programme, \nFIDD.FID.BC.  No.04/12.01.033/2018- 19 dated July 02, 2018  contains \ninstructions on opening of Savings Bank Account of Self Help Groups \n(whether registered or unregistered), which are engaged in promoting \nhabit of savings among their members as a starting point. Thereaf ter, \nthe SHGs may be sanctioned Savings Linked Loans (varying from a saving to loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4) after due assessment or grading by \nbanks. However, in case of matured SHGs, loans may be given \nbeyond the limit of four times the savings as per the di scretion of the \nbank.  The Banks have also been instructed that the advances to \nSHGs irrespective of the purposes for which the members of SHGs    \n11 \n should be included by the banks as part of their lending to the weaker \nsections.  \n \n8.2 Under Social Mobilization & Institution Development (SM&ID) \ncomponent of DAY -NULM, the ULB will do necessary groundwork to \nopen bank accounts for SHGs and facilitating access to Revolving \nFund (RF). The ULB may also engage Resource Organization (RO) \nfor the purpose or may directly facilitate SHGs through its staff. \n(Concept & Formation of SHGs, ROs and Revolving Fund has been \ndetailed out in Social Mobilization & Institutional Development \n(SM&ID) component of DAY - NULM).  \n 8.3 The banks will send the details of disbursed loan cases t o the ULB \nalong with the calculation details of the interest subsidy amount. The \nULB will check  the data at their end and will release the inter est \nsubsidy amount on quarterly  basis to the banks following a similar \nprocedure as mentioned in Para 5.The prescribed format for claiming \nthe additional i nterest subvention is enclosed at ( Annex \u2013II\n). \n \n8.4 The ULB through its field staff or Resource Organization (ROs) will \nfacilitate filling of loan applications for eligible SHGs to acces s credit \nfrom the banks. The ULB will be responsible to forward the Loan \napplication of the SHGs to the concerned banks with requisite \ndocumentation. The ULB will maintain area wise, bank -wise, ROs/ \nStaff wise data of SHGs loan applications forwarded to the banks. The same will be sent to SULM on a monthly basis.  \n \n8.5 In order to ensure effective SHG -Bank Linkage under DAY -NULM, the \nSULM will monitor and review the progress with banks on regular \nbasis and co- ordinate with SLBC for interest subsidy/ subventi on on \nSHG Loans in the state. Active involvement of State level Bankers\u2019 Committee (SLBC) and lead banks may be ensured for sensitization \nof bank and branch staff for financial inclusion of urban poor.  \n \n8.6 It may be noted that the identification, selection, formation and \nmonitoring of SHGs who are to get interest subvention would be the responsibility of State/ ULBs and banks would not be liable for wrong \nidentification of SHGs who get interest subvention.  \n \n8.7 Type of Loan Facility: SHGs can avail either Term loan or a Cash \nCredit Limit (CCL) loan or both based on their needs. In case of need, \nadditional loan can be sanctioned even though the previous loan is \noutstanding.  \n \n8.8 Guidelines for prompt repayment are as follows:     \n12 \n a. For Cash Credit Limit to SHGs:  \ni) Outstanding balance shall not have remained in excess of the \nsanctioned limit/drawing power continuously for more than 30 \ndays.  \n \nii) There sh all be regular credits and debits in the account. In any \ncase there shall be at least one customer induced credit during the month.  \n \niii) Customer induced Credits during a month shall be sufficient to \ncover the interest debited during the month.  \n \nb. For Term Loan to SHGs: A term loan account where all of the \ninterest payments and/or instalments of principal were paid within 30 \ndays of the due date during the entire tenure of the loans would be \nconsidered as an account having prompt payment.  \n \n9. Prog ress Reporting for SEP -I, SEP-G & SEP- SHG  \n9.1 The ULB will prepare a data sheet of the applications recommended by \nthe TASK force along with their status details of the sanction, \ndisbursement and rejection (along with reasons) after validating the \nsame with the respective banks. This data sheet will be sent to SULM \non a monthly basis.  \n \n9.2 The SULM will compile all the reports received from respective ULBs \nand will communicate to M/o HUPA on a monthly basis.  \n 9.3 SULM must ensure that progress under SEP is reviewed in every SLBC \nand District Consultative Committee (DCC) meetings. Any other important issue with regard to SEP may be taken up by SULM with \nSLBC convener bank for effective coordination and implementation.  \n10. Credit Card for enterprise development  \n10.1 The financial assistance to the individual entrepreneurs though subsidized loan for setting up of enterprises under DAY -NULM could \nbe viewed as initial impetus to facilitate livelihood support to the \nurban poor. However the individual entrepreneurs require further \nfinancial support in terms of working capital to make the enterprise \neconomically sustainable. This may include immediate and short \nterm monthly requirement of cash for meeting expenses for \npurchase of goods, raw materials and other miscell aneous \nexpenditures etc. The micro- entrepreneur does not have a regular \nfixed monthly cash inflow/income to meet expenses arising out of entrepreneurial activities. To approach a financial institution for such    \n13 \n immediate credit requirement, it requires proc edural documentation \nand consumes a lot of time. This need for working capital credit is \ngenerally met from informal sources of credit (including money \nlenders) which is typically available at high rate of interest.  \n \n10.2 In order to support the micro- entrepreneurs to meet their working \ncapital and miscellaneous credit needs, DAY -NULM will facilitate \naccess to  Credit Cards  or MUDRA Card through banks.  \n \n10.3 The SULM in consultation with the State Level Bankers Committee \n(SLBC) will finalize the norms, limits and spec ifications for issuance \nof Credit  Card (or) MUDRA Card to the individual entrepreneurs. The \nGeneral Credit Card Scheme (GCC), which is being implemented by \nall scheduled commercial banks or any other variant of credit cards \nfor enterprise development of banks in urban areas, may be \nexplored by SULM and SLBC for the same. The Circular on revised \nGCC scheme has been issued by RBI notification vide \nRPCD.MSME& NFS.BC.No.61/06.02 .31/2013- 14 dated December \n02, 2013  available on RBI web- site \u2018www.rbi.org.in \u2019. \n \n10.4 The ULB will identify the prospective beneficiaries and will facilitate \nlinkages with banks for issuance of credit cards. The focus is to \ninitially facilitate issuance of credit card to cover all the beneficiaries \nwho have availed financial assistance under SEP.  Additionally,  other \nbeneficiaries who are running their own business but have not \navailed assistance under SEP may also be cover ed if they satisfy \nthe norms of issuance of credit cards.  \n \n10.5 The targets for the same may be decided at ULB level and the progress under this component is aggregated at SULM level and \ncommunicated to M/o HUPA periodically.  \n \n11. Technology, Marketing and Other Support  \n \n11.1 Micro entrepreneurs often need support in order to grow and sustain \ntheir businesses. Support needed may be for establishment, \ntechnology, marketing, and other services. Micro entrepreneurs who \nrun very small businesses may need to gain a better understanding \nof what the market needs, demand of the products produced by \nthem, prices, where to sell, etc. Support services under this \ncomponent are envisaged with a view to provide an encouraging \nenvironment for development of micro enterprises.  \n    \n14 \n 11.2 The City Livelihoods Centers (CLCs) established under DAY -NULM \nwill offer services to the micro- enterprises such as in establishment \n(licenses, certificates registration, legal services etc.), production, \nprocurement, technology, processing, marketing, sales, packaging, \naccounting etc. for long term sustainability. CLC s will also provide \nsupport in taking up feasibility/ assessment studies on market \ndemand and market strategy for products and services of micro-\nenterprises.  \n \n11.3 All SEP individual and groups enterprises can avail the services from \nCLCs as per the norms of CLCs. The CLCs with support of ULB may \nalso tie up with various other government schemes which offer \nservices and benefits for micro- enterprise development for the \nbenefit of prospective beneficiaries.  \n \n11.4 The SULM may arrange for additional funds/professional assistance for the purpose of providing above services to CLCs.  \n \n12. Funding Pattern of SEP of DAY -NULM  \n12.1 Funding under this component will be shared between the Centre \nand the States as per the general norms under DAY -NULM.  \n \n12.2 The Ministry will allocate funds to the states on annual basis based \non the targets assigned to the states. The states in consultation with the respective SLBCs and ULBs will decide the targets and \ncorresponding funds will be allocated to ULBs so that full \nreimbursement to the banks on account of Interest subvention is \nsettled during the financial year and no subvention amount remain \noverdue or pending with the States.  \n \n13. Monitoring and Evaluation \n13.1 The S tate Mission management Unit (SMMU)  at the State level and \nCity Mission Management Unit (CMMU) at the ULB level will closely \nmonitor progress of activities / targets under this component, \nundertake reporting and evaluation. The SULM and the \nULB/executing agencies shall report timely progress in formats \nprescribed by the Mission Directorate from time -to-time, indicating \nthe cumulative achievement monthly and up to the end of the quarter \nand key issues in implementation.  \n \n13.2 In addition, under DAY -NULM, a comprehensive and robust IT -\nenabled DAY -NULM MIS will be established for tracking targets and \nachievements. States and ULBs will be required to submit their \nprogress reports online and may also use this tool to monitor    \n15 \n progress on the ground. In the spirit of proactive disclosure of \ninformation and ensuring transparency under DAY -NULM, key \nprogress reports under SEP will also be made available in the public domain in a timely manner.  \n \n13.3 All the SEP beneficiaries should be visited periodically to assess the \nimpact of the benefit and also to know any problem being faced by \nthem.  The Community Organisers (COs) should visit all the \nbeneficiaries in their jurisdiction at least once in three months.  The \nproject officer/ technical experts at CMMU level should visit at least \n50% beneficiaries once in three months.  The observations during the \nfield visit should be kept in record and be uploaded on MIS also.  \n \n13.4 During the field visit mentioned above data on econo mic status of \nthe beneficiaries should be collected and be compared with similar \ndata given in loan application form, to know the impact of the benefit \non the economic conditions of the beneficiaries.  \n \n13.5 Impact analysis studies may also be conducted at suitable interval to assess the impact of benefit under SEP on the economic status of \nthe beneficiaries.  \n \n13.6 To monitor progress of the targets vis -a-vis achievement under DAY -\nNULM, Banks are advised to furnish cumulative progress reports on quarterly basis as per enclosed proforma ( Annex III  & IV\n) to the \nDirector, UPA at dupa- mhupa@nic.in as well as to RBI on email  \nlatest by the end of next month of the quarter to which they relate.  \n \n13.7 Unique Code for loans under NULM:  Banks are advised to \ncategorise these loans under Non- Farm sector and use unique sub-\ncode in their database for loans granted under NULM. Further, separate sub- sub-codes may also be assigned for SEP -I, SEP- G, \nSHG and WSHGs. Proper care must be taken while classifying loans \nunder NULM parti cularly relating to SHG and WSHGs  to enable \ndistinct identification of these loans vis- \u00e0-vis NRLM loans as WSHGs \nare eligible for additional 3 percent interest subvention.  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n16 \n ANNEX -I  \nINTEREST SUBSIDY CLAIMS UNDER DEENDAYAL ANTYODAYA \nYOJANA - NATIONAL URBAN LIVELIHOODS MISSION (DAY- NULM)  \n \n1.

In order to enable \nbanks to have instructions at one place, the Master Circ ular incorporating the existing \nguidelines/instructions on the subject has been updated and enclosed. This Master Circular consolidates the circulars  issued by Reserve Bank on the subject up to June \n30, 2019, as indicated in the A nnex\n.  \n Yours faithfully  \n  (Gautam Prasad Borah)  \nChief General Manager -in-Charge  \nEncl: As above  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n Master Circular on SHG -Bank Linkage Programme  \nSelf Help Groups ha ve the potential to bring together the formal banking structure and the \nrural poor for mutual benefit . Studies conducted by NABARD in a few states to assess the \nimpact of the linkage project have brought out encouraging and positive features like \nincrease in loan volume of the SHGs, definite shift in the loaning pattern of the members \nfrom non -income generating activities to production activities, nearly 100 per cent recovery \nperformance, significa nt reduction in the transaction costs for both the banks and the \nborrowers etc., besides leading to a gradual increase in the income level of the SHG \nmembers. Another significant feature observed in the linkage project is  that about 85 per \ncent of the grou ps linked with banks were formed exclusively by women.  \n2. Recognizing the importance of SHG Bank linkage, banks have been advised to meet the \nentire credit requirements of SHG members, as envisaged in Paragraph 93 of the Union \nBudget announcement for the y ear 2008-09, made by the Honorable Finance Minister, \nwherein it was stated as under: \"Banks will be encouraged to embrace the concept of Total Financial Inclusion. Government will request all scheduled commercial banks to follow the \nexample set by some pub lic sector banks and meet the entire credit requirements of SHG \nmembers, namely, (a) income generation activities, (b) social needs like housing, education, \nmarriage, etc. and (c) debt swapping\".  Linking of SHGs with banks has  thus been \nemphasized in the M onetary Policy Statements of Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget \nannouncements from time to time and various guidelines have been issued to banks in this \nregard.  \n3. Banks should provide adequate incentives to their branches in financing the Self Help \nGroups (SHGs) and establish linkages with them, making the procedures simple and easy. \nThe group dynamics of working of the SHGs need neither be regulated nor formal \nstructures imposed or insisted upon. The approach to financing of SHGs should be totally \nhassle-free and may also include consumption expenditures.  Accordingly, the following \nguidelines  should be adhered to enable effective linkage of SHGs with the banking sector.  \n \n 3 \n 4. Opening of Savings Bank A/ C \na) The SHGs, registered or unregistered, which are engaged in promoting savings habits \namong their members are eligible to open savings bank accounts with banks. These \nSHGs need not necessarily have already availed of credit facilities from banks before \nopening savings bank accounts. The instructions of the Department of Banking \nRegulation in the Master Direction - Know Your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016  \npertaining to SHG members  (Part VI -Paragraph 43)  shall be adhered to , while \ncompleting Customer Due Diligence (CDD)1 process.  \nb) Accordingly, the current  instructions under Simplified norms for Self Help Groups \n(SHGs) mention that  CDD of all the members of SHG as mentioned in the above \nDirection shall not be required while opening the savings bank account of the SHG . \nCDD of all the office bearers shall suffice.  No separate CDD of the members or office \nbearers shall be necessary at the time of credit linking of SHGs.  \n5. Lending to SHGs  \na) Bank lending to SHGs should be included in branch credit plan, block credit plan, district \ncredit plan and state credit plan of each bank. U tmost priority should be accorded to the \nsector in preparation of these plans. It should also form an integral part of the bank\u2019s \ncorporate credit plan.  \nb) As per operational guidelines issued by NABARD, SHGs may be sanctioned savings \nlinked loans by banks (varying from a saving to loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4). However, in \ncase of matured SHGs, loans may be given beyond the limit of four times the savings as \nper the discretion of the bank.  \nc) A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation is a precondition for augmenting flow of credit to SHGs. Banks should strive to remove all operational \nirritants and make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and di sburse credit by \ndelegating adequate sanctioning powers to branch managers. The loan application forms, procedures and documents should be made simple. It would help in providing \nprompt and hassle-free credit.  \n                                                            \n1 Customer Due Diligence - means identifying and verifying the customer and the beneficial owne r 4 \n 6. Interest rates  \nThe banks would have the dis cretion to decide on the interest rates applicable to loans \ngiven to Self Help Groups/member beneficiaries.  \n7. Service/ Processing charges  \nNo loan related and ad hoc service charges/inspection charges should be levied on priority \nsector loans up to \u20b9 25,000. In the case of eligible priority sector loans to SHGs/ JLGs, this \nlimit will be applicable per member and not to the group as a whole.   \n8. Separate  Segment under priority sector  \nIn order to enable the banks to report their SHG lending without difficulty, it is decided that \nthe banks should report their lending to SHGs for on-lending to members of SHGs under \nthe respective categories, viz. 'Advances to SHGs' irrespective of the pur poses for which \nthe loans have been disbursed to the SHG members . Priority Sector loans to SHGs are \nconsidered under \u201cWeaker Sections\u201d category.  \n9. Presence of defaulters in SHGs \nDefaults by a few members of SHGs and/or their family members to the financin g bank \nshould not ordinarily come in the way of financing SHGs per se by banks, provided the SHG is not in default. However, the bank loan may not be utilized by the SHG for financing a \ndefaulter member to the bank.  \n10. Capacity Building and Training  \na) Banks may initiate suitable steps to internalize the SHGs linkage project and organize \nexclusive short duration programmes for the field level functionaries. In addition, suitable awareness/sensitization programmes may be conducted for their middle level c ontrolling \nofficers as well as senior officers.  \nb) Banks shall refer to instructions on Financial Literacy by FLCs and rural branches \u2013 \nPolicy review  vide \nCircular FIDD.FLC.BC.No.22/12.01.018/2016- 17 dated March 02, \n2017  conducting tailored programs targeting SHGs . 5 \n 11. Monitoring and Review of SHG Lending  \nConsidering  the potential of SHGs, banks shall  closely monitor the progress regularly at \nvarious levels. In order to give a boost to the ongoing SHG bank linkage programme for \ncredit flow to the unorganized sector, monitoring of SHG bank linkage programme shall  be a \nregular item on the agenda for discussion at the SLBC and DCC meetings. It should be reviewed at the highest corporate level on a quarterly basis. Further, progress of the programme may be reviewed by banks at regular intervals . The progres s under SHG -BLP, \nas prescribed vide RBI letter FIDD.CO.FID.No.3387/12.01.033/2017 -18 dated April 26, \n2018 shall be reported to NABARD (Micro Credit Innovations Department), Mumbai, on a  \nquarterly  basis, and the returns in the \nprescribed format  shall be submitted  within 15 days \nfrom due date.  \n12. Reporting to CICs  \nRecognizing the importance of credit information reporting in respect of the SHG members \nfor financial inclusion, banks are advised to adhere to the guidelines issued by Department \nof Banking Regulation on Credit information reporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) \nmembers dated June 16, 2016  and Credit information reporting in respect of Self Help \nGroup (SHG) members dated January 14, 2016 . \n------------------------  6 \n Annex \nList of Circulars consolidated in the Master Circular  \nSr. \nNo. Circular No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

Please do not respond in any manner to such offers.   \n \n2 \n Master Circular --Credit Facilities to Scheduled Castes (SCs) & Scheduled Tribes (STs)  \n \nBanks should take the following measures to step up their advances to SCs / STs: \n \n \n1. Planning Process \n \n1.1 The District Level Consultative Committees formed under the Lead Bank Scheme \nshould continue to be the principal mechanism of co-ordination between banks and \ndevelopment agencies in this regard. \n \n1.2 The district credit plans formulated by the lead banks should clearly indicate the \nlinkage of credit with employment and development schemes. \n \n1.3 Banks will have to establish closer liaison with the District Industries Centres, which \nhave been set up in different districts for promoting self-employment.  \n \n1.4 At the block level, a certain weightage is to be given to scheduled castes / scheduled \ntribes in the planning process. Accordingly, the credit planning should be weighted in \nfavour  of scheduled castes / scheduled tribes and special bankable schemes suited \nto members of these communities should be drawn up to ensure their participation in \nsuch schemes and larger flow of credit to them for self-employment. It will be \nnecessary for the banks to consider loan proposals of these communities with utmost \nsympathy and understanding.  \n \n1.5 Banks should periodically review their lending procedures and policies to see that \nloans are sanctioned in time, are adequate and production-oriented and that they \ngenerate incremental income to make them self-liquidating.  \n \n1.6 While 'adopting' villages for intensive lending, villages with sizeable population of \nthese communities may be specially chosen; the alternative of adopting specific \nlocalities (bastis ) in the concerned villages which have a concentration of these \ncommunities could also be considered. \n \n2. Role of Banks \n \n2.1 Bank staff may help the poor borrowers in filling up the forms and completing other \nformalities so that they are able to get credit facility within a stipulated period from the \ndate of receipt of applications.  \n \n2.2 In order to encourage SC / ST borrowers to take advantage of credit facilities, greater \nawareness among them about various schemes formulated by banks will have to be \ncreated. As a majority of the eligible borrowers would be illiterate persons, publicity \nthrough brochures, other literature, etc. will be of limited utility. The more desirable \nmethod would be for the field staff of banks to contact such borrowers and explain to   \n \n3 \n them the salient features of the schemes as also the advantages that will accrue. \nBanks should advise their branches to organize meetings more frequently exclusively \nfor SC / ST beneficiaries to understand their credit needs and to incorporate the \nsame in the credit plan.  \n \n2.3 Circulars issued by RBI / NABARD should be circulated among the staff for \ncompliance.  \n \n2.4 Banks should not insist on deposits while considering loan applications under \nGovernment sponsored poverty alleviation schemes / self-employme nt programmes \nfrom borrowers belonging to SCs / STs. It should also be ensured that applicable \nsubsidy is not held back while releasing the loan component till the full repayment of \nbank dues. Non -release of subsidy upfront amounts to under -financing and hampers \nasset creation / income generation.  \n \n2.5 The National Scheduled Tribes Finance & Development Corporation and National \nScheduled Castes Finance & Development Corporation have been set up under the \nadministrative control of Ministry of Tribal Affairs and Ministry of Social Justice & \nEmpowerment, respectively. The banks should advise their branches / controlling offices to render all the necessary institutional support to enable the institution to \nachieve the desired objectives. \n \n2.6 Advances sanctioned to State sponsored organizations of SC / ST, for the specific \npurpose of purchase and supply of inputs to and / or the marketing of outputs of the \nbeneficiaries viz. artisans, village and cottage industries of these organizations, \nshould be treated as Pri ority Sector Advances, subject to the condition that the \nrelative advances are exclusively for the purpose of purchase and supply of inputs to \nand / or marketing of the outputs of beneficiaries of these organizations.  \n \n2.7 Rejection of loan applications in respect of SCs / STs should be done at the next \nhigher level instead of at the branch level and reasons of rejection should be clearly \nindicated.  \n3. Role of SC / ST Development Corporations \n \nThe Government of India has advised all State Governments that the Scheduled Caste/ \nTribes Development Corporations can consider bankable schemes / proposals for bank finance. As regards Collateral Security and / or third -party  guarantee for loans, guidelines \nissued to banks on priority sector lending will apply.   \n \n  \n \n4 \n  \n4. Reservations for SC / ST Beneficiaries under Major Centrally Sponsored Schemes. \n \nThere are several major centrally sponsored schemes under which credit is provided by \nbanks and subsidy is received through Government Agencies. Credit flow under these \nschemes is monitored by RBI. Under each of these, there is a significant reservation / \nrelaxation for the members of the SC / ST communities. \n \n(i) Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission:  \n \nThe Ministry of Rural Development, Government of Indi a has launched Deendayal \nAntyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods  Mission (DAY-NRLM) by restructuring \nerstwhile Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana, effective from April 01, 2013. DAY -\nNRLM would ensure adequate coverage of vulnerable sections of the soc iety such that \n50% of these beneficiaries are SC/STs. Details  of the scheme are available in the \nMaster Circular on NRLM ( FIDD.G SSD.CO.BC. No.02/09.01.01/2019 -20 dated July 01 , \n2019 ). \n \n \n(ii) Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission:  \n \nThe Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHU A), Government of India, has \nlaunched the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission \n(DAY-NULM) by restructuring erstwhile Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana \n(SJSRY), effective from September 24, 2013, Under DAY -NULM, advances should be \nextended to SCs / STs to the extent of their strength in the loc al population. Details of  \nthe scheme are available in the Master  Circular  on DAY-NULM  \n(FIDD.GSSD.CO.BC.No.01/09.16.03/2019-20 dated July 01, 2019 ). \n \n \n(iii) Differential Rate of Interest Scheme \n \nUnder the DRI Scheme, banks provide finance up to \u20b915,000/- at a concessional rate \nof interest of 4 percent per annum to the weaker sections of the community for \nengaging in productive and gainful activities. In order to ensure that person s \nbelonging to SCs / STs also derive adequate benefit under the Differential Rate of Interest (DRI) Scheme, banks have been advised to grant to eligible borrowers belonging to SCs / STs such advances to the extent of not less than 2/5th (40 \npercent) of total DRI advances. Further, the eligibility criteria under DRI that size of \nland holding should not exceed 1 acre of irrigated land and 2.5 acres of unirrigated \nland are not applicable to SCs / STs. Members of SCs / STs satisfying the income criteria of the scheme can also avail of housing loan up to \u20b9  20,000/- per beneficiary \nover and above the individual loan of \u20b9 15,000/ - available under the scheme.  \n   \n \n5 \n  \n5. Credit Enhancement Guarantee Scheme for Scheduled Castes (CEGSSC)  \nThe CEGSSC was launched by Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment on 6th \nMay, 2015 with the objective to promote entrepreneurship amongst the Scheduled \nCastes (SCs), by providing Credit Enhancement Guarantee to Member Lending \nInstitutions (MLIs), who shall be providing financial assistance to these \nentrepreneurs. IFCI Ltd. has been designated as the Nodal Agency under the \nscheme, to issue the guarantee cover in favour of MLIs, who shall be encouraged \nto finance SCs entrepreneurs to boost entrepreneurship amongst the marginal \nstrata of the society.  \nEligibility: Registered Companies and Societies/Registered Partnership Firms/Sole \nProprietorship firms/Individual SC Entrepreneur having more than 51% \nshareholding by SC entrepreneurs/promoters/members with the management \ncontrol for the past 6 months are eligible for guarantee from IFCI Ltd. against the \nloans extended by MLIs Bank / Institutions.  \nAmount of Guarantee cover under CEGSSC - Min \u20b9 0.15 Cr. & Max. \u20b9 5.00 Cr  \nTenure of Guarantee \u2013  Max. 7 years or repayment period whichever is earlier.  \n \n6. Monitoring and Review  \n \n6.1 A special cell should be set up at the Head Office of banks for monitoring the flow of \ncredit to SC / ST beneficiaries. Apart from ensuring the implementation of the RBI \nguidelines, the cell would also be responsible for collection of relevant information / \ndata from the branches, consolidation thereof and submission of the requisite returns to RBI and Government. \n \n6.2 SLBC convenor Bank  should invite the representative of National Commission for \nSCs / STs to attend SLBC meetings. Besides, the Convener bank may also invite \nrepresentatives from National Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation (NSFDC) and S tate Scheduled Castes and Scheduled \nTribes Finance and Development Corporation (SCDC) to attend SLBC meetings . \n \n6.3 A periodical review should be made by the Head Office of banks of the credit \nextended to SCs / STs on the basis of returns and other data received from the \nbranches.  \n \n6.4 Bank should review the measures taken to enhance the flow of credit to SC / ST \nborrowers on a quarterly basis. The Review should also consider the progress made \nin lending to these communities directly or through the State Level  Scheduled Caste / \nScheduled Tribe Corporations for various purposes based, amongst others, on field visits of the senior officers from the Head Office / Controlling Offices. Any major gap  \n \n6 \n or variation in credit flow to SC/ST on a year to year basis should be reported to \nBoard of the Bank for review under the themes of \u201cFinancial Inclusion\u201d in term of \ncircular DBR  No.BC.93/29.67.001/2014-15 dated May14, 2015 . \n \n7.

A \nrevised version of Master Circular on the subject is annexed for your information and \nnecessary action. This Master Circular is placed in our website www.rbi.org.in . \n  \nYours faithfully  \n \n \n \n(Manas Ranjan Mohanty)  \nChief General Manager  \n  Encl. As above  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n2 \n  \nMaster Circular \u2013  Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated July 01, 2019  \n1.  Facility for exchange of notes and coins at bank branches  \n(a) All branches of banks in all parts of the country are mandated to provide the \nfollowing customer services, more actively and vigorously to the members of public \nso that there is no need for them to approach the RBI Regional Offices for this \npurpose:  \n(i) Issuing fresh / good quality notes and coins of all denominations on demand,  \n(ii) Exchanging soiled / mutilated / defective notes,*  \n* Small Finance Banks and Payment Banks may exchange mutilated and defective \nnotes at their option.  \nand \n (iii) Accepting coins and notes either for  transactions or exchange.   \nIt will be preferable to accept coins, particularly, in the denominations of \u20b9 1 and 2, \nby weighment. However, accepting coins packed in sachets of 100 each would \nperhaps be more convenient for the cashiers as well as the customers. Such sachets \nmay be kept at the counters and made available to the customers.   \n (b) All branches should provide the above facilities to members of public without any \ndiscrimination on all working days. The scheme of providing exchange facility by a \nfew select currency chest branches on one of the Sundays in a month will remain unchanged. The names and addresses of such bank branches should be available \nwith the respective banks.  \n(c) The availability of the above- mentioned facilities at the bank branches should be \ngiven wide publicity for information of the public at large.  \n(d) None of the bank branches should refuse to accept small denomination notes \nand / or coins tendered at their counters.  \n2.  Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 -  Delegation of powers \n(a) In terms of Section 28 read with Section 58 (2) of Reserve Bank of India Act, \n1934, no person is entitled as a right to recover from the Government of India or RBI \nthe value of any lost, stolen, mutilated or imperfect currency note of the GOI or \nbanknote. However, with a view to mitigating the hardship to the public in genuine cases, it has been provided that the RBI may, with the previous sanction of the \nCentral Government, prescribe the circumstances in, and the conditions and  \n \n3 \n limitations subject to w hich, the value of such currency notes or banknotes may be \nrefunded as a matter of grace.  \n(b) With a view to extending the facility for the benefit and convenience of public, all \nbranches of banks have been delegated powers under Rule 2(j) of Reserve Bank of \nIndia (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 for exchange of mutilated / defective notes free of \ncost.  \n (c) The Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 were amended to enable \nthe public to exchange mutilated notes in Mahatma Gandhi (New) series, which are \nsmaller in size compared to the earlier series. T he minimum area of the single \nlargest undivided piece of the note required for payment of full value for notes of rupees fifty and above denominations  were also revised. The Reserve Bank of India \n(Note Refund) Amendment Rules, 2018 have since been notified in the Gazette of India on September 6, 2018.   \n3. Liberalized definition of a Soiled Note  \nIn order to facilitate quicker exchange facilities, the definition of soiled note has been \nexpanded. A \u2018soiled note\u2019 means a note which has become dirty due to normal wear  \nand tear and also includes a two piece note pasted together wherein both the pieces presented belong to the same note and form the entire note with no essential feature missing.  These notes should be accepted over bank counters in payment of \nGovernment dues and for credit to accounts of the public maintained with banks. However, in no case, these notes should be issued to the public as re- issuable notes \nand shall be deposited in currenc y chests for onward transmission to RBI offices as \nsoiled note remittances for further processing.  \n4. Mutilated  Notes \u2013 Presentation and Passing \nA mutilated note is a note of which a portion is missing or which is composed of more than two pieces.  Mutilated notes  may be presented at any of the bank \nbranches . The notes so presented shall be accepted, exchanged and adjudicated in \naccordance with Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules , 2009\n. \n5. Extremely brittle, burnt, charred, stuck up Notes  \nNotes which have turned extremely brittle or are badly burnt, charred or inseparably stuck up together and, therefore, cannot withstand normal handling, shall not be accepted by the bank branches for exchange. Instead, the holders may be advised to tender these notes to the Issue Office concerned where they will be adjudicated \nunder a Special Procedure.  \n6. Procedure for exchange of soiled/ mutilated/ imperfect notes  \n6.1 Exchange of soiled notes \n \n  \n \n4 \n 6.1.1 Notes presented in small number : Where the number of notes presented by a \nperson is up to 20 pieces with a maximum value of Rs.5000 per day, banks should \nexchange them over the counter, free of charge.  \n \n \n6.1.2 Notes presented in bulk : Where the number of notes presented by a person \nexceeds 20 pieces or Rs.5000 in value per day, banks may accept them, against receipt, for value to be credited later. Banks may levy service charges as permitted in Master Circular on Customer Ser vice in Banks \n(DBR.No.Leg.BC.21/09.07.006/ 2015- 16 dated July 1, 2015\n). In case tendered value \nis above Rs.50000, banks are expected to take the usual precautions.  \n \n6.2 Exchange of mutilated and imperfect notes \n \n6.2.1 While designated branches may continue to follow the procedure as laid down \nin Part III of Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules , 2009  (www.rbi.org.in  \n\u2192Publications\u2192Occassional ) for exchanging mutilated and imperfect notes and \nissue receipt for the notes presented for adjudication, non- chest branches are \nrequired to follow the following procedure for notes presented in small numbers and in bulk.  \n \n6.2.2 Notes presented in small number  :  Where the number of notes presented by a \nperson is up to 5 pieces, non- chest branches should normally adjudicate the notes \nas per the procedure laid down in Part III of Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules , 2009 and pay the exchange value ov er the counter. If the non- chest branches \nare not able to adjudicate the mutilated notes, the notes may be received against a receipt and sent to the linked currency chest branch for adjudication. The probable date of payment should be informed to the tenderers on the receipt itself and the same should not exceed 30 days. Bank account details should be obtained from the tenderers for crediting the exchange value by electronic means.  \n \n6.2.3 Notes presented in bulk: Where the number of notes presented by a person is \nmore than 5 pieces not exceeding Rs.5000 in value, the tenderer should be advised \nto send such notes to nearby currency chest branch by insured post giving his / her bank account details (a/c no, branch name, IFSC, etc.) or get them exchanged thereat in person. All other persons tendering mutilated notes whose value exceeds \nRs.5000 should be advised to approach nearby currency chest branch. Currency chest branches receiving mutilated notes through insured post should credit the exchange value to th e account of sender by electronic means within 30 days of \nreceipt of notes.  \n \n6.3 Tenderers aggrieved with the service provided by the banks in this regard may \napproach Banking Ombudsman concerned, following the procedure as laid under Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006 with the bank /postal receipts as proof for necessary action.  \n7. Notes bearing \"PAY\"  / \"PAID\"  / \"REJECT\" stamps \n(a) Every Officer- in-charge of the branch i.e. the Branch Manager and every Officer -\nin-charge of the Accounts or Cash Wing of the Branch shall act as 'Prescribed \nOfficer' in each branch to adjudicate the notes received at the branch for exchange in accordance with Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009. After  \n \n5 \n adjudicating mutilated notes, the Prescribed Officer is required to record his order by \nsubscribing his initials to the dated 'PAY'/ 'PAID'/ 'REJECT' stamp. The 'PAY' /'PAID' & 'REJECT' stamps should also carry the name of the bank and branch concerned \nand held under the custody of the 'Prescribed Officer' to avoid misuse.  \n(b) Mutilated / defective notes bearing 'PAY'/'PAID' (or 'REJECT') stamp of any RBI \nIssue Office or any bank branch, if presented for payment again at any of the bank \nbranches should be rejected under Rule 6(2) of Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009 and the tenderer should be advised that the value of such note/s cannot be paid since the same has already been paid as is evident from the PAY/PAID \nstamps affixed on it/them. All bank branches have instructions not to issue notes bearing PAY/PAID stamps to the public even through oversight. The branches should caution their customers not to accept such notes from any bank or anybody \nelse.  \n8. Notes bearing slogans / political  messages, etc.  \nAny note with slogans and message of a political  nature written across it ceases to \nbe a legal tender and the claim on such a note will be rejected under Rule 6(3) (iii) of \nReserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009. Similarly, notes which are disfigured may also be rejected under Rule 6(3) (ii) of \nReserve Bank of India (Note \nRefund) Rules, 2009 . \n9. Deliberately cut notes \nThe notes, which are found to be deliberately cut, torn, altered or tampered with, if \npresented for payment of exchange value should be rejected under Rule 6(3)(ii) of the Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009. Although it is not possible to precisely define deliberately cut notes, a close look at such notes will clearly reveal any deliberate fraudulent intention, as the manner in which such notes are mutilated will follow a broad uniformity in the shape/location of missing portions of the notes, especially when the notes are tendered in large numbers. The details of the case such as the name of the tenderer, the number of notes tendered and their denominations should be reported thereafter to the Deputy/General Manager, Issue Department, under whose jurisdiction the branch falls. The matter should also be \nreported to local police in case a large number of such notes are tendered.  \n10. Training \nOur Issue Offices conduct training programmes for 'Prescribed Officers' of bank \nbranches on a priority basis. As the training programmes are intended to provide knowledge and instill confidence in the Prescribed Off icers in the process of \nadjudication of defective notes, it is imperative that the Prescribed Officers of the \nbranches are deputed for such programmes.   \n11. Display of Notice Board  \nAll bank branches are required to display at their branch premises, at a prominent \nplace, a board indicating the availability of note and coin exchange facility with the \nlegend, \"SOILED/MUTILATED NOTES  AND COINS ARE ACCEPTED AND  \n \n6 \n EXCHANGED HERE\" for information of general public. Banks should ensure that all \ntheir branches provid e facility for exchange of notes and coins not only to their \ncustomers but also others. However, they should ensure that the note exchange \nfacility is not cornered by money changers / dealers in defective notes.  \n \n12. Disposal of notes adjudicated at bank branches  \nRegarding audit of the notes adjudicated by bank branches, the full value paid notes \nhave to be remitted by all branches to the chest branches with which they have been linked and therefrom to the Issue Offices concerned together with the next soi led \nnote remittance in the manner already laid down. The half value paid notes and \nrejected notes, which are held by the chest branches in their cash balance, may \neither be remitted separately packed together  with the full value paid notes or sent \nby regis tered and insured post as and when required. The full value paid notes will \nbe treated as chest remittance by the Issue Office while the half value paid notes \nand rejected notes will be treated as notes tendered for adjudication and processed accordingly. All chest  branches are required to submit to our Issue Offices a monthly \nstatement showing the number of notes adjudicated during the month.  \n13. Uncurrent Coins \nThe coins of 25 paise  and below, issued from time to time, ceased to be legal tender \nfor payments as well as account with effect from June 30, 2011 in terms of Gazette \nNotification No. 2529 dated December 20, 2010 issued by the Government of India.  \n14. Monitoring and Control  \n(a) The Regional Managers / Zonal Managers of the banks may pay surprise visits to \nthe branches and report the position of compliance in this regard to the Head Office \nwhich will review such reports and take prompt remedial action, wherever necessary.  \n(b) Any non- compliance in this regard shall be viewed as violation of instructions \nissued by the Reserve Bank of India.  \n \n   \n \n7 \n Master Circular \u2013  Facility for Exchange of Notes and Coins dated July 01, 2019 \nList of circulars / notifications consolidated by the Master Circular  \nSr.No  Circular / Notification No.  Date  Subject  \n1.

The Reserve Bank maintains the directory of all BOs/offices in India, [known as the \n\u201cMaster Office File\u201d (MOF) system], which is updated based on Proforma-I and Proforma-II, \nsubmitted by banks through email. The system allots Basic Statistical Return (BSR) code / \nAuthorised Dealer (AD) code to BOs/offices .  \n3.  Consistent with the needs of branch licencing and financial inclusion policies as well as \nthe need for requisite coverage of additional dimensions/features, a new reporting system, \nviz., Central Information System for Banking Infrastructure (CISBI) ( https://cisbi.rbi.org.in ), \nhas been web-deployed to replace the legacy MOF system.  \n4.  Under the new system, all entities are required to submit their information in one proforma \n(Annex -I), unlike the earlier system of collecting Proforma- I & Proforma-II separately. The \ninstructions for submission of new Proforma, online are given in Annex -II. All the past \ninformation reported by banks have been migrated to CISBI and additional information \nshould be reported in CISBI henceforth. The CISBI portal also contains the relev ant circulars, \nuser manuals and other relevant documents to facilitate the reporting.  \n5.  CISBI has provision to maintain complete details of banks  and AIFIs  (e.g., bank category, \nbank -group, bank code, type of license issued, various contact details of offices/senior 2 \n officials, Lead-bank Districts) and history of all the changes with time stamp. Banks /AIFIs  \nshall submit a monthly report through CISBI that their information in CISBI is correct and \nupdated; they can also use the facility to access/download the data relating to their \nbank /AIFI.  \n6.  The Reserve Bank has provided login credentials to nodal offices of banks /AIFIs  for \nsubmitting their information in CISBI. Other institutions requiring BSR/AD  code can seek \naccess to CISBI by making email  request. Banks as well as AIFIs   should submit the \ninformation as per the guidelines given in the Annex -III and thereafter  bank/BO/Offices/  Non-\nAdministratively Independent Office ( NAIO )/ other fixed C ustomer Service Points (CSPs) i.e. \nother than BOs like ATMs, Cash Deposit Machines, Other Customer Services , etc.,  code \nwould be allotted by CISBI after due validations. This is also applicable to public sector \nbanks who were allotting BSR -Part -1 code at their level so far. The BSR code for the new \nBOs, offices etc. would be allotted as alpha-numeric codes (instead of numeric codes as \nhitherto) to accommodate the increasing number of outlets. In case of status change, banks \nneed to edit only the relevant part.   \n7.  All banks/AIFIs should submit immediately  and in any  case not later than one week , the \ninformation relating to opening, closure, merger, shifting and conversion of \nBOs/Offices/ATMs/NAIO, etc. online through CISBI portal to DSIM, Banking Statistics \nDivision, RBI, Central Office, C -8/9, Bandra-Kurla Complex, Mumbai -400051.

Since then, there has not only been an expansion in volume and value of government receipts \nand payme nts, and coverage of bank branches handling government transactions, but also \nsignificant movements towards adoption of technology and migration to electronic means of payments. These changes have necessitated a review of the costs incurred by the banks in \nhandling government business, which has been carried out by a Committee set up for this \npurpose.  \n \n3. Accordingly, the agency commission rates on eligible government transactions  to be carried \nout with effect from July 01, 2019 shall be as under: \nSr. \nNo. Type of Transaction  Unit Existing \nRates  Revised \nRates  \n1  Receipts - Physical  per transaction  \u20b9 50/- \u20b9 40/- \n2  Receipts \u2013 e-mode  per transaction  \u20b9 12/- \u20b9 9/- \n3  Pension Payments  per transaction  \u20b9 65/- \u20b9 75/- \n4  Payments other than Pension  Per \u20b9 100 t urnover  \u20b9 5.5 paise  \u20b9 6.5 paise  \n \n4.

A review of this claim process has been done internally after observing significant delays and \ndiscrepancies in the claims submission by agency banks . Based on this review and also taking \ninto consideration the references received from agency banks in this regard, it has been decided \nto replace the current process of centralised claims submission with a system whereby applicable \nGST (18% at present) shall be paid along with agency commission by the respective Regional \nOffices of RBI / CAS, Nagpur as the case may be.  \n \n6. For eligible governm ent transactions done with effect from July 01, 2019, agency  banks shall \nsubmit the agency commission claims , including applicable GST amount, as per revised agency \ncommission rates indicated above,  to RBI at respective ROs / CAS, Nagpur as per the extant \ninstructions  issued by RBI in this regard.  TDS on GST shall be deducted as applicable by RBI at \nthe time of making agency commission payment. \n \n7. However, for eligible government transactions done by agency banks upto June 30, 2019, \nagency banks shall continue to submit agency commission claims as well as the claims for ST/GST reimbursement as hitherto.  \n \n8.

The platform, FX -\nRetail, is ready for rollout  by the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) on \nAugust 05, 2019.  \n2. The issue of transpar ent and fair pricing for retail users (individuals and Micro, \nSmall and Medium Enterprises) in the foreign exchange market has been raised in \nvarious fora and in public interactions.  Such a mechanism will provide transparency \nwhile enhancing competition an d lead to better pricing for retail customers. Banks \nmay charge their retail customers a pre- agreed flat fee towards administrative \nexpenses, which should be publicly declared. Overall, this would  bring down the total \ncost faced by the retail customer in the foreign exchange market. Facilitating direct access of retail customers to the market, rather than through price- setting by their \nbanks, would also bring down the risk that banks face in warehousing transactions . \n3.The FX-Retail platform can be accessed by any customer of a bank  (through the \nwebsite https://www.fxretail.co.in ) who has a need to purchase or sell US Dollar \nagainst the Rupee for delivery on cash  basis (same day) , tom basis (next day)  or \nspot basis  (two days after date of transaction) , subject to the following:  \ni. There is no cap on the number of transactions  per customer  during a day. \nThe total amount of transactions of a customer shall be subject to the limit \nassigned by its bank.  \nii. The size of a single transaction is not allowed to exceed $5  million.  \niii. As a further facility for retail clients, no transaction charges shall  be levied by \nthe CCIL on transactions of customers if such  transactions  do not exceed \nUSD 50,000 per day.   \niv. A transaction charge of 0.0004% shall be charged by the CCIL for  \ntransactions in excess of USD 50,000 per day.  \n4. Fees charged by banks , if any,  shall be indicated on the FX -Retail platform.  Banks \nmay recover  from customers  transaction and settlement charges  levied by the CCIL .   \n5. In view of the advantages of transparency and pricing to retail  customers, as well \nas the systemic advantage of improved price discovery, banks shall facilitate on-\nboarding of  retail customers to the platform expeditiously. A quarterly return shall be \nsubmitted by all banks on the distribution of customer  transactions (across FX-Retail , \nother electronic trading platforms and other channels ) and the fees charged by them \nas per the format given in the annexure .  \n6. Detailed guidelines regarding the operation of the platform, including the process \nof customer registration, shall be issued by the CCIL . Customers can obtain further \ndetails about the platform on the CCIL website (https://www.ccilindia.com ) \n7. The customer registration process on the platform shall commence on July 01, \n2019 and the platform shall be avai lable for transactions from August 05, 2019.  \n8.

P2F has \nbeen discontinued for CG cheques with effect from February 2016. Taking this initiative forward, it has now been decided in consultation with the O ffice of the \nComp troller & Auditor General of India (C&AG ), Government of India, to dispense \nwith the current requirement of forwarding  the paid State  Government cheques in \nphysical form  (commonly known as P2F)  to the State Government \ndepartments /treasuries .  \n 2. Accordingly, it has been decided to modify the \u201cMemorandum of  Instructions  on \nAccounting and Reconciliation \u2013  State Government transactions  (February 2003) \u201d as \nunder:  \n \na) This circular may be treated as an addendum to the instructions and inserted \nas para 5.16 of the Memorandum of I nstructions  titled \u201cProcedure to be \nfollowed by Agency Bank branches for discontinuing P2F for cheque based payments of State Governments\u201d.  2 \n \n \nb) In Cheque Truncation System, the \u2018drawee bank \u2019 means the dealing branch of \na bank accredited to a Minist ry/ Department /Treasury/Sub- Treasury  on which \nthe cheques are drawn. The \u2018 presenting bank \u2019 means a branch of any bank \nwhere the cheques are presented for payment by the clients. Both the \npresenting banks and drawee banks would continue to discharge their duties  \nprescribed under various Acts/Regulations /Rules such as the Negotiable \nInstruments Act  1881, Bankers\u2019 Books Evidence Act 1891, Uniform \nRegulations and Rules for Bankers\u2019 Clearing Houses , Procedural Guidelines \nfor Cheque Truncation System  etc. with respect to payment of cheques.  The \ngovernment cheques would henceforth be paid in CTS clearing solely based \non their  electronic images.  The paid cheques in physical form would be \nretained by the presenting bank.  \n \nc) In case any drawee bank desires to verify the g overnment cheque in physical \nform before pas sing it for payment, the image would be returned unpaid \nunder the reason \u201cpresent with document\u201d. The presenting bank on such \ninstances shall ensure that the instrument is  presented again in the next \napplicable clearing session without any reference to the account holder  \n(payee) . \n \nd) The presenting banks are required to preserve the physical instruments  in \ntheir custody  securely for a period of 10 years as required under Procedural \nGuidelines for CTS.   In case some specific cheques  are required for the \npurpose of any investigation, enquiry, etc. , under the law, they may  be \npreserved beyond 10 years. Drawee banks shall make necessary arrangements to preserve the images of all government cheques for a period of 10 years with themselves or through the National Arc hival System put in \nplace by N ational Payments Corporation of I ndia (NPCI) . \n \ne) The government cheques paid by a drawee bank across its counter by way of \ncash withdrawal or transfer also need to be truncated and preserved for 10 3 \n \nyears. Adequate safeguards sha ll be built to ensure that these images are \ncaptured separately by the drawee banks and not mixed up with the images \nof the instruments received for payment  in clearing.  A common electronic file \ncontaining the images of all the paid cheques shall be creat ed on a daily  \nbasis for onward transmission to State G overnment \nDepartments/Treasuries/Sub- Treasuries .  \n \nf) As prescribed in para 5.1 of the Memorandum of Instructions, t he branch \nhandling the State Government transactions shall continue to send the \nPayment S crolls on a daily basis in the prescribed form to the Sub -\nTreasury/Treasury to whom they are attached as hitherto.  However, a s the \npaid cheques would no longer be available with the accredited branch, the \nsame will not be attached with the payment scroll , but the electronic  images \nof paid cheques (by way of  cash, clearing and transfer) , preserved by the \npresenting bank , shall be provided to the Office of AG/State Government \nDepartments/Treasuries/Sub- Treasuries  by way of secured electronic  \ncommunication/ e- mail, etc., as per their requirement.  \n \ng) At any time during the preservation period of cheques, for the purpose of \nreconciliation,  enquiry, investigation, etc., the Office of AG/State Government \nDepartments/Treasuries/Sub- Treasuries may require any paid cheque in \nphysical  form for which the concerned State Government \nDepartment/Treasury/Sub- Treasury  would approach the dealing branch . \nWhenever so demanded,  the dealing branch shall arrange to furnish the \ncheques paid by it by way of  cash and t ransfer immediately. In case of \ncheques paid by way of clearing, the same  shall be supplied to the Office of \nAG/State Government Departments/Treasuries/Sub- Treasuries  within a \nreasonable period after obtaining it from the presenting bank. It is the \nresponsibility of the pr esenting bank in  such instances to comply with the  \nrequest  of the Office of AG/State Government Departments/Treasuries/Sub -\nTreasuries  / drawee bank  for any physical cheque and provide the same to \nthe respective drawee bank within a reasonable period.    4 \n \n \nh) At present, the CTS is operated on grid basis. Hence, the government \ncheques drawn on RBI / agency banks shall be presented in the grid within \nwhose jurisdiction the accredited/authorised branch of paying bank is located.  \n \ni) As hitherto, the drawee bank  shall ensure through the dealing branch that the \nmistakes/ discrepancies  pointed out in payment scrolls, monthly DMS etc are \nrectified as per procedure, missing images of paid cheques are submitted \nimmediately, the copies of the scrolls duly verified by the Sub -\nTreasury/Treasury  are kept on its  record, etc.  \n \n3. The revised guidelines would be effective in respect of cheques issued by  the \nState Governments  from July 01, 2019 and made applicable for those State \nGovernments which give their consent for withdrawal of P2F arrangement. As and \nwhen State Governments give their consent, the same will be advised to the banks . \nIn case any SG desires to have a parallel run, the same may be done for a period not exceeding three months.

These directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets) Directions 2019.  \n \n2. These directions shall come into force with immediate effect .  \nApplicability  \n3. The provisions of these d irections shall apply to the following entities:   \n(a) Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding R egional Rural Banks ); \n(b) All India Term Financial Institutions (NABARD, NHB, EXIM Bank, and SIDBI) ; \n(c) Small Finance Banks ; and,  \n(d) Systemically Important Non- Deposit taking Non- Banking Financial \nCompanies  (NBFC- ND-SI) and Deposit taking Non -Banking Financial \nCompanies  (NBFC- D). \n \n 2 \n \n \n Purpose  \n4. These directions are issued with a view to providing a framework for early \nrecognition, reporting and time bound resolution of stressed assets . \n \n5. These directions are issued without prejudice to issuance of specific directions, from time to time, by the Reserve Bank to banks , in terms of the provisions of \nSection 35AA of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, for initiation of insolvency \nproceedings against specific borrowers  under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy \nCode, 2016 (IBC).  \n \nI. Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets \nA. Early identification and  reporting of stress  \n \n6. Lenders1 shall recognise incipient stress in loan accounts , immediately  on \ndefault2, by classifying such  assets as special mention accounts (SMA) as per \nthe following categories:  \nSMA Sub -categories  Basis for classification  \u2013 \n Principal or interest payment or any other \namount wholly or partly overdue between  \nSMA -0 1-30 days  \nSMA -1 31-60 days  \nSMA -2 61-90  days \n \n7. In the case of revolving credit facili ties like cash credit , the SMA sub -categories  \nwill be as follows:  \nSMA Sub -categories  Basis for classification \u2013 \nOutstanding balance remains continuously in \nexcess of the sanctioned limit or drawing \npower , whichever is lower,  for a period of:  \n  \nSMA -1 31-60 days  \nSMA -2 61-90 days  \n                                                 \n1 For the purpose of these directions, \u2018lenders\u2019 shall mean all entities mentioned at paragraph 3, \nunless specified otherwise.  \n2 \u2018Default\u2019 means non- payment of debt (as defined under the IBC) when whole or any part or \ninstalment of the debt  has become due and payable and is not paid by the debtor or the corporate \ndebtor, as the case may be.  \nFor revolving faci lities like cash credit, default would also mean, without prejudice to the \nabove, the outstanding balance remaining continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit or drawing \npower, whichever is lower, for more than 30 days.  3 \n \n \n  \n8. As provided in terms of the circular3 DBS.OSMOS. No.14703/33.01.001/2013 -14 \ndated May 22, 2014  and subsequent amendments thereto, l enders shall report \ncredit information, including classification of an account as SMA to Central \nRepository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) , on all borrower s having \naggregate exposure4 of ` 50 million and above with them. The CRILC- Main \nReport shall be submitted  on a monthly  basis . In addition, the lenders shall \nsubmit a weekly report  of instances of default by all borrower s (with aggregate \nexposure of ` 50 million and above)  by close of business  on every  Friday, or the \npreceding working day if Friday happens to be a holi day.  \n \nB. Implementation of Resolution Plan \n \n9. All lenders  must put in place Board- approved policies for resolution of stressed \nassets , including the timelines  for resolution . Since default with any lender is a \nlagging indicator of financial stress faced by the borrower, it is expected that the lenders initiate  the process of implementing a resolution plan ( RP) even before a \ndefault. In any case, o nce a borrower is reported to be in default by any of the \nlenders  mentioned at 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) , lenders  shall undertake a prima facie  \nreview of the borrower account within thirty days from such default  (\u201cReview \nPeriod\u201d).  During this Review Period  of thirty days, lenders may decide on the \nresolution strategy, including the nature of the RP, the approach for \nimplementation of the RP , etc. The lenders may also choose to initiate legal \nproceedings for insolvency or recovery.  \n \n10. In cases where RP is to be implemented, all lenders  shall enter into an inter -\ncreditor agreement (ICA) , during the above- said Review Period, to provide for \nground rules for finalisation and implementation of the RP in respect of borrowers \nwith credit facilities from more than one lender .\n5 The IC A shall provide that any \ndecision agreed by lenders representing 75 per  cent by value of total outstanding \n                                                 \n3 In these directions, wherever a reference is made to the circulars addressed to banks, other lenders \nindicated at paragraph 3 should refer to corresponding circulars applicable to them, if any.  \n4 Aggregate exposure under the guidelines would include all fund based and non- fund based \nexposure, including investment ex posure with the lenders.  \n5 In cases where asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) have exposure to the borrower concerned, \nthey shall also sign the ICA and adhere to all its provisions.  4 \n \n \n credit facilities (fund based as well non- fund based) and 60 per cent of lenders by \nnumber shall be binding upon all the lenders . Additionally, t he ICA may, inter alia , \nprovide for rights and duties of majority lenders, duties and protection of rights of \ndissenting lenders, treatment of lenders with priority in cash flows/differential \nsecurity interest, etc. In particular, the RPs  shall provide for payment not less \nthan the liquidation value6 due to the dissenting lenders.  \n \n11. In respect  of accounts  with aggregat e exposure above a threshold  with the \nlenders, as indicated below, on or after the \u2018reference date\u2019, RP shall be \nimplemented within 180 days from the end of Review Period . The Review Period \nshall commence not later than:  \n \n(a) The reference date, i f in default as  on the reference date; or  \n(b) The date of first  default  after the reference date.  \n \n12. The reference dates for the above purpose shall be as under :   \nAggregate exposure of the \nborrower to lenders mentioned at \n3(a), 3(b) and 3( c) Reference date   \n` 20 billion and above  Date of these Directions   \n` 15 billion and above, but less than ` \n20 billion  January 1, 2020  \nLess than ` 15 billion  To be announced in due course   \n \n13. The RP may involve any action / plan / reorganization including,  but not limited to, \nregularisation of the account by payment of all over dues by the borrower entity, \nsale of the exposures to other entities  / investors , change in ownership and \nrestructuring7.The RP shall  be clearly documented by the lenders concerned \n(even if  there is no change in any terms and conditions ).  \n \n                                                 \n6 Liquidation value would mean the estim ated realisable value of the assets of the relevant borrower , if \nsuch borrower were to be liquidated as on the date of commencement of the Review Period.  \n7 Restructuring is an act in which a lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's \nfinancial difficulty, grants concessions to the borrower. Restructuring would normally involve \nmodification of terms of the advances / securities, which would generally include, among others, \nalteration of payment period / payable amount / the amount of instalments / rate of interest; roll over of credit facilities; sanction of additional credit facility/ release of additional funds for an account in default to aid curing of default  / enhancement of ex isting credit limits; compromise settlements where \ntime for payment of settlement amount exceeds three months.  \n 5 \n \n \n C. Implementation Conditions for RP  \n \n14.  RPs involving restructuring / change in ownership in respect of accounts where \nthe aggregate exposure of lenders is ` 1 billion and above, shall require \nindependent credit evaluation (ICE) of  the residual debt8 by credit rating agencies \n(CRAs) specifically authorised by the Reserve Bank for this purpose. While \naccounts with aggregate exposure of ` 5 billion and above shall require two such \nICEs, others shall require one ICE. Only such RPs whic h receive a credit opinion \nof RP49 or better for the residual debt from one or two CRAs, as the case may \nbe, shall be considered for implementation . Further, ICEs shall be subject to the \nfollowing:  \n \n(a) The CRAs shall be directly engaged by the lenders and the payment of \nfee for such assignments shall be made by the lenders.  \n(b) If lenders obtain ICE from more than the required number of CRAs, all \nsuch ICE opinions shall be RP4 or better for the RP to be considered for implementation.  \n \n15. A RP in respect  of borrower s to whom the lenders continue to have credit \nexposure, shall be deemed to be \u2018implemented\u2019 only if the following conditions are met : \n(a) A RP which does not involve restructuring/change in ownership shall be \ndeemed to be implemented only if the borrower is not  in default with \nany of the lenders  as on 180\nth day from the end of the Review Period . \nAny subsequent default after the 180 day period shall be treated as a fresh default, triggering a fresh review.  \n(b) A RP which  involves restructuring/change in ownership shall be \ndeemed to be implemented only if all of the following conditions are \nmet: \ni. all related documentation, including execution of necessary \nagreements between lenders and borrower  / creation of security \n                                                 \n8 The residual debt of the borrower entity, in this context, means the aggregate debt (fund based as  \nwell as non -fund based) envisaged to be held by all the lenders as per the proposed RP.  \n \n9 Annex \u2013 2 provides list of RP symbols that can be provided by CRAs as ICE and their meanings.  6 \n \n \n charge / perfection of securities , are completed by the lenders  \nconcerned in consonance with the RP being implemented;  \nii. the new capital structure and/or  changes in the terms of \nconditions of the existing loans get duly reflected in the books of \nall the lenders and the borrower ; and, \niii. borrower is not in default with any of the lenders.  \n \n16. A RP which  involves lenders exiting the exposure by assigning the exposures to \nthird party or a RP involving recovery action shall be deemed to be implemented  \nonly if the exposure to the borrower is fully extinguished.  \n \nD. Delayed Implementation of Resolution Plan  \n \n17. Where a viable RP in respect of a borrower is not implemented within the \ntimelines g iven below , all lenders  shall make additional provisions as under : \nTimeline for implementation of \nviable RP  Additional provisions to be made as a % of total \noutstanding, if RP not implemented within the \ntimeline  \n180 days from the end of Review \nPeriod  20% \n365 days from the \ncommencement of Review \nPeriod  15% (i.e. total additional provisioning of 35%)  \n \n18.  The additional  provisions shall be made over and above the higher of  the \nfollowing, subject to the total provisions held being capped at 100% of total \noutstanding:  \n(a) The provisions already held; or,  \n(b) The provisions required to be made as per the asset classification \nstatus of the borrower account . \n \n19. The additional provisions shall be made by all  the lenders with exposure to such \nborrower .  \n \n20. The additional provisions  shall also be required to be made in cases where the \nlenders  have initiated recovery proceedings , unless the recovery proceedings are \nfully completed.  \n \n 7 \n \n \n 21. The above additional provisions may be reversed as under:  \n \n(a) Where the RP involves only payment of overdues  by the borrower \u2013  the \nadditional provisions may be reversed only if the borrower is n ot in \ndefault for a period of 6 months from the date of clearing of the \noverdues with all the lenders ; \n(b) Where RP involves restructuring/change in ownership outside IBC  \u2013 the \nadditional provisions may be reversed upon implementation of the RP ; \n(c) Where resolution is pursued under IBC \u2013  half of the additional \nprovisions made may be reversed on filing of insolvency application \nand the remaining additional provisions may be reversed upon admission of the borrower into the insolvency resolution process under \nIBC; or,  \n(d) Where assignment of debt/ recovery proceedings are initiated \u2013  the \nadditional provisions may be reversed upon completion of the \nassignment  of debt /recovery.   \n \nE. Prudential Norms  \n \n22. The prudential norms applicable to any restructuring/change in ownership, whether under the IBC framework or outside the IBC, are contained in \nAnnex -\n110.  \n \nII. Supervisory Review  \n23. Any action by lenders with an intent to conceal the actual status of accounts or evergreen the stressed accounts, will be subjected to stringent supervisory  / \nenforcement actions as deemed appropriate by the Reserve Bank, including , but \nnot limited to,  higher provisioning on such accounts  and monetary penalties\n11.  \n \nIII. Disclosures \n24. Lenders  shall make appropriate disclosures in their financial statements , under \n\u2018Notes on Accounts \u2019, relating to RPs implemented.  \n                                                 \n10 During the period when the RP is being finalised and implemented, the usual asset classification \nnorms would continue to apply subject to additional provisioning requirements of this circular. The \nprocess of re -classification of an asset should not stop m erely because RP is under consideration.  \n11 This may be in addition to direction to bank/s to file insolvency application under the IBC. 8 \n \n \n  \n \nIV. Exceptions  \n25. Restructuring in respect of projects under implementation involving deferment of \ndate of commencement  of commercial operations (DCCO), shall continue to be \ncovered under the guidelines contained at paragraph 4.2.15 of the Master \nCircular No. DBR.No.BP.BC.2/21.04.048/2015- 16 dated July 1, 2015  on \n\u2018Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning \npertaining to Advances \u2019.  \n \n26. Section I(B), I(C) and I(D) of the framework shall not be applicable to revival  and \nrehabilitation of MSMEs covered by the instructions  contained in Circular No. \nFIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.21/ 06.02.31/ 2015- 16 dated March 17, 2016 , as \namended from time to tim e. Section I(E) of the framework shall not be in \nderogation to the provisions of the circular DBR.No.BP.BC.18/21.04.048/ 2018-\n19 dated January 1, 2019 .  \n \n27. Restructuring of loans  in the event of a natural calamity, including asset \nclassification and provisioning, shall continue to be guided as per the extant \ninstructions.  \n \n28. The framework shall not be available for borrower entities in respect of which specific instructions have already  been issued or are issued by the Reserve Bank \nto the banks for initiation of insolvency proceedings under  the IBC. Lenders shall \npursue such cases as per the specific instructions issued to them.  \n \nV. Withdrawal of extant instructions \n29. The extant instructions on resolution of stressed assets such as Framework for Revitalising Distressed  Assets, Corporate Debt Restructuring Scheme, Flexible \nStructuring of Existing Long Term Project Loans, Strategic Debt Restructuring \nScheme (SDR), C hange in Ownership outside SDR, and Scheme for Sustainable \nStructuring of Stressed Assets (S4A)  stand withdrawn with immediate effect . \nAccordingly, t he Joint Lenders\u2019 Forum (JLF) as mandatory institutional \nmechanism for resolution of stressed accounts also stands discontinued.  9 \n \n \n  \n30. The list of circulars /directions /guidelines that stand repealed is given in Annex  - \n3. \n \n31. The lenders shall not reverse the provisions maintained as on April 2, 2019 in \nrespect of any borrower  unless the reversal is a consequence of an asset \nclassification upgrade or recovery or resolution following the instructions of this \ncircular . Any RP under consideration as on the date of this circular  may be \npursued by lenders under this revised framework  subject to meeting the \nrequirements/conditions specified in this framework .  \n \nYours faithfully,  \n \n \n(Saurav Sinha)  \nChief General Manager -in-Charge  10 \n \n \n Annex \u2013 1 \nPrudential Norms Applicable to Restructuring  \n1. Restructuring is an act in which a lender, for economic or legal reasons relating \nto the borrower's financial difficulty, grants concessions to the borrower. Restructuring may involve modification of terms of the advances / securities, which would generally include, among others, alteration of payment period / payable a mount / the amount of instalments / rate of interest; roll over of credit \nfacilities; sanction of additional credit facility/ release of additional funds for an \naccount in default to aid curing of default / enhancement of existing credit limits; \ncompromise settlements where time for payment of settlement amount exceeds \nthree months.  \n  \n2. For this purpose, the board- approved policies of lenders on resolution of \nstressed assets, required to be in place in terms of the this f ramework, shall also \nhave detailed policies on various signs of financial difficulty, providing \nquantitative as well as qualitative parameters, for determining financial difficulty as expected from a prudent bank. In order to enable lenders  to frame respective \npolicies for determination of financial difficultly , a non-exhaustive i ndicative list of \nsigns of financial difficulty  are provided as under\n12: \n \n(a) A default,  as per the definition  provided  in the framework,  shall be \ntreated as an indicator  for financial  difficulty,  irrespective of reasons  for \nthe default . \n(b) A borrower  not in default,  but it is probable  that the borrower  will default  \non any of its exposures  in the foreseeable future  without  the \nconcession,  for instance,  when there has been a pattern of delinquency  \nin payments  on its exposures . \n(c) A borrower\u2019s  outstanding securities  have  been delisted,  are in the \nprocess  of being delisted,  or are under  threat  of being delisted from an \n                                                 \n12 Based on the Basel Committee Guidelines on \u201cPrudential treatment of problem assets \u2013 definitions \nof non- performing exposures and forbearance\u201d.  11 \n \n \n exchange due to noncompliance with the listing  requirements  or for \nfinancial  reasons . \n(d) On the basis  of actual  performance,  estimates  and projections  that \nencompass  the borrower\u2019s  current  level of operations,  the borrower\u2019s  \ncash  flows  are assessed  to be insufficient  to service  all of its loans  or \ndebt securities  (both  interest  and principal)  in accordance with the \ncontr actual  terms  of the existing agreement  for the foreseeable future . \n(e) A borrower\u2019s  credit  facilities  are in non-performing status  or would be \ncategorised as nonperforming without  the concessions . \n(f) A borrower\u2019s  existing  exposures  are categorised as exposures  that \nhave already  evidenced difficulty  in the borrower\u2019s  ability  to repay  in \naccordance with the bank\u2019s  internal  credit  rating system . \n \n3. The above list provides examples of possible indicators of financial difficulty, but \nis not intended to constitute an exhaustive enumeration of financial difficulty indicators with respect to restructuring. Lenders  shall need to complement the \nabove with k ey financial ratios and operational parameters which may include \nquantitative and qualitative aspects. In particular, financial difficulty can be \nidentified even in the absence of arrears on an exposure. The robustness of the board approved policy and the outcomes would be examined as part of the \nsupervisory oversight of the Reserve Bank.  \n \nI. Prudential Norms\n13  \n \nA. Asset Classification  \n4. In case of restructuring, the accounts classified as 'standard' shall be immediately downgraded as non- performing assets (NPAs), i.e., \u2018sub -standard\u2019 \nto begin with. The NPAs , upon restructuring, would continue to have the same \nasset classification as prior  to restructuring. In both cases, the asset \nclassification shall continue to be governed by the ageing criteria as per extant asset classification norms .  \n \n                                                 \n13 Applicable to all resolution plans, including those undertaken under IBC.  12 \n \n \n  \n \n \nB. Conditions for Upgrade \n5. Standard accounts classified as NPA and NPA accounts retained in the same category on restructuring by the lenders may be upgraded only when all the outstanding loan / facilities  in the account demonstrate \u2018satisfactory \nperformance\u2019\n14 during the period from  the date of implementation of RP up to the \ndate by which at least 10 per cent of the sum of outstanding principal debt15 as \nper the RP and interest capitalisation sanctioned as part of the restructuring, if \nany, is repaid (\u2018monitoring period\u2019 ). \nProvided that the account cannot be upgraded before one year from \nthe commencement of the first payment of interest or principal \n(whichever is later) on the credit facility with longest period of moratorium under the terms of RP.  \n \n6. Additionally, for accounts where the aggregate exposure of lenders is ` 1 billion \nand above at the time of implementation of RP, to qualify for an upgrade, in addition to demonstration of satisfactory performance, the credit facilities of the borrower shall also be rated as investment grade\n16 (BBB-  or better), at the time \nof upgrade, by CRAs accredited by the Reserve Bank for the purpose of bank \nloan ratings. While accounts with aggregate exposure of ` 5 billion and above \nshall require two ratings, those below ` 5 billion shall require one rating. If the \nratings are obtained from more than the required number of CRAs, all such \nratings shall be investment grade for the account to qualify for an upgrade.  \n \n7. If the borro wer fails to demonstrate satisfactory performance during the \nmonitoring period, asset classification upgrade shall be subject to \n                                                 \n14 Satisfactory performance means that the borrower  entity is not in default at any point of time during \nthe period concerned.   \n15 Outstanding principal debt shall include all credit facilities, including debt/debt like instruments (viz., \nnon-convertible debentures, optionally convertible debentures, optionally convertible preference \nshares, non -convertible preference shares etc.) that exist post implementation of the RP. Only equity \nand instruments compulsorily convertible into equity (without any embedded optionality) shall be \nexempt from determining outstanding principal debt.  \n16 These ratings shall be the normal ratings provided by the CRAs and not ICEs referred to in \nparagraph 14 of the covering circular.  13 \n \n \n implementation of a fresh restructuring / change in ownership under this \nFramework or under IBC . Lenders shall make an additional provision of 15% for \nsuch accounts at the end of the Review Period. This additional provision, along \nwith other additional provisions, may be reversed as per the norms laid down at paragraph 21  of the covering circular.   \n \n8. Provisions held on restructured assets may be reversed when the accounts are \nupgraded to standard category.  \n \n9. Any default by the borrower in any of the credit facilities with any of the lenders \n(including any lender  where the borrower is not in \u201c specified period\u201d ) \nsubsequent to upgrade in asset classification as above  but before the end of the \nspecified period, will require a fresh RP to be implemented within the above \ntimelines  as any default would entail . However, lenders shall make an additional \nprovision of 15% for such accounts at the end of the Review Period. This additional provision, along with other additional provisions, may be reversed as per the norms laid down at paragraph 21  of the covering circular.  \n\u201cSpecified period\u201d  means the period from the date of implementation of \nRP\n17 up to the date by which at least 20 per cent of the sum of \noutstanding principal debt as per the RP and interest capitalisation sanctioned as part of the restructuring, if any, is repaid.  \n \nC. Provisioning  Norms\n18  \n10. Accounts  restructured under the revised framework shall attract provisioning as \nper the asset classification category as laid out in the Master Circular on \nPrudential Norms on Income  Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning \npertaining to Advances  dated July 1, 2015, as amended from time to time.  \n \n11. In respect of accounts of debtors where a final RP , as approved by the \nCommittee of Creditors, has been submitted by the Resoluti on Professional for \napproval of the Adjudicating Authority (in terms of section 30(6) of the IBC), \n                                                 \n17 For accounts restructured under IBC, the specified period shall be deemed to commence from the \ndate of implementation of the resolution plan as approved by the Adjudicating Authority  \n18 Additional provisions for delayed implementation of RP within timelines shall be as per paragraph \n17-20 of the framework  14 \n \n \n lenders  may keep the provisions held as on the  date of such submission of RP \nfrozen for a period of six months from the date of submission of the plan or up to \n90 days from the date of approval of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority in terms of section 31 (1) of the IBC , whichever is earlier.  \n \n12. The above facility of freezing the quantum of the provision shall be available only in cases where the provisioning held by the lenders  as on the date of submission \nof the plan for approval of the Adjudicating Authority is more than the expected provisioni ng required to be held in the normal course upon implementation of the \napproved resolution plan, taking into account the contours of the resolution plan approved by Committee of Creditors / Adjudicating Authority, as the case may be, \nand extant prudential norms. However, lenders shall not reverse the excess \nprovisions  held as on the date of submission of the resolution plan for approval \nof the Adjudicating Authority at this stage. In cases where the provisioning held is lower than the expected required provi sioning, lenders  shall make additional \nprovisioning to the extent of the shortfall.  Subsequent to the lapse of above \nmentioned period, provisioning shall be as per the norms co mpiled in the Master \nCircular  \u2013 Prudential Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and \nProvisioning pertaining to Advances dated July 1, 2015 (amended from time to \ntime). The facility of freezing of provisions shall also lapse immediately if the Adjudicating Authority reject s the resolution plan thus submitted. Asset \nclassification in respect of such borrower shall continue be governed by the extant asset classification norms.  \n \nD. Additional Finance  \n13. Any additional finance approved under the RP  (including any resolution plan \napproved by the Adjudicating Authority under IBC) may be treated as 'standard \nasset' during the monitoring period under the approved RP, provided the account \ndemonstrates satisfactory performance (as defined at footnote 14 ) during the \nmonitoring period. If the restructured asset fails to perform satisfactorily during \nthe monitoring period or does not qualify for upgradation at the end of the \nmonitoring period, the additional finance shall be placed in the same asset \nclassification category as the restructured debt.  \n 15 \n \n \n 14. Similarly, any interim finance [as defined in section 5 (15) of the IBC] extended \nby the lenders  to debtors undergoing insolvency proceedings under IBC may be \ntreated as \u2018standard asset\u2019 during the insolvency resolution process period as defined in the IBC. During this period, asset classification and provisioning for \nthe interim finance shall be gov erned by the Master Circular \u2013  Prudential Norms \non Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances dated July 1, 2015 (amended from time to time). Subsequently, upon \napproval of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority, treatment of such interim finance shall be as per the norms applicable to additional finance, as per paragraph 13  above.  \n \nE. Income recognition norms  \n15. Interest income in respect of restructure d accounts classified as 'standard \nassets' may be recognized on accrual basis and that in respect of the restructured accounts classified  as 'non- performing assets' shall be recognised \non cash basis.  \n \n16. In the case of additional finance in accounts where the pre- restructuring facilities \nwere classified as NPA, the interest income shall be recognised only on cash basis except when the restructuring is accompanied by a change in ownership.  \n \nF. Conversion of Principal into Debt / Equity and Unpaid Interest into \n'Funded Interest Term Loan' (FITL), Debt or Equity Instruments  \n17. An act of restructuring might create new securities issued by the borrower which would be held by the lenders  in lieu of a portion of the pre- restructured exposure.  \nThe FITL / debt / equity instruments created by conversion of principal / unpaid interest, as the case may be, shall be placed in the same asset classification \ncategory in which the restructured advance has been classified.   \n \n18. The provisioning applicable to such instruments shall be the higher of:  \n (a) The provisioning applicable to the asset classification category in which such instruments are held; or  16 \n \n \n (b) The provisioning applicable based on the fair valuation of such \ninstruments as provided in the following paragraphs.  \n \n19. Debt/quasi -debt/equity instruments19 acquired by the lenders  as part of a RP \nshall be valued as under : \n(a) Debentures/bonds shall be valued as per the instructions compiled at \nparagraph 3.7.1 of the Master Circular -  Prudential Norms for \nClassification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks \ndated July 1, 2015 (as amended from time to time).  \n(b) Conversion of debt into Zero Coupon Bonds (ZCBs)/low coupon bonds (LCBs) as part  of RP shall be subject to the conditions compiled at \nparagraph 5.4 of the Master Circular -  Prudential Norms for \nClassification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated July 1, 2015 (as amended from time to time). Such ZCBs/LCBs shall be valued as per the instructions contained at paragraph 3.7.3 of the above said Master Circular, subject to the following:  \ni. Where the borrower fails to build up the sinking fund as required \nunder the above said Master Circular, ZCBs/LCBs of such \nborrower shall be collectively valued at Re.1  \nii. Instruments without a pre- specified terminal value would be \ncollectively valued at Re. 1.  \n(c) Equity instruments, where classified as standard, shall be valued at \nmarket value, if quoted, or else, should be valued at the lowest value \narrived using the following valuation methodologies:  \ni. Book  value (without considering 'revaluation reserves', if any) \nwhich is to be ascertained from the company's latest audited \nbalance sheet. The date as on which the latest balance sheet is drawn up should not precede the date of valuation by more than \n18 months. In case the latest audited balance sheet is not available the shares are to be collectively valued at Re.1 per \ncompany.   \n                                                 \n19 These instruments shall be subject to all the instructions contained in Master Circular -  Prudential Norms for \nClassification,  Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated July 1, 2015 (as amended from \ntime to time) to the extent they are not inconsistent with the instructions contained in this circular.  17 \n \n \n ii. Discounted cash flow method where the discount factor is the \nactual interest rate charged to the borrower on the residual debt post restructuring plus a risk premium to be determined as per the board approved policy considering the factors affecting the value of the equity. The risk premium will be subject to a floor of 3 per cent and the overall discount factor will be subject to a floor of 14  per cent. Further, cash flows (cash flow available from \nthe current as well as immediately prospective (not more than six months) level of operations) occurring within 85 per cent of the useful economic life of the project only shall be reckoned.  \n(d) Equity instruments , where classified as NPA shall be valued at market \nvalue, if quoted, or else, shall be collectively valued at  Re.1.   \n(e) Preference Shares shall be valued on discounted cash flow (DCF) basis  \nas per the instructions compiled at paragraph 3.7.4 of the Master Ci rcular \n- Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of \nInvestment Portfolio by Banks dated July 1, 2015 (as amended from time to time), subject to the following modifications:  \ni. The discount rate shall be subject to a floor of weighted aver age \nactual interest rate charged to the borrower  on the residual debt \nafter restructuring  plus a mark -up of 1.5 percent .  \nii. Where preference dividends /coupons  are in arrears, no credit \nshould be taken for accrued dividends /coupons  and the value \ndetermined as above on DCF basis should be discounted further by at least 15 per cent if arrears are for one year, 25 per cent if arrears are for two years, so on and so forth (i.e., with 10 percent increments).  \n \n20. The overarching principle should be that v aluation of instruments arising out of \nresolution of stressed  assets shall be based on conservative assessment of cash \nflows and appropriate discount rates to reflect the stressed cash flows of the \nborrowers. Statutory Auditors should also specifically examine as to whether the \nvaluations of such instruments reflect the risk  of loss  associated with such \ninstruments.  \n 18 \n \n \n 21. In case lenders have acquired unquoted instruments on conversion of debt as a \npart of a RP, and if the RP is not deemed as implemented, such unquoted \ninstruments shall collectively be valued at Re. 1 at that point, and till the RP is \ntreated as implemented.  \n \n22. The unrealised income represented by FITL / Debt or equity instrument should have a corresponding credit in an account styled as \"Sundry Liabilities Account (Interest Capitalization)\".  \n \n23. The unrealised income represented by FITL / Debt or equity instrument can only be recognised in the prof it and loss account as under:  \n(a) FITL/debt instruments: only on sale or redemption, as the case may be;  \n(b) Unquoted equity/  quoted equity (where classified as NPA): only on sale;  \n(c) Quoted equity (where classified as standard): market value of the equity \nas on the date of upgradation, not exceeding the amount of unrealised \nincome converted to such equity.  Subsequent changes to value of the \nequity will be dealt as per the extant prudential norms on investment \nportfolio of banks.  \n \nG. Change in Ownership  \n24. In case of change in ownership of the borrowing entities, credit facilities of the \nconcerned borrowing entities may be continued/upgraded as \u2018standard\u2019 after the change in ownership is implemented, either under the IBC or  under this \nframework. If the change in ownership is implemented under this framework, then the classification as \u2018standard\u2019  shall be subject to the following conditions:  \n(a) Lenders  shall conduct necessary due diligence in this regard and clearly \nestablish that the acquirer is not a person disqualified in terms of Section \n29A of the IBC.  Additionally, the \u2018new promoter\u2019 should not be a \nperson/entity/subsidiary/associate etc. (domestic as well as overseas), \nfrom the existing promoter/promoter group. Lenders  should clearly \nestablish that the acquirer does not belong to the existing promoter \ngroup (as defi ned in Securities and Exchange Board  of India (Issue of \nCapital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations , 2018) . 19 \n \n \n (b) The new promoter shall have acquired at least 26 per cent of the paid up \nequity capital  as well as voting rights  of the borrower entity and shall be \nthe single largest shareholder of the borrower entity.  \n(c) The new promoter shall be in \u2018control\u2019 of the borrower entity as per the \ndefinition of \u2018control\u2019 in the Companies Act , 2013 / regulations issued by \nthe Securities and Exchange Board of India/any other applicable \nregulations  / accounting standards as the case may be.  \n(d) The conditions for implementation of RP as per Section I -C of the \ncovering circular are complied with.  \n \n25. Upon change in ownership, all the outstanding loans/credit facilities of the \nborrowing entity need to demonstrate satisfactory performance (as defined at footnote 14 ) during the monitoring period. If the account fails to perform \nsatisfactorily at any point of time during the monitoring period,  it shall trigger a \nfresh Review Period, in terms of paragraph 9 of the covering circular.  \n \n26. The quantum of provisions held (excluding additional provisions) by the bank \nagainst the said account as on the date of change in ownership of the borrowing \nentities can be reversed only after the end of monitoring period subject to \nsatisfactory performance during the same.  \n \nII. Principles on classification of sale and lease back transactions as \nrestructuring \n \n27. A sale and leaseback transaction of the assets of a borrower or other transactions of similar  nature will be treated as an event of restructuring  for the \npurpose of asset classification  and provisioning in the books of lenders  with \nregard to the residual debt of the seller as well as the debt of the buyer if all the following conditions are met:  \n(a) The seller of the assets is in financial difficulty;  \n(b) Significant portion, i.e. more than 50 per cent, of the revenues of the buyer from the specific asset is depend ent upon the cash flows from \nthe seller;  and 20 \n \n \n (c)  25 per cent or more of the loans availed by the buyer for the purchase \nof the specific asset is funded by the lenders who already have a credit \nexposure to the seller.  \n \nIII. Prudential Norms relating to Refinancing of Exposures to Borrowers  \n28.  If borrowings/export advances  (denominated in any currency, wherever \npermitted)  for the purpose of repayment/ refinancing of loans  denominated in \nsame/ another  currency  are obtained:  \n(a) From lenders who are part of Indian banking system (where permitted); \nor  \n(b) with the support (where permitted) from the Indian banking system in \nthe form of Guarantees/Standby Letters of Credit/Letters of Comfort, etc.,  \nsuch  events shall be treated as \u2018restructuring\u2019 if the borrower concerned is under \nfinancial difficulty.  \n \nIV. Regulatory Exemptions  \n \nExemptions  from RBI Regulations  \n29. Acquisition of non- SLR securities by way of conversion of debt is exempted from \nthe restrictions and the prudential limit on investment in unlisted non- SLR \nsecurities prescribed by the RBI.  \n \n30. Acquisition of shares due to conversion of debt to equity during  a restructuring \nprocess will be exempted from regulatory ceilings/restrictions on Capital Market Exposures, investment in Para -Banking activities and intra- group exposure. \nHowever, these will require reporting to RBI (reporting to DBS, CO every month along with the regular DSB Return on Asset Quality) and disclosure by banks in the Notes to Accounts in Annual Financial Statements. Nonetheless, banks will have to comply with the provisions of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  \nExemptions  from Regulations  of Securities and Exchange Board of India \n(SEBI)  21 \n \n \n 31. SEBI has provided exemptions , under certain conditions, from the requirements \nof Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Issue of Capital and \nDisclosure Requirements) (ICDR) Regulations , 2018 for restructurings carried \nout as per the regulations issued by the Reserve Bank.  \n \n32. With reference to the requirements contained in sub- regulations 158 (6) (a) of \nICDR Regulations, 2018,  the issue price of the equity shall be the  lower of ( a) or \n(b) below:  \n(a) The average of the weekly high and low of the volume weighted average \nprice of the related equity shares quoted on the recognised stock exchange during the twenty six weeks preceding the \u2018reference date\u2019 or the average of the weekly high and low of  the volume weighted average \nprices of the related equity shares quoted on a recognised stock exchange during the two weeks preceding the \u2018reference date\u2019, whichever is lower; and \n(b) Book value: Book value per share to be calculated from the latest \naudited ba lance sheet  (without considering 'revaluation reserves', if any) \nadjusted for cash flows and financials post the earlier restructuring, if \nany. The date as on which the latest balance sheet is drawn up should \nnot precede the date of restructuring by more t han 18 months. In case \nthe latest audited balance sheet is not available the shares are to be \ncollectively valued at Re.1 per company.  \n \n33. In the case of conversion of debt into equity , the \u2018reference date\u2019 shall be the \ndate on which  the bank approves  the restructuring  scheme.

Introduction  \n1.1 A bank\u2019s exposure s to its counterparties may result in concentration of its assets \nto a single counterparty or a group of connected counterparties. As a first step to \naddress the concentration risk, the Reserve Bank,  in March 1989, fixed limits on \nbank exposures to an indiv idual business concern and to business concerns of a \ngroup.  RBI\u2019s prudential  exposure norms have evolved since then and a bank\u2019s \nexposure to a single borrower and a borrower group was  restricted to 15 percent and \n40 percent of capital funds respectively . A comprehensive policy framework on the \nsubject is consolidated i n the Master Circular \u2013  Exposure Norms .  \n1.2 In January 1991, t he Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) issued \nsupervisory guidance on large exposures, viz., Measuring and Controlling Large \nCredit Exposures.  Further, the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision \n(Core Principle 19), published by BCBS in October 2006 (since revised in September 2012) prescribed that local laws and bank regulations set prudent limits on large expo sures to a single borrower or a closely related group of borrowers.  In order to \nfoster a convergence among widely divergent national regulations on dealing with \nlarge exposures,  the BCBS issued  the Standards on \u2018Supervisory framework for \nmeasuring and controlling large exposures\u2019 in April 2014. The Reserve Bank has  \ndecided to suitably ado pt these standards for banks in India and, accordingly, the \ninstructions on banks' Large Exposures (LE) are  described in the following \nparagraphs.  \n2. Scope of application  2.1 Banks must apply LEF at the same level as the risk -based capital requirements \nare applied, that is, a bank shall comply with the LE F norms at two levels:  (a) \nconsolidated (Group\n1) level and (b) Solo2 level.  \n2.2 The application of the LE F at the consolidated level implies that a bank must \nconsider exposures of all the banking group entities (including overseas operations \n                                                 \n1 This requires that banks shall apply LE framework at the consolidated group  level, after consolidating the \nassets and liabilities of its subsidiaries / joint ventures / associates (including overseas operations through bank\u2019s \nbranches) etc., except those enga ged in insurance and any non -financial activities  \n2 Banks shall apply LE framework at the standalone level  also (including overseas operations through branches), \nwhich should measure the exposures to a counterparty based on its standalone capital strength and risk profile  2 \n through branches and subsidiaries) , which are under regulatory scope of \nconsolidation, to counterparties and compare the aggregate of those exposures with \nthe banking group\u2019s eligible consolidated capital base.  \n3. Scope of counterparties and exemptions \n3.1 Under the LE F, a bank\u2019s exposure to all its counterparties and groups of \nconnected counterparties , excluding the exposures listed below3, will be considered \nfor exposure limits .  The exposures that are  exempted from the LEF  are listed below:  \na. Exposures to the Government of India and State Governments which are  \neligible for zero percent Risk Weight under the Basel III \u2013  Capital Regulation  \nframework of the Reserve Bank of India;  \nb. Exposures to Reserve Bank of India;  \nc. Exposures where the principal and interest are fully guaranteed by the  \nGovernment of India;   \nd. Exposures secured by financial instruments issued by the Government of \nIndia, to the extent that the eligibility criteria for recognition of the credit risk  \nmitigation (CRM) are met in terms of paragraph 7.III  of this circular ; \ne. Intra -day interbank exposures;  \nf. Intra-group exposures4; \ng. Borrowers, to whom limits are authoris ed for food credit ; \nh. Banks\u2019 clearing activities related exposures to Qualifying Central \nCounterparties (QCCPs), as detailed in paragraph 10 .I of this  circular ; \ni. Deposits maintained with NABARD on account of s hortfall in achievement of \ntargets for priority sector  lending.  \n3.2 Where two (or more) entities that are outside the scope of the sovereign \nexemption are controlled by or are economically dependent on an entity that falls within the scope of the sovereign exemption (para 3.1 (a) and 3.1 (b)) , and are \notherwise not connected, those entities will  not be deemed to constitute a group of \nconnected counterparties.   \n                                                 \n3 The exemptions available  under the Master Circular on Exposure Norms  not listed herein will cease to exist \nunder the LE Framework.  \n4 Intra -group exposures will continue to be governed by the circular dated February 11, 2014 on \u201cGuidelines on \nManagement of Intra -Group Transactions and Exposures \u201d. 3 \n 3.3 However, a bank\u2019s exposure to an exempted entity which is hedged by a credit \nderivative shall be treated as an exposure to the counterparty providing the credit \nprotection notwithstanding the fact that the original exposure is exempted.    \n3.4 All exempted exposures must be reported by a bank as required under \nregulatory reporting specified in paragraph 4.2 below, if these exposures meet the criteria for definition of a \u2018Large E xposure\u2019 as per para 4.1 below.  \n4. Definition of a large exposure and regulatory reporting  \n4.1. Under the LE F, the sum of all exposure values of a bank  (measured as specified \nin paragraphs 7 , 8, 9 and 10 of this framework) to a counterparty or a group of \nconnected counterparties (as defined in paragraph 6  below)  is defined as a \u2018Large \nExposure(LE) \u2019, if it is equal to or above 10 percent of the bank\u2019s eligible capital base  \n(i.e., Tier 1 capital as  specifi ed in paragraph 5. 3 below).  \n4.2. Banks shall report  their Large Exposures  to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) , \nDepartment of Banking Supervision, Cent ral Office, (DBS, CO), as per the reporting \ntemplate given in Appendix 1\n.  The reporting, inter -alia, will include the following:  \n(i)   all exposures , measured as specified in paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this \nframework , with values equal to or above 10 percent  of the bank\u2019s eligible \ncapital (i.e., meeting the definition of a large exposure as per para 4.1 above);  \n(ii)  all other exposures , measured as specified in paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10 of \nthis framework  without the effect of credit risk mitigation (CRM) , with values \nequal to or above 10 percent of the bank\u2019s eligible capital  base;  \n(iii) all the exempted exposures (except intraday inter -bank exposures) with \nvalues  equal to or above 10 percent of the bank\u2019 s eligible capital base ; \n(iv)  20 largest exposures  included in the scope of application, irrespective of \nthe values of these exposures relative to the bank\u2019s eligible capital base.  \n5. The Large Exposure limits  \n5.1 Single Counterparty:  The sum of all the exposure values of a bank to a single \ncounterparty must not be higher than 20 percent of the bank\u2019s available eligible \ncapital base at all times. In exceptional cases, Board of banks may allow an \nadditional 5 percent  exposure of the bank \u2019s available eligible capital base. Banks \nshall lay down a Board approved policy in this regard.  4 \n 5.2 Groups of Connected Counterparties:  The sum of all the exposure values of a \nbank to a  group of connected counterparties (as defined in paragraph 6  of this \ncircular ) must not be higher than 25 percent of the bank\u2019s available eligible capital \nbase at all times.  \n5.3 The eligible capital base  for this purpose is the effective amount of Tier 1 capital \nfulfilling the criteria defined in the Master Circular on Basel III \u2013  Capital Regulation  \ndated July 1, 2015  (as amended from time to time)  as per the last audited balance \nsheet.  However, the infusion of capital under Tier I after the published balance sheet \ndate may also be taken into account for the purpose of Large Exposures Framework . \nBanks sh all obtain an external auditor\u2019s certificate on completion of the augmentation \nof capi tal and submit the same to the Reserve Bank of India (Department of Banking \nSupervision) before reckoning the additions to capital funds.  Further, for Indian \nBanks, profits accrued during the year, subject to provisions contained in para \n4.2.3.1 (vii) of Master Circular on Basel III \u2013  Capital Regulation dated July 01, 2015  \n(as amended from time to time) , will also be reckoned as Tier I capital for the \npurpose of Large Exposures Framework  \n5.4 The exposures  must be measured as specified in paragraphs 7 -10 ibid. It may \nbe noted that the LE limit s will be modulated in case of certain counterparties as \nmentioned in paragraph 10 . \n5.5 Any breach of the above LE limits shall  be under exceptional conditions beyond \nthe control of the bank , shall be reported to RBI (DBS, CO) immediately and rapidly \nrectified.  \n6. Definition of connected counterparties \n6.1 In some cases, a bank may have exposures to a group of counterparties with \nspecific relationships or dependencies such that, were one of the counterparties to \nfail, all of the counterparties would very likely fail. A group of this sort, referred to in this framework as a group of connected counterparties, must be treated as a single counterparty. In this case, the sum of the bank\u2019s exposures to all the individual \nentities included within a group of connected counterparties is subject to the large exposure limit , as mentioned at paragraph 5.2 above,  and to the regulatory reporting \nrequirements as specified above.  5 \n 6.2 Two or more natural or legal persons shall be deemed to be a group of \nconnected counterparties  if at least one of the following criteria is satisfied:  \n(a) Control relationship: one of the counterparties, directly or indirectly, has control \nover the other(s)  or the counterparties are, directly or indirectly, controlled by a third \nparty (bank may or may not have exposure towards this third party ). In case of \nfinancial probl ems of the controlling entity, it is highly likely that the controlling entity \ncould make use of its ability  to extract capital and/or liquidity from the controlled \nentity, thereby weakening the financial position of the latter. Financial problems could be transferred to the controlled entity, with the result that both the controlling entity \nand the controlled entity would experience financial problems (domino effect ). From \nprudential perspective, these type of clients (connected by control) form a single ri sk. \n(b) Economic interdependence: if one of the counterparties were to experience financial problems, in particular funding or repayment difficulties, the other(s), as a result, would also be likely to encounter funding or repayment difficulties.  \n6.3 Banks must assess the relationship amongst counterparties with reference to (a) \nand (b)\n5 above in order to establish the existence of a group of connected \ncounterparties. In assessing whether there is a control relationship between counterparties, banks m ust automatically consider that the control relationship \ncriterion (paragraph 6.2(a) above)  is satisfied if one entity owns more than 50 \npercent of the voting rights of the other entity. In addition, banks must assess connectedness between counterparties based on control using the following evidences : \na. Voting agreements (e.g., control of a maj ority of voting rights pursuant to an \nagreement with other shareholders);  \nb. Significant influence on the appointment or dismissal of an entity\u2019s administrative, management or supervisory body, such as the right to appoint or remove a majority of members i n those bodies, or the fact that a majority of \nmembers have been appointed solely as a result of the exercise of an individual entity\u2019s voting rights;  \nc. Significant influence on senior management, e.g., an entity has the power, pursuant to a contract or o therwise, to exercise a controlling influence over \nthe management or policies of another entity (e.g., through consent rights \n                                                 \n5 Banks are required to assess connectedness based on economic interdependence from April 01, 2020.  6 \n over key decisions , to decide on the strategy or direct the activities of an \nentity, to decide on crucial transactions such as transfer of profit or loss ); \nd. The above criteria may also be assessed with respect to a common third \nparty (such as holding company) , irrespective of whether the bank has an \nexposure to that entity or not;  \n6.4 Banks are also expected to refer to criteria specified in the extant accounting \nstandards  for further qualitative guidance when determining control.  \n6.5 While determining control relationship, banks should also examine cases w here \nclients have common owners, shareholders or managers ; for example, horizontal \ngroups where an undertaking is related to one or more other undertakings because \nthey all have the same shareholder structure without a single controlling shareholder \nor because they are managed on a unified basis. This management may be \npursuant to a contract concluded between the undertakings, or to provisions in the memoranda or articles of association of those undertakings, or if the administrative management or supervisory bodies of the undertaking and of one or more other undertakings consist, for the major part, of the same persons.  \n6.6 Where control has been established based on any of the above criteria, a bank \nmay still demonstrate to the R BI in exceptional cases  (e.g., existence of control \nbetw een counterparties due to specific circumstances and corporate governance \nsafeguards ) that such control does not necessarily result in the entities concerned \nconstituting a group of connected counterparties.  For example, in specific cases \nwhere a special purpose entity  (SPE)  that is controlled by another client (e.g. an \noriginator) is fully ring- fenced and bankruptcy remote (ie. arrangements exist to the \neffect that assets of SPE are not available to lenders of parent undertaking in the event of insolvency of the parent undertaking)  \u2013 so that there is no possible channel \nof contagion.  Hence no single risk  exists between the special purpose entity and the \ncontrolling parent entity.   \n6.7 In establishing connectedness based on economic interdependence, banks must \nconsider, at a minimum, the following criteria:  \n\uf0d8 Where 50% or more of one counterparty's gross receipts or gross expenditures (on an annual basis) is derived from transactions with the other counterparty;  7 \n \uf0d8  Where one counterparty has fully or partly guaranteed the exposure of the \nother counterparty, or is liable by other means, and the exposure is so \nsignificant that the guarantor is likely to default if a claim occurs;    \n\uf0d8 Where a significant part of one counterparty\u2019s production/output is sold to another c ounterparty, which cannot easily be replaced by other customers;  \n\uf0d8 When the expected source of funds to repay the loans of both counterparties is the same and neither counterparty has another independent source of income from which the loan may be serviced and fully repaid;    \n\uf0d8 Where it is likely that the financial problems of one counterparty would cause difficulties for the other counterparties in terms of full and timely repayment of \nliabilities;    \n\uf0d8 Where the insolvency or default of one counterparty is likely to be associated \nwith the insolvency or default of the other(s);    \n\uf0d8 When two or more counterparties rely on the same source for the majority of their funding and, in the event of the common provider\u2019s default, an alternative provider cannot be found -  in this case, the funding problems of one \ncounterparty are likely to spread to another due to a one- way or two -way \ndependence on the same main funding source.   \nIllustrations are provided in appendix 2\n. \n6.8 There may, however , be circumstances where some of these criteria do not \nautomatically imply an economic dependence that results in two or more counterparties being connected. Provided that the bank can demonstrate that a counterparty which is economically closely related t o another counterparty may \novercome financial difficulties, or even the second counterparty\u2019s default, by finding alternative business partners or funding sources within an appropriate time period, the bank does not need to combine these counterparties to form a group of connected counterparties.  \n6.9 In order to avoid cases where a thorough investigation of economic \ninterdependencies will not be proportionate to the size of the exposures , banks are \nexpected to identify possible connected counterparties on t he basis of economic \ninterdependence in all cases where the sum of all exposures to one individual counterparty exceeds 5% of the eligible capital base, and not in other cases . 8 \n 6.10 Relation between interconnectedness through control and \ninterconnectedness through economic dependency : Group of counterparties \nbased on control and economic interdependence are to be assessed separately. \nHowever, there may be situations where the two types  of dependencies are \ninterlinked and could therefore exist within one group of connected counterparties in such a way that all relevant clients constitute a single risk.  Risk of contagion is \npresent irrespective of type of connectedness  (i.e. control or economic \ninterdependence)  between counterparties. The chain of contagion leading to \npossible default of all entities concerned is the relevant factor for the grouping and needs to be assessed in each individual case. Illustrations are given in appendix 3\n. \n6.11 Banks shall frame Board approved policies for determining connectedness \nusing the criteria  mentioned above.  The policies are subject to supervisory scrutiny.\n  \n7. Values of exposures \n7.I General measurement principles \n7.1 Under the proposed LE Framework, an exposure to a counterparty will constitute \nboth on and off -balance sheet exposures included in either the banking or trading \nbook and instruments with counterparty credit risk.  Definitions and measurements of \nsuch expos ures are given in this section.  \n7.II Definitions of exposure values under the LE Framework  \n7.2 Banking book on- balance sheet non- derivative assets:  The exposure value \nis defined as the accounting value of the exposure6. As an alternative,  a bank may \nconsider the exposure value gross of specific provisions  and value adjustments . \n7.3 Banking book and trading book OTC derivatives (and any other instrument \nwith counterparty credit risk):  The exposure value for instruments which give rise \nto counterparty c redit risk and are not securities financing transactions, should be \ndetermined as per the  extant instructions as prescribed by the Reserve Bank  (on \nexposure at default)  for the counterparty credit risk7. \n                                                 \n6 Net of specific provisions and value adjustments.  \n7 Refer to Master Circular  \u2013 Basel III Capital Regulation, as amended  from time to time  9 \n 7.4 Securities financing transactions (SFTs): Banks should use the method they \ncurrently use for calculating their risk -based capital requirements against SFTs.  \n7.5 Banking book \u201ctraditional\u201d off -balance sheet commitments:  For the purpose \nof the LE F, off-balance sheet items will be converted into credit exposure equivalents \nthrough the use of credit conversion factors (CCFs) by applying the CCFs set out for \nthe Standardised Approach for credit risk for risk -based capital requirements, with a \nfloor of  10 percent.  \n7.III Eligible credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques  \n7.6 Eligible credit risk mitigation techniques for LE Framework purposes are those that meet the minimum requirements and eligibility criteria for the recognition of \nunfunded credit protection\n8 and financial collateral that qualify as eligible financial \ncollateral under the Standardised Approach for  credit risk for risk-based capital \nrequirement purposes.  \n7.7 Other forms of collateral s that are only eligible under the Internal -Ratings based \n(IRB) Approach (receivables, commercial and residential real estate and other \ncollateral) are not eligible to reduce exposure values for LE F purposes.  \n7.8 A bank must recognise an eligible CRM technique in the calculation of an \nexposure whenev er it has used this technique to calculate the risk -based capital \nrequirements, provided it meets the conditions for recognition under the LE F. \n7.9 Treatment of maturity mismatches in CRM : In accordance with provisions set \nout in the paragraphs 5.17 and 7 of \u2018Master Circular \u2013 Basel III Capital Regulations\u2019, \nhedges with maturity mismatches will be recognised only when their original maturities are equal to or greater than one year and the residual maturity of a hedge is not less than three months.  \n7.10 If there is a maturity mismatch in respect of credit risk mitigants (collateral, on -\nbalance sheet netting, guarantees and credit derivatives) recognised in the risk -\nbased capital requirement, the adjustment of the credit protection for the purpose of \n                                                 \n8 Unfunded credit protection refers collectively to credit derivatives and guarantees the treatment of which is \ndescribed in paragraphs 5.17 & 7.5 respectively (The standardised approach \u2013 credit risk mitigation) of the \nMaster Circular \u2013 Basel III Capital Regulations dated July 1, 2015  10 \n calculating large exposures will be determined using the same approach as in the \nrisk-based capital requirement9. \n7.11 On-balance sheet netting: Where a bank has in place legally enforceable \nnetting arrangements for loans and deposits, it may calculate the exposure values \nfor LE purposes according to the calculation it uses for capital requirements purposes \u2013 i.e., on the basis of net credit exposures subject to the conditions set out \nin the appr oach to on- balance sheet netting in the risk -based capital requirement\n10. \n7.IV. Recognition of CRM techniques in reduction of original exposure  \n7.12. Under the LEF, a bank may reduce the value of the exposure to the original \ncounterparty by the amount of the eligible CRM technique (except for cases \nmentioned in paragr aph 7.14 below) recognised for risk -based capital requirements \npurposes. This recognised amount is:  \n\u2022 the value of the protected portion in the case of unfunded credit protection;  \n\u2022 the value of the collateral as recognized in calculation of the counterparty \ncredit risk exposure value for any instruments with counterparty credit risk, such as OTC derivatives;  \n\u2022 the value of the collateral adjusted after applying the required haircuts, in the case of financial collateral. The haircuts used to reduce the collateral amount are the supervisory haircuts under the comprehensive approach\n11 as \nspecified under risk based capital requirements.  \n7.V Recognition of exposures to CRM providers \n7.13 Where a bank reduces its exposure to the original counterparty on account of \nan eligible CRM instrument provided by another counterparty (CRM provider) with respect to that exposure, it must also recognise an exposure to the CRM provider. The amount assigned to the CRM provider will be the amount by which the exposure to the original c ounterparty is reduced (except in the cases defined in paragraph 7.14 \nbelow) . It is clarified that any CRM instrument (e.g. SBLC/BG from Head Office /other \noverseas branch) from which CRM benefits like shifting of exposure/ risk weights etc  \nare not derived, may not be counted as an exposure on the CRM provider.  \n                                                 \n9 Refer to the Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations  \n10 Paragraph 7.4 of the Master Circular on Basel III Capita l Regulation.  \n11 Paragraph 7.3.4 of Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations.  11 \n 7.14 When the credit protection takes the form of a credit default swap (CDS) and \neither the CDS provider or the referenced entity is not a financial entity, the amount \nto be assigned to the credit protection provider is not the amount by which the exposure to the original counterparty is reduced but will be equal to the counterparty \ncredit risk exposure value calculated according to the Standardised Approach \u2013  \nCounterparty Credit Ris k (SA- CCR), once the guidelines in the matter are finali sed \nby the R BI. Till such time, the banks may follow the extant method as prescribed by  \nthe RBI for the counterparty credit risk in the Master Circular \u2013  Basel III Capital \nRegulation.  \n \nFor the purpose of this paragraph, financial entities comprise:  \ni Regulated financial institutions, defined as a parent and its subsidiaries where \nany substantial legal entity in the consolidated group is supervised by a regulator that imposes prudential requirements consi stent with international \nnorms. These include, but are not limited to, prudentially regulated insurance companies, broker/dealers, banks;  \nand \nii Unregulated financial institutions, defined as legal entities whose main \nbusiness includes: the management of financial assets, lending, factoring, \nleasing, provision of credit enhancements, securitisation, investments, financial custody, central counterparty services, proprietary trading and other financial services activities identified by supervisors.   \n7.VI Calculation of exposure value for Trading Book positions  \n7.15 A bank must add any exposures to a counterparty arising in the trading book to \nany other exposures to that counterparty  that lie in the banking book to calculate its \ntotal exposure to that counterparty. The exposures considered here correspond to concentr ation risk associated with the default of a single counterparty  for exposures \nincluded in the trading book. Therefore, a bank\u2019s exposures to financial instruments issued by counterparties not exempted under this Framework will be governed by the LE limit, but concentrations in a particular commodity or currency will not be.  12 \n 7.16 The exposure value of straight debt instruments and equities will be equal to the \nmarket value of the exposure12. \n7.17 Instruments such as swaps, futures, forwards and credit derivatives13 must be \nconverted into positions following the risk -based capital requirements14. These \ninstruments should be decomposed into their individual legs. Only transaction legs \nrepresenting a bank\u2019s exposures to the counterparty within the scope of the large exposures framework should be considered\n15 for calculating a bank\u2019s total exposure \nto that counterparty.  \n7.18 In the case of credit derivatives that represent sold protection, the exposure will \nbe to the referenced name, and it will be the amount due in case the respective \nreferenced name triggers the instrument, minus the absolute value of the credit \nprotection16. For credit -linked notes (CLNs)17, the protection seller bank will be \nrequired to consider its positions both in the bond of the note issuer and in the \nunderlying referenced by the note.  \n7.19 The measures of exposure values of options  (primarily meant for credit and \nequity options , where permitted)  under this framework differ from the exposure \nvalues used for risk -based capital requirements. The exposure value of option under \nthis framework will be based on the change(s) in option prices that would result f rom \na default of the respective underlying instrument. The exposure value for a simple long call option would therefore be its market value and for a short put option would be equal to the strike price of the option minus its market value. In the case of s hort \ncall or long put options, a default of the underlying would lead to a profit (i.e., a \nnegative exposure) instead of a loss, resulting in an exposure of the option\u2019s market \n                                                 \n12 As provided in terms of our RBI Master Circular \u2013 Exposure norms / Master Circular  on Prudential Norms for \nClassification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks.  \n13 CDS is the only credit derivative allowed u nder our extant guidelines  and banks do not have direct exposures \nto the equity derivatives. It is clarified tha t restrictions on dealing with certain type of instruments, assets and \nderivatives etc., which are currently in place shall continue to be applicable even if the guidelines contained in \nthis circular contains references to the same.  \n14 Refer Master Circular  - Basel III Capital Regulations  \n15 At present, banks are not permitted to have exposures to equity derivatives, however, for the sake illustration, \na future on stock X, for example, is decomposed into a long position in stock X and a short position in a risk -\nfree interest rate exposure in the respective funding currency, or a typical interest rate swap is represented by a \nlong position in a fixed and a  short position in a floating interest rate exposure or vice versa.  \n16 In the case that the market value of the credit derivative is positive from the perspective of the protection \nseller, such a positive market value would also have to be added to the exposure of the protection seller to the protection buyer (counterparty credit risk; see paragraph 7 .3 of this circular ). Such a situation could typically \noccur if the present value of already agreed but not yet paid periodic premiums exceeds the absolute mark et \nvalue of the credit protection.  \n17 CLNs are not permitted to be issued by banks in India under the extant RBI guidelines . 13 \n value in the former case and equal the strike price of the option minus its mar ket \nvalue in the latter case. The resulting positions in all cases should be aggregated \nwith those from other exposures. After aggregation, negative net exposures shall be treated as zero.  \n7.20 Exposure values of banks\u2019 investments in transactions (i.e., i ndex positions, \nsecuritisations, hedge funds or investment funds) must be calculated applying the same rules as for similar instruments in the banking book (see paragraphs under 8.3 to 8.10). \n7.VII Offsetting long and short positions in the trading book  \n7.21 Offsetting between long and short positions in the same issue:  Banks may \noffset long and short positions in the same issue (two issues are defined as the \nsame if the issuer, coupon, currency and maturity are identical). Consequently, \nbanks may consider a net position in a specific issue for the purpose of calculating a bank\u2019s exposure to a particular counterparty.  \n7.22 Offsetting between long and short positions in different issues:  Positions \nin different issues from the same counterparty may be offset only when the short \nposition is junior to the long position, or if the positions are of the same seniority.  \n7.23 Similarly, for positions hedged by credit derivatives, the hedge may be \nrecognised provided the underlying of the hedge and the position hedged fulfil the provision of paragraph 7. 22 above (the short position is junior or of equivalent \nsecurity to the long position).  \n7.24 In order to determine the relative seniority of positions, securities may be \nallocated into broad buckets of degrees of seniori ty (for example, \u201cEquity\u201d, \n\u201cSubordinated Debt\u201d and \u201cSenior Debt\u201d).  \n7.25 The banks that find it excessively burdensome to allocate securities to different \nbuckets based on relative seniority, should not recognise offsetting of long and short \npositions in different issues relating to the same counterparty in calculating exposures.  \n7.26 Offsetting short positions in the trading book against long positions in the \nbanking book:  Netting across the banking and trading books is not permitted.  14 \n 7.27 Net short positions after offsetting:  When the result of the offsetting is a net \nshort position with a single counterparty, this net exposure need not be considered \nas an exposure for the purpose of LE F. \n8. Treatment of specific exposure types  \n8.1 This section covers exposures for which a specific treatment is deemed \nnecessary.  \nInterbank Exposures  \n8.2 The interbank exposures, except intra- day interbank exposures, will be  subject to \nthe large exposure limit of 25% of a bank\u2019s Tier  1 capital  (also refer to paragraph \n10.III).  In stressed circumstances, RBI may accept  a breach of an interbank limit ex \npost, in order to help ensure stability in the interbank market.        \nCollective Investment Undertakings (CIUs), securitisation vehicl es and other \nstructures - adoption of \u201cLook Through Approach\u201d (LTA)  \n8.3 There are cases when a structure lies between the bank and its exposures, that \nis, the bank invests in structures which themselves have exposures to assets \nunderlying the structures (hereafter referred to as the \u201cunderlying assets\u201d). Such \nstructures include funds18, securitisations and other structures19 with underlying \nassets. Bank s must assign such exposure amount, i.e., the amount invest ed in a \nparticular structure, to specific counterparties of the underlying assets following the \nLTA described below. Illustrative example is provided in Appendix 4. \n8.4 A bank may assign the exposure amount to the structure itself, defined as a \ndistinct counterparty, if it can demonstrate that the bank\u2019s exposure amount to each \nunderlying asset of the structure is smaller than 0.25% of its eligible capital base, \nconsideri ng only those exposure to underlying assets that result from the investment \nin the structure itself  and using the exposure value calculated according to \nparagraph 8.9 and 8.10.  In this case, a bank is not required to look through the \nstructure to identify the underlying assets .  \n8.5 A bank must look through the structure to identify those underlying assets for \nwhich the underlying exposure value is equal to or above 0.25% of its eligible capital \n                                                 \n18 such as mutual funds, venture capital funds, alternative investment funds  \n19 such as investment in security receipts, real estate i nvestment trusts, infrastructure investment \ntrusts  15 \n base.  In this case, the counterparty corresponding to each of the underlying assets \nmust be identified so that these underlying exposures can be added to any other \ndirect or indirect exposure to the same counterparty.  The bank\u2019s exposure amount to \nthe underlying assets that are below 0.25% of the bank\u2019s eligible capital base may be assigned to the structure itself  (i.e. partial look -through is permitted) . \n8.6 If a bank is unable to identify the underlying assets of a structure:  \na) where the total amount of a bank\u2019s exposures to a structure does not exceed 0.25 \nper cent of its eligible capital base, it must assign the total exposure amount to the \nstructure itself, as a distinct counterparty.  \nb) Otherwise  (i.e. if the exposure to the structure equals or exceeds 0.25 per cent of \nits eligible capital base) , it must  assign this total exposure amount to the \u2018 unknown \nclient \u2019. \nThe large exposure limit will apply on the aggregate of all such exposures to \n\u2018unknown clients\u2019 as if they are a single counterparty.  \n8.7 Where  the LTA is not required (para 8.4 above) , a bank must nevertheless be \nable to demonstrate that regulatory arbitrage considerations have not influenced the decision whether to look through or not \u2013  e.g. that the bank has not circumvented the \nlarge exposure limit by investing in several individually immaterial transactions with \nidentical underlying assets.  \n8.8 If LTA need not be applied, a bank\u2019s exposure to the structure must be the \nnominal amount it invests i n the structure.  \n8.9 Any structure where all investors rank pari passu (e.g., CIU)  - When the LTA is  \nrequired according to the paragraphs above, the exposure value assigned to a \ncounterparty is equal to the pro rata share that the bank holds in the structure  \nmultiplied by the value of the underlying asset in the structure. Thus, a bank holding  \na \u20b91 investment in a structure, which invests in 20 assets each with a value of  \u20b9 5, \nmust assign an exposure of \u20b9  0.05 to each of the counterparties. An exposu re to \nsuch counterparty must be added to any other direct or indirect exposures the bank \nhas to that counterparty.  \n8.10 Any structure with different seniority levels among investors ( e.g. securitisation \nvehicles) - When the LTA (in terms of paragraphs abov e) is required for an \ninvestment in a structure with different levels of seniority, the exposure value to a  16 \n counterparty should be measured for each tranche within the structure, assuming a  \npro rata distribution of losses amongst investors in a single tranche. To compute the \nexposure value to the underlying asset, a bank must:  \ni. first, consider the lower of the value of the tranche in which the bank invests  \nand the nominal value of each underlying asset included in the underlying  \nportfolio of assets   \nii. second, apply the pro rata share of the bank\u2019s investment in the tranche to  \nthe value determined in the first step above.  \n \n9. Identification of additional risks \n9.1 While taking exposures to structures, banks should identify such third parties \nwhich may constitute an additional risk factor and which are inherent in the structure \nitself rather than in the underlying assets. Such a third party could be a risk factor for \nmore than one structure that a bank invests in. Examples of roles played by third parties include originator, fund manager, liquidity provider and credit protection provider.  RBI as a part of its pillar 2 supervisory review and evaluation process will \nlook into this aspect and if required specify a specific course of action which may either i nclude reduction in exposure or raising of additional capital.  \n9.2 It is conceivable that a bank may consider multiple third parties to be potential \ndrivers of additional risk. In this case, the bank must assign the exposure resulting from the investment i n the relevant structures to each of the third parties.  \n10. Exposures to and among certain specific counterparties \n10.I Exposures to Central Counterparties  \n10.1 Banks\u2019 exposures to QCCPs\n20 related to clearing activities will be exempted \nfrom the LE framework. However, these exposures will be subject to the regulatory \nreporting requi rements as defined in paragraph 4.2.  \n10.2 The definition of QCCP for the purpose of this Framework is the same as that \nused for risk -based capital requirement purposes. A QCCP is an entity that is \nlicensed to operate as a CCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an \n                                                 \n20 For designation of CCPs as QCCPs  please refer to circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.82/21.06.217/2013 -14 dated \nJanuary 7, 2014  on Banks' Exposure to Central Counterparties (CCPs) - Interim Arrangements,   \n 17 \n exemption), and is permitted by the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as \nsuch w ith respect to the products offered. This is subject to the provision that the \nCCP is based and prudentially supervised in a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly indicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the \nCPSS- IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.  \n10.3 In the case of non- QCCPs, banks must measure their exposure as a sum of \nboth the clearing exposures described in paragraph 1 0.5 and the non- clearing \nexposures described in paragraph 10 .7, and the same will be subject to the  LE limit \nof 25 percent of the eligible capital base.  \n10.4 The concept of connected counterparties described in paragraph 6  does not \napply in the context of exposures to CCPs that are specifically related to clearing activities.  \n10.5 Calculation of exposures related to clearing activities:  Banks must identify \nexposures to a CCP related to clearing activities and sum together t hese exposures. \nExposures related to clearing activities are listed in the table below together with the \nexposure value to be used:  \nTrade exposures  The exposure value of trade exposures \nmust be calculated using the exposure \nmeasures prescribed in other parts of \nthis framework for the respective type of exposures.  \nSegregated initial margin  The exposure value is 021. \nNon-segregated initial margin  \n The exposure value is the nominal \namount of initial margin posted.  \nPre-funded default fund contributions  Nominal amount of the funded \ncontribution \nUnfunded default fund contributions  The exposure value is 0  \n \n                                                 \n21 When the initial margin (IM) posted is bankruptcy -remote from the CCP \u2013  in the sense that it is segregated \nfrom the CCP\u2019s own accounts, eg when the IM is held by a third -party  custodian \u2013 this amount cannot be lost by \nthe bank if the CCP defaults; therefore, the IM posted by the bank can be exempted from the large exposure \nlimit.  18 \n 10.6 Regarding exposures subject to clearing services (the bank acting as a clearing \nmember or being a client of a clearing member), the bank must determine the \ncounterparty to which exposures must be assi gned by applying the provisions of the \nrisk-based capital requirements.  \n10.7 Other exposures:  Other types of exposures that are not directly related to \nclearing services provided by the CCP, such as equity stake22, funding facilities, \ncredit facilities, guarantees etc ., must be measured according to the rules set out in \nthis framework, as for any o ther type of counterparty. These exposures will be added \ntogether and be subjected to the LE limit.  \n10. II. Exposures to NBFCs  \n10.8 Exposure Ceilings proposed under LE Framework  \n(i) Exposures to NBFCs: Banks\u2019 exposures to a single NBFC will be restricted to 15 percent of their eligible capital base. However, based on the risk perception, more \nstringent exposure limits in respect of certain categories of NBFCs may be considered.  \n(ii) Banks\u2019 exposures to a group of connected NBFCs or group of connected \ncount erparties having NBFCs in the group will be restricted to 25 percent of their Tier \nI Capital.  \n10.9 The above exposure limits are subject to all other instructions  in relation to \nbanks\u2019 exposures to NBFCs.\n23 \n10.III Large exposures rules for global systemical ly important banks (G -SIBs) \nand domestic systemically important banks (D -SIBs)  \n10.10 The LE limit applied to a G -SIB\u2019s exposure to another G -SIB is set at 15 \npercent of the eligible capital base.  \n10.11 The LE limit of a non G-SIB in India to a G -SIB in India or overseas will be 20 \npercent of the eligible capital base.   \n10.12 For above paragraphs, t he limit applies to G -SIBs as identified by the Basel \nCommittee and published annually by the FSB.  When a bank becomes a G -SIB, it \nmust apply the 15 percent exposure limit to another G -SIB within 12 months from the \n                                                 \n22 If equity stakes in a CCP are deducted from the capital on which the large exposure limit is base d, these must \nnot be included as exposure to the CCP.  \n23 As contained in Master Circular \u2013 Exposure Norms / Master Circular - Bank finance to NBFCs  19 \n date of becoming G -SIB, which is the same time frame within which a bank that has \nbecome a G -SIB would need to satisfy its higher loss absor bency capital \nrequirement. Similarly, when a counterparty bank becomes G-SIB, banks may apply \nlimits as indicated in para 10.10 or 10.11 , as applicable,  within 12 months from the \ndate of counterparty bank becoming G -SIB. For the purpose of computing exposure  \nlimits  under LEF, Indian branches of foreign G -SIBs will not be considered as G -\nSIBs.  Accordingly, for Indian branches of foreign G -SIBs, exposure limit on a G-SIB, \nincluding their head office24, will be 20% of eligible capital base and exposure limit \non any other bank (i.e. not G -SIB) will be 25% of eligible capital base. Similarly, for \nIndian branches of foreign non- GSIBs, exposure limit on a non-GSIB, including their \nhead office24, will be 25% of eligible capital base and exposure limit on a G-SIB will \nbe 20% of eligible capital base.  \n10.13 The Reserve Bank has issued the Framework for dealing with Domestic \nSystemically Important Banks (D -SIBs) on July 22, 2014 and discloses names of the \nbanks classified as D -SIBs on an annual basis.  There is  no separate exposure limit \napplicable to D -SIBs  and they will continue to be governed by interbank exposure \nlimits under the LEF.   \n11. Implementation date and transitional arrangements \nAll aspects of the LE Framework  except guidelines with reference to economic \ninterdependence criteria and non- centrally cleared derivatives exposures , (both of \nwhich are applicable from April 1, 2020) , are applicable in full with effect from April 1, \n2019 (as was already specified in our LEF circular dated December 1, 2016)  and the \nexposure norms applicable to single/group of connected counterparties are no longer \napplicable from that date25. Banks must adjust their exposures so as to comply with \nthe LE lim it with respect to their eligible capital base by the date of implementation. \nAccordingly, for aspects applicable from April 01, 2020, prior to this date, banks \nshould avoid taking any additional exposure/reduce exposure in cases where their \nexposure is at  or abov e the exposure limit prescribed under this Framework.  While \nnon-centrally cleared derivatives exposures are exempt till March 31, 2020 , banks \n                                                 \n24 Including other overseas branches/subsidiaries  \n25 The LE  Framework is applicable to a bank\u2019s counterparties and does not address other types of concentration \nrisks such as sectoral exposures.  As such, the extant instructions contained in the RBI Master Circular \u2013  \nExposure norms, will continue to be applicable, except to the extent superseded by the provisions of  this \nFramework.    20 \n must compute these exposures separately and report to the Department of Banking \nRegulation on quarterly basis.   21 \n Appendix 1 \nReturn on Large Exposures  \nName of the Bank   \nReturn for the Month   \nEligible Capital base (Tier I)  (Rs. crore)  \n \nA.

Banks may consider parameters like networth, EBITDA, liquid assets, etc to assess whether the guarantor will be in a position to honour the claim on an on- going basis.  \n \n\uf0d8 Where a significant part of one counterparty\u2019s production/output is sold to another counterparty, which cannot easily be replaced by other customers;  \n \nIllustrative Example:  \nWhen a significant part of  product/output/services  of Company  A is sold to \nCompany  B and there are no alternate buyers who can be approached if B \nfails to buy , in such a case goods may remain unsold and could lead to default \nin loan repayment  by A.  An auto part supplier and auto manufacturing firm \ncould be part of the same economically dependent group based on this \ncriteria. For deciding if the criteria would be applicable to the counterparties 24 \n under consideration, banks may use financial criteria like unsold inventory \nleading to operating loss/default in repayment as well a s subjective criteria like \nability of the seller to find alternate buyer/ market, R&D capability of the seller , \netc. \n \n\uf0d8 When the expected source of funds to repay the loans of both counterparties is the same and neither counterparty has another independent s ource of \nincome from which the loan may be serviced and fully repaid;    \n \nIllustrative Example:  \nTwo auto component manufacturers i.e. company A and co mpany  B are \nsuppliers to a commercial vehicle manufacturer i.e. c ompany  C. Source of \nfunds for repayment of loans taken by A and B is  dependent on sales to C. In \nthis case, A and B are connected to each other based on the criteria of economic interdependence.  Important factors to consider would be extent of \ndependence of A and B on C, ability of A and B to find another buyer, etc.  \n \n\uf0d8 Where it is likely that the financial problems of one counterparty would cause difficulties for the other counterparties in terms of full and timely repayment of liabilities;    \n \nIllustrative Example:  Com pany A supplies intermediate goods to Company C. \nCompany C processes these goods and then sells it to company B . In such \ncases, difficulties at A could lead to difficulties for B . In such cases A and B \nare economically dependent.  Banks may consider factors like financial \nstrength of counterparty B  to withstand the shock, its ability to find alternate \nsupplier in place of C , etc. to decide on applicability of the criteria.   \n \n\uf0d8 Where the insolvency or default of one counterparty is li kely to be associated \nwith the insolvency or default of the other(s);    \n \nIllustrative Example:  \nExamples would include all such cases where insolvency or default of one company  may lead to the insolvency or default of the other companies . Banks \nmay use criteria such as intercorporate liabilities, significant trade receivables, etc. to decide on applicability of the criteria.   \n 25 \n \uf0d8 When two or more counterparties rely on the same source for the majority of \ntheir funding and, in the event of the common provider\u2019s default, an alternative provider cannot be found -  in this case, the funding problems of one \ncounterparty are likely to spread to another due to a one- way or two -way \ndependence on the same main funding source.   \nIllustrative Example:  \nCom pany A and Company B rel y on the same non- bank source for their \nfunding requirements and may not have access to alternative sources of funds. In such cases, difficulties at common source could lead to difficulties at both the companies  and thus these companies  are interconnected based on \neconomic interdependence.  Important factors to consider would be strength of  \nA and B to decide alternate source of funds , likelihood of failure of the non-\nbank source, etc.  \nEconomic inter dependence with two different entities\n \nIf an entity  (C) is economically dependent on two (or more) other entities  (A and B) \nthen payment difficulty of any one of the entities (A or B) may cause payment \ndifficulties to dependent entity (C).  Thus, C needs to be added in two different groups \n(A and C; B and C).  \n                                                              Grouping requirement  \n                         \n \nSince exposure to C is considered as single risk for two separate groups, it does  not \namount to double counting of exposure of C.  \n   \n26 \n Appendix 3 \nRelation between interconnectedness through control and interconnectedness \nthrough economic dependency  and illustration of grouping requirements \nFollowing examples provide illustrations for formulation of groups in case of one- way \ndependency and two- way dependencies.  \na) For example, consider A controls A1 and A2,  and B controls B1,  and B1 is \neconomically dependent on A2 (one- way dependency only  i.e. financial difficulties at \nA2 could impact B1 but not vice versa ). In this case, B1 should be part of two \nseparate groups of A  and B.  \n \nGrouping requirements:  \n \n Three different groups of i) A, A1, A2, ii) B, B1, iii) A2, B1, may not be sufficient as financial difficulties of A2 is likely to cause difficulties for B1 also which is economically dependent on A2 (which in turn is dependent on A).  \nb) In above example, consider that A2 and B1 have two- way economic dependency \ni.e. both are economically dependent on each other , which means that  financial \ndifficulty at either entity could impact the other  entity .  A \nA1 A2 B \nB1 \nA \nA1 A2 B1 B \nB1 27 \n  \nGrouping requirements:  \n  \n \nDownstream Contagion \nDownstream contagion should be assumed when an entity is economically \ndependent on another entity and is itself the head of a \u2018control group\u2019. If the other \nentity is part of a group of connected clients, the control group of the economically dependent enti ty should then be included in the group of connected counterparties to \nwhich the economic dependency relationship exists. To overcome its own pending payment difficulties, the economically dependent entity is likely to withdraw resources from controlled entities, thus extending the risk of contagion downstream.  \n \na) For example, consider A controls A1 and A2,  and B controls B1,  and B1 controls \nB2 and B3. Further, consider B1 has one- way economic dependency on A2.

If \nthere are interconnections among entities that  are not clients of the bank, it may be \ndifficult  for the bank  to formulate correct groupings. However, the bank should \nincorporate any information that may be available to it publicly or through other clients or entities outside its clientele.   \n \na) For instance, in illustration shown below, if bank has exposure to A and B5 only, then it may be difficult to formulate correct groupings.

The working hours/days need to be displayed prominently.  \n \n3.1.2 A banking outlet which does not provide delivery of service for a minimum of four hours per \nday and for at least five  days a week will be considered a \u2018Part-time Banking Outlet\u2019.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n 3.2 Unbanked Rural Centre  \n \nAn \u2018Unbanked Rural Centre\u2019 (URC) is a rural (Tier 5 and 6) centre th at does not have a CBS -\nenabled banking outlet  of a Scheduled Commercial Bank, a Small Finance Bank, a Payment Bank \nor a Regional Rural Bank nor a branch of Local Area Bank or licensed Co-operative Bank for \ncarrying out customer based banking transactions.  \n \nN.B.1: Extension Counters, Satellite Offices, Part -shifted Branches, Ultra Small Branches and \nSpecialised Branches, subject to their satisfying the definition given above, shall be treated as independent \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 or \u2018Part-time Banking Outlets\u2019, as the case may be.  \n \nN.B.2: ATMs, E - lobbies , Bunch Note Acceptor Machines (BNAM), Cash Deposit Machines (CDM), \nE- Kiosks and Mobile Branches will not be treated as \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019. Point of Sale (PoS) \nterminals where limited cash withdrawal facility is allowed by banks in terms of extant instructions \nwithout having an arrangement w ith the concerned entities as \u2018Business C orrespondents\u2019 will not \nbe considered as \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019.  \n 4. Opening of Banking Outlets by Regional Rural Banks \n \n4.1 (a) Regional Rural Banks are  permitted to open banking outlets in Tier 1 to Tier 6 centres (as \nper census 2011) as per the following arrangement:-  \n \nFor opening of banking outlets  (excluding BC outlets)  in Tier 1 to 4 centres, RRBs are required to \nobtain prior approval of RBI. Their application shall be considered, provided they fulfill the following \nconditions:  \n\u2022 Minimum CRAR of nine percent  \n\u2022 Net NPA ratio does not exceed five  percent.  \n\u2022 No default in maintenance of CRR and SLR during last two years. \n\u2022 Net Profit in the previous  financial year. \n\u2022 All branches and Head offices of the RRB should be CBS compliant and have in place \nsystem generated NPA recognition.  \n 4.1 (b) Regional Rural Banks  will have general permission for opening ba nking outlets in rural \ncentres i.e. Tier 5 and 6 centres (as per census 2011) without having the need to seek specific 3 \n approval  from the Reserve Bank of India in each case, subject to post facto reporting  (within seven \ndays of opening a banking outlet) to Regional Office concerned of RBI.  \n \n(i) For opening branches  in tier 1 to 4 centres during the current year, the permission for opening \nnew branches  shall be granted, only after the RRB had achieved the target of opening 25 percent \nof the total banking outlets in unbanked rural c entres, during the previous financial year.  \n \n(ii) RRBs opening branches in Tier 5 and 6 centres, may approach the Regional Office concerned \nof RBI for post-facto automatic issue of the licence/s.  \n \n(iii) The licence should be displayed in the premises of the branch so opened for information of its \ncustomers / public to instil confidence in them that the bank branch is authorized to conduct \nbanking business.  \n \n4.1 ( c) The Regional O ffice concerned of RBI,  through the Empowered C ommittee on Regional \nRural Banks , shall also be responsible for monitoring opening/closing/shifting /merger of b anking \noutlets  of the RRBs under their j urisdiction. Further, if any RRB fails to adhere to the requirement \nof opening 25% banking outlets in a URC, in a year, these RRBs shall  not be permitted to open \nbanking outlets in Tier 1 to Tier 4 centre s. \n \n4.1 (d) The policy covers the opening of \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 in all Tiers as defined on the basis of \npopulation as per Census 2011. The tier -wise and population group-wise classification of centres \nis provided in Annex I . \n \n4.2 The opening of \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 during a financial year will be subject to the conditions given \nbelow: \na) At least 25 percent of the total number of banking outlets  opened during a financial year \nmust  be opened in unbanked rural centres, as defined in Para 3.2 above. \n \nb) A part-time banking outlet, opened in any Centre, will  be counted and added to the \ndenominator as well as numerator on pro rata basis for computing the requirement as well as the compliance with the norm of opening 25 per cent banking outlets in unbanked rural \ncentres. Some illustrations on the computation of part-time banking outlet are provided under \nAnnex II\n. 4 \n c) A banking outlet/part-time banking outlet opened in any Tier 3 to Tier 6 centre of North-\nEastern States as well as in any Tier 3 to 6 centre of Left- wing Extremism (LWE) affected \ndistricts as notified by the Government of India from time to time, will be considered as \nequivalent to opening a banking outlet/ part-time banking outlet, as the case may be, in a URC. A list of LWE affected districts as notified by the Government as on February 24, 2016, \nis being provided in Annex III\n. As the overall objective of these guidelines is enabling \nexpansion of banking facilities in these under banked/ underserved centres, each banking \noutlet opened, irrespective of the banked/unbanked status of the c entre, will be reckoned as \nhaving been opened in a n URC.  \nd) A full -fledged \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 branch opened in a rural (Tier 5 and 6) centre which is \nalready being served by a fixed point BC outlet by any bank will be eligible to be treated as \nequivalent to opening a banking outlet in a URC. In other words, the first fixed point BC outlet \nof a bank as well as the first \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 branch of any bank opened in a URC will be \nreckoned for computing compliance with the 25 per cent norm.  \ne) The time given to a bank for opening a banking outlet is one year. If a bank fails to adhere to the requirement of opening 25% banking outlets in URC in a year, appropriate penal \nmeasures, including restrictions on opening of banking outlets in Tier 1  to 4 centres (except \ntier 5 and 6)  shall be imposed.  \n \n4.3 To encourage the RRBs to open more number of banking outlets in unbanked rural centres, \nthey will be allowed to carry forward the benefit of the banking outlets , if any, opened in excess of \nthe requirement specified in para 4.2 above, for a period of next 2 years. No further extension to \navail the benefit will be allowed. \n \n4.4. To enable banks to have information for identifying an unbanked rural c entre, State Level \nBanker s Committees (SLBCs) shall play a constructive and proactive role. The SLBCs shall \ncompile and have an updated list of all  unbanked rural centres in the s tate which shall be \ndisplayed on their website. This list will facilitate banks to choose/indicate the place where they \nwish to open a banking outlet. Banks shall infor m and coordinate with the SLBC c onvenor bank to \nearmark the centre identified by them. If a bank fails to open the banking outlet in the pres cribed \nperiod of 1 year as per para 4.2 (e) above, the SLBC  convenor bank may indicate the c entre as \navailable for other banks to open a banking outlet.   5 \n 4.5 If a RRB proposes to undertake government business at any of the banking outlets/part-time \nbanking outlets, it would require prior approval of the Government authority concerned as also of Department of Government and Bank Accounts, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai . \n \n5. Merger/Closure/ Shifting/Conversion of \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 \n5.1 RRBs  may shift, merge or close all banking  outlets (except rural outlets and sole semi -urban \noutlets) at their discretion. \n \n5.2 Merger, closure and shifting of any rural banking outlet as well as a s ole semi urban banking \noutlet would require approval of the DCC/DLRC  and Regional O ffice concerned of RBI. However, \nconver sion of any rural or sole semi -urban banking outlet into a full -fledged brick and mortar \nbranch and vice versa would not require such approval. While merging/closing/shifting/converting \na rural or a sole semi urban banking outl et, banks and DCC/DLRC shall ensure that the banking \nservice needs at that centre continue to be met, without disruptions.  \n \n5.3 RRBs should als o ensure that customers of the banking outlet, which is being \nmerged/closed/shifted are informed two months in advance so as to avoid inconvenience to them. \nFurther, banks should ensure that they continue to fulfi l the role entrusted to these banking outlets  \nunder the Government sponsored programm es and Direct Benefit Transfer s chemes.  \n \n5.4 It may further be ensur ed that banking outlets  are shifted within the same or to a lesser \npopulati on category, i.e., semi urban banking outlets  to semi urban or rural centres and rural \nbanking outlets  to other rural centres. \n \n6. Annual Banking Outlet Expansion Plan  \nRegional Rural Banks  shall submit their Annual Banking Outlet Expansion Plan (ABOEP), with the \napproval of Board of Directors, together with the consolidated details of proposals for opening, \nclosing, shifting, merger and conversion of these banking outlets as per Proforma giv en in Annex \nIV, to Regional Office concerned of RBI,  and to NABARD for monitoring.  \n \n6.2 It should be ensured that all the proposals conform to the guidelines contained in the above \nparas applicable to RRBs.  Individual proposals for opening new branches at specific centres, for \nwhich prior permission is required from RBI, must be submitted in the prescribed Form VI  in terms \nof Rule 12 of the Banking Regulation (Companies Rules), 1949, to the concerned Regional office 6 \n of RBI with recommendation of NABARD for approval. The ABOEP and any other proposal \nrequired to be submitted to RBI in this regard should have the approval of the Board of Directors of \nthe bank. RRBs  shall ensure that an authenticated / certified copy of such approval is invariably \nsubmitted along with these proposals. \n \n7. Manning of ATMs/E -kiosks/CDMs/BNAMs  \nBanks are allowed to set up onsite/offsite Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) at centr es/places \nidentified by them. B anks at their discretion may post suitable staff member(s) to provide guidance \nto the customers using the services of these outlets. Such ATMs shall not be reckoned as banking \noutlets  as defined i n paragraph 3.1 of the circular.  \n \n8. Mobile Branches \u2013  Extension to All Tiers \nThe scheme of mobile branch envisages extension of banking facilities through a well -protected \nvan with arrangements for two or three officials of the bank sitting in it with books, safe containing \ncash, etc. The mobile unit would visit the places proposed to be served by it on specific days/hours . The mobile offices would be attached to a branch of an RRB.  \nRegional Rural Banks are allowed to open/operate mobile branches in all Centres. These mobile \nbranches will not be considered as \u2018Banking Outlets \u2019. \n \n9. Setting up of Regional O ffices, Administrative Offices, Back Offices (Central Processing \nCentres/Service Branches) and Call Centres,  etc. \n9.1 RRBs shall be allowed to open one Regional Office (RO) for every 50 banking outlets . \nHowever, RRBs are required to obtain licence  from the concerned Regional Office of RBI prior to \nfunctioning / opening of these offices. RRB s having up to 50 banking outlets will be under the \ndirect control of the Head Office, without any i ntermediate tier. The cases of RRBs, which require \nrelaxation in the above norm with regard to the number of branches to be covered by one RO due \nto geographical / other conditions, will be examined by the Empowered Committee (EC) and \nreferred to Central O ffice, Department of Banking Regulation (DBR) for consideration. \nThe ROs shall not be permitted to transact any banking business. RRBs can either shift or close / \nmerge these offices at their discretion without prior approval of RBI, but they are required to inform \nthe change in address  to the concerned Regional Office of RBI at the earliest, but not later than \none month from the date of shifting. As regards closure / merger of such offices, the same may be \ncommunicated to the concerned Regional Office of R BI for cancellation immediately after the \nclosure / merger of the office under advice to the DSIM of RBI. 7 \n  \n9.2 RRBs may set up Training Centres, Back Offices (Central Processing Centres (CPCs)/Service \nBranches), Treasury Branches and Call Centres, etc. exc lusively to attend to back office functions \nsuch as and other functions incidental to their banking business  after obtaining necessary \npermission from the concerned Regional Office of RBI. They should not have any interface with \ncustomers and shall  not all owed to be converted into general banking branches.  \n \n9.3 The banks should ensure that administrative offices, training centres, back offices i.e. \nCPCs/service branches , etc. which are set up exclusively to attend to back office functions such as \nadministration, data processing, verification and processing of documents, issuance of cheque \nbooks, etc. on requests received from other banking outlets  should not have any direct interface \nwith customers for them to be not considered as banking outlets. Banks currently having specific permission to allow customer interface at these back offices (service branches and/or CPCs), have \nto align with the above instructions within one year from the date of this circular and report \ncompliance to Regional offices concerned of RBI. \n \n10. Business Facilitator/ Business Correspondent Model \nThe instructions on Business Facilitator/Business Correspondent Model as contained in our  Master \nCircular DBR.CO.RRB.BL.BC.No.17/31.01.002/2015-16 dated July 01, 2015  remain unchanged.  \n \n11. Customer Education \nWhile the banks will continue to follow guidelines as indicated in our  Master Circular \nDBR.CO.RRB.BL.BC.No.17/31.01.002/2015-16 dated July 01, 2015  they should also ensure to \nenlighten people about banking outlets, as adequate substitutes for physical \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 \nbranches in low population density or low population locations. \n \n12. Reporting Requirements \n12.1 RRBs shall furnish the information as per Proforma I ( Annex VI ) on opening of new place of \nbusiness i.e. branch/office/NAIOs (Non-Administratively Independent Office) and Proforma II \n(Annex VII ) on change in status \u2013  merger, conversion, closure,  etc. to Department of Statistics and \nInformation Management (DSIM), Banking Statistics Di vision, Reserve Bank of India, Central \nOffice, C -8/9, Bandra-Kurla Complex, Mumbai -400051.  \n 8 \n 12.2 As regards fixed point BC outlets classified as banking outlets , banks are required to report \nthe data as per  Annex VIII  on quarterly basis starting from April 01, 2018. In order to furnish the \ninitial statistics, banks have to furnish the first such report to DSIM, Reserve Bank of India (position \nas on March 31, 2017), not later than one month from the date of issue of thi s Circular.  \n \n12.3 From the current year 2018-19, the reporting on opening of branches to the Department of \nBanking Regulation, Central Office has been dispensed with. \n \n13. All the salient changes made from the existing branch authorization framework are furnished in \nthe Appendix . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9 \n Annex I \n \nDetails of tier -wise classification of centres based on population \n \ni)  Classification of centres (tier -wise)   Population(as per 2011 Census)  \nTier 1  - 1,00,000 and above  \nTier 2  - 50,000 to 99,999  \nTier 3  - 20,000 to 49,999  \nTier 4  - 10,000 to 19,999  \nTier 5  - 5,000 to 9,999  \nTier 6  - Less than 5000  \n \nii) Population-group wise classification of centres  \n \nRural Centre  - Population up to 9,999  \nSemi -urban centre  - from 10,000 to 99,999  \nUrban centre  - from 1,00,000 to 9,99,999  \nMetropolitan centre  - 10,00,000 and above  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 \n Annex II  \nIllustrations for calculation of part time banking outlets \n \nPrescribed Period for Banking Outlet is 4 hours per day for 5 days (min. 20 hours spread over 5 \ndays) this will remain constant denominator. For ensuring that fairly regular service is available to \ncustomers, a maximum of 4 hours per day will be counted.  \n \nExample I \n \nA banking outlet works for 2 hours for 2 days  \n \nMultiplying 2 x 2= 4 hours out of 20 prescribed hours. \n \nIt will be counted 0.2 (4/20) outlet.  \n \nIt would be added to the denominator (if opened in any centre/any tier) and in the numerator (if \nopened in URC).  \n \nExample 2: \n \nA banking outlet works for 6 hours for 3 days  \n \nMax. Benefit allowed: 4 hours per day  \n \nHence 4x3 = 12 so 12/20 = It will be equal to 0.6 outlet.  \n \nExample 3: \n \nTotal no. of Banking Outlets (Full time) opened - 100 \n \nOpened in URCs (Full time) \u2013  30 \n \nOpened in URCs (Part time Banking Outlet) - 2 outlets working for 6 hours for 3 days in URCs  \n \nMax. Benefit allowed: 4 hours per day  \n \nHence 4x3 = 12 so 12/20 = It will be equal to 0.6 = 06*2 = 1.2 outlets.  \n \n \n \nFor computation of 25% URC,  \n \nTotal outlets opened = 100+1.2 = 101.2 \n \nOpened in URC = 30+1.2 =31.2 \n \nURC % = 31.2/101.2*100 = 30.83% (Complies with the norm)  \n \n \n  11 \n Annex - III  \nList of LWE districts \n \n Andhra Pradesh    Chhattisgarh   Maharashtra  \n 1.

Merger/Closure/ \nShifting/Conversion of \n\u2018Banking Outlets\u2019  \n Shifting of Branches - At Rural Centres  \n(a) The shifting of branches in rural \ncentres may be effected by RRBs \nthemselves without o btaining the prior \napproval of RBI , subject to the condition \nthat both the existing and proposed \ncentres are within the same block, and \nthat the relocated branch would be able \nto cater adequately to the banking needs \nof the villages served by the existing \nbranch.  \nShifting of Branches - At Urban / \nMetropolitan Centres / Semi Urban \nCentres  \n(b)(i) RRBs may shift their branches at \nsemi urban centres / urban / metropolitan \ncentres within the same locality / \nmunicipal ward without the prior \napproval of RBI . It should, however, be \nensured that the locality / ward is not \nrendered unbanked due to the shifting of \nbranch/es.  \n(ii) RRBs have to obtain prior approval \nof the concerned Regional Office of \nRBI for shifting of branches outside the \nlocality / municipal ward at semi urban / \nurban / metropolitan centres.  \n(c) RRBs may shift their branches as \nindicated above, but ensure that the \nlicence of the branch is submitted to the \nconcerned Regional Office of R BI for \ngetting the new address incorporated \ntherein at the earliest but not later than \nthree months from the date of the shifting \nof the branch.  \n(d) RRBs should, however, ensure that \ncustomers of the branch, which is being RRBs may shift, merge or close all \n\u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 (except rural outlets and \nsole semi -urban outlets) at their discretion.  \nMerger, Closure and shif ting of any Rural \n\u2018Banking Outlet\u2019 as well as a Sole Semi \nUrban \u2018Banking Outlet\u2019 would require \napproval of the DCC/DLRC and Regional \noffice concerned of RBI. However, \nconversion of any rural or sole semi -urban \nbanking outlet into a full -fledged brick and \nmortar branch and vice versa would not \nrequire such approval. While \nmerging/closing/shifting/converting a rural \nor a sole semi urban \u2018Banking Outlet\u2019, \nbanks and DCC/DLRC shall ensure that the \nbanking service needs at that centre \ncontinue to be met, without disruptions.  \n \nRRBs should also ensure that customers of \nthe Banking Outlet, which is being \nmerged/closed/shifted are informed two \nmonths in advance so as to avoid \ninconvenience to them. Further, banks \nshould ensure that they continue to fulfil the \nrole ent rusted to these \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 \nunder the Government sponsored \nprogrammes and Direct Benefit Transfer \nSchemes.  \nIt may further be ensured that \u2018Banking \nOutlets\u2019 are shifted within the same or to a \nlesser population category, i.e., semi urban \n\u2018Banking Outl ets\u2019 to semi urban or rural \ncentres and rural \u2018Banking Outlets\u2019 to other \nrural centres.  \n 41 \n shifted, are informed well in ti me before \nactual shifting of the branch, so as to \navoid inconvenience to them.  \nConversion of Branches  \n(a) RRBs may themselves decide the \nneed for conversion of the existing loss \nmaking branches into satellite / mobile \noffices keeping in view the cost -benefit \naspect, the likely inconvenience that may \nbe caused to the existing clientele, the \neffect of the conversion on the \nperformance in the preparation of district \ncredit plan and priority sector lending. \nWith a view to providing better customer \nservice in rural areas, RRBs may also \nconvert their satellite offices into full-\nfledged branches after obtaining \nconcurrence from the Empowered \nCommittee (EC) and RRBs should also \nobtain necessary licence from the \nconcerned Regional Office of RBI.  \n(b) Conversion of branches into \nsatellite offices at centres other than rural \nis not permissible.  \nMerger of Branches - Where two loss \nmaking branches of any RRB are in close \nproximity to each other (i.e. within a \ndistance of about 5 kms.), the RRB may \nconsider merging the two branches with a \nview to rationalising the spatial spread \nand reducing establishment / operating \ncosts.  \n7 Mobile Branches  The mobile office/s should not visit the \nrural places which are served by \ncooperative banks and places served by \nregular offices of commercial banks.  Regional Rural Banks are allowed to \nopen/operate mobile branches in all \nCentres. These mobile branches will not be \nconsidered as Banking Outlets.  \n8. Setting up of \nAdministrative Offices, \nBack Offices (Central \nProcessing \nCentres/Service \nBranches) and Call \nCentres etc.  Although current guidelines prohibited \nany customer interaction, over time, some \nexceptions were allowed based on banks\u2019 \nrequests which are not uniform in nature.  No Customer Interface will be allowed. \nBanks which are currently having specific \npermission to allow limited customer \ninterface at CPCs will have to align with the \nabove instructions within one year from the \ndate of this circular.  \n9 Guidelines on Satellite \nOffices, Part Shifting of \nbranches, Extension \nCounters, Ultra small \nBranches, Specialised \nBranches subsumed.  Separate guidelines existed for these \noutlets.  No separate guidelines required as all \nthese outlets will be considered as banking \noutlets or part -time banking outlets, as the \ncase may be.  \n10 Role of Board of \nDirectors  Limited to approval of Annual Branch \nExpansion Plans.  Financial Inclusion being the overarching \nobjective of the revised framework and the \noperational flexibility being given to banks, \nthe Board has been given overall \nresponsibility to ensure tha t all the \nguidelines are complied with.  \n11 Reporting \nRequirements  - From the current year 2018 -19, the \nreporting on opening of branches to the \nDepartment of Banking Regulation, Central \nOffice has been dispensed with.  \n \n ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI19438D758BEDDEB4CD9B696D13D93ECC2D3.PDF"}, {"title": null, "date": "May 30, 2019", "info": " \n \nRBI/2018- 19/193  \nIDMD.CDD.No. 3391/14.04.050/2018 -19                                                                                   May 30, 2019    \n  \nThe Chairman & Managing Director   \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks   \n(Excluding RRBs)  \nDesignated Post Offices  \nStock H olding Corporation of India ltd.(SHCIL)  \nNational Stock Exchange of India Ltd. & Bombay Stock Exchange  Ltd. \n  \nDear Sir/Madam,   \n  \nSovereign G old Bond Scheme 2019- 20 - Series I/II/III/IV  - Operational Guidelines  \n  \nThis has reference to the GoI notification F.No.4( 7)-W&M/2019 dated May 30, 2019 and RBI circular \nIDMD.CDD.No. 3392/14.04.050/2018 -19 dated May 30, 2019  on the Sovereign Gold Bonds.

Further, there shall not be any \u2018dual hatting\u2019 i.e.\nthe CRO shall not be given any other responsibility.\nd) The CRO shall be involved in the process of identification, measurement and mitigation of\nrisks. All credit products (retail or wholesale) shall be vetted by the CRO from the angle of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninherent and control risks.

In order to distinguish the    \nApril 201 9 (year 2019 -20) and March Residual Transactions, the statement \npertaining to March Residual Transactions should be clearly marked as \"March \nResidual Account\".   The statement of March (Residual) Transactions should be sent \nby all F ocal Point Branches  to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers  \nlatest by April 18, 201 9.    \n \nNote: As advised in our circular GA.NB.No.376/42.01.001/1995 -96 dated May 22, \n1996 all the cheques/amounts realized on or before March 31, 2019  should be \ntreated as transactions relating to the current financial year as \"March 201 9 or March \nResidual Transactions\", the reporting of which may take place during the month of April (upto April 1 0, 2019 ).

FSD.  BC. No.21/05.04.001/2017- 18 dated June 7, \n2018  conveying continuation of Interest Subvention Scheme on the interim basis.  In this \nregard, it is advised that Government of India has approved the implementation of the \nInterest Subvention Scheme with modifications  for the year s 2018 -19 and 2019- 20 for \nshort term crop loans up to \u20b9 3 lakh with the following stipulations:   \n \ni. In order to provi de short -term crop loans upto \u20b9 3 lakh to f armers at an interest \nrate of 7% p.a. during the year s 2018- 19 and 2019- 20, it has been decided to \noffer interest subvention of 2% per annum to lending institutions viz. Public \nSector Banks (PSBs) and  Private Sect or Commercial Banks (in respect of loans \ngiven by their rural and semi -urban branches only). This interest subvention of \n2% will be calculated on the crop loan amount from the date of its disbursement /drawal up to the date of actual repayment of the crop l oan by the \n \n farmer or up to the due date of the loan fixed by the banks whichever is earlier, \nsubject to a maximum period of one year.  \nii. To provide an additional interest subvention of  3% per annum to such of those \nfarmers repaying in time i .e. from the date of disbursement of the crop loan upto \nthe actual date of repayment by farmers or upto the due date fixed by the bank s \nfor repayment of crop loan, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year from the date of disbursement. Thi s also implies that the farmers \nrepaying promptly  as above would get short term crop loans @ 4% per annum \nduring the year s 2018 -19 and 2019- 20. This benefit would not accrue to those  \nfarmers who repay their crop loans after one year of availing such loans.  \niii. In order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store their produce in warehouses, the benefit of interest subvention will be available to small and marginal farmers  having Kisan Credit Card for a further period of upto  \nsix months post the harvest of the crop at the same rate as available to crop loan against negotiable warehouse receipts issued on the produce stored in \nwarehouses accredited with Warehousing Development Regulatory Authority \n(WDRA).  \niv. To provide relief to f armers affected by natural calamities , an interest subvention \nof 2%  per annum will be made available to banks for the first year on the \nrestructured loan amount. Such restructured loans will attract normal rate of \ninterest from the second year onwards.  \nv. However, to provide relief to the farmers affected due to severe natural \ncalamities, an interest subvention of 2 percent  per annum will be made available \nto banks for  the first three years/entire period (subject to a maximum of five \nyears) on the restructured loan amount. Further,  in all such cases, the benefit of \nprompt repayment  incentive @ 3% per annum shall also be provided to the \naffected farmers. T he grant  of such benefits in cases of severe natural calamities \nshall, however, be decided  by a H igh Level Committee (H LC) based on the \nrecommendation of Inter -Ministerial Ce ntral Team (IMC T) and Sub Committee of \nNational E xecutive  Committee (SC -NEC).  \nvi. To avoid multiple loaning and to ensure that only genuine farmers avail \nconcessional crop loan through the mechanism of gold loans, the lending  \n institutions may conduct due diligence and ensure proper documentation \nincluding recording of land details even when the farmer avails gold loans for \nsuch purposes.  \nvii. To ensure hassle- free benefits to farmers under  Interest Subvention Scheme,  \nbanks  are advised to make Aadhar linkage mandatory for availing short -term \ncrop loans in 2018- 19 and 2019- 20. \nviii. Further , from 2018 -19, the I nterest Subvention Sche me is being put on DBT \nmode on \u2018In Kind /service s\u2019 basis and all short term crop loans processed in \n2018- 19 are required to be brought on ISS portal  / DBT platform. Banks are \nadvised to capture and submit category wise data of beneficiaries under the \nscheme and report the same on ISS portal individual farmer wise once it is \nlaunched to settle the claims arising from 2018- 19 onwards.  \n \n2. Banks may give adequate publicity to the above scheme so that the farmers can avail the benefits.  \n \n3. All lending banks are requested to send us the eligible pending audited claims of \n2017 -18 latest by August  30, 2019 . Please note that under no circumstances further \nextension will be granted in this regard.  \n 4.

Allotment at margin (i.e., at the lowest retention period accepted), in case the amount bid \nat margin is more than the amount available for allotment, shall be as below:  \ni. The marginal bid shall be allocated partially such that the total acceptance \namount matches the auction amount.  \nii. In case there are more than one marginal bids, allocation shall be made to the bid with the largest amount, and then in descending order of amount bid until the \nacceptance amount matches the auction amount.  \niii. In case the amount offered is the same for two or more marginal bids, the \namount will be allocated equally. \nf. If an FPI has been allotted multiple bids in an auction, the CPS shall be reckoned for \neach bid separately. \ng.

Please refer to the circular s DBR. No.BP.BC.100/21.04.048/2017- 18 dated \nFebruary 07, 2018  and DBR.No.BP.BC.108/21.04.048/2017- 18 dated June 6, 2018 . \nIn this regard, with a view to facilitate meaningful  restructuring  of MSME accounts  \n{MSME as defined in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development \n(MSMED) Act, 2006 } that have become stressed, it has been decided to permit a \none-time restructuring of existing loans  to MSMEs classified as \u2018standard\u2019 without a \ndowngrade in the asset classification,  subject to the following conditions:  \ni. The aggregate exposure, including non- fund based facilities, of banks  and \nNBFCs to the borrower does not exceed \u20b9 250 million as on January 1, 2019.  \nii. The borrower\u2019s account is  in default but is a  \u2018standard asset\u2019 as on January 1, \n2019 and continues to be classified as a \u2018standard asset\u2019 till the date of \nimplementation of the restructuring.   \niii. The borrowing entity is GST -registered on the date of implementation of the \nrestructuring . However, this condition will not apply to MSMEs that are exempt \nfrom GST -registration.  \niv. The restructuring of the borrower account is  implemented on or before March \n31, 2020. A restructuring would be treated as implemented if the following \nconditions are met:  \na. all related documentation, including execution of neces sary agreements \nbetween lenders and borrower / creation of security charge / perfection of securities are completed by all lenders; and 2 \n   \n \nb. the new capital structure and / or changes in the terms and  conditions of \nthe existing loans get duly reflected in the books of all the lenders and the \nborrower.  \nv. A provision of 5 % in addition to the provisions already held, shall be made in \nrespect of accounts restructured under these instructions. Banks will, \nhowever, have the option of reversing such provisions at the end of the \nspecified period, subject to the account demonstrating satisfactory performance during the specified period as defined at paragraph 5  below.  \nvi. Post-restructuring, NPA classification of thes e accounts shall be as per the \nextant IRAC norms .  \nvii. Banks  and NBFCs  shall make appropriate disclosures in their financial \nstatements, under \u2018Notes on Accounts\u2019, relating to the MSME accounts \nrestructured under these instructions as per the following format:  \n \nNo. of accounts restructured  Amount (\u20b9 in million ) \n  \n \nviii. All other instructions applicable to restructuring of loans to MSME borrowers \nshall continue to be applicable.  \n 2. Banks  and NBFCs desirous of adopting this scheme shall put in place a Board \napproved policy on restructuring of MSME advances under these instructions within a month from the date of this circular. The policy shall , inter alia , include framework \nfor viability assessment of the stressed accounts and regu lar monitoring of the \nrestructured accounts.  \n 3.\n It is clarified that accounts classified as NPA can be restructured; however, the \nextant asset classification norms governing restructuring of NPAs will continue to apply.   \n \n4. As a general rule , barring the above one- time exception,  any MSME account  \nwhich is restructured must be downgraded to NPA upon restructuring and will slip \ninto progressively lower asset classification and higher provisioning requirements as 3 \n   \n \nper extant IRAC norms.  Such an ac count  may be considered for upgradation to \n\u2018standard\u2019 only if it demonstrates  satisfactory performance during the specified \nperiod.  \n \n5. \u2018Specified Period\u2019 means a period of one year from the commencement of the first \npayment of interest or principal, which ever is later, on the credit facility with longest \nperiod of moratorium under the terms of restructuring package.  \u2018Satisfactory \nPerformance\u2019 means no payment (interest and/or principal) shall remain overdue for \na period of more than 30 days. In case of cash credit / overdraft account, satisfactory performance means that the outstanding in the account shall not be more than the \nsanctioned limit or drawing power, whichever is lower, for a period of more than 30 \ndays.  \n \n \nYours faithfully,  \n \n \n(Saurav Sinha)  \nChief General Manager -in-Charge ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI10062D55CDAC41B47749D3213030B5E3D99.PDF"}]
